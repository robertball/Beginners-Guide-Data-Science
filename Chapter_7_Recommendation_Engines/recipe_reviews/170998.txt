Fabulous!  I knew this was going to be a good recipe when I read the ingredients, but it's beyond good.  I only had the powdered pectin which I added slowly, stirred frequently and used two boxes.  I think in hind sight I could have used a box and a half.  You need to cook jelly until it passes the "gel-test."  Put a small dish in the freezer until it's cold, drop a puddle of your concoction on the dish and push it back with your finger - if there's a light skin on the top and the mixture slides back, it's done.  Mine turned out a little too thick when I put it in the fridge, but at room temperature the texture is perfect.  Instead of mincing the red peppers I used peeled/roasted red peppers and put them in a food processor.  Worked out perfectly - lovely red flecks of peppers mixed in with the carrot shreds.  Now here's the real orgasm... pour some jelly on top of ch√®vre (goat cheese) and serve it with crackers...  OMG!  That'll snap any silly cowgirl right on out of the blues!  Tomorrow I will try to blend some with butter to make habanero butter...  Thank you so much!

I am giving this a 5 star because I think I did something wrong that was no fault of the recipe.  I am new at making any kind of jam with my concentration being on pepper jams.  I did not notice the recipe called for LIQUID pectin so I accidently added the stated amount in powder.  My jam has not set up like others I have made.  Can someone tell me if it had to do with using powder instead of liquid or is this particular jam more of a honey consistency?  I haven't tried any yet because I keep hoping it will set up however it has been about a month and hasn't.  Should I just toss and make again using liquid?

This is wonderful! I was looking for a way to use up our Habeneros from our garden and I made a small test batch of this.  I wish I would have made more!  While the carrots scared my bf, they ended up being perfect.  They added great color and needed texture.  This is very sweet with a lot of warmth it in.  It's perfect!  Everyone that has tasted it, loves it.  My bf has eaten it on crackers, on sandwiches and even added it to some chili I made. It's so good! Now we are eagerly waiting for the current harvest of habeneros to get ripe so I can make a large batch!

Awesome...I made this in October (picture posted by me) and I opened a jar on Christmas eve and it was a hit.  Great with brie... and pretty much anything creamy. Try procuitto(sp?) wrapped pears with blue cheese, and a dollop of jelly.  Also I made this into a salad dressing using  a spoonful of jelly, olive oil, salt, lemon, & vinegar.

very addictive, I added the seeded hot peppers to a food processor with a little of the vinegar and semi pureed before adding to the surgar mixture.  The final heat w/ 15 peppers was just right for us, maybe little hot for some and not enough for others.  ended up w/ 6 or 7 half pints.

First time canning and it was a fun and delicious success! The only change I made was using Serrano peppers in place of Habaneros (we had a bumper crop this year) which turned out to be the perfect combination of heat and sweet. The jelly looks almost artistic inside the jars! I will definitely be giving these out as gifts! As a side note, the yield was actually 6 half-pint jars instead of the 8 shown in the recipe.

We had bags of habaneros from the garden, and this was a great way to make use of them. The recipe came together very easily--though you may want to make sure you have plenty of ventilation when you de-seed the peppers. The taste and texture of the jelly is very good. Like others, I had concerns about the carrots, but they do blend well. There is a strong vinegar scent to the finished jelly that I find off-putting. When I make a second batch, I'll cut the vinegar with a little water or use apple cider instead.

Followed this recipe and it turned out really really well. Mind you I adjusted the servings to 20 (which fills a 650ml/22 oz jar). I used powdered pectin instead of liquid pectin. Did a bit of reading and found that 2tbsp powdered pectin is roughly equivalent to 1 packet liquid pectin. Was also advised to whisk the pectin powder into the sugar prior to mixing to help prevent clumping and encourage more even setting.

I haven't tried it yet but the ingredients add up to almost four 8 oz. jars. How did you get eight 8 oz. jars? What did I do wrong? I must add that I'm a first time jelly maker. I'll update my review after I taste it (hoping that I didn't accidentally sabotage the recipe).

This recipe makes the best jelly. I love it with cream cheese and crackers. I would add one thing to the first step though, open all of the windows in your house. This is hot to make!

This recipe is wonderful and full of flavor and vibrant color.  I had a can of roasted red bell peppers, so I tried subbing them for the raw in the recipe, the second time I made this jelly, and it was wonderful.  I also tend to gently shake the jars as they cool so that the mixure combines as it sets, rather than let the solid parts float, I prefer the even distribution to the floating effect.  I give these every year at Christmas along with a jar of Strawberry Preserves (also found on this website) and everyone loves it.  This year I made it a little hotter than usual and got rave reviews from all my family, so I will not skimp on the habanero any more.  Try it over cream cheese with crackers, a distinct crowd pleaser at parties, and very pretty when displayed on a platter nicely.

Awesome...very easy, too. Used food processor with grater attachment for the carrots and peppers after removing seeds and ribs...15 peppers was just right for a nice zing!!

I absolutely love this recipe and, by accident, found a new twist.  My husband planted habanero and Jalapeno, so I had to mix them to get the numbers for the recipe.  They were also green (could not wait to get them red).  And in the end, I came to realize I did not have liquid pectin, so I used powder and I was short of the amount (or did not convert properly).  So I had a very tasty result, where the hot peppers caramelized.  But it did not set with the consistency of a jelly -- Instead of redoing or thickening (because I had already sealed the jars), I  tried this recipe as "habanero/jalapeno/ sweet pepper DRESSING", and warmed it up a little and coated my green leaves salad with some pear and walnuts.  It was so addictive I am using the batch as a dressing and I thicken it a bit with cream cheese or other similar creamy type of cheese to eat with crackers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Today I got all the correct ingredients and will make it a true jelly.

Excellent pepper jelly but mine turned out way too thick. This was my first jelly attempt so i need to do some research on how to fix that. I only used 12 habeneros instead of all 15 and it is plenty hot for me. Gloves are a must and I think I will use a nose/mouth mask as well as some eye gear, I was hurtin' while seedin' those things! Definitely will try again for the perfect consistency.

This was my first time making pepper jelly and I'm very proud of the results. I wanted to double the recipe but I only had 20 habaneros so I included two peppers unseeded to make sure I got enough heat. It turned out delicious. Hot, but not too hot for the heat lovers in my family. The color is a lovely orange between the color of the habaneros and the carrots with pretty red flecks from red pepper. The only thing I will do next time is shred my carrots very finely.  This time I used a package of preshedded carrots to make it even easier and I think it might look even nicer in the jar and on the cream cheese if next time I  shred my own with a fine shred. The carrots really add a nice touch so don't leave them out. Some reviews said it tasted and smelled too vinegary.  I don't think so at all.  The carrots and red pepper did tend to float up from the bottom of the jar and distribute to the upper 2/3 of the jar but it still looks very nice.  Delicous, very pretty in the jar.  Can't wait to give a few out for gifts if we don't eat it all first.

I just made this jelly. It looks so pretty in the jars. I followed the recipe other than using yellow pepper and red pepper. We dipped toast into some after cooking it and it's delicious! I'm going to make turkey meatballs for a party and use this jelly as a glaze. I'll be making this every year to use up some of my habanero crop.

So awesome! I trusted the good reviews and doubled the recipe. I only used 10 cups of sugar instead of 13 for the doubles recipe. It made 12 1/2 pint jars. I used the matchstick carrots and they add a fun little crunch. This will def be a must for any peppers!

Wonderful idea to use carrot. The finished product looks and tastes great.

I used my food processor with chopping blade to chop 11 hot peppers, seeds and all, then placed on a fine shredding blade to shred 1 carrot and 1 red pepper. I put that in a pot with 1 cup of white vinegar and 1.25 cups crab apple juice (instead of the pectin) and the sugar.  After boiling for approximately 10 minutes it was thickened enough and then I processed it for 5 minutes. I check for thickening by dipping a fork in and when it starts to stick between about half of the tines and look a little bit syrupy I call it done.

I like using the apple pectin from crab apples that I harvest because it avoids using liquid pectin and I think it tastes better. This modification left some vinegar but not enough to leave a vinegar taste as Steve noticed.

Thanks, was looking for a recipe that would be good for holiday gifts for those who are looking for something with heat...got everything ready to make and found only had one pouch of liquid pectin. After much research I decided I would go with the powdered, used 8 TBS of the Ball brand that comes loose in a bottle,  those who said they used powdered never said when they put it in. I decided I would use it like I do with other jam recipes & put it along with the carrots, both peppers and vinegar at the beginning, brought to a boil and cooked for 5 minutes. Added the sugar, brought back up to a rolling boil to cook for another minute then put in jars and water bath. It was thick when going into the jars. Got 6- 1/2 pint jars of very pretty jam. Think this will be a hit as it wasn't real hot eating but it sure leaves your mouth, or at least mine, tingling afterwards.

I have made this jelly several times, exactly the way the recipe is written, and have enjoyed it.  This time I wanted to try something different. I grilled canned pineapple rings (5) and chopped them very fine. I used an addtional 1/2 package of powdered pectin (along with the liquid pectin)  to compensate for the extra moisture from the pineapple. The jelly turned out really good! Thank you for an excellent recipe that can be modified so easily.

I have made this jelly twice now and both times it turned out great.  I am by no means a jelly expert but this is a very pretty jelly too.  This year I gave as gifts and even people that prefer more mild foods said they liked it.  The taste is very good and the heat, while present, is not shockingly hot, just what I would describe as a "slow burn" that builds up the more you eat.   I used 15 peppers when I made it and I removed all seeds and white pith.  I used a food processor to chop the habaneros, red pepper and carrots up to a very fine consistency.  I chopped each separately.  The year prior some of my habaneros were still green which did not affect the taste but made the jelly very pretty as it had flecks of green and orange floating in it.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic! I had huge habanero peppers so I only used 10. Wow, alot of heat, alot of flavor and it made exactly 8 jars. I am posting a picture. This was my first time making jelly but let me tell you, I have been so impressed with myself for doing so! It could not have been any easier. tip: Wear rubber gloves or double gloves to avoid burning the fingers with the peppers. Will be giving these as gifts.

Just my opinion, but I feel like less pectin would have been better.  The way it set up reminds me of jello and isn't very easy to spread.

OMG this is the bomb! Our first batch had the vinegary smell to it which could have been a turn off if it didn't taste so amazing!!! The second batch we cooked the sugar and vinegar a little longer to burn it off. Turned out fabulous with cream cheese and crackers, or mixed with a little bbq sauce to dip your chicken in! I would give it a 10+ if I could!

I just made my first batch of this jelly an hour ago and it's my first experience with canning.  I tasted a little before putting it in the jars and it was fabulous.  But, when I took the jars out of the canner, the veggies (carrots/pepper pieces) had floated to the top.   Did I do something wrong?

This is absolutely amazing, I gave it to several family and friend (some people didnt try it since they thought it will be too spicey) but the people that did tried it, they requested for more! I like to eat it with triscuits or ritz crackers and cream cheese. Makes a beautiful appetizer also.

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! This jelly is so good it won't last long when you put it out with cream cheese and crackers.  Easy to make EXCEPT for the power of these peppers.  Do NOT touch pepper or your dishes during clean up without wearing gloves!!!

This jelly is so good. I've made this twice and each time I came out with 6 and 1/2, half pints, instead of 8, as stated.

This stuff is awesome.  It turned out great and it is the first time I have ever made a jelly.  It kicks you right in the taste buds for sure and is definitely addictive.  Great with cream cheese and crackers.

Absolutely wonderful.  The best way we've found to use up all of our habaneros.  This was our first jelly and canning experience.  Just follow the directions and you won't be sorry.  The perfect balance of heat and sweet.

I made two batches. The first one, following the recipe, was great for those who like a milder flavour. The second one for family and  friends who like things  really hot,  adding another half as many peppers. It's great with a soft cheese on a good cracker or with chicken.  
It would be helpful to have a weight on the peppers as they vary so much in size.  Will definitely make the recipe again next year.

This was AMAZING!!! my 1st time ever to make jelly/jam besides cranberries and it was the best! Make sure you wear latex or synthetic gloves!!! I put 3 unpeeled carrots and 1 red bell pepper in my Ninja processor and voila no chopping needed, then I removed seeds from 15 habaneros (left seeds in from 2 or 3 habaneros for look and flavor) from my garden in the ninja and voila! I ended up with 10.5 jars of Habanero Jelly!!! awesome Christmas gifts and I saved my peppers from the freeze!!! Happy ending for all!

I've been on a canning jag lately and pepper jelly has been my focus.

This recipe is BRILLIANT!  I prepared it exactly as written, and it came out absolutely perfect (which is a welcome change to a number of recipes ive tried having to be reprocessed, etc).

The jam set up as soon as it cooled!  Perfect texture, the carrots added a beautiful touch of texture.  The jars look like art, absolutely gorgeous color and will make a beautiful gift.

The heat is perfect.  I like it hot, and this does not disappoint, but it's still edible and tasty, sweet and hot, it is truly a perfect recipe and will be in my regular rotation!  

Eternal thanks to the author/poster for this one, I am absolutely thrilled, and THANKS YOU for specifying EXACTLY what size and type of pectin used!!  So many recipes state "one package if pectin"...well, what is that...an envelope?  A box of 2?  A jar of powder?  Powdered or liquid?   Ugh...this recipe was a very welcome change to all that, and it made EXACTLY 8 8oz jars!

Made this for some of my friends who love spicy things. they couldn't get enough of it! started dipping everything in it from their chicken to pizza to chips to popcorn and even in their sandwiches! it was a total hit! i reduced my sugar to 5 cups instead of the 6 1/2 cups but it came out to have the perfect amount of sweetness. REMEMBER to wear gloves while cutting the habanero. i made the mistake of not because i didn't have any and my hands were burning painfully for the next 3 days. definitely learned my lesson there. other than that, i will definitely be doing this again! ;) happy cooking!

I just finished making this recipe.  I was so disappointed because it turned out to be way too hot.  I don't think we can eat it but I will make another batch and cut down on the habaneros. I think this recipe should be revised and reposted.  The flavor is good but I just wasted a whole recipe!

Talk about vinegar......too much of a vinegar taste for me.  Can't get past that bitterness.  The spice of the peppers helps but I know I won't be making this recipe again.  Also, I only got 6 1/2 jars.  The search goes on for another recipe...sorry

I've never made jelly before and I'm a beginning canner, but this recipe was super user friendly.  I haven't tried the jam yet, but it's very visually beautiful and smells delicious, so I can't wait to try other reviewers suggestions of eating this on soft cheeses, as a marinade, or even on PB&J!  The only thing I think I would do differently next time is use the liquid pectin--I tried the powdered kind and simply made it "liquid" by preparing a package of the pectin with the Quick method--i.e. boiling it for 1 minute with 3/4 cup water and then stirring it in the jelly mix.  The jelly turned out really thin, almost like a jarred sweet chili sauce like you'd find in Asian cooking.  I'm not sure if it will set up more or if I'm just stuck with a thick suryp instead, but I will either try to add more powdered pectin next time or use the liquid (which I was having trouble finding at the grocery store).  In any case, this is inexperience on my part, not problems with the recipe.  I agree with other users that it made less than stated--I also made the mistake of using larger jars so this recipe only filled one big jar and then one small one.  Sad--I was hoping to have a lot more, but again, I'll make adjustments next time.  The color is gorgeous--I found it helpful to rough chop the carrot shreds, red pepper and the habaneros in my food processor--much for uniform pieces that were more conducive to jelly.  The carrots are a must--the finished jelly is a bright, reddish orange!

This is an amazing jelly! My sister made it two years ago, I made it last year, and this year I had to double my habarnero plants to keep up with the demand of the rest of the family! Making jelly is HARD, but this recipe gives great, clear directions. This year, I bought a Ball Utensil Set for Preserving, which is a God-send.  I used a food processor for the peppers and carrots to make life easier, but otherwise have never deviated from the recipe. Serve it over brie or goat cheese, and it's a fabulous appetizer. Or do what my sister-in-law does, and make it your favorite condiment for sandwiches! Regardless, you'll love it, and you'll find yourself trying to figure out who is "jelly-worthy", because this jelly goes fast!

This was my first time canning and I was very nervous about it. This recipe was fantastic and turned out great! I had a random mix of peppers from a local farm (from mild to hot). I left out the red bell and used mostly aji dulces, with some habaneros, and serranos and got a nice medium heat. the carrots add a little sweetness and lots of color, but otherwise i didn't really taste them.

This is great on everything! I made 2 batches, one with all sugar and one with half Splenda. The Splenda batch is runnier of course, but makes it perfect for glazing chicken breasts or pork chops. Yum!

Recipe is easy to follow and the jelly is awesome! Friends and family have been begging me to make more so I will be making several batches in the next few weeks. Gloves are a must!

This is excellent!  It's not too hot or too sweet!  Instead of using the red bell pepper, I just increased the amount of carrot to to 2 cups.  I also only used 1 pouch of powdered pectin.  It's not super thick, but perfect on a cracker with cream cheese!!!

This was my first time making jelly AND canning and it was a great experience both ways.  The jelly was phenomenal and the process took about 2 hours from start to finish.  I had a mix of peppers: habaneros, jalapenos and thai chilis.  I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding 6 drops of red food coloring to the jelly before putting it in the jars.  YUM!

I made this jelly exactly as the recipe states! Turned out great! Set up perfectly, looks pretty in the jars &  I got 8- half pint jars exactly like the recipe says! Tried some and first reaction was #*%!@ that is HOT!!! But had to keep trying it over & over! Some cream cheese would definitely compliment the heat, if I had some. Be sure to have good ventilation while seeding & chopping the peppers. Use gloves!!

Love this recipe. The only thing I do differently is I don't seed the peppers. Makes it extra "special".

I have made this recipe several times, the only change I made was to use my blender instead of trying to mince everything; made it a lot easier.  Surprisingly this actually goes well on everything, I've even used it on PB&J.  The last batch I used 20 habaneros to get a little more kick, been too scared to try leaving the seeds in though.

This is one of the BEST pepper jelly recipes I have ever had.  It set up perfectly, has wonderful flavor, and a nice kick!!  So GOOD I have gone through three jars in a week! I have been slicing a baguette in thin slices, coating one side with pepper jelly, then placing a small piece of brie cheese on top.  Bake at 400 for 10 minutes until melted.  Quick and easy appetizer to please a crowd!

Very easy, maybe too much pectin by 1-2 tbl.  Everything from my garden.  I made it 2 ways, all green jalapenos and a small green pepper, keeping more then half of the seeds and stems, nice heat with the sweet.  Then I did it with red jalapeno peppers and a red poblano, very few seeds and stems = no heat.  My plan is for Xmas gifts, green and red bagged together.  Hot and mild. I will serve both colors together with a small sign stating the heat level.  How nice that will look at the Holidays, huh? It made 13 half quart (4oz) jars, with about 1/4 cup into my fridge for tasting now.

Awesome easy recipe to follow.  We've made it with many different peppers from our garden like Devils Tongue, Scotch Bonnet, Cherry Bomb and Ghost Peppers.  We have it down to a fine art now!! We like to spread a little Philly Cream Cheese on our favourite cracker and top it with a nice big dab of the jelly! Yum! Highly addictive!!!!

This is wonderful!  Great on crackers with cream cheese.  Definitely will be making more of this next year with all the Habeneros from the garden.  Took some to share at work and it is a hit there too.  I doubled the recipe to use all the habeneros (30) total added and I got 13 jars.  I also didn't have any bells from the garden so I substituted misc other peppers I had.  The sweet keeps the heat from reaching critical and leaves a warm feeling in your mouth. Yummy!

Super tasty, great use for an overactive habanero plant - would use a bigger pan to avoid boiling over in the future.  Once that solution hits the burner it releases spicy gases that are quite rough on the lungs.

Very very easy recipe for someone who has limited experience with making jellies. Definitely wear gloves when cutting the Habaneras - might even want to wear glasses of some type to protect your eyes. Final flavor has a warm punch and pulls out the best in the Habanera - tastes terrific!

Great recipe, easy to make. It was our first attempt at a jelly. I was hoping for something with more heat (it's more of a mild tingle), so next time I'll throw in a LOT more habanero seeds, maybe a little more red pepper for colour, and a bit less sugar. And more habanero seeds. Really. More.

Good recipe.  I cut it in half just since I haven't made it before and it yielded three 1/2 pint jars.  I tasted it right after I made it and it was good.  So far it hasn't cooled enough for me to be able to tell if it set up but if it didn't it was just an error on my part during cooking.  I really like hot jellies with salmon and cream cheese on toast and this one will be great that way.  I left some of the seeds in because I like really hot stuff and for me it could use a little more heat but for my family it should be just right.

Great recipe. It's a hot that creeps up on you but never makes it to the top.  The sweetness, prevents the heat from reaching critical and gives it just the right amount.  Habanero's a the PERFECT pepper for this type of jam.  Makes for a great glaze or dipping sauce. I've tested it on EVERYTHING.  Burgers, Chicken, Tacos and even pizza. You will love it.

The recipe is easy to follow and makes a beautiful batch of molten lava jelly.  It has layers to it, sweet, sour, hot and nice texture from the carrots.  I decided to try this recipe because of all the habanero peppers I had this year from my garden and it is a nice pepper jelly.  I cut the habaneros in half this time because I'm not into super hot jelly and next time I make it I'll cut down even more.  All in all, if you like hot and spicy with a nice depth of flavors then you'll love this!

I just started making hot pepper jelly this year, after several requests for it at our farmers markets.  Lucky for me, I had a huge abundance of hot peppers with which to do so.  This jelly is great, because you don't have to strain the peppers out of it, and it is sweet and spicy.  Great when served with cream cheese on crackers.  It's a must, and I am making as much as I can while I have the produce.  Definitely the best recipe I have found so far.

Excellent recipe.  I threw in a ghost chili for fun and it makes the burn last a little longer.  I put it over cream cheese and serve with ritz crackers, or make PB&J sandwiches and it is delicious!

Little late to the game, but, yeah this is an all star hit. It was so good I've been using it to great success as a pre-Christmas gift this year. Only thing I would say is make sure you're doing all the steps at once. 'Making' the jelly really only takes minutes. I always start with putting a huge pot of water on to boil (with the insert) for the sterilization and processing first. Other than that, in the 'rubber gloves are recommended', I would change to mandatory. We won't go into that life experience here though...

This was my first attempt at jelly. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully.

Been making this for a few years now. Follow it to a T and it works out perfectly. Only thing we do differently is use about half the habaneros and add two peaches diced. This makes for a really balanced hot pepper jelly. Something about peach habanero combo that makes this addictive.  If you‚Äôre gonna add peaches do it in the beginning with the carrots and bells so they have a chance to break down.

Perfect jelly! I use 4 oz jars and the amount is perfect for pouring over a block of cream cheese! Makes an outstanding appetizer for parties! We serve with club or ritz crackers.

Delicious as-is, but my guys asked for it to be hotter.  I'll make again and double the peppers....that's what they want? That's what they'll get! A total keeper recipe.  Gonna go in my Xmas baskets!

This recipe (unchanged) is one of the best things I have ever made. 99% of the people who tried it love it! Only one person so far thought that it was "hot," so maybe next time I will leave in a little of the rib from the habanero to get some additional heat into the jelly... :)

Turned out great!  Very pretty in the jars as well as delicious. I used Carolina reapers (very hot) and added some fresh, minced ginger.

I made 8 jars of this jelly yesterday. Instead of carrots I used 1 cup of fresh pineapples. I tasted it this morning and it's delicious. LOL I promise my friend a jar but it's so good I don't want to share. Hope they like it as much as I do. I will try the same recipe with my Apache & Cherry Bomb peppers.

My wife and I love HOT jelly so I did not seed any of the peppers. I also finely grated the carrot. Great taste and look. My 11 year old son also likes this so it‚Äôs really not too hot even with the seeds for kids who like spicy food. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I could only find Habanero Jelly at craft events, and I don't exactly attend them often. So, o decided to make this myself. This recipe is actually better than the ones O was buying for anywhere $5-8 a jar. Delicious!  I eat this over Ritz crackers with a spread of Cream Cheese to cut the heat. Soooooooo Good and Addicting!

We did it with 8 habs and added 3 summer peaches. NOTE: we don't know if it was because of the peaches that we had to add more pectin (6 Tbsp. powder) The heat on this is intense, but OH SO GOOD!

Mine set up well after a few hours, I used one small box of powder pectin (it looked like there was about a half cup of powder in there?). The flavor is okay, maybe I'm not a fan of habaneros. I'm sure my spice-loving family will like it. I put it on crackers with ham and cream cheese.

If you want to turn up the heat, crush up and include some of the seeds and bits of the white webbing.  If not, just use the orange body of the pepper.  Either way, this produces a sweet, smokey flavored jelly which is really good with cream cheese on Ritz crackers.  Beautiful color.  Good luck!

Wow, this was awesome, I used 10 habanero peppers and 5 ghost peppers, we left the seeds in and ran them thru a food processor to get them finely chopped. We made two separate batches, both firmed up. Just a dab will do ya on this jelly

This is an incredibly delicious and simple recipe with a fabulous combination of sweet and heat. I sell mine at a local bazaar, but also keep enough on hand for my family and for handing out to friends that stop by (they keep coming back ??)  Most definitely worth the time and effort to make!

This could not have been easier to make.  I followed the directions, and the jelly turned out perfectly!  The only change I made to the original recipe (and I regret doing it), was to reduce the number of peppers from 15 to about 10.  I was worried it was going to be too spicy with the entire 15.  I should have trusted the recipe.  My result with 10 peppers was barely any spice at all.  For reference, I like a little bit of spice, but nothing too spicy.  My husband loves a lot of heat!  This wasn't spicy enough for either of us.  Next time I will absolutely use the full 15 peppers.  That will give it the perfect heat, without being overpowering.  
Either way, the flavor is perfect, and I will love giving these out as gifts to people!  A great way to use up an abundance of peppers!

I made this recipe with the habanero peppers from my garden and the heat level was ATOMIC! So I decided to make a batch using jalapeno peppers from my garden and I used celery in place of the carrots.  This batch was a little mild for my taste so I will mix the two to get the heat level that is right for me.

Great Jelly, I only had 9 habaneros. so I added 2 ghost peppers with expected results.  The carrot worried me a bit, but the bitterness is gone with the sugar. I added one more pack of pectin, shouldn't have as it is very solid, but I have bad luck with my Jalapeno jellies  being very runny, so I panicked a bit. 
I like most of you I am assuming do not enjoy the so called hot pepper jelly sold commercially, this jelly is ready for primetime!

This is actually sort of a jam rather than a jelly because the fruit stays in (most jelly has it strained out). I made one batch last night and another this morning since some friends gave me a big bag of habanero peppers. Both batches made 6 jars (1/2 pint) rather than the 8 it calls for.

Tastes yummy, but be prepared for numbness in the lips!

I made this jelly and it was amazing! I only have 1 jar left, and I can't wait until my garden produces more habaneros this year so I can make it again. I'm growing Carolina Reapers this year, and I may try adding one of them to the recipe. Definitely a recipe to try!

OMG, this was delicious and easy to make.  I have never made a jam/jelly before and was surprised how easy it was.  I followed the recipe exactly until you pour into the jars and it worked well.  I did not boil the jars once filled.  I just turned them upside down to seal.  I will serve this at Thanksgiving for sure.  I got 4 of the larger mason jars.  I didn't have much scum once the pectin was added and cooked it for a while waiting for the 'scum'.  Not sure how long I had to cook it for after the pectin was added.  I probably cooked it for about 8 minutes but as I said, it turned out perfect.

Made this with Caramel Moruga Scorpion Peppers instead of Habaneros.
In a PB&J, replace your favorite jelly with the Moruga jelly. It was  absolutely delicious. Sweet with a not too potent heat.

Made exactly 8 jars as advertised. As a variation, I mixed in a few hatch green chilies and a few Serrano peppers instead of the carrots. Gives the jelly a more balanced pepper flavor without diminishing any of the haenaro heat.

I made this for my husband who loves all hot, but flavorful things.  I used 1.5 cups of roasted red peppers that I pureed in the blender, used apple cider vinegar, and included the habanero seeds.  This is not for the faint of heart. High heat and very nice flavor. Used with borsen, tomatoe, and salmon on a cracker- heavenly. Also added to soy sauce for dumpling sauce, fantastic. Will definitely make again.

Amazing and addictive.
I aded couple of other ingredients which made it little loose but I don't thing it changed flavor too much.
I tried it on Ritz crackers with Philadelphia cream cheese and omg. I almost ate the whole jar on spot.
I love it and next time I will stick to the directions.

Made recipe according to directions using exact amounts of ingredients with mixed results. Delicious flavor, but so thick that it doesn't move when I shake the jar. Since majority of reviewers had good results, am not sure what I did wrong...

Amazing!!! I made no changes to this recipe and it is absolutely amazing!!!  Sweet and spicy, but not to much of either, a perfect combination.  It was my first time trying to make a jelly and this was a easy recipe to follow and complete.  Thank you for sharing!!!  I will keep this one for years to come!!!

Absolutely delicious!  Made three batches.  Only thing I did differently was that I minced the carrots and the peppers in a mini chopper so they were all the same size.  I did not shred the carrots.

I love this recipe,I've used it the past 3 garden seasons.It is a hit with all ours friends that have a taste for spicy food.I add it to chili  or brown beans to spice things up a bit.I substituted a few green bell peppers this year as I was a little short on red bells.

Great recipe! I won a "best in class" at the State Fair with it. I used Thai bird peppers - tiny and hot, but the carrot and bell pepper nicely balanced the heat and gave the taste more complexity. Fabulous as a traditional cream cheese appetizer, but also good as a glaze for roast vegetables, pork, or turkey.

I followed the recipe, it made 32 oz. Also the amount of pectin made it very firm. One small change was orange bell pepper. 
I think I need to thin it out and redo.

I made this today for the very first time and it's absolutely delicious! I read some of the reviews first and followed the suggestions on using a food processor, and it was a snap. I also used 6 cups of sugar instead of 6.5 and it's sweet enough. Also, I was somewhat worried that 15 habanero peppers would make it too spicy for my taste, but it is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I was able to fill seven 8oz jars. I will be making this to give as Christmas gifts this year.

we really like this recipe but mixed up the peppers, 10-12 habanero and 3-5 jalepeno so it wasn't quite so hot.  Also mixed up the colors of peppers and must say it turned out quite pretty.  makes for very nice Xmas gifts.

I used green bell pepper and about 12 longhorn peppers because those are what I had from my garden.  The carrots seem to add nice texture.  I have never canned anything before, and I used a hot water bath.  I watched some tutorials on youtube first.  I was really nervous, but it was way easier than I thought.    If you are considering doing this, you probably have more skills in the kitchen than you are giving yourself credit!  The jelly is pretty sweet--I may consider adding less sugar and more peppers next time.  I also used 4 oz jars instead and ended up with 12 full jars with a little bit left over.  With a fresh baguette and some goat cheese, it's a hit!

I made this but didn't use enough pectin for it to set up like a jelly. I plan to use it as a marinade and for basting meat on the BBQ. I think it will be fantastic on wild game.

Followed this recipe to a T and it turned out perfect! Wear gloves when handling the habaneros. This recipe is perfect and this jam is delish, on a bagel with cream cheese or just on crackers. Easy and yummy!

have made this twice. the first time I made a mistake and added the 2 pouches to my 1/2 recipe; it was thick but perfect! I just made it and was careful to 1/2 everything and although good, it is RUNNY. if it doesn't set, I'll use it as a glaze.

This is a great one! Every one loves it! I gave it out for Christmas gifts last year and everyone wants it! I even grew my own Habaneros to make a bunch! I was running into the pectin problem I used the 2 pouches like called for, I thought it was too hard, When I make it again I will use one and a half pouches instead, for some more color I am using a green pepper in it as well! One packet of liquid pectin will suffice and it sets perfectly 2 makes the jelly too hard.

This is very good.  A local farm stands sells pepper jam and it is expensive.  This is so good and will be great over brie.  You can also add it to sauces to give the sauce an extra kick.  It is also very easy to do.

This is a great tasting jelly! For a half recipe I used 8 habaneros. It's perfect, not too hot and not too mild. Yum yum yum! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Amazing use of my homegrown habaneros.  Great over a block of cream cheese with Ritz.  A  neighborhood favorite!

this is a favorite on cream cheese with crackers or bake on chicken/pork

to prevent foam:
1 teaspoon of butter, margarine or vegetable oil, added before you heat the mixture will almost eliminate it. On the downside, some food scientists worry that the small amount of butter could cause the batch to spoil sooner. I suspect this particular group of scientists probably still live at home...
