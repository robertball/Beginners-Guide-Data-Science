So easy, so delicious! You really only need the dijon and honey! I didn't cook it until it was "blackened" like the recipe says, but I did let it caramelize under the broiler. Man, is this tasty! Thank you!

I followed the measurements to the "T"   I did however add a mix of panko and parsley the last few minutes...I love that bit of crunch!

I made this last night. Needs something, couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe citrus? I used stone ground Dijon mustard and honey, like the picture. Flavor was "ok" but needed something else.

Just used the honey mustard that we had and seasoned the fillets with lemon pepper and salt.  Extremely tasty recipe!!
