this was a very simple and good recipe. I omitted the queso cheese though and made my own enchilada sauce for the filling and refried beans. I also used flour burrito shells. will definitely share with feelings and family.

Wouldn t change a thing! Would allow 3 to 4 enchiladas per person at least because they disappear fast!

I made these tonight and they were quite a bit of work. They tasted good but a little bland. I will not make again based on the final result and amount of work involved.

Good recipe but a bit too spicy for me thus the 4 stars instead of 5. Perhaps next time I'll use plain diced tomatoes instead of the Ro-tel and/or eliminate the can of green chilis.

I made it I think next time I will either use a different roasted chicken or use baked chicken. Also I might cut the can of green chilies out.

well no mention of the ROTEL. I think they called it "tomatoes". Need for edit instructions.
