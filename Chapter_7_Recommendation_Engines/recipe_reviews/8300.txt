I made this recipe Christmas Eve.  I followed it to the letter - except I used a bundt cake pan with NO wax paper - just sprayed it with PAM spray and coated lightly with flour.  All I can say is that it is out of this world good.  This is the recipe I have been looking for all these years.  The cold oven start gives it that good crusty outer layer. Fabulous.

Wanted to make a plain old fashioned pound cake and this was it! I followed the instructions with only 2 changes (because I needed to substitute) I used evaporated milk and 2 teas. of vanilla extract. I thought I had lemon in my cupboard, but I was out!  I used a 10 cup Bundt pan sprayed with Baker's Joy.
Put the cake in a cold oven & set the oven for 350 degrees & timer for 80 minutes as instructed. The cake really got too brown, but stil edible. I think next time I will lower the time to 55-60 minutes and keep checking. I think this is a great cake to have with tea or coffee. Hubby raved. His only comment is that he would have like a lemon flavor. Lemon peel would be good along with the extract. This is a keeper for us!

My family loved this recipe. It was very easy to make.I cooked the cake in two (2) seperate bread pans as i did not have the pan the recipe called for.
We ate one watching the football game and I froze the other.It is also very good if you add cherry pie filling and whip cream to your finished cakes. Thanks for sharing!

I couldn't have been more pleased.  Perfect, dense pound cake texture, but still with a light and not overly compact crumb.  Flavorful, with the ideal level of moistness, a result of getting the best of both worlds with the butter and shortening combination.  (I've experienced both pound cakes that have been too dry as well as those with far too much fat, causing them to be not moist, really, but greasy!) I used this for cupcakes and, just for fun, flavored them with pure watermelon extract, then frosted them with "Grocery Store Frosting," recipe also from this site.

This was a very good cake. The texture and taste were like a commerical pound cake. I did not use lemon extract, instead adding two teaspoons of vanilla. I used two loaf pans and it filled both. For one cake, I would suggest halving the recipe next time. I will use this recipe again.

Perfect pound cake.  I love how smooth and white and pretty it is when you cut into it.  Tastes just like Sarah Lee.  I used margernine instead of butter b/c that's what I buy (WAY cheaper) since we go through so much of it, and extra vanilla instead of lemon extract (didn't have any but I know it would be great with it!).  Put it in two loaf pans and baked away.  Mine was done in about an hour and a half, I bumped a oven to watch if the middle moved and then tested it with a knife to make sure it was done.  Tip:  take 1 cup strawberries, 1 c. sugar and one egg white, beat it until stiff and serve on top.  VERY GOOD!  Thank you for a classic pound cake recipe.  

Oh - wouldn't this be great layered in a trifle??

My cake was done at 50 minutes, early as many other reviewers had stated.  I actually checked on it at 35 minutes and it was fairly brown by then so I covered it with foil during the remaining baking time so that it didn't overbrown.  My DH does not like lemon so I subsituted an extra teaspoon of vanilla for the lemon extract.  I was very happy with the results, nice texture and taste.  Buttery rich taste with a hint of sweetness.  Would be wonderful with sugared sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  We finished off a quarter of the cake on my birthday, then froze the rest in individual pieces for a quick dessert in the coming months.

I love it! No more box pound cakes for me! My kids love it too! I halved this recipe and baked it in one loaf pan and it was perfect!  I'm making it again! It's your basic pound cake that is great alone, or with a topping or you could even embellish the batter with chocolate chips, etc.

The ingredients are pretty standard for a pound cake, with the exception of adding shortening in place of a last stick of butter. I don't, however, believe that was in any way responsible for the dryness I experienced. I believe it was due to the unconventional baking method. I did as directed, starting in a cold oven. I set the alarm to sound at one hour, just because I was unfamiliar with baking an item this way, and wanted to check it at that point. Good thing I did! When I pressed the center slightly, it was quite firm. I inserted a toothpick in the middle just to be sure, and it came out completely dry, without even so much as a tiny crumb clinging to it. When I served it at a Fourth of July party, I was grateful I had made 3 fruit compotes, or the embarrassingly dry texture would have had nowhere to hide. I calibrate my oven every few weeks, and the last time was last week; dead-on accurate, so that wasn't the problem. I've worked as a pastry chef, have over 40 years of experience baking, so I'm known for my baked goods. This was not even close to my standards. I can only imagine how dry it would have been had I not yanked it at one hour. It might have fared better at 50 minutes. The taste was that of a generic pound cake, nothing special, but I would not recommend this recipe because there are much better out for flavor and they turn out enjoyably moist. In this case, only the fruit and real whipped cream stood between me and culinary humiliation.

Excellent Pound Cake! This is my go to recipe - never fails - always delicious.  For a different look, I decided to add Wilton food colors to the batter. When making this cake, the butter, eggs and milk should all be at room temperature. I use  3 cups of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I also add 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  This recipe also makes an excellent chocolate pound cake -just need to add 4 T. of cocoa and omit the lemon and almond extract.

I make this recipe all the time, and have for many years. I lost my recipe, so I decided to look online to see i I could find anything like it. I found this one!! There is a slight difference in my recipe and this one. Mine is called "5 Flavor Pound Cake". It is exactly the same as this one, but when it comes to the extracts, I use 5 instead of just 1 or 2. I use 1 teaspoon each of vanilla, rum, lemon, coconut, and almond. Then, after the cake is finished cooking, put 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon of each of the extacts used in the cake. Bring to a boil, and let sugar melt. Pour over the top of the cake (that has been removed from cake pan). It makes it more moist, and delicious!!

This is an excellent recipe. I omitted the lemon, and added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The cake turned out moist, tender and flavorful. I served it with berries and cream. This is my new favorite pound cake recipe.

Excellent Recipe-I've had this recipe for over two years I would like to say. It sits on my refrigerator everyday. I tried this recipe once before and it did finebut my experience in baking since then had taught me alot. I added alot of extra to make this cake a winner; instead of five eggs I added six. I used salted butter, I added just a little more shortening, I added buttermilk as my milk to make it more moister. Everyone at my job loved this cake and it didn't need icing. Thanks

This was my first pound cake, and it tastes great. Baking it for the 1 hour and 20 minutes was perfect in my oven, starting from cold. I followed the recipe exactly except used salted butter instead of unsalted and it tastes fine. Next time I'll try using all butter and no shortening. The lemon extract I used was VERY old, but still tastes good. I think next time I'll try all vanilla to see if we like that better or not. We'll be using this with sugared strawberries and cream.

I've never made a pound cake before but was looking for something creative to bring to work and the pound cake fit the bill (using it in a fruit trifle).  I followed the instructions and cooked it for 70 min instead of 80 - it was perfect.
I substituted cherry extract for the lemon and added finely chopped glace cherries - yummy!  I'm already planning the next one, with orange extract and orange peel, with an orange glaze.
I never knew pound cake was so easy to make!

Irresistibly good. Everyone loved it and raved.  People who don't eat seconds got seconds.   I followed this recipe very closely.  I often feel that pound cakes fall short of my memories.   This cake was all I remembered pound cake to be and more.   I struggled with putting the vegetable shortening in this batter.   I only used this recipe because it was close to a recipe I already started measuring out, when I realized it had no leavening and I lost confidence and went looking for another with baking powder.  This one worked but I didn't like the idea of shortening in my pound cake.    I wanted all butter but I added the 1/2 cup shortening.   All I can say is that it is perfect.   Whatever the shortening adds,  the cake must need.   The crumb was dense but somehow fluffy and light at the same time- probably from beating the sugar and butter for 10 mins.   I used 2 loaf pans.  Next time,  I am going to buy a flat sided tube pan just to increase the ratio of top crust because the top crust is that good- I think because of the cold oven.    Someone said it taste like Sara Lee (which I despise and can't even eat) but mine didn't at all. There is NO comparison. The only thing I changed was with the flavoring.   I wanted to try out my new Princess Cake flavoring from King Arthur so I used 2 tsp of that (rather than lemon) plus a tsp of vanilla paste.   I don't think it made much difference.  I topped mine with a browned butter lemon glaze which I would do again too.

Awesome!My first time baking a pound cake. After reading other reviews I made the following changes: in place of lemon flavoring I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. I baked cake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes then dropped oven temperature down to 300 degrees and continued baking for about 37 minutes. Top crust was brown  , but not too brown like other bakers mentioned and cake was cooked through. Cake was moist and delicious. Now I need and searching for the perfect glaze. Not that it needs it. Tastes great with strawberries and cream.

I skipped the wax paper.  I just sprayed the pan with non-stick cooking spray and then sprinkled it with sugar.  It was great!  It added some texture to the crust and made it sparkle!  Very good!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any lemon extract on hand, so I used a teaspoon of lemon zest instead.  It came out great!  I agree with other reviewers that it didn't take a full 80 minutes to bake.  Thankfully I checked it at around 70 and it was perfect.. brown crunchy crust and moist on the inside.  Will definitely make this again!

Amazing cake!  Beautiful inside and out.  Smooth, moist texture.  Make sure you sift the flour, makes a huge difference.  The only thing I did not like was that I could taste the shortening a lil more than I would like, although my husband didnt notice it.  Next time I will cut back on the shortening and add a lil more butter.  I also did double vanilla instead of lemon extract.  I cooked it in a bundt pan in a cold oven for 1 hour then turned the oven off and let it stay in for another 15 minutes.  Was perfect!  Cant wait to make it again!

I really didn't know how to rate this pound cake recipe. The taste is the BEST I have ever had BUT as far as winning a beauty contest this one would NOT......I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it is by far the very best tasting pound cake I have ever had. It would be great for making trifles for the holidays or for serving topped with fruit. The big drawback was that it will over brown way before it is baked through, even though I put parchment paper over the top about 1/2 way through the baking process. It is not a high rising cake either but its great redeeming factor is the fabulous taste and texture......very basic and old fashioned...not over sweet or too light....as Goldilocks might say..."It was Just Right"

This recipe was the recipe I was looking for. Great taste,texture and moisture.I fold in the flour and milk rather then using the mixer,that allowed for the air and fluffiness that was in the egg,sugar and butter/shortening to remain.

I made this for Easter and have to say it was a hit with the family! The only change I made was to increase the sugar to 3 cups... Will make this again and try different extracts:) it had an amazing crust and the crumb was perfect! I made the vanilla glaze on this site to top it... Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a fabulous recipe! I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x5 loaf pan. It also only needed to bake for an hour. Other than that I made it according to the recipe, and it turned out fantastic. Like others have said, the texture is light and airy like a commercial cake. Amazing!

Delicious, yummy, perfect!!!! I will definitely be using this recipe again and again. Great flavor and great texture. My husband and I like to eat our pound cake plain ( No strawberries, whipped cream, frosting,  and/or glaze) and it was absolutely perfect. After reading the reviews, I only used 1/2 teaspoon lemon and  1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, but I think it would have been okay with the suggested measurements. I think that decision is based solely on if you like lemon flavor in cakes or not. Saving this on! Five stars!

very good taste and texture.  However i don't know what I did wrong.  It burns on crust.  Next time I have to adjust the temparature.  It might be because of my oven.  Suggest to set the time to 40 minutes for the first check

This was a wonderful pound cake.  A co-worker was asking for a pound cake so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I followed the recipe exact except I used a silicone bunt pan that I coated with the Wilton Cake Release I use when I bake regular cakes.  I thought this was one of the most wonderful and moist pound cakes ever.  I enjoyed the lemon extract and I think I'll try almond next time as almond is my favorite.  I thought the batter was a bit much, but it filled the pan when baking perfectly.  It's a keeper.

Very nice pound cake.  Although I will say, I LOVE Sarah Lee pound cake and it does not taste like Sarah Lee; but still good. I used all butter in place of shortening.  Also omitted lemon and added more vanilla.  The cooking time was perfect (as long as you are using a 10 in loaf pan).  Makes a lot, so make sure there are plenty of people around to eat this pound cake!

I was out of ingredients I usually make my pound cake with and searched AR for a different recipe.  I chose this one  but was disappointed.  I followed it to the letter except it tested done  at 70 minutes instead of 80.  After cooling for an hour, I removed from the parchment lined tube pan.  It basically fell apart.    My family did not not like the taste and texture as well as other recipes.  I sliced  and crumbled it up and am now toasting it.  My husband will eat anything that is toasted.  I  was disappointed in the results and will not try this again.  I see this recipe a lot in cookbooks and  thought that it would be a good one.  It was not our taste preference but the texture was the most disappointing of all.  I needed it for a charity  donation so now I have to make another one.  Will make a trip to store and make my recipe.  Sorry to all of you who love it but taste is an individual preference.

Best, most moist pound cake I've ever had.  Crust was beautifully crunchy, middle was very light and perfect lemon/vanilla flavor.  Be sure to mix the cream as long as it says; incorporating air is key to keeping the cake moist.  I didn't use parchment/wax paper, and I used a bundt pan.  I also didn't need the full 1 hour 20 minutes (cooking at ~4800 ft altitude).  I couldn't wait the full 3 hours of cooling; I had my first piece an hour after it came out of the oven.  Man, oh man, was it delicious!

I baked this cake for 70 minutes and it came out looking wonderful.  The toothpick came out clean.  When I went to take it out of the pan, I found that it had fallen.  I am certain that I added the baking powder.  I do a lot of baking and have never had a cake fall before.  When we cut into the cake 5 hours later, it looked uncooked in the center.  Couldn't figure this one out.

I wasn't very fond of this cake..It didn't have much flavor, it wasn't moist, and the baking time was WAY off. My cake kinda burnt. All in all, wasn't a favorite. Could have been my baking..Sorry.

Followed directions to the letter, except I used a bundt and loaf pan and baked for 45 minutes.  This is my new go to simple pound cake. It has been all the rave at my church. Absolutely love how the flavors burst in your mouth. This cake is so moist that it's hard to believe it's a pound cake. Will be making this pound cake for more functions.

Amazing recipe! I did use cake flour instead of all purpose, I also omitted the salt and used butter, and I used 2tsp of lemon extract and 1tsp of vanilla. My family could not get enough. There's so many different variations you can make with this recipe. Thanks for sharing:)

I've made this cake so many times.  I've added fresh lemon juice and have made it in flavors (adding cocoa to make a chocolate cake).  This is a perfectly good pound cake and if you follow the recipe perfectly it will come out great.

I have, however, started using self-rising flour versus the all-purpose plus the other ingredients out of pure laziness and it hasn't made a difference.

Other than that, it has been a great cake to make when I need to take a pound cake for my contribution to the dessert table.

I absolutely loved this pound cake.  I've tried many "homemade" recipes and they all seemed flat tasting by comparison to this one.  It was the perfect blend of great texture and sweetness.  I made a lemon glaze for the top but this would be fine without it.  This will be part of my permanent repertoire for parties, gift-giving and just for me.  Just one minor comment -- the cake got very dark towards the end of baking and I thought it might burn if I left it in the oven recommended time.  So for the last 15 mins. I turned down my oven to 300.  (My oven runs hot sometimes so this might have been the problem.)  It wasn't burnt at all and tasted wonderful.  Thanks for yet another fabulous basic recipe.

Haven't tasted it yet, but it sure looks ugly! I've done a lot of baking in my life, but this cake totally fell! I followed the directions exactly, but about half an hour after I pulled it out of the oven, the whole middle of the cake caved in on itself and it looks horrible!  I'm sorry, this might taste really good, but I don't think I want to serve this to anyone! (And drat the luck, I was supposed to take this over to my boyfriend's house tomorrow!)

For an honest review...I have tasted better...the cream cheese pound cake is a better quality cake than this one. I could actually taste the shortening in this cake. The consistency was great. I enjoyed the crunchy top. Not one I will add to my recipe box or make again....Sorry

Super yummy! I omitted the lemon (didn't have any) and was generous with the vanilla. Also, I only baked for about 50-55 minutes.

I made this for a pre-thanksgiving pot-luck at work and my co-workers said they loved it.... I didn't really eat any because we had so much other stuff to eat and I was full..

What I didn't like about it was that it was dryer than I'd wanted.. or shall i said harder...

As this was my first time making a poundcake, I went exactly by the recipe and it was not soft as I'd wanted. Now I know to check around the 50 minute - 1 hour mark.... I do plan on doing it again this weekend to prove my thoughts wrong...

Good flavor but it ended up burning on the top (bottom of bunt). I cut the burnt part off and it was a little crumbly. Not sure how to fix that...probaby will lower the temp. next time.

This is a pretty good pound cake recipe. I wanted a recipe that was tasty but didn't require cake flour, being I don't keep it in my pantry. I didn't have any lemon extract, so I doubled up on the vanilla. I also using another reviewer's suggestion and bumped up the sugar to 3 cups. I poured the mix into 2 loaf pans and toss them in my cold oven turned on the heat to 350 and set the timer. After 1 hour my cakes were burned on the bottom.  We cut off the burned part and served the slices with Nutella on top. Was really good overall, But I don't think it would be too tasty by itself. I will make again as Strawberry Shortcake I think =)

I made a rookie mistake and only used 1 stick of butter instead of two, but it still came out great! Now that's a good recipe! I did loose some of that buttery flavor so I topped it with a buttercream icing and it was delicious!

Too bad there are not more stars!  This is just like what I remember growing up as a kid.  I used 3 sticks of butter instead of butter and shortening (only because I had put three sticks of butter in the mixer before I realized).  And since my family is not big on lemon I used vanilla and almond flavoring.  I am really impressed with the texture of this cake.

My family and I enjoyed this cake.  My husband said it was too sweet though.  I did have to add 1 stick of margerine instead of 2 sticks of butter.  Also, I didn't have any lemon extract so I used double vanilla.  The cook time was too long for me.  I took it out of the oven in about an hour and it was done.  Thanks for a great recipe.

So so good!!!! I didn't use lemon extract...just doubled the amount of vanilla extract. Also, I scraped a vanilla bean into the mix, which gave it a great vanilla flavor. This cake was gone in one day! Will make 2 next time!

I really like this recipe...reminds me of Sara Lee pound cake a bit. Wonderful texture. I think next time I'll add maybe a tsp. or 2 of butter extract to add some flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Ok, I was really nervous when this came out of the oven (1/2 hour early).  It looked and tasted terrible. BUT, after cooling the recommended time, covering with plastic wrap, and then letting it sit overnight it was delightful!  Great flavor and texture!  The cooking time was definately off though.

I know that it was my oven that made a mess of this cake.  It is an OLD apartment oven, and cooks entirely too hot.  I even turned it down 25 degrees, and cooked for less time than the recipe called for.  The cake fell, it burnt on top, and the bottom crust was chewy (until the second day), and it was dry...not moist like you want a pound cake to be.  But even though my oven STINKS...me, my husband, and son ate the whole thing...we cut the burnt part off, and the bottom crust softened overnight.  I'm sure the recipe is great...and I would try it again, if not for this oven.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I wouldn't change a thing!! I just baked it for a little less than what was written; about 55 minutes, since my oven tends to run hot. My whole family gobbled these up! I'm 13 and I love to bake and cook. This recipe will be one that I use many times in the future!!

This is a comparative review. I also made  Grandmother's Pound Cake II submitted by WHOLEGRAINWOMAN. In this smackdown, this recipe, Country Pound Cake, won handily. Full disclosure, I did make a few adjustments. I added some salt (maybe a tsp.) for balance. I added about twice the vanilla, and when I make it again, I'll cut the lemon extract in half. Also, I started from a pre-heated oven. (My oven preheats so quickly that it would've burned the heck out of the surface.) I set my oven to 325 degrees convection which my oven then auto-corrects to 300 degrees. The cake was perfectly done in 1 hour 10 minutes. Except for the lemon flavor being a little too forward, soooo perfect. Mmmm mmm! Nothing was wrong with Grandmother's Poundcake II, but this recipe had more complexity, depth of flavor, was perfectly moist and delicate, and the crust wasn't nearly so thick and crusty.

This was an awesome poundcake. I didn't change the ingredients at all; I used Baker's Joy in place of the parchment paper, and only baked for 60 minutes. It was very moist, and almost overflowed the bundt pan while baking - don't worry though, it won't overflow, and shrinks as it cools. 

I would absolutely make this again.

This cake is so very good.  Dense, but super light, great flavor.  I used 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup coconut oil.  Also added the zest and juice of two lemons, and a lemon glaze.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this today and it is the lightest pound cake ever. Step by step and it is perfect to a T. Not a greasy or heavy. This will be the only one in this house from now on. No store bought ever my husband said!!! Fine with me. Great with fresh fruit any kind. Thank You for sharing this family secret.

I love this pound cake. I made yesterday and it's already half gone. I made it exactly as the recipe calls (but had to cover the cake with foil about 35 minutes in to prevent it from burning). I've saved it to my recipe box, but next time I think I will cut down the lemon extract to 1/2 tsp and increase the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 tsp because it was a little to lemony for my family.

I followed directions and reviews adding 3 cups of sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla.  I noticed 35 minutes in the top was browning but it was still jiggly.  So I put tinfoil as did another reviewer.  When I checked again and took the foil off bout 50 minutes in, the cake top stuck to the foil and the cake was still wet.  Again it was pretty brown, it took a total of 75 minutes to cook, I am hoping it will come out of the pan easily  I used a bundt pan sprayed with some PAM.

I loved this cake, it was very moist and came out golden brown, beautiful.  I gave it a 4 because I felt had I used 2tsp  of vanilla, it would  have had a stronger vanilla flavor which I like,,but overall, it was one of the best cakes I've ever baked. It baked perfectly in 1hr. I will make this cake again for my birthday, this time I'll use a little more vanilla extract, other than that, delicious,you won't be disappointed.

This was perfect! Very light and fluffy! I used Swan Cake Flour instead of All Purpose flour and substituted 1/2 cup of whipping cream and 1/2 cup of milk! I also added lemon zest mentioned from a previous comment and my family Loved it! This was my very first cake from scratch so my mom and everyone was very impressed. This one is a keeper!

It was very moist I made it for my fathers birthday and he didn't want to share.  I highly recommend this recipe for people who like a plain cake it eat with fruit and whip cream.

GREAT RECIPE!!! I baked my cake for exactly one hour...any longer would have definitely caused it to burn. I added extra lemon extract (I LOVE LEMON), a little coconut oil AND topped it off with a homemade lemon glaze and powdered sugar. So impressed by the outcome. =)

I would give this 10 stars if I could. This is the perfect pound cake recipe I've been looking for. Moist but not greasy or dense. The lemon flavor was perfect. I was hesitant to add the lemon but decided to make it exactly per the recipe. Now I'm glad I did. I have the first huge strawberries of the spring season to go with this cake and dessert tonight is going to rock husband's world. From now on this is my go to pound cake recipe. Thank you so much!!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and it turned out well, however it lacked flavor. I made it again for Christmas and increased the amount of flavoring used and it was PERFECT! Everyone raved about it all evening. I will be making it again for another upcoming event.

It's good as directed or using 1/2 cake flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. It comes out softer. I would like it to be less oily. But for some ppl they wouldn't tell. Maybe it was oily from the addition of shortening.

I made this for a New Years Eve party. I was left with a plate of crumbs. It's a great recipe. I added additional flavorings because I was looking to recreate a childhood favorite. I added almond and coconut flavoring in addition to vanilla and lemon. It gives a very distinct flavor. And it is soooo very yummy.

Excellent taste! I made one small change: 1-1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp rum extract and it gave great flavor. I baked in 2 loaf pans and they are gorgeous cakes.  Served with a brown sugar caramel sauce. Wow!

What a wonderful and tastey cake! Very moist! It's just as good after being frozen for a few weeks. (wrapped in plastic, foil and then bagged) I will use this recipe often! Thank you so much for sharing!

I wasn't impressed by this recipe. I followed it exactly but it definitely did not need to be baked as long as the recipe indicates! Mine was only in the oven for 55 mins (including the time it sat in the cold oven while preheating). The top had a strange texture and the sides got hard and sort of crystalized. I had to cut off the sides because they were inedible. That was ok though, because I was cutting the cake into pieces for dessert skewers anyway. The rest of the cake tasted very good!

I love this recipe! the first time I made a bund cake and turned out so well. the second time I made it in a metal loaf pan but the edges turned out a bit too over done and in the middle there was still a small uncooked spot. Bund cake it is! Thanks. will be making this many more times. I also added icing. so yummy.

This was a very yummy pound cake!  I have made a few from AR now - the Cream Cheese Pound Cake being one of my faves.  I decided to not use the lemon extract in this and added another tsp of vanilla extract instead.  Also used Silk Vanilla Light Soy in place of the milk.  'Iced' it with Hard Chocolate Glaze from AR (as shown in my picture, it was not yet cooled)!  Great combo :)

Love the texture of this pound cake.  I added 1/4 cup of King Arthur Cake Enhancer to the batter.  I made a 1/2 recipe in a loaf pan.  Crust was perfect and the inside moist.  Reminded me of Sara Lee.  Next time I will use all vanilla instead of adding the lemon flavoring due to personal preference.

This was a great pound cake made exactly as given. Next time, though, I would bake it for less time. I pulled it out earlier than directed, but I could've taken it out even earlier. It was enjoyed by all with sliced strawberries sprinkled with a little sugar.

This turned out well. I baked it in a greased and floured bundt cake pan for about 70 minutes. I specifically went to the store before making this just to get the lemon extract (which isn't cheap either!). If I made this again, I wouldn't put lemon extract in. For me personally it was too much. I'd either double the vanilla or try alittle almond extract. I made sugared strawberries and whipped cream for a shortcake dessert on mothers day. It was yummy! I personally think it would taste better minus the lemon extract.

I made this pound cake for my family and it was so moist and delicious. You really do have to beat the mixture for about 10 minutes. I would make this cake again and have already given this recipe out! If I were to change anything I might add a bit more lemon because I'm a fan of lemon flavour.

I made this cake for Christmas.  This was my first pound cake.  It was wonderful.  This is a great and simple recipe.  It tasted like the ones the old ladies at church make.  I baked it in a bundt cake pan for one hour.  I think to bake it longer would have made it dry out.  I did not use wax paper or parchment paper.  I sprayed my pan with baking spray.  It was moist and dense (as pound cake should be).

As close to perfect as it gets! This is the best scratch pound cake period! Not for folks watching calories. I just had to make this for the holidays and got rave reviews. I added a orange-lemon drizzle instead of icing. This will be a desert mainstay for many years to come!

Made this recipe tonight in a bundt pan, also made a second recipe and used a bread pan.  Made the second one because I wanted to be able to taste before i took the cake to a bday party tomorrow. The cake had great flavor, everyone here liked it.  I have always like a dense pound cake, this one reminded me more of an angel food cake bc it was so fluffy.  That is why i gave it 4 stars....when i think pound cake i think dense moist buttery goodness.

This is now my 'go to' pound cake recipe.  I followed it to the letter, and it was smooth and the consistency was fantastic.  It was a bit much for my Pampered Chef bundt stone, so it did bake over the stone a bit, but I will make it again and again. I also make a powered sugar, cream, and lemon extract icing and drizzle it on top of the cake.  It really makes it beautiful.

This is the first pound cake I've ever made.  It tastes great-- it's not too buttery or sweet, but a good, moist combination of both.  I'm using it in a berry trifle and I have a feeling that it'll be perfect! Thanks for the recipe!  I plan on using it again for strawberry shortcake.  Also, just as a note, this recipe makes a heaping bowl full of batter; I filled one loaf pan and one round cake pan.

This pound cake is EXCELLENT!!! I have made about 7 of these within a 2 wk time period. I make them & by the next day, its gone! When I made my first one I used 2 tsp vanilla extract because I do not keep any other extracts on hand. Needless to say, it was such a hit that I make them all like that- I have never used the lemon. To avoid over mixing (I'm really good for doing that) I stop using the mixer and I mix with a fork when its time to alternate the flour mixture & the milk. Placing it in a cold oven and waiting an hour and 20 minutes after you set the oven temperature makes for a PERFECT cake everytime! Thank you sooo much for this recipe. I will use this everytime!

I tried lots of recipes for the perfect pound cake and I finally found it!  I omitted the lemon flavor and used fresh lemon juice instead.  The cake came out perfect and my family loves it!

This recipe is PERFECTION.  I have made it probably 7 or 8 times now and it has been perfect every time.  I use a basic bundt pan.  It rises pretty high, but never spills out.  I nix the lemon extract, and instead use zest and juice of one lemon.  To take it up a notch, after it cools completely, sear it by the slice until golden brown in a little butter, then serve with whipped cream, strawberries, and caramel.  AMAZING!

i give this recipe a four because I got mixed reviews from my family; Some liked it others not too much.
I suggest if you don't want a crusty top dont try this recipe. I also found the lemon extract too strong. However after a few days it tasted better.

Pound Cake Perfection. This recipe works beautifully. I had a perfectly browned, just-dense enough, pound cake in the time noted in the recipe. This one is definately a keeper!

Until now I had no "reliable" pound cake recipe. I searched Allrecipes.com when my cookbooks didn't have a recipe that didn't call for cake flour. This pound cake is not too heavy -- just right for snacking or serving with fresh strawberries.

This is by far the best pound cake recipeI have made.  The baking smell was so good my son was sniffing at the oven door before it was done.  It was wonderful.  I shortened the baking time after the first time to 15 minutes less.. I guess each oven is different.  Excellent recipe!!

This is the best homemade pound cake that I have ever tasted. I don't like lemon, so I added some butter flavouring and it was delicious!!
It make take a while to mix but  the end result is worth it.

This cake's name is perfect!  This is definitely the cake that my Great Grandma used to bake.  It is heavy like an acient recipe.  I couldn't remember the recipe that my Mom gave me so I looked to see if there was one simular to hers and this was it.  And indeed this was great.  I baked it a couple of days ago, today it is gone.  I am finally able to bake my husband's favorite cake.  It takes quite a bit of time, but what good pound cake doesn't?  Only thing is is that I like to really taste the lemon in the cake so I'd add little more lemon to it and it will be the BOMB cake.  Thank you so much Morgan.

Really great moist pound cake. The kind you need to use with strawberries and whipped cream.  I plan to use it in an ice cream cake. I did not cook mine quite as long as listed.

This recipe was wonderful.  It was moist, tender and tasty!!!  My kids loved it.  I couldn't wait the 3 hours recommeded for cool down.  We let it cool for 1 hour and then dug in.  Next time I am going to use 1 tsp each of orange, lemon and coconut extract.  This recipe wasn't a dissappointment.

I made it exactly to recipe. I took it out of the oven after about 65 minutes.   It came out beautifully, then after sitting for a few minutes the crust started separating from the cake (so maybe the cake fell a bit).  Other than that little issue, the cake was delicious.  My husband, who is a pound cake snob, even loved it!! I'll definitely make again to try to figure out what I did wrong this time.

I don't use shortening, so just added a few extra tablespoons of butter. I added almond flavoring instead of lemon, and used an 8x13" pan. Other than these changes, I followed the directions precisely. Very happy with the results!

This cake was very good but maybe I over sifted because I had to cut the top off so I could dump it. However, that gave me some to eat since I cooked it for a friend. I also added Lemon flavoring to the vanilla which made it very tasty.

OUTSTANDING EVERY TIME!!!! This is for "special occasions, memory moments." The Seniors and my family adore it and all claim it to be how they would make it.  DE-VINE,....takes me back to my childhood. My only adjustment is the last 2 eggs,...i whip the whites and fold them into the batter minus the yokes.  Comes out not as dense but maintains its old fashioned richness. Thank you Morgan for sharing your recipe!

Legit pound cake recipe my father would have enjoyed.

I cut the ingredient amounts in half and used a 8x4 loaf pan. The cake was a little short coming out.

The crust was a little crisper and darker than store-bought, which I liked.

Also, less cake means less time in the oven. I phoned it at 60 mins and it was fully baked.

I've made this  cake twice ... both times it came out great!  The second time I added cream cheese to the butter/shortening/sugar mixture ... My family absolutely loves this cake.  They don't want boxed cake anymore (LOL).  

I had buttermilk in the house and used that instead of regular milk .  

First time I made the icing ... second time no icing ... the cake is spectacular without icing.

The first homemade pound cake I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly except for baking in a Bundt pan and adding one extra egg. Some reviewers had suggested that, and my neighbor had just given me 4 dozen fresh eggs , so ...  It"s a very good cake -- I can just imagine it with strawberries -- but it made a LOT of cake -- a full Bundt and 7 cupcakes. Next time I'll do only half the recipe in a 9" loaf pan.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I though the texture was nice for a pound cake, but personally I thought it lacked flavor. It would probably pair nicely with some whip creme  and strawberries or something, but on it's own, there's much to be desired.

It was a hit. I've made 3 times in one week. I just made a basic lemon glaze for it and voila. I didn't change the recipe but I did set my gas oven to 325 and took it out about 5-10 minutes early. Other than that perfection.

best tasting pound cake I have made! I followed recipe precisely except:
I added a stick (half cup) of Blue Bonnet in place of shortening and  I used salted butter instead of unsalted -  I always use salted butter in cakes. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract in place of lemon extract. I did not use wax paper, just used Pam spray on tube pan, and I took the cake out of oven after an hour.  This worked great for cupcakes also, with less baking time of course.

I’ve made a lot of cakes. This one is now my favorite. I usually change recipes. I doubled the lemon extract this time just because I wanted a bit more citrus taste. It was delicious and had a great texture.

A great cake, I didn’t have a bunny pan so used 2 loaf pans lined with paper. Turned out nice and moist! I didn’t add vanilla or lemon extract but added 1/4 cup lemon juice and 2 tsp lemon zest. A new favorite!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for one of our desserts for our Canadian Thanksgiving this year. It was a big hit.   Will definitely make this again I might try a different flavour as I like to experiment.   I did use my bunt pan instead of my tube pan,only for the prettiness.  I don’t normally give 5 stars but this one deserves it.

I didn't realize how labor intensive this cake would be. Good flavor. Heavy cake. A little too crumbly for me but worked perfectly since we were using it for strawberry shortcake.

I made this cake a few days ago. it only lasted two days. yeah, it was that cook. it's a moist, smooth, creamy cake that I couldn't get enough of. I took one bite and ended up with a quart of the cake gone. it was really delicious. my family loved it as well, so they banned me from baking again since they're on a weight loss journey and I'm not helping by making this deliciously tasty cake. I highly recommend this recipe, because this is definitely a keeper.

Love this recipe! I have made this cake numerous times. It bakes in my oven within an hour and i always use my bundt pan sprayed with Pam. Depending on what I'm making it for I will double the vanilla & omit the lemon extract (like if I'm using for shortcake) or, just the opposite, add double the lemon and omit the vanilla for an awesome lemon cake. I have also topped with an easy glaze with lemon extract and it is amazing! That said, making this recipe as written will turn out great! Just make sure and beat that sugar and butter for the 10 min! The first time I made this I didnt catch that til it was too late and my cake was flat, flat, flat.... still tasted good but definately needs the beating! Thanks for the recipe!

My cake didn't turn out as expected.  Although it tasted great it fell while in the oven.  Oven door was not opened so that is not it.  I did use self rise flower (as I always do) so I left out the baking powder and salt but sub"d lemon juice 2:1 for the lemon extract.  Internet said if that effected the recipes it would of made the cake "wet".  That was not the case.  I am going to remake the cake tomorrow using the self rise flower and use the lemon extract instead of lemon juice.  Will post results of that round afterwards.

UPDATE:  Made this cake again but this time followed the recipes, only sub was the self rising flour.  Watched the oven like a hawk so no one opened it and banned everyone from the kitchen.  Once again the cake fell in the middle.  The flavor was really good especially when I added the lemon glaze and let it soak in the cake.  I will buy an oven thermometer to check temps but feel that was not the problem.  I made a chocolate pound cake last week and it was beautiful.

Excellent recipe!  This is exactly what I was looking for to make a perfect pound cake.  The only change I made was eliminating the lemon extract and using 2 tsp of vanilla instead.  It was dense, moist, and so delicious!  The only thing I will do differently is decrease the baking time by 10 min.  Parts of the outside burned, but the inside was still perfectly moist.

This was great! A very dense, filling cake... but not too sweet! I even made up a lemon glaze that added just a bit more sweetness, but still not overpowering. Definitely needed the hour and 20 minutes. I checked it at 50 minutes like some people suggested and it was definitely not done. I ended up taking mine out at an hour and 10 minutes, but an hour later when we cut the cake after cooling, it was still soft. Needed that extra 10 minutes! But I guess it all depends on your oven.

Absolutely delicious!  Only problem I had was the recipe was too much for the bundt  pan and ran over in the oven.  Still the taste and texture was so good it gets a 5 star from me.

I'm not a cake baker, but this recipe was perfect. I made it in a bundt cake pan and the only problem I had was I didn't fill the pan in well with the batter so it created a fissure in the cake. I find it hard to believe that the supposed pastry chef had a problem with this recipe as it could be modified as you went along. I took mine out after an hour and it was great! Nice and moist. You have to know your oven. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I cooked in a bundt pan and had to watch the time because the outside did start to burn.  I think it is my oven though because it runs hot.  My new favorite pound cake.

Amazing! Absolutely amazing! My only concern would be that the cake needed more lemon flavor while the icing needed a bit less. I added a tbsp of lemon juice and a tsp of lemon zest to the cake, and it was perfect. The icing i followed to the T but will decrease the amount of lemon zest next time, but still perfect! Only a matter of personal preference about making the icing less "lemon-ey". Thanks a lot!

This is the best cake!  It's so moist and has great flavor.  I didn't have shortening so I omitted it completely because I figured 1 cup of butter was enough, and it was.

So, this is just delicious, and starting it in a completely cold oven was genius. I read that it helped make the crispy, well browned crust (that I happen to love) yet still retained the soft, bright white moist center that I was hoping for. By accident, I added an extra half a cup of shortening and forgot the lemon and vanilla extracts, but all my guests loved it still. I prepared my bundt pan with shortening and flour and still put 5-6 rough squares of parchment in the dish before I poured in the batter and after it came out of my bundt pan just fine, I will not use the parchment paper as well in the future. The recipe may need to be amended to say "...either shortening/flour th epan OR use parchment paper  to cover ALL the interior surface of your pan." It may have been overkill in my case to do both. Great, bright white cake (despite the 5 egg {yolks, really]). I will make this again, but add a glaze or definitely have optional toppings served with it. I had cool whip and cooked sliced apples on hand, so we served each piece with both.

Amazing turnout and I have to admit I was a little worried about, starting the process in a cold oven, every oven is different, mine takes forever to heat up, and It turned out.  Really moist and it is history already.  On to the next one.

My wife made this and put in a bunt pan. It would not come out without cutting into pieces but it was a great hit. She had 16 ladies come for a book review and they all loved it. She will make it again I'm sure.

Yes I made a few changes. I used 3 cups of sugar and used butter only and not the shortening. I love this recipe.

I made it with the following changes: decreased sugar to 2 C, made a rum glaze (3/4 C sugar, 1/4 C each of water, butter and rum) and poked holes in the cake to soak in the glaze which added back sweetness and moisture, increased salt to 2 tsp, substituted the 1/2 C shortening with 1/2 C plain Greek yogurt, added 1 tsp almond extract instead of lemon, and the also added the zest of 2 oranges.  Baked it at 300 F for an hour and a half.  One of the best pound cakes I've ever tasted!

I tried this recipie for the first ime on Thanksgiving 2015, which was also the first pound cake I have EVER made!!! I switched out the  1cup of butter 1/2 cup of shortening with land o lakes margarine. It came out so delicious... Light moist and fluffy, everyone who tried it loved it. Will definitely be making this again. It was a BIG hit!!!!

I chose this recipe  due to the awesome reviews but it did not work for me at all. I followed it almost exactly (with the exception of not having lemon extract on hand). It came out rock hard on the outside and way too sweet for my family's liking . It wasn't like my idea of a traditional pound cake at all. Maybe it's just an individual taste thing.

I have tried different types of pound cake recipes, but I must say that this was my favorite. It was so moist & flavorful! The cook time was spot on. I plan to make it again tomorrow for the family because they just loved it.

Fantastic pound cake!  Dense, moist, buttery and sinfully rich. I followed the recipe exactly, but made two loaves instead of one tube cake. The loaves were baked in about an hour. I used a hand mixer so didn't beat the butter and eggs quite as long - a stand mixer for the full 10 minutes would probably make a fluffier cake.  It is great nonetheless. Now that I've got the basic recipe, I'll play around with different flavorings.

This was very easy to make and OMG was it good! You don't need the icing. It is very good just by it self, but I suggest a big bowl of Vanilla Ice Cream with it!!
I so disagree with the Pastry chef, This cake was not dry at all. Very Moist! She must have done something wrong.

I absolutely love the recipe! I followed everything to the T and burnt my first one, I set the timer to 1 hour and 10 minutes. Two days later I tried it again, still using a cold oven cooking in 350, but only for 45-50 minutes. I posted a picture with the cake cut and glazed, you will see it came out great and I've gotten phone calls for the recipe! Stored in my recipe box and a definite favorite!!!!  Thank you for sharing!

wow! This amazing pound cake lasted three days! Got it almost right on the first try.I used a bundt pan and I used vegetable oil and a little flour to coat the inside....big mistake on the latter.it was difficult to get out of the pan and broke off when I tried to remove it.next time I'll use bakers joy or something similar.I was skeptical about not pre heating but it came out with a nice brown crust.the taste rivals that of a store bought pound cake minus those chemical additives.I won't change anything and I will make another this weekend and rate it a five if it comes out how I expect!

Read some reviews didn't have lemon and wish they did.  I used the lemon and i could taste it too much. Didn't remind me of a pound cake taste. Everything else was great. Next time I will not add the lemon.

This makes a very good pound cake.  I've made it twice: once using all cake flour, once half cake flour and half all-purpose flour.  The first cake was much better than the second.  Using all cake flour the crumb was like velvet!  It rose higher and was incredibly dense, but melted in the mouth.  I also used two large loaf pans.  I used two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and two teaspoons of zest in lieu of the lemon flavoring.  Both cakes froze perfectly!

This is country good! I was just looking for something to throw together quick and this was more than throw together.  Using the shortening made the cake very moist. I substituted the non GMO sugar for the regular white sugar. Wonderful!

This was the best pound cake I have ever had.  My husband doesn't like pound cake, and he liked this one!  I followed the recipe with only one change, adding 2 tbsp. of fresh squeezed lemon juice as I didn't have any lemon extract.  Will definitely make this again!

My first pound cake ever and it turned out great. I made strawberry shortcakes with it. I didn't have a tube pan so I greased and floured a bundt pan instead, but everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.

I have made many pound cake recipes and this is the best one. The only thing that I changed wad that Instead of affing lemon extract, I added almond extract, it was sooo gooood and moist, the only thing is that it was a little bit too sweet for me so next time I'll make it I will add half of the sugar.

Great pound cake recipe.  It tastes just like you imagine a pound cake should taste.  I did cover with foil at 50 minutes to keep top from burning.  I also used Pam baking spray instead of wax paper.  Wonderful!

Wow!  We didn't even bother with glaze; this was so good.  We did however eat it one day plain and the next with whip cream and fresh blueberries.  Good both ways!  In fact, this lasted exactly two days at our house! After reading oodles of reviews I made a few changes:  I set out milk, butter and eggs to bring up to room temp.  Mixed about 5 mins not 10.  Also warning - Do not use cooking spray, use shortening and waxed paper for bottoms or it will stick badly. I don't have a tube or bundt pan so I used two loaf pans. Would love to try almond or orange extract next time in one of the pans.  Lastly, the tops were very brown; I think I will cover the last 20 mins next time.

This was pretty good, I made a mistake and made a couple changes.  My mistake was I put too much milk, I accidentally poured in 2 cups, after stirring for a few seconds, I realized my mistake and had to pour what extra milk I could.  The changes were I used 1 tsp almond extract in place of the vanilla and lemon.  I poured the batter into a 9x13 and put it into a cold oven.  Turned on the oven to 350 and baked for an hour.  Even with the error in milk, this came out pretty good, in fact, I'm glad I put in the extra milk.  It gave it just the right moistness, wasn't too dense.

This was a pretty good recipe.  My family really enjoyed this cake. I did not understand the purpose of the wax paper. I think the next time I make this cake, I will add almond extract. This was good!

This recipe yields a delicious, moist cake. Everyone loved it. The only thing that I didn't do was sift the dry ingredients. I wonder if that would have given me the fine crumb that I was looking for. Next time I will sift! Excellent recipe.

Great tasting cake! I used vanilla and almond flavoring because I'm used to that flavor. I think i will bake 10 minutes less because the bottom of the cake was a little too dry.

This was great!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly--didn't have 10 minutes to cream the butter and sugar together for starters--used all butter, no shortening since I don't buy shortening, and used 2 loaf pans.  I also used about 3 tsp total of extracts-half vanilla and half almond.  I will definitely make this again, trying other extracts! I think that the 'cold oven' part is mostly because this cake cooks for over an hour--normally you don't have to preheat unless cooking time is less than an hour. wasn't an issue--

This is a good basic pound cake.  I made it for a bake sale and sold nearly all the slices.  I omitted the lemon extract...next time I'll double the vanilla extract.  Thanks Morgan!

Excellent recipe! I got interrupted halfway through making this cake and had to leave the batter in the fridge overnight in a saran wrapped bowl. I worried it would affect it, but it came out just lovely. I used margarine instead of butter and shortening, because that's all I had. Also, I made cupcakes with this instead of loaves. Made about three dozen, and cooked up nicely in about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of your cupcakes.

I made this but like another reviewer I did not have lemon extract, so I just used the vanilla. After it was done and cooled I put on a small amount of vanilla frosting glaze. This cake is moist and yummy. My granddaughter got to take what was left home. Her mother said she didn't want to share it with anyone. So this pound cake was a big hit at my house. The only problem I had was it made to much batter for my bundt pan, so it ran over into my oven. This was my fault I should have relized the pan had to much batter. Next time I will make some cupcakes with the extra batter.

I just made this cake tonite!  Very easy, but. I did make some alternates; I used buttermilk instead of milk, butter flavor crisco for the shortening, and cake flour instead of all purpose flour.  I then made a simple syrup to coat the top after it cooled to help the glaze stick, and made a lemon glaze!  Very moist, dense, full of flavor,taste just like the Lemon slice cakeat Starbucks! great recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made it several times, it is the first thing I ever made from scratch, and people love it! I get requests to bring this cake to family functions, and  was showing off for one of my bosses, and now he loves it too! The only thing I added, was a package of cream cheese(because my grandmother added it to her cakes and they were delicious) and I have had no complaints yet!

First pound cake ever, and this recipe made it a total success! Followed the recipe to the letter, except for subing Swans Down cake flour for the AP. Cake was so moist and delicious, I didn't even bother with a glaze. 1hr 20min is a little on the long side, mine burnt a little, but a burnt crust is the mark of a great pound cake!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any lemon extract,  but it was still amazing.   The cake is surprisingly light.  

We used it for our chocolate fondue and it held together quite well.

I used a bundt pan and it is beautiful!

Superb!  I replaced the lemon extract with almond extract.  I kept an eye on the cooking time after reading other reviews.  It ended up taking about 1 hr 5 mins in my oven.  Cannot wait to dip it into chocolate fondue although it's good enough to eat just by itself.  Yummmmm!!!!!

This was my first attempt making pound cake, and I was so pleasantly surprised at the result. It's a fairly easy recipe to follow, and the texture of the cake is what I am looking for in a pound cake - dense, yet tender crumb, and lovely on its own. I used two springform pans with this recipe - a 7 and 8 inch, and baked them for an hour. I replaced the lemon extract with almond, but otherwise, followed as written. It is worth making, especially for decorative cakes.

Very good recipe! Very moist and great texture and taste. The top has that nice crusty layer. Instead of regular milk, I used Silk Light Original Soy milk because that's what I buy. The cooking time was perfect for my oven. I will use this recipe over and over.

this pound cake was perfect! it wasn't too dense and it wasn't too "fluffy"....it was perfect. i didn't have an lemon extract so i used almond instead. some of the top of the cake (which was actually the bottom because i used a bunt pan) browned more than I would have liked it, but I will simply adjust the temperature of the oven next time. i will definitely be making this again

Very good pound cake. I halved the recipe and used 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. margarine, 1 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar. I added lemon zest and some cinnamin. I preheated because I wanted to avoid the dark thick crust, because I knew my DH wouldn't like it, but I still ended up with it (I didn't complain though).  I did 45 minutes, then covered it for another 25. I will try a different pan next time. Delicious recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is by far the best pound cake I have ever eaten. It was super easy and en-expensive. My whole family loved it along with the guys my husband works with. The lemon extract puts this cake over the top. LOVED IT!!

Another Excellent Rating for this cake!  Apparently, it's almost foolproof - I misread the temp and used 375 instead of 350.  It was browning after 55 minutes, so I removed it and it was perfect and not dry at all.  This recipe is in my permanent library.

You can stop searching for pound cake recipes. This is fantastic.  I added lemon extract to mine along with the vanilla.

I found this recipe a few months ago and have been using it ever since.  This is an excellent recipe.  I had always been more of a cooker than a baker and this was my first try at baking from scratch.  Im not one of those reviewers who is always altering the entire recipe, however, the cooking time can be reduced about 5 minutes.  That is just my personal preference.  Delicious recipe...thanks for sharing!!

This was very good, although not amazing. I followed the recipe exactly. It baked perfectly and turned out very pretty! I mixed 1/2 c. white sugar and 2 Tbsp. milk to drizzle over the top. It looked great, but tasted a bit floury. I didn't love it, but my boyfriend devoured it! It actually tasted better the next day. I will use this recipe again, but I'm still on the lookout for the perfect pound cake recipe!

It was really good. I put in 2 tsp. of vanilla and then added juice from half a lemon. The flavor was great and it was easy to make. Although the texture was slightly dry.

For me, this recipe was quite easy.  I used my KitchenAid mixer to cream the butter/sugar for 6 minutes.  This is the second time I've used this recipe and hubby loves it, so do I.  We prefer a stronger vanilla flavor so I omitted the lemon and added more vanilla.  It's great!  Thanks for another great recipe.

Unless you're making this cake for a special occasion, you can't help but cut a slice before it has cooled.  It smells delicious and tastes divine.  Instead of shortening, I used 1 1/2 cups of butter and it came out perfect.  I was able to make a bundt cake and two mini loaf pans. Once the wonderful smell began wafting through the house, my family couldn't wait to have a slice of the mini loaves - and neither could I! This is most definitely the best pound cake recipe I have ever made. A keeper for sure.

This is a really good basic pound cake. I used it to make strawberry shortcakes. The light lemon flavor went really well with the strawberries! I put it in whatever pans I had laying around in my kitchen. It made LOTS of cake so I froze some for later.

We all really enjoyed the pound cake, thanks for the recipe. We used vanilla extract because we didn't have lemon.

Absolutely Yummy!  I baked mine in a 9.5" square pan, and it came out great.  follow the recipe when it says to put in a COLD oven, and you shouldn't have any problems with overbaking.  If you preheat your oven, or use 2 smaller pans, you will of course alter your bake time.

This cake was very tasty! My family complained about it not being moist enough.  So the next time I make, I'll be looking for suggestions on how to make it moist!

I didnt have any lemon extract, so i substituted it with two teaspoons of orange juice and some orange peel. The cake had a light orange fragrance and taste to it. It was nice, and i think next time i would definately use the lemon extract. I cut back on the sugar a bit, to 2-1/4 cup. I also used regular cake pans, bake it for 30 minutes.  I was kind of skeptical at the beginning, because the sides were really brown and the center was really pale. However, it turn out just right! It was delicious, and even my mother said that it was really good. Reminds me of the old days...my father would buy the entenmann's pound cake.  A definate keeper.

Worth the effort.  I used 1 tbsp of almond extract and 1 tbsp of coconut extract.  Everyone commented that it was sooo moist.  My husband said it tasted like suntan lotion smells. It was great.  Will make again.

To be truthful, it was slightly burnt in 45 min. I was SCARED! It tastes okay...not very sweet though. I am hoping that when I wake up in the morning, it will actually taste a lot better than it does right now because it is not completely cool. I will add more lemon extract, a little more butter and sugar to make it richer and tastier.

My family loved this recipe!  Four of us at half of it in one sitting.  My sister who doesn't like pound cake even liked it.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used a little almond extract instead and it came out great.  Has a very nice texture.

This is a good recipe, but like others have said, it is very sweet. I didn't have lemon extract so I just doubled the vanilla and it was good. Also had to use two pans because it made so much.
