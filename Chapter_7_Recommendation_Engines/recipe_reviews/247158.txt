This easy recipe automatically makes it into our weekly menu routine. It's even good the next day! I used rice noodles instead of udon to keep it gluten free. Next time, I'll try soba noodles. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

My family loves this meal!!  We add water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  We're constantly finding tweaks we can make.  I've made this about 4 times, and it is requested often.

This was good the night I made it, but I enjoyed it much more the next day. I will keep this in the rotation.

Great recipe with overall good flavors. Iâ€™ve made this twice now, once marinading for the 4 hours as recommended and once only marinating for 15 minutes since I was short on time - both tasted similar. I split the marinade half for the steak and half for the veggies. I also added thinly sliced Fresno chili on top for a little kick. Yummy!

I did not have soy sauce, so I use teriyaki.  Used vegetables that I had on hand.  This dish was yummy.  Will definitely make again.
