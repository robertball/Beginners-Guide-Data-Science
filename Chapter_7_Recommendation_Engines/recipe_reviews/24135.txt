I made them with the kids...lots of fun!  But, the recipe directions are way off.  Less cinnamon & sugar.  More butter.  Less cooking time (thirty minutes).  And a bigger pan.  But all & all, a great easy recipe!!

The other reviewers were dead on...this needs more butter!  Go ahead and use the same amount of cinnamon and sugar.  It is not necessary to actually use the entire mixture, but you need to have enough butter so that when you heat the mixture it makes a smooth syrup instead of a grainy sludge.  With the current amount, when the dish cools it caramelizes and is nearly impossible to get out of the pan.
45 minutes is too long, but 15 minutes is too short.  I wound up having to check the under layers to see if they were done every five minutes.
All that aside, they taste wonderful!

These were good.  I baked them in a muffin cup so that each person would get their own individual serving.  I didn't have to bake them the entire time...about 17 minutes.  They were great.  I also reduced the amount of suger a little bit...wanted more of a cream cheese taste.  Thanks for the post.

These were excellent! I was unable to find biscuit tins weighing 10 oz. so since I was doulbing it (we have a family of 8) I bought one of the four packs.  I used a whole stick of butter and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I cut back to 1 &1/3 cup sugar and 3 Tbsp. cinnamon. I cut up the biscuits as directed and put them in a 9x13 greased cake pan.  Melt the butter, add the cinnamon/sugar mixture and stir and cook for a while to cut down on the grainy texture.  I added 1 cup pecan pieces when it was at the texture I wanted and since this thickened it up, spoon it all over the top. Bake for 25 minutes and like the whole family said,"de-lish!"

I had lower expectations of this recipe due to the use of biscuit dough but was pleasantly surprised. This was pretty good (although I do PREFER other pull-apart recipes over this).  STILL-and easy side to breakfast when you don't have time to go through the dough rising processes! I only used 2 cans of biscuit dough b/c they were "Pillsbury Grands" (pretty big) and thanks to all the other cooks that reviewed this before me, used more butter and cooked for less time!! Turned out pretty good and I wouldn't hestitate to make this easy dish again! Thanks Beth!

I followed the diretions exactly. Biscuits piece barely fit in *9* inch square cake pan when raw. 1/4c butter with leftover cinnamon and sugar was too dry to even make a paste. 1/2c of butter made a crumbly topping. Put in oven to cook, at 30 minutes the biscuits had overflowd the pan, topping fell off and caught fire in the bottom of the oven!! Pull aparts were still salvageable, but not sweet at all. Had to mix up some cream cheese frosting before even the guys in my house would eat it. The outside biscuits were hard as rocks because I had too cook so long to make sure the middle was done, even after turning the whole mess onto a cookie sheet to finish cooking.

These were good fresh out of the oven, but reheated they were not so great.  I will probably try these again.  A word of advise to would be bakers though, DO NOT attempt to use a loaf pan.  Follow the directions and use a cake pan.  I tired a lof pan, and it took 45 minutes to finish all the way through.  By the time the middle was done, the top was black.  I re-assert though, that fresh, these were pretty darned good.  I also restate what several other reviewers said about the cinnamon and butter.

to much cinnamon ans sugar mix, not enough butter and 45 minuts baking time almost burned them, they puff up so you'll need a bigger pan, so, add more butter, less cinnamon and use a bigger pan and try baking for 25 minuts, they'll be great...

This was very easy to make however there was just too much sugar and cinnamon.  The next time I make it I will use less sugar and cinnamon and not cook it quite as long maybe 15 or 20 minutes.  The cinnamon was so strong I had to open all the windows in the house and go outside to stop sneezing.  My 4 and 6 year old loved helping in the kitchen with the dough.

I make this almost the same way and we call it Monkey Bread. The only difference is I use a bundt pan and use 1 stick of butter. I own a pecan business so I put lots of pecans!!!!

These turned out really well. I used more butter as others suggested, skipped the nuts and once out of the oven drizzled a sugar glaze over the tops. Thank you Beth!

Go with another recipe!  This is the first time I've ever given a bad review.  The sugar & cinnamon was crumbly and sat on the biscuits during baking, and that was even after lessening the amounts after reading other reviews.  I did increase the amount of butter, too, but the end result was edible but nothing compared to other recipes we've tried on this website.  We'll try another next time.

Way too much sugar and cinnamon! Just need to sprinkle over top, not coat! And cut in at least 1/2 of the cinnamon

I cut the sugar and cinnamon down and increased the butter amount as others had recommended, but the cook time for me was not accurate.  The top was hard while the bottom was soggy.  I removed the top layer and continued to cook until done.  Just okay, I have had better recipes.

This wasnt my favorite at all. It was alright. I prefer the gooey pull aparts, and this was more of a hard carmelized coating. I think I will stick to the same one Ive been using. Sorry

Very easy to make, but it didn't cook in the center.  I even used a larger pan to spread it out and it still didn't cook in the center. And the top was burnt (I'll take the blame for that, my oven is horrible!)  I will make again, but maybe put it in a lasagna pan so it will cook evenly.

Made a few adjustments. Definitely didn't need the full amount of the cinnamon sugar mix. A full stick of butter worked well. The buttery biscuits didn't bake as well as the buttermilk, and next time I would rather have the butter/sugar/pecan to be mixed thru out and not just sitting on top (or bottom, once I flipped it out of the Bundy pan). Love how easy it was though. Thanks for posting :)

Wish I had read the recipe review in advance.  This recipe is way too sugary and  too small of a pan.  Did not like it. Need to be revised.

Haven't even eaten them yet. Do NOT try to heat butter and then dump in all that sugar! I ended up with cinnamon ROCK CANDY and wasted a whole stick of butter too! I will just melt the butter separately next time or better yet, cut it into chunks and toss the pieces of dough with the cinnamon sugar and then evenly disperse the butter chunks in the pan. Use no more than half the sugar mixture too. I made half and it was STILL too much. Also, spray the pan ahead. I think that is just common sense with a sugary baked good. Recipe just needs some tweaking.

Easy to make, and very tasty, the whole family loved. I only had 2 containers of biscuits, but  they were 12oz each, so I still cooked for 45 minutes, I had to run out of the house real quick, and left hubby in charge, wrong move, the tops were slightly burned. So if you only have 2 packs, cut the cooking time. Also, I didn't have an8" pan, but used a 9" round one instead. if I have all 3 containers next time, I would probably use a bigger pan, say 8x13, becasue since the biscuits rise, the 9" was almost overflowed. But ovverall, an excellant recipe, I will have to make sure I keep ingrediants on hand to make often

I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream to get the sug/cin. mixture to be the syrup consistancy and not grainy.  Also substitued Pillsbury homestyle grand biscuts, each cut into 4ths and rolled in cin/sug mixture.

DO NOT USE A TUBE PAN! The butter wasn't enough for the sugar I added, so I added more butter, still not pourable. So I added some water...now pourable! I poured the mixture over my biscuits and baked. 30 minutes into baking, the house is full of smoke! All of the sugar mixture had come out of the bottom of my tube pan and was BURNING in my oven! YIKES! Once the smoke cleared and I removed the pan from the oven, I realized the pull-aparts were not burned. The two kids and I ate them and loved them! Next time, I think I will use a regular baking dish!!!

I used an tube cake pan and positionsed the biscuites upright overlapping each slightly.  I sprayed the pan lightly with PAM first.  I just guessed at the proportions of cinnamon and sugar and adjusted to our preference.  Pecans with the melted butter on top was great.  I checked at 25 minutes and that seemed perfect.  I did not use Grands -- too big.

I just made this for my kids, big hit! After reading the reviews, I added more butter and a little less sugar. I only had 2 tubes of bisquits, but found that this was plenty. I did not add pecans (did not have any in cupboard) but next time I will! These were very yummy, and very addictive!! Thanks for a great & easy treat!

so easy my 3 yr old does everthing but the cutting.  I have been reading some of the reviews on this that the pan is too small.  I use a tube pan to bake mine it comes just over the top. Doesn't go over and I also use more butter if there is alot of the cinn & sugar left.  Sometimes I make a drizzle to go over the top my boys love that.  I give this recipe out to people for a great quick baked item.   We LOVE IT sometimes we even eat it for breakfast.

This recipe caused me alot of problems.  The measurements are not right.  Either there is too much sugar or not enough butter...I don't think I will be doing this one again.

These were absolutely awesome! I wasn't so sure about using the biscuit dough, but was super impressed! They taste like mini stcky buns. A quick zap in the micowave with a damp paper towel draped over them the next day made them just as soft and tasty as the day they were baked. (they tend to get a bit hardened otherwise)

This recipe is so easy I just let my kids take over. They made this themselves for the family on Christmas morning. We do not use as many cans of biscuits though. I found 2 is plenty unless alot of people are eating.

My topping was dry, spilled out over the sides of the pan as it baked, was overbaked.... I will try once more, using more butter, so the topping is pourable and will seep down through the biscuit layers....larger pan, less baking time and they might be great. Hopefully the mess this made in my kitchen (trying to get it out of the pan) and oven won't happen again.

Great recipe but the pan needs to be bigger for 3 cans of biscuits. I put 1 stick butter and that made them more like a cinnamon roll.

Use more butter than the recipe calls for and it will turn out yummy. I make a similar recipe often called Monkey Bread and my family loves it. Oh I cook for less time and use a bundt pan.

This recipe was great!!  Very easy and inexpensive too!  My kids loved it and so did my husband.  I used the small 4 pack of biscuits to make this and only cut them in half.  Took way less than stated baking time more like 25 minutes, tops got darker than preferred.  Will make again for sure.

First of all - YUM!!!  If you have a mouthful of sweet-teeth, you'll love this!  That being said, less sugar won't hurt.  Also, the pan suggested in the recipe is WAY TOO SMALL!  I bought some throw-away pans at Wal-Mart (9" round but about 4" deep).  Definitely a new favorite around our house.

These were ok, the sugar mixture was WAY to much, could have made half the sugar/cinnamon mix and still had plenty left over. After cooking, the middle was sort of dry.

I agree with a previous review - directions are way off. Too much cinnamon/sugar, not enough butter, needs shorter cooking time and a bigger pan.  The biscuits are a great shortcut.  Will make changes and try again.

Maybe I did something wrong with this one. I don't know because I looked at the recipe several times and then looked at it just now and saw nothing I had overlooked. The biscuits did not cook and the topping was hard like a rock. Def will never make or even try again.
