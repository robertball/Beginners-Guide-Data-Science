I did not like this, it was over the top sweet and too crumbly.

I love this recipe!  It's so simple to put together and tastes wonderful!  I do think that one cup of sugar is too much, and only use a half cup.  I also leave out the almond topping.

I made this with blueberry pie filling.  It was wonderful.  One of the best desserts I have ever eaten and so simple to make.

I loved this easy, tasty dessert.  The combo of the butter, sugar and almonds on top made a very nice topping.  I'd make this again for sure!

This is a little difficult to get just right.  It's really easy to end up with doughy parts to the desert. The filling can be swapped out for any fruit choice.  My favorite so far has been mixed berries from the frozen food section (rasberries, blue berries & strawberries).
