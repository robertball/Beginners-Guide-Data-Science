Fast, yummy, and easy.  I didn't use the package or taco sauce.  I know, it is a huge veer. I whipped together my own concoction.  I used McCormick Sweet Mesquite Seasoning and added some smoked paprika, it was what we had on hand and I had tons of it.  I tossed about 2 teaspoons, and a 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika.  This gave everything a mild flavor (next time I will add a bit more if the breasts are fairly large and add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper).  I used 3 breasts and followed the rest of the recipe. If you have the ingredients try it, if you don't use what you have on hand and mix it up a bit.
