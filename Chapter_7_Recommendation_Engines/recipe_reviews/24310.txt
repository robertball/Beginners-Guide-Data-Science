This is a great recipe for healthy eating! Children may not like the nuts. You may try a substitute for nuts or simply leave them out. Adults will enjoy it all!!! Worth making!!

Very good quite sweet and the kids love it. It looks beautiful on the cookie tray. Next time I would add more nuts just because thats what I prefer.

These are hurt-your-teeth sweet and verrrrry sticky but my husband absolutely loved them and almost ate a tray in one sitting! I had to really keep an eye on these in the oven so they wouldn't burn but overall was satisfied with the results.
