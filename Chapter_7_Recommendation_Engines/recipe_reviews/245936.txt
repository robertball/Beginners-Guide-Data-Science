Vegans rejoice!   This is delicious, as good as the best pho restaurant!   I couldn't find enoki mushrooms, substituted  small brown mushrooms, still good,.  Don't substitute the star anise, an important seasoning.  This will be on my menu all winter.  Mmmmm.....

I made this as written for the most part with the following exceptions: I chose to add some broccoli and cauliflower because I wanted more veggies. Even though the restaurants do fry the tofu before adding to the soup as the recipe calls for, I personally don’t like the texture; therefore, I skipped the frying step. If you have trouble finding enoki mushrooms, look for an Asian market/grocery in your area. It’s a very common ingredient in Asian cuisines, and an Asian market will have them.

This was amazing!  Everyone liked it.
Changes I made:
Chopped up carrot in the broth.  3/4 teaspoon anise seeds. Used Shiitake mushrooms because I could find them at the store.  Added snow peas and hard boiled egg to the fixings.

I didn't want to dirty more than the one pot so I cooked the tofu and the peppers with the broth so the tofu was packed with flavor. Also I couldn't find star anise but Asian Five Spice is part star anise so I used that. It's AMAZING.

So very delicious, it is one of our favorite dishes. 
 My bf isn't felling well tonight (NYE), I asked him if he'd rather have PHO than the meal that I had intended, he felt better at the very mention of it.
