A cake that calls for two full cups of three different liqueurs certainly aroused my curiosity! Knowing this would be awfully rich, I chose not to include the chocolate chips but aside from that I made the cake exactly as directed.  I baked it in two 9" layer cake pans, and used the frosting on top and in between the layers. Chopped, toasted hazelnuts and Hershey's Almond Kisses garnished the top. It was a lovely and impressive presentation! Uncertain of all that liqueur, I skeptically tasted a slice before I gave it to hubs to take to the office. Wow! It was much better than I expected. It wasn't as "boozy" as I thought it would be and the three different flavored liqueurs all blended nicely into something really unique. The frosting was creamy and fluffy, almost mousse like, and complimented the cake nicely. Magnificent, different, moist and flavorful cake!

The cake is wonderful, however the frosting overpowers the rich, smooth absolutely devine flavor of the cake. I preferred this cake with a simple dark chocolate glaze or plain whipped cream.

I made two of these cakes. Put one in the freezer. As it was said, its a rich cake. Actually too rich to enjoy. If I had it to do over I would leave out the chocolate chips. They are not needed and they were just too much! Something bland should be served with this cake such as dream whip or whipped cream with very little sugar or a bit of icecream to cut some of the chocolate. Actually I was somewhat dissappointed that after a great meal it was just too rich to enjoy.

A truly exceptional and decadent cake!  I didn't have enough hazelnut liqueur so I made up the difference with amaretto.  This is so rich and chocolately--and that frosting!  I nearly swooned every time I lifted the cake cover.  Fabulous--(and it does indeed freeze very well.)

i made this cake for the office st. paddy's potluck, using 1 cup of bailey's irish cream instead for the occasion.  i thought it might turn out too sweet since bailey's is a bit sweet to begin with but it turned out just fine.  i baked it in a 10 inch pan and it took about 50 minutes.  you can definitely tell there is liquor in the cake, and i think that's what everyone loved about this!

Wonderful cake recipe!  Loved the flavor.  Didn't have the coffee liqueur so I used a 1/2 cup strong coffee. And went with a Cream cheese Irish Cream icing.
8 ounces cream cheese , at room temperature 
4 tablespoons butter , at room temperature 
3 cups powdered sugar
4 tablespoons  Irish Cream 

Added some chocolate shavings on the top and served with whole strawberries...DEVINE!!!!
