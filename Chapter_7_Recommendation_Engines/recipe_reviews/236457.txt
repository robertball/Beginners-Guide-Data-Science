I am making the recipe for the second time, it is a family favorite! All four kids keep asking for it. I followed the recipe but added chocolate morsels ( I used half a bag) and mixed it with the cream cheese and it was incredible! Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe to the tee. It turned out absolutely delicious. The only thing I will say is that mine rose a little more than I've traditionally seen. Nonetheless, wonderful!

I made this cake for a neighborhood cookout.  While I was talking with some friends, I saw a little boy steal 3 pieces before the dinner was ready.  How he ate that much of this rich cake, I do not know but his mother must be dealing with a tummy ache about now.  It is a great cake and everyone loved it.  I will absolutely make this again.

I made this recipe following the directions almost exactly. The only thing that I did differently was that for the topping I whipped my cream cheese separately from the other ingredients for about 5 minutes on medium speed. This made the cream cheese a bit fluffier and make for a very flakey, buttery crust! Also, I think the cake is plenty sweet without adding the powdered sugar to the top after cooling. I left that part out and wasn't disappointed. I think if I had added the powdered sugar to the top it would have been just a bit to sweet. Other than those few adjustments, GREAT recipe! My family loved it and I am making another tonight.

I have a different recipe for this cake.  However, the other recipe has an after-taste that I didn't enjoy and I had a real problem with the measurements!  So I looked for a recipe with different measurements that would accommodate what I could find at the store but also tastes good!    This recipe fit the bill to a T!  I was a little skeptical at first but I'm glad I followed the exact recipe!  I'm completely satisfied and happy with the results!  Even though i did not top the cake with extra sugar - its not needed!  I still give it 2 thumbs up!

Turned out fantastic. Cut Down on the amount of sugar and still turned out great. 4 1/2 cups is better than 1.7kg of sugar :-))

My mom use to always make this growing up. Her recipe mixes everything together, not making 2 layers as the recipe calls for and also sprinkles a lot of powdered sugar on top. I stuck making it exactly how the recipe calls for it, but the way my mom did is so much better. It's creamier. Everyone loved it though. When people see it for the first time they aren't sure they'll like it, but one bite and they are in love. This is a great recipe to keep!

I bought 3 -13 by 9 inch cake pans, the stainless with stainless lids. I made cakes in them and gave them for Xmas presents to married  grandkids. One cake was this ooey gooey cake made with a lemon cake mix.  My granddaughter and her family went crazy over it and wanted the recipe. My daughter wants it also
, needless to say this will become the dessert for get togethers.

I've made it several times. I add different flavorings to mine. I've put vanilla in the base and lemon extract in the topping. Or coffee extract in the base and rum flavoring in the top. Or lemon in the base and lemon zest in the topping. All are loved by who I make it for.

Okay, I should really have two reviews. One for me, and one for my guests. My guests are inevitably over the moon for this cake! Even my totally health-conscious friends absolutely love it. I have also brought it to parties, and the general consensus is that it is fantastic! I went to a party with an unbelievable spread of all kinds of fab food, and this was the first thing gone. Which amazed me, frankly, because I honestly find it cloying and  devoid of all nuance. I call it my "white trash cake." It is super easy to make, and such a crowd pleaser, that I will probably make it over and over. But...ick! Sorry St. Louis, just not loving it.

This was delicious!  I added slices of strawberries on top before adding the powdered sugar...everyone loved it even more!  The strawberries provided a nice tang that helped cut back some of the sweetness overload. Easy recipe to follow and my family wants me to make this all the time now.  :)

This is such a great, easy recipe!! NO ONE can say no to a bite of this cake! My boyfriend's mom had made it once years ago and told me how easy it was but I never wrote down the recipe... So happy to have found it!! Great for big gatherings.

So good! I made this for my son's engagement party this past weekend and it was gone in 30 minutes, I will be making  this again and again. So easy and you can cut into 2"x 2" pieces for a buffet dessert tray or larger. So rich and gooey but it's addictive you want more and more! The crust was kind of sticky so I wet my fingers slightly and just pressed it in the pan, and then I just stirred the rest of the ingredients by hand and poured over the crust. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature so it mixes with the eggs better for topping.

This was ok. I had high hopes for it. My bottom was very dry. I'm not sure if it's something I did wrong or what, but it was not as gooey as I was hoping for. The top was really good though.

with a couple of minor changes, these were good.  The Duncan Hines brand cake mixes still make them in the stated size for this recipe.  I used a butter flavored one, and this made for a nice tasting bottom layer.  I did however add a tsp of vanilla extract to the cream cheese layer; otherwise I thought it might be a bit bland and I'm glad I did.  Since these are not a very 'pretty' looking bar on top, the dusting of confectioner's sugar can cover those cosmetic flaws :) and make for a pretty presentation.  easy recipe, and they go over well.  I found they tasted best served more on the chilled side.

I've made it several times (usually a triple batch) for large church dinners.  Always a big hit!  I do cut back on the powdered sugar on top.

It was just okay. Not gooey at all. By the time the top browned, I think the cake dried out.  I won’t make again.

This was a nice and easy dish to bring to a neighborhood block party. I recommend going by other reviewers and add a 1/4- 1/2 bag of chocolate chips. Definitely gave it a great flavor

I was using it in a German Chocolate cake between the layers so I had enough coconut in the outside frosting, and omitted it here.  It was delish as a straight chocolate cream cheese filling/frosting.

Definitely bake the cake first  for 15 minutes b4 adding the cream cheese layer... it helps make the cake part not so soggy!

I made this tonight. My Grand daughter asked me to "buy it again soon", as she was eating it. I used a bit more than 1/2 of the powdered sugar called for and am happy that I did. Everyone liked it.

Don’t know if it was my oven or what (quite possible) but I had to cook it for 20 extra minutes to get it to ‘set’ in the middle (cook through).  Only thing I changed was ‘add-ins’ (chocolate and toffee bits) in the cream cheese layer.  I didn’t know St. Louis laid claim to this; we’ve been making this or variations of it for at least 50 years.  Easy, quick, and delish.  Thanks for a great recipe and a trip down memory lane.

Although it is absolutely delicious as written, I had to cut back on the powdered sugar in the recipe.  Even so, the  cake was still great...moist and delish!

I followed the recipe exactly and also threw in half a bag of chocolate chips. The chips really made it perfect. My weird family thinks it's too sweet, but that's ok. More for me! It really seems more like a blondie a day or two after it's made.

I have made this cake many times, by different chefs, and found that this recipe did not do as good a product as others. Eatable, but a bit on the "sloppy" side.  I also found that I had to bake it another 10 minutes so the "top" was not so jiggley!  I will make this again, but will use only one egg in the topping instead of two.  Even tho it was jiggly, everyone who had a piece still loved it.

I made this at my husband's request as he had it years ago and had a hankering. Since he was also craving something cinnamon-y, I made a few tweaks: I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar along with 1 Tbsp of cinnamon to the cake mix batter. I also cut the powdered sugar to 1.5 cups (after other reviewers mentioned it was very sweet) and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. He said it was delicious but I felt like there was still something missing... as long as he liked it!

I will say it was Ooee Gooey!  I might give it one more try and use a foil pan as it did not pull away easily or cut into squares easily.  I would use less confectionary sugar as well.  The cream cheese top forms a crust and makes it difficult to know if it is completely baked.  The taste wasn't bad, just a tad too sweet.  Definitely sticky.

Made exactly as listed, plus some mini chips on top! delicious, but devilishly sweet! Next time, I think I'll add some lemon, or other flavor for a change.

Nothing 'wrong' with this recipe but too sweet for my taste.  I'm serving it today for Easter dinner and have put fruit on top which I think will soothe the sweetness.  If I were to make it again, I would def cut back on the  amount of powdered sugar.

I made it exactly and it was okay. It reminded me of Pumpkin Delight but didn't taste as festive. it is very ooey gooey, but the yellow cake part was quite dry. It was better refrigerated overnight.

Make this Gluten Free :)
Ok after second attempt I perfected it and everyone was crazy over it,I will say first time was ok but second time the only change I made is that I used salted butter (great value brand, we usually cook with unsalted to eat healthier but figured a dessert didn't have to be healthy and that it might add flavor and it did) we also used Watkins baking vanilla the second time around. Oh and mine was gluten free and tasted amazing,used gluten free cake mix,no one could tell at family event so this would be a good recipe to give to someone who can't have gluten!

Very good cake.  Rich buttery and moist, reheats easy in microwave and taste like it did right out of the oven.  Will be making this one again.

I have made this cake before using a butter flavor cake mix. I took it to a birthday potluck at work it was devoured and the birthday cake from the bakery was still left! That's how delicious it is! I just finished making the Ooey Gooey cake for a church potluck,except I substituted a devils food cake mix, a splash of coffee liquor and decided to toss in half a bag of mini semi chocolate chips,and 1/4 bag of coconut for the cream cheese topping that needed to be used up. The cake smells devine,and I'm positive it will be a hit at that potluck like the original recipe was! I also added 1/2 of a 32 oz bag of powdered sugar, as I think it could use a scant less as the original recipe calls for. I will also sprinkle an ample amount of powered sugar on the top when the cake cools. ;)

I have trial and errored many different gooey butter recipes. This one by far is the best!
