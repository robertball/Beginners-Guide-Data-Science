This was my first attempt making stuffing that didn't come from a box.  I substituted dried cranberries for the apricots and it was delicous.  Even my husband loved it and he hates fruit!  Thanks Chef John......

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! It was my first time trying a new dressing recipe and baking it outside of the bird. The sourdough bread makes it so flavorful and the apricots and pecans are a great touch.

This looks great, can't wait to try it.  Especially with the sourdough bread, which I love.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving.  I made it exactly as written except for the quantity of chicken broth.  We just found it a bit bland, so I'll be trying other recipes next year.  To the reviewer who thought it was dry.  Always start with half the broth, wait for it to soak in, and stir. Repeat with small increments of broth until stuffing is moist but NOT wet.  When stuffing begins to clump together you are done. I probably used about 2-1/2 cups of broth for this recipes.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday, and it turned out very good.  The only change I would make in the future would be to add more chicken or turkey broth (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup) as mine was just a little dry, but the overall taste was great.

Made it without the egg and it was terrific. I used half/half sour dough and french bread. Since I cooked it as a dressing and not in the bird, I pured turkey drippings (consisted of 1 stick butter and tarragon blend rubbed under the skin of the 22# bird) over the dressing half way through the baking. It was the hit of the Thanksgiving meal!

I used turkey stock instead of chicken.  This was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.

I normally love recipes from Chef John, but didnâ€™t care for this particular combination of sourdough and apricots.  It was definitely tangy!

I used dried cranberries instead of apricots and added pancetta.   It was okay.  I have several other stuffing recipes I like better.

Like all of Chef John's recipes, this was yummy!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out beautifully.  Next time, I think I'll put in fewer pecans - just a personal preference.

Have made this twice to rave reviews with dried cranberries substituted for the apricots (just a personal preference). The last time, I added some pumpernickel bread that was hanging out in the freezer, and it was excellent.  Chef John is the best!
