I only made one change in the recipe--instead of using granulated sugar, I used equal amounts Truvia (18 packets). I do NOT have an ice cream machine. What I did insead was puree the ingredients in my food processor until smooth, freeze the ingredients until solid, then scoop it out, re-run it through the food processor until smooth and then froze it again until solid. This frozen yogurt was just sweet enough without going overboard and even though it wasn't frozen in an ice cream maker, it still turned out creamy and smooth. I wish there had been more strawberries, as in chunks, in this frozen yogurt. I am planning on making this again once I eat this batch and after the second run through the food processor, I will add a cup of chunked fresh strawberries.

The first time I made this I kept to the recipe but used non fat yogurt. It was too much yogurt and cream for me.  Tasted more like plain frozen yogurt and milk than strawberries. I don't see how it's truly a frozen yogurt if there's half and half in it. I have since made it with just 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup non fat yogurt, no half and half and a bit of lemon squeezed in to taste. This makes it more like a healthy, fruit flavored frozen yogurt (see photo). Sometimes I use the vanilla, sometimes rum (for those that worry about kids eating it, vanilla extract is pure liquor, so if you use one, the other is a valid substitute). A tip: the purpose of vanilla extract or another liquor is to lower the freezing temp of ice cream. If you leave it out you will have a block of ice, rather than a scoopable dessert. Anyway, thanks for posting, this was a nice start for me in making non fat fro-yo.

Great way to use up bulk strawberries. Mixture also makes a nice smoothie. Not too sweet and lovely alternative to ice cream

This recipe was almost perfect.  Just a tad too sweet.  I would probably use a third less sugar than the recipe calls for next time.  The strawberry taste was just right and the yogurt makes it nice and light.  I used a ice cream maker and the consistency was perfect after being in the freezer a few hours.  This will definitely become a regular in my house.

This was the first time I made frozen Yogurt.  I took from other recipes I found on line and added vanilla bean, honey, and lemon zest. I also used somersweet instead of sugar. It came out perfect.  I like the little bit of half and half because it gave it more of a creamy ice cream texture.
