This is good, but a REAL Brooklyn egg cream has 2 Tbs Fox's UBet syrup, 1/2 cup whole milk and 8 oz of seltzer (not club soda!)   I'm not a purist about many things, but this is one.  Pobably because it was a special treat to go to the candy store with my grandfather for an "Eh Cream"  Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

To MB Rogers - I was brought up in Brooklyn, and lived in Upper Nyack for years. For your Dad's Black & White - use this Chocolate Egg Cream WITHOUT the milk, and when it's foaming, add a scoop of Breyer's Vanilla ice cream. On a diet? - then add Hagendaz... you only live once!

Grandma made this exact drink for me when I was a kid. There's nothing like it. Having it again takes me right back to childhood and holding those memories again is bittersweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe so I can remember and also share this recipe with MY kids.

Dad used to take us for black and whites at the Woolworth's soda fountain as kids. Being a former "soda jerk" in Nyack as a kid he used to make them at home without the ice cream.  I now make them as a low cal treat with low fat chocolate milk and seltzer or club soda - very refreshing and delicious!  BTW - you can find them on the menu at Emack and Bolio's in Albany!

Excellent and very refreshing! These are so easy to make that I hate to pay what they ask for them at Johnny Rockets or other such places. A scoop of ice cream wouldn't hurt either! :)  Thanks, Rachel.

Not nearly enough milk for me. I grew up in NY drinking these every day. It used to be closer to half milk and half selter. I adjusted the ingredients, but it's hard to go wrong with an egg cream.
