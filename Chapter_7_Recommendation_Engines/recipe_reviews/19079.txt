This cake is delicious! I took the advice of other reviews and used 3/4 c oil + 1/2 c applesauce. I also added more cinnamon plus nutmeg, all spice & cloves because I love spices. I used 1/2 splenda & 1/2 sugar, and it was great. Used a 9 X 13 pan and cake was ready in 35 min. Topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. Everyone is raving about it -  thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I wanted my cake to look like the lovely cake in the photo so if you do too, remember a bundt cake form is going to take longer than 30 minutes!  Everybody raved about this cake after dinner, I'll make this again!

I have made this cake so many times and it is always greeted with the BEST reviews.  I use a 9x12 and top with Cream Cheese Frosting II (from this site submitted by JJ) and sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar.  I have even made a superb apple spice cake with this recipe, simply replacing the pumpkin with an equivalent amount of unsweetened apple butter.  This is really something phenomenal... I wish I could give it 10 zillion stars.  Thanks Sue

Very, very moist and delicious.  Does not need frosting!  I used applesauce--3/4 cup and 1/2 cup oil.  I added 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger.  My entire family loved it, even my 5 and 2 year olds!  Baked as a bundt cake for 45 minutes, or yields approximately 28 muffins (3/4 full), baked for 18-20 minutes.

Did 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. unsweet apple sauce, also added 4 tsp pumpkin spice seasoning and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Did the cream cheese frosting II with 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin with an extra half cup of powdered sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. I had to give more than half of my cake away to guests for leftovers and promised my husbands co-worker I'd make it for their Thanksgiving lunch. Can't wait to make it again, great reviews!

Moist, delicious cake.  I converted it to cupcakes by just reducing the baking time to 20 minutes.  I will definitely add this recipe to my recipe box at home.

If someone could come up with a yellow or white cake version of this cake they should PATENT it.  I mean, I can only imagine a yellow cake this light, fluffy and moist! Make no mistake, this cake is CAKE, not a heavy, dense quick bread simply baked in a cake pan.  It has a beautiful, vivid pumpkin-orange hue, no doubt because it is subtlely spiced with a mere 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I liked that - it was nice to have a pumpkin cake where the flavor of the pumpkin was so bold and not hidden underneath tons of spices. While I would have loved to make this in a cake pan (if for no other reason than simplicity) and drizzled it with a glaze, cupcakes were more practical for my needs.  I baked them at 350 degrees, about 23 minutes.  I gave them just a little plop of vanilla buttercream to which I added cinnamon to taste. While a cream cheese frosting would have been good too, I liked this combination a lot! I have made a lot of pumpkin cakes over the years, many from this site.  I hope I remember this one - it's perfect.

Instead of making a sheet cake, I poured the batter into 3 layer pans, and made a layer cake (bake for 35 minutes).  I followed the advice to use 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Also as suggested, I used JJ's cream cheese frosting II on this site, and had enough frosting left over to top the wonderful 90-minute cinnamon rolls, also on this site.  I took the layer cake to a potluck and not even a crumb was left.  Thank you, Sue!

I halved this recipe and used an 8x8 dish.  I eliminated the cinnamon and used 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice in its place.  This took 35 minutes to bake (center was not cooked through at 30 minutes).  I used nutty cream cheese frosting (from this site) and topped with a handful of chopped walnuts.  It was SO GOOD and MOIST!  My family went back for seconds!

This was AWFUL. I can't believe people gave it 5 stars. I made it just like the recipe and it was so oily. Powdered sugar turned into a sopping mess soaking up the oil in the cake after I sprinkled it on top of the cooled cake. It is not good as it is written originally.  And everyone talked about how they made it differently in their review.  The original recipe should be removed! Can't taste the cinnamon, really no flavor at all. Very disappointed to dirty a kitchen for this!  I came back to the site to see if 1 1/4 oil was my mistake, but there it is on the website.  Don't make it this way!

EXCELLENT! THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS THAT MY HUSBAND LOVES A LOT OF SPICE IN HIS CAKE SO I INCREASED THE SPICES TO 3 tsp. CINNAMON 3 tsp. GINGER and 3 tsp. CLOVES. BE WARNED THIS MAKES A LOT OF CAKE...AND ITS A GOOD THING CAUSE AFTER TOPPING WITH CREAM CHEESE ICING AND CHOPPED WALNUTS IT WENT IN NO TIME FLAT!

So I remember, this makes the greatest serving size cupcakes ...just bake for 20 min.  For a 9X13, this worked perfectly at 35 min.  Tried with all oil, and it wasn't as moist as using 3/4C oil and 1/2C UNSWEETENED applesauce.  Adding additional spices were also a must b/c without it, the cake was a little bland (a total of 3t cinnamon, 1/2t nutmeg, 1/2t cloves, 1t pumpkin spice).  Lastly, using the Cream Cheese II recipe from this site, this was divine but divide it in half b/c it makes a lot, so that would be 8oz cream cheese, 1.5t vanilla, 1C sifted confectioners sugar, and 1/4C butter with the optional addition of cinnamon.

This cake was yum-yum! It stayed moist even after freezing! I can't wait to try this with cream cheese frosting. I do think ,next time, I will leave out the walnut. Thanx for the recipe! Can't wait to make this for the holidays!

This drew raves! I used mashed, cooked sweet potato in place of the pumpkin. There is very little discernible difference between pumpkin puree and sweet potato puree in baked goods, so I consider it pretty much equivalent. Used 2 medium sized sweet potatoes, microwaved on high for 8 minutes, then peeled and mashed. Added 2 Tb dark rum, 2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I cut the oil back to 1 cup. The last 1/4 cup is unnecessary. The resulting texture was moist, the crumb very fine. I glazed it with a thick cream cheese/rum glaze (4 oz softened cream cheese mixed with 2 Tb softened butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 tsp dark rum, 2 tsp orange juice and the freshly grated rind of an orange) when the cake was fully cool. The cake was inhaled within minutes, and whereas the praise was unanimous, a few guests paid the ultimate compliment of saying it was the best cake they had ever eaten - no faint praise! Thank you for an extraordinary recipe.

Everyone made most comments I agree with, but want to emphasize the need to half the oil and go with applesauce.  I actually switched totally and just added stick of melted and cooled butter.  Also, 3 eggs is really what is needed, not 4.  Increase to 1/2 tsp salt and FOR SURE, add pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe way too plain if you are looking for a "spice pumpkin cake".  Just one guy's opinion but have made hundreds of these and I am hoping this helps you all out around the holidays coming uo.  Enjoy!

I made this with 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of the 1 1/4 cup oil and served it with JJ's Cream Cheese frosting 2. The cake was still amazingly moist, and the flavor was fantastic. Loads less fattening, but still sinfully delicious. One tip on the applesauce - start with about 1 1/2 cups, then strain all the excess liquid off for about 10 minutes to get about 3/4 c of thicker sauce. Gave the cake a nice texture.

Love this recipe! Didn't change anything. I double the recipe and used two bundt pans to make a pumpkin.

WOW! This was truly delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it in a 13 x 9 for 40 mins. It was so moist and had a great pumpkin flavor. I frosted it with cream cheese frosting, but it didn't need it at all. From now on, I'll be making this as a bundt cake with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. Thank you! As a personal preference, I might increase the spices next time... They were light and understated.

This cake is moist and rich without being overwhelmingly heavy. I have made this twice now. Once in a bundt pan and once as cupcakes. Both times I used a cream cheese icing made from a recipe on this site and it has been a hit every time! I did not make any changes but I did not use walnuts.

Great recipe which lends itself to tweaking it for your own taste, which is why i'm giving it 5 stars. I, too, opted to use 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce (because i just can't bring myself to use more oil in ANY cake), and also did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I pumped up the spices as well, adding 1/2 t. more cinnamon, 1 t. nutmeg, 1/2 t. cloves, 1/4 t. ginger, and 1/4 t. allspice. I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes, and iced it with a Caramel Frosting (1/2 recipe) found on Paula Deen's website and sprinkled on 1/2 c. toasted walnuts (omitted nuts in cake itself). It was a HUGE hit! A very moist, flavorful cake that just looked and tasted like the perfect "fall" dessert. I will definitely make this cake again!

10/31/09:  I made this cake again for our Halloween work party and it was a big hit.  This time I presented it like a pumpkin or jack-o-lantern by making 2 bundt cakes, slightly cutting the bottoms of each to make them flat and then placing them together.  I used an ice cream cone for the stem, just added green food coloring in the frosting.  Had 3 people ask me if I would make this cake for their Thanksgiving celebrations!  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

10/10/2009:  This cake was so good! I substituted by cutting the oil, as others suggested, by instead using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce and it came out so moist! I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site although I had a slice before it was frosted and it was so good w/o it.  Will be making it again for Thanksgiving!    Baked in a bundt pan and cooking time was 55 minutes.

I made this last summer, only I adapted it to be a 4 layer cake with a cream cheese filling dotted with chopped chocolate and covered in chocolate glaze. I also added cocoa to my cake to make it a chocolate pumpkin cake :) it was delicious!

I frost this with (Janni's) Cream Cheese Frosting II & together, it's excellent!  If you like nuts, I highly recommend using the full cup.  I've used 2 tsp cinnamon (that the recipe calls for).  I've used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice & I've used 2 tsp pp spice + 1 tsp cinnamon -all with great results.  I've made it with all oil & I've made it subbing 1/2 c oil with applesauce -both great.  I like making this into either a 3 layer round cake (baked 30 minutes) so that there is a good cake to icing ratio or baking it in the 12X18 pan called for, cooling, freezing, then cutting into 6 equal size pieces & making them into two 3-layer smaller cakes.  It makes a lot but freezes well, which I love because I can whip up a quick delicious dessert in no time. Thank you!  This is one of our favorites!

This was VERY good, however, it is more like a loaf than a cake. Kids loved the icing! I added ginger & nutmeg for a more spicier taste.

The texture was okay, but the flavor was flat ... if I tried this again I'd probably substitute butter and maybe some milk for all that tasteless vegetable oil.  I want flavor with my fat calories, darnit.

Absolutely delicious! I wanted to bake another one as soon as the first was gone. :) I also used about 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup oil in lieu of 1 1/4 cups oil. I added an additional 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/8 tsp ginger. Glazed with JJ's Cream Cheese Frosting II, also on this site. Even my mom, who is not into sweets, said how good it was and kept a piece to snack on!

Cut the oil in half and it still tasted way too greasy.  I didn't add applesauce or water, but it might have been better that way.  The extra moisture would have created steam and helped it to rise better.  As it was, even though I cooked it almost double the suggested time until a knife came out clean, it was so dense that parts of it were pudding-like.  There was something wrong w/ the proportions of ingredients.  Won't make again.

AMAZING!!!  I took the advice of many other members and used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce (drained a bit in a paper towel).  I also added more cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  I didn't add the nuts because I don't like nuts in my cakes.  Used a bundt pan and cooked for 50 minutes.  Also used cream cheese II recipe from this site (from jj) and added a little milk to think so I could use it as a glaze.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is outstanding!! It stayed very moist even though I made it two days prior to Christmas. I made it in a bundt pan and increased the baking time to 42 minutes. It didn't need frosting at all and made a great breakfast bread!

I followed the directions about using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and this cake came out delish! I actually made two because I needed a large cake and when making the second one I ran out of pumpkin and was only able to use a cup and a half of pumpkin and the cake STILL came out devine. I was so happy! Cake is wonderful with cream cheese icing! I will use this recipe again!

Love this! It got rave reviews from my family. I made cupcakes (makes 36 cupcakes). I also used 1/2 apple sauce- but I substituted 9 tablespoons of milled flax for most of the oil (use 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil). I'm not generally one for "healthy" baking, but I made this recipe for a family member undergoing chemotherapy so I try to sneak in healthier ingredients whenever possible. It was actually really good, and I will make it this way every time. I also added 4 tsp. of pumpkin spice seasoning, 1/2 tsp. of cloves and an extra tsp. of cinnamon. Delicious!

Nothing fancy, just a simple, quick, delicious cake.  I didn't want to make icing, so I topped this cake with peanut butter chips as it came out of the oven, then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The kids loved it!  Also a great cake with coffee.
Think I'll go make another right now.

Oh my gosh, was this ever fantastic! I made it for a small get-together after my daughter's baptism, and everyone, kids and adults alike, LOVED it. Even my rather picky MIL raved about it! The only change I made was to add 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Also, I baked it in a bundt pan -- I think it took about 45-50 minutes. I iced it with the Bourbon Cream Cheese Icing recipe from this site -- yum!

AWESOME RECIPE!!!  I made this at Thanksgiving and it was a HIT!  It beat out Grandma's Pumpkin Pie and Cherry Pie by a longshot!!!  I added 1/2 cup more pumpkin and it was VERY moist, but I'm sure it would have been just as moist w/o.  I also just used store bought frosting, but still great!!!

Very nice flavor, but WAY too oily. All I would change is cut down on the amount of oil as other reviewers suggested. Otherwise is a wonderful recipe and great cake!

Great cake, delicious! I followed the reviews and used  
3/4 cup oil and applesauce. My in-laws loved it so much, they took half the cake to go! Definitely would make it again.

I have to say this is a very good recipe. The only thing is that is very oily, you put it in a nakin and you can see the oil very well. Also I dont know why but it gives me heart burn and nothing else does?... But the flavor is AMAZING!!!! Moist. I did follow the other users tips on using some applesause.

substituted 1/2 cup oil with unsweetened applesauce and 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour simply because I was almost out of both but it worked and tasted delicious. Next time I will use egg whites and see what happens.

Ok, so I am giving this 5 stars even though I made changes because the only change I made was to change the oil to 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil...I could not make a cake with the original amount of oil.  I also added a package of pumpkin spice pudding to the flour mixture because I like pudding in my cake mixes.  This cake is great! Very moist and flavorful.  I didn't have enough pumpkin (1 3/4 cups) but it still came out great.  I made a bundt cake and frosted it with a pumpkin cream cheese glaze and then dusted it with pumpkin pie spice! Yummy!  Made cupcakes with the leftover and my picky niece ate two cupcakes without frosting!

I cut the rcipe down to 7 servings. Instead of substituting applesauce for some of the oil I just made up that amount with extra pumpkin (1/4 cup). I also looked at pumpkin pie recipes and decided this bread would taste more like pumpkin pie if it had some (1/4 tsp) ginger and (1/8 tsp) cloves. Also used half & half flours, (1/2 cup) white with (1/2 cup) whole wheat. It came out light, flavorful and moist.

A co-worker made this recipe for our office and everyone couldn't get enough of it. It is very, very moist and perfect with a cup of coffee. She used the "Cream cheese frosting II" recipe here on AllRecipes and it was incredible. I plan on making it for Thanksgiving as well.

Wow!!! What a wonderful cake! I followed the other reviewers' advise. I used 1/ 2 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup of oil to cut out some of the fat. I used only 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice for a bit more flavor. Ahh perfection!!!

Wow, this one surprised me.  I was expecting a nice moist cake that many would enjoy.  But I didn't think I'd receive so many rave reviews for what I figured was a simple cake.  I frosted with cream cheese II frosting so it was very similar to a carrot cake IMO.  I opted for no nuts because I wasn't sure of possible allergies but some chopped walnuts would have been great on top or on the sides.  I used 1 1/4 cups white sugar and 3/4 cups brown sugar.  And also took the advice of using only 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 apple sauce instead.  I baked two 9" rounds at 375 for 15 minutes and then dropped to 350 and continued for another 12-15 minutes.  They came out a lil too brown on top because my kitchen timer failed me but were still very moist.  First time using "bake even cake strips" and I'd highly recommend to any cake baker.  They help distribute heat throughout the pan so no hard crusty edges or domed centers.  Made it much easier to decorate since no leveling was needed.  A great Thanksgiving dessert cake!

I added more cinnamon and  a dash or two of nutmeg and ginger - till it smelled right. To cut calories I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I preferpureed fresh pumpkin in place of canned. I lightly beat the eggs before adding them too. Cream cheese icing dusted with cinnamon complimented it perfectly and made for a fantastic presentation.

I baked it for a birthday party where the birthday girl requested pumpkin cake. She and all our friends LOVED it. So moist! I'll be proud to serve it again, thanks for this recipe!

I followed the directions exactly for this recipe and what I ended up with was an uncooked messy mush! I baked the cake for the time suggested and it was nowhere close to cooked! After two hours it was still a mushy mess in the middle and burnt to a crisp on the outside. I will never make this again! I dont know how this recipe got so many good reviews. I have been baking over 15 years and this was one of my biggest cake wrecks!

No adjustment needed for high altitude when baked in a bundt pan.  I added a heaping tsp of pumpkin pie spice. This cake comes out perfect every time.

Made as directed, easy to make but very bland.  Next time I'll add some all spice, nutmeg and a bit of ginger.  I baked in two smaller round pans to make a layer cake and it needed 50 minutes to bake.

Yummy and easy! I thought one can of pumpkin puree was 1.5 cups so tried to cut the rest of the recipe down to accommodate. It turned out fine but took a long time to bake and is very pudding-like. Still, very tasty. We left out the walnuts and added chocolate chips instead which worked very well! Also replaced half the oil for applesauce and made an easy cream cheese frosting, which is great, but it doesn't need the frosting. Will definitely make this again ... and again!

Fabulous!  I add more spices, though ~ more cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, and ground cloves.  I make as cupcakes and frost with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site.  Recommend using 1/2 cup applesauce and using less oil.

Very good and moist. Could use a little more pumpkin spice flavor but still good. I did what the other people did and halved the oil and used applesauce. I also added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice but will add a little more next time. Great texture! I used homemade buttercream frosting. Excellent!

This is a very moist cake. I varied from the recipe just a little. I did not add vanilla extract or walnuts and instead I used 3.5 TSP of cinnamon instead of 2, and added 2.5 TSP of cloves. It is excellent with cream cheese frosting.

This is an absolutely delicious cake!  I baked this on Christmas eve and everyone was still raving about it on Christmas day.  They wanted more!  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted applesauce (I had cinnamon applesauce on hand ;o) for part (1/2 cup) of the oil.  I also added cloves, nutmeg and a dash of ginger.  I also used cream cheese frosting (recipe on this site).  YUM!!!  It's good with butter smeared on too.  Thank you for this GREAT recipe!

This has to be the BEST cake I've ever made!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and I added nutmeg and cloves.  I also used the optional walnuts which were great!  Like other reviewers, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (except I only used 1 package of cream cheese like reviewers of that recipe suggested).  The cake was so moist and fluffy and delicious!  Oh, and I used a 9x13 pan and cooked it for 40 mins at 350 degrees and it was perfect!  Thank you!!!

This was very moist, very tasty and not overly sweet. I replaced half the oil with applesauce and it didn't affect the texture at all! I was in a hurry so I made it in a bundt pan and used canned cream cheese frosting that I melted in the microwave for 30 seconds and poured as a glaze over top.

Very nice. I too subbed applesauce for most of the oil. I used about 3/4 C applesauce and filled the cup the rest of the way with the oil.

I did not have non-expired baking powder(whoops)so I eliminated the powder, baking soda and salt and used self-rising flour instead.

I like things on the sweet side so next time I will add a glaze or a frosting.

I also made it in a bundt pan - in my oven it needed to cook for about 65 minutes.

Very nice - I think I will make this for Thanksgiving for a change from the same old pumpkin pie.

Delicious!  I took this over to my sister and brother-in-law's for dessert with Sunday dinner and it was a huge hit!  Very moist, with a rich pumpkin flavor!  Like other reviewers suggested, I used applesauce in place of some of the oil; I used 3/4 C applesauce to 1/2 C oil.  I followed all other measurements pretty closely until I got to the spices.  I like my pumpkin cake heavily spiced, so in addition to the cinnamon I also added 1 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. cloves, and a pinch of ginger.  After adding these I thought it still needed a bit more so I added about 1 t. pumpkin pie spice.  The end result was great and topped with cream cheese frosting it was a perfect fall dessert!

This is a wonderful recipe! I made mini cupcakes instead of one big cake, and baked them for 12-13 minutes. I also added a dollop of sour cream for the right texture and moisture. I topped them with a classic cream cheese frosting. They turned out perfect and I received a ton of compliments!! I will be making this again.....and again!

I made this the other day for a small get together and everyone loved it- they couldn't get over how moist it was. I had to use a 9x13 pan so ended up cooking it for about 40 min. but I think my oven runs cool. I placed tinfoil over the top for the last 10 min to cut down on browning and it turned out great, topped with a light layer of cream cheese frosting. A keeper for sure!

I followed directions,except added more cinnamon,cloves and allspice for a real pumpkin flavor. Made it in 3 8" cake tins/probably next time use my 9" and only 2. I took the tops off to make it flat (had to eat the tops!!!) then I made whipped cream and made a layer cake with the cream. So very light, it is almost impossible to stop eating! Oh,yes, I dusted the top of the whipped cream with cinnamon...I actually had enough to make a layer cake with the flat layers , and another cake with the extra 8" spilt!! Everyone wants the recipe!

Delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and it was terrific and moist. I also used three teaspoons of my spice blend (it contains cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice and nutmeg) instead of the cinnamon.

This really is a delicious cake!  I have been making the pumpkin bundt cake using the yellow cake mix for years, and this one is a hundred times better.  The cake taste more like pumpkin, more moist, but yet has that heavier homemade density.  
I followed a couple of others advice and Put 3/4 cup of oil in and added a half a cup of applesause to suppliment the rest of the oil.  I also added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice for more of a pumpkin pie taste.  
I made this for some friends that came over and the house got very quiet....and then the ooOOoos :)...this, of course, made me happy!  Thanks Sue for submitting!

So moist and a wonderful flavor!  Everyone loved it although they all thought it was carrot cake until I told them it was pumpkin.  So yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly except I baked at 325 because I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  It makes approximately 26 cupcakes and I used my personal buttercream frosting with 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Everyone LOVED them.  They were really moist and the flavor was great.  I hate to say it but they really didn't even need my frosting!

AMAZING! I made it for a family dinner and EVERYONE loved it. I had to write down the recipe for everyone. The only thing i changed was that I added a tab bit more vanilla, and added nutmeg. For the icing I used the  butter cream whip cream icing from all recipes.

This was such a hit that I had to give many people the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, just used a bundt cake pan instead of 9x13. I microwaved canned cream cheese frosting and poured over to make it more glaze like. So yummy!! The cake is super moist!!

Years later and I came back to this recipe. Instead of vegetable oil I used all apple sauce. It was still good and super moist. I put a glaze on top of cinnamon, powdered sugar and a bit of milk. Everyone still loved it. :)

YUM! Really good! I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to add and change things in the recipe. 1st time i made it as written. It was very moist, but thought all that oil was not necessary and it neeed more spices. 2nd time i made it i did as others suggested - used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Added 3/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves. The pumpkin flavor was very good with the addition of the spices. The cake was very moist but too moist where it was a little wet and dense. 3rd time i made it i did 3/4 cup oil and no applesauce. Added the nutmeg & cloves. Perfect! Cake was moist (but not wet) and soft and fluffy. This is my go-to pumpkin cake from now on.

Followed the reviews w/ the oil apple sauce combo.  This was sooo good!  I also added a 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, ground clove, and ginger.  Plus my teaspoons of cinnamon were heaping.  Sounds like a lot of spices, but the pumpkin flavor really came through.  Didn't taste like a spice cake.  It was soooo moist!  This will be made many times!  I took it to a Women's Bible study at Church and didn't get to bring any left overs home!  The ladies were literally picking crumbs off the plate!!!  Great recipe!

The cake was ok. I expected much better results. It definitely need more sugar and spice. I don't know if I'll make this recipe again.

I couldn't wait to let you all know I entered this cake (using the cream cheese frosting #2 on this site) into the bake off at the Fall Festival baking contest at my kids school.  And.......
Drum Roll Please.....................
I WON FIRST PLACE!!!!!!
The only thing I did differently was replace the cinnimon with Pumpkin Pie Seasoning.  
I hadn't even tried it before entering the contest, but once I did I could see why it won.  It was very moist and the flavors came through very nicely.
Thanks for a great recipe and a fun night of congrat's from my school!  :)

This is very good and was loved by everyone following our Christmas dinner.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and put 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of all that oil.  I also added a tad of nutmeg (maybe would have experiemented with more spices if I had the time).  Made it in a bundt pan which took longer to bake, but it came out beautifully.  Also, used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

I rated this recipe based on the modifications other people suggested. I used 3/4c oil plus 1/2c unsweetened applesauce (instead of 1 1/4c oil), and 4t of pumpkin spice mix (instead of the 2t of cinnamon). I also frosted the cake with Cream Cheese Frosting II adding 1/2c powdered sugar, 2t vanilla extract, and 1t pumpkin spice mix. However, there was lots of frosting leftover so I probably only needed half the frosting recipe. I baked the cake in a bundt pan for over an hour (note: for the last 20 minutes of baking I tested the cake w/ a knife 3x and each time the very tip seemed to be wet so I let the cake bake some more - at the end of the last 20 minutes I gave up and took the cake out of the oven - it was perfectly cooked - I think the cake was just so rich that it just seemed wet). Besides for the baking confusion, this is a fabulous recipe. It may be too rich or oily for some (probably because there's FOUR eggs, lots of pumpkin, and oil). The frosting is a great compliment but not necessary.

Very nice - moist and light.  I did as others mentioned - cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  Also added a little extra cinammon, and a bit of nutmeg and cloves. Frosted with cream cheese icing and it was delicious.

Oh - since I didn't need a particularly large cake - I baked it in 3 round cake pans for about 25-30 minutes.  I froze two of them for use later :-)

This is one of my favorite cakes.  My very favorite is a carrot cake, but it takes way too long to make.  So, when I want a similar taste (with much, much less work), I'll opt for this one.  It goes together a little weird with the oil and sugar, but follow the recipe and you won't be disapointed.  I made this the first time for my sister's baby shower and everyone raved about it.  I frosted it with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" and it was fantastic.

This is the best pumpkin one I've tried.  I cut it in half, then split them into layers.  I got a 4 layer cake that I put a mix of bavarian cream and buttercream icing (with a touch of pumpkin pie spice) in between then topped it with a very light cream cheese icing.  It was decorated as a  halloween birthday cake.  I WILL be using it again for my husbands birthday in January.

Very yummy and homely. I shared with friends living close by and it was highly praised. The only thing is maybe slightly too sweet for my taste (i.e. not healthy enough. Oh, well it is a cake!). I used one suggestion of cream-cheese glazing/topping. I think it is the topping that made it feel even sweeter. So if you are using a cream cheese + sugar based topping maybe reduce sugar amounts in both the cake and the topping slightly

This cake was a hit with the whole family on Thanksgiving. I did however tweak it a little bit. Instead of using vegetable oil, I used 1/2 a cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 3/4 cup of coconut oil. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and nutmeg. It was great.

Fantastic and very moist! Made with cream cheese frosting II, but tastes good by itself too.

It's ok... my husband who likes pumpkin a lot says it's good... I followed the recipe except for a bit more cinnamon, a bit less sugar and oil and instead of eggs used flaxseed ( since my son is allergic... flaxseed milled is a great egg substitute for more baked goods).

This was good but I wouldn't say it was great. In my opinion it could have used some additional spices such as nutmeg, ginger, and ground cloves. This being said, I think it will definitely turn out great next time around!

Made this for my ladies' bible study luncheon and it was a big winner.  Easy to make and I used Pillsbury cream cheese icing, which cut the prep time and still tasted great!  Thank you!

Cake came out great!  i followed everyone's advice to add applesauce and cut the oil (i only had canola oil) -  also took another's advice and used only 3 eggs and 1/2 tsp salt.  I have the William Sonoma great pumpkin pan, so that it's 2 small bundt cakes that come together to look like a pumpkin :)  Also made the cream cheese II frosting everyone was raving about - it was good but a little TOO sweet for my taste.   No complaints from my family though!

Worth a try! I baked the cake in a bundt pan so it would look pretty. It was done in 40 minutes.  I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and used Canola oil b/c that's what I had in the cupboard.  The cake was perfectly moist and stayed that way for a few days afterward.  I did not ice it, but may try that when I make it again next week for Thanksgiving.  I can see why some may say it's oily, but that didn't take away from how delicious it was.  Thank you!

Wow.  This cake is amazing!  I love pumpkin and wanted to make a second cake for my son's bday and this cake got rave reviews.  I topped it with cream cheese frosting and it was perfection.  I will use it again and again.  My only change was to add 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.

Fabulous! My son love's pumpkin so we picked out this recipe to make for his birthday cake. Total hit by all! Everybody loved it. I used a suggestion from another reviewer about the cream cheese frosting from this site as well, perfect match. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe ;)

Moist and delicious. baked in a 9 x 13 pan then frosted with cream cheese frosting made with some brown sugar and cinnamon added. Also used pumpkin pie spice in place of cinnamon in the cake. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent, very moist, not too sweet. More like a carrot cake.  Pumpkin is a subtle background flavor.  I baked this cake yesterday for my daughter's birthday today and she loved it!  The can pumpkin is sold in 15 oz. cans and I needed 
16 oz. for the 2 cups, so I added 1 oz. of applesauce to make up for it.  I will be making it again and again with the cream cheese icing.  The bundt pan version will take nearly 1 hr. to bake.

MAde this for a Halloween Party and it was a hit! 
I upped the cinnamon to 2t, added 2t of nutmeg, 2t of giner and 1t of cloves and replaced the vanilla with rum extract. I also traded 1/2 cup of oil for unswettened applesauce. It came out delicious and not overly spiced. I used cream cheese frostingII (half recipe) and substituted rum flavoring again for the vanilla. The overall taste was amazing and the moistness of the cake is unbeliveable. I baked in a bundt pan for 1 hour at the recommended temp and it came out perfectly.

OMG!!! Fantastic recipe, will become one of my classics. I took the suggestion of others who substituted the apple sauce and I prefer a "spicier" cake and add 2 tsps. of pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon called for. I think I'll add cloves next time. Great cake texture, moist, yet not oily, good crumb. I used the Nordic Ware Platinum Collection 10-15 cup Bundt pan (best bundt pan ever made!) and cooked for 50 minutes. By the way, 2 cups of Pumpkin is one 16 oz can.

Made a bundt cake so I had to bake for 50 minutes. Besides that, I followed the directs to a tee. I topped with a cream cheese and whipped cream mix topping. I really like how moist the cake turned out.

Ive made these, following the exact recipe and also with the modifications that others have recomended. I have to say that I prefer the original recipe. They dont need any frosting but of course they taste just fine with a cream cheese frosting. I make this recipe (with the healthy changes) for the kids in my sons play group and they all love them and always ask for more.

I made this cake yesterday and it turned out great. The only change I made, as suggested by other reviewers, was to use 1/2 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup of oil instead of 1 1/4 cups. I did add the walnuts as I think that it always gives a nice texture. It was really moist and tasty.

Wow - this turned out perfectly!  I followed the directions as written, and it's delicious and moist.  To look like the picture, I did it in a bunt pan for additional time (50 min total?), and topped with cream cheese frosting and orange/green/yellow sprinkles.  A huge hit!

I also used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and added 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe by JJ and only used 1/4 of the recipe (which was plenty!)  I added a little water to the frosting and drizzled it over the cake (which I baked for 50 min. in a bundt pan).  Sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice over the frosting and wala...gorgeous, moist, and yummy!

Loved these! As others suggested I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce and you won't know the difference.  I made 24 cupcake/muffins and baked for 20 minutes.  Topped with a halved recipe of 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' by Janni (there are 2 on this site).  These will be made often!! Update: Made as 2 9inch cakes and baked 30 minutes.

Insanely delicious..Nom Nom Nom!!!  I made this as a 3 layer cake for my Dad's Birthday, and it was to-die-for.  My changes were as follows:  I subbed one cup of white sugar for packed brown sugar, used 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce (instead of all oil), and used 4 tsp pumpkin spice seasoning and 1/2 tsp ground cloves (instead of the cinnamon called for).  I divided the batter into 3 round cake pans, and baked for 25-30 minutes.  I frosted the cake with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting, and it paired perfectly :~)

Very good. Moist, make sure you remove the cake CAREFULLY from the pan as it will fall apart in chunks of crumbled (but delicious) cake.

What a moist and delicious cake! I baked it in a 13x9 inch pan for 40 minutes and iced it with cream cheese frosting. I baked this instead of pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving. I already have the recipe written down for future use!

This was very very good and I made it in a bundt pan.  I used real pumpkin instead of canned and also substituted applesauce for some of the oil.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and ground cloves and used rum icing from "Holiday Pumpkin Cake with Rum-Cream cheese icing" and that icing is awesome.

Very moist and delicious!  I used 3/4 c. oil + 1/2 c. water instead of 1 1/4 c. oil and also added about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves.  Baked in 2 mini bundt pans for 40 min.  SOOOO good!

I selected this recipe because of it's rave reviews to enter in a cook-off at work.  Professional bakers judged and this cake won 1st place.  It's VERY moist and can be baked in both the rectangular pan as well as a Bundt.  I did both and both were magnificent!!  This is definitely a keeper!!

Rave reviews from everyone who tasted it.  Used 1/2 cup applesauce for part of the oil, but next time think I will raise it to 3/4...don't think it would hurt too much.  Also doubled up on some spices since that's our family preference.  Cooked in a Bundt pan at 350 for about 45 minutes.  Used homemade cream cheese frosting thinned out to drizzle over the top.  Outstanding.

This cake was soooo good!  I changed the oil to 34 cup and added a 12 cup applesauce.  It was so moist!  I also baked it in a bundt pan for 65-70 minutes.  The Bourbon Cream Cheese Frosting from this site was awesome drizzled on top.

This cake was wonderful! It tastes like a pumpkin roll without all the fuss. I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site for a light and delicious topping. I also made the following changes: I used 2 15oz. cans of pumpkin for a little more of a pumpkiny taste and added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar. I omitted all the spices and used 3 1/4 t. pumpkin pie spice instead. Self rising flour worked great for me without the use of salt, soda, or baking powder. I baked in a 9X13 pan and had to adjust the baking time considerably. It took 75 minutes to bake on 350 degrees for me. It was very moist and I had to keep it in the fridge due to the cream cheese icing, but it was still lovely. Surprisingly, I didn't think it tasted that much like carrot cake, but more like pumpkin roll. I was very impressed with this recipe overall and have a feeling I'll be making it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Made this this afternoon and just now had a piece. This was delicious! This is one of the moistest cakes I have ever eaten. My changes were to only use 1 cup of oil and 1 15 oz. can of pumpkin. I topped this with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of that. This wasn't overly spicy, so if you are looking for that you might want to add some spices. This did not taste too much like pumpkin, it was just a nice autumn cake. Thanks for the post :)

This cake is amazing. Soooo moist and flavorful. I actully had to substitute the oil for butter and was worried about the results. It turned out perfect! I frosted it with the Cream Cheese frosting II from this website, which was perfect as well. I will be serving this at Thanksgiving this year! Thanks Allrecipes!

I have tried it as is,and it's delicious.  I've been using this recipe tweaked for my family's tastes.  I use 1 1/2 C sugar, 1/2 C oil, 3/4 C applesauce, add 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  I bake in muffin pans for 18-20 minutes.  Everyone loves them!

This was delicious and I don't really like cake that much.  I used a bundt cake pan and it took just 10-15 minutes more to bake.  I made it for my husband's birthday decorating it like a pumpkin with the top of a real gourd in the middle to look like a pumpkin stem. It was a hit!  I paired it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II dyed orange from this site. :)

Wow!!  This cake was delicious.  I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and it turned out wonderful.  I used the Vanilla Glaze recipe from this website to top it off--turned out great!  Smells absolutely wonderful when baking!

Wonderful and moist.  Made changes with spices only that were recommended by other reviewers.  made 2 large loaves.  One with nuts and other without.  Rave reviews by my family over Thanksgiving.  Topped each loaf with the cream cheese Frosting II recipe from Allrecipes.  Will do this again and again.  Thanks!

I have to be gluten and dairy free. I used 2 cups of gluten free flour and added 1 tsp. of xanthan gum.  I like extra spice so added some pumpkin pie spice. Used 3/4 cup of homemade applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil.  I was also able to decrease the
sugar to 1 3/4cups. excellent and wouldn't even know it was gluten and dairy free.

I would give this recipe 4 and a half, only because of my adjustments. I thought the batter needed a bit more flavor, so, I added some all spice, and a bit of nutmeg. This was just by taste so if you feel like giving it more spice do a 1/4 tsp of the all spice and 1/8 of nutmeg. Great texture with the applesauce substitute advised by others.

I wish I would have taken the advice of other reviews and used half applesauce/applebutter in place of the oil. The cake was just too oily and almost too moist once baked. Further, it needs more cinnamon and other spices (cloves, nutmeg, &/or allspice). I thought the flavor was a little bland. Having said all of that, with a few adjustments this would be a great cake...as written it is just an okay cake.

One word:  PERFECTION!  I made this into cupcakes and baked for about 18 minutes.  Instead of 1 1/4 cups of oil I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of regular applesauce and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.  WOW... they came out so delicate and moist, had a nice rounded top, didn't sink or go flat, and the flavor is amazing.  It's not the typical in-your-face "PUMPKIN SPICE" but is very delicate and not overpowering.  My husband hates all things pumpkin and is not a cake fan and he inhaled 2 of these right after frosting.  THAT tells you something.  This one is a keeper!

Excellent cake!  Moist and delicious, I made it in a cookie sheet like recipe calls, it took 25 minutes.  I didnt have any cream cheese to make frosting so I used a homemade caramel frosting that I use on other cakes, and it was to die for!!! thanks!!

This is a great recipe. I was out of a/p flour so I used cake flour. I added a 1/4 cup more than what the recipe called for to account for the difference in flour type. I used a teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, a half teaspoon each of ground ginger and allspice, and about a quarter teaspoon of clove. The cake smelled wonderful and baked up beautifully. It came out super moist and was one of the lightest, fluffiest cakes I've ever had. I drizzled a simple glaze on top. I do think that this is the type of cake that tastes better a day after it is made so the flavors have time to meld. The spices don't come through as strongly when it is warm out of the oven. But I will definitely make this again and am looking forward to substituting other ingredients for the pumpkin, as some other reviewers have suggested. Thanks for this recipe!

I'm a vegan, and also trying to eat healthier, so I made some substitutions and cut some ingredients. I used a flax seed and water mixture for the eggs, and used a gluten-free flour. Had no baking powder, so substituted baking soda. Added a ton more cinnamon and some ginger as well, since the first try came out rather bland. Also axed the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and made it an even 1 cup. Texture was fabulous on both tries, though I find the 30 minutes suggestion a bit odd- mine had to bake for a full hour before it wasn't gooey, but that could very well be because of my substitutions- I'm a really new cook, and this has boosted my confidence- will be bringing this to Christmas!

The best! I took the suggestions of others and did 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce. I also added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I was going to add more cinnamon but I use Watkins and that can be over powering sometimes.
Made with cream cheese frosting on this site (played with that) Excellent reviews, entering into bake off at the end of the month at work. Thank you!

really good pumpkin cake recipe. I also added a bit more spices. I made the cake in mini bundt pans because I was making a pumpkin patch desert theme (I made each mini cake to look like a pumpkin w/ a stem in the middle) they tasted and looked fantastic

This is a great recipe! So delicious and moist. I added more spices than what the recipe called for and followed the others suggestion of adding only 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce (draining it for 2min before adding it to the mix). I'm really glad I did because this cake came out perfect. As for the spices, I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice, 1 tsp of cloves and 1 tsp of nutmeg. Delicious! I will be making this again =). Thanks Sue for sharing.

It's a keeper! To add to this wonderful cake I exchanged the oil for 3/4cup of oil and 1/4 cup of cinnamon apple sauce. After the caked cooled I added cinnamon cream filling. Which is made by 2 heaping teaspoons of flour and 1/2 cup of cream-cook over low heat until thick - cool, add to 1/2 - 2/3 sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of crisco, beat until fluffy. I pipe the filling into the bottom of the cake. Frosted the cake with Italian Cream cinnamon cream cheese frosting. All I can say is wow!

did as others suggested, less oil and applesauce, added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cloves, 3 tsp cinnamon  350 degrees for about 40-42 minutes. seems very moist. I think I could cut back on the oil even more next time. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had.

Great recipe!!!!!  I made this last night and the only changes I made was I halved the recipe and made it in a 8x8 dish.  I also doubled the cinnamon and addeed a little bit of nutmeg and ginger.  I had to bake it for 45 minutes.  After it cooled, I made my own cream cheese frosting and added orange sugar sprinkles.  My only concern was my husband who "does not prefer pumpkin anthing"....but tasted it today and said it was very good!  I think I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving!!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good cake. The only change I made was that I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. Everything else I kept the same & it turned out great. 

Used Cream Cheese Frosting II (by JJ) from this site. This cake was VERY moist & flavorful

This is a fantastic recipe! I messed up my first batch by accidentally adding too much pumpkin. (I added a full can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup after halving the recipe) I can't explain why these still turned out...and so moist! I did use mini muffin pans so maybe this made a difference??? It did however taste bland because the extra pumpkin diluted the spices. So what I learned from my mistake was that by adding a little extra puree only made my "muffins" more moist as long as you adjust your spices accordingly. I also added some pumpkin spice and ground cloves as well as extra cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!

Best cake ever and I usually do not like pumpkin.  I made this for a family dinner and it was a huge hit.  The hubby took the rest to work the next day and my pan came back scrapped clean.  The only thing I did different was to add a heaping tsp of pumpkin spice and prepared it in a bundt pan.  I think I will add a little more pumpkin spice next time.  This cake is perfect with or without some type of icing. I am making this again tonight for me to bring to work.  yummy!!!

GREAT cake! I made it into cupcakes and used a cream cheese frosting made with butter, cream cheese, a little milk, a little heavy whipping cream, vanilla and powdered sugar. HUGE HIT!

This recipe is sooo tasty. I had to make an alteration with the pumpkin because I couldn't find just plain jarred pumpkin in my grocery stores. They were completely out and apparently do not get anymore in until November around the holiday. I used Pumpkin pie mix though and it worked great! I used about a half of a large (really large) can. I also added about a half a bag of mini chocolate chips and also halved the whole recipe other than that because I was making mini cupcakes! So delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this in the microwave & it came out awesome!!!!!  Halved the recipe, put it in a silicone bunt pan, cooked on high 6 minutes, took out of microwave & covered with a plate to finish cooking (~5 min.), then turned it out onto the plate.  I was almost expecting it to be a little rubbery, but it was perfectly moist......I was amazed!

A total and complete success!  Great texture, very moist, very tasty.  I didn't frost it, which was TOTALLY fine.  Alterations I made:  as per other reviews, I used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  To get a more spicy spice cake flavor, I added 1 TSP ground ginger, 1/2 TSP cloves, and 1/2 TSP allspice.  (Skipped the nuts.) In addition, I baked it in a 10-inch bundt pan, which fit perfectly -- I added 12 minutes to the baking time to adjust for the bundt.

I enjoyed this cake. I baked it in a bundt pan and it needed about an hour to cook through with a great golden brown top. I just dusted mine with icing sugar as the cake is rather moist and sweet, so it doesn't require an extra flavour of icing. I also added 1 tsp of grated orange rind & half tsp ground nutmeg & clove to mine, because I like the spicy citrusy flavour. I couldn't even detect a strong pumpkin flavour (which is good!).

This cake was absolutely fabulous.  I made it as a bundt (cooked 45 minutes) and topped it with Vanilla Glaze from this site and sprinkled some chopped toasted walnuts on top.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce (out of necessity!) and it was amazing without all the fat.  Even my hub who does not care for pumpkin-y things said it was excellent.

What a perfect Halloween dessert! I used applesauce to replace half the oil and it was so moist and delicious. The only other thing I did was to add some nutmeg and a pinch of ginger...tasted just like pumpkin pie in a cake form. Frosted with cream cheese frosting...oh and baked it in a  bundt pan. Beautiful presentation, thanks!

This cake is so moist. For the oil I used 3/4c oil and 1/2c applesauce. Also my can of pumpkin was 15 oz so that is what I used and added 3 tsps of pumpkin spice. Baked in a 13x9 pan for 35 min. I made a 1/2 recipe Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site which was just the right amount for the cake. Will definitely be making this again.

Holy cow is this good!!  The only substitution I made was using 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of the oil, and I added extra cinnamon since we love it.  I made cupcakes and got 34 beautiful little cakes, yum!!  This is a keeper!!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

I had to make a few changes to this recipe simply because I didn't have all the ingredients; ie, using extra light olive oil, eggzactly (imitation eggs), and a glass baking dish. However, this cake still came out wonderful, especially when topped with cream cheese frosting! (ps - if you need to bake this in a glass dish, reduce the temp. by 25 degrees and be prepared to cook it for an extra 15-20 minutes)

Wow, this turned out great!  I also followed the suggestions to sub 3/4 oil with applesauce and it turned out super duper moist!  Top with a bit of cream cheese frosting and it was such a treat.  Similar to carrot cake in flavor.  I baked mine in medium muffin pans 350 degrees for 22 minutes and turned out great!

I made this for thanksgiving today and it's very dense, more pie than cake.  I was hoping that it would be a light, fluffy cake but I guess with all that oil and four eggs it wasn't going to happen.  I figured the 3 teaspoons of baking powder would give the cake some air, but no dice.  The texture is like a pound cake.

I used a 13X9 pan and thought it would be too small, since the recipe calls for a 12X18, but the cake hardly rose more than 3/4 of the way in my pan.  The flavor of the cake is otherwise good and I'll make it again, but I'll use less oil and eggs, and add some pumpkin pie spice.  

I topped this cake with an allrecipes whipped cream/cream cheese topping stabilized with some gelatin, this frosting is actually the perfect complement to the dense cake, it's very light and fluffy.

AMAZING! Followed the modifications by adding spices. I think my 3 year old (who eats nothing)summed it up best when he had a full blown tantrum when told he could not have a THIRD piece! Everyone at our holiday dinner raved about this cake. We used the cream cheese II frosting.

Oh my Gosh, this is a great recipe!  I used this recipe and added a half of teaspoon of AllSpice for Thanksgiving.  This was a big hit!  Instead of making a cake I made cup-cakes, and used the Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I doubled this recipe, and made half with nuts and of course the other batch with out nuts.  I did cut back on the oil used, I used only half of the oil that the recipe called for and the other half I used Applesauce.  Very moist cake.  Awesome Recipe!  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly how it is written but used a bundt pan instead as I like the presentation better for company then the plain old flat pans,  had to cook it awhile longer because of that but this was fantastic! I also used the cream cheese II frosting recipe on this site that other reviewers suggested I only had one brick of cream cheese when I went to make it so I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty! Moist and delicious! This will definately be made again and again! THANKS!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. This is a man who does not like cake of any kind. After watching everyone else eating it and hearing them rave, he tried it and loved it! This is the highest praise anyone can get. He's asked me to make it for Thanksgiving dinner instead of pumpkin pie.

I doubled the recipe and paked it in a 9x13 sheet pan and iced it with the Cream Cheese icing submitted by JJ. It was so awesome! Very moist. I wouldn't change a thing.

Spectacular!  This is a holiday hit with my family.  Even those who dislike pumpkin pie devour this cake. I add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of clove and use the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe.

Awesome! I made this cake last night and even my daughter who hates pumpkin pie, loved it! I used homemade pumpkin puree instead of canned and it was great. I made a few changes though, I used 1 1/2 cups of Splenda instead of sugar and 3/4 cup oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce and added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground cloves.  I did frost with a cream cheese frosting, but you really don't need anything on this cake - it's sooo good the way it is. I am making it again tonight to take to work tomorrow (without frosting) - I still have some puree left.  Yummy!

I am surprised this cake received such high reviews.  It was moist, but I expected that was 1 1/4 c oil!  It was, however very bland.  I really wish I had read the other reviews before I made it because it could have used more cinnamon and some nutmeg.  I might try it again, adding more spice and switching apple sauce for some of the oil.  

I did use the recipe for "Cream Cheese Frosting II" and highly suggest using that for pumpkin cake.

We loved this cake, I did bake it in a 9 x 13 cake pan, but I didn't have to bake it that much longer, I just kept checking on it and it was done shortly after an extra 10 or 15 minutes.  When I saw that it was firm I just touch the center and it sprang back up, I wasn't going to frost it so I didn't want any test holes in the cake.  It was delicious served with whipped cream.  I'm a fairly experienced cake baker so I don't need the toothpick in the middle test, I can tell by the firmness of the cake and the spring.  One reviewer mentioned she baked it for 75 minutes, well that's a big gap so please know your oven and test the cake the way you know it's done, but once you get it right you'll love this cake, it's got lots of possibilities of dressing it up and just keeping it simple like we did.  It was moist, not too sweet and the taste appealed to everyone, I made two cakes and served it to 18 people and everyone loved it.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made it just according to the recipe (I used all the oil..no substitutes) and it turned out great.  I did add a tsp of nutmeg, cloves, and ground ginger (for more spice) and made jumbo cupcakes instead of using a sheet pan, but it still turned out great.  The taste is just pumpkiny enough and it has just the right amount of moistness and sweetness.  I frosted it with the cream cheese frosting submitted by JJ, but I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  THANK YOU SUE!!!

I made this recipe as stated in the directions, but cooked it in cupcake tins for 15 minutes, and it turned out fabulous!  They were very light and moist.  Mmmmm, definately a hit.

This reciped is awesome.  I had to eye a few of the measurements and I had to beat it by hand.  I hate pumpkin pie, and I thought this was very very good!  The whole thing was gone when I was back the next day!

This recipe was pretty quick and easy.  I added about 1/4 tsp of clove, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to give it a spicer taste.  It did remind me a lot of carrot cake.  It was very good.  I think I'll pour the mix into muffin pans next time (and adjust the cooking time).  It would probably make a good breakfast around the holidays.

LOVE this moist, fluffy pumpkin cake.  Also makes great cupcakes.  I prefer to use 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce as other reviewers suggested, as well as add 1 tsp nutmeg.

Yummy cake and easy.  I was out of oil and that amount seemed high.  I used 3/4 cup of crisco and generous amounts of extra pumpkin.  It was moist and dense...sliced well...big hit at a recent luncheon.

Made this last night for work today, just as the recipe states, except used 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Used my own cream cheese frosting recipe. Getting rave reviews so far! Moist and delicious. My 12x18 pan was done in 20 minutes.

Wow!  I topped with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting from this site and these are fantastic!  I lightened it up a bit by replacing 3/4ths of the oil with applesauce and using egg beaters. I used very healthy teaspoons of cinnamon and omitted the nuts.  I got 24 cupcakes and had to bake for 22 minutes.  Am going to give the rest away so I don't eat more - they are that good.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband said this was the best pumpkin cake he has ever tasted! I read all the reviews and added 4 teaspoons of pumpkin seasoning, an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract,  1/2 c of applesauce unsweet, and 3/4 c of oil ( in lieu of the oil the recipe called for), bundt style for 43 minutes (I have a conventional oven). Next time I will follow the advice of the reviewers and make my own cream cheese frosting...I used Betty Crocker Cream Cheese Icing...but man it was still great!!! Thank you for the recipe and all the reviewers for there great input!

I used cream chease frosting 2.

Wow this recipe is fantastic!! Only changes I made was using some apple sauce instead of all of the oil as many people have suggested.  I made it in a bundt pan and it took about an hour in the oven.  During the last 20 mins I checked it about every 5 minutes.  I topped it with a brown sugar cream cheese icing and wow amazing.  Everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving dinner.  Even my father in law who doesn't care much for desserts or sweets asked to take a piece home! So moist and delish -  I will def be making this again!

So yummy.  I made it just as it was directed and it came out so moist and flavorful...but not overpowering.  I think you could cut down on the oil a bit and still have it turn out great.  I poured cream cheese frosting over the top and sprinkled with the orange sprinkles to make it look just like the picture.  Everyone was impressed.  :-)  Would for sure make again.

Wonderful, moist cake.  Made in a bundt pan and added cream cheese filling by mixing 8 oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/3 cup sugar and adding it around center of batter before baking.  Frosted with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site.  Perfect!!

I made this cake for my son's first birthday cake and it turned out really well! Like the others recommended, I substituted some applesauce for the oil. It was extremely moist—so moist in fact that the layers slid off each other after I cut it. Oops! Next time I'll just make it in a sheet pan. Delicious!

I made this for the teachers at my son's school and got rave reviews.  I don't like pumpkin and I even liked this cake.  I made the recipe as is and did not use applesauce as some reviewers suggested.  I made this as a two layer cake with cream cheese frosting.

One word describes this cake >> DELICIOUS. Simply delicious. My family ate this cake in 2 days & we're not big cake eaters. I mainly wanted to try out this recipe before I made it for Thanksgiving & I'll definitely be making it again .. I did follow some of the reviews left by others & used 3/4 cup of oil & a 1/2 of applesauce. I skipped cinnamon & used pumpkin pie seasoning, nutmeg, allspice & cloves >> went CRAZY with the spices. I cooked it for 45 minutes in a greased & floured bundt pan .. I also bought some cream cheese frosting & seasoned it with a ton of spices as well [pumpkin pie seasoning, cinnamon & nutmeg] .. the cake was unbelieveably moist .. it melts in your mouth .. My family RAVED about it !! Ill definitely be making this again! Cheers~

Delicious - nice and light for this type of a cake and perfect for a Fall treat. I followed the recipe as written, left out the nuts because most in my family don't care for them. Baked mine in a tube pan for a little over an hour and it came out beautifully. Served with a topping of softened cream cheese mixed wih Cool Whip which complimented the cake nicely.

I made this cake exactly as posted - it was delicious! I did make it twice because the first time I made it with pumpkin pie filling by accident. Do not make this mistake as the center of the cake will not set. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

I made this for a party and it was a hit. Everyone loved it and people were fighting for the last piece. The only modification I did was add 1 tsp pumpkin spice, 2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 c oil & 1/2 c applesauce. I will definitely making this again. I made cream cheese frosting to go on top of it. Delicious!!!!

This is amazing!  Everyone at the potluck loved it & it was gone in no time!  Even my husband, who doesn't like pumpkin, LOVED this!  It is so moist & great flavor.  I didn't add the walnuts, and I sprinkled some nutmeg, cloves, & all spice to the dry ingredients, & heaping tsps of cinnamon.  Put in a bundt pan & cooked about 45 mins.  Frosted w/Cream Cheese Frosting II by JJ from this site, which was also amazing w/slight modifications (see my comments on that review).

This is the first review I have written, but this cake deserves it!! I made it as a bundt cake and it took around an hour to cook. I used store bought vanilla glaze and decorated it with candy corn. It was sooo moist and yummy. It could be eaten without the frosting. Side note - it was so beautiful that I was taking pictures of it and dropped my camera in the icing!

I did not change anything in this recipe.  I made a bundt cake and cooked it for 45 minutes.  I topped it with cream cheese frosting.  It was great.  I have two kids (son who is 10 and daughter who is 4).  They are picky eaters when it comes to something new.  My kids loved this cake.  My son told me to keep this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband could not get enough of this cake! I made it in a bunt pan and used the cream cheese frosting recipe on this site and it was perfect! Thank you for sharing!

I am rating this a 4 because I made changes to make it a 5.  I added some pumpking pie seasoning and some allspice. I also baked in a bundt pan which took more like 40-45 minutes.  It turned out so good topped with the vanilla glaze recipe from AR.

this cake is extraordinary! loved by everyone. Subbed in about half apple sauce for the oil. Also added sprinkling of cloves and nutmeg. Topped with cream cheese frosting and chopped walnuts - this is a MUST! Be sure to let cook COMPLETELY before frosting.  Perfectly moist. Great for fall.

I made this into cupcakes. Soooo amazing. I made a healthier version. 1cup agave nectar in place of sugar. 2cups wwp flour instead of white flour. 1/2 cup oil. 2.5cups canned pumpkin. 1tspn salt. Instead of 4 eggs i used 2whole eggs and 2egg whites.     1.5teaspoon cinnamon. 3 teaspoons pumpkin spice. 2 handfuls choc chips. I added pecans. And finally 1/2cup buttermilk. And 5oz fage Greek yogurt. It came out unbelievably moist and tasty.  Omgggggghh

Used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to cut the fat and deepen the flavor.  Baked 50 minutes in a bundt pan.    Wonderfully moist cake, even better the second day! I made a glaze from 1/4 of a simple cream cheese frosting recipe (add a touch of milk to thin it out) and that was all the frosting this cake needed.

Great cake!  I make half the recipe and put it in a high sided 8" round layer cake pan.  It makes a very nice sized smaller cake well suited to an evening event without lots of left overs (that I will eat all by myself.....).   Really nice with raisins and chopped pecans added in and powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

This was great! I took other folks suggestion and added lots of spices. I also replaced some of the oil with applesauce. It was still a bit oily. Next time I might use even more apple sauce and less oil.

This was Excellent!  'So  moist!!!  Very good. I made it in a bundt pan which was great, but the slices were so huge.  Although the presentation was great.  I think next time I'll try a layer cake with cream cheese icing in the middle.

Excellent pumpkin cake. I have to agree with other reviews, a little on the oily side, will cut down on oil next time. Great pumpkin taste, not overpowering.

Definately needs icing. I added cream cheese frosting sprinkled with cinn. sugar like one comment said and it turned out great! Very moist. Also, I did bake this in a 9X13 for 35 min. It turned out fine, but if I would have left it in there any longer it would have burned.

Great recipe.  I agree with the other reviewers that it calls for too much oil.  I cut the oil down to 3/4c and added 1/4 cup of non fat yogurt and it came out great.

I have a recipe that is similar and much better.  I always make that one so when I saw this one I thought it wouldn't hurt to try.  Well having the other one for so many years....I must say that it is so much better.  Will not make again.

Wow!  The whole family loved this one.  I've made it 3 times in the past few weeks.  I use the 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 cup applesauce as recommended.  I also use 3 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  And I top it with molasses spice cream cheese frosting.  Yum!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I had a pumpkin bread recipe I liked, but this has taken top place in the rotation.

Excellent cake. Made a great 1st birthday cake! Changes: Butter instead of oil (same amount) 1/2 c apple butter (unseasoned) 2 tsp "Pumpkin pie spice" (otherwise it is really very bland) 3 tsp Cinnamon (we like it a lot, and it still was not overpowering in the recipe)  I agree with the Creamcheese frosting recipe for the icing.   Overall excellent!

The best pumpkin cake ever.. wow!!  Like others, I did 1/2c oil + 3/4c applesauce, turned out AMAZING.  I made this into a birthday cake with cream cheese icing.. it tasted like it was heaven sent - I'm not exagerating! Everyone loved it, even the people who don't normally eat cake went back for seconds.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was good, but waaayyy too moist if you use that much oil.  I felt like you could see the oil dripping out of the cake.  Next time I will only use 3/4cup.

This is a great basic pumpkin cake recipe.  The pumpkin flavor is pretty mild, so if you're looking for a really pumpkin-y cake, this is probably not it.  We do enjoy more spice in our pumpkin cake, so I added 1 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cloves, along with 2 *heaping* tsp. of cinnamon.  I did not change anything else, except to bake it in a 10" bundt pan for 45 minutes.  It came out great.  Topped it with a light cream cheese glaze--yum!

I followed the recipe, but made a few changes:  Added nutmeg and cloves.  I followed another reviews advice and cut back the oil and added apple sauce.  I also baked in a bundt pan - mine was burnt on the outside, but mushy inside.  The flavour was nice, but the consistency made it inedible :(  I won't make this again.

This cake was delicious! I substituted by cutting the oil, as others suggested, by instead using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce and it came out so moist! I also added in dashes of pumpkin spice, cloves, and all spice; the outcome was incredibly rich.  I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site as well (!!). Will make again and again, especially when Thanksgiving rolls around!

Really, really good!!  Extremely moist, very nice flavor.  I also, like others, tweaked the oil amount - I used one cup of sweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup of canola oil, and then decreased the sugar to about 1 3/4 cups.  I will make this again - everyone, kids included, liked it!

Absolutely moist and yummy! I made the recipe exactly as written but made 24 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins from this batch...didn't have the 12X18 and wasn't sure if my regular 13X9 would handle it...baked at 350 for 22 minutes as another reviewer did and that was just perfect!

Made this for Thanksgiving for dessert for my pie-hating daughter.  She loved this (as did many others).  I was generous with the spices and iced with a whipped cream cheese frosting.  I'll make again because my daughter was so pleased to have a dessert when it is usually just all pies!

WOW!  I was looking for something besides pumpkin pie or bread to make - I am not a big fan.  And was I happy I tried this recipe!  It was amazing!  My husband had eaten three servings by the time I got back into the kitchen. I followed the recipe exactly.

Made this cake in bundt form for a Halloween Party. Just replaced a bit of oil with applesauce and used no nuts. Frosted with browned butter frosting. Came out fabulous, I live in high altitude and the cake was the perfect size. Delicious and easy!!

Great response from my coworkers!  I used pecans and my bundt pan (which was ridiculously full!) and it turned out beautifully.  Lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  Bake time ~50 minutes.  Will make again!

I halved the sugar, replaced the oil with fat free sour cream and used 2 tsps cinnamon and 2 tsps pumpkin spice. I also changed the leavening to 2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda, the recipe calls for way too much which would give it a very salty taste and bad after taste.
Big hit, very moist, made as a bundt but didn't frost.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was moist and delicious.  So addictive with cream cheese frosting!  I wouldn't have minded a bit stronger pumpkin flavor though.  The flavor is similar to spice cake box mixes.

I only needed a small dessert so I cut this in half.  It was still wonderful.  I made it in an 8x8 pan.  Frosted it with cream cheese frosting and topped it with Craisins and pecans.  It was a hit.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and even the pumpkin haters, raved over the cakes. Very moist and nicely spiced. I used a mini bundt cake pan to make each guest their own individual cake.  Also, I reduced the cooking time by about 4 min. for the small pan.

I actually made this for a friend's casual wedding (two bundts of this and two doctored-cake-mix chocolate bundts) and people LOVED it. Great flavor and texture. It's a little forgiving if you like to improvise or aren't especially precise, too. Definitely recommended. I drizzled it with JJ's cream cheese icing II and it was an amazing combination. Just thinking about it makes me want to eat another slice!

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made, my husband just loves it.  I did make some changes.  I used only 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and soda, and added 1 tsp nutmeg and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I used the oil that it called for and it turned out really moist not oily at all. I also used a 9x13 and baked it at 325 for 40 minutes.  For the topping I used the cool whipped frosting from this site,  as I like my cakes cold.  This is a must try!!!

This cake was absolutely scrumptious! I followed the recipe exactly. The bake time was a bit longer, but the end result was enjoyed by my family of 'pumpkin-haters'. Guess we can remove pumpkins off the won't-eat-it list this year! Thanks for a great recipe!

High altitude adjustments: 1 2/3 cup sugar, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder. Fill pans 1/3 to half full (1 1/2 cups for 6" pans).  I made these adjustments and it is still moist. Most delicious cake! Thanks!

Have made this twice now... First time for a housewarming pot luck and it was loved by all (even a guy who claimed he hated pumpkin!). Used a nice cream cheese icing and it was perfect. Had to e-mail the recipe to 4 women the next day because their men told them they want it made for them again! 

A friend & family favourite!!

Only thing i noticed, I had to bake it for upwards to an hour before it was ready.. the recommended cook time is just not enough! even with a brand new oven!!

Not the best pimpkin cake I've ever had, but pretty good. I cut the oil back to 1 cup, because previous reviews had said that using the full amount was too much. I also added WAY more spice. I didn't really measure, but probably used 2-3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I iced it with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from this website. It was good, but I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

VERY yummy cake.  Super soft, but a bit too much oil.  I'll try replacing half the oil with applesauce next time.  The cake was excellent anyway.
I frosted using a vanilla frosting (as the b/f doesn't like cream cheese) & that was yummy, too.  But I left half unfrosted, as it was so good plain.

Moist and light cake. O used baked and pureed fresh pumpkins. I added only 1.5 cups of sugar and still found it way too sweet. good recipe - will make it again with less sugar and less oil.

This is absolutely awesome.  I add a pinch of cloves and grate some fresh nutmeg in.  Very  moist, very smooth - it's amazing with the cream cheese frosting (from JJ) on this site.

EXCELLENT!!! There is no need to make any changes or substitutes to this recipe. I did leave out the walnuts and used 3 round cake pans - baked for 20 mins. This cake was not only delicious but Extremely moist. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the family loved it! As other's suggested, I used 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. cinnamon apple sauce. I also used Chinese Five Spice instead of the spices. Used 3 round cake pans and then iced between layers and on top with Cream Cheese Icing. (not the sides) Beautiful cake and delicious!

Lots of changes necessary if you're a pumpkin fan & want to make it yummy. I did all the oil, but agree with others that it can be reduced. The Libby pumpkin roll recipe doesn't even call for oil at all. My cake is hot out of the oven, but I cut into it anyway & I do think it could get too moist as usually cake gets more moist as it cools & seasons. Definitely cut out 1/4 cup. If you think about it - cake mixes don't ever call for that much oil & cake mixes aren't using moist pumpkin.

Mine needed more salt - it was super duper bland without extra salt. It also needed extra cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg to help the pumpkin really stand out.

You really don't need that much sugar either, especially if you plan to frost the cake. If you're not frosting, then it's fine.

If you're surprised by the 5 stars - think back to all the pot lucks & bake sales you've been too & store bought pumpkin pies that are orange, bland with very little spices in them. That's how it got 5 stars!!

very good cake, very dense and moist, i mixed the oil with the applesause per other users and that worked out very well.  I used two teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, next time i will try 3. Topped with cream cheese frosting, made a nice large cake, it does sink as it cools.

I adapted this recipe to make a chocolate and pumpkin layer with brown butter frosting. The only changes I made were to up the spice amount and cut a little of the oil (using coconut oil). It came out moist and sooo beautiful!

Needs more flavor and flour. As written, this recipe produced flat cupcakes due to too much moisture. 

My suggestions:
Instead of using all vegetable oil, use half butter & half oil. Cake will turn out more tender with a finer texture.
Add an additional 1/2c. flour
1/2 t. dry ground ginger
1 t. cinnamon
1/2 t. ground cloves
FYI: Don't have canned pumpkin? -Canned drained, pureed sweet potatoes can be substituted for pumpkin.

Delicious when topped with a crumb topping too. Make it in small loaf pans for gift giving. Your friends will love it. After making the additions, you'll agree it rates 5 stars.

Wonderful cake! Worthy of the pie pumpkins I pampered all summer long in my garden. I'm giving this only 4 stars because of the unnecessary amount of oil and sugar, and it needs more spice.  All the reviews are so helpful. I cut the sugar down to 1-1/3 C., and will cut back further next time.  Added more spice. Baked in a 9x13 pan for about 50 min. For the frosting, used 1 8-oz. cream cheese, 1/4 C. butter, 2 C. powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla. Perfect amount. Yum!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, using 1/2 Splenda 1/2 sugar and reducing the oil and using applesauce as recommended in other reviews.  It was absolutely wonderful! Great with coffee and great without frosting as well.  The only thing I may do differently the next time, and there will be a next time, is add some pecans into the cake.  MAKE THIS CAKE!  You won't be disappointed.

Love this recipe. My family and I devoured it in no time. Used a bundt pan, cream cheese icing II, and used reviewer's suggestion with 3/4 applesauce & 1/2 cup oil. Also, I added my spice as if I was making a pumpkim pie. AMAZING! I made it a day ahead of time. Three days later, it is still moist and delish! Love this cake. It truely is my new favorite.

This cake was easy to make and very moist.  I made it as a bundt cake instead of a sheet cake and used only 1/2 the recommended frosting.  I think nuts and raisins would make it even better.  The recipe is a keeper!

Excellent pumpkin flavor in a perfectly light textured and moist cake.  I got great results using only 1/2 c. canola oil with 3/4 c. applesauce.  In a bundt pan, it needed to bake about 50 minutes for me at high altitude.

I have done this several ways. My new favorite (and that of everyone I know who has tasted it!) is to make it in muffin pans, slice each one open horizontally, fill with home-made cinnamon cream cheese icing, top with a little more cinnamon cream cheese icing and then drizzle caramel on the top.  Super yummy!  This also freezes wonderfully!

I followed this recipe as is and just added a teaspoon of nutmeg. As others have said, very moist and quite tasty.  If you don't like your cakes too sweet, you could cut out a 1/4 cup of sugar but this was a hit. In addition to walnuts, raisins are also a good option of you like them.

Very good, but description is messed up. How do you bake this cake in a sheet pan? The cake in the picture is round and the description asks for a 12x18 sheet pan. I used only one cup of vegetable oil instead and baked in a bundt cake pan. It was delicious. Thank you.

I love this cake! This is my fave cake to make and everyone who tries it, loves it! I do what others have done and use 3/4 applesauce and 1/2 oil instead of what the recipes calls for. I also add pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and extra cinnamon (to taste) to the end mix before I pour it into the pan. I pair it with JJ's cream cheese frosting II.

Everyone that has tried this cake loved it and now has the recipe.  I made it first at Thanksgiving, and have made about 5 of them now and it's only January.

This is delicous! I the following adjusted spices per top reviewers' comments: - a. 2 1/2 tsp of cinnamon b. 1/2 tsp of nutmeg c. 1/2 tsp of ground ginger d. 1tsp of pumpkin spice e. 1/2 c of applesauce and 3/4 c of oil.  I baked mine in a sheet pan for 35 minutes and did not frost with any topping to judge the exact original taste of cake. Also, I want to safe some extra calories from the frosting but the cake really tasted superb without any frosting! It is very soft, most and smelled good.

Very delicious.  I'm serving this for boxing day lunch with a chocolate glaze.  I made mine into mini bundt cakes.  I have to import my pumpkin puree to the UK but it's worth it!

This cake is delicious!! As recommended by other reviewers, I cut down the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I baked it in a 9 x 13 baking pan for 30 minutes. I made a vanilla glaze (recipe on Allrecipes) to put on top. Was great alone or with the glaze.

Wonderful cake. Not quite enough at this scale to make a high cake in that size pan. I scaled it for 18 servings and it's just right. I used the whipped cream cream cheese frosting on this website and added about 1 teas. of cinnamon to the frosting. FABULOUS!!

I made the full recipe in (2) 6-inch round cake pans for layered cakes. Baking time was 44 min. I used the full amount of oil, and it is a little bit greasy, but I think this is necessary since I'll be freezing them before assembly and want them to stay moist. As also stated by others, additional spices are a must! I used 2 tsp van x, 4 tsp cinnamon, 1.5 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cloves, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp salt. They came out perfect. Thanks, Sue!

WOW this is good. I can't wait to make this for company, holidays, teachers, etc. I replaced 1/4 cup of the oil with applesauce. I used 1/4 tsp cinnamon and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. It does fine without frosting (especially with pecans in it) but if you want to indulge I recommend the Cream Cheese frosting II (by Janni) from this site, made with PADDYDOG's changes (increasing vanilla & powdered sugar). The search is over, this is the perfect pumpkin cake & frosting.

I used two 9" round cake pans for this recipe and the only change I made was suggested by other readers: cut oil down to 3/4 c. and add applesauce for the remainder. I noticed the CAN of pumpkin did not specify which size can. I believe it is referring to a 15 oz. can. I had a 29 oz. can and that seemed to be sufficient. Tasted moist and amazing! For a pretty presentation, use sliced almonds as petals for daisies, and your favorite colored M&M's, Resses or Skittles candies for the flowers center.

I served this as a layer cake for my Dad's birthday and got rave reviews..."best cake I've ever tasted","fantastic".  I substituted ginger and cloves for some of the cinnamon and iced it with maple cream cheese icing. It was a huge hit and will definitely make it again and again.

I made this for the first time for a halloween party last night and the reviewers here did not fail me - thank you!! The cake was incredible and SO moist! (I omitted the walnuts and baked it in a bundt pan for 50-55 minutes.)   A number of people asked for the recipe. Taking other reviewers advice, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from here (adding an additional cup of confectioners sugar and doubled the vanilla extract to make it sweet). The combination was a big hit. This has become part of our family recipe collection.

Cake is exceptionally moist and one I will make again. I did read reviews and used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice which I would do again along with maybe another of cinnamon as this needs some spice. I also halved the cream cheese II frosting recipe recommended thankfully because it made enough to cover a sheet cake size cake or I would have had lots left over. I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of spices but really enjoyed this cake and got lots of compliments at work on it. Great moist cake. Thanks!

I have made this 2 times in the last week!  Very yummy.  I made cupcakes for my neighbors and a sheet cake for the family.  I did 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil.  I also added a few spices.  The second time I made it the grocery store was out of regular pumpkin (I couldn't beleive it!) so, I used the pumpkin pie mix and it turned out just as good.  I'll be making this again and again!

I made this for work and everyone is raving about it! It's amazingly moist & very pumpkiny tasting, which I love! I did substitute some ingredients to make it healthier but I'm sure it would be even better made as written. The changes I made are:  Splenda instead of sugar; 1 1/2 cups white flour + 1/2 cup wheat flour; 1 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup veg oil; 2 whole eggs + 1/3 cup egg whites;  plus added extra cinnamon, ginger, cloves & nutmeg to give it more of a pumpkin pie flavor. All these changes aren't required, because the original recipes is definitely 5 stars!

Great recipe.  The first time we made this, we used it as a base for a Thanksgiving themed baked alaska (using dulce du leche and vanilla ice cream, with this as the cake base).  It played to rave reviews.  We also had enough batter left over to make a little cake which we frosted with a basic cream cheese icing.  Both were delicious.  The only changes we made were going with the oil/applesauce combo suggested by other reviewers and leaving out the cinnamon but adding 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

There is so obviously a reason this recipe is rated so highly in a major way. Taste is great, spice combo perfect, very moist what more can you ask for. I did not use nuts and like several other reviewers used half veg oil and half unsweetened applesauce but other than that no alterations were made and it turned out fantastic.

This was a big hit!  Our friend who doesn't like cake ate 3 big pieces!!!  The only change I made was I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II as suggested by others.  A wonderful combination, will make it again.

This was delicious! It was very moist and the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this side finished it perfectly.  If you like your pumpkin cake a little "spicier", add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cloves in addition to the cinnamon.

fantastic! Very moist and flavorful. I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 oil and substituted pumpkin pie mix for the canned pumpkin. It was perfect, baked in a bundt pan for 45 min and topped with warm cream cheese frosting. I will definitely make again. Even my picky boys loved it!

This was just okay. Based on the high rating I expected this to be amazing. I did follow other reviewers' advice and subbed 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil and added a bit of pumpkin pie seasoning. I caught too much baking powder/soda taste. Next time I'll stick with my usual and just use spice cake mix from the store, with a bit of extra cinnamon tossed in. Thanks for the recipe though. **Just an update, the next day, the cupcakes tasted better, but unfortunately not as wonderful as I was hoping.

This is sooooo yummy. I took a few small dowels and poked holes in the top and drizzled a mixture of milk and powdered sugar all over it. I made this cake 3 days ago and it is still super-moist. Goes great with coffee in the mornings. I have had so many requests for this recipe!!

I made this cake over the Thanksgiving Holiday and it was a huge hit.  There wasn't a crumb left.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ground clove....just a preferance with anything pumpkin for me.  I actually had to wash the pan before I left.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving and it made enough for everyone to bring a few slices home!  Delicious and easy to make.  I topped it with the  Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe.

This cake is wondeful. This was my first time making it and everyone raved over it. I used 2 1/2 sticks of butter instead of vegetable oil it still turned out very very moist. Love it with a tall glass of milk.

I followed this recipe exactly except I had the site calculate the servings for about 250 people.  I topped it with a cream cheese icing from this site also.  I used this recipe at work for the Thanksgiving Dinner I have to prepare instead of pie.  It was wonderful and everyone loved it.  I didn't hear one comment about not having pie instead!!!!

This is a great recipe!  I made cupcakes instead of sheet cake, and baked them at 350 for about 22 minutes, and they came out perfect.  I added more spices because I can never get enough, but otherwise stuck to the directions.  Thanks so much!

Absolutely fantastic! I only made the apple sauce modification mentioned by the other reviewers. This was unbelievably moist and so delicious. I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe and it was perfect for this cake. I would say the walnuts are a necessity.

i used this recipe to make cupcakes (2 1/2 dz. exactly) and they were a huge hit. i added more spice to the cake with some 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. i also reduced the oil to 1 cup and used 1/4 orange juice. i frosted the cupcakes using a pumpkin cream cheese frosting recipe i found on the country living magazine site. sooo good!

Really moist and tasty. I added a bit more cinnamon along with some nutmeg and a touch of clove. The cake was still somewhat mild in flavor but it was a nice contrast to the rich, sweet cream cheese icing. I did use the walnuts and think they add a lot to the flavor as well as the texture of the cake. A keeper for sure!

What a tasty moist cake.  Tasted just like a pumpkin pie, just a different texture.  I only made 1/2 a recipe b/c I wanted a small cake.  I baked it in a 9x9" cake pan for 35 min.  I reduced some of the oil and replaced it w/ applesauce.  I thought it needed more spices than just cinnamon, so I followed the spice ingredients on my pumpkin puree can.  I drizzled it w/ cream cheese icing.  Yum.

This made a wonderful cake! A little (or a lot) of extra cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger go beautifully in the batter. Also, If you're frosting the cake a maple/brown sugar buttercream is marvelous.

I too used the 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and it worked out great!  I added in some nutmeg but next time will try pumpkin pie spice (I just didn't have any this time).  I also used the cream cheese icing II from this site and added a bit of cinnamon to that too.  I am the cake maker for birthdays in my office and this cake was gone fast!  Even the guys that claim they don't like cake came back for seconds!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

So good. I made this for a party and it got many compliments. One woman ate three slices. I did substitute 1/3 cup of oil with applesauce. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cloves and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg which I was happy I did because it may have been a bit bland otherwise. Because I love pumpkin and didn't think it had a huge pumpkin flavor I think I may substitute that 1/3 cup of oil with more pumpkin next time instead of applesauce. I made mine in a bundt pan and it did take almost an hour. I topped with cream cheese frosting and it was great!

This cake was wonderful!  I baked it in bowls and put them together to look like a little pumpkin.  I frosted it with orange cream cheese frosting and used some green string sour candy for the vine part.  It tasted great and looked great.  My kids loved it.

very good, very easy, very rich. I cut the oil by adding the applesauce ( this does cut the fat and keep the cake moist), I used the cream cheese frosting II like other reviewers, and though it was very good- I think it was to rich for this cake.  I think next time I will do a simple suger glaze or even fresh whipped cream.  My hubby prefered his plan.  But you judge for yourself you won't regret it.

Sue, we loved this fantastic fall cake! I baked this in a covered cake pan instead of a sheet cake size. It did take a few minutes longer. I used buttercream frosting II on this. The cake didn't need any frosting and was great as it was, but it was a nice finishing touch. Thanks for sharing this cake recipe, it was just right for an autumn treat.

Loved this cake.  Just made a few changes.  2 tsp of baking powder, 4 tsp of cinnamon, baked in 2 9" pans, split the layers and spread thin coating of orange marmalade jelly between the layers.  Frosted outside with cream cheese frosting.  Thanks for the recipe....it turned out great!

Funny thing, I cut the recipe in half... when I realized I only have enough pumpkin puree for 1/4 of the recipe. So I cut the recipe in half again. BUT I accidentally put in 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/4 cup + 1 tbl (I realized this after I baked it). But the results? FABULOUS. This cake is IT. My family loved how light and moist it was and devored it. Oh, I added some freshly ground nutmeg, cloves, and allspice, and finished it off with a drizzle of a simple glaze made of icing sugar + water. Fantastic cake.

This cake is great. I brought it to a family get together and everyone commented that it was good as well and the pumpkin was not too overwhelming.

I made this recipe for me and my son's birthday party.  I made homemade cream cheese frosting and stored in the refrigerator until the party.  It was moist, tasty & fabulous.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I would recommend it highly!

I adapted this recipe for a gluten-free diet and it turned out great.  Anyone that must stay gluten-free knows that alot of times it doesn't work.  I substituted cup for cup kinickkinick all-purpose baking mix for the flour. I lined the pan with parchment paper and sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  I made no other changes.  It came out wonderful! No one would ever guess it was gluten-free.

Absolutely Unbelievable. Didn't make a single change. I used a cream cheese frosting recipie on this site, I believe it was cream cheese frosting II. Everyone loved the cake so much that I had to actually hide a piece or my boyfriend wouldn't have gotten any at all! I'd give this one 10 stars if I could.

Tastes very good and moist. Very much like a carrot cake. That's what some people thought it was when I brought it to a potluck. Not real pumpkin-y if made as written! Next time I think I will add another whole can of the pumpkin and add some spices as recommended by others.

This was a great recipe however mine didn't turn out.  I baked exactly as written in a 13x9 for 30 minutes.  When I pulled it out, it was a perfect color, perfect edges, and a toothpick inserted came out clean.  I was so excited! However, after it cooled for about 15 minutes, the middle sank somewhat and when I tried the toothpick again, this time it did not come out clean.  Next time I will buy a 12x18 pan to make this recipe. However, the parts that were done tasted great and it is a beautiful color.

I made this cake I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and it was wonderful. It is so moist and goes well with a cream cheese icing.

I made this using one cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup sunflower oil.  I did add some pumpkin pie spice after reading the other reviews.   I also cut the sugar some just because I prefer less sugar in my diet.  The cake was very moist and flavorful.

This was the cake my 13 year old wanted for her birthday cake. I made it as a bunt cake (375°F for 45 minutes as that was also the cooking temp for the braised short ribs she asked for dinner.) I made just as the recipe called for, but almond extract instead of vanilla, because my kids used it all and didn’t tell me. It turned out AMAZING! Like lots of recommendations, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II, also with almond extract instead of vanilla. Also AMAZING! We are eating leftovers for breakfast and it was wonderful!

Delicious! Very moist. Baked in Bundt pan for about 45 minutes.  Used 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce in place of oil. Added additional spices as recommended by other reviewers.

Really moist and delicious! Added a teaspoon of allspice then halved the recipe for a loaf pan, baked for about 50 minutes. Came out perfect! Topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar.

Love, love, love this cake! I make it for every family get together and everyone loves it ( even the ones that don't like pumpkin love it).   I make it exactly as recipe says and it turns out perfect! When trying to make a healthier version I have made with half the amount of oil and replaced with cinnamon applesauce. Stills turns out moist and delicious! I top with store bought cream cheese icing. Yummy!

I used 3 cups of cooked pumpkin, 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup applesauce,  no spices and extra vanilla. I cooked the batter in 3; 9" round cake pans. I sprinkled turbinado sugar on each cooled layer. We ate it like that with no frosting. Very moist and tasty.

I've just made this cake and it was outstanding, having almost the taste and consistency of pumpkin pie, but so much faster and easier to make.  I used 1 2/3 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil (no added applesauce),two teaspoons vanilla, two teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 cup golden raisins. Before baking the cake in a 9 x 12 glass baking dish I sprinkled about two tablespoons of brown sugar on top of the batter.  Baking time was approximately 35 minutes.  After the cake had cooled about 15 minutes, I melted 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a glass measuring cup in the microwave and added about 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice, and then enough powdered sugar to make a thin glaze, which I poured over the cake.  A lemon juice glaze would probably also work well, using less juice of course.  My husband loved this and so do I. I'm quite picky about which recipes go into my permanent file but this one definitely makes the grade with the changes I made, which make the cake healthier and I suspect perhaps even more delicious.

This cake was so moist.  I had too small of eggs so increased time by twenty minutes with foil over it so not to burn the edges.  I also used self rising flour so omitted salt and added b.soda only. It rose so nicely and I used my own canned pumpkin too.

I used applesauce instead of oil like others suggested. The cake was very moist, but tasted more like an applesauce cake. I think it needed a few more spices other than just cinnamon.

Delicious!  I did take other suggestions to replace some of the oil with applesauce.  I also used Pumpkin Pie Spice and extra cinnamon.  And finally, made a half recipe and baked it in a 9" square pan since we didn't need another huge desert for Thanksgiving.  Topped with a mild cream cheese / buttercream frosting.  Yum!  Would definitely make again.

I made this recipe for Halloween and it was the best pumpkin recipe so far. I made cupcakes and it made 26. I also did the 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce. I added 1 1/2 tsp cinn 1/2 tsp cloves 1/2 tsp ginger 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Piped beautiful cream cheese frosting swirls on top. I rate this a 5.

First time I ever made a home made cake. It came out amazingly. It took about 40-45 minutes in a glass Pyrex pan. The video is great.

Delicious just as everyone said. The only small changes I made was to reduce the oil based on other comments to 1 cup, added a few shakes of nutmeg, ginger, allspice and cloves.  I made a cream cheese frosting and it was wonderful.  Used a 9x13 pan and cooked about 40 minutes.  Very moist and not heavy.

Very nice, moist cake. I made it for my husband's birthday tonight and he really enjoyed it. It was a bit oily and just a hint of baking soda after taste. I made it in a 13x9 pan and baked it an extra ten minutes due to size of pan and cake wasn't done at 30 minutes. Thank-you for a great recipe. I followed it exactly as written. By the way while this was baking the house smelled amazing of cinnamon and pumpkin.

I followed the recipe and made one bundt cake and six cupcakes with this.  I thought it was good.  I didn't add icing but it would be really good with icing on it.

Yummy. I subbed out 1/2 cup of oil for unsweetened applesauce. Added almost 3 tsp cinnamon and also added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, ginger and allspice. This was a super moist cake and def a keeper! Topped it off with a spiced cream cheese frosting ( 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla, two cups confect sugar and 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice). I baked mine in the largest size Pyrex dish I have for 35 min. The family loved it. Great cake for a cool and cloudy fall day.

This was a great recipe! I did replace some of the oil with apple sauce as other reviewers recommended, and added two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, a teaspoon of cloves and an extra teaspoon (two total) of vanilla. My apple sauce was homemade so very flavorful; altogether the taste was amazing and it disappeared in 18 hours!

OMG!!!!  Every time I make this cake, everyone loves it!  They all want the recipe!  I don't change a thing!  It rates 5 stars with everyone here!  I'm using this recipe to teach my granddaughters how to bake from scratch!  I figure their love for this cake will be the incentive!   ;)

Super moist and just the right amount of pumpkin.    To be a fair reviewer, I followed the recipe as written and it was great.     I did top it with a cream cheese icing.

I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this cake. This cake is SO MOIST, so delicious! I did reduce the amount of oil to 1 cup and I only used 3 eggs (I was trying to make it A LITTLE healthier.) I also frosted it with the Holland Cream (White Cream Filling) from this site. It turned out amazingly well! Rave reviews from everyone! Love it! Will use this as my go-to pumpkin cake recipe.

This is a delicious cake!  The only changes I made were using a fresh pumpkin from my garden instead of canned pumpkin and following the advise of others by using only 3/4 cup of oil along with 1/2 cup of applesauce.   I did not have a handy sheet cake pan, so I used a 9X11 and increased the baking time by 10 minutes.  It turned out perfectly.  I frosted it with vanilla frosting to make more of a dessert, but frosting is totally not necessary as it tastes great by itself.  Oh, and I am allergic to walnuts, so I used pecans.  Thanks for the recipe, I have 7 more pumpkins from my garden to use up!

Best pumpkin cake recipe yet. BUT you really need to take the oil down to only 3/4 cup. You don't need that much and 3/4 cup still makes it really moist. I've made this recipe more than a dozen times and it's always a winner. Just take the oil amount down to 3/4 cup and it's a go!! :-)

I thought this cake turned out great, super moist.  I made it as a bundt and baked for about 45-50 minutes.  I did the 3/4c oil and 1/.2c applesauce that others suggested but left everything else the same.  You could add more spices but it was good as written too.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting, yum!

I'm not a huge fan of this recipe at all. I would however take another shot at it with my modifications. Example 1: Reducing the amount of oil. There was so much oil in this cake that while it's moist....there was oil dripping out of it over the following few days that pooled in the center of the plate. Ew. And I thought it was rather bland. If it was not for the cream cheese frosting that I made with it, I would have just thrown it out. That's just my opinion though...my family ate it all up! LOL.

Caution to those who want to use a bunt pan like the one pictured.  It took much longer than the time listed.  My cake was full of holes from checking and even then the top browned too much and the bottom was still gooey.

I added extra cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and ginger, and I still felt that the pumpkin somehow blandly overpowered the spice.  I was hoping for a strong spice flavor.  I made cupcakes (350 degress for 20 minutes), and I felt that they were a bit denser than I would have liked.  I did decrease oil and added applesauce as others had suggested.  I also used cream cheese frosting II from this site.  Not sure that I will make these again.

I make this and add 1 cup of rasins. I also use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda. It's moist and delicious, and you can't tell it has the Splenda. I keep getting requests to make it all fall and winter long.

This cake was wonderfully moist.  I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil, but left everything else the same.  There are only two of us in the household so I ended up freezing half of the cake and it was even better after being frozen!

Made this recipe for thanksgiving supper, and got lots of good reviews and people going for seconds. I topped it off with a glaze mixing 1/2cup icing sugar and 2 tsp milk. Will definitely be using this one again.

Used this recipe for my then 6 year old to make a cake for the County 4H Cake Auction.  She won Reserve Champion!  It was so good we had her make another one.  Super easy (I help her icing it) that even a 6 year old can make it (with a little help from mom with the mixer). Highly recommend, especially if you like pumpkin!  We used chopped pecans on the top of the icing.

Very nice overall - tasty and moist. I followed the recipe closely except that my can of pumpkin was just 15 oz. (1.5 c.) but that didn't seem to matter. I also added many other spices in varying amounts to taste: allspice, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Would have added cardamon but I tossed my old jar and haven't replaced it yet.I baked it in a bundt and topped it with a vanilla glaze and toasted pecans.  The cake came out a bit darker that I would have liked - not sure if that is due to all the additional spices I added or because I had to bake it over an hour until it was baked through. Will definitely try this again - maybe as a sheet cake to reduce the baking time.

Wonderful!!!     A new favorite.    We used the Cream Cheese Frosting II, and added 1 heavy tsp of cinnamon!      A perfect complement to this delicious cake!

This cake is very good!!! I made it two times in 2 weeks!! I didn't add nuts, but raisins and a little more cinnamon. It was good with or with icing. Most liked without icing and added raisins. I'm going to top with glaze this time and next time make into cupcakes and freeze for lunches and snacks.

Amazing! Took the advice of others and added 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the full 1 1/4 cup oil in the recipe. Wonderfully moist!

I made this cake--WOW it was so moist. I too wanted to cut back on the amount of oil and I used the suggestions of others and used 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce. Do any of you know what is sprinkled on the top of the bundt cake in the photo? I want to take one like this to our church bazaar.

Made this cake 2 weeks ago using the exact same ingredients and it came out perfect. Everyone loved it and had at least 2 pieces each! The only thing I had to do differently is that I baked it for20 extra minutes, probably because my oven heat is off a bit. I will definitely use this again, and will experiment with healthy substitutions for the sugar.

I think this is a nice, moist cake.  I tweaked it for my own taste by adding nutmeg and ginger in addition to the cinnamon.  I reduced the leavening agents though as 5 tsp seemed to be a lot for a cake this size.  I used 2 tsp of b powder and 1 tsp of b soda and it turned out fine.

Very moist! I did use the applesauce, and made them into cupcakes. I have a new oven, so it only took 18 min instead of the suggested 20. Frosted them like pumkins and other Halloween themes. My husband and co-workers loved them!

I followed the main suggestions from the comments, and had a great result. I used the Great Pumpkin Cake Pan though, which drastically altered the cook time; you must do 300-325 for an hour and fifteen minutes.

I made this just because I love pumpkin and everyone LOVED it. It is so good. It's a must try. I did use the walnuts and I did the recipe as written. Perfect. You do not need to add/change a thing. Thanks for sharing this amazing dessert.

I'd give it 10 stars if it was possible. It was incrdible moist cake, my whle family loved it!!. I changed it ever so slightly according to my own taste though. Forexample, I used half n' half white and brown sugar. I used my own fresh cut pumpkin I boiled with cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg and ginger. Also I used only 3 eggs and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. And 3 cups pf all purpose flour. And for last, I made my own glasing out of fresh mandarin zest and juice, mixed with icing sugar, sour cream and trex.

My 12 year old daughter and significant other actually fought over the last piece!  I ended up making this cake three times this holiday season. I used a bundt pan for presentation and that increased the cooking time to about 50 minutes.  Otherwise I made the recipe as is the first two times and it was perfect. My second tasted a little baking powederish, the sifting of the dry ingredients is important I think.  I used a simple cream cheese icing recipe to top it.  So moist, so pumpkiny. FANTASTIC!  Thanks so much for the new holiday tradition!

Followed this recipe to a T and it came out great--extremely moist from all the veggie oil. However, I would have liked for this to have more of a "pumpkin spice" flavor, so next time I will increase the cinnamon and add more spices. I made this as a 2-layer cake and frosted it with cream cheese frosting, then used candy corn pieces to decorate the top. It made for a very festive-looking presentation!

I made the cake with no changes, and it was extremely moist, crumb was very good. I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c the taste was slightly flat (next time I will add and additional 1/4 tsp of salt) and somewhat bland for my liking. I think you should let your personal preference guide you on the amount of "spice" you like in this type of cake. Next time I will add nutmeg and cloves too. This recipe is worth trying!

Delicious! I feel like it needs something to make it a little more spicy; perhaps nutmeg. But that's just a personal preference - this recipe is perfect as is. I used canola instead of vegetable oil. We loved it - thanks for sharing. :)

Love this - so easy and so good.  Followed the recipe exactly except for pan size.  Used 2 square cake pans 1 time and 3 disposable round 6" cake pans another.  Just adjusted the cooking times accordingly.  Very yummy topped with cream cheese frosting!

Very good cake!  I took others' advice and used 1/2 c. applesauce & 3/4 c. oil.  I made it a 3-layer 8-in. round cake.  I used the cream cheese icing, but, even with only 1/2 the amount of sugar, thought it was too rich.  However, I'm not big on sweets.  My husband, whose favorite two food groups are sugar and fat, said the icing is the best part.  He's the baked goods expert around here, and he loves this recipe.

Delicious , moist and just right...not too sweet. However, I would like to try making it with Unsweetened Apple butter next time.  I used 1 & 3/4 cups of sugar only.

First off AMAZING! I made mine into cupcakes. It made exactly 24. Most of the reviews I read said to add applesauce in place of some of the oil, but since I didn't have any on hand I just added 1 cup oil and 1/4 cup water. THey were perfect! I then topped mine with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. A must try for the holidays! My inlaws had 2 each!

SUPER!  I made it for my 4 year olds birthday for the more "adult" cake without icing.  I made it in a bundt pan and cooked it longer and dusted it with powdered sugar.  It was great.  My son actually enjoyed it more than the homemade chocolate cake and icing I worked so hard on...sometimes less is more!  ;)

VERY GOOD!  I made it exactly the way it said, but I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 mins and put Betty Crocker whipped cream cheese frosting - very well received.  It's still warm.  Perfect perfect - make this recipe!

This cake is wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the cinnamon and replacing it with 2 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I just like to have that extra depth of flavor.  Anyway, this cake was very moist and flavorful.  I baked it in a bundt cake pan for approximately 45 minutes.  I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II, from this site, and I mixed in some cinnamon with it too and extra vanilla.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for sharing.

This cake is delicious!  Only change I made was using fresh pumpkin.  It came out very moist.  I also topped it with a cream cheese frosting and the result was a very tasty cake.  I'm making this again tomorrow for my mother's birthday but will have to make some changes to it to make a little bit healthier for her (less sugar/less fat). Will let you know how it turns out.  Thank you Sue for a wonderful recipe!

Just made this and it's awesome! The only thing that I changed was that I used homemade pumpkin puree instead of canned. I also halved the recipe and made cupcakes (I got a dozen, but I also overflowed the pan a bit). I topped it off with some cream cheese frosting and ate two while they were still warm. The pumpkin flavor is subtle and the texture of the cake is very light and moist. Perfect for when you want a taste of fall in the spring since this is an actual cake, and not dense like other recipes that are really more like muffins or a bread. I was afraid the cupcake was going to fall apart in my hand as I was eating it since it was so soft and airy! It's definitely not a spiced cake. The flavors are subtle, but the texture is perfect.

This is the best pumpkin cake/bread I've tried from this site, and I've tried a whole lot of them.  I think I'm finally done trying new pumpkin recipes- I'll stick with this one.  It has a great texture: not too dense, but not too light.  The flavor is wonderful if you follow the suggestions to add extra cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger.  I definitely recommend you make this one with whole wheat flour.  It gives it a nice, hearty texture and doesn't affect the flavor in any way.

The cake was fluffy, but moist, a hard combo to achieve.  I substituted all whole wheat flour, used half the sugar, more pumpkin, then added dark chocolate pieces and pecans.  Basically, it ended up being a high fiber, lower carb/sugar cake and despite my skepticism of healthy , it was really friggin good!

It was eaten by friends in record time.  And raved about.  Who knew this could happen for the healthy version?  I'd reccommend it to anyone.

I've made this cake 4 times since Thanksgiving. My sister-in-law has made her request to have it every Thanksgiving from now on, my Bunco group (11 ladies) requested the recipe after I served it when I hosted, it almost won me 1st place at my office dessert contest and have had a few other others ask for the recipe as well. I only made one slight change...I used 2 - 9" round cake pans and layered them with a homemade cream cheese icing in the center and for coating the whole cake. I was surprised how good it was b/c I don't like pumpkin (and neither do most of the people who ate it and requested the recipe!). It's so moist and has just the right amount of flavor...goes perfectly with homemade cream cheese icing. This definitely stays on my dessert rotation!

Used the following substitutions/additions from other reviewers: 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp ground ginger (14 serving recipe). Topped with store-bought cream cheese frosting and ground walnuts. The recipe made 48+ mini-cupcakes which I brought to church. They disappeared in minutes. Thankfully I had a few extras at home!

I made this recipe for a Halloween Party and recieved rave reviews for it. The only thing I changed (out of necessity)was I only had 1/4 cup of white sugar, so I used brown sugar for the rest.
I paired this with Cream Cheese Frosting II (submitted by JJ), and it was just...amazing.
I'm definitely making this again.

I used 1 cup of canola oil (since that's what I had on hand) and added extra cinnamon. At 30 minutes the cake (batter was split between two 9 inch cake pans) still came out wet when poked, so I baked it for an additional 10 minutes. The result was a nice, moist, soft cake. A bit oily when you first touch it, but the cake was still good, even after being refrigerated for a couple of days. I had frosted both layers with Pillsbury cream cheese frosting, but I think the frosting is too sweet with this recipe. I would like to have added more spices. Overall, a bit oily but good - maybe some powdered sugar or homemade frosting would've been better so you could control the sweetness. Thanks for the recipe =]

This a great cake!  I incorporated other reviewer suggestions in my version by using 1/2 cup of applesauce for part of the oil, 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice,1 tsp cinnamon and Splenda for half of the sugar.  Because I was cleaning out the cupboard,I also threw in a handful of raisins, dried cranberries and chocolate chips.

I made Halloween cupcakes with this recipe and used Cream Cheese Frosting I to decorate them.  Turned out amazing - not too sweet, but very flavorful.  I don't have a clue how long I baked them, I just kept an eye on the oven and the wafting scent of pumpkin in my kitchen.  Great recipe.

Soooo good!  I used mostly applesauce and little bit of oil, and a mix of wholewheat and regular flour.

Topped with bourbon creamcheese frosting from this website.  So tasty- I'm going to make little buntcake versions of these for thanksgiving...

Really tasty! I doubled the cinnamon, used 1 C applesauce + 1/4 C Country Crock, substituted 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour + 1/2 C white flour.... Smells great and has a light, fluffy texture. It's a bit more of a sweet bread than cake, though.

Moist Cake!!! I did like others and topped it with homemade cream cheese frosting. My 5 year old who "hates" anything pumpkin asked for a second serving. Great, I have some Holiday parties coming up that will require me to bring a dish, and this will be one!

I made three of these this evening.  I made one for my family, one for a church potluck dinner and one for my neighbors as a "Thank You".  This cake is soooo good. I would have to say it is the best homemade cake I have ever made.  I only made a few small changes.  I subsituted cinnamon apple sauce for the oil and I used 2-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  I also baked it in a bundt pan and found that it takes about 50 minutes.  It turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.  KEEPER!!

I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce plus a little extra pumpkin. Very moist and yummy. I also added a little extra spice as I enjoy a bit more flavour. My husband doesn't usually like anything thats not chocolate but he told me this is really good.

This cake was amazingly moist. I brought it to work and my co-workers literally scraped up the crumbs.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I used my own cinnamon cream cheese frosting which topped the cake perfectly!  I also sprinkled on fall colored mini non-pareils for decoration...it was beautiful!  I can't wait to use this recipe again.

I read a lot of the comments about this recipe before making it. I did use the 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce like a lot of others. The cake turned out very moist, so I feel like if I had used the 1 1/4 cup oil, it would have been too greasy. This is a delicious recipe and goes great with coffee in the morning! I used the cream cheese frosting II but I did add about 1/2 cup cool whip to the recipe as well. It turned out very light and delicious!! (I also used the optional walnuts in the cake and then sprinkled a little on top of the icing as well. MMMMMM!)

So-o-o-o-o moist and melt-in-your-mouth-ish!  I used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, I also used the spice combo from my fave pumpkin pie in this cake as the cinnamon didn't seem flavourfull enough; not a crumb left!

This cake is incredible.  I only used 3/4 cup of oil and used extra cinnamon and added cloves because I love that spicy taste.  It turned out SO good!!!

I had to make 19 cakes.  I was only able to make 6 carrot cakes n got tired of grating carrots.  Looked here for pumpkin cake recipe n thought I'd try this one.  Got nothing but rave reviews for this cake.  Had 10 cans of pumpkins so I made 10 of these bringing my count to 16 cakes.  If you love carrot cake, this is definitely the next best thing to carrot cake without the work.  thanks for recipe

Moist and delicious pumpkin cake! I omitted the walnuts in the cake and baked it in a bundt pan. Then I frosted it with cream cheese frosting with walnuts in it. Delicious! Even better the next day!

This cake was incredibly good! At first, I was a little worried by the lack of butter, but it worked out great! Everyone - including my very picky brother - adored this cake.
Thanks so much!

Very easy prep time (this comes from an inexperienced baker!) and easy ingredients. Had to make for pot luck without nuts or topping and was still a hit!

This cake tastes like a carrot cake without the carrots, and it is the moistest cake I've ever eaten.  It was very easy to make and was rated highly by my guests.

Great cake! I baked this for our annual company Thanksgiving potluck and received many compliments on how moist it was. I baked it in a 13x9 adjusting the baking time and frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake for my annual halloween party and it was just amazing.  It was so moist.  I made it in a regular 9x13 pan and had no leftovers.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

Best ever! I also used the 3/4 oil 1/2c applesauce. I added a few chocolate chips but my husband said it didn’t need it and it was the best cake he’s had in his life. I too added extra pumpkin spice seasoning as I wanted more kick. I didn’t add nuts as I didn’t have any, but will try next time. Not too dense, not too fluffy and not too sweet. I used the cream cheese frosting II from this site as well. This recipe is a keeper. It also took 45 min to bake.

I love this recipe! I tweaked mine just a hair; like others, I subbed half the oil for unsweetened applesauce. I also left out the walnuts due to personal taste. Lastly I added 1tsp of ground nutmeg. I used a Bundt pan, so my bake time was closer to an hour almost. But the cake came out super moist, and slightly more dense than I was expecting. Even without topping, I imagine it would’ve tasted divine! I didn’t taste it, however, until I made a cream cheese frosting, warmed the frosting in a microwave, and poured over my Bundt cake. I dusted the frosted cake with more cinnamon and nutmeg before serving. It was the highlight of dinner! Of all the delicious food we had, everyone was talking about this cake!

The texture and taste came out just tight.  However the consistency was terrible.  I baked the cake 15 minutes longer than indicated. 30 minutes what I he review said.  I baked it for 45 minutes.

THIS WAS EPIC! I took a lot of these reviews into consideration,  so here's what I changed.. I replaced most of the oil with butter, I used 1 tablespoon of Kraken Dark Rum, and 1 tablespoon of  Witches Brew wine for those rich flavors. I added 1/4 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I paired it with whipped cream cheese frosting I also got from Allrecipes, and it's just amazing.  Not a big fan of Pumpkin pie, never have been,  however, I am the #1 fan of this cake! I got excited and forgot to take a picture, cuz everyone was ready to dig in. If I could give this 10 stars I would!

I agree with the other comments - the recipe as-is is much, much too oily. I cut the oil down to 3/4 c. and used 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce, and it was still much too moist. I also replaced the cinnamon with 3 tsp Penzey's cake spice. 

The next time I make this, I'm going to reduce the eggs to 3 and cut the oil even more.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and the other reviewers are right--way too much oil. So the second time I used 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce, and it was so much better!! Super moist. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of only cinnamon and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.

Made it as written plus extra spices. It was good, but more soggy than cake-like. Frosting helped, but don’t think I’ll be making it again.

I did what similar people did — 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce. The walnuts were great for added texture. Upped the spice - 3 tsps cinnamon, 1 tsp all spice and 1 tsp nutmeg. But I could up the spice even more. Used a bunt cake pan and baked it for 52 min on 350 - turned out super moist but cooked through. Cream cheese frosting II paired beautifully.

I went with people’s comments to 1/2 the oil and use applesauce for the rest. Also, used the cream cheese II recipe for the frosting. It was delicious but I think I’ll cut back on the baking powder and soda next time, as it made it rise more like bread than a sheetcake.

This cake was fabulous! It worked well with my home made pumpkin purée I thawed and drained from the freezer. I did as suggested and used 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c apple sauce. I used 1 heaping tbsp cinnamon as we love it, and a tbsp of nutmeg, plus 1 tsp ground cloves. I also added 1/2c each nuts, raisins and shredded unsweetened coconut. My grandson loved it! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! My kids ask for this as their birthday cake. It’s a family favorite. I make this with no changes (other than excluding nuts).

I've made this recipe several times, exactly as written. Every time I do, I frost it with cream cheese frosting, and it always gets rave reviews. Definitely a keeper!

I made this cake for our family Christmas dinner. It was moist and delicious. I substituted 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.I followed everything else as in the recipe. I used a cream cheese glaze on top.  It is better made two or three days ahead of time and refrigerated to sit and let the flavors meld. It will keep in the fridge for a week. It also freezes well. I hope you will enjoy it as much as we did!

I made some changes, because I always do.  I used .75c coconut oil. Also, the cans of pumpkin in Canada are 796ml. So roughly 26oz. I ended up just using all of it. To the flour  I added 2tsp cinnamon, 2tsp ginger, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp nutmeg,  1 tsp clove.  The cake turned out amazingly moist, and flavourful.  Next time I'll also drizzle top with melted chocolate. Thank you for the amazing idea!

I made this recipe exactly as written with no changes and I thought it was excellent. I had no issue with it being oily or greasy. I baked in a 9x13 for 40 minutes and topped with cream cheese frosting spiced with cinnamon & ginger.

The cake itself can definitely handle more spices and next time I will add more - but it is still tasty as written.

I added 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, & 1.2 tsp, pumpkin pie spice.  I also used only 3/4 cup of oil, along with 3/4 cup applesauce.  MY HUSBAND SAID THIS WAS THE BEST CAKE HE HAD EVER HAD, and believe me, I've made a LOT of cakes over the years, which he always loved! But he's never said this before! He and my sons devoured it and begged me to make another one!  It has now become a family favorite, for sure.

I did the same substitutions as others have advised:  add applesauce for part of the oil, add pumpkin spice, add 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and everyone raved about the cake being very moist and delicious.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers regarding using ½ cup of applesauce, extra cinnamon, ¼ tsp of ginger and ½ tsp of ground cloves.  I will make again, but will use ¾ cup of applesauce and reduce the oil to ? cup as it was still too oily.  Also, I'd increase cinnamon even more and do ½ tsp of ginger and ¾ tsp of ground cloves.  I'm sure this would taste even better with a glaze.  I only used powdered sugar when I served.  It is a very moist cake and not too sweet at all.  I look forward to baking this again!

I supplemented regular flour with King Arthur gluten free flour, added 1/3 cup vanilla pudding mix, and butterscotch chips instead of walnuts. Delicious and a Thanksgiving dessert win!

This was pretty yummy!!  I used pump pie spice instead of ground cinnamon and I baked mine in a bundt pan (be careful not to fill too much or it could overfill in the oven).  I had to bake it for close to an hour.  Then once it was out of the pan and cooled, I brushed it with a simple syrup to keep it moist and let it sit for a while.  I topped the cake with a cream cheese icing and left in the fridge overnight (as it tends to be more moist the next day).  YUMMMMM!

Made as written except I added 1/4 t cloves, 1/2 t ginger, 1/4 t nutmeg. I also subbed 1 c unsweetened applesauce for part of the oil. Was very moist and delicious. Almost tasted like Libby's pumpkin pie. Everybody loved it. Topped with fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream. To me, I could slightly taste the baking powder. Might reduce that a bit next time. Recommend if you are looking for a pumpkin cake.

I made this with 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil as suggested in other reviews.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of allspice and ground cloves and left out the nuts as it was for a church dinner and did not want any allergy issues.  It was a huge hit and will definitely make it again. I used a frosting made with 1 cup milk and 5 tablespoons flour cooked to mashed potato consistency, covered, then chilled in fridge overnight.  Then you beat in 1 cup granulated sugar and 2 sticks of butter a tablespoon at a time until light and fluffy.  This  frosting compliments the cake well-light and not overly sweet. Very yummy!

As is, I didn't care for the cake because of all the oil and not much flavor. So that is what my star rating is for. However, with changes it was a 4 at least. I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the vegetable oil. I think you could easily do 1/2 cup oil.  I added 1 tsp. pumpkin spice.  Next time I will probably add 2 tsp. pumpkin spice. I put it in a 9x13 for 35 minutes.  I paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (by Janni) from this website.

Made this for my son’s 8th birthday by his request- added a little extra cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger....also used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 3/4 veg oil.... to die for! (Left out walnuts since my son isn’t a huge fan of walnuts...) made a sugar glaze w/food coloring orange... orange butter cream in middle (I make occasion cakes as a side gig so I had some stored and leftover) - it’s going to be a huge hit! 50 minutes at 350 in bundt pan!

I'd give it FIVE stars if only I'd followed the recipe to a T.  

I heeded the advise of others and cut the oil to 3/4 c., and added 1/2 c. of applesauce, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, a half teaspoon of cloves and a teaspoon of pumpkin spice.

It was incredibly delicious - five star worthy.  I gave it four stars only because I didn't follow completely.  Not sure if that's fair or not...  :/

I added my favorite pumpkin spice mix 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/4 tsp clove. I baked in a 13x9 and frosted with maple cream cheese frosting. Tasted just like the best pumpkin roll in cake form??

This is a delicious cake.  I used a cup of oil instead of what it called for.  The 4 eggs and the reduced oil are enough.  I also added nutmeg (1/2 tsp) and cloves (1/4 tsp) reduced the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.  It doesn’t need frosting but if you’d like, I would suggest a lemon frosting or cream cheese frosting.  This cake stands alone without the added sugar frosting!  Good recipe!

Very moist and flavorful, as well as filling! Does well as a muffin. However, i did double the vanilla extract to 4 tablespoons as well as added 1 teaspoon of both nutmeg and cloves

Delicious and moist! Followed recipe as is, with the exception of a bit more cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg and cloves.  I made it in a bundt pan, and added chocolate chips to make it a good snack cake for lunches. Mmmmmm! No icing/glaze required!

This was wonderful! I added more spices (pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon).  I also baked it in a 9X13.  It was super moist and paired wonderfully with cream cheese frosting! Will make again!

I baked in a 9x13 for a thicker, dense cake and it was the most delicious, moist cake I've ever made....and I love discovering a truly moist cake! It took closer to an hour to bake and I covered with foil toward the end of the bake so the color on top would not be over brown. Absolute perfection....even without frosting! I'll make this again and again and again. The kids couldn't get enough!

I have been making this cake for years and it's  a hit every time. I always use real pumpkin (instead of canned - freeze in 2 cup portions) whole white wheat flour and palm sugar for  a healthier version. I have substituted the oil for butter or applesauce and any way you make it comes out delicious although the applesauce gives a slightly spongier texture. Last time I substituted 1 cup of pumpkin for zucchini and added lemon zest and was also delicious. Its hard to go wrong with this simple recipe!

This was delicious and very moist. Everyone loved it. I did cut the oil to only 1 cup, added 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp ginger.  Used an 11 x 13” glass Pyrex baking dish and baked for 40 mins.

It was (is) wonderful! I substituted 2 cups of Stevia for the 2 cups of sugar. And I substituted 1 cup of milk chocolate chips for the walnuts! It came out awesome! My diabetic wife can eat it. I did not use any frosting, and it is great straight up! I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe! I did modify a bit: 3/4 cup of sunflower oil, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon,  1 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground gloves. Was a household hit! Thanks a bunch.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the oil to 1 c. I did not mix nuts into the batter but rather lightly sprinkled a small amount on top before baking. This cake stands on its own and was scrumptious even without frosting or dusting with sugar.

It was loved by all.  I plan to add just a bit more salt next time, but this is a fantastic recipe.  Even my husband, who does not like cinnamon or "spice" cake thought this was delicious, and my sister asked me for the recipe.

Great, Moist Cake.  I only used 3 eggs and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup apple sauce like another reviewer said.  I baked it in a 9X13 pan for 45 minutes.

This cake is wonderful. Moist and delicious, I made a few alterations as suggested by the other reviewers. I baked in a Bundt form and I went with 1/2 cup of oil to 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and added 4 teaspoons of pumpkin spice, 1/4 teaspoons of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoons of ground cloves. I also changed walnuts to pecans. Used JJ's Cream Cheese Icing II, Served this at Thanksgiving, It was gone before the traditional pies.

42 min in my oven in a bundt pan, used 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 c oil.  Very moist and good, consider a 9x13 next time

Good with cool whip or ice cream, but I bet a cream cheese frosting would be amazing.

It was so moist! Everyone loved it. I made it with the oil + applesauce. I didn’t have cream cheese for the frosting so just sprinkled powdered sugar on top. I served the slices with Cool Whip on top. Mmmmm! It’s a keeper recipe!

AMAZING!!!  I used half the sugar the recipe called for, an entire 14oz can of pumpkin (which is a little more than the 2 cups it calls for, 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp cinnamon. 

I baked it in 2 loaf pans lined with parchment paper, and the timing was for about 35 min. 

This is now our "go-to" recipe!

I didn't actually eat any of this cake, but it got rave reviews at a church function. My husband said that he had a few slices. Instead of two cups of pumpkins, I just used one small can. Although a bit shy of the two cups recommended, it was enough. I also made this in a Bundt pan, so it took closer to 50 minutes.

really super moist, even with just 3 eggs!
only subs I made, pumpkin spice for cinnamon and some yogurt/apple sauce for part of the oil.

I baked in tube pan- took way too long to cook and thus got dark on top. next time, will follow instructions and bake in sheet pan.

does taste better with some icing!

I made this and it was a treat! Added some pecans and walnuts into the mixture and my husband has a sweet tooth so I increased the sugar by half a cup. I used the bundt pan and it was nice and thick and fluffy. My daughter sprinkles

I made it exactly as the recipe shows. I used a bundt pan and ended up lightly covering with foil during the last 15 minutes to ensure the middle was cooking through. This cake is very rich and moist. Tastes great, even better the next day out of the fridge!

Wow, what a scrumptious cake!  This was such an easy and quick cake to make.  It is so moist and not overly sweet.  Will add nuts next time for a little extra.  Topped it with cream cheese frosting.  Total hit with everyone!

Outstanding!  I added a little more spice and frosted with a basic cream cheese frosting.  My SO asked me to please get it out of the house or he was going to eat the whole thing!  I brought the rest to work the next day and it was devoured!!  I will absolutely make this again and again!!

It's a good cake, and I love the cream cheese frosting. Next time I'll try the veggie oil unsweetened apple sauce split. 
I'm definitely making it again.

It was yummy.  Everyone loved it.  I cut the oil to 1/2cup and added 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Also added cloves and nutmeg spices to the recipe.  Frosted it with Basic cream cheese frosting sprinkled with chopped pecans.

Really moist & flavorful! I used fresh pumpkin purée which is more watery than canned pumpkin, so I made some changes. 
2 1/2 c homemade pumpkin purée,
3/4 c oil,
3 large eggs (versus 4 lg) or 4 small farm eggs (the latter is what I used),
2 tbsp pumpkin spice (omitted cinnamon),
1 c brown sugar ( I used truvia brown sugar blend) & 1 c white sugar .
Baked 350 degrees for 40 mins in a 13x9 dark aluminum pan. 

Used cream cheese frosting:
1 cup powder sugar,
1 8oz cream cheese (room temp),
1 stick butter (room temp),
1 tsp vanilla,
Mix together & spread on cooled cake.

I followed the recipe exacty, sans walnuts. I made it in a sheet pan, as the recipe calls (more pieces for my family) and keep in mind your oven. I cooked mine for 25 minutes and it was done. Topped with Cream Cheese II frosting on this site. Soooooo delicious! Loved it. Would also be fabulous with whipped cream on top.

It was great after I tweeked the recipe a little. I also used 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, as other reviews suggested. I added more spices too. I will definitely make this again.

Followed others rec for substituting   3/4 C applesauce & 1 C oil. Baked  1/2 in Bundlette pan for 25 min, and the rest in a small Heritage 6 C bundt pan for 35 min. Perfect! I used the glaze from the Pumpkin recipe.

Very good recipe. I only put 1 cup of grape seed oil and only 1 1/2 of sugar. Also added raisins.  Out of this recipe I made 10 cup cakes and one pound cake size   
I would make it again.

I made this as written only I added a little extra pumpkin because I used fresh and I added a 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Really great flavor.  I used the amount of oil indicated in the recipe and I thought it was just the right amount.

Although I changed the recipe slighlty by cutting the oil down a bit and adding nutmeg and cloves, I rated it 5 stars because the cake itself was so light and delicious. I have been baking for 37 years and this cake rivals pumpkin pie!

I've made this twice, once as written and once substituting 1/2 c. melted butter for 1/2 c of oil. Both times the cake was delicious and moist. Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon, which was fantastic! I'll definitely be making this again, and not just in the fall! Edit: For making into a layer cake, double the recipe.

I loved this pumpkin recipe, best cake I ever made! I did this in a sheet pan and made my own glaze icing. I used unsalted butter to grease the pan and it came out beautifully. I used all organic ingredients and added extra spices as well. So happy to have found this, thank you for sharing!

This cake is a keeper! I made for a get together and everyone loves it and wanted to take some home. The only things I did differently were to reduce the oil by 1/2 cup and use 1/2 cup applesauce instead and I added a tablespoon pumpkin pie spice. Paired with cream cheese frosting III from this site as others have suggested. This recipe was very easy as well. Will be making this again and again. Thanks!!

Oh, my, this was delish! I used coconut oil and only a cup because it can be heavy. The pumpkin flavor with cinnamon was nice. I added a brown sugar streusel topping. Baked in bundt pan for about 50 minutes. I'd serve this to anyone.

my family loved it ! I did add some pumpkin spice and nutmeg and glad I did as even after doing so, it still could've used more flavor bang.  I didn't have veg oil so I used coconut oil. I will try half apple sauce next time. This recipe is a keeper ! Thank you!

I too followed advice and only used 1/2 c. oil (I only had olive oil and probably could have used less).  I followed AshleyC's advice and added 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce.  I did not buy pumpkin pie spice but added about 1/8 tsp of each of its ingredients which are clove,  ginger, allspice, nutmeg. I rated this recipe as it would be without alterations. I also used Creme Cheese Frosting II "sans alterations" and it's delicious!

I was sleeping over at  a friend's house, so I brought them half a bunt-sized cake. Their family consumed it in literally 45 minutes. Each with at least 3 pieces total. So, obviously, this is an OUTSTANDING cake. I wanted Pumpkin bread, and this is a healthier alternative. (I know, right? Like, what? But it is!) And because I'm a health freak, I substituted the sugar for honey, and used (SIFTED) Einkorn flour.

O.M.G.  This cake was Amazing!!! I didn't have any applesauce so I made it as written, although I added half a bag of mini chocolate chips at the end with the walnuts.  I think I have a new favorite cake ?? and everyone who tried it raved about how good it was. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for a perfect cake recipe.

I've made this cake for a couple of years now and I always get compliments; my friends and family LOVE them.  I've done variations with chocolate and cocoa but I always top with cream cheese icing.  The main reasons why this recipe does not get 5 stars are because, first, it is an oily cake and so every time I make it, I have to reduce the oil and then the consistency is perfect!  I also add extra spice depending on my mood, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla extract, etc.  Finally, this makes a LOT of batter and it is not easy to reduce the recipe so if you're looking for a standard 9X13 recipe, look elsewhere.

Like someone else said, I found this a little too oily.  Next time I am going to try to use milk for that 1/4 cup and use only a cup of oil.  The batter flavor was too bland with just the cinnamon, so I added 1/2 tsp of ginger, 1/2 of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  It was much more tasty that way.

I made one critical change to this recipe,  I added 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. This cake was a huge hit with the family, and they begged me to make it again for Christmas.  I can see where the amount of oil used would make this cake greasy, and there are enough calories in it as is! Take my advice and substitute the applesauce, and you will be delighted. I also used  some extra spices, 1/2 teaspoon each of ginger and nutmeg and ground cloves. Definitely a keeper in my personal recipes!

It's a good starting point but is kinda bland.
Changes: I used 1 cup of melted butter instead of oil, added  nutmeg, ginger and cloves, glazed it with a vanilla glaze, and topped it with crushed ginger snap cookies. 
I am going to make donuts using this recipe for Christmas Eve. I know Santa will appreciate them!

I resisted all temptation to alter this -- and I normally double or triple spices -- and my cake-loving hubby said it was PERFECT!!! Made it for school function; baked in bundt pan (took 50+ min to bake) and simply dusted with powdered sugar.  Texture was perfect -- light but not overly airy and NOT greasy/oily as others have complained -- and subtle pumpkin flavor was the star.  I worried that using a standard 15 oz. can of pumpkin would be insufficient (since it's 1 oz or 2 Tbsp less than what's called for), but it was fine.  Will def make again.

Made this recipe to the "t". Very very moist. Awesome naked! great base cake for variations with fruits and nuts. If you make this cake in a deeper pan, increase baking time. If you check prematurely, the middle will sink. Be patient! It's worth the wait ??

Absolutely amazing! My family and friends loved it. So moist and easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly only substituted sugar. Spices were just the right amount. I replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup truvia baking blend and it worked great! I will definitely keep this recipe for future use.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  In the past I usually skip the sifting part of any dry ingredients, but I sifted all dry ingredients this time and I do believe it made a difference.  This can definitely be eaten without frosting, but I did add a light cream cheese frosting and so glad I did!

This was delicious cake and easy to make! We made it for my daughter's birthday this past October and it may become tradition to bake it for her every year. I hate cream cheese frosting, though, so I made the chocolate frosting recipe on my box of Hershey's cocoa powder. We worried the chocolate and pumpkin might clash but it was good, IMO!

I didn't quite put as much oil but increased my spices.  Still very moist.  I don't think I much like it with the canned pumpkin, tho. I will try fresh roasted next time.

Followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3/4c oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. You would never know the difference! I think using all the oil would probably make it too oily. The cake turned out so moist and delicious. I also added extra spices and topped it with cream cheese frosting. Will make again!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for one of my co-workers who had a birthday that day. I made a slight change and switched out the vegetable oil for butter. It took a shorter amount of time to make the cupcakes, and I ended up using the batter for two dozen cupcakes.

Addictive.  Like many other reviewers, I cut back on the oil (3/4c oil) and used a 1/2c applesauce and also added nutmeg.  I used a rectangular cake pan and it was done in 30 mins.  It was the perfect density for a cake.  Really flavorful.  I only sprinkled top with a dusting of powdered sugar;  I didn't feel it needed frosting.  My kids inhaled it, which is really saying something since they usually only eat cakes that are heavily frosted (even then, they often only eat the frosting and leave the cake)!

Brilliant recipe. Although I changed it a bit. I used 1/3 of suggested oil and used butter not oil. I didn't add salt but the butter was salted anyway. I also used fresh pumpkin purée. A medium size flesh of pumpkin to leave an inch flesh into the pumpkin for Halloween carving.  the Don't be scared to use more cinnamon if You like flavours. Very good texture and very light. Made it into cupcakes and my little one decorated them for Halloween.

Accidentally put sugar with dry ingredients—still turned out fabulous! I doubled the recipe and used 1.5 c oil and 1 c applesauce. Tasted like pumpkin roll with much less work!

I made this cake and got rave reviews. I suggest substituting part of the vegetable oil with applesauce, as I had a slice of the cake on a napkin and within a short time there was a big oil spot around it. I added some ground ginger, allspice, and nutmeg as well to make it more flavorful. I baked it 50 minutes in a bundt pan and it came out very pretty.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. To make it healthier, I use 1 cup of applesauce, 1/4 cup of oil, and 1/4-1/2 cup of ground flax seed. I also add 1/2 of bran. You could probably omit the flax seed with no problems. Sometimes I also add ginger and nutmeg to the spices.

Great base to start with. Had I not made changes, it would be quite bland & floury. I did 3/4 cup of oil & 1/2 cup unsweetened Apple sauce. I also added 1.5 tsp of nutmeg & an additional tsp of cinnamon. After baking I put in the freezer right away for 30 minutes to lock in moisture then cover with seran wrap back in the freezer  if not using it right away. .

So moist and delicious! This cake doesn't need frosting, however I made Cream Cheese II frosting from this site and added pumpkin pie spices. I put the frosting on the side as an option. I will make this again!

Other than using fresh pumpkin puree from last fall I chose to do 1/2 light olive oil and 1/2 homemade applesauce (5/8 cup each), since my pumpkin was fresh I added 1/2 tsp each cloves and ginger. I omitted the nuts since this is a cake and used 1 cup dark chocolate chips instead. I only had a 8 x 12 glass pan so baking has taken 45 min instead of 30min(thicker). Very Good! Topped it with a cream cheese frosting. This ones goes in my saved recipes!

Great recipe. I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves rather than 2 tsp cinnamon and only 3 eggs. Made it in a loaf pan and it took about twice as long to cook, but came out so moist, not oily at all (tinfoil on top 1/2 way through cooking to keep it from burning on top). Everyone in my family loved it. Will definitely make it again!

Great Recipe as is! Because my Wife has diabetes I also tried it with 1C Brown sugar and the equivalent of one cup stevia(24 packets). I also used 1/2 C oil and 3/4C unsweetened Apple sauce. I reduced the nuts to 1 /2 C. I like 1T of Pumpkin pie spice plus 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and I would love a touch of clove but my daughter is allergic so I did not add it. This is a keeper with either version! Thanks!

Easy to put together for a delicious homemade treat.  My only sub was to use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1 1/4 cup oil.  I spread most of the batter in a 9x13 pan and finished the rest in a six inch diameter round cake pan.   We got to sample the cake and still had a whole one for guests!  Used cream cheese frosting.  I am glad that people make changes to recipes and post reviews anyway...I would not have made this with all that oil.  Thanks for the information about using applesauce and oil, and even less than called for.  It worked fine the way I did it.   I cannot understand why people do not want to know about substitutions to recipes.

I am sure the reason it stays so moist is all the oil in it but this is the best recipe of all.

So I followed the recipe exactly except for a few things... In addition to the vanilla flavoring I also added some imitation butter and imitation maple extract- a flavor combo I thought would be appropriate, and it was! Another thing: by the time I had the batter all poured into the pan, I realized: I forgot the eggs!!! "@&$#%¥^!!!! I thought it was ruined but I put it in the oven anyway (baked mine in a bundt pan, took about 50 min to cook at 350F), took it out and it was fine! Veerrrryyyy moist, which was okay with me. Drizzled it with cream cheese icing. Yum!

Texture is more like muffin than cake or loaf. Cake had larger crumbs and was really moist compared to other cake I've baked. It's also not as dense as a loaf. Not bad and may make again if I have left over pumpkin.

WOW. Is how I explain it. Gotta try it second of all. I took everyone elses advice. I did 1/2 c. oil, 3/4 c. apple sauce, and I think I added just about every spice in my house made for sweets. All spice, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger. Then I matched it with a creamy cream cheese frosting. Not overly sweet. Topped mine with pecans and ate a HUGE slice of cake.. My only issue, is it took forever to cool, even had to put it in my freezer. Would do it again and again, and this will be a staple in my kitchen for years to come. THANK YOU. If my grand-ma were here, she would ask me for this recipe. Reminds me of love and home. God Bless Karen

Easy and delicious. I did substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil and it worked and tasted great. I lightly drizzled chocolate sauce on top, but it didn't need it for flavor, I did it for a more 'finished' look.

This is a great recipe. As a long time pumpkin fan and a very novice baker, this is one of the easiest and tastiest desserts I've come across. I took the advice of others and traded out the oil for 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup of apple sauce and that gave it the perfect moist texture. I also added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice, an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract, and used cake flour rather than all purpose. I baked it in a bundt pan for 55 minutes and topped it with powdered sugar. Everyone who's tasted it has loved it - it went so fast I had to make another the next day! Try it warm in a bowl of vanilla ice cream - it will knock your socks off.

I made this recipe with fresh pumpkin just to use up pumpkins my Mom gave me and was so impressed I've made it twice more!  My husband doesn't usually like pumpkin but he loves this recipe.  His best friend went crazy for this and asked me about making more repeatedly for a few months so we made him his own cake.  He was thrilled.  I follow the advice of other reviews and do the following: on the applesauce - start with about 1 1/2 cups then strain all the excess liquid off for about 10 minutes to get about 3/4 c of thicker sauce.  Use that with 1/2 c. oil (or vice versa on amts) as an oil substitute.  Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/4 tsp ground fresh ginger.  Bundt cake = 40-45 min, Cupcakes = 18-20 min.
This recipe is even more awesome with a cream cheese icing that has either orange or lemon zest mixed in!  I use Cream Cheese Icing II from this site.

I loved this recipe, but what i did was dump all the ingredients in a large bowl and mixed, it came out pretty thick so i added some water, i cant say how much because i just poured a little at a time mixing after each addition of water till the mix was like pancake like consistency, loved it, nice and moist!

I followed other suggestions and substituted 1/4 applesauce for part of the oil. I also added in a small container of spiced pumpkin whipped cream cream cheese spread I had on hand as a way to use it up. I used 3 teaspoons of Penzys pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices called for, otherwise made as noted. I goofed on the pan size (mine was too large) and ended up marbling this with a boxed yellow cake mix to fill the pan. This was a happy accident and it made a very pretty and unique cake.

Cake was moist and flavorful with a good crumb. Moist but not overly heavy or dense. Pumpkin-y and spicy without being overwhelming. I frosted the this with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting mixed with a little Cool Whip vanilla frosting I had on hand. Very very good. Bookmarked this to make again.

Really good, gave it only four stars as is because followed the advice of other reviewers and cut oil in half and used two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I didn't replace the oil that I cut out with apple sauce as some reviewers did and it was still perfectly moist.

I made these into mini cupcakes and piped a small amount of cream cheese icing on top.  Very tasty - I added a small amount of allspice, and nutmeg and baked for 9-13 minutes.  Yummy!

This cake is moist and easy to make.  I didn't even follow the directions I just threw everything in a big bowl and blended. It came out perfect.  I added cream cheese frosting and everyone loved it.

I made it almost exactly as directed in the original recipe. The only differences were I had used a real pumpkin that ended up being approximately 2.5C instead of just the 2C indicated and I added 2t of Pumpkin Pie Spice with the cinnamon. I did have to bake it for about 10 extra minutes (probably because of the extra pumpkin/moisture).

It's SO yummy and delicious! Om nom nom nom!

I cut back on the sugar by 25%, used 1/2 c of apple butter instead of sauce or the full 1 1/4 c of oil and added more spices including black pepper.  I was happy with the results.

I made cupcakes with this recipe and they came out great. I scooped out the center, filled with a spoonful of pumpkin mousse, frosted with cream cheese frosting and topped it off with a pecan half and candied ginger. Big hit with my family!

Follow the advice! I halved the recipe, halved the oil, added the remainder in applesauce and also made cupcakes. Instead of frosting I used a glaze made with apple cider bourbon. It was wonderful!

I changed this to a low fat version. I used 3 egg whites and 1 whole egg. Only 1/2 C oil. 1 C sugar and 1/2 C maple syrup. I also added 2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground clove. Cool cake brush on maple syrup. I made an easy icing from powdered sugar. (would be great without the icing too)!

These are so moist and delicious. I added pumpkin spice rather than cinnamon and a cinnamon spice butter cream on top. i made them as cupcakes for a family gathering and they were a hit.

This is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly but I made cupcakes instead of cake. It made 24 cupcakes, and I baked them about 25 minutes. They are very flavorful, and not too sweet. I topped mine with cream cheese icing and a sprinkle of cinnamon, yummmmmm!

This got such great reviews from family and friends at Thanksgiving. I made it as the recipe but I put 3/4 cup oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves...It made 24 medium sized cupcakes. It took 25-30 min in 350 degree Celsius oven. Would definitely make this again....it was so moist. Then piped some cream cheese frosting on top....was delicious!

Very very good. Many other users stated they baked this in a 9x13 pan. I tried this and the middle was not done at all but the edges were getting way too dark so I took it out. I'm trying it again as the recipe suggests - in a sheet pan.

I used this recipe as my first attempt replacing vegetable oil with olive oil and everybody thought it was delicious. I also cut the sugar in half which was well-received by both the health-conscious and those just looking for a tasty party treat. 

When I was making the batter I thought of one review that complained about how oily it was...maybe the problem was that it calls for 2 cups of pumpkin? That was around a (15 oz)can and a half for me when measuring by volume and not weight...Next time I would adjust the recipe to fit one can of puree.

This was the best cake that I ever made. Everyone loved it. I did add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II and they worked perfectly together. I baked it in two 9" round pans to turn it into a two layer cake and I needed to bake it for 35 minutes. YUM! I will definitely make this again!!! Thank you!

This recipe was such a success!  Some of the criticisms complain about the amount of oil used, but considering there is no dairy (butter, milk, yogurt, etc.) used in the recipe it makes sense there would be some other element involved.  Which is something I love about this recipe: I can share it with our friends who are allergic to dairy!  I did add about a 1/4 cup extra flour to thicken up the batter, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinnamon.  I'm really looking forward to serving them with cream cheese frosting for our holiday party!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.
I did as others said and used 3/4 cup of Canola oil and 1/2 cup of SWEETEN applesauce. I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cup. 

Will make again, everyone at my workplace loves it.

Versatile and easy! I doctored the recipe taking a cue from other reviews, and I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of combined brown and white sugar. I also added more spices, including clove and nutmeg. Instead of regular eggs, I used a cup of "real egg" from Costco, which is mostly egg white beaters. Then, instead of the two cups of flour, I used two cups of a funnel cake mix I'm trying to get rid of. (As you can tell, not a full pantry day!) Because the mix contains some baking powder already, I only added a teaspoon and a half of baking soda and one teaspoon baking powder. Baked in a 9x13 in pan and it was done in 30 minutes. Even with all these adjustments, the cake came out nicely, light and fluffy and not too sweet!

This cake is amazing!! Moist, not too sweet and super yummy! I made mine in a bundt pan and cooked it for 45 minutes. I was going to try the cream cheese II frosting from this site on it but it is delicious without it....fresh from the oven and still warm, I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on mine! SO GOOD!!!! A million thanks Sue!!

AWFUL! After looking at the ingredients I questioned the amounts?(oil etc) The taste of the batter is horrible!  Thinking after it is cooked it will taste better?  WRONG!  It didn't cook threw.  Remained raw tasted absolutely gross. Only smelled good.

This cake was so moist and absolutely decadent! I'm in loveee! I usually am never really good at baking cakes from scratch, but this, my God, this was amazingg! I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut down on the oil. I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also generally don't like frosted cakes, so I made a sheet cake and when it cooled, I cut it into 2 thin layers and spread the suggested cream cheese frosting between the two layers, so it's now a layer cake! It's almost done and I only made it about 15 hours ago! I'm usually happy about my food when people enjoy them and not just me, so I'm super happy this time! :D

I added nutmeg as well and a bit more cinnamon. I also didn't use the vanilla essence, but rather a mixed essence that my mom has been using since I was a child. I got mine at a West Indian store in Queens, NY. I'm definitely going to be trying this again and I'll be sharing it with people; no more tough, dry cakes from me! lol :D

 MY TWEAKS
-Fresh butternut squash steamed and pureed instead of canned
-3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of 1 1/4 oil
-Mixed west Indian essence instead of vanilla essence
-1/4 tsp nutmeg added to the flour mixture
-Baked for 45 mins in metal sheet cake pan, on second rack at 350F
- No nuts
-Cream cheese frosting in center of cake instead of all over on top

I just made this, turned out perfect, though I did make some alterations. 1 1/4 cups of oil is an awful lot, so I took the advice of the other reviewers and made some substitutions. I used a half cup of oil, then instead of applesauce I used extra pumpkin to make up the last 3/4 cup. So instead of 1 1/4 cups oil, its 1/2 cup oil plus 3/4 cup pumpkin (a 29 oz can of pumpkin covers all this plus a little extra). I also added extra spices, a 1/4 teaspoon each ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves. I think it would be bland without the spice, but I like strong flavors. And with the extra pumpkin the spices don't overwhelm the pumpkin flavor. Oh, and I cooked it in a 14.5x11 pan and it was done in 25 minutes (my oven burns a little hot). Overall I plan on using this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it turned out to be absolutely delicious!! It was super moist and did not even need any icing. We ate the entire thing in a day. Will definately be making this cake again (maybe try them as cupcakes)!!

Our family and friends loved them! We had some friends over to watch a football game and we were looking for something to fix for a quick dessert to go with dinner and stumbled across this. While it wasn't quick, it sounded so yummy we decided to go for it. We admittedly tweaked it a bit. First we decided for the sake of speeding things up, to make cupcakes. Perfect use of this recipe! It's light and delicious and moist! A little messy, we make sure the kids aren't over the carpet to enjoy them but a good change we felt. We used the entire LARGE can of pumpkin. Yes that looks like a lot and is well over the two c. the recipe calls for and no it's not going to be a problem. It made the recipe very, very moist. They were great fresh out of the oven all warm and springy, but they were so much better the next morning after all that pumpkin had truly married with the other ingredients. Go with the extra. We also felt that just cinnamon was probably like a poorly spiced pumpkin pie, a bad call. So we added an 1/8th of a teaspoon of ground ginger and nutmeg to the dry mix. And because I live in the middle of a pecan grove, we used those instead of walnuts. The recipe made 30 standard cupcakes when filling the cups 2/3rds full. They rose well and were a fantastic hit with everyone. Least to say 24 hours later they are gone. And everyone is asking when we're making more!

This was excellent. I made cupcakes instead of cake. I also added some ginger and nutmeg, along with some shredded carrot and about 2 tsp of buttermilk. It is exceptionally smooth and moist and FABULOUS with peanut butter icing!

I have used this recipe for every holiday since I found it. Everyone loves it. I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned. Since my husband doesn't like cream cheese, I use a basic brown sugar glaze for the topping. I would like to thank the person that posted this recipe it has become a very popular cake in our home.

Oh my goodness! This was wonderful! I used my own home-cooked pumpkin (The pumpkin had extra cinnamon, cloves, and butter from the cooking process) but otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. The only other difference is that I reduced the bake time to 25 minutes. It was all that it claims to be - moist and delicious...and GONE. A keeper, for sure. 

Thanks Sue!

Using the recommendations from other reviews, I thought this recipe was delicious and perfectly moist!  Adjustments I made:  1 cup sugar + 1 cup Splenda, 3/4 c oil + 1/2 c applesauce, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves.   I didn't mind the Splenda replacement for calorie reduction, definitely still tasted fine, but some may notice the difference in taste/sweetness.  I made cupcakes (baked at 325 degrees for about 20 min) and didn't think it needed frosting.

This cake is fantastic! I made the bundt version and did have to cook it quite a bit longer - maybe 50 minutes - but it was so incredibly moist and not at all greasy and oily as some other reviews said. I think perhaps they just didn't cook it nearly long enough. I used the Cream Cheese frosting II recipe and orange sparkles and everyone was raving about it. It will be my new go to for Thanksgiving!

good simple and made a lg amount in a sheet pan for Thanksgiving.  I made it the night before and covered it with a cream cheese frosting.  Delicious.  Also, as long as you don't make the frosting too sweet, I found that it was the perfect "not-to Sweet" cake for the males in our family who do not enjoy dessert so much.  They liked it!

I made cupcakes for a bake sale featuring this recipe with a few changes. Everyone talked about how delicious they were! Instead of white sugar, I used half brown half white. I followed the advice of several reviewers and used 3/4c oil and 1/4c applesauce. With the addition of allspice and nutmeg, the cake was perfectly spiced. I topped with Maple Cream Cheese Frosting on this site and it was fantastic! I would give 5 stars, but it took a lot of tweaking to get what I wanted.

This recipe was so tasty and super easy to make. Instead of cake, I turned mine into cupcakes. I popped them in the oven for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Like other reviewers I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe by Janni, which can be found on allrecipes. I will definitely be making this again, everyone enjoyed!

This recipe is excellent just the way it is. I made it in a bundt pan, frosted with cream cheese icing and drizzled it with chocolate gananche. People had a hard time believing it was pumpkin. Way to go!

I also baked this in a bundt pan and it was wonderful! I did not change the recipe at all. I prefer cakes without frosting or icing and the flavor in this cake was so good none was needed. Based on recommendations I may try the applesauce and additional spices the next time I bake this, which will be soon!

My cake turned out great! I took the advice given by other people to sub.1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil. I also used fresh pumpkin; cut in 1/2 lengthwise and cook at 350 for about 40 min (like a squash). If you like a true pumpkin flavor this is great to do!! Good base recipe for adding your own twist!

This recipe is fantastic, I made it for a family get together where 3 of us (including myself) are lactose intolerant. It had great reviews. I did tweek the recipe a little bit.

I added 2 tsp ground cloves, 2 tsp pumpkin spice and 2 tsp nutmeg. I made it as a bundt cake, greasing and flouring the pan and upping the cooking time to 45 mins. Once its cooked let it set 10 mins before flipping it onto a plate then let cool completely and covered with whipped cream, it was very yummy!! Will be making this one again!!

I did some modifications: I used 200 grams of margarine instead of the oil, and used only 200 g of sugar. I added 1 tsp of ground cloves aswell. This cake is always a huge hit!

I found that this made great cake batter that tasted really good after I added a lot more spices and sugar. I recommend you add spices and sugar to taste so the cake tastes better. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved making this cake for the holidays. I take the suggestions of adding more spice and part applesauce. And I use the cream cheese icing recommended. My sister-in-law asks for it every holiday now!

This is more of a pumpkin bread for breakfast.  It was great though.  Everyone took a slice home for breakfast the next morning; I was too slow and I didn't even get a slice for myself.

This is a delicious, moist cake!  I should have read the other reviews first, though, because if you like a spicy kick in your pumpkin cake, you really need to add a bit more cinnamon, and maybe some nutmeg and allspice, too.  Raisins might be good, too.  Still, this, with cream cheese frosting on top, was a big hit in my daughters Kindergarten class.

This is the BEST!  I love this cake!  I made it exactly as written and put the cream cheese frosting by JJ from this website and it is to die for.  The cake is moist and has a great flavor.  I did not put the nuts in because I made it for several people that I work with and some do not like nuts.  I'm sure it would be great with pecans.  This is a keeper and I will definitely make this again.

This cake was wonderful!  I added extra cinnamon and also some ground cloves.  When the cake was just cool enough to frost (but still warm on the inside) I served it to my guests. They told me they talked about how good the cake was all the way home :)

This cake was awesome.  I halved the recipe (we have a small family), used half applesauce/half vegetable oil, and baked in a bundt pan for 25 min.  I iced it with the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this website.  I will be making this for Thanksgiving!

I was nervous about the amount of baking powder/soda, but I followed to a tee and I'm glad I did. So moist and very tasty. Does not need frosting. This is my new favorite recipe.

This is excellent. I made the recipe using 2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and omitting the nuts. Also, you can dump the eggs, oil, sugar, pumpkin, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and combine right from the start. I got 34 cupcakes from this recipe using a muffin scoop (3 T) for perfect, uniform results. Dark muffin pans, 325F, 18-19 minutes, cool in pan for 5 minutes. Frost with homemade cream cheese frosting. I dare you to eat just one!

I was surprised at how great this turned out. It cooked perfectly--very moist, but not raw/mushy. I used only 1 1/2 c. plus 2 T. sugar. It worked out fine, but I wouldn't cut back more on the sugar. I baked it in a 9-by-13-in. pan--I think I kept it in for about 40 minutes or so. I also added a cup of chocolate chips instead of the walnuts, which worked out well. Finally, I looked up a similar recipe on the Cook's Country web site, and based on that decided to add a 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. allspice. Cream cheese icing recipes are basically very similar, but I found one that is easy to remember--1 8 oz. package cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Enough to frost the top and sides of a 9-by-13 cake, but I just used half the amount and put a thin layer of frosting on the top. The cake is good by itself, so it doesn't need a lot of frosting.

I just made this for a Halloween party and topped it with Maple Cream Cheese glaze.  People LOVED it - a total winner and so easy!
