WONDERFUL! This recipe is fantastic. We made it in the crockpot (low temp for 10-12 hours) and the beef was so tender. We've made it several times now, and this last time found me without Lipton Onion Soup Mix in the house; I ended up adding extra minced onion, some onion salt, pepper and a bit of garlic seasoning. It still turned out great, with almost the same flavor as usual. We serve it on tortillas, typically, but have also used it on sliced french bread or a sandwich bun. Great for freezing, as it makes a lot. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my go to recipe when we can not decide what to have. Very rich and flavorful. I have made it in the oven and stovetop, the stovetop version comes out better for some reason.

This is very good. I tweaked the recipe a bit after reading some reviews. I carmelized a yellow onion with three cloves of garlic. Then I seared the chuck roast (i used 2lbs). I added 1/4 red wine and 1/4 cup of water and a 1/2 TSP of beef bouillion. Then I chopped up a green pepper and cooked it all together on high for a couple hours.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I added a 1/3 of red wine because it needed more liquid and a by dinner time it was tender and delish!  It was tender after 3 hours of cooking on high on the stove.

This is a nice change from your average pot roast recipe.  At first I wasn't too sure about using wine with salsa, but our family ended up loving it.  I've  made some changes too, subbed 1 can rotel for the salsa, added 1 can of diced green chilies, used 1/2 can beef broth for the water, reduced red wine to 1/2 cup, added 1 can black beans, 1/2 a diced onion and some minced garlic and simmered in my slow cooker.  Omitted dry onion soup, because I didn't have any, but it didn't seem to need it.  Very good, and very tender.  Shredded beef, added some white rice and wrapped in flour tortillas with some shredded cheese.  Yum...

Needs more spice! I've been on the lookout for a good shredded beef (for tacos) recipe for a LONG time. I've tried them all - Mijo's slow cooker shredded beef, Charley's slow cooker Mexican style meat & shredded beef for tacos. None, including this one, meet my expectations. Having said this, I do think this recipe is the best of them all, but will require some mods if I ever make it again. Christy's recipe is a bit too savory, IMHO. Even with hot salsa, it tasted too much like pot roast. I'd definitely up the amount of salsa next time (maybe in lieu of the H2O called for???). My only changes were slow cooking my roast (I like to find ways to use my sc whenever possible) & adding a t of minced garlic. I seared my roast / sauteed my onion as directed, dumped everything in the sc, cooked on HIGH for 2 hrs. & then on LOW for another 4. NOTE: Every hr. on high ='s 2-2 1/2 on low. I didn't get around to prepping dinner until Noon. Since I wanted to eat at a decent hr., I started everythig on high, but I don't recommend this. Beef cuts are better suited on low. NOTE #2: The low setting is around 200 degrees F & the high setting around 300. One last note.... 4-5 hr. on HIGH / 8-10 on LOW are suitable timeframes for oven cooking times ranging from 1-3 hr. I hope this helps those of you wanting to use your sc! Served on fried corn tortillas w/ salsa, red cabbage, cilantro, queso fresco & a side of Mexican rice. Bacardi mojitos completed our meal. Thanks CHRISTYJ! :-)

My mother has made a version of ropa vieja for years.  I decided to give this recipe a try.  Like some other reviewers, I used a crockpot also.  I cut down a bit on the salsa.  The flavor was wonderful, but it came out a bit 'soupier' than I would have liked. In the future I will reduce the water so it is a bit drier in the end.  Otherwise, no complaints!!

The recipe was very easy to put together.  I used a mixture of beef and pork and served it with rice and a spicy southwestern slaw.  A spicy lime mayonnaise on the top with diced tomato and avocado finished it off wonderfully.  Serve with fried flour and corn tortillas.

Hubby came home with some thick slabs of skirt steak and I needed a long slow recipe for them. This was the ticket! I had homemade salsa so I used that with 2 pkts of soup mix. I did not use the wine and I forgot to add the onion. 3 slabs of beef in the huge cast iron skillet and in the oven it went, 3 hrs later, the house had the Most wonderful scent:) MMMMM I whipped up a batch of spanish rice and toasted the flour tortillas. Deliscioso!!  Thank you ChrsityJ

Good recipe. I subbed cranberry juice for the wine and doubled the salsa. I also made mine in a crockpot 8 hrs. on high, without browning on the stove first. I enjoyed it today and I'm really looking forward to seeing what I will do with this tender tasty beef tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe.

So good! I used a 3 lb. bottom round roast and subbed a 10 oz can of RoTel for the salsa. Cooked in Crock Pot for 8 hours on high, shredded beef and left in juices for another hour. We had it on corn tortillas with cheese and sour cream. Yum!

This has been our family's favorite pot roast for years!  I have tried it in the crock pot or in a dutch oven and I prefer the oven.  I felt like it lost a lot of flavor in the crock pot.  I also use Rotel sometimes with the picante or in place of.  I substitute beef boullion/minced onion homemade mix for the lipton onion soup to avoid the MSG.  I use light olive oil for the vegetable oil for healthier fats.  During the winter this is a weekly item and makes great roast beef sandwiches the next day.

Really easy and delicious.  I made this in the slow cooker and it turned out great.  I shredded the beef and put them in fried corn tortillas with cabbage, salsa, cotija cheese, avocado and hot sauce. Great!

Quite good.  Very different from another ropa vieja recipe I have used that was a bit more tomato-based, but still a very nice taste.  Wouldn't change anything.

Very good.  Smells delicious while cooking.  I too subbed Rotel tomatoes.  Jalapenos are included in the can.  Very flavorful.  Make it like a burrito with black beans and cheese.   Only gave it 4 stars becaue my boys are not fans of tomatoes but till liked it.

I'm giving this 4 on flavor and an extra 1 for ease and simplicity!  The flavors are wonderful!  Unfortunately I didn't have the dry onion soup mix, just a pkg. of garlic & mushroom, so used that.  It was great.  Next time I'll make sure I have the onion on hand, just to see if there is a big difference in flavor.  I didn't shred mine, just sliced and served with the sauce, along with some bollios to mop up the extra sauce! FANTASTIC!

I tried this recipe as it was the only one for ropa vieja listed. My husband remembers this dish from growing up in Miami. Although I'm not sure how close it was to what he remembered, he enjoyed it! It was certainly easy to make, the meat was tender, and I served it with the cooking juices over white rice. I'll make it again.

Not a true Ropa Vieja recipe, no vino seco, no cumin, no tomato, no pepper, no onion - my boyfriend wanted to surprise me with something from my culture and I felt bad that I had to cover it in onion and peppers later. You don't use store bought salsa - this could be considered "bootleg" ropa vieja. Get yourself a nice flank, maybe skirt, chuck as a last resort, 8 hours slow cook in tomatoes, tomato sauce/paste, garlic, onion, peppers, bay leaf, thyme, seasoned with salt, marinated in a little cooking wine - shred put it back in on warm and serve over moros y cristianos con maduros or tostones. Perfect meal.

Family liked this dish.  I decreased wine and onion soup mix by 1/2.  Added 2 jalapeños and one cup of fresh tomatoes along with the salsa.  Baked a 2 lb. roast for 3.5 hours.  The vegetables became carmelized and meat was tender and easy to shred.  Served it over brown rice with mexican coleslaw on the side.  Requested to have this dish again.

Yummy roast! I wasn't too excited about this recipe at first because it had a weird smell but it turned out very tasty. After reading reviews, I made these adjustments as well: 1/2 cup madria sangria (I didn't want to open up my red wine), 1/2 cup beef broth, can of rotel w/ chiles, small can green chile, red pearl onions, and kosher salt to taste.

LOVE this.  Made it in the crockpot with slight variations:  omitted Lipton soup mix and instead made a rub of garlic salt, onion salt, cayenne, salt and pepper - rub evenly over roast and sear on all sides.  Cover with carmelized onion and garlic and topped with pico de gallo (tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapeno mix) - Added black beans and a few coarsely chopped red peppers and added liquid as suggested.  High - 8 hours, shred with 2 forks and crack lid for last hour to help thicken.  Serve over rice, top with avocado and mexican creme (sour cream would be fine) and pass tortillas.  Instantly became a family favorite - Mucho delicioso!!! :)

First time making this! I had meat that I had to use and popped this into a pot on the stovetop and it came out awesome! It was very juicy and tasty...needed absolutely no salt or sour cream or lime (like I like to add to my tacos). Thank you so much. My husbands family was impressed!

This turned out great!  My husband LOVED this dish.  I pretty much followed the recipe but made a few changes based on some of the reviews and my own personal taste.  I slightly seasoned the roast with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Then I browned it in the skillet and followed the instructions from there.  I added a little cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the wine mixture (I used salsa and rotel).  I transferred everything to the crockpot and cooked it on high for 4-5 hours.  This meat was full of flavor and extremely tender.  I served it ith a homeade cilantro lime rice on the side and garlic toast.

Excellent flavor.  I love the way the wine mellows to create a rich warm flavor for this meat.  We ate it over brown rice, but it would be really wonderful as a filling.  So nice to have another way to fix chuck roast that has new flavors.

Average at best. I made this in the Slow Cooker so eliminated the water. It really wasn't special at all. I was expecting so much more from the positive reviews but it was just so bland and boring.

Awesome Roast! I added a can of beef broth to cover the meat in the slow cooker. I accidently opened a bottle of white wine and used it instead of red. oops! I'm waiting for my Mexican Rice III on this site to be done so we can chow down. The meat was well done after being browned and then in the slow cooker on low for 5 hours.

This was delicious!  Even my pickiest eater enjoyed it. It would be very easy to boost the Spanish flavor with some additional seasonings--cumin or chiles for those who like it spicier.

For as much work that went into this I'm surprised I found it so bland.  There are so many flavors in it, but it seems to come out boring.  I served this @ a dinner party and my girlfriend and coworkers liked it but I think they were just being nice.

Very good.  Close to what I've had in Cuban rests.  I would suggest to add some peas or maybe some pepper sliced.  What I also did was after shredding up meat, put it back into the sauce and let it absorb more flavor.

I made this exactly as directed, except I used medium, homemade salsa instead of prepared salsa.  I also made it in the crock pot instead of the oven and served it over packaged yellow rice and served black beans on the side.  No leftovers in our house!  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent overall, without much prep time and easy directions.  Next time, I personally would use a "mellow/light-tasting" red wine to prevent any chance of the wine overpowering everything else (came close).  Additionally I used a chunky, homemade salsa instead of a store bought salsa.  My family loved it, and the leftovers are...history.

Essentially this was a "pot roast" burrito (we used flour tortillas) BUT we loved it!  We squeezed limes and had slices of avacados with a dallop of sour cream on top and rolled them up in warm tortillas.  Next time I might add some fresh cilantro or take the salsa up a notch for a little more kick.  I will make this again.  My boys loved it!

Oh my gosh! I just tried this recipe today for the first time and it came out SO GOOD! I browned the meat and onions in a skillet before putting them in the crockpot, and I left out the 1/2 cup water because you don’t need as much liquid in the crockpot (recipe is for a using a Dutch oven). I also added a little squirt of tomato paste and a spoonful of beef base, as well as the dry onion soup, red wine, and the salsa. I used Pace salsa, because I like the way it tastes with beef. I’ll be making this recipe again for sure. I let it go all day in the crockpot on low (6-8 hours?) and it was fall-apart tender when I got home.

Excellent!  I have made this many times, and use the recipe as is.  I have used the crock pot method also, and it worked very well also.  First time I made it was for a school lunch project in my daughter's Spanish class.  Was voted best dish!  Served with black beans and yellow rice.

Wonderful, we used a sirloin roast, and think it would have been better as chuck just as it would have shredded easier.  However, the flavor was amazing, and so easy to make.

Excellent.  I made a few slight changes... substituted beef broth for most of the wine and used Rotel instead of salsa.  Great flavor.  I'm sure it's delicious however you tweak it to your liking!

Unfortunately it tasted more like a good pot roast than true ropa vieja.

I tried this recipe and it was pretty good.  Not quite like I was expecting, but we made some good dishes with it.  Guess I'm not really used to using Chuck Roast.

I absolutely love this recipe as does my whole family.  I've never had a roast come out so tender.  And the whole house smells wonderful.  I use a slow cooker and we usually eat this with tortillas and refried beans.

This was Great!  I pan seared roast in spicy brand olive oil.  Wonderful flavor.  I used both beef and pork roast and they turned out perfectly.  Will make again.

I have made this Recipe several times. I can't believe I never Rated it. This dish is Excellent. Even for Leftovers. I like to serve mine with White Rice. My Husband is a very Picky eater and Loved this.

This was very good.  I used London Broil and it worked perfectly.  I used a Knorr beef bullion cube instead of the broth and I added a can of whole tomatoes and chopped them up.  WIll make this again.

This recipe was good, but I was expecting more of a spicy flavor from the salsa.  It sort of tasted like regular pot roast, but I liked it better when I added more salsa after the fact.  I will definitely make it again, but will try to spice it up a little more.

This was as delicious as it was easy to prepare!  I used 1 cup of fresh salsa and added crushed fresh garlic at the very end of the cooking time.  I also added more than one cup of wine (more like 1.5) and seasoned with freshly ground black pepper before serving.  We served it over white rice, and my husband had 3 bowls the first night, and ate ALL the leftovers.  This makes quite a bit, so it would be great for company.
