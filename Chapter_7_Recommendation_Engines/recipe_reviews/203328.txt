Light and refreshing. I like a little texture to my tapioca drinks so I crushed the ice first then pulsed the mangoes a few times. I love mangoes but maybe will try with a sweeter ripe mangoes like a champagne mango ones (yellow skins). Update: just made another one with honeydew and my daughter liked it better. I had to add a  little bit of sugar since the melon wasn't quite ripe.

Soothing and refreshing!  I used the coconut from making the coconut milk in this.  I will try making this with other fruit such as melons or peaches!  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this drink to be really refreshing and great for summertime. It only yields two small glasses or one tall glass so increase the recipe as necessary if you're making for a crowd. I blended the ice and mango until smooth then added almond milk (I thought I had coconut, but didn't- oh well!) and poured into two glasses. I spooned half of the tapioca into each glass and stirred. If unique texture isn't your thing, try putting the mixture in the refrigerator for 10 mins. The tapioca pearls froze which I actually preferred. I found one small glass to be plenty for this type of drink. Enjoy!

It is a good recipe. But the plain tapioca didn't do too well with my stomach. It seemed to turn out better if I mixed the mango and tapioca together instead of layering it.

You definitely need to add some sugar. Also for some reason, when I boiled the tapioca bubbles your way, they just became this congealed mass that looked and felt like fish eggs.
