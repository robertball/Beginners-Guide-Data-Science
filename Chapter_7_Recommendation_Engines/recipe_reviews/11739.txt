This is a basic macaroni and ground beef dish. I made some changes to the recipe. I seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. I sauteed the onions and green pepper together. I only had 3-8oz cans of tomato sauce so I placed approximately one half can of diced tomatoes with green chilies in with the tomato sauce. I simmered this for a few minutes and then added the cooked macaroni. I didn't use the entire box of macaroni because I thought it would be too dry with the amount of sauce that I had. The addition of the canned tomatoes with green chilies gave it a fresher taste and added a little bite to it.A sprinkling of parmesean cheese on top and it is good to go. I served it with a Caesar salad and garlic bread. This made a very nice weekday dinner.I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you!

This is a very quick and delicious recipe to throw together when time is tight. I did saute 3 large garlic cloves along with the onion. I also added fresh ground pepper to the recipe. Since I was out of green pepper, I used red pepper and celery in its place. It turned out great. I also used less tomato sauce. Some family members sprinkled it with parmesan or cheddar cheese. This recipe was a hit with my family. It is not gourmet, but a nice basic dish.

Good.  Our family all agreed that we like this dish much better when a jar spagetti sauce is added instead of the tomato sauce.  It just seems to add a little more punch to it.

I browned my meat with the an onion,  a green pepper, minced garlic, salt & pepper then after draining I added two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce one can stewed tomatoes and a jar of my grandma's stewed tomatoes (because that all I had on hand) I then added a 16 oz box of rotini and brought it all to a boil, then simmered it until the pasta was tender. I added colby jack on top to melt and my family liked it alot. Next time I will use the 2 cans tomato sauce and 3 cans of stewed tomatoes. Hope this helps. Thanks for the recipe.

Read thru 43 reviews before making this dish. So many wonderful ideas. Used what I had on hand - 3 cloves garlic (minced),  7 oz tomato sauce, 2 carrots (diced), 1/2 cup macaroni, 1 small potato (diced), 1/2 cup chicken broth to 1/2 lb ground beef. Salt, pepper to taste. Served over steamed wihite rice. Fantastic comfort food.

Quick, easy.  The whole family loved it.  My initial thought was that there would be way too much tomato sauce but I was wrong.  Perfect.

This is easy and good.  I've made it exactly as the recipe calls and I've also modified the recipe and added some garlic to the sauce..then mixed the sauce and noodles with shredded parmesan and mozarella in a baking dish and baked the whole thing.  This was far better...probably less healthy with all the cheese (LOL) but yummy!

I liked this quite well, it was also good reheated.  When I reheated it I added shredded cheese and it was better that way.

I agree with other posters that this is not the best meal I have ever had, but it is a great pull-together-from-what-you-usually-have-on-hand dinner.  It reminded me of Hamburger Helper, but much better tasting without all the preservatives and junk.  It actually was better than I expected and my husband gobbled it down.  Some modifications that I made: #1 Only used 1 lb of ground turkey, #2 Used two cans of 8 oz tomato sauce (correction from two 14.5 oz) and one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes.  #3 Did as other suggested and sauteed bell peppers, onion, and later garlic in a little bit of olive oil before adding the meat.  #4  16 oz box of noodles is a bit much.  I used probably about 2/3-3/4 of what I cooked and will do a mini mac and cheese with the rest.  #5 Did this as a bake.  Put everything in a 9x13 pan and baked until heated through and sauce was bubbling.  Added a layer of cheese on top and put back in the oven for about 5 minutes until melted.  Yummy!

This recipe was quick and easy to make. I was surprised I didn't need to add more seasoning other than what I normally use to season my ground beef. This is a great family recipe! The only thing I did differently was using only one can of tomato sauce instead of two.

This was really good, but I only gave it 4 stars here, because I changed it up a bit...Insteady of tomato sauce, I used a jar of salsa.  Also, cut down on the onion and used red peper instead of green pepper.  And, threw some cheddar cheese on top right before serving.  It was YUMMY!!!

Fast and easy.  Not gourmet, but with a name like Elbows and Ground Beef hopefully you aren't expecting gourmet.  Do NOT use spaghetti sauce.  The tomatoes and peppers create a completely different taste.  In addition to the listed ingredients, I sauteed the onions, peppers and when almost done, a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic.  I also stirred in a can of petite diced tomatoes with the sauce.  Yum!

I give this 5 stars because it reminds me of my childhood, it's still pretty tasty, and it's sooo easy to make. I don't care for tomatoe sauce in this, instead I use either 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes, or one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. Sometimes I leave the green pepper out, sometimes I add it in.

I grew up thinking this was Goulash!! Except we didn't have the green pepper, which is an excellent addition!! I forgot all about this untill I saw this recipe. Thanks for the reminder, and the green pepper idea. I will make it like this from now on.

Very good...memories from childhood...my Grammie called it Wash Day supper because it is easy and all in one pot. DO NOT USE SPAGHETTI SAUCE!  Do not pre-cook the macaroni....just put it in the pot dry to soak up and cook in the tomato, pepper and beef juices.  I used 1 can beef broth, 1 can tomato sauce and a can of condensed tomato soup, can of Rotel, jar of canned garden tomatoes from last year, garlic and a little Italian seasoning (1 tsp). Delicious and cheap meal. Used a potato masher to break up the ground beef.

As other reviewers suggested, we used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce for more flavor (and I agree, the tomato sauce alone would would have been rather bland).  Delicious, wonderful comfort food.  Will definitely make again.  Editing to add:  The leftovers are even better.  :)

Nice basic pasta recipe.  We added garlic powder to this too.  When you don't want anything too fancy and a fast meal this is good.

I used ground venison and gluten-free pasta...otherwise the same as the original recipe.  The meal is delicious, simple, easy-to-make, comfort food.

This recipe wasn't so hot....very bland, and I added garlic and worcestershire sauce...too much sauce for the amount of beef and pasta and that was only using one can of tomato sauce.  Kids liked it though.

I've been making this for years and years except I add either some fresh minced garlic or powdered garlic (whichever I have on hand)to my ground beef, bell peppers and onions while browning.  I also add one to two cans of diced tomatoes including the juice instead of using tomato sauce after draining my ground beef then salt and pepper to taste. Add your noodles or macaroni last, stir and simmer until pasta is done. It's also good with a can of whole kernel corn added to it. This dish is good but we like my version a bit better.

My mom has been making this for as long as I can remember. In our house it's called, "beef adobo." It has no relation to chicken adobo in taste; we're part filipino, so the name works. Anyway, mom uses everything listed above with exception to the tomato paste/sauce (uses water instead) and green pepper. But then she also adds one egg towards the end of the cooking process (stirring into hot pot) and diced tomatoes. Salt & pepper to taste and voila, "beef adobo!" I've added a pic for your viewing pleasure.

I made this for dinner tonight, my husband loves it I add a little something to it though I add a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic and I season my ground beef with a little bit of garlic powder , salt and pepper. I thought it will give it a little more taste. I am sure this will be a simple dish I will make often for us both. thanks for the recipe.

It made way more than 4 servings. 2 of us ate 2 large helpings with a lot of sauce each and we still had 9 cups of leftover sauce and 7 Cups of leftover elbow macaroni.. was DELICIOUS and I will definately fix it again just making sure I use less elbows and have enough freezer space for the sauce, which would make a good base sauce for other dishes that take spaghetti sauce.

This is easy, fast, and not too bad.  But I was a little disappointed that the sauce wasn't as tasty.  I would like a mac 'n beef recipe that also has a lot more sauce.  I put in additional tomato sauce, but it still wasn't enough.  This recipe also seems to serve more than 4.  We had a lot left over.

I was a little short on tomato sauce, so I used a little picante sauce.  The flavor was quite tasty.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I loved this recipe. For those who prefer less sauce (like myself), only add one can of tomato sauce. Overall, though, beautiful.

Quick and easy. My husband likes anything with hamburger. I didn’t have the right amount of tomato sauce so added a jar of home canned tomatoes. Also added some home grown chopped jalapeños from my freezer, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a can of mixed vegetables that I bought accidentally a while back.

I gave the recipe 5 stars as it reminded me of something my Mother would make when I was growing up.
DH gave it 4 stars because he would prefer a thicker sauce. He wants thicken it w/tomato paste. Maybe I'll try that to keep him happy but it really doesn't need it.

I made this today and just redid some of the ingredients. I added sofrito (Latin seasonings) and mushrooms, crushed tomatoes with garlic and oregano, also a 1/2 tbs of minced garlic. Really a good recipe to do on last minute and really you can also freeze the meat sauce which I did, for later on.

Great basic recipe. After reading all the reviews I used this recipe as a guideline.  I added chopped celery and carrots. I used a red bell pepper.  I used 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and added water as needed to cook the noodles in the same pot (about 3/4 can). I also added chicken base.  I seasoned everything as I added to the pot. I used salt, pepper, Italian herb mix, minced garlic and garlic powder, red pepper flakes. I only used 1lb ground beef and 8 oz pasta.  I sautéed all the vegetables together then added the beef. Drained it all. Added the crushed tomatoes and pasta. Simmered until the pasta was cooked. Me and the hubby enjoyed it.  Definitely easy and worth making again.

I thought this was terrific!  The sauce made sooo much though... I split the sauce in half and froze it.  When I was ready to serve it up I heated it up on the stove and poured over 16 ounces of large macaroni.  My family really liked it.  Will definitely make again.

I was looking for something that would use up the 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef I had left from another recipe I had just made. This looked simple enough and seemed to have good ratings, so I made it for supper. I just had two full bowls of it!
I did add salt, pepper and garlic to the browning meat and I used a yellow pepper I had on hand.  
Instead of regular tomato sauce, I used 2 bottles Classic Roasted Tomato and Garlic sauce. (It really didn't need two full bottles but I didn't want to waste any!) This recipe yields way more than just 4 servings, I would say.  I had those two soup-bowlsful and there seems to still be enough in the pan to fill several more bowls!  This is a keeper for a fast easy comfort-food dish.

My mom has made this dish since I was a little girl.  Like her, I add 1 1/2-2 cups of water and some garlic to the sauce and actually cook the pasta (1/2 of what the original recipe calls for in the sauce once it comes to a boil.  I sometimes add a tsp of chile powder for a slight kick.

This receipe was a great foundation or should I say a road map to bring meal together.  I found the original recipe very Bland. so I added fresh garlic,  oregano,  Italian spice,  and some garlic salt.  I also added a pound of hot sausage.  What I ended up with was simply a marvelous meal. I give it five stars not because of the original recipe,  but more so because using the basics of the original recipe.  GREGORY ANYTHING BUT BLAND.  Yes my last name is BLAND so i for sure don't want to eat like it.

Yes my Mom made this just as the recipe is written with one exception she put crushed up Ritz crackers on top of it. It was oh so good . I took the advice and did add a small amount of salsa & pasta sauce as I didn’t have any tomato sauce. A hit with the family , will make again as I have been , just kinda forgot about it

We made this tonight but I did make some small changes. My green peppers had went bad so I didn't use them at all. I browned the beef with sea salt, peppercorn and minced garlic. I added canned petite diced tomatoes, an onion and some more garlic. It still didn't seem to be enough so I like others added freshly shaved parmesan cheese and then it was great! I wish I had done some cheesy garlic bread but we were too hungry!! Thanks for the recipe!

I added garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, beef bouillon cubes and Worcestershire sauce. I also used tomatoes paste instead of tomatoe sauce. It was delicious! I will be putting this recipe in the monthly rotation.

It was a good start but I did add so much more to make it more flavorful: celery, carrots, and more vegetables, plus a lot of seasoning like chili powder.

Easy. It would be good to add salt and pepper a little bit or another more flavoured tomato sauce instead of the canned tomato sauce.

This was surprisingly good considering the little bit of effort and time involved.  I was looking to use up some ground beef that needed to be used and I had all the ingredients in the pantry.  I used one can of sauce and a can of diced tomatoes along with onion, bell pepper, and garlic.  Very tasty and easy.

Made this pretty close to recipe, added fresh garlic to the green pepper and onion mix and cooked that together with the beef. Three in a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, brought to a boil, then turned down to low. Added the macaroni and loaded shredded cheese on top---my picky eater went back for seconds and then thirds! A winner in my book for an easy mid-week meal.

I needed something quick so I tried it.  I made the following changes based on what I had available:
I used a red pepper instead of a green one.  
I used tomato paste with three cans of waters and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes with onions instead of tomato sauce.
I used small shells instead of macaroni.
I also added 1-2 tbl Worcestershire sauce.
p.s.  My family loved it.

Goulash (Ghoulash)is what we called this recipe. But I used only 1 (15 oz) can of stewed tomatoes, garlic powder and threw a tablespoon of cornstarch to give it a bit of thickening. Delish!

This was a great idea!  I changed it up a bit though!  Instead of two cans of tomato sauce. I used one can of Rotel and a small can of tomato sauce.  I seasoned my meat with seasoned salt. We also used whole wheat elbows! I topped mine with 4 cheese Mexican blend.  It was so great!

It was kinda bland, even with me adding some extra ingredients. My family thought it was just like spaghetti and meat sauce...not thrilled with it.

I added a ton of seasonings as this was a bit bland for my tastes. I also added in some shredded carrots to add a few veggies to the mix.

The boys liked this meal.  The girls, not so much.  We did add fresh garlic.  Next time, I would add less tomato sauce.
