I can't rate this EXACT recipe, because I did modify it a bit. I pureed about 2 cups of mixed berries (strawberry, blueberry, blackberry and raspberry) and added to the champagne mixture as well as 1/4cup more sugar. It turned out great!!! The champagne keeps the sorbet at the perfect consistency, and the berries kept the sorbet from tasting overwhelmingly like champagne. We served this in martini glass with a sprig of mint and lemon zest. Very pretty presentation, refreshing and delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Thank you for a unique recipe. I made this as the recipe states, and I also made a batch where I pureed the strawberries and added them to the champagne and sugar. I also added a pinch of salt and a little more sugar to my liking. We preferred the later, but this does make a great addition to a celebration!

What a great idea! Super easy to make with an ice cream maker. Mixed the champagne and sugar in the ice cream maker for 30 min, then froze it for a bit in the freezer before scooping. We didn't have strawberries; just chopped some mint and mixed it in with halved/chopped fresh blueberries. As my husband said, this will give you "a head rush and a brain freeze at the same time!"
