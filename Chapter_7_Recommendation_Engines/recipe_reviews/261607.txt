I followed the method exactly as written (even at 7,000ft) and loved the outcome. The veggies are just bursting with flavor and the texture is perfect. Had to adjust two ingredients, though. I used red onion and cherry tomatoes. Thank you for the recipe.

It is easy, tasty and summery, we both loved it.  
To make it quicker, instead of using the oven, I sauted each of the cut-up vegetables on stove-top first,  in a pan. 
Then cooked all of them together  with the tomatoes and seasonings, under a lid, for a few minutes.

We liked this a lot.  Didn't have eggplant, but used most everything else and followed the instructions as written.  Added sliced mushrooms and green onions.  Seasoned with Trader Joe's Everything but the Bagel. Good!

Excellent. I added pre-cooked Italian sausages, two red apples, and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. Easy and full of flavor!

My husband's comment: I didn't think I'd like zucchini this much. We did leave out the eggplant and onion, because we didn't have any, which made all the veggies fit on one pan. I wish I had used a silicone baking sheet because the wax paper ripped while I was mixing it in the middle of baking. It was a delicious meal. We'll definitely make it again.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Used canned tomatoes as thatâ€™s what I had. Used it over cheese tortellini topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Delish!
