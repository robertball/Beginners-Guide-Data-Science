This was the easiest and quickest soup I have ever made! I used 2 cans of cubed cooked chicken and sprinkled crushed tortilla chips, cheese and a dollop of sour cream over each bowl.  Delicious!! I couldn't believe that so few ingrediants would turn out so well.  Although I normally like my soups "thicker," next time I'dd add more chicken, corn and salsa.  Also, double the recipe if your going to feed a family, this doesn't make alot!! And the heat can be adjusted based on the salsa you use!! Thanks Ortega!!

This is a tasty, easy to make soup. It's hearty and filling and I just add a tossed salad and some cornbread and we have a meal!

THIS SOUP WAS OKAY BUT NOT GREAT...I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BLAND..I USED CHICKEN ON THE BONE THINKING IT WOULD GIVE IT MORE FLAVOR BUT IT DIDNT. MAYBE WITH A FEW MORE SPICES IT WOULD BE BETTER.

I put all the ingredients into a crockpot and let it simmer all day, thus enhancing the zesty flavors.  I've made a 6 Qt batch and there was barely any left over!

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make using ingredient we usually always have on hand. I used chicken that had the bones in it and just boiled them until it fell of the bone and used the broth instead of buying it. We love it!!

This is an excellent soup recipe; it is healthy, quick, easy and delicious!  I generally like less liquid in my soups, so I will probably make it with less water next time.

This was a very tasty dinner.  We ate it with corn chips and extra cheese.  Very simple to make.
