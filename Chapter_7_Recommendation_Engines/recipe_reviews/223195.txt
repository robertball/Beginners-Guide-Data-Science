I made a double batch of this yummiest today. So good and so different. I was really excited to try this and was very happy with the results. I must say I did make 1 change because, unlike Chef John, I am a crazy person. Watch the video if you don't know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I used organic brown rice syrup instead of the corn syrup. It worked beautifully. I did also leave it in the oven for 1 hour also. I felt that it wasn't crusty enough after 40 min. It turned out better then I thought. I have made a number of Chef John's recipes and I have yet to be disappointed, in fact I think I am starting to have a crush on him. He knows good food! Oh I should add that if you keep your unpopped  corn in the freezer you will get almost no unpopped kernels while cooking your corn. You can get bulk organic popcorn at any whole foods or health food store for about $ 1.00 a lb. Make this recipe you won't be disappointed.

I saw this recipe on the Allrecipes channel on Roku and knew I had to try it.  WOW!!  It's wonderful!  The previous reviewer mentioned that it was too spicy, but I think the heat level is really just a matter of preference as I found it to be perfect.  I didn't top with cilantro because I wasn't sure how well the fresh cilantro would store on the popcorn, but it was still just absolutely fantastic.  My 6 year-old did complain that it made the house smell like wet dog while it was cooking, and she has a point, but I promise- it's well worth the fish sauce-y smell while it's in the oven!

I made this for a potluck, and most people liked it but I put a bit too much "heat" in it for some.  This was fun to make and fairly simple. Plus, it definitely tastes like Pad Thai.  I had always wanted to make a type of caramel corn, so this recipe was easy-to-follow and basically no fail.  All said, I will probably make it again some time in the future.

This snack is unlike anything I've ever tasted. Everything you expect from caramel corn, but the flavor profile is unique and delish with, dare I say, some yum umami going on from the fish sauce? Fish sauce is a sticky issue for lots of people. If that's you, it's not overwhelming, and the bit of lime is a perfect (and true to Pad Thai) fish sauce counter-flavor. So great savory stuff happening with this one, but definitely a sweet snack first, if you wondered. I used the suggested hot sauce substitute and that was fine. Some people like to shake extra salt on their popcorn. This one is tons of hot fun with a dusting of CAYENNE pepper, especially if the hot sauce doesn't kick as much as you want it to. I suggest reserving that extra ingredient for your own portion, however. Ha!

While an interesting treat, I found that it burned easily when using a foil lined tray.  I had much better results using a tray lined with a silicone mat.

Started to make this and remembered I was out of canola so...I used coconut oil in the sauce. Used half  a cup of popcorn and would go heaping next time, there was enough  sauce to cover. Since there was a hot element to this I used hot chili oil to pop the corn. Even with that and a full T of Sricacha I would have liked more heat. Added cilantro to each serving instead of the whole batch for ease in storing leftovers.

I just made 3 batches of this popcorn. It's so good; spicy, sweet, savory. I followed exactly...very simple. Hardest part for me is popping the corn! I used parchment paper and clean up was easy. The fresh cilantro adds a wonderful fresh flavor and looks great.

VERY interesting. At first I was not sure how I felt about this popcorn, but after devouring most of this by myself in a day 1/2, I guess I must have liked it a lot. Not sure I'll make again. I think I prefer caramel popcorn and traditional Pad Thai. But I would definitely recommend trying this out! Thanks Chef John!

Great recipe.  I love the balance of sweet and spicy.  However, I did have a few problems with the baking.  The first time I made this, I followed the direction for 45 minutes and it came out black. The second time around, I lowered the heat of the oven to 235, and baked it for about 20-25 minutes and it was perfect.

One other reviewer had it right: first taste is “interesting” and the enthusiasm for it just grows with each bite. Made this for a Family Olympics day where we were assigned Thailand. I am not well versed in that cuisine so went with two offers. This, hands down, was the best. Will make it again. I prepped everything in advance (kept the liquids in small bowl and within a sealed lunch bag - the fish sauce is not pleasant scent). Then made everything quickly.

I am not a fan of fish or fish sauce so I left that out, followed the recipe otherwise.  Wow!  What a burst of flavors! This is definitely my new go to snack when I am craving sweet and spicy.  I doubled the popcorn so I could stretch out yumminess a little longer.

SO freaking good!  Such an unexpected combo but wonderful - sweet and salty and spicy.  Friends I made it for loved it too, and I plan to make some for holiday gifts.  Be careful when adding the sugar/caramel syrup to the popcorn.  Some splattered onto my hand and yowsa the burn!  But my fault.  The recipe is grand.

This recipe is quite addictive, but a bit too sweet for my taste.  I ended up eating way too much of it, and feeling a little bit sick because all of the sugar.  So, my advice it to not binge on the delicious treat! Also, the cilantro really brings out the flavors.

I really liked this. I skipped the cilantro (unfortunately, it tastes like soap to me), and used 2T sriracha in place of the chili paste. I read other reviews that said there was enough sauce for more popcorn so I used a little over 1/2 cup popcorn and I wish I had used a lot more. That made about 14 cups popped corn (using the paper bag in microwave method) and I think that it would have tasted better with about 50% more popcorn with the same amount of sauce. I used 4oz of unsalted roasted peanuts and went at them with a mortar and pestle. I thought it was plenty salty and that was enough peanuts. My bf and I ate about half the recipe when it was done. I am trying to save the rest for tomorrow. 
I plan to make this at my parents' house for 4th of July. It was a lot easier than other caramel corns I've made.

Oh wow.  This is delicious!  I didn't have the chile paste so I used about 2 tsp of Sriracha and it is fantastic, even before adding the cilantro.

Made this for a cocktail party  -  weather was  too hot for cheese plate or dips. So this replaced at least one app . I left out the fish sauce because I want to do a trial run with that before guests. But it was delicious without, too. Just needed to salt a bit more because of that. Friends loved it!  And the cilantro was a big surprise to everyone, and added that freshness to complement the spice and sweet.

I made 4 different flavored popcorn recipes in 1 day for a party, and this was the favorite.  Sweet & spicy & savory.  I didn't make any changes, just made as written.

Strangely tasty. I added dried pineapple, cranberries and toasted pecans to the popcorn. Great sweet, salty, spicy taste.

If Cracker Jack had been invented in Thailand, this is what it would taste like.    My tastebuds jumped for joy!     There's a lot going on: the flavor is funky, sour, sweet, salty, savory.     Really great recipe, and highly recommended.   I reduce the sugar by about 1/3.

I like Pad Thai, but just didn't care for this.
