We have made this for Xmas eve family guests for the past 10 years or so, we do add chopped dill pickle to it and it is a family favourite.  We have also frozen it and dig into a few pieces for an afternoon snack

I also added chopped red bell pepper and black olives. The ladies at work loved them.
