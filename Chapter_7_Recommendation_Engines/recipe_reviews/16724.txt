This is without a doubt the BEST black bottom pie I have ever made or had!  The only problem is that I didn't make two - one just goes too fast!!

This pie is so good. My son-in-law loves this pie. It only gets baked when I go to visit.

This was the first time I've made Black Bottom Pie of any sort but am a fairly accomplished baker so I was very much looking forward to making and tasting this recipe. Of the recipes I saw this one had the most "real" ingredients, meaning it didn't use pudding mix or anything silly like that which is why I chose it. 

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out as I expected - it looked beautiful. I served it for Christmas dessert and it was such a disappointment. It was ok at best - don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything more than mediocre and for the amount of time and steps it took, it definitely wasn't worth it.

I am so happy to have found this recipe. Thank-you so much for posting it, I used to make this pie years ago,and lost the recipe. I made it yesterday and it was lovely.
