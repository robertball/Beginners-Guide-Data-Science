My family really liked these. Even my picky eaters gobbled them up. The only thing I did differently was use frozen blueberries and might I say we had some beautiful purplish blue pancakes. It made it seem fun to the kids to be eating pancakes of a different color. LOL! Will definitely be making again.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the batter was almost the consistency of cookie dough and the turned out like hard biscuits (the first 4). I used steel cut oats instead of rolled and almond oil instead of coconut oil because that's all I had on hand. The second batch I made, I added quite a bit of almond milk until the batter was more like pancake batter and then I put them on the griddle. They were quite dense but the kids loved them and they were much healthier than regular pancakes.

First of all, let me say that when I give a rating I consider three stars to be "just OK", for stars to be "hey, his is really good" and five stars to be "OMG this is awesome!" I don't understand how so many people can give this one to five stars. I found this particular recipe to be just OK, but nothing to write home about. I found the texture to be grainy and a bit crumbly. A little xanthan gum probably would've helped. I don't understand why honey would need to be added at all, the pancake syrup you put on afterwards is plenty sweet enough. I followed the recipe to the letter but I would definitely make some changes next time starting with professionally ground oat flour to remove the grainy texture, and I would add xanthan gum to control the crumbliness.  In this day and age with so many people being overweight, having type two diabetes or being pre-diabetic, perhaps substituting a little almond flour to lower the carbohydrates, and I find no need for honey at all.

Love, love, love! These are so delicious! The second time I made them I added a needs-to-be-used-now banana plus some freshly grated nutmeg. Even better. I took them to work for breakfast; they are great cold!

Absolutely delicious! I made these for the kids I'm babysitting (ages 11, 6, and 1) and they gobbled them up! I could have cut the amount of honey in half for myself, but I didn't want to risk it with kids that are used to syrup covered white flour pancakes. They are thicker than "normal" pancakes but I personally like them thicker. I will be making these again!

Phenomenal, better than regular pancakes!  Everybody loved them and I can't wait to make them again.  They weren't as fluffy as regular pancakes but still delicious I wouldn't change a thing.

These were a little on the heavy side, and could have been improved with the addition of some flour to lighten it up.  The upside is they were healthy.

I've made these twice. The first time I blended the oatmeal in my mini food processor, the second time I blended the oatmeal in my coffee grinder. The first ones had the taste and texture of baked oatmeal and the second ones taste more like regular pancakes. Both were delicious but if I want a pancake, I would grind up the oatmeal in my coffee grinder to get a finer oat flour. I topped them off with real maple syrup and served with a side of sausage. Delicious!!

Delicious and VERY filling.  Will definitely make again.  I added a little extra rice milk, as per another reviewer, and I think I would add even more next time to thin them out a bit.  Terrific recipe!

Did half a recipe but left the amount of cinnamon and vanilla same as called for the full batch...added stevia for extra sweetness and added a bit more almond milk to think the batter out and make more like pancake batter.  Served with maple syrup-taste like normal pancakes! Without syrup you can tell they are not normal but not bad though way better with maple syrup or honey at the end.  Next time  I will half the honey in the recipe and use more stevia in the batter and save the syrup or honey for the end to put on top of pancakes !!!!

I made one huge pancake out of the recipe.  I used steel cut oats and less honey than the recipe called for.  I would add more cinnamon next time.  Topped it w butter and syrup.  Very good!

These are delicious. I made it just as the recipe stated except with the following:  I used the coffee grinder to grind the oatmeal and it came out perfect - nice and fine like flour. (Thanks to another reviewer for this tip). I used Fairlife protein milk to add protein to the pancakes. Also I ended up adding about 1/2 C more milk because the batter was too thick.  I did not add blueberries to my pancakes as I don’t care for fruit in my pancakes.  When I plated them I added a bit of butter and sprinkled powdered sugar on them. :)     Next time I would eliminate the honey as they tasted too sweet for me or cut the honey in half. They are a heavier pancake and very filling. I must add that my husband didn’t care for them.  He’s stuck on old fashioned buttermilk.   But, I would make these again, for me. :)

Made half the recipe, used maple syrup instead of honey (only one tablespoon), use rice milk instead of almond milk, and when vanilla powder instead of vanilla extract. Not bad. Next time no maple syup and add banana.

Good, but too much sweetener to be considered healthy.  Next time I'm cutting the amount of honey in half.

Great recipe, I scale it down to one serving sometimes and it's so delicious.
