I just love prurple potatoes. I followed this recipe for the most part except I didn't have mushrooms and I added a little chopped garlic when I sauteed the onions.  The fresh terragon added a nice flavor. They tasted fabulous. My husband loved them and asked for more. I will make these again.

I just used standard potatoes, but I found this a very useful recipe as I was cooking for about 16 people, and found that if I cooked the muchrooms and onions ahead of time, I could then put the potatoes in the pan (I added zucchini, as well) and blacken juuust a bit and then put it in the warming oven for just about as long as I wanted to, and the potatoes would just continue to gain flavor and soften while the rest of my dishes cooked. Great recipe!

Sooo tasty.  For a lighter version, I parboiled the potatoes and grilled them with a light olive oil mist.  I also added feta cheese crumbles...yummy!!

I liked it. The tarragon was a nice addition. I like hot and spicy so I added half a seeded scotch bonnet. I increased the tarragon and as I'm not a vegetarian I used bacon fat as my oil.

Was doubting I'd like this, but it is delicious.  It had the substance of a meaty potato hash.    I water sauteed, used King Oyster mushrooms and a sweet yellow onion,  and used avocado oil to fry baby purple potatoes. Oh, I used  about  a quarter teaspoon of dried tarragon since I do not have fresh.   I'm cooking for one, so I had leftovers and I can't wait to reheat them for breakfast!

It was a hit in my house. I used less oil and doubled the red pepper flakes; had to use dried tarragon as I had no fresh. Definitely will make again.

Very tasty. I made it as written except I didn't have capers. I only had dried tarragon which was fine. I served it with a spicy brown mustard and it was delicious.

I almost followed the recipe exactly except: I omitted capers and tarragon; I added diced red peppers, dry basil and garlic powder; And I added the red peppers flakes when I first cooked the potatoes, cooking time was about 5 minutes less than suggested. I made Cuban style tostones and added an avocado spread (to which I added, pepper, salt & a lime squeeze to the avocado). And before I scooped potato mixture on top, I diced the cooked the potatoes so there would be bright purple exposed - I only do that for presentation purposes). Makes a great vegetarian side dish or app. I uploaded the picture of the final product

This was something that I definitely experimented in doing. I didn't add the mushrooms but followed all other steps. It was a pretty good dish, if I make it again I'll definitely be playing around with it some.
