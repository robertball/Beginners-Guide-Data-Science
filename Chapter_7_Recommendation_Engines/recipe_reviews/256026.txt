Well Crystal you were absolutely correct!!! Our taste buds danced while eating this!! Husband, kids (age 4&5) claimed how good this was. Great flavors. Aside from the ground mustard I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought 1 Tablespoon of ground mustard would be to strong for the kids,so, I used 1 teaspoon ground mustard & 3/4 teaspoon prepared Dijon mustard and I also used regular white wine instead of cooking wine. I cooked the salmon in my cast iron skillet.  Definitely will make again. Thank you.

We actually mixed the honey into the butter mixture, but it came out phenomenal so that’s our tweak to the recipe. Put it over rice, and drank a glass of Sauvignon Blanc with it and was extremely satisfied. So we’re making it again.

It took me much longer to cook than 15 min 5 with the honey but boy was it worth the wait!!! I don't like spicy either so I replaced the Tabasco sauce with sweet red chilly peppers. It turned out fantastic anyway!
