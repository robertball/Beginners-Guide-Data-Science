This was sooo good. Made in a 9x13 cake pan and it was great. Brought this to a company "food day" and it was gobbled up! I made a couple of adjustments...added more peanut butter to cream cheese and more surgar. I just 'taste tested' until I got the flavor I wanted. I also used real whipping cream instead of the frozen and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband gobbled this right up.  I may try using peanut butter in place of the butter in the crust next time to give it an even richer taste.

This was only ok.  I found the crust too peanutty and there wasn't enough sweetness to counteract it.  It has a very mild flavor that isn't really worth the effort of this pie.  Peanut Butter Pie I is much better.

Yummy Yum! Made this for a Weekend Family Get together. I only changed a few things to tweak the recipe to my needs. I used chopped walnuts instead of peanuts. I used Margarine becuase that's all I had on hand. I kicked the milk up to 1% from skim. And I didn't sprinkle the top with nuts due to health reason and I can't have to many nuts. So I just put on extra grated chocolate on top. Excellent dessert. You won't be sorry you made it!

I used to make something similar to this but lost the recipe. This was the closest thing I could find, and I just made teh adjustments from what I could remember. I used Vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers, and inthe chocolate pudding layer, i added 1 tsp of rum extract. After the chocolate pudding layer, I slice bananas and layer them on the chocolate layer. Cover with Cool Whip, and chopped nuts, and it tasted just like a hot fudge, peanut buster parfait with bananas...yummmmmmmmmmy!

I first made this dessert to take to a covered dish lunch at my church.  It was gone in a flash.  The second time was for my 10 year-old son's birthday.  He asked for it instead of a traditional cake.  It was really delicious!

I know this recipe by drumstick torte and I lost the recipe and I am so glad that I found it again. This recipe is awesome. I have made this plenty of times and each time it was a hit. My family loves it.

I made this for my husband before we were married, and I later found out that he ate the entire pie in one sitting because he didn't want to share it with his brother!  Now we eat it together... and I make extras for family and company!

Oh my! This is heaven in a pie shell!  This is the best pudding pie I have ever tasted.  It's absolutely perfect.  Next time I will have to make two because my family of five gobbled this one up in mere minutes.  Thank you SO much for this recipe.

This recipe is ok.  I think the crust needs something.  Maybe some sugar??  Probably won't make again (I have another recipe I like better).  Thanks!
