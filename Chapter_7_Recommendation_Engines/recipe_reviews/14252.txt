This is absolutely one of my favorite salad recipes! I have made this many times and tweek this depending on what I have on hand. I usually shred one carrot, add some celery, cucumber, cilantro, bean sprouts, mandarin oranges, and fresh button mushrooms. The fried noodles found in a can are easier than frying your own... or sometimes I add some slivered almonds to add a bit of crunch. Also, instead of using iceberg, I prefer to use romaine/spinach or a spring green mix. The dressing is absolutely delicious but I usually halve the amount of oil used in the recipe to make it healthier; doesn't make a difference!  I've made this both with seasoned and unseasoned rice vinegar and I prefer the seasoned one in this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Great!  Here is what I did differently.  For my greens I used a head of Napa cabbage and a head of romaine chopped well.  I added in a lot of thickly shredded carrot, some chopped red bell pepper, chopped sugar snap peas, and cilantro.  I toasted some slivered almonds and used instead of sesame seeds.  I prepared the rice noodles as written because I couldn't find the prepared ones other reviewers had mentioned and don't care much for the canned chow mein noodles.  I'm not sure it is worth the effort and the salad would be fine without them as long as you put almonds in for the crunch.  Here is the real time saver.  I bought a rotisserie chicken from Safeway and pulled the meat off the bone and shredded it up into a bowl.  I doubled the recipe for the dressing, adding a bit less vegetable oil than called for, and used half of it to mix into the shredded chicken and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours marinating until I prepared the salad.  This made the chicken taste incredible!  I mixed everything together in a big bowl except the rice noodles and dressing and when we got to the pot luck I mixed it all together. Fantastic dressing recipe and you can make the salad to suit your taste.  I recommend chopping everything into small pieces so you can get a little of everything in every bite.

Yum!  The dressing is a dead-ringer for the ones used on Wendy's Mandarin Chicken Salad and also the asian chicken salads served at Chili's, Houston's and Panera Bread.  It seriously should be printed in one of those "secret restaurant recipes revealed" cookbooks.  Follow the exact recipe and you will not be disappointed.  The only change I would make is...do not fry your own noodles, as suggested.  It's a mess and not worth the effort.  Look for pre-made fried, rice noodles (La Choy brand) in your asian food section at the grocery store.  Pre-made crispy, wonton strips also work well.  Also, though it's listed as "optional," you should include the sesame oil.  It gives the dressing a rich, but subtle, nutty flavor. Sliced water chestnuts, a little cilantro and mandarin orange segments also add more interest to the plain salad greens.

Delicious dressing!  For convenience, I substituted a small can of chow mein noodles for the rice noodles, which eliminated Step 2 of the recipe.  Instead of the toasted sesame seeds, I used slivered almonds. I added mandarin oranges.  This is a keeper!

Thank you, Jill! I have searched for the perfect Asian dressing for my variation of this salad, and I will forever use your recipe! This is my all-time favorite salad! This recipe is GREAT as is, but here's what I do differently: For my greens, I use a combination of Napa cabbage, romaine lettuce, and iceberg lettuce. I use broken up Ramen noodles instead of the rice noodles, and I don't saute' them or anything - just straight out of the wrapper and break them up. I usually marinate my chicken in soy sauce or a bought Asian marinade. I also add toasted almonds, which is my favorite part! I mix the greens, green onions, and chicken together and store separately from the ramen noodles, sesame seeds, and almonds to keep them crunchy the next day, if there are leftovers that is! Awesome!

This is a 5 with a few changes. Must add a good shake of Garlic powder and ground ginger. Also, I added a bit of white wine vinegar in addition to the rice vinegar, cut back a little on the super sweetness. I made mine with napa cabage and spinach leaves, grated up  carrots, cucumber, chow mein noodles, and added cashews as I didn't have almonds, also added the seeds. My chicken I had already boiled the night before, so it was cold, I tore it in chunks and soaked it in some of the dressing before adding it to the salad. FANTASTIC!! Tip: when mixing dressings add all the ingrediants together before adding the oil, allows the flavors to meld better.

This recipe has great flavor, but the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil is too much.  Cut back the oil to 3 tbsp and you will still retain the great flavor.  I love the multiple variations that you can build on to make it unique to one's family.  Thanks for the submission!

Amazing Taste!  Restaurant quality.  Will make again and again.  Be sure to make extra dressing.  It's delicious.  Be sure to let dressing stand for 30 minutes.  The dressing doesn't taste as good, any sooner than 30.  I bought chow mein noodles (instead of rice noodles) and added mandarin oranges in the can.

DISASTER! How are you supposed to cook an entire package of rice noodles "a little bit at a time" with 2 TBS of oil?? I kept adding oil but the noodles never "puffed up" and I had noodle twigs all over the kitchen, even in my hair. My dear husband came in and opened the doors and windows to let out all the smoke, but they were still the needles that you get when you don't cook them "long enough." Is 5 minutes long enough? 20 minutes? "A bit at a time" and I would have been cooking those stupid rice noodles for 2 hours. 

We aren't picky eaters; my husband is game for anything, but we picked out the chicken chunks and the rest went in the compost. 

Later a friend pointed me to the eHow article on How to Fry Rice Noodles, which would have been very helpful. For instance, put an INCH of oil in the pan, not two tablespoons! http://www.ehow.com/how_2150226_fry-rice-noodles.html

I really enjoyed this salad. Just about any combination of veggies go well with this dish. I always double the dressing and add mandarin oj's, almonds and red bell pepper strips. Usually I don't have rice noodles, so I sautee some ramen noodles without the packet.  Sometimes I just make the dressing and serve it over shredded cabbage and shredded broccoli mix for a quick lunch. Thanks bunches Jill.

Excellent dressing (do use the sesame oil, add a few dashes of ground ginger and do make extra!!). I added fresh pea pods and mandarin orange slices to the salad ingredients.     Here's a great modification that makes the chicken really stand out (instead of  bland cooked shredded chicken-yuck). Thinly slice the chicken breasts and lightly coat with a mixture of 1/4 cup each flour & cornstarch, and 1/4 tsp. each of salt, pepper and garlic powder; stir fry on med-high heat till light brown and crispy -- about 8-10 minutes. You will like the results!

I love Chinese chicken salad and this recipe is great. However, for some reason, brown sugar kills the acidity of rice vinegar, so this is best made with white sugar (I know it's not healthy, but...). The first time I made it, I had doubts but I stuck with brown sugar and the dressing came out kind of bland. So, next time, I made it with white sugar, and it came out fantastic! Also, as other reviewers have suggested, vegetable oil can easily be reduced to half (combination of 2 tbsp of vegetable oil and 1 tbsp of sesame oil worked great for me). I was too lazy to make the noodles myself, so I bought a packet of fried wonton strips from the store. I also added mandarin oranges, sliced almonds, and shredded carrots. I made it with Romaine lettuce (just because I like Romaine better) and it was delicious. It is now my favorite salad!!

This is a hall of famer...should go in the next Allrecipes cookbook. My wife, a big asian chicken salad fanatic, said it was the best one she's ever had. She ate three servings worth! I did what everyone else did: 2 x dressing, marinade chicken in dressing, added canned mandarins, cut oil by half. Absolutely the best. Thank you for submitting it.

This salad is wonderful. I did make a change to it that made it even better. Since I was preparing the chicken for the salad, and not using leftovers, I decided to bake the chicken breasts whole. After they cooled, I shredded them and tossed the shredded pieces in a mixture of 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup white sugar. Then I baked the chicken again for about 45 min at 375. The chicken was amazing! Almost carmelized and so flavorful. Please try it. It will make this great salad even tastier! Thanks for the recipe!

The dressing was WONDERFUL!  I added some chopped cilantro, sliced red bell pepper and roasted asparagus (so yummy!).  I just roasted the asparagus in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes after tossing it in olive oil and salt and pepper.  It really adds a nice nutty flavor and cruch to the salad.  I will be making this again and again!

I was looking for a recipe similar to Wendy's Mandarin Chicken Salad. This one is very similar. I have tried it three times now and I like the dressing better with an extra table spoon of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, and 1/4 tsp ground ginger...and absolutly add the sesame oil. Delicious.

This was so great, but because I made so many additions. Just like most others, I added toasted sliced almonds (bake @ 350 for 6-8 mins), mandarin oranges, and chow mein noodles (in place of rice noodles). I used basalmic vinegar in place of rice because it's what I had on hand. It was fine, but I would rather have had rice. All in all, this was fabulous, and did in fact taste like the Wendy's salad.
UPDATED REVIEW: I have since made this with the rice vinegar, and found we liked the basalmic better.

I love this recipe as is... but a previous reviewer made this even better for me.  Use white sugar instead of brown, omit the soy sauce, and add a pinch of cilantro to the dresssing.  This gives you something very, very close to the Asian Sesame Chicken salad at Panera / St. Louis Bread Company... so good!  Whether following the recipe as is or with these changes, I always cut the vegetable oil at least in half and I prefer to use wonton strips that I've crisped up in the oven instead of the noodles.

Great! Very light. I used rotisserie chicken shredded and it was delicious. Next time I will add a tsp of sesame seeds or use sesame seed oil.

Ooooh, delicious!!  If I had ordered it in a restaurant, I would have been delighted!   I halved the oil in the dressing, and it still worked great!  Fried the noodles, just for fun, but the Chinese noodles from the store would have worked fine, and been a lot less work!  Thank you for something we're going to make A LOT!

As good as any restaurant salad!  I made some changes (per reviewer suggestions):  I used Napa cabbage and Romaine lettuce, 1 chopped red bell pepper, shredded carrot, and mandarin oranges.  I marinated the meat in the dressing in advance  and used store bought rice noodles.  Personally I had to triple the dressing (one for the chicken, two for the salad), but I think I had a lot more servings once I added all the extras.

OMG!!!! jlo, this was AMAZING!!! this may just be my favorite recipe thus far from this site?! based on waht i read from teh otehr reviews i made these 'changes'/additions and i could not stop eating this amazing dish: (1) i used 1/3 teh amount of the recommended veggie oil (2) i agree that the sesame oil is NOT optional (3) i used romaine sliced thinly + 1/2 bag of preshred coleslaw mix (?) (4) added cucumbers and red bell pepper (5) added garlic powder ot the marinade (6) doubled the marinade and used 1/3 to marinate the chicken 1.5 hours (7) used those superthin perdue chicken breast slices adn once cooked, sliced them superthinly. (8) added mandarin oranges (9) i don't like chow mein noodles, nor do i like the ramen noodle idea, so i wanted to buy those yummy crunchy noodles  from the chinese takeout, but decided against it last minute cuz i got tired/lazy.

the salad was AMAZING!!! i gobbled it up like a little kid. you HAVE to try this recipe. i chose it over the others cuz i already had 80% of this version's ingredients at home. YUMMY!

I recently had an Oriental Chicken Salad at a popular gourmet pizza restaurant which was really, really good.  So I set out to find a recipe which could duplicate that taset.  This is definately it.  This salad is wonderful, the secret is the dressing, which you should definately double.  I also made some substitutions which worked out well.  I used a combination of romaine and iceberg lettuce and in lieu of vegetable oil I used olive oil.  I only used the olive oil because I had used the last of the vegetable oil to fry beer battered fish (this web site) and forgot to buy more.  I think the dressing was a little heavier and slightly more pungent than if I had used vegetable oil.  But it still tasted great.  I will definately make this again.

I made this for dinner, a couple of night ago, and it was spicy, colorful, crunchy and absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe for the dressing and I'm really happy I did as my husband said it was so good he could "drink it" and I used it to marinate the chicken. I also made a few changes to personalize the taste. I added mandarine oranges, 1/2 cup of toasted almonds, and used baby salad greens and spinach insted of iceburg. I also added about a Tbl garlic oil to the dressing. I did not have brown sugar or sesame seeds, on hand, so I substituted honey and left out the sesame seeds. This dressing is so versatile and yummy I will be using it on various meats, poultry and fish. This is definately a "keeper" and I will be repeating frequently. Thanks for sharing.

This salad is a dead ringer for the one served at Applebee's. I use canned rice noodles - much easier and less messy. I also add mandarin oranges and fresh strawberries, sliced. Place those around the edge of the salad for a pretty look. Sometimes I add slices of apple too. It's wonderful!!

I'm sure this is an excellent dressing for this salad. But if your short on time, Trader Joes has a salad dressing called "cha cha chinesee chicken salad. It so good I use it in all kinds of recipes. Not to detrack from this recipe, just giving some time saving idea's.

Loved, loved, loved this. This is what an Asian chicken salad should taste like! One thing: do NOT omit the sesame seed oil. That's what makes the dressing really shine!

Desperate for something to do with left over chicken, I found this recipe and made the dressing at the last minute.  Didn't have all of the ingredients, so I made a few substitutions.  I used chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles and only used 2 T of vegetable oil.  Luckily I had sesame oil, not optional in my mind.  But the sesame seeds kind of get lost in the salad.  The dressing tasted as good as the Oriental chicken salad dressing at Applebees.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!!!

I was a little unsure about this recipe until I tasted it.  It is awesome.  My husband loved it too.  The only thing I did differently was add canned rice noodles and added mandarin oranges.  Will make many more times!!!

made this for a barbeque and it was a hit...I added chinese cabbage, the ready made chow mein noodles...mandarin orange slices and almonds.  The dressing brought it all together nicely.  Will definitely make again.

A sweet/tangy and mild flavor.  Just like the salad I get at a local restaurant.
I didn't have rice noodles but found some slivered almonds in my pantry so I toasted them and it was very good.  It added a crunchy texture.   I used a few tablespoons less oil as one review suggested and didn't miss it.

This is a great tasting asian chicken salad that is also easy to make!  I highly recommend this recipe if you like this type of salad.  I've also added chopped water chestnuts and used green leaf lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce.

I have made this several times and we all just love it! I never have leftover chicken with big men in my house so I boil the chicken in broth for 15-20 minutes, let the chicken cool in the broth(keeps it moist) while I make the dressing for the salad. Drain the chicken and then chop it up. This recipe is in my regular rotation now! Thanks a million!

This dressing is exactly what I have been trying to create.  It tastes like the dressing on the Asian salad at Panera.  I like to make the salad with mixed spring greens and some snow peas.  Adding crispy noodles makes it even better.  Thanks so much for this dressing recipe.

This was a wonderful dish. Very refreshing!! After eating this, my husband and I felt great. No guilt. It was so good that immediately made it for my best friend and her husband. CHANGES: I doubled the dressing recipe, but only used a total of 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. Also added freshly grated ginger, cherry/grape tomatoes, La Choy canned rice noodles (instead of having to fry them as called for in the recipe)and slivered almonds (in place of the sesame seeds).  All of these changes made for an easy and delicious salad. Will definitely make again and again!!!

Very Good~I added a little ginger and garlic to the dressing, which I also doubled. I then added mandarin oranges and water chestnuts to the salad. I put a few red bell pepper slivers in as well. I did not add the rice noodles. I used chow mein noodles instead because it was much easier and very tasty. I seasoned the chicken breast with garlic, pepper, salt and a touch of ginger. Very good, refreshing recipe. Will definitly make again and pass it on to friends! Thanks!!

I have to agree with other reviewers that the dressing was a little week.  The taste was fine, but it was too thin and pooled at the bottom of my plate rather than adhereing to the salad.  I used left over sesame baked chicken and canned rice noodles to save time and mess.  I love the idea, but will replace the dressing with something else next time.

Yummy! This recipe is easy to make and very good.  I used the canned crunchy noodles because I couldn't find the ones listed in the recipe. I also toasted some almond slices which was a very nice addition. I used iceburg lettuce, but next time I think I'll try with 1/2 iceburg 1/2 romaine. I think this recipe is better for eating at home, because the lettuce becomes transparent and limp after just a few minutes of contact with the dressing. But it tastes so good, we had it almost eaten before that happened!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The dressing is particularly good.  I used mixed salad greens, left out the green onions, and then added mandarin oranges and toasted almonds.  I used Chinese rice noodles this time, but I think this would be equally good with chow mein noodles.

Very good salad and went great with our lunch of burgers hot off the grill! I grilled the chicken breasts lightly seasoned with lemon pepper and garlic powder. Also, I omitted the rice noodles and used some chow mein noodle instead. Mixed all together and was well received!

After 15 years of marriage I have made a meat salad for dinner.  My hubby is a meat and potatoes kinda guy and likes his salad on the side.  Me on the other hand, truely love things like this.  Light and easy.  I followed the recipe to the T, right down to frying my own noodles.  Not sure if I would do the noodles again.  My hubby liked them alot, but I don't like deep frying in my house.  It was cool to see them puff up and they add a good little crunch, but I think next time I would break up some ramen noodles and sprinkle them on.  The dressing was the best thing EVER!!  Hubby didn't feel quite full, so he grabbed the extra chicken thigh that was left and pulled it off the bone and added the leftover dressing on top of the chicken.  He told me I could make this dish anytime I feel like it, it's the best salad he's had in a long time.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!!

Fantastic! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the dressing!  This was a huge hit with the whole family.  I added wonton strips, used boston Bibb lettuce, mandarin oranges, bean sprouts and sliced honey roasted almonds.  I can't wait to have this again tomorrow.  Thanks so much for sharing, this really is fantastic.

I added a clove of crushed garlic and ginger, made quite an improvement in the overall taste of the dressing.  I also halved the amount of vegetable oil. Amazing dressing!
I added shredded carrots, red cabbage, water chestnuts to the salad as well. My husband absolutely loved it! 
Search is over to the perfect chinese salad recipe!

This was a really great jumping off point.  We loved the dressing.  I used my hand blender to blend the dressing & it made it really creamy & smooth.  That was fun, I haven't tried that before.  Also, I'd second what somebody else said about the sesame oil not being optional.  I used tahini and it really enhances the flavor of the dressing. I'll have to tried the seasoned rice vinegar as somebody else suggested.  Kids voted this one a keeper recipe.

This was very good, as a starter recipe.  But, I *did* make a lot of changes, for it to suit our taste.  I give it a 5, because the final product was very tasty, and we will definitely be making this one regularly.  Dressing:  I added all the sesame oil (mandatory for flavor, I feel).  I added only HALF of the vegetable oil called for in the recipe.  When I tasted the dressing later, it tasted way too heavy on the oil.  I added extra rice vinegar and soy sauce...  in particular the additional  rice vinegar dramatically improved the dressing.  I would say that it is a good idea to cut way down on the vegetable oil, it tastes better and is healthier with less oil.  Chicken:  I sauteed it, and sprinkled garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Salad:  I used darker  lettuce (romaine & green leaf) since it's healthier than iceberg.  I did NOT use any rice noodles---  the salad tasted great without it, and the noodles are unhealthy because they're fried & time-consuming to make.  Instead for texture, I added sliced almonds & cashews.   I added extra veggies to our salad--  diced carrot, purple cabbage, some green bell pepper, a can of mandarin oranges, and cilantro.  I believe the addition of all the flavors, greatly enhanced the taste.  Next time, I will try the other reviewers' suggestion of doubling the dressing, and using some of it to marinate the chicken, that sounds tasty.

My husband and I had to give this a 5. We made a few changes wqhich were suggested by others, we added a can of mandarin oranges, and a can of sliced  Water Chestnuts. We used the La Choy Rice noodles off the grocery store shelf. We also doubled the dressing and let the cooked chicken marinate in it for a while. There were several different suggestions for the "greens' and we went with mixed greens - but the others would have worked wonderfully. It was FABULOUS! And we don't give this rating very often. If you do the dressing "right" you can't really fail with this.

i agree with the previous reviewer in that this needs a lot of tweeking. this is a great recipe in itself, but if you like the peanut taste, add 1 large tablespoon of peanut butter to the dressing (heat for about 30 in microwave to blend better)...this makes it taste soooo better. i do add some white balsamic vinegar and olive oil to balance out the flavors. can marinate the chicken in some garlic and soy sauce. garnish with some flavored slivered almonds that you can buy in the salad section at the store. i do too use the romaine lettuce, this just adds to the flavor...this then tastes a lot like the wendy's brand of oriental chicken salad. thanks for the great recipe in print now...this is a great potluck recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe if you are looking for a recipe that is reminiscent of many popular restaurant recipes for asian chicken salads. The dressing is super delicious, i was a bit worried when i first mixed it. Definitely give it more than a half hour to let the flavors meld. I used Wishbone and soy sauce as a marinade and grilled the chicken. You simply must add cilantro as well. Yum! Will make this again and again!

Only thing I left out were the dried noodles.  It was good.  I think I might try something a little different with this next time I make it.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent flavor. I omitted the toasted sesame seeds (only because I didn't have any on hand) and used romaine and red leaf lettuce rather than the standard iceburg. I also crushed some ramen noodles up on a cookie sheet, sprayed with fat free cooking oil, and baked for 10 mins @ 350 instead of frying rice noodles. Turned out excellent; will make again!

This is probably the best Asian chicken salad I've ever tasted.  I make double the amount of dressing so that I can marinate the chicken in it.  I also use crushed up ramen noodles instead of the chinese rice noodles, and it turned out fine.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely love chinese/asian/oriental chicken salad (whatever you want to call it) and I have to say that I love the recipe for this dressing!  It is amazing!  I agree with other reviewers...the sesame oil, while listed as "optional" is what makes the dressing so definitely use it.  Also, I always use the store-bought noodles.  I'm all for doing things home-made whenever possible but in this particular case, the store bought stuff is the way to go.

I added a pound of cooked chicken (shredded) and doubled the dressing and served it on the side so people could control how much they wanted.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was relatively easy to make.  I used my food processor's cutting blade to 'shred' the cabbage.

This is an awesome salad that got rave reviews from my guests!  I substituted the plain iceberg lettuce for a lovely mixture found ready made at my grocery store.  I also couldn't find the rice vinegar so I substituted white wine vinegar and it turned out great!  One other thing, I didn't have time to cook up those noodles so I just used the ready made ones (can't remember what they're called, but they put them on soup) and they really added a nice crunch to the salad.  Again, it was great, and soooo easy to make!

I used this recipe to make salads for two holiday parties and it was a hit both times.
I found I liked the recipe better with slightly less sesame oil and by adding Napa cabbage.  I also cut wonton squares into strips, fried them and added them in place of the noodles.  Overall, this recipe was easy, yummy, and a new favorite.  I especially like the dressing.

Based on the dressing alone, I think this is a 5 star recipe. I have been looking far and wide for this type of dressing. And the fact that I know exactly what is in it makes it that much better. I do think that the use of the Sesame Oil is a must and I used light olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Thanks for sharing!

This was outstanding! I served this one night when I had a dinner guest.  I prefer to use Napa cabbage when making this type of salad, and also used the prepackaged Chinese fried noodles.  I also used sesame oil and it definitely adds to flavor!  Will make this over and over!

Very different and very yummy! Although hubby didn't care for it nor the dressing (thus the 4 stars). I followed the recipe but (as per other reviewers) added bean sprouts, baby corns, mandarin oranges. I left out the dried rice noodles and added the crunchy lo mein noodles. I also didn't have leftover chicken so I marinated chicken breasts in soy sauce, sesame oil (Just a touch! A little goes a long way!), ground ginger, garlic powder, vinegar and canola oil (I just eyeballed everything) for about 3 hours and then grilled it. Oh, I also used leaf lettuce instead of iceberg and I forgot to add the sesame seeds. I left the dressing on the side so people could add what they wanted. I'm bringing the rest in for lunch tomorrow! Thanks!

The dressing is awesome! Restaurant flavor - I added 1/8 t ground ginger and 1/2 t chopped garlic. I added a drained can of mandarin oranges and 1/2 c of sliced almonds. I should have toasted them as they got lost in the salad. Thanks for the recipe, Jill. I'll be serving this at a bridal shower this weekend!

This recipe is really awesome.  The only change I made was to add the store bought "wonton strips", most grocery stores sell them now in the produce section.  My preference is the "garlic/ginger" ones, they go really well with the flavours.  Also, I add a couple of handfuls of the bagged coleslaw you find in the salad section of your grocery store.  Wow, what a nice mixture (usually red and green cabbage and some slivered carrots).  Sometimes I add the toasted almonds, but if I don't have any on hand, this is still an amazing recipe.  And I have to agree with the previous reviewer, do not omit the sesame oil.  It really is a great addition, not just to this salad, but to many other Asian inspired recipes!!  Great dressing!!

Delish!!! I followed advice of other reviewers and used Naoa Lettuce, mandarin oranges, and almond slivers.  It was a hit with the husband! I would def. double the dressing amount as you will want to use it! Also, marinating the chicken ahead of time really makes the dish complete. Marinate it any sesame oil marinade and it will work great!

Really yummy!  I just used chicken breasts (marinated in teriyaki sauce for about 20 minutes).  I also added mandarin oranges.  I substituted chow mein noodles for the rice noodles.  The dressing was fantastic!!  Definitely leaving this one in my recipe box!

Just excellent!  I doubled the dressing and used 2 bags of "lettuce only" salad mix.  To add flavor, I pulled my chicken from a rotissiere bird from the store.  I also had won ton wrappers on hand.  Cut strips and fried in a little pan.  Wonderful recipe...thanks!

This is a good base recipe to start with but I had to tinker with it to get it to our liking. I doubled the dressing, but, I used a total of 3 TBS of brown sugar and this was plenty, the sesame oil is a MUST, I used a total of 1/4 cup of canola oil (this means I actually cut the original recipe oil in half) but this still seemed a bit much. Hubby liked it though, so what they hey. As far as the rice noodles, I just used chow mein noodles. I used a bag of precut mixed greens, changed out toasted almonds for sesame seeds. I used leftover chicken from last night (Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style). This was out of this world and even my picky 16 year old enjoyed! This dressing really is delicious!

Just the dressing I've been looking for and much simpler than the ones I've tried.  I reduced the vegetable (canola) oil to 2 Tbsp and definitely used the sesame oil.  It would just be another vinaigrette without it.  Added Mandarin oranges.  Used chow mein noodles, crushed.  Great light supper that was ready in 10 minutes.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe. Like previous reviewers I doubled the dressing and used half of it as a marinade. I only marinated the chicken for an hour, but that was plenty. I didn't use the sesame seeds, but next time I think I'll use sliced toasted almonds. As previous reviewers suggested I added mandarin oranges, and I bought the pre-made rice noodles. I'm not a fan of iceberg lettuce, so I used organic baby greens, and rather than mixing everything prior to serving I layered the ingredients over the greens right on each plate. My husband even loved it and he's not a big salad person.

I thought the dressing was a bit too oily, though my boyfriend loved it.  I'm going to try using less vegetable oil next time, and maybe a little more rice vinegar.  I also agree with the other comments...you need to marinate the chicken.

Absolutely excellent!  The dressing was amazing (I followed others' suggestions and doubled it) and I used the chow mein noodles instead as well.  This will definitely become a regular on my table!

Marinated my chicken in McCormicks's Ginger Teriyaki, and grilled. I think I can pass on the cellophane noodles as they add nothing for me but I might try chow mein noodles next time. The dressing was surprisingly good for what is very few ingredients. I have a recipe for the Wendy's Sesame dressing that is excellent, but it takes dribs and drabs of about 20 different ingredients, so this was nice for the simplicity factor. It was a good experiment for a very warm January day.

This salad is great! I added shredded carrots to it and left out the green onions. I also added a little more brown sugar to the dressing because I liked it sweeter. My husband and I both loved this and I will definitely make it again!

I marinated chicken breast before cooking and this added more flavor to the recipe. I cheated a little and used canned rice noodles for an easier recipe. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.

No words to describe the yummy goodness going on in my mouth as I eat it at this very moment.  I could DRINK the dressing by itself.  Only change was I used the crunchy chow mein noodles instead of frying up rice nooodles.

This is delicious! I made it according to the recipe but with the modifications: I omitted the chicken and added toasted almond slivers and canned mandarin orange slices. I added the sesame seeds to the dressing I also used commercial toasted/baked rice noodles and 50/50 baby spinach and salad greens in lieu of iceberg lettuce and making my own noodles. Served with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/grilled-five-spice-chicken/detail.aspx and fried rice.

I'm glad I found this! I made this recipe as is with the exception of the noodles as I did not have them on hand. I used leftover boneless skinless bbq'd chicken breasts and the bbq flavor was a nice touch. I will sometimes go to a restaurant that makes a very good salad similar to this and pay more that I want to for a salad because I like it so much, and I had not previously figured out how to master the dressing. Not anymore! There is always leftover bbq chicken at my house and now I can use it to make a favorite salad. Next time I would add some pineapple tidbits as that is how the restaurant makes the salad I like. This is a great addition to the summer salads that are on there way! 

I am rating this as five stars because as is, it is a great find I plan to make many times in the future.

VERY good, but I did do many of the reviewers' suggested modifications - garlic powder, ginger, extra veggies, cutting the oil way down, marinating the chicken and stir fry, etc.  That's the only reason why I gave this particular recipe 4 stars.  But it was a VERY good starting point.  Thank you for sharing Jill!!

this is my favorite salad recipe on this site. Every time I make this, I can't get enough of it .... I eat it for lunch, or as a light dinner. definitely use the sesame oil, it is the key ingred. in making this salad what it is  :))) I usually use asian soup noodles (Ramen, or very thin vermicelli), and I blanch the noodles in hot water for a minute to soften them, then drain them and saute them in a nonstick pan with the green onion and sesame seeds... I cook until lightly crispy/browned. I use a rotisserie chicken, and shred it. I cut down on the oil a tad, and use olive oil instead... I sometimes use slivered almonds, or mandarin oranges, but this salad is just as tasty without.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I used Salmon instead of chicken, and I omitted the noodles entirely.  I added a crunch by throwing in some water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and sliced almonds which I had sauteed in a bit of oil and soy sauce until the shoots turned golden brown.  I also made two batches of dressing, using one to marinate the salmon for half an hour before baking it.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I like a previous reviewer, used broken Ramen soup noodles instead of rice ones.  I added canned mandarin oranges.  To the marinade/dressing I added ground ginger and some black pepper, cut the oil amount in half, kept the sesame oil(!) and used about half to marinate the cooked chicken cubes.  I also added sugared almond slices.  (1/2 cup sliced almonds and 2 tablespoons sugar cooked on low and stir to coat - keep an eye on 'em). Yum!

My family loves this recipe!  Filling, delicious, and a great summertime dinner.  I use Romaine and a bit of already shredded iceburg, and I add cilantro to the salad mix.  For the dressing I use more sesame oil and less vegetable oil, and I also add ginger.  To make it quicker and easier I use pre-made rice noodles (LaChoy).  More is better with the sesame seeds and green onion, and we also serve it with mandarin oranges.

WONDERFUL!  I could drink the dressing - that really makes the salad.  I used my Pampered Chef Asian seasoning for the chicken.  I bought the wrong rice nooodles, but it was still good.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe "as is" was OK. The dressing was way to oily for our taste but we liked the basic concept and tried it a second time. We used only 1 tbs of oil and more rice vinegar. I doubled the dressing described with the oil adjustment and that made enough for 2 of us. Whenever we bbq chicken I cooked 2 extra pieces just for this salad which made next days dinner . I also used chopped cabbage and some lettuce. We added some mandrin oranges too. It turned out to be a great summer staple for us.

Amazing! Thanks for sharing. The only thing I did differently was to mix up the dressing and pour it over the shredded chicken and let it set overnight in the fridge. The next time I make this (which will be soon), I will still marinate overnight but I will drain off the chicken, reserving the marinade and serving it on the side rather than pour and toss because this salad seems to "shrivel" quickly but you can't beat the taste!!!!!!  I did double the marinade and it seemed about the right amount.

I love this recipe! The flavors are fantastic and you can easily change up the ingredients to suit your pantry/frig while keeping the delicious chicken flavor intact. When I am in a hurry I use the breast meat from a roasted chicken bought in the grocery store deli. Letting the chicken marinate in the dressing give it extra kapow.

This is what you would get in a fine restaurant. The sesame oil is NOT optional, but the seeds are. I poured this over cabbage and let sit for an hour. I think cabbage may be better than lettuce--lettuce tends to get soggy fast.

We just finished enjoying this tasty salad which lends itself to many variations with on-hand ingredients. I finished off leftover 1/2 rotisserie chicken with a combo of all the greens in my fridge. Added mushrooms, an orange, chopped green onions, radishes and grated carrot. Also took the advice of others and cracked open a pkg of ramen noodles (raw) for the crunch, along with toasted almonds AND sesame seeds. The dressing adds the flavorful oriental essence that makes this a truly special "chicken salad".

Love this recipe but use Newman's Own Lighten Up! Low-Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing with only 35 calories per 2 TB.Then I can add a slice of warm sourdough bread if I like.

It's true, the dressing recipe ROCKS!  I had Wendy's salad recently and Wendy's version doesn't even come close to this one.  The whole thing was great.  Throw the sesame seeds in with the dressing so you can skip a step when you're having to serve up lots of salads for guests.  Just shake the bottle well each time you do it.  DEFINITELY ADD MANDARIN ORANGES!  The chicken tastes better when you marinade it in the dressing overnight.  Go ahead and boil the chicken in the dressing when you cook it too.  A+ recipe!!

Loved this! Definitely add the sesame oil. I used the store bought rice noodles - they added a nice crunch. I also added the mandrain oranges. I used romaine lettuce because I like it better. I'd like to try it with a fresh spring mix as well. I also added a little more brown sugar to the dressing, but it may not have been necessary.

This made a great salad!  I don't care for rice noodles, so just cooked a side of white rice instead and added some fresh grated ginger - it was great!  Toasted sesame seeds really add to the wonderful flavor of this salad.

Wonderful!  Changes I made was to triple the sauce, one part to marinate the chicken & two parts for the dressing, used store bought noodles, & I added mandarin oranges, carrots & celery.  Very easy & tasty!

Great. Really easy. I agree with another user- definitely use the sesame oil. The flavor is fantastic. I also added some sliced almonds and chow mein noodles for a little crunch instead of the rice noodles. Oh, I also served it on top of some rotini. Th only thing I didn't have that would have made it extra super fantastic was little slices of oranges or tangerines. YUM!!

This just didnt appeal to us.   I love this type of salad in restaurants and was excited to make it.  The best part were the rice noodles, it was fun for my kids to watch them curl while cooking.  You should add mandarin oranges to the salad for sure.  I will keep looking...

This salad was super good!  I combined the ideas of other reviews and did the following:
- Marinated chicken in teriyaki (and baked in 375 oven for 20-25 minutes)
- Added 1 can mandarin oranges and some chopped red bell pepper
- Omitted rice noodles and just sprinkled crunchy chow mein noodles on the top
- Sprinkled sliced almonds on the top

This was delicious!  I used bagged spring mix, instead of the iceberg lettuce.  Also, I added mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles, based on other reviews.  With a rotisserie chicken, this meal couldn't be easier and more tasty!

OH MY GOODNESS!! This is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made. I love chinese chicken salads, and this is just excellent. I made a couple of changes, I added 1 tsp. of ground ginger to the dressing, I think this adds a special sweetness. Also, I broiled my chicken for about 6 minutes after I let it sit in a yoshida's and hoisen sauce marinade for about 15 minutes. I also just used a bag of mixed cabbage that you use for cole slaw. It was delicious and oh-so healthy!! Thanks for the recipe!!*******UPDATE********I double the recipe to have some leftover and sub Peanut Oil for the sesame if I don't have it and just add it in the cup and use Olive oil to fill up to the 1/4 cup or 1/2 cup if doubling. ALSO what makes this recipe just like Nordstroms Cafe Chinese chicken salad is adding 2 Tablespoons of Tahini!!!!! DO IT!!! I also just bake the chicken plain, with foil on top to make it moist like Nordstroms :)

Very Very Good. I didn't have mandarin oranges, but I had a bottle of IRON CHEF ORANGE SAUCE GLAZE, so I added that to the dressing. I loved it. I also saw that someone added a little dijon mustard to the dressing also. I did that and added a little more rice vinegar. It was perfect for me. I also used the oriental ramen noodles. I laid them on a cookie sheet and sprayed it with pam and baked at 350 for about 10 min. I broke them in small pieces before baking.                     Easier yet, I had a bag of frozen Teriyaki Chicken Breast from Sams club. Didnt have to marinade anything.

This salad is really good--wonderful!  I substituted balsamic vinegar for rice vinegar, pre-cooked rice noodles and a bag of baby greens for the lettuce.  I think it's the dressing that gives it such great flavor.  Very easy to make.

I agree -- it's fabulous! For a little different taste, a few alterations make it really close to Panera's Asian chicken salad: eliminate the soy sauce, use white sugar instead of brown, and add fresh cilantro to the salad. Also, I use a 3-oz. pkg of ramen noodles and nix the fried-noodle routine. Much faster & easier!

This is a great recipe, that i have made 3 times in the past week!! i actually marinated the chicken in the dressing, and just made alot of extra to use for dressing. I also cut the chicken into bite size peices instead of shredding it. I poured the chicken and the marinade into a skillet after marinading it for 30 mins and cooking it uncovered over medium heat for about 25 mins or until the oil is extracted from the marinade and the chicken is a dark brown color (it looks like chicken from a chinese restaurant!). I left out the rice noodles and it still tasted great!

I love this salad, the dressing is delicious.  To simplify, I used crunchy chicken strips from the deli, and canned chow mein noodles, and it was yummy.  For pot luck, take the dressing in a separate container and add it just before serving.

The dressing for this salad is wonderful but may be too sweet for some. I doubled the dressing and substituted shredded cabbage for the lettuce. I also added a pkg of ramen noodes (uncooked) instead of the rice noodles to the mix. Then poured the dressing over all and refrigerated for several hours.

EXCELLENT!   Very easy and yummy!  The dressing is wonderful and a just a bit of sweetness.  A perfect "light" dinner.  I have also tossed in a few toasted almonds instead of sesame seeds, and added a can of drained manderine oranges.

This chicken salad has a wonderful flavor, is easy to make, and will have your guests asking for more. I substituted ramen noodles (raw- and straight out of the package) for the Chinese noodles.  Fried wonton pieces can also serve as a suitable substitute. As a previous reviewer suggested, I substituted iceberg lettuce for red leaf romaine lettuce.  If using boiled chicken, lightly season shredded chicken with garlic powder, mix, then add to salad.  This will really enhance salad flavor.

The dressing is delicious and so easy to make. The sesame oil really enhances the flavor. Since I added the full amount of sesame oil, I cut back on the vegetable oil by the same amount. This salad is very aromatic, with a nice balance of sweet and tangy flavors. For even more crunch and sweetness, I added sugar coated almonds.

The dressing was wonderful but the overall salad was needing something, maybe different kind of lettuce.

The dressing is delicious!!  I cut wonton wrappers into strips and baked them until crispy to use instead of the noodles and also added some sliced almonds.

To fry the rice noodles, use enough oil (grapeseed or peanut which have high smoke points) to COVER the noodles.  Get the oil nice and hot.  Put one noodle in.  If its puffs and curls within a second or two the oil is ready.  Then fry the noodles in small batches, moving them around a bit until they are curled, puffy and lightly browned.  Get oil back to temp before adding more batches.  Place fried noodles on paper towel to drain.  Sprinkle with salt if desired. If you do it this way, frying the noodles is not difficult.  In fact its a bit fun.

Like any salad, put in what you like or have handy but don't mess with the dressing much.  I have made this twice now.  Once with 2 tbl of brown sugar and once with 1 tbl of brown sugar & 1 tbl of honey.  When I made the honey version I used some of it as a dipping sauce for our fried chicken.  WOW

This was an excellent salad. I marinated then cooked chicken tenderloins in a sesame sauce from the international section at the store. I also fried won ton skins instead of the noodles mainly because of the carb compairson. I am planning on using the dressing on other garden salads. Thanks for a great recipe!

Dressing is perfect. I used premade wonton strips from salad aisle and no green onions. Also- used butter lettuce and added oranges. From all the previous reviews seems like you can pretty much add anything as long as the dressing is the same and you won't be disappointed!

I made the dressing and then did my own thing with the salad. The dressing is wonderful! I make a VERY large batch of the dressing and then a salad (chopped broccoli incl grated stems, bok choy, Chinese cabbage, grated carrots, chopped green onion, cilantro, and whatever else I have on hand). I keep a bunch of the dressing, made, in the cupboard. So far I've kept it up to two weeks without spoilage. Most of it is oil, vinegar, and sugar. All room temp stable stuff. I love this recipe! I also used dried herbs, incl ginger, rather than fresh so that it would keep in the cupboard. :0)

Tasty and easy!  
I took some of the advice from previous posts:  
Doubled the dressing
Used 1/2 the amount of oil (could have probably decreased it further??)
Added: shredded carrots, mandarin oranges
Marinated rotisserie chicken in dressing (great idea!)
Used Romaine lettuce

I have been searching for a great Asian sesame chicken salad recipe and this is it. Has exactly the flavor profiles I am looking for. Things I did differently: I added mandarin oranges, avocado slices, and slivered almonds. I bought wonton strip topping instead of making the rice noodles, and omitted green onion and sesame seeds. For my chicken breast, I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pan fried it in avocado oil and butter, covered for 25 min. I also halved the oil in the dressing.

Made this today as part of our Chinese New Year dinner.  The sauce was excellent. I did make additions to the salad part:  Used baby spinach and romaine lettuce, added some shredded carrot and diced water chestnuts; skipped the sesame seeds.  I have used rice noodles many times, so did not have a problem as some others did.  Thank you for posting a wonderful addition to our meal, Jill Lopez.  Will be making this again.

The dressing is absolutely amazing. I sweetened a little more than it called for, but I've eaten it for three meals since making. I did use seasoned rice vinegar and mostly low sodium soy sauce. I also put almonds, cabbage, shredded carrots, romaine lettuce, sesame seeds and La Choy noodles. Didn't use the chicken from the recipe so cannot rate this.

The dressing is delicious; my 10yr old didn't care for it, but my picky 12yr old loves it. I think it would make an excellent marinade, as well. I did add about a teaspoon of ground ginger to the dressing, and I hadn't realized that I was out of rice vinegar, so I used plain white. It was still great. My husband says it tastes just like a dressing from Wendys. As other reviewers, I added shredded carrot, thinly sliced white onions, and some leftover snow peas I had. I topped the salad with uncooked crushed ramen noodles. This was a very quick, easy dinner that is perfectly suited to using up leftover chicken, seafood, and veggies. I will definitely be making this again.

Cut the veg. oil in half. Used white sugar instead of brown and used 1 T. of sugar instead of 2. I've noticed some sesame oils are 100 percent and some are a blend of sesame and vegetable oil. Tasted totally different when I used full strength sesame oil.

Delicious.  Used chicken breasts seasoned with pampered chef Asian Seasoning then grilled and shredded. Added mandarin oranges, shredded carrot, diced celery, and water chesnuts, and subbed the chow mein fred noodles in a can rather than fry my own (tasty and easier!) Served over fresh baby spinach. I think the sesame oil in the dressing is a must - added great flavor. Excellent versitile recipe!

Great salad!  I've been looking for a Chinese Chicken Salad with a tasty dressing and this is it!  Instead of the iceberg lettuce I used a head of Napa cabbage.  Also, I didn't want to fry anything so I used half a package of crispy chow mein noodles.  Loved it!

This was a great salad! Suggestions from other reviewers: 1. Baked Wonton Wrappers cut into strips, 2. Sesame oil is a must, 3. Added Hoisin Sauce to taste in the dressing. Will make again!

This is the best "Asian" salad dressing recipe I've tried. I double it without doubling the vegetable oil. I use toasted sesame oil because I love the intense flavor. I use roasted garlic rice vinegar. I add a tsp each of black and white sesame seeds for visual interest. I've also made it following recipe directions exactly and enjoy it thoroughly.

We loved this salad.  I made it on a hot summer day and it could not have been better.  I halved the recipe for the salad and added a couple of cups of broccoli slaw mix and some toasted slivered almonds.  I used the canned rice sticks and a few oven toasted won ton wrappers that I happened to have on hand and all of the dressing recipe.  It's a light tasting dressing and it needed the extra dressing.

Amazing. I add two cans of mandarin oranges because I love them and it adds great flavor! I made this for my husband and I, so we had a lot of leftovers. Next time we will add the rice noodles just to our individual bowls so that they are not mushy the next day for lunch. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  The dressing is great; I took the advice of other reviewers and lessened the amount of veg oil - only used 2 TBSP not 1/2 cup.  Sesame oil is essential to this.  Also grated a little fresh ginger into the dressing.  Did not add chicken but instead added chopped red cabbage, shredded carrots, almonds, mandarin oranges, and used a leafy green lettuce, not iceberg.  Also used can of rice noodles.  Salad dressing really made this awesome.

I've made this many times and love it! However, I substitue Olive Oil for Vegetable Oil.

Like everyone suggested, I drastically reduced the vegetable oil.  The recipe was a phenomenal hit. I added oranges, almonds and grated carrots. Will definitely make it again. This is my first review as I wanted to strongly support this recipe! Meena

I loved this recipe. The Salad was perfect, not too fussy. The dressing was very tasty, probably the ingredient I would not use again would be the rice noodles.  They are messy and create a funny smell in the kitchen when frying. I would go with the bagged Chow Mein Noodles int he Chinese Food Section of my grocery store. Ready in a snap, with lots of crunch.

This salad dressing is excellent.  I didn't make the salad, so this review pertains to the dressing only.  I used half the oil as suggested by other reviewers and I used slightly less sugar, as I'm just not a fan of really sweet salad dressings.  And it was soooo good!  I'm really pleased with this one.  It was super easy and so flavorful.  I thought there wouldn't be enough soy sauce (I use lite soy), but it was perfect.  One of the best I've ever made.

Excellent dressing but use a little less oil. I use a rotisserie chicken to save time. I also add peapods/red bell pepper/mandarin oranges/toasted almonds. Yummy. Tastes like Wendy's asian dressing which is phenomenal. The noodles taste great prepared as stated but the oil splatters everywhere and it is pretty much a hassle. If you don't mind that..go for it !

I made this yesterday for a cook out. I followed the dressing recipe but doubled it and only added 1/3 cup of oil and added ginger. Poured over coleslaw mix , chopped green onion, ramen noodles (out of bag and broken) toasted slivered almonds and sesame seeds. The whole bowl was gone before other salads were. This is a keeper. I love the dressing!

I love the dressing.  Yum! The salad gets a few variations depending on what I have on hand; mandarin oranges, waterchestnuts, chinese noodles, etc.  Great meal for summer nights.

Fantastic salad! The only change I made was baking chicken tenderloins (rather than breasts) in the oven, seasoned with sesame oil, a little Asian seasoning, and soy sauce.  The seasoned chicken added extra flavor.  My family loved this salad - I'll make it often!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  The dressing was fabulous.  I cooked the chicken in the broiler basting them frequently with the dressing.  It had such great flavor.  We have six children from 17 to 3 and they all loved it -- and it is good for them!  There were second helpings for all.  Thank you!

This is such a good easy salad recipe!  I served it with the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken and we ate it all!  I left off the dried rice noodles and didn't have the green onions, but it was awesome!  This is worth trying!

Yay! It was really good.. Some people said the dressing was sweeter than what they wouldve liked, so i used a tablespoon of soysauce instead of 2t. Also, i didnt need nearly that much chicken for the salad.. I used probably.. 2 breasts, and it was more than enough. Maybe thats just me though, because i dont like too much meat in a salad. I only needed 2 green onions. It was great though, ill definately make again.

This was easy, but I didn't really like all the iceberg lettuce.  A whole head makes a lot of salad, too, and needed to have double the dressing that the recipe called for.  I used a can of chow mein noodles instead of messing with the dried rice noodles.  I also added 2 small cans of mandarin oranges.

althought the first time i made it, the rice noodles were very messy and everywhere - i guess it might be because i've never made them before. but, it was still very good! the next times, we just used chow mein noodles that came out of a can and it was even better! im only fifteen, and using the different noodles it was very simple to make. one of our familys favorites now =]

I loved this recipe! Served it to two ladies groups and got rave reviews. I used toasted slivered almonds. I also added dried Ramen noodles instead of the dried Rice noodles. Also prepare the dressing the night before and refrigerate it. It made a difference in the flavor. . fantastic.  My family and friends cannot get enough of this fantastic salad. Thank you!

My husband and I loved this salad.  I did not have left-over chicken, so I doubled the dressing and used that to marinate chicken tenderloins, about 30 minutes or so, and then quickly stir-fried them in a bit of canola oil.  Like another reviewer, I also added shredded carrots and chopped red pepper to the salad mix.  I also used Romaine lettuce and Napa cabbage in place of iceberg lettuce.  Although we really enjoyed the crispness of the rice noodles, I hate to admit that they were too much trouble for me -- I found preparing them to be a bit messy.  So next time I will use some other type of noodle, unless I can find rice noodles which are already prepared.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jill.

Very nice. I thought the dressing was going to be too tangy but once it was on the leaves it was fine. I added some avocado, yellow pepper & cherry tomatoes to make it more of a meal. Also used a packet of ready to eat fried chinese noodels rather than cooking my own. I will use this again for whenever we are after a light but tasty meal.

Great recipe!  We add mandarin oranges, water chestnuts and use chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles. My kids LOVE the dressing!

A very good recipe.  Too much oil though, next time I make it im going to cut the cooking oil by about 1/2 or so and keep the same amount of sesame oil.  

I did triple the dressing amount and I marinated the chicken overnight in the firdge.  I cooked the chicken in the broiler in about 1/8 or 1/4 inch of the marinade for about 15 minutes, flipping in between.  It shredded well.  I also used the la choy crunchy noodles in the container and some dole sliced mandarins.  My wife thought it was good.   I loved it.

Thanks Jill for the recipe! I Love this dressing! Used 1/2 tea.ginger,think I'll try honey next time. I used the dressing on a regular green salad it was really good ! Think I'll try some red cabbage and substitute the sugar for honey.

This recipe was great!  I doubled the recipe.  I added some mandarin oranges and some chicken tenders.  I would recommend decreasing the amount of vegetable oil.  Overall the recipe was excellent!

The chinese restraunts where I now live do not have chinese chicken salad on their menu and I had been craving it for awhile.  Now, I don't have the cravings because this recipe satisfies it.  The dressing tastes exactly like the restraunts.

Yummy dressing!  I also used the dressing to marinade the chicken and bake them.  I reduced the sugar and left out the green onions and sesame seed and instead added cilantro.

This was an incredible salad! I left out the green onions (personal preference) and substituted mandarin oranges, and it turned out very nice. Also, I didn't fry the noodles, I got noodles that were already done in the oriental section at the grocery store. This was a great salad and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This would be a good recipe if the dressing weren't so sweet.  I think a little ginger, garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes might help to balance out the flavors.

This is a great recipe, although I tweaked it a bit like a lot of other reviewers.  I used the LaChoy chow mein noodles instead of the rice noodles and added toasted slivered almonds.  I also used broccoli slaw instead of the iceburg lettuce.  The dressing is fabulous , and I will use it on other dishes as well.  I doubled the amount and made it the night before.  This was a great hit at a potluck I recently attended and everyone wanted the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used coleslaw type cabbage as well as romaine lettuce for the salad.  I used a precooked rotesserie chicken for the meat.  I also served it with chilled canned mandarin oranges which was terrific!  I tried and liked the fried rice sticks, they added a fancy touch but took awhile to fry.  Next time, I might try fried won ton chips or noodles, which would make it even easier to prepare.  After preparing the greens, I served everything separately (including dressing and extra sesame seeds) so that everyone could put as much or as little of everything they wanted.  Would make a great potluck dish as well.  Thanks so much!!

This recipe was bland despite using more sesame oil and less veg oil, mandarin oranges, 2x as many green onions as called for and using a spicy rub on the chicken prior to grilling. Additonally, I added grape tom's and cucumber. I will try this again, but next time will add some grated, fresh ginger and minced garlic.

This has become one of my family's favorite meals, although I changed it a bit.  I kept the dressing the same (doubled it, though), but tossed together the chicken, small head of romaine lettuce, a bag of broccoli coleslaw, and a large can of mandarin oranges, drained.  We added the dressing to individual plates so the leftover salad stays good.  Then we added chow mein noodles and served with warm crusty rolls.  We might even try it with shrimp next time!  Awesome recipe!!!

I enjoyed this recipe, but struggled a bit with the noodles.  I found I needed much more oil in which to fry them, and crushing them made them easier to cook completely.

This was ok. The flavor of the dressing was good but it was very runny, it didn't stay on the lettuce. I probably would not make it again.

This is really good. I used turkey instead of chicken and plain boiled udon noodles (like fettucine) instead of the fried noodles, and whoever said the dressing needs to be doubled was right. I didn't have any rice vinegar so I used cider vinegar. My boyfriend isn't big on salads, he always asks where the meat is, but he really liked this too. I will make it again

Great recipe, I can see it making an awesome main dish for a picnic type meal!

If you need presentation (for example a formal dinner, potluck, etc) serve the dressing separately and don't use toasted sesame seeds... to the untrained eye they can look a little too much like beetles!

A delicious, light dish -- makes a great dinner in hot weather.  I added mandarin oranges and water chestnuts, and used a can of prepared rice noodles as I wasn't sure exactly which ones to buy.

Great recipe, all the adults loved it!! Kids missed their own dressing (ranch) so nest time I'll save some plain for them. I added sliced almond slivers and mandarin oranges. I will not do the rice noodles next time, not worth the effort. I'll use chow-mein noodles

This dish was ok. I would make again, but it was not nearly as flavorful as the reviewers said.I guess I'm just used to more flavor in my dishes. I had to add salt and more dessing and I added fresh basil which really worked wee and also added a dash of chili pepper flakes. Frying the noodles striaght w/ put soaking them in water first is not a good idea for they are still way too hard so I soaked them in water for 10 minutes first which made them much more edible.

Napa Cabbage with Romaine Lettuce worked wonders.  Add some fresh cilantro for a refreshing taste.

An excellent dressing-- I added a full Tbsp. of soy sauce, though. The sesame oil is adds a great Asian flavor-- don't omit it :)

After reading all the reviews about the dressing, I made it (just the dressing).
It was good, but I found it a little too sweet. I would make it again and just cut
out some of the sugar.

I made this because I had one leftover grilled chicken breast and 1 leftover grilled tuna steak. My husband hates fish, so it was excellent with both. It was interesting experimenting with frying rice noodles. Kinda messy but fun.

We love this!  I typically don't put in as much brown sugar or sesame oil as called for(the oil is so over-powering)and sometimes I'll add a pinch of ginger.  Excellent!

5 stars for the dressing!  Make sure to use the sesame oil, it really helps to make the dressing just perfect. YI used the Grilled Chinese Chicken salad recipe on this site to grill the chicken. Much more flavorful than plain chicken. But that's just my preference, and no extra trouble to enhance the flavor of the chicken to go with this salad.  Added mandarin oranges, toasted sesame seeds, and sliced almonds. All together it was a wonderful salad for a too hot to cook evening!

I too used Napa Cabbage. I also used shredded carrots and a small bag of Brocolli Slaw mix from the grocery.  I shredded a whole head of cabbage, a whole head of iceberg, added 2 large shredded carrots, and the whole bag of brocolli slaw.  I put all of this in a huge Tupperware bowl and tossed it.  That way it's ready to grab and put in a bowl for dinner or to take in a smaller covered bowl for lunches.  Do not add the dressing til you are ready to eat it! We had it last night, with leftover chicken on top...I used sliced almonds rather than the sesame seeds and as I thought it needed a hint of sweet I tossed some dried cranberries on mine.  Hubby has his without. Did not use the rice noodles.  I packed up some of the salad mix today for lunch and am putting some sliced roast beef on top. Last night was the first time in 8 years of marriage that hubby complimented me on a main dish salad.  LOVE not having to cook (we live in AZ) having it again for dinner tonite.

This is an excellent recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed the lightness of the meal since it is so hot. I followed the instructions and all I have to say is we needed to make more of the dressing since we had multiple servings. I added mandarins to my salads and loved how it added more color and flavor to the meal. 

Other modifications we made was to use a spring mix, rather than the iceberg and it gave it more color, texture, and a slightly different flavor than what iceberg would have done. We also just used pre-made Chinese noodles and that cut the prep time down considerably.

I made various changes and we both loved this Asian inspired salad.  I used 2 sliced chix breasts and marinated them in 2-3 tblsps soy, 2 tblsp honey, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tblsp crushed ginger, 2 cloves minced garlic & 1/4 C OJ for about 4 hours.  I prepared chopped iceburg in each bowl, shredded carrots, scallions, chopped water chestnuts, chopped fresh mint and basil and topped with the sautéed marinated chicken.  Next time I will add something crisp/starchy and probably some toasted slivered almonds or crisy noodles.  Only used 2 tblsp veggie oil for the dressing and this was excellent...didn't need more oil.  Would also be good with some shredded red cabbage and peas.

This was great!  I made the full amount of dressing and used part of it to marinate some chicken, which we later grilled.  I jazzed up the salad by using red leaf lettuce, and adding sliced red bell pepper, blanched sugar snap peas, and fresh pineapple.  Instead of dried rice noodles I used some wonton strips I had on hand.  We’ll be making this a lot this summer.

My review is for the dressing.. it is AMAZING! White sugar, brown sugar.. go with your taste, but whichever you prefer.. it is SOOO good. I took your advice and tripled the batch, using one to marinate my chicken and the other two to keep on hand as a dressing. My family ate EVERY bite and were looking for more. To those who had something critical to say... cannot figure out why. This was so good and not at all too oily! Do not change her recipe.. its delicious!!

So i substituted ramen for the rice noodles, added diced water chestnuts, used spinach, and mixed the sesame seeds in with the dressing. It was awesome and extremely colorful and vibrant. Loved it, saving the recipe.

I used this recipe for the dressing, but made changes to the remaining ingredients.  I made the dressing as directed (with the sesame oil).  I cooked my chicken sprinkled with salt and pepper on the George Foreman grill and then cut into small chunks.  I mixed the chicken with some of the dressing and let it sit a bit.  Then put the chicken on top of mixed greens with crispy chow mein noodles and sliced almonds.

Oh, wow.  This was fantastic...Like some others I used chow mein noodles (my grocery store was out of the rice noodles) but the dressing is the dealbreaker in this recipe.  So simple and so very delicious.  I would say the sesame oil is NOT optional but that's just me.  Used a store-bought rotisserie chicken making this a 10 min meal.  It doesn't get any better that that!

I use this dressing with bagged, shredded coleslaw cabbage, drained mandarin oranges, almonds and crushed, dry ramen noodles.  Yum!

WOW! This dressing recipe is wonderful.  I will never buy a sesame dressing again.  I quadrupled the recipe hoping for good results and was very happy I did.  Fantastic. Thank you.

Awesome!  We loved this salad!  I had issues with frying the noodles, I wish I had read the comments beforehand.  It took about 3 attempts to get it right, and didn't match the posted instructions.  Aside from that though, it's a great recipe.

Very good salad. I agree with other reviewers that you must use the sesame oil, but I think you could use less, as it is a very strong taste. Also, I ould just buy the La Choy noodles as opposed to making the rice noodles, to much work! Over all very good though.

This is awesome! I even had my neighbor's children over, who have lots of likes and dislikes but it was a hit for both adults and 6 children. Try to top that! I didn't have rice vinegar on hand so I just used regular vinegar, a ratio of 2/3 vinegar with 1/2 water to make it milder flavor. Also used romaine, red cabbage, celery, carrots, bell pepper, the chow mein noodles and sliced almonds. Grilled some bonelss chicken thighs with ginger and garlic, then cut up the chicken and threw it all together. My daughter added the touch of eating it all with chop sticks. Couldn't have asked for a better Asian Salad.

This was pretty good although I doubled the dressing and tripled the green onions.  I also added mandarin oranges and toasted slivered almonds.  I told my very picky BF to "free his mind" and try a bite and he ended up having three big bowlfuls!  Interestingly enough, we both liked this better without the chicken which is how I will make it from now on.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe. The dressing is delicious. I have made it 5-6 times in  the last month. I use marinated, grilled chicken tenders, sliced almonds and clementines. Try it!

This recipe has made it to my top 20 list!  OMG! Soooo Good the whole family was licking their plates to get up all of the dressing.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used romaine and spinach and added an array of different veggies (carrot, cucumber, mandarin oranges, mushrooms & cilantro (cilantro added a really nice touch)).  I also wasn't going to fry my own noodles (don't have the time or patience ^^) so I went to buy some and for some reason I picked up French's French Fried Onions by accident but you know what?  It was still tasty!  Thank you ever so much for this fabulous recipe Jill, my 5 year old isn't asking for ranch anymore, he wants your dressing!

This was very good.  I used crispy wontons instead of frying my own noodles and I left out the chicken since I was using this as a side dish with my roast pork.  The dressing is delicious.  I will be making again.

Great recipe- a regular in our household. Have made as is but prefer the following changes: double dressing and add 1/2 tsp ground ginger, use La Choy chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles, marinate the chicken in some of the dressing before we grill it and shred.

I thought this salad was restaurant quality! I followed the recipe for the dressing but used extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. I think the "optional" sesame oil is a must! I used honey roasted almonds instead of the rice noodles. I marinated and grilled the chicken in Asian Toasted Sesame dressing (by Kraft). I also drizzled some of this dressing on the grilled chicken once it was on the salad. I added crushed honey roasted peanuts to the salad. I used spring mix salad instead of iceberg. Next time I make it, I will probably add shredded cabbage to the spring mix. Yummy Yummy salad!!! So satisfying!

The dressing is AMAZING!!!  I always make more because everyone loves it.  Like others, I've also used Chow Mein noodles instead of frying up my own noodles.  Works great.  A wonderful quick salad.  I take it to work for lunch often.

This salad was ok but nothing spectacular.  The smell of the oil and rice noodles actually made me feel ill.  I don't really think they are necessary in the salad since they are flavorless anyways.  They were hard to fry evenly and I ended up having to put only ten in a pan at one time to ensure that they got done.  I thought the ratio of chicken to lettuce was off and would've liked less chicken.  If I made this salad again, I would substitute the noodles for something else crispy (chow mein noodles or almonds) and decrease the amount of chicken.

We loved the dressing.  But could do without the rice noodles.  They were messy to cook and didn't add anything to the recipe except calories.  I'll use the dressing part of this receipe next time but skip the glass noodles and replace them with the Chinese noodles in a can.  That will add crunch and no frying.

This is a great recipe Jill.  I made a Vegetarian Alternative version Used raw sugar instead of brown sugar - may be more difficult to dissolve but I let it sit and had no problems. Used lower sodium soy sauce. I also used 3/4 tbspn sesame oil and 1/4 tbspn spicy sesame oil.  Dressing has a very nice nutty flavor with the sesame oil.   Napa cabbage - really grabs the dressing and is nutrient rich - curled carrots - celery - cucumber - radishes - green onion - raw almond slivers (too lazy for noodles)- Fresh ground black pepper. I didn't even miss the meat with enough almond slivers.  The almond slivers taste FANTASTIC with this dressing!!  Excellent idea, I will definitely make this again.  Since I used all hard vegetables, it should last a few days in the fridge;)  Thank YOU!

This recipe was wonderful. I incorporated several of the other comments by frying up some won ton noodles in place of the rice noodles. Also added fresh mushrooms, red pepper and mandarine oranges. I doubled the dressing but only added 1 Tablespoon of the sesame seed oil as it's a strong flavor.  My family loved it.

Very good dressing, please do use the sesame oil.  I sliced boneless breasts into strips and sauted them in sesame oil and olive oil...they were quite tasty.  I also used mixed greens, added julienned carrots, and used chow mein noodles since that's what I had.  Very good salad!

Very, very good.  I'll probably cut the sesame oil in 1/2 next time, it ws just a bit overpowering.  I shredded the meat from a rotisserie chicken from the store, which made it quick and easy!

I have never given a negative review on this website before.  The dressing was so oily! I even doubled the other ingredients but it still tasted like sour oil on my lettuce.  Sorry didn't like it at all.

Very good, I added cilantro, almonds, and mandarine oranges which was really good.  I decreased the amount of oil and added crunchy chow mein noodles too. This would be good with cabbage also.

Excellent dressing!  The taste is like the dressing you get from Wendys maybe a little sweeter but very good!  I followed dressing recipe as is.  For the salad I used a bag of mixed greens and used the cooked chicken from Tyson in the refrigerated section and mandarin oranges.  A little more expensive but worth the time it saves for me. Will make again and again.

Delicious.  We like fried wonton strips in place of the rice noodles, and I like to use Romaine and add sugar snap peas or pea pods.  This salad has become one of my summertime favorites.

Very very good. It tastes even better than Wendy's Asian chicken salad. I tweaked the dressing by adding 1/4 tsp fish sauce and 1 tsp ginger powder. Grated ginger would have been better but didn't have it on hand. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

*Very* yummy recipe, and one that will go into my permanent recipe file!  I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg; and the only changes I would make for next time would be to add mandarin oranges and perhaps use chow mein noodles to save time.

I have made this dozens of times.  The only thing I change is using only a handful of the noodles.  On hot summer nights, I use a deli chicken and as always, this salad is incredible.

This is such a great base recipe.  I love the dressing and usually I put cucumbers, mandarin oranges, almonds, and ramen noddles instead of the rice noodles because it's quicker. 

Thanks for such a great recipe!

The dressing was very good and very easy to make.  My version of the salad was disappointing because - duh - I forgot to buy noodles (and was too lazy to go back to the store).  I will make this again.  We like Asian-style salads and this is very good; lots of possibilities for variations.

I didn't have dried rice noodles in the pantry so I excluded it, added mandarin oranges and used romaine instead. IT WAS FANTASTIC! I steamed plain chicken and shreded it. The dressing was enough to season the chicken when the pieces are thin enough. Great way to eat salad!

Pretty good.  I kind of prefer the fruity/cheesy/nutty salads on this site, but with a little mandarin orange, this tasted pretty yummy.

I substituted bagged salad for the iceberg lettuce, but otherwise made no substitutions and included the sesame oil option.  My family loved it!  My 2-year-old loved the fried rice sticks (I wouldn't make a substitution here...it takes 5 seconds to cook after the oil heats and is nothing like a chow-mein noodle).

This is a delicious salad, the dressing is incredible.  Make sure to add the sesame oil-it adds so much flavor.  I also added a little over a tablespoon of orange juice to the dressing to add a little more zip.  I can imagine eating this all summer, it was so, so good!

I loved this salad, the dressing is a little sweet(but I liked it that way).  I used the pre cooked chicked pieces from the deli.  Which saved a lot of time.  Thanks for a great summer recipe

Excellent salad.  I really liked the dressing.  Just what I was looking for, and very easy.  I like spring mix or leaf lettuce better than iceburg, but that is just personal preference.  I did not use the rice noodles, mainly because I made this spur of the moment and did not have them.  But next time I will try them.

This was a really good salad, but the dressing came out a little too sweet. I would probably decrease the brown sugar a little bit. In addition, I used leftover teriyaki chicken, which I think gave it more of an asian salad taste than regular grilled chicken would have. But, my husband is a salad lover, and he enjoyed this one.

Very good, I will make this again. It was a perfect side dish to the Awesome Korean Steak recipe. The only change I made, was I added boiled rice noodles as well as fried ones.

I loved the salad dressing.  The salad itself seemed to need a few more ingredients. Over all I liked it.

This was a nice variation of the classic chinese chicken salad made with cabbage. I used chow mein noodles one time, and ramen noodles the next. My kids really liked it, and I am making it for the 3rd time.

If done per recipe, this would be a 2/3, but with changes we gave it a 4. This is not a "quick" recipe, as given, because you do this in over time. If you don't have leftover chicken it is more time consuming. Using suggestions, we added the mandarin oranges, almonds & chow mein noodles. Next time I won't bother with the rice noddles.  This is a good & summer salad.

This is very good! I used left over fried chicken breasts to make it just a little more delicious. My fiance wasn't sure he was going to like it, he wanted to go to a chinese buffet instead. I told him that I would make it and if he didn't like it he didn't have to eat it and we could go out. Well he loved it. He said it was much better than if we had went out, and he was happy about it being inexpensive. He even liked the dressing and usually he wont eat any dressing on his salads. It's one of our favorite salads now.

I accidentally cooked the noodles in water instead of frying them and it turned out very good. The dressing is fabulous! My only regret is the lack of colours... Next time, I'll add bell pepper or grated carrots.

The dressing makes the salad sensational! I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I substituted 1 tbsp sake (rice wine) and 2 tbsp white vinegar with fresh cracked black pepper.. Tasted fabulous! Omitted the sesame seeds, and used slivered almonds. Instead of iceberg, I prefer the softer baby greens. I will continue to do the same. I used pre-packaged fried noodles, and deli-style rotisserie chicken breast, shredded, for a quicker meal. We loved it! I will definitely be using this recipe over and over again! Thanks!!

This salad was delicious!  My husband, who normally doesn't like Asian food, thought this was sweet :)  We loved the tangy and crunchy flavors, and ate it with crusty french bread.  We grilled the chicken on our Foreman grill, diced it, and used already coked rice noodles to make this quickly.

Excellent as is, but I love to add some slivered almonds and serve it as a wrap. I used La Choy Chow Mein Noodles, but I once used some of the crunchy fried won ton strips you get with egg drop soup in Chinese take out, and though they were a little too wide to work well in a wrap, they are great if you are serving it as just a salad.

LOVE the dressing.  I use chopped up almonds instead of using the chinese noodles, and sometimes I substitute white onions in the place of the green onions.

This got mixed reviews from the family.  I loved it but my husband and kids thought it was only ok.  The 2 year old wouldn't eat it at all.  I couldn't find cellophane noodles at the store so I used Thai rice noodles.  They were ok but I think I'll try a different type next time.  I also doubled the dressing and let the chicken marinate.

A very nice salad, however I would double the amount of dressing and forget about the rice noodles.  They were a disaster to prepare and the salad would be much better without them.  Somehow frying noodles in oil to add to a great healthy salad just seems wrong.

Absolutely amazing!!  Definitely double the dressing.  I served it over a bed of spinach, baked chicken, toasted slivered almonds, drained canned mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles. It looked as good as it tasted.  I'll be making it a lot.  Thank you!!

OMG! This recipe is devine.  I didn't have rice noodles on hand, so I had to use round rice wraps instead.  I tried to break them up by hand. I had flakes all over my counter.  I decided to use my food process to crush them up.
They came out super minced.  I fried them in my wok and left them in the skillet a little longer than recipe required.  I was concerned that my family would bite into one and cut their mouth.
I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar. I also grilled my chicken and basted with sesame seed oil. I don't use worthless iceburg lettuce.  I used romaine. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is a great salad!  I used fried wonton strips instead of the noodles because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I will cut down to maybe 1/2 T. on the sesame oil, but my husband thought it was great!

I think I bought the wrong kind of noodles, I bought ones that were more like spaghetti but this salad was still incredible! The dressing really makes it. I left the chicken out because I was serving chicken in another dish and no one even missed it. Thanks Jill!

This salad was wonderful! I did not have the rice noodles so I used Top Ramen noodes and boiled them in water to reduce the use of oil. (Boiling for only a short time still allows the noodles to be crunchy) I also doubled the dressing - which was WONDERFUL!

GREAT!  I used Romaine Lettuce and baked the ramen noodles (sprayed with a little Pam).  I also added mandarian oranges & some sliced water chestnuts. Very Good!!

This is one of my favorite recipes now, I made it two nights in one week.  I did have a little trouble preparing the rice noodles, but it turned out great!

I made the recipe almost as written, but next time I’ll add less oil, more soy sauce, and 1 t. of Chinese Five Spice Powder (I did put it 1/2 t.) to the dressing.  I also used little gem lettuce instead of iceberg for better nutritional value.  It took lots more oil to fry the noodles!  This is a terrific full meal salad.

Just made this for dinner. We  all loved it, so cool and refreshing yet filling.  I just love base recipes like this that a person can expand on based on supplies on hand and personal preferance.  Also love all of the ideas that everyone else shares in their reviews.  Made extra dressing with 2 Tablespoons each of sesame oil and veg. oil.  Lots of chopped vegetables; carrot celery cucumber, peas and Mandarin oranges.  Poured some of the dressing over chopped veg, and cut up rotisseri chicken and let it set a bit then mixed with babyspinich and spring greens, oranges and toasted slivered almonds.  I can't believe how fast this disappeared.  It was our dinner.  My daughter said "Mom don't change a thing it doesn't need to be any better, it's Great!"  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I added Chinese Five Spice to the dressing and the seasoning of the Chicken which I pan seared and then baked and cut up into bite size pieces instead of shredding. I replaced the rice noodles with La Choi Chow Mein noodles. I added oranges, red bell pepper, chopped snow peas, and mushrooms to the recipe. Will definitely make again.

I made this for my teenage daughter and she loved it. I baked the chicken and then cut thin slices. I put the chicken slices in a small ziploc a couple of hours before serving immersed in some of the dressing. Instead of preparing Chinese rice noodles, I bought a small can of La Choy Rice Noodles to use. I altered amount and proportion of salad components to create the right amount for one serving using common sense. I plan to make this again and again.

This is a great starter recipe!  The ingredients in the salad can vary as much as you like.  My review is based on the dressing.  Per other reviews I used 1/2 the vegetable  oil and I'm glad I did.  The full amount would have been way too much.   Don't skip the sesame oil, it is an essential flavor element.  Next time I'm going to cut back the oil even further and try 1 Tbsp of sesame oil and 1 Tbsp veg oil.

It was good although I didn't add chicken or rice noodles. Had to substitute apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar. A shredded carrot adds color. Reduced the recipe since I didn't want to store leftovers. Easy to add slivered almonds, chow mein noodles or mandarin oranges if you prefer it sweeter.

Delicious!!!  I'm on the 17 Day Diet so adapted it to meet my needs and it was still amazing!  I subbed in 1 tablespoon Agave for the brown sugar.  I doubled the dressing, as advised by previous reviewers, and marinated the chicken in half of it.  I used the sesame oil (definitely necessary) but subbed 2 tablespoons of olive oil for the vegetable oil.  I left out the rice noodles and used thinly sliced napa cabbage in place of the iceberg.  A keeper recipe, for sure!

Love this recipe - it's a hit every time I make it. I will add a variety of things to it ranging from red bell peppers, cilantro, carrots, cucumber, snow peas, bean sprouts, celery, et cetera. I grab a chicken from Sams Club/Costco and have used a variety of lettuces - spring, herb mix, romaine ....I'm not a fan of ice berg. Awesome recipe!

I made this recipe, sticking fairly close to the recipe. I didn't fry up the rice noodles, nor did I substitute chow mein noodles. I think another time I would use the chow mein noodles. I used a mix of romaine and baby spinach to make it healthier. We really liked the flavors in the dressing, though we found it a bit thin. I'm pondering whether there might be a way to thicken it. Finally, I used Mandarin oranges, as many other reviewers suggested. I didn't care for them - the flavor was fine, but they were mushy and disintegrated. I think another time I might use regular orange sections. I'll probably make this again, with the changes I've noted.

I made the dressing and keep it as a salad dressing and I use it with regular salad. Delicious! For vegetable oil I used organic coconut oil. Since I used the sesame oil (I would not say this is optional....the flavor is a must!) I decreased the 1/4 cup of coconut oil just a tad.

The dressing is fabulous - I'm going to mix some up and keep it on hand for other salads.  Make sure you heat the oil up really hot or the rice sticks don't puff up and get airy.  If they're not puffed up they are just like eating sticks.

I love this salad! Make sure to use the sesame oil. I also add onion and garlic powder and ginger to the dressing. As someone suggested, I dredged the chicken in flour and cornstarch and fried till crispy. So delicious.

I marinated pounded chicken breast in grated ginger, minced garlic clove and sweet soy sauce before I grilled them. Used my assorted lettuce, bok choy, green onions, pepper, avocado, orange wedges. The dressing was great, glad I went with less oil, but next time I'll add another tbs of sugar and cashews. I did use can crunchy rice noodles. We all liked this and will have it again.

This dressing has become a staple for my lunches. I use whatever lettuce I have, skip the toasted sesame seeds, use crispy chow mein noodles rather than rice noodles, use canned chicken, and mandarin oranges.  LOVE this salad over and over and over.

I made dressing exactly as it says. I used already made noodles and toasted slivered almonds. The dressing is so good!! Next time I'll do a mixed lettuce and use half the veg oil.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! I followed the recipe for the most part. However, I just purchased the La Choy fried rice noodles instead of cooking my own for ease. I also added a few things: mandarin oranges, cucumbers, shredded carrots, and added sliced almonds to the sesame seeds when I toasted them. I also added some ginger powder to the dressing and used sesame chili oil instead of sesame oil (I probably won't do that again since it was a tad too spicy). 

Lastly, as I frequently do with weekend salads, I bought a rotisserie chicken and chopped that up and tossed it in the salad instead of cooking my own. Leftover chicken or freshly cooked chicken would have been just as good.

This was a lovely Sunday summer night dinner for the hubby and me. He said it was the best salad I've made yet. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Thank you for this recipe! I doubled the dressing, but will multiply it next time as I'd like to keep this on hand for everyday salads. I didn't have rice vinegar, so substituted balsamic. I also used white sugar and half of the vegetable oil.
Fantastic.

My husband bought rice sticks and when I tried to break them to fry, they would not break and with much difficulty cut with sissors.  I presume these are not the right noodles as in this recipe.  What is the difference between rice sticks and rice noodle. Please reply!

Primarily used the dressing- made a napa cabbage w/peppers, chicken, green onions & peanuts. I liked it but wanted a bit more zing- perhaps some ginger next time.

It was good, but the salad itself was boring.  Could have used some other veggies and maybe mandarin oranges.

This was so tasty! I made the dressing exactly as is, using seasoned sesame oil. For the salad I used butter lettuce, radishes, carrots, mandarin oranges, slivered almonds and sesame seeds. I didn't bother with rice noodles. Too much work. Used chow mien noodles instead and you wouldn't notice the big difference. It was delicious! will make again!

This is a good low calorie meal. I bought already fried rice noodles, which made things a lot easier. The kids weren't a fan of the sauce. They ate around everything, but the chicken. Other than that this was a success!

This was good!  Better then I thought it would be. It kind of tastes like the Chinese Chicken Salad you buy at Costco.  I made it again and the 2nd time I added sliced almonds and crunchy noodles, not cooked ones. Kind of like they have in the Costco salad.

I made a couple slight adjustments to the dressing... I used just a bit more sugar, and I was out of sesame oil and substituted about a teaspoon and a half of tahini that I had on hand. It worked out great. This is a great basic Asian dressing and I'll definitely be using it frequently.

This is one of my all-time fav salad recipes! Super easy to make really tasty. I don't usually add the sesame seeds because I don't always have them in the house. And I always add madarin oranges. It's a great summer salad.

I'm not really a fan of regular head lettuce since it has little nutritional value (don't get tricked people!). I used only a little head lettuce for cruch, added mixed springs, spinach and watercress. Also added cilantro (must have). Awesome dressing, but salad was too simple to be amazing as-is. I give the recipe 3 stars as-is, 4 stars with adjustments.

My husband doesn't often say "save this recipe so you can make it again."  But he said that for this salad!  That says a lot right there.  We really liked the dressing.  I added red peppers, shredded carrots and mandarin oranges to give it some color and add more veggies.  This was great and we'll definitely have it again.

This was light and refreshing. I do think there was too much oil in the dressing and would reduce it next time. I also would recommend adding mandarin oranges, slivered almonds are a good substitute for the fried noodles - healthier and tastier.

We loved this salad so much we had it two days in a row! The 1st time i made the recipe as is, except that I marinated the chicken in terryaki sauce for 2 hours before grilling, we also used La Choy noodles. The 2nd time I put the green onions in with the dressing and let it sit for 30 minutes....we loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

The dressing for this salad is amazing!  The only thing I changed was that I used a variety of lettuces and baby spinach.  I like to have some dark and light leaves.

I use the dressing and add minced fresh ginger. Add more veggies to salad, peppers, mandarin oranges. Like to use agave instead of sugar for dressing, may have to melt over stove just for a minute. Don't use the dried noodles, is fine without. Use different types of cabbage and lettuce.

Loved his recipe.  The dressing is identical to Panera Bread Asian Chicken salad.  If you;re in a big rush- Perdue makes pre-cooked chicken called short-cuts which tast superb in this salad.  Big hist with my family.

We really loved the salad, but made a few adjustments. I used leftover roasted chicken and cubed the white meat, substituted the chinese noodles with slivered almonds, and added tiny cubes of granny smith apples.  Couldn't stop eating it.

I cooked the chicken in some soy sauce and shredded it. That gave it a lot more flavor. I also added mandrin oranges. I think it would have been pretty bland without those additions.

This is a great summer salad recipe.  I change just a few things...I use shredded broccoli instead of lettuce, and I add honey roasted sesame seeds.  I toast ramen noodles with the seeds and mix them in with the salad.  Yum, Yum.  I wish the dressing could be a little thicker...anyone have any suggestions??

Wow! This dressing is great. I agree with other reviewers that the sesame oil is essential, and I cut back to veg oil to 2 tablespoons. Other than that, fabulous.

Very flavourful - added a touch of fish sauce and ginger to the dressing as per others suggestions and added mandarin oranges to the romaine /spinch mix I used.  Very nice!  I cooked the chicken in a wok with some chili oil (1 tbsp) and added some Ancho and Chilpolte chili powder to give it some flavor.

So good!  Instead of decreasing the amount of vegetable oil in the dressing, I doubled everything else except the oil (I put a lot of dressing on my salads).  I also took the advice of others and used pre-made wonton noodles.  Delicious!

This was just the dressing I was looking for! Just enough sweetness to the tangyness.  I followed the recipe to a T, even adding the sesame oil.  I used fried wontons for the topping.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made up the dressing according to the directions and had to throw it out.  It was oily, bland and I couldn't bear to ruin the rest of my perfectly good ingredients by adding it. Good idea though.  I made another recipe's dressing and added it to the salad part here and it was good.

Great dressing!  I followed the instructions of others and added celery, mushrooms, and cilantro.  I also added fresh mandarin orange sections and used baby spring greens.  The first time it did get a bit soggy for leftovers, though, so I used romaine the second time and added chopped red bell pepper and sliced water chestnuts.  I also toasted sesame seeds and added them to the chicken (cut into pieces and cooked in teriyaki sauce), then left the chicken and sesame seeds in the fridge together overnight.  It was difficult to find won ton crisps, so I used sesame chips from an Asian food store the first time.  The second time, I found raw won ton wraps in the produce section of the store and sliced them into 1/8ths, then fried them briefly in a little bit of vegetable oil the day before.  They kept very well in the fridge overnight, and I served the crisps on the side later.

The dressing wasn't quite right. I used seasoned rice vinegar. That may have been my mistake. I also added almonds, mandarin oranges and crunchy noodles to the recipe. I will make this again using regular rice vinegar!

Update / It's the dressing that has become my favorite. I will eat my greens with this one, easy too. outstanding!       I made this last night. I had iceberg which I don't eat much, but it's the only salad green my husband likes. This salad was great! I did not have the noodles, but subbed them for peanuts and I threw in a few mandarin oranges. Will make again.

I am so sorry to give this such a low rating, but it is just OK, rice noodle are too finiky and the fat content in this recipe equal that close to a good ol' fashion burger.  It is just too fattening and the sodium count is incorrect - it is higher than it shows and it is so so and not worth the calories.

This recipe is just what I was looking for, although I wound up making several changes.  First of all, I added crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder, ground ginger, and (accidentally) a fair amount of rice wine to the dressing.  (Grabbed the wrong bottle when I went for the rice vinegar!)  My husband raved about the dressing even with the rice wine in it, although I think I will cut back on the amount of oil next time.  I also used peanut oil instead of sesame oil, and a little Splenda in place of some of the brown sugar.  For the salad itself, I used romaine, canned chicken, sliced red pepper, toasted cashews, sliced carrots, and green onions.  I think you could put pretty much any combination of vegetables, nuts, noodles, etc. in this salad and it would be great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so tasty.  I mixed head lettuce and Romaine.  Adding color through mandarin oranges and red bell peppers makes the salad appear very appetizing.  We also added dressing as we each preferred it.  I will double the dressing next time, which will be soon.  It was delicious!

I will definitely make this again. Like someone else suggested, I added mandarin orange slices and sliced water chestnuts. I  used toasted sesame seed oil and it added a nice smokey/nutty flavor to the dressing. I also used baby spinach instead of regular lettuce b/c it has more nutritional value.

I doubled the dressing and omitted the vegetable oil, and gave each person a dish of it on the side (my kids are into dipping things). Lettuce, cucumber, marinated carrot, red peppers, mandarin oranges and chow mien noodles were topped with sauteed chicken strips . Everybody ate everything.

Delicious.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, and my family loved it.  I also bought chow mein noodles from the grocery store.  The whole meal took 10 minutes to put together and it was delicious and somewhat healthy.

We really loved this recipe. I wanted to to scale back the fat and calories though so I cut both oils in half, upped the soy sauce and vinegar to taste and boiled the noodles according the the package directions instead of frying. Yes they don't have the "crunch" to them but they absorb the dressing and are extremely tasty. I also added some garlic powder and extra green onions and sesame seeds. 
Using the boiled noodles makes this a GREAT make ahead/potluck dish too. Just make sure you rinse them, drain them very well and make sure they are cool before adding the the lettuce mix. (Also I have 3 little boys and I used ranch on theirs instead of the asian dressing and they scarfed it up!)

Great dressing! In lieu of toasted sesame seeds, I subbed with slivered almonds. Also added grated carrots and thin-sliced jicamas.

I made this dish as a side for my family's Easter dinner.  I doubled it, and still didn't have any leftover!  I substituted 1T of olive oil for 1T of sesame oil for a bit richer flavor.

I followed the suggestions by PPK and used chow mein noodles, added mandarin oranges and toasted almonds.  This salad was great and both my husband and I loved it.  Thanks Jill for the recipe and PPK for the suggestions!

I love asian food but my husband doesn't.  He does love salad so I gave this a try.  Glad I did because my husband loved this salad and kept going back for more.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the rice vermacelli (cellaphane) didn't work at all so I had to omit them.  Next time I will just sprinkle the salad with already fried rice noodles like in the picture.  It's a keeper!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I did add toasted cashews and the sesame oil should not be optional, the unique flavor makes the dish!

Very tasty LOVE the dressing, I had never made the noodles before and that was a bit of a disaster, I will use  something else next time. But minus the noodles, I will be making this quite often!

My family loved this recipe. I used the canned rice noodles and spinach greens. Hubby and I thought the optional sesame oil improved the flavor of the dressing. We'll definitely make this dish again!

Wow, this was great! Instead of iceburg I used fresh baby spinach, red and regular romaine.  I doubled the dressing but used the 1/4 cup oil. Next time I will quadriple it. I used the chow mein noodles. I wanted a very easy,healthy quick dinner on busy nights and I found it! Thank you JIll !!!MY husband and All three of the kids liked it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The rice noodles were a mess for me and still tasted like needles. None of us thought this had much flavor.
