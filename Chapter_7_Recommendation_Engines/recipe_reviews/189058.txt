This was a very tasty way to prepare Salmon! I added just a couple things when fixing mine: I used sea salt instead of regular salt, and used a little less than the recipe called for, and also added a chopped up clove of garlic to the butter in the saucepan. I allowed the butter and garlic to simmer a few minutes before added the filets. It was delicious! **I used a lb. of Salmon and had to double the ingredients to have enough for all three filets.

Amazing! I used a frozen salmon fillet that I'd put in the fridge the night before. Absolutely delicious! And my first time making salmon, too! I'm making it a second time this week! (If making any fish from frozen, you must pat it dry with paper towels before you cook! it'll fall apart and be mushy if you don't!)

I'm 80 years old and I live alone. And up here in the Eureka area we have a salmon season when it's possible. I like my food simple and this has to be the most simple salmon recipe ever! I had a pound and a half of salmon steaks vacuum sealed in my freezer I had caught them three years ago. I suppose some would consider this heresy in the way I treated my salmon but today I salmon treated me great thank you so much for the recipe. I've been looking for such a recipe for at least 20 years. I had never used basil before and I don't know whether that was an ingredient that give it that extra flavor or not. But in any case it was a great success. By the way I delighted that pound and a half salmon into three steaks so for a couple of more days I'll be eating like a king.thanks again sincerely, Tom.

I love the simplicity and great taste of this recipe.  I've never cooked salmon before so I wanted to start with something simple.  This makes me want to cook salmon more often now.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this in 10 minutes. With the pan on low heat, the fillet came out moist and delicious. 5 stars for being quick, simple, and tasty!

Far too many salmon recipes on this site contain too many ingredients and are much too complicated to prepare for a casual weekday meal.  This recipe was perfect: simple, easy to prepare, yet with a restaurant quality results.  Absolutely a pleasure to cook and eat!

I make this recipe once a week. I do everything the same except that I sprinkle each piece of salmon individually, and use Pam instead of butter. Comes out delicious every time! I even baked it at 350 for about 18-20 mins based on thickness, in a foil pocket. I've made this for guests, and always had rave reviews. I usually serve this salmon with brown rice or angel hair pasta, and grilled asparagus.

I needed a fast, easy recipe with no added sugar, and since I'd never cooked fresh salmon before, I wanted something simple with few ingredients.  This recipe won on all counts.  I plan to make this recipe again.

Made the salmon exactly as written and it was very good. Served it with fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes which was a good combination. Very easy and fast to fix.

With the wife working 12 hr shifts at the hospital, I've been looking for some easy recipes to have prepared for her when she gets home. I made this for dinner tonight and we both loved it! I didn't even bother bookmarking this page because the recipe is so simple. I added a little lemon pepper to the rub and sauted some fresh garlic in the butter before cooking the salmon. Try it! You'll love it!

This was AWWWWESOME!  I doubled the the recipe, left out the salt, used italian spice (did not have basil) and added 1 tablespoon of lemon pepper.  I also "blackened" it by cooking it on a slightly higher heat and served it with a side dish of herbed broccoli brown rice.  Next time I will post a picture.  We all loved it and it was so easy! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for sharing!!

This was the easiest and tastiest salmon I've ever had. The lemon juice really tops it off. One thing I'd like to mention is to skin the salmon (it seems like a given but it doesn't state that in the recipe). Overall, it was delicious!

I usually prefer salmon grilled, but when I can't this is an outstanding recipe.  I also like to keep my simple recipes to 4 ingredients, which this beats hands down.  I've made it a few times now, and the best part is you can get a very tasty blackened crust on both sides.  Second time I made it I added a tbls of lemon pepper, which is equally good.  Thanks for sharing such an easy delicious recipe for all the salmon in my freezer.

My kids loved it. Even the kid that hates fish loved it and wanted more. As the recipe says it is Super Simple. I used thawed frozen salmon patted dry with a paper towel before rubbing with ingredients. I found it a bit salty so next time I will use less salt. Might use margarine instead of butter, worried about the fat content. Salmon is already a fatty fish.

This was so easy and tasty. I used chopped garlic and sauteed it with the butter for a few minutes before adding the salmon. I left out the salt, so it was just basil. 5 minutes per side was too long on medium heat. Squeezing the lemon wedges over each piece absolutely made the dish!

Amazing!  This will be the only way I fix salmon from now on (especially since I never get it right any other way).  I mixed the leftover piece of salmon with some lemon and mayo and came up with an awesome salmon salad sandwich.

this came out GREAT! i did not use lemon or butter nor did I measure the other ingredients exactly as the recipe called for. I sprayed a fry pan with cooking spray and it came out awesome.  I had a "non fish eater" friend over and he even said he liked it.  I will definitely make this again.

WOW! Made this last night, and it is awesome! Truly "super simple", but such divine flavor! Thank you! I did double up the seasoning mix as I used two frozen filets (12oz). I cook salmon about once a week, so I'm always looking for new ways to mix it up. This is it! :o)

I've made this several times, and it's always excellent. I don't go by the measurements, just sprinkle the seasonings on each side of the fish, and it's always great. Even our picky seven year old likes it.

The name says it all.  This was my first time cooking salmon, so I was a little nervous and it came out great.  My husband, who previously "didn't like" salmon wants it again as soon as possible.  I served it with a leafy salad with shredded carrots, diced cucumbers, and croûtons.

I can't believe how easy this is and so delicious.  My husband was joking tonight about how many different recipes I have tried making salmon.  He said of all of them this was by far the best and it was by far the EASIEST!  Thank you for sharing!

This was very good and very simple.  I too made minor adjustments.  I used Italian seasoning in place of basil.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 butter and olive oil which I sauteed fresh garlic in first.  I cooked 4 min. on each side. After removing from the heat I sprinkled each fillet with panko and transferred to a preheated broiler until nice an crunchy, golden brown.  Yum!!

I have made this several times and it has to be the easiest, most amazing salmon I have ever had! Tastes as good or better than any restaurant dish.

This recipe had a great flavor-but it was way too salty for our family. I cut the salt in half and sprinkled it on the fish instead of rubbing it in. Overall a great, quick recipe though!

I am trying to cook healthier for my husband. He loves salmon and I don't. I have never cooked salmon before so I needed a little help. This recipe was so easy and delicious. I did have to substitute a few ingrediants that i didn't have on hand. Such as sun dreid tomato's instead of fresh and a yellow onion instead of red. It didn't mattter, my husband loved it. The salmon turned out great, and I even loved it. Thank you for this amazing, simple recipie. I felt like a chef!!

This was way too salty. Smelled wonderful while cooking, but very disappointing. I do think if salt was cut in half, it would be a decent recipe.

My husband LOVED this but I thought it was wayyy too salty. I couldn't even finish my fish it was so salty. The 5 minutes/side time was perfect though. I may make this again, but decrease the salt by half.

Ok, I did not have all the ingredients on hand so I had to make some changes.  First, I used just under 1/2 tsp of sea salt instead of regular salt, plus I added a bit of white pepper.  I only had fresh basil on hand so I added that to the butter and let it simmer for a short time before adding the salmon.  I also added a bit of lemon juice to the butter since I did not have fresh lemons on hand to serve with the finished meal.  It was a very easy dish to make and went over well with the entire family (2 adults, 4 kids aged 2-9 years).  In fact, all of the kids asked for seconds and have asked me to make it again soon.

A very easy and tasty way to make salmon. Even if you dont know how to cook fish this simple recipe will impress the crowd. As another poster did, I also used fresh garlic instead of powdered and put it in the pan with the butter a few minutes before placing the fish.

Looking for a new way to do salmon and the word easy popped out lol. I read a lot of the reviews and opted to use 1/4t salt, replaced basil w Italian seasoning and added some lemon pepper and Parmesan. I also followed someone else by cooking 4 min on each side and then moving to the broiler for a few minutes w some Panko. Everyone loved it! Served over some rice w vegetables.

Considering this was the first "meal" (I had some Uncle Ben's rice and ate the lemon for good measure) I was very proud of how it turned out!

I did deviate from the ingredients list by sauteeing a chopped up clove of garlic, which I had read in another comment before hand, and a slice of lemon with a little extra fresh-squeezed lemon juice (and a few sneaky seeds).

I think I overcooked it a little but it was well charred and that's the way. It was like being in my own restaurant.

This recipe is on point! I used it for cooking salmon for the first time in my life and it steered me right. The garlic powder, dried basil, and salt mix is a tasteful one. I added a small amount of olive oil to the mix to make it easier to spread on the salmon. I could not recommend this recipe more, it has my 100% recommendation. Enjoy!

Very good! I followed the directions - only change I made was to use 1/2 butter and 1/2  coconut oil. I added a couple of slices of the lemon to cook with the salmon the last 2 minutes. Served with jasmine rice, asparagus, and tomato/avocado salad. Drizzled the buttery/lemony mixture over everything after cooking the salmon. This Florida girl will be using this recipe regularly through the summer, for sure, it was Heaven on a plate.

Loved that fact that it was simple and everything is available in the cupboard.  The only thing extra I did was add dill weed and black pepper and spinkle just a small amount of lemon juice on top (didn't have lemon wedges). This is our go to recipe!!

Great simple recipe! I made it as written except I used Italian Seasoning instead of Basil b/c that's what I had on hand. I never know whether to leave skin on or off so I left it on, then removed it during cooking so my kids wouldn't gross out and that made them fall apart a bit. But overall: Easy, tasty, healthy, fast. I'm not trying to be a chef, just trying to get a healthy dinner on the table. Meets my requirements!

This is a great I-have-guests-coming-in-20-minutes-and-don't-know-what-to-make dish. Everybody was licking their lips and asking for the recipe. I refused to admit it was the  frozen salmon from the discount supermarket. Moist and full of flavour and so simple a child could make it. Thanks for the fabulous little invention!

This was so easy and so delicious.  I have made it several times now.  I added some chardonnay to the skillet and it gave it a more gourmet flavor.  This will be one of my staple recipes for fish.

This was just about perfect. Quick, simple, and uses ingredients most people have on hand. I was running low on basil so I substituted Italian seasoning. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and sauteed a little garlic in the butter before adding the fish. It was absolutely delicious! Even my 3 year old asked for seconds! This will definitely become a staple in our house

This was excellent, my husband loved it! I also chopped up some fresh garlic and let it slightly brown in the butter before adding the salmon to the pan. Very tasty, definately a keeper.

My husband and I are not big fans of salmon, but after reading the reviews on this recipe I thought I would give it a try. I made it last night for dinner and we both LOVED it!! I didn't change a thing about the recipe, it was simple & delicious...actually can't wait to make it again. A keeper for sure!!!

This recipe was great, I didn’t really follow amounts or the ingredients to a tee, I used a mix of oregano and basil along with Parmesan. But the cooking times and temps were just perfect.

This was just OK.  I was not a fan of the basil flavor with the salmon.  I think salmon lends itself more toward a sweet or smokey kind of flavor.  I will most likely not make this again.

Have been making something like this for some 40+ years.  However, I never cook for 5 minutes a side - too long and make the salmon too dry, and never use salt as the salmon is a salt water fish, and the lemon juice is a good substitute for salt.

I would use half the basil next time (only half a tablespoon), and I squeezed fresh lemon juice on the salmon before cooking, as well as sprinkled it with fresh dill. Tasted great - I did it on the bbq, which worked out beautifully.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Like everyone, I'm trying to eat more fish and this quick recipe makes that easier. I had an early morning workout and followed with this salmon for breakfast. I seared one side and followed the recipe exactly - only quartered the ingredients for a single piece of salmon. Thanks for sharing.??????

Wow! I needed to find a simple salmon recipe to go with some pesto I made (beet, hemp seeds, garlic & lemon). This one is super simple and delicious exactly as written. My husband and I both loved it. Will definitely make this again!

The best salmon I've ever had. Felt like a professional chef made it. And just a little pointer; soak the salmon in lemon juice before you season and sear it. For about 2 minutes.

Very easy! I am a novice level cook in every sense. However, I breezed right through this meal. I made this for children, 3 and 8, and they gobbled it right down. I tried this same rub on Cod and it was okay, but nothing to write home to mom about. I will definitely plan on making this again! Yum!

I substituted the garlic powder for the garlic salt and did not need any salt and lemons for limes and dash of black pepper to give it little more seasoning.

I needed a quick, easy way to fix the salmon fillets I had as time was getting late this evening.  I found this, and although I was a little hesitant when reading the ingredients and method, I decided to try it.  It was very good!  I can't give it 5 stars but for a quick dinner, it was surprising.  I know I'll be making it again.
It went wonderfully with a summer squash and zucchini casserole I made.  A nice, light dinner that both my DH and I thought was pretty darn good!  Thanks for a keeper, Slinkywink!

I have two roommates who pretty much never agree on what to eat. Salmon was on sale at the grocery store and I grabbed it assuming no one would eat it and I'd have a few days of leftovers. I used this recipe and now this is the ONLY dish we can all agree on (not Mac and cheese, not hamburgers, just salmon) I actually sort of hate it at this point to be honest but the first dozen times around it was quite good. If you have a thicker piece of salmon be prepared to cook it a few minutes longer than the recipe calls for but otherwise do exactly what it says and you'll be fine.

Super easy and very good!  Whole family enjoyed it.  I put basil, kosher salt and a 1/2 tsp. of lemon pepper on a plate and mixed.  Pressed both sides of fish into mixture and placed in hot skillet with butter and a half teaspoon of minced garlic.  Cooked 5 minutes, then flipped and added a tsp of lemon juice to the top of each filet.  Served with rice and broccoli.

AWESOME!!! The only thing I did differently was I drizzled fresh lemon juice on top while it cooked. Seriously a great recipe. Super quick and easy. I'm making it again tonight ;-).

Very simple and nice flavor. I made with orzo with parm and basil from this site and the whole meal really pulled together nicely. I did feel it needed a touch more salt but that might be a personal thing not a lack of salt in the recipe

Have to echo the others...5 stars for easy, elegant, and delicious! My salmon was a thick center cut, so I had to turn down the heat and cook a little longer for doneness. I used sea salt, and a bit less based on recommendations. Also used half olive oil and half butter. I started serving from the thinner side while the thicker side finished, and I had a hard time not wolfing mine down right at the stove. Thanks so much!

This was very quick and easy and best of all, I had all the ingredients which is why I gave a whirl.
I used fresh basil and also used olive oil on the salmon before pan frying in a little butter. Will do it again based on ease and quickness.

This was my very first time making salmon and I was terrified of drying it out.  I followed the recipe, held my breath, and it turned out FANTASTIC.  My husband, usually the slowest eater in the world, wolfed his down faster than I did.

My family loved this!I will use this recipe again and next time I will use a little less butter and add olive oil to reduce the saturated fat a bit.  I also think using really fresh, good quality spices and sea salt is important with a simple recipe like this.  It really was fast and easy to prepare. I had a zucchini dish baking in the oven and started cooking the fillets for the last ten minutes it was in the oven and the timing was perfect!

This is by far the easiest and tastiest salmon recipe I've found.  It's become a great standby using frozen salmon fillets and raiding the spice cabinet.  Even my dad, who doesn't like salmon or garlic, loves this.

This was delicious!! I added cajun seasoning being from the South and fitting more to my family;s pallet, but it was even a hit with my husband, who claims Salmon is the only fish in the sea he doesn't eat. As well as my 6 yr old and 1.7 month old. I will definitely prepare again!

Fantastic.  Salmon is one of our favorite meals and this one ranks up at the top!  I cook it little more over high heat to blacken the fish on both sides.  Was incredibly delicious.

I try to prepare the recipe as written the first time before rating it .... not much sense rating a recipe that's been changed by 30%!!! I thought this was really good ..... but a little too much butter contribution for me. I think the next time I fix this I will lightly coat the filets with EVOO then apply the seasoning, then sear it in a medium/hot skillet or even my Panini Grill. I will also try the suggested Lemon Pepper addition.

Oh My Word!! This recipe is amazing.  The salmon was just melt in your mouth goodness.  I used pepper in addition to the listen spices and chopped up a garlic clove instead of using the garlic powder.  I also broiled the salmon in the oven instead of pan frying - trying to watch my fat intake.  It was still moist and tender and that little bit of lemon Whoo-Hoo!

This was super quick and very tasty! I love any dinner I can throw together in ten minutes, and to have it taste this good was a double treat.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was delicious and so easy! My fiance had seconds and said it was the best salmon yet! I used fresh basil because I was out of dried basil (of all things).

I don't know why I thought adding more fresh garlic to the butter before cooking would be a good idea!  It was still tasty, but I screwed it up by adding too much garlic.  I will stick to the recipe next time and I know it will be great!! Thanks! :)

This was very easy and really delicious.  I was out of basil so I substituted with a Italian seasoning. I like my salmon with a little extra lemon flavor so I added a table spoon of lemon pepper. This was so easy.

The recipe stands on its own merits, simple and straight forward.  What more do you need?  Our sides were asparagus and salad. Added french baguette and a nice chardonnay.

Absolutely delicious and simple.  I don't like too many ingredients with fresh fish - it overpowers it.  I would rather have something simple that lets the flavors come through.  This really fit the bill - good mix of flavors and easy to make but not overpowering.

Super easy and came out great.  I dont even have anything but sea salt, but I dont think that is the key to the simplicity of this recipe.  For me it was, that it was a very simple and quick way to make a great healthy dinner for my son and I.  Steamed broccoli, an roasted baby red potatoes and I was in heaven, lol.  
Some lemon wedges on the plate for either the broccoli or salmon, and easy peasy.   Ty for submitting

What an easy and delicious way to fix salmon. We 
Are currently on the coast of Washington and good salmon is plentiful.  We added fresh lemon at the table side but otherwise  I used the recipe as written.

Broiled it skin down for 5 minutes, flipped brushed with the melted butter to which I had added lemon juice.  Even the 12 year olds ate it all up.

I left out the salt, didn't have any garlic on hand so used minced onion instead with the black pepper, basil,  and added a touch of cinnamon. It blackened the top and bottom of the Salmon. the taste was very nice for my first time cooking a Salmon. a little dry on o e side of the fish. Still very good! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this twice last week. Before making it I sprinkled the fillets all over with Kosher salt and some sugar. I let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes and then rinsed them off in ice water. 

From there I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent!  The next time I make it I will cut back a bit on the garlic powder.

This is really good and so simple.  I added garlic to the butter. Not sure if I will do that again or not. The garlic got pretty dark before the salmon  was cooked through. I pan fried, skin side up, first. Then flipped and grated some parmesan cheese over the top, after a few minutes, I flipped again and got a nice parmesan crispiness. It was really good!

Pretty good! It was simple, but had a nice flavor. I like to cook skin side first to get it crispy, and then just a little brown on top. It was an easy and quick way to get dinner on the table without feeling like you're punking out. Will probably use again.

Truly as it easy and delicious as everyone has shared.  I took the advice of one of the reviews and added Lemon pepper to the rub - and then topped it off with lemon slices while it was cooking.  So good.

Love this recipe as a base..I added some olive oil (enough to marinade the fish) and juice from a lemon with the ingredients. Then marinade fish for about 10 minutes while I cleaned? up.  I followed cooking directions, excluding the butter.  Sakmon was very tasty!

Super simple indeed! I don't like basil on fish so used dill, but the proportions still worked. My picky boy was a little lukewarm on it, but the rest of us loved it. New staple for a quick but healthyish dinner.

Delicious! Remember, if your salmon is thicker, it may take a little longer to cook to flaky stage.  I used garlic salt and omitted the salt since I didn't have garlic powder on hand. Be careful not to add too much--for a salty taste.

We really liked the flavor and I loved the simplicity of this recipe!  No marinating or extra spices or fresh ingredients to chop.   As others suggested, I added some fresh garlic to the pan and let it cook for 2 minutes or so before adding the fish.  Perfect!  I never prepare fish on the stove top, but will use this recipe for salmon from now on.  Much more flavorful and couldn't be any easier or faster!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!!!!  So very easy and the seasonings added to the salmon but did not overpower it. I cooked it for 5 minutes on each side but it was a bit underdone. However, 1 minute in the microwave dud the trick!  This was absolutely delicious And I will definitely make it again!!!!!

Definitely the quickest and easiest, yet tastiest salmon recipe I have made.  Moist, with lots of flavor, and the garlic gives it that nice crisp crust.

I did them in aluminum packs and they turned out awsome.  First time fixing Samon and this recipe was just right for a first timer.
I will try and remember to add more salt to the veggies and remove the lemon slices under the fish after it’s cooked if I have leftovers .  I left the lemon and it was a little sour/bitter the next day.
It was still good tho.

Followed directions except used a little less butter. Next time we'll use less, maybe 1 1/2 tsp to 2 tsp for 4 (5oz) pieces of salmon. It was easy & no all night marinating or putting on the grill when it is very cold here.

I found this recipe by doing an internet search for 'simple salmon recipes'.   It was perfect for me.  Delicious.  The seasoning was more like a paste for me so I couldn't brush it on.  Rather, I patted it on the salmon.  I thought the 10-15 minute cook time was going to be too little and it was.  My salmon needed about 25 minutes to complete baking.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful! Our salmon had skin on it so we just put the seasoning all on one side and let the skin crisp up on the other. Some ate the skin, others did not. Either way it was delicious and SO SIMPLE!

I added a 1/2 TBSP of onion powder. It tasted fine but the combo of salt and garlic was a bit over the top. I may cut back on both next time I make it. Family thought it was good.

I always have these three things in my pantry so if I've bought salmon this is a great way to prepare it without heating up the kitchen with the oven.

I used canola oil so that the herbs would stick to the fish first.. I added Old Bay seafood seasoning along with the basil. It came out with a wonderful "crust" on it. My son, who loves salmon, has asked me to make our salmon this way EVERY time! :)

Wanted to try a different recipe, found this and thought I'd give it a try. I added minced garlic and smoked paprika to the recipe. And I squeezed lemon juice into the pan while it was cooking. Came out pretty tasty.

I followed the principal of the recipe making the three ingredients into a rub for several recipes than used it as needed for how much fish I had. We are big salmon eaters so it’s usually a good amount. I cook the skin aid first then upon flipping I add a Chardonnay to taste. Don’t have lemons readily available so I pour in lemon juice just before serving. Makes great sauce for rice bedding

Delicious. I made this and it was great. I didn’t have any lemon and I would cut the salt in half. I will  make this again. Even my toddler loved it. I served it with scalloped potatoes and mixed steamed veggies.

Super simple and delicious and I didn't make any alterations to the ingredients. I cooked it on a cast iron skillet and spooned the excess butter from the pan onto the fillets during the time it was cooking so the butter was more incorporated. I will definitely make this again.

This really was super simple, but delicious. I made some changes by mistake and some not by mistake. I grabbed the garlic salt off my spice shelf instead of the garlic powder so I just eliminated adding extra salt to the recipe. I skipped using butter and went for olive oil instead as a healthier alternative. I also substituted fresh basil, which I had on hand, for the dried basil.  I think this made a huge difference. Fresh is much more pungent and really brought out a nice flavor to the salmon. I would make this recipe again using the same changes I made.

This was an absolute success for my husband and teenagers!!!  What I did was cover the front and back side of the fish with the seasonings and place on the frying pan (over the melted butter like recommended). I then "sprayed" it with some lemon juice from fresh lemons and let it cook up for 5 minutes one side and flipped over and used lemon juice again. Then flipped again and again  (so each side got 10 minutes total). Oh my gosh!!  Incredibly moist!!  Won't go on the grill ever again.  I can't tell you how good it was. My honey isn't a huge fan of garlic and this amount suggested cooked up so well you could really only smell it. Delicious!!

So easy, no prep and all ingredients ready on hand! My husband made it and he doesn’t cook! Best part, it is super tasty! This is fool proof and great. Used 1/2 the salt asked for and sprinkled black pepper.

This is such a simple, but delicious recipe for salmon! Love that I always have the spices on hand. I like to make a simple sauté of cherry tomatoes (halved) and garlic (minced) in olive oil when making salmon with rice. When I made this recipe, I just added the tomatoes and garlic to the pan about halfway through cooking the salmon, and let it sauté in the butter. Delicious! Will most certainly be making this again!

Made this last night as written. The 5 minutes on each side was great timing. I used sea salt with my cooking and this came out perfect. I did add lemon pepper as suggested by some reviewers. The recipe was easy and simple, the salmon was great. Thanks for sharing.

Simple and delicious! We are salmon lovers so this was an easy dinner night! Thank you!
***I have made this several times and it is always good! I mix up the herbs in a zip lock ( change up the seasonings to your liking) and shake the fish all around and throw it on the cast iron!

Great quick recipe. I had all ingredients on hand but forgot about the lemon at the end. My salmon filets had skin, still cooked up beautifully in a matter of minutes. Would be delicious dinner or quick lunch. Company-worthy.

I am not really a fan of salmon, but this was sooo good! I didn't want to take the time to measure out the seasonings so I sprinkled each of them on. I also used lemon pepper salt instead of regular salt and baked it to also save time.

This was a great, easy recipe for really tasty salmon. The only problem I had was that it ended up a bit too salty, so next time I'll go a little lighter on the salt. Keeping this one in my list of recipes!

Super easy and very tasty!  I used about 2 teasoons of butter and about 4 teaspoons of Canola oil to get the butter flavor but be healthier. I'll definitely keep the recipe and make it again as my husband and I both like salmon and try to have fish at least once a week. My husband commented that it was really good and he liked the texture of the outer fish which was almost crispy. I enjoyed it with the lemon while he preferred it better without.

Just as the title suggests, SUPER SIMPLE, but delicious as well. We have salmon about once a week and this recipe is used about every other time I make it. No adjustments necessary, just follow the recipe. My kids 11 and 13 love it as well.

Simple indeed, and ultra delicious.  Looks impressive as well.  I paired it with our family favorite, steamed broccoli.  I'm jazzed at how quickly dinner was cooked and ready.  Thanks for sharing!

We don't care for salmon so I used haddock.  It was very good.  Not the best but I would do this again.

I really liked this salmon recipe. It was the first time I had ever made oven baked salmon, but I had tasted it many times, so wasn't clueless about how it was supposed to taste. I feel like next time I'm gonna put in a little less lemon, just because the lemon taste was a bit overpowering in places. It was super tasty though! Yum!

I use this to make my salmon.  I only use the butter and lemon juice.  No salt needed.  I am not a pepper person or a garlic person.  I wrap in tin foil and bake.  No mess, nothing to clean up.  Taste great.  If you do use garlic, try it with garlic powder instead, not garlic salt.  Cuts down on the salty taste.  Also, make sure the butter is unsalted.

Nice and easy salmon for a quick meal and/or the amateur chef. I do agree that simmering a clove of garlic with the butter helps immensely with the flavor - the fish is a little bland on its own otherwise. Haven't tried it with the sea salt substitution suggested in the top comments yet - will have to add that next!

Fan favourite in our house. It takes virtually a few minutes to have the salmon ready and on a plate. We've even gone so far as to pre-make the seasoning.

So, so good! My wife asked me to do supper tonight because it was a busy week. I looked for a simple recipe and this caught my eye after my daughter had mentioned salmon earlier in the day. I made the recipe as instructed, adding white rice and broiled asparagus that I tossed in oil and minced garlic then topped with a bit of parmesan cheese.

This was amazing and so very simple.  I turned the heat up right at the end to blacken my spices a bit and it really gave it a wow factor.  Very Very good and will make again for sure.

Delicious! And a very simple cooking technique that makes you look like a pro! Beautiful presentation, great flavor. (Note: let the thickness of the salmon determine if the fish should be cooked for a little less time.)

I cooked this salmon for my twenty five year old daughter whom is very particular about what she eats.  She don't have many recipes on her recipe list but I'm looking for some.  She said she enjoyed this salmon rub after I asked her a few questions to find out exactly what she thought about the salmon dinner.  She don't cook yet, but is my Animator who just graduated recently.

This is perfect! It's fast, easy, and delicious! You can't beat that! I did follow a previous review which sautéing garlic in the butter prior to placing the salmon! It's perfect.. just becareful with the time it DOES NOT need 5 minutes per side! Already made it twice this week and will keep making it!

I love this recipe. It's quick and tasty and has become a staple in our home. The only thing I do differently is use olive oil instead of butter. I also just recently tried baking it and it came out just as delicious.

This was a quick and easy dinner preparation, and I'll definitely try it again. I did make quite a few changes. First, I didn't have basil, so I substituted it with coriander. Second, I used garlic sea salt instead of garlic powder and regular salt. Finally, I figured the recipe might be a little too salty for me (I like my food with a hint of sweetness), so when I melted the butter in the pan, I added some honey. It worked out beautifully, and I was delighted with the results. Because of my various tweaks and workarounds, the lime wasn't really necessary. What I like about this recipe is that you can make all kinds of customizations.

Personally this was too salty and did not sit well with me; however, everyone else in my family as well as my best friend's young sons (9 & 13) loved it.

This is so good! I am usually  looking for recipes that disguise the flavor of salmon, but this super easy recipe brings out the natural flavors beautifully. I used recipe as offered, except I replaced dried basil with fresh.

Like another reviewer, I sauteed some fresh garlic in the butter & placed the salmon on that to cook.  I had about 1 1/4 lbs of fish.  It was an exceptionally delicious, simple, and quick meal served with rice and a salad.

This was super easy and tasted great! I have made it twice already and will definitely be making it again. The only thing I changed was that I added both basil and oregano to the garlic powder and I substituted onion salt for regular salt. A fantastic new staple for our family!

This recipe is wonderful! I have made it dozens of times over the past three years. It always comes out great. I usually cook it on the George Foreman Grill (coated in butter) that I level by putting a cutting board under the front legs. I don't want any of the delicious flavors dripping off. I like to use the pink wild caught salmon fillets that you can get in freezer bags.  They are individually vacuum packed and you can thaw the portions you need in about 10 minutes. I think those complaining about too much salt may have used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. Fresh lemon puts this over the top.

They weren't kidding when they said, "Super Simple". I added a clove of garlic and I think it took it to the next level. I'd make this dish again in a heartbeat.

Fantastic! It was my first time ever cooking salmon. It turned out perfectly. My niece even gobbled down a full portion, and she doesn't usually like cooked salmon.

This is so easy, and really flavorful. The second time I made it I used olive oil instead of butter, and I think I liked that better.

This dinner was perfectly delicious and a healthy option! I subbed regular salt for sea salt, added onion powder to the rub, and used coconut oil instead of butter to keep it within my diet guidelines. Served with asparagus sautéed with minced garlic and red onions. Baby girl ate carrots on the side. All around flavorful yet completely healthy family meal!

Delicious. Just sprinkled on the seasonings and added pepper. 5 mins each side perfect for trader joes fillets 8oz each.  Less time needed for thawed Costco ones.

My husband loved it. I made changes : used fresh basil, olive oil, skipped garlic, used cherry tomatoes and skipped the cheese and lemon. 
I accompanied with a spinach salad with cherry tomatoes dressed in basil and champagne Vinager. Pepper and sea salt to taste.

I love Salmon and this was great. The spices were subtle but tasty, though be careful with the melted butter etc. I must have had the heat up way too high cause it blackened each side of the Salmon but it still tasted great.

SMOKE ALERT:  I am revising this rating to remind myself that the kitchen fills with smoke when I make this dish.  We still think it's a great recipe, but usually have to eat in another room.

4.5 Stars:  This was surprisingly good and we especially liked the little bits of char in spots.

The only change I made was to use garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt, because I didn't have any garlic powder on hand.  This dish is easy and delicious.  The lemon along with the basil and garlic salt was perfect!

This has become the go to recipe in our house. Its quick, easy and delicious; and better than most salmon I've had at restaurants.    I did take the advise of another reviewer and reduce the heat to medium before cooking for 4 min per side. With this change the fish stays tender and full of buttery flavor.

Excellent recipe! I read prior reviews and used the sea salt, added a bit of pepper, substituted olive oil for butter, and added 2 tablespoons of lemon dill finishing sauce. My family (and I) were so pleased with the recipe it will become a regular meal for us!  Ive made it three additional times!

As soon as my 7-year-old exclaimed, "Mmmmmmm! What did you put on the salmon? It is so yummy!" I knew this recipe was a winner. The only thing I did differently was to cook my salmon fillets (about 1 and a quarter inch thick) in my cast iron skillet, skin-side down for about 7 minutes to get the skin crispy and then I flipped it for 2-3 minutes to finish it.

Thank you for this! I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt and I used Italian seasoning instead of the basil and it was soooo good! 10 min. was perfect. The skin slid off and it flaked apart perfectly.

My boyfriend loved this salmon. I did  it  a little differently I took about a cup of lemon juice and the seasonings, I added cayenne pepper, paprika, and thyme. Marinated the fish in the fridge for about 20 mins, It came out delicious.

Using the same ingredients, only baking for 12-15 minutes at 425'. Simple and quick!

Just like the name says - Super simple and tasted so good! One of my favorite things about this recipe is that it uses ingredients that we always have around the house, so we don't even have to go out and buy anything special for it. Salmon is so quick to cook that I don't know why we don't make it more often - it would be great for nights that we have things going on, but not much time to cook anything. I need to remember that! Four out of five of us liked this a lot, so I'm sure we will be making this again soon. Thank you for the recipe, SLINKYWINK!

This really is easy but restaurant taste. Cooking OVER MEDIUM in butter, five minutes each side was perfection.  Just added a bit more salt. THE BEST Salmon I have ever cooked on stove.

I wanted something really light and easy and found this recipe. Used a thawed wild caught filet and sea salt(because that's the only salt I use). Squeezed on the fresh lemon wedge after plating.It was exactly what I had in mind and was delicious!

Easy and very flavorful.  I put it on a layer of brown rice and subbed dried basil for what I had, which was a tube of basil paste and mixed it in with the other spices.  Finished it off with the lemon squeeze and ate it all!  Just what I was in the mood for.

This was extremely easy and came out wonderful. The only thing I did different was squeeze lemon on the fish after washing it and adding about teaspoon more of butter while cooking.

I tried this in a pinch with our first ever fresh salmon fillets (4 oz portions) - a pretty big risk for me as I seriously didnt want to mess them up. I added ground black pepper (cause I really like pepper) and skipped the garlic powder. I sprinkled them with the mixed seasonings and rubbed it in. I am sure I could scratch together a few other seasonings if I were to look around the cupboards.

I preheated my pan on medium then turned it down a notch so as not to cook them too hard. I fried them in butter for about 4 1/2 minutes per side, turned off the burner and added (store bought) minced garlic to the pan and took it off as the garlic was just turning brown.

Suffice it to say I had to share my last bite of salmon with my wife who ate hers up first. We will have this again soon!

Great fast dish. Sauteed onions and mushrooms in butter and garlic and spooned over. Gave it a bit of elegance for being so simple.

This is the first time I have had anything with salmon that I liked.  I am not a real big fan of fish period, but the doctor has told my wife since she is doing everything else she can to help with her cholesterol, this is her last resort.  So I am trying to look for recipes for the fish she is eating that I can come to like as well, and this will be one I continue to use from now on.

I needed a simple salmon recipe, so I decided to try this one.  It did not disappoint!!  The flavor was excellent, and it was SO quick to make.  Because I am completely removing sugar out of everything I eat or make, I specifically chose this recipe, as many of the other salmon recipes call for sugar as an ingredient.

I used 1 1/2 lbs. fresh, wild caught salmon, and the seasoning quantity was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my parents tonight. We all loved it! I put the rub on both sides of the salmon. Next time I'll just do one side as it was a bit salty (tasted great but I was really thirsty afterward). This recipe is a keeper- quick, healthy and delish!

Simple ingredients made such an amazing salmon. My husband who very picky about trying new things&fish, LOVED it. Since we're on the road to better/healthier eating I used coconut oil instead of butter. Other than that followed recipe to the T.  Thank you slinkywink!

Only had salmon once before and absolutely hated it, but I wanted to try cooking it myself, so I tried this recipe. I opted to use minced garlic instead of the powder, used Mrs. Dash instead of basil, and used 1/8 tsp of Goya Adobo instead of salt. I also only used 1 tbsp of butter instead of 2 since I was only cooking 4 oz of salmon fillets. I can honestly say I now LOVE salmon! Thanks for this easy breezy recipe!

Simple, quick, easy and common ingredients. Very easy to make; however, next time I would use 1/2 the seasoning. I rubbed as much as I could off after cooking, but it was still a bit strong. Good flavor though.

This was very easy for me, a novice cook. I really liked it & my picky toddler & hubby both liked it too. I did not have the lemon wedge so skipped that part. See my pics!

I thought this was very good for how quick and easy it was. I used olive oil instead of butter, so that may have reduced the flavor a bit. Also, I agree with Neena. It was probably best to put it on low for the five minutes on each side. This will be the base of my to go recipe for preparing a quick salmon from now on. =)

Wow! Dinner was done in a flash and delicious.  I added the lemon pepper which I believe grave great flavor to an already tasty way to prepare salmon.  A Keeper!
