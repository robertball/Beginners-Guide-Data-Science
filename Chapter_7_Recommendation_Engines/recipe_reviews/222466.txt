Excellent cookies.  Got rave reviews from about 30 people.  I did substitute margarine for the Crisco Butter Shortening - Sorry Crisco.  I didn't have any Crisco.  Very easy, very quick, nice presentation with the powdered sugar.  I doubled the recipe and got 76 cookies.  I'll be making more of these for Christmas.

These were yuck. Very bland and weird consistency. I think they would have been much better with actual butter.

Followed the recipe as is (which I always do the first time I make something) everyone loved them. I love cookies with the Crisco Butter Flavor shortening and find the items taste great and no one thinks they aren't butter.

I def lowered the cooking time for my oven to something around 18 minutes then in for another 2-3 (but my oven and pans tend to run hotter)

Will be making these again

These cookies are delicious exactly as written!!! I always top with a royal icing colored to match the occasion.  I just made them with 3 different shades of pink icing for a baby shower.

Deliciously nutty! I used hand ground almonds and it gave it a beautiful texture and an extra nutty hint. Everybody loved them:)

Delicious, crisp, melt in your mouth cookies! An easy alternative to the more time consuming traditional Linzer cookies!
