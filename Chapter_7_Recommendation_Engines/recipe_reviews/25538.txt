Being a Professional caterer for over 25 years, this recipe is actually a staple on my Hors d'oeuvre list for at least the last 15. Customers love these. I did, however, change a few things. I found that processing ingredients was definitely not a good idea- end result is too pasty. I coarse chopped the artichokes and onions, added more hot sauce, and some Italian dressing without the oil. I just use seasoned bread crumbs, eliminating the need for Italian seasoning. Bake in mini muffin pans 350 10 min.

My wife made these yesterday and had the following suggestions - double or even triple the artichoke as the flavor got lost in all the cheese - too many eggs - not enough breadcrumbs - she also plans to bake these in a shallow pan so she can cut them into small squares - I thought they tasted like cheesy scrambled eggs myself

As written I couldn't understand why this recipe would be called artichoke bites using only one jar of artichokes. There seemed to more egg in this then anything else, so I cut the eggs down to four and used four jars of the artichokes. It turned out delicious!

The changes I made to this recipe made a fantastic app. I sauteed the onion and garlic in butter, only used 4 eggs, and added 3/4 cup mayo. I did not use blender, I hand mixed it. This gave them great texture.
My second batch I added 2 T. pesto. This was also fantastic.

Made this twice, both times bring it to work to share. The first time I followed the recipe as stated, the 2nd time I added about a  2tsp or more of Hot sauce and worcestershire. Also upped the Italian seasonings to 2 tsps.  Cut back on the onions and left the Artichoke pices much bigger.  Hands down, the second go around won their hearts and stomachs!!

This is a great appetizer for a party.  I made these a few days in advance and froze them.  I heated them for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Everyone loved them - even guys who don't usually like artichokes!  I also made the same recipe with 1/2 browned bulk sausage (in place of the artichokes) and used 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese instead of a cup of the 3 cheeses.  They were excellent.  Definitely use mini muffin pans for bite size appetizers.

This was a total hit with my bunco Group!I made a few changes though.... I added finely chopped water chestnuts and bacon pieces. I waited until the very end to add the artichokes so they would be a little more chunky. I thouhgt the 8 eggs was the perfect amount. The recipe made a large amount of servings but they were consumed quickly!
This one is a winner!!!!

Everyone loved these at Thanksgiving. Making them again, I'd double the artichokes and half the cheese â€“ I thought they were a little greasy and not artichoke-y enough. But they're a great base.

I was pleased with the overall result. I thought they were too "eggy".  I would make again, and use only 6 eggs and add the artichokes at the end.  They get too finely ground up added at the beginning.  Definately use the mini muffin pans.

I made exactly as directed.  Delicious.  I had many requests for the recipe.  I added the artichokes at the end of the recipe, and pulsed my blender so that they were not pureed.  I also let the mixture sit for 10 minutes to let the bread crumbs absorb the moisture.  They turned out perfectly (I did have to let them bake a little longer than specified)

A recipe you can't ruin if you try. I was in such a rush when I put this together that I didn't follow directions well. I processed the onion and garlic without cooking and then put them in the pan with artichoke to cook down. Then I processed everything together. Well, they still turned out. I used another re-viewer's idea and made them into mini muffin size. They were a bit difficult to get out of the pan even though I had greased them. Be careful not to add too much pepper because these are a mild flavor and pepper will overpower easily. It might be nice to chop olives or roasted red pepper to add to these.

Read the reviews... changed some things before making the for the first time: let the onion/garlic cook on medium for 10 mins or so to reduce the liquid a bit, used Mozz instead of Swiss, used a 1/4 cup total of both fresh parsley and basil, used italian seasoned bread crumbs & omitted italian seasoning, was generous with the worcestershire & hot sauce, and chopped all ingredients in a food processor, including the artichoke hearts.  I was not aiming for a perfectly smooth mixture, and this worked well.  I cooked them in mini muffin trays @ 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  They weren't browned, but 10 minutes gave the perfect quiche like consistency.  I got a lot of compliments on these and will definitely make them the same way again.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

I use this recipe quite often for holiday catering events. Rather than using a food processor, I keep the ingredients rather chunky. I substitute mozzarella for the swiss cheese; otherwise there are just too many flavors going on. Good base recipe.

This was an absolute SMASH at my birthday bash!  My dad ended up eating the last one and my mom took home the recipe.  I used the mini muffin pan because I thought the regular muffin pan would be too big.  It was PERFECT!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I first used this recipe ten years ago; for a work potluck. They were a smash and have been ever since! I vary the different types of cheeses I use each time, and a food processor really blends the ingredients (and the flavors) well. I also add dill in the mix. Don't be afraid to extend the baking time until they're golden brown. (They reheat pretty well, too)! Thanks, for this yummy recipe, Linda!

Needs a crust!  Line your muffin tins with pie dough or something.  Makes WAY more than it says it will.  Half it and you will be fine.

This recipe was wonderful.  A little time consuming making it the first time, but worth it!  It made so much that I refrigerated the batter I didn't use the first night and made it the next two nights again!

I added a tsp of dried basil for some added flavor, and omitted the hot sauce. For the parmesan, I just used the same stuff I shake over my spaghetti, and it worked fine. I did have to bake it for almost 20 minutes, and they never did brown on the top. Also, I used mini muffin pans, and found that it made for easier snacking since they were all bite sized that way. Also, the recipe isnt clear about draining the onion/garlic mixture, so I just let it simmer until most of the liquid had evaporated. They were very easy to make though, and made for a great snack.  I would make them again.

These aren't bad, although a bit greasy.  If you let them cool slightly, it reabsorbs a bit so you don't have to think about it.  I don't have mini muffin cups and just wanted to try the recipe, so I just used regular muffin cups.  I agree that mini would be better, but the taste is still good.  I halved the eggs and doubled the artichokes and didn't process; just rough chopped.  I'll try processing next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I brought these to a pot luck and they were everyone's favorite. They were very convenient in size and had a great taste.  I did have to cook them longer than 20 minutes instead of the recommended 15.  You can judge this by how well the egg is cooked.

I doubled the amt of artichoke hearts and halved the eggs and it was STILL too eggy.  I won't make this again.

I made these in my mini-muffin pan. I didnt put all the garlic called for, but I think I should have. Used 4 eggs, halved all the amounts of cheese, and added about a tablespoon more bread crumbs. 
I liked to taste the artichoke so I tried not to puree the art. too much. I might add spinach as well as more garlic next time. Bytheway, they taste better after sitting for a few hours/a day at room temp. Good recipe!

These did not do well with my crowd. They were okay, but the store-bought quiches were more popular, which rarely happens to me. I have a lot left over and I don't think they will be eaten. I may try it again with more artichokes, but I'm not sure. Sorry.

Pretty good, our guests liked so much they wanted the recipe.  I made a few changes by using 6 eggs, and instead of swiss I used mozzerella (couldn't find swiss already shredded!). I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of seasonings w/ plain, and used granulated garlic powder. If you don't like the aftertaste of marinated artichoke hearts, you can use a regular can and saute the onions w/ butter. Turned out great!

I had high hopes for this recipe and it just tasted bland and mealy.  The texture was a big turn off.  I did halve the recipe and cooked it in a 12" pan.  Maybe it tastes much better in the mini muffin cups.  Yuck, will not waste my time or money on trying again using a different pan, though.

This was an interesting appetizer.  I made a few changes by adding  an extra jar of marinated artichokes, only used 4 eggs and 1 cup of Mozzarella cheese.

Incredibly easy recipe!  I found that two hours was sufficient marinade time.  Also, gloves are helpful when skewering as the cumin can leave a yellow tint on fingers.  A huge hit at a recent Sushi party.  Served with Thai Kitchen peanut sauce available at local world market.

I made these at my last dinner party and everyone eat so many we had to postpone dinner for about an hour or so afterwards so everyone could regain their appetites. Very easy to make and a crowd pleaser.

I made these for Thanksgiving... they looked a little greasy to me when they first came out of the oven, but everyone said they loved them.  I will make these again!

This was the absolute worst tasting  I've ever created. I learned the lesson to read all the posted reviews available, not just some. I worry about the members who made this - and then actually said it was edible, let alone good.

These turn out like mini quiches. I've had mixed reviews on them, but if you like artichoke hearts and you like quiche, you should enjoy them. My hubby doesn't care for them, but my brother and I like them.

I really love artichoke so i thought i would try this out. I like them but i did think that they were too eggy, im also not a big egg fan either. so next time i make these i am going to put just half the eggs this recipe calls for. thank you for the share!

I made these for my 20-th high school reunion.  When I walked into the dining room, all the girls were oohing and ahhing over them.  So good, I ate some leftovers for breakfast!  Will definitly make these again!

I didnt like these at all - they were way too cheesy, but others thought they were ok which is the only reason I am giving them 3 stars.  I wouldn't try this one again.  Very disappointed.

I read all the reviews of this recipe and the only thing that I did different was I only used 7 eggs and added chopped asparagus. I had to bake them for 22 minutes, but still did not get much browning on the top. But still, these things are absoulutely fabulous! I am hoping to impress a date with them tomorrow!

Tasted a lot like quiche. I was looking for something different.
I might make again with slight adjustments.

Use more artichoke , less egg4-6, add fresh herb , more hot sauce sriracha or cayenne, use mini muffin tins or greased casserole to cut into squares.

At the suggestion of some of the other comments I used less eggs (5).  Turned out great.

I made this for a baby shower and many women asked for the recipe. I only prepared 1/2 of the mix and more was requested during the shower. I added 1 more can of artichoke hearts, used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss and I blended everything in the blender. YUM. will definately make it again.

Good recipe but I think mixing until smooth killed some of the flavor.  Next time I will just blend well and see how it goes

Great recipe.  No need to use more than 6 eggs.  One 14.5 oz can artichokes, drained--they would get too lost if the quanity was less.  I agree with previous reviews, don't process.
