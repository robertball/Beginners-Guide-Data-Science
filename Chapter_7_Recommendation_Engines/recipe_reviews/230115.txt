Fast and Easy! The ingredients complimented the fruit well. On the next batch of pies I added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon then precooked 2 cups of fruit and thickened using 1/4 cup water to 1/3 cup flour, bring to a rolling boil stirring constantly. Remove from heat and cool approx. 10 mins., build pie as above less 2 cups fruit. Lastly add precooked fruit mixture, lemon, juice and butter cubes, cover with crust and cook per directions. This makes the pie thick and easy to serve.

Delicious pie will make it again, used tapioca and used Splenda and subtracted 1/2 the sugar. Eating the pie with melted cheese was superb

Followed the recommendation of a previous reviewer and upped the cinnamon an additional 1/2 tsp. I would also recommend some flour in the pie to thicken the juices.  Turned out wonderful. I did cheat an add 1 gala apple in because I was getting tired of cutting and deseeding guava. Glad I did, because I realized I'm not a big fan of Guava. I also subbed 1/2 cup in place of the 1/2 sugar. All turned out great!

I didn't use flour because  of a gluten allergy so I just substituted with an egg.I also dubled the cinimon because I didn't have nutmeg.
