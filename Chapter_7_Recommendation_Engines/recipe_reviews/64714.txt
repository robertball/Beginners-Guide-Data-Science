I made this using ground turkey instead of the Boca meat, and it turned out wonderfully.  Very easy to make, and a great alternative to full-fledged stroganoff.

This was really good!  Things I changed:  I used ground turkey and omitted the oil and mushrooms.  I cooked the ground turkey and onions together until the turkey was cooked and then added the vegetable broth, egg noodles and garlic powder.  I let it sit for about 10 minutes (or until the noodles were cooked enough) and added the sour cream and parsley.  I only added about 3/4 of the container of sour cream at the most because hubby is not a fan of it.  But we both thought it was great!  Very easy and quick to make :)

This dish was very easy to make.  I liked everything but the vegetable broth, for some reason that made it taste funny to me.  I would make it again but would use something else instead of the broth.  Otherwise, very good.

I have been trying to cook healthy meals sans a stove for the past few months and was very happy to stumble upon this recipe! I usually make "hamburger" stroganoff and serve over cooked noodles but no longer have the luxury of precooking my pasta! I used Sanitarium's Vegie Delights Mince, fresh mushrooms, garlic and half of a chopped green pepper. Also added a pinch of paprika. I usedTri Colour pasta coz it is what I had on hand. It was fabulous and I will be making it again! Thx for sharing this simple recipe!

Turned out a lot better than I was thinking it would.  Only changes I made were to use canola oil and fat-free sour cream.  Frankly, the smell wasn't very appetizing before I mixed the sour cream in.  But once the cream went in, it tasted pretty good.  A nice, healthy dinner.

Yum!  Really good, easy to make.  A nice hearty meal for a cold winter night.  I used fresh mushrooms (I don't like canned ones) and it turned out great.  I just sauteed them very briefly with the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients.

This was wonderful, but only after I made some changes after finding (before serving) that it was bland. I used soy "meat" balls instead of Boca crumbles or real  beef; added chopped garlic (around 3 cloves); added about 1TBS of Worcestershire sauce (to help it taste beef-y). I also used whole wheat wide noodles, and fat free sour cream. We'll enjoy this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I've never had to rate a meal two stars before, but I figured if one star meant inedible, then this meal was two stars.  I thought it tasted how it looked: just kind of like a big mess of food.  Quite odd-tasting actually.  I served a side of cream-style corn, and we ultimately decided it tasted better with the corn mixed in.  Bc at least then it had a taste (corn).  Oh well, it was worth a shot!

This was very delicious!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly though: used Morning Star Farms because it was cheaper, added 1/3 cup white wine, used 1 can cream of mushroom soup instead of the canned mushrooms, added poppy seeds, and used spelt spiral pasta.  

My only complaint is that it was only half as good reheated the next day.  This dish should be eaten fresh for best results.  Otherwise, very tasty!

Decent but needed some salt, pepper and additional spices to pump it up a bit. Without, tended to be pretty bland.

This was a good, simple, hearty dish (but nothing to write home about). 
I substituted 2 garlic cloves for the powder and 1 sliced portobello for the canned 'shrooms (all of which I sauteed with the onions).  I added a can of cream of mushroom and used water instead of broth.  Because the fake beef I used was pretty gross (Lightlife Gimme Lean ground beef in a tube) and I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, I added some paprika, a dash of cayenne, a pinch of cloves, and a dash of G. Washington's Rich Brown Seasoning and Broth powder. As another revier mentioned, the whole thing looked/ smelled pretty unappetizing up to the very end. When I discovered that my sour cream was improperly packaged and moldy (gross, right?), I substituted the same amount of plain yogurt. It ended up being pretty nice with a side of sauerkraut (which nicely offset the sweetness of the stroganoff) and a green salad.

This was absolutely delicious!  I just made it last week, and I'm making it again tonight...yum!  I did substitute real garlic for the powder, and I think this time around I'll cook the noodles seperately, but other than that, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was fantastic!  I added a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce for a little extra flavor, which both my husband and I loved.  My two year old daughter (a picky eater) even ate this for dinner!

This recipe is extremly easy and hearty. I substituted whole wheat spiral noodles for the egg noodles. I did boil them in a separate pot for about 5 fives and then started the recipe. I also used two cloves of minced garlic, rather than the powder.  Parsley really gives this a great flavor in the end!

Excellent!  I add some extra spices to give it a little more flavor (some Spike works great).  This is a wonderful recipe and very easy cleanup!!
