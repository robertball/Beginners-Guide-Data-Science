Great recipe. They are super tasty.  I did however bake them at 350 for about 23 minutes and they were perfect.

This is my first attempt at making any kind of bran muffin so I don't have anything to compare it to, but as a muffin on it's own it was a tasty, healthy muffin.  The recipe says makes 12, but I followed it almost exactly and got 18 standard size muffins.  The only thing I changed was going half oil & half applesauce.  The slightly sweet is just right I think, and I cut up 2 regular size apples (which was about 2 1/3 c. when chopped) and that was plenty. They're a little crumbly, but that might be because of the oil change.  Or because we ate them too quickly after taking out of the oven :)  Will try following recipe exactly next time & see how they turn out.

I must confess I did use oat bran instead of wheat bran, and I added quick oats to the crumb topping.  For the flour I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  These were outstanding and I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe was excellent, and the muffins came out flavorful and fluffy. Changes I made were subbing two tablespoons of honey and 1/4 cup white sugar for brown sugar, and adding an additional teaspoon of butter to the streusel topping. Baked about 30 minutes. Delicious, and they look and taste like a gourmet muffin.

Wow! These are so delicious! Such a wonderful way to use up left over apples. This is the best recipe ever for bran muffins. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great! I am so happy.

This review is based on how I made this recipe:  I made this without the streusal topping and found it to be okay but lacking in flavour.  For next time, I suggest increasing the cinnamon to 2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and use the streusal topping.  I should update the review at that time.

Waste of time and money.  Followed the recipe exactly and the muffins had no flavor.  Disappointing

Followed recipe exactly as written.  The muffins were excellent in texture and sweetness.  Iâ€™m just making my second batch and will not change anything.

Great muffin recipe as is: healthy bran, not too sweet, oven temp and time are great, but room temp butter would be easier to get a crumb texture for the streusel. Great recipe!

I left out apples and strudel for a plain muffin and turned out great. It will be my go to bran muffin recipe now.

First time ever commenting on a recipe.  This is a great one! Did everything  the original recipe called for except used butter instead of shortening.  Delish!

Turned out great, but I had to alter it because of my allergies. Used gluten free flour, egg replacer, and earth balance instead of butter. They still tasted great!

Almost didn't make the struesal topping but very glad I did! If I hadn't they would not have been sweet enough. However, with it they were perfect! I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg. To make them just a little lower in fat I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for half the oil. I may make these again but it just depends how much my family members like them. I thought they were good, not great.

Loved these!!  Wanted to try something healthier and these were tasty and moist (not cardboard dust like some healthy muffins I've tried!). I tried the peanut butter added to the streusel topping as one reviewer suggested.  It was good but I prefer them without it.  I did substitute 2T honey and 1/4 C Truvia Blend for the 3/4 C brown sugar in muffin and then substituted scant 1/4 C Truvia Blend for brown sugar in topping. Worried about consistency of topping but it was fine.  Thinking about adding a couple tbsp of oatmeal to topping next time just to try.  Hubby enjoyed these too and he usually doesn't like anything even remotely healthy.  But he is diabetic and craves something sweet, so this was great for him with lower sugar (Truvia Blend does have some)  and lots of fiber.  Note...I froze half the batch so that we didn't eat them too quickly and we didn't notice any difference in taste after freezing.  May try reducing oil and adding some applesauce next time to see how we like that.

These were pretty good. Added a tablespoon of peanut butter to the strussle topping and tried some the normal way. When I make these again I will definitly add the peanut butter, it just added a little something that I found these muffins needed.
