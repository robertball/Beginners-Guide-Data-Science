I made this exactly with the exception of extra chocolate chips, since I'm a bit of a chocoholic. I tasted the first tray and decided to add some cinnamon to the rest of the batter just to see.  It gave it the extra something it seemed to be missing. The recipe is great as is or add a bit of cinnamon your choice, you will not be disappointed. I have both kinds mixed together in my container.

Delicious! Only change was I added at least another half cup of chocolate chips because one cup didnâ€™t seem like enough for the amount of matter. I made about 48 medium sized cookies with this one recipe. They taste great and are filling with all the oats.
