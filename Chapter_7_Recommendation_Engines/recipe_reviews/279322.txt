this is a really good recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe is written, although I did pack the measurements of lemon zest â€” I can never have enough lemon flavor! I spooned the flour into measuring cup and leveled it off with a knife to avoid dryness. This is definitely one I will make again.

Good recipe, but way too much butter. It was flowing out of the muffin trays whilst baking, and there was excess butter in the silicone molds after I took out the muffins. I'm not sure what the thought is behind using melted butter in the recipe? I will try this recipe again with 1/4 cup softened butter. I put almond pieces in the batter as opposed to doing a topping and that helped give some texture to this yogurt muffin.
