These needed much longer in the oven-I followed the directions for baking time and these were so mushy I ended up tossing them and starting over.

This was a great recipe.  I used half the butter called for, and Better than Eggs substitute and it turned out wonderful.  I definitely recommend increasing the blueberries.

My husbands comment re: the muffins:  "these rock".

An Added Note:  Fresh blueberries can be used instead of frozen if you like.  Also, lately I've been adding an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries which just makes them more heavenly! Hope you enjoy my recipe. - Shelley Albeluhn :o)

I added more blueberries to the batter and that made this recipe very moist.  My husband and I both enjoyed these muffins but next time I will add more brown sugar to add to the sweetness and I think I am going to try to use oil instead of butter next time.  I hope it won't affect the results.  I did use egg substitute and soy milk and it worked out very good.  This recipe was easy but will make more than 12 next time also.

These were quick and easy to make.  The cornmeal was a nice variation.  I doubled the recipe as I was feeding nine children and two adults.  They were a hit.  My husband said they were really good and needless to say, none were left.  We will keep this recipe.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  The cornmeal seemed to make them heavy and even though I cooked them quite a bit longer than called for, they were still soggy.  My 8 yo didn't like the texture that the cornmeal gave either.

I just made 2 batches of these and they turned out really well.  I replaced the butter with 1/4 cup oil, used egg replacer and soy milk and added more blueberries.  I also made one batch with whole wheat flour just to see how it would turn out.  And the only difference is it turned out slightly darker.  Otherwise they turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  Couldn't keep away from them.  I added extra blueberries as some suggested but found it to be too many - recipe calls for just the right balance.  Also added tsp vanilla - gave it the perfect touch!  Update:  Have made many times and found that cutting butter to 1/3 cup lessened the greasiness.

I made this recipie using a mini loaf pan instead of traditional muffins.  I cannot say enough how wonderful these taste.  The cornmeal changes the texture and the brown sugar makes them slightly sweet.  This recipie was an instant success with my husband!!

I had been looking for a blueberry cornmeal muffin recipe that would be as good as the one I had at an upscale hotel and this one is even better!  I have made these many, many times now and have played around with the recipe too.  Don't bother changing any of the ingredients, these are perfect and best tasting just the way the recipe is written.  My husband has been the "judge" of all of my variations (using whole wheat flour, less sugar, etc...) and he has said the original is definitely the winner.  I did take the advice of other reivewers and add a bit more brown sugar to the batter and since I love the crunch that the cornmeal provides I do add a bit more that the recipe calls for.  I use fresh blueberries so no need to coat with flour.  These are also so simple to mix up that you can make them in the morning for breakfast and have amazing tasting and hot muffins from the oven for breakfast.  I have found that these are best eaten on the same day as baking.  They don't stay fresh that long which is not a problem as they never make it past a day in our house anyway.  I highly recommend making these muffins, you will not be disappointed!

I can't rave enough about this recipe!!! It is absolutely fabulous. I have made it over and over all throughout blueberry season. I prefer these with one mashed banana added (but that's just me.) I also like 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries. This makes three mini loaves. (I like them so well as loaves that I've never made them as "muffins".) I cook them an extra 5 minutes, and they come out perfectly. The flavor is delicious and the texture with the cornmeal is so unique! The most recent time I made this, I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, and I also did 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. I didn't notice any change in the flavor or consistency, and I'm glad that I can make them a little bit healthier.

Once again Shelley you have out done yourself!! (See her Banana Banana Bread recipe.) The little bit of crunch and the light corn meal taste are wonderful! I used fresh blueberries, a heaping cup.  If you use fresh dry berries tossed in the dry mixture you will avoid the "purple muffin" syndrome.

These were to die for! The taste of the corn was so lovely and coming fresh out of the oven they were every bit as heavenly as I'd hoped.

Very easy and good!  Not much more work than a box mix.  I used the listed ingredients with one cup of frozen berries.  I melted the butter in a medium bowl in the microwave, then stirred the milk and egg into the melted butter.  Vegetable spray worked well instead of muffin cups.  The batter fit perfectly in the standard muffin tin (12).  They rose well and cooked exactly in 20 minutes.  My 11-year-old son was particularly fond of them.  I'll be sure to make these again!

This recipe is a definate keeper.  I made a batch last night and they are almost gone.  Even my 2 year old liked them.  The cornmeal is a nice added touch to them.  I didn't have any blueberries on hand so I used fresh strawberries (cut up very small).  And oh my god were they yummy.  Will sure be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great. I added cinnamon and used frozen blueberries. My husband referred to these as blueberry cake and my 2 little ones couldn't get enough. Next time I will also add some orange zest for an extra kick.

These were fabulous, really tastey. Only thing I would mention is that my muffins stuck to the paper muffin liners. I'll definitely make these again, but will use a greased muffin pan next time. Thanks for the recipe.

A nice blend for a great tasting muffin.  Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before I made them and I also added too many blueberries, my bad, and I won't do that again...it made some of the smaller muffins (I made veru large ones and smaller ones) a bit mushy...but again that was my fault.  I did use fresh blueberries not frozen also.  I will try these again measuring my blueberries exact.

After reading this recipe I couldn't wait to try it so I didn't.  I went straight to the kitchen.  I took the muffins out of the oven about 20 minutes ago and ate one as soon as the blueberries were cool enough not to burn my mouth.  They were delicious!  The cornmeal was an ingenious touch.   The only change I made to the recipe was using an additional 1/2 cup of blueberries but otherwise I followed it exactly.  I will definitely be making these again.

I just made these last night.  The dough turned out very runny and made a lot.  It was looking like I was going to have too much dough for my 12 cup muffin tin but I filled them as much as I dared to and they rose but it wasn't a mess.  The color is great, a nice golden color-the texture, and taste the cornmeal gives is a winner.  I made these with a frozen berry mix and it turned out great!!  Will definitely do these again

Followed the recipe as written except for substituting canola oil for the butter (I had run out).  I used frozen berries. The muffins had a pleasant crisp top, were moist inside, and kept well for the 2 days I could keep them in the house.  It was a loose batter and I was skeptical, but they turned out great. They did need more than 20 minutes - I baked for 28 minutes and they were perfect.  The cornmeal taste was not very pronounced, perhaps because I used very fine ground cornmeal.  Still a nice change from regular blueberry muffins. I will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe - not too sweet and very easy! I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour, reduced the butter by 2 T., added a little lemon juice and extra fresh berries. Delicious!  My son ate two while they were still warm.

I follwed the recipe exactly. It's quick and easy. The flavor is nice. I'll bake them again with extra blueberries next time. The only thing I didn't care for is greasiness. Maybe I'll replace some of the butter with apple sauce...

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, from every ingredient to the cooking time, and they were amazing, attractive, and unique. They are so easy to make, too. I will be repeating these often. I was a little worried about adding a whole Tablespoon of baking powder, worried they might taste bitter, but they weren't. They were divine. Not too sweet, either. I liked the amount of blueberries as I think it kept the flavors all subtle and complimenting each other rather than overpowering. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Fantastic!  I made the recipe as written and they are soo good!  My 3 year old, very picky son loves these muffins!  Having read the reviews that said the muffins don't stay fresh, I stored these in the fridge and reheated them in the microwave... fantastic!

These muffins are very tasty!  When I saw the ingredients, I thought it had way too much baking powder.  But I followed the recipe because nobody seemed to be complaining about it when I looked through the reviews.  Then I actually didn't taste of baking powder at all!  It just made the muffins very fluffy (fluffier than muffins I usually make though).  I used 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour.  I also added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed to make them a little bit healthier.  It was good that I took some reviwers advice; dredge the blueberries separately first, then fold them at the end, after you mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients.  My muffins turned to be beautiful (can you see my posted pics?) :)

Very tasty!  My 1 year old and my picky 3 year old both gobbled them up!  I used 2 cups of cornmeal mix I had on hand, eliminating all the other dry ingredients except sugar. I also added a touch of vanilla.  I used oil, instead of butter, to save time.  The 1st one seemed a bit dry just out of the oven, but the rest were quite moist and very filling.  They were even good later in the afternoon.

Just made this recipe on the spur of the moment since we are snowed in in Buffalo NY. They are delicious! Very moist, and not overly sweet. My kids are thrilled, and my husband thinks I'm awesome. Happy campers all around. Now, if only the muffins could help us dig out.......

Just made these & they tuned out wonderful! I made 2 changes, though. Instead of frozen blueberries, I used fresh and instead of milk, I used buttermilk. My husband loved them too! Will definitely make these again & again! :-)

I've made these quite a few times now and they are always a big hit.  I use frozen mixed berries instead of just blueberries and I use silcon muffin cups so they don't stick.  I melt the butter in a cup in the microwave and then mix the milk and egg right into the same cup. Instead of mixing the berries into the flour, I put a tablespoon of batter in each cup and then add berries to each so that I can distribute the berries evenly.  I then cover them up with the rest of the batter. Everyone who has tried these loves them and they are super easy to make.

These are the best blueberry muffins I've ever made.  I love cornbread muffins, so the combination of blueberry/cornbread was fantastic.  They are great fresh out of the oven with a cup of coffee.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turn out perfect every time!  Yum!

Great muffins, very simple and easy to make. I changed the recipe by using 3/4 all-purpose flour and 3/4 whole wheat flour, I eliminated the butter and used a 4 oz motts applesauce cup (sweetened, since that's all I had), and I doubled the blueberries.  I think I only got 10 nice-sized muffins out of the batter, but that's fine since it's only my husband and I; I know there won't be any waste since my husband liked them a lot too!

I substituted the butter for homemade, unsweetened applesauce, used probably double the blueberries AND added rasberries.  Very moist and full of good energy.

Love Love Love these! My 3 year old daughter and I made them, quick and easy! I used all wheat flour no white flour. But other then that stuck to the original recipe. So good! Has anyone tried to use yogurt instead of the butter? I want to phase that out for a more health friendly recipe. Great taste, crispy top!

Re: mushiness and oven time  After the first 20, mine were definitely not ready to come out, so I put them in the middle of the oven and added 10 minutes and I think it fixed the problem. Hope that helps others!

This is the first time I made muffins and I am slightly disappointed.  Maybe because I used frozen blueberries and did not drain the excess fluid, but I needed to bake mine for at least 35 minutes before they were done since they were still mushy.  They are not that sweet, but that it actually fine with me.  They did rise and look beautiful.  Next time, I will drain the frozen blueberries, and probably put more sugar in the batter for my husband.

Made as written, turned out great. Definitely better when doubled to make BIG muffins, but I had trouble getting them out of the pan so will use paper liners next time. Be sure to check w/ a toothpick if you do this!

Incredible!  This is the first time I made blueberry cornmeal muffins and these are fantastic!  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  Also, I added half a banana that would have been thrown away and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the tops before I baked them.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

We just love this recipe! It is practically foolproof. It is delicious as written, with half sugar and half oil too. Forgot the egg(!) once and it was still delish! Also suitable to for dairy free baking, as well as GLUTEN-FREE baking with a gluten-free baking mix, brown rice flour, or millet flour as a substitute for flour. YUM!

These were really good! We substituted regular flour with Bob's Red Mills Gluten Free Baking Flour, and instead of butter, I used applesauce. (My daughter cannot have milk or wheat)...They were sooo good. Just sweet enough. We also added cherries with the blueberries. We froze the remaining muffins for future use :) 
Very good!

I liked this recipe and so did my fiance! I do have a couple suggestions, however. First,I would add a tablespoon or two more sugar. Second, I didn't have blueberries at the time so I substituted with raisins which worked well.

This is a terrific recipe. I prefer fresh berries to the frozen and I sprinkle the top with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon before putting them in the oven. Mmmmm! The only bad thing is that I ate them all in one sitting where I had originally intended on having them for breakfast the next day, and the day after.....

I'm vegan, so I made some small changes in this recipe. I used ener-g egg replacer instead of egg, earth balance buttery sticks instead of butter, and unsweetened oat milk for the milk. I used slightly more than one cup of fresh blueberries. These were fantastic! If you're looking for a slightly less sweet muffin with that cornbread crunch on the edges, this is it. We ate them all in one day!

Deliciously moist, with a little crunch. My house of 5 had the whole dozen eaten within an hour.  Next time I will double the recipe!

If you like cornbread these are for you. Next time I'll add more blueberries just cause I really like blueberries but these were fantastic straight from the oven with a little butter.

I really enjoyed these. I did add more blueberries than call for and also add 1 teaspoon of maple extract. It goes so well with the cornmeal and brown sugar.

Excellent muffin. I was stuck one morning with a need for muffins and a lack of a couple of ingredients - my only survival change was using half cup Greek yogurt and half cup milk to make up the full cup and swapping mixed berries for straight blueberries.  Gas oven at the called-for temperature and they took only an extra minute.  Moist with nice texture because of the cornmeal - big hit with everyone - this is in my regular rotation now.

Amazing muffins... personally I found these to be the best tasting out of all my other muffin recipies!!! The whole family loved them. The cormeal adds a really good flavour and texture. It goes really well with the blueberries. I added some chocolate chips to a few of them for the kids. Also I baked this with less 1/3 cup of butter, threw in 1cup of frozen blueberries and baked for 30min instead of 20.

These turned out great! I made a couple adjustments to the recipe because I wanted to use up some buttermilk: 1 cup buttermilk instead of milk, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder (instead of 1 tbsp). I baked them for exactly 20 minutes and they came out perfect and moist!  Next time I would try to use a bit more cornmeal so that it stood out more.

Based on rave reviews I was really looking forward to making these muffins.  They are soft but have no flavour whatsoever!  I followed the recipe exactly and even added more blueberries (as recommended by the creator).  These need more salt/sugar or both.  I'm really disappointed.

More of a savoury muffin using listed 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  As I'm looking for a sweeter muffin I would likely, if I make this recipe again, use 1/2 cup each brown and white granulated sugar in the batter, or stick with the brown sugar in batter and sprinkle the top of each muffin, before baking, with a teaspoon of granulated white sugar.

Like most muffin recipes, I used this as a guide and tweaked it - 1/4 cup flax, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup all purpose.  I subbed in a half cup of sour cream for the milk, and cut the butter in half, and added some lemon zest and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also subbed the sugar for 1/4 cup honey and maple syrup.

I baked these muffins at 400 degrees for 15-18 minutes.   They were full of flavour and not soggy at all and I have definitely added my version to the muffin arsenal.

OK, yes, I made minor modifications. I used about a 2/3 white whole wheat flour and a bit more salt. Oh these are yummy!! Baked the recommended time and temp, which was perfect. I was regretting not making another recipe I spied here after putting these in the oven but they are quite tasty!

Very good! Made these this morning. Read some other reviews, and made a few modifications as a result. Reduced brown sugar to 1/3 cup, reduced melted butter to 1/3 cup, subbed 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, and used 1.5 cups fresh blueberries. Think I could have used less butter, will reduce to 1/4 cup next next. Delish and easy ~ will make again!

Not a bad recipe, especially if you customize it to your palate. I added about 1 T of orange rind, 1/3 C chopped almonds, 1 t vanilla extract, 1 t cinnamon, split the flour so that it was half AP and half WW and used canola oil. 

A few people noted that this is a very mushy batter so I tried a few things extra to make my muffins turn out well. First I added about 1/3 C of rolled oats to the batter and then I let it all sit for 10 min before portioning it out into the muffin pan. I baked the muffins for 22 min. The muffins turned out nicely and smell/taste great. I really like the cornmeal for making a crumbly texture.

Very moist with tons of blueberry and corn flavor.  The only thing I didn't like was that they tended to get sticky and wet the longer they sat. Regardless, they were delicious! My 4 year old loved them and has asked me to make them again.

I used half the flour as whole wheat, I substituted all the butter for applesauce, 1 T of vanilla, decreased the sugar and added one zucchini shredded. It worked out great. BUT because the batter was so liquidy I had to add another 1/4 C of cornmeal. Next time Ill put less milk and instead of using 1/4C of whole wheat flour and not cornmeal since it was a little gritty. OVERALL awesome! Plus NO FAT!

Yum!  Used whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of oil.  Delish.  Used fresh blueberries.  If you like blueberry muffins and you like cornmuffins this is a tasty hybrid.

I'm not a fan of white cakey muffins, so I was so pleased with the results using the cornmeal.  It added a flavour, txture and density that made these muffins a hit with my family.  I don't think I'll change anything about the recipe.  Next time, I will cook them in muffin tin without liners as I found it difficult to remove the paper even after they were completely cooled.  I'm thinking it might simply be the nature of cornmeal.  Great!

These were very good. I think a change in proportions could send them over the top. I plan to make them again with a little more milk (they were a tad dry), a little less butter (a touch too greasy, and I don't need the fat) and either more blueberries or more brown sugar to make them sweeter. Still, this is a very tasty recipe. Thanks!

These are very good. I tried to recreate a muffin served by a local coffee shop.  This version hits the spot. I like them because they're not too sweet, and the berries (I used a mix of frozen blueberries, raspberries and blackberries) give it the sweetness it needs. For a touch more sweetness, it would be good to sprinkle coarse sugar over the top before baking.

Simply wonderful!  Loved the cornmeal.  We went with the 3/4 cup suggestion.  No other changes...  It's a keeper for sure!

These were very yummy and dredging the blueberries was definitely needed (which I did).  I also followed the other reviewers' advice to increase the cornmeal to 3/4 of a cup.  

I replaced the wheat flour with a gluten-free mixture and it worked well.  I also used oil instead of the melted butter and I used rice milk instead of cow's milk (which I made into "rice buttermilk" by adding vinegar).  They turned out quite yummy!

I have been baking for 30 years and I thought this recipe was awesome! I did change a few things to make it sugar-free. I omitted the brown sugar and used 1/3 cup of Sue Bee Honey and I teaspoon of Stevia powder. I also used unsalted butter, but added about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also used 1 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries that I had bought fresh at the supermarket and froze myself. The muffins still came out super sweet with a little bit of crunchy sweet edges. They tasted just like they were made with real sugar. The texture was also super nice. We ate them as soon as they came out of the oven, no need to wait for them to cool. They did not need any extra butter to put on them when they were done. You could serve these to royalty! Thanks for the great recipe! P.S. I am sure they are great following the recipe exactly. :-) I came back to say that after reading all the reviews, most of them say the muffins were not sweet enough using the original recipe. My muffins came out perfectly sweet, somewhere inbetween a muffin and a cupcake. The muffins did not grow much either, but they did look appetizing.

I made these recently and they came out great.  I used canola oil and followed the advice to dredge the blueberries.  That worked out very well.  I also added some flax seed too.

I absolutely loved these!  I just finished making them and had two with butter spread on them.  They are definitely a treat, and just the additon of the cornmeal makes for a completely different taste.  I baked them for 18 minutes and let them sit 10, as the directions stated, and they came out perfect!  The only thing I might do differently next time I make them is save 1/4 cup of flour to dredge the berries seperately, and fold them in at the end, because this time all the batter turned blue instead of golden yellow.

Great muffins! I used half spelt flour & half white. I sprinkled a light layer of white sugar on the tops before putting the muffin tin in the oven, and I'm glad I did because it added a nice sweetness to a muffin that isn't overly sweet itself.

It seems to be under baked if you keep them in the oven for only 20 mins.   I kept them in there for an extra 10 mins after I turned off the oven.  They turned out to be delicious, but not the greatest looking muffins....  My husband loves them.  ATE 3 immediately out of the oven!!!

Easy and not bad. I liked the texture that the cornmeal gave. I used frozen blueberries, so my muffins turned a blue-gray color, but I didn't mind. The muffins weren't very sweet, and I haven't yet decided if I like them that way or not. I will probably make these again because the blueberry flavor comes through nicely. I like other readers' ideas of adding orange zest or cinnamon for a multi-dimensional flavor.

It has a nice texture and nice taste which I like the most is the cornmeal sensation inside my mouth. The only changes that I made is that I use dried blueberry instead of frozen & it was gooooood...

An interesting textured change from typical blueberry muffin recipes. I loved the crunch these muffins had right out of the oven. I made this recipe as a side to the lentil-apricot soup also on this website, and it paired nicely. I'll make these muffins again. Thanks!:)

Eh, these were okay but nothing special.  I used closer to  1 1/2 cups blueberries, so my muffins turned purple!  That is not the fault of the recipe, but a warning to anyone else tempted to go nuts with the blueberries.

We loved these muffins.  I added 1/4 cup white sugar because I wasn't sure they'd be sweet enough for company.  They came out terrific, although I probably would stick to the original amount of sugar for myself.  Wonderful recipe.

I used whole wheat flower and added 1/4 cup flaxseed to make it healthier. I also used almond milk instead of regular milk and added fresh corn. Muffins were fluffy and moist. I liked them alot, my boyfriend did not like them because he was expecting them to be sweeter like blueberry Muffins.  Maybe next time I'll add more sugar to appease him, but I like them the way they are

I just ate one of the freshly baked blueberry muffins and, wow!  I closely followed the recipe but replaced the white flour with whole wheat, added a lemon's worth of fresh lemon zest, and added a second cup of blueberries.  Moist and just sweet enough.  The lemon zest did it's job so I highly recommend.  I baked according to the recipe; the muffins were firm to the tough when I took them out of the oven and only slightly darker (burnt umber??) due to the whole wheat flour.

So amazing.  The only change I made was to add some lemon zest but these will be great even without it.  Sweet without going overboard, moist, rich, just perfect when the berries burst in your mouth.  Bake time and temperature were spot on as well.

These were fantastic!  My cornmeal was a medium grind, somewhat coarser than most.  Combined with the brown sugar, the top edge had a nice crispiness.  I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries, and changed 1/4 cup of regular flour to whole wheat (for no particular reason).  I may been a bit generous with the brown sugar.  I ended up leaving the muffins in the oven for an extra 2 minutes.  They were so simple and so delicious!

I'm no professional but I would suggest two changes: 1.) Wait till wet and dry mixtures are combined before add the blueberries.  2.) Make sure both Milk and Butter are warm and soft respectively.  Adding cold milk only produces milky, chunky butter soup.
Maybe that was implied for all you experts but I mindlessly followed the directions without thinking I needed to read between the lines.
I have to admit that even after my little fiasco I baked them and they came out more than reasonably edible.  I'll try this again knowing what not to do.

Good recipe but  a full tablespoon of baking soda makes the muffins far too bitter...I find 1/2 tbsp is more than enough, and they taste delicious...PS..I also use juneberries (aka service berries, Saskatoon berries) when I dont have blueberries..the muffins are just as tasty

I have made this several times.  I use a little less butter and a little less sugar.  I also bake it in a casserole that fits in my counter top oven and then cut it into squares to share or freeze.  A very easy and delicious recipe with ingredients you usually have on hand.

Would definitely make it again. Reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and added 6 oz plain whole yogurt and a splash of vanilla with the eggs. I used frozen blueberries and rolled them in cornstarch before adding them to the batter. Came out fantastic!

These were DELICIOUS. Life did cause me to modify the recipe on the first try: I realized once I'd begun baking that I was out of brown sugar. Instead, I mixed 1/2 cup of white sugar in with the dry ingredients and 1 T molasses in with the wet ingredients. The texture is so good that I'll probably continue to make them this way in the future rather than try out the brown sugar. Also, I did use probably a quarter cup extra blueberries--using up the rest of what I had. The suggested one cup amount is probably just fine for our tastes, though.

Super delicious!  I will make these again.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  I would like a low fat version but these are so good I will make them on occasion.  If you like cornbread, you will like these.

Loved this recipe!  The muffins were moist and delicious.   I added about a cup and a half of fresh Blueberries and a teaspoon of Vanilla extract.   My husband wants me to make another batch!  I will recommend this recipe  to my friends.

These were very comforting and delicious with a cup of tea. I added 1/3 cup crushed walnuts, and used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream for the liquid. As to the frozen blueberries, I tossed them with a shake of cinnamon, a tablespoon of sugar and 2 T flour. I also used half white sugar and half brown for the main dough. Lastly I sprinkled a little sugar on the top. Next time I'll crush some walnuts as well for the topping. The dough will be stiff, so I used a rubber frosting "spatula" so as not to crush the blueberries. Excellent recipe. As you can see I played with it a bit and it was very forgiving : )

This recipe is delicious! As many others have recommended, I increased the amount of blueberries from 1 cup to 1 1/2 cup. I'm so glad I did because it made these muffins extra moist and flavorful!

Loved these, although I have to admit I made a couple of changes. First, I had some leftover buttermilk so I used that and used 1 tsp baking soda to sub for 1 tsp baking powder. Second, I added a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate to the buttermilk which gave the muffins a nice pop of flavor without a strong orange flavor. Loved that these muffins stayed moist while still having plenty of texture. Yum!

I made this with fresh blueberries (a  cup and a half) and increased the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the baking time by 5 minutes. With those changes they were ok. Definitely not too sweet, but not great. I think I'll look for another recipe.

I added about 2 1/2  more tablespoons of brown sugar.  Used corn flour instead of corn meal.  And for the fruit, a handful of blueberries with a ripe smashed banana as well.  I compensated the banana with a little baking soda added.   Don't know why, it just is in my banana bread recipe.   Anyhow, the result was a moist tasty quite nice little muffin.  I used a mini muffin tin. And baked about 12 minutes

Pretty good muffin; I'd never heard of berry-cornmeal as a combination before. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh instead of frozen berries, and I threw in a 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut and 1/4 cup of oats (just clearing out my pantry). The cornmeal I used was a medium grind, so it and the additions gave the muffins a little 'bite'. Maybe not yummy to everyone, but I liked it!

I didn't have a lot of blueberries so I made these as  fruit muffins. I used about 2 cups of mixed berries, otherwise followed recipe. I agree with other reviews, cooking time is off. I had to cook for about 15 extra minutes.

My crew loved them. I used two cups of frozen blueberries, used two eggs instead of one, and lowered the milk to about 7/8 cup because I like a dense,  moist muffin texture. The sugar was dark brown, and I sprinkled a little on the tops before baking. Delicious! I'll be making these again.

Super recipe, great balance of flavors! Also found the cooking time a bit tricky as I like my muffins well browned. Would likely cook at 350 for 15 mins then increase to 375 for 10 minutes. Added a few cranberries and 2 tablespoons honey.

7 15 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/18347/blueberry-cornmeal-muffins / ... Wow.I tried these because I have too many blueberries & "the boy" likes cornbread.I was a little nervous about it being "cornbread with blueberries" - not so interesting - but it isn't "cornbread with blueberries"!It's lighter (cupcake-ish) & yum!I doubled the recipe.I subbed half cup whole wheat flour, since I'm a sneaky mom, & fresh blueberries.Two cups is the perfect amount of blueberries, btw.I reduced the butter to 3/4c without any problems - may even try 2/3c next time.'Think I'll try less sugar, too; but the full amount isn't insane.It's just me, not you.  :D  I was anxious over them being so full, but they didn't overflow or even stick to the pan.How cool is that?!?Thanks, Shelley!Oh, & done in exactly 20 minutes! Yay! ... Three days later:  'Still love 'em & they don't have sticky tops!Woo-hoo! ... Update: For double recipe, reducing butter to 2/3c is fine & reducing sugar to 3/4c is fine, too!  :D  Btw, Ic sugar wasn't too much.Man, they're good!NOTES: 1c frozen berries.Try w 6T ... I used fresh berries & white sugar.After 4 or 5, they started to mold inside.Only make 12.Also, paper bag trick works.The ones left out weren't very wet, but in bag, were better.7.15.15 Addt'l 5 minutes w frozen.'Didn't coat in flour ...

I thought these were fairly straight forward to make and delicious!!! I will try substituting some sugar for applesauce like some other reviewers did.... Very happy as I've been wanting to make blueberry corn muffins for a while now, and happy I have this recipe! You should try them....

I use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. I was also a little more liberal with the blueberries. They were delicious.  Double the recipe or you will regret it...

I don't know what happened.  These came out too dense for me. I 
am not overly fond of cake like muffins but these were too much the
other way.
Don't think I will make these again.

The time is way off on this, which made it a very frustrating recipe. I'm not sure how long I cooked them in the end, but it was far longer than the time in the recipe...

Baking them now, made a few changes, IE Wheat Flour and spices.  The one main thing I want to point out is that when I went to mix the wet ingredients with the dry, my butter had cooled and I had butter solids.  I strained my wet ingredients and remelted the butter.  Anyone who has experienced "Greasy" or "Wet" muffins in the past, this could remedy that.

I substituted frozen cranberries for blueberries.  I added 1/2 cup Splenda, though I think this extra sweetener (or 1/2 cup sugar, whatever you prefer) is needed for this recipe, regardless of whether you use cranberries or blueberries.  Very delicious!

I made these yesterday for about 150 kids where I work. THEY LOVED THEM!!!! I'm never going back to box muffins again. I like the cornmeal, it adds a whole grain. Next time I'm going to try to cut down the sugar and maybe try apples instead of blueberries just to try something new.

I made these with my son and we did one batch with blueberries and one with chopped up fresh strawberries. The strawberry ones were more popular but both were good. I did add more brown sugar 3/4 a cup. I did add a tsp of vanilla to the wet however. I found them a bit crumbly to get out of the pan even when i waited the 10 minutes but i also added more like 2 cups of fruit to each bunch so they were moister. Very good though! and freeze well too!

This was my first time making muffins that didn't come out of a package and it's a real easy recipe and the muffins are awesome. They have a great moist buttery flavor and a nice little crunch from the cornmeal. My husband's really picky when it comes to muffins and he loved these.

These are totally awesome!  I didn't change a single thing in the recipe...no, really! LOL And that's rare for me.  Perfectly light and delicious just as they are.  My husband was very skeptical of corn muffins with his favorite fruit in them but I immediately had to make a second batch (originally only made 12.)  Do make these!  You'll love them! :D

On edit: I did change one tiny thing. I forgot until I went to make the second batch. I swapped out 1 cup of whole fat plain yogurt for the milk and added 2 TBS. milk to moisten up just a tad more.

Quite a good little recipe! Some quick mods I've developed over the 5 or so times I've made these:...

1)used buttermilk instead of plain milk...
2)reduce butter by 1/3...
3)in additon to blueberries, I added chopped frozen raspberries...
4)used whole wheat for half of the flour...

They always turn out perfectly!

Excellent. I started the recipe and realized, I had no milk in the fridge. I remembered I had powdered buttermilk and used it adding  4tbsp of it to the dry ingredients and 1 cup of water to the wet ingredients . I used frozen blueberries in this recipe. Before I added the wet ingredients to the dry. I took about 1/2 cup of the dry ingredients and used them to 'flour' the frozen blueberries. I added the 'floured blueberries as the last ingredient and just folded them in.  They held their shape nicely. I put this in a 12x7 pan and baked. These didn't stay around long. I will make these again and again. Note: I have made these several times and everyone gobbles them up. Just before the holidays I made these using white cornmeal they tasted just as good bu esthetically they were not as pleasing to the eye. I'll stick with yellow cornmeal.

These are SO good, I would shout it from the rooftops! I made 6 jumbo muffins and the only changes I made were to increase the amount of cornmeal to 3/4 cup, use low fat buttermilk instead of milk and margarine for butter.  Because of the size of the muffin pan, I baked for 25 minutes.  They look like those huge muffins you get at the bakery. Mmm... perfection!

I'm not really sure what to think of theese muffins. They do taste pretty good. I think next time I will not put the blueberries in until I've allready mixed the wet and dry ingridients. My muffins looked kind of blue. Also, 1 cupof blueberries was too much for me in this particular recipy.  I might try them again with a few changes.

These turned out so good...we couldn't wait the whole 10 minutes to let them cool in the pan, we lasted 8 and then dug in. I used fresh blueberries, something I've never bought or cooked with until today, and I'm a novice muffin maker too...I can't wait to make these again, they are so good. They are pretty too, so I took a few pictures! My boyfriend gave these a 10 out of 5, he said they were that good.

Served these at a meeting and got rave reviews!  I thought the cornmeal added a nice crunch to the muffins that regular blueberry muffins lacks.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect!  I used soy milk, a little extra flour and sugar, two cups of blueberries and cooked them about five minutes longer.  These are so good and the texture is just perfect!

Tasty muffins, the cornmeal made a really nice change to the traditional blueberry muffins everyone was used to.

These are yummy.  We like the crunch of the cornmeal.  They are a little hard to get out of the pan, though, so next time I'll increase the flour by just a little bit - maybe to 1 1/2 cups.  Other than that, they are very good, and I'l probably make them often.
