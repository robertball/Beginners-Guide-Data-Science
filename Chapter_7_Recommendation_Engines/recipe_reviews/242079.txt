As written, this needs some help.  It is very mild and that is OK but without the addition of some water or broth, it is like taco seasoned Sloppy Joes, not soup.  I added water but wish I had used broth, instead.  I did saute an onion with the ground beef, wish I had added garlic too. 
I missed having other veggies, carrots, cabbage, peppers, zucchini.

I add about 1/2 yellow onion finely chopped to the ground beef and drain off the grease when meat is browned. Then add in your taco seasoning and ranch dressing and coat the meat (stirring until the meat is well coated.) . I also use 2 cans of white shoe-peg corn (not drained) instead of 1 can whole kernel corn. I also do not drain my pintos or dark red kidney beans. I do however add one can of black beans, drained and rinsed. When cooked, top with shredded cheese, chives , sour cream (if you like it) and eat with your favorite chips, crackers, or cornbread. Mmm! Sooo good!

Excellent mild soup. I make a version that adds green Chile's and rotel tomatoes. I like a Spicer soup. This is also fantastic made with chicken and as many types of beans that you may want to use.

EXCELLENT!!! It  sounded strange to add the ranch dressing mix so I made one batch without the ranch dressing mix and one batch with....recipe is better as written WITH the ranch dressing mix. It needs all those seasonings in that ranch dressing mix, its way too bland without. Garnished it with Mexican cheese, a dollop of sour cream, sliced avacado & a sprinkle of slivered green onions, very eye appealing. Easy recipe that everyone enjoyed and asked for  seconds!

I make a similar soup, but I use yellow hominey instead of corn. I love it. I really need to make some and can it. I have added a can of Ro-tel tomatoes to make it spicier. I do add a bit of water to mine, just enough to make it soupy.

Love it.  I just added two cans of beer, one  jalape√±o, one  Anaheim pepper,  minced garlic , and one lager red  onion.  And of corse salted and peppered.  Will make all the time with two pounds of ground beef for a little extra protein.

I made this soup with the following modifications: 2 cans petite diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes. After mixing all ingredients, the soup looked like it would be too thick so I added a cup of tomato soup and a can of beer. Since I have never added beer to soups or anything else I have made before, I was a bit nervous. The flavor and the consistency were great! This would be very good with tortilla chips and chopped green onions. I would definitely do it again!

We love it. My grandson adds sour cream and crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese on top of his and sometimes I join in with a spoonful of salsa.

My own recipe is better. This was way too mild for me and lacked the intricate blend of cumin, mild and hot chili powders, and rotisserie chicken. Sorry :(

Instead of canned tomatoes I used 1/2 jar pasta sauce. I also used about a cup of beef bouillon instead of water. The soup turned out great!

This recipe is great as it produced a thick and hearty taco soup. I did not make any changes to it this time; however, next time, I plan to add 1/2 cup of water and change to diced tomatoes. I may even use spicy taco seasoning, but I will be careful with too many changes! My family and I loved it!

If you follow the directions to  "T", it will be more like a sloppy joe.  I ended up adding 3 cups of water and another package of taco seasoning.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use diced tomatoes, not whole.

pleasantly surprised at how tasty this was! I followed the recipe mostly except I used ground turkey and frozen corn. I didn't find I had to add any water like some others and thought the consistency was just right!  Will make again for sure!

I thought it tasted really good and was very easy to make. I did not drain the beans but did add a can of drained black beans and I added 1 1/2 packets of taco seasoning versus one. I would recommend this for a tasty simple dish!

this is a chili.  you'll want to add a couple of cups of low sodium beef broth if you want this to have anything to it.  
I immediately noticed this recipe would be very mild in flavor so I sauteed half an onion and 2 cloves of garlic with the meat.  
the rest of the recipe was cooked as written. I added another half pack of taco seasoning since I added beef broth and the flavor popped decently.   I made this for my office soup contest so I'm prepared to get told I made chili all day. I have named my dish 'not chili'.

We found that the basic recipe without the added ranch mix was delicious. It was plenty salty at that point. 
We added sour cream, scallions and a Mexican cheese blend for the finishing touches. I would make it again.
Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tasty and so easy to make.  Next time I will used diced tomatoes and add some beef or chicken broth as mine was a little to thick for a soup.

It is super quick to make and very tasty! I used diced canned tomatoes and added an extra to make it more of a soup. Made it twice, second time switched  to Italian sausages because that‚Äôs what was in the freezer and it worked beautifully! 
In the words of Michael Smith (Executive Chef); ‚ÄúA recipe is merely a guideline what you do with it is entirely up to you!‚Äù
Will be one of our go-to‚Äòs on cold/rainy busy days!!

I made this about 2 weeks ago.  What an easy recipe! I read the reviews and based on them added Rotel tomatoes,  diced onion, shoe peg corn and a can of IPA beer - my hubby is still raving about it! There‚Äôs only the 2 of us, so we had enough to freeze in 2, quart containers - but there‚Äôs only one left.  Will definitely be making it again and again, and for our next ‚Äòsoup night‚Äô Church fundraiser as well. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made a version of this for many years. My  family loves this. Very easy to double and triple this recipe.  Makes wonderful leftovers. 
 I use low sodium   Still very good.
I add black beans, chili beans  and great northern beans  And some tomato juice. Rotel  or salsa is with it good too. We serve with cheese and sour cream

Next time I think I will use diced or stewed tomatoes rather than the whole tomatoes for better consistency.  I did turn up the Crock Pot to High after 1 1/2 hrs and cooked for another 2 hours on High because I like my soups warmer. Delicious!!!

Very good for a mostly ‚Äúopen cans and dump‚Äù recipe! I did it on stove top using cans of crushed rotel  tomatoes (hot) which did not allow whole tomatoes to cook down into broth, so I did have to add a couple cans of chicken broth. I drained the hamburger grease before adding all the goodies. Substituted black beans for kidney beans and used shoepeg can of corn. The taco seasoning (hot) and ranch packets had all the spices I needed since I used spicy tomatoes. This was quick and easy and you control the spice level by the variety of the ingredients listed that you choose to use. I would have never thought to add peered ranch seasoning, but it was very tasty!

I went with what we had in the pantry and freezer. One can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and one chopped fresh tomato. No kidney beans, just the Pintos. I did add 1/2 sweet onion, garlic, a 7 ounce can of diced mild chilis, and a cup of rice. I only used 1/2 the dressing mix as the first 2 ingredients were salt and MSG. I had salted the meat and onions as they cooked. A habit of mine.

Served with tortilla strips, cilantro, chopped scallions, sour cream, and shredded Mexican blend cheese. Pretty tasty and will make again.

Really easy to make and very tasty. I am definitely  going to add this to my repertoire. I made enough for 8 servings and froze some of it. It thaws out really well and is great  for packing for lunch at work.

Pretty good base recipe. I took the advice of others and added a can of black beans, a bottle of beer and a cut up zucchini. It was more of a chili than a soup.

Super easy soup. It reminded me a bit of picadillo, even though the recipe calls for traditionally American flavors. 

I did change it a bit and wish I would have done a couple of things. 

Instead of one can of tomatoes, I used two. I would recommend diced instead of whole, or blend then a bit before adding them to the slow cooker. This will require a bit more ranch dressing seasoning, but not much more. 

Next time I'm adding carrots, maybe Mexican squash, and onions. Not spicy at all, so I will also add a serrano chile to the mix.

As written, I think this would be more of a chili than soup. I added 2 cups of water, tomato paste, and an extra packet of taco seasoning, along with a few tablespoons of chili powder (to my taste) to make it a little more soup-like. I also sauteed an onion and bellpepper I had on hand threw those in as well. It came out really well and I will probably make again. I might try a mix of water and broth next time for my liquid, but definitely recommend adding some liquid to this if you are looking for a soup and not chili.

Didn't have time for the slow cooker, but it was fine on the stove top.  I made it by the recipe, except added more water because I was feeding 5.  We all had seconds, and there was only a small dessert bowl left!  I can see lots of ways to change it up a little according to what is in the pantry and what meat is available.  The ranch dressing mix makes all the difference.

I lost count of the number of times my husband told me this was one of the best things I‚Äôve ever made. We ate every last drop. Speaking of drops, I have to concur with the first comment. I added chicken broth, garlic powder and minced onion and it was just super!  And SO easy!!

Saw this & thought I‚Äôd try it. I had almost everything in my pantry. I didn‚Äôt have ground beef, but I had a nice chunk of left over pork roast, so I diced it up! I had white beans & black beans & everything else. I put it into the crockpot & left it on low for 5hrs. Didn‚Äôt need to adjust the seasoning & it is delish! I used tortilla chips since that was what I had.  So easy! Hubs said it‚Äôs a keeper.

I had to use what I had.. saut√©ed a large onion with beef chorizo. I only had half a package of ranch and half a chili packet. Everything else listed I had and used.
 so, yummy for a last minute soup.
It came out more like chili but the family loved it.
 I topped with crushed Fritos, sour cream ,and cheddar cheese.

The only change I made to this recipe was adding sauted onion.  A note about the amount of liquid. I noticed the recipe didn't say drain the corn so I didn't. This made the amount of liquid perfect, imo. My husband said, "Don't lose this recipe."

This recipe was very good as is, but I wanted a little more zip so I added an onion, teaspoon minced garlic, and a can of rotel tomatoes with habeneros. Outstanding!

We really enjoyed it. Only change was adding two cups of water. Since cooks 3 hours makes it more soupy or chili consistencyz if you want more spice, get your taco seasoning in spicy or hot. But we loved it this way. Hubby and two girls age 8 and 9 plus myself. Loved it and very easy!

I make this taco soup about twice a month in cold weather.  If it gets too thick, add a little water, if you like it spicier,  add Rotel tomatoes and a small can of green chilis.    We love it.  Serve it with sour cream, shredded cheddar,   chopped chives.
