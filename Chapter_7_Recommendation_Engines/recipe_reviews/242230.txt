Fast and good - if you want to kick it up a notch throw in a few dashes of worcestershire and top it off with green onions and chedder

I enjoyed this but I made a lot of adjustments. I used a shallot instead of garlic, added Worcestershire as others suggested, I used a full cup of plain fat free Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and then added an additional can of salmon. I topped it off with capers. Tastes very good with cucumber slices!

I bought a 1/2 of a salmon, seasoned it with old bay, dill & pepper. I put it in the oven on 350 for 25 mins to stiffen it. I allowed it to cool & added the sour cream with chives, chopped up some shallots & seasoned it again with dill, old bay & added parsley OMG AMAZING

I made this with yogurt as a substitute for sour cream.  Very bland.  Doctored it up with scallions,  Worcester sauce, and more dill .  Needs something  else, still bland.

I make almost this exact recipe but use basil instead of garlic - what's missing may be CURRY -you could try a little ad see, I can't stop eating it.  It's a good basic recipe.

Tasty option for steamed salmon. I used my IP to steam (5 min manual with quick release) frozen salmon from our summer catch. Had to remove skin and some bones. But this was a nice change from our regular baked salmon recipe.

My husband and daughter loved it. I did however use minced garlic in a squeeze container instead of cloves.

I added smoked paprika, and substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Also I used fresh herbs, instead of dried. It turned out great!

The reviews told me that it could be bland and I did have to add some horseradish to perk it up . I did not use canned salmon I broiled my salmon filets with a ginger , teriyaki and butter glaze which went over very well with the Super Bowl bingers !

Great recipe but as others stated, it needed a little something else.  I added a teaspoon of "smoke flavoring" and a some minced onion to taste and it was fabulous!  Can't stay out of it!

Made this dip following the recipe exactly. It was good - and a big hit at the party. But it needs a little something to make it a 5-star recipe. Just not sure what...

I recently made this dip to eat while I watched a football game. The dip was good but I felt that something was missing. Unfortunately I can't figure out what needs to be added.

This addictive salmon dip is easy to mix together for a quick appetizer. Serve on Triscuits and sprinkle dried dill on top.
