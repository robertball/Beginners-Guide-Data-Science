Incredible! I made this dish last night for my girlfriend who described it as orgasmic after only the first mouthful! I essentially followed the recipe, but altered it slightly as per one previous reviewer. I sauteed swiss brown mushrooms in butter and olive oil then flamed them with a dash of brandy. Also added a teaspoon of garlic to the shallots and champagne. I used drained plum tomatoes instead of fresh, and added all the cream to the tomato sauce. I used a good champagne and it was worth the expense. Overall, probably the best pasta I have ever eaten, and I have eaten in michelin starred restaurants in Italy. The flavours are subtle, and the recipe does NOT need the garlic unless you definitely must have it. Not sure what difference using fresh tomatoes would make, but the drained canned tomatoes did not detract from the dish in my opinion. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of keepers. Outstanding.

This was an incredible recipe but I did make just a few changes. First, I added 1/2 of a medium onion instead of shallots and I added 3 cloves of garlic for extra flavor. I cooked the onions, garlic, and mushrooms together in the olive oil also with a few tablespoons of butter and then followed the directions for the rest of the recipe. I will surely be making this recipe again and again... it was excellent!

I made this for new year's eve and it was the BEST dish I have ever made!!  Definitely restaurant quality!!  I did make a few changes...I used 1/2 lb. of shrimp & 1/2 lb. scallops, linguine rather than angel hair, baby bella mushrooms and grape tomatoes.  I used a really dry champagne (Freixenet Brut), which I think is important.  I don't think the sauce would turn out very well if you used a sweet champagne.  The flavor concentrates when you're cooking with alcohol, so you want to use a champagne you would drink from the glass.  Since I used a dry champagne, the grape tomatoes gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  I think next time I will add some lump crabmeat.  YUM!!  Can't wait to make this for company.  We'll be making this for many years to come!

I made this recipe exactly as specified, and it will definitely be something I will use as a standby when I'm looking to impress.  Not only were the flavors unbelievable, but the recipe itself is well-written and easy to follow.  Great for a romantic dinner.
***Just a follow-up: I tried to double this recipe and it ended up taking a LOT longer to reduce the sauce.  Add extra time if you plan to do this.

This recipe was so yummy and rich with flavor.  My husband said it tasted as good as Red Lobster.  I cooked the mushrooms in butter and wine instead of oil for about 5 minutes then I added some Brandy and let her fire up to get the mushroomy taste out.  When I cooked the tomatoes and minced shallots I mixed in about two little spoons of minced garlic.  I thought it would appear too Garlicy, but it was fine.  Instead of Champagne, I used a nice Chardonnay that really  complimented the dish and added a dash of a sweet white wine but not much.  Hubby doesn't like sweet stuff.  I cooked the shallots, Garlic and Tomatoes about 12 minutes instead of 8.  It seemed to come out really thick and not thin like everyone else said.  Instead of plum tomatoes I bought a can of diced tomatoes and used about 3/4 of the can and it still came out beautifully.  At the end I used all of the cream on the stove together.  I didn't put any cream on the pasta before hand.  I also used Basil instead of Parsley.  Thanks Tricia Flasck, for the beautiful elegant dinner.  It is all well worth making.

Wow.  Great stuff - and this relatively new cook was kept on his toes, especially since there was  Ali's Amazing Bruschetta (also available on this website) to time out as well.  I recommend you read the recipe a couple of times before beginning.  There are a couple of critical junctures where one must be absolutely ready to move to the next step.  Have your ingredients measured and waiting in the wings.  Then like me, you won't frantically be running your finger up and down the ingredient list looking for the right amount of this or that!  Sheesh, it was all worth it because the recipe was exceptional, but man oh man - it sure became hectic a couple of times.  My wife and son both loved it.  My son said it was one of the best meals I have ever made (I chose to take that as a compliment)!

What a delicious and different way to make shrimp.
impressive for guests... I didn't have any champagne on hand, so I substituted with white wine, but lessened the quantity to 1/2 - 3-4 cups since wine and especially homemade wine is stronger. I also like to let it simmer on the lowest setting for about 10-15 minutes to combine all the wonderful tastes.

Very, very good.  I used an extra dry brut champagne, and it's still on the sweet side (which my bf and I liked but maybe others might not).  Made the recipe as written, and I have the following comments: 1.) Try it once without garlic before adding the 1, 2, or 3 cloves that some have suggested.  I thought the shallots added ample but subtle flavor to the rather delicate sauce.  If you can't get shallots, THEN I think some finely minced sweet onion and a couple of garlic cloves would be an acceptable substitute. 2.) You don't want the shrimp to be fully cooked when you pull them out of the champagne in step 3 - they'll keep cooking as they rest, and they'll cook even more when you throw them back in the hot sauce...they don't take much!  Mine were pink on the edges but not totally opaque when I took them out, and they were definitely done by the time we sat down to eat. 3.) I used fresh angel hair pasta (refrigerated section of grocery store), and we really liked the lighter, softer consistency of the pasta with the sauce.  It also seemed like the fresh pasta held onto the sauce better than dried pasta might.  Plus, fresh only takes about 60 seconds to cook, so it made it very easy to plate everything at once when the sauce was done.

This is a superb recipe.  I used Brut champagne, doubled the mushrooms and added some minced garlic.  One of the best shrimp dishes I have made at home!

Really good. Nice fresh flavors with a hint of sweetness (probably from the tomatoes and champagne) and herbs. I did add a bit of minced garlic and crushed red peppers to the pan with the mushrooms to enhance the flavor, because my family loves robust and spicy flavors. This was good. I think next time I will try it with chicken.

Sauce just never came together for me on this one -- I thought boiling champagne and cream seemed like a bad idea, as the golden rule of cooking with cream is generally not to boil it - especially in conjunction with a thinner liquid - and it was,... perhaps I should have reduced the champagne further as the sauce just broke apart.

It's crazy how good this is- it reminds me of bisque meets pasta. I made mine without mushrooms, because that's how I've had it 4 other times :) Since I didn't use the mushrooms, I left out the olive oil too. I also subbed dried parsley for the fresh. Totally amazing. Restaurant quality and very impressive for company. Worth every calorie- don't try to cut them!!

Incredible!! This was absolutely amazing. I made this for me and my husbands "date night" at home, and I couldn't have picked a better meal. I used a brut champagne for my dish, which is the least sweet of the champagnes, and for me it was absolutely perfect. My husband was going on and on about how great it was. I served this with a spinach salad, and we drank the rest of the champagne with the meal(bonus!)  Definitely a keeper!

This was amazing!  I made this for my anniversary and it was so elegant, but not hard to make, and so delicious!  I used small shrimp because it didnt have the tail still on it.  It did have a lot of shrimp though, by using a pound.  When I make this again, (which I will!) I will probably double all the other ingredients but only use a pound of shrimp.  I made this with a Double Tomato Bruschetta recipe I also found on here, and drank Moscata wine with it.

I have never written a review before, but after making this for dinner tonight, I was moved to write a review. I prepared the dish as written (with the exception of mushrooms since I didn't have any) and it was absolutely tasty. Thanks for sharing such a great simple but very delicious recipe.

This is very good and the consistency was good. My husband thought it is definately restaurant quality. I liked it, but it a mild dish....not bursting with flavor. I used the cheapest champagne I could find, Brut for 5.99, and it was great. I will probably make this again, and maybe add some garlic and serve asparagus on the side.

Loved it! I did add a bit of flour to thicken the sauce at the end and some "old bay seasoning" when I added the champagne but this recipe was right on the money and worth taking the time to prepare as it was a wonderful meal for my family. Thank you for being so kind as to share it.

YUM! I don't usually eat shrimp- I got small frozen ones, but this was great. My boyfriend was raving about it after the 1st bite and said "Baby, this is really good- seriously. You HAVE to make this again!" I also used dried herbs & seasoning. Also, I thought it was just fine with the $5 bottle of champange!!

This recipe was incredible. I made it wondering what it would taste like with the champage. I added fresh garlic and fresh basil.  People raved about this at work. Highly recommend if you want to impress someone.

This is better than good. I bought cheap champagne 'cause all champagne tastes raunchy to me; stumbled through the 2 cups heavy cream called for in the ingredients list with recipe instructions for only 1 cup (used both cups and thickened the sauce so the shrimp weren't overdone);  served it up to babies and grandpas and everyone in between.  This is one keeper of a recipe!  By the way.. it has a lovely presentation.. so is great for company. Thanks! Oh yeah.. something else:  I was at the grocery store buying the ingredients at 5:30pm (after long day at work), got home at 6:00pm, had dinner on the table by 6:45pm. Easy.. and fast!

This was great! I doubled everything except the shrimp for a friends-dropped-in dinner, and it was the perfect quanity for six. I put the shrimp in the champagne while I chopped everything else, and the bubbles brought stray pieces of shell & tail to the top, so I could pick them out easily. I used grape tomatoes and added some ground white pepper towards the end. Very elegant and tasty!

This is restaraunt quality. Want to impress dinner guests? This is the recipe. I did change a few things by adding fresh spinach to the pasta and parsley when I tossed it with the cream. I also added artichoke hearts when I added the shrimp back to the sauce and thickened the sauce slightly with corn starch. MY boyfriend could not stop eating it. We literally licked the sauce out of the pan! This is one of the best recipes I have ever made in my kitchen! I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is excellent as is, but I think I'll take some of the others advice the next time I make it.  Definitely double the sauce, mushrooms and tomatoes.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic while cooking mushrooms which added flavor.  To cut down on the 'sweetness' described by some others, I used a dry white wine.  The finished product was amazing.  Can't wait to make it again!!!

WONDERFUL DISH!  Made this last night and realized I didn't have heavy cream.  I used fat free half & half (all I had on hand) and expected it to hurt the taste of this dish - but it was amazing!  This is definitely a rich and elegant dish that perfectly complements shrimp and pasta!  Thank you!

This is the best thing i have ever cooked. I did take the advice of the other raters and cooked the mushrooms in butter and then fire them with brandy. I used a dry champagne and grape tomatoes. I added a little garlic, but i don't think i will next time. Also i accidently put the whole cup of heavy cream in. It didn't ruin it but next time i will make sure to have it measured out into 1/4 cup and 3/4 cups.  

Overall this recipe rocks.

Well, this is ust ridiculous.  Aside from leaving out mushrooms and using pappardelle pasta, I made as is.  There is no need to modify this recipe because it is *perfect*, and surprisingly simple to make.

Fantastic.  I did a few more mushrooms, and my shrimp was frozen... so there was probably a bit more juice than others... but extremely tasty!!!  LOVE IT!

My husband and I have made this dish twice now and have loved it every time.  This recipe is our "overnight getaway from the kids" treat!  The first time, our store was out of shallots so we used green onions.  The second time, we made it exactly according to the recipe.  Prefer with shallots, but onion works in a pinch.  We prefer a sweeter champagne to drink and since this recipe leaves at least two or more glasses in the bottle, that's what we use.  Gives the pasta dish a rather sweet taste, yet we really enjoy it.  While he does the cooking, I'm in charge of all the chopping.  Last time, we had leftovers and ate them the next night with grilled steak and green salad.  Couldn't have had a better meal at a restaurant!

This is such an easy recipe that tastes like I've slaved over it for hours. Very impressive dish. It's a great recipe as written, but I tend to make the following changes: I usually use dry white wine instead of champagne, double the mushrooms, and substitute fresh basil for the parsley. It's also great with scallops instead of or in addition to the shrimp.

VERY Good! I used both shrimp and scallops and I also added in fresh garlic clooves crushed while I was cooking the mushrooms. I really enjoyed this dish and my husband says a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is amazing, I made it for my husband and myself and I couldn't fault it or add anything to it to make it any better it was perfect.  I am thinking of trying it with chicken next time as Shrimp is so expensive in the uk.  AMAZING!  I might make it again tonight! x

Mixed this up a bit to make more budget-friendly -- I used penne instead of angel hair, no mushrooms, canned tomatoes instead of fresh, garlic instead of shallots, and subbed chardonnay for champagne.  Used ~1/2 c cream, 1/2 c chicken stock mix.

Delicious, delicious, delicious.

What a terrific quick, elegant meal for unexpected company.  Just a few ingredients, just a half hour, and WOW!  I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested having ingredients measured and ready to go before starting.  Once the sauce starts to thicken, things happen quickly.  I also added some parmesan reggiano to the cream sauce while thickening.  Canned diced tomatoes work great, and don't skimp on the fresh parsley.  Two thumbs up!

Hmmmm.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added some garlic, substituted a nice dry white wine for the champagne and "customized" it for 8 people.  I thought it was bland and kind of sweet but bitter tasting.  The sauce has virtually no seasoning, and it really needs some!  Sorry.

Awesome! So much so we are making it twice the one week LOL! I added garlic to the shallots and some red bell pepper very finely chopped. I used regular old Brut champagne and good Al Dente fettucine. My husband loved it! Making it again tonight and just came on to print out the recipe ;)

Just made this for my wife and I.  We both enjoyed it but agreed it lacked something.  I cooked it exactly as the directions stated (minus the mushrooms because what I thought I had on hand had browned too much)
I will defiantly be making this agin but intend to add red pepper flakes to help offset the sweetness.  I'm wondering if a salty meat like bacon or prosciutto would compliment the shrimp and sauce??

This dish is incredible!  The only differences was that I used linguini instead of angel hair, and I just eyeballed the ingredients as opposed to measuring them out.  I used a cheap, Brut champagne and it turned out fantastic.  Instead of pouring the shrimp and sauce over the pasta, I tossed it all together.  This is definitely one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I'll be making this tonight for my parents and grandmother and plan to "Wow" them with this one!

The sauce looks a bit thin, even after reduced, but when added to the noodles gets absorbed really well. I love this recipe!

Wonderful flavor!  My dish turned out "soupy" and it was still liquidy after adding some cornstarch.  I could see where the leftovers firmed up well.  Can't wait to eat them.  We just don't like soupy sauces!!  Flavor = restaurant quality = company dish.  Thanks.

Delicious! I cut this in half to make a special dinner for two, and I used scallops instead of shrimp. I also subbed basil for the parsley, I just had some on hand. I will definitely make this again, next time I will try it with the shrimp, and it would be great with tender strips of chicken too. I may experiment with using a little garlic, just to see how that tastes, but the recipe is great without it too.

This was good. I usually cook from the hip throwing stuff together out of the fridge and season with whatever my mouth tells me to. I followed the recipe to the T on this bc it was for Valentines dinner and I didnt want to take any chances. My advice would be to saute atleast 1 whole shallot and some chopped garlic cloves as well for some more flavor. The sauce had great consistency but just lacked overall flavor.

My husband and I are pasta fanatics and this is by far one of the best pastas we have ever eaten.  The taste is like nothing you would ever expect, but it is delicious.  Typically I modify recipes to our spicy taste needs, but the only thing I did different was that I used both shrimp and scallops.  I would recommend or serve this to anyone!

Great, quick, and simple.  Pefrect middle of the week date meal.  To make lower in fat, I used Land O'Lakes fat-free half-n-half instead of heavy cream.  If you can find shallots - use them, I believe they add a depth in flavor that no other onion could match as well.

Super yummy! Made a few minor changes. Added 1tbsn of butter to the mushroom sauté and 2 cloves minced garlic at the end. Used 1/4 diced onion as I didn't have shallot and a can of diced tomatos as I had them on hand. A couple shakes of red pepper flakes to the tomato reduction which took about 15 mins to reduce and, viola, delicious simple quick dinner with a couple of glasses of champagne to enjoy! Thank you TKF!

This was super good!  I used Asti as well and it was sweet, but not too sweet.  I threw in a yellow pepper bc I was out of mushrooms, turned out good.  Personal taste- I do not think there is enough tomatoes, I added an entire can of diced tomatoes, and I would also add more shallots next time.  (I chopped three small ones for this)  It took about10-15 minutes for the champagne to reduce to half a cup.  I also threw in a small can of crab meat bc I had that on hand too.  Definitely will be making this again.

I'm sorry, but I did not like this. I bought a brut champagne thinking it would be dry/non-sweet enough but still, the finished sauce tasted bland and sweet. It was awful. I did so much doctoring to make this edible, I would not use champagne again - I would use a white wine, but then it would be another recipe. Thanks anyway.

This was unbelieveable. I didn't have champagne so I used a white wine, I added a little minced garlic and some seafood seasoning. The sauce didn't seem to thicken up enough and I was afraid to keep boiling it with the cream so I added a little cornstarch and more cream. It thickened up alot then. I think I will double the wine and cream next time, but it was to die for, I had my hubby help and it was pretty easy with twp extra hands!!

A very elegant dish. It is important to cook the champagne down as instructed so the cream sauce is thick enough. I doubled the recipe and it was just perfect for three people. We like our pasta!!!!!!!!

Let me first start by saying this recipe is fabulous.  My husband and I loved the flavor of this dish.  I doubled the champagne and heavy cream which was my first mistake.  I was running late and did not read the reviews of how you need to boil the champagne longer than the recipe states so my sauce was too thin for our liking, but I cannot lower the rating because of my mistake.  I will make again, but will boil the champagne longer to make the sauce thicker.  Great recipe.

My husband LOVED this.  He said it was "out of this world".  Which is quite a statement coming from him.  I made it with scallops instead of shrimp, which are his favorite, so that had a little to do with it, but I loved it too.  I had to cook the scallops a little longer than it says to cook the shrimp--about 3 minutes.  And I have to admit, I made it with white wine instead of champagne, so it was just a little different than the original recipe, but you could get the general idea of how good the recipe was from the way we had it.  Might try it with champagne sometime, but was really good with the wine too.  This would be a good company dish.  The only problem might be getting all the last minute things done right before serving--would have to plan your time and have all ingredients ready to go.  Loved this dish!!.

After reading the reviews I really thought this would be out of this world, however, it was a little disappointing.  The dish lacks flavor and the next time I would add fresh basil at the end.  A good white wine would also add more flavor instead of the champagne.

This recipe is delightful. One time I served it for guests who don't eat seafood so I substituted the shrimp for chicken and it work fine.  The sauce is surprisingly flavorful. We especially enjoyed drinking the champagne not needed for the sauce.

This turned out very good.  I followed the recipie pretty much to the letter with the exception of adding about twice as much mushroom than it called for and a little more shrimp than it called for.  Oh, and I left out the scallion as the boyfriend does not like them.  And added garlic as we're nuts about some garlic!  It passed the boyfriend test - when I asked him if it was one to make again he shook his head yes while scooping more mouthfulls out of his plate.  It also passed the son test - he thought he wouldn't like it but ended up asking me for seconds.    All in all a very good dish and one I'd definately make again.

I made this recipe last night for a special Valentine's Day dinner for my family and it was a huge hit. Our 11-year old who normally doesn't much care for mushrooms, loved them in this very simple sauce. The only changes I made were to double it for my five hearty eaters, use a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh and finely chopped minced sweet onion instead of shallots.  I was going for cheaper because even without the shallots, it's a pricier (~$25 for the doubled version) recipe then our normal fair, but that is of course a steal compared to eating out.

Fantastic!! I used shrimp and scallops as well as an entire box of pasta. Canned tomatoes worked just fine. I also threw in a little emrils seasoning. It gave it a little spiciness. Delicious!

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day.  The sauce is really exceptional, thankfully based on previous reviews I made extra sauce. Keeping in mind the reviewer suggestions, adding garlic and cooking garlic, mushrooms and shallots together was a success also.  My husband loved it so much he has asked me to make it gain this week only without the pasta.  Since he does not care for pasta I have enough pasta left for when I make the shrimp and sauce for him.  This one is a keeper.

This was very good! Like allot of other reviewers here feel, it does taste like restaurant quality. I too, used canned, diced tomatoes vs fresh Roma's and it was excellent! For those having a problem with reducing... you MUST boil at high heat, stirring often. It will reduce nicely, but does take more than 8 min. Takes about 15 - 20 min. VERY HAPPY WITH RECIPE! Thanks!

This was awesome! My boyfriend (who hates pasta dishes) loved this. I added fresh basil as well as scallops. I also used canned minced tomatoes and lots of garlic. Since we didn't have any shallots I just used some garlic. I bet it would be amazing as leftovers, but I won't know since my boyfriend took all the leftovers to work today. I will make this again and again!    The only down side is the cost of seafood.

This is one of the best meals I have EVER made! My husband was SUPER impressed and is already asking me when I'm going to make it again. I used 1.5lbs of shrimp to give it some more protein. Also, I didn't have enough shallots, so I subed 3 fresh garlic cloves for my missing 1T of shallots that I lacked. All in all it was FANTASTIC!!!!

This recipe is absolutely a fantastic recipe if you want an easy, yet elegant meal that tastes AWESOME! The best part is that its versatile as you can add scallops, crabmeat, clams etc.  This recipes tastes like it came from a restaraunt and is good enough to save for special occasions!

This recipe was truly amazing! I thought other reviewers may have been exaggerating a bit with their praises, but I was wrong. I didn't need to change much from the original recipe, I just added one clove of garlic with the shallots and tomato. The finished product reminded me of a cross between pasta ala vodka and pasta carbonara.  I can't rave enough about this find!  So delicious, I'll make it for company.

This was fantastic. I used canned diced tomatoes and canned mushrooms since its what I had on hand. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and had a bit of a problem getting it to thicken properly so I added a bit of cornstarch with water to thicken it. My oldest asked me to make it every day and gave it "eighteen hundred stars"

Absolutely delicious recipe! I changed up the vegetables to adjust for what I had...I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, and I added spinach and broccoli in place of the shallots and mushrooms. The sauce is amazing...I'll definitely have to consider cooking with champagne again!

I had some (freezer burned) shrimp that I wanted to use, and even with that it was excellent! Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly; this time I sub'd canned mushrooms, didn't have any shallots - and it was STILL great! I had grape tomatoes, and didn't cut them before cooking.  Cutting adds a LOT of flavor.

I had high expectations for this recipe after seeing the rating... and it lived up to every one of them!!!  I added some garlic as DUDLEBUG02 suggested and added some pepper too.  I am definitely going to make this again.

This dish was very good, although it took me a lot longer than the quoted time.  I think I rushed the sauce, so it wasn't very thick, but it made it seem lighter.  I will make it again, but I will add some Cajun Bayou Seasoning for extra flavor.  By the way, I used the bi-color fettucine instead of angel hair and it was good.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars.  I husband raved about it, he LOVED it.  I really liked it too.  I only was expecting it to be a little creamier, mine seemed too dry.  I seemed to have way too much pasta.  I measured the dry pasta out on my scale, but after it was cooked up, it was too much for just four people.  If I would have bought more cream, it would have turned out perfect.  I taste was wonderful.  I used Kendall Jackson chardonnay instead of champagne...I will definitely use less pasta and a bit more cream next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for our Valentine's Day dinner and it turned out PHENOMENAL! If you are considering making this, let me tell you, you MUST! This tasted just like something out of a restaurant. My recommendations:
- Splurge and get fresh uncooked shrimp, it's well worth it. 
- I added about 1/2 cup chopped fresh mushrooms. My hubby said they were small enough that he couldn't tell they were even in it. Don't skip that as it offers good flavor
- When I sauteed the 'shrooms, I added about 3 cloves chopped garlic. 
- I used four large plum tomatoes.
- Added two more garlic cloves to the champagne mixture. 
-Added extra cheese, as we love our cheese.
-Didn't use the entire box of angel hair pasta. Probably about 3/4 of it. 
Like others, I recommend having all the ingredients prepped as it is a fast process and better to have everything ready to throw in.

Not an easy meal to make and it is a little more time consuming than you expect but the payoff was amazing... Absolutely floored my parents...  I finally let my StepMother know where I get these amazing recipes.

I didn't go for five stars just because it sounded easier than what it is and you have to have adequate time to prepare it correctly with fresh ingredients.. if you are using frozen items or prepackaged may be a little less time consuming.

But expirament for your self you can't go wrong!!

WOW! This dish wowed my family for X-mas Eve! I read most of the reviews and made modifications accordingly; added garlic while sauteing mushrooms, used a dry white wine, not champagne, and because I doubled it, it took about 1/2 hr. to reduce. I also added about 1 cup grated romano cheese to help thicken which really gave it a nice flavor. This is on par with pasta dishes at restaraunts and certainly the best I've tasted!! My fam always makes the traditional ham and turkey so this was a very welcome departure that made them begging for more! Only regret is that I didn't quadruple the recipe, as suggested, so people could have seconds....sauce was gone with 6 people only enjoying generous firsts!!!! AMAZING!!! LOVE IT!!! WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS, if possible!!!

No question that everyone loved this recipe in my family.  There was none leftover.  I used prawns, a good champagne & crimini, shitake & oyster mushrooms.  Followed directions but ended up adding 1 tsp of garlic.  I think I will add a little more garlic next time per our taste.  Served with a warm crusty bread.  Had some champagne leftover and it went very well with this dish.  Delicous!  Thanks

Excellent even the next day.  The champagne is so good in a sauce I will use more often in cooking.  I had to modify to what I had in my pantry - I used a can of stewed tomatoes and canned mushrooms.  Instead of heavy cream I used 1/2 and 1/2 and instead of a shallot I used a small onion.  I added a little bit of chopped fresh basil to the sauce at the end.  The flavor was sweet and delicious.

I brought home the leftover champagne from a party and searched for any recipe that included champagne.  I sure am glad I found this one!!  I am a garlic lover, but I disagree with the review that says this recipe needs some.  It has a rich, complex flavor that I think garlic would overpower.  I used 1/2 the oil on the mushrooms and the other half to sautee the shallots instead of just boiling them.  I served this with some steamed broccoli.  Every member of my family went crazy over it.

Love this recipe!!  I've make this often now and vary it depending on what I have on hand.  I've made it with Shrimp (I cook the shrimp shells down to make a reduced stock that adds tons of flavor to the sauce), shrimp and scallops as well as with chicken.  When I make it with chicken, I cut my chicken breasts into 2 inch strips and saute them in a small amount of butter and olive oil, then saute my mushrooms in same pan.  My family likes a lot of sauce so I use some added chicken broth or chicken crystals and thicken with cornstarch.  Next time I make this I will dust the chicken in flour first, this way the sauce will be thicker and I wont have to add any cornstarch at the end.  All and all this is a fantastic recipe, one my whole family enjoys and it is elegant enough for company.

YUM!  This was a delicious Valentine's Day dinner.  The only thing I would change is tossing the pasta with the remaining 1/4 c of cream; I didn't think that did anything for it.  Also, I used bow tie pasta and it worked great.  If you use a 750 ml bottle of champagne you will have enough left over for 2 glasses with dinner and maybe a Mimosa the next morning  :-)

My husband and I loved it!  It is on the sweet side, but it isn't heavy like alfredo.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time I may thicken the sauce just a bit with flour or cornstarch.

I had some leftover champagne from last night and choose to use it up in this recipe. WOW! This was very good! Other than adding a chicken bullion cube to the champagne when sauting the shrimp (which disolves rather quickly), I didn't change a thing. Very elegant and would impress any guest (or just your family). Yup Tricia, this recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe. I used half pound of shrimp and half a pound of scallops. I also used 12 ounces of fettucine and there was enough sauce. And I used canned petite diced tomatoes. It turned out to be a delicious meal. The flavors mix very well.  It did take longer than what the recipe claims, but it doesn't matter because it's so good!

This has become a tradition at our house for Christmas Eve.  Our whole family just loves this and would be dissapointed if we had anything else.  I, like others have suggested, like to add a little minced garlic for extra punch.  It does take a while to reduce the sauce and extra time will be needed if you double the recipe.  One of the best recipes ever!

Very tasty.  My husband says it's a keeper!  I served it for our early-Valentine's day dinner and he loved it!  I put in a little less parsley and added some fresh garlic (because I put garlic in everything)!  Thank you for submitting the recipe.

I had a dish similar ton this is Italy and wanted to duplicate. This is very close, but the big difference is Italy used smoked salmon. Excellent! I have done this with shrimp. With smoked salmon and with both shrimp and salmon...rave reviews. This is a keeper.

We enjoyed this very much!  I omitted the mushrooms and used onions instead of shallots.  I used a bottle of Asti Spumante that had on hand.  I tossed in some Parmesan cheese into the pasta as well.  I will make this again.

AMAZING!!! I used Asti, since it was what I had on hand, and the dish was very sweet. I personally liked it, but for someone with less of a sweet tooth maybe try wine instead of champagne.

This was AMAZING!! After reading some reviews I made some minor adjustments, I used baby bella mushrooms and cooked them with olive oil and a little butter, I used 1/2lb shirmp and 1/2lb scallops, I added 2 cloves minced garlic, I didn't have a shallot so I used onion and I had canned plum tomatoes so I just used them. This was so easy and so yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good. I added doubled the shallots and tomato....but it still is missing a little something to get a 5....maybe try a touch of garlic next time. Sauce...too much pasta for the amount of sauce.I only ended up using half the pasta I cooked for the amount of sauce it made.made this again with garlic added. Yes...that is what it needed.

I used chicken instead of shrimp and having boiled it in the champagne, really brought out the flavor. Definitely would be better with fresh garlic as i found myself putting a touch of garlic salt on top along with my Parmesan cheese... Definitely will be making again soon!

Definitely a GREAT meal.  My fiance LOVED it.  Made an AWESOME mother's day dinner.  I used some frozen grilling shrimp.  I had to peel those, but it passed the time as the mushrooms cooked.  If you like tomatoes add more.  I felt it could have used more.  Not sure what or how much TWO plum tomatoes would yield (diced) so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  OH!  I did NOT mix everything together either.  Use more cream to make it thicker.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I only did a couple of things different.  I used a white wine instead of champagne, and I added some garlic into the tomato, wine, and shallot reduction.  If you boil the wine/champagne on high heat, it does reduce quite nicely (it does take a little longer than 8 minutes).  This is definitely a keeper!!!

This was a good meal.  Fun to cook and easy to experiment with.  I used white wine instead of chapagne and used leftover noodles.  For a little kick I added some chopped jalepeno, red pepper, and onions. Yum!

Very versatile recipe.  I used chicken tenders (cut into bite sized pieces)  instead of shrimp and baby bella mushrooms.  I recommend doing it all in the same pan and reserving the different stages as they are completed.  Boiling the chicken in the champagne deglazes the pan and carries the flavor of the mushrooms into the sauce.  The final result is outstanding and reheats well the next day.  I can't wait to try this with shrimp!

When I first saw the ingredients in this recipe I thought it might be a bit bland given the lack of spices. I was wrong. Follow the recipe as is and you'll end of with a mild sauce that allows the flavor of the champagne and shrimp to come through. This was very good!

I have got to say that this recipe was fantastic! i just made for my boyfriend last week for valentines day and he loved it!  i was a little skeptical at first because this recipe called for champagne and i am not experienced at all in using any type of alcoholic beverage in my cooking!  I read all the other reviews and finally decided on an extra dry champagne, and it was great!  It was only 2 of us and we had no leftovers!  Use a thickening agent for the sauce because it because it comes out a little watery (tbsp of flour).  Also, i minced 2 cloves of garlic for extra flavor.  One other comment, be sure to not let the shrimp cook all the way through when allowing the shrimp and champagne mixture to boil....the shrimp may become a little tought because you have to put them back in with the sauce later.  All in all i have ranted and raved to all my friends about this recipe and will be making it AGAIN!  Thanks TFK!

This is a quick and easy recipe that has gormet quality. I did fry shrimp after pulling the mushrooms and then pulled the shrimp and proceeded back to the letter. I also used white Z instead of Champagne the shrimp didn't notice a thing. Delicious!!

Great flavor for such a simple recipe.  It really is an easy elegant dish.  I made this for Valentines day and it was definatley a hit. I used part fat free half and half and it was still rich and creamy.

Excellent! I was worried I didn't reduce the wine enough (which does take longer than stated) when I added the cream but once I combined it with the pasta, it was perfect! The sauce does thicken slightly upon stading (and sitting the on the plate). Very good recipe that is flexible (I added green bell pepper and red onions). Certainly a keeper!   Note: I bought the cheap, precooked salad shrimp... I would get the raw next time. The precooked shrimp became slightly rubbery- okay but not as good as if it had been raw. Shrimp cooks so quickly anyway I don't know why I tried to make it faster. Lesson learned!

This recipe was really good, but I did break one of my cardinal rules. The first time I try a recipe, I try to do it to the letter, or at least as close as possible. I changed a few things on this one. I used Chardonnay instead of champagne. I didn't use shallots I used garlic and onion, and I used light cream and a little corn starch to thicken. Over all it was good but not mindblowing.

A great dish! Delicious.  My 2 kids are super picky and they both took seconds.  My only change was to substitute light cream for the heavy cream.  The sauce was still very creamy. Thanks for a super dish I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for company and brought it out on the plates like in a restaurant.  (I sprinkled extra parmesan cheese on top). The presentation was beautiful and the dinner was delicious.  My husband, as well as our guest, LOVED it and kept complimenting me on the dinner.   This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I served it with steamed broccoli and special cheese bread and it truly was as good as any fine restaurant meal!

There is just something so RIGHT about this recipe. The flavors come together effortlessly.  I used 3 peeled and seeded roma tomatoes instead of 2 plum, and a whole minced scallion, which looked like more than 2 tablespoons. I used a little more cream than 1 cup, too, though I only used 1.5 cups of champagne (actually cava) as the recipe calls for. I think the main idea here is that the quantities aren't all that important if you're keeping an eye on the texture.  One thing though--it took me so much longer than 30 minutes to make this, even though I bought prepeeled and deveined shrimp! I am sort of slow in the kitchen, for sure, but I don't see how anyone could make this in such a short amount of time unless everything was prechopped, preheated, etc. Don't let this scare you, though. This recipe is outrageously good.

This is very similar to a recipe a friend gave me years ago for chicken (pounded thin & dredged in lightly herbed flour).  Easy, delicious, and always a winner!

Our family did not enjoy this dish at all.  Surprised by all the rave reviews, we followed recipe pretty closely, must just be a flavor combo we didn't care for.

This dish is EXCELLENT and very easy. I did like someone else said, I cooked onions, mushrooms and garlic in oil and butter first and then set aside, then follow the recipe. It is great. I am doing it again today, with half champagne and half white wine as I am almots out of champagne.The tates shouldn't be altered with the wine I believe.

Incredible!  I made sure to get all the juice from the sauteed mushrooms back in the pan.  Made plenty of sauce.  Best thing I've tasted in a LONG time!

this was great! i made it tonight (valentine's day), and it taste fantastic. The only thing I did different was omit the tomatoes and shallots because my boyfriend dislikes both, but I just used freshly minced garlic, and the taste was great. Also, I used wheat linguine instead of the angel hair pasta. I definitely recommend it!

This was really good! I made it with bow tie pasta and really fresh shrimp. The sauce had a ery unique flavor. I found myself thinking it needed a little tweak but I couldn't figure out what it was.

This was just what I was looking for in the way of a simple but delicious shrimp & pasta. I did use a Chardonnay (3/4 cup)instead of champagne,what I had on hand, but I will try it the next time. (I had a little leftover, and it was just as good the next day w/o the pasta.)Didn't use the parsley but I'm not a fan. Thanks, can't wait to make it again!!

This was a great pasta dish. Of course, I made some modifications. As suggested by a reviewer, you should really have all your ingredients ready to cook right next to the stove. You have to be quick. Also, I didn't have regular champagne so I used the strawberry champagne I had on hand instead. This gave the dish a bit of a sweeter taste and it complemented the tomatoes really well. One last modification, I measured out 1/4 cup of heavy cream first and mixed it in with the fettucine pasta (this kept the pasta from sticking together as I cooked the main sauce).

DELICIOUS!!  This recipe was super easy and so so good.  I used extra mushrooms and tomatoes, and added fresh garlic to the mushrooms.  The sauce didn't thicken as much as I would like so I added a handful of grated Italian cheese and it thickened right up and gave great flavor. Added fresh basil to the pasta.  This was awesome!

If I make this recipe again, I will use fresh shrimp and not frozen.  The shrimp had no flavor. I also used a whole box of angel hair pasta.  Too much pasta and not enough sauce.  I do think basil and garlic would be tastier ingredients vs. the parsley and shallots.  I may try again in the future

This is really good. The champagne cuts down on the dish being too creamy. I added scallops and lump crab meat as well as toasted pine nuts and garlic. I used a whole box of angle hair and didnt have quite enough sauce so I had to add more champagne and cream.

This was fabulous! Definitely entering the rotation. I made only minor changes, based on what we like and what we had on hand. For pasta, I used a "garlic and parsley linguine" that my store carries. I added garlic and red pepper flakes, since I never cook anything without them. Also, I didn't have any tomatoes so I used diced red bell pepper instead. I might try tomato next time, but the pepper works well too. This is a great idea, but make it your own!

Made for Valentine's day.  VERY GOOD.  To cut the calories, used low fat 1/2 and 1/2 then made extra sauce to add to the pasta (versus adding cream to the pasta).

this was good but wasn't as flavorful as expected. Followed recipe completely. I would still make again. As one reviewer suggested, I would use bowtie pasta the second time as it would make for a nice(r) presentation and help the sauce cling better.

I thought this was delicious and easy.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and minced garlic because I didn't have shallots.  I will definitely make this again, but would use drier champagne, because it was just a little too sweet.

This was by far the best pasta I have ever  made or eaten. I will side with one previous reviewer, as an amateur cook it is IMPERATIVE to have your ingredients premeasured and waiting so as to not overcook...

Excellent recipe!

Made this with Asti (that was what I had on hand)and loved just the hint of sweetness it gave the dish.  Gave some of the leftovers away to a guy I worked with and he begged for the recipe (said it was better than the high dollar steak he had for lunch)!

This is one of my favorite show-off recipes when company comes over.  I like to add garlic when cooking mushrooms.  I also have found that 8 minutes is not long enough to reduce the liquids to 1/2 c.  I also will add fresh basil on occassion instead of parsley to give it more flavor.

I made this for some great friends that were visiting for the weekend. What a hit! I varied the recipe just a bit. I used 1 container of baby bella mushrooms; instead of the tomatoes, I used a can of Italian chopped tomatoes (drained). 2 cups of good champagne8 oz of heavy cream. Great flavor and I served it with a Caprese Salad and a crusty Garlic, Rosemary bread with olive oil and Balsamic vinegar to dip. My friends begged for the recipe and with four of us, there wasn't a drop left! They were using the bread to sop up any remaining sauce in the pasta bowl!

This was only ok...I followed many of the suggestions: add garlic and use half&half rather than cream, but it only ended up being tasting ok.  My house smelled great though!

Awesome dish!!  My only comment is that it took much longer than 8 minutes to reduce the liquid (more like 15-20 minutes), but that could easily be operator error. =)

I made this the first time for an informal dinner party and it was a hit! The only thing I added extra was garlic-with the mushrooms as well to the champagne with the shallots. I omitted the tomatoes. It was great! It wasn't heavy at all and this is a definitely a keeper for informal dinner parties.

This was so tasty! I added just a little garlic, and a couple turns of the pepper grinder. I made this for my parents this weekend and Mom asked for the recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious...the seasonings added with the whipping cream and champagne were sublime and not overpowering.  The only "extra" that I added (b/c I love garlic) is that I added a 1/2 tsp. of garlic pepper. The in-laws (who are picky) loved this dish.  Thanks Tricia!

This was delicious!  I didn't have any mushrooms, but will make sure to have them next time I make this.  I doubled the amount of shrimp and sauce, and had made a whole pound of pasta, but didn't use it all.  I added a couple cloves of garlic along with the shallots and finished it off with a drizzle of lemon olive oil.  Very easy and very tasty!

Outstanding!!  We didn't think it was as rich as others mentioned.  I added more tomatoes too and also increased the mushrooms, triple the amount suggested.  I will be sure to serve this to guests soon.  I may add the garlic some mentioned next time and will use a different pasta since we decided we didn't like the slender angel hair pasta.

eeh..not my favorite. It is sweet and kind of different and maybe thats why I didnt like it as much as some dishes. The champagne idea was cool and it gave me yet another reason to drink it! If you like sweet cream sauces you will like this recipe.

I thought the dish was a bit too sweet.  I also didn't have enough sauce to coat the pasta well.  I may have cooked off too much of the champagne though.  If you like sweet dishes, you'll enough this.

This was very good.  I made it with scallops instead of shrimp and used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  The canned tomatoes worked out fine (fresh would probably have been better, I know...but canned was all I had) - I just had to cook it a bit longer to reduce the liquid down than the recipe called for.  Very nice meal, would be good for a special occassion.

We loved this recipe!  My husband called me from work the next day while eating the leftovers to tell me again how good this was. I used white wine in place of champagne and about 3/4 can diced tomato (drained) instead of fresh. Left out the mushrooms and added a sprinkle of garlic powder. Also used light cream instead of heavy,since that's all I had but it thickened up just fine. This was fairly simple to make and extremely good.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  Will be used often at our house.

OH MY HEAVENS!! This is wonderful beyond words! I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers, added 3 cloves minced garlic to the shrimp and champagne, added more shrimp because we love its flavor, used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter, increased the tomatoes and used liguini pasta instead of angel hair because the sauce clings better to it.

Omg!  This was awfully good.  Used dry white wine instead of champagne.  And like other reviewers, I doubled the tomatoes.  Did not toss the pasta with cream - just added all the cream to the other ingredients.  I had no trouble with the sauce being too runny.

I will definitely make this again, and if we're feeling flush we may try it using a really dry (usually means expensive) champagne.  YUM!

This recipe was excellent. I'm always looking for fabulous pasta dishes for my husband and this one fit the bill. He loved it. I only used 1/2 c of mushrooms (we're not big fans). Will definitely make this recipe again.

Was very easy and my family loved it.  Even my 9 yr old son didn't complain about having left-overs the next night.  I didn't want to use champagne as called for....substitued white grape juice and the flavor was marvelous.

I loved this. I made a few changes though.  My family doesn't like shrimp much so I used the canned tiny shrimp and a pink champagne and lots more mushrooms. next time I will use green onion instead and not cut the tomatoes so small. great color and taste all in one

This is a great recipe.  My husband prefers thicker sauces, the sauce was a little thin for his tastes.  I loved it.  I might try thickening it with cornstarch the next time.  The best part is if you have leftover champagne, it goes great with the meal!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS; one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  A very rich and filling meal that all of my guests loved.  I used a dry champagne and FETTUCINE pasta (rather than thin angel hair) and added SCALLOPS.  It came wonderful!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This dish is awesome!  My wife invited a good friend over for dinner and she was floored by how delicious the pasta dish turned out.  The only thing I did a little different was to add the shallots after removing the mushrooms, with just a little bit more olive oil and "sweated" them for just a couple of minutes, then added the champagne (also added the fresh garden tomatoes right before serving)...Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!!!

I was not impressed with the sauce.   I had to add flour to thicken it up, and other seasonings to give it a flair.  I wouldn't cook this again.

I used crab meat instead of shrimp and took out the plum tomatoes to keep the sauce white.  It turned out beautifully and my husband loved it.  Great recipe that I'm sure I will use again soon.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used what I had in the house...chopped dried onions and whipping cream instead of heavy cream.  It still turned out fabulous.  I am sure the shallots would have added more depth.  I also would try adding spinach and garlic for a bit of color and zip.  It's definitely a recipe worth trying as is!

This is so quick and easy!  I made it for a candlelight dinner and wasn't too tired from cooking to enjoy the meal... and my date was quite impressed as well.  Great with crusty bread and remaining champagne.

I made this recipe for friends over the weekend.  Everyone loved it.  I made extra sauce.  It takes much longer than 8 minutes to reduce the champagne sauce, but it is well worth it.  We'll definitely be cooking this recipe again.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! They say never to try a new recipe out on company, but I did and everyone including myself just raved. I can't say enough about how incredible this recipe is. I used 1 pound shrimp and 1 pound scallops. If you double the seafood, I would recommend tripling the sauce (champagne, salt, shallots, tomatoes, and heavy cream) just so you have ample for your pasta. I used an electric skillet and it worked out great, that way you can keep the skillet on warm until everyone is ready. Just fabulous!!!

A really great recipe and easy to prepare.  Good for company or just the family.  Can add other things you like, i.e. mushrooms, olives,, etc., and it comes our wonderful!  Can't say about kids because we don't have any at home any more.

I made this last night for dinner because my boyfriend loves shrimp and he thought this recipe was great!  I really don't like shrimp, but I loved this recipe.  I didn't have any champagne at home so I substituted wine instead and it still turned out great!

I tried this receipe and loved it,and my mother in law loved it, but my husband is stuck on alfredo!. Anyway, it was very good,and the presentation was good. It would be a great meal for company. My one teenager that tried it did not like it, and the other teen wouldn't even try it. But what do they know! They're used to cheesesteaks and burgers. Try this one, you'll love it too. Thanks!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I would use a little less parsley next time, but otherwise would recommend this dish highly!  A definite keeper!  Thanks so much!

I used my Mom and Dad as guinea pigs for this one.  I knew they both liked shrimp and pasta.  This one was a wow!  Best comment was, they felt like they were eating in a fine dining restaraunt and would pay prime price for the meal.  Served with a blush wine makes this a perfect everyday dish with a special occasion effect.

I used Pinot Grigio instead of champagne and green onion for garnish. It could easily be adapted for chicken.

I was out of Prosecco and so used a Pinot Grigio and it worked just as well.  I added some garlic and canned chopped tomatoes and lots of Parm Reggiano and it was delicious.  I like this recipe very much and will be making it often.  I always cut back on the amount of pasta as I want less of that and more of the good stuff; i.e., the shrimp and mushrooms and tomatoes!

This was hands down amazing. I was surprised how light the sauce was, it was a delicious spring dish. I followed the directions exactly,  down to "boiling the cream " (it was more of a simmer) and it came out perfectly.

Awesome recipe! My husband and I cooked this together for our anniversary and both loved it! We don't like tomatoes so we left them out and used a sweet onion instead of shallots. It was fantastic...and we still had plenty of champagne left to drink! I will be making this again! Soon!

Excellent! A few tweaks: I browned the mushrooms in butter and added a bit of sherry at the end of that step. Used bay scallops. Cooked them a short time in some more butter before adding the champagne. Added one clove of minced garlic. Removed the scallops just as champagne came to the boil. Added some pre-shelled pre-cooked baby langoustina shrimp when I added back the mushrooms and scallops to heat through. Served over rice with fresh French loaf and a glass of the leftover champagne. Yum!

Great!! A little bland (I am Cajun) I would Definitely make sure you are adding enough salt and pepper. Suggestion to add some cayenne pepper, Tony's, or any Cajun seasonings to add a little more flavor. Great paring with garlic toast

This is really good.  I made per the directions, with the exception of adding a little garlic when I sauteed the mushrooms, and sprinkled a little Old Bay on the shrimp when I added them to the skillet.  I don't believe either of these changes improves the outcome.  I served it over thin whole wheat spaghetti for dinner, and then took the leftover shrimp and sauce, over quinoa, for lunch the next day.  Will make again for sure.

We call this "Anniversary Pasta", because we've had it every year for our anniversary for almost ten years now. I usually have to sub out the champagne, often for white wine, which works well, and I'll throw in some garlic because we're garlic fiends. Otherwise it's as-written, and we love it so.

Sooooo good. Really really really easy and tasty! I used simple white cooking wine and diced up some fresh tomato from my garden and it turned out awesome. I also used simple spagetti noodles (whatever I have in the cabinets is pretty much what I use) and it was wonderful! Will def make in the future. And if I can afford champagne sometime I am sure it will make it even better :)

Very yummy!  The sauce came out awesome and I was concerned that it may not because of the review I read from bferris19 about it.  I swapped champagne for white cooking wine and it was super delicious,  I cooked my noodles for too long, which I was trying to avoid, but the recipe was still awesome!

This was definitely a restaturant quality dish.  Quick to prepare and very tasty.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic while sauteeing the mushrooms and I also added chopped green onions into the pasta along with the parsley.  I used a $10 bottle of champagne (Korbel Brut - I am clueless when it comes to the quality of wines and such but the sauce was delicious).  I definitley will make this dish again.

I made this for company on Saturday night and it was AWESOME!  I made the recipe exactly as is (although I did add just a little bit of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce) and it doesn't need any changes at all.  Thank you!

I have a house full of picky eaters and this was a tremendous hit.  I did end up adding some garlic for flavor and that was the only variation I made to the recipe (other than doubling it).  Very yummy!!!

This was an easy and excellent receipe.  I used cooked chicken instead of shrimp and added asparagus.  I cooked the asparagus before cooking the mushrooms, all in the same pan.  I also used a white wine instead of the Champagne, and the taste was excellent!  Great recipe!!

Just made some huge modifications to this recipe and wow! After 3 helpings of this marvelous dish, I practically had to be carted away from the table. It really is one of those dishes that taste SO good, it's hard to to quit eating.

What's not to love about champagne, shrimp, and cream?  I did double the sauce after reading other reviews.  This was a big hit for a special occasion dinner.

This was an awesome dinner!  My husband (who is a picky eater when it comes to seafood) said that the dish was "restaurant-quality good."  I added some garlic as other people mentioned, but I am sure the recipe is spectacular either way!  Thanks!   This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent dish, tastes restaurant quality.  I used only 3/4 cup of heavy cream in the sauce and none in the pasta and it tasted great.  This one is a keeper

I love simple food that has ingredient balance and this is one of those you have to try if you like cream sauces, pasta and shrimp.  I didn't have the shallots and I made a combination of onion and garlic instead, also added red bell pepper.  My family loved it.  Will make again.

I, too, made this last night for my Valentine. I like chilled shrimp but am not a big fan of it in warm pasta dishes. It didn't matter. This was fabulous! Easy to make, rave reviews but should have doubled the recipe as we all wanted more! To the woman who didn't follow the recipe...try it again and follow the recipe, you will really love it this time.

I made this for my Honey last night for our Valentine dinner.  This was to die for.  The only thing I did different was I sauteed all of the veggies and added a clove of garlic.  It was rich and flavorful and elegant for a special meal.

Delicious! I doubled this recipe - 1-1/2 lbs. penne pasta, 2 pkgs. fresh mushrooms, 2 lbs. shrimp, etc., but also used 6 plum tomatoes.  I also used a bottle of Korbel brutt (3 cups).  The only thing I would do differently is not add that last 1/4-1/2 cup of remaining cream.  Great Flavor - loved it.

I made about 2x the amount of sauce doubling all ingredients but shrimp and pasta. I had to boil the champagne for a great length of time to get it to 1 cup (double recipe amount), I'm thinking it was ~30 minutes of boiling to get it to this volume. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 then ~ 2tbs of flour to get the sauce to thicken. Excellent recipe, used Great Western Extra Dry Brut.

This was delicious.  However, I think you need to let the sauce soak in for a bit before serving.  It was actually better as leftovers as the flavors had more of a chance to meld.  Company will be very impressed by this dish.

I really liked this and so did my husband and a coworker that dropped by. I didn't have some of the ingredients, so did make substitutions, regular onion, white wine, and fresh spinach which i just slightly wilted at end of cooking. I think i will add some garlic next time too. I also didn't add cream to just the pasta, just a little oil to keep farfella from sticking. I did use less pasta than called for so i did have enough sauce. Very good~!!!!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was wonderful. My fiance' asked to put it on the short list for pasta dishes. I let it thicken up a little more than the recipe so didn't have a thinning problem like others. The flavors are very good.

I tried this expecting alot more. Not what I expected. It was good but not great. I would not make it again because there are other pasta recipes I liked better. I did not find the sauce got thick at the end, so I added alittle bit of milk and cornstarch and helped.

I LOVE this recipe!! I HATE shrimp but I started dating a man who loved it, so I grabbed this recipe one night and I am SO glad I did! Was easy for me to do, even under the strain of a first date ;) and it came out DELICIOUS even I loved it! I use this for any special occasion now. Its so good and so easy! I served it with some freshly sauteed up green beans and sliced almonds in peanut oil. was great!

This recipe is my favorite yet! It even makes for great leftovers! I had to be careful not to scald the cream or completely dissolve the champagne though so I'm glad I paid attention! :) Great recipe!

My family really enjoyed this.  There seemed to be more than 15 minutes of preperation but it may have been the 15 month old attached to my leg.  Will make again.

I've made this several times, sans mushrooms, and it is delicious every time. This is probably my all-time favorite meal. If you like shrimp you will love this recipe.

Very good.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I used bowtie pasta and didn't use mushrooms.  We thought it had good flavor with the champagne (I used a bottle of Andre Extra dry champagne-for $3.99).  This is a keeper.

One of our favorite shrimp pasta dishes. My sauce turned out on the thin side, so next time I will adjust to thicken it up a bit.

This was amazing! We made this last week and found it quick, easy and yummy. I'm a seafood eater and thought it was one of the best dishes I've every had. My husband is not a seafood lover but called it 'very good' that's a big compliment. I went to the local liquor store and bought a mini bottle of brut champagne, it was the perfect amount for the two of us (I scaled down some of the recipe). We used a can of diced tomatoes and replaced the parsley with fresh basil instead. I also used more cream than what was called for to make more of sauce - and served it over fettucine. Will make this again and again.

YUMMY.  I used a can of diced tomatoes (slightly drained) instead of fresh.  I also used Maine shrimp.  They are very small so I only cooked them for a second.  This is a great dish...I love it.

This is the most amazing recipe.  I have made it 2x and both times it was absolutely addictive. I first made it for my b/f's bday and he couldn't believe how good it was.  The second time I made it, I didn't have champagne so I used ginger ale.  It turned out somewhat sweeter than the first time, but was still very good.

This recipe was great.  I doubled the sauce and jazzed it up with 3/4 t of ground red pepper and 1.5 T of minced garlic.  Will make again... maybe with chicken next time.

We thought this was good but not outstanding. I used a good Brut Prosecco (Italian sparkling wine). I added bay scallops when it called for the shrimp & just added my pre-cooked shrimp in at the end, to warm. I also added two large cloves of minced garlic when I added the tomatoes & shallots. It was good but I think it could have been more flavorful. I wish I had done as WIESENECK did & used basil instaed of parsley. I used half & half to coat my pasta with, to cut down on the fat some. Served it w/ a salad & garlic toast & made Rossini Bellinis (uses strawberry puree instead of the peach puree called for in bellinis) out of the remainder of the prosecco. Thansk Tricia...this is a repeater!

Quick,easy and delicious - my favorite combo!   This meal is great and you can easily substitute frozen shrimp to save time if need be.  I also like to add fresh garlic and basil instead of parsley.  Bottom line, it's a great recipe that I highly recommend!

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have medium shrimp, so used litte bay shrimp.  They're already cooked so I just added them when the sauce was done.  My husband loved it and wants me to make sure to save the recipe.  Did add a little garlic to the champagne.  Used  1/2 and 1/2 because I didn't have heavy cream and was a little runnier, but still very tasty.

This was really good!  The only mistake I made was not getting it thick enough, but I think it will be easy to correct next time by making sure I cook enough liquid out before adding the cream.

I made this dish last night for my mother in law's birthday. It was amazing! As far as modifications go,I used extra mushrooms (crimini, the little brown ones) and I sauteed 4 cloves of chopped garlic with the mushrooms. I also used fresh basil in place of the parsley. This dish is also great made with chicken! I had to make one serving with chicken last night because my husband is allergic to seafood, but we all loved it either way! This was pretty easy and quick to make. I'll deffinately make it again!

If I could give it 6 stars I would.  Easy and awesome!  I used grape tomatoes cause it's all I had but it turned out good.  Next time I would add more mushrooms, and you can use less shrimp to save money.

I made this for the first time for Valentine day a week after my wedding it's been the dish my husbands asks for on any special occassion.  Only changes I make are basil instead of parsley, baby portabellas and sometimes I switch up the pasta.  Great recipe!!!!

Very yummy. Made this for the first time for a party of 11. They all liked it.  I used chardonney and followed the recipe. Good idea to have everything sliced and measured. The following night had a party of 8 and used linguine pasta instead and I liked that even more.  I bought Costco frozen raw tail-on shrimp and it was perfect (make sure to rinse the shrimp). No need for garlic. It was tasty enough. Make sure to add fresh parmesan cheese, salt and a little pepper.

This is GREAT!  I have made it twice and both times my husband raves!  Each time I used white wine instead of champagne and the second time, I used half shrimp and half scallops (YUMMY!).  This dish is fairly easy to put together and looks nice so I will certainly try it for company.

Delicious. I did make one change, however. I do not buy heavy cream (I make my own substitution of 1/2 and 1/2-   7oz. of milk and 3 T. butter combined to = 1c.). This substitution recipe worked out well and it tasted delicious in this recipe.

My family loves this recipe --- we've made it several times. I've substituted white wine for champagne and it's come out great too. However, I tried to make it low fat by using non-fat sour cream and that didn't fair so well --- so just be prepared to splurge a little and enjoy!

This recipe is good but it screams for garlic.  I would saute 1-2 cloves of minced garlic with the shallots and the mushrooms.  Also, I boiled the shrimp shells in the champagne for a few minutes, then strained the liquid and added it to the original pan.  Otherwise a very good dish.

AWESOME!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best dish I ever made and one of the best dishes he's ever tasted.
It was a bit on the sweet side, but in a nice, mild way.  (I used Asti).
I added lemon juice and garlic powder to the shrimp.  I also added fresh minced garlic right after the shallots.  There wasn't a ton of sauce (mine definitely reduce well) however, it was fine since the pasta was already tossed with the reserved cream...DELICIOUS!!!

While my son and I liked this, my husband didn't.  He didn't think it had enough zest.  I liked the champagne taste in the sauce but maybe some additional fresh parley or other spice would give it more taste.  I would make it again for me - my husband votes no.

This is a mediocre dish; nothing fantastic that would entice my palate to yearn for more.  There's not enough flavor in the sauce; the shrimp was overwhelming and the champagne was virtually non-existant.

This dish was GREAT! I did add some garlic cloves and cooked the sauce a little longer so it would thicken some more. My family loved it. Its a keeper. Thanks Tricia!

Awesome!!  I followed the recipe exactly on the first time and it was great.  The next time I cut my shrimp in half so they would absorb a little more flavor.  After cooking the shrimp in the champagne I removed them, threw them into another pan on high heat, doused them with some brandy and flamed them for a bit for even a little more flavor.  I also squeezed a little lime juice on them before returning them to the mix.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

Simple, elegant recipe with a wonderful flavor.  I substituted roma tomatoes (we like them better) and Asti Spumanti.  Next time I will either use champagne as the recipe called for or white wine.  The Asti made the recipe a bit sweeter than necessary, but it was still really good.  It is not necessary to add cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce, you just have to simmer it longer, until it reaches the desired consistency.  (make sure you stir it continuously)

This recipe was very good.  The only problem I had was the angel hair was very sticky and hard to take apart.  I have another shrimp recipe that tasted very simular to this but it was alot easier to prepare. I found this recipe required quit a bit of preperation but it was tasty.

This recipe was a HIT! Easy but it did not take 15 minutes. The sauce reduction takes a bit longer and I would not cook the pasta until the sauce is reduced. Very difficult to pull apart Angel Hair Pasta even after you have sprayed with Olive Oil, not to mention it was cold. I also think a shaped pasta, ie bowtie would be nice with this dish! Did not change or add a thing. GREAT RECIPE!

Took more than 15 minutes to prepare.... would wait until the end to cook the pasta, I ended up with cold pasta and hot sauce.  Flavor is great!  Will make again but time it better next time.

******  This is absolutely delicious!  I will fix this again and again!!  I forgot the parsley, added more champagne & shrimp and used a plump, garden-variety tomato instead of plum tomatos.  I'll be adding the shrimp later in the recipe since shrimp cook very quickly, otherwise it was perfect!

Wonderful! I made it for Valentine's Day dinner, and we loved it. The sauce is really good. I used a little more shrimp than called for, but otherwise didn't change the recipe. We'll have this again; it's a keeper. Tasted like something we'd have ordered at a nice restaurant!

INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I MADE THIS TONIGHT--RAVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Of course--I made my own adjustments as with any recipe--BUT THIS recipe is PHENOMENAL!!!!

Secret of my success:  Use Pinot Grigio (white wine).  I also created my own Pinot Grigio overnight marinade.  I minced and finely chopped garlic, shallots, green onions, parsley and cilantro--added cheyanne pepper, salt, pepper and garlic salt.  Consistency was a mushy, mulchy sludge.  let it marinate overnight in a NON-METAL covered dish.

Follow recipe precisely (I omitted the mushrooms).
I also used Angel Hair pasta nests--perfect!

Use extra marinade--add a LITTLE mayonaise and extra virgin olive oil--spread on pizza bread (i used Boboli) and bake 400* for 4-5 minutes.  then add fresh grated parmesan cheese and bake again 4-5 mnutes.

On dinner plate create a "hole" in center of pasta and scoop Pinot Grigio Shrimp into "hole".  Allow sause to drizzle out over the pasta.  top with fresh parmesan cheese.

THIS RECIPE IS PHENOMENAL!!!!!
WHAT ABOUT DESSERT? 
EASY!!!  Locate the Truffle Chocolate Cheesecake on this website!  It's to die for!

WOW!!  Easy, wonderful flavor, kid pleaser, how much better does it get?  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out fantastic (sometimes I get creative when fixing something - and this didn't need any "fixing").  Thank you for the awesome Valentine dinner idea!

I made this for valentine's. Very yummy!
I sprinkled on bottled parsley instead of 
fresh. Next time I would add garlic.

I had leftover champagne and needed to use up the shrimp from New Years dinner.  Wow!  What a great recipe I found in this one.  My husband still talks about the flavor and wants to keep it one our regular dinner list.

Oh my gosh, how delicious.  Followed directions except I used white wine in place of champagne.  Make sure not to overcook the shrimp.  The larger the shrimp, the better.  I doubled the recipe and had another lb of shrimp, should have tripled it!  Very easy to make, though takes a bit of time.  Loved it!!!

I made this exactly according to the recipe. In our opinion it was good but not as great as the reviews indicated. I might make it again, but it wouldn’t be a favorite to make often.

Really good recipe. Only difference I do is no mushrooms. Don’t like them. Instead I add an extra tomato and use an entire shallot.

This was very tasty. Not too flavorful but enough to want to make again. I followed another reviewer's note to have everything ready and measured out beforehand, and they were right! It wasn't difficult just a little time consuming and multi-tasking a bit. I will make this again.

loved it! I added a heaping tablespoon of diced garlic and two habanero peppers to the recipe. I think it would also be amazing with clams.

Needs some tweaking.  The flavors are a bit bland as-is.  I added garlic which helped.  Next time I will add some butter too.

This is on my list to perfect.  I like the tomato cream combination like a vodka sauce.  I'd like the flavor to be a little more intense, maybe it was my technique.  I'll be making this repeatedly.  I usually do shrimp with garlic and butter, so this is a good alternative.

Wow. The flavors come together in a magical way. This is outstanding, exactly as written (with a little garlic powder just because, and onion because my store doesn’t carry shallots.) A definite keeper!

My husband raved about this dish.  I will definitely make it for guests.  I did add garlic with the shallots and tomatoes.  Cooked the mushrooms in olive oil and 1 TBL butter and splashed a bit of brandy at the end of the cooking time.

Thank you to the previous reviewers for all the great suggestions on add ons to this dish.

Meh. I made this just as the recipe stated and the sauce came out sour, (and I did not use cheap champagne.) I also could not get the sauce to thicken up so I had to add flour to keep it from being runny. I gave this three stars because the idea was good and I will make it again...just with a different sauce.

It was yummy and all my company liked it, but i was expecting something a little more out of this world with all the great reviews! Still yummy. Maybe needs a little more flavor. I might season it a little more throughout the process.

I bought already cooked cilantro lime shrimp and a rotisserie chicken from Costco the day before and it made this recipe super fast and easy! Didn't have parsley or mushrooms but added the leftover chicken and used fresh cherry tomatoes diced up. I also substituted 1/4 of a large yellow onion for the shallots and it came out amazing! Used pappardelle roasted garlic pasta and asparagus on the side...so good!!

This is a nice easy and elegant meal! Great for a romantic dinner (with the rest of the champagne of course)! My wife and I love it!

This dish was amazing. Perfect for a nice dinner without the kids around.  I replaced the olive oil with butter because I love that richness. I stuck to all the measurements and it was divine.  This will definitely be made often.

I enjoyed this fresh take on pasta. Like some of the other reviewers I agree that it calls for too much shrimp.  Next time I will use half a pound. The mushrooms were so good in this I'll use the whole package next time. I did throw in a tablespoon of bourbon toward the end of sautéing the mushrooms. I also agree with some others that white wine would work equally well in this. I used light cream and was pleased with the result. I did add a clove of garlic to mine. I might try an onion or more shallots next time. And capers! Maybe even an anchovy or two.  Because I love saltiness with pasta. Awesome take on pasta and shrimp!

Delicious! It's easy to make and is a quick meal. Use a good-quality Brut champagne as another reviewer noted. I also chose to use canned diced plum tomatoes (drain them before using) because fresh tomatoes are out of season.

This pasta is delicious! The only way to make it a little better might be to sprinkle a few red pepper flakes before serving to add a pop of color and a tinge of heat.  That's what I'm trying next time.

I sautéed  Portobella mushrooms in butter & olive oil and added 1/2 red onion .+ 3 large cloves of garlic then set aside the sautéed veggies and then, Iadded 1/2 lb. each:  large raw shrimp & large sea scallops cooked until almost opaque, followed by adding in the sautéed veggies that I had set aside and finally the champagne. I used drained plum tomatoes instead of fresh, and added all the cream to the tomato sauce.  NOTE: I used a very dry champagne.  -  Overall, probably the best pasta I have ever eaten. The flavors are subtle, (and the recipe does NOT need the garlic unless you definitely must have it.)  Not sure what difference using fresh tomatoes would make, but the drained canned tomatoes did not detract from the dish in my opinion.

What a waste of champagne. Plus the sauce is almost tasteless, it needs garlic and some type of spices to give it some "oomph".

Had a dinner party for 16 during lent.  Everyone loved this dish. I added sautéed asparagus and scallops. Also used rosemary and garlic canned diced tomatoes.  Was a great meal and amazing leftovers.  I also added sun dried tomatoes.   Just drained the oil, cut them in half and tossed them in with the pasta and sauce.

It was delicious! I substituted light cream for heavy cream which made it a little bit watery but it thickened easily. I chose to cook the pasta during the last part of cooking the sauce & felt that was better because the pasta was hot & mixed very well with the cream & parsley. Would definitely make again (especially since my hubby & I got to drink the rest of the champagne...).  Yum!!!

Amazing!  I used a semi-sweet bubbly with it.  Next time I make it will be scallops, just to try it.  I added the artichoke hearts someone else mentioned, and that was a hit!  Also, with the next batch I'm going to use a much dryer, but not quite brut, champagne just to see how it adjusts the flavor.  Thanks for sharing this great meal!

I made this exactly as written with a $10 bottle of dry champagne, don't remember the brand. It came out on the sour side, I guess because of the champagne.  My family did not enjoy this dish at all.  I added oregano, italian seasoning, basil and sugar and cayenne pepper to make it more enjoyable.

This was good, really tasty.  I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 lb shrimp since it was just for me.  I did make the full recipe of sauce and I was glad I did.  I unintentionally only used 1 plum tomato since one of mine was bad when I started cutting it.  It was almost a little too much work but I enjoyed the end result.  I think it needs a little something.  It was really good but not over the top.  I don't know, maybe more parmesan or a little bit of added herbs.  I would make again.  This one moves fast so have everything cut up, measured, and ready to go.

Sooo good. I made twice the recipe because I wanted to incorporate more seafood into it. I added scallops and mussels in addition to shrimp. The instructions and recipe were well-written. The sauce is finger-licking delicious!!! My date definitely enjoyed his first home-cooked meal by me. Thank you for the recipe! I think next time I'll add a teaspoon more salt and some crushed red/black pepper for some spice.

I added a couple teaspoons of sugar an md I little flour water mixture to thicken up the sauce. And I couldn't find a dry wine so I used a Chenin Blanc idk what the difference is not a drinker and never bought wine so far so good!!!

OMG!  What flavor!  AND so easy.  I was wondering why I have never made anything like this before.  I used Prosecco and I like the sweet ones.  I used my own frozen tomatoes and added artichoke hearts.  I added a pound of baby portabella mushrooms.  Awesome!  I am so amazed at the results that I now have to rush out and find a fantastic bread to serve with it.  Thanks for the recipe!  A keeper.

Absolutely amazing!  A relatively easy dish and everybody wiped their bowl completely clean. My husband is not a fan of mushroom so I substituted with asparagus.

I thought this recipe was okay.  The family ate it and liked it enough but I'm not sure I would make it again.  The sauce definitely needed to be doubled which is fine but it was very thin.  I did thicken it up with cornstarch which is fine but even still I think the sauce lacked something.  I read another review which felt maybe some prosciutto or salty meat would do it and I think I agree.

Took forever to reduce.  We finally added reserved pasta water to thicken.  Really don't like to do that.  With shrimp we are careful not to over cook.  So, we seared raw jumbo in a little olive oil and garlic, adding them last.  Very rich and filling.

This is okay...but given the expense of the shrimp and champagne, I would not recommend the recipe. There are better shrimp recipes on here.

My changes:  Omitted the mushrooms (don't like) and shallots (didn't have).  Used a touch more than a pound of shrimp.  1 - 14.5 oz can of Diced Tomatoes (with basil, garlic & oregano).  Added chopped onion, minced garlic, and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle.   Me & the girl liked this - I thought it got better with each bite.  However, husband thought the sauce was "bitter" and proceeded to pick out the shrimp to eat that alone. (And, because the boy was watching and listening:  He decided that he wasn't keen on it either)  Ah, at least there was some champagne left over so we could enjoy a couple mimosa's.

Absolutely fabulous!  I doubled the recipe (for company) and everyone ooh-ed and aah-ed over this one.  I LOVE the shallots in this recipe.  Fortunately I increased the shallots (used 1 whole shallot for a double recipe) and it was just delicious.  Easy to make, too!  AND the leftovers were even better reheated the next day!

The sauce wasn't our thing.  Only change I made was I didn't use mushrooms (we don't like them).  Either it was too much or something was missing, we aren't sure which.

My husband,who does not cook, made this for me last night. He followed the recipe word for word and the results were out of this world!!!  Perhaps it was the mere fact that my husband made me a meal that made it taste so good but I have saved this to my recipe box and will not change a thing. I cant wait to have it again!!!!!  Its beautiful too - a great dish for company!

Husband looooved this recipe.  It was great to use up some champagne we hadn't finished yet.  Made it with gluten-free pasta, and still yummy.  You can't go over the 8oz of pasta, though, without increasing the sauce.

OMG! This was spectacular! I also added garlic (two cloves) as suggested by other members. I also decided to make this as a surf n turf rendition with the addition of chicken tenders chopped into bite-sized pieces. I can't even describe how good this was, try it, you won't be disappointed. Leftovers didn't last long at all... unusual in my home where they sit for days until thrown out. Thanks Tricia, this was great!

Definitely a keeper. I make this when I have company as my husband does not like seafood. I suggest using uncooked shrimp or not cooking the shrimp too long as the few times I have made it the shrimp was overdone. This recipe is good but different.

This would have been better if I wouldn't have cooked my shrimp as long.  I guess my shrimp were on the small side.  I'll probably make again, though.

Disappointing...I would not fix this again. It was blah and very sweet. I really was looking forward to it too because so many others had liked it. It needed something, but I don't know what. Weird recipe.

YUM-MY! This recipe is great!  Tastes like something you would get at a nice italian restaurant.  Didn't have shallots so used sweet onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  Took another reviewers advice and sauteed onion/garlic with mushrooms.  Used a Brut champagne.  Was excellent! Will make again.

Very very delicious.  Two things to watch out for 1. The champagne caught fire when I put it in the frying pan causing the fire alarm to go off!  Be careful!  2. You should eat this right away... don't wait even a minute because it cools off quick.  Better yet, serve it on a heated plate.

I added scallops to this recipe and it really turned out very well.  I served it for a small dinner party (4 people) and it was the perfect amount.  My only complaint would be that it was very, very very rich.  I think it would be better as a primi or starter plate than as a main dish.  The champagne lent a nice flavour but I think it would be as good with wine or even vodka.  I served the leftover champagne to our friends as they arrived and kept what I needed for the recipe.  Your friends will be impressed!

This was amazing! Becareful not to use too much pasta. I used my favorite wine, and also made it a second time substituting shrimp with scallops. This is definatley a favorite!

This recipe is perfect! I will make it again. It's easy to make and tastes wonderful. Everyone in my family loved it, even my mother, who is very hard to please when it comes to cooking. I did not use Parmesan cheese, I think the taste is rich as is. I recomend this to everyone.

This recipe was good and easy to make. The only complaint I had was it was actually a little too sweet for myself. Maybe it was the champagne that I used. My husband loved it.

This was really good; We have some cherry tomatoes that I didn't want to go bad, so I used those.  I also used wine (riesling) and it turned out delicious.  Easy and quick to make and the result tastes like something you would buy in a restaurant!

Very delicious, however I did add about 1 TBsp of sundried tomato pesto, about 5 chopped sundried tomatoes and I used about 4 canned plum tomatoes instead of fresh, my husband is already inviting people over for supper so they can try this dish!

Very enjoyable.  I used white wine instead of champagne.  I also added a little cornstarch to the sauce as other reviewers suggested.  My family enjoyed it.

I served this to a couple of friends and they raved about it.  It was so simple to prepare and absolutely delicious.  I used white wine instead of Champagne, and did not toss with more cream (not necessary unless you don't mind the extra calories).  A real treat!

I think that I should have opted for a better champagne because the flavor was definitely strong.  Also - it came out kind of soupy.

I added three cloves of chopped garlic to this and added green onions instead of the 
scallions as I had a hard time finding them at my market.  It is very good and
my husband requests it all the time.

I read all the other great reviews and was very excited about trying this recipe.  It lived up to the hype!  This dish is fantastic, all my guests raved about it.  There are so many small changes you can make, but it is great the way it is.  I have been telling everyone about this recipe!

A great recipe. I made it for our Valentine's dinner and my girl friend and I just couldn't believe how good it was. And quite easy to make too. I use and dolce Asti wine which gave the sauce a nice sweetness. Think I'll make it for my parents this weekend. Thanks again for the recipe

Very Yummy.  I screwed up and did not thicken the heavy cream before adding the mushrooms and shrimp. As a result the sauce was a little thin, but it was very good.  I can't wait to try this again the correct way.  Thanks.

This dish tasted just like something served at a five-star restaurant... Because I doubled the amount of sauce, there was some leftover and my husband felt really special for having a "fancy restaurant" leftover meal for lunch! A keeper!!

I loved the flavors - very rich and simple to make.  The kids opted for the pasta only and a bite of shrimp.
