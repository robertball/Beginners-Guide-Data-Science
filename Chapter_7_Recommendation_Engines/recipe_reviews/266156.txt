Excellent and that is coming from a non feta lover! This recipe tames the strong flavor I do not care for. The block of feta had a much better texture than the crumbled I typically buy too. The only negative thing I have to say about this recipe is the chile pepper. Unless you make a slit in it or slice it in half, the flavor will never come through. Made as written and I am giving this 4 stars. Slit your chile and it is an easy 5 stars.

Served them with some fresh herbs. Really good with bread.
