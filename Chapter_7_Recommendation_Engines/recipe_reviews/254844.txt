I was handing these out to adults that were out trick or treating with their kids and it was a HUGE hit! For the lemon I added pineapple mango Svedka, for the orange I added mandarin Orange Absolute and the for the clear I added Captain Morgan. The lemon and orange kind of blended together in color, so next time I may add a little yellow food coloring so it stands out a bit more. For the top layer, I used boiling water instead of warm and I also heated up the rum a bit as well. All the adults said they were the the BEST Jello Shots they ever had! Definitely will make these again next year!

These were a HUGE hit!  I recommend doubling the recipe for the yellow and making the yellow layer fairly thick in the cup. I poured such a thin layer you could barely see the difference between the orange and yellow layers. Also, for the orange layer we used mandarin flavored vodka.

Layers one (yellow) and two (orange) were great. I used peach vodka - yum. Layer 3 (white) completely failed. For starters, not only did it not make enough to cover all 24 of my shots (the other layers worked out perfectly), the gelatin didn't dissolve, leaving huge chunks of gelatin in the mixture and it therefore never set. Also, the clear rum made the overall shot way too strong. You also need to serve these with a spoon. About 6 of us still drank/ate these and most reactions included some wincing over how strong they were, but my guests said they were tasty. With a dollop of whipped cream on top and a few candy-corns sprinkled, the presentation was really beautiful. But next time, for the final layer, I would omit the rum (there's plenty of alcohol in the other two layers), use HOT water, not “warm,” and double to recipe to cover all 24 shots.

These were awesome!  I don't like vodka so I used Silver Tequila for the lemon jello and for the condensed milk, and for the orange jello I used Triple Sec. They tasted like very strong margarita's!

Overall great, but I'm not an expert gelatin maker.  It took me a re-do on the top layer to get it right. I heated up the liquor a bit, added it with the warm water to the unflavored gelatin then strained any thicker gelatin chunks out before adding the warmed milk to it. This fixed my problem, but preparing it as the directions read, I ended up with chunks of gelatin in the sweetened milk that I could pour off the other layers.

I had trouble with the top layer jelling. I ended up having to scrape it off and just put whipped cream for that layer. They were a hit at the party. Next time I would add orange food coloring to the orange jello. You had to hold them to the light to see the different colors.

The yellow and orange were very strong and the top layer never set. I'm making again but trying a little less alchohol. I'm try 3/4 instead of a cup each.

I made virgin shots and well as the vodka shots and put candy corns on top of the virgin ones to separate them. Also I used whipped cream for the white part of the shot.
