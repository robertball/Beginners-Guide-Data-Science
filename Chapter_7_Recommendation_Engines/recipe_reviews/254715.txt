Wow! What a great new way to enjoy a hotdog! The sweetness of the pushcart onions and salty goodness of the thick cut apple wood smoked bacon i used REALLY made this dish! We LOVED it!!! Thanks!

I love onions but couldn't find the push cart onions in my area so I used the chili. These were great and one I'd do again!
