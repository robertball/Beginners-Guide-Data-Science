I changed this recipe slightly to add more flavor.  I added a teaspoon and a half of minced garlic, and added creole seasoning and seasoned salt to taste.  With these changes, it created a delicious flavorful main course with no leftovers!

This was ok but pretty boring. I would personaly rate it only 2 stars but my husband and son liked it. The only change I made was to use low fat sour cream instead of yogurt. I will make it again because it is quick and simple and with picky eaters at home boring is sometimes the easiest but I will definitely make some changes to try to add more flavor

This was good and easy to put together. I think it needed some pepper. Will add that and maybe some garlic powder next time. I used a pkg of chicken tenders and cut into thin bite size pieces. I used sour cream for the yogurt.

This was so tasteless. I had to add a lot of salt and still no real flavor.
