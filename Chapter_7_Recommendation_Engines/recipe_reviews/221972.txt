I made the broth exactly as directed except I forgot the bay leaf.  I added the seafood that is available in Baltimore in October..... little neck clams, snow crabs, grouper, mussels and bay scallops.  It was very simple but very elegant and tasted like a high priced restaurant cioppino!!!  The lemon is a must but a couple of slices goes a long way.  I did add some chili oil in addition to the red pepper flakes to wake it up.  I have made many cioppino recipes and this was my favorite by far!  Crusty sourdough bread is required by law.

This is one of the best recipes here on AR.  Chef John, you hit the nail on the head with this one.  I followed the recipe exactly beside cutting the recipe in 1/2 for the 2 of us.  I used about 1 1/4 lbs of fresh shrimp, 1 large claw of large snow crab, 1/2 lb mussels, and 1/2 lb cod filet, all fresh from Joe Patti's here in Pensacola, FL.  We didn't care for the cod fish so when I make it again I'll leave that out and use all mussels, shrimp and crab.  It's not cheap but it's truly a treat to be savored more than once in a lifetime.  I had this back when I was a teenager and loved it then but just never seemed to have the nerve to make it myself.  I am sooo very glad to have found this recipe.  I had some fresh french bread for dipping in that lucious sauce.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thank you again Chef John for a wonderful recipe.  *** 1/13/15 - I've made this many, many times since I've reviewed this and now I make the whole recipe of the sauce and 1/2 it and that goes in the freezer.  I also don't use any lemon as we don't like hot lemon in anything, but the rest of the recipe is spot on!

This may be the single best recipe on Allrecipes.com. It is flawless in its simplicity and as natural in its ingredients as any on this site.  The recipe is easily adaptable to your personal taste or to moderate variation of ingredients.  I served it in a bowl with a variety of warmed breads and Irish butter.  On the side I served Spicy Eggplant over seasoned white rice.  The scent of the garlic and Chardonnay rich
Cioppino filled the house and I prepped my guests with Starry Night Zinfandel and butter crackers with lobster, red caviar and garnishes.  This is a wonderful recipe for a husband-wife or couple to prepare together.

It was tough to make a recipe and stick to it, but I only made very small changes to this one. Instead of water I used chicken broth, but only because I needed to use it before it went bad. I also skipped the Dungeness crab, as I wasn't sure how to clean it and wanted to keep things simpler for myself. 

That being said, this recipe was awesome. Very flavorful and perfect with the fresh baked bread I served it with. 

I'm fairly sure that the person who said it was too sweet must have used a sweet wine (like a moscato or white Zinfandel), as mine wasn't sweet at all. I used the same Sauvignon blanc that I drink regularly and it turned out great. Not sweet at all. 

I couldn't find tomato purée at my grocery store, so I bought the tomato sauce that that didn't have any other ingredients than tomato purée and water. Be careful, though. Most tomato sauces had all kinds of extra seasoning added. Read the labels!

This was my first time working with live mussels. Make sure you clean the  outside of the shells and the easiest way to de-beard them is to use a paring knife to pull the beard against your finger and up out of the shell. Also, if you have any mussels in your bunch that are open and won't close back up that probably means the mussel is dead and you want to discard it. 

My only regret was that I didn't make a seafood stock from the shrimp I peeled (I bought large shell-on deveined shrimp) to add in place of the chicken stock I used out of necessity. 

Very good.

This is another great recipe by Chef John. I have tried other Ciopinno recipes and this is my favourite. Love the lemon and chile peppers! Will make this for my next dinner party!

Great recipe.  Had unexpected dinner guest and a leftover crab so made this.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. 

Added a pinch more spices. Didn't have cod so used salmon. Decreased amount of mussels and shrimp and added octopus and clams.

I've been wanting to make this forever and was waiting for a special occasion; the ingredients are on the expensive side.  Everyone at the party LOVED it!!  This tastes even better the next day!  The only change I made to the recipe was replacing the crab with bay scallops since I didn't want anyone to have to deal with the crab shells. Seriously people, I'm new to cooking, and Chef John makes me look like a champ!! Mahalo Chef John!!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!!

A new go to recipe. Used puree tomatoes & diced tomatoes (canned with basil and thyme), tilapia, fresh clams, shrimp with heads on (heads add unique flavor). Left out crab for fear it would over power other ingredients. Simmered tomato sauce for two hours, let cool and then re-heated adding seafood. Recommend adding clams first since they take longer to open. Allow 3-4 minutes with calms only, then add shrimp (wait one minute) and then add fish last. I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before adding. Cook 3-4 minutes after fish added. Turn off heat, remove shrimp, peel for your guest (messy and hot).  Temperature of soup will be perfect by the time you have peeled shrimp and cooled your fingers. Return shrimp to soup. Serve over fresh linguini (yum). Serve with warm sour dough bread. The longer tomato sauce simmer and reheat thickens to stew consistency and allows the sauce to stick to the noodles. You could serve over rice or simply as a stew and dip bread. Glad I discovered this new dish!!!

Very good! It is easy to make, well explained and just very good if you are a seafood lover! It is a little pricey but fun to make and well worth it. And don't forget the bread, it's a must

This was behind delicious and very simple to make. I do the feast of the seven fishes every Christmas Eve and it's hard to pull it al together with so many different dishes going a once. I  decided to go easy on myself this year and put four of the fishes into this stew (my family won't let me get rid of the lobster, crab legs or calamari). I ended up using shrimp, white fish, clams and muscles but you could literally use anything you want. I will cut back on the cayenne even more as it was very spicy with even half of the suggested amount. Other than that this was wonderful and I will make it again next year.

I've made this several times, it just keeps getting better! Left out the lemons last time, added some clam juice for more seafood flavor. Used chicken broth in place of water. I always add more of the spices than called for, so an extra bay leaf, oregano and basil make it great for my Italian family. Mangia!

Yet another amazing recipe by Chef John! The only change I made was to use all mussels, no other seafood. I think any seafood combo would work in this dish. One of my children went for fourths!

I have to exclude the garlic due to my husbands allergy but even without it, this recipe is fantastic.  Good amount of spice and depth of flavor.  Definitely making this again and my guests asked for the recipe!

Yes I tried it as written, but I did do one little tweak to it.  I shaved 5 slices from a bulb of fennel(anise)and added the slices just before the 35 minute cook time.  I had fennel in cioppino in Fort Collins, Co. and it was the best I ever had!  This is a close second!

The lemon rind and oregano gave the broth a bitter flavor, so I added a teaspoon of sugar.  Used chicken broth in place of water, and also added a teaspoon of fresh thyme.

The aroma and first bite took me back to San Fransisco, an incredibly grouchy chef and an amazing cioppino. (couldn't find a bay leaf; didn't care). Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe is wonderful! My family loved it and said it looked like something from a fancy restaurant. The only thing I did different was add scallops and used 2 snow crab clusters. 5 star recipe!

Delicious light tomato sauce. I made this with mussels, little necks, cod and shrimp. Dungeness crab was not available. this cries out to be served with linguine NOT rice. Super flavor. you won't be disappointed.

My first attempt and my husband said I should make this every weekend! He loved it! Made for my friends last weekend and they gave me a 10/10! 

Some substitutes: I used fennel instead of celery; boil the prawn shells & heads to get the 2 cups of water. 
Had the stew with sourdough baguette toasted with gremolata butter, and paired with Riesling wine. Superb!

Thanks Chef John! Your recipe is easy to follow and gives me confidence to cook again!

Stuck to the recipe. It was full of delicious flavors. It wasn't soupy. Don't forget the bread!

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner. He raved about it. I used scallops in place of the crab, but I think just about any seafood would work with the broth/sauce, it's just adjusting the cooking time on the type of seafood you use. Will make again.

Great recipe, next time I will thicken it up a bit more with tomato paste and sub a meatier fish or scallops for cod.

This recipe has become our New Year's Eve tradition. Absolutely delicious. I make mine a little spicy with more red pepper flakes and definitely use seafood stock instead of water. It's a hit with family and friends.

Love this recipe...Tastes rich and delicious.
I used frozen seafood medley as I had it on hand. My homemade tomato puree is a bit thinner than usual so I omitted the water. Very rich and tomatoey.

Great base to start. Added some sugar, red curry powder and saffron to richen it up. Also used stock instead of water. Very good. Another great recipe by John.

This cioppino recipe was so great and simple to follow! I made it and used more mussels since our market had a smaller selection. I also didn’t have white wine but had a good dry rosé and it worked great!

Made this tonight for dinner...so good.  Used the chicken broth as per tweaks suggested by other reviewers.  Everything else was as per Chef Johns recipe- although I did not have crab.  Flavour was fantastic and timing was exactly right.  Thanks again Chef John, always able to count on your recipes.

Very good- used same seafood (possibly less cod) as recipe calls for, but used only one cup of wine, 2 cups chicken broth rather than water.   Sauce was a bit thicker and less broth like - perfect for dipping garlic toast made with olive oil and fresh garlic.

Tasty dish.  I used the seafood we had on hand (scallops, imitation crab meat and shrimp).  Next time I would splurge and get real crab meat. I didn't use mussels because my husband is not a fan of them   I put too much chili flakes in it so it was a little too hot for some.  Easy to make.  I can see making the broth ahead of time and adding the seafood when you are ready to eat.  This recipe made huge portions.  Would be good for a crowd.

WOW, what a dish! It makes a tremendous amount of sauce so next time i'm  going to eliminate (1) C of water and (1) C of white wine.
