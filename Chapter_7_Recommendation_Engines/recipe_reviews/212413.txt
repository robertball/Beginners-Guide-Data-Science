Oooh baby, what kicking flavor! I can't have dairy, but this makes me feel like I'm sinfully cheating. I thought the one packet of stevia wouldn't be enough, but I was wrong. I would also consider using 8th Continent Light Soymilk (plain); it is quite sweet and yummy. I think next time I will add the dry powder last so it doesn't coat the blender. Yummy!

My daughter loves the frappes - this is a way less calorie version and just as good - only change I make is to only add 1 T cocoa and 3 t coffee - just a personal preference.
