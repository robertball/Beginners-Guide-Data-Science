Seems weird to review my own recipe but I had to make a subsitution last time I bake these that is worth sharing.  First these are my families favorite cookies.  I was making up a batch and realized I didn't have any molasses.  I used pure maple syrup instead and heaped the spices a little more than I usually do.  To my surprise they were quite good.  My youngest daughter wouldn't even try them because they were a golden color and not brown like "gingernaks" are supposed to be.  Eventually she gave in and loved them as much as the originals.

These were WONDERFUL! Since I'm switching to whole wheat recipes, I've had to get rid of most so many white flour recipes! But I'm SO happy to not have to give up gingersnaps, which I LOVE! I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 cup butter. I switched around the ginger & cinnamon amounts because I love cinnamon! Baking time was 8 min. I might chill the dough before baking as the dough was kind of hard to roll into balls. Thanks for a keeper!

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I work in the bakery on my college campus and I made these for the director of the dining services once and that was that - now they're on the regular menu and I make them for students all the time :)

I was a bit puzzled by these cookies.  When I tasted them fresh from the oven, something about the taste seemed "off".  But then the longer they sat out (I didn't even cover them, they were so moist) the better they tasted.  My ultra-picky boyfriend tried one and said, "It's sandy inside," but my father LOVES them.  They are very filling cookies and have a nice, complex flavor.  The sugar on top of the cracked surface is very pretty.  I like how they're thick and chewy, plus somewhat healthier with the whole wheat.  The only modifications I made were adding one cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, plus a little less flour than called for.  Check them early because my first batch burned.

These were great! I like chewy cookies and these fit the bill. My hubby and two littles ones loved them too! They are very spicy and delicious. Be sure to let them cool completely before storing them as they have a tendency to stick together if too warm.

This is a wonderful recipe! No one could tell that it was mad ewith wheat flour. I made a few alterations: I used 1/2 cup of honey, 1/2 cup of splenda, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the white sugar in this recipe and it turned out great!

Excellent and thanks for sharing. The cookies are moist and delicious, sometimes I add soft candied Ginger for an extra kick. Every time I make this, usually at Christmas for my husband, I buy a new bottle of ground ginger. This guarantees great gingery cookies.

YAY!!  A homemade ginger snap recipe that we love!!  The Hubster & I are both BIG fans of ginger snaps and these hit the spot!  The spices are perfect and we devoured nearly two dozen in one evening.  :)  I took the advice of another reviewer & used apple sauce for half of the butter called for.  It was the only change I made & it worked out great!  I'm sure the full amount of butter would only make these more awesome, I just wouldn't eat as many!  :P  I halved the recipe and my batch made 36 perfect sized cookies.  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!  Will make again & again!  :)

This is a great recipe, I love this cookies, I make the recipe to 30 servings and change 1/2 cup molasses and 3/4 cup white sugar by 26 packets of Splenda and use margarine light.  This recipe is great to diabetes people and syndrom X.

WOW! Hands down the best gingersnaps Ive ever made! I prefer this recipe over my grandmothers' that I make every Christmas!  Thank you for sharing.  I find it hard to have a good tasting cookie when there is any amount of whole wheat flour added... and in these I cant even tell!  I am excited to share these with my family Christmas eve.

THESE ARE SOOOOOOO GOOD! I made the following changes: subbed half of the butter for unsweetened applesauce and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. I used a melon baller, so my cookies were smaller than normal, but a great size for an after dinner cookie or small snack. I dipped some of the cookies in sugar for decoration to see the difference. While they do look prettier (think fairy princess), it's an unnecessary step. To get the cookie crisper, you can also mash them with a spoon a little. Mine didn't change shape from the time I put them in the oven. Thanks for this amazing, non-guilty pleasure!!

A new family favorite!  My 6 year old has asked me to make them twice since the first time.  Perfect recipe just as is, and less guilt with the whole wheat.  I have also tried the maple syrup substitution, which gave them a slightly milder flavor, but still wonderful cookies.  Thanks, Mrs. Daycare!

Let me say up front: I am not a good cookie baker. I'm always afraid they will be underbaked and so I consistently overbake them. However, I made these exactly as written (save for the cloves, which I don't care for) baked them for the full 15 minutes and they are absolutely PERFECT!!! Yay me! I wish I'd had coarse sugar, as that would have shown up better after baking, but they still have the perfect cracks and taste great! I love this recipe and thank you for posting it!

I made these  for a book club cookie exchange, we ended up getting completely drunk on wine and digging into the boxes of cookies.  Everyone went crazy for these and we ate ALL of them in about an hour.  I have been searching and SEARCHING for a whole wheat flour ginger cookie that tastes as delicious as its regular flour counterparts.  THIS IS THE ONE!  MY GOD!    Cooking them for exactly 10 minutes made the perfect cookie.  I shorted the flour a tiny bit and didn't add as much molasses, simply because I didn't have what I needed. I replaced it with maple syrup and it worked brilliantly.  
This batch made me over 75 cookies.  PERFECT recipe for a cookie exchange/ christmas time gifts.  CAUTION:  If you get drunk you will eat all of these cookies. Sidebar: they're just as delicious sober.

I needed to make a few adjustments because of a shortage of ingredients. I halved the recipe, but didn't have enough molasses by about a 1/6 of a cup and used sorgham molasses instead (found only in the South. It's not quite as sweet) and next time I might add more spiceage. Same amount of ginger and nutmeg, but a little more clove and cinnamon. My cookies felt like they had wheat bran in them due to the course cut of my whole wheat which while exceptional in bread, made for a cookie with a bran-y texture.

These were good.  I got several compliments on them.  I'm trying to get away from using white flour as much as possible, so this was a perfect recipe.  My only problem was that mine seemed to be a little flat.  I'm going to give it a second try to see if I can make them thicker.

They're not bad. I used maple syrup and added more cinnamon, which was fine, but they still tasted a little wheaty to me and were more thick, than chewy. I really wanted a nice chewiness to it, but didn't get that. Maybe it needs more butter or something?

These tasted amazing, and were very easy to make either crispy or chewy. I made them without the ground cloves.

I used Blackstrap molasses, that might have been a bitter mistake but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Chill dough in fridge in between batches, makes it easier to roll in your palm. My slightly chewy cookies were about the size of a truffle prior to cooking 11 minutes @ 350 degrees. Also rolled entire cookie in pure cane sugar rather than just the top as the recipe suggests. My toddler LOVES them - and I love being able to give him homemade cookies made from whole wheat flour! Will try next time with a different kind of molasses or perhaps maple syrup as the recipe "owner" suggests in her updated review.

What can I say about this recipe?  I have been looking for a soft ginger cookie for nigh onto thirthy years....something to rival a cookie I used to enjoy as a child.  In this little number I have finally found it and more!  My childhood cookies were not made with whole wheat, so that was an added bonus! These are TO DIE FOR!  Just like Goldilocks said, these are "Just right!" Spicy, Chewy, Moist and DELICIOUS! Thank you ever-so-much!  My only caviat is to make sure your whole wheat flour and spices are not stale, which might be why one reviewer said they were sandy.  Given that the ingrediets are fresh, this recipe is excellent as is with no changes to the recipe. YUMMY!

Never made these before - will definitely make the Christmas cookie list this year:)  Tried them out, as a friend requested SOFT ginger snaps as a birthday gift.  (I always make people their fave cookie for their birthday.)  The dough was a royal pain in the neck, though.  Followed the recipe to a T up until I started working with the dough.  Ended up adding another 1/4 cup of flour.  Wish I'd known I needed to chill the dough first because I really didn't have time for that.  However, they're a hit at home, and with my birthday friend!!

Awesome. Loved the whole-wheat flavor. My boyfriend claimed he could tell they were "healthier" but he still said he loved them and they disappeared pretty fast!

I do not like molasses and gingersnaps are not a favored cookie in my home.  I made these for an exchange and had to sample before they were deemed good enough to share.  These are AMAZING.  The whole wheat mellows the "snap" of the molasses with out losing any of the flavor.  I will not only be making these again, but will be making a batch for my family to keep this afternoon.

Great recipe, however I thought 1 T baking soda seemed odd, so I used 1 t.  Also used raw sugar, which doesn't always work in some cookie recipes, but terrific in and on these.  I love the way the larger grains look and taste on the finished product as well.  Thanks!  It's a keeper:)

These were delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  I baked the first batch at 12 minutes---too long.  I made the second batch at 10 minutes and they were prefectly soft and chewy.  My coworkers loved them!

Very tasty! I did substitute applesauce for half of the butter and my batter was rather sticky even after refrigerating, but these cookies turned out great!

Easy to make, delicious to eat! I switched out the 1-1/2 cups of white sugar for 1 cup brown, 1/2 cup white, and then used turbinado sugar for decoration. I also used a full flavor rather than a mild molasses. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this cookie.  I found like another reviewer a "sandy" taste when fresh from the oven but disappeared once cooled.  I think this is the whole wheat flour.  I have had better molasses cookies but I liked that this one was with whole wheat flour.  there was something I can't quite put my finger on - they were almost too sweet, with a very strong molasses taste.  Could have been the molasses I used too (dark). Overall a very good cookie, thanks!

I made these for a pregnant friend who was having bad morning sickness. When I was making them, I ran out of molasses, so I used honey to make up the rest (it turned out to be about half and half). I also added  ground ginger to the sugar and rolled the balls in that.  I made them again for my family, this time with all the molasses and I found the molasses flavor too strong (I use blackstrap, though, so that could be why).  Everyone who has tried any from the first batch has said they are the best ginger cookies they have ever had- ever. I would have to agree. These will be a staple in our house. Thank you for a most excellent recipe!

I made this recipe without any changes to the ingredients or measurements, except that I opted for unsalted butter and I ground up allspice, clove, and nutmeg in a coffee grinder, which I think provides a little stronger flavor than pre-ground. It was easier to roll them in sugar than just dip the tops.  I also baked them on parchment paper so they are easier to lift off the pan. Warm, they were a little chewy in the center and had a nice crunch around the edges.  I stored them right away in a tupperware, so hopefully they will retain a little bit of that chewiness when they fully cool off.  

I love that this recipe uses whole wheat flour, and I am keeping these in the regular rotation.

Yummy! I did follow some substitution suggestions. For example the butter and applesauce. I do agree that it is hard to make into balls....so i chilled the dough :) Wonderful for the holidays, both the taste and the aroma of them baking!

I halved the recipe and it turned out great. The dough was really sticky, so I ended up using 2 1/2 cups ww flour instead of 2 like the halved recipe called for. They baked for about 8 minutes and turned out perfect - moist and slightly chewy. Will definitely make again!

I just made this and loved it. It came out a little more molassesy than I expected but it still tasted great. I changed it just a little on a whim. While getting the spices from the cupboard I saw my container of cayenne powder and thought hmmmmm. :) I added two teaspoons of cayenne and the result was remarkable. The warmth of the cayenne went so well with the other spices. Of course you could divide your dough in half and just add a teaspoon to one half, but I think I'll be adding cayenne regularly from now on. I also flattened them a bit after the first batch and left them in for the full 15 mins because I wanted crispier cookies. Thanks mrsdaycare for such a great recipe. Oh one more thing. I forgot these were 100% whole wheat cookies when i was eating them.

I just made these for a work baby shower and they turned out awesome!  Still getting rave reviews from coworkers today.  I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 12.5 minutes on sheets with silicon mats.  I definitely didn't get the "grittiness" others are mentioning by using whole wheat flour.  Perfect with coffee!

Used 1/2 WW and 1/2 AP, I think all WW would have been quite heavy as these were already quite heavy. Cardamom in place of the nutmeg. Use the full baking time plus leave in turned off oven for "snaps" - about 12 mins for a chewy cookie. Will make again, I used to think shortening was req'd for these cookies but this recipe proves that wrong.

I've been making these cookies and I always liked them but this time I made some lucky substitutions when I needed to make cookies last minute with what I needed in the house.  I used half  molasses and half dark corn syrup and instead of all the spices I used the ginger and then put in pumpkin pie spice for all the rest.  My kids and husband said they were better then ever!  I drop them instead of roll them because it's easier and you really can't tell the difference.

FANTASTIC. Many ginger snap recipes contain only ground ginger and cinnimon. The additon fo rthe nutmeg, allspice and cloves made all the difference if you're looking for a spicy cookie.

Nice flavor, but the batter was too moist. The dough was too wet and sticky to roll into balls, so I scooped it out with a small scooper.  The cookies spread out thinly. I added more flour to the remaining batter, and that helped a little.

I suggest adding an extra cup of whole wheat flour to the ingredient list.

Also, I sometimes use a course-ground whole wheat flour that might have worked better.  I'll try it one more time with the courser flour before I delete it from my recipe box.

This recipe is great! I'm Hindu and my family doesn't eat eggs, but we still love good Christmas cookies. I added a stick and a half more of butter, about 3 tbsp of milk, and 2 tbsp of corn starch to substitute the eggs. They tasted wonderful!

These were great.  I made a few changes, but I'm sure that would have been excellent as is, but I don't like to use that much sugar or butter.  I used 2 cups white whole wheat and 2 cups of whole spelt flour as I prefer spelt over wheat.  I used 3/4 cup of raw sugar, 3 TBS of butter and a handful of pecans that I made into pecan butter in my coffee grinder instead of using oil.  I did cut back on the baking soda to 2 tsp.  These were so good - my kids loved them.  I will use this recipe again especially at Christmas time!  Great spice combo.

These are really good.  You can't tell they are healthy.  However, I do mix a splash of water with some confectioners sugar and ice the tops.  YUM!!

These are delicious!! I'm trying to bake more with whole wheat flour (I don't even have white flour in the house) so it was a wonderful surprise to see these.  I altered it just a little, instead of 1 cup of butter I used 1/2 cup smart balance and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, I didn't use the full cup of molasses either just because I didn't have enough, and I didn't add cloves because it's not something I have in the house but they still turned out great. I flattened them on the cookie sheet to make them thin and cooked them a little longer because I like my ginger snaps crispy.  These are great with a big glass of milk!!

Fantastic!  I didn't have allspice so I bumped up the ginger and nutmeg.  I also mixed some sprinkles in with the sugar for the topping and they looked very festive.

These are delicious and easy to make.  Mine ended up chewy but next time I will make the balls smaller and bake longer.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved these. I love finding traditional cookie recipes that taste good using whole wheat flour. I used whole wheat pastry flour so it would be finer and have a less grainy texture as some whole wheat cookies can have.

So chewy! Love it! But watch it closely, do not let it overbake!! I made 3 batches and the best one (the wonderful extra chewy one) took 2 min less than the recipe's time.

These were yummy!  We don't have molasses here, so I substituted 3/4 cup very dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey.  I love a chewy cookie, and these fit the bill.  I loved the whole wheat flour in these... tasted nice.

Excellent, I followed the recipe exactly.  Bake time was about 9 minutes, and it made a HUGE amount (I think around 10 dozen) as I rolled the balls about 1 inch in diameter.  Thanks!

These cookies are fantastic!  They were chewy but you couldn't tell that they were whole wheat.  The spices were just perfect but I did add a bit of topping to the cookie before putting it in the oven.  I put one package of crystallized ginger and 1 cup of white sugar into a food processor and blended it until well mixed.  Then I dipped the cookie balls into the mixture before putting into the oven.  It adds an extra kick!

These were fabulous tasting- even better than my standby whole wheat ginger spice recipe- except dough not as versatile for shaping, merely rolling into balls.

These were okay. I had some wheat flour I wanted to use, and thought I'd give these a try. I needed to add another 1/4 or 1/3 cup of flour, and I advise you refrigerate the dough for an hour or two to make it easier to work with. I also set the oven to 325 and I was glad I did because they would have burned at 350. The cookies flattened out a lot more than I wanted them to... Thanks for the recipe, but I'll stick with the Mom's Ginger Snaps recipe off this site. :)

Mixed feelings!  I made the recipe exactly as given, but am not sure if I used the correct molasses.  I went to the store especially to get some, and there were two to choose from.  The Black Strap Molasses had a label which stated it was for use also in ginger biscuits, etc., and that is what I thought was right then.  However, I really did not like the bitter aftertaste that it left in my mouth, and my husband had the same comment.  The spice was overpowering the ginger for me, but I loved the old fashioned look with the cracking on the top.  This worried me all night, and because I ran out of eggs, I was at the local garage at 06:00 this morning so that I could try it again, this time with variations.  I then used half flour and half wholewheat flour, cut down considerably on the spices, but not the ginger. I left out the molasses totally and used a bit of maple syrup that I had leftover with syrup. This morning's batch came out more to our taste.  I plan to try it once more, with even more ginger, and perhaps less sugar.

Fantastic!  These were some of the all-time best cookies we've ever made.  We bake ours for only 9-10 minutes, so they stay soft.  But they don't stay long!  Each batch is gobbled up quickly.  Try them.

Delicious! Exactly what I was hoping for! The ONLY thing that might make it better is if the cookies were thinner -- it was slightly thick for a hard cookie.

This recipe was great. I mixed all the ingredients and come to find out I didn't have any cookie sheets so I used a 6 cup over sized muffin pan and made 6 huge muffins. These came out perfect....now if I only added raisons. Took a little while longer to cook but completely worth it. taste like bran muffins with a little kick

I liked these and my husband raved. I made them for him especially,since he is a fan of ginger snaps. I did increase all the spices by a half teaspoon. I made homemade masala chai and we dunked them. Now that was quite the flavor combo! Love that they are made healthier with whole wheat flour.

These are a really good Chewy Ginger Snap, unless you forget them and bake  too long, then they are a very good crunchy Ginger Snap!  My only problem was that they didn't turn out as pretty as the picture!  Mine were very flat!  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks MRSDAYCARE!

My grandma and grandpa were skeptical of whole wheat flour but are now believers.  Put some red and grean sugar on them and they are super festive.  Use different colors for different holidays.

These are quite good; using whole wheat flour makes them chewy than regular ginger snaps.  As these are healthier I may make these from now on.

These cookies are now on my annual Christmas cookie list! I was hesitant to use all whole wheat flour, but I'm glad I did. It's impossible to tell! They are soft and delicious. I didn't have ground allspice, but I did everything else exactly like the recipe.

I LOVED these!  They turned out perfect and my husband really liked them.  I put about 3Tb of butter in a 1 cup measuring cup then filled the rest with applesauce.  I used 3/4 c. of Splenda and 1/4 C. of brown sugar.  I also only dipped some of the cookies in the white sugar before baking- it only really makes an aesthetic difference, but the ones without it looked great so I say it's not worth the calories.  I also DID press mine down, otherwise they just got too tall and puffy, but there's not harm in that either.  I loved these cookies- especially all the spices and mollases. YUM!  I Will definitely make these again!

Great cookies - the only trouble is we can't stop eating them and my 3 yr old grandson won't let me have one out of the bag of 12 that he adopted as his own.  I would like to have them taste a little more gingery.  I am going to try upping the ginger on the next batch which I'll probably have to make tomorrow.

My husband asked me to make him some Ginger Snap cookies... I have never made these before...but they turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly how its written. I thought the dough smelled funny but the molasses just really smells strong. 

A couple of things I added at the end. The dough was really hard to roll into balls, it kept sticking to my hands. So I had a plate full of some whole wheat flour and sprinkled the dough with flour first to make it easier to roll, then I rolled it in the sugar. Wonderful receipt I will definitely make these again next year. wonderful taste too!!!

I just baked these cookies. They are very good, however, I replaced 1 Cup of sugar with Splenda to reduce the sugar content. I knew that the soda and powder amts were too much, so I reduced the soda to 2 tsp. and deleted the powder, then added 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten (1 tsp. per cup of ww flour). The cookies rose just fine and taste wonderful. My diabetic husband loves these now that he has sweets he can eat.

This is the absolute best ginger snap recipe I have ever used. I bake cakes and cookies for a living and almost every cookie order I get includes these cookies. People are constantly raving about them. The only changes I have made to this recipe is to up the cinnamon to 1 Tablespoon and add a dash of freshly ground pepper. These cookies taste best the next day when the flavours have had a chance to mingle and will stay fresh for a very long time if kept in a sealed container. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe :)

I used this recipe as a base for a mock ginger snap. To make them super healthy without losing the flavor I made the following changes: coconut oil for butter, two very ripe bananas & 1/4 cup of turbinado sugar for the white sugar and 1/2 wheat & 1/2 oat flour. They were devine! Although this rating isn't exactly for the listed recipe it helped a great deal with making healthy,  flavorful cookies. I intend to make the actual recipe for guest but as for me, myself & I, its a must I cut the calories.

Made these to the recipe, baking for the shortest time in order to have softer cookies.  These are SO crisp!  I can't imagine what they'd be if we'd left them in a few more minutes.  The taste is fine, but will not make these again, as we prefer a chewier cookie.

We made these exactly as written, except we chilled the dough for a couple hours (I didn't have time to cook them right then and this actually made it really easy to roll them into balls), and then rolled each individual ball entirely in sugar. I must admit, we were a little nervous after tasting the dough, it was pretty darn spicy.  But we figured we might as well bake them anyway.  They were perfect!

I like them crispy, but you can adjust the time to make them soft/chewy or crispy. Crispy was def. 15 minutes. My cookies didn't crack on the top. Which doesn't matter at all to me as far as the recipe goes. I did not think the spices were overpowering at all. The dough was a little sticky so I had to dip my fingers in the WW Flour to make roll into ball better. The use of WW Flour does not change the taste but a slight change in texture, even visual texture, but that is expected. I will reduce sugar the next time just because I want to try it that way.

Excellent cookies!  I dropped the unbaked cookie balls into turbinado sugar before placing them into the oven.  The cookies baked up beautifully, all chewy and spicy.  These are the best molasses, spice cookies that I have ever made.  A total winner!

A little too spicy for me so next time I'll drop the spices by 1/4 tsp. However, no one can tell these are whole wheat!

This cookie was OK, but nothing great.  It was grainier than expected.  It would be better to not use all whole wheat flour I believe.  And there was no way these were rolling into balls.  I refrigerated briefly, but still had to add more flour.  But, it's not just the flour that's the problem.  The other spices cover up the ginger taste too much.  If I make again, I will have to try to figure out which spices, other than ginger, I need to cut back on (maybe all of them).  Another problem I had was that the cookies didn't keep their shape, they just melted into large circles.  The cookies stayed chewy after cooking, which was good.  I took some other reviewers advice and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for white.  I like the idea that they are whole wheat, but I think I'd rather have a white flour or mixed flour version that tasted better.

Great recipe! Child friendly as well, they stay nice a soft (with a little crunch on the top from the sugar) so even my 12 month old was able to enjoy them. Since they're made with whole wheat they're not quite as bad for him as some as well. Will definitely make again :)

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written. I reduced the cloves to 1 teaspoon and added 3/4 teaspoon black pepper. I baked my cookies on parchment lined double layer baking sheets, making the balls the size of small meatballs for a yield of 52 cookies. Baking time was 14 minutes for a soft texture. I'll definitely make them again, but next time I'll try adding some orange zest, and reducing the sugar and butter just a bit and replacing with healthier options.

These ginger snaps were fast and easy to make and they turned out SO delicious! I will definitely bake them again for the holidays. Just make sure you don't burn them. I made really small cookies and only baked them for 8-9 minutes. Anything more and they turn out a little burned on the bottom.

These cookies exceeded my expectations.  They were amazing. I froze half of the cookie dough for another day, but my husband and I couldn't stop eating them and I ended up making them anyway.  Making some more today and I can't wait to eat them.

These are delicious! The longer they sit out, the more flavorful they get. They're soft and chewy -- a big hit in my home! I only had to cook them for 5 minutes because my oven tends to run a bit hot. Definitely watch them because as soon as they start to crack on the top, they're done, unless you like them crisp. I also cooled them on wax paper because I don't have wire racks, and they turned out fine. Also, I had to refrigerate a portion of the batch because I didn't have time to cook all of them at one time. The cookies tasted the same as the ones made at room temperature, but they were puffier. I think I liked the flatter ones better. Next time I'll try the suggestion of substituting some white sugar with brown sugar and see how they turn out.

These were so easy to make and came out so good. Although i didn't had nutmeg powder at home and substituted honey for molasses, they were still good !! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

This is the best!  Very soft.  Used a medium cookie scoop, rolled in a ball, then dipped the top 1/2 in sugar.  Will defintely make again.

I gave a batch of these along with shortbread cookies to my in-laws for Christmas and we all loved them. These really snap, but then are also chewy. They do grow in size a lot, so DON'T try fancy cutter shapes...like I did. :)

I added 1/2 tsp salt & 1 tsp vanilla, just because they felt missing from the recipe.  Delicious, crispy ginger snaps!  Better than store-bought & nearly as easy.

First off I'd like to say I don't like gingerbread cookies, but I decided to make these for my mom. I really like them! Especially since I always use whole wheat instead of white flour. I had an issue with them all kind of melting together, but that's fine. I had only half cup of molasses so I made up the other half with raw honey, which could explain the melting. I also substituted raw sugar for the white, which works well since raw sugar has a molasses taste.

These cookies have a very nice flavor.  I use heaping spice measurements and the flavor is delightful.  The whole wheat flour is fantastic! My cookies spread out a lot and are very thin (even after adding more flour and chilling) but they still have a nice texture.  Crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I will make these again.

I am munching on the first batch that came out of the oven (yummm!!) and these are divine.  You can't even tell they were made with whole wheat flour.   This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!  I swapped out the white sugar for brown to make them more chewy, and left out the allspice and cloves (as I didn't have them).  I also added 1/2 tsp of salt.  They did spread quite a bit, but the taste definitely made up for it! Thanks for the keeper!

This is a great recipe!  The cookies turned out moist and soft.  I put the dough into the freezer for 20 minutes prior to rolling into balls.  I also like my cookies soft, so I cooked for 8 minutes.  I made smaller cookies, so one batch produced 120 perfect cookies.  I made some alterations as others have.  I used 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar splenda, and 1/2 cup splenda for baking. I didn't have ground all spice, so I added additional cinnamon.  Even with the alterations this recipe was fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

These are the BEST!!

But the dough is sticky and a little bit tricky to handle; next time I'll try to refrigerate it for an hour to see if it's easier to work with.

Thanks for the recipe!

these were amazing! my fiance couldn't tell they were whole wheat!  I didn't change much with the recipe.  I put about 3 tablespoons less butter because I didn't have time to run and get some more and they turned out fine. I let them bake for 20mins because I like my cookies on the crispier side.

Whoa Momma!  These are great!  A very forgiving recipe since I was low on molasses and had to sub with some brown sugar.  I also didn't have allspice or nutmeg, so I added extra cinnamon, cloves and ginger to make up for it.  The taste was great, you can't taste the WW flour.  9 min. for perfect chewy cookies.

These were almost exactly what I was looking for.  The crack sugar top was lovely, and they were awesomely chewy, almost too chewy. I also had to add more flour to make them workable, and refrigerated the dough before making the balls to roll in sugar. 

Next time I would reduce the molasses,  maybe by as much as half. And at least double the ginger. I might even use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, just to give the cookies a little more body.

Awesome! Very flavorful. Not too sweet but just sweet enough. I think the taste of the wheat flour better meshes with the spices. It's a good combination.

great cookies. very chewy. i had to add more flour to make it easier to work with and needed to put it in the fridge for about a half hour. i made the balls too big so all of the cookies stuck to each other and are HUGE! but that's not a bad thing....

I agree with previous reviewer - spicy and chewy!  There is no snap in them but I prefer these over any store bought ones I've ever had.  Baked them and brought a plate out for card game with friends and there are none left.  They are delicious and easy to make!  I had looked for this recipe because husband had brought home whole wheat flour instead of reg flour (twice!) so I had to find a recipe that uses it up.

These are so good! I handed the recipe. I only had 1/4 cup maple syrup (instead of molasses), but the cookies turned out great! I added chai masala and extra ginger and the spices were perfect! I also used half white flour, half whole wheat and they are great! Check out my picture! I used a gingerbread cookie cutter and they are so cute!!!

I love using whole wheat flour, but have to remember each time I do this recipe, to cut it in half - I do NOT need 60 gingersnaps! I chill this dough for at least an hour, to prevent too much spreading.

These cookies turned out great though I did have to use a combination of white flour and almond flour. I will absolutely make these again again.

Loved these!  I used 14 packets of stevia which is equal to 1/4 cup of  sugar plus  2 pkts,  1/2 c brown sugar, and 1/4 c regular sugar.  And I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.  Everything else I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great!  I know these are not sugar free, but I wanted to reduce the amount of refined sugar a little.  Thank you for a great recipe!

My grandma's favorite cookies are gingersnaps so I wanted to make her some for her 90th birthday. None of the rest of us are particularly fond of gingersnaps, but we all LOVED these! As one review said, they are even better after they cool.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.   I usually use half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  They come out chewy and delicious!

I tried this with all purpose flour instead of whole wheat, but otherwise followed the directions.  Cookies came out paper thin and more like a brittle or crisp than a cookie.  The flavor was good but with a disappointing texture and look.

I've never made gingersnaps  nor baked/cooked with molasses before so I was a little grossed out when I opened the jar and smelled that pungent scent and when I tasted it, I became really ambivalent about making these cookies but, I do like gingersnaps (Thanks to Mrs. McKrell) so, I carried on.  Thank goodness these cookies don't taste much like straight molasses.  The flavor is very nice and they came out chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside, even though I mixed up my baking powder and soda amounts... they just spread a little extra, no big deal.  This is a very large recipe, it made almost 4 dozen, which is not a bad thing except my husband is not sure he likes gingersnaps.  I'm hoping to convert him since there are so many cookies.  I'll be taking a couple of bags to friends as well.  The rest are mine!

I usually find cookies too sweet, so I did not put extra sugar on top with the first batch. My mistake. I used blackstrap molasses and the flavour was too dark. I froze a bunch and did roll the ilittle balls in sugar. I also did not like the way the other spices overwhelm the ginger. Next time I will make this with regular molasses, more ginger, and omit the cloves, nutmeg and allspice.  Live and learn.

I have to say I was skeptical about how these would turn out. Only because they were hard to roll  (mushy dough) and I had to wash my hands several times to roll the balls. I followed the recipe for the most part..the only thing I did different was use brown sugar (didnt have white) and cut everything in half (didnt want  60 cookies) 30 were enough for my family. I would recommend letting the dough sit in the fridge 30 min to hour for easier handling. The end result were excellent cookies these are very spicy...so cut spices in half, if you dont like spicy food or you will have hot flashes like we did. lol

LOVED IT! Really got my spice fix with this recipe. Next time I think I will bake the cookies longer, or use less molasses--I like gooey cookies but not quite this gooey. They stuck to the baking sheet even with Pam spray. They also turned out much larger than I expected. Note to self, make smaller scoops!

Very good flavor!  However I may try half wheat and half white flour next time.  They seem to flatten out as they cool, unlike when made with all White flour.

Everyone in my family likes these--even my husband who dislikes just about anything made with whole wheat flour! My only modifications were very minor.  Instead of measuring the nutmeg, I grated whole nutmeg 15 seconds for a half recipe. I also rolled the cookies in turbinado sugar instead of regular white sugar. The low end of baking time was great for a softer cookie.  We'll definitely have these again!

I added freshly grated ginger and finely chopped candied ginger while creaming the butter. I also cut the flour back by 1/3 cup for a chewier texture. Great flavor and the house smells awesome.  Never too spicy. Everybody that has tried them loves them.

These are very good!  I didn't have molasses, so I substituted maple syrup as suggested by the contributor of this recipe.  I also substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the recipe to make sure it had a good "molasses" flavor.  I dipped them in holiday green and red sugar to be more festive!  Very soft, very good!  Would definitely make them again : )

Everyone who tried these loved them! I usually press the balls down with a fork, but these cookies are so soft that they flatten out if you do this! Just place the ball on the sheet and toss in the oven - they come out perfect!

To cut the fat and sugar content, I substituted 1/2 cup butter for unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup sugar for 1 tablespoon + 1/4 teaspoon of stevia (in packets). Also, they do not need to be dipped in sugar before baking. They are delicious! Thank-you Mrs. Daycare.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did 1/2 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar (instead of all white), and I rolled the balls in sugar instead of dipping them.  They were perfect after only 8 minutes (as soon as the tops were cracked).  My kids are picky about cookies, but they all loved these, as did I!  Definitely going in my regular cookie rotation.

Home run!!!  Definitely heap the spices for that gingery flavor.

I took cookies out of the oven about 5 minutes before they were done and sprinkled additional sugar on tops, then baked them the remaining time.  People seemed to like these extra sugary cookies better than the ones without additional sugar on top.

These cookies get even better after a few days!  Everyone is asking for the recipe and this is now a staple in our home.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Not impressed at all. Clove flavour was too overpowering & these cookies had an odd, gritty texture

I never, ever write reviews, but I had to for these. These are DELICIOUS! I'm not a huge spiced cookie fan, but I do try to bake with whole wheat as much as possible. You would never, ever guess these cookies are whole wheat. I can't eat too many (a good thing, probably) because of the heavy spices, but they are really great cookies that I'll be making for every holiday! And I didn't change a single thing!

Everyone really liked these cookies, and they felt better about them since the recipe used wheat flour.  Definitely chill the dough to make for easier rolling!  Also I only used half the butter and made up the difference with cinnamon apple sauce.  Very tasty and better the next day.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Just made this today and they are great. The dough is very soft and sticky so put it in the fridge for a half hour and could have left it longer to make it easier to make the balls.  They spread out on the pan so make sure you have lots of space between each one.

Just made these. Hard to say what I think about them.  The taste was perfect - nice and spicy.  The texture, not bad.  The edges were hard after cooking and cooling but the rest was chewy.  They were completely flat once cooked, but that could be from over mixing the batter. Any time I hear about flat cookies, I've always been told it's from over mixing.   Cooked them on the top wrack at 300 for 12 minutes.  The batter was quite sticky, too sticky to roll.  So I tried 2 things:  wetting my hands as little as possible so the dough wouldn't stick to me and putting the batter in the fridge in between batches to firm it up.  Both weren't great.  The only other thing I would do next time is to add a little more flour.  When I went to roll the balls with wet hands, the ball was coated in water (of course), and therefore the sugar on the top dissolved almost completely before it was even in the oven.  I think if I make this again I will BOTH put the batter in the fridge for a while to firm it up and add more flour so that the batter is more crumbly.  I'm giving it 4 stars and not less based on my reviews because the end result could've been my fault, not the recipe's.  Overall, worth another shot with some tweaking.

I'm always looking for ways to use our fresh ground wheat flour. We love gingersnaps so I thought I'd try these. They are a strongly flavored cookie (especially when you use high quality spices as I do) which I love. These have a lot more molasses than most ginger snap recipes. The only problem I had with these is that the dough was very soft and they flattened out more than I like. I tried chilling the dough but that didn't help them stay thicker, though it was easier to roll them into balls. I think I'll try tinkering with my old ginger snap recipe but add this combination of spices because I really liked that.

Delicious!  I appreciated the comment about substituting maple syrup for the molasses.  I was 1/4 cup short of molasses and the maple syrup worked perfectly.  Taking them to a picnic with homemade ice cream.  Should be a good combo.

Awesome! Only had 1/2 cup molasses so I used maple syrup to supplement. Also, skipped the allspice because I didn't have any. Use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Very tasty, especially with a cup of coffee.

The tops of these cookies "crackle" much as snickerdoodles do, but with the taste of unmistakable ginger. These are quite spicy for gingersnaps, with an afterbite (kick).

Outstanding cookies!!  I had "pumpkin pie spice" on hand and not all of the individual spices called for in the recipe.  But I looked at the pumpkin pie spice label and determined it contained most of the spices needed. So an alternative spice mixture that I used was: 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice,  1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, and  1 1/2 teaspoons cloves.

awesome cookies! i didn't have molasses, and the store was sold out (can you believe that?!) so i used 3/4c dark karo corn syrup instead, and a little bit of brown sugar. my cookies are still super tasty, soft, chewy, and have that beautiful crackle top. i can't wait to try these with molasses, i bet they'll be amazing!

These are fabulous!  I didn't actually use whole wheat flour (since I didn't have any on hand), and I added a splash of vanilla extract.  I only baked them for about 10 minutes, so they turned out wonderfully chewy and delicious.  A great alternative to "snappy" ginger cookies.  Thanks!

The cookies come out good even with the set back. My dough turned out very sticky so I kept mixing it and my grandma's brand new hand mixer died in the process. I had to add more flour to fix the stickiness. If anyone has an tips let me know.

This recipe was very quick and easy to make!  The amount of spice is perfect and no one can even tell that they're whole wheat! I'll definitely be making these again!  Tip:  I rolled the dough balls in sugar instead of just doing the top of the cookie.  Turned out superb!

Really delicious. I didn't have nutmeg or allspice, so I used extra cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, so they are nice and spicy. I'm serving them to 2nd graders and their parents tonight--I am sure every single one will be snapped up!

Very delicious. Everyone who I made it for thought it was good. If I cooked it longer it would be snappier. If I cooked it for a shorter time, they would be chewier. Both are good.

These are great cookies!  I love that they're made with whole wheat flour, and the molasses adds some nutritional value, too.  But the best part is that they taste so good!  My kids love them.  The dough is quite sticky, so this would not be good for rolling out and cutting into shapes.  But they really do look pretty with the sugar sprinkles.
