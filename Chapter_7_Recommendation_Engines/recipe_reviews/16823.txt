I've made this several times now and it is a favourite!  I brown the onion and celery first, substitute the sour cream with yogurt and add 1/2 tsp each of dill, basil and pepper.  Sometimes I will substitute the zucchini with a package of thawed spinach.  I usually just mix everything (instead of layering) together.

Hmmm...interesting. I had a little bit of a tough time getting passed the weird taste of the heated mayonnaise in this. It's a decent dish, if you don't have cream of mushroom soup on hand to make the real deal. I might make this again, but will leave out some of the mayo next time.

I was looking for a tuna casserole that had something more than just noodles and tuna...and boy, did I find it!!! I've made this a hand full of times since finding the recipes...I add more zucchini than is called for...heck, I probably doubled the recipe for leftovers.  It's a definite crowd-pleaser...served with warm crusty bread...it's a rainy day favorite!

One of the better tuna casseroles I've made.  I did substitute mushrooms for the zucchini.

This recipe is alot like my own except I'd omit  mustard and thyme. I also saute onion and celery until slightly tender.Any pasta will work and any cheese.I add peas and sliced black olives and a can of creamed soup and a little milk. Crush crackers and mix with a little melted butter for the topping.

I was looking for an interesting tuna casserole recipe that didn't use mixed vegetables or condensed soup.  This one called for zucchini which I don't usually make and it sounded good.  Well, it was delicious!  My family went back for seconds.  I will now be making this dish often!

Great and definately not the norm. Changes I made: Added a bit of milk and walnut pieces. To help make this lowfat, I substituted the montary jack with colby/montary jack that comes in 2% milk. The walnuts add yet another taste that blends perfectly. Easy, quick and delicious.

This was too "mustardy" for us. Next time I will cut down the mustard and add more sour cream and maybe a little milk, as it was a bit dry as well. I like that it's not the regular tuna and condensed soup casserole.

I made this last night for dinner.  While searching receipes, this is the only one that didn't require a condensed soup, so I chose this one.  I omitted the tomato and zucchini (didn't have any), added mushrooms and spinach.  Used Dijon mustard (thats all I had). Seasoned to taste while in the mixing bowl.  Added some Worcheschire sauce (copied that from another receipe). As other reviewers mentioned, it wasn't super creamy, but that didn't stop me from eating it. Yummy!!  Will definitely make this again.

A great alternative to the cream soup version of tuna casserole!  It definitely needs at least about a half cup of milk, otherwise it will be way too dry.  I also added 1/4 tsp. basil and dill for extra flavor, but that is just a personal taste preference.  I will use this recipe for tuna casserole from now on.

I used this recipe more as inspiration than a literal recipe.   I used fat free cottage cheese instead of mayonnaise to save on calories and I used fat free sour cream (but ended up adding more than suggested).  I also used twice as much zucchini than recommended and cooked the tomatoes with the zucchini layer (highly recommend).  It came out very creamy and delicious, hearty enough to satisfy my meat-loving starving boyfriend too!  I will definitely make this again!

Half a cup of mayo seemed like a lot, so I used 1/3 cup and increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup, but in the end the greasy feel of the mayo really spoils this recipe.  I might try it again with no mayo at all, but it was a disappointment as-is.

I increased the mayo & sour crm. since I was out of milk and I was out of cheese and I used only 1 can of tuna since I am not a big fan. I also added garlic & chili powder, lemon pepper and juice, & a bit of cayenne pepper. I used canned peas and cut green beans instead of zucchini since that is what I had on hand, waterchestnuts instead of celery and reg. onions instead of green then I topped it generously w/bread crumbs and dots of butter. Baked it covered 20 min and uncovered 15 min. Delicious!!! (Even w/ NO CHEESE!!!) I will make this again and again!!!!

I double the sour cream, mustard and mayo in this recipe.  We've had this with and without grated zucchini.  I'd give it 5 stars with the extra sauce.

Delicious!  I used light sour cream and light mayo since that's what I'm used to, and pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey.  I also omitted the tomato because I forgot to buy one.

Casserole was ok.  It definitely was dry and was missing something...  Didn't use the zucchini as we don't eat zucchini..  but I followed the rest to the T and it just seemed very bland.  Maybe mixing it up with some other spices will help.  It also wasn't as "creamy" as when I would make tuna casserole from mush soup.  I had to add milk becuase it seemed too dry.  May try again.. not sure.

Very good.  I usually read reviews before making a dish here but did so afterward this time.  I used spinach instead of zuchinni and added a dash of worcestershire and then read in the reviews that others did the same.  It is a very good recipe but does need a bit more seasoning such as the worcestershire.

I really liked this since I didn't have to add cream of mushroom, which I hate and always try to substitute something else for it. I'm not really crazy about tuna casserole to begin with, but it is a favorite of my husband, so I thought why not try to make it more to my liking too then? Well even though I liked this version a lot better, he didn't, he didn't like the celery and onions in it at all. So I think next time I'll still use the mayo and sour cream, but just leave out the celery and onions!

The best tuna noodle casserole I've ever made. I was a little skeptical about the use of mayo, mustard and sour cream, but we really liked it and it was much easier than making a homemade cream sauce. I made it with whole grain noodles and a no-drain packet of albacore tuna, and cheddar instead of Jack cheese. I also tossed in some sliced fresh mushrooms with the zucchini. I forgot the tomato at the end, but we didn't miss it. I recommend preparing everything exactly as instructed--don't cook the onion and celery beforehand because they don't need it. The celery came out a little on the crunchy side, but that little bit of cruch is a nice contrast with the otherwise soft, creamy casserole. Definitely will make this again!

I have made a very similar casserole from a magazine with slightly different measurements. 3 cups of rotini instead of noodles. 2/3 of a cup of light sour cream instead of 1/3 cup. 2tsp dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard.  1/2 tsp salt instead of 1/4tsp. The tomato is sliced and placed on the top layer just under the cheese. It has been a family favourite for over 13 years.

I was previously NEVER a tuna casserole fan, but this is redemption for all the bland, flavorless tuna casseroles anyone may have ever had to endure in the past. I chose not to use the tomato and instead substituted  can of ro-tel diced tomatoes and green chilis. It added a surprisingly delightful "South of the Border" flavor, not to mention a most pleasing aroma. A nice tang and spicy "kick" to break the stereo-typical monotony of typical tuna casserole flavors. Can't wait to try it at a pot luck!

Enjoyable!  I did make several modifications to suit our tastes.. 1 can of tuna instead of 2, no celery, no zucchini, no tomato.  Less mustard, more cheese, added 1/4 milk as others suggested, would do 1/2 cup next time, it was a little thick.  Baked covered for first 15 min, then uncovered last 15.  Served with biscuits. Definately will make again.

This recipe was a great variation from the traditional tuna casserole.  My husband and I appreciated the different ingredients.  It was fairly quick and easy, and it was delicious!

A different twist to the regular tuna casserole we're used to.  Next time I might cut down on the thyme, but otherwise a good recipe.  Will use again.

Had to laugh when I came across this because I've been making it for 15 years or more. It was first given to me by a boyfriend of my daughter.  I love it and make it frequently, exactly as the recipe states!  We love it!

Very yummy.  I thought the zuccini would be kind of weird but it definitely was a key ingredient.  Also the fresh tomatoes made this recipe very good.

Well, this is a nice healthy step up from your tuna helper!  I would definitely say to shred the zucchini for texture purposes.  Also, make sure to add at least 1 c. cheese because our was pretty dry! Next time I'll go for the cream of mushroom instead of mayo for creaminess!

Like many others here, I was skeptical about the ingredients putting together this recipe but was absolutely delighted with the results. I have made this twice- once as written and once with 3 very slight changes. As written, it is a 4 star recipe as it is a little dry for my taste. With the addition of  1/4 cup of milk, 1 crushed clove of garlic  and 1/4 teaspoon of dill, as per recommendation of the others here, it is 5 stars.   I made it a second time (with changes) for a weekly potluck when it was my turn to make the main course and everyone raved about the recipe. It is comforting and delicious, yet still quite fresh and light. Great flavour, texture, balance and taste. It's certainly an improvement on the more traditional mushroom soup tuna casseroles of my childhood.   I agree with others- the zucchini and chopped tomatoes are an essential part of this dish. The end result certainly does not focus on zucchini flavour but it adds a great deal.

Don't worry if you don't have most of the ingredients! This is another great change & build upon recipe! Our cupboards were bare and we substituted: yellow onion (saute if you don't want it crunchy, no celery, no sour cream - used cream cheese, blue cheese dressing & milk, basil for thyme, mozz with a sprinkle of parmesan & no tomato. We only had egg noodles, mustard, mayo, tuna & salt. With a little garlic. It was AWESOME. Remember, if you are not using the zuccini &/or tomato, be sure it is somewhat soupy so your mix isn't dry. Be creative! It's a great start!

I like the concept of not using cream of anything.  I made this recipe with the addition of more milk and sour cream because of reviewers commemts on dryness thinking that would solve the problem and it would come out nice and moist, well it didn't. It was still dry and although it was good it still needs refining. Would I attempt it again, yes, but not as written.

I thought this was excellent. the 4 stars are because I did not have all the right ingr.  I had to use sweet onions, no zukes and cheddar since it was on hand. will try again with the right ingr. My sour crm and mayo were non fat and low fat.

Really great flavour! I loved the zucchini - the texture was great.  I even liked the crunchy celery.  I also added dill and milk and garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Plus more noodles. I used light mayo and sour cream to reduce calories.  Tasted amazing!

This is one of those reccipes you have to make exactly as written. Zucchini is exceptional...can't substitute. Flavors bland first day (monterey jack is a mellow cheese), but second day -- one of best dishes I've ever had with tuna. Needs to blend overnight. Don't rate a recipe until you ccok it as desribed (duh!) -- then experiment!

We made this last night and really liked it!  I did make some adjustments based on what we had on hand.  We didn't have sour cream, so I used some crushed tomatoes instead.  This gave the casserole a creamy, tomatoe-y sauce.  I also added some corn, poultry seasoning instead of thyme, and minced onions in place of the green onion.  I also used mozzerella instead of monterrey jack.  Since there are only two of us, I split this into two smaller casserole dishes- baked one and froze the other for a later time.  A great variation on tuna casserole, and easy to customize to your own tastes.

This was excellent!  Did as someone suggested and poured a can of drained chopped tomatoes over the zucchini. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  If you enjoy tuna casserole, you've gotta try this one!!

Amazing casserole. Like the others I added some milk but I also mixed in about 1/2 cup cottage cheese which really produced a great texture. NOT DRY AT ALL!

This was really tasty.  I used low fat cheddar , no fat mayo and no fat sour cream, and a mixture of sliced mushrooms and peas instead of the zucchini.  I took heed of the other reviews which said it was a bit dry, and added a splash of skim milk.  Cooked it covered until the least 10 minutes.

It was good, and so were the leftovers!  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 only because when all is said and done, it's still tuna casserole.

This casserole is awsome. I especially like the zucchini, but my husband does't so I just left it off half of the casserole. This one has gone into the "keeper cookbook". Give this one a try you will be pleased.

OH MY GOD!! This is soo good.  I decided to make this one because it doesn't require using a sauce from a can, and was I right.  I loved it.  My boyfriend doesn't like tuna, but, he sure ate this.  I am be making this again and again.

I've been making this version of tuna casserole since I found the recipe several years ago.  I make it exactly as printed, do not feel the need to make any adjustments.  I was looking for something that was not a Campbell's soup recipe.  This seems lighter than the traditional cream of mushroom versions, and I love the tangy flavor the mayo, tomato and zucchini provide.  It is not my kids favorite, but they don't eat the traditional type of tuna casserole either.

This is a fantastic, away from the normal, tuna casserole. I had to make some changes, because I did not have the cheese on hand that the recipe called for. The following is what I did. I doubled the recipe and with that instead of the shredded cheese, I used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese. I did not use the zucchini due to I have a son who does not like zucchini, instead I added 12oz. Package of frozen peas. ( remember, I doubled the recipe make sure to double the recipe ingredients, use amount I listed for subs) I made noodles as directed and I took every other ingredient and mixed it in a large sauce pan and blended all together until cream cheese was melted. I then poured the sauce over the already cooked noodles, and mixed/ blended all together. I put it in a large baking dish in a pre- heated oven at 350 degrees  F and baked for  approx. 30 minutes, just until warmed all the way through and the top began to brown. This fed a family of 5 with 4 of them being very hearty eaters. THEY LOVED IT. thank you for posting your recipe, I would not have been able to make the dish I did with out it.

This recipe was really good, my kids asked for seconds. I did adjust the recipe a little because I didn't have every thing. I didn't have zucchini so I used 1 can of peas, I used Dijon mustard, I didn't have green onions so I just used a yellow onion, I also crushed some saltines on top. I forgot about the tomato on top. Thanks for the recipe!

We didn't care for the combination of flavors in this. The mayonnaise and mustard are the most dominant flavors, and because the zucchini isn't cooked it tastes like a crunchy tuna sandwich.

I love this recipe - I have been using it for 4 yrs now I believe.  I don't like tuna casseroles with creamy soups in them, so this is perfect!  If I'm out of celery I add chopped red peppers.  I've also made it without the layer of zucchini as well.  You really can't go wrong with this - so easy and comes out perfect.  Even my picky family likes it!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Amazing!  This was delicious, and so much healthier without the canned soup .  I used 1/3 cup each of sour cream, mayo and my fat free homemade yogurt.  I think next time I will add double of the sour cream and yogurt, it was a little dry.  I also added dill per someone's suggestion, wonderful!  Next time I will add extra zuchinni, or italian squash which is what I used.  Thank you so much for this idea!

Sorry to say, but we did not enjoy this.  Per another review, I used lemon pepper tuna.  It did add flavor.  I also added chopped garlic.  Good addition.  I think the problem was the thyme.  Too much.  It may, however, have worked w/plain tuna.   Who knows.  DH said it had a funny taste and I had to agree.  May try it again w/plain tuna and less thyme or lemon pepper tuna w/no thyme.

Yum! Don't substitute the zucchini for anything - it's what makes this casserole stand out!

This recipe certainly has good bones, but due to the dryness and the lack of seasonings, it's more like a three and a half star recipe for us. I had to add more sour cream and quite a bit of milk to get it to the saucey consistency we like. I added garlic and onion powders, no salt (tuna has plenty) the juice of a half of a lemon, used low fat ingredients, whole wheat pasta, threw in a can of black beans for extra fiber and topped with Jack Cheese and canned fried onions. All in all, it turned out wonderfully and we enjoyed the addition of the tastey vegetables. Thank you Ann!

Loved this casserole.  A real winner with our family.  Replaced noodles with spaghetti and added the juice from 1 can of tuna to create a bit more moisture.  Agree that zucchini adds texture and thyme is a must. Bravo!

What rave reviews I got when I made this. The zuchinni addition was GREAT. I never have green onions so I just sauted some white onion, I put in 1/2 the mayo and added a can of cream of mushroom soup (since alot of reviews said it turned out dry)and toped it with French Fried Onions to give it a crunchy top. but i think someone needs to take a new picture. for this meal. it doesnt give it justice for how good it tastes!!!

This is a great recipe! The second time I made it I sauteed the onions with some sliced mushrooms and added peas to the mixture. I also mix a bit of cheese in while stirring the ingredients together, then add more on top. My boyfriend said it was the best tuna noodle casserole he's ever had!

I love this recipe!  Made it for the second time last night and again it was easy and fun to put together.  I follow the recipe exactly, except for the fact that I use yellow crook-neck squash instead of the zuccini.  Hub loved it...and so did I!  Yummy leftovers too!  Definately a keeper!!!

Very good!  I used dill instead of thyme & mushrooms instead of zucchini, but followed the rest.  Yummy.  I got a little scared that it may be too dry and looked for a can of cream of mushroom soup to add but couldn't find one.  Glad I didn't. I think I used more than 3 cups of noodles so I added some more sour cream & mayo and it was perfect.  Also I added some potato chips on top of the cheese to give it a bit of crunch (instead of tomatoes) like the old fashion recipe.  My husband insisted on that!  This is my new tuna casserole recipe!

Good recipe. I wouldn't put mushrooms in it...it just doesn't go with tuna.  I added about 1/2 c. milk like everyone else suggested.  I will mix in cheese next time instead of adding it on top. I might also add some croutons to the top layer.

This casserole was easy and yummy. My kids even liked it. I did make some changes. Since it was dry, I increased the sour cream, mayo and thyme. I also added garlic powder and lemon pepper. I ddidn't have zuchinni on hand, so I added a tad more celery and green onions. I also mixed the cheese into the casserole and then sprinkled more on top. In all I probably used about a cup and a half of cheese. I had a hard time putting it in the oven as my 4-year-old kept sneaking bites of it cold, and I must say it would have been awesome on a sandwich. But cooked it was awesome for a casserole. I'll definitely make this one again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  We had some unexpected guests arrive while I was making this the first time, so I was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out. It was a big hit!  I had read the reviews before making this so I had added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk as suggested.  I think it would have been way too dry without it.  I will definitely make it in the future ... and probably make a few at a time so I can have some handy in the freezer for those days when you just don't don't have time to cook!

I LOVE this casserole! I grew up with tuna casserole and always hated it. But this has restored my faith in tuna:) I did tweak it a little just couldn't do the mayo. So I used cream of mushroom soup instead and used pepper jack cheese and added more zucchini. My DH went back for thirds! and asked it be put into the regular meal rotation. The zucchini is the best part! Addendum: I tried this with the Thyme and hated it! I think it is better w/o.

I'm not a giant tuna fan, but my husnabd is and he loved this. I did use the lemon pepper tuna in the pouch and that adds a lot of flavor. I make it with this all the time now. I think it would be lacking flavor if I used regular tuna.

Not bad at all! I used only a tablespoon of mayo and about 3 tablespoons of sour cream (that was all I had on hand) and it was still great. Not dry at all- like many are complaining about. The veggies are a great accent. Add a dash of crushed red pepper flakes before serving for a little added heat.

delicious. made as written, with additions: added red bell peppper and another can of tuna and a little more "wet" ingredients (sour cream and mayonnaise) to mix up the add'l tuna. also added dill weed. Topped casserole with black pepper and paprika. After cooking for 25 minutes, added french fried onions and cooked for last 5 minutes. Very tasty.

Excellent.  I followed as recipe said and it was awesome.  I did layer some of the cheese in the middle rather than putting it all on top and it worked out really well.  Don't leave out the zuchini - it adds awesome texure.

I thought this was fantastic!  Much better than the boring mushroom soup versions you see all the time.  We love tuna so I more than doubled it and adjusted the mayo/sour cream to keep it moist, added a splash of  milk and sauteed half of a large white onion and added it before baking.  I think next time I will also bake the tomatoes in the casserole.  I thought the zuchini was a strange ingredient but it added some great texture.

This recipe was not very good at all.  It was dry and I really think that you need to cook it a little longer than what is called for so the vegetables are tender.

We will use a smaller baking dish for this next time, and also let it be in the oven a little bit longer for the celery. We used a bit less tyme and it was still very flavorful. This is a very "fresh" approach to tuna casserole and we will dinifitely make it again. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I both agreed we were not impressed by this recipe. It was okay, but we would not make again. Did not like the flavor of the sauce, the tomatoes on top did not really go with the rest of the flavors.

Wow!  This was so tasty and good.  I thought the seasoning was just perfect.  Thyme pairs up well with tuna.  The entire family scarfed it down and we had no leftovers and I even had children eating zuchinni and requesting that I make this again!  That doesn't happen often.  Only thing, it did seem just a tad on the dry side.  I think next time I will add some milk and/or increase the mayo and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing this one.

Due to personal preference, I used a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, instead of mayo. I also sauteed some onions, fresh mushrooms, and 1 red bell pepper, then added it to the noodle mixture with some green peas. Wow...the red pepper was delish. I highly recommend trying it. Very tasty recipe. *****

I won't make any other version of tuna casserole anymore. I love that it has so many vegetables. I typically omit celery (don't care for it)and add whatever vegetables I want. I do add about half a cup of milk. This recipe is delicious cold as well!! My daughter and I ate it as a cold pasta salad the next day. Thanks for sharing!!

This was a very good recipe.  Most Tuna Casserole's taste the same but this had a bit of extra flavor to it!  I didn't just taste Tuna so that's a plus.  Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

So this is tuna casserole? I have never had it before, so I thought I would try this quintessential American dish. Since most recipes feature loads of cream of _fill_in_the_blank_ soup, this was an attractive alternative. It was okay, but not something I will make again.  I guess I am just not a tuna casserole kind of girl.  It is definitely a good way to clean out the fridge though…I used peas and mushrooms instead of zucchini and a dill sour cream dip instead of sour cream.  I also topped the casserole with romano cheese.  I had no trouble with it being dry as others did.
&#013
Update! Yummy cold!  Kind of like a fancy pasta salad.  I still don't know if I will make it again, but this gives me incentive, just chilled and without the cheese on top (maybe mixed in).

what a great recipe!  I made it with bow tie pasta, spinach instead of zucc, and put crumbled Ritz crackers/butter as the topping.  It added crunch.  Can't wait to make it again with zucc and cheese.  Thanks!

I haven't made Tuna Casserole for many years.  Then I found this recipe.  WOW!  It sure beats my mom's, which used the usual cream of mushroom soup, tuna & noodles.  No wonder I hadn't made it in years.  This is great with the vegetables - makes for a great palate sensation.

As the reviews indicate everyone has their own 'take' on what a tuna casserole should be like.  I belong to the "no mayo in casseroles" camp but have made casseroles very similar to Ann's variation.  I do like the added veggies and agree with other reviewers who opted for low-fat ingredients where suitable.  I love tuna casseroles - my mother and grandmother didn't make them but I'm a gran'mere who does!

My husband gave this recipe 5 stars or an A+ for "effort".  This is to say that he was glad for something new :)  I did change things up a little but just slightly.  I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles on top and baked the dish with the tomatoes for moisture.  It worked- it was pretty good.  I also added an extra can of tuna and a bit more noodles.

i substituted tomatoes for the zuccini, and i didn't have shredded cheese so i used slices of swiss and provolone. i was also low on veggies so i just chopped a fresh green pepper. and after all that, this recipe STILL came out amazing. it was delicious hot, and made fantastic leftovers, even eaten cold.

This was a huge hit!  I added a big handful of sliced mushrooms I needed to use up and also a can of diced green chiles.  I layered the tomatoes on top of the zucchini before I added the cheese.  Next time I need to take something to a potluck picnic, I plan on making a batch without the zucchini, tomatoes and cheese and chilling it for a tuna-mac salad.  Yummy!

I thought this came out pretty well. Instead of using sourcream I opted for Philadephia cream cheese w/chives. It added a less tart flavor than the sour cream does, just a little creamier.

WOW!  This is my new favorite tuna casserole!  We really loved this one.  I did make a few changes (by accident, I didn't read the instructions carefully enough)....instead of using a whole fresh tomato, I used one can of diced tomatoes and drained off the excess juice, I then layered the diced tomatoes on top of the zucchini...very yummy!  Next time I'll use 2 cans of the diced tomatoes.  Wonderful flavor!

I loved this! 
I didn't have celery and I didn't add zucchini.  I used Cheddar Jack and added about 1 cup of crumbled Lays potato chips to the top.  Also, I added half of a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup.  I forgot to add the tomato but it didn't matter.  It was really good.

We're not really big on tuna casseroles, but this one was very good.  My husband who doesn't like "casseroles" or the whole idea of them even enjoyed this.  He said he gives it 4 stars!  I followed the recipe except I added 1/2 cup milk and used only a pinch of thyme.  I added some garlic pepper too.  Next time I think maybe I would use perhaps even a bit more milk and a bit more mayo because it was just a tad dry.  I'll be making this easy & delicious one again.

I added a little milk as was suggested and I used mushrooms as well as courgettes.  It was good but not great - the flavours just didn't seem to work that well.  It was quick and easy to put together though.

This is a very tasty casserole.  It reminds me of a tuna melt.  I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup of milk.  I also substituted waterchestnuts for the celery, and put the casserole under the broiler for 5 minutes after adding the tomatoes.  Mmmm.

This turned out okay, although I might have liked it better if I wasn't expecting a tuna noodle casserole.  It was uhm... different, although tasty.  The tomatoes on top helped to zest it up alot.

For a tuna casserole with "class", this is the one. Really easy to make but looks and tastes like you took half the day to make it. Would serve to company anytime!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The zucchini gives it a more veggie taste. When I make it again, I may attempt some cream of mushroom in it. Just to see. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this countless times over the years. It's not an original recipe, it is from Canadian Living Magazine. I am glad to find it here though as it is not loading properly on their website and I can't find my paper copy. My partner loves it so I make it to freeze in single servings for lunches.

I made a few small changes- no zucchini and I added Pablo and butter topping to give it some crunch. I sautéed the celery and onions before I tossed everything together. I used champagne dill mustard for a little extra zip. I will make this regularly!

I followed the directions closely because I  typically do not and my creativity doesn't always produce tasty results. My husband and I both loved this tuna casserole and we plan to make it again. When I run out of ideas I always turn to a tuna casserole and next time it will be a welcomed treat, not just a fill in for lack of ideas. I can not imagine not having tasted heated mayo before. I thought everyone has made Chicken Divan or similar dishes. I personally think that canned soup distracts from flavors and leaves a recognizable artificial aftertaste. I have never seen them used in any of the cooking shows but I'm sure I haven't seen them all.

This is a great alternative to cream of . . . tuna casserole.   Made it tonight, only changes were added Worcestershire,  used mushrooms instead of zucchini, and used shell shaped noodles.  It turned out great.  5 stars because it does allow substitutions without changing the basic

This was really wonderful!  I adapted what I did based on what I had on hand, hubby's allergies, and reviews.  Hubby is allergic to zucchini, so I used some green beans that were about to go bad, cut into 1 inch pieces.  I sauted those with the onion and celery, at this point I also added 2 large cloves pressed garlic.  I didn't have egg noodles, I used instead a large Italian corkscrew pasta with ridges.  I had a 12 oz can of tuna, so I used the whole thing.  And I swapped the sour cream and mayonnaise measurements.  I didn't have tomato so instead added a small palm full of capers, drained.  For cheese I used half sharp cheddar and half asiago.  In addition to the salt I added lots of black pepper, 3 shakes cayanne pepper, and 3 Tbsp fine chopped fresh parsley. I mixed in half the cheese with the rest of the ingredients, and then sprinkled the other half on top. Then I sprinkled on 4 Tbsp Italian bread crumbs.  Baked as instructed and browned under the broiler on high for the last 2 mins.  Amazing!  I left out the mustard and put in 1/3 cup of cream because people said it was dry and that they didn't like the mustard flavor.  With all these changes it was amazing!  Really happy to have a recipe that doesn't have cream of condensed whatever in the ingredients list. Thanks so much!

I have made this for years. I like the fact that it is made with mayonnaise instead of a cream soup. It gives it a unique flavor. I sometimes substitute canned salmon. You could even do French cut green beans instead of zucchini.

I liked this dish; a grown-up comfort food. My husband was less enthused. 
I gave it a 4 because the zucchini was a bit firm and it could have used a little more spice.  I used 2 cups of gluten free rotini pasta in an effort to reduce the carbs a bit, otherwise I made it as per the recipe.

Hub took one bite & stopped chewing just long enough to make sure I had saved this recipe to make again next week!
Flavors don't compete but combine to make its own delicious flavor. Plus it's kinda pretty with the addition of the tomatoes.  No changes made for this rating; I might change the vegetable if I run out of zucchini.

Very tasty! I did tweak the recipe a bit, used brown rice pasta instead of egg noodles, shredded mozzerella instead of monterey jack which I mixed in (I didn't layer)added a couple of slices of pepper jack cheese on top (which tasted amazing) and omitted the thyme because I'm not a huge fan. My teen daughter loved it but wasn't a big fan of the crunchy celery & onion bits...I may try cooking them in advance like another reviewer did to soften them up a bit. This had more flavor than any other tuna casserole I've ever had.

My favorite tuna recipe. I'd been using it for years--it came in some recipe box in the mail. I am so glad I found it on here, because I had lost the recipe.  It is such a good way to sneak in a vegetable.  I never add the onions or celery--I love it without them.

Probably the first casserole I have ever liked. I left out the zucchini. When I make it again, I will reduce the cheese, because it added little to the dish. Fast and simple to prepare for even a beginner.

We really enjoyed this dish. My 10 year old granddaughter had two helpings. I only tweaked it slightly...sauteed my onions and celery and used a 16 oz bag of broccoli florets instead of zuchinni. I microwaved the broccoli per the instructions and probably used two cups of cheese instead of one. Next time I'm going to try using water chestnuts in the dish to give it a little crunch. I will make again.

Like some others, I used what I had.  Instead of the zucchini, I used frozen peas and mushroom.  I also added some red bell pepper (didn't like, too sweet for the other flavors) and regular onion.  Since I did not use a vegetable with lots of moisture, I added about 1/8c of milk.  I stirred all the ingredients together and cooked as directed. Very versatile recipe, however I think it would have tasted better as written (without the mustard, didn't meld with the other flavors for me).
Will definitely use again.

This was a pretty great meal.  My husband loved it!  I didn't have some of the ingredients (thyme, celery) and it was still tasty!  Also I used cheddar instead of monterey (another thing I didn't have)  I'll be making this again in the future!

Really really good. Going to double the recipe next time for seconds/leftovers. I made it with cheddar this time (because that's what I had). I highly recommend Hellman's Mayo, it's the best IMHO.

This is our favorite tuna casserole recipe. Great flavor. Not your same old same old tuna casserole. We like it with peas too, but prefer the zucchini since it keeps the dish moist.

We were  not really happy about the way this tasted due to the dryness . The pictures look great and I suppose if I added a whole jar of mayo it may have looked like that as well but we would have then been sick to our stomaches!
I adde extra salt and seasonings but to no avail.
The recipe sounded great but the the blandness and dryness leads me to look elshwere for a tuna casserole dish.

This is a great alternative to traditional tuna casserole.  I like that it doesn't call for the canned mushroom soup.  I've made it several times and used different variations on the veggies.  It's a great recipe!

We did not like this much at all.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except for the zuccini - I didn't have any, so I added peas instead.  It was ok at first, but both myself and my daughter were a little queasy afterward and my husband wouldn't even touch it.  It looked appealing, but just didn't cut it for us.  Thanks anyway.

I LOVED this tuna casserole!!!  I'm not much of a peas fan so i was excited to find a recipe that didn't include them.  Pretty much followed the recipe to the T, but spiced it up a little with some Mrs. Dash, Adobo and black pepper.  Amazing meal!!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I believe it is the one I have been looking for, for months! This was a family favorite growing up and what made it so much simpler, was that we made it in the microwave.  I believe the folowing is what we used for microwave cooking: Microwave at high power for 6-8 minutes. Top the dish with the cheese and tomato. Microwave at high power for 2 more minutes, and let stand for 3 minutes before serving

This recipe turned out really well.  I was a little concerned at first because it was smelling oddly like deviled eggs when I was stirring, and there aren't any eggs in the mix!  But, my husband liked it and I have a feeling it will be even better heated up.  I mixed everything in together instead of layering the zuchinni and I thought it was fine.  I suggest cutting the zuchinni thin if you decide to do this.

I thought it tasted great, but was very dry. Next time I would either use less pasta, or increase the creamy ingredients. It needed more tuna in my opinion, too.  It may have also been too "hearty"  and dry because of the fettucini I used (I didn't have any egg noodles). I also added black olives for some added flavor.

Yep, another winner!!  I make this gluten free by using GF pasta, and sharp or extra sharp cheddar.  I always add a 1/4c of dry, white wine to the mix.  That gives it a little extra something, and probably because that is what my mom always did.  Thanks mom!  You are so smart!

This is the absolute best tuna noodle casserole ever. And the only one I make anymore. It is versitile. I usually don't have Zucchini on hand, so I just make it without, and it is excellent. Also I substitute the zucchini for red peppers. I layer them in the middle. This is a nice change from the "traditional" tuna noodle casserole. By the way don't leave out the thyme because it gives it the perfect flavor. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I needed a super fast meal last night for dinner and decided that tuna casserole always fits that bill so I thought I would try a new type of tuna casserole.  I only had some of this on hand so I used what I had which was, 2 green onions so I added in some finely chopped regular onion, i had no celery or tomatoe or zucchini or jack cheese.  I did have a cheddar/jack blend and used that and some sharp cheddar for added flavor.  Used extra wet ingrediants and also added 3/4 cup of 1/2 n 1/2 and extra parsley and thyme and added some dill as well.  I added crushed potatoe chips on top too.  It came out really nice.  My husband said it was a really good casserole and a nice change from the "soup" ones.  I agree but i may have added a tad too much mustard as I kept tasting that flavor in every bite and would rather have had that be a little less strong in flavor, next time I'll cut back on that.

I liked this recipe alot, and my 14 month old loved it too. My husband didn't like it too much though. I love that it doesn't call for condensed soup. I added extra sour cream - I like my food saucy. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.

I enjoyed this as I've been looking for a noodle casserole that isn't a gluey, pastey mess.  It's light and I think a can of chicken would also be good if you don't like tuna.

This was very tasty. I especially liked how it used only fresh ingredients,no cans of condensed soup. I'm watching my carbs, so I used 1 cup of Dreamfield macaroni instead of the noodles. My husband really liked this.

Very Tasty! Due to what I had on hand here is what I substituted and it still turned out great: bowtie pasta, spinach, yellow onion, cheddar cheese and I added some cottage cheese as someone else suggested. Looking forward to the leftovers.

Even with extra milk, it was very dry (not to mention bland) and the thyme seasoning was not a good fit for  tuna. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed with such a highly rated recipe.

I LOVE tuna casserole, this is the first one I can unequivocally say is horrid! Very Dry and noodles need to be boiled all the way, not par-boiled as the instructions say. Mayo leavs a greasy film in your mouth.  Keep on looking if you want a winner.

My husband and I loved this recipie.  He's not a big tuna fan, and has been frightened of tuna casserole's thanks to growning up in a "bland" house, but this changed his mind.  I made it around lunch time, put it in the fridge, and didn't worry about it until it was dinner time.  It was great.  Lots of flavor and texture.  We used chedder cheese, as that's what we had available, but it was still great.  We will definently be making this again soon!

Also left out the thyme.

THis was delicious. I took a risk the first time making it for company before trying it myself. It has great flavor, good consistency. I added a bit more yogurt/mayonnaise (1/2C) for more moisture. Yum!

Another awesome recipe from All-Recipes.com.  My whole family loved this dish and there were no leftovers.  I used two tomatoes, just because we like them.  The zucchini was a nice touch.  Thanks!  :)

This is the first tuna casserole I've ever made...and the family loved it.  My two girls are exchange students from different sides of the world and I was so happy to find another dish that they both liked.I modified it by replacing the zucchini with peas and I forgot the cheese but it was still a great hit.

Quite a different twist on tuna casserole. Very good flavor combination with the added zucchini.  I used kluski egg noodles for a little heartier texture.

As some other people recommended, I added some more additional milk. but the result was still dry. It was almost like a pasta salad.

This is a keeper!  My family enjoyed it and said they wouldn't mind having it again.  One thing I would change next time is to reduce the amount of thyme to 1/4 tsp.  The amount called for in the recipe was a little overpowering.

Very good!  And what a nice break from the old 'soup can' recipes.  Had to change it a little tho as I don't like zucchini.  Carrots tasted well and I think next time I will layer with green beans or peas.  Could've used more thyme I think.  But good flavor and easy to make nonetheless.

This is a keeper! Delicious!  Nice change from the old mushroom soup Tuna Noodle Casserole. I always think it's funny when someone raves about a recipe and then tells you all the ways they changed it.  Well... here are my changes.  Mushrooms for Zuchinni (I'll try Zucchini next time, just didn't have any) and Nonfat Yogurt for the Sour Cream (I'll probably use the yogurt again to decrease fat content).  I used about 12 oz of pasta because that was what was in the bag.

I used mushrooms and Zucchini,and it still wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I would make it again, but, I wouldn't bake it again.  I thought it tasted much better cold. (without the mushrooms and zucchini of course)
