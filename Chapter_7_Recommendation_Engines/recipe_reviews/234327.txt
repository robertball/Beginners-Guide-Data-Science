This is delicious, the plums give it a surprisingly mildly sweet and moist flavour. Perfect to use up those plums and zucchini from the garden. The zucchini blends in so well the batter is so flavourful. Important, press the water out of the zucchini. As usual for me, I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup, and I increased both zuch and plums just slightly to a rounded 2 cups. I'm making it again asap.

I added 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg to the flour and 1/8 to the crumble topping  and substituted applesauce for the oil and this is OUTSTANDING!  Trying a lot of different recipes due to an overachieving garden and this will be made again!  Great recipe!

I made it exactly like the recipe and we are delighted with the results.  This is my new go-to recipe for zucchini bread.  I was skeptical of all the sugar, but with 3 cups of flour, it makes 2 good-sized loaves of bread.  Not too sweet, and plums are a nice addition.

I have made many sweet breads, and this one was really one of the best. The only things I did different from the recipe were to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added a tad more cinnamon and a little clove. The edges were crispy and sweet, the inside moist and almost pudding-like from the plums. So good!! My roommates and I devoured half a loaf before it even cooled.

I'm not gonna lie, I was a little wary of this combo (plum & zucchini) but this bread blew my mind. The plum adds a nice sweetness without being overwhelming, and it's extremely moist and delicious! I made 2 loaves with this recipe and they were devoured by my work

A great, moist quick bread. Great for using up plums from our tree and zucchini from the garden.

Everyone loves this recipe! I use plums that I canned and the zucchini is shredded and canned as well. Both are drained and since the plums are canned in halves, I put them in the food processor and only used 2 1/2 cups. This is a wonderful, moist bread and is always a winner.

I added some nutmeg based on advise of another reviewer, and because I didn't have whole wheat flour on hand, I used masa corn flour. Overall, it's just incredibly bland. It's not that sweet despite the amount of sugar added either. It's consistency is fine  - not too moist and not too dry - but I have to eat it with jam to make it palatable.

Tasty muffins that use up all the plums we had! I substituted just over 1/3 c of oats for the whole wheat flour as I was out. Used 1 c brown sugar as per recipe and cut the white sugar down by half. Also added slightly more zucchini and plums. While still very good, given 4 stars as I only give 5 to recipes that really knock my socks off

It was really moist! The plum is subtle. A great somewhat healthy bread.

Delicious! Made exactly as recipe called for.  The plums take on the flavor of fresh cranberries, and it is both sweet and tart at the same time.  This is a keeper.

Wow! Looking at the picture , I thought the bread might be bulky and dry . Adding the plums to this recipe made it moist and almost a berry flavor ......yum :D

This was a hit ! I made a fat free, vegan version (subbing applesauce for the oil and using flaxmeal "eggs") with pluots  instead of plums. I stuck to the recipe otherwise. I'll be making it again this weekend. I'll try  it with less sugar this time and hope I don't miss it.

This is a change from the usual zucchini bread recipe. I didn't have any plums, so I used three cups of ripe peaches and a cup of melted coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. The bread is moist and very flavorful and is one I will make again.
