Thanks all for trying out the Romesco Sauce. Just a note that I should have had in the recipe. The garlic can be peeled or unpeeled at roasting time. I peel mine. The biggest complaint from reviewers has been that it's too vinegary. Please use less vinegar to start with, since some vinegars are stronger than others, and then if you are a vinegar freak like me, add more :] Cheers!

I kept thinking "What? No onions? No basil or oregano?" but after one taste I realized this sauce doesn't need a single thing added to it!  Simply PERFECT!  My only changes were to reduce the vinegar - I probably used 3 1/2 tbsp. or so, just added a little at a time and kept tasting, then at the end I probably ended up drizzling in 1/4 cup of olive oil.   Had a little with some toasted baguette and crackers, and then on top of pasta for dinner.  Just delicious!  I think next time I'll try pulsing the almonds first, though, as my food processor is old and tired and I ended up finding a couple large chunks.    I really didn't want to blend the sauce any further as it was just the right texture.

So Spanish & so delicious! All 3 world travelers who tasted this LOVED it. We each want to make this again & again! I made it & personally LOVED it exactly as written though the vinegar is noticeable, so you may want to start with a little less vinegar, taste, & then decide if more's wanted. Although I served this as an appetizer on baguette slices, it is also a great dip for savory empanadas (such as cheese, shrimp, or potatoes & chorizo), for dipping celery & carrots, or as a sauce for pasta, chicken, shrimp...you'll find many ways to use this full-flavored, adaptable sauce! Bravo, AngieItaliano! (Maybe your "nom de plume" should be AngieEspanola!)

THIS SAUCE IS AMAZING! Used it for pizza sauce with the Honey Wheat Pizza Dough from this site, topped with goat cheese and lots of fresh basil. I'm so happy this was the sauce I picked! I changed this a little based on my personal preferences and what I had on hand, but it would be great just as written. I used 1 1/2 bell peppers, added a few more tomatoes, included 2 shallots, sub'd basil oil for the olive oil, and sub'd spicy balsamic vinegar and a little rice wine vinegar (didn't have red wine vinegar). I didn't add the bread or almonds - might add toasted pine nuts next time. Lots left over, which I froze for my next pizza.

Oh Baby Come To Mamma. I've been munching on this with toasted baguette slices and veggie dippers. I just wanted to try it as a snack before I started dinner. Now I have to push back dinner because I keep eating this! So you say this gets better after sitting? I'm in trouble, I'm cooking only for myself and thought I'd have a bunch for the freezer. Kept to the recipe, except for being heavy-handed with the pepper flakes and paprika (used sweet Hungarian, my Spanish paprika is smoked, maybe I'll try that next time since I bet that goes with the roasty goodness). I did end up using the entire amount of vinegar, it was perfect for me. I think some brands are more sharp and others more smooth, so I bet that makes a difference. I asked in the Recipe Exchange if the garlic should be peeled before or after roasting, and the submitter herself answered (also Rhianna) within just a few minutes that peeling before hand works better, but either way is okay. I used parchment instead of foil on the baking pan, and got perfect consistency with a food processor.  Just got a great idea since I have more baguette to use up: Make a pizza-type thing with baguette sliced horizontally and toasted, topped with romesco, then olives, artichoke hearts and parmesan! I know what is for lunch (okay maybe breakfast) tomorrow. Thanks Angie this is one of the best things I've tried in a long time.

This is freakin' insane. A flavor explosion. I made exactly according to recipe, only adding the red wine vinegar by tbsp. until it felt right. I just dipped a spoon into it to taste it before dinner. A couple times. And I'm about to go again. I'm planning on serving this on whole wheat pasta for my family with fresh parm but for me, I'm having it over roasted vegetables. Awesome recipe, Miss Angie. This one's a keeper. For sure.

This was SPECTACULAR and came out exactly as described. I found that using the same amount of vinegar called for was a bit tangy at first but by the next day it had mellowed perfectly!, I made semolina toasts, spread with romesco, topped with finely chopped black olives, artichokes and parsley and then a dollop of goat cheese. Made 30 of these and they were all gone in 15 minutes of guest arriving. Triple batch next time for sure. Thanks for such a versatile delicious recipe that I will make for years to come with my own touch.

WOW!  That was delicious!  I served it with roast chicken breast, pan-seared asparagus, thyme roasted potatoes, and french bread.  I couldn't decide what to slather it on.  So I slathered it on everything.  There's more for tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it!  I used a few tablespoons of vinegar to start, then added to taste.  Didn't roast the garlic, but it was fine raw (if you like that sort of thing), and didn't have tomatoes, so I used some leftover marinara sauce and leftover dried bread crumbs instead of stale bread.  I used two red bell peppers and one fresh pasilla pepper, roasted.  I used regular paprika because it's all I had and less olive oil than called for.  I love the versatility of this sauce!  Oh and did I mention it was amazingly delicious?

Really delicious! I made this exactly as written and I'm glad I did. If you are expecting a tomato or regualr red pasta sauce, don't. This is different, and something really special. I used it with grilled tuna and polenta tonight, but especially loved mopping it up with chewy bread. Thanks, Angie! ♥

This sauce was so delicious! As suggested, I halved the amount of vinegar and it came out perfect. Served over cheese raviolli and rosemary bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Great with rosemary bread dipped in it and I used the rosemary bread as the toast in the recipe as well.  I cut the vinegar in half and it still had an excellent vinegar bite.  Really a great recipe!

I made this because it was on the recipe group list from the past. I didn't know exactly what to expect, taste or color wise. However, the color came out a Thousand Island dressing orange nearly. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use some white wine vinegar with the red wine vinegar as I was a little short. I don't think it should have affected the color or flavor that much. I expected the flavor of this to be amazing. Not one tasty ingredient didn't go into it except the AMOUNT OF VINEGAR IS A LOT! I wish now I would have read the first review and went slow with it like I originally was considering. I think I would have been happy with half the amount. I ended up adding a little more olive oil to try to cut through and it did help. Start with half and then add more as needed unless you are trying to make red pepper vinegar sauce. I am going to try this on something mild to see if it blends well. Tomato sauce isn't amazing on its own either. The recipe also makes a lot! So, I would not only add the vinegar to taste but I would scale it down if you don't need 3 plus cups of sauce.

A-MAZZZIINNGGG!!!!!!!!!!!! Even used it as a base for the sunset tomato soup and added to guacamole.  If you aren't a vinegar fan I would cut back a little and not use 1/2C.  I was skeptical of the bread, but it gave it the perfect consistency.

This sauce is soooo goood!, a  little too garlicky for us (and we love garlic) so next time Ill only use 8 garlic cloves I also reduced the olive oil to a little more than 1/4 of a cup and as per other reviewers suggestions I also reduced the red wine vinegar to 1/4 of a cup. Excellent sauce will make many times.

Heavenly!  I just made this for dinner and I can't stop picking at it.  The blend of flavors is absolutely perfect.  I did add less vinegar, because I know my guys wouldn't like it with the full amount.  Even my little guy said it was yummy.  I can't wait to try it over chicken next time.  This is a definite keeper!

SO flavorful and fresh tasting!  I didn't use the bread and used only 1/3 cup olive oil.  This was SO much better the next day, I highly recommend making it a day ahead of time.  It was tasty a couple hours after making it and having it sit in the refrigerator, but even better overnight.  The Italian in me wants to add chopped basil to this recipe, though I know that takes away from its Spanish authenticity I know that would be an excellent addition.  I'd also like to try this with pine nuts sometime.  Thanks Angie, I will be making this again!

Angie, this is one of those dishes that grows on you.  I made it yesterday and had some of it last night as a dipping sauce for Italian-marinated chicken.  I think it will be splendid with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site or over capellini with some capers.  It has a unique flavor.  Thanks for broadening my taste experience!

OMGoodness! I made this at 12:00pm for dinner and couldn't wait for the Italian bread that I was making. I grabbed a slice of store bought Italian bread, toasted it, and ate it for lunch. This was so refreshing, delicous, and complimented a hot spring day. I can't wait to try it on chicken and pasta! Thank you AngieItaliano for sharing!

This made alot.  I used some the night I made it as a sauce for some grilled veggies, then throughout the week on baked potatoes, a omelet, as a sandwich/burger spread.  Very versatile!

We had romesco sauce at our wedding and I wanted to replicate our meal. I tried this recipe and while it wasn't bad it just didn't have the same flavor I was looking for. I followed the recipe as written. The garlic was really strong. I'm not sure I would do this one again.

Delicious. I meant to add the vinegar a bit at a time to taste as suggested, and then forgot entirely; although I found it a bit vinegary when I first blended it, two hours later after the flavours had melded, it wasn't too much at all. A beautiful, versatile sauce that I will definitely make again -- probably frequently.

This was definitely different from any sauce I am used to, but it was delicious! After reading some reviews, I made this the day before and refrigerated overnight for the flavours to meld and I also used only half the vinegar called for because I don't like stuff too tangy. I served this on sliced Italian Bread with Steamed Shrimp. I have to admit at first bite I wasn't sure if I liked it - but as I kept eating - oh my! It was like the sauce was calling my name! Thanks for sharing Angie.

This was different.  I'm not really sure how to rate this.  I did exactly as the recipe called for.  I think it's the texture of the nuts I need to get used to. Can't wait to try it on pizza or as a sauce.  Right now, I've just been dipping my french loaf into it!

This was really good. I left out almost all of the oil to cut the calories and it was great. I love vinegar so it wasn't too vinegar-y for me. I've had this on a mixture of roasted zucchini, crookneck, eggplant and tomatoes and also on top of breaded/seasoned baked chicken breasts. Both ways were delicious.

This was fantastic! I used this as a dip for bread and the flavors were great. Everyone really enjoyed it. I will try this with fish or chicken soon! If I would try this for pasta, however, I think I would cut down on the vinegar a little to take away a bit of the tartness. I will definately be making this again! Thanks, Angie. :) SIDE NOTE: Angie, I just have to let you know that my 2 year old son absolutely LOVES this sauce. He keeps saying, "mmmmm...good sauce". Thanks again! :)

This is a great recipe and I made it as instructed. I put it on top of zucchini noodles, and also added chopped broccoli florettes and shoestring carrots. It’s very similar to the noodles and company romesco sauce. I also sprinkled feta cheese on top at the end. Very delicious.

It wasn't for our tastes... I had to add lots of parmesan to be able to eat it.. The only change i made was to put 1/3 cup vinegar instead of 1/2 cup. The almond was overpowering.

I did use half the vinegar. I've already had to share the recipe four times in as many days. Going to be a household staple from here on.

The only thing I changed was to use 7 tomatoes, because I thought mine were small.  Excellent results! I liked it; wife liked it. What more can I ask?
Spicy, smoky taste is definitely Latin, rather than Italian, but, oh, so welcome! A keeper if there ever was one!

Just made this, and it is delicious! I used lots more tomatoes and peppers, probably tripled the recipe, but didn't triple the additional items; if I had it probably would have been even better. I am freezing the majority of it in cubes to have instant sauce for single servings. I'll be making this again and again.

So I hardly ever take the time to write a review, but this recipe deserves it.  Delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers (thank you, everyone) and reduced the vinegar to 2 T. and the oil to 1/3 cup. I also used about 3/4 tsp. of salt.  I was using CSA tomatoes (which were not romas) so estimated with 4 good-sized sized ones.  I'll be making this again for sure.

I have been cooking for 40 years or more and have never run across a recipe for this sauce.  And, I read cookbooks in my spare time!  Where has this recipe been all my life?  I can think of a hundred things to use this for, not the least of which is just a spread for vegetables or crackers.  I followed the recipe exactly, as I always do for the first time making something.  I didn't think it was too vinegary, but I like vinegar.  I made it this morning and having it as an appetizer tonight with crackers.  I can't keep eating it!  It makes a lot, but I'm planning to put it over pasta for dinner tomorrow.  It would make a very good "pizza" sauce on crostini's with some chopped up olives, pepperoni or onions with some cheese on top and broiled.  This is a very versatile sauce.  I'll be making it often!

This sauce is just okay.  After cutting the vinegar in half, I still found the vinegar taste too obvious.  Perhaps I just don't expect a tomato based sauce to taste vinegary.  Used it as a spread on toasted baguette and as a spaghetti sauce but both just tasted a little strange.  Not really bad but it just didn't work for me.

This is excellent and very easy to make. I do advice cutting the vinegar in half as others have suggested -- then add as needed to taste. I found 1/2 teaspoon of salt sufficient. I also used Rosemary sourdough bread to add to the flavor (as opposed to plain bread). I also reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, which seemed more than enough. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. This sauce is thick enough to use as a dip, thin enough to use as a sauce for pasta or vegetables, and I believe it would work as a sandwich spread as well. Very versatile, and I look forward to attempting some variations. Well done.

FANTASTIC!!! Used normal tomatoes rather than plum tomatoes as it was all I had but the result was still fantastic. Also used Sambal over chilies as it was already a paste :)

Ok so here's the deal...  This was unlike any sauce I have ever made or tasted before.  It wasn't at all what I was expecting although very easy to make.  I think the tanginess of the vinegar and nutty taste threw me off a bit, I guess because I didn't think these flavors would be as noticable as they were.  We tried it over pasta and on bread and preferred it on the bread.  Instead of serving over pasta, I think I may have liked it better over fish or chicken or even vegetables?  I'm certainly glad we tested this out, I'm just not sure this was the sauce recipe for us.

This was wonderful!  My only change was that I used half the vinegar.  I served it over ravioli with fresh rosemary on top.  Yummy!
