This review is based on using pumpkin puree not pumpkin pie filling.  I messed up and didn't read the recipe correctly.  Made with pumpkin puree these were very good.  From personal experience I added a 1/2 teaspoon salt. (Pie filling has Pumpkin, Sugar Syrup, Water, Salt, Natural Flavors, Spices in it already, so I am not sure how that would work.)  The consistency of the batter made with pumpkin puree was just right.  Thanks for a nice Fall breakfast treat!

It was delicious, the pumpkin really makes a difference, I just added brown sugar instead of white:)

After I made one, I realizedon't that there is no salt in the recipe to activate the powder and the powder taste is too strong. That's why they are doughy even though they are beautifully golden on the outside.  Added a T of oil and maybe 2 T more milk based on every recipe I have made for pancakes, but the omission of salt is basic baking chemistry.  Too late to add it now without having patches of salt. Next time I will reduce the powder, add the salt, add more pumpkin, and leave the extra milk and oil out. I will let you know.

Made this for my husband and my two kiddos (ages 3 & 5) and they loved it! I needed to make this quickly as I was in a hurry, so I opted to add 1 cup of canned pumpkin filling to Krusteez buttermilk pancake, salt, and spices as recommended. Topped with more pumpkin, cinnamon, banana, walnuts, and maple syrup. These were a hit with the family!

Grandson (who loves everything pumpkin) did not like these pancakes! I used pumpkin puree and added a little extra sugar and pumpkin pie spice but followed the rest of the recipe. I guess he likes fluffy pancakes and these were not!

We really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just used a healthy dose of cinnamon and nutmeg, and I also used a gluten free flour substitute (which often makes my pancakes more crumbly) but it worked just fine this time.  Did anyone else find them super filling? My 4 year old usually gobbles down 4 large pancakes (i know! Huge appetite! Pancakes are his favorite food in the world) but he was stymied after two and a half. Love this recipe... It's been saved!.

I ALWAYS read the reviews before using a recipe and glad I did because someone pointed out there is no added salt in this recipe which is needed for baking powder. After cutting the powder to 3 and adding 1/2 t of salt this recipe is perfect.

Delicious but batter a bit heavy. I added a hand full of golden raisins and a sprinkle of toasted, sliced almonds on one side of each cake.

These pancakes took a ridiculously long time to cook and by the time I sat down to eat them most of them were still raw inside. I'm talking I cooked each batch for around 15 minutes and they were not edible. I spent a long time telling my toddlers mamas busy cooking and now were all eating leftovers :/

I made this recipe as per instructions.  When it was finished two things caught my eye the thickness and the light tan color.  I tried it and it didn’t not taste every pumpkin spicey at all; infact, the flour was the dominant tastel.  I added another cup of pumpkin pie mix, which helped with the consistency and the taste.  Next the spices.  This recipe requires more spices in my opinion so I added extra spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.  I also added a little salt.  Perfect. Added some chocolate chips at my sons request. Overall this recipe was good as a base, but it really needed modifications to be successful.

Super yummy and perfect for Fall! We added dark chocolate chips too, just for fun. Next time I’m adding walnuts and maple syrup. So good!

I could tell when she said add the pumpkin pie spice cinnamon and Nutmeg that it was not "pumpkin pie filling: but pumpkin puree I think she should make the change in that recipe for those who don't catch it quickly and make a mistake it will be too soupy. So I made them with the puree and they were terrific I did add the mini chocolate chips

I loved them!  I wish I could give these pancakes 100 stars, but 5 stars is the maximum number. They are light and fluffy, and a perfect Thanksgiving breakfast. They are great with whipped cream and syrup!

Delicious!  I used pumpkin purée instead of pumpkin pie filling and it worked fine.  Just added about 3/4 cups of brown sugar.  If you want sweeter, add 1 cup of brown sugar.  Also added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the 1.  Also, not sure if you need 4 teaspoons of baking powder.  I did use the 4 as stated in the recipe and 1/2 tsp of salt, but I think 3 teaspoons would have been fine.  There were a couple of pancakes where you could taste the baking powder.  Overall, my family loved these pancakes.  Can't wait to make them again!

I didn't have nutmeg or pumpkin spice. I added a little extra cinnamon and followed the recipe besides that. These are so moist and fluffy. So delicious!

Delicious and healthy recipe!  I used pumpkin puree rather than pumpkin pie filling, and also 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1 cup whole wheat flour (rather than 2 cups all-purpose flour).  Plus I added chopped pecans for texture.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

Followed this recipe with one little change of brown sugar instead of white sugar. Served with real maple syrup and cool whip. Added chocolate chips in between the pancakes which were hot enough to melt the chips. OMG....yummy!
