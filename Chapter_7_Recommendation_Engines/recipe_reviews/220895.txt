Shrimp and Grits - a dish that has been nagging me for years to try it. Last week, while in Memphis, I finally tried it and fell in lust.  But the dish was VERY spicy and on the greasy side and I knew I could do better.  I researched Shrimp and Grits on my flight home and learned a lot, not the least of which was that it was originally a breakfast dish.  I also learned there are as many ways to make it as Mama makes her meatballs, and everyone thinks theirs  is the true and only way  to make it.  I say bah!  Make what appeals to you - wine, no wine, tomatoes  or not, okra, no okra, cream or no.  The variations seemed endless.  Make what appeals to you - and this recipe appealed to me.  It ran circles around the dish I had at a popular restaurant in Memphis (clearly they do much better with barbecue!) and both Hubs and I thought this was "lick-your-plate-clean good."  Because it is my preference I  used polenta rather than grits, but the difference, really, is marginal.  I used chicken broth in the  polenta/grits rather  than the water simply so as not to waste what I had left.  It just contributed a richer flavor anyway!  The recipe itself is perfect in my mind.  I can't say enough how blown away Hubs and I both were over this.  It is traditionally a humble dish, but it is also quite elegant - something I will be sure to keep in mind when I want to impress.  Once again, this version of Shrimp and Grits is a real "beaut" and I would suggest following it to the letter.  A+

If you want to cut some of the fat (and calories) without compromising taste, here are a couple suggestions:

- Add 1 cup of 2% milk to the grits when you would have added the half-and-half, and keep on low heat while you make everything else. Every few minutes as it thickens, add a little more lowfat milk, so you end up using 2 C lowfat milk instead of 2 C half-and-half. Add cheese per recipe.
- Chop up your bacon and cook it in the skillet/pan until browned, then remove with a slotted spoon. Add your sausages and brown them a little, and remove them with a slotted spoon. Then add your 1/4 C flour to the pan you cooked the meat in, whisking so that you have a thick roux. (If your bacon was really lean you might add 1 TBL of butter.) Cook and stir over med-low until it's medium brown, then increase heat to med-high & add all your vegetables into the roux, stirring for 5-8 minutes until they're soft. Add the chicken broth and Worcestershire, cooking veggies a few minutes while the sauce thickens and they cook a little more, then add back the sausage, bacon and the shrimp and cook until shrimp are done. 

You will cut out 70 grams of fat and 475 calories by making these small changes, without compromising taste at all!

Absolutely the BEST Shrimp and Grits I have ever made!  My son does not like Shrimp and Grits but after trying this, his response was "This is how Shrimp and Grits should be made".  All smiles in this household!!!

Being born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, means I have a very high standard for shrimp and grits. It was, after all, invented hereabouts. This recipe definitely passed the test. I used locally stone ground grits (which are so good that you will be ruined for the cheap stuff at the grocery store) and fresh local shrimp from right down the road (the best shrimp I can get, in other words). I was doubtful about the andouille sausage; I thought it would be gilding the lily at first, but I shrugged my shoulders and added it in anyway. With the first bite, my doubts were layed to rest. The sausage added a wonderful smoky, meaty note to the dish that's not usually found in classic shrimp and grits. I, of course, added garlic powder and butter to the grits, because it's better that way, and sprinkled a little paprika over the whole thing, and it was perfection. Definitely a new staple recipe.

I saw another recipe for shrimp and grits on this site and it made me explore the other shrimp and grit recipes. This one is fabulous! I made a few minor adjustments for my taste and they worked out just fine. I used chicken Andouille sausage from Trader Joes,green, red and orange peppers, added fresh asparagus and canned diced tomatoes ( would have preferred fresh but didn't have any). I added a bit more cayenne because my family likes a little more heat and kept everything else the same. As far as the grits go I added garlic powder, but I also put a couple of shakes of ground red pepper to the mix. It definitely kicked it up a notch and married well with the shrimp mixture. The shrimp combo on top of the cheese grits was a taste explosion in my mouth! When my daughter and cousin came in the next day they immediately wanted to know what the wonderful smell was and both sat down and had a bowl. The flavors were even more electrifying the next day. The beauty in this is you can tweak this recipe to your liking. I chose to add more veggies. Keep in mind if you add more veggies they create more liquid. If you like a thicker gravy adjust your flour mixture.

wish i could give it more than 5 stars. I omitted bacon and salt. I used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of  water instead of 3 cups of water. i saved shrimp from sausage mixture and added it to flour butter roux. I cooked the shrimp just until barely done. This is the best meal on the planetl.

My doctor would have a fit about all that's bad about this recipe, and I honestly wouldn't make it often, but I sure will make it again - as I shake my fist at death.  I made it very nearly as written, and it was marvelous.  The flavors were well-balanced.  Next time, I think I will try to reduce the fat somewhat, but do try the recipe as written once, at the very least. Thanks to the author for a spendid recipe!

This is definitely a keeper.  We served to our "gourmet club" (a group of friends who have been enjoying good food together for 25 years) and it was a real hit.  I didn't change anything about the ingredients and found it very flavorful as written.  I did, however, rearrange the instructions to make for some ease in finishing it at the last minute.  Bacon can be fried early in the day and then veggies sautéed in the bacon grease. Roux made ahead.  Sausage browned and cooked veggies added--even the roux and broth, w sauce, can be added.  All you need to do then is start your grits and add the shrimp to the sausage, veggie, bacon mixture until it cooks through.  Delicious!

Absolutely fantastic. My husband was born and raised in Carleston SC. I made this when he made a special request for shrimp and grits. I'd never made it before so I was kind of nervous. He and the rest of my family loved it. My husband said it was better than a lot of restaurants he'd tried it in. The only changes I made were adding a few dashes of extra cayenne to the shrimp mixture once it was complete and adding some american cheese in addition to the cheddar in with the grits.
 i will definitely make ths again. I think it will make a great dinner for company.

Nothing is more disappointing then having to spend Christmas day away from family pulling a 12 hour shift. So, I spent most of my work day in the kitchen whipping up recipes for the crew. This was the recipe that wrapped it all up. I made the recipe as written, except for substituting water for low sodium chicken broth and spicing it up with hot sauce and chili flakes. This is a really fantastic recipe. Everyone loved it.

Very good! I had never heard of the shrimp and grits combo until my husband mentioned that he wanted it for dinner.  Well, I made him make it and it was excellent!  He followed the recipe exactly except for Worcestershire because we were out.

Tasty, creamy, down home southern taste and texture! The roux was wonderful and the flavors melded perfectly. Used the recipe as is, without a hitch, and what was great was getting it in email and having everything in our pantry and fridge already - a great go to meal that makes mid-week feel like a special day. WONDERFUL with the cheesy grits. Yes, I said 'cheesy'. From a Southern gal raised in the Green Swamp of Florida. The title is exactly what the recipe and plate is. Thanks so much for submitting, this will be in regular rotation!

There couldn't possibly be a quicker or more delicious shrimp and grits recipe!  I use this recipe to feed my ever-growing teen boys and their friends.  The sausage adds lots of meat without much cost.  
Wonderful!

I've made this a few times now, and overall, the recipe turns out great. However, the sausage seems like overkill, so I usually skip that. The grits don't take that long to prepare, and I usually dont start them until I've finished cooking the bacon and veggies. Secondly, I never need 2 cups of half n half and instead use just 1 cup. Also, I find it helpful to cook the shrimp separately, after everything else is done, and then mix in last. If you add the shrimp in before you make the roux, then you will have over cooked, rubbery shrimp. Great flavor and will make again with my tweaks.

It started out, my wife said she doesn't like grits. Or peppers. I made it anyway. Left out the sausage, didn't have any. Put in more bacon instead. She devoured it. And seconds. And than she said she would order this in a restaurant. She has never said that in 23 years of my cooking. This was one of the best tasting dishes I've ever had. She said she wouldn't eat the grits alone, but with the shrimp, it was a perfect combination. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for this. It was fantastic

We loved this recipe. 
I cut down on the fat a little but subbing 2% for the half and half and used half the bacon. Still the dish turned out great. 
I liked it better than the shrimp and grits I had while visiting Charlestown.

Absolutely amazing! Restaurant quality! My bf has been bugging me about making him shrimp and grits but I've kinda of been putting it off because I have no idea how to make shrimp and grits.  I don't even eat shrimp!!! So how was I supposed to pull this off? Well this recipe was my secret weapon! OMG! This was AMAZING!!! He lite up like a Christmas tree! I made fire roasted corn (roasting in the oven for 8 mins with butter and cayenne pepper) and put that around the outside of the grits which was not only a nice decorative additive but delicious with the grits.  I also made a side of sweet corn bread.  I am now the QUEEN in my house because of this.  I can't believe it came out this great on my first try.  I will definitely cook this again for more people to impress them. :) Only thing I will do next time is prep everything first to cut down on time.  This time I was reading the recipe and doing everything at the same time but it still came out FANTASTIC! Okay gotta go...its time for a second helping! YUM!

Made for dinner tonight and LOVED it! I lived in Charleston for years(and if you ever get a chance to go...GO!!). This recipe is right up there with many of the great restaurants in the Lowcountry. Thank you for sharing.

Yummmmazing! I'm not even a huge shrimp and grits fan, but this changed my opinion! My husband is a huge shrimp and grits lover so when he was pretty down in the dumps with the long hours and little sleep life as a resident physician, I surprised him with this recipe and he was so excited. He had had shrimp and grits in Columbia, sc last year which he thought were amazing and still talks about BUTTTTT he told me he liked these even better! I was pretty pleased with his reaction and definitely added it to the "will make again" collection!

Outstanding! My only suggestion is to cook the sausages whole first, then slice them. The bacon adds a lot of flavor. I had cooked shrimp in my fridge so I used that. Also, I used 5 minute grits (Shhhh, don't tell anyone!)  I feel the roux is unnecessary and the sausage/ shrimp mixture is fine on it's own. This could be served to guests. Very pretty and delicious!

Very yummy.  We used what we had around though. Lime juice instead of lemon, leftover bacon fat, whole milk instead of half and half.  This dish turned out great. I prepped EVERYTHING before I started cooking and it felt like forever. 1 hour 15 minutes is a pretty accurate time frame if you follow the recipe exactly. The next time I will make the rue and the grits at the same time and set aside.

First of all this tasted amazing.  Really good dish to have a couple times a year to just say the heck with eating healthy.  That said...it is a bit involved so be prepared.  The only thing I did different was use only 1 pound of shrimp (plenty) because they were expensive.  I fed 3 adults and 2 kids on it and had some leftover. Oh, and for the grits/liquid measurement I adjusted to what I know works; 1 to 4 ratio comes out perfect every time.  1 cup grits, 4 cups liquid.  Came out perfect in 15-20 minutes.

This is a great recipe, full of flavor. Although, I don't use chicken broth. I buy the shrimp with the heads on. Rinse shrimp. Then, I take the heads and shell of the shrimp and put it in about 6 cups of water, add celery, onion, 1 stick butter, and seafood seasoning. Allow this mix to boil for 2-5 minutes, then simmer. I would do this first before cooking grits. You would want to strain this shrimp liquid before you start the roux (butter-flour). Add the shrimp broth instead of chicken broth.  The extra work is well worth it.

Made this tonight & loved it! It was labor intensive for a weeknight and I'll save it for weekends going forward.  I only used 12 oz. shrimp, used fat free half & half, low sodium chicken broth, and I mistakenly got mild cheddar instead of sharp but still thought it was great! I think we got 6 servings out of it and figured it at 550 calories.  Next time I think we will half the recipe.  But there will definitely be a next time!

I fixed this for dinner tonight and it was a great success.  Only thing I would change is to add the shrimp at almost the very last moment so they don't get overcooked. Also, if you are like me (slow cook  and not good @ multitasking while cooking) add the cheese to grits as soon as they are done cooking.

This was my first time having shrimp and grits of any kind. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't the best recipe I've ever made.

My favorite recipe to make for guests. It tastes SO GOOD and looks just wonderful on the plate. It's easy to make, yet looks like it took hours to do. Really, it's the perfect meal :-)

This was GOOD!! I have a friend coming over this weekend and she wants me to cook for her. I asked her what she wanted and she said shrimp and grits. I picked this recipe and cooked it a few days before to work out any issues. IT WAS AMAZING!!! I am surprised how well this turned out! Came out a little thick but I guess I add more broth to loosen it up.

This was a great dish! Our entire family really loved it.  The one variation I used was adding chopped tomatoes, only because my husband had seen them used in a recipe for S&G he had seen on the TV. Oops, I also didn't use the bacon, because we didn't have any.  Because I am more of a vegetable vs meat lover, for me, the combination of the veggies is what made it so good.  When I make it again - I will use 1 teaspoon of salt in the grits - using 2 was a bit much.  We will definitely make this recipe a "Keeper"!

I really loved this but for my taste, it had way too much andouille for me.  I would most likely put half or a fourth of the sausage.  My husband thought it could have used more bacon and I think it could have benefited by having more shrimp.  I also added more cheese to the grits but that's just a personal preference.  It will DEFINITELY be my go-to recipe for shrimp and grits though.  It's so versatile that I think you can add or delete whatever you want. IT'S A KEEPER!!

I tried this recipe today for the first time, I served it for brunch and my family loved it.  I made a few changes: omitted the bacon, seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay seasoning, used seafood stock instead of chicken broth for the sauce. I also used less half & half than the recipe called for because it seemed too soupy, but next time I'll use more -the grits stiffened while I was preparing the shrimp. It was absolutely delicious, this recipe is a keeper.

I do not live in grits country... the only thing at my grocery store was the instant kind, and I found that preparing them first led to gummy consistency. I recommend paying attention to the instructions on your grits package, maybe waiting until the end to prepare if using the quick grits - but otherwise this is an AWESOME recipe, the shrimp part turned out fantastic as written. Serve with some Tabasco.

If I was on death row this would be my last meal!!! This is the best meal I have ever eaten! It was heaven in my mouth. Don't be intimidated with all the steps.  Just do all the prep work first then tackle the recipe as it is really easy.  It will be worth it.

It was delicious!!  I use the same ingredients but change a little prep and cook steps.  I prep everything first it took me about 1 hr but it made the cooking easy.  I had a problem understanding making the the grits.  Then I realized that I needed to cook the grits on medium for 20 mins instead of bringing to boil and dropping the heat to low for 20 mins.  I think that 8 serving was good for the meat/vegetable mix but you may need to double the grits amount. If you like grits.   I changed the grit  ratio to 1 cup  grit and 5 cups  water.

Cook the bacon first, add an extra slice or two and use the extra when making the grits.  Next day leftovers make for great breakfast fried cheese grits.

I liked! First time cooking or eating shrimp and grits. I added oregano and some other herb to my shrimp marinade for more flavor. Regular grits would have sufficed, no need for the extra cheese and calories. Sauce would work great on some rice too!

This was great. I did add a little more chicken broth to get the consistence i wanted. The flavor was top knotch and i believe it is just as good if not better than some of the well known resturants here in Savannah Ga.

Fantastic recipe!  Literally the only thing I did differently was sprinkle the bacon on top rather then stir it in.   This is the way great Shrimp & Grits is supposed to taste.   I appreciated the review suggesting to make the bacon, brown the sausage and make the roux early in the day so it’s easy to put this together at crunch time!

I had no idea just how amazingly delicious this was going to be.  We didn't change a thing, just followed the recipe right down the line.  We didn't scrimp on the shrimp and got the real andouille sausage, and I'm glad we did.  It was fantastic! After finishing (my second helping) I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven.  I am kicking myself for not making this before now!  Run, don't walk to your nearest grocery store and make this tonight!

This is the second time I made this recipe....its Perfection. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the andouille sausage (not a fan of the heat in andouille), and it was devine. This time I followed it exactly again but used a New Orleans flavor Johnsonville sausage (mild heat but nice smoke)....OMG....talk about the perfect comfort food. The grits are perfectly creamy and cheesy....and the shrimp mixture is just perfection.

Great recipe overall.  **IF** I were to change anything next time, I would reduce water to 2 1/2 cups (slightly thicken the grits) and decrease the sausage to 3/4 cup (increase shrimp to sausage ratio).

I made this after having sampled the cuisine in New Orleans, which included Shrimp and Grits. This is the most delicious dish I have ever made. I'm not even kidding.

This was too spicy for 6 year old, but hubs & I really liked it. Next time I'll just keep my child's portion away from the andouille sausage.  I did not have any half & half, made the roux with out it, just used milk & chicken broth from a can. Didn't bother with the bacon because the sausage was plenty fatty.  Next time I'd try harder to find a turkey andouille sausage, the Smithfield I used needed to be drained & set on paper towels. I used Quaker instant grits & used a lot less grated cheese.  I used 3 pans to get this one done & it really didn't take too much time.

Very tasty, rich, & filling.  I would recommend 2 changes: First, I simmer (perk) my grit for 30-40 minutes to make them as fluffy as possible.  Undercooked, grainy grit are not southern style & not worth eating in my estimation...usually prepared by a yankee. Last, I would make half the amount of roux in the future or be prepared to add additional chicken stock.

My wife doesn't ordinarily eat grits, but thoroughly enjoyed these w/ sharp cheddar, cooked to death.  Smoked sausage works well too; don't like andouille

I had out of town guest and was trying to figure out something simple to make.  This is a complete meal however I did add a tossed green salad.  I didn't add the Worcestershire sauce and used less of the vegetables but it still was excellent! I received many compliments on this one along with a request for the recipe.  Much better than recipes I've tried in the past!  I also garnished with chopped green onion.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was absolutely rich and delicious, but I thought could have used a little more acid.  I think I'll try adding tomatoes and maybe a little more worchestershire.  I think I was a little too light on the cayenne for the shrimp, too.  I didn't sense the heat much at all except in the sausage. My hubby from Charleston said it was as good as any shrimp & grits he's ever had at a restaurant!

This is very very tasty and very spicy!  I may switch to a less fiery sausage choice next time.  You should also note that this recipe takes a lot of prep and every pot in your kitchen will be dirty when you're done:-)  In the end, it will be worth the effort.  Thanks for posting!

Wonderful. I did not use yellow bell pepper, because I did not have one. I eliminated the cayenne because my mother swears she cannot do spicy food, and I just forgot about the garlic. I almost stopped short of doing the bacon, but since my mother was cooking bacon at the time,I added it in. But, the recipe is plenty of flavor without it. I planned to eliminate the roux portion of the recipe, but, I was on a roll, so I challenged myself to finish off the gravy. The family loved it. I highly recommend the recipe.

I'm planning to make this dish Tuesday.  Will follow all instructions, but instead of cheddar cheese in the grits, I will use smoked Gouda - everyone loves the smoked Gouda.  I may even substitute Conecuh sausage (spicey) for the andouille.  But, I may use both.  I'll let you know.

I halved the recipe. Followed to spec except added slightly more garlic and garnished with red pepper flakes (hot sprinkles) and fresh chives. I also brined the shrimp for an hour. This was very good, but to make it five stars next time, I will omit the andouille and possible add a squeeze of fresh lemon for brightness upon serving. The andouille was totally unnecessary and actually weighted the dish down in my and my husband’s opinions.

My family loved this recipe!  I cooked the grits in chicken broth instead of water and made them extra cheesy with some leftover Gruyere in with the cheddar.  We found a great smoked andouille sausage.    Will definitely make this again!

I have prepared shrimp and grits several times before, but decided to use this recipe this last time. Let me tell you, this was the best shrimp and grits that I have ever prepared!!! It was rich in flavor, and a very hearty meal. I will definitely be using this recipe again the next time I prepare shrimp and grits!!

My first review here ever  but I had to.  It was soo good!  Came out like my very favorite restaurant dishes, and I get it a lot.  Used milk vs. cream but still really creamy grits.  Note that making the roux in step 7 takes more than 8 minutes while shrimp/peppers/sausage wait, so the shrimp was a little too done.  If I'd realized that, I'd have heated less before stopping to make the roux. Otherwise perfect.

My husband absolutely RAVED about this recipe. He took some leftovers to work and several people begged him to give them the recipe. The only thing I changed was to cut down the bell peppers - a lot (we are not big fans). This is definitely going in my recipe box.

I have never had shrimp and grits.  The love of my life has had it at many different  restaurants and is very familiar with all different styles.  He likes to give me meal challenges as I am always asking what he wants for dinner.  I love a good challenge.  This recipe was a HUGE hit!  Excellent recipe!

I made this dish for a family brunch to celebrate my sister's retirement after 20+ years in the military.  The dish was a BIG HIT! The pots in my home were scraped clean.  Everyone was raving over how flavorful it was.  This was my first time ever preparing shrimp and grits myself and this was easy to make and so very tasty.  I would suggest this to anyone novice or chef level cook if you enjoy shrimp and grits, make this you will not be disappointed!

No changes other than to have the portions as I was cooking for my wife and I.  I timed the preparation with my wife coming home from work.   At first glance she was ready to poo-poo it but after trying, she was very impressed.   This will definitely be added to the list of my signature dishes.

I love shrimp and grits and frequently order it when I’m out. I’m from south Mississippi and my standards are high. I decided I wanted to try my hand at home and found this recipe. The only changes I made were substituting some of the salt for tony cacheres and omitting the yellow pepper (but only because the pepper I bought was bad once I cut into it). Next time I may cut down the overall salt just a little but but overall this is a win!

This is the best thing I ever made and I cook a lot. It’s also maybe the best thing I ever ate which is insane to even say because I travel often, live in the Mecca of food heaven - NYC, and have also been to Charleston. This recipe is to dieeeeee for.
My dinner guests and husband were beside themselves.

This recipe is outstanding! I live in Charleston and have tried shrimp and grits all over town, in a quest to find the best. This is as good as, or better than, anything you'll find in the best restaurants.
Don't change a thing...just enjoy!

Holy moly, what a hit at my house. I made this for my in-laws and everybody loved it. Having good quality shrimp is key. I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of making more grits and using some Cajun seasoning (from spicesinc.com) on the shrimp and end product. Will most certainly make again.

I very rarely leave reviews and with that said I just had to say this could be the best recipe I have ever tried on allrecipes!  I can no longer order Shrimp and Grits when I go out because they simply are not going to be able to come close to this. The only place I know of that gets remotely close is a little place at Hilton Head. Absolutely Devine!

I have searched for a really good shrimp and grits recipe for several years now.  A few have come close, but this one takes first place in my book.   It is fabulous as written, but also versatile - The last time I made it,  I didn't have the sausage, so I just left it out.  I have used all green peppers, but it is much prettier when using red and/or yellow peppers.  The grits portion of the recipe is spot on.

I found it to be too salty and a little off on the flavors. Maybe too much happening at once. I will give it one more try and attempt a smoother consistency  on the grits. Will replace water with broth and omit salt as suggested. My flour and butter became a gooey substance in my pot so will give that a second shot but also think I could skip that entire step and would have enjoyed this more.

The first time I make a recipe I always make it “as is” and change per my preference if needed. This needs no changing - very authentic Charleston style shrimp and grits. I live in the south and have had shrimp and grits in many places. These are truly wonderful! I “might” add a tad less half & half next time but then again I may not. What do they say about messing with a good thing.....?

I made this for the second time last night.....it is the best shrimp and grits EVER!!!  Hubs reports that it is better than Taqueria del sol's in Atlanta (and their's is excellent!).  Whew, it takes a lot of time to prepare, though, so I suggest chopping veggies and frying bacon and sausage early in the day.

This recipe deserves every star... it is my new favorite.  I had only made shrimp at home once before and it was a disaster.  I had never made grits in my life.  That shows that this recipe was amazing.

TIPS: As others have stated, I cooked my grits in chicken broth.  Which made it easy to just buy a 32oz container for the entire recipe.  Also, I don't think the recipe is clear enough that you should make the brown gravy at the same time you are cooking the onion/pepper/garlic combo.  That way you drop the shrimp in after the sauce is done.  Makes for more even cooking.  I also used one short cut, using reserved bacon grease and bacon bits vs. cooking the bacon at the time of this recipe.  Oh, and when re-heating leftovers (also great the second day), if you add a little bit of half and half or milk to the grits it helps reconstitute the texture.

I will continue to make this again and again, much to the delight of my husband!

This recipe is spot on!!! I followed the  recipe exactly with one very minor change,  a little  more chicken stock was needed to loosen the sauce.  I recommend cooking your roux (flour /butter mixture) to a medium brown.  This gives the dish a more complex flavor and richer color.   Fresh green onion as a garnish makes it perfect and adds to the appearance at serving.   We  live on the coast of North Carolina and this is an EXCELLENT recipe for anyone wanting to try traditional southern-coastal dish.   A $100 meal for a fraction of the cost!

This recipe takes a long time and a lot of pans, which I don't love. And when you taste all the components separately, you really don't think it's going to be all that good.  But, this was delicious! It tastes like something you would get at a very nice brunch/lunch restaurant. It even taste good as leftovers the next day!

Great flavors! I will make this again. Only thing I had to do different was use quick grits because I can't find real grits in MN. I followed the recipe posted on here and they turned out really good, just didn't have to cook them as long.

I am so happy that the first time I ever ate or made grits it was with this recipe. I have made it on 3 separate brunch occasions and it was always a hit! I found it to be served best with my jalapeño cheddar corn soufflé and Bloody Mary! It made fathers days special and for dessert chef John Banana Fosters!

Made this with 2 adjustments. First save the shrimp heads and tails to make a broth to boil the grits in. Shrimp flavor permeates the grits and eliminates the need for cheese.  Serve with Tabasco sauce to taste.

Time consuming recipes with multiple ingredients.  Neither my husband or I enjoyed the dish.  It was very bland except for the Andouille sausage, which over powered the recipes.  Will not make it again.

Truly a winning recipe!  I did omit the Worcestershire Sauce as it made it too salty. I prefer the peppers a bit under cooked, so I saute'd the onions alone and added the peppers after.  Bravo!

OMG!!! This is fantastic & deserves more stars.  Didn't change a thing in regards to the main dish, but did use quick grits instead because that is what I had.  I hate to use shrimp, which is costly here, for something like this instead of straight on the grill, but I'll "sacrifice" because this is sooooo good.  I do think the half & half & cheddar cheese make the grits so smooth & creamy.  The rest of this dish is pure flavor.

We just got back from Sputh Carolina and I had shrimp and grits from Plums in Beaufort. I was craving it, so decided to give this recipe a try. This was delicious! I was a little stressed while making this because I was  making it for the first time for my mother-in-law. In my stress, I totally skipped seasoning the shrimp!  It was still delicious! I did make sure that I bought the good grits, not instant. Except for the shrimp, I followed the recipe to the letter! Wonderful!!!

So good you could make for guests without practicing. I had to use two pots-mine weren't big enough for the full recipe. Takes more than 1 hour 15. You could do steps 1,3,4,5,and 9 the morning or day before. I would only cook the shrimp and roux at the last minute. De-lish!

Delicious!  I used creole smoked sausage because I couldn't find andouille, and I am glad I did.  The spices in  the sausage really enhanced the flavor.  Also, garnished with some chopped cilantro which added a fresh element to an otherwise very heavy dish.

Delicious & so hearty/filling. Next time, i will cut back on cayenne or omit altogether. I prepped everything early in the day & cooked the sausage & bacon. Made cooking later a breeze. Made as written for 6. My first time to eat shrimp and grits and it will now be a favorite at least a couple times a year! I wasn't sure what to serve with it so i just made corn muffins & served with a glass of white wine. I can easily see making this for guests, it's that good. Far surpasses a meal in a restaurant. Thank you for posting this mouthwatering recipe. I am considering eating this leftover for breakfast. LOL

This recipe was exceptional.  I did not have to make any modifications.  I had a brunch for my mother and by far this was the favorite dish of my guests.  They could not stop raving about how good it was.

Amazing recipe! I don't even usually like grits and I ate every bit of this recipe - two helpings. The seasonings were perfect and the depth of flavor was outstanding. Make this recipe as written and Don't change a thing; you won't regret it.

I love shrimp and grits and have been looking for a recipe that makes it like in the south (I grew up in GA). The recipe is the best I've tried. I did skip the andouille sausage and it still came out great. Even my husband who grew up in the NE loved it. Definitely making this again. Thanks!!

I really like this recipe mostly because I like shrimp and grits although never together before. It is an unusual combination. My family, however, is primarily used to grits with sugar and syrup as a breakfast and as a result was not sold on the unusual dinner. I will warn anyone interested in trying this recipe that it is very, very filling. Feels like eating a five course meal when you get done!

Excellent!  My hubby loved this dish! Very filling, unfortunately I had to use the store brought instant grits, as I could not find the old fashioned grits.  The only modifications that I made is that I used, 2% milk instead of half and half, I forgot the lemon so I used Lemon pepper seasoning to replace the lemon and cayenne pepper.  As my kids are not too keen on spicy foods. I also used margarine instead of butter.

I made this for dinner tonight and got rave reviews. Fabulous flavors and flavor combinations. No grits in the pantry, so I made polenta instead using half & half and broth. I think that added to the depth of the flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious! But as usual I didn't have all the ingredients. I had to substitute the flour with pancake mix since I didn't realize we were out and I had to substitute worcestershire sauce with hickory smoke flavoring. Milk instead of half and half, and no lemon. Oh, also I used kielbasa since our market didn't have andouille sausage. I know I substituted a lot of ingredients but still wanted to share to let you guys know that these substitutions worked!!! The meal was a hit and I'll definitely be making it again!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and LOVED IT!  Made it again and added a well-drained can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and that was equally good.  My husband really hates grits, so I made him some yellow rice for him and he loved it too.  Definitely a keeper, thank you!

this was very tasty, great flavor but way too much butter.  also, it's a lot of pots and pans.  would probably make this again but cut back on the butter.  I made my grits in a crock pot which saved tons of time.

I was really looking forward to this but the grits are terrible. 2  teaspoons of salt is way to much and the grits were extremely salty.  I am new to making grits so I will know better next time.

I gave the recipe a four because it was time-consuming and the directions were difficult to follow.  That being said, I thought I would never make it again... Until we tasted it.  IT WAS WONDERFUL.  I enjoyed it more than my favorite shrimp 'n grits place in Murrell's Inlet, SC.  My husband thought it was perfect southern, comfort food, especially up here in Northern Illinois. It did take a lot longer for the grits to thicken than the recipe said; at least twice as long.  I also used two cups of broth to make the sauce.  I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN!

Loved it. Needs more than one cup of chicken stock to keep the gravy from getting too thick while the shrimp cook. Otherwise, perfect!

I don't usually review recipes, but this was amazing. I'm from the Midwest where grits aren't really a thing. In fact, I had a hard time finding them, but it was well worth it. The synergy of the shrimp and veggies with the cheesy grits was absolutely amazing.

This is the best recipe ever!  My family couldnt get enough of it.  It's better than "Rita's" at Folly beach, and that's saying something! I did make a few changes though.  I didn't have any half and half, so I used can milk in its place;  I used smoked sausage instead of  andouiIle sausage;  I didn't have the yellow bell pepper so had to omit.  I thought I had stone ground grits, but I only had quick grits.  I also used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water instead of the 3 cups of water.

I added a can of drained Ro-Tel and some liquid smoke.   I also kicked up the cayenne a bit. Next time, I’m going to add a splash of dark coffee (same concept as red-eye gravy). Not to brag, but it’s as good as I’ve ever eaten.

I think this is a great recipe, with a couple notes. Im an old Southern Scratch cook. Born and raised. I believe the addition of half and half to the Grits is a fairly new addition to the recipe created by a Charleston chef. Yes, it makes it creamier, but don’t believe its the original old time recipe. Also, if you want to add some flavor, add bits of country ham with the bacon. Gives it a truly kicked up flavor. (My opinion only) thanks

Great meal, worth making again. I forgot to add the half and half to the grits so I’ll probably just skip it next time too.

I made this dish for third time last weekend. It turned out as good as the other two times. It makes so much I freeze what we have left over for a quick weeknight dinner. This has become one of my family’s favorite dishes.

The best shrimp and grits I have made or eaten! Only difference with mine was I had no bacon. The grits were so creamy and there was just enough spice for a bit of a bite. I will definitely make these again.

I used Rogerwoods sausage instead of the sausage it calls for and I also did not use the bell peppers (not a big fan of). All other ingredients I used and it was AMAZING!  I also used instant grits (2nd time made), instead of regular grits and you could not tell the difference and it cut down on cook time. Cooked everything first and whipped up instant grits with cheese last and it was absolutely delicious!  This is one of our families regular main course dishes now. Love this recipe!

I’ve used this recipe twice in the last month! So, so good.  I’ve always thought shrimp and grits were over rated but the hubby loves it. First time straight by the recipe. I loved it. Second go round I browned the roux to a deep brown and substituted chorizo for the andouille (had a lb. of homade in the freezer). Off the hook delicious!

Oh my goodness! This stuff is amazing. I made a few mistakes, like putting twice as much cheese in the cheese grits but I will be making my cheese grits like this from now on. I would suggest getting your sausage and vegetables chopped before you begin cooking to speed up the process. It is a dish best served right when ready but my oh my. It is well worth the time.

I must honestly say that I didn’t believe this was going to be as good as it was, but like all recipes on allrecipes.com, I was blown away. I wouldn’t change anything. I did use chicken broth as recommended in video and the flavors were phenomenal. I didn’t go heavy on the cayenne, but I regret it because the extra heat would’ve made this perfect +dish a perfect ++dish, lol. The grits alone were delicious by themselves. This was my first time using a roux to make gravy (usually cheese sauce) but it was packed with so much flavor without even adding any personal kick to it. I can’t wait to elevate this dish with lump crab meat.

This has become a go to recipe of mine! Instead of adding the bacon to the roux, I garnish with it because I don’t like soggy bacon. As a garnish it gives the fish a nice crunch!

I added 1/2 cup of homemade tomato sauce to give it a little color.  Great recipe.

This was excellent... although grits are not a favorite of a few in the family. I think this would also be great with white rice cooked up in chicken broth, garlic and scallions. Not the sprit if the dish but another way to enjoy this awesome recipe for the grits haters.

We enjoyed this recipe the first night, but it was much better the second day as left overs.  I used a large pot, put the grits around the edge and the shrimp mixture in the middle then added some chicken broth for some liquid to heat it.

I love this recipe and have made it at least 3 times in a few months. I had always wanted to make Shrimp and Grits, but I didn’t want it to be a long, drawn out process. This is recipe is just perfect and so easy to make. I even accidentally left out the Worcester sauce and the minced garlic the first time and it still was super delicious.  This is definitely restaurant quality dish and I will continue using this recipe for years to come.

Perfection!   I rarely review recipes but I had to ensure I did for this outstanding recipe.  Neither my husband nor I like grits, but we loved them in this recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and it is honestly one of the best recipes I have ever made.  I can’t wait to make for my family in the South!

(made it only once) First, I cut the recipe to 2 servings instead of 8--that was plenty for the two of us. I did not have andouille sausage so  I  used Kielbasa. I did not have coarse grits, so I used regular grits. I had only green and red peppers so I doubled up on the green. I had only heavy cream so I used half heavy and half 1%. Despite the changes, it came out very good and I will make it again, hoping to use the coarse grits. My husband is wary of the new dishes I try on the internet, but he liked this one.

I usually make the recipe by the book on the first try. This one, however, I used polenta and used more flour than it called for. I also put some hot sauce in the grits as well. I did that because I felt that the additions would be worth it and it was. Great altogether.

Very simple to make and it came out delicious. I did not have andoullie so I substituted bratwurst which I cut up and seasoned with Cajun seasoning. I also substituted chicken broth for the water in the grits for extra flavor.

Just make this for 12 family and friends in Charleston SC. Used leftovers shrimp and sausage from a low country boil. CRUSHED IT! This was restaurant quality dish and I even forgot to use the crumbled bacon.

Awesome!  Better than any shrimp and grits I've had in some of the best restaurants. I'll probably back off the cayenne pepper to one tsp next time, my wife can't handle the spice. Also, you can't make a golden brown rue in 8 minutes, but it's necessary to get the rue good and golden brown.

holy cow I love this recipe for the ingredients!  I do order of operations differently so as to dirty fewer dishes, but the ingredients and proportions are spot on.  as another reviewer stated, add or subtract what you want to your tastes, but definitely try as written first.  you will not be disappointed!  thanks again for the recipe!  definitely a keeper!

Excellent. I have made this multiple times, and it is always a crowed pleaser. 
One change only - I make my grits last, not first:)

Took far too long to make for a lackluster dish. I had to doctor it up quite a bit with cajun seasoning and it was far too heavy on the lemon. Not nearly enough spices used.

First time eating shrimp and grits. As a New Yorker I was very hesitant about the idea of shrimp with my grits. Made for my husband who loves shrimp and grits and he said he loved it minus the bacon. I loved it!

I skipped the bacon but did use Conecah sausage and it came out great. I went light on the cayenne pepper and I'm so glad I did. But this dish came out perfect.

We loved this recipe!    I made it as written and it was delicious.  After it was done, off the heat, I threw in a hand ful of grape tomatoes, halved and put the lid on for a few minutes before serving.  Not needed, but really good! I only added them to use them up.
Needs no tweaking

Delicious! I didn't even have the andouille sausage and it was still amazing.  I simply increased the shrimp and cayenne.  Don't skip the bacon; the smokey saltiness it adds makes the dish.  The downside is it is time consuming to prepare (a little over 1 hour) but worth it.  When I don't have the time, I will stick with the Garlic Shrimp and Cheesy Grits from this site, because it takes half the time to make and still tastes good enough when you are in the mood for shrimp and grits.

OMG.... all I can say is yummnm! I was initially hesitant to try to make this,  as I've never before attempted to make shrimp and grits. But boy am I glad I did! The only change to the recipe for me was the addition of sliced baby Bella mushrooms to the onion and garlic sautee, simply because we love them, plus a touch more Worcestershire than called for. The rest of the recipe was followed pretty much to the tee.  My husband is a shrimp-n-grits snob, lol, and even he said this was a keeper! This will most definitely be in my dinner rotation from now on!

Followed the directions, except used chicken stock in the grits & sharp cheddar cheese (will probably use mild next time).  First thing hubby said was, "this is really good".  A definite keeper.  

I had to make a 2nd mini batch because son is allergic to shrimp.  I used a soft white fish instead....and I thought it tasted wonderful. 

Will definitely be adding to our dinner menus.

Tips: Fry up the shrimp in a pan, and remove the shrimp just right before it is completely cooked to set aside (you will continue to cook it later on, so you want to avoid overcooking shrimp). Create the sauce separately--Use the pan used to cook the shrimp to melt butter, and add flour to make the roux. Then when it is golden brown, add chicken stock and create a nice thick and smooth sauce, and taste it (add worcestershire sauce, salt/spices) before removing it from the heat. Once you have the sauce made, set it aside. Final step- Combine all of the sauteed vegetables, shrimp, sausage together and heat thoroughly. Then, add the roux sauce to everything.

I believe the first time I had Shrimp and Grits was in Charleston. As anyone who has been there knows, the food is utterly amazing! I was reminded of the dish yesterday and went on a search for a recipe when I came across this. My husband and I agree...this is the BEST DISH I HAVE EVER MADE! Oh my goodness, it was so wonderful! Make it, and bask in this southern comfort food!

Would make it again and again and again. Love this!  The andouille sausage, shrimp and bacon combo make this recipe a winner. I love all of the combination of flavors. I’ve never eaten grits before, so I’m glad that this recipe was how they were introduced! Mmm! Que rico!

This came out wonderfully flavorful. My wife said it is "company worthy." 

Please note there are a lot of ingredients and steps to this recipe. I ended up with a lot of dirty pots, pans, and measuring cups. And the prep time was considerably more that 30 minutes because I bought fresh, head-on shrimp and had to shell them but fresh ingredients are so worth the extra time. 

Next time I make it (and there surely will be a next time) I will make the final combination sooner. I cooked the veggies longer than I should have and they were a little soft for my taste - not the fault of the recipe but of the cook. Also, I recommend you take it easy with the cayenne. It is very easy to go beyond "pleasantly spicy" and into "pass the milk" heat.

Just a brief comment on the grits: I was unable to find "coarse ground grits" but did find Quaker Old Fashioned Grits that have the 15-20 minute cook time. They came out very creamy and smooth, but what would you expect when they were made with 2 cups of half-and-half.

I used grated sharp cheddar because we like sharp cheese. The only other change I made was taken from someone else's comment to garnish the served dish with a few sprinkles of paprika and some dried chopped chives. 

I highly recommend this recipe and look forward to making it again.

I made a couple of changes as I did not have andouille sausage on hand so I used smoked turkey sausage sliced. I also made the grits with 2% milk as recommended by another reviewer. And I added 8 ox of sliced mushrooms.

I Do not eat grits. But this recipe is phenomenal.  We make it when we go camping and ALWAYS look forward to it.
If you never tried it, you owe it to your taste buds.

I don't get to the South very often (NC or SC on vacation, basically), but when I do, I always have to get some shrimp and grits.  This was the first time I've ever made it myself, and this recipe was WONDERFUL.  The andouille sausage really added to the flavor, and I loved it.  No one else in my family of 3 will eat grits, so I made enough of everything else to share some with my husband and made a 1/3 cup of grits  just for me.  I will absolutely positively make this again.  This is one of the best recipes I've ever made from this website, hands down.  Thanks for giving me a "taste of the South" between vacations!!!

I LOVE Shrimp and grits! I had never made it before and tried this recipe for the first time this morning. it was fantastic! i actually forgot to add the cheese but it melted right in the bowl when stirred in with the grits. I did take one recommendation and used 2% milk instead of half/half. I also used only 1 cup of the milk,  instead of 2. I allowed the bacon and audoulie sausage to cooked at the same time in the same pan. So, there was alot of left over oil to add to the flavor of the roux. It is pretty savory, so will eat it for dinner instead of breakfast next time. I'm sold on this recipe!

I didn't add the sausage.  I used turkey bacon because my youngest does not eat pork or beef.  
The recipe turned out really good! This was my first time making it.  My family really loved it and there were no leftovers.  I'm going to make it again and serve it during a brunch for friends.

It is very good.  The only change I made was seasoning the vegetables.  It probably didnt need it because it will be seasoned when mixed.  I will also bake the bacon next time bc my stove bacon never turns out right.

Very good! 4 stars because of technique. First, it ses too many pans. I cooked the bacon and andouille in the same pan (bacon first bcs it was chicken andouille). I also added the broth (I made shrimp broth from the shells) to the roux before adding to the other ingredients. It needed a bit more liquid, but that may have been the King Arthur flour. I only had a pound of shrimp, but that was plenty for four.  I also made more grits (1 1/2 grits, 3 cups water). I will definitely make again.

Did Not Have Time To Make Rue 
So I Used Creole Brown Gravy Mix.
It Makes 2 Cups of Gravy so I used only 1 cup of water with the mix that called for 2 Cups of Water.
 I wanted to make sure the gravy would get thick enough It did !!
Real Good From Spouse and Son!!

I signed up for an AllRecipes account just so I could rate and review this. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever made. My photo looks terrible but don't let that deter you. This is worth every single calorie, which is convenient because I made this during the Romainegate 2018 when the lettuce could kill you.

Yes I would definitely make this again.  I did modify this by using chicken broth instead of water for the grits (low sodium) and I used milk because that is what I had and it worked. I also used twice the amount of cheese (personal preference)

I made this into my own creation by doing a little modification on it.  HOWEVER, it didn't really need any modification.  I have to say this is the best recipe....ever.

Only change I made to the recipe is I use smoked sausage and I didn't have red and green peppers so I just use green onions and onions. It was really really good, my husband loved it!

I'm from the south and love a good shrimp and grits recipe.  This is awesome.  It takes some patience, but so worth it!  I brought it to a potluck at work and the raves were endless.

I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 3 cups of water.  I also love mushrooms so I added fresh sautéed mushrooms.  Added 1/4 cup of Worcestshire sauce instead of 1/4 a teaspoon.  A hit for my family of four!!!

Loved it - I made it without the bacon and sausage- super yummy still! But definitely want to try with the whole recipe next time. 
I made with frozen pre cooked shrimp so it didn't take to long to cook either.

Delicious, alot of dishes tho! Need to streamline somehow. Sadly kids thot it was too spicy, too many veggies but they've never had anything like this before. We eat more plain and Mexican. Also I used half of each veg.

tis was delicious.  I used "slap your mamma" new orleans spices instead of cayenne and fried eggs to put on top.  also increased the amount of Worcestershire sauce and add a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.  It was delicious.  Also we used instant grits and it was fine!

This recipe was fairly easy to do with some help. If I made this at my house then I would get everything chopped and everything prepped first. I had to have someone make sure that the roux didn't too hot while I was preparing the other.  It was completely operator error on my part, I thought that my shrimp had already been peeled.

But oh!! Was it worth it!

Shrimp and grits are one of my favs.  This recipe is wonderful.  I really let the roux brown, it builds a ton of flavor that way.  Definitely will make again.

Very delicious! I put 2 cups of cheese in the grits because I like mine extra cheesy. I also added a little bit of Tony Chachieri’s Cajun seasoning to the mixture (to taste) and it turned out wonderfully!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! It will now make a frequent appearance at my house. There are a lot of ingredients, and it’s not cheap to make. However, it is absolutely delicious! Passed the recipe on to the people I know who love to cook, too.

Recipe Note: I’m not a huge fan of bacon — I know, I know. So, I made it without and it was still amazing. Also, I prefer a bigger kick, so I added more cayenne and I made sure to buy Cajun style andouille sausage. Used about 2 cups of sharp cheddar in the grits to make them cheesier, and garnished with a little scallions.

It is absolutely delicious!!! I added abt 1T seafood magic and it was perfect! I also cooked the roux until it was milk chocolate in color, which takes a lot longer than 10 minutes. It is so worth it! Make this dish! You won’t be disappointed!

Juiced 2 lemons. Garlic powder vs. fresh.  Cooked grits in chicken broth. Followed the rest of the recipe to a T and it’s top 3 ever.

Perfect as-is. Hubby loved it. I halved because I wasn’t sure we would or could eat it all but now I know...shoulda made the whole thing!  Had to make it in stages because of interruptions but this recipe is perfect for that.

I took the shells of the shrimp and boiled them with some ginger and then drained the shells and used the juice to cook my rice in. Also aftercooking everything I used some hoisen sauce and soy sauce and simmer everything for about 10 minutes on very low heat.

This was excellent as I am a huge shrimp and grits plan, but the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I will make 2 changes in the recipe.  First, instead on adding the flour to the mixture, add flour first the add liquid. It will make sauce thicken easier.. also, shrimp are overcooked after 5-6 min. This recipe has the shrimp cooking a lot longer than that.. drop your shrimp AFTER your sauce thickens, not during.

This is true Southern Shrimp & Grits. Having lived in Charleston, SC for years, I had tried it in many restaurants and made it myself. This is my FAV go-to recipe now. Made it for Hubby and for Date Nite Saturday, Huge success!
I only mad a couple of slight changes. I substituted chicken broth for water, richer flavor, and 2% lactose free milk (hubby has lactose issues) for heavy cream.  Will make this again and again!  Thanks for a Taste of Charleston recipe!

This  was delicious!  I omitted the yellow and red pepper because I didn’t have it.  I also didn’t have any bacon.  I was a little worried that it may not be as flavorful without the bacon grease.  It did not taste like it was missing anything.  My husband loved it!

My husband loves shrimp and grits, and he gave a big thumbs up on this recipe!  The grits were creamy, and the shrimp and sausage mixture was flavorful and had a nice, smooth consistency. I made one change. I cut back on the amount of bell peppers the recipe calls for. After I finely diced the peppers, it looked like too much for my taste. I used half of each pepper. I definitely will be making this recipe again!

The base of the recipe is so good, you really can't mess it up easy.  I looked at it and made a few changes on timing and had to adjust for the type of grits I could find.  No major changes, it' perfect just like it is, but you can adjust a little if needed.  

I asked my family of very picky eaters to rate it on a scale of 1-10.  It was a big ole 10!

Delicious and satisfying! Definitely get all your ingredients out, do your chopping and measuring before you start cooking. Takes time, but worth it.

Delicious recipe! I had frozen shrimp on hand. Cooking them made a broth that I thought would be too much liquid to add the chicken broth. I also doubled the amount of cheese in the grits. Delicious!!!

We followed  the directions almost to a T. We added a little bit more Cayanne pepper because we like it spicier. That did the trick. We’ve been to Charleston and had shrimp and grits at several places and what we made was amazing.

This is amazing ! I thought half way thru it was way too many steps - way too much kitchen mess - but OMG - it was completely worth it ! Be careful with the salt - it's a gumbo flavor with the dark roux and trinity . Really really good !

Used good stone ground grits instead, substituting chicken stock fro about half the water.  The additional time required to cook real grits add abpit half an hour to the total time, but the taste and texture is well worth it.

I'm only giving it 5 stars because my husband talked about how good it was 2 days later. I don't like grits. Therefore, I have to trust his word. I made the dish for him.  I didn't use all the ingredients because it was only for him. I didn't no what to do to reduce the serving size without losing the taste. 

I didn't use a green bell pepper, the garlic or the bacon. Instead of using the sausage the recipe called for, I used turkey sausage because we are a little health conscious . He said it was good. I trust his word. :)

I’d never had shrimp and grits but had heard people rave about it and wanted to try it for myself.  I chose this recipe because I know Charleston is famous for its version and it had so many great reviews.   I was not disappointed:  it was fantastic!!!  In fact, my daughter and her boyfriend (for whom I made it) said they just went to an upscale Chicago restaurant and had it there and the shrimp and grits I made for them was “10x better”!  Wow!!!  I’m so grateful for AllRecipes because they never let me down; I can always find a recipe for anything I want to make and 99% of the time, I’m thrilled with the results!  Thanks for your amazing website/app—It makes me a better, more confident cook!!!  For those wondering whether to try this dish, DO IT!  You’ll be glad you did!!!

I've made shrimp and grits many times, but this was my first attempt with this recipe. It was fantastic!  The only changes I made were to make the recipe smaller, for just the two of us. I will make it again!

Very good recipes, especially the grits portion.  I am giving it four stars only because it requires a lot of work and you have to 'spin a lot of plates' to pull off this recipe.   I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is great!   Made it twice in less than 2 weeks for family.  Everyone LOVED it!  You can add more seasoning if you are really into spicy foods, but I think it’s perfect just the way it is.  I added chopped green onion as a garnish prior to serving.  Simply delicious.

Didn't have the sausage on hand, so the only protein was shrimp. I also added a small amount of fresh chopped tomato to the sauce at the end to jack up the acidity a bit. What a delicious, unctuous dish.

To paraphrase Paul Prudhomme: "When the first things to go into the pan are a stick of butter and some bacon,  your cook's prayer is  "Please lord, don't let me  screw this up.""   I made this as written for a dinner party (I used more  worstershire and garlic) and received a marriage proposal.  It was THAT good.

My husband and daughter both loved it.  I am not a grits fan, but these were creamy and delicious.  I typically make jambalaya and now will use this as an alternative and will rotate this into our meal planning.  My daughter said, "it's my new favorite".

Yummy and authentic are the two words that I would use to describe this recipe. The grits are super creamy and the stock and shrimp are flavorful. The andouille sausage gives it a little bite! Excellent

Perfect recipe and my family loved it! Prep as much as you can ahead of time to make the process easier. I always bake my bacon instead of pan cooking (keeps the house from smelling) and added a bit of olive oil to the vegetables after cooking the sausage (because there was no bacon grease in the pan to cook it in.)
Excellent recipe! I have already been told to make it again! So it's now in the regular recipe rotation!

Outstanding - best shrimp and grits that I have ever had.  Just be careful when thickening the sauce at the very end not to over cook the shrimp. A chef once told me that 
Shrimp is cooked when it achieves the shape of a "C" and is overcooked when it becomes the shape of an "O" so you have to be careful at step #8.  Highly recommend this recipe.

There are a lot of ingredients however this was DELICIOUS!! Better than many restaurant shrimp and grits I order in TX. My son is a picky eater with texture issues and he LOVED them. So did the hubby. Make them. Your family will think you're a culinary wizard!

The best thing I have ever made. I cooked this for my husband just as instructed and it came out phenomenal. I was also able to make a vegetarian friendly version with vegetarian sausage (no shrimp, bacon, or Worcestershire sauce) for myself and I absolutely loved it. Thank so you much for this amazing recipe. Definitely making it again!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have the sausage on hand and only used red, orange, and yellow peppers and it still came out amazing!!! A definite repeat here. For those of us who like a light cayenne flavor, I would definitely suggest a pinch as indicated on the 4 serving option. I sprinkled the cayenne and it definitely had a kick! Hubby asked that I serve this again...that's a huge compliment!

So good! I had to add another two cups of water to the meat and veggie mix to get a nice thinner gravy consistency. I also used whole milk instead of half & half in the grits.

This was delicious! I  omitted the sausage and added a few halved grape tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Easy to prepare, we loved it and it's even tastier the next day.

I am 55 years old and have never had grits so creamy! I did substitute the smoked sausage for the cajun sausage. My daughter had rice with her's. She doesn't like grits. But she did mention that the sausage and bacon was a great addition

This may be the most delicious meal I've ever tasted. I didn't know what "melt in your mouth" meant until I tasted it! I substituted beef smoked sausage for the andouille since I didn't have any and used 2% milk instead of half and half. As a Louisiana girl, I know better than to cook shrimp without crab boil. I soaked them in a teaspoon of crab boil and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice before cooking.

This was really good. I need to find a way to give this the same sweetness as the shrimp and grits I had at a couple restaurants in the Charleston area last week, but I would definitely use this recipe again.

Wonderful with grits.  For those that say too spicy, try this.  Clean the seeds and membrane out of the jalapeno and soak the pepper in 7-Up (not diet) for 30 min.  The longer you soak the milder it gets.

This recipe is amazing! Served this for a dinner party and everyone raved,even the ones who thought they may not care for it. The only thing I did different was omit the yellow peppers,  the peppers to me do add to the flavor some,but in my opinion it's a lot more for color so I used green and red. This recipe has gotten into my circulation for sure!

This is the best Shrimp & Grits recipe I have made.   I follow the recipe as stated and always get great reviews from family and friends.   This is my "go to" shrimp & grits recipe, it is very easy, and you can easily prep ingredients ahead of time.

I order shrimp and grits everywhere I go. I've  enjoyed Shrimp and grits all over Charleston and can say that this recipe is as good (better) than any I've ever had.  
There are several key elements that make this recipe great: bacon grease, the roux, and using stone ground grits with either cream or milk whisked.    My roux was an almond color. I think next time I'll go for a little darker color to add more richness.  
Other than usin milk instead of Half n Half, I followed the recipe .

It took me about an hour from start to finish but it was well worth it! I used chicken sausages,  fat-free half-and-half  and chicken broth in lieu of water for the grits. Fantastic all the way around!  It was even better the next day for breakfast :-)

WOW . . . fantastic! Pretty much made as written except for subbing chicken stock for the water when making the grits. Made this for 2 friends. Since this recipe takes some time, completed steps 2-6 (kept shrimp separate) before they arrived, and stored in fridge. About 30 or so minutes before wanting to serve dinner, completed steps 1, 7 (also add shrimp), and 8-9. Served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site. Enjoyed by everyone. The small amount left over got better by the next day. A definite make again!

4.5 stars.  I made 1/2 of the recipe which was more than enough for 2 with seconds and leftovers for another day.  Made as written.  This recipe has a lot of steps and prep, but it was very tasty....my husband really enjoyed it.  Oh...I did make polenta instead of grits.

This was very good and a little spicy (perfect).  I saved the leftovers and served it over white rice.  It remained very good.

So delicious! My wife was so impressed with this dish when I made it.  I cut out the bacon and used turkey sausage to cut out a little extra saturated fat and it was still amazing!  Will definitely make again

it's not something i'd indulge in more than 2 or 3 times a year, but I will most definitely be making this again.  it was absolutely delicious!  the only change I made was to use 3/4's cup cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup velveta  cheese.  I think the velveta makes the grits a little creamier.

Made this for a dinner party. Everyone agreed that its probably one of the best dishes we've ever eaten!! The only thing that I did different was to use Paul Prudhomme's dried peppers instead of cayenne pepper.

Did not make any changes and would use this again. It had great flavor that was robust but not too spicy. The only change I may make is to add a little more bacon.

Delicious!  Would recommend just 1 bell pepper.  Think  more would be too much.  Also used about 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth for more sauce.  Am going to try simmering the roux (flour/butter mixture) with the broth, onions, bell peppers, sausage and bacon  for  15-20 minutes to develop more flavor, before adding the shrimp in at the end to avoid overcooking it.  Will definitely make again.

I had never eaten shrimp & grits before because I am not a fan of grits, but, I thought I would give this a try.   I really liked the stone ground grits!  They tasted more like polenta than the quick grits that I have eaten before.  They were creamy and silky.  I thought the flavors worked together well and had just the right amount of spice.  It did take me a long time to get together, much longer than the recipe stated.

Let me start by saying my husband ate this till he hurt himself!  Basically, followed the directions, but I substituted what I had on hand for some of the ingredients:  turkey bacon for pork bacon, turkey sausage for andouille.  I diced the meat into small pieces and cooked them together in a little butter, since neither had sufficient fat content for a good fry.  Instead of using extra pans, I cooked the meat in a cast iron skillet.  When the bacon and sausage were nearly done, I moved them to the edges and cooked the veggies in the center.  Once the veggies were done, I moved the skillet onto another burner with the heat turned low to keep it warm .  Then I prepared the butter and flour mixture in a small sauce pan.  When it was ready, I added it to my skillet of meat and veggies, stirred until the sauce thickened, and then coverved the skillet to keep everything warm.  Now here comes the biggest change.  My shrimp, much to my dismay, had gone bad.  Disaster!!!   So, in act borne of equal parts desperation and inspiration, I poached a couple of eggs.  I arranged the meat/veggie mixture in a circle atop each bowl of grits and placed an egg in the center.  My husband was soooo impressed with the presentation and the taste.  Win-Win-Win.  BTW, I subbed equal parts milk and buttermilk for the half and half (because that's what I had) and cut the whole recipe in half.  It still made enough for my husband to eat himself into oblivion.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wow! This was amazing! It tasted better than the best shrimp and grits I've had in Charleston. I kept everything in the same pan. I cooked the veggies first then added all the other stuffed later. The only thing I did in a separate pan was the butter and flour mixture.

I didn't have andouille sausage or half & half so I used  smoked sausage and a can of Carnation condensed milk instead.  Also only had cooked shrimp so I added it at the very end just to heat it through.  My family liked it  so much they  said to be sure to keep this recipe , it was that good.   I just wish the prep time was shorter.  Made 3/2007

This recipe  is PHENOMENAL! Even my teenage sons loves it and one of them is very finicky. Just enough heat, saltiness, creaminess, etc. 

Unlike many folks that give it 5 stars then alter the entire recipe, I've actually made it exactly to the tee and it is fabulous as written. I've made it numerous times and have since changed a few ingredients here or there ONLY bc I didn't have all of the listed ingredients, but I've found that the best version for me has been the version as written. Enjoy! :)

Wow wow wow!  The only change I made was using 5-minute grits (I'm from MN and that's all we have here!) with chicken broth instead of water.  I added the lemon juice with the shrimp at the end and wish I hadn't because the sauce never really did thicken up.  This fish was amazingly delicious!  Of course there are ways to cut calories that I will try to maximize next time and see how the taste compares. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as directed, only feedback is that the grits will be smooth and creamy after approximately 30 minutes or so and may require more liquid, otherwise I used frozen shrimp that were shelled and deveined to save time. Make sure you have some crunchy French bread to sop up every bite!

This is now my favorite S&G recipe. If you have access to Conecuh brand smoked sausage, use that. I've had countless kinds/brands of smoked sausage, and Conecuh is the best by far. I have no connection to that brand other than an addiction.  I skip the cayenne pepper as my wife is sensitive to spicy heat. Chopping the onion/peppers the night before as well as cubing sausage and chopping bacon saves prep time when ready to cook.  You can fry the sausage and bacon together, no need to do it in different steps.

It just wasn't as zesty as I hoped so I added garlic salt. More lemon would be ideal but I didn't have an extra. Boyfriend and nine year old daughter loved it. I loved it too but hated the prep time and the many steps it required. Also used a lot of pans but no prob, I let them clean up ;)

The dish was absolutely delicious.  I did use McCormick's Grill Mate Montreal Steak Smoked Sausage and White Cheddar Cheese but followed the rest of the recipe.  This is definitely a must-try dish.  100% Restaurant Quality.

I had to try this recipe just because no one was hardly changing it at all in the comments section.  Oh there were a few suggestions of  minor additions or subtractions, but in general, just make it and enjoy it.  And I did EXACTLY like the recipe read...and man, everyone loved it!  This is the real deal, people.  Want to make a great southern dish?  You found it!

This is a terrific recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T, and I'm glad that I did.  The grits were creamy and flavourful, better than any polenta or grits I've made in the past.  The sauce has a nice kick to it, and the sausage works so well with the shrimp.  A new family fav!

Very good! My only adjustment would be to double sauce portion, I prefer my shrimp and grits to have a lot of sauce.   Will definitely make again!

All done!!! Definitely need multiple large burners to do it in a shorter period of time.  I was constantly using a howl to free up my largest skillet.  But it's definitely worth it.  My only substitute was using some slap yo momma creole seasoning on the shrimp instead of just cayenne and salt.  Sooo delicious!!! 
My husband will never want to order it out again!

This is a great recipe! I have made this three times now. The first two times were exactly as written, and it was a hit. The third time, I subbed whole milk instead of the half and half (following the suggestion of another reviewer), and stirred in an extra shake of cayenne at the end, to finish it. Again, it was a hit. 

I'm not sure why some people are saying that there is too much liquid, or that it's way too spicy. For us, the quantity of liquid in the original recipe has worked out just fine each time, resulting in thick, creamy grits, topped with a nicely-sauced shrimp/meat/veg. I use old-fashioned, stone-ground grits; maybe the ones who found it to be runny were using instant, or didn't cook it long enough? 

The spice level of the andouille and the pinch of cayenne in the original isn't much--I'd call it mild to medium overall, which is about our speed. The extra pinch of cayenne that I added at the end the third time I made this recipe  kicked it up to medium at most. 

Again, great, clear recipe--this is in my favorites file. Just follow the directions and it should turn out fine!

I made a few changes, but nothing drastic.  Instead of cayenne I used paprika and I did not use the flour mixture.  I just sauteed the onions and peppers and put them on top.  It was delicious.

I made the recipe exactly as published and will definitely make it again with one alteration to suit our family.  The andouille sausage is a bit too dominantly spicy for our clan so will only use 1 lb. & dice it next time.  The cheese grits are the best I've ever made.  Also used royal red shrimp for the 1st time and they were exceptionally more savory than typical shrimp.  A must for all future shrimp dishes.

I made this and followed the directions exactly except that I left out the cayenne because I was afraid that it would be too spicy for my guy.  It turned out great!  We both loved it and it was probably one of the best dinners I have ever made.  For a New York girl doing South Caroline style cooking for the first time (never made grits before!) it was a huge success!  Will definitely make this one again!

Yes, like the other reviewers, this was a great recipe! I followed the recipe except I used chicken andouille sausage instead of pork only because I already had that on hand. Next time I will use pork andouille sausage and maybe an extra bacon slice. The grits recipe was so creamy and delicious. I will actually use the grits recipe for a weekend breakfast. This is my go-to recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Best shrimp and grits I have ever had. Followed the recipe to a T. Well I might have swapped yellow pepper for an orange pepper a time or two. Sometimes I swap heavy cream for the half and half. Heavy cream stays good so long, I just keep some on hand most days.  As written is delish. Me changing to what I had on hand was still delish.

I've made this twice now and just thinking about it makes me salivate.  My son hates grits but had 2 heaping servings.  It makes a lot but the leftovers were as good if not better than the first day.  I didn't change a thing but it would be easy to tweak and still turn out incredible.  Better than I've had at any restaurant, how shrimp and grits should taste!

Would make the shrimp sauce again. Used some red/yellow  spicy/hot mixture of peppers from my garden with the green pepper instead of sweet red/yellow peppers for added heat. I liked the cheesy grits but he would have preferred plain hominy. May try with rice vs. Grits sometime too!

Three of the five couples of my Gourmet Club asked me for the recipe. Everyone raved. Not exactly a weight-watdher's recipe but -- oh well! 
Caution -- Grits should be slowly cooked in broth until they're almost done BEFORE adding half 'n half.

Amazing recipe. It is a constant request. I love the way the grits is cooked, and the full flavor of the entire dish. It is slightly time-consuming, but well worth the time. There are some ways to reorganize the time so it flows better.

Overall an excellent recipe.  I made just a few changes. Following the New Orleans school of cooking, "first you make a roux," although this recipe didn't call it a roux, which to me is a faux pas. I slow-cooked  my stone-ground  grits in a crockpot, which I believe the best method. I sauteed the garlic, onions, peppers (using just green from my garden), and celery, then added them to the roux. I prepared the bacon in the oven using a nonstick jelly roll pan, my standard way of making bacon. I browned the andouille (Richards, from NOLA) in a pan. Drained both the bacon and andouille on paper towels. I then put the shells from the shrimp in a pot with water and made a "shrimp broth," which was added to the roux, veggies, meats mix. Right before serving, I added the Gulf shrimp (also from Louisiana) to the big pot and the cheese to the grits. When serving, I sprinkled the top of the dish with freeze-dried chives (in the absence of fresh green onion tops) and served local corn on the cob. Really some great eating if you don't mind taking the time to do it up right. I will definitely make it again.

I was on the hunt for Shrimp and Grits that would take me to South Carolina, and boy was the recipe it! It was like eating a a southern B&B. It was so flavorful with a delicious sauce and creamy grits. It tasted like the sauce had cooked for hours. This is now my go to for Shrimp and Grits.

Delicious! This recipe was far better than most shrimp and grits I've enjoyed at restaurants. Made this as the directions said but will omit bacon, bacon grease and cut back to 1/2 sausage lbs.  to save on some of the calories. Definitely will be making again.

This was awesome!  The only thing I changed was I eliminated the green pepper, I used shallots instead of onion and I used heavy cream instead of half and half. Also, instead of chicken broth I used white wine. Yummy! This was such a great shrimp and grit recipe.  I love to cook and I've tried lots of shrimp and grit recipes and this was one of my favorite.

This was Deeee-licious!!!!!  Everyone loved it!!  We made it just like the recipe, and it was great!!  The only difference I did was in the technique - on steps 7 and 8 - After making the butter/flour mixture, I added the broth and Worchestershire to it and mixed it up in the saucepan, BEFORE adding to the meat/veggies.  I think this helped get it mixed up a lot easier...

OMGOODNESS! Amazing flavors! A keeper! Just be ready for dishes galore and it does take an hour & 15 minutes. So definitely don't make this if you don't have the time to remain in the kitchen that long! But so well worth it :-)

Absolutely Fantastic!   The only change I made was I added a little pepper jack cheese to the grits to give them a little kick and lot more cayenne pepper.   I will definitely be making this again.

I used chicken broth instead of water and hot Italian chicken sausage instead of pork, and my family LOVE IT!!! I will definitely use this recipe over and over and over again!!!! Just know that the grits maybe very creamy until you add the cheese! YUMMMMM! Also I added more onion than listed on the recipe. O, one last tip. Don't cook the shrimp too long! It won't be tender if you do. I suggest you put the shrimp in last along with the rue.

I didn't use all the drippings from the bacon and I used chicken stock for the grits as well. Other than that I followed the recipe and WOW is this a favorful, comfort food knock out. Made this for some friends for a little dinner party and not a drop was left. Can not wait to make it again!

Authentic Low Country Flavor!!!

Last night we went out with my wife's family to a schmancy restaurant and my SIL ordered Shrimp & Grits and said her taste buds were dancing.  "If you loved me..." my wife said, so let the cooking begin.  This recipe is NOT overrated!!!  Well deserving of ALL 5 stars.  One thing I may have messed up - I used heavy cream instead of half&half and it was thinner than I like my grits.  I added a few more uncooked and that was that.  I used way more than a pinch of cayenne - really dusted those shrimp well - along with sea salt and juice from a fresh lemon and my wife, who doesn't like 'heat' said it was just right.  Follow the directions closely, adjust spice to your liking and this is a WINNER.   One of the top 10 dishes I've ever made from Allrecipes.com!

Only change was using almond flour to make it gluten free.   I had to add a little cream to get the consistency right.  A new favorite!

We had recently vacationed in Isle of Palms outside Charleston and shrimping season had just started.  We had some fabulous shrimp and grits meals and wanted to relive the moment.  Tried this exactly as written with fresh white shrimp 20/24 count from Buford and it was amazing!

Absolutely delicious! This makes a LOT of grits so next time I will double the shrimp and sausage portion. Worth every star!

Made this dish for the first time and loved it. We are not big fans of bacon so I doubled the sausage and left out the bacon. Used olive oil instead of bacon grease to sauté vegetables. Made the recipe quicker and easier and still tasted great.

Fantastic!  This will definitely become a regular for us when the children are not home.  It was quick and easy to make.  I substituted milk for the half-and-half because I didn't have any and hubs' comment was "These are the best grits!"  We loved the balance of flavors.  I realize I totally forgot to use the bacon and it didn't suffer at all; might add it next time.  

I used only two cooking pots and one bowl, so am not sure how people managed to dirty every pan in the kitchen with this.  Probably will use my wok next time to do the sausage/veggies/shrimp/etc. as my fry pan was a bit tight getting everything in and I'd halved the recipe.

Can hardly wait for the children to go away again, so we can make it again.  (They'd just eat the shrimp, not the sausage and peppers, so what's the point?)  Thanks so much for sharing.  Probably won't be eating this out ever again, since it's so easy to make at home.

I'm so excited about how this came out. My kids loved it. I live in CA and it was almost impossible to find andouille sausage so I used chorizo. It worked out just fine.

Very flavorful.  I would save the bacon for a garnish instead of putting it in with the rest to cook.  We served over rice instead of grits.

If you're in an area where you can get your hands on some Conecuh county sausage, it will make this recipe!  I used more shrimp than the recipe called for, but this is definitely a good one.

I'm giving this 5 stars just for being what it is. I first discovered shrimp and grits in Charleston. I will say, you have to like both of those components to be fair. This go 'round I was minus a few ingredients, only had red pepper and for bacon used prosciutto. No sausage in the  house but I added Cajun spices and the rest was golden!! There are so many variations of shrimp and grits you can hardly go wrong. Thanks for being there for me, little recipe!!

I used 12-16/LB shrimp so 4 per person worked fine.  After I shelled the shrimp, I boiled the shells in 2 cups of water for 30 - 45 minutes to cook the grits in.  This cuts calories and adds tons of flavor  Use the best stone ground grits you can find.  I like to heat fresh ground pepper in a sauce pan to release its oils, then add a tablespoon of butter, then add the dry grits and given them a quick toasting, then add the  shrimp broth. Add more water if cooking more grits, I halved the recipe for the two of use but did use all 5 slices of thick bacon.  The andouille can be cut thinner.  Add half & half as the grits begin to thicken.  I made the roux separately and would likely add the both to the roux before adding the the shrimp, bacon, andouille, vegetable mixture.  Enjoyed a nice Pinot Noir with dinner.  Simply fabulous.

This is honestly the best and easiest step by step shrimp and grits recipe. After you make it the first time, you can definitely adjust accordingly but following the recipe as is, is SOOO GOOD. I give it a 5 stars because this recipe is always perfect for when I have a craving. It never fails your taste buds.

Love this recipe, but my waist doesn't.  I used milk instead of half and half and cut it reduced it by a quarter cup. I added back a little near the end of cooking.  I chopped the bacon and cooked the sausage in the drippings before adding the veggies. I didn't add the  garlic until everything was just about  done.  Five slices of bacon make a lot of drippings so I removed some before adding the veggies.  Still, it's a dish I only have on my "cheat on the diet" days.

Amazing.  I can't eat onion so I omitted that and used a turkey sausage b/c that's what I had on hand.  I saved some calories too by cooking the grits I had according to the directions on the can, boiling w/ salt and water and then just adding cheese and a bit of butter.  Still wonderful and creamy, no heavy cream needed.  Make this, you won't be sorry.

My hubby and I were looking to try some authentic New Orleans classics and I thought shrimp and grits would be perfect.  Neither of us have ever tasted shrimp and grits and were a bit skeptical since I was just googling a recipe.  However, THIS WAS AWESOME!  I plan to make it for breakfast when we have a family reunion in September.  I think the family will love it!  Thanks.

Great recipe!  When I made the roux, I just added the flour to the meat and onion/pepper mixture. (I did take the shrimp out first). Then added the chicken stock. I added the cheese to the roux mixture to help thicken it. The Worcestershire sauce was kind of bitter, so I put in a pinch of sugar to balance it. I put the grits in a bowl, added the cooked shrimp and poured the meat/sauce mixture on top. Amazing!  Being a southern girl, I have made (and eaten) my fair share of shrimp and grits. This recipe us a keeper!

We have a Shrimp and Grits Festival on an island near my home every year.  This recipe should be included in the competition.  This is hands down the best I've ever made.  The grits, usually bland for me, were creamy and flavorful BEFORE adding the cheese.  We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!

First of all this recipe has to many unecessary steps and way to many bell peppers. The directions on how to cook grits is incorrect and 1 cup of grits is not near enough for the amount of sauce made. I have never had shrimp and grits, but this recipe turned out good my family loved it. I will make again

I have made this recipe several times and always share what I make with friends. They tell me I have ruined them because it tastes so good they can't order it out at a restauraunt .  I add extra spices to the shrimp to take it up a notch.

This was great. Didn't have the sausage but it wasn't missed. Added half a leftover tomato which added a little color with the yellow pepper. I could have eaten it all, by myself!

Amazing recipe!  Left out the green pepper, I'm not a big fan of how it can overwhelm a dish.  The only other change I made was to add an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth to thin out the sauce just a bit.  Will definitely be making the again.  My dinner guest (a true southerner) said it was the best Shrimp and Grits she has ever had.  The best compliment...she asked to go home with the leftovers!

Made this today according the recipe (except bacon) and it was great! My husband loved it and definitely called it a keeper! I used fat free half and half for the grits, but for even healthier, you could make the grits with just water.

So, so good.   Restaurant quality, best I've ever had.     It is labor intensive, which is not a huge deal, but be aware.  I prepped everything the night before as this was breakfast the next day. 

Also, I'm not convinced half and half  is needed for the grits.  I only used a little bit (1/4 cup) and they were perfect.  Please note I used quick grits as they were all I had.  

I chopped the sausage into smaller bites, which I think helped with the overall consistency, but that was my personal preference.

I use this recipe all the time when I make shrimp n grits. I do add more broth so I can have more juices over the grits. Love this recipe. I am making it again tonight.

My husband and eldest son (12) loved this. I really liked the idea of it, but the grits were too creamy. Is that even possible?  I think next time I'm going to do 1/2 water and 1/2 cream (as a ratio) instead of the 1:2 ratio the recipe currently calls for. The flavor of the shrimp, sausage, and veggies was terrific (and I'm normally not an andouille fan). Nice recipe!

This was everyyyythinggg. I've had other shrimp and grits but by far this is the best. My husband gave me thumbs up and asked did I put my a$$ in it, it was so good. I did make two changes I used turkey sausage instead and added mushrooms. These recipe is definitely a KEEPER! I am always on this site but these is my first time rating a recipe on here it was so good.

I am a foodie. I have had shrimp and grits in several soul food restaurants in NYC . As a result, my expectations were very high going in and I was a little skeptical about this recipe. Well.. I was not disappointed!! The only things I did differently was adding a few additional dashes of Cayenne to the shrimp while it cooked to jazz it up a bit. The butter to flour ratio didn't match so I omitted the remaining flour. I would also use whole milk and water for the grits as they were too rich with heavy cream. Great over grits or over rice. Cant wait to  make again!

I forgot to get the peppers at Wegmans but it was fantastic anyway.  My husband thinks it's one of our top 5 recipes we've tried on the site. Good recipe to mix things up around here. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful, tasty, and as good if not better than shrimp and grits I've had at any restaurant.  I did make 2 changes just to accommodate what I had on hand. I replaced the andouille sausage with chorizo  and omitted the bacon and instead cooked the vegetables in 2T butter.  It was great the way I made it, but next time I will make it as written. 
I made this for Valentine's Day, and I think this just might become our valentine's tradition.

This is one of the best shrimp and grits recipes I've ever tried.  I highly recommend using Logan Turnpike Mill grits - they are the best and available on line from Logan Turnpike Mill in Blairsville, Georgia.  The spice and smokiness of the Andouille really adds to the flavor profile.  And, the recipe is just as good served as leftovers the next day (that is if you have any!!).

My most requested meal by family and friends! The first time I made it exactly as the recipe states. I now add one more andouille sausage link (about 6-8 ounces).  What can I say... I love the andouille.  Full of flavor and very filling.

I couldn't find coarse ground grits, I had to use quaker quick grits (recipe adjusted accordingly).    I used triple cheddar cheese because that's what I had.  This recipe was absolutely fabulous!    My boyfriend was wowed.    We loved it.

I made this dish exactly as stated in the recipe.  It was delicious!  It might even be better than shrimp and grits I had in Charleston!  I will say this recipe is very time consuming to make, but it's well worth it.

This is my go to recipe for shrimp and grits. I have been making this recipe for a while now and all of my friends and family rave about it. I'm actually going up to my husbands job tomorrow to cook this for the workers as they have all been asking  when they are going to get it again.

Great recipe that I made exactly as written the first time, with the exception of the grits, we love polenta instead! I've played around with it since then and now I add add diced tomatoes and a bit more heat with red pepper flakes. So very good! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I found this recipe a few years ago and decided to make it. It was a huge hit with my family so I have made it about six times since. I am from the north and live in the south and when I make this recipe following almost exactly (I only use red and/or yellow peppers) it tastes very authentic!

Great recipe. It did take a lot of prep work but well worth it. One thing I should have done was remove the casing from the sausage.

This was delicious. The grits turned out perfectly creamy and smooth, so I decided not to add cheese. They were so yummy and I definitely did not miss the cheese. The shrimp mixture was awesome. I also added some white wine to water it down since mine was a bit thick as others have said. But some of that could be because my husband does not like peppers, so I had to omit them and all the water they bring.  Just have some handy to thin it down! Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

We made this for Christmas dinner (we always go non-traditional), and it was universally loved.  In fact, my brother-in-law talked about a place they always visit in Murrels Inlet for Shrimp and grits, but this was better.  We made a 10 serving size for 6 adults and 2 kids, and almost every drop was eaten.

Made this last month for a Christmas Eve trial.  We make the traditional Italian 7 Fishes and what a huge success! Everyone raved about it. Definitely added to our annual tradition!

I will absolutely  make this recipe again. Instead of the peppers I used green onions and a yellow onion. I also sprinkled a hair of gumbo file' on the shrimp! I sprinkled shredded cheese, bacon and green onion on top of the grits and spreaded the shrimp and sausage mixture in a circle around the grits.

This was fantastic! My substitutes: chicken broth in the grits rather than water. I only had quick grits, so it took 1 1/2 cups of grits for that much liquid. I couldn't find andoullie (i was too lazy to  go to too many places). I used longanzia - some type of chorizo.  Worked great.  Doubled bacon because - well, it's bacon! So so tummy! Everyone loved it.  So pleased!

This was wonderful I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning instead of salt & cayenne. We love that seasoning and it gave it just the warmth I was looking for. Takes a little time but definitely worth it. The grits were a wonderful addition and a perfect partner with the creamy sauce. Thanks for the recipe!!

Really good. Only complaint is that it feels like you need to dirty every pot in the kitchen. I adapted it a little to save on washing up.

I went to the Shrimp and Grits festival in Charleston SC and tasted over 15 varieties of this dish. This recipe is wonderful! It is very authentic.  I served it the next day with grit cakes and it was great. I just added more chicken broth to thin out the gravy.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner and was a huge hit with everyone. Best I have ever made. I did make a shrimp stock out of shrimp shells and substituted it for the chicken stock. Also added a hot pepper to the pepper and onions. No other changes.

I love shrimp and grits and decided that instead of spending $15 on it at a restaurant I would try to make it. It was great. The recipe was wonderful and tasted just like the shrimp and grits I get at a restaurant. I was amazed at how wonderful this recipe was.

I've been searching for the "best" shrimp and grits recipe, my search stopped here. I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredible, the only change I would make is to add a little more of the cayenne pepper, other than that, I would change nothing. This is my new favorite recipe.

Excellent dish. It's easy and delicious. I did not have smoked sausage so I used kielbasa . And it came out just as tasty .  I also substituted Parmesan for the cheddar cheese as that's what I had on hand . This is is a go-to meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

This is a wonderful dish. Definitely a lot more time consuming than I anticipated but I now have an appreciation for restaurants that make this dish. After cooking the sausage, the pieces were too big so I cut them into smaller pieces. I would also add more chicken broth because the sauce didn't seem to be enough. As others suggested, I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the grits along with the half and half. Grits were amazing and creamy. Better than many restaurants I've been to

I did make some tweaks: 
--Used chicken broth instead of water for grits.
--Added lots of extra dashes of Creole seasoning to the shrimp/peppers/sausage mixture.
--Doubled the cheese in the grits. 

10/10 will definitely do again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't eat pork, so I used beef sausage and turkey bacon. I also had some smoked chicken leftover from earlier in the week that I threw in at the end, which gave added flavor and depth to the dish! Though I had added chix broth, my roux was thicker than I wanted it, so I added about 1/2 cup of chardonnay (I let it come back to a light boil before I added shrimp to prevent overcooking them). Sauce was perfect. I just did quick grits and added extra sharp cheddar. Very easy and tasty.

I stuck to the recipe for the most part. The only thing I did different was to add some cajun seasoning to the Shrimp and veggie mix. 
 I am not a very good cook to say the least but I pulled this off and it was great!

Thanks

I followed this recipe exactly and it was fantastic!!!  It was so good that my guests asked if we could have the leftovers for breakfast....So the next morning I topped Texas toast, with an egg over easy, shrimp and grits.  Everyone agreed it made an amazing breakfast too!  I've already had several requests to make this again.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I didn't eat it,  but I made it for my husband.  All he kept saying was "Oh my God" over and over.   He said it needed more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. I followed the recipe 100%.
Thank you for this!

Outstanding!  I made this dish last night and both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we tasted it.  My 2.5 year old gobbled it up as well.  This one will definitely be made again.  Thanks for sharing!

It was the best shrimp and grits ever !! 
  I used seafood stock in place of water in grits and also in place of chicken stock in the shrimp.  I also sautéed some  Finely chopped yellow peppers and onions in clarified butter  to develop some flavor in the grits pan.

The pound of andouille overwhelmed the 2 pounds of shrimp.  The grits turned out really good, maybe the best I've ever made.

Made this tonight.  I thought it was good.  But my husband and kids LOVED it!  There were a lot of steps involved and it took longer than expected, but to have my family love it made it worthwhile.  I made it exactly as in the recipe except I didn't add the red or green peppers cause I hate them (I did add the orange pepper).  Everything else was exact.  Will be making this again.

It was my first time ever having shrimp and grits so not much to compare it to, but it was FABULOUS!  Being from Louisiana I already know how to cook so I added my own flare to it and spiced it up more. The only downside is the amount of prep/cooking time. It seemed like an eternity. Out of a scale of 1-10, my husband gave it an 11.

I think this is my new favorite recipe from this site!  It was delicious!  I only made one change to the recipe.  I now live in Montana and couldn't find coarse ground grits anywhere.  So instead, I used quick 5 minute grits.  Because of this I had to add another 1/2 c. of the quick grits to get it to the right consistency.  Delicious!

Another raving fan here, this recipe is amazing. It was my first time ever making grits and I am so glad i tried something new! My husband loved it too. I used vegetarian sausage and no bacon,(I'm pescatarian) and it didn't miss any flavor without that stuff. Great way to introduce grits to the family.

This was one of the dishes at my Easter brunch, truly enjoyed by all!  I did tweak slightly, added a bay leaf at the veggie saute step, made a quick seafood stock using the shrimp shells and water instead of the chicken broth, and added some cubed ham because it was Easter.  Yes the roux does make it very thick, I just added more stock to loosen it back up.  Next time I'll just make half the roux or just not use it all.  Added this to my recipe box - excellent dish!

Have never attempted a shrimp and grits recipe until now, but always figured I'd never find a recipe as good as what you'd eat in a restaurant. As I searched for recipes I would pass on many because the list of ingredients didn't seem quite the taste I was going for.  But WOWWW, this one nailed it! It was wonderful and a definite worthy of guests meal!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  It will be one of my new favorites!

I use allrecipes for dinner at least a couple of times a week for the last 10 years. This is BY FAR my favorite recipe from the site, and probably my new "favorite dinner". The grits were AMAZING, and so was the rest of the dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The entire house LOVED it, even my 6 year old. Thank you submitter for this recipe!!

Never had shrimp and grits before, so can't compare. This was a strange marriage of jambalaya and creamy polenta. I didn't think they belonged together, but separate they are delicious. Won't make again.

Well worth the effort! I used instant grits, followed the directions on the back of the box, and omitted the half and half as not to alter the consistency. Perfect with the cheddar cheese!

Excellent recipe, i made this dish the other night and it was great. When you mix your seasonings go for it. My family loved it, we also tried this dish over Jasmine Rice instead of grits.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it. I had to take a few shortcuts that I don't think made to much difference, such as I used Cajun seasoning for shrimp rather than salt and cayenne. I had no bacon so I sautéed  everything in Olive Oil and a little butter(tossed in real bacon bits)which still added smoky bacon flavor. I cooked instant grits at the last minute and stirred in Vermont white sharp cheddar and it was fantastic.

I'd say that if anyone gave this less than 4 stars they probably should give up cooking and take up basket weaving.  I followed it to the letter.

Amazing .. i also added a bit of tumeric to the shrimp while it was marinating  just because its a healthy spice for you ... and i added some pepper  .. and also with the peppers i also threw in some chopped fresh parsley when it was almost close to done  only used a big green pepper and one smaller red pepper .. i cut this recipe down since its only me and it was still a lot  . its OK im looking forward to leftovers  :)  this was an AMAZING dinner !!!  been dying to cook it for a while and glad i tried it !!  will DEFINITELY make it again !!!

I never had this dish until I moved to the south. Now back home i miss the southern comfort. i have done grits before but never added the HALF/HALF. I didn't use the water but chicken broth instead. The half/half gives it a creamier taste loved it and learned something new. I gave it a 4 because i like the way I do my sausage n shrimp I used turkey smoked sausages instead of pork and i used a spoon of sriracha to give it a kick but i do love the grits.. Thank you

This is as good as my husband's favorite version at the restaurant.  I don't care for grits so i ate mine over rice and it was VERY good. My husband and daughter just raved over this. Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe was absolutely INCREDIBLE. Better than anything I could get in a restaurant. I will be making this time and time again. The ONLY thing I changed is that I just used Milk instead of Half&Half in the grits. It was perfect.

I love shrimp and grits that are done right, and these are definitely done right! This was my first time cooking them myself, and I found the recipe to be concise and easy to follow! I am sad to say that I couldn't find coarsely ground grits in Little Rock. ??  However, I used  store bought quick grits and still cooked according to directions, minus 5 min on the grit cooking time. It was fantastic and I am already ready for leftovers!

Absolutely loved it. My daughter LOVES shrimp, so I made this for her birthday (12yrs old) dinner tonight.  I've never had shrimp and grits before and this was my time making it.  This will definitely make it into our dinner rotation!  Yummm!

OMG this was some good eating! This was my 1st time preparing or experiencing shrimp & grits so I had no idea what to expect. Followed all steps of this recipe as written (except I used 5 min quick grits) and it came out perfect! My finicky boyfriend gave this 2 thumbs up, he even called the next morning asking if I had leftovers! He was too late! I polished off the rest with white rice for breakfast! Thanks for sharing!

Yup, really good.  I'm using much less/no bacon next time though.  Bacon makes it delicious but the grease hurt a little afterward (I'm 28)  :-/ I see other reviewers skipped it- probably for the better.  Still going on the list of dinner regulars.

Fabulous! So flavorful! We replaced the half and half with chicken broth, added mushrooms, and sprinkled chopped green onions on the top. Will be a family holiday tradition henceforth!!

Killer!!!!  Best ever tasted. Husband is allergic to shellfish, so sub'd roast chicken for shrimp.  Increased lemon juice (additional fresh squeeze over chicken). Son, who has complimented me three times in his life (he's 20) on my cooking, raved about this.  LOVE IT.

This receipe is amazing with a few tweaks. If you  add 2 teaspoons of salt to the grits it will be too salty. I added 1/2 tsp kosher salt and it was perfect. I also only add 1 cup of half and half and the consistency was perfect. I did cook the grits in 1 cup of water and 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth and boy oh boy was it great. The best grits I have ever tasted. Enjoy!

Absolutely love this recipe I will make over and over again! Very filling and well worth it. Have plenty of leftovers, I didn't add the bacon into the sauce I served as a garnish and it was still crunchy, didn't want the added sauce to make it soggy.

This is an excellent dish my whole family loves. We used the medium sized shrimp (still 2lbs). We keep the grits separate from the sausage/shrimp mix until ready to serve. Also excellent reheated as leftovers. I prefer a saucy stock, so I increase the chicken broth to 4 cups.

Awesome ! We adjusted the recipe for 4 and now wish we had made 8 ! We could not find andouille sausage here in Florida and substituted it with Portuguese chourico sausage which from researching should come close in taste and we used frozen in the shell raw shrimp thawed and removed the shell prior to cooking the texture was great when it was cooked. Next time just a dash more cayenne pepper. This was an amazing dish we sat there looking at each other almost in disbelief that we had created this meal. Adding the half and half to the gits made them so creamy and with the cheese oh so good.

Very good.  It took a while to make, but it was well worth it.  While making this I realized that I was out of grits, so I had to use rice.  Still good with it.

Amazing recipe. I did not have the sausage and it was still incredible. I have made the grits with regular milk and still great.  Once I added leftover chicken to it as well.  The secret is the roux. Get it nice and toasty brown.

This was fantastic - served it to guests last night and they said it was just about the best thing I had ever cooked.  Minor change - I just put the sausage in with the peppers without browning it since it was precooked, and I seared the shrimp separately so they would be crisp.  I didn't bother with the sauce because I cooked the peppers really well and there didn't seem a need for more sauce.  Great recipe - better than any shrimp and grits I've had at a restaurant.

This recipe brought back dear memories and surpassed them!  One of the most flavorful things I have ever made... or eaten period.  The heavy cream in the grits made it so much richer, and the flour really soaks up the flavor in the shrimp mix.  great left over as well!

Absolutely loved this.   We made a slight mistake by making the grits according to the instructions on the box (instead of the recipe)so missed the half and half.  Also added a little fresh basil to the veggies as they were simmering.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly...  huge hit with my family.

This was so delicious.  I passed on the bacon but added smoked sausage.  I also made shrimp stock from the shrimp peels and used that instead of water and chicken broth.  I also did not have that many peppers so I used half green and half red, still extremely delicious.  I just wish I could eat it more than once a year!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a great recipe, I did not have any sausage so left it out and I also used 2% milk and smoked Gouda cheese.  I used chicken broth instead of water to make the grits.  I watched several shows that stated the longer you cook the roux, the better so I cooked mine for about 20 minutes - it was a very rich dark brown.  I sprinkled the shrimp with cajun seasoning and cooked them separate so they would not over cook.  Next time I will try it with turkey smoked sausage, this is a dish that you can adjust the seasonings as needed.  I best this will be great with chopped tomatoes also!!!

Did not have to tweak this recipe at all, turned out FABULOUS! Will make this again!! Used another recipe as my shrimp n grits standby, it always seemed to turn out wrong. This one was spot on on the first try. I subbed in smoked Gouda instead of cheddar, but both are awesome. Would give this 6 stars if it was possible!!

Tried it tonight, but cut the recipe in half because there is just 2 of us. It was probably the best shrimp and grits I have ever had. Made as written except I left out the cheese. The grits were rich enough without it. I will definitely make this again.

Wow... Really delicious dish. I used spicy Italian sausage instead and that gave it a nice kick. I also diced (1/3"x1/3") the bell peppers and onions and I really liked the way it came out. I thought the dish had nice color with the red, green, and yellow bell peppers. Will make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly, and honestly could't improve on it if I had to be shot!  Delicious!  Mixed the leftovers and will bake in the morning with fresh cheese on top for brunch!

Liked the pepper, sausage, onion shrimp mix....very flavorful but not too much heat for the kids. I subbed polenta for the grits because that's what I had. Kids & hubs did not care for the polenta, so next time I make this I would sub rice if I didn't have grits. Nice change of pace....I just like more texture to chew, so rice would work better for me. Definitely worth a try!

This is the most delicious recipe for shrimp and grits I've ever tasted!  I am a southerner by birth and wanted to introduce shrimp and grits to my Boston friends so I made this dish for them and there was not a speck of it left on their plates.  None of them had eaten grits before and I saw the hesitancy in their eyes before tasting it but to my delight they were completely transformed.  I just hope they don't expect every shrimp and grits recipe to be as good as this one.  Many thanks to the creator of this gem of a dish!  It is now in my "favorites" category in my recipe book.

I was missing a few ingredients including bacon, but this was still delicious.  I have tried many similar recipes, and this one is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was soooooo delicious! In fact, I made it less than a week ago and I am going to try it again this morning for a friend. The first time that I made it I ended up with leftovers and each time that I warmed it up, it was better than the first! I didn't stick exactly to the ingredients. I didn't use the andouille sausage because my store didn't have any and I used the Velveeta soft block cheese instead of the shredded cheese. The grits were perfectly cheesy and creamy. YUMMM!

I've had shrimp and grits in many of different ways. In Charleston many years ago I had a fantastic shrimp and grits dish. Last night I made this one and it was as good if not better than the one I had in Charleston. My wife and I loved it and will save this recipe and make it again and again. It was great. Nothing more I can say about it. You must try this one if you have every you loved shrimp and grits. Have to use the coarsely ground grits, it's a must.

I think this recipe is great! The only thing I changed was the half and half. I substituted fat free half and half. I also used chicken andouille sausage. The leftovers were even better! I had never eaten grits before and I really liked them with this dish!

This is the best thing ever. I made the recipes as is except used chorizo instead of andouille and no yellow pepper.  Awesome, everyone loved it! This is a keeper and not too cumbersome to prepare.

This recipe is amazingly good and fine restaurant quality. However, it was a bit difficult to make and quite time-consuming. The challenge was to keep the grits smooth while completing the remaining steps.

I was pretty tired when finished, but the result was definitely worth the effort. It will be a special occasion recipe for us.

This recipe was excellent!  Everyone loved it and it made great leftovers (we are empty nesters).  The only change I will make is substituting little smokies for the spicy andoulli sausage.

Omg this was so good.  Never had grits before till I went to Hilton Head,SC and it was so good.  Came across this recipe and it reminded me of it.  Decided to try it myself.  It was awesome.  Made a few changes, did turkey sausage and left out the bacon since I don't eat pork.  It still was really good.  My son even ate it and he's 5.

I was looking for a recipe with ingredients I already have and found this one-sooo good I served it in a bowl on a bed of spinach. My husband is really picky but loved this!  The cayenne kick complimented the cheesy grits.  I Will be making this again.

This was amazing.  My husband raved about it.  I used 1/4 link of jalapeño sausage instead of andouille.  I used 5 minute grits(I couldn't find course ground in small town grocery). I had to add an additional half cups of grits to make thicker.  I omitted the garlic, sorry can't eat much.  I topped the dish with chopped green onion.  Absolutely delicious.  Great comfort food.

The recipe was absolutely delicious.  I made half the recipe and adjusted ingredients accordingly.  I used some orange, yellow and red pepper.  My husband and I don't like green.  I bought chicken andouille sausage which helped to cut the calories a little.  We didn't taste the difference.  
I didn't pay attention to the recipe and accidentally added the chicken broth to the flour/butter mixture and made a roux.  It worked beautifully because I didn't have to worry about the flour/butter burning.  Don't know if I would do it the recipe way because this worked out so well.  I don't think my changes were considerable; it really was a wonderful recipe.

I love shrimp and grits so was enthusiastic about trying this recipe. It is a bit time consuming to prepare, and a lot of cookware is used, but the results were great. My husband does not like grits, and he reminded me of that when I told him what we were having, but he loved it. I think the addition of the bacon and sausage cinched the "taste test". The only thing I did different was to put the grits and cheese mixture into a casserole dish, pour the shrimp mixture over it, and sprinkle with a little cheese before setting in a 225 degree oven to keep it warm while I cleaned up the mess I had made in the kitchen

I haven't tried this but except for the grits it sounds wonderful! I will replace grits with rice.
