This is a nice, simple recipe for chicken.  It takes very little time and was quick and easy to make.  However, the directions were not very clear so I only gave it three stars.  
I sprinkled the thyme over the chicken with a little pepper before I started.  I then browned the chicken in the butter.  I deglazed the pan with low sodium chicken broth and simmered for 30 minutes.  The 30 minutes was really too long and my chicken was a little over done.  I removed the chicken and boiled the sauce down.  This took about five minutes and made a lot of sauce.  Don't take the easy way out with a thickener like corn starch though, when boiled down the sauce gives you a slightly salty mixture with a strong thyme flavor.  Because the mix is already a little salty I really recommend lost sodium broth.  My 13 month old loved it and I will make again for sure.  Next time I may try adding a little lemon juice to the mixture while simmering.

I was in a hurry for something quick and easy, and found this recipe.  I didn't take the time to cook the chicken thoroughly during the browning phase, just browned quickly on each side then added the chicken broth and simmered about 20-30 minutes.  I found it to be quite tasty! The broth thickens and tastes very good over the chicken.  I will make this one again, thanks Rachel!

I really liked this recipe, just make sure to sear the chicken before you let it simmer in the sauce.  This will keep the juices in it while it simmers, and leave a more juicy chicken!

I gave this 5 stars because it was a great starter.  I added onion when I browned the chicken.  I also added some wine to the broth and a pinch of rosemary with the thyme.  I simmered it with the lid on and therefore it didnt thicken.  I used flour and water to make a gravy for the egg noodles I served it with.  Next time I make it I will add mushrooms when I brown the chicken.  Great recipe, easy to suit to taste.

This was not horrible, but it was pretty boring. The sauce did not ever thicken for me, and it basically just tasted like chicken broth.

I added a red onion, a splash of sherry, ad a handful of frozen peas- and this was a very nice dish. I give it three stars- but it would be five with the changes that i've made.

This chicken was very good, especially the sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with pepper and rosemary, in addition to the thyme.  I also added about a tablespoon of sherry when I added the broth.  The sauce does take a while to reduce, so don't worry about cooking the chicken the whole way through during the initial browning step.

This dish is very tasty and quick and easy to make. I was did have any thyme on hand so I used rosemary and served over egg noodles.

This recipe was okay, but not the best. The chicken was very juicy, but we were expecting more flavor. Thanks anyway!

This was not a bad dish.  Make sure to use low or no sodium broth beacause of the reduction.  I did find the dish to be a bit on the bland side.  I think maybe next time I might add some cream and even some dijon mustad to the sauce for a bit more flavour.

I took navy_mommy's idea and added some lemon juice to the chicken, as well as serving it with a slice for appearance.  The lemon went very nicely with the thyme and with the sprinkling of rosemary I added. I served this with a side of rice, and my boyfriend loved it. :) I'll probably make this again.

For such a simple recipe, this was fairly tasty; thyme is always nice with chicken. I made it exactly as written, but I found the "sauce" to be way too much in quantity. Unless you let it simmer on medium-low for a loooong time, to reduce it a lot, it'll be much more than "just enough sauce", I think. But, for what it is, I'll give this a better-than-average rating for simplicity and taste.

Made this for company. It is very simple, just a few ingredients and it came out moist and full of flavor. My guests loved it and I was happy to be able to spend less time at the stove and more time with my guests. Thanks!

I thought the flavor of this was okay but the sauce never thickened. I simmered for over 40 minutes and it was still very watery. I will probably try this recipe again because I think it has potential but maybe next time I'll add a tbsp or so of flour to try and thicken it up.

My sauce never thickened.  The water just boiled out of it, and I was left with a very burnt pan.  I'm not sure what the trick is to that, but regardless, the chicken itself tasted excellent!  I added both rosemary and thyme to the breasts themselves before cooking, and I made my own broth (just 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes).

Not a bad recipe.  Due to simmering in the "gravy" the chicken is very moist and delicious.  However, the "gravy" didn't turn out too well.  It was waaaaay too salty and I ended up dumping it instead of serving it with the chicken.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and while others have suggested adding a bit of corn starch to thicken up the sauce, I enjoyed it more as a broth than I would of as a gravy.
The only reason why I gave this chicken 4 stars instead of 5 is because you couldn't really taste the thyme.

It won't thicken unless you add a roux or cornstarch slurry. I think the seasonings suggested are rather bland so I added rosemary and red wine to mine.

I hate to be negative, but I just didn't like this all that much! Although you only add a small amount of thyme, I thought it was too much - tasted too "seasoned". I won't be making this again but better luck to those that would like to try it. We all differ on taste anyway - this just wasn't to my liking.

I made this with a few adjustments to match my pantry - I used herbs de provence, additional rosemary, bay leaves, a sprinkle of lemon juice, salt and pepper, and chicken broth (from bouillon - 1 cup.  I also added onions while browning the chicken.  Steamed some broccoli as a side, with some white rice.  A great, quick, easy dinner.  Thanks!

Gave it 5 stars considering the easiness and ingredients. Taste is a above average.  Delicate flavor.   I was very limited w/ what I had in the house and w/ the search engine found this recipe.  Great to serve w/ a rice pilaf.   Probably would not try to impress guests w/ it.  Perfect for any meal at home w/ family members.  Cooked chicken in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter before adding additional ingredients.

I took the advice of many reviewers: I salted & peppered chicken before browning. Then added fresh mushrooms when browning chicken in butter. Added  flour to sauce to thicken, splash of lemon juice, & sprinkle of rosemary. Served over buttered egg noodles with string beans. Next time I will double sauce mixture - I like lots of saucce over my noodles! Thanks for the ideas!

I added salt and pepper while browning. Also added a small amount of flower/water mixture to thicken the sauce. Great over rice and I made mine with chicken thighs, which were very tender.

I used this just as a base to make really tender chicken and then I added my favorite seasonings to the chicken. Also, a great way to use the left over juice/broth I made stuffing out of it. After the chicken was done I removed it from the pan and added Stove Top Stuffing to the left over juice, put the lid back on and let it sit for about 5 minutes or less and fluff with a fork and it's done.

Loved it - added some black olives at end with a little rosemary and garlic powder and maybe a TBS of lemon juice.

This was quick and easy. I made some small changes. I browned the chicken with onions, salt, pepper,garlic powder, rosemary and thyme. I also added a tablespoon of flower before adding the liquids to thicken the sauce but not on the chicken. If you add it after the liquids till get clumpy. Then mixed 1/2 cup of white cooking wine, with a cup of chicken broth. I let it simmer until it thickened up. Served with shrimp and brown rice was Perfecto!

Really great recipe! I only added some onions, 1 cup of white wine and 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 2 cups. My husband loved and so did i!

Excellent "starter" recipe. If you have a piece of chicken and are wondering what to do with it, this is a good "go-to" recipe for making chicken and keeping it very simple. What I like about it is that I can get it started, then leave it alone for awhile. The ingredients are basic, and are easily modifiable to my taste of the day. The aspect of this recipe that I am most keen on reviewing is the juicy factor, and the sauce. I made the recipe as described, and found that the chicken was tender, and the left over sauce was enough to pour over the top to add an extra dimension of "juicy" and fanciness. Step 1 was vague, so I cooked the chicken on both sides until browned, but then immediately added the remainder of ingredients and let it cook the rest of the way through. The broth and butter reduce into a nice simple sauce. Flavored only with Thyme, I found it a smidgen too bland for my taste. Thyme is subtle and earthy tasting, which compliments the chicken flavor. Other herbs that would blend well are rosemary, garlic, onion, celery, black pepper, lemon. I have made this with the addition of mushrooms, served with a side of smashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts. For a thicker sauce, add cornstarch or flour.  I would definitely make this chicken again, especially as a means to cook chicken before it was used in or for something else.

Terrific dish that my kids loved. Added fresh mushrooms with the butter. Used 2/3 of called for broth. 1/2 of the broth had garlic flavor.

This is definitely going in my favorites, so easy, and so good!  I added an onion & some garlic when browning and subbed about 1/4 of the water (I used chicken bouillon instead of broth) with white wine.  I put a lot more thyme than 1/2 teaspoon, too.  It was delicious.

Simple with good flavor. I added onion at the beginning and it was a nice addition.
