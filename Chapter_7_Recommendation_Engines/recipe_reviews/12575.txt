I don't know what mincemeat pie is supposed to taste like - it isn't a dish that was made in my family.  But hubby requested that I try one, & I chose this recipe.  I used ready-made pie crust, and followed recipe using rum but also mixing in 1/2 cup each golden raisins & sweetened dried cranberries.  For the top pie crust, I used a Linzer cookie cutter to make 1 decorative cutout, brushed with milk, & baked.  After 30 minutes, we brushed the top crust with beaten egg & dusted with sanding sugar.  Pie was lovely & hubby loved it!  Obviously, a good recipe with winning results on my first try.  Thanks!

When my sister-in-law asked that I bring a mincemeat pie for Thanksgiving I thought..ewwww! I love to cook and bake, so I was determined not to just purchase pre-made pie filling. I saw this recipe, followed it exactly, added some dried cranberries. It was a hit, I'm sure this will be one of my new requests every year!

This is a good recipe for dressing up premade filling. Although I would leave out the sugar, it was too sweet in the end.

This recipe turned out great.  Make sure you do the egg wash on top of the crust.  It makes such a difference

This is my first mince pie. I used Nonesuch mincemeat (which isn't meatless!) and cut the sugar in half (and could have omitted it). I figured I'd use my deep dish pie pan so I used 4 small apples and the whole 27 ounce jar of mincemeat. After I'd let it chill overnight I discovered that even with the extra filling it was too little for the deeper pan. I used a regular pie pan and it was fine. I'm not sure how it would have worked with only 18 ounces of mince and 2 apples, though! I also added about 1/4 cup of flour, as the filling had a lot of liquid. It went over surprisingly well. A very tasty pie!

This was simple and delicious. The best mincemeat pie ever.  My family loved it.  The recipe made more than I needed for 1 pie so I used the leftovers and made a country tart and topped the mincemeat with sliced canned pear and that was delicious also.

The pie made Gram LTH's 83rd b-day!  She said it was just like the mincemeat pie she enjoyed in her childhood.  I couldn't bring myself to try it, so I can't speak from my experience, but all of those that ate it said it was great!  I followed the recipe to a *t*, as I had no clue what mincemeat pie was supposed to be like!  TY for making Gram LTH's bday!

A very good recipe, so much better than store bought. I suggest tasting the filling before adding the sugar because I felt it was just right without the extra sugar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Actually I don't like mincemeat pie but I made it for my sister and dad who love it.  I added a tsp of apple pie spice to it and it went over just great.  They said it tastes just like it should.  I guess it can depend on the brand of mincemeat you use.  I used Crosse & Blackwell.

I think mincemeat is something that you have to be in the mood for.  No one else here in my house ever eats mincemeat, so I had this pie all to myself!  It was a good winter pie.

Thank you, I was looking for the ingredients to the spanish Empanadas and this is them. But, I use pork roast with it. Thank you, again for refreshing my memory.
Thank you.

Just like I remember from my childhood! I added 1/3 cup of orange peel, brushed the crust with butter and sprinkled w/sugar. The pie was a little over-stuffed, so I might use slightly less filling next time -- eat the rest w/o crust! Thanks for this yummy, hard-to-find recipe!

I have a deep dish Emile Henry pie pan which makes a BIG pie. I used 2 packages of NoneSuch condensed mincemeat. Reconstituted it in 1/2 cup of brandy and 1 cup of water. Brought it to a boil and then added 2 tbsp lemon juice. Tasted it and decided Marbalet was right about the brown sugar. Added 1/4 cup Splenda's brown sugar blend. Tasted it again and ended up with the 1/2 cup she recommended. Brandy isn't as sweet as Rum! Set it aside to cool. Diced 3 green granny smith apples.  Tossed the apples in 3 tbsp flour mixed with 2 tbsp melted butter. Used 1 cup of fresh pecans instead of walnuts since I don't like the bitterness of walnuts (even though they are healthier for you). Pureed the pecans in my Nutrabullet. I meant to chop them but the gadget is so powerful it practically pureed them and that turned out to be a delicious mistake.  Mixed the apples and nuts together and put them in a Pillsbury prepared pie shell.  Then poured the mincemeat over it.  Topped with another Pillsbury pie crust and crimped the edges.  Poked a few holes in the top. Brushed 2 egg yolks mixed with 1 tbsp of water over the crust. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and lemon sauce (Juice from 2 lemons, 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 cup water whisked over medium heat for a few minutes). it was a big hit! OOhs and Ahhs from people who said they didn't like Mince Meat pie! Next time I'll refrigerate the mincemeat overnight & try Rum as suggested. The brandy was good though!

This recipe is a lot like the one my mother used.
I made it without the sugar or lemon juice. I used half walnuts and half pecans. It was a hit, but the competition at Christmas dinner was a pecan pie. But the mincemeat came in a strong second!

My mom asked for a mincemeat pie last year for Christmas. I used this recipe as is and she raved about it all year. Guess what she asked for again this year?!?
