This recipe was fast and couldn't have been any easier to make. I didn't have the Kraft dressing so I just subbed balsamic vinegar and added a little white sugar while cooking the onions just to cut the acidity. Overall, it was pretty good. Since it was so fast and easy, I'll definitely make it again.

This was pretty good. I added a head of garlic to the onion.

Very good and quick.  I grilled the chicken instead of cooking in a skillet and used black olives and chopped tomatoes.  My family loved it,

We will not be making this again.  The couscous was great, but we really did not like the flavor of the chicken.  The cheese seemed odd also.
