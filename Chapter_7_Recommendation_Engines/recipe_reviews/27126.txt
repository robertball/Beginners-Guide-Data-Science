I found this recipe to be absolutely fantastic! I even found myself sneaking a little of it out of the bowl before it was put onto the table! It makes an excellent summer desert, (well it's summer now in Australia, anyway).

When I made it I made a few alterations to the recipe. I used a can of coconut cream instead of the evaporated milk and essence (as my father had just gone and bought a large quantity of the stuff as it was greatly reduced -- so I had to figure out a way to use it!) I also used a little less sugar (just to suit my parents' tastes, but others might prefer it to be sweeter). But all in all, it is a great, beautifully tasting recipe.

This was gross. It did set properly, but tasted NOTHING like coconut pudding. Unless you like the taste of beaten egg whites, I won't recommend this recipe written as is. Try maybe with coconut milk or cream, maybe itll be better.

Taste like restaurant quality dim sum.  We used Carnation evaporated milk and was a little disappointed in the color.  I remember the restaurant pudding being really white, but the evaporated milk causes it to be more of an off white  color, which definitely hurts the presentation.  Taste great though.

Yum!  This recipe is quick & easy.  As suggested by Jillian88 I substituted coconut cream for the evaporated milk and coconut extract.  However, I'll use less sugar next time as I found 1 cup to be too sweet.

I used 5 oz. of cream of coconut & omitted all the sugar as it is plenty sweet on it's own. I also omitted the coconut extract as I am out & with the use of the cream of coconut, I don't feel it was needed anyway. Thsi held it's shape very well after unmolding w/out having too gelatinous a texture. It's texture was very similiar to an airy meringue....very enjoyable. I unmolded it onto an antique dessert plate & garnished w/ toasted coconut. Very nice asian dessert....thanks for the recipe!

ok, but I think if I make it again I will use whipped cream instead of egg whites.

I can definitely see how this would go over well with kids (offered some to a friend and she wouldn't touch it lol).  But I found it lumpy (maybe I'm not adding the egg whites properly), too sweet and I've seen someone else reviewing saying they substituted real coconut milk.  Maybe that would make it better.  And the evaporated milk does give it an off-white color.

Thanks for putting up this recipe.  Great dessert!  Too sweet though.  I'll use less sugar next time.

It has really good flavor but the consistency is a little strange. The kids liked it.

I made this today.  Firstly, it's not pudding; it's coconut flavored gelatin mixed with meringue.  The texture is weird (so is the color since evaporated milk is brownish): foamy egg whites and glops of gelatin folded together. Two textures that really don't marry we'll.  The only thing that makes it coconut flavored is the extract.  Once chilled it is a little bit refreshing but not enough to make me want to make it again.  Thanks Yi-Fun Hsuesh for sharing...it just isn't for me.

Very good and refreshing but i thought it needed more flavor so i added some vanilla extract and almond extract. Sounds gross but tastes great!

This was a pretty good recipe. I tried it while doing a family movie night with a movie and themed food (The Joy Luck Club) and it was fabulous! My family thought it tasted sorta like coconut jello. That might be because I added 2 and a half unflavored gelatin packets so it was more like jello instead of pudding. But it tasted delicious! I garnished the top with coconut for looks!
