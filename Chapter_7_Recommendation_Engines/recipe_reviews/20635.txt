This is a great thought, however, the berry seeds plugged the straws. Next time I will strain the seeds from the puree. Also, maybe it was the berries I used, but this was a little on the tart side. I added 1t sugar to each drink so we wouldn't pucker up! Thanks Nutski.

For those who like carbonated water, this makes a lovely "mocktail." The recipe submitter told us to try using strawberries, so I did. I prefer a sweeter drink, so I added a packet of Splenda to each glass.

This was ok but it does need some added sweetener if your berries aren't super sweet.  I used the carbonated water from my soda stream. I would also strain the berries to remove the seeds.

I used 7-Up to add a little sweetness to the drink.  I tried using our strainer for the raspberry seeds, but mine is too fine and that didn't work.  The drink was still a little tart and the raspberry clumps together slightly giving it lots of pulp, which is not my favorite.  Maybe I'll try it with Sprite next time.  Or maybe if it is cooked for a bit and a little sugar added, that may break down the raspberries enough for a smoother, more refreshing drink.

Good recipe to make with kids. I made this with a five year old who helped pick the berries in the backyard. The drink is very refreshing, especially on a hot day.
