I'm from Hong Kong this is what we call tong shui(sweet water). This is a good recipe to follow. I used to do it all by taste a lot more work. I used sweet potato instead of taro(it's interchangeable but sweet potato has some natural sweetness). My advice is cook the tapioca by itself as the recipe says you don't want the starchy water. In a different pot cook the taro and sugar. Add sugar till it suits your taste(it's not suppose to be too sweet) then add the tapioca and coconut milk.

I like this easy and tasty recipe. The first time I made it we didn't eat it until 3 hours later the tapioca soaked up the liquid the dessert became very thick mixture. I adjust the procedure the second time I made it: I boiled the taro for 15 mins then added uncook tapioca in the same pot to cook for another 7 mins then added coconut milk cook until boil last step I added brown raw sugar for another 2 mins or so until sugar dissolve. I serve it 1 hour later this time tapiocas didn't have that much time to soak up all the liquid and the flavor is still there without all that simmering.

This is a very popular recipe in southeast asia.  You can also use sweet rice in place of the tapioca pearls.  I serve this to my six month old baby and she loveees it so much.  Coconut milk is high in saturated fat which is very good for you as oppose to the poly saturated fat.  So don't be afraid of this recipe because of the coco milk. I also sub. rock sugar for palm sugar.

It was average tasting. It wasn't what I was looking for. I had to strain the tapioca with running warm water to get rid of the starchy sticky gel. Then I added the milk/sugar mixture. Also I boiled the taro seperately and added that at the end. My daughter liked it with whipped cream stirred in.

Wow did not care for this! It's too liquidy and the potato didn't work well with the other textures. Never again.

I made this recipe but had to make a major modification. Like the other 1 star reviews said it is way too much water with the taro when you add in the coconut milk. I drained much of the water out of the taro. I saved about 1 cups worth of taro-water and then poured in the coconut milk. You need to dilute the coconut milk with something and other recipes dilute it with milk. The taro-water is a good substitute and will help thicken the soup once it cools. I wouldn't put more than a cup. Since there is so much moisture in the taro you could drain out all the water. There will be some residual water in the pot (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup) that you could use to dilute the coconut milk. If its too thick once you're done you can add back in some water or m ilk. The key is to cut the taro into larger pieces (maybe 1-inch pieces) not overboil the taro. Stick to 10 minutes before adding in the coconut milk since you will need to continue to boil it to incorporate the coconut milk. Once you make these changes it comes out very nicely. I didn't put in the small tapioca pearls but I would make sure to cook the pearls then cool them with lots of cold water. Add in the tapioca pearls once the soup cools so it doesn't further cook the pearls.

It wasn't sweet enough for me and too much liquid. It's not that I don't like Asian desserts because I LOVE red beans mung beans etc. in coconut milk for desert. I'm guessing it's the taro that doesn't work for me.

Great recipe! One small thing you should put a little evaporated milk at the time of serving (hot or cold) for added taste. I'm from Hong Kong and this is a great recipe for the taro tapioca sweet soup. Please don't confuse this with sweet potato sweet soup! That's a different recipe and a different soup!

This was perfect! I followed the recipe mostly, except the tapioca portion (I just nuked it in the microwave) and I subbed sweet potatoes for taro. But it tasted just like in the restaurants!!! Thank you!!!

This is excellent with some minor tweaks. The first time I made it the taro was still firm and there was far too much tapioca for me. The second time I made this I made half the amount of tapioca. I also boiled the taro for 5 minutes longer before adding the coconut milk. Perfect! Just like in the restaurants.

I used this base but found that it's easier to just put the small tapioca pearls in at the same time as the frozen cubed taro I have. They cook about the same time. My cubes are a little smaller than the recipe - maybe 1/3 in?

It was ok but not great. Gave my dad heartburn. I'm not good at cooking though so it could just be me.
