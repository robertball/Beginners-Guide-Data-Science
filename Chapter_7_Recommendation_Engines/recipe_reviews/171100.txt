I authored this recipe and just wanted to clarify a few things. This recipe is meant to be cooked on the stove so peanuts should be done in 4 hours or more. If you do decide to cook them in a crockpot then they will take typically 7 hours or more on high. If the peanuts are taking a very long time on the stove like one reviewer stated you possibly purchased peanuts not meant for boiling. Make sure you have not purchased roasted peanuts. Typically the correct peanuts at places like Walmart will have indications of boiling on the package.

When I've traveled in the south; I've often seen roadside stands with "Hot Boiled Peanuts" for sale. Sometimes whimsical signs of giant peanuts would advertise them. Every now and then, I like to make a batch of them to enjoy with an icy soft drink. This recipe has some good flavor ideas within. However, I felt quite a bit more salt was needed for the brine. And for our preferences; I will double the rest of the other ingredients next time because we like it spicy. The cook time was spot-on for raw peanuts. I will definitely make again with these changes. A very good base to start.

Delicious! I only had 1 lb. of peanuts, Crab Boil and reduced the salt to 1/4 c., so gave it a try. 12 hours in the crock pot on low and I'm in peanut heaven. How do you save these once they're done? It's going to take me a few days to eat all of this.

Takes a good 24 hours on a crock pot to make these really good.

So good! Just wanted to add what the creator of this recipe noted. You can't boil roasted peanuts. I'm a southern girl and grew up on these. You have to get RAW peanuts. I just cooked 5 lbs and it took 3 1/2 hours to get that's huge pot soft... I like my really squishy and slurpy. ^_^ thank you!

I'm from the South and grew up eating boiled peanuts. When I saw this recipe I was unsure about it......... After using this recipes I'll never make them any other way. Thanks for posting it.

I don't know about everyone else but be warned your house will smell like a seafood resturant if you cook them in your kitchen.  Delicous but a bit stinky.  Now days I just cook them in a crock pot on my porch.

Just like the peanuts my mom would buy under the little Jim bridge in Fort pierce when we would had up the boat. Iâ€™m now a a resident of Indiana and these bad boys will warm you up on those cold days. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. Had our first taste of boiled peanuts on a vacation to Florida (road trip). First put off because no one told me the peanuts would be soft. After that I'm hooked. Was glad to find this recipe once we were back home in the North. Made them several times. Great with beer for a ball game.
