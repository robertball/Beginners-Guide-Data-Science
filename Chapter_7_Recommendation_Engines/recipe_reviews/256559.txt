I eat gluten free and eat oatmeal regularly, so for me the recipe was great as written. I served them with a side of chunky applesauce to offset the natural dryness of the oatmeal. Iâ€™ll need to work on getting the right amount of batter on the griddle to make the waffles come out more square.

I added the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested, as well ground the oats first with a handful of pecans. I had trouble with the first one separating when I lifted the lid of the grill. The batter did seem a bit dry so I added just two or three tablespoons more of the almond milk I had used and the second waffle came out perfect. Will make them again.

Okay, so, I have to admit, I had a senior moment and didn't read the directions correctly. I whisked the entire egg in with the melted butter. Rather than waste the ingredients and start all over again, I went ahead and finished the recipe despite my mistake and made pancakes instead, and.... WOW! Awesome pancakes! Next time I'll make waffles and follow the recipe correctly...

I had my doubts as I assembled the ingredients, but this turned out to be delicious! Followed the reviews and added 1 tsp cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I'll try it in the Vitamix to get a smoother consistency (though the oats made it seem almost like a crumble topping!). I'll be quadrupling it too in hopes of some leftovers!

I'm rating this with 4 stars because, as written, they are a little flavor lacking.  The second time I made them I used "buttermilk" (made from 3/4 cup organic soy milk and 2 TBLS fresh squeezed lemon juice) and added 1 teaspoons cinnamon and vanilla.  Super easy to make and fabulously delicious!  This is our new Sunday morning waffle recipe

As written these were a bit bland so I added some cinnamon and vanilla to later waffles and they were perfect! A great gluten free waffle.

not a lot of flavor.  Strange texture but filling
