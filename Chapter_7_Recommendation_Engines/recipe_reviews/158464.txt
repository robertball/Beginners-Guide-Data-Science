This is easy and yum. I didn't use peanuts because I don't like them. The reason I gave only three stars is because they don't hold together beautifully. My guess is that it lacks condensed milk to hold... like other similar recipes call for.

They taste really good, but like the other review said, they don't stick together well.  I had to make another half batch of the sugar, butter, milk, cocoa powder mixture and add most of it to the orginal batch to make them stick well.

I didn't add the raisins or peanuts and the cookies stuck together really well.  Yummy!  Next time I'm going to add peanutbutter!
