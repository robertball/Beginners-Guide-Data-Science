This was very good. My husband and kids ate it right up! The only changes I made were upping the 1/3 hash brown potatoes to 2/3 cup (I found 1/3 cup wasn't enough for a good layer) and I used pork sausage as it was half the price of the chicken. I think I will lessen the cook time down to 40 minutes next time, as 50 minutes in my oven overcooked it a bit. Thank you for a great recipe! :)

I made this according to the recipe, and my husband and I really liked it.  I did use the chicken apple sausage, which added most of the flavor.  Since I had some hash brown patties to use up, that's what I put on the bottom and they turned out fine.

Love this.. instead of crescent rools, I mixed up some multigrain pancake mix and prebaked that, topped with the sauted chicken apple sausage, hash browns and onions, added a couple wedge of garlic and herb cheese and used egg white2..

This was just okay.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Should have started checking on it baking at around 30 mins. because by 45 mins. the crescent roll crust had become a dark toffee color, bordering on being completely burned.  Overall, I would have enjoyed the components better separately prepared as scrambled eggs with hash browns, sausage and rolls.

Overall this recipe was very good. I added salt and pepper, but it could use a bit more seasoning to enhance the flavor. Also, I sauteed onion and red bell pepper and added that to the egg mixture. As someone else mentioned, the rolls got a little too toasty and that's even after reducing the time to 35 minutes. It was also a bit too dry, so next time I will increase the milk. Overall though - great recipe!

Made this with precooked sausage and double O'Brien hash browns. Everyone loved it. Only complaint was some of the egg got underneath the crescent rolls and the spots that did, didn't brown or puff up. I will make this again. We eat breakfast every week for supper!

This was delicious and VERY filling. Presentation was impressive for being such an easy dish! (love that! Especially when friends stay over for breakfast!) Next time I will add more hash browns and not use the crescent rolls. The recipe was great as is but too filling for my breakfast preference.

I used this recipe as my base, but added a layer of English muffins (halved) on the bottom.  Then I added browned breakfast sausage, thawed package of hash browns, and cheese.  I used a dozen large eggs mixed with milk, salt and pepper and poured this mix over the dry goods.  Baked for 45 minutes at 350.

This recipe is dry. The temperature is too high. It was done in less than 30 minutes and still very dry. Try adding more eggs and mild. Perhaps some nice seasonings.

Always a crowd pleaser. I substitute turkey sausage crumbles for the chicken sausage. I add 1 tablespoon per serving of bacon bits. Depending on who I am serving it to, I will also add canned jalape√±os to taste by blending them with the eggs.
