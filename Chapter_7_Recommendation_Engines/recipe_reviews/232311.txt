I loved the zip that this dressing has! A traditional, creamy coleslaw with a kick. Unfortunately, I wasn't paying attention to the ounces on my coleslaw mix (only 16 oz) so it was a bit heavy on the dressing, but otherwise fantastic. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was perfect! Just like the old-fashioned coleslaw I grew up with. I didn't have horseradish on hand (alas!), but it was delicious anyway. I'm sure the horseradish would have made it even better. The ingredient portions were perfect, so that nothing overpowered the rest. Very creamy, and easy to make. This recipe is a keeper. I had two bowls for dinner, and I'm going to have another bowl for a snack tonight! By the way, be sure you get the jumbo 28 oz. size of coleslaw mix as called for in this recipe, rather than the standard 16 oz. size. (P.S. I like a hint of onion in my slaw, so I minced 2 Tbs. of onion and added that to the coleslaw mix.)

This coleslaw is delicious.  The horseradish gives it an extra oomph.  Not too runny but just creamy enough.

This was delicious! I didn't have quite enough horseradish so I added some French's horseradish mustard and just skipped the dry mustard. Like another reviewer, I like a bit of onion in my slaw so added some minced onion as well, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit at our "autumn picnic" at work! Next time I make it I will make sure to have enough horseradish on hand for even more zip! Do pay attention to how much slaw is in the package you use (since most aren't 28 oz.) or you will have way too much dressing. I always mix the dressing in one bowl and put the slaw in another and add til I get the consistency I want. Definitely my go to slaw now!

This was definitely a zippier coleslaw than we are used to, but, very tasty! We really liked the slight "heat" you get from the horseradish.  It was a tad too tart for our taste.  I will make again, but, add a little more sugar next time.

This recipe is a great, basic coleslaw recipe. I used apple cider vinegar because I like the flavor in coleslaw, and left out the horseradish because I knew there would be kids eating it.  I made a triple batch (but only doubled the dressing amounts) for 40 people to pile up on top of pulled pork sandwiches.  I was asked for the recipe by quite a few.  My new go-to!

Used this recipe for the dressing only...dropped the horseradish for personal preference and used cider vinegar instead of rice...de-lish! And, this is coming from someone who is not a fan of coleslaw.

Really great!  I have made several coleslaw recipes from this site, this is by far the best. I have made it exactly as it is written, and I have also made it as it is written +1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and one teaspoon of poppyseeds. It is great both ways, but I think I prefer it with the extra heat and seeds. Either way, you cannot go wrong! Let it sit for a couple of hours before you eat it.

I used about a quarter of a large head of cabbage and one good sized carrot instead of a mix, which seemed perfect for the amount of dressing. I don't care for sweet cole slaw, so reduced sugar to 2 Tablespoons. I think it's one of the best slaws I've ever had. The horseradish really makes this awesome.

This is a great recipe (made better after I tweaked it for personal preferences).  I halved everything  (just in case we didn't like it ;-) ), I had extra hot horseradish and cut that back just a bit for dh since he's not a fan of it, added 1/8 tsp  ground celery seed and 2 dashes of tabasco with everything else as written.  I also added some diced onion to the slaw mix. Next time I will cut back a wee bit on the sugar for our liking.  Served this on pulled pork sandwiches and had one serving left over that I finished off the next day with a steak.  I will definantly be using this for all my slaw! Thank you!

The truth is, I'm VERY picky about cole slaw. I rarely like the ones in the deli or supermarkets, but I love this recipe. It has the perfect balance for me - and my family. The dressing is divine and my kids noticed it right away, asking if I had made the dressing. It is worth the few minutes it takes to put it together.

I've made this several times and it's a favorite!  I add extra horseradish but that's the only change.  It really needs a least an hour or two in the frig for the flavors to mix fully

Excellent coleslaw topping.  I made this for our family dinner night and everyone really enjoyed.  I was a little hesitant about adding horseradish to the mixture but that is what made it so special.  Infact, when I make it again, I will add a little more than the 1T. The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the onion powder.  Just don't care for the flavor it adds to a recipe.  This is a keeper to use over and over again

Made this to go with bbq pulled pork sandwiches. Much like the other reviews, the horseradish gives it a nice kick. The taste was approved by my family, and 98 year old grand father. It is also very easy to make in large quantities, I made enough for 20 people.

I didn't change anything and am giving this a 5 because it's a great coleslaw and don't want to ruin the high rating - BUT -  I still love Taste of Home's Creamy Coleslaw (on this site) more.  In my opinion you can't beat the creaminess in that one but I do love trying new recipes.  I will have to make that next week to redeem myself since I did get comments that this was not as creamy as usual.

I make this coleslaw about every three weeks;  I especially like it with fish tacos.  I use half low fat mayo and half plain greek yogurt to decrease the fat content and add a little extra protein. I also halve the sugar and add  about an inch of wasabi paste to kick up the heat a little more. Delicious!

My husband loves coleslaw, but is something of a coleslaw snob. The mixture has to be just right. All I had to do to this recipe was add a bit more sugar and it was a winner.

Yummy! I just made this, and it is very good as it is, so it will probably only get better as it sits until dinner time. Luckily I read a few reviews before I tried it, or I might have made too much dressing, as my bag of coleslaw mix, like another reviewer's, was 16oz, not 28 as the original recipe specifies. I did the math, and cutting the ingredients by half was just shy of what I needed. Since I have found that sometimes coleslaw tends to "weep" and get a little soggy over time, what came out a smidge drier than I might have liked will probably be perfect in a few hours. I plan to make this dressing to keep on hand for regular green salads or maybe potato salads, too. It's that good. I've really been trying to cook with fewer bottle dressings and sauces, and I was able to make this with what I had on hand. Thanks for sharing! Update: I was correct in that you can start this salad with less dressing than you might think. When I went to put the leftovers away after our dinner portions, I poured probably a half a cup of watery liquid down the drain, and there was still a little of the liquid in the bottom of the container. Any more dressing, and it would have been positively soupy.

Delicious- subbed apple cider vinegar and cut the sugar down a bit for our taste and it was perfect for us.  I also only had a 16 oz bag instead of 28.  Halving the dressing didn't make enough dressing for my taste so I upped it all a bit to make more and it was yummy!  I like it with lots of creamy dressing, and the adjustments for tastes were easy to fiddle with and still great flavor.  Don't think you can miss even if the proportions are off!

I loved this recipe and so did my friends, now they want the recipe in fact. I added a heaping tbsp of horseradish to add a bit more of a zip and it was fine. I also used 4 cups of shredded slaw..the dressing can cover alot I found. Love it....

It was a very good start although I did not use as much sugar, did not add the salt and doubled the pepper.  More of a personal preference rather than a flaw in the recipe.

I also had a smaller bag of coleslaw mix, but added the full dressing to it.  It was great on our pulled pork sandwiches.  I didn’t have celery salt, but used celery seed to replace it and also didn’t add the horseradish because was out of that as well.

I didn't exactly make this "Traditional Creamy Coleslaw." What I did was read the recipe, and then go to the kitchen to whip up something with the same ingredients (except sugar). The result was fantastic!!! Loved it!!! Thank you J. D. Bailey for sharing your recipe.

Excellent. Only changes I made was I added chopped parsley, cut sugar in half, cut vegetable oil, used mayonnaise and added pepper.  Parsley added a nice touch.  I didn’t add onion.

I had half a head of cabbage that needed to be used so thought this was a great idea. I cut the dressing in half because I figured I had close to 12-16oz of finely chopped cabbage. Turned out fantastic! I had no celery salt so I did add celery seed, and bit of finely cut celery(with extra tops) and shredded carrots red onion for color. Also I didn't have rice wine vinegar so just used white wine vinegar. I love the thickness of this version vs. the soupy ones that a lot of places serve. Thank you for sharing!

Creamy and delicious coleslaw! I saw a reviewer mentioned it was too sweet. I did cut back a little on the sugar, and it was fine. I would even halve the amount of sugar. You really have to adjust the amounts of some ingredients to your own tastes. I wouldn't give the recipe a lower rating for that reason, either. Start by adding less and taste-test. Good recipe!

I eyeballed the ingredients and scaled down to 4 servings. The horseradish definitely adds something to the recipe. I have always used horseradish in  deviled eggs and potato salad but never thought to add it to cole slaw.   Thanks for the recipe.

I love this classic coleslaw recipe, it tastes just like how my grandma made it. I cut the recipe in half because I had a smaller coleslaw mix(14 oz). I also omitted the mustard and horseradish because I don't like it.

As a coleslaw lover, I was extremely pleased with this recipe - - so much so, that I made another batch the day after the first was eaten. I shred a small head of cabbage, omit the horseradish, use a few shakes of celery flakes, sub Lawry's instead of celery salt and use more rice wine vinegar than called for. I also shred a couple medium-sized carrots, as coleslaw isn't coleslaw without them, IMO. To me, it tastes pretty close to a certain famous chain's coleslaw, and that's a good thing! This will be my coleslaw recipe going forward.

My hubby is picky about his cole slaw and my cooking my I won 5 stars with this recipe! I omitted the horseradish, celery salt, and onion salt. I used white vinegar. I added about 1/8 cup of onion and used 1/2 head of cabbage, and thinly sliced 1 medium carrot. He absolutely loves it!

This was so good. I had never put horseradish in coleslaw before today.  I bought a spiralizer last week and have been using it almost every day. Made short work of making the cabbage into shreds. I used celery seed instead of celery salt, so added a little extra salt. I will make this again.

Yep, just like almost everyone, I made some substitutions.   Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, yellow mustard instead of Mustard powder and Celery Seed instead of salt and omitted kosher salt.  All I can say is WOW!  If I'd had the other ingredients onhand, except for the mayo, I would have made it just as the recipe reads.  What a tasty dressing.  Serving it with chicken made with our Big Green Egg.  Can't wait!

The dressing is very good, however i found it  only enough for  1 14 oz bag of coleslaw mix..would  have doubled dressing if more slaw to be made..Did chop add finely cut red onions..Very good recipe..luv eating and tasting it

A great change of pace from usual coleslaw.
Made as directed except I had to sub cider vinegar for 
the rice wine vinegar.  Made no difference.

Fantastic!   Made a couple changes no Dry Mustard so I used a squeeze of Dijon.  Instead of Rice Vinegar I used Apple Cider Vinegar and no horseradish.   When I followed everything else I only need 1 16 oz package of Slaw and it was perfect
Anyways....   Everyone loved this recipe!

Easy and excellent.  Didn't have horseradish and missed it in this, but I used a Dijon mustard that as a horseradish-like kick to it.  This slaw was even better the next day, after flavors had a chance to blend.

This was my first time making coleslaw and it was very good. I made it exactly as written,  except I couldn't find 28 oz bags of coleslaw so I used two 16 oz bags and there was plenty of dressing.  Will make it again! No more store bought!

I usually use "slaw magic" a seasoning package and we love it, but I was out so I tried this. We will not be using slaw magic anymore!!!  Not only did my family love it but it recieved rave reviews at my church carry-in!! We liked the zip of the horseradish , but only used 1/3 the amount for the carry in as there were many older people who can't do spicy and it worked perfect.

I substituted horseradish with cider vinegar as one of the reviewers suggested and it was very good.  Creamy and tangy and seasoned well.  I substituted 1/8 of the mayonnaise with Greek plain yogurt and still was very creamy  yet ever so slightly less fattening.

I made this coleslaw dressing last week and it was awesome!!! The only thing I omitted was (I'm having a hard time saying it)...horseradish...other than that I followed almost exactly and we really loved it. Will definitely use it again. Next time I'll use on a spinach salad!

Let me start off by saying, I don't even like coleslaw (I made this as a topper for a brioche pork sandwich I was making for my hubby). This recipe is AMAZING! I subbed the garlic, pepper,  salt for equal parts of Paula dean house seasoning I had on hand and utilized a broccolini slaw mix- delish!

This was delicious, and a hit with the group I served it to. It's definitely an adaptable recipe,  based on the reviews I read and the good results everyone had. I didn't have horseradish or seasoned rice vinegar (I subbed cider vinegar) and approximately doubled the lemon juice. The flavor improved quite a bit after sitting for a couple of hours in the fridge, so I wouldn't recommend skipping that part of the directions.

Very tasty!!!  I was a little nervous about the horseradish, but it was worth putting it in!  The only coleslaw recipe I'll be using from now on.

Loved this - didn't have rice vinegar, used white balsamic.  Used celery seed instead of celery salt - didn't add any salt at all.

This creamy sauce is great!  Nice tang and sweetness.  I also used cider vinegar and didn't have horseradish on hand, but it still had a wonderful tang.  I didn't put in the extra salt beyond the celery salt. But don't use bagged slaw mix.  Seriously, why make a beautiful sauce to put on bagged slaw mix?  You can buy the ingredients much more cheaply and make coleslaw for days!  Today, I chopped up cabbage, carrots, bell pepper, and a bit of onion.  SO good!

Follow this recipe to the "T" and you can't go wrong. When done, taste and add more Cabbage or doll it up with other herbs or julienne veggies for your taste. It's a winner.

Just finished making this and it is great! Just what I was looking for. I had a small head of cabbage I needed to use before it went bad and added a small grated carrot. I used apple cider vinegar in place of the rice vinegar. Can't wait till it has set in the fridge for a few hours I'm sure it will just get better. I plan to serve it with some BBQ spare ribs.

The horseradish added just the right amount of extra kick to this coleslaw.  I substituted Splenda for sugar in this recipe to make it more diabetic-friendly and shredded my own cabbage and carrots rather than using a packaged coleslaw mix.  The result was very tasty.  

Edited to add:  This is my new favorite coleslaw recipe.  I made it again tonight and added both red onions and red pepper to it.  Yummy!

I had a bag of coleslaw and I chose this recipe cause i had all the ingredients and wouldn't take long to make.  I used all the ingredients except I forgot the horseradish.  The coleslaw still tasted great!! I did cut the ingredients in half as only had a 14 oz bag.  Definitely will make this again WITH the horseradish his time!

Love the flavor! Has a slight "bite". That, coupled with the crisp cabbage is so refreshing. I will use this again.

I tripled this recipe and followed it exactly. It turned out spicy and delicious. It's five days later and we are still enjoying the leftovers as it holds up very well. Over time, the bit of red cabbage has turned the salad pink, which is actually quite pretty! The amount of dressing is exactly right for the quantity of coleslaw mix. The horseradish gives a wonderful heat. I would do nothing to change this recipe.
