If I could rate this higher I would. It tastes a lot like pecan pie, but I like it better, very moist and oh so good. This was a huge hit with everyone, even my grandson who doesn't like pecan pie.  I didn't have light syrup, so I used the dark. I don't know if my oven is slow, but I had to cook it quite a bit longer than called for (55 minutes), the center was a bit gooey when taken out of the oven, but no longer jiggley, but they turned out perfect when cooled!  I just took another batch of them out of the oven for a party tomorrow.  I'm printing up recipe cards to share with everyone.

Made it for the in-laws for christmas since they love pecan pie and I didn't feel up to making a pie, and they loved it.  It was easy to do and I actually liked it too and I don't like pecan pies.  Sent what was left home with them and their friends loved it and now they want the recipe too.  Like one of the other members I had to cook it a little longer too.

I had to bake this for 50 minutes at 350 degrees before the center was set.  It turned out like a big brown gooey cake and looked nothing like the picture.  Taste was good, presentation needs help.  The recipe does not give any tips or hints.  I was mainly disappointed that these did not turn out like bars.
