The best bok choy recipe we've tried. We received one large head of bok choy in our weekly CSA box and kept the remaining ingredients as the recipe original calls. Perfect!

Fantastic dish!  The only variation I did was sub with a yellow pepper because I didn't have a red one. I know all peppers have different tastes, but this one worked too. YES, I will be making this again and again!  Thanks for posting the video.

I love Bok Choy.  I would leave out the soy sauce if I make it again.  I thought it just made it too salty without any flavor boost.  Maybe replace it with rice wine vinegar?

Good base but found it a bit bland.  Added hoisin sauce to the finished dish to liven it up.

I'd suggest using  oyster sauce instead if soy sauce without using salt, adjust then if necessary. Cooking bok choy and any greens are healthy.

So delicious and great for a quick, healthy side dish! I wasn't feeling the red bell pepper tonight so I used Cremini mushrooms instead, cooking them an additional 4 or 5 minutes before adding the white bok choy stalks. I also had a skillet of fond left over from making some pork tenderloin, so I cooked this in that pan for additional flavor! Worked beautifully.

This was a solid recipe, I thought the comments about it being bland are off since the ginger really came through.  I would cut the red pepper into the same size as the Bok Choy next time around and I though that the veggies needed to be could at least double what the recipe called for.  Thanks Chef John!

I've made a bunch of Chef John's recipes and love them so I was hopeful about this one, but it didn't do it for me.  I found it way too salty and a bit one-note.

This is my first time eating bok choy. I don't like the stalks but the greens portion is good. I didn't have sesame oil. I think that would added more flavor to it.

I like green leafy vegetables in general. My only problem with bok choy is that it does not have much flavour to it. So the garlic, ginger and pepper flakes add just the right zing to boring bok choy. Good idea about separating the leaves from the stem. I also like the way the stems are cut in an angle. When cutting, as much as possible make them the same size for even cooking. For a twist, while sauteing the stems I placed about a tablespoon of rice wine just enough to steam the stems a bit. Also, choose a japanese light soy so it would not be too salty.

Very good. I like the simplicity and subtle flavours. Allows one to really enjoy the greens as they should be enjoyed.
