This is yummy and creamy.  I devised a healthier version:  Use chicken broth and 1 TB of butter instead of the milk and 1/4 cup butter.  If you don't have the carayway and anise, some dashes of nutmeg adds a nice touch.  Potatoes actually are better after cooled in the fridge (the starch compounds change).  And throwing diced ham, or other salty meat if you happen upon some make this a hit with the kiddos.
