This was an easy, quick, and delicious recipe! My husband is Greek so to kick the taste up a little more I added a Greek seasoning mixture which added a nice taste. I also added the feta cheese into the pan at the end instead of putting it on top. Will make again!

this was very good!!!  I shredded the carrot & zucchini, so my picky family wouldn't realize it.  They all ate 2nd helpings.  I would double the amount of feta cheese.  It truly makes the dish.

Just happened to have the ingredients on hand (and little else in the house) so gave it a whirl. Better than expected! Pretty good quick and easy weeknight dinner! Only change - used a can of diced tomatoes and ketchup (to thicken) because I didn't have any tomato soup. Feta is really the key to the flavor, I would say it's not an option!

This recipe doesn't live up to its name.  It is basically a macaroni, hamburger, tomato soup recipe.  The only thing Greek about it is the "OPTIONAL" feta cheese.

My husband liked his, but the rest of us didn't.  It is definitely missing something.  We love greek food, especially feta, and it just tasted bland.  I'm going to try it again with alot of tweaking- more salt, some Greek Seasoning, a can of diced tomatos.  Hopefully that will help.

After reading the reviews, i tweaked a bit: while the pasta cooked, i matchsticked the carrots (so they'd cook faster) and started them cooking in the juices from (one can of fire-roasted tomatoes) (one can of mushrooms) (one large can of black olives). i used a lot of tuscan sunset seasoning (maybe 2T?). put in some pre-cooked ground beef from my freezer (maybe 3/4 lb?) and reduced the liquid a bit.  then added the canned veggies & can of soup w/out the water.  i only used about half the olives, and cut them in half.  served w/ parmesan cheese, not necessarily greek anymore, but everyone loved it!

The feta cheese is what makes this dish, so don't skimp on it.  I would prefer a little more of the carrot and zucchini in proportion to the macaroni.  Taste is good, although without the feta it would be just ordinary.

This was pretty tasty.  I used diced tomatoes instead of soup.  I liked the texture.  The feta cheese really adds a nice tang.

Meh, it was good, edible, and all that, but it wasn't anything *special*. The only change I made was using whole wheat elbow pasta. It's a good basic meal, and I'm sure kids would love it, and it's great for when you don't have much going on in the pantry and want something quick and hearty.

This was pretty good, but my zucchini turned out a little rubbery, unfortunately. I was expecting the tomato soup flavor to be stronger, so maybe next time I would add some fresh or canned tomatoes to the mix. I can't eat feta cheese, so I topped it with Parmesan instead. Overall, it was pretty good, but my husband thought it was very tasty. I used ground round steak and drained off all the fat.

This was surprisingly good. I was looking for a one skillet meal to make while camping, and this was perfect. I used cheddar cheese instead of feta, but either would be good. Quick and easy for a weeknight dinner.

Great Recipe with lots of flavor! We just added a bit more feta than it called for and used whole wheat penne because we did not have any macaroni!

Great recipe. Easy to make and the Feta cheese added to the flavor. It just reminded me a little of hamburger helper.

Yes I made changes, yes I will make it again.  The changes were because I had things to use up in the frig but they flow along with the dish itself.  I didn't drain the beef as I was using 93% lean ground beef and there wasn't much to drain.  I used matchstick carrots (about 1 cup) instead of quartering and slicing whole carrots. I added: 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms (add when you add the carrots); 2 TBSP  Worchestershire Sauce and the juice of half a lemon (both added with the soup) and I cut the water to half a can (5.25 oz. [since I added the Worchestershire, lemon juice and didn't drain the beef]).  I let the pasta and veggie beef mixture simmer about 10 minutes, and the pasta soaked up a lot of what liquid remained.  Worked out great.

I screwed up and forgot to read the reviews.  We love Greek food but found this very bland.  We will make it again, but will use spicy V8 instead of water, replace tomato soup with diced tomatoes and add Greek Seasoning.  I hope this improves my three score to a five.  Jack K.

This was good but I made some changes. I added fresh parsley and a quarter teaspoon of mint, beef broth instead of tomato soup and tomato penne pasta which was cooked in the skillet to add more flavor. Also added more feta.

It was delicious with a few alterations. After reading the reviews I could seat needed help. I exchanged the ground beef for ground lamb (more common in greek dishes). I used a can of organic chopped tomatoes with just a little bit of added water. Instead of macaroni I used a different shaped pasta (more for looks). I added a lot more spices/herbs. I had a little bit of mediterranean spice mix, little bit of extra salt, some fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden and 3 garlic cloves instead of two.

I made this with stew meat (didn't have Hamburger) and I seasoned my beef with Cavender's seasoning and I used diced tomatoes not tomato soup. I guess I made a completely different dish but it was good. oh and I doubled the feta

Definitely easy, but definitely not Greek.  My kids loved it, and I loved the veggies that it used.   It was so easy to make.  I didn't have tomato soup, so I used a 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes, un-drained.   Also threw in two small cans low sodium V-8 and 1/2 cup water.   It really is worth making again.   It tastes great, just not something you would serve at a dinner party, which is why only 4 stars.

This a great recipe for busy weeknights.  Everyone ate this up. I took the advice in an earlier review to add Greek spices. I found a recipe for a Greek spice blend that I used.  This introduced my kids to new flavor combinations.  A keeper.

This was a very good dish. The only thing I would've changed about the recipe is the amount of vegetables. The tomato sauce was good, although the dish wasn't very Greek like the title. I love Greek food, and this was a good alternative. Overall, it was very good and my family loved it.

I thought this was a very good, healthy meal.  The feta cheese really added some delicious flavor as well.  I didn't really like how crunchy the vegetables were, but it was still delicious.

Yummy and easy.  My 15 month old LOVED it (and hubby too).  Used fresh oregano from the garden and mixed in fresh tomatoes instead of zucchini.

This turned out much better than I expected - a real treat! I would strongly recommend the most lean hamburger, otherwise it could turn into a greasy Hamburger Helper meal. Otherwise, it turned out great - my wife and I were very surprised.
