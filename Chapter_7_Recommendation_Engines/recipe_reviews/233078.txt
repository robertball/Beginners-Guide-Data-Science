I love carrot salads that don't use mayonnaise. This salad is so fresh tasting. I thought the marshmallows would do nothing, but they were just enough to add a little sweetness to the salad, along with the little bit of sugar. Definitely a carrot salad I will make again.

Yummy Salad.  This is the second time I made this recipe.  First was before she was approved.  Made this salad minus the marshmallows early in the afternoon.  Allowed to sit in the fridge.  Will be making again.

I didn't have lemon or lime juice, so I substituted cranberry juice. It's tastes great! I bet chopped pecans would be a nice addition too. This is a good, basic, easy recipe. I recommend chilling it for several hours before serving.
