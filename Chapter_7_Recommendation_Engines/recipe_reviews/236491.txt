When I make a new recipe for the first time, I like to stick to the original ingredients. However, due to lack of some ingredients I had to substitute, and some, like the white sugar, I just never buy. Here's what I did: whole wheat flour, unsweetened coconut flakes, raw sugar, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt, 1/2 cup banana and 1 1/2 cups applesauce, and 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries. I bake them for a total of 23 minutes and they came out perfect, not dry and not mushy! I think the next time I make these I'll make the original recipe but switch out the butter with coconut oil…

These were delicious! My house needs a breakfast on the run during the week, and I felt that with the flax, oats and fruit this muffin was more than fluff to start the day. (Although they disappeared during the rest of the day, too...) I cut back on the sugar because I subbed honey greek yogurt for the sour cream and used frozen instead of fresh blueberries. It did take a little longer to bake, maybe 23-4 minutes. A hit!

These are excellent!  I cut the recipe to 6 servings, and I got 8 very nice muffins!  I followed the recipe exactly except that it took about 22 minutes to bake.  Next time I'll make a few more so that my freezer can produce a yummy serving whenever we want!  Thanks, Kate!

Amazing muffins.  Used all whole wheat flour, and unsweetened coconut and turned out wonderful.  Not too sweet.  Definitely will keep this as my main muffin recipe.

One of the best muffin recipes I've made! They are so moist and delicious - kids raved about them. I had to tell them to save some for tomorrow so they could have some for breakfast before school - a quick, hearty, healthy breakfast on the go. I did make a few of little changes to note: 1) substituted sliced almonds for the coconut because I didn't have coconut; 2) used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup all purpose flour; and 3) used 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of white sugar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Definitely making these again...in larger batches to freeze and have at the ready for those busy mornings!

I loved this recipe!  My 11 year old son had 3 of the muffins for breakfast, and my 5 year  old ate 2 muffins.  My husband gave me a thumbs up as well.  The muffins are delicious and have a nice moist texture yet due to oats, coconut and flax seed, has more substance to it than a typical muffin.  I was thrilled that I was able to use my ripe bananas and blueberries in 1 recipe- not to mention using flax seed which is great health benefits (Flax seed is an excellent source of fiber, Omega-3 fatty acids and antio xidants.).  Great recipe!

I made this with whole wheat flour and added some ground pecans for protein and it was amazing. The kids loved it and it made a large patch that lasted all week. The recipe is too thick to make a bread out of, stick to muffins!

Turned out great. I used coconut oil instead of butter, whole wheat pastry flour, I slightly chopped regular old fashioned oatmeal for a finer texture , and baked a few minutes longer. Will use this recipe again and try other fruit add-ins for variety.

I definitely make this again.  I made a few changes as listed below:  Honey instead of sugar
                Yogart instead of sour cream
                 Coconut oil instead of butter
                  Saskatoons instead of blue berries.
                  not as much applesauce
Turned out great

Yummy!  I made exactly as the recipe says and it turned out great.  The next batch I added pumpkin seeds, cashews and walnuts, and that made it even better.  This one's a keeper.

Deliciously light and fluffy! To improve the nutritional value I used 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, half of the salt, and 3/4 cup apple sauce as I only used 1/4 cup of butter. Still turned out fabulous!

These muffins are moist and delicious! I usually modify recipes to make them my own, however, this one is perfect and foolproof. I will make them again as they were a hit with the family.

My favorite recipe so far, I substituted sour cream for yogurt. Also it was a little dry at first so I also added water to thin it and lowered the temp to 325 and baked about 30-35 min. It came out super moist and full of flavor

My favorite breakfast ever! I make them in bulk, freeze them, and take one out each morning to microwave for 30 secs. I use coconut sugar instead of white sugar, and nonfat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and it comes out amazing!

These are very good! Making half the recipe, I used 1/4 cup unrefined sugar and 1/2 Brown sugar. Only making half I still got 12 regular muffins, 12 mini muffins, and a small loaf of muffin bread.

Delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe, only minor adjustments. Didn't quite do a full cup of ground flax seed, and since I didn't have bananas or apple sauce on hand I just peeled and cored a few ripe apples and simmered them in a pan with a bit of sugar and apple juice while I was mixing up the other ingredients. Then I just mashed them, made sure I had 1 cup (added a bit more juice to make the difference) and tossed them in.

I made 48 smaller muffins rather than 24 big ones.  They were really gooey and had an odd flavor, maybe from the flax?  I wouldn't make them again.

Very good! I did cut the butter in half and subbed coconut oil for the 1/4 stick of butter. They are very moist and delicious my kids at them for dessert:)

Just made these and they are delicious. I didn't have "quick-cooking" rolled oats so added my old fashioned oats to the wet ingredients before the other dry ingredients and let them soak for about 5 minutes. I also used whole wheat flour and they turned out perfectly moist. Yum!

Very good. Ingredients I had on hand and great to freeze and grab for going out the door in the morning. Used frozen blueberries and a few frozen raspberries too.

My family loves these muffins. Only thing I may try next tie is to add some brown sugar. I'm a bit afraid to mess with perfection! Yummmm!

We really enjoyed these muffins.  I had to use quick steel oats and greek yogurt instead of rolled oats and sour cream because I didn't have the other ingredients on hand.  My substitutions worked out great and will definitely make these again the same way.  A great hearty muffin for breakfast for my kids and these would be great to freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!
