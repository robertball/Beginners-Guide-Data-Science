I was looking forward to making this for awhile and everything came together for us today.  I enjoy ragu particularly the veggies.  This recipe is time intensive, but simple to make.  Three observations - first I did not use the 3rd cup of water, the consistency was where I wanted it so I omitted it.  Second, during the step where you take the lamb out and cut it into smaller pieces, I simply put the pieces in a large metal bowl and used to forks to shed it, that worked out great.  This final item is a suggestion,  I tuned up the sauce all day as it was cooking, then I zested a whole orange (about 1 Tablespoon) and put it in at the end with the Rosemary and Pepper Flakes as directed. Honestly the amount of orange zest over powered the other flavors.  Next time I will add a 1/2 Teaspoon of Zest and see if more is required from there.   Thank you for the very good meal!

I used frozen pearl onions that I caramelized before adding to ragu. I served this (along with other dishes) for a Easter buffet. It was the most complemented item I served. The chili flakes added just enough bite at the end to make you want to take another bite!!

I made this a couple of years ago and remember it being delicious.  It’s hard to find fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, and especially marjoram) in rural Louisiana since virtually no grocery stores stock them and lamb is only available around Christmas or Easter.  I just omitted the marjoram and used a tiny bit of oregano instead since they’re similar in flavor but not strength.  Also, I used a Pinot noir instead of white wine.  It makes quite the hearty and delicious meal.

This was a 4 star for me but 5 star for my friend and her husband. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and round up since I was using leftover lamb from a whole lamb we had catered for a party. To say we were lambed out was an understatement! It was super easy to throw together and the flavor is spot on. It does take time for all of the flavors to develop so don’t try to cook for a shorter time and expect the same result. I used leftover cooked lamb that was cooked in a simple Mediterranean way so i don’t believe it changed the flavor of the recipe in any way.  It was great right out of the pot and even better the next day. You could def make ahead for a dinner party and just reheat right before serving.
