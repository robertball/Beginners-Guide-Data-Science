I followed the recipe exact with the exception of putting in an extra apple since they were so small but unfortunately they did not taste good. They tasted like baking soda and coconut oil.  I'd recommend to lower the amount of baking soda and coconut oil.

Very good for healthy pancakes.  I did change a bit just to make a bit more healthy.  I took out the sugar and used 1/4 c of unsweetened applesauce.  I added 1/4 c of flax and reduced the wheat flour to 1 3/4 c.  We enjoyed and my husband is hard to please.  Next time I will add blueberries-I really think they would work well with this recipe.
