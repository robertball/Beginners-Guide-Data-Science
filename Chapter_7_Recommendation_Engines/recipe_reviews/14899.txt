Easy and yummy!  I did marinate the bacon in a soy sauce/ brown sugar base for 10 minutes before assembly.  Received great reviews.  Doesn't get much easier for something that tastes complex.

Sooo easy and delicious!  Great party appetizer.  To cut down on grease, I place a cooling rack on my baking sheet and bake the chestnuts on that.

This is my signature dish. I bring this to all our gatherings.  Everyone loves to eat this.  I cut some of the larger water chestnuts, so that people can just pop them into their mouths.  I also cut a package of bacon into thirds. Everyone loves this !!

I used what I had on hand, KC Masterpiece Honey-Teriyaki Marinade with Sesame sauce, and these things turned out DELICIOUS.  I didn't have time to marinate, so I just wrapped the water chestnuts in bacon and drizzled the sauce over the top.  (One bottle of sauce was more than enough for a double batch.)  I did drain these about half-way through cooking, and cooked a little longer so bacon would be crisp.  Even though these were great, I'll bet they'd be even better when they're marinated.

These were very good. Everyone raved about them. Easy to make. A little too salty, but that's just the teriyaki sauce. Next time will look for low-sodium ingredients.

I usually soak water chestnuts in low sodium soya sauce briefly. ( if they are too large I cut them in halves. and only wrap with enough bacon to wrap around water chestnut once. ) Teryaki was a nice change !

I've been making these since I can rememeber. The trick is to use the regular bacon NOT the center cut thick stuff. The thinner cheaper bacon crisps up way better, and the thick stuff stays soggy. Also, we don't even bother with terriyaki inside the rollups and it's still delicious. Instead you can dip them into a dip of your choice after cooking, and we usually choose warmed BBQ sauce. My mom used to put a dab of ketchup in there while rolling up, which also adds a yummy sweet touch without being overwhelming. Try these!

I make these a LOT to bring to people's houses.  The adults and the kids just EAT THEM UP!!!  I cut the bacon into 3rds, and it is plenty long enough.  I love these because I can cook them at home and then bring them in a little crock pot - they travel very well!!

AMAZING party appetizer! I used a tomato-based chili sauce instead of teriyaki, and they came out awesome! I also cooked the bacon for way longer than called for so it was actually crispy. I got MANY comments saying one thing- the people I served have had this appetizer before, but EVERYONE said this was the best recipe so far :)

I made these for our Christmas Eve gathering and everyone LOVED them, including those that had never heard of water chestnuts before :). I accidentally marinated the chestnuts in soy sauce, not teriyaki, but they were great! I also could only find sliced chestnuts...so I had to stack a few together. Thanks for Sharing!

I knew that thick sliced maple bacon was probably not the best choice for this recipe but I had some that needed to be used so I went w/ that. Loved the maple flavor w/ the teriyaki! Next time I will use thin sliced  maple bacon though because it was a little fatty.

Full size water chestnuts are not appealing.  You really should cut them in half.  And I love water chestnuts.

I made this for our girls cookie party..and it was a big hit~!
The hardest part was wrapping the bacon, and I had to cut some of my water chestnuts in half., but it was delicious~!!
My only change was i drizzles a little barbie sauce over them the last 5 minutes of baking. YUM~!

This was great - with some folks saying it was too salty I saw another recipe where a piece of sliced pineapple was added.  The salty/sweet combination was perfect!

I have used this recipe many times. A week ago I had promised them to a friend for his Birthday, but as I ran out of time to cook them in the oven I deep fat fried them for 30 seconds.(Fryer was all ready on)They like them better cooked this way.

My family loves these. You can't eat just one. I made them with a sweet and zesty BBQ sauce, this gave a wonderful flavor.
