Soooo good!  I used olives instead of dried mushrooms, rutabagas instead of the fresh mushrooms, 30W motor oil instead of olive oil, Venezuelan beaver cheese instead of goat cheese, and squirrel instead of chicken.      OK, I'm kidding, but really, why do people post how much they love a recipe, then proceed to tell you how they completely changed it?   It cracks me up!

The reason the previous reviewers chicken burned is probably because she altered the ingredients without altering the cooking.  Chicken thighs are a lot smaller and need to be cooked on lower heat.  (BTW-The recipe DOES state to remove the bone).  I made this almost as is except for the addition of re-constituted chopped sun-dried tomatoes that I happened to have on hand to the stuffing mixture.  I also did not use dried mushrooms and as a consequence substituted veggie stock for the reserved mushroom stock in the recipe.  Perfect recipe.  Even my 7 year old loved it.

I had to change this recipe a bit since I only had fresh mushrooms, sherry vinegar instead of balsamic, chicken thighs instead of breasts, and I wanted more garlic. My hubby said the cheese wasn't too goaty, and the mushrooms weren't too strong - it was a nice balance. I would also recommend removing the bone - it's so much easier to eat.

The biggest problem I had with this recipe is that well before the chicken was done, the skin burnt where it had been stuffed. 

I will definitely make this, or a slight variation, again, but I think it has to be covered until the last 5-10 minutes to prevent the skin from burning.

4 stars as written
5 stars if the skin didn't burn

This was one of the best meals I have ever eaten! My whole family LOVED it! I plan on making this meal very often.  The only thing i did different was to use boneless chicken breasts and I just sliced them almost completely in half to stuff them.

I changed this a lot!!! For the filling only used fresh mushrooms and replaced the goats cheese with Parmesan. I used a chicken breast with no skin which I battered out then put the mushroom stuffing in the middle and rolled up. I then wrapped the rolled chicken in streaky bacon which I basted with the balsamic/honey sauce. Didn't bother with the pan sauce, just kept basting the chicken every 10mins or so. It ended up being a very lovely dish. Thanks for the inspiration!

My hubby and I have lost a bunch of weight, and we're always looking for new, tasty recipes that are within our caloric limits.  This recipe totally exceeded my expectations!  It was savory, flavorful and very, very good.  I did six smallish chicken breasts.  I never cook skin-on breasts, so I cut pockets and stuffed the mixture inside the breasts.  I didn't use the food processor; I cut the mushrooms by hand.  I had some left over, so I added it to the sauce I made from the pan drippings.  This was AMAZINGLY good, and I didn't tweak the recipe itself really at all. I like to try it the way it is written first before I tweak it!

I added mozzarella cheese, less than a hand full of fresh baby spinach leaves, and sun dried tomatoes to the filling. I served the chicken over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was to die for! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!

Did this dish for my girlfriend's birthday as she loves goat cheese. Made no change to the recipe - used Lobster dehydrated shrooms. The taste was to die for. Only warning might be to have aluminum foil ready to place on breasts near end of 45 min cooking period. Meat was cooked to perfection, but skin was a little more cooked than I'd like. HIGHLY recommended - P.S. Gravy was WONDERFUL!!

This was a fantastic dish, and using boneless chicken breasts with the filling stuffed inside them makes for a nice change.

This did not turn out well for me. Baking the chicken breast at 425 for that long was like boiling it in its own juices, the chicken was hard and over done. The honey balsamic was just a bit off tasting. Will take it off my saved recipes. Maybe I didn't "get this" recipe, there could be hope for it, just not for me.

This recipe was AMAZING! Used chicken breasts- no skin, and did not find dried mushrooms so used fresh. I LOVE goat cheese, and the honey/balsamic sauce was AWESOME. I started to notice the chicken getting dry so I basted them with sauce and covered them with foil at 25 minutes, and continued cooking for another 10. I have no complaints, and will definitely make this again! YUM!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I had organic, free range, boneless skinless breast and really wanted a dish to take advantage of this premium chicken!  I just followed another reviewer and cut a hole in the side of the breast and stuffed it.  I used gorgonzola and feta because i didn't have goat cheese, and i think next time i might even completely substitute gorgonzola for the goat cheese.  Make sure to keep basting if you use skinless, because the chicken did get slightly dry - i might cover in foil for most of the cooking time next time. Altogether satisfying and yummy, plus I think that after you cook it a couple of times it will be really easy without even needing to reference the recipe much.  This is definitely going into the rotation.

I tweaked this recipe a lot, but it turned out absolutely fabulous. 1) I had no dried mushrooms, but one pound of fresh. I put the fresh mushrooms, the garlic, 1/2 very large zucchini, and some chicken stock into the blender (added just enough chicken stock to enable the blender blades to move and mince the ingredients) 2) I made the sauce before basting. I used 1/3c balsamic, 1/3c honey, 1/8c chicken stock, splash of thyme, splash of savory, splash of orange juice, and garlic powder to taste.  3) I thinly sliced one scallion and one stalk of celery and sauteed them in 1 tbsp of olive oil.  4) I added the scallions and celery to the stuffing mix 5) I used skinless chicken breasts, just cut them in half lengthwise and stuffed them 6) I drizzled 1/2 of the sauce on top of them, ensuring the celery and onions were left on top of the breasts 7) I baked them at 400 for 35 minutes, checking often 8) I took some of the reserve sauce, boiled, removed 2 tbsp, and added 1 tsp cornstarch.  9) Added the cornstarch-mix back to the original extra sauce and let it simmer until thick 10) spooned the thickened sauce over the stuffed breasts when served 11) served with mashed potatoes and salad.  It turned out fabulously. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Thought this was great!  loved the sauce it complimented the chicken wonderfully!  I think I will reduce the thyme the next time, it seemed a little over powering.  I used a cast iron skillet to roast the chicken and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a keeper!  My husband HATES chicken but he "ate the whole thing."  I followed the advice of others and used skinless/boneless chicken breasts; whole fresh mushrooms that I chopped myself, and substituted the cheese with Feta.  Was careful not to over cook the chicken by cooking 25 min, but should have stuck with 20  ALSO, I stuffed the breasts and secured the stuffing with toothpicks.  The honey/Balsamic juice that resulted after the cooking was thicken with just a bit of cornstarch.  I served it with a spinach salad. This was so easy and SO GOOD.

This was a great recipe...I altered it a little in the following ways:  1. Used Boneless Chicken Breasts pounded flat and rolled up the mushroom mixture inside..needed about 10 minutes less cooking time this way 2. I added a little White Wine to the mushrooms and olive oil instead of butter 3. I used Mozzarella Cheese instead of Goat Cheese  This was fantastic and is now a familty fave!

This recipe didn't come out quite how I had wanted - the stuffing portion requires you to mince the mushrooms in a food processor (I also skipped the whole re-constituted mushroom step), and cook until "nearly" all the liquid was evaporated. They should have said "until you're sure ALL the liquid is absolutely evaporated." The next step was to add the goat cheese then, not wait for it to cool, and then it turned into an unattractive mushy mess - and too runny. It was difficult to stuff because of this. I'd suggest just roughly running a big knife through the mushrooms by hand to get a more coarse texture - it shrinks while cooking anyway and will probably be easier to stuff. I ended up spooning a bit of the mixture on top as well to get a bit more of it, and served with a mashed potato with kale mixture and asparagus. Great way to add a punch of vegetables in the meal!

I thought this was really good (loved the stuffing) but my husband thought it was just ok (not a goat cheese fan).  Will definitely make again and just feed him something else! :)

huge hit in our house! I used skinless chicken breast, wich ended up making my dish a bit dry, next time, I will cook maybe only 25 minutes, and move it to the middle rack.  also I didn't have dryed mushrooms, so I just brewed my fresh ports with boiling chicken broth and thme, for 20 minutes, then blended in my mixer,  the taste was a 10 out of 10, I can not wait to try it again with my needed adjustments.

I am always looking for something new to cook and this one was great. The balsamic and honey tasted so much better than I imagined. Only change would be to maybe use feta cheese or a milder cheese. I do not care for goat cheese. That's all I could taste in the stuffing. And don't bother using a food processor, I minced my mushrooms myself and they were perfect. This recipe was easy to make. I even ate the leftover breast and I never eat left over chicken.

This was very tasty, but stuffing the chicken was time comsuming, next time I will just make a sauce with the ingredients and pour over sauted chicken.

This got rave reviews from my boyfriend after only one bite.   The only changes I made was to use bone-in breasts and cooked 40 mins basting a few times with honey mix and subbed a lowfat blue cheese spread for the goat cheese.  I skipped the pan gravy part and served with a creamy broccoli side.
