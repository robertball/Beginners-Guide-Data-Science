I don't think I would like this as a salad dressing, but it was great added into my egg salad. Thanks!

I did not make the whole recipe, just what I needed. I would use 1/2 cup of pickle juice to increase the pickle flavour. Also, fresh dill is best for this as it is much more fragrant; having used the dried it didn't come through as strong as I'd hoped. I initially thought I wouldn't particularly like it on a salad, which I didn't. This might make a great addition to an egg or potato salad.
