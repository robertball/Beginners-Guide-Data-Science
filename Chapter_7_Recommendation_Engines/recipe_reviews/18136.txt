well i had some extra sauerkraut and figured what better way to get rid of it than to make a soup! i followed the recipe pretty much step by step and my end result was less than thrilling. i would definately drain and fry the sauerkraut next time as many of the other recipes suggest doing. it also needs some extra spices the liven things up, maybe some horseradish would do the trick next time. the good part was that this makes a TON of food. i was eating it for a good 3 days. probably wont try making this again.

This was rather potent. I agree with another reviewer, you may want to drain the sauerkraut before adding it to the soup. Add some water or broth if you need to. I didn't have a 20 oz. package of sauerkraut, so I used 2 15 oz. cans. MISTAKE! I added an extra can of tomatoes, but that didn't help much. I added sugar and more sausage to the leftovers and still had difficulty with the vinegar flavor. Stick to the original amounts of the ingredients.

I liked this a lot! I used low fat turkey sausage and some extra spices to heat things up a bit; I also covered the dish when it looked like the rice wasn't going to be done according to the time in the directions. It was still not quite done perfectly, so I will cook a little longer next time. The last thing I did was add a little brown sugar to mellow the tanginess a bit.

This recipe is really good, I used spicy stewed tomatoes, italian style and right before I served it, I added some parsley to it. Delicious and very easy. Thank you

I liked this concept so, I gave it a try.  I did make some adjustment.  First, I grilled the kielbasa...on that note, I may add more kielbasa next time.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes and 2 fresh tomatoes which were trying to go bad.  I only used 2 cups of water and added an extra cup of rice (2 cups total).  I really wanted this to be thick!  With the liquid from the tomatoes, it worked out well.  I did drain the sauerkraut.  I also added basil and horseradish (thanks for the suggestion) with the tomatoes.  I was really happy with the results.  It was hearty and had a really nice flavor.  I will probably make it again and again!
