Iâ€™ve made this quite a few times. And every single time it gets a little better. I love trying to make foods that look a little challenging. The first time I mad it I was totally scared hour it would come out. But everyone always loves when I make it. Even my now 11 (he was 8 the first time I made it) picky eater LOVES IT!
