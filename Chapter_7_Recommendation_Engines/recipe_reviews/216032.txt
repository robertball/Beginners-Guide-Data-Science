This was wonderful and unique, perfect for fall season. I did feel that the cider made it overly sweet, so i added savory flavors such a bay leave, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, a dash of worcester sauce, and basil. Also, if i did it again, i would use beef stock as the addition at the end instead of water. Sweet potatoes were also a wonderful addition to the flavor mix. Will definitely be cooking every year for the fall!

This was the best stew that I've ever eaten. I did make a few changes but nothing major. First of all, I tossed the beef with flour and spices and then put in the slow cooker. I did not wait until beef was cooked before adding the juice mix to the beef. I added Worcestershire sauce, savory, more thyme, dried basil and 2 beef bouillon cubes to the cider before putting the juice in my crock pot. I let the broth and beef cook for 1 hour before adding my veggies. I used baby potatoes, sweet potato, brussel sprouts in addition to the ingredients in the recipe. I let this cook on high for another 3 hours and it came out AMAZING. I will be making this often. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a big hit, and the best thing is that it got better with age. If we had self-control we should've let it sit a day. Oh well. Leftover were awesome.   I fudged and used more potatoes than I should have, and added some mushrooms. The way I thought of this recipe was that it was pot roast, plus cider minus the crockpot. And more potatoes for me is always a good thing. But that meant I had to add more liquid -- a bit more cider and a bit more water. I really wasn't sure about the apples in the stew itself, but it turned out perfect.   I think some of the amounts seemed small, like the amount of flour needed to coat the meat, or the black pepper. I'm a fresh black pepper fiend, so I made sure to add lots more pepper. Mmm. Tasty. Good counterpoint to the sweet.

Made this today for tomorrow.  smelled wonderful and tastes even better!  I think pork would work just as well, or maybe even better-pork and apples are a great combo!  will definitely make again!

This is a nice twist on an old recipe.  The cider reduces and lends an interesting sweetness to the dish.  I followed the recipe pretty well, but used beef broth instead of H2O.  I used fresh thyme and needed a lot of it to have any flavor. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  My husband is an executive chef and he gave it 9 on a zero to ten scale!  The stew is very filling!!  Use fiji or an apple that will hold up when cooked.  An apple like Macintosh will turn to mush.  The beef turned out extremely tender.  Very yummy.  Didn't give 5 stars because I reserve that distinction for "to die for" recipes and this is good, but not a 5. I would consider adding a few green beans next time to give it more color.  It's kind of a gray color. Try it!

this is one of the best beef stew recipe I had so far. Didn't take me long to make it, perfect for the winter; warm and comforting. the sweetness the apple cider brings plays well with the other ingredients. i had to use 3 cups instead of 2 and a 1/2 of cider. overall it's a good dish i give it  a 5 out of 5

I happened to have all the ingredients already except for apple cider so, I used apple juice and extra water instead.  I also added a chili pepper for good measure.  Delish!

I was looking for an apple cider pork stew recipe for my thermo cooker when I found this. This is a good recipe and easy to make. Instead of beef stew meat, I used pork stew meat. I also used Granny Smith apples instead of Fiji apples, 1 can of chicken broth, added basil, coriander, tarragon, bay leaves, and used a thermo cooker to make this. Hubby approved!

Love this stew. Very nice to change up our stews with a natural, sweeter flavor.  The kids love it. It's perfect for fall.

I've been making a variation of this for years and it's always a favorite.   I don't use thyme.  For the liquid I use a dash or 2 of worchestershire.  1 can tomato soup or tomato sauce, 1 can beef consomme or french onion soup  and fill the crock pot the rest of the way with cider after I add the veggies.  Crockpot on low for 5 hours. Just don't skip the part about browing the meat separately or it gets very dry.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and added a can of beef broth rather than water. I also added a little extra thyme when I added the cider.

In addition, I sauteed the onions with the beef before I added the cider. 

My soup was brown. I suspect that was because I added beef broth. 

It was good. I'd make it again. My daughter didn't like the apples in the stew but my husband, two sons and I did not mind it at all.

I never thought of apples or apple cider with beef, however I did make this same recipe with pork. I usually use  a least expensive cut such as pork but roast and it is very good with spareribs.  I also always use my crock pot/slow cooker.

Nice twist on beef stew and nothing really negative to say about it, but it's missing that special something that would make it memorable. Not sure I would make again unless I had apple cider I was looking to use up!

This was okay, not great. I used cubed pork loin instead of beef, and beef broth instead of water. It really left something to be desired...I'm not sure what it's lacking. The recipe is worth playing around with. Maybe I'll add some bacon next time.

This recipe was very good.  I added beef boullion as recommended by others, only one potato, and some cabbage, as that is what I had.  I will make it again, but not every month.

This is a great recipe. Agree with other posters about adding beef stock and water at the end if you have it. I also usually add extra thyme because, well... I love it. Fabulous fall meal.

Outstanding!!  The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan because who doesn’t want to scrape up all those delicious bits with a little wine? So, instead of adding the full cup of water as instructed I only added 1/2 cup of water.  This was by far the most flavorful stew I have ever made. I did not find this to be overly sweet with all of the cider nor did I find it to be bland in anyway. Definitely a keeper.

I made this during a Nor'easter, so I used my oven to cook it low & slow, at about 270F for 8 hours in a dutch oven. I used 5 McIntosh apples (they're my favorite apples), added extra carrots & celery, & added about 1 teaspoon of dried Tarragon. I skipped the step of browning the meat. I checked & stirred the stew about every hour, & added more cider when too much liquid had evaporated. The result: tender beef infused w/ wonderful apple flavor & delicious vegetables in tangy yet savory broth. Slow cooking thickened the stew without having to add flour.

I made this with 1 lb of cubed pork and 1 lb of hot Italian sausage. Also thickened it with a jar of pork gravy. The combination of sweet cider and the savory sausage made for an exceptional dish.

Wow, it’s so amazing! I doubled the recipe besides the meat so that there would be plenty! I added the same amount of thyme though(just forgot to add it the second time) and a sweet potato instead of extra carrots (ran out). I wish I would have had more apples... they, the broth and the meat were the best!! Sooo good! The soup is genius, and the beef goes surprisingly well with the broth. Don’t be afraid of the sweet.. it works— it is an apple cider soup after all!

A keeper in this household. (I had to use 1 cup of apple juice and the rest water with beef bullion.) My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  Will definitely be my go to stew recipe.

Pretty darn tasty!

Like other users, I feared the apple cider broth would be too sweet - so I toned it down with worcestershire, basil and a nice dash of cayenne and paprika. 

I ended up doubling my recipe, and instead of finishing it with two cups of water, I substituted one of those cups for beef broth which added a nice layer of savory flavors in the end. 

Definitely keeping this one around for the rest of apple season! :)

This was really good.  Changes I made were to cook the onion and celery with the beef from the beginning along with a crushed clove of garlic, added a chopped sweet potato for one of the white potatos, added about 1 1/2C brussels sprouts, and added about 1T of dried parsley (we always have parsley in our stew).  There was a lot of veggies to the beef, so if you're more of a carnivore, I'd up the amount of beef.  I think this would be good with pork too and will probably give it a try.

Hearty, flavourful and just the right mix for the season.  The only parts I changed for this recipe were when I added specific ingredients and the cook time.  I'm a fan of sloooow cooking and for this stew I stretched the cook time to eight hours.  I find it allows the different ingredients to, well, stew ;). The carrots and potatos were added almost right away, the celery an hour after that, the herbs were added three hours into the cooking time and the apples at four.  I added onions and garlic six hours in, with the cider split between half at the very beginning and half in the last hour.  When my kidlets are home, we eat well and by their reactions alone, this recipe has been written into our book of new family traditions.

This was a very good stew, though a little too sweet for my taste. I'll make it again and maybe toss in some fresh herbs to balance the sweetness.

Way too sweet and the beef lost all its flavor after being simmered for so long, so all you could taste was watered down apple cider.

Good recipe, but not the best. I would give it 3.5 stars if possible. The first recipe I ever tried from this site was for beef stew (which I loved), and I still had some meat left over in the freezer, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the mild sweetness was pretty good. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, however I wasn't able to put all the potatoes and apples with the amount of liquid in the pot. I ended up using half of them because I did not have enough cider (or room in the pot for that matter) and did not want to water it down too much. I also added a beef bouillon cube (stock) as advised in other reviews for some savoriness, which worked out well. Overall, if I were to do it again, I'd add a bit more meat and less potatoes. The amount of carrots was perfect.

Absolutely delightful!  I went with the advice of others and used beef broth instead of water. I ended up using close to 2 C of broth as opposed to 1 C as recipe called for. I used large russet potatoes which is probably why I needed to add more liquid. Also used winesap apples, as that's what I had on hand.  Even my picky eater loved it! I will definitely be making this again!
