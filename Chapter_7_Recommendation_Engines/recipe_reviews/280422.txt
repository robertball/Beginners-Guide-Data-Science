Loved that it didn't taste too fishy, I have never pan seared scallops before. I will say my daughter loved it which is quite an accomplishment!

Everyone loved them. Made for my husband bday.
Should have used a different pan for more browning, the non stick pan could have done better. But great flavor

What a beautiful meal. Very quick and easy to make. The presentation is wonderful and the flavor is outstanding.. The sauce reduces very well into a thick consistency, making it wonderfully flavorful. I Heartily recommend the diced tarragon on top.

It was spectacular. We did not add the Terragon, as we didn't have any, but it was great without. We will make these again in the future.

Very delicious! Easy. I never liked scallops until now. 
Hubby said the sauce would be good with grilled chicken as well.
Good amount of sauce. Definitely on our rotation now.
