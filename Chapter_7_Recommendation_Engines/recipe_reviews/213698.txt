This wasn't bad but it's not the world's best in my opinion.  The best I ever made was a recipe I found in the December 2001 issue of Gourmet.  I took that one to a few parties and came home with an empty bowl.

I don't typically like fruit in salad, salsa, and guacamole, but this was FANTASTIC! The sweet tartness of the pomegranate accompanies the avocado perfectly!
