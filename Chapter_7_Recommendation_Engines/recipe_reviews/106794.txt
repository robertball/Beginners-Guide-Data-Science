I didn't care for this recipe. I had another that was delish but I have misplaced it. I believe that it used less egg whites and corn syrup instead of honey.

If I could give this recipe a zero, I definitely would. I sincerely advise anyone to find a different recipe.. I was going to make this for my diabetic Grandfather, but I guess not.... Ingredients wasted :(

I followed recipe only to receive a bowl of MUSH when I was done.  Definitely must use less egg whites or something.  Waste of ingredients!

This sounds good I plan to try it!  One suggestion that may cut the sugar even further is that they make sugar free honey now too and it is really good!  :)

I followed the directions perfectly but after I pulled the popcorn out of the oven the kernels blew up in my face and melted my nose off....Oh well at least I won't be so nosey anymore.

I was so looking forward to this treat, I made it for my boss'birthday.....ugh!  The popcorn seemed to melt while baking.  I did put the pan in the frig afterwards and it dried out and turned hard.  The taste wasn't too bad, and the texture turned out like a granola.

Maybe I did something wrong, tho I checked my steps and everything seemed in order. The popcorn got soggy after being tossed and turned brown in the oven. After Baking for 20 minutes, popcorn was thoroughly soggy and I decided to give up. I wish this would have worked, it was suppose to be Christmas presents for my nephews. :(
