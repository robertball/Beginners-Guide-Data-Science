The dough does not stay together. Crumbling apart and everything. Took them out still optimistic, and can say you can find WAY better recipes than this.

I added a half cup more of flour and a bit of cinnamon. I didn't have wax paper so I rolled them into balls and baked as directed. They came out great and my kids love them.

What a great recipe!  I was short on pecans but they are still great! Easy to make in two sessions -- mixing and baking!

Icebox cookies are my Dadâ€™s favorite. Love the addition of the colored cherries for Christmas.
