Will definitely make this again. I used real milk in place of the almond milk.

Used regular milk instead of the almond milk.  Wasn't bad but wasn't the best.

Did not care for the thyme herb in the recipe, will skip it next time  but needs something to enhance it.  I used arborio rice and cooked on stove top slowly adding the liquids.

The only change I made to the basic recipe was to omit garlic, as we don't care for it.  I also made this in the crock pot as mentioned in the notes section.  I found the recipe to be a bit bland and the crock pot method did not appear to use all of the liquids as stated in the ingredients.  The rice also appeared to be overcooked through this method.  I added LF sour cream the next day to give it some flavor. I love the idea of using the almond milk and will try using the skillet method next time to see if the outcome is different.
