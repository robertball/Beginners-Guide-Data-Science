This turned out very nicely.  I used 1/2 cup of real butter(margarine is terrible for you), 1/2 cup less sugar, used 1/4 cup more reduced fat sour cream, used chunky spiced applesauce from trader joes, softened the raisin in the boiling water with the noodles, and used almost a cup of graham cracker powder and 1 tsp cinnamon mixed with 4 table spoons of melted butter and sprinkled that mixture on the top instead of on the bottom.  I baked for 50 minutes.  Next time I might even cut the sugar some more.  I think the graham cracker "crust" prevented the noodles from getting dry and burnt.  The crust was a nice golden brown - no burning.

I have never liked noodle puddings, but a favor to my mother inspired me to try this recipe - success! She called it the "best kugel I have ever had in my entire life." I still don't like most kugels, but this has become one of my favorite year-round dishes.

I use only 1 C sugar, 8 oz of chunky applesauce,  soaked sultanas (golden raisins), and no graham crackers crumbs. It is far less sweet and creamy than most kugels this way, and it really emphasises the appley-cinnamon flavour.

Excellent! I made mine with unsweetened applesauce and it was still sweet, just perfect.

I brought this to a Yom Kippur break fast and people couldn't get enough! As suggested, I cut the sugar and used unsweetened apple sauce. My only complaint was the graham cracker crust turned a bit soggy--perhaps something else would have been better texture-wise.

Really excellent recipe.  I left out the sour cream because I hate sour cream and used milk and it did not change it all.  It was so good and everyone ate it within minutes of it coming out of the oven!

This kugel is the third recipe I've tried so far and I just can't seem to find one that I like.  The first two were not sweet enough and this one was too sweet.  I used cranberry applesauce and more lemon juice because I like it tart, but I think I will cut down on the amount of sugar next time.  Also, will cover with foil next time because the top part of my noodles "crispified" (burned).  Thanks for sharing though.

This was my first try at kugel, and it turned out perfectly.  It was very easy and delicious.  It also kept well in the fridge for a few days as we finished it.  I will definitely make it again.

I made a lot of changes and it still turned out great! Instead of applesauce (long story), I used one granny smith cut up, but two would be better. Also, I substituted 3 eggs for the egg mixture and only used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup butter. I did not add raisins or crumbs, but might next time. Therefore, it was not too sweet. It didn't burn at all --loved it! I plan to make it again very soon for work.

Very very good. Based on suggestions here, I've made this a couple times with some modifications. First thing I changed was to bake the graham cracker crumbs on TOP (moistened with margarine or butter that I already melted from what the recipe calls for) during the last 15 minutes or so in the oven. I agree that the sugar needs to be cut (I used regular applesauce though, not unsweetened) to either 1 1/2 cups or less depending on how your family likes it. I've also substituted the sour cream with soy milk with good results to make the recipe dairy free. All that said, this is really a great recipe, the flavors of the apple, cinnamon, graham cracker, and raisin (if you like raisin) come together so well. Yum!

This is great! I've been making this recipe for the past three years.  I took advice from some of the other reviews...LESS SUGAR! This is key. I am not Jewish and all of my Jewish friends can't believe that 1. I know how to make kugel, 2. that it's good & 3. that it's healthier!!

A friend from work just lost her mother. I had never been to a Shiva (I am Catholic) and I wanted to bring something special for her. I made this Kugel. I changed it a bit too by using one stick of butter instead of margerine, 6 eggs, 1 cup of sugar and the chunky, regular sour cream and sweetened applesauce.  I was nervous as I had never made it but took the shot and my friend and her family and friends absolutely loved it and even asked for the recipe!  I was very pleased!

Though I ended up not using the low fat products, I have to say this was one of the best kugels I've had.  Made it with brisket and it was a perfect compliment.  Thanks!

We used eggs instead of egg substitute, & we've cooked it w/ & w/out the graham crackers, & we like it better without. It's too sweet with the graham crackers. We also add more raisins. We really like this kugel, and have cooked it many times. Only gave 4 stars because we didn't like it with the graham crackers.

Everyone raved about this dish.  Never made it before and it was really good!  I only used 1 cup of sugar and no raisins.  I couldn't imagine 2 cups of sugar-- it was plenty sweet.

This got a thumbs up from dh! I made the following changes as per other reviewers: 1. used 3/4c. red fat sour cream 2. reduced the sugar to 1 cup (reviewer said 1 1/4c, maybe less next time - it came out perfect this way) 3. used 3/4 c graham cracker crumbs (reviewer used 1 c.)  and added my own changes as follows: 1. used crasins instead of the rasins 2. used 6 omega-3 eggs instead of the substitute 3. used juice from half a lime (didn't have lemon juice on hand)  I also boiled the crasins with the noodles, as per a previous review, as well as put the crust mixture on top instead of below. was really yummy!

My first try at this is in the oven now, but I couldn't help reviewing it since the "pudding" tasted so good.  I made the following changes:  1 and 1/2 stick melted butter, 1/2 cup yogurt (since my husband hates sour cream), 6 real eggs, 1 1/2 cup sugar, about half of a 24oz jar of cinnamon applesauce, and added 1tsp cinnamon extract and nutmeg (along with the vanilla and lemon juice.)  Next time I will probably cut down on the sugar even more since it was still very sweet this way (but still very good.)  I forgot to add the raisins -- oops.  Next time.  Also used far more than 1/4c cracker crumbs.  I used 1 entire pouch of graham crackers that I crushed by hand.  Sprinkled about 3/4 of that on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top.  This also made a TON.  Next time I will probably half it, especially if I was just making it for a few people.  Edit:  This did not come out as well as I thought it would.  The top got very dried out and was hard to eat since the noodles got crunchy, even with the cracker crumbs on top.  It also didn't have a lot of flavor.  The "pudding" alone was quite good but with as many noodles as you use, it becomes much less flavorful.  If I make it again, I would use less noodles, more applesauce and spices, and perhaps some fresh apple slices to up the flavor.

I love this Kugel recipe!
I have made it several times.. I don't make it quite as light, but still fairly light.  I don't do the graham cracker crumbs at all.  I do sprinkle a lot of cinnamon sugar on top and it is wonderful!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I even read the recipe wrong, added twice the applesauce it called for and it still came out great!  Why not just say 8oz of applesauce instead of 1/2 of a 16oz jar?  (I used REAL butter and eggs too.)  Anyway, try this recipe it's great!

We were invited to Channukah Dinnner at our friends house.  This was our first as we are not Jewish.  So, I decided to try to make Kugel.  Our friends loved it so much they asked me to make it when we attend their Passover Dinner.

I recently became part of a Jewish family and found this recipe.  What a hit!!!  The older ladies at the synagogue said I make the best kugel they've had after tasting this and my non-Jewish family loves it, too. Thanks!

I am new at making kugels, however, I would definitely do this one a little differently next time. I would skip on the sugar. I did not add as much as the recipe called for and it was still too sweet. The applesauce and cinnamon would be enough sweetner if you are like me and not the hugest fan of sugary foods. It smelled really good!

I made this (last minute) for an office event. It was so easy and everyone loved it! Several people asked for the recipe and were thrilled to find out it was low fat! I brought the leftovers home and shared them with some Jewish friends and they loved it too.

I  have made this "full fat and calories" for the past 3 Holiday seasons.  It is by FAR..the BEST and the recipe I am  most asked for.  I use more cinnamon and a thicker graham gracker bottom.  Enjoy it!

I love this recipe, but I agree it's a little too sweet.  I cut down on the sugar by a 1/4 cup and also used "natural" (unsweetened) applesauce.  It's usually a little chunky, which adds texture.  Also, I used golden raisins that have been soaked in water so they're not so dry.  Thank you for clarifying the "1/2 (16 oz) jar applesauce" part- that was a little confusing!  I brought this to work for an international food themed party and I was getting requests for the recipe left and right!

This was just ok as far as kugels go.  Not bad but no apple taste at all.  I did reduce the sugar because we don't care for too sweet foods and it was still sweet.

This was pretty good. I thought it was more dinner recipe but it was VERY dessert style.  It was super yummie. I then substituted some butter and cream cheese for lowfat alternatives and it was still good.

Just not our cup of tea. Won't be making again. The kids' questioned what it was and only ate one piece of noodle. Not that it was horrible, it was just not that great, though I am sure some people are wowed by it.

This recipe wowed everyone at our Rosh Hashanah lunch, and I've already been asked to make it for break fast. It is officially one of our family's new traditions.

One note: the recipe was ambiguous about how much apple sauce to add, so I added 16 ounces. Also, I used lots more graham crackers, and used cinnamon ones.

I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS VERY GOOD.  I DID CUT BACK ON THE SUGAR TO 1 1/4 CUPS.  USED 1/2 C REAL BUTTER AND USED "LITE" SOUR CREAM.  AT FIRST I WAS CONFUSED ON THE APPLE SAUCE?  RECIPES SHOULD READ... 1 CUP!  ie; 8 OZ. ie; 1/2 16 0Z JAR.  OH WELL,  HAPPY COOKING!

EXCELLENT! I CUT BACK ON THE MARGARINE AND SOUR CREAM AND ADDED CREAM CHEESE IN ITS PLACE. I ALSO ADDED THE RAISINS TO THE NOODLES WHILE THEY WERE COOKING, THIS MADE THEM NICE AND SOFT AND PLUMP!I ALSO USED SPLENDA IN PLACE OF THE SUGAR, NEXT TIME I WILL CUT BACK THE "SUGAR" BY 1/2 CUP. EXCELLENT DISH FOR BRUNCH OR POT LUCK.

I made this for the first night of Hanukkah and everyone (including our non-Jewish guest) loved it!  It was a little sweeter than I would prefer so I would use less sugar when I made it again.  Overall a good dish and healthier because of the egg substitute!

My husband really liked this a lot. I thought it was a bit too sweet. We used sweetened applesauce because I had it on hand, but next time I'll try with unsweetened, and maybe less sugar. A good recipe though, held together nicely.

When I made this recipe I made a couple mistakes so I don't know how that affected the final outcome.  The one thing I did not like was how the "sauce" settled during baking so I had noodles on top that had nothing on them.  I will try this recipe again making sure I follow the recipe and try to find a way to remedy the naked noodles.

I grew up eating kugel with apples and raisins in it so to me it's comfort food, even when it isn't perfect.  In making this for the first time for my kids though, I have to say that I agree with another reviewer - we don't eat margarine, so I substituted butter - and I halved the amount called for as suggested by the same person.  1 cup does seem like a lot, but I'm not sure if cutting it affected the moistness of the kugel.  We buy only full fat dairy, so our sour cream was not fat free and I was hoping it would make up for some of the butter left out.  We used 6 eggs in place of the egg substitute, and used peeled chopped apples in place of raisins as I didn't think our kids would go for them.  I should have covered with foil the whole baking time - they didn't care for the crunch to the top noodles.  I'll try this again, but making a few tweaks for more flavor.

A lot of the comments here suggest reducing the sugar. I would say it really depends on whether you use unsweetened or "normal" (sweetened) applesauce. With unsweetened, I don't think it's necessary to reduce the sugar much. 

My modifications: 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup raisins. I just wish I hadn't cut the sugar. But overall it turned out great!

Really good and was really easy to make with my girls who are 7 and 8 since it dosen't take long to prep.   We made it for Rosh Hashanah dinner, although it is really more like desert than a dinner side.

My kids and I love this recipe - much lower in fat than many other kugel recipes.  I use 3 eggs instead of the egg substitute and leave out the raisins and graham cracker crumbs - also reduce the sugar by half.  It is fabulous and easy.  You can use low fat margarine and sour cream or regular - does not seem to matter to taste.

I lightened this up quite a bit and my husband and I just loved it. Instead of sour cream, I used skim milk. Just buttered some leftover noodles, whisked eggs, milk, sugar (half the amount called for here) vanilla, applesauce and a drop of orange extract and tossed with the noodles and added raisins.  Put everything in a greased casserole.  Instead of a graham cracker bottom, I used a cup of fresh whole wheat bread crumbs tossed with two tablespoons of melted butter which I sprinkled on top of the noodle mixture and then sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar over the top and baked at 375 for 40 min. until custard was set and the bread crumbs and edges of the noodles were slightly browned. Yummy!
