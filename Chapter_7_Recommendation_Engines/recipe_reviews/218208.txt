This definitely is a classic burger recipe. I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner tonight (didn't thaw anything) so we went out and got a pound of hamburger and fired up the grill. These were great and really hit the spot. We poured a little beer over these while they were cooking (an old trick from my Dad). Nicely seasoned and perfect for whatever toppings you might want to add. These were great on toasted sesame rolls with crisp lettuce, fresh sliced tomato, cheddar cheese, pickles, and a little ketchup (oh and a couple of beers)!

Substituted regular ground pepper.  I thought the Worcestershire sauce might be dominant, but it wasn't.  Probably the beefiest tasting hamburger I've ever grilled.

Great burger! I used lemon pepper since I wasn't sure what "seasoned pepper" was and only half the seasoned salt. This was a wonderful burger and I enjoyed it very much, it didn't even need condiments it was great on it's own.

In my mind, nothing belongs on a burger (or a steak, for that matter), except salt and pepper - unless you use this recipe.  Mrs. Spunky Buddy made me try this despite my protest.  I guess she knew I'd like everything in these burgers.  They were terrific.

Yum!  I have been making these this same way for the last 20 years or so.  Trying out new recipes is fun, but always come back to this old favorite.

I tried this twice, the first time as written.  The onions were way over the top, and didn't really have a chance to cook properly.  I used a standard sweet brown onion, and I always cook my burgers on low until they're well done.  I think if I tried a third time, I'd go for a milder variety, or saute/carmelize them before mixing them in.  The second time I substituted 1 tsp of granulated onion and it was much better, but still not quite what I was looking for.  I don't regret trying this out though because I discovered how much I LOVE seasoned pepper.  Lawry's website has a version of this recipe that omits the onions altogether, so it's just a tsp of seasoned salt and 1/2 tsp of seasoned pepper.  I think that would be more to my taste, even though I normally adore onions.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I realized that the pepper was actually seasoned pepper, which I have never heard of. I did cut the seasoned salt to 3/4 of a tsp. For the seasoned pepper, I used regular and did 1/4 tsp. I kept everything else the same. The black pepper did come off kind of strong even with the reduced amount. I broiled the burgers in broiler instead of grilling. Mine came out a tad dry. It may have been because I used lean grass fed beef. Still a rather tasty meal. ty

Excellent recipe from Lawry's.  I used 1# ground sirloin and followed the recipe as printed.  No need to substitute or add anything.  Great on the grill.  Happy Memorial Day and God bless our Vets!
