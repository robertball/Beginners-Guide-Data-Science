Easy enough to make and ideal to have on hand or to make ahead of time if you want a non-mayo Slaw and/or might not have fridge space. I thought the dressing favored the sweet as opposed to the sour side as I found the sugar to temper the sharpness of the vinegar (I happen to like vinegar so to someone else it may taste otherwise). I added half a green bell pepper which was plenty and next time will add onion too. After thawing I found the slaw surprisingly to still be crunchy even though freezing and thawing changed that of the original fresh texture, the change was not a negative.

Made this for Recipe Group...If you like slaw in any form, you're gonna LOVE this! I like that this is made and ready to go in the freezer for a quick side. I halved the recipe and used one 16oz. bag of coleslaw mix (YES, I'm lazy, lol), and that worked perfectly. The dressing is SOOOOO GOOD! Thanks, sass, this is a keeper~YUM! :)

AMAZING!  We absolutely loved this!  Hubby has to avoid green leafed vegetables so I haven't been making coleslaw.  When I saw this recipe and the fact that I could freeze it, I made it for myself in individual portions.   Hubby tried it and loved it.  I guess now I'll have to hide when I eat it to keep him healthy.   lol!  Thank you Sassy for sharing!   I wish I had tried it sooner!

REVIPE GROUP 8/20/14:  Thank you sassyoldlady for saving a better memory of my grandma.  She had her version of freezer slaw at every single meal.  As a kid, I was not thrilled but had to try a bite of everything:( When this came up on the Buzz there were three heads of cabbage in the garden so I had to give it a shot.  We are both so happy with your version.  I made a small batch and two days later made a large batch.  I thawed two half cup containers two days ago, crispy and still awesome. Thanks again!

Top notch recipe:  ingredients and method are right on.  I had some leftover cabbage (red and green) and some carrots.  I put this in the freezer and two weeks later it was crisp and delicious.  Thank you Sasyy!

This does still have a crunch to it when it comes out of the freezer. DH really liked it. It was too sweet for me though. I would have been fine with 1/4 of the sugar. I liked the method and will try it again with next summer's garden cabbage. I did add a green pepper and would add some onion next time too.

This coleslaw won't make it to the freezer.  It might not even make it to dinner as I'm standing next to the counter eating it out of the bowl right now.  I cut back on the sugar a little but otherwise made as written.  It's only been in the fridge an hour and already tastes awesome. Thanks Sassy!

Recipe Group Selection:  16, August 2014 ~ Delicious!  I'm a few weeks late in making this, but so glad I finally got it done.  I made a full batch and we ate half of it the day I made it and froze the other half.  Loved the dressing - the vinegar cuts the sweetness for a nice balance. I did add the onions and green peppers to the slaw, and will do so again. My mom used to make a freezer slaw when I was younger.  Loved it then and still do!  Thanks, sassy, for sharing your recipe.

Who knew you can freeze cole slaw?  I just opened one of the containers I froze last week and was happy with the results.  I only made half a recipe and started with a bag of cole slaw mix, followed the recipe as written.  I tasted it several hours after I made it and it was good, a week plus later after freezing it is still good.  The dressing is a bit sweet for my taste but the family thought it is fine.  Thank you, Sassy!

Sassy, thank you for sharing this recipe! Loved it! How wonderful to have this available anytime! For some reason, I think cole slaw (dressing) is a pain to make each time I want it and can't tell you how many half bags of slaw I have found in the back of the fridge and tossed. Problems solved! DD doesn't like mayo, so she loved it, too. We were all pleasantly surprised the crunch is still there after freezing.  Followed the recipe exactly. Finished what was in the freezer and will reload this week!

Yummy salad.  I had left a small batch in the fridge for dinner tonight.  The salad was able to sit for a couple of hours.  LOL was only able to get small taste but it was ohh so good.  Thank you sassyoldlady for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Sassy, I loved this slaw!  I only made a half a batch to use what ingredients I had on hand. The only change I may make next time is to hand shred my veggies in lieu of using the food processor, as it shredded them too small for my liking.  Thanks for the recipe, Sassy!

I just put this in the freezer. I nibbled a bit and I love the dressing!  I like the mustard powder in there - it helps off-set the sweetness.  I did add a little onion to the slaw. A few of the containers I used will be great for just grabbing for lunch.  Can't wait!

Made for Recipe Group 8/17/2014.  Back in the '70's I made a simalar salad that we all loved.  I thought this was better than I remembered perhaps as the one way back when had green bell pepper in it.  Thank you Sassy for a delicious salad that can be made ahead and is always good.

Since my preference is for less sweet-more tangy slaw, I only used one cup of sugar and added chopped red onion, everything else the same. So tasty!

I made this recipe exactly to the instructions.  The texture was very good, nice and crunchy, but it was a bit too sweet and didn't have that nice vinegar bite.  I love it that I can just pull it out of the freezer and there's an almost instant vegetable for dinner.  Well worth trying, but I might tweak the sugar content if I made it again.
