My husband and I LOVED this!  It was so yummy!!  I personally don't like spare ribs, so next time I make it I think I will use a pork roast sliced or something, but the flavor was phenomenal!!  I made it with Coconut Jasmine Rice and it was a wonderful accompaniment to the dish!!  I will definately make this one again, it made me feel like a gourmet chef! ;o)

This is really delicious. I suggest you stick to the oranges. I made a mistake of substituting them on the second batch I made. It was such a hit! I made this with beef chucks and they tasted even better.

Wonderful.  I admit I was rather dubious about the large quantity of spices (note for the reviewer who gave 1 star, a stick of cinnamon is usually 2-3 inches long), but it came out great.  I was short on star anise so I added a tsp of five spice powder, and I also added the grated zest of an orange to the marinade and used beef broth instead of water.  Everyone raved!  It's great there's such a relatively fast spare rib recipe!

Amazing!!!! I used pork country style ribs. They came out incredibly tender and the flavor was spectacular. Thanks for a great recipe, we'll be making these again!

My boyfriend and I loved this dish, I cooked this lastnight. I don't have cinnamon sticks so I just used the powder form. I don't have star anise so I used five spice powder as substitute. This is a very good dish. You should all try it..

Was a disaster for. Got the idea but in future I would rather know how long a stick of cinnamon is for instance. I put 5, 12 cm long sticks and turned out to be a disaster. I had more orange juice left. The quantities in the recipe do not tie up with usage when cooking.

This is a really great recipe! Its so tender and flavorful! Sadly I didnt have any star anise, so I had to leave it out. I also only did 4 sticks of cinnamon because that is all I had. It still came out fabulous! YUMM! Thanks

I prefer bbq ribs but these were very very good... my husband on the other hand said :  These are the best ribs I have ever tasted, my mom would love these too !!  Which, for a very picky eater is saying quite a lot.  Will do again, of course !

Excellent Spare Rib recipe! The ribs and the sauce went great together! Fall off the bone tender. Flavors seemed exteremly intense during preparation, so I was aprehensive about the final result. I was very pleasently surprised, my husband, almost  2 and 3 year old loved them. Paired with a coconut rice following another reviewers suggestion, a very nice meal.

We made twice the ribs in the same amount of sauce and only used 3 cinnamon sticks. we thought these came out wonderfully. We had them with the Mediteranean Couscous and it was a great combination. My three year old daughter even loved them.

I didn't have any star anise so I just left it out and my boyfriend  doesn't like cinnamon and I left that out as well- it turned out wonderful.  The only thing different I did was fry it a little bit longer so I can cut down on the simmering time.

I made this for my daughter, who is both a great fan of spare ribs and a discerning diner (with crusty wedges as a side). I didn't have enough oranges, so I juiced 4 apples and used juice of 1 orange. I didn't have either the anise or sticks of cinnamon, so I used 1Tbsp ground cinnamon:1stick and I used a combination of tarragon, basil, rosemary and ground peppercorn to replace the anise. Turned out wonderfully. My daughter says it even tops the spare ribs at the steakhouse we eat at!

There is a review posted under my name that I didnâ€™t post!  We loved this unusual dish. Changes: country style ribs, fresh orange juice, 1 c bone broth instead of water. Organic Coconut Aminos for soy. No star anise or sugar used.  Meat was tender and delicious!  Served with

I liked the flavor of the cinnamon and anise.  It definitely gave it a different flair that I have not had in other dishes.  The ribs were not as tender as was promised, but we might have needed to cook it at a higher temperature.  I'm not faulting the recipe on that.  The flavor was good, but not something that would make it stand out from other similar recipes.

I would still give recipe 5 star as it was delicious, except for the Anise (which I am not a fan of) that I omitted. Thanks

I've been waiting awhile to make something that made me say "Oh, wow - now that is GOOOOOD!!" This is it! Like others, I used Chinese 5 spice in place of star anise, but also had only pineapple/orange juice, so I used that too. I love spicy, so added asian chili paste (about a tsp)to the marinade. Had fresh ginger - put a piece about an inch long in marinade as well. Marinaded overnight, when I finally cooked them in the broth - what an incredible smell! Made coconut rice too. Came out a little sticky, think I used too much liquid. I reduced the cooking broth, poured a little over the meat/rice. Could eat a whole lb of meat cooked like this! Easy, too. A must try.(Oh, pat dry w/paper towels the meat before frying or it splatters like crazy.)

Has an interesting taste, meat came out moist and not too fatty.
