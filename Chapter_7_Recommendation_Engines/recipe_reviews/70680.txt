This is absolutely fantastic!  BUT - there's no way there's enough sauce to hande three layers of noodles.  It needs at least half again as much sauce if not twice the amount of sauce.  I ended up adding a couple tablespoons of heavy cream between the layers and only used two layers of noodles.  The flavor is amazing, though!!!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good and different from the norm. Made some changes to this one, I used all Mozz instead of cheddar, used around two jars of alfredo sauce, mixed in a can of diced tomatoes drained and a can of mushrooms drained to the ricotta mixture. YUMMY!

Excellent, although you may need to add more milk or cream to the sauce to keep the noodles moist enough.  I also added roasted red peppers, which were tasty.

I used regular lasagna noodles and soaked them in hot water for about 15-20 minutes. I had cottage cheese (16 oz.) so I used that instead of ricotta.  This is really good with added fresh mushrooms (saute in a little butter,  garlic & a pinch of salt). I also doubled the cheese on top. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Good, like another reviewer said, the jarred sauce in combination with the sausage was fairly salty. I did change the recipe based on others' reviews. I used turkey Italian sausage. I also sauteed sliced button and cremini mushrooms, minced garlic and mixed them with the sausage and alfredo sauce. Instead of extra jarred sauce, I used an equal amount of milk and 1 TB unsalted butter/flour roux.

I also replaced the Cheddar with mozz and I used fresh spinach, wilted, squeezed of water and chopped, mixed in with the cheeses.

I baked 35 min with the foil on, 10 min with the foil off to brown the cheese on top.

Because of the saltiness, I think next time, I'll use 1/2 sausage 1/2 ground beef or turkey. Also, I'll add a little ground nutmeg to the alfredo...

this is really yummy, I added a second jar of alfredo sauce and a little more sausage because I had some extra, and used about 5oz of fresh spinach.

Wow! this was incredible! I can't say enough about the heavenly taste!. The cheese mixture did not cover evrything, but cheese melts. I just tried to evenly distribute the mixture and it came out perfect. I followed the recipe except that I bought mushroom alfredo sauce. Yum! Next time I may add some canned mushrooms. AMAZING flavor!!

This is so good!  My SO and I both really don't like tomato sauce, so we tried this!  I cut the sausage amount in half, added 1/2 pound of lean ground beef and 8 fresh spinach instead of the frozen.  I doubled the amount of the Alfredo sauce.  Next time I will add a small amount of sauteed onion and garlic.

I'll give this one 5 stars but I made many modifications.  I used a 9x9 pan but DID NOT half the recipe.  I used 1/2 lb sausage and 1/2 lb ground turkey which i cooked with some fresh minced garlic (1-2 cloves) and some sliced onion as well as salt, pepper, and some italian seasoning.  I used a premade alfredo sauce (which was very salty) and added a clove of garlic to that.  I totally forgot to thaw the spinach so i cooked it in the microwave and just added it to the meat mixture which was already put aside in a bowl.  I too omitted the cheddar and just used a mixed italian cheese.  Had no problem with it drying out, recommend reserving some alfredo sauce for the top layer--just enough for a thin layer.  Nice job!

I did add spices as I cooked and used 2 jars of alfredo. I didn't have enough of the ricotta mixture (made with mozzarella instead of cheddar) for 3 layers.

So easy and delicious.  I used all mozzarella cheese and browned the sausage with some minced garlic.  I ended up using 1.5 jars of Alfredo and baking for an hour.  My very picky husband said it was best lasagna ever!

After reading many reviews and because we like a very saucy lasagna, I used an extra can of alfredo sauce and 16 oz of thawed chopped frozen spinach. I also used a three-cheese blend for the cheese portion (instead of just cheddar or mozzarella), but I think you can go with almost any cheese you like, and it would be fine. We used a local sausage that we took out of its casing and sauteed. I also added 8 oz sauteed chopped mushrooms to the alfredo sauce and some extra seasonings (garlic powder, hot pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, etc.). I used the no-bake lasagna noodles - they are a godsend, very easy to use and taste just as good as the precook ones. Overall, this was a GREAT lasagna and made enough to feed six adults with leftover. Everyone raved about it; it's a keeper.

My family really likes this.  Try sauteeeing onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms and adding to sausage, spinach and alfredo sauce misture.  I usually double the alfredo sause.  Make it a day ahead.  Add extra milk/cream, if necessary.  Watch the oven so it doesn't dry out.

This was ok...I am not sure what overwhelmed me about it. I think I would skip the cheddar (and only use 1 cup as suggested by others) and just do the mozzerella instead.  I also added a minced clove of garlic to my sausage...yummy.  This is for SURE a filling meal!!!

This turned out great!  However it only needs 3/4 pkg of a 9oz box of no-boil lasagna noodles, not 16oz like recipe said.  I used a 14oz tube of veggie sausage to make it vegetarian.  And I used a jar of the sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce.  Very flavorful.. and my 8yr old loved it too (3 helpings!).

This recipe was awesome!!!  My husband said this is a keeper and that I need to make this again soon.  I made this with a jar of mushroom Alfredo and Garlic Alfredo.  I also used mild Italian sausage.  For the last 20 minutes I let it bake uncovered so that the cheese will brown.  I was really surprised at just how amazing this really was!

Super change of pace.  Really good flavor.  I know that I love sausage and others in my family like chicken.  So half was with the sausage and the other half was cut up grilled chicken breast.  Both were excellent.  Instead of the jar of alfredo, I used the allrecipes "Quick and Easy Alfredo recipe".  Both recipes make a super recipe.  Thanks for a great meal.

I love cooking this... I'm not a fan of red sauce due to the heartburn I get from the tomatoes so, this is perfect for me.  My friends and I get together at least once a month for cook night and this is our favorite dish to cook together. I have made this at lease a half a dozen times and it's never failed me!

This was great. Very different approach to lasagna, but very good. All I can comment on is that this recipe doesnt seem to make enough white sauce to fill the entire lasagna- i got to the 2nd layer and was already running out. I will definately double it next time. If you use spicy italian sausage and add some seasoning  to the white mixture (parsley,garlic salt,nutmeg, and oregano) this tastes awesome!

This was delicious!!A real hit in my house. This is a great basic recipe for spinach alfredo lasagna. I think the next time I make this I may even use chicken for a different kick. I followed the recipe almost to the t... except I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions and garlic and then added to my jarred Alfredo sauce with fresh spinach not frozen..... I also used two jars of the Alfredo sauce I used ragu parmesan light I think.... I had in the cupboard....I also added a bit of white wine to my sauce and one can diced tomatoes. I used part skim ricotta and mixed with mozzarella and sharp cheese and parmesan cheeses. I also used reg lasagna noodles as I didn't have enough left of the no boil lasagna. I made enough to fill a foil lasagna pan (deep) and I made it yesterday and there is about 2 squares left!!! usually I have a lot more left over when I make my regualar lasgna!! I also used a garlic cheese sausage that I get from my local butcher. This is a keeper and will go in my reg rotation of recipes... thanx Jobarbara for posting!!

This was very good...I added portabellas and next time I think I am going to cook the noodles instead of no boils. I also will use a little more sauce than what is called for.  Other than that this was a fabulous recipe.

Hubby raved about this tonight after his initial sniff about non-traditional lasagne.  I doubled the meat using 2 lbs of spicy italian sausage, doubled the spinach, doubled the alfredo sauce as well adding another equal jar of milk.  I also added 1 tbls of minced garlic to the meat mixture. Otherwise made this as directed.  It was a little dicey having enough sauce to do all three layers but I managed and this came out very tasty.  Enough for 2 meals and possibly one lunch bag portion. Thanks for sharing this, I'll be making this often.

This was really good, the only thing I would change is to add more spinach but that's probably personal opinion. I made my own Alfredo sauce too, which made it soo good.

So I made this recipe tonight, and as always I read through the reviews first, so I used two jars of Alfredo, I also used fresh spinach, I added sliced mushrooms and artichoke hearts to the sauce. I used a motz parm cheese mix and topped with diced tomatoes. DELISH!!! Will definitely make again!!!

Perfect. A family favorite. Definitely very cheesy so be prepared if you're lactose intolerant. But definitely going to make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.   He is not a big fan of ricotta cheese so I only did one layer of that mixture.  I might try to use all mozzarella next time instead of cheddar.  I think this meal has potential for MANY variations!  Excited to try it again, add and alter a few ingredients! Thank you for the recipe!

Super delicious!!! I agree with other reviewers that the originally recipe doesn't make enough sauce. The second time I made this I added a second jar of Alfredo sauce, and used another pound of sausage and it was MUCH better. I also used a 10oz bag of fresh spinach and sautéed it in some garlic and then added it to the alfredo/sausage mixture. Super tasty!

I used 2 jars of sauce (1/2 wasn't added to the mixture, just used on the sides to cover the noodles).  This was fantastic and the leftovers were even better!

Fantastic!  I used homemade alfredo sauce and added some sun dried tomotoes.  Also used fresh spinach rather than frozen and just threw it into the sauce.  This was awesome!! Add more garlic! :)

Loved the recipe... Really great flavor.  I'm not sure if the amount of no boil lasagne was a typo....  I made a 9x13 pan consisting of 3 layers and only needed slightly less than an 8 oz package of pasta instead of 16 oz.  I was afraid that the cheddar might come out too stringy so I used Monterey Jack instead.  I cooked my sausage with some onions and crushed garlic. I doubled the Alfredo sauce and added artichoke hearts.  Might add some sun dried tomatos next time.  Will definately make again

This was a TOTAL CROWD PLEASER.  I used 2 jars of alfredo sauce and an undrained can of diced tomatoes with sweet onions, and it turned out great.  Great make-ahead choice for special dinner and it was VERY filling so there were lots of leftovers.  YUM!!!

This turned out great! I did as other reviewers recommended and used mozzarella in place of the cheddar cheese, and added an extra half jar of alfredo sauce.  I had several ask for the recipe.

Flavor is good, but definitely needs extra sauce. I made it as written, except for the addition of fresh sauteed mushrooms & I soaked my oven-ready noodles in hot water for 20 mins ahead of time. The noodles were done, but overall it was much too dry - especially the top. We still enjoyed it with bottled marinara on top to moisten (didn't have any more alfredo), but I would double the alfredo and add extra cheese. A layer of sauce for the top would be better, too.

Being an amateur cook and all, I couldn't believe I pulled this off!  I used 1/2 lean ground meat and 1/2 hot sausage, added mushrooms and onions to the meat while cooking, cut the cheddar cheeese to about a cup, and added half a can of diced tomatoes with garlic to the cheese mixture.  I also used cottage instead of ricotta cheese and waited 'till last 15 mins. to add the mozz. on top.  It was ready in just an hour, too.  I highly recommend the diced tomatoes, I wish I would've put the whole can in.  If I can make it, anyone can.  Don't forget to season the meat well when cooking!

Great tasting recipe for an alternative to traditional tomatoe sauce based lasagne! My husband dosn't like tomatoe sauce, so I am always looking for a good white sauce recipe. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the no bake noodles. I have made this reciped twice and it was great both times and my family loved it. The first time I used the no bake noodles, and they came out tough and hard to eat! They weren't soft like regular lasagne noodles after cooking. Couldn't even hardly break them with a fork. So I made it again with regular lasagne noodles. Cooked them per package direction then added them to the reciped. I also sauted some onions and fresh mushrooms into the sausage when it was partially cooked through and this just added to the great flavorful recipe. Using regular noodles vs the no bake makes this a 5 star recipe!

Seems like it needs more sauce. I should have probably tried adding milk or cream as suggested.  Okay, but didn't wow me.

This recipe is very good!  I did cut back on the cheddar cheese and use an italian blend instead and I added garlic and some italian spices to the ricotta mixture to spice it up.  Very good! This recipe is great cut in half.

The alfredo sauce with the spinach and sausage had a nice flavor-may try that over pasta.

Great dish but it needs more sauce. I added more Alfredo sauce but I still ended up short on the layers. I had to top the last noodles with just mozzarella.

We will definitely make this again. We did alter the recipe a couple of different ways. 
We added a pound of lean hamburger. We also used fresh spinach. Beware, when you measure out 10 oz. of spinach that looks like a lot of spinach.  But as you cook it through with the meat and alfredo sauce it does go to what it should be. I did remove the stems on the spinach and washed it thoroughly. And shook it dry.  
As another person said with three layers of noodles it does need more liquid. We used two jars of alfredo sauce and it still was slightly dry. Next time we will use three. 
We also like our cheese. So the cheddar I used about half again as much and we put the mozzarella on all three layers. Because we added the extra hamburger and sauce we went to a larger pan instead of the 9x13. We also “tented” the foil when we put it in the oven to keep it more moist and that did work.

The basic recipe is very good, but I did also as others have said made some tweaks. I know it annoys some people, reviewing a recipe when you’ve changed it. But like I said, the basic recipe is delicious. The things I changed, I used a 9 x 9 pan, personal preference I don’t like ricotta so I used cottage cheese, mozzarella instead of cheddar. Finally the first time I made it it was too salty, so the second time I added milk and to the Alfredo

Based on others feedback, I doubled the alfredo sauce. It turned out really well but I  think next time I'll substitute 1/2 the amount of cheddar with mozzarella. I like the stringy-ness!

This was absolutely amazing! I realize that some people may not like a very saucy pasta dish, but my husband and I really do so I just added about 3/4 of another jar of alfredo-it was just right. We cannot stand ricotta so I subbed out a sour cream part cream cheese mixture with egg and cheddar cheese along with some parm. It works perfectly for this dish. My husband ate two huge slices of lasagna and it was even better for left overs today. This was such a great recipe and I thank you for sharing with us!!

My family loved it!  I used mild Italian sausage and cottage cheese instead of ricotta since I forgot to buy it.  Definitely extra Alfredo as others mentioned....I used 2 jars.  My son said to keep this recipe in the rotation!

As mentioned before, there wasn't enough sauce for 3 layers, but it still turned out good with a little extra mozzarella.

I made it just as the recipe directed. It was excellent but was missing a few thing for my taste.  Next time I plan to sauté onions, garlic and mushrooms to add to the spinach mixture.

Delicious. I added an additional jar of Alfredo sauce and 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes. The sweetness of tomatoes complimented the savory sausage and cheese very well.

This lasagna sounded like a good healthier alternative for someone who doesn't like ricotta! I used fresh homemade whole wheat pasta, and fresh spinach. However, as others said, the Alfredo with cheese and sausage was just too salty. If I were to make this again, I would probably just use red sauce, and light light cheese.

Great recipe. I did part ground beef/ part sausage and sautéed onion, shallot and garlic with the meat. Agree that the recipe needs more sauce than called for. I also prefer for the bottom layer to start with noodles. The jar sauce is salty so no need for extra salt. I also added ratatouille seasoning and spooned vodka sauce on the top layer. Delish!

This was a delicious hit with everyone! I added a can of extra sauce, like so many reviewers suggested. I loved the spiciness in this, it was just right. I will save and make this many times.

I added onions, mushrooms, and a cup more sauce. This recipe was so delicious, my grandson (who hates spinach) took two additional servings!

Even our 3 year old liked it - used Ragu alfredo with garlic and parmesan sauce. Changes - I added 3/4 cup chicken broth to the sauce, substituted italian sweet sausage, and used sliced cheddar on top instead of mixed in with the other cheeses.

My first time making any kind of lasagna.  It turned out wonderful.  My 12 y-o picky eater ate 3 helpings.  Leftover were demolished by lunch the next day.  I used regular sausage and I think sliced or chopped mushroom would be a yummy addition.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Pretty good!  Makes a lot and was hard to fit all the noodles in and still fit in a 9 x 13 dish.  I did substitute the Italian mixed cheese for the cheddar.  Cheddar just doesn't seem to fit right with Italian food.  Also used a jar & 1/2 of Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo Sauce.  Will probably make again sometime, but pretty high in fat and calories to eat very often.

Great recipe!  I did not have lasagna noodles, so I cooked 3 (dry) cups of macaroni and layered.  I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I baked about 35 minutes.  Even my picky eater loved this and went back for seconds!

The only thing I did differently was to use fresh spinach. I also threw in some diced onion as I was browning the sausage. This was good but not quite as good as regular beef/marinara lasagna. Thanks!

My son doesn't like red sauce so I made this lasagna as an alternative for him. I actually prefer it! I add lots of shredded veggies (carrots, zucchini, whatever I have on hand). It's terrific!

I made this for my parents, and it is now my mom's favorite dish!  I usually substitute reduced-fat varieties of the cheese and sauce, but the dish still turns out great.  I also recommend the minced garlic.

This was good.  I did soak the oven ready noodles in hot water for half an hour, used only 2 cups of an Italian cheese blend (1c. mixed with the cottage cheese instead of ricotta mixture, 1c for the top), added milk to the sausage/spinach/alfredo mixture, and when it was all assembled, I poured a little more milk around the outside.  It held together perfectly, the noodles were done, and the taste was wonderful!
