I’m not a food science whiz but I’ve been baking a long time and I recognized some things in this recipe of concern.  So I made some changes and ended up with a darn good vanilla cupcake.  First, the baking soda - and no baking powder.  Baking soda typically is used when there’s something acidic in the batter like chocolate or buttermilk but there is none here.  Also, baking soda is 4 times as powerful as baking powder so why so much?  If some reviewers complained of an off taste or if their cupcakes were crumbly and coarse too much baking soda could be the problem.  I eliminated it entirely, substituting  1-1/2 tsp. of baking powder instead.  Others reported these were dry – they might have over baked them, but I’m thinking 5 T. of butter wasn’t enough – I increased it to 1/2 cup.  As for technique, I didn’t trust the instructions to heat the milk and butter.  I used a traditional creaming method instead – cream the butter and sugar together till light and fluffy, add the eggs one at a time, blending well after each; add the vanilla.  Add the dry ingredients, in thirds, alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour.  Finally, still others mentioned a flat taste – I added 1/4 tsp. of salt rather than just a pinch, and 1-1/2 tsp. of vanilla. As I mixed up the batter I found it needed another 1/4 c. of flour.  The cupcakes rose nicely, had great flavor, and were moist with a light and tender crumb.  So, some problems as written, perfect with some tweaks.

I really liked these cupcakes. I doubled the recipe and got about 30 cupcakes (the cupcake cups were only filled halfway). I also put a piece of chocolate in the middle of each cupcake right before baking, because we are not very much into plain cupcakes :-) When I tasted a cupcake right from the oven, it did taste a little eggy (but perhaps I was just looking for this taste...) but once the cupcakes have cooled, they are perfect - moist and sort of fluffy at the same time. I think this is a perfect recipe for a basic cupcake batter and I can imagine all the variations for the creative folks - citrus flavour, cocoa/chocolate, coffee...

I made these and I wasn't thrilled.  I thought they were chewy and not as flavorful as I expected I guess.  Sorry!

Very tasty, moist and highly adaptable. This recipe will produce a very loose dough, perhaps more loose then some bakers are used to. Don't be tempted to reduce the liquids though or you will end up with a chewy sponge.

I am  not a cupcake fan and I never really make cupcakes so I thought for sure these would be flop.  But I was totally wrong. These were great.  Yes, they are a little more dense so if you are looking for a light treat, this is not it.  But these were not only delicious they came out looking so professional!  I even used tub margarine instead of butter and was not really exact with my TBSP and they still turned out amazing.  Also, just like what the other posters said don't be nervous about the consistency of the batter.  It is suppose to be thin.
These are by far the best cupcakes I have made and I think they rate right up there with some professional varieties. These are also great for bake sales because they look so pretty and are great with any icing.   Yuuummmmy!

These were really really disappointing.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They had a funny almost bitter aftertaste and the texture was not good.  The only edible parts were those covered in frosting (I used Caroline's chocolate fudge frosting from this site).  No one finished theirs, not even my kids (who are usually licking up the last cupcake crumbs).  They did look pretty and domed nicely, but that is the only compliment I have for them.  :(  **ETA:  for some reason, these tasted significantly better when they were 2 and 3 days old than on the first day.  They still didn't compare favorably to some other cupcake recipes we have tried recently, but I'm upgrading them to 3 stars now.

I have made these several times using the exact recipe given and every time they turn out perfect. I too was skeptical of the thin batter but pleasently suprised how they turned out and they are not bland at all, I even ate some with no frosting! They are perfect to whip up for a real quick home-made dessert.

Very different mixture- I was afraid the cupcakes would be flat because the batter was very thin- but they were springy and moist.

When it says "best ever" you'd think they'd be at least average. These cupcakes are very bland. An instant mix is better then these.

I used this recipe to make mini cupcakes, and I've never made cupcakes from scratch before, so to me this was a very basic cupcake to start with. Very easy, although at first I thought the batter looked pretty sketchy because of how thin it was. The cook time was halved making minis. They have a very spongey texture and a light flavor, I suppose if you increased the vanilla they might have more flavor. Basically a beginner cup cake.

These were amazing!  I actually used the servings calculator and halved the recipe.  My family thought they were amazing too!  I saved this to make again.  My mom wished I could use this to make my sister's wedding cake in a month!

I made these with the suggested changes from Naples34102 plus a chunk of chocolate in the middle. They turned out great...not too sweet. Something easy to make for school!! I didn't melt or heat anything...creamed butter and sugar, then added eggs vanilla and milk, stirred in dry ingredients and then blended for less than a minute. Definitely in my recipe box. Easy and tasty!

My whole fam loved this recipe, it was so delish! 
It goes really well with Aunt Mary's Vanilla Frosting! 
This would be great for parties, I am totally making these again! They were great! Yummy!
I did a double recipe, which yielded a little less than
24 normal cupcakes. I also used 4 teaspoons of
Vanilla Extract, And cooked for 17 minutes. 
This is a great crowd-pleaser, and makes a great treat for all ages! I would make it again, espicially at a Football Party.

This was delicious, even as a low-carb recipe.  I altered it for my diabetic daughter, using almond flour and stevia in the raw (6 Tb).  1/4 cup extra flour and 1 extra egg yolk.. it was super moist and only 5 gm per cupcake!!

I enjoyed the flavor of these cupcakes very much and so did my picky 19yo son and his buddy. Before they went skateboarding I handed them both one. :) 

As for the ingredients/batter. I added a splash more of vanilla because I love the vanilla flavor, also I only use nonfat milk so I was worried the batter would be too loose, I added approx 3-4 TBSP more of flour and they were perfect! I will hesitate to ever use a box mix simply for convenience again... This was easy and simple with all ingredients on hand! 

GOOD JOB!!!

This is a good basic recipe - I didn't have any paper baking cups so I used foil and they were definitely done baking after 13-15 minutes. I also didn't use all of the milk/butter mixture as the batter was so runny (I left out about 1/4 cup), but the consistency of the cooled cupcakes is perfect!

I'm an excellent baker and had the worst time w/this recipe. The thin batter over ran my holders and spilled onto my oven floor. They were not over filled as 4 out of the batch came out just fine, but the other 8 did not. I blame the batter..my oven temperature is correct and even all around each side. I wasted my ingredients and had even added vanilla bean to the mix so i was not pleased!

I don't understand how you can all be so picky. I thought the recipe was great. It's a good standard recipe that doesn't have tons of flavor so you can be creative and make it your own. Not too "eggy" if you want to give it a fake word. Good job Princess, and thank you.

I doubled the recipe using the calculater for my daughter birthday snack for preschool.  It was a little sweet once I added the frosting for me, but not for children.  I also added a touch more vanilla just because I do that with anything calling for vanilla because I love vanilla and because people said it tasted eggy so I was trying to avoid that.  I saw some people had problems with this recipe and was afraid I would too, but it turned out great.  Next time I'll stick to the vanilla amount because I can't take too sweet stuff anymore.  Anyway, I loved it.  I'll hear back from the teacher tomorrow how the class liked it, but they tasted great to me.  I also got 30 cupcakes from it.

I am not sure what other reviewers have done but mine turned out so well and I followed the recipe.  It is moist and tasty. I just added plenty of vanilla so it would smell and taste like vanilla cup cake.  The batter was runny but I do not see any issue with it as the end result is great.

These turned out delicious, but stuck to the cupcake liners, and fell right after coming out of the oven. Any ideas how to avoid this?

They are not fluffy at all! They are dense and bread like. Very upsetting considering this is the first time I made them from scratch followed the recipe perfectly. They need more baking soda or something to lift them up. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!

These cupcakes are delicious! I like them because they aren't too sweet but the sweetness of icing balances it out. I think it has really good flavor, but I added extra vanilla. :)

These turned out perfectly! I DO need to add, that I followed naples34102's advice.  I switched the recipe up with their tweaks and honestly it was perfect! And soooo easy! My first batch of homemade cupcakes and for the first time, my almost 6 yr old daughter ate the ENTIRE thing WITHOUT icing on them.  She loved them.  So thanks.  This worked out perfectly!

I have used this recipe many times over and every time the cupcakes come out beautiful.  I have altered the recipe (flavor wise)and all my cakes have come out great. The only thing I change is the number of egg yolks.  I always use one less than the recipe calls for. I also use vanilla bean paste instead of extract as the flecks of vanilla look really pretty in the cupcakes.

This is definitly the best vanilla cupcake ever!!! I am very surprised it only got a 3 and a half star rating.  Then batter was runnier then I am used to, but the cupcakes turned out great.  I recommend filing them with raspberry jam...yum!!!

They rose well but had a bitter aftertaste. I notice another reader remarked that also.

Update - I made this again with the recipe altered. I added 25% more butter and added a tablespoon of buttermilk. I think the buttermilk neutralised the baking soda and there was no bitter aftertaste. 

it tasted ok. However it doesnt have the richness of some cupcakes. I prefer them more dense and moist.

However I will still try this recipe - The best thing I liked about this recipe is that the cupcake rose well and had a nice puffy finish to it.

I asked allrecipes.com to calculate this down to 6 cupcakes and now I'm sorry I did. I may have to make another batch, especially considering how much frosting I made up to go with them. When they were baking I could really smell the egg, but these turned out light and fluffy and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, though I may have gone a teeny bit overboard with the vanilla, and they're just scrumptious.

these are moist, but they're bland. they're more white cupcakes, than vanilla. if you want vanilla cupcakes, i'd follow the recipe, but add more vanilla into the mix.

The batter was very thin, but when it was baked it looked perfect. We tried them and it was very bland, in the future I would have put a little bit more of vannila/sugar. It is a good cupcake for begineers who always baked from boxes.

I love these cupcakes. I did a test run because I didn't want to send a bunch of unworthy cupcakes to an Air Force Luncheon. They are thick and fluffy, Icing isn't needed but I think it would make them perfect. Thank you for the recipe!!

I followed all of NAPLES34102's suggestions for this recipe and was very pleased. My first attempt at homemade cupcakes & these were great. Made them for a coworker's birthday & got rave reviews. I topped it with Pioneer Woman's Frosting that will Get you Hugs. I did find the texture to be on the coarser, crumbly side, rather than that super soft, moist texture I'd expected but I chalked that up to possibly over baking. When I asked if they seemed dry, my very brutally honest friend told me not at all so maybe I'm just being nitpicky. I will def use this recipe again!

Using the tips from "Naples" these turned out great, I doubled the recipe, and made half vanilla and half chocolate by adding 1/2 c cocoa powder to the finished batter and mixing really well. It made a little less than 30 cupcakes.

I just made these cupcakes and followed naples34102's suggestions to a tee. Oh boy were these cupcakes ever GOOD! I can't even imagine how they would have tasted had i not followed her advice and followed the original recipe. They were perfect. Added some chocolate frosting and sprinkles. YUM! naples34102 thank you thank you thank you!!!

Mine was very much like a liquid so I had to have some more flour and there were some errors in this recipe I think you should re think this recipe.

The best recipe ever! My birthday is December 19th and I am doing a baking party and I am using this recipe in this way: Take out the vanilla extract and some flour, add 2 Tbls peanut butter, and fill it with jelly: PB&J!
I made this recipe before, too, and it was really good plain. YUMMSTERS!

I made these today, just as the recipe says. The only modification I made was substituting a 1/4 cup of plain flour for a 1/4 cup of coconut flour. Due to the fibre content in the coconut flour I added about 2 tbsp of solid coconut oil to the milk and butter melting, then completed the rest of the recipe as instructed.  OMG!!!! So freaking yummy!!! The texture is perfect, the density and lightness are balanced perfectly, the rise is good enough,  the taste is delicious!!! Now i just have to decide what to frost them with for my daughter's 5th birthday party!

I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a simple recipe, but I always read the reviews first. And I tweaked it as Naples34102 advised. They were perfect. My 8 year old cousin just loved them. I added crushed Reese's Pieces and topped it with home made whipped cream. It was a huge hit with everyone. Thanks for this simple recipe and thanks to Naples34102

The cakes came out with a nice little evenly rounded top, were a light golden brown and the flavor is great. I and my husband really like them. 

I made a mistake when following the recipe, instead of an extra yolk,, I used the white of the egg and I put in 2 tsps vanilla and 1 added tablespoon of flour, since I bake in a high altitude.

I made these cupcakes for my daughter and her friends in school and although they r picky eater they loved these cupcakes. I found it moist and tender and filled with taste. I didn't make it exactly as the recipe requires instead I creamed butter and sugar together then added three whole eggs then flour and milk alternating and they were amazing. The comment I heard from those 7year old girls made me wanna cry. They said it was the best cupcakes they ever had.

When I prepared the recipe, the batter had a very strong egg smell. Was leery of the outcome. After placing butter cream icing and eating the next day, they were really good. No egg taste.  Took them to a party & everyone raved about them!  One person even asked where I got the recipe. Told her & she immediately placed inn her recipe box.

I like this recipe, made it twice...easy and quick to make. But, the consistency of the cupcake is not very "cakey"...It is almost spongey and egg-y. I decided to make them a second time, as I thought maybe I had made a mistake last time. They are tasty though, my kids loved them and gobbled them down...I was just hoping for more of a bakery cupcake.

Pretty Good, I double the vanilla, and take out the extra egg yolk, i find the extra egg makes it very dense, and more like a pound cake.

Delicious! I used this recipe twice and the cupcakes were just perfect both times, and everyone loved them. Very soft and the perfect balance of sweetness and flavor. I, like other people who have reviews the cupcakes, were worried the cupcakes wouldn't come out as the batter is very thin, but they came out perfect.

These were VERY moist, not the best. Not  really cupcakes more muffins, i cut a hole in the middle and put jelly in it that made it palatable, other wise it would stick to the roof of my mouth... I made it once again and it's still to moist, I will not make them again

It tasted alright but it had a very chewy consistency.The wrappers were difficult to peel off, so much so that when you did you left little shreds of paper stuck to the cupcake.

I followed the recipe almost exactly... Only thing I changed was I used 2.5tsp of vanilla instead of 1. Very yummy, although they're a little flat instead of domed.

I made this twice, exactly as written. I thought they were very nice, but maybe not perfect. One batch tested done (the toothpick test) at 18 minutes, and the second one I checked at 17 and it was still done. They came out firm enough, maybe a little too moist for my taste, though. I frosted them with "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" (also on this website). I left a dozen in a lunchroom for some friends - they were all eaten, but I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I'll give this recipe 4 stars myself.

Overall, this is very good! I also added a piece of chocolate into the middle when it was about halfway through baking. I agree with the other reviews in that it is slightly too eggy.

When I was reading the other reviews I thought that they didn't follow the directions for the recipe. But when I made them they didnt exactly taste like they were suppose to, so im upgrading these to a 3.

this batter was way too thin and the first batch of 6 didn't rise at all and I took it out of the oven after leaving it in for double the time and it still came out with liquid centers. i adjusted the remaining batter with 2/3 cup more flour and 1/3 cup more sugar and a pinch more baking soda and about 1/3 teaspoon more vanilla and it finally tasted like cake batter should.  I do not like this recipe and will not be using it again.

These were all right. They turned out a little dry, and you couldn't really taste the vanilla in them at all. I don't think I'll make these again, but thanks for the recipe anyway!

I used most the same ingredients but as did another reviewer (naples34102) used the more traditional method of making a cake batter- creaming the butter and sugar first, used baking powder vs baking soda. With a 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 c butter these were great. Not too sweet and nicely moist. I didn’t need to use more flour. 
Will definitely make again

I followed the recipe as is. Very good tasting and was not crumbly. It didn’t rise as much as other recipes I tried, which was fine. I would make this again.

Recipe worked pretty well for me. My daughter wanted to make chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, so I divided the batter and added half of vanilla to one and cocoa powder to another. The cups were pretty full, so I ended up making 16 cupcakes instead of a dozen (maybe I'd whipped in a lot of extra air?) They baked pretty high but deflated slightly when cooled.

Terrible. No flavor, tough, and chewy. I followed the recipe exactly and really the instructions seemed off. Need to find a cupcake recipe the complete opposite of this one.

We came across this recipe when looking for cupcakes that did not require baking powder.  These turned out to be not sweet, dry, and without much taste.  The vanilla flavor was weak, maybe because it wasn’t sweet enough.  Also, they had a strong eggy taste and smell.  Next time we will look for a recipe that does not have so many yolks.

This makes dry cupcakes. And that is definitely not the right timing for in the oven. Just tried to make them for my little cousins birthday and for my friends at a dance competition. Now I don’t know if I have enough time to make more. Very frustrating.

This tastes delicious! It's a little bit spongy when it comes out of the oven, but it's still a good texture. I added some maple syrup to the batter which I usually do for anything vanilla and it was really good!

I made this recipe as is and I really enjoyed it. For some reason though while me and my husband were eating it we thought... “Does this taste like cornbread?” Next time I made them I did 1 cup cornmeal and 1/4 cup flour... Best darn cornbread muffins I ever did make.

These cupcakes turned out amazing! The only change I made was I used one-half teaspoon of baking powder instead of baking soda. Everyone who has tried them so far think they are the best cupcakes they have ever tasted! I used cream cheese frosting with these and they are so good!

Really good cupcake! So Simple but so good! I thought it was fluffy and flavorful:) although 20 minutes in the oven seemed a little to long for my cupcakes, so the tops were a little to brown for my liking but if you top the cupcakes with some frosting they will be perfect! Love this recipe and sure that I will use it again!:)

I made these exactly according to the recipe, topped them off with some vanilla buttercream, and got my mother to break her diet! These were fantastic. Had to bake them a little longer than suggested, but pretty sure  that's just an issue with my oven. Can't wait to bring these back to my dorm for my roommates to enjoy with me!

This was a ridiculously fussy recipe, I expected spectacular cupcakes. I didn't get them. They were ok. Next time I'll stick to a simpler recipe that doesn't dirty half a dozen bowls. I added grated coconut to part of the batter, the cupcakes I added coconut to were quite a bit tastier than the others.

I didn't add any salt and came out very moist and delicious.  I also used gluten free flour.  I used just a little less than a half cup of Truvia Sugar.  Overall I will recommend this to a friend and definitely make vanilla cupcakes with this recipe again!

I tasted the batter and it seemed perfect, but when I took them out of the oven they were spongy and dry and tasted and smelled strongly of baking soda.  I don't recommend this recipe.

Longest process was to mix everything together. Just warning everyone who has or will make it, make sure you are prepared and rush quickly! By the time you finish melting the milk and butter, you must race against time to mix the big flour amount into the egg yolk and vanilla mixture. It said that after you mix the egg yolk and vanilla mixture, you must add the milk and butter WHILE ITS STILL HOT. Reheating it would perhaps make it lose its nutritional and tasteful goodness, so BE QUICK! Also, the flour mixture took a long time to mix into the egg mixture. I would love if we added the milk together partially, so that it would avoid a crazy mess in your mixing bowl. Overall, (my cupcakes are still baking but smell great!), this was an easy project, cleanup would take 5 minutes at the most, and you must be pretty quick. Will make again!

It was a really simple recipe. I went without the salt and found it came out just a tad sweeter (which was perfect for me), but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

These are very dense and spongey.  An odd consistency.  I doubled recipe, using 5 eggs to make enough for 24 cupcakes. Look elsewhere for a good cupcake recipe.

I tried this with the alterations that someone suggested and they tasted somewhat off. They almost had the taste and consistency of cornbread, which is weird. I think next time I might follow the recipes posted and see how it turns out.

I followed everything the recipe said, and it was.. alriighttt. It needed more sugar, I'd recommend adding more to the batter. Claude stated that it tasted like unflavored cornbread. Ehhh, it was okay though, because he and I like cornbread...

Tips: U can use coffee-flavoured milk (Meiji Brand) that is great for caffiene lovers. Although it dosent have any flavour in the cupcake but it enhances the vanilla flavour! The coffee-flavoured may make the cupcake batter a little coffee coloured...
The cupcake is really light and fluffy! Its so delicious... my family absolutely love it! Will make it again!

It was fabulous. My friends and family absolutely LOVED it. I would suggest to change the amount of sugar into 1 cup or 3/4 instead to make sure it isn't too sweet, but overall the cupcakes were delicious

Cooked for recommended time, too soft. Added one minute at a time. They went from being not done to overdone instantly. Thin batter to thick, sticky cupcake. Still, a good flavor. Will definitely try again, just with some tweaking.

It was very dry. It tasted alright, but it could use some more liquids in it. It goes well with cream cheese frosting. I inserted some pudding inside the center, it made it a little more moist. I think it needs some pudding or applesauce in it.

I made these and they were delicious. However, they were a bit too sweet and a strange crusty layer had formed over the top of them. The crust wasn't the easiest to remove, which had really ruined it for me. Other than that, these were great. Sorry!

The flavor of these cupcakes is good. However, the texture is just awful. They came out very spongy and sticking to the liners. I won't be making these again.

I enjoyed them, they tasted pretty good. They were a little dense and thick, but that may have been because I altered the ingredients slightly. I made these for an event and everyone gobbled them up. I recommend these to anybody who is looking for a vanilla cupcake recipe to add their icing to.

This recipe is really good alone but there is one change i made that i will tell you about. First i want to thank naples34102 for the changes they suggested perfect. So the change i made was i added about 1/2 a cup of sprinkles in the batter after it was all mixed and before i put the batter in the cupcake liners. i also used the banana cupcake frosting to frost my cupcakes! delish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Here is the link to the banana cupcakes frosting i used. 

http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-and-Vanilla-Cupcakes-with-Buttercream-Frosting/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=banana%20cupcakes&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page&soid=sr_results_p1i5

Just note that this recipe can be a little hard. Well for kids like me who are only 10. But other wise great recipe.

This recipe was very good. End results the cupcake itself was not very sweet and had a heavier texture but was perfect when paired with butter creme frosting. lovely combo.

Cupcakes did not rise, they were extremely thin. I followed the recipe and ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour and tsp of vanilla, but this recipe was just a flop.

Hands down the best cupcake I have ever had and made, it's very moist! I put 1-1/2 tsp baking powder instead of  3/4 tsp baking soda! And I put 2 tsp of vanilla! (Vanilla fan) the batter comes out very loose though, which makes it so moist! When I made mine I put a white chocolate and butterscotch ganache on top and a white chocolate Lilly! I posted a picture! But most definitely the most amazing recipe for cupcakes!

It was spongy, had a really weird texture, and didn't even tast like a vanilla cupcake! I swear I did every single step and the exact time to bake as it says. Seriously?!  If u people r reading this comment, then let me tell u this, this was the most discusting cupcake I have ever baked, once u take a bite you'll see!!!!!!! :(  ewww.......  buy a mix from WALMART!! WAY BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!!!! :(

It came out not only dense and rubbery, but bland.  Should have read the reviews.

I have made these before, but for some reason when I tried to make them again, they did not turn out at all. They were so hard that you can throw it on the ground and it wouldn't break. They did taste fine but the texture and consistency was so weird. I swear I did everything the recipe said to. Not very satisfied with the result.

It had a nice flavor, but right out of the oven an interesting texture. These taste wonderful when frosted. I will most likely make these again, but maybe add chocolate in the middle to give the cupcakes an extra addition of flavor.

I made these cupcakes easily. They were simple plus tasted very rich. I suggest you use creamy frosting on top of this. It was excellent on these cupcakes.

I bake a lot and pretty successful when I tackle something and never tried vanilla cupcakes.  A good recipe seems hard to come by but this seemed the best option.  However, I saw a lot of things wrong with it.  Baking soda, butter, salt, vanilla, flour was all wrong I thought.  Heating up the milk and butter seemed weird too.  I followed the suggestions of Naples34102 and made the  modifications.  I've never used baking soda for cakes or cupcakes but have for cookies.  For those of you wanting it sweet...vanilla cupcakes are supposed to be subtly sweet not overly sweet like chocolate or any other flavor.  If you like them sweet you could add more sugar but you will have to modify the rest of the recipe.  This is what I used.  1 stick of butter, softened, 1 cup of sugar, 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2/3 cup of milk, 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt.  Sift dry ingredients and set aside.  In small bowl cream your butter and sugar and add your eggs one at a time stiring after each.  Add your vanilla and add milk slowly and stir.  Pour in dry ingredients a little at a time while mixing.  Don't over mix.  I actually did this all by a wooden spoon to keep me from over mixing.  Pour into baking cups in your muffin tin.  Bake at 350 for 20-22 minutes.  Came out delicious!  People should be careful when posting their things.  You need a good base recipe and probably should compare others like it.  Then you can add your own twist.  :)

great recipe. they taste just like the "regular" vanilla cupcake was trying to make. i honestly didn't think they would turn out very well, but with a few minor changes like adding more vanilla and sugar, they turned out very well. i plan to make these again soon.

I followed this recipe to a T.   We didn't care for the texture of these cakes.  Also, the flavor was high on egg and low on vanilla.

This recipe was very disappointing. I was craving a good, white cupcake and followed the recipe as written. It came out over-cooked and much too dense for a cupcake texture. Our pudding/cool whip frosting was the best part.

Made this exactly as written.  It was a sweet, rubbery waste of time.  The idea is good, which is why I tried it.  It simply isn't a hit-the-spot vanilla cupcake recipe.  I will read the reviews and may try this again.

This recipe was...ok...It didn't taste bad but isn't what I am looking for. I served them to my girlscout troop and all the girls liked them! I also made them and added in a pumpkin spice mixture, After they were baked I filled them with pumpkin filling and cream cheese frosting and those were really good!!

The taste of the cupcake was fine, but the texture was very heavy and spongey.  I think next time I will do what others suggested and use one less egg.  I prefer a lighter, more cakey texture.  I also decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and still found them plenty sweet. They will suffice as a birthday treat for my daughter's kindergarten class.

These came out with a spongy texture. I prefer the Betty Crocker box stuff in taste and easieness. My brother thouroughy enjoyed these though. I guuess it depends on if you like a fluffy or a dense cupcake.

I was not happy with this recipe. The batter was too thin the first time I made them. When they came out of the oven they stuck to the liners and had very little flavor. The second time I tried it, I added extra flour to thicken it up and the cupcakes were too dense. Overall I was not impressed. I'm sorry.

They were very very dense and heavy in texture. I did it with a cream cheese frosting. 
Please don't let this encourage you not to make them! I personally did not like them, but my family did.
In my opinion they were too sweet and dense. They were pretty, though.

Recipe made really good cupcakes.  Kind of a denser cake, not light and fluffy but still very good.  Not way too sweet, as you find in other recipes.

It turned out pretty good!  I used lemon extract instead of vanilla because we were out.  The texture is a bit odd when the butter/milk combo goes in.  In the end, it turns out great, though!  I added my yummy vanilla frosting on top and there goes very happy friends!

I tried this recipe and it was OK. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out very dry... I put them in for the recommended 20 minutes, and it was way too long. Next time I make these, I'll only put them in the oven fro 18 minutes or so.

This was amazing! It was my first time trying cupcakes and these were really simple. However it did turn out a little eggy, and maybe next time i'll try adding more vanilla to it. I recommend this to all bakers-to-be if they are looking for a simple, just-enough-sweet, cupcake recipe.

Very chewy/sponge-like texture, and quite eggy. I added mini chocolate chips for a little flavor boost.. I'd consider them more of a muffin of some sort rather than a cupcake. They're not terrible, but there is really not much else you can do with them because of the odd texture. I co-own a bakery and I am always looking for new recipes to try, but this one will not go in the book.

I did not care for this recipe. The cupcakes had a strong egg flavor and the texture of a sponge.

I loved the flavor of these and they baked up beautifully, but the texture was just off. Kind of spongy and on the dry side. I followed the recipe exactly. For flavor alone, I would like to try them again, but I'm not sure how to make them more moist. Maybe a little more milk and butter? Though the batter is already on the thin side. Maybe adding vegetable oil or sour cream? They are worth trying to tweak as they have the potential to be excellent.

These got great reviews from everyone I served them to, but I thought they came out a touch too buttery - slightly muffin-like (if that makes sense :) ) A touch more flour wouldn't go amiss here.

I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, including the doubling instructions.  The texture came out strange.  Really chewy and not cake like.  I still served them at a birthday party,
