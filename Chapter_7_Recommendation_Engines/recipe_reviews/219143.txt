These are delicious as is but I did change it a bit. Used Apricot preserves, 1/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese, a couple shakes of garlic powder and a smidge of curry powder. Have made them several times already and I just found this recipe a week and a half ago. Note of caution, the filling stays very hot and will also drip very easily. Nothing a napkin or two won't cure!

I made these on Saturday and they were delicious! I made a couple of changes.  I used Big and Flaky Crescent rolls and cookie cut them into circles, (no need for the flour!)  I also cooked the sausage with the marmalade and mustard first on the stove and let it cool before finishing off the recipe as directed in the oven.  I also added shredded mozzerrella cheese on top... My aunt happened to make the same thing that night, but she used cajun sausage, and grape jelly... It was delicious as well!!! Definately a keeper!

Made these last night for our New Years Eve gathering.  Were a HUGE hit....gone in minutes.  I used Red Raspberry Seedless Jam and only had Honey Dijon Mustard.  I was told by many people they were great...and I should make them again

I had a sheet of puff pastry from another recipe I made today, so thought I'd give this a try.  Instead of kielbasa, I used Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage to get the calories and fat down a little bit.   Great finger food for football Sundays or any party, really.

I just made these exactly as is. My kids loved them but my hubby and I didn't care for the marmalade, and would have liked a bit more Dijon. I will make them again, but next time will use honey Dijon instead, and no marmalade. This way we'll get that sweetness from the honey part, and the spiciness from the Dijon.  It'll probably be a 5 star for me then. Great recipe though!
