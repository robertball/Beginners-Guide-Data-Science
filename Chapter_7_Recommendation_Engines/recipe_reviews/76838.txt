I put a slice of brie over the apple slices (I used a brand called St. Andre), which melted a bit under the last broiling.  Was very good.

I had quite a time finding non-mint apple jelly!  My search was well worth it, though.  These were very yummy...a nice update to pork chops and apple sauce!

I was slightly disappointed with the amount of flavor. Although I agree they are good, I just felt there was a lot of flavor that was missing, for all the work I put into making them. I will make them again, except I will probably add ALOT more of the spices to the mix.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was WONDERFUL!! I do not like pork chops at all, but there was a sale I could not pass up and my husband loves them. This recipe is very easy and could me used for chicken or turkey. I was very pleased with the outcome and my husband was very happy I made him some chops!!

This recipe was so easy. I suggest perhaps a shorter cook time if your pork chops are not quite an inch thick, ours turned out just a bit dry but had great flavor. Will definitely make again.
