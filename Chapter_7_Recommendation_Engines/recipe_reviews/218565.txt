This was so much fun! I had my 2 Grandgirls over to help make these cute and very tasty pizza treats! I cut and chopped the veggies and they put them together. Very creative and heathly food project. We'll make these again. You can be sure of that!

These are so easy and so much fun. With Halloween coming up, this will be a project for the little ones who visit. I was experimenting with a jack o lantern look, but I know the little ones will definitely make these much more colorful. These are also very tasty and my grown up boys gave them a definite thumbs up. UPDATE For those who complain about the additional calories and fat from the ranch dressing.........I think the ranch is a great idea to get kids to start eating vegetarian pizza. Many kids will eat just about anything they can dip in ranch. If that ploy works, well it is a step into the world of wonderful healthy vegetables.

I made this as a part of the Allrecipes Allstar program.  I like the idea of getting children involved in cooking and the fun of making the pizzas into artwork, but the ranch dressing was entirely unnecessary and just added extra fat/calories.  Additionally, at 375 the baked pita was soggy instead of crisp so it was hard to handle.  Since I like the idea of this, I'm giving it 3 stars or "I'll make this again - someday - with some adjustments."

We had a great time playing with our food night.  I did make "real" pizza dough and then the kids had blast using red onions for eyebrows, broccoli beards, mushroom eyes and smiles, red pepper and olive teeth.  All glued together with Ranch., of course - with more on the side for dipping. Thanks for a fun dinner activity!

I don't really care for ranch dressing but almost everyone does so gave it a try... no one liked them, it would be a great kids activity but not very appetizing to eat a face!

Fun, quick, and easy to make! Will put a smile on anybody's face! I'm not fond of whole wheat pitas so I used a flour taco as a substitute...very tasty! Loved the touch of Ranch dressing as a glue....adds to the flavor!

This is a perfect recipe for lazy weekend afternoons with kids!  My little granddaughters loved making these.  We used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site--an excellent addition to the great idea!  Thanks, Hidden Valley!

Fun idea for kids no doubt. For an "adult" pizza I made a chopped style salad with romaine lightly tossed with ranch dressing and topped the pizza with it when it was done baking. Very adaptable to an individual's taste. Personally I prefer homemade ranch dressing but that doesn't mean the recipe deserves less stars.

What a great way to get your kids involved in helping with dinner!  Me and my little guy made these last night and had a blast creating faces for everyone.  I didn't have pita bread, so we went with a whole wheat crust instead. These were such a hit that I'm going to make sure we have the pita bread handy to make for lunches or an easy dinner.  We used olives, peppers, onions and we added pepperoni for hair.  I loved the touch of ranch dressing (the lite is absolutely delicious and you don't miss all the calories) and we served a side of it to dip the pizza in.  This will be a definite keeper in my house!

This was so much fun to make!  We used bell pepper, mushrooms, black olives and pepperoni (little man has to have his meat on pizza ;)).  We will definitely be making these again.  Think we are going to try "Mexican" style using tortillas as the base and Mexican style toppings.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!

This recipe was a huge hit in my house, we have teenagers...and all their friends, and they all loved these veggie pizzas!  I had six helpers to assemble them; my only complaint was keeping the kids from eating my veggie prep-food toppings for the pizzas while we were assembling them!  I just added a little fresh cracked pepper to the top!

We sectioned the pizza and arranged four faces on one large whole wheat crust.  We had lots of fun attaching the various vegetables using the ranch dressing.  However, when it came time to bake it, the kids wanted only pepperoni and cheese (as usual).  We moved most of the toppings to our side of the pizza (we have two children).  We will definitely make this again and I think it would be a fun idea for a child's party.

We had so much fun making these for our weekly pizza night!  I made a crazy face, and my daughter made a puppy pizza (see photos).  You can use any vegetable you have, but we included baby broccoli, red onion, spinach, brussels sprout leaves, carrots, red pepper, and mushrooms.  We'll make these again, and kids LOVE ranch dressing, so having the flavor on the pizza was a bonus.  It only took a bit, but the family fun is worth it.

What fun.  A great way to get kids in the kitchen and get their artistic juices flowing.  The smiles are as large as you see on the photos for this recipe.  The store was out of pita bread, so I used flatbreads which I think we actually prefer.  We like thin crust pizza, so I think the pita bread would have been too much dough for us.

These were super messy to make, but the kids loved them! Great way to make them eat veggies I must say! I added a little bit more ranch (just because I am one of those rare people who actually eats ranch on their pizza normally) and it tasted great!

This is a fun food recipe if you have kids.  Well I have neither and chose to make an adult veggie pizza sans face.  Instead of using the ranch to glue on my veggies, I gave my pizza some drizzling of ranch.  Pretty good pizza and a great way to get in the veggies.

My kids aren't really fans of eating the faces...they like a supreme pizza where they get topping on every bite BUT it was really fun to make and a healthy pizza option.  I loved the idea of using the ranch as glue and I also mixed ranch dressing mix in my pizza sauce.

Me and my little guy had a blast making this! I was limited on the veggies that I had on hand, but we made it work. We used tomatoes and green olives for the eyes, sliced spinach for the eye lashes, a green olive for the nose, and pepperoni for the mouth and ears (yes, I know pepperoni isn't a veggie, but the little guy loves it, so we had to put it in there somewhere, lol). We literally laughed the entire time, and he just loved eating it! I served it w/ extra ranch on the side for dipping. Will definately make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
