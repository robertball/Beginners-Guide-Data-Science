This recipe definitely is for garlic lover's! This is a great concept, but I did do this a bit differently with the abundance of fresh sweet corn during the summer grilling season. I just couldn't see using "frozen" corn. I'm also not sure why this recipe calls for using a whole cup of chopped whole corn. That being said, I chose to grill fresh sweet corn the way I normally do - in husk on the grill. I made a garlic butter using a slightly different ratio of butter to garlic.  All that was left to do was top with the garlic butter, a little salt, pepper and break out the napkins!

So...what do you do with the cup of chopped corn?  Otherwise, it sounds good!

I made corn similar to this last summer.  Only difference is I wrapped each ear of corn with a slice of raw bacon before wrapping.  The bacon really gives it an awsome flavor.  I rated the recipe as written but with the bacon, it is definately 5 stars.

I softened my butter first, mixed in the garlic, some parsley for color and just slathered the ears before placing them in the foil. My family loved the corn this way! Thank you Janice!

We tried this tonight.  Though we thought it was ok we like Mexican grilled corn better.  I don't know we didn't like the blend of flavors.

I'm torn between doing grilled corn this way or soaking them with husks on for a while and then cooking on grill with husks, peeling them afterwards.  I love garlic and this makes it easier to serve in the end. Either way, this is Great!

Love the addition of garlic to something we have been doing for about 40 years.  Fresh corn steamed in butter, salt, and pepper, and now garlic!

Directions should include to enclose corn in a tight "Drug Store" wrap that seals all seams so it does steam, not just cook, in butter.

It's a constant contest between my Wife and I as to who wrapped the ones that "puffed up" and who wrapped the ones that leaked. :)

Made it according to the recipe. The only thing I would do differently is a little more salt--didn't want to over-salt knowing there was some in the butter as well; otherwise, this is one of my new favorite summer recipes!  I was so anxious to taste it that I forgot to take pictures...

I cooked my corn on the stove.  It was good, but needs a lot of garlic.
