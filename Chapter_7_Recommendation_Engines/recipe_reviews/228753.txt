These were great! I hate it when people review the recipe with changes, but I didn't have pita bread unfortunately, so we used individual Boboli crusts. I would like to try with the pita bread. Used a pizza stone on the bottom of the oven. Crust came out crunchy! I baked them for a shorter period of time due to crust change. Also, used fresh mozzarella instead of feta (kids not huge fans of feta). They needed a little sprinkle of salt at the end, but overall delicious for quick light a super or lunch!

I really liked this pizza. My kids did not. I used mozzarella and parmigiana for the kids, but they were leery of the green pesto. Haha!
