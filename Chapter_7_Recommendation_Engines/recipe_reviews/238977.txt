the basis of this recipe is good, but we tweaked it a bit. 
used about a tablespoon of curry powder rather than 1/2 cup. we only let the meat, potatoes, and onion simmer in the water for about 25 minutes. any longer and our potatoes would have fallen apart. we added 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt to thicken up the sauce. we put this recipe over couscous and it was phenomenal.

This dish was good but I made some modifications to the recipe. I prepared it as instructed and realized it needed some tweaking. It seemed to be a bit bland and had way too much curry, so I added more coconut milk, 2 table spoons of honey and about 2 teaspoons of salt to cut back on the curry flavor. With my additions/changes, dinner was great. I would make it again...my way. :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I love delicious ethnic lamb dishes and this one is amazing. I have never reviewed a recipe before but this one deserves the time to write a review. I have no recommendations on how to improve it because it is perfect the way it is written.

I wasn't sure how to rate this. I started off making it as directed. But things kind of fell apart with the liquid. From the start I wondered about the amounts listed. 2 pounds of meat but only 1/3 cup of beans? I ended up changing a lot of things...to even out my ingredients. I also thought the liquid/sauce wasn't the right flavor exactly. And that could be all my fault based on the type of curry powder I used. It lists a few of the spices in it, but not all. Maybe it didn't have enough of some flavors or too much of others for this particular dish. (I make my own sometimes...but had a prepared powder on hand and wanted to use it up). I made a few changes in the amount of liquid (less water, more coconut milk), added sour cream (there was no yogurt in this dish, which I was okay with at first, but decided it needed it after tasting...and I didn't have any plain)...a little salt, garlic. Maybe if I'd waited until the end it would have been a beautiful dish...but I couldn't risk it! So I didn't mark this 1 star, but didn't want it to have a 5 star, either. It's not a terrible starting point for a curry dish...but I can't say it resembled any korma I've tried/made before.

I made it and I did make a few adjustments. I like spiciness so I added some chilis. Also a bit of fresh ginger and a garlic clove minced.  Added an extra half cup of water cause I find it cooks down too much during the 45 min. simmer time. I reduced curry powder to 2 tbsp. I also added 1 cup of coconut milk instead of half. Made it creamy and allowed ingredients to simmer in enough liquids. I am a tweak freak sorry...but turned out amazing.

I made the recipe as is and I did not like it but I felt it had potential. Second time around I used half the amount of curry powder, doubled the amount of chick peas, added one third cup of tomato paste, 2 tablespoons of salt to offset curry taste and used 2/3 can of coconut milk. Taste great. I also ate this dish over couscous as one reviewer suggested.
