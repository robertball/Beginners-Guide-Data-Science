This is a keeper for sure! Easy, delicious, and filling. Used salsa style fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the Rotel because it's what I had. Used it tonight as a filling for tacos. Thinking about using the leftovers in soup of some kind. The husband who rarely rates any recipe high gave this one 5 stars! He thought it was better in a hard corn tortilla as opposed to a soft one.

I followed suggestions and used fire roasted tomatoes & used fire roasted salsa. I lightly sautéed the onions, celery and peppers before putting in the crock pot. This was delicious!! Served with fresh cilantro and sour cream on warmed tortillas.
Excellent!!!!

I had high expectations about this recipe, but it just didn't turn out for me.  After tasting it and deciding I had to do something...I added some salt, pepper and some mixed dried herbs after draining some of the liquid out of it and shredding the chicken. I then let it slow cook for another hour and it was better.  I really think it was the salsa I used and maybe if I had used the fire roasted diced tomatoes that Paula suggested in her review it might have been a lot better.  My suggestion?  Use a really flavorful salsa and the fire roasted tomatoes and you might have a winner.  Thanks Carajeanne for submitting this as it has great potential using the right ingredients.  **Addendum 9-21-14--Because mine turned out extra spicy I added it to some cooked white rice...and...Viola!...it made a great tasting "Spanish Rice"!  So, you never know what a difference one ingredient can make!

Since going back to school my life has gotten increasingly busy. It is hard to make a meal every night and especially something that is at least a little bit healthy. My mom had given me a crockpot after she found a really good deal on it so I started asking people for great recipes that could be made in a slow cooker that were not all that unhealthy. A coworker introduced me to the Slow Cooker Salsa Chicken recipe on AllRecipes so I tried it. I have since made the recipe about 20 times, I am absolutely in love with it and I make sure I have all of the ingredients on hand. I have substituted the diced tomatoes with green chilies with plain diced tomatoes if I don’t have the ones with chilies; it still tastes just as good. This is such a super easy recipe to make and there aren’t many ingredients to it. I have used this concoction in burritos, on top of rice and even on top of a salad. It is such a versatile meal that tastes different depending on how you prepare it. I would highly recommend this slow cooker meal to anyone I know and as a matter of a fact I do tell everyone who asks me about a great recipe about this one.

I only used 1 pound of chicken and added a can of black beans.  I kept the rest of the ingredients the same amount of the 8 servings.  It was the perfect amount of chicken for all the other ingredients.  I thought I would put it over rice but it's so hearty I haven't needed to add anything.  Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

Good, and so easy! I subbed extra carrot for celery and homemade fajita seasoning for taco (1 tbsp chili powder,  1 tsp each cumin, salt, and pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, and red chili flakes). Served in tortillas with sauteed peppers, avocado, and greek yogurt.

This is pretty good and I did deviate from the original recipe. Like the description says there are infinite variations...I added taco seasoning and salsa to the shredded chicken. Then a can of drained whole kernel corn and drained/rinsed black beans. Goes perfect on a tortilla with cheese and sour cream. I've made this for other people and they LOVED it!!

I used Rotel with Green Chiles (all I had), and shredded carrots for cooking, and was a little generous on the taco seasoning.  I rubbed the taco seasoning into the chicken breasts before cooking.  It was DELICIOUS!  Will definitely be making this again.

Will definitely make again.  I used the suggestion of adding black beans and corn and served with shredded lettuce, cheese, and sour cream as a complete entree with Spanish rice and blue corn tortilla chips as sides.  I did add an extra chicken breast to make less saucy and also used fire roasted tomatoes.  Leftovers ( not much) after family of 4, (2 adults & 2 teen boys), I froze and later made soup adding  2-3  c. chicken stock, torn soft bite size tortilla shells and  8 oz mexican style cheese. Serve with dollop of sour cream with sprinkles of cheese for another great meal.

I am eating healthier and I wanted to make something that is not full of carbs.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  I tripled the recipe for an office party, and everyone LOVED it!

Great start. I skipped the carrots. Then severed over tortilla chips with melted con queso. Basically a better version of Chicken and Cheese nachos you'd get at a restaurant.

Excellent! I made it just the way it was and it was delicious! Made chicken tacos with it and added avocado and lots of lime to cut the heat alittle. YUM.

This recipes is delicious, complex and so easy.  I used/subbed a few odds and ends that I had (Trader Joe's Pineapple Salsa in place of Rotel Tomatoes and Chilis) and used boneless skinless thighs that I had on hand, but otherwise kept it the same.  Took one reviewers advice and sweated the onions, celery and carrots in olive oil before adding to the crock pot.  YUM!! It was a big hit at my house and the few leftovers were fought over the next day for lunch (and were even more delicious).  Will definitely make this again!

This is really good but instead of tenderloins I used leg quarters and at the end I drained a little juice and threw in some velveeta. It REALLY brings out the flavors.

I make this with chicken pretty frequently, it's really good and a big hit with our 7 person household.  The last time I made it I "tweaked" it and did the following:  I smoked a pork loin (not a tenderloin) low and slow until it reached 145°then refrigerated it overnight (wrapped).  Put it in the crock pot the next morning following this recipe, substituting water for chicken broth and it was unbelievably good.

Easy & Good! I made this per the recipe with the exception of using an orange pepper and a red pepper in lieu of the carrots. Straight from the crock pot it was fine, but once I added cheese & used it for quesadillas it was top notch. I had to make a second quesadilla :) Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was very good and I'll make it again for sure.  It had slightly too much liquid for us, but It's easy to improvise with this recipe and make adjustments.  We served it several times (there's just 2 of us): over rice, on corn tortillas, and straight!  We added grated cheese and sour cream as toppings, delicious!

Delicious dish! I used 1 1/2 pounds of thinly sliced skinless chicken breast instead of 2 pounds. I brined the chicken for 2 hours prior to putting it in the crockpot. And I bought fire roasted tomatoes canned as per a reviewers suggestion and it really brought the whole dish together.

Hubby gave this a 5 star rating; I only give it 4, but I'm super stingy with 5 star ratings. I did use fajita seasoning instead of taco seasoning because its what I had in the house. I used a hot salsa, so I left the habaneros out (would have used them with a  mild salsa). The chicken totally shreds itself with no effort. So soft and yummy!

Very good. I’m doing low carb so I ate mine over lettuce like a chicken taco salad. The rest of the family ate it with tortillas as tacos. The only changes I made were leaving out the carrots and celery and replaced them with red and yellow bell peppers, and used chicken broth instead of water. Oh and I added fresh garlic as well.

I love this recipe.  I make a simple chicken vegetable soup that uses shredded chicken. This shredded chicken recipe makes that soup delicious. So I get some chicken nachos out of this and then plenty of soup!  Thanks for this recipe

This was okay, but not great. We found it pretty bland and a lot watery. If I make it again, I will definitely drain the tomatoes and not add any extra water at all. As far as the salsa, definitely think it would be better with a chunky variety because anything looser just adds to the watery aspect. I'll also bump up the seasoning more. I ended up adding a ton of onion and garlic powder toward the end of cooking to try to save it because the flavor punch wasn't there.

Very tasty, everyone loved it! Omitted the carrots and used red and orange peppers instead. Didn’t need the 1/4 cup water. Used the hot Rotel diced tomatoes and pineapple salsa...just delicious!

Kind of is my own twist on this one. Coated the chicken with the taco mix. No water but a whole car of Safeway brand Peach and Pineapple salsa (love this stuff). Added some fresh cilantro. The cool part was it was pretty watery and i decided to try and make some spanish rice to go along with the meal. I put one cup of brown rice in my rice cooker and added one cup of the excess liquid from the chicken mix and one cup of water. The rice came out GREAT. The chicken was a bit bland for me so next time i will be adding some tapatia to it. maybe coat the chicken with some tapatia before i coat it with the taco seasoning.

I made it with black beans in the salsa mixture and then boiled rice at the end and it was AMAZING! So juicy and delicious! Also very good in a tortilla wrap!

Made this last week and it's so easy and tastes AMAZING! I doubled the recipe and added more onion and RoTel tomatoes then what it called for but kept everything else the same. I also used hot seasonings cause I love the spice. I had each of the three people I had try it ask me for the recipe. I love this?!

My husband and I LOVED this!  I did not put in the water that was called for, and I am glad I did because I actually had to drain a little bit of the liquid off as it cooked. Added corn and black beans.  Will definitely make this again, and again, and again.

Easy dish. It was however a bit dry, which was strange considering the amount of salsa and such.

I've made this several times and love it! In fact, I'm making it again tonight for Cinco De Mayo! I modified the recipe a bit by using a frozen Mirepoix Mix to save time chopping (onions,celery carrots), and used canned Fire Roasted tomatoes instead of the Rotel, added lime juice, minced garlic, some cilantro, green onions, brown rice & extra Taco seasoning with Cumin, to the chicken in the pot, layering it according to cooking times. Cooked on Low for 8 hrs. The chicken is so tender, it shreds so easily just by using a wooden spoon and stirring. I serve it in a bowl  & top it off with Finely shredded Mexican cheese, Guacamole & Sour cream. It's simply delicious!!

Made it as suggested — possibly overdid the onion? I didn’t measure so IDK. ;) Anyway, it was good — really good — but a little bland. Added about a tsp of sea salt and WOW! This is a winner for sure!

This was easy and tasted terrific. I used the whole can of Rotel tomatoes and less salsa to compensate.  I also mix up a homemade taco seasoning, found on AR, so I used it instead of store bought mix.   We layered rice, refried beans, the salsa chicken, and topped with shredded Mexican cheese. It made a great Mexican chicken bowl. This is going to be a regular meal at my home!

Fantastic and easy. I put the chicken breasts in whole and shred them with forks after they are cooked. After the shredded chicken absorbs the liquid, it's perfect for soft or hard tacos. A huge family favorite.

New favorite!  Followed the recipe closely but did not have celery. Pounded the chicken first. Used shredded zucchini instead. Good base for tacos but we ate it over rice.

This turned out wonderful. I couldn't find the rotel hot so I used a habanero salsa that spiced it up. I served them with taco cheese blend and sour cream on soft taco shells - delicious, easy meal!

This recipe was amazing with a few alterations!!!  I followed what other people said and doubled seasoning and veggies for the two pounds of meet. I also added black beans and corn. It was so flavorful and was perfect in tacos or to make nachos. I definitely will make this again!

Loved this recipe. So easy and you can make numerous adjustments to suit your personal tastes. I've made this a couple of times. First time followed the recipe. It was a little soupy, so the next time I didnt add the water that it calls for and added 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans....topped with Monterey Jack chese and it was amazing. Definitely will keep on my dinner rotation.
