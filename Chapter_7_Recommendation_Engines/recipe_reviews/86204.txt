This sounded interesting so thought I'd try it... I reduced the ginger to 2 Tbsp. To round this into a full meal, I added a bit of onion, a package of thawed frozen spinach, some mushrooms, and paper-thin carrot slices. It would be good with other veggies as well. I needed all the juice, so simmered  it covered, and served over jasmine rice. It was delicious! Not at all too spicy, but I do like spicy things!

My husband and father-in-law (chile-heads) both loved this!  It was a little hot for me, so the next I make it I'll take some of the coconut milk and pour it in a small saucepan and add half the hot ingredients to that pot so they can add the "hot sauce" to their taste and the main pot isn't too hot for me.  And it reheats fabulously!

This is an excellent vegan dish.  I ended up also adding carrots, chiles, onion, squash and mushrooms to round it out and eliminate the need for a vegetable side dish.  I also added to soft veggies (the mushrooms, squash, and bell pepper) very close to the end instead of at the beginning of the simmer.  If you're the type who doesn't like super-soft and soggy vegetables, you should do this.  It'll keep them a bit crunchy.

This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite dishes. The spice can be customized to your liking. This dish has a distinct Asian flavor, but is heartier than many other meatless dishes.

I like this recipe, but, MAN it's salty! I've made this twice and both times found the salt overpowering (and I'm not one to shy away from the salt shaker).  Good flavor, otherwise.  I'd just recommend using half the salt the recipe calls for and adding more if necessary after tasting it.

I thought there was way too much chili powder.  I cannot taste the coconut or curry at all because the chili powder completely overwhelms the other flavors.  I had to add Tabasco to give it some heat and flavor.

Restaurant quality and healthy! perfect as is, but also delicious with a can of diced tomatoes mixed in. The amount of spice was perfect for me.

I think there's a difference between "spicy" and over-spiced.  I felt that this recipe was over-spiced to the point of it giving that chalky sensation in your mouth. The recipe was definately edible, just not one I'd save to my recipe box!

Fairly similar to something I make already,  but the addition of ginger really kicked it up a notch.  I'll continue to use my own recipe (onions,  black beans,  coconut milk, curry powder,  mango) but will definitely add ginger next time as well.

Put the chili paste in last -- and sneak up on the quantity. Start with half teaspoon, stir, taste, then add more bit by bit until you get the heat right for you. I made it with ground beef and onions, and it could use a third can of any beans if you need to stretch it. Served it over basmati rice. Good flavor.

If you like it vegetarian, hot, and full of flavour, then this is good! I'm sure you can play around with flavours, but as is, this is an excellent combination of flavours. YUM!

This is one of the best recipes I have come across. We have dinner parties every Wed. nights and this was the show stopper! Everyone wanted the recipe. Granted, we all like spicy food so this hit the spot.

It's good thing I reduced the ginger, because 2 tbsps were plenty for my taste.  I only used 1 tsp of chili powder and it was very spicy.  I also used thai yellow curry paste the curry paste and instead of parsley I added a bunch of cilantro.

I didn't think this was BAD per se, but nothing to write home about.  The volume of spices in this recipe made the sauce seem  kind of pasty/gritty.  Maybe I'll try it again with half the ginger that's listed, but that won't fix the pasty problem.

Didn't like this recipe at all! It started aout well... with the coconut milk, ginger, garlic and parsley in the pan - my mouth was watering! BUT there was waaayyy too much spice added for my liking (I even cut it down!). I like spicy food but this was just not what I expected. Oh well...

Not one that I'd make again. Halved the spices based on comments by others. It was not too hot, but the flavor was not outstanding either.

This was great, healthy and different! I've been getting into indian foods since we went back to vegetarianism recently so this recipe sounded perfect, we eat a lot of beans! I added 1 tsp. of cayenne since my curry paste was 'mild', it still could have used more. Mine ended up being a mustard yellow color, unlike the photo above. I served on top of long grain brown rice. I can't stand coconut, but really enjoyed this dish.

These beans are great!  Even my 3-year-old loves them.  After making this recipe a couple of times, I was able to settle on a version that suited our family's tastes a bit better - I use green curry paste, cut the turmeric to 1 tsp, and the chili powder to 1 heaping TBSP.  We love eating it over jasmine rice, and sprinkling scallions and cilantro on top.

Great recipe!  I added 2 tablespoons agave nectar, thinly sliced carrots and fresh spinach in the last 15 minutes of simmering.  Also, left out garlic, curry paste and kidney beans.  Served on a bed of jasmine rice and topped with lime marinated, pan seared tilapia.

It was OK, I was expecting it to be hotter; perhaps the spices I used are not as fresh as they should be... Flavour was so-so.

This is a very flavorful dish, although a little too salty for me. I will make this again but will reduce or even eliminate the salt. With all of the other spices, I don't think it will be missed at all.

This is the first recipe from this site that I gave a 5 star rating. I was afraid it was going to be too spicy for me, but it was just right. However, I only had to cook the mixture for at least half the time as suggested, don't know why. Awsome yummy beans!

This was great over white jasmine rice. We doubled the recipe so we could freeze some for later and used both hot and mild curry paste to give it a less subtle kick. Excellent!

The best way to describe this dish, in my opinion, is chilli with an exotic twist...my husband and I have dubbed it "Bombay Chilli."  We really, really enjoyed it.  I added half the called-for chili powder, and used a can of mixed salad beans instead of a can of kidney beans.

I thought this was way too spicy with a bitter aftertaste.  My husband thought it tasted like spicy chili.  Served over rice.  I lessened the spices slightly (removing 1/2t from each) and used thai red curry paste.  Just OK for us.

We loved this!  It was so good over rice.  I didn't have all the right spices so I improvised a bit, the curry really made it.

Rice and beans go together well, and I believe similar combinations exist in any culture using rice.

My addition was a chopped onion I think there is some unwritten law about adding Onions to beans, but that may be my imagination. Even so: how can you add garlic without adding onions or at least a shallot?

For my taste (I like spicy and hot foods) this is mild, but you can ramp it up at the table with pepper or hot sauce. I suggest starting at the recipe level and moving up or down on heat after your first venture.

This was bad. I made it through about one serving and that was it.
