We love this. I do like to add more moisture (bananas, applesauce) for our taste. This morning's variation substituted pumpkin for the bananas, craisins for raisins, a teaspoon of cardamon for one of cinnamon, and included chopped almonds--yum!

This bakes up like a cake!  I wasn't sure how to serve this.  Like pancakes with butter and syrup or fancy with whipped cream!  I decided on just plain, this time!  When still warm, this has an overwhelming banana taste, but when cool, the flavors blend.  Either warm or cold, this tastes good.  It is a cake with the ease of cutting into, but the texture isn't light and fluffy like most cakes!  I will be making this again!

Took 75 minutes before it was "dry" enough to cut properly.  It was still quite oatmeal like - I wouldn't describe it as like a cake as other reviewers have.  Overall it tasted just like baked steel cut oats with some spices - nice, but not sure it's worth the extra time :)

I have been trying various Baked Oatmeal recipes.  Baked Oatmeal II resembled a bar cookie and was delicious.  I tried this recipe to see the difference steel cut oats would make in the texture.  As it called for no sweetener I added 2/3 c of packed brown sugar (adding ~55 calories per serving).  I also increased the amount of fruit in order to use up blueberries.  Also when I was making it I got distracted and forgot this was supposed to be an overnight recipe.  It turned fine.  For breakfast, I think I like this one better. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/healthy-baked-steel-cut-oatmeal/

I needed something to get rid of too many steel-cut oats.  I tried this and I liked it.  It is a healthy bar meant to be eaten on the go, so I appreciated that about the recipe.  The only change I made was to add the baking powder, bananas, and eggs after the 8 hour sit time and that worked well.  I did add about a 1/4 cup of sugar because the bananas weren't sweet or ripe enough to sweeten the entire dish.

I didn't make any changes because it was the first time I made it. I made it exactly as written and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. The flavors here are wonderful together. The bananas really made this for me. I baked it for 45 minutes after the 8 hour rest in the refrigerator and thought the texture was perfect. I love the suggestions this recipe author made for additions. I'll be trying those in the future for sure. We're gonna love having this on the weekly rotation. Thanks for posting this!

I know its weird but add 1/4 lb of diced country ham and a handful of dry roasted peanuts and maybe a little more salt. Cook it a bit longer too.  Savory and sweet is a great combination.

This was ok.  In reading the recipe I could tell I wanted a little more flavor so I added shredded coconut and Amber grade Maple syrup.  Even with those extras it was just ok.  It's not a cake, to heavy. It's not a bar, too light and moist. It's like sweet oat quiche.  I don't think leaving it over night helps much. I suspect if one baked it right after combining the mixtures together, it might be more cake like.  I think leaving sit over night loses what ever raising abilities the baking powder had. I am going keep looking for something better to use steel cut oats in.

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactlyexactly. It was a great consistency. I added a few extra raisins, but this is a definite make again!

Only changed milk to almond milk. Thought it was a little bland. Couldn't taste the banana at all.  Will double cinnamon & raisins next time & add nuts. With a little tweaking will be a regular for oatmeal.

I will make this again. It is great for a quick morning breakfast. I did not have any raisins so I left them out and added flaxseed blueberries and orange zest. 
My husband who does not usually get excited over oatmeal really loved it. ( I drizzled his with honey) I think it was a wonderful low sugar recipe. Mine did not turn out cake like. It was moist. The texture was close to regular oatmeal. I would say baked rice comes out like rice and this comes out close to just being oatmeal. Baking it over the weekend just made my morning routine easier during the week.

This is not sweet at all. Great for toddlers. Add sugar if making for adults.
