I made this recipe last night, it was awesome.  I doubled all the ingredients and made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  This is one of the best sauces for lasagna that I have come across.  Most others are spagetti sauce type, this is fresher and more like authentic lasagna sauce.

This was wonderful and a regular in our house, I even make just the sauce for regular pasta because it has such a great garlic/tomato taste!  I guess this is intended to make a small lasagna - I made w/ 1 lb. sausage and double sauce, and it was barely enough for 2 small lasagnas.  Now I make 4x the amount of sauce and reserve some to have on the side, because even double it was all absorbed by the noodles (which I like but my husband likes more sauce).  I also like my lasagna spicier so I double all the herbs/spices. 

Options for variations: You can make with no-boil noodles but need to bake 1 hourb at 350 covered instead of 30, plus I'd make sure the edges are submerged in sauce (and maybe add 1/4 c water around edges) or the noodles won't cook all the way through.  I have also used diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos for a medium amount of spice, or hot sausage.  You can also add spinach and/or other vegetables to the cheese mixture if you like, or add other diced vegetables (red and green peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, squash, olives, etc.) when cooking the sausage.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe. I added ground beef, and pepperoni pieces to make it three meat! I also added veggies as I do with most italian food. A layer of cooked yellow squash, zuccini, and fresh mushrooms made it even better!

The best lasagna we've ever had!! My Husband is hard to please with Lasagna and this is his favorite!  I used an extra sausage link(we love italian sausage) and added more mozzarella.  The sauce is delicious, we plan on using it for all our pasta dishes.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I definitely would. This was the best lasagna I have EVER had. It was so amazingly delicious, and not hard to make at all. I have a family of 3, including myself, and I made a 9x13 pan of this, thinking I would have leftovers....but we ate the whole thing...THE WHOLE THING. Unbelievable.....thank you so much for sharing this great recipe. It is definitely a keeper, and I will make again!!!!!!!!!!!

AWESOME!!! My wife loved it. I did double all ingredients so we could have leftovers. We do believe the pasta is always better the second time around. I did add a couple of little twists to the recipe, I added mushrooms, always great in pasta and I also added some oregano in place of half of the basil, plus a little more all over the top before I covered it with mozzarella cheese. I added a slice of tomato to each piece that you would cut and put some crumbled blue cheese on top of those. I uncovered it for the last 5 minutes & broiled it to brown in the blue cheese on the tomato slices. Very good with a slice of Garlic bread beside it.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe; we will enjoy it again that is for sure.

This was extremely good, my three year old gobbled it up and asked for more. I did increase the size because I had 5 sausage links and didn't want to waste them. I also added half a pound of ground beef that I needed to use up. This is about as close a duplicate as I can find to my mother-in-law's recipe, thanks for sharing!

Doubled the recipe, used sun-dried tomato chicken sausage but otherwise kept the same.  Really delicious, just a little time consuming.  When doubling the recipe I think only 1 egg is necessary.

My husband declared, "It's a keeper!"  What I loved about it is not only is it delicious, but it's relatively easy to make, especially if you just pre-soak the lasagna noodles rather than boiling them.  It's also nice to have a recipe that's well-sized for a couple, although it can be easily doubled or tripled.

This was the perfect amount for two people! We enjoyed this, I added black olives to this too. Next time I will probably add mushrooms too. I definitely will make this again.

This is exceptional!  It was almost gone with just two of us eating it for dinner.  I only made two small changes:  I used no boil noodles (because it is what I had) and cottage cheese because I don't like the texture of ricotta.  And I used homemade Italian Sausage from the AR recipe.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Update:  I made it a second time with store bought hot italian sausage and bottled sauce.  I liked it better the first time with the homemade sauce.  Don't skip that step!

Great lasagna!  Sauce is delicious and tastes like it was cooked for hours.  I layer pieces of pepperoni between my layers and it really adds to the flavor.  I also make double the sauce because I don't care for dry lasagna!  This is a keeper!

Very good. It takes a lot of time, makes a big mess, but it's a good recipe. I always try to use the substitutions, but can't remember which ones I used last.

Not great, not bad.  It didn't taste as stellar as I thought it would after reading the other reviews.  It tasted like a regular sausage lasagna.

I love this! I doubled the recipe to bake in a 9x13" pan, used 1lb Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage instead of sausage links. And I added 1 cup of water, and also used ready-to-bake noodles, baking for 1 hour (double-wrapped in tin-foil). YUM!

Been looking for a good lasagna, this one definately fits the bill. I made it exactly as the recipe says and my family loved it. I know its good when they brag it up to our other family members. I did forget to put the mozzerella in the layers so I layed it on thick right on top and it still was excellant. May try this one with venison sausage next time, just for a twist.

This is a great starter recipe. I substituted the sausage links for Italian style sausage by Lee Fogle on this site. I placed all the ingredients except the cheese and noodles into the slowcooker and let them brew on low for a couple hours. I then added sliced zucchini in with the noodles and cottage cheese in with the ricotta cheese. I also used a cheddar marble mix for the cheese. Yum... A definitely will make again! My boyfriend cant wait! Said it was the best he has eaten...

I have a very similar recipe from Better Homes and Gardens that also uses sausage and it has always been my favorite.  This one interested me because it said it served 3.  For just my husband and I for me to make lasagna, it means lots of leftovers which he eventually tires of.  This still made too much but it was very delicious.  This will be my favorite lasagna recipe from now on!

Thank you for this recipe!  Best Lasagna I have ever had, the sauce is amazing.  I appreciate the scaled down recipe since I usually cook for only 1 or 2.  I am a novice cook - but my friend now thinks I am amazing.  I used whole wheat noodles and it was great.

Very Yummy!  I took others advice and doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 X 13 pan.  My daughter, who only picks at food, had three helpings! My picky son ate it!  I did do a substitution:  I used whole wheat ravioli instead of lasagna noodles as I didn't have any in the house.  I also added a half cup of ground beef as others suggested.  Will definately make again!

This was so good. I did have trouble keeping it moist and had to add a little extra jar sauce to keep it from being a little dry.

I made this recipe today after having a horrible craving for Lasagna (I'm pregnant...LOL).  I absolutely LOVED it!  The only changes I made was adding a final layer of noodles with some sauce, mozzerella and parmesan.  I did use an entire 8oz bag of mozzerella since I like a LOT of cheese on my lasagna.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Chef Luigi and I made this dish tonight per his request. The only changes were that we doubled it and added 1/2tsp of fennel because Chef said it would make it more "Italiany."  Turned out great, not too heavy.  Will be sure to make this again.  Thanks Becky!!!

I am a beginner cook and I have always wanted to know how to make Lasagna. I used to think that it took too much time and energy to make Lasagna, but boy was I wrong.  I had to scaled back on the measurements, since I was only cooking for myself. I didn't use any of the garlic cloves, parsley or pepper flakes ingredients either. I wanted to add green peppers with the onions, but I didn't have any. This dish turned out wonderful. I almost ate the whole pan(that's how much I love Lasagna) at once. I made it on a Sunday and it lasted until Tuesday. I am really happy now that I know how to make Lasagna. Yipeee!!

The measurements of all ingredients are way too low for even a medium-sized dish.  However, if you pretty much triple everything, this is a fantastic recipe!  The only thing I did differently was add a thin layer of turkey pepperoni on top of the ricotta layer and I used one 8 oz. block of Mozzarella cheese mixed with one 8 oz. block of colby.  Very good outline though!

Though this tasted great, but I think the cooking instructions could use a little improvement. I doubled the recipe, and found that I could have easily added one more can of diced tomatoes, and another sausage. To improvise with what I had, I added a small 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, and had to sparsely spread the ricotta/egg/parsley combo. I also found that I needed to bake the lasagna for at least another 10 minutes for it to be cooked to perfection. Will definitely use again, but with modifications.

Very delicious!  Makes a smaller pan (love the loaf pan idea) which makes it great for  those who don't need a lot of lasagna left-over.  Flavors were wonderful, and the pepper flakes gave it some "kick"  Good recipe!

This was by far the best Lasagna I've ever had (put Olive Garden to shame)  The only addition that I did was instead of the recommended two links of sausage, I used four.  I like a meatier sauce.  Aside from that little change, everything else was exactly perfect!!  Way to go on an incredible recope!!  I got rave reviews from the entire family!!

Excellent!  I thought this was easy to make, though it did take some time, but it turned out wonderful.  Will be making this again for sure, it was a perfect balance between spicy (used hot italian sausage) and sweet.  I didn't have any crushed tomoatoes so I used a little more tomoato sauce.  My husband thought I slaved in the kitchen all day it was so good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time making lasagna, I always wanted to try it and finally did.  I followed the directions but used chicken instead of Italian Sausage, my mistake but my daughter is on a diet and wanted to try chicken. It was okay, but I think I would prefer the sausage. So next time I will. Thanks for sharing.

I doubled this so I could freeze a pan. I used hot italian turkey sausage and whole grain lasagna, added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and some Oregano & Italian seasoning. I also added some parmesan to each cheese layer instead of just the top. My husband said it was the best lasagna he's ever had! I think the "World's Best Lasagna" from this site is better, but this recipe requires far less prep time! This is definitely a keeper.

I'm new to cooking and found that this recipe was easy to follow (I doubled the recipe) and came out wonderful! I had some friends over for dinner and they all loved it. The only mistake I made was not letting it sit long enough after baking and it became soupy, but still delicious! The sauce alone is something I would use again for pasta.

This turned out wonderful.  The texture and consistency were great (didn't fall apart like some lasagnas), the flavours were terrific. The homemade sauce went wonderfully with the dish.  We used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, being the only difference, and no Parmesan.  A great new use of Italian sausage...never would have thought.  Thank you for this one!

This was pretty yummy! I had never made lasagna before so I was impressed. However, I did have to make changes. First of all I doubled the recipe, but had to add extra sauce because there wasn't enough and I had to use double the cheese even after doubling the recipe. I did add peppers and olives to the sauce as well. Overall, a good recipe that you can modify to your taste buds.

Our entire family of six, plus eight relatives loved this lasagna.  They were quite impressed that I made it myself.

I used hot Italian sausage so I didn't add the pepper flakes. And the diced tomatoes I used were fire-roasted with garlic, so I didn't need to add the garlic, although I could have, as we love garlic.

Thanks for a really great recipe!

Simple lasagna that is delicious and easy to prepare. Great for weekdays. I made mine in 2 loaf pans instead as I don't have the size pan per the recipe. Used more cheese than recipe called or but was a preference and probably warranted by the use of 2 pans.

I agree, not enough sauce.  Next time I will add a can of tomato sauce.  Great flavor!
