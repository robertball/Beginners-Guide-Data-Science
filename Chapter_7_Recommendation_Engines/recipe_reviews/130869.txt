Great recipe! I used fresh tomatoes plus a can of tomatoes with chiles for a little zip! I served over a bed of aldente thin spaghetti this time but this would be great on homemade pizza crust or french bread as a Bruschetta! Just add some cheese! You must love anchovies for this one, scale down the anchovies if you have any doubt!

I tried it last week when we were staying with my son, who asked for marinara sauce. I wouldn't have done it otherwise because my husband professes not to like pasta. This has converted him! I'll make it again this week, because I can't get the memory of it out of my mind! We couldn't taste the anchovies, it just had a deep flavour, and I used the rest of the anchovies on top.
