This is a good standard beef stew recipe, but I thought it would have been better with a lot fewer tomatoes, maybe even less than half of what the recipe calls for.

I loved this recipe.  I through all the ingredients in the crockpot in the morning, and that evening my husband and I enjoyed a delicious meal.  I served rye bread too. Rye bread always goes wll with stew.

This stew was very filling and tasty!  Easy ingredients, I had them all around the house so I didnt even have to go to the store; that's points in my book.  =)

I made this for the first time almost 2 years ago and it is now a staple meal in our home.    I, too, made a change or two, but one change was pure accident.      The only canned tomatoes I had were the diced Red Gold with Green Chilies.  The chilies give this stew just enough of a zip putting it ahead of all others.

The cook times on this recipe seemed to be quite odd, as the vegetables needed more then even an hour. The flavor was very good, the texture was a little thinner then we like so I mixed a little flour with the juice and added to soup to thicken. Really Enjoyed on this cold winters night!

This recipe delivers an excellent flavor, but I might call it beef soup.  It could have easily been thickened by adding flour or whatever, but it tasted so good we ate it as it was.

I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I used two cups of boiling Swanson's beef broth.  I also added 4-5 stalks chopped celery.

Really tasty and easy recipe.  We only had 1 lb of beef but we kept all the other measurements the same and added some extra vegetables, like eggplant and mushrooms, which were really good.  Had lots of left overs and can't wait to eat it again tomorrow!

This was a perfect and really simple recipe for beef stew.  I added veggies in after only an hour and everything turned out great.  Beef broke apart upon touch of your spoon!  All you need is a fresh loaf of sourdough and you've got the perfect comfort food for a chilly evening spent indoors.  Thanks, Granny!

This recipe was good and filling, but maybe could have used a little more seasoning. Will experiment more when I make this again. I put everything in the crockpot and let it cook all day; everything was tender and delicious when suppertime rolled around. This stew is excellent served with cornbread.

I used deer beef instead of reg beef since it's that season.  Tastes great!

Followed the recipe, didn't add tomatoes because I don't like tomatoes, but added some veggies that I had for leftovers in it too. Green beans and lima beans were an excellent addition. I started adding brown rice flour in slowly to get the consistency I wanted. I would suggest that with any flour. Served with bread and it made a wonderful dinner and great comfort food.

Best stew I have ever made.  My husband said it was better than the Paula Deen recipe I had used the last time.  So easy, and definitely will make again.  I used my cast iron pan, and since I was going out in the afternoon, I browned the meat and cooked it for a couple hours in the morning, put it in the frig, and when I got home,quick heated it added veggies, and it was just wonderful.
