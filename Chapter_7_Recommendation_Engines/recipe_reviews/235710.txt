Wonderfully delicious moist melt in your mouth meatballs. Since I was the first to make this recipe I followed exactly, even using the paper towel to drain my juice, a very nice tip by the way. I used my own homemade marinara sauce and had about 32 ounces, which was a nice amount to cover the meatballs and go over spaghetti noodles for four. I got 34 meatballs with my one inch melon ball scoop. The problem I had was the meatballs are very moist and were sticking to the pan and were falling apart, I had to be very delicate in cooking them and lost a few to crumbles. I will be making this one again, but think I'll put my meatballs on a baking sheet and bake them to brown them and then add to the sauce and simmer, hopefully that will keep them from falling apart.

These are so soft and cheesy!  I did not cook them as the recipe states though, just stuck to my normal, which is roll into balls place on a greased baking rack (over a baking sheet) and baked 25 minutes at 350.  Delicious :)  Served over Zucchini noodles.

Now I've been making meatballs for years and these are fantastic. Followed recipe as written except I did not add the 1 cup of water to the sauce since I like a thicker sauce. I also added 2 Tbl. spoon of parma cheese to the mix along with 1/2 a teaspoon of Italian Spice blend. Next time I will add just a little less ricotta since I like a firmer meatball. Bake in oven at 425 for 15 to 20 min.  I could'nt stop "testing" them before dinner was served. Very tender and flavorful. Excellent Meataball!

This is another Chef John winner!  I got close to 30 meatballs using my close to two tablespoon cookie scoop.  I used part regular parsley and part basil for the meatballs, but the marinara I used was an organic tomato basil marinara from Trader Joe's.  I followed the recipe as written otherwise.  I formed the meatballs earlier this afternoon and so they were cold when I added them to the pan.  My big mistake tonight was to use only my 10" pan rather than the 13" that would have made it all so much easier and without having to clean up my mess!  We have leftovers, and I think that's what I'll have for breakfast tomorrow!  Thanks, Chef!  EDIT:  After eating some of the leftovers, I wanted to add that you don't need to be afraid to add a little more flavor to these meatballs.  We thought that they could have used just a little more spice to them.  But, still, yum!

These are delicious! For those who complained about the meatballs being too fragile, make sure you are actually following the recipe's measurements.  Ricotta cheese sold in the small containers contains more than one cup.  If you use too much ricotta, of course the meatballs won't hold together that well. (They'll still taste great, though.)  So make sure you are measuring and not just dumping in the whole container as I suspect some people might have done.  Another winner from Chef John - thanks!

Great meatballs with a lovely soft texture!  Changes I made:  1.  I used dried parsley (1 Tbs.), basil (1 Tbs.) and ground marjoram (1/2 tsp.) because my own herb plants have not yet matured enough to harvest them and I wasn't about to go out and buy fresh when, I felt, the dried are absolutely fine in this recipe; 2.  I added about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan to the meatball mixture because I cannot fathom meatballs without it; and 3.  I baked my meatballs in a preheated 350 degree oven (baking sheet lined with parchment) for 25 minutes, turning the balls once halfway through baking.  I simmered them in my favorite commercial marinara for the better part of the afternoon and served them over perciatelli pasta and with homemade garlic toast for dinner tonight (the leftovers will be used for meatball subs a little later this week).  My only beef is that although there was a pinch of cayenne pepper in the mixture, I could not detect any heat in the meatballs.  The next time I make these, and I will, I will add a good two pinches of cayenne.   Bravo, Chef John!

I just finished frying these up and was disappointed at how fragile they are. You really need to take your time or use a very non-stick pan. I think I will do as the previous reviewer mentioned next time and bake them in the oven. That being said, the flavor of these is absolutely wonderful! I didn't change anything and my sons are taking spoonfuls of it out of the pan right now and making "num, num, num" noises! We will definitely make these again, so says my eldest! Maybe even tonight if I don't have enough for dinner!

I made these Ricotta Meatballs today and they were delicious.  I followed the recipe exact, except i mixed fresh Basil & Parsley together to make 1/4 cup.  Since I like larger meatballs, I made each one about 2 1/2 inches, which gave me 13 and baked them on 375* for about 20 minutes turning a few times.  I finished off in the pan as the recipe calls.  For my hubby who loves pasta, a chopped the meatballs and put on top of the pasta.  Myself just ate them as is.  This is a recipe that I will definitely make again.  Served this with Chef John's Stacked Tomato & Burrata Salad also on this site, and a crusty garlic french bread.  Thank you Chef John for all of your wonderful recipes.

I've mad this twice now. The first time I neglected the egg. That was a disaster. They all fell apart. I've never had that problem with my meatballs before but I imagine that's because of the ricotta. I also had a giant pack of meat so the amount of balls was overwhelming for me. The second time I made these almost exactly as described. The only changes were no parsley, oregano instead. Both times I used ground turkey. This is amazingly moist and flavorful. Chef John never fails. I've been following his recipes since well before he joined allrecipes. He never disappoints.

All of my changes were after reading some of the reviews. Some mentioned they were falling apart, so I decided to bake mine in a 350degF oven for 25 min, turning half-way. I cut back a little on the ricotta and will reduce it further the next time. For more flavor, I also added parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes and onion powder. Immediately after I cooked them, I put about 5 meatballs in sauce to try over spaghetti. They were really moist; will see if they stay moist over being refrigerated. UPDATE 1/6/17: Tried and still moist after a couple of days. Not like others that dry out. I'm impressed!

I made this with no changes except using chicken instead of beef (health thing).  I fried 2 to test and found it to have a good texture but way too bland for our taste.  I added more cayenne, red pepper flakes, basil, thyme, oregon, mustard powder, and some grated romano.  I baked rather than fried and they were excellent.

Very Good! I baked the meatballs in a 350 oven for 15 mins, instead of frying.  I added them to my own sauce. They are very good in a brown gravy over egg noodles.

Absolutely delicious.  These meatballs were light and flavorful.  Definitely a new favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly, well OK, I used fresh basil instead of parsley, but other than that as written.  I had no problems with falling apart or sticking.  I used very cold ingredients, and it's very cold here, so that probably helped.  And I have a terrrifc, huge Calphalon non-stick saute pan.  I added these to my recipe for Rao's Restaurant marinara.  A definite do-over and a new fave.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, CJ.

I have made this recipe 6 times now and the last 2 times I baked them.  Easier cooking and clean up.  25 min. At 350.  So delicious!  My grandsons love them.

Best meatball recipe I have ever made! I had no trouble with them sticking or falling apart. The only suggestion I have would be adding additional sauce if you are serving them over spaghetti or in a hoagie roll. Delicious!

Best meatballs ever!  Baked them in the oven. Doubled the recipe.  Put some meatballs in a freezer bag after flash freezing. Used the other half to form burgers that the family raved about!

WOW! This a great meatball recipe! I pretty much kept it to the original with the following "personalizations": I used 1/2 of a Vidalia onion, 2 fresh garlic cloves (didn't want it to be over-powering), 1 tsp of basil, 1 T died parsley flakes, 2 "pinches" of cayenne pepper, less salt, and for the bread crumbs I used a mixture of seasoned panko and plain whole wheat crumbs. I basically "eye-balled" the amount of ricotta cheese - figuring 1 container full was 15 oz, so I used approx half a container. Being a tad impatient, I didn't pre-beat the whole egg, just cracked it right into the meat/cheese mixture and folded it in, then folded in the bread crumbs. The mixture smelled good, but looked a little pale before I cooked it. I hand-rolled them, and ended up with 32 balls. To brown them, I used a cast-iron skillet with the olive oil in it. I felt the balls held together pretty well - although after turning them over to brown on all sides, they didn't exactly appear "ball shaped" entirely anymore - but that's fine because they tasted AWESOME! I don't even really like meatballs, but these have reformed me. I used a jarred marinara, did not add water to it (did not want it too thin), baked some sweet Italian sausages in a dutch oven, cut them into the same size as the meatballs, added to the sauce and meatballs, and served over pasta. Well done Chef John! A++

Whoa, these were GOOD!  I wanted to make some mini-meatballs for New Year's Eve, and happened to have some ricotta I wanted to use up so I went with this recipe.  Only change was to use dried Italian herb blend instead of parsley, as I had no fresh parsley.  These meatballs are very tender and a bit fragile while browning, so I ended up not going with the mini idea and just made them "normal" - got 30 meatballs out of this recipe.  Unbelievably tender and delicious!  They just melt in your mouth.  One or two kind of disintegrated in the sauce as they simmered, but we loved the result of having meatballs in a "meat" sauce.  These would be awesome over pasta or slightly mashed in a meatball sandwich...we ate them straight up and loved them!

Yum! Made these almost as written, except I had to substitute the bread crumbs for panko flakes because that's all I had.  I used the course flakes, which I think worked well.  The meatballs were light, tasty and delicious!  A keeper recipe!

My daughter said these were the best meatballs I've ever made!  My husband loved them, also!  I was careful about how much ricotta I used as other reviews were adamant on them falling apart. My grass fed ground beef packages are a bit over a pound, so I used the exact amount of ricotta, added another 1/4 cup of bread crumbs then baked them on parchment for 25 mins turning them halfway through. Perfect!

After reading many of the reviews I chose to follow the recipe, but I increased the seasonings.  Garlic powder, oregano, basil, parsley, black pepper, and most importantly Pecorino Romano grated cheese.  Ya can't make an Italian meatball without it!  And it adds the flavor that was lacking. When I felt how soft the mixture was, I added some bread crumbs. 
I used my own homemade marinara sauce and served the meatballs over fusilli pasta.   I also made some garlic bread and a salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and scallions dressed with a Balsamic Vinegar and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Dessert was Italian Ricotta Cheesecake.  
We enjoyed the addition of ricotta to the meatballs...gave it a nice texture.

I make a banging red sauce and these meat balls are very much worthy of said sauce. I baked rather then pan fry. I roasted my spaghetti squash on the same baking sheet as the meatballs. Both were done in the same cooking time on 400 degrees, on the center rack. I use parchment paper on my baking sheet, no stick no fuss no muss. When the squash was tender the balls were cooked through. I turned the balls once during cooking. I didn't cook the onion and garlic before hand, I was being a lazy cook and just chopped them fine and added to the meat mixture, along with fresh dried basil, and sage, as well as fennel seed. Because we prefer larger meatballs I made mine just a bit bigger then golf balls. I got 10 meat balls, just perfect for us. My sauce and this meat ball recipe were meant to be together and I know have a killer use every time meat ball recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made these as is. My BF loves them and requests them often! The only thing I do different is bake them in the oven in paper egg cartons turning them half way. The carton absorbs the fat and leaves a wonderfully crisp meatball! *tip from AB. Thanks Chef John!

I don't usually rate recipes but these meatballs where the best I've ever made!!! The ricotta really makes these meatballs very tender. The  only thing I did different was to bake on 400 for 25min, turning once to brown, and added about the 1/4 cup of parm. We made meatball subs on sub rolls. Added Mozzarella cheese and put under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese. DELICIOUS!!!!

Too tender, bordering on mushy.  Baked meatballs 20 min and finished in the sauce.  I didn't have any problem with them falling apart.  The flavor was almost there.  When I make them again I'll add some Italian herb seasoning, some parm and more bread crumbs to try and tighten them up a little.  I got 33 meatballs using a 2 TBS cookie scoop.  Definitely needs twice the sauce if using on pasta.  I have been ISO the perfect meatball and this is the closest I've come.  Hopefully with my minor changes, the search will be over.

This was quite good - my husband loved it.  Meatballs so nice & moist.  A couple of hints when browning the meatballs as they are somewhat fragile:  make sure they are well browned before turning and don't use tongs.  I used a small flipper and it worked very well - only had one break on me! We liked the hint of heat with the cayenne too!  We think these would be great as a great meatball sandwich with lots of melted mozzarella cheese on top!!

We haven't had meatballs in ages but this recipe caught my eye. They are so good. Moist, tasty. I did use 1/3 mild Italian sausage meat to the 2/3 very lean hamburger.  Will do it again!!

All I had on hand was spicy italian sausage. I could tell they would be a little fragile, so I added 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. I'm horrible at pan frying, so I baked for 25 minutes @375. They were perfect! Thanks again Chef John!

This is a great recipe. After reading several reviews, i decided to make these meatballs. I fried my meatballs in the pan as recommended. Mine did not stick to the pan as some reviewers mentioned, and i believe that is because i had a hot pan with oil ready. They browned very nicely. Most importantly, as one reviewer stated, make sure that you are only putting 1 cup of the ricotta. The containers never come in 1 cup but 1.5 or more. I measured mine and that is why my meatballs were not falling apart. They retained their shape nicely. Do not crowd the meatballs in the pan. I worked in batches and once all browned i put them back in the pan. For breadcrumbs, i used seasoned Panko which is what i had on hand, and they worked great. Nice and light. Hope you enjoy! (they were a big hit!)

I made these today as written. They were good. I cooked them in small muffin tins 400 degrees 18 min and didn’t have any problem with them falling apart.  I put them in my homemade sauce for 3 hours as well and no issues. Not a fan of Cheyenne pepper, next time I’ll omit it completely or possibly use red pepper flakes. Overall, good meatball. My husband who is anti Italian food enjoyed the meatballs

My Husband LOVED these meatballs. Alot of reviewers baked them, i stuck to frying them first then simmering them for about an hour in Bertollis marinara that was spiced up with sauteed onions and garlic.

What i did to keep the consistency of the meatballs dense enough to not fall apart i got from another reviewer. I made sure there was only a cup of ricotta, i also added parmeasean cheese and when frying make sure they have a nice deep brown color from med-high heat. I also added some of the olive oil from the pan frying to the marinara sauce for taste and it came out almost as good as my homemade sauce that takes half a day to make.

I tried twice to fry these and they fell apart. After reading several reviews I decided to bake them.  Don't over cook them in the oven.  This last batch and the meatballs were the size of golf balls, I  convection baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  I cooked these on a cookie sheet. Didn't have parchment paper.  I intend to make sure I have some for the next time so the meatballs don't stick to the cookie sheet.  This time I allowed the meatballs to simmer in the sauce for at least a half an hour and they were delicious.  So delicious I have decided to make a big pot of these and serve them over pasta at an upcoming family function I am having.  My picky eater grand daughter first loved these mashed up in her pasta, she have now decided she likes to eat them as an actual meatball. She is 4 and this last batch she kept asking me for more meatballs. I think she ate 7--OMG.
I cook spiral pasta because I like the way the sauce and meatball pieces settle into the groves of the spiral versus sitting on top of the pasta.  For people serving this to children, I recommend cutting the pasta in half then putting the sauce and meatballs on the pasta.  The kids can scoop it up with a spoon and they'll love this.  Also, for picky kids who don't like "the green stuff" parsley in their food just omit it.  I also put some fresh shredded parmesanish cheese in my recipe. Thank you Chef John.  These are over the top delicious!

These are good and easy to make. Baked convection 350 for 15 min. I should have flipped them once. Then, put them in sauce. My husband and two year old loved them. Hooray!

8.11.17  I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of baking the meatballs instead of frying.  I love the incredible tenderness that the ricotta brings to the meatballs, and I think you have a lot of options as far as saucing them.  However, I did think that they were a bit soft in texture, so I will try adding  more breadcrumbs next time.  Without adding parmesan, basil, oregano, or Italian seasoning, they’re fairly neutral in flavor, making this recipe very versatile.  I used my homemade marinara sauce today, and even after simmering the meatballs in the sauce, I was longing for more of that Italian flavor in the meatballs.  I know Chef John  has another recipe for baked meatballs (Chef John’s Italian Meatballs) on this site, but I really love the addition of the ricotta.  In the future, if I want to serve with a marinara sauce, I’ll just add some of those Italian seasonings to the meatballs.  These really are delicious moist meatballs, and I certainly will be making them again.

It was really good, but I made a few changes:
1. I baked the meatballs at 450 for 20 minutes flipping them after 10
2. I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne 
3. I didn't add any water to the sauce
4. After meatballs were finished a layered them in a baking casserole dish and layered with a little more ricotta, sauce, and topped with Parmesan cheese and placed back in the oven on warm until heated.

I am surprised that more people have not reviewed this wonderful recipe! These meatballs are brilliant -  they came out very flavorful and super moist, and were quite easy to make. As I always do when first trying a new recipe, I make it exactly as written, with the exception of using a pinch of red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne pepper since 1 of my sons cannot have cayenne. I did not experience any issues with the meatballs falling apart when browning, but that could be due to the following: after mixing the ingredients, I gently formed the meatballs with a scoop, then placed them on a wax paper (parchment would also work) lined tray and put the tray in the fridge until time to brown them (they were in the fridge for about 1 hour). If you don't mind the extra step of chilling the meatballs, it really helps them to hold together while they are cooking without effecting how wonderfully tender they come out.  Going forward, this will be my go to meatball recipe, thank you Chef John.

We loved these meatballs!  Very light and tasty.  I made these with just a couple of changes.  I added some Italian seasoning for added flavor.  My mother-in-law told me years ago that she baked her meatballs in the oven and have done that will all my meatballs ever since.  Just spray a cookie sheet with Pam and bake in a 350 degree oven.  You don't have to turn them, which is especially good with a more delicate meatball.  The length of time you bake depends on the size of your meatballs.

We really liked these meatballs. Very moist and great taste. I did  change the recipe just a little.  I used Italians bread crumbs instead of plain. Next time I will use more because they did fall apart during frying. Frying them gives them excellent flavor.  Also, I skipped the marinara part.  My Italian mother n law would disown me if I didn't make my own gravy sauce, so I do that instead.  Just another great meatball recipe.
Thanks Chef John! I've enjoyed a lot of your recipes.

As noted by others, this recipe is perhaps too moist, resulting in meatballs that are prone to crumble. If I make them again, I will reduce the ricotta and perhaps  use a touch more breadcrumbs.  Tasty but too many fell apart.

These turned out wonderfully for the most part. I too had trouble with breakage while frying these, probably due to the  ricotta. I'd read this was a problem and so I oven-baked half the other 2/3 of the ball and they came out just great.
The pan fried balls were still delicious, just a number of them were not very round anymore. :) The flavor of these is very good. This recipe is enough for 4 meals for just the two of us here. I froze roughly half the oven-roasted ones after they'd cooled. Should be an easy meal to just plop them frozen into some good sauce on a busy night down the road.

Delicious! Love this recipe, and will be making again.  I added some grated parm-reg and a splash of balsamic to complement my sauce, but other than that made to recipe.  Excellent!

To the reviewer that subbed chicken and complained they were bland... well, of course they were.  The recipe is written with seasoning to complement beef.  Chicken meatballs are delicious, but you need to use a different strategy with your seasoning - unjustified 3-star.

Very yummy! I am a novice cook and these meatballs were so simple to make. I followed what a previous reviewer said about baking them and I only lost one meatball out of about 30 to crumbles! I also made my own spaghetti sauce that complimented these well. The only suggestion I have is to cut back on the onions a bit. I had a very strong onion flavor between my sauce and my meatballs and instead of using a whole onion, I may just use half or 3/4. All in all, a fantastic recipe!

I made about 30 meatballs with this recipe. Delicious. I started by attempting to fry them. When I saw that they were too delicate for that (yes, I only used 1 cup of ricotta), I transferred them to a lined cookie sheet and baked them at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes. They were nicely browned. I put them in a pot and added 2 jars of marinara,  simmering for about 45 minutes. Very tasty recipe.

I found this recipe because I had some leftover ricotta that I needed to use up.  I searched for ricotta as an ingredient and this was about the only non-dessert option so I gave it a try even though I really love my Mom's meatball recipe.  It was really good!  I was serving these to onion haters so I used just a little bit of onion, very finely minced (maybe 1/4 c).  I also didn't want to buy parsley just for this, so I used a good sprinkle of dried.  Other than that I followed the ingredient list.  I didn't want to make a mess of my cooktop so I just put the meatballs in the oven.  I was a little freaked out by the color of the raw meatballs and I was a tad worried that the garlic was a little too raw and strong, but all the flavors came together nicely.  I still like my Mom's meatballs the best, but if you don't have a Mom with a great meatball recipe or if you have a bunch of ricotta to use up, these are great.

This is unbelievably delicious!  I followed the recipe and it was pretty easy!  I started to get worried because the meatballs do start to fall apart in the pan but I'd say 80% held their shape.  It was no big deal because it was like adding meat to my husbands homemade marinara.  I can easily say these were the best meatballs I've ever had, let alone made!  We are a huge fan of Chef John and his awesome videos!

I followed the recipe exactly (except for the cayenne pepper).  They were not fragile at all and very easy to cook in the non-stick skillet.  Amazing recipe and to top it off, my daughter was using this recipe for her school cooking project!  Amazing!

First time to review, but I have made many of chef John's recipes and this was one of my favorites along with his marinara sauce from this site. I did make changes based on the reviews in that I added 1/4 cup grated parmesan reggiano, one teaspoon dried Italian seasonings, reduced the ricotta to 3/4 of a cup and increased the bread crumbs to 1/2 of a cup and I used dried Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Carefully and partially pan fried till brown, even with my changes they are delicate and with the cheese they brown or burned easily so be careful, they were getting too brown( I made mine a little bigger than he suggested, so they took longer to cook) so I finished them off in the oven at 400 for 10 minutes on parchment paper sprayed with Pam, then simmered in the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes. I did not add the 1 cup of water to the sauce, since I made the sauce from scratch I adjusted the thickness to my liking. My changes were minor and I hope I did not change the integrity of the recipe, but it came out absolutely perfect.  His marinara sauce was also extremely amazing and complemented the meatballs very well.  I will never buy jarred again. I stuck to that recipe almost 100% except that I used balsamic vinegar, and due to some fussy eaters used a hand blender to puree it.  That sauce is like crack ??

LOVED these meatballs.  I paired them with wheat sub bread and made meatball subs with swill cheese melted in the bread.  OMG mouthwatering goodness.  Will make these again.

I've made this recipe a few times now.  I've made several other meatball recipes and they were all good.  Since I found this recipe, my husband always requests I make the meatballs with ricotta cheese recipe.  They are tender and moist and I usually double the recipe so I can freeze some to use later.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

These are AMAZING! They are delicious and tender. In fact, they are so moist and tender I use Chef John’s “World’s Fastest Meatball” method to cook them and it works just perfectly. Thank you Chef John for your humor and making me a much better cook ;D

Here's what I did.  I used 93% fat free meat because of my husband's dietary needs.  I doubled the recipe, except the Italian herbs (brain-fart, there);  but used the right amount of kosher salt. I used half ground flax seed and half bread crumbs trying to make it a tad more healthy.   I made huge meatballs, using an ice cream scoop instead of a melon scoop because that's what I had available.  I cooked it in the Power Air Fryer on 370 for 15 minutes, rotated the two racks and added an additional 10 minutes, then cooked it in the spaghetti sauce for another 5 minutes.  The sauce I used was Sam's Choice Pasta Sauce with Cherry Tomatoes and Grilled Vegetables.

I wasn't expecting them to come out super moist because of the flax seed and the amount of fat in the meat; but it was amazingly delicious.  Definitely needs the full amount of herbs called for in the recipe - I will not make that mistake again.  It tasted salty to me, but everyone else thought it was perfect (I am not a huge salt person).  It cooked very nicely in the air fryer and the sauce was a perfect match.  Loved the taste of the meatballs even with the mistakes and changes I made; It's a very forgiving recipe.  Will definitely make this again and again and again.  Thank you, Chef John.

Excellent recipe. Too bad that some people don't carefully follow the recipe. There is 1 cup of Ricotta, not a tub full!  
I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I used a tablespoon scoop and it yielded 38 balls. I flash froze 2/3 of them and then put them into a freezer bag for later use as we are a small family. Thanks for this recipe! Good with ground chicken as well, if you want more healthy....

Very easy and very good.  I baked them in the oven, as other reviewers suggested.  I will make them again, and I'll add more spice, just personal taste.

Very bland meatballs and a bit too soft for my liking.  Followed directions exactly. Didn't have issues like others with it falling apart. I just didn't feel it had good flavor. I think maybe adding some parmesan in the recipe, more pepper, and maybe putting a bit of ricotta/mozzarella filling in the middle of the meatball instead of mixed in would have been better. It was ok and easy to make, but I won't make it again.

This is my favorite meatball recipe. We’ve made this several times and always get rave reviews. My one change is to bake the meatballs instead of frying - 400* for 25-30 minutes and they are perfect!

Listen to the reviews that say the meatballs fall apart in the skillet. Bake them instead. Then add to sauce. I know have a great meat sauce but no meatballs lol.

These meatballs were delicious, though a little more fragile than the meatballs I'm used to making. They're well worth the delicate treatment they require.

Followed recipe as stated however I did use a lean ground beef to help keep it firm. I didn’t want to lose the creaminess by reducing the ricotta cheese. I also made larger meatballs which I preferred and Served with a tomato basil sauce and Angel Hair pasta. It turned out delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

Love these, they are very light.  I was careful when browning because I could see they would fall apart.   Next time I may brown in the oven as others suggest.   Several changes, I did not add onion or garlic to the meatballs because I thought it would change the delicate ricotta flavor, we did not miss it.  I used Trader Joe's Basil Marinara sauce, added leftover canned chopped tomoatoes and omitted the water because we like thicker sauce.  These were a hit in my home and will make again.

Amazing. Doubled the recipe so as to have plenty leftover to freeze for easy future meals. Doubled it made more than fifty 1 1/2" to 2"meatballs. Baked on rack on baking sheet at 350 for 25 minutes, then simmered in homemade marinara for about 15 mins while I cooked the spaghetti.

These are some excellent meatballs. The only problem is they are so light it's easy to eat too many of them...
I added some oregano because, well, they are meatballs, and omitted the parsley because I don't think it adds anything meaningful. They are delicate in the frying pan so I think I will try baking next time

I added Italian seasoning and instead of cayenne pepper I used crushed red pepper. If you have this particular sauce in your area or have access to Amazon try Guglielmos marinara or rustic or spicy sauce

This was very good as are all of Chef John's recipes. He's my fav. I cooked meatballs in the oven as others recommended as well as on the stovetop. The oven ones did hold up better. I used part-skim ricotta because I needed to use it up, and added a bit of italian spices as well. My husband said we should add it to the rotation which is hilarious since he also says he never gets to see the same food more than once. Guess I should have a rotation especially for something so easy and tasty.

This recipe turned out the best meatballs I’ve ever had!!  I put on some parm. Cheese and I baked them in the oven 350 for 25 minutes.  After they baked, I put them in my own homemade sauce.

I had some ricotta cheese to use up and found this recipe. This is quite tasty, I did add a little extra cayenne and a few hot peppers, my husband and I like spicy food. I also cooked them in the oven rather than fry them. This makes a lot of meatballs, I think it would make a really good meatloaf, which I will try at a later date. With the leftovers, I cooked up some linguine, chopped up the meatballs, added extra sauce, put it in a casserole, grated cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan and baked it the oven. MMM

Holy crow! These are so easy and tasty. I used half beef, half hot Italian sausage and rolled them into 8 big meatballs. I baked them for about 30 mins, turning once, on a baking rack in a 375 degree oven. I used plain Panko for the breadcrumbs too!

These were unlike any meatball I've ever had before... wow. I had some homemade ricotta that I wanted to use and since I try to avoid red meat but was making meatballs, I decided to go the baking route. I doubled the ingredients and made larger meatballs, which I baked at 400 degrees for 18 minutes. Meanwhile I had a fresh vegetable tomato sauce cooking (garlic, onion, carrot, celery and red pepper with homemade fire roasted tomatoes). When the meatballs' time was up I put them in the sauce to cook for another 20 minutes while the tomato sauce toned down. 

Seriously, these were amazing: smooth, creamy, a bit like the filling of some good caneloni bolognese... yum. So, if you are going to make these, consider that they are a treat for guests you'd like to impress:

Thanks, chef John. These were uber!

Oh, just a small tip: careful when turning these in the tomato sauce. They are fragile :)

These meatballs were fantastic! The ricotta makes all the difference. I followed the recipe (except for the cayenne) and they came out great. Loved the mild flavor and so soft- not dry at all!!

Because CJ hasn't steered me wrong yet, I made these for the first time today--a double batch even! Most of them I par-baked in preparation for the freezer, the rest I did as directed. I thought they were amazing, my kids agreed, but my hubby thought they were just "OK". (He slicked them up quick though, so he might be being a smart-alec.) I'm giving them 4 stars though, because while the flavor was excellent, they didn't hold up very good in the pan, maybe it's because I didn't use a non-stick skillet? And also because the cup of water added to the sauce made it too watery--still delicious, but I expected it to mostly cook off and it didn't. Overall, these are minor things, and I'll definitely be adding these to the "make again" pile.

AMAZING!! Both my picky husband and my picky self thought these were some of the best meatballs we have ever eaten.  I only had 3/4 cup of ricotta so used 1/4 cup lowfat cottage cheese for the difference; it didn't seem to affect the taste. Served with roasted spaghetti squash which worked really well. Yet  another Chef John winner.

Super tasty and moist meatballs.  It's my "Go To" meatball dish.  My husband requests this dish regularly.   The only change I made to to cut the water added in half to create a thicker sauce.  Yum.  Thanks Chef John for yet another delicious recipe.

Delicious I had no problems with them sticking or falling apart. I pan fried and then simmered in my slow cooker for 2 hours. I added fennel and oregano and skipped the parsley.

These are delicious and I have made them three times. I cut back a small amount of the ricotta cheese based on other comments that they fell apart while cooking and they were perfect. Instead of a tomato sauce I made a mustard cream sauce which was perfect. Chef John is the best!

I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef, kept the ricotta and egg amount as written but used just 2 cloves of garlic and a shake of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. I try not to eat carbs so I left out the bread crumbs and honestly it didn't look like they were needed. Instead of parsley I added oregano and basil. I cooked small amounts of the meat mixture in a skillet so I could taste it and ended up adding 1 teaspoon salt. 

Instead of meatballs I made 6 mini meat loaves, placed them on parchment paper in a baking pan with a rim and topped them with a little ketchup. I baked them for 25 minutes, (pouring off the grease once), topped with some grated fresh parmesan and baked them a couple more minutes until the cheese melted. 

Everyone enjoyed them, even the 7 year old said they were "almost good". Since he hates ground beef in any form this was quite a success. I'll use this recipe again as a basis for meat balls or loaves. The ricotta kept them very moist and tender.

Great tasting meatballs!!! I followed the recipe exactly and they held together well. These meatballs are tender, tasty,  and perfect over spaghetti or Angel hair type pasta. I made it again the other day, but didn't have dry breadcrumbs so I used regular bread instead that I hadn't dried completely. The meatballs didn't hold together once I added the marinara sauce to them,  so we had great tasting ground beef sauce over our pasta.  So far, these have been our favorite meatballs.

This was hit!  The meatballs are moist and flavorful.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.   My family likes larger meatballs so I increased the size and still easily got about 20 in the pan.  This will be my new go to for spaghetti night!

I love Chef John, and have been following his recipes for years now. I love his recipes and humor ! However, this one was very underwhelming and bland. As I was frying the meatballs they fell apart and did not hold together well. Not one of the best.

These were really yummy! We eat a lot of ground venison at our house and meatballs are usually dry but the ricotta made a huge difference. I did add some Parmesan and I baked instead of fried them but otherwise followed the recipe. Will make again.

Warning!  I changed up this recipe.  Im sure its fine the way its written but i only had a 1/4 cup of ricotta cheese and pickings were not so good in my fridge so this is what i did.  Along with the ricotta i had on hand i also used a cup of mozarella and few tablespoons of heavy cream.  It worked great!  I also added a 1/4 of a red pepper diced and a teaspoon on oregano and garlic.  I pan fried some for one of my boys ( thats the way he likes them)  I rolled the rest of them and dropped them into my homemade sauce.  Yum.  The best ones  I've ever made.  Thanks to the recipe it made the perfect foundation for some of my additions.

I followed the directions exactly and even added a bit more of the pasta water in the end. The meatballs couldn't have come out any better. Perfectly tender and perfectly delicious. My husband really liked them as well and he is a tough critic.

The meatballs were fantastic. Tasty and as tender as promised. Definately the tenderest meat balls I have ever had. I found the sauce a little thin. I am not sure if it's because we don't get the brand recommended in South Africa or not. next time a bit less water.

The best, and I have been trying to achieve the perfect meatball for years. My one change is I roast  them in the oven at 375 for about  20 minutes, and then add them to sauce with a generous  rind of very good parmesiano and let them simmer for a generous bit. Just yummy.

I made these meatballs & they were definitely a hit with my more than picky husband. I also made a batch following recipe using mild italian sausage instead of grn beef, these were a bigger hit & will be giving some to my daughter for her familys opinion on which they prefer. Thanks for a great recipe

I as well put in 1/4 cup of parm,  fresh basil, Italian season, crushed red pepper & extra cayenne pepper.  Baking is so easy at 350 for 25 minutes!  Last 5 minutes topped with mozz & parm cheese to make a crush on top.

Love these meatballs!  I've made them twice and the only difference was the second time I cooked them in the oven.  Although a few of them fell apart in the pan when cooking them on the stove it made the sauce thick and meaty to serve over pasta.  We used them for meatball sammies the second time so cooking them in the oven worked out better.  They tasted great though and I will make them

We used ground chicken in place of the beef, but kept all other ingredient amounts the same. Baked the meatballs @ 350 F for 25-30 minutes (flipped half way through cooking time). Was a little nervous seeing the other reviews about them being fragile in frying, but think ours would have held up fine. The result was moist and delicious meatballs....so delicious we just want to keep eating them!

Loved them!  Even better the next day!  They'd make some great Italian meatball subs.  Also easy.....I liked that they finished cooking in the sauce and you didn't have to stand there frying them until they were done.

Made these for dinner tonight and will definitely  make them again. Easy to make and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to add the cup of water at the end, but they still turned out great.

Followed the recipe but doubled it for feeding a crowd.  The ricotta made parts of the meatballs burn and made them too rich tasting to eat - and when  we had leftovers the next day they had basically disintegrated into the sauce.  A lot of work and extra cost for a big disappointment. I'll continue to use my regular meatball recipe.

Second time that I made this recipe. The first time it was too sticky so this time I reduce the ricotta cheese to a 3/4 cup and I added 2 tbsp. More of the bread crumbs. The result; perfect meatballs. The flavor always was good and the meatballs tender.

Very simple and tasty. The meatballs did fall apart very easily while cooking, so I ended up mashing most of them into the spaghetti sauce. I would definitely make this dish again!

Followed the recipe exactly as Chef John has never failed me.  These were delicious!  I'm not a big fan of meatballs but needed to add something different to the family menu and these did not disappoint.  About half my meatballs didn't quite make it though, I used those to dip French bread into so it worked out.  Maybe I will bake them next time??  Beware of the jarred marinara sauce you use, if the sauce isn't tasty it's going to obviously ruin the outcome of these delicious meatballs!  Thanks again Chef John!

Do yourself a favor and make this exactly as written. Chef John hits another one out of the park! Instead of serving this over noodles, I served it in bowls and dipped in chunks of  Italian bread. Highly recommended!

Wow, Chef John FTW! These were so good. Since I used extra lean ground beef, I skipped the paper towel step, then used a little less water with the sauce. Turned out perfectly!

These were delicious.  My only suggestions would be 1) instead of flying them in a pan, line a cookies sheet with parchment paper and bake them for 10 minutes at 400 degrees and 2) DOUBLE THE RECIPE!!!   We started pan frying them and they started to fall apart each time we turned them.  Baking is easier and most likely healthier.  They are yummy!

These were good, then again, they were Chef John's so that was to be expected:)  A little labor intensive I am not going to lie and slightly soggy for my taste.  Might cut back the ricotta cheese next time.  I will also up the cayenne pepper  as I personally like a little extra heat.  Over all very good and will make again.

My husband and I both loved it! I added Italian seasoning and 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese in addition to the herbs recommended in the recipe. I also baked it in the oven at 425 for 15-20 minutes, turning once, and then simmered in the marinara sauce while cooking the pasta.

A little bland but to be fair I didn't have any cayenne.   I might mix in a little sausage  next time.  Nice texture.  I didn't feel the need to blot the grease, but probably owing to the fact I used very lean ground sirloin.  I will make again.  Really starting to pay attention to this Chef John guy ; )

The meatballs came out nice and moist. The flavor was not quite up to my liking, so I added some Italian season to satisfy my taste buds. I will cook them again.

I made these with just a few tweaks, I eliminated the breadcrumbs, added about a 1/3 of a cup of locatelli grated cheese, and baked them for about 10-15 mins . I then placed them in a slow cooker with tomato sauce covering and cooked for about 4hrs on low..... absolute deliciousness!

Meatballs supreme.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Many of the meatballs fell apart but meatballs and consequently meat sauce were absolutely delicious

I made these exactly as the recipe outlines.  I fried them in my large le creuset skillet on medium/low.  They browned perfectly but as I carefully tried to turn each meatball, they split apart.  That was disappointing.  They are flavorful.  I think they are too delicate to fry and really wished I had baked them as others did.  Next time, I will add 1/2 lb more ground beef.  I feel that was lacking in comparison to the 1 cup ricotta and 1/3 bread crumbs.  That would make the meatball texture a bit more substantial.

Amazing. I have a meatball connoisseur in the house and he gave me a solid nod and held his thumb up for an unusually long time. I'm Italian so breaking away from my traditional recipe was outside my comfort zone but I will definitely make these again. Contrary to how I was raised, I like to bake my meatballs and freeze the extras. I follwed the recipe exactly, including frying before adding to sauce because I wasn't sure if they would hold up since they are so tender.  But these are good enough that even if my variations fail, it will make great meat sauce. Thank you!

Excellent but I beg to differ. I think Americans put these in sandwich rolls more so than on spaghetti. Either way they are delicious.

These meatballs are wonderful.  The only negative is that they are had to cook.  This is not a recipe for a beginner.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very cautious to use the exact quantity of ingredients called for.  Even so, the meatballs were very soft and difficult to brown.  I managed to loose a few in the process.  However, they just became part of the marinara sauce and were not for nothing.  Next time I think I will go for 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to see if that will help some.  I feel the recipe is more for 6 servings rather than 8 which  pushes the calorie count to about 440 per serving.

As another reviewer stated it was a bit bland. I spiced it up, made a tiny one to see how it would taste and it still needed to be kicked up. I love the concept, but two eggs would have held the meatballs together much better. I'd try it again with these and other's suggestions.

These turned out great...we loved the taste and texture of the ricotta.  The only thing I did differently was to bake the meatballs @ 375 until they browned.  I then finished them with the sauce in my slow cooker.  I think this solved the problem some people had with them falling apart.  Will definitely make these again.

Good recipe and fairly easy. Be sure to mix everything thoroughly for even cooking.  I guess the one cup of water is for drinking....he doesn't mention how to use it in the recipe.  One cup of wine to drink would be better!

I made it with no changes. When cooking the meat balls they started to fall apart when turning. Adjustments have to be made to make them more firm.

OMG so tender!  Great for meatball sandwiches.  Nice and soft to spread them on bread!  I did not fry mine.  I cooked in oven at 400 degrees  for 40 minutes. Perhaps they were not as crunchy on outside but perfect for my needs.  Will definitely make them again!

Definitely a keeper. Easy to put together, great texture and browned up without falling apart! Maybe I'll kick-up the garlic next time. Served on Ciabatta roll topped with mozzarella. Rave reviews in this household! Oh, and since I had some mushrooms, added to the marinara sauce.

The Ricotta made the meatballs very soft, which is somewhat enjoyable because nobody wants a hard meatball, but some of them turned the sauce into meat sauce.  Was tasty but I don't know if I would make it again.

My first meatballs!  I made them twice and I'll do them again! This recipe is delicious and easy. I used Prego Farmers Market Classic Marinara sauce, and italian seasoning breadcrumbs. This recipe yields 15 to 20 meatballs.  I am in love with them! ?

Great meatballs. Very moist. I fried some like it said and baked the other half. I think the ones I baked for 20 min  in oven instead are better.

My daughter shared this recipe with me at her house. Oh my, these are the best meatballs I have ever eaten! We use ground turkey and they could not be any better! She swaps out the sauce for sautéed onion, garlic and mushrooms sauce instead of Marinara sauce. These are the only ones I wil make from now on. Oh and we baked them instead of frying. P.S. I have been cooking for nearly 50 years and make lots of Italian foods.

made these today very flavorful and a big hit even with my 10 year old son the only changes I had to add more bread crumbs due to the fact that the meatballs kept falling apart and added some Italian blend grated cheese for flavor

I doubled the recipe, used half meatloaf mix, half grass-fed ground beef. Otherwise, I followed the meatball portion as directed.  For the sauce, I used half Barilla marinara, half a can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes, and added some fresh basil. Next time, I will add some Parmesan to the meatball mix.  This recipe is a keeper, we all loved it!

The meatballs were very tender and delicious! I used a cookie scoop to form the meatballs and cooked them on lined cookie sheets in the oven on convection to brown them up. Much easier than frying them in a pan. I then returned them to the pan I sauteed the onions in & added a 3 cheese marinara sauce. Next time I will probably use my homemade marinara, but using a quality jarred sauce made it a fairly quick meal. I served the meatballs with spaghettini and grated Asiago cheese. YUM!

The only thing I changed was that I browned the meatballs then baked them for 20 mins in the oven.  I really enjoyed the tenderness  if the meat. Instead of putting it on spaghetti , I put them on  garlic bread for meatball sandwiches... for the Super Bowl crowd.

Delicious! I ended up baking the meatballs in the oven then adding them to my sauce and they turned out great and didn't fall apart.

I did have some of the meatballs come apart while cooking but when the meal finished all I can say is if I had bought this at a restaurant I would put that restaurant  as one of my best. I will use this recipe many times

I loved the flavor, only problem I found was they were to delicate when I fried them, some of them had a tendency to fall apart, I wonder if adding more breadcrumbs would help, I also used a pork,veal and beaf mixture. Would definetly make them again??

Excellent recipe. I made the meatballs a head of time, placed in fridge till the evening, and baked them in the over as suggested by other readers. 375 for 20 minutes.  I served this over spaghetti squash. It was delicious and reheats well too.

Delicious meatballs indeed. The ricotta cheese makes the meatballs so moist and flavorful. Instead of simmering the meatballs in jar marinara, I made my own homemade spaghetti sauce for it. Superb!

My husband was very enthusiastic about the taste of the meatballs. The only change I made was I always substitute panko for bread crumbs. The ricotta cheese made the difference. Other meatballs don't have the moist melt in your mouth feel to it. i used some noodles. Next time I will try the rice noodles as we use a lot of those. I did add some more spice to the sauce. A cajun spice and a hot BBQ dried herb. I use oil to roll the meatballs out. I find they don't stick as much to the pan I am cooking them in. I will make it again. Oh, and I did not use any water. Unless your sauce is very thick, I don't think it needed it. Very nice!

Funny story.  I made these exactly as written.  I thought they were only ok ...however my son and husband said they were the best meatballs EVER and that I HAVE to make them again. Funny how everyone has different tastebuds.  I will definitely make it again, though! I think sautéing the onion and garlic is what puts it over the top.

I always read reviews but this time I didn't. Really wish I had! Just finished frying the meatballs in my cast iron skillet and it was a disaster. I had to do in batches, the meatballs fell apart and the skillet was way too greasy (and small)  to use for the sauce portion of cooking. They smell amazing and I'll make again but only if I follow the advice and bake them instead of frying!

Wonderful and so tender.  I used white meat ground chicken and it was delicious! They are very fragile, especially using chicken or turkey so roll them in your hands before putting in the pan to saute.  I can imagine just scooping them would be a mess. I use more sauce and they make great sandwiches the next day!  Actually, I eat them right from the pan and no pasta or bread!

Another tasty Chef John recipe! Only thing I did differently was bake them at 450 for 20 minutes.  No issues with them falling apart.

I made this tonight.  it was good.  I don't like onions so I used onion powder. I also left out the breadcrumbs.  I mixed the ricotta with one egg, frozen herb Italian mix (basil,  oregano,  basil), garlic paste and onion powder.  I then mixed in 80/20 ground beef. pan seared on both sides, then added my sauce and baked at 350 for 40 minutes .... it was moist and delicious and low carb!

Turned out beautifully with a wonderful flavor. The only problem was that are are a bit mushy neccessitating my browning them in my deep fryer instead of in a pan.

I made these as directed except I used fat free ricotta cheese instead of the whole milk ricotta. The meatballs held together but I had to be very gentle with them so they didn't fall apart.

EUREKA!!   I finely found a fabulous MEATBALL recipe!!  Woo hoo!  I made exactly as written but instead of pan cooking them I put them on a cake rack on a baking pan in the oven set at  375 degrees F. for like 30 minutes. I love these meatballs!!   Thank you Chef John!

These do take a little longer than other meatballs, but I can assure you (at least for my own preference), it is definitely worth the wait. The first time I made these, the meatballs fell apart in the sauce, and so I just had really good meatsauce, but as I'm learning to be more gentle while stirring, I have no problem keeping them together. 

This is easily one of my favorite meals, as well as it retains it's tradition of the family favorite spaghetti and meatballs. I would recommend this if you're interested in trying it. :)

The ricotta makes them soft alright, too soft to fry easily. Instead of ricotta, try using a small amount of parmigiana cheese. They stay firmer in the frying pan, and just as flavorful.

As another recommended, I added oregano, thyme,  ground mustard, basil, and Parmesan cheese.  I do not like to pan fry meatballs. So I rolled meatballs about 1 tbsp each. Baked for 20-25 minutes at 400.  I would adjust time up or down depending on size and fat/lean content. I have no clue what the water in the recipe is needed for, so I didn't bother with it. It was a nice change to an everyday meatball.  Personally I do not see using ground turkey for this recipe. The ricotta does change the texture.

This turned out soooo well. I was surprised at how much flavor these meatballs had (not that chef john has ever let me down). I used the suggested Bertolli Original Marinara Sauce, I could only find a 24 oz can. The only thing I had to change was the cheese. I only had half a cup of Ricotta in the fridge so I added shredded creamy Havarti to make up for the rest. It was awesome. This makes a lot of meatballs. I'm only feeding two of us so next time I will half the recipe. As well if you are making the full recipe for a family make sure you have a huge pan or at least two big pans.  I had to split up my meatballs between two large pans to brown the meatballs then halfed the Bertolli and water between the two. Turned out wonderfully and was very filling.  A few of my meatballs broke apart but most of them stayed together.

I didn't have Ricotta so I used Greek Yogurt instead, draining the liquid off. I baked my meatballs in the oven 350 degrees for 1 hr. (made my meatballs large). I added 15.7 oz. of Red Gold Petite diced tomatoes with the marinara sauce.  This is YUMMIE! This will now be my go to recipie!

I've made this recipe several times and always served it as an appetizer using a quick sauce made with San Marzano tomatoes. I also offer as a topping on the side thin strands of orange peel made with my zyliss zester. 

As a tip, I always make a slider to test my seasoning before committing to rolling balls and I always brown in a fry pan and finish in the oven on a cookie sheet beforehand. I add them to the sauce as needed when serving at an event.

I followed this recipe exactly, got to making the meatballs, put them in the pan and they didn't hold their shape at all. They just became a mushy mess, so I just turned it into a meat sauce. Wasn't very flavorful, wouldn't make them again.

These meatballs are amazing and the best that I have ever made! I followed the recipe almost to the letter except that I adjusted the spices to our tastes (more garlic, added garlic powder, used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs, and added oregano). I had no difficulty with them falling apart. I do agree with one of the other reviewers, it is important to measure the ricotta. Also, adding the 1 cup of water to the marinara does not thin out your sauce as it reduces over the 30 minute cook time. I did add some shredded mozzarella cheese in the middles when I was rolling them for a burst of melted cheese surprise when we cut and bit into them. My husband loved them and we will definitely make them again!

Sorry! I don't want to be a Debbie Downer but this the only recipe of Chef John that I did not rave about. I baked as several people suggested. I don't think that was problematic as they were cooked beautifully. The main issue for me was the flavour. I added a small amount of Italian spice blend, extra cayenne, red pepper flakes and parmesan and found them to be kind of bland. I can honestly say that I probably won't be making these again.

Pretty easy as far as meatballs go and far better than average for flavor!
 I did learn one important detail and that is to have the meat balls made and in the pan before it goes on the hot burner- my bad.  My first batch got a little done on one side.  I also found myself shaking the pan lightly like you do for popcorn to keep them from sticking.  Second batch was perfect!

I followed the recipe except baked the meatballs at 425 degrees for 15-20 min.  Worked great!  Next time I might add a little more garlic to up the flavor.  Overall, great meatball recipe!

I've never made meatballs with ricotta in them before. These were very good and can be used with anything from Italian gravy...see I know the word...to Swedish meatballs. I baked mine on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Freezing is a great idea!

The only thing I did different was use Italian seasoned bread crumbs because that was what I had and added some Parmesan cheese. Fantastic!

These were delicious. The only thing I would change is the amount of kosher salt. I used half of what the recipe called for and it was perfectly seasoned. For me anyway.

After reading the reviews, I decided to bake the meatballs in a baking dish lightly brushed with olive oil.  After they were browned, I removed the excess grease and poured the sauce over the meatballs and back into the oven they went.  It worked out great.   They are very delicate and good, but could use more seasoning for our tastes.

I made this exactly as written except substituted crackers for the bread crumbs, only because I didn't have them on hand. Also, I baked them in a 425 F degree oven for 20-25 mins on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil and sprayed with canola oil. They are amazing so tender and moist! I made a double batch, the first night served with spaghetti, and the second night on toasted sub sandwiches with mozzarella, they are even better the second day!

I accidentally forgot the egg and it still turned out great! Use crushed red peppers instead of cayenne. I also didn't cook the meatballs in oil. Just used a nonstick skillet.

My husband said they were the best meatballs he has ever had.  I thought they were wonderful!  The only thing I would do differently is that some of them fell apart and became somewhat of a meat sauce instead, which was still great, but I didn't roll or pack them together tightly, which I will do next time.  Great flavor.
