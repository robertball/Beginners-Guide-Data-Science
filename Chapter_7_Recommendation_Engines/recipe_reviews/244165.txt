This is definitely an easy and fast treat to put together made with ingredients that I always have on hand. It also bakes in no time, so as a last minute crave-buster, this is a winner. I halved the sugar because I couldn't see why it needed so much and still thought it was too sweet. I used coconut sugar. One-half tsp of almond extract is too much in my opinion. In the future, I will use 1/4 tsp of almond extract, or may even leave it out all together because it overpowers the flavour of the almond meal. It is cake-like so it goes very well with a tea. And when you think I made it while I prepared my tea it tells you how quickly it comes together. Thank you HealthyRecipeNut for your recipe.

Oh, my Heavens!  I would give this delicious recipe 10 stars if I could.  First, the recipe is so simple.  Second, these cookies taste just like Italian Almond cookies, which I love!  (Even my very fussy husband thinks so.)  Third, they are the perfect cookie to bring to the hostess of a party I'm attending because she has celiac disease and these are gluten-free.  I watched the video and noticed that the egg white is beaten with the electric mixer until fluffy, although that is not mentioned in the written recipe.  Then the sugar and almond extract are added.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but that's what I did.  Finally, the almond flour is folded in.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use white sugar because I didn't have any coconut sugar.  I will definitely make these again--often.  Next time I'm going to try making them with Swerve so that they're carb-free, too.

Really very good, I didn't have coconut sugar so I used honey.  If you use honey, use less honey then called for.

I doubled the recipe for a thicker cookie/bar and used white sugar instead of coconut sugar (which I did not have).  Everybody raved over these. I'd say they are addicting!

I will try again, perhaps multiplying the recipe by 4 to make it thicker in that 8x8 pan!  We all loved it, but nobody had nearly enough!

It was fairly easy to blend everything but I found it kind of bland. Some of my friends love them. I think I would add another egg, add another 1/2 cup flour and a 1/2 cup of Dutch cocoa if I make it again.

I'm hoping I did something terribly wrong because most of the reviews were great while mine will be horrible.  I doubled the recipe but only used half the coconut sugar. The result was a crumble like texture that was extremely dry. I used cupcake papers instead of the 8X8 pan hoping to keep everything together but it didn't work and the final result was garbage can worthy. It smelled wonderful in the oven but it needed more moisture for it to hold its form.  Once it cooled I tipped the cupcake paper to the side and the hard crumbles just started rolling out......ugh. Picture posted.

Yum! Use heaping spoonful of honey instead of coconut sugar and add Chia seeds. Make 'em with my toddler---he loves it!

This was very good- reminiscent of the flavor of Dutch almond tarts.

Thin is no joke!  I had some trouble spreading the batter into an 8x8 pan, it was so thin! I couldn't get my batter to the edges so I just left it lol.  they did turn out delicious though and are easy and quick to make! The almond extract is somewhat strong in this,but I liked it :). will make again!!

I doubled the recipe and found it quite sweet.I did not use parchment paper and it stuck to the pan in the centre that I oiled with avocado oil. Got about 16 pieces. My husband liked them. Will make again.

I made these almond cookies and they tasted great!  I do have a question.....Is there something I can do to keep them from sticking to the parchment paper?  I lose a lot of the cookie that way.

I doubled the recipe and coked them for 35 minutes.  Maybe not long enough as they were gummy and didn't cut very well.used sucanat sugar.  Very sweet.  They will fix your sweet tooth but don't look good enough to serve.

I love love love almonds so was so happy to find this recipe.  I quadrupled the recipe and used only half a cup of brown sugar.  This made it just sweet enough for my taste!  I just spread it on parchment paper in a baking sheet and baked for 35 min. Careful not to spread the edges too thin as it will burn easily.

I made these last night. Tasted great! I used about 1/16cup less coconut sugar. Next time I will use parchment muffin liners and 1/8th cup coconut sugar.

This is an awesome cookie!! The only thing I did different is I grounded strawberry flavored almonds instead of using almond flour.. They taste is great! Easy and quick to whip together. Thanks for the awesome recipe!
