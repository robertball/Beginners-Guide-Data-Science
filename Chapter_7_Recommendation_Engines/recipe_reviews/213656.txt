I tried this because I wanted something different & new for my boneless chicken breasts.  And my husband is a "comfort food" style eater.  So I thought he'd like it.  It was delicious!!  Because the chicken breasts are coated really good, they are so moist and tender!  I always cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise.  Makes them easier to eat, shorter to cook & always moist.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  Only difference, I cooked for about 20 minutes at 375.  And that was plenty of time.  Because the chicken was sliced thinner.  My husband loved it!  So did our son!  Thanks for the recipe!

The cooking temperature is far too high.  After the topping started to burn at 450 degrees after about 10 mins, I dropped the oven down to 350 for the remaining time.  375 for 30-35 mins is probably a better setting.  Also, I would change the topping by eliminating the bread crumbs at really crushing the Cheez-its.  You can always add a little dried herb to get the flavor from the italian bread crumbs.

I made this chicken for dinner tonight, and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  He named it "Cheez-It Chicken" :-) It was fast and easy, which made for a great weeknight meal. My only problem was that the topping got slightly burnt in places in the 450 degree oven uncovered. I suppose next time I should lower my temp a little bit.   It still tasted great, and I will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

For years  I have been using buttermilk instead of an egg wash to make my chicken cutlets.  It is low-fat and the crumbs stick onto the cutlet better.  The finished product is moist and has a subtle tang from the buttermilk.   In this recipe I would use buttermilk instead of mayo to lower the fat content.

This turned out amazing!! I threw the crackers and onions in my food processor and everything was ready so quickly. A great, fast dinner. The chicken turned out so moist! My only problem is I ended up with WAY too many bread crumbs. Next time I will probably half the ingredients. Still definitely an A+ recipe! Thanks!

Made this last night to try something different.  It was really good and the coating stayed on really well.  I would have cut the Cheez Its and increased the fried onions a bit.  I also mixed half mayo and half brown mustard for a little extra flavor.  Will definitely make it again!

Very good  I baked at 375 for 25 - 30 minutes turning them over once half way thru baking.  Tender and juicy/moist.  I lightly floured the chicken then used an egg wash then the crumbs.  (Not a mayo person)  Kids love these when cut into nugget sizes and served with honey for a dipping sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.  Great on fish such as perch etc.

This was pretty good.  I put the crackers and french-fried onions in the food processor to crush then mixed with panko italian seasoned bread crumbs and the rest of the breading seasonings.  I pounded my chicken breasts flat before the mayo and breading.  I should have cooked these for only 30 min. as mine came out just a bit dry due to the high cooking temp. and having pounded mine thin.  Very tasty tho and had a wonderful crispy crust.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing Chefbound!

I tried this recipe tonight and the family was all raves.  I used Parmesan Wheat Thins and lowered the temperature to 400, at 40 minutes there were already some burn spots on the crust.  I will cook this again and probably drop the temp to 350 which is where I normally bake chicken.

After reading multiple reviews with suggestions, there were minimal things that I changed. I wouldn't feel right about completely changing the recipe, then giving less than 5 stars! The one, awesome tip that I got from some of the reviews was to use the food processor to crush the crackers and the onions. Works like a charm, and I saved so much time by doing it that way! The only things that I changed was left out the sesame seeds from the breading, and used 1 1/2 cups of cheese flavored crackers (we used the Italian 4 cheese), and 1 1/2 cups French-fried onion rings (our family loves onions!), and added garlic powder to the breading. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. My family truly enjoyed this chicken. As an added note, no one in our family is a big fan of mayo, but I still used it. Honestly, we could not taste the mayo. Thank you for a great recipe, Chefbound!

These had a great flavor and were very moist. I did make some changes. I dipped in a honey mustard dressing thinned with milk. I didn't have cheese crackers but the bread crumbs made sure all areas of the chicken were covered, as the onions were semi-chunky. Made a cream gravy with the drippings.  Will definitely be making this again!

I think this would be a lot better without the bread crumbs.  Seems to knock down the cheez-it and onion flavor.  I'll retry without the bread crumbs.

I did everything as stated in the recipe except I added about a 1/3 cup of grated parmesan, my crackers were cheddar and parmesan, and my French fried onions were cheddar flavor.  Oh, and I pounded the chicken breasts instead of slicing it in half because they were small.  Both my boyfriend and I kept laughing that "this can't be good for you, it tastes too good!"  The chicken was very moist and tender, plus it seemed to stay nice and hot inside the crust.  We both loved it.  Boyfriend said, "You can definitely make this again."  Served it with a brown rice and vegetable medley that I threw together.  Awesome!

Good stuff!  I used what I had on hand.  Panko bread crumbs in place of the italian bread crumbs and and FLIP crackers (1/2 pretzel 1/2 cheddar cracker).  The mayo was a nice touch and added wonderful moisture.

This was just OK, basically baked breaded chicken breast. The cheese crackers, fried onions, and sesame seeds added nothing. So, all in all, a bit disappointing since the recipe looked so interesting. I still say the best baked chicken recipe on this site is Garlic Chicken.

Really moist and flavorful!  I think adding the crumb mixture to the top at the end is not necessary.  It was a bit crumbly.  A nice coating is all it needs, not a lot of extra.

This was pretty good.  Next time I'll read the directions a little more carefully and slice the chicken breasts into two.  I think it would have helped.

loved it! Approved by kids and adults both. Myonly minor change was that I have a similar sour cream chicken recipe that uses sour cream. I hate to mess with what isn't broken...so I"met in the middle" and used half sour cream/half mayo. The one other thing I changed was that I did not put the creamy stuff on both sides of the chicken. I did put crumbs on the bottom...just not the mayo. I greased the pan and put the mayo mix on the top and sides. I put the "un creamy" side down in the pan. No soggy bottom that way. This came out SO tender and juicy.

My family really enjoyed this chicken.  My son said it was a hit! I cut my chicken breasts into 3 or 4 good size strips and used half of the coating recipe which was plenty.  I will certainly make again.  Thanks for sharing.

My son LOVES this chicken.  He is always picky about chicken being dry, but he loves how moist this chicken turns out.  He bugs me to make it often.

If you have kids, this will be a good recipe to try out.  My son thought it looked sort-of like chicken nuggets because of the orange color, so he was much more inclined to be enthused about this dish.  The chicken was good, but unfortunately I ran short of the french fried onions, so I will have to make it again to get an accurate read on the recipe.  But, we liked it...even without the onion flavor (but I have a feeling with that added it will be even better!)

These were pretty good. I skipped the bread crumbs and just processed the crackers and onions together. I added garlic powder and Italian herb seasoning to both the crushed crackers and the mayo. I baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes. The only thing that we didn't like as much is that the crust flaked off very easily. But still yummy! THANKS!!

Absolutely loved this!!! My husband was a huge fan! Even the kids ate it and loved it. I used the recipe exactly as written. I did use to my food processor to blend all of the ingredients.. We had a side of Julienne potatoes and peas and it was the perfect dinner!!

I cooked this exactly like the recipe except used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 because I have a small family. I LOVED it!!! My extremely picky husband wasn't too keen on the cheez-its so I think I will use Ritz next time and see if he likes it better that way! Thank you so much for this recipe!
p.s. It was SO juicy too!

very Good & so easy... I printed this out to make the other night, but had to get back on the computer for work - so my husband made it... he just followed the easy directions and it came out great... we both really liked it.  In fact later I made another batch of the crackers/onion/bread crumb mixture and have in the cubboard for next time we want a quick chicken dish... THANK YOU!

My husband loved this! Crushed the crackers and onions in a baggie using a rolling pin, added the bread crumbs, put the mayonnaise on the chicken then put the chicken in the baggie. Very easy and turned out wonderful! Will definitely make this again.

I thought these were good, but nothing that I would necessarily want to make again.  My husband said they needed some kind of seasoning, but wasn't sure what.  I think I'd rather stick with the French fried onions crushed with some flour.  We love that recipe.

My family liked this recipe.  The chicken was really moist and I liked using the mayo, although I only used about 2 tablespoons.  I didn't have the french fried onions or sesame seeds so didn't include those.

Great Recipe! I didnt have sesame seeds so i didnt use them, i think it would have finished off the dish. I eliminated the soggy bottoms by putting the crumb mixture on the bottom of the pan as well.  Great job

Loved this recipe! For just 4 pieces of chicken you only need half the mixture. I substituted the sesame seed for pistachios. Mixing everything in a food processor. Baked it at 375 for 45 minutes because the pieces of chicken were large. Will definitely make this again!

This was amazing! Loved it. I served the crusted chicken with buttery vegetables and the extra cracker crust combined with the butter was absorbed and just delicious.  Also what makes this dish so versatile is that cheez-it crackers come in so many varieties of cheese flavor  that this can be different every time without getting boring. Thank you! bravo

I had a lot of cracker/crumb mixture left over and will prepare less next time.  I don't think the mayo added all that much (except fat), and will try something else to coat the chicken with next time.

Very yummy!!! Had a little trouble with the Breading, but I think that's because I didn't crush the cheezits enough. We like it though. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. :)

This one was great and something a little different! I only used one large (10 oz.+) chicken breast half that I split to make two servings, so I knew I would need to scale back on the crumb/onion mixture.  First I should point out that I mis-read the recipe and crushed the crackers before measuring.  My mistake!  In order to keep the ratios the same I crushed and then measured the fried onions as well.  I used ½ cup of crushed crackers, ¼ cup of fried onions and 2 T. of panko (for the bread crumbs).  Since my panko wasn’t seasoned, I sprinkled the crumb mixture with a little garlic powder and parsley flakes.  And because I was short on time I skipped the toasted sesame seeds.  I knew the amount of crumb mixture was twice what I was going to need, so I froze half for another time.  Using the other half I assembled the chicken early in the afternoon, just eyeballing the mayo, covered and refrigerated it.  I, too, thought the baking temp was excessive, so I baked this at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  I’m glad I tried this one!  Hubs and I both liked it!  And I’m glad I have the other half of the crumb mixture waiting in the freezer for another time.

Amazing - no, good - yes.  I cut my chicken into hunks (think large nuggets) and made the coating as written.  Of course I changed my cooking time for the smaller pieces (15 mins) and they turned out PERFECTLY.  The chicken was very moist and the coating added a subtle flavor and a little crunch.  What would make it 5 stars is a bit more seasoning which you can add to your liking.  Also, had extra coating so this could make a bit more chicken than it calls for.  Dipping sauces are a plus.  Would definitely make again.

This is very good & very easy.  I made it as written the first time & after that I made a few changes.  I used greek yogurt instead of the mayo to make it healthier & it was even better!  I also omitted the sesame seeds.  The chicken comes out very moist & has lots of flavor.

Made this last night - awesome!  I bought the thin sliced chicken breasts from the store.  I deleted the sesame seeds (not a personal fan) but added in fresh grated mozzarella to the topping mix instead.  For the topping, I cut back the crackers to 1 1/2 cups and then kicked up the french onion to 1 1/2 cups and it was a perfect flavor combo.  I only used half the topping so before I started dipping, I put half in a bag to save for another night (I guessed this based on what other reviewers had said).  Anyhow, great moist chicken packed with great topping flavor and super ez preparation!  Highly recommend.

The chicken is so moist and flavorful! Super quick and easy to make. I first tried this and fell in love. Now this is our go to meal. I bake it at 350 so the top doesn't get too burnt.  This is great on a romaine salad too!

I made this last night. My hubby loved it! The chicken was moist & lovely. My only suggestion is to use a bit less cheez-its & a bit more of the french fried onions.

GREAT CRUST RECIPE. HOWEVER, VERY SOGGY BOTTOM! RECOMMENDATION, PLACE UNCOOKED BREADED CHICKEN ON A WIRE RACK THAT IS IN A PAN.  THAT WAY, BOTH SIDES COOK CRISPY.

Excellent crust and flavor. The cooking time in the recipe was a bit long. I pulled the chicken out after 25 minutes and it was perfect.

Great recipe, the family loved it!  A couple of things as a side note.  I found that the mixture made A LOT, and quite honestly I think it would've been too much to throw on top, so I kept my main amount of crumbs in a large bowl, while I poured some into a smaller bowl to coat my chicken so as not to needlessly contaminate all of it.  Then after coating all my chicken pieces (I used 14 boneless, skinless chicken thighs), I poured the remainder of the smaller bowl over the chicken in the pan and it was perfect.  I also axed the mayonnaise all together and used an egg wash (1 egg, 2 tbl spoons milk) instead and it was still absolutely yummy.  Lastly, I cooked the 14 thighs on 375 for 30 minutes and they were done quite nicely.  Thanks very much for this great recipe, it is definitely a keeper!!  :o)

PROS- A nice way to use kid friendly ingredients in a dish with some nutritional value to it.  Easy recipe for beginners   CONS- Needs more seasoning.

This is an excellent recipe!  I've never tried anything so "extravagant" before.  I'm a very simple cook, and this turned out wonderful.  My husband has requested that this be a regular part of our weekly menu, and he HATES chicken breasts!

It is tasty but needs to be cooked at a lower temp to avoid burning; pre-heated oven at 425 for 25 mins works well for thicker breasts, and maybe 20 mins if they are average size.  The other change is there really is no need to add salt considering how much sodium is in the cheezits, and for those looking to cut down a bit on the fat it's easy to swap out dipping the chicken in egg whites before the breading step instead of using mayo.  Overall quick and tasty recipe.

Made according to recipe and it was very good - and easy. Served it with a little tomato basil sauce because I thought it might be dry. It wasn't  but I liked it with sauce anyway.

This quite good -- moist, flavorful, etc. Also easy to make. The only thing I won't include next time is the sesame seeds; they don't seem to add anything to the dish except a kind of weird texture.

I used this recipe with a few modifications. I only used 3 breasts sliced in half because that'll give me leftovers for a few days. I used walmart's baked cheese crisp/crackers, Italian breadcrumbs, pepper, seasoned salt, and McCormick garlic/herb premixed spice for my breading. Instead of mayo I used light raspberry vinaigrette, which smelled great while baking! I baked them for 30 minutes at 375-still crunchy on tops and sides, bottoms had a few soggy spots which was okay with me!

this was very yummy, although i wouldn't call it amazing.  i omitted the french fried onions (yuk!), used reduced-fat mayo and reduced-fat cheez-its.  they were flavorful and tender.  when the kids found out there were cheez-its on their chicken they didn't put up much of a fight about eating dinner, which is an accomplishment. thanks!

This was pretty good, it might have been better if I had remembered the sesame seeds! I had no problems with the mayo the coating turned out beautifully. The cook time might have been a bit too long - at 35 minutes the breasts were just at the edge of being too dry.

Delicious and easy to make.  I did not have the sesame seeds but it didnt matter.  I've never used mayo like this before and it scared my husband to try it because he hates mayo but it kept the chicken very moist and tasted great.  I threw into the breading mixture some garlic and onion powder, some Old Bay, and Mrs. Dash Table blend.  Doesnt need salt.  This dish is in the regular mix now!

Delicious!  The kids loved this one too.  Don't make too much - the leftovers are disappointing.  But round one = yummy!

Very good, juicy, easy to make!  Great alternative to frying. Didn't have the sesame seeds but still very good.

Tonight was my second go at this recipe and it is all gone. I used a 3 lb bag of frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts, thawed, and had no breading left over. Instead of mayonnaise, I rolled the chicken in Ranch dressing and scraped the excess off. I didn't use sesame seeds and I didn't spray the chicken. It turned out perfectly and the race was on to get to the last pieces before they were gone. Very good. Much cheaper than Shake N Bake and MUCH tastier!!

Well this chicken is a little piece of heaven. Just a wonderful flavor! Followed the recipe exact, except didn't toast the 2 teaspoons of sesame seed. Don't think it needs an explanation. This is a keeper.

My friends and I have wine night once a week.  I try to make something different every week and this recipe sounded interesting.  It was just OK. I  found it rather a dull chicken dish.  I would not make it again.

I was so tired of my breaded chicken and needed something just as easy but differant.  This was great!  I loved the onions!  I think next time I will try using ranch dressing like someone else sugested and the panko bread crumbs.

Loved it!!!  My husband and I gobbled it up.  I used low-fat cheez-its and low fat mayo to help lower the fat.  It was still yummy!  I would defintely make it again.

Expected more based on reviews.   It was just average and not all that memorable of a meal.  Probably wont try again.  Chicken with the french friend onions would have been enough.

I used sour cream instead of mayo.  I also used boneless, skinless thighs. 400 was too high. I turned it down to 350, breading started to burn.  Fantastic!!

Very moist and crunchy....my son LOVES this chicken and often requests it. I baked the chicken at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes but I pounded the chicken breasts so they were a bit thinner.

I first pounded the chicken breasts to make them a bit thinner (not cutlets) and even.  I used 1 1/2 cups Cheez-its and 1 1/2 cups onion rings and just 1/4 c bread crumbs.  Left out the sesame seeds. Used Nature's Seasonings instead of S & P.  Placed on Parchment paper for easier cleanup.  Baked at 375 degrees for about 35 minutes.  Husband loved this. Served with Green Bean and Mushroom Medley - great combo!

Once I gathered all the ingredients that  were hidden in plain sight, this was a quick easy meal. I’m going to save extra mixture to make chicken nuggets for my son. Everyone loved the chicken!   I used nonstick foil on the bottom of my glass dish and had a super easy clean up.

This chicken is fantastic! I did make one major change, because my youngest son loathes mayonnaise (and I hate hot mayonnaise). So, I used mustard, which gives it a slight tang, and helps it bond to the chicken as if it were mayonnaise. The dish is tender, juicy, and really tasty! All 4 of us loved it, and we will be making this dish for a while!

We really liked this, but the crust got too brown/black at 450. Next time I make it I’ll cook in a 400 degree oven.

As soon as I read this, I knew I wanted to try it! I was not disappointed!!!
My aunt gave my mom a similar recipe, using corn flakes & we all loved it. When I saw Cheez-Its & French onions, in place of corn flakes, I knew I had to try it!!! I had 2 LARGE breasts (about 1 lb each). I cut them in 1/2 horizontally & followed 1/2 the recipe exactly. I've NEVER cooked S/B breasts that turned out so perfectly cooked (moist & juicy) or so flavorful (cheese & onion) in ANY of my 'kitchen chemistry experiments'! This is going to the top of my list!!!

Other than adding some garlic powder, and cooking it in the air fryer (spray with non stick spray, 350 for 8 minutes), I made this as directed. Definitely a hit with everyone, including the picky chicken eating eight year old.

Didn't have any sesame seeds. Would like to try it again with everything!
I also lowered the heat to 3 7 5, I think 450 would burn in my oven.

It came out juicy enough but I only had 1/2 bone in breast, so it cooked differently. I really should have added more spices to the raw chicken first. Will have it again.

Not bad.  I made it just as the recipe states less the sesame seeds (I didn't have those).  Do not bake at the temp listed in the recipe.  I baked it at 375 for 35 min and although it didn't burn it was a bit dry.  This will vary based on the size of the breasts used.  Best thing to do is use 375 as the temp with a meat thermometer and pull them when internal temp reaches 170.  Mine hit an internal temp over 200 in the 35 min.
This recipe is close to another that uses Italian bread crumbs.  Quite honestly, I'll use that recipe going forward because the taste is very similar with less ingredients.

I made it following the recipe.  My wife's granddaughter liked it.  I always watch for the spices used, anything  with heat.  I need to make it again, allergies playing tricks with taste buds.

Made this chicken dish exactly as the recipe! I did pound the chicken and I turned it over half way through the baking so it was crisp on both sides. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make again.

This was excellent! I forgot to add the sesame seeds and only made 2 changes... I used the Spicy Cheez-its and because others mentioned the fact that theirs came out a little too dark or dry, I baked it at 375 for 30-35 minutes came out so moist and delicious! Thank you for sharing

My husband laughed when I told him I was making "Cheez-It Chicken, but changed his mind after he tasted it! It was really good. I had two large chicken breasts and cut them in half lengthwise. I substituted 1 Tbls of Mayo with chipotle aioli, you could just add some hot sauce, and cooked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. They came out perfectly cooked and I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight.  My grown daughter said, "this is amazing".  She did not know that the recipe title included the word amazing. I had to make some changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I had to use Ritz Crackers instead of cheese crackers.  So I threw in a half cup of shredded extra sharp cheese.   I didn't have Italian Bread crumbs so I used a half teaspoon of Italian seasoning a half teaspoon of garlic powder and a half teaspoon of onion powder.  I left out the sesame seeds because I didn't have those either.  I'm only telling all of this to let everyone know you can make many changes to this recipe and it is still delicious.  I did bake it at 350 degrees instead of the recommended temperature.

Love the taste but you don't need that much bread crumbs and smashed cheese crackers at all. I always cook more but even so you'll end up with a lot of left ovet waste. Even for 5-7 chicken breasts. Max is 2 cups of those 2.

We put the chicken on a baking rack on top of a cookie sheet which made both the top and bottom nice and crispy.  
We didn’t have any Cheese it’s so we used cheddar goldfish and it was great! 
Super easy to make and a hit with the whole family!

I used thin breasts, so I only baked them about 20 minutes.  They weren't too salty, and definitely weren't soggy.

I marinated the chicken in low fat ranch dressing, drained the marinade and then coated the pieces with the crumb mixture. We loved it!
I have also changed out crackers, added parmigiana cheese-the anchor seems to be the French fried onions and coating with mayo or ranch dressing. Comes out moist every time ??
Love this recipe, I have also used boneless, skinless thighs. This is a no brainer. Thank you so much for sharing it!

I make chicken dishes regularly and was excited to try this new one out.  My only comment is that the recipe went in the trash and the whole family agreed it wasn't a keeper.  The temp is too high, it cooks too long, and the flavor is pretty blah , even though the ingredients sound delicious.  Even if you adjust the time and temp, the taste just didn't make the cut.

It was good but nothing to write home about.  Like most I used. Lower temperature setting and less time  400 for 5+ minutes 375 for the rest.  Cracker crumbs not on the chicken burned.  If I do it again I'll add more herbs to the mixture and do 375 the whole time.

Loved this recipe, I used some white cheddar crackers I had on hand. I also uses almonds instead of sesame seeds Because I had those. Followed the advice of others and put all the ingredients in a blender, cut the breasts up into smaller pieces, and cooked them at 375 for 30 minutes. Turned out fabulous!

Flavor of the chicken was very good. Made exactly as written except for the sesame seeds. One complaint was that the crust/coating was a bit too wet. I wanted to ensure the chicken didn't overcook & dry out as some ppl indicated so I cooked my tenders on 350 for about 27 minutes. Next time I think I'll cook for same time but at 375. I did flip them halfway thru to try & ensure the coating got as crispy as possible. I think I'll also crush the mixture much finer next time so it will adhere better.  I also thought the process of coating each piece with mayo 1st to be a bit tedious. I think next time I'll use an egg batter or some buttermilk as others suggest. Thx for a good, easy recipe!

We "Nancy's" stick together...I agree with her review totally.  I prepared as written and had help crushing the Cheez-its and onions from a 2.5 yr old who loved pounding on the counter!  He and his mom and dad (plus one day shy of being born sister) came for dinner and chicken was enjoyed by all!  Thank you for this recipe and all the reviews that help me determine if I will attempt a recipe or not!

Who would have thunk Cheezits and onion rings? Did not have Italian bread crumbs, so we smashed up some Italian croutons. It was very good and going into our 'make that again' file...

This is well named, as it really is AMAZING CRUSTED CHICKEN!!
I made it exactly as the recipe is written and was so pleasantly surprised by everyone at the table finishing every bite! I placed each breast over arugula and topped it off with some diced tomatoes. Really delicious!

I didn’t have the onions, but made it anyway and it was great.  I’ve always made the Hellmann’s recipe but the cheese crackers gave it a nice crust and “punch”.   I will try it with the onions next time.  We loved it!  Absolutely will make again because we always think “breast” are too dry and this left them moist and crunchy.  Yum!

Tried this a few nights ago and found it a little bland but worth making again for sure, just add more seasoning.  The chicken did turn out very moist and I'm not sure if that was because of the mayo or the crust on it.  We lowered the temp of the oven, per other comments, to 350 and baked until chicken was about 165+ temp., about 40 minutes.  I think next time we will add a bit of season salt or garlic salt.  Otherwise we did the recipe as it was written.

This was very good but the main reason I gave it three stars was because there is no way that one serving of this is over 800 calories. Looking at the recipe and looking at calories on things I kind of ran the numbers and it looks like it's about 600 per serving. It's almost as if the poster put calories for everything mixed together for everyone rather than just a one person serving. I also rated it like this because I did not make it exactly as described because I did not have cheese crackers. I didn't really measure anything but just kind of threw some onions, Italian bread crumbs, Ritz crackers, and some cheddar cheese (to make up for the absence of cheese crackers) together. I feel as though spraying the top of the chicken did not make it crusty like the recipe says it is.

Great recipe! Easy to make and the chicken was so moist and flavorful. Huge hit :)
