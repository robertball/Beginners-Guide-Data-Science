This was fantastic!  I didn't have the ginger liquer but I just used a little extra fresh ginger and white wine instead.  Wow.  So easy, My husband loved it and we fought over who got to bring the leftovers to work the next day!

This soup was horrible, I'm so sorry to say. It literally made me sick.

I love carrot soup and now I can't even LOOK at any orange colored soup
without wanting to barf. 

DO NOT BOTHER with this one!

I took a taste of this orange soup and couldn't stand it...my husband ate it, but didn't care for it either. It looks bad too...What a waste:(

I have no idea what those earlier reviewers were thinking.  This soup is delicious and nutritious.  I used a fresh leek from my garden in place of the onion.  This soup is so good that we will be adding it to our Thanksgiving menu later this fall.

This recipe is good, but only with some serious revisions. I used all fresh ginger instead of liqueur, only one tablespoon of flour, and no sugar (I tried with one tablespoon of sugar, but even that was too sweet). Lots of pepper helps bring out the ginger flavor, and the parsley at the end is crucial. I like that its creamy without using cream.

Despite this recipe's bad reviews, I wanted to try it for myself as I've been looking for a delicious carrot-ginger soup. Alas, the soup ended up having a cake batter texture and taste. I thought it might taste better as a chilled soup, but I was wrong: the ingredients just don't mesh well together. I had to throw it away.

This was a very good soup but not a favorite of my family.  Once in a while would be ok.
