I will never make cabbage rolls again.  I have rarely heard my husband rave as much or as often as he does about this recipe.  I make only a couple of changes.  I use regular brown rice in the meatballs, and use a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses in evaporated cane juice in place of the brown sugar.  I doubled this because I have a family of 11, and I usually think when it says "serves 10" they don't mean 10 of my kids!  In this case, though, the recipe is abundant.  I made it in a big Nesco roaster, and it was fabulous.  A few kids would have preferred it without raisins, but I think the flavor is important.  Fabulous recipe!  I am so thankful to have it! Update: My husband prefers that I just brown the ground beef with onion, and add about 2/3 cup of cooked rice. It makes this recipe much easier than the meatballs, and as a result we eat it more often! Still one of the greats, even years after I began making it.

This is the first recipe I have done a review on. I have made this multiple times and it is awesome. I made it as written. Don't leave out the ingredients you add at the end. They are what makes this recipes flavor so unique.

THis is really good.  It takes a few hours to prepare but it is really worth it.  There is a nice balance between the sour lemon juice and the brown sugar and honey.  I highly recomend this!

Very easy and tasty.  I used a bag of cole slaw mix instead of chopping the cabbage.  I also replaced the raisin with a cup of prunes.  And to make it the way my family likes it, I crumbled 10 ginger snaps in with the lemon juice, honey and sugar, which gives it a zing and helps thicken the sauce.

We really liked this. I adjusted this recipe to use 5lbs of ground beef, so I made a LOT of it. I took it easy on the salt and really easy on the sugar. This would have been way too sweet for us as written, so be sure to sweeten it to your taste. The lemon and raisins are a fantastic addition. Thanks for the recipe!

I too grew up with this recipe.  It is truly wonderful and worth the time.  It was always a special occasion at our house when mom made this.  However, I have never tried the brown sugar.  Sounds yummy.  I prefer to use splenda or sweet n low instead of any sugar and leave everything as the original recipe states.  Mom used to make a separate pot like this for my dad who was diabetic and it too is fabulous. Pete's sister....  :)

OH Chef Daddy Pete...all I can say is yumm yumm yumm! What a wonderful recipe and its so so easy..The only things I did different is added more rice, some garlic powder to the sauce and meat, and I sweetened and soured the tomato mix before I put in the cabbage so that the flavors would soak into the cabbage..I just made this the other day and I am dying to make it again!!! Make this tonight for dinner You will love it!

This is the original recipe, except I substituted BROWN SUGAR for the White Sugar.  Tastes vary, but if leave out ingredients, you don't get the full flavor effect.

Loved it as written; followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make this again. My husband says don't change it. I say not quite so much brown sugar. But I'm still in love with this recipe.

This was absolutely wonderful. I have the MOST picky eaters as kids and one who detests cabbage, this entire pot was eaten tonight!! My family has asked that this not be a one time meal. Was definitely worth the long cook time as it filled the apartment with such a delightful aroma, everyone was could not wait for it to be done to try it. Great recipe!!!!

I thought that this was an excellent recipe and loved the blend of flavors.  I left out the raisins because we don't like them but it was still excellent.  Also because I don't have time or patience to make meatballs, I used prepared frozen meatballs so the recipe came together in a snap.  We served it over brown rice.

Having had mediocre cabbage rolls this past weekend, I was craving something good.  This was delicious!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it took a while.  But, it was worth it.  The stew was very flavorful, so much so that my 4 year old says he likes cabbage now!

Very good, thanks for the recipe.  I cooked the meatballs in the oven so the grease didn't go into the dish and I left out the raisins and didn't use all the brown sugar.  Also, I used V8 for the broth, I didn't have any tomato paste.

This is a recipe that I crave!! I've made it a few times. It's perfect for a cold winter day. I precook rice and add more than the recipe calls for.  Or I might serve the dish over rice. Sometimes I form meatballs, other times I just saute the meat & keep it ground. The recipe is quite versatile to "play with" the structure.  Keep the proportions of sweet & sour the same, that's what makes it so flavorful.

Exactly what I was looking for, flavor of the sauce is excellent.  Meatballs could use more spice they were a little bland. Next time I'm adding a little garlic, coriander and cloves.  I omitted the raisins, personal taste don't like them in this dish. I halved the recipe and substituted 2 packets of splenda for the sugar, but used the honey.  YUM This is a keeper.

This is time consuming, but really good. And yes, it does taste even better the next day if you can salvage any leftovers.

I was too lazy to form the meat mixture into meatballs, so I sauteed it in a separate pan. I also used leftover cooked rice instead of uncooked (because that's what I had) and added 1/3 cup of cider vinegar to the cabbage mixture for a little more "sour." Chef Daddy Pete was wise to suggest adding brown sugar slowly--I don't think I used the whole quarter-cup. Wonderful healthy recipe that was easy to adjust to my family's tastes. A big hit!

This is CRAZY good!  Changes I made (most to just use what I had on hand): No raisins, lime juice instead of lemon, brown rice in the meatballs, canned diced tomatoes instead of whole (and I used two cans because the cabbage mixture was starting to look dry as I accidentally kept the heat too high on the 1 hour simmer), half of my tomato sauce was garlic and basil flavor, and I added nutmeg and garlic powder to the meatballs.  I didn't measure anything in the recipe and did everything to taste.  Given all these changes, I think this is a recipe that is hard to mess up.

It sounds like a lot of lemon (or lime in my case) and brown sugar, but go with it.  It's not too sweet or sour, and is truly just delicious!

To reduce cooking time and give more flavour to the cabbage:
Boil the chopped cabbage in salt water just until all denté (do not overcook). Leave cabbage separate from the other ingredients.
I used a mix of tomato soup/tomato sauce.
Cook the onions with the hamburg. Mix remaining ingredients, except cabbage, with the hamburg. Add spices to taste.
I layered as follows: Cabbage by itself in the bottom of the pan; top with the other ingredients; top with cheese and broil in the oven until cheese is bubbling. Yummy!

Really amazing and easy to make - takes awhile but most of the time is spent simmering in the pot. Reminds me of the cabbage rolls I grew up with!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used more rice than called for (1 cup brown instant rice), and I cooked it before adding to the meat mixture.  The meal is not too sweet (my husband can't handle sweet with savory), and has wonderful flavor!  I omitted the raisins (see above reason!!!)  Thanks for a great recipe.

The sauce came out delicious however  the meatballs were hard as rocks! I have no idea why. I followed the recipe exactly and cooking time exactly. Double checked and all ingredients were measured and mixed correctly. We ate it but prefer softer meatballs. Wish I knew why this happened

I made this for my dad. He had mentioned stuffed cabbage, but I wasn't up for trying that for the first time. This recipe, however, was a different story. My mother had a recipe similar to this that she got out of a Bon Appetit magazine. We always enjoyed that meal and this recipe is just as good as what I remember my mom making. It's yummy. I used half pork sausage in the meatballs and instead of rice I used a little bit of bread crumbs. I didn't have raisins, but other than those changes I stuck to the recipe and preparation as written. I will make this again very soon. I love it with mashed potatoes. This recipe's a winner.

This is fabulous!  Our family - all of them - loved it.  This was a lovely "sweet and sour" flavor as it says.  It's been made several times now and every time it's made the recipe needs to be printed out for the cooks at the table.  (Thank you very much for sharing the recipe! Know that what was a special recipe in your family has now become a special recipe in ours.)

This was sooo delicious!  I did add a little extra lemon juice and a splash of cider vinegar because I like really tangy sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I almost died and went to heaven while eating it!!  It's sooo good!!  I will be making this a lot.

This recipe is delicious, only thing I added was a beer because it was a little thick.  Shared the soup with my picky relatives and they loved it.  Thank you for sharing this, I will definitely make it again.

I loved this reciepe! Making it tonigh but, instead of using ground beef, I'm using ground turkey to make it a really low-fat meal. Will report back and let everyone know if it was just as good.

Loved this dish!  It's a lot easier than making cabbage rolls.  I used ground venison instead of ground beef.

This is very good.  It reminds me of something my Greek mother in law whom lives in Germany would make.  I left out the raisins and only used half of the brown sugar.  I would be interested in the original recipe.  Thanks for a great hearty recipe.

I thought my grandma's secret recipe was gone for good, but I swear this is it. Absolutely delicious, and well worth the cooking time. The only changes I made were using regular raisins instead of golden ones, and using white sugar and molasses because I was out of brown sugar.

Hmmm...this recipe is pretty good. I am not sure it is worth 2.5 hours cooking time good though! According to one review, it tastes even better the next day. We'll see what tomorrow holds!

I love this dish. My grandmother used to make stuffed cabbage whenever she came to visit. I never had the chance to get the recipe from her. This recipe tastes just how I remember my grandmother’s dish, but much easier than actually making the rolls. And it tastes even better the 2nd day.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish. It was easy to make. Be sure to read through the steps as the meatballs should be made first. He doesn’t like cooked raisins so I put them in a  tea leaf  strainer so I could get the flavor and remove them.  This is a keeper!

My family loved this recipe.  The ingredients are common to have on-hand in my kitchen so I'll make this often over the winter.  I took the easy way as others described... I skipped the meat ball method and added cooked ground beef (drained) to the onion/tomato/cabbage batch.  I think this way was a lot easier and didn't sacrifice anything.  Served it over rice and will try egg noodles next time.

Delicious! I used all the brown sugar, and accidentally purchased regular raisins. Next time, I'll cut the sugar in half. There will definitely be a next time.

Pretty darn close to Nana's stuffed cabbage, without the hassle! I just sauteed the onions and ground beef together (didn't bother with the meatballs), and then followed the recipe to a "T."  I let it simmer quite a while, though, to help flavors blend. As others stated, even better the next day! Delicious, feel-good food.  I think Nana would be proud!

Good flavor but a lot of work and time spent making this recipe.  Very flavorful the next day.  I will try this again but will rework the recipe and try to simplify the steps plus I want to use more rice and substitute some sausage for the hamburger meat.

I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey and because the meatballs were more watery, I added a little uncooked oatmeal to bind it in addition to the uncooked rice.  Also only had regularly raisins not golden so I used regular raisins.  The meal came out just right.  I served it with brown rice and green beans.   Delicious.  Lots of complements.

Really did not care for this. Husband said it was ok, but did not go back for a second helping. I should have passed on it when I read over the ingredients, the lemon juice is just wrong. There are much, much better unstuffed cabbage recipes on this site.

Just made this tonight, and found it delicious.  I halved the recipe for just my husband and I.  The only changes I made were; omitted the oil when cooking onions, & I didn't cook as long as was called for - 
45 minutes after adding cabbage to tomatoes, and 
30 minutes after stirring meatballs into the sauce.  So I cut about 30 minutes off the total time and it was perfect. Served it over rice & we loved it.  
Very easy, will make again and again.

This was very good.  I cut the recipe down a bit since there are only 2 of us, and still had to freeze some (not a bad thing, it came out perfect after freezing for a couple weeks).    My husband loved it and asked to have it in our regular rotation.  I did add a little more seasoning after it was done since it was to bland as written.  I also added more raisons when I thawed the frozen one, they were a nice surprise.  My FIL came for lunch and had the frozen casserole and didn't know any different , he claims he can always tell when something is leftover or not fresh:).  He asked for the recipe and has already made it for his family, who all liked it.  Thank you.

I found it to be not sour enough or sweet enough.  So I tweaked it by adding sauerkraut and addition brown sugar. I also added a little water to make it soupier.  Bearing that in mind, I think you can skip the honey and lemon and then make the raisins optional.  Also if you want soupier yet, a can of tomato soup should do the trick.

I actually did not change anything other than to make this a lot quicker for me! I had leftover boiled cabbage and didn't know what to do with it...saw this and it looked awesome!  So seeing as I didn't change anything except used chopped up leftover cabbage...oh and I didn't set out meat so I used the frozen meatballs I had. The time cooked was pretty quick...cooked and served within 45 mins! Now I am sure that if it cooked longer the awesome flavors would be more awesome...but my family and I  LOVED this!!! So thank you for this awesome recipe that will be used over and over and over!!!

Loved it!  Followed the recipe, using venison instead of beef.  Next time I make it I'll try vinegar instead of the lemon juice, just to see if I can tell the difference.

Per one of the reviewer's suggestions, I sauteed the meat with the onions and then drained it. I added the other ingredients (including some cooked rice) afterwards. It was great! Next time, I would just add less sugar than suggested.

This is now a big "go to" for hearty meals for my family and friends.  So much easier than stuffed cabbage and just as good.  Only change I made was to use bread crumbs instead of rice in the meatballs.

Different. Skipped the raisins and reduced the sweet components. If I made this again  wouldn't add the rice to the meat balls but instead serve the rest of the dish over it.
