This the 2nd time that I've used philly cooking creme--and its the second dissappointment. You're probably better off making your own cream sauce...

Delicious, just like Shrimp n' Grits from the lowcountry.  I did 1/2 a frozen bag of red/green pepper and onion mix, and quick-cooking yellow grits instead of rice.  I lived in Charleston for four years and this is a pretty darn delicious, and quick, shrimp n' grits match!

This was delicious and super easy to make! I used an entire medium onion and an entire red pepper instead of measuring/wasting the leftovers. The sauce was a little soupy, so I added some flour and let it simmer uncovered a while to thicken it up. I substituted whole wheat pasta instead of white rice, definitely a keeper!

Made just as described.  It is a beautiful dish but the flavor did not quite do it for us - probably will not make again.  It was the fiirst time I had tried the cooking creme.  Tasted too much like cream cheese with not enough garlic flavor.  Also, make sure to take the tough ends of the peas along with the "strings".

This was good, but a little bland. I think it needed some salt, but everyone seemed to enjoy it. I put in extra red pepper, onion, and doubled the sugar snap peas.
