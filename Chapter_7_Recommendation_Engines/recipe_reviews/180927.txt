This recipe was just ok.  The bread wasn't what I expected.  It tasted just like my moms Thanksgiving roll recipe.  The filling could have been more sweet.  I definately think it can be improved upon.

Very nice bread, but I thought it needs more blackberries.  I added sugar, cinnamon, and flour to the blackberries and I'm glad I did so bc they can be tart and the additions balanced out the blackberry flavor for me.  The bread is really really sticky and I ended up making 2 braids instead of 3; I just didn't feel there was enough filling although I'm sure there'd have been enough bread to do so.  So, I'd double the filling next time, use a tad more flour (although moisture in bread is variable, so the stickiness could change depending on the moisture in the air) and maybe top the bread with cinnamon or sugar or both.  All in all, nice presentation, fun to make, and a good, potentially great recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, although very rich.  Similar to a danish or a turnover. Almost any filling could be used, strawberries, apple cinnamon filling, cream cheese. I glazed mine in egg white and sprinkled it with white sugar for a crust.  Made a very nice, very filling breakfast.

Nice Danish style pastry.  I made apple strudel and it was great!  Chilled in fridge overnight and used plenty of flour to roll out between wax paper.  Brushed with egg white before baking.  Time consuming but worth it.
