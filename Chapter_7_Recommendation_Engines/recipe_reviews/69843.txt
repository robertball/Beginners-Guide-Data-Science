My husband's mother use to make him brunswick stew when he was little and it was his favoriate. I looked up brunswick stew and found hundreds of recipes. I questioned him on his Mom's version to make it as close to her as I could and this was it! i have made this at least 50 times and it is always a big hit. I did make a few changes. I leave out the ribs completely. I sautee onions and green peppers in olive oil and put them right into the slow cooker. Also, a huge short cut, I buy two rotissarie chickens and just pull all the chicken right from the bone (this saves sooo much time)! Put the chicken in the crock pot along with all the other ingredients. I also double all the ingredients (still only using two rotissarie chickens)to have a full crock pot and have enough to freeze.This is just GREAT! Everyone tasting it always wants the recipe and very simple to make too.

This was the closest recipe I could find to what my Honey grew up with. He loves it! I leave out the ribs. There is plenty of shredded chicken that it isnt missed and it cuts way down on the fat. I actually made this for Christmas day and the entire family wanted the recipe!

Good and easy.  I did think it was too strong on the steak sauce.  I will only put 1/3 of that in next time.  I also added a few tablespoons of butter.  Very good for a crowd...

This was really good, DH loved it. I used pulled pork instead of the ribs as I had it leftover in the fridge. A little too salty for me (maybe cut back on the A1 next time). I served it over biscuits..

My honey is very picky about brunswick stew and he loved this one.  Next time i will add a touch of cumin or look for a smoky steak sauce to cut a bit of the sweetness but it is really a great recipe.

Most authentic flavor I have gotten.  I used KC BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup and steak sauce.  I also put in the remains of a beef roast.  Delicious

This stew wasn't very impressive, it seemed too sweet and not very tasty, my husband didn't like it at all. I will not make this again.

I grew up in Georgia, and Brunswick Stew was a staple. I have wanted to make it for myself, but I have always been intimidated by the process. I followed this recipe at first, but as it was cooking, and I did taste tests, I found it to be sweet as others have mentioned. I added a little cumin, 4-5 cloves of fresh garlic, more black pepper, some sea salt, and cayenne pepper. These additions definitely tamed the sweetness without compromising the genuine flavor of the stew. I am glad I found this one! My husband, who had never even heard of Brunswick Stew, is a huge fan!

I agree that it is very close to the original.  Used shredded pork also, instead of the ribs.

Did not care for this at all.  To strong, on the vinegary side. Think there was way to many sauces with vinegar base in it.

It turned out very bland. Had to probably triple the Worcestershire and add lots of Texas Pete.

My favorite go to Brunswick Stew. I have had nothing but raves from the version. I usually wait until I cook a Boston Butt, and use leftover meat.

I have made this several times and it's always a big hit!! Many have said that the taste is too vinegar like, personally that is one of the things I like about it. I would rather call it more of a tangy taste. I will definitely continue to make this version of the stew.

The time I had this was in the 60s in Mississippi where my mother's aunt cooked it with the squirrel, crow and possum my uncle shot. The vinegar, worchestershire and steak sauce were used to breakdown the wild gamieness back in the day when times were lean and meat was scarce.

I loved this recipe; I used left over Christmas Prime Rib Roast and leftover frozen Thanksgiving turkey. After reading the other reviews indicating too salty, too sour, too sweet, I halved the Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, steak sauce (A-1) and ketchup.  Since I was using what I had on hand, I added a 14 ounce diced tomato supplemented with fresh chopped tomatoes and rather than liquid hot sauce, I used dried red pepper (about 1 tsp) and chicken broth rather than bullion. Vegetables were what was on hand: frozen corn and fresh carrots.   Just adjust the sour or sweet ingredients to taste!

A dear friend who hails from North Carolina asked me to make this for her as she can no longer cook because she is wheel chair bound.  I had never had it and I was skeptical.  It is my new winter favorite and my friend said it tasted just like her mother used to make.  I did leave out the corn, though.  Wonderful for a cold winter evening!
