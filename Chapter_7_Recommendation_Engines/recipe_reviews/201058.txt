This is such an amazing drink!! It was given to us by friends in New Brunswick and now we gladly share it with all our Albertan friends. It's so good. We place all the ingredients in our Vita Mix blender and you get a creamy foam on the top. It's delicious!!!!

This is a nice cocktail, kinda like DMB...easy listening.  I elected to use white rum because I hate coconut and I couldn't resist adding a splash of Diet 7-Up because I love bubbles.  Cheers!

Excellent ‘tropical’ type drink that always gets rave reviews from guests. I follow the recipe and add a bit more of the juices to make it less ‘lethal’.

My favourite drink; sweet and smooth. I added an extra ounce of Cranberry juice, as well as 2 Marichino cherries + about 1 tbsp of the syrup. Absolutely delicious.
