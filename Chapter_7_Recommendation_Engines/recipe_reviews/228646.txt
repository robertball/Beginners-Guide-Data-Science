This is one of my favorite cakes to make once it starts getting cooler outside. This works well with a yellow cake mix, too. If I have them on hand, I like to throw in a cup of butterscotch chips. Butterscotch and pumpkin is really a winning flavor combination--it's a favorite in this house.

My grandmother has beed making this recipe since the 1950's (since boxed cake mix hit the shelves!) She said that she originally got it from a church group. We use yellow cake mix and an enitre can of pumpkin (which was a mistake originally)....it is so much more moist!  We also top it with an orange glaze. It really makes a big difference. The orange blends so well with the other flavors. Just use confectioners sugar, melted butter, orange zest and a bit of milk and drizzle on once its cooled. You will make it this way every time! This has been a family tradition for over 60 years and I am glad to see other families enjoying it too!

I made this for a pot luck at work and it was A HIT!!  I just frosted it with a can of ready made cream cheese frosting but before I did that, I sprinkled a few butterscotch chips on the top of the cake and let them melt into a sort of glaze as the cake cooled.  It was so delicious, will definitely make it again!

I made a cream cheese glaze to go with this cake. The cake is SUPER moist and will be perfect for a cool fall day! It did take almost 2 hours to cook thoroughly however.

I made this cake and changed a couple of things that were suggested in the reviews. I added the whole can of pumpkin and added 1 cup of buterscotch chips. I also baked at 300 for 60 minutes.I also did a cream cheese glaze on the cake. It turned out fantastic! I took it to work for a potluck and there was a ton of food there and this was gone in 30 minutes. I now have to bring another one in next week as several people did not get to try it! They said it was the most moist cake they had eaten and the most delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  This cake was so easy to make and super moist!  Baking at 250 made me nervous as it seemed too low, so I baked at 300 for 70 minutes and it was perfect!  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  Next time I want to try a cream cheese glaze.

This is my favorite cake to make in the fall!!  You can add a little sprinkle of powdered sugar or a cream cheese glaze but its even good plain.  Sometimes I will just drop a spoonfull of cool whip on top...anyway you eat it its good!!

I just made this yesterday and took it to my waitstaff friends at the "House of Pies" restaurant here in Houston.  They LOVED IT...and their baker came out and told me he loved it also.  Easy, tasty, moist and beautiful presentation.  And now, I can even buy microwave glazes for the top.

Was not outstanding.  Used Yellow cake mix and should have used more pumpkin than called for.  Baked it 300 for 70 minutes, not as moist as claimed to be.  Using a cream cheese frosting helped.

I made this cake using a spice cake box mix and gingerbread pudding. It turned out perfect and was devoured at a church game dinner. It was easy, moist, and much better than regular cake!

Absolutely GREAT! Made it for thanksgiving and it was a hit! Also, what I did was make the cake twice, one as a Bundt cake and the other made 25 cupcakes. I didn't really stray from the OG recipe but I did ice mine with (store bought) "Rich & Creamy" Cream Cheese frosting. I just heated the frosting for bout 30 seconds in the microwave and poured it over the cake and for the cupcakes, I didn't microwave it.

Made this for a bake-off at work. I won first place! I had people comment that they never thought they liked pumpkin but this recipe changed their minds.

I have made this cake many times - for birthdays, holidays and bake sales. It is so so good!!! You must find a good cream cheese glaze/frosting to pour over it. Then it's perfect. :)

The first time I made this it was good, but not fantastic.  The second time I tweaked a little - I added 1/2 bag butterscotch chips and about 1/3 cup crushed pineapple.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting and it was a big hit at Christmas dinner.  This will definitely be a holiday treat from now on.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This was a hit after our Thanksgiving dinner. However, I wasn't sure about the butterscotch pudding. Instead I used vanilla pudding and baked at 300 degrees for 70 minutes. Then I made a cream cheese glaze which finished it to perfection.

This was a great recipe to play with!  Loved the butterscotch idea!  I switched the cake to a spice cake mix and didn't use the pumpkin pie spice.  Used a whole small can of pumpkin.  I did add a tad but of vanilla because we are big on vanilla in my house.  I was very worried about baking at a low temp and I couldn't get a clean toothpick to come out.  I raised the temp to 300 and cooked it 10 minutes longer just to be safe.  After letting it cool it came out of the pan beautifully and the color was just gorgeous.  I think because the cake is just so moist I would never get a clean toothpick.  Great cake that tasted amazing!

I made this twice. The first time I followed the directions, but the second time I used chocolate cake mix and added a handful of butterscotch chips.  It was pretty good as written, but I liked it much better with the changes.  The chocolate mix seemed to help cut some of the sweetness of this recipe.

i made this for a group of ladies that my great grandma knows and they absolutly enjoyed it. it was a very simple recipe, and the cake came out sooo nice and moist. the instructions say to leave it in for an hour and 10 mins, it really only needs about one hour, just let it sit for about 15 mins before u flip it. if u spray the pan very well with pam baking spray, the cake will slide right out with no hassle. totally going to make this for my family for Christmas!!

I used yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding.  My cake was VERY good.  I was glad I didn't put icing on it as it is very sweet.  Next time I'll try adding raisins or dates to the batter.  Or for a special occasion, I think pecans would be perfect.  

I cooked in a bundt pan at 250 as directed, but it took about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggests.

It has been a while since I made this cake. But it was a hit the last time I made it. My problem is the recipe calls for 18.25 oz cake mix. Cake mixes are only 15.25 oz now. Since no one else mentioned it, am I to assume it works?

This cake was amazing! I made the following changes: 
1. I used sugar-free white cake mix
2. I used sugar-free butterscotch pudding mix
3. I used Egg Beaters instead of eggs
4. I added a cup of butterscotch chips to the batter
5. I added half a cup of chopped walnuts
6. I mixed fat-free sweetened condensed milk with butterscotch chips, melted it down, and applied it as a glaze to the cake, then sprinkled finely chopped walnuts to the top.

I did as others suggested by cooking it at 300-degrees for about 70 minutes. I also used the entire can of pumpkin.

This cake was so rich and decadent! It's still a little too much sugar and fat for our lifestyle to eat as a regular treat, but for a once-a-year splurge, this was divine! Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy and super moist.  I used a while can of pumpkin and it was almost like pumpkin bread with butterscotch flavoring here and there. Yummy.

I am not a baker but was looking for an easy recipe for a party.  This turned out wonderfrul and very moist.  Just pefect.  Instead of white cake mix, I used spiced cake mix and although it is delicious without icing, I iced it with a cream cheese frosting.  Big hit and it is now my go to cake recipe.  Very, very easy.

Loved this cake!!  I did add a cup of butterscotch chips, which made the taste perfect.  Serve it warm and it just melts in your mouth.  My daughter who doesn't like anything asked for seconds..will definitely be making this again
