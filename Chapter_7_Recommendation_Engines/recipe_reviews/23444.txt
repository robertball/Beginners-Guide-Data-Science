although this tastes good, the rice was completely uncooked after 1/2 hr! and so i continued to bake it, for 40 mins extra, until the veggies were BURNT and the rice was STILL not cooked.. so i would advise people to bake the rice for 25 mins first, then add in the veggies for the next 30 - 40 mins.

Note from the author -- This recipe was meant for young children who had a difficult time eating vegetables that were not mushy.  When I cook this for adults, I add vegetables towards the end.

This was very very yummy!  I added more that the 1/4c of vege's though (more like 1/2 c each)
and a left over chicken breast that I cubed up and threw in. The grocery store was out of vege stock so I added Fat free
chicken broth (about 2 2/3 c since there were more vege's) I cooked it for about 45 min's stiring once or twice.
I have two small children and they helped cut up the vege's and both of them really liked it.  Great way to eat 4 different
vege's in one sitting!  I WILL be making this one over and over!  Defenatly worth the time to cut up the vege's~!

This recipe is really easy to put together.  Use any vegetables that you have - broccoli, squash, peppers, etc.  You can do everything the night before.  I used chicken stock because that's what I had to get rid of.  Definitely cook the rice for half the time, then throw in the veggies.

Very good. We added more vegetables than the recipe states. The rice took an additional 20 minutes or so to cook though.

I did like other reviewers suggested and used frozen veggies which I added halfway through cooking and it worked great. This dish has such a great flavor. I used Zataran's wild rice which already had seasoning in it so I went easy on the other spices. I will keep this one!

Not 15 minutes prep time with out a food processor. A food processor is a definite must so that you don't have to chop everything by hand. 

It was a bit bland, I added some minced garlic and basil. 

It was good for my first vegetarian dish.

I thought this was a tasty way to make rice. 
I put in way more veggies than stated, and added them later, after the rice had started to cook (so they wouldn't get too mushyI I also added fresh, chopped parsley. 

But I thought the combination of veggies was a good one. Serve with fish and a simple salad

I took the easy road to all of this. I was cooking for 2 adults (and MAYBE a toddler if she eats it, and she did!) so I used 2 boxes of Lipton seasoned wild rice, 1 14oz can of broth. I also used frozen veggies put in later in cooking as others suggested. Fast and easy, I will make it again! :)

This is one of the best rice dishes. Very easy to prepare and it went great with sweet and sour pork. Will definately be keeping and using this one often.

I wasn't really impressed with this.  Perhaps I misinterpreted, but I served it for a main dish.  It didn't make for a very exciting meal.  It was quite filling and healthy as well.  I will probably half it next time, serve it as a side and cook it in the rice cooker instead of the oven.  I also might try replacing the white rice with brown and the brown with quinoa.  That might jazz it up a bit.

This is really good! I did do things a bit differently after reading the reviews, but I didn't change that much.  I used about 1/2 - 2/3 cup of each vegetable instead of 1/4.  I sauteed the onions first, because I hate crunchy onions, and didn't use the onion flakes. I also used 3 1/2 cups broth as some of the reviews suggested.

I followed other suggestions and cooked the rice in the covered dish for 30 minutes by itself, stirring once, before adding the veggies.  I was really disappointed to see, after the 30 minutes, that the rice (all three kinds) was perfectly done!  So I added a smidge more water, mixed in the veggies, and baked for another 20 minutes.  Came out fine, but next time I'll just add the veggies after 10 minutes and see how that works.  I don't know why so many others have had trouble with this recipe.  I'd say to add the extra cup of water and make sure to tightly cover the baking dish so the steam doesn't evaporate (I used foil).  Spray the dish with non-stick spray or grease it.  Make this right and it turns out fantastic.  I've used it as a great veggie main dish, but it would also be good as side dish.

Nice, but the rice came out a bit dry. I'd recommend adding another 1/4 cup of broth.

A great base recipe for any oven cooked rice meal.  I just love the way the brown rice brings out the flavor of everything else.  Perfect for those evenings when there is just too much to do besides cooking, as long as the veggies are cut in advance.

This recipe sounded really good to me but it just wasn't very flavorful and the vegetables were a little too mushy. I would experiment with adding more seasonings and maybe adding the vegies half way through cooking it. But then again, some people like their vegies really soft....

I thought this was fantastic... I made this pretty much as-is with a couple minor substitutions (I only had green bell peppers and no red on hand, for example) I had no trouble with the rice not cooking, though I did add an extra half cup or so of brown rice to the mix. Really delicious flavor!

This was a good weeknight meal when the other directions were followed. Added cooked chicken and veggies after cooking for 30 mins and cooked for an additional 30mins. My husband and i liked it, as well as my 2 yr old daughter. Thanks!

I used only brown rice since that's all I had on hand.  I also only added onions, peppers and carrots since I didn't have any of the other ingredients.  Also I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth again since that is what I had.  I thought it turned out great and the whole family approved it.  Definetely will make it again, maybe using the additional kinds of rice if I have them, otherwise I'd do it just the same as the first time.

Recipe was delicious; I added some fresh rosemary which added a lovely amount of flavor!  I used only the brown rice and substituted green beans for the mushrooms.  Wonderful!

Tonight is the 2nd time I've made this recipe. The first time I followed the directions, adding a few more spices and baking it, but the rice never cooked enough and I used a boxed rice mix. So this time I bought a Wegmans whole grain 5 rice blend and cooked that according to the directions on the box, but used the 2 cups of vegetable stock, a 1/4 cup of red wine, basil, tyme and some garlic and onion powder. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in olive oil and once they were soft added a bag of Giant brand country blend vegetables and let them cook a little. Once the rice was done I mixed it with the veggies. Much better! The rice was done. I got some Tyson braised beef steak in bourbon sauce for my husband and son and they mixed it with the rice and veggies. I'll make this again, but it's better to cook the rice separately and not even bake it.

Just like everyone else said, you really should cook the rice first.  We ended up with some half-cooked rice
We put baby spinach, broccoli, yellow onion, mushrooms and carrots in ours.  No wild rice, or brown rice, and no bell pepper.  The only seasonings we used were fresh ground black pepper and sea salt.  My wife also used 50/50 milk/water instead of just water.
The dish was very good over all and quite healthy since we used fresh vegetables.  Our 3yo and 11mo really enjoyed it.  I put red chilli sauce on mine and it made all the difference.

I doubled the recipe, but didn't want sodium-laden broth, so substituted 1 14.5-oz. can of petite diced tomatoes w/no salt added, 1 cup red wine, and the rest water. Went heavy on the veggies, up to double, and generous with the spices. Baked the rice/"broth"/spices for 30 min., then added veggies, stirred, and baked 30 min. longer, then let sit about 20 min. Came out great! Oh, and rather than long-grain and wild rice separately, I bought a small bag of a gourmet wild rice blend and used that instead of the combo. Turned out very tasty, and surprisingly sweet, but not overly. Would serve this to company, perhaps with some wild-caught salmon and broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or asparagus.

this was ok.  i used all brown rice and did it on the stove top, so i followed the istructions on the package of the rice for how long to cook it, and i added the veggies (which i doubled) half way through.  next time i'll try it with chicken broth instead of veggie broth, and i'll add even more onion.

I am not sure what I did wrong, but the rice would not get done! I even cooked it for 30 minutes before adding the veggies & then cooked it for 30 more minutes and still the rice was hard! Very disappointed!

We didn't really care for this, and usually I love anything with rice. It turned out rather soggy and was pretty bland. I used rosemary, as another reviewer mentioned, and it was the only thing that really gave it any flavor.

I gave this 4 stars because it is a great BASE recipe.  For added flavor I used portobello mushrooms, and added Cilantro Pinto beans.  Since I am vegan I chose the Glory Sensibly Seasoned brand flavored without meat.  To cut back on sodum I used lower sodium vegetable broth and the pinto beans in lower sodium.

This recipe was very tasty. It seems very versitile. I would like to add red peppers because I like spicy food. It was seasoned well. I followed all the directions and the rice was good. I used only brown rice because that's all I had and the rice was GOOD!!!!! I can't wait to cook this for my parents. It's a way to get healthy food all around (brown rice and vegies). I think I'd ask more vegetables but it was fine the way it was.

I loved this!.. I did modify it quite a bit.  I used 1 cup of red rice which has a very nutty texture but takes a lot longer to cook than long grain.  I ended up putting it in a pot with more liquid and simmered about 50 min because it wasn't cooking fast enough in the oven.  I also sauted the onion in margarine with the mushrooms and some chopped carrot instead of broccoli.  I omitted the bell peppers.  I made my own vegetable stock.  I just loved the crunchy nutty taste of the red rice; sorry for those who are sticklers and follow the recipe to a T; sometimes I do, but not this time.!

This was delish with a few changes.  I added the veggies about 20 minutes in.  Added garlic, chopped frozen spinach, and walnuts.  I also ended up using about 3.5 cups of broth to keep everything moist. Boyfriend loved it.  Makes great leftovers.

Nope...won't make it again. After reading the reviews, I stuck with one kind of rice. It was still too hard though and I ended up adding cream of chicken soup to give it some more...more of whatever it was missing.

Very nutritious, with all the yummy veggies, but after putting it in the oven covered up and cooked for 30 minutes, the rice tasted like it just came out of the bag and the broccoli was still half-raw. I was extremely disappointed.

OMFG... this looked wonderful, but I can't figure out for the life of me what I did wrong. Followed the recipie pretty much, cut out the white rice, subsituted some veggies, then I decided to use Black rice (had wanted to try it out) instead of wild, as I always have brown rice around but I couldnt find plain wild. The rice wouldnt cook in the oven, transferred all to a pot, well it cooked, but Hehehehe... everything turned out dark purple cause of the black rice, which is cool, purple is my favorite color. So I had quite an adventure, and my boyfreind cracked up since the first thing he said when I told him what I was cooking was 'what meat are you cooking?'!

I didn't cover it so the rice didn't cook properly and I had to leave it in the oven for an hour. I'll follow the directions more clearly next time!! I added parsley, garlic and dill to add more flavor.

I didn't follow this recipe as written because the rices would have ended up done at different times. I used 1 cup of brown rice and increased the liquid to 3 cups and increased the baking time to 1 hour. It turned out nicely, but it was rather bland. I probably won't make it again.

The biggest problem with this is that the different kinds of rice take different amounts of time to cook!  I didn't have any wild rice, so I just used white and brown, and the brown rice was still crunchy when the white rice was done!  My advice would be to only use one type of rice, or maybe to undercook the brown rice first before baking it witht the rest.

It's fairly plain, but good. I added spicy black beans to the leftovers, and that seemed to help. Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the rice.  It all cooked together just fine, but I usually don't cook my rice until it's mushy either.
