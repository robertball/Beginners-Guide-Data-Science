Good for starting out, but the actual cheesecake filling needed something extra. I added some sour cream and heavy cream to the mixture since it was just cream cheese, knew it needed something else to provide a better, creamier cheesecake. I still think I should have added more, possibly another brick of cream cheese as well as more sour and heavy cream. I made a choc. drizzle for the top of 2 oz. melted semi sweet choc. and 1/3 c. heavy cream. After setting in the fridge the choc. was hardened a bit and I think it really helped the flavor of the cake. I think the recipe is a bit too plain written as-is, needs a bit of doctoring.

For a true cheesecake lover - this recipe didn't work for me. The flavor was very flat and it didn't have the sour cream which gives cheesecake a depth of flavor. 

If you are going to make this recipe, try doubling the vanilla and add a dash of lemon.

This came out pretty good, I did what the other reviewers suggested and added 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of sour cream and 2 tsp of vanilla instead of just 1.

fantastic and easy to make. i actually did slightly overbake it which gave it a slightly browned top... so i did a quick fix by coating it with Coolwhip and sprinkled the top with some (2) crushed oreos.

This is a cheesecake lover's cake.  It was very rich and dense.  It was also super simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly. I would add more oreos to the batter if I made it again.

Oh my gosh. This cheesecake was absolutely amazing! It was literally the best thing that I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out PERFECT! I made this for a foods project and my family loved it. It was so easy to make. I would think it would even be fun for children to make.

I give this four starts because it was pretty good and easy to make but mabey in my learning to cook i missed something cause it didnt set right. The middle was not cooked completely. I got so worried about all the reviews to make sure you dont let it overbake that i must have taken it out too early. It did bake for 40 min though so i dont know what happened. I will try this again!!

I give the recipe 5 stars because it is a great starter, but the recipe is unfinished. First of all, you should never have only cream cheese in the batter. I added a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk and a cup of vanilla yogurt. When you add the eggs, separate them first and stir the yolk and whites separately. This is a technique used for making cakes but for cheesecake will make the end result a light and fluffy cheesecake. I prefer it this way because you can really only take a couple bites of a heavy cheesecake. Then I used double oreos for everything. Double the oreo batter for the crust and double how many crushed oreos you put in the batter. Then I broke off chunks of oreos to add to the batter as well. While baking, I took the advice of another review on here and started the temp at 350 then lowered it by 25 degrees every 20 minutes while baking (bake for a total of an hour) then turn the heat off and leave the cake in the oven with the door closed for an additional hour. I didn't use a waterbath but using this method, the cheesecake came out perfectly smooth and crack-free!! It was incredible and we didn't even wait for it to cool completely before eating it because it looked so good!! Will definitely be making this again. One last note, make sure ALL your ingredients are at room temperature. Hope this helps and enjoy your cheesecake!!! :)

I chose to make these into 12 standard cupcakes using cupcake liners. I found a half a stick of butter worked better for the oreo crust. I doubled the vanilla extract, squeezed fresh lemon juice and added a ½ cup of sour cream to make for a creamier cheesecake. I filled each 18 cupcakes almost to the top and baked them at 275 degrees, rotating pan halfway through, until set in 25 minutes. I turned off the oven, cracked the oven door and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Once the cheesecake cooled I transferred them to the refrigerator for several hours. Probably the hardest part is waiting all those hours until they are chilled. The cheesecake didn’t crack. It’s not too rich, just creamy, smooth and sweet enough. I could see and taste bits and chunks of oreo cookies. I topped these off with, “Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting,” from this site, and decorated with mini oreo cookies for more visual appeal. These were easy to prepare and I gave them to hubs to share with his crew tonight.

This was great after I made some slight changes. I used the Ready to use Cheesecake filling instead of cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 2t vanilla, 1/2 pint sour cream, splash lemon juice and then I melted a couple handfuls of mini choc chip and whipped it with 1/3 c heavy cream and swirled it into the top of the cheesecake batter after poring it into the spring pan using a butter knife. YUM!

Great cheesecake.  I took this to a party and we had to cut the pieces pretty slim so that everyone could have a piece.  Instead of mixing the cookies into the batter, I chose to put a layer of cookies in the middle.  It turned out perfectly layered.  I also baked for about 45 minutes, turned off the oven, opened the door a little, and left the cheesecake in for about 2 hours.  No cracks.  Decorated with whipped cream and mini Oreos.

I followed the recipe, adding only an extra tsp of vanilla. I was very disappointed. It was not cheesecake at all. No tang. If  you are going to try this and want a real cheesecake flavor I would recommended adding another 8oz package of cream cheese of a cup of sour cream.

A coworker of mine wanted me to make him an Oreo Cheesecake.  I had no recipe so I decided to make this one....what a great decision that was!  I put in 1 1/2 t of vanilla instead of 1 t and I also crushed about 14 oreos instead of 8 for the inside and top of the cheesecake.  It was such a hit that I've been asked to makie another one SOON!  :)

I haven't tried the finish result, but from tasting the filling before baking- I know that it will be delicious. The MAIN problem I have with this recipe is the clarity. For someone who has never made, much less never had, Oreo Cheesecake... the recipe does not specify enough on what to do. Obviously for the crust you have to take the cream out of the cookies, but it does not say that. "24 Oreo Cookies, divided". Divided what? In half? Into 3rds? One pile of 8, One pile of 16? Divided how??? That may need to be revised and reworded to prevent confusion for other first-time bakers out there!

You really can't go wrong with this if you like Oreos and cheesecake! I did make some minor changes though. First the crust needs to be doubled, as is it barely covers a 9 inch springform pan. I also did 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of lemon and doubled (or so) the amount of Oreos in the batter. All in all I used a whole package of Oreos! If your going to make this, you are not going to worry about the extra calories of more Oreos!! It turned out great and is a big hit with family and friends.

This was first cheesecake recipe I've ever attempted and I didn't want to go overboard and dive into a more complected recipe for my first one. I followed the recipe to a t and it came out without any cracks and was cooked perfectly (tried the tip of shutting off the oven and cracking the door until cooled) but the flavor, while like cheesecake, didnt have the depth or richness that most cheesecakes have. I did enjoy the crust and will probably use that part of the recipe again, but defiantly ready to dive further into the cheesecake baking world to find a truly decadent one.

Cheesecake doesn't need to be intimidating!  My trick is to get those three bricks of cream cheese into the Kitchenaid stand mixer, add the vanilla and sugar, and just chug away for a long time, throughout the time that I'm preparing the crust, etc.  It creates a very smooth, creamy filling that is light but not airy.  I find an Oreo crust to be a bit too heavy for my preferences, so instead I used about 2/3 of a package of Nilla cookies (vanilla), crushed fine, with about 4 TBSP butter.    We served this for the Fourth of July, so as a decorative touch, we took six whole Oreos and removed one side.  Then, using a toothpick, I drew little starbursts and asterisks, and dripped a single drop of food coloring into each.  The toothpicks were helpful in smoothing the color out into the designs, and the result was a pretty, fireworks-looking little design on each cookie.  I cooked as directed for 30 minutes, then gently placed the decorated cookies on the semi-firm top and cooked for the remaining 15 minutes.  A delicious dessert, with cute little decorations on top!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 9.5 inch springform pan (I didn't have a 9 inch pan), and I topped the cheesecake with chocolate ganache (recipe also from this website). People were shocked to discover it wasn't from a bakery because it was so good and looked so pretty. Will make again!

Fantastic! Rather than mix the cookies in the cheesecake, i sprinkled the remainder on top after baking. I also grated some dark chocolate (60%)that is mint flavored.

This was pretty simple to make. Of course mine didn't come out as pretty as it did in the picture, but it still tasted great. Next time I will let the creamcheese settle, because my beater burned out on me while mixing. I was affraid that it was going to come out terrible because I had to whip it by hand, but it taste really good. I will be making this again.

6 STARS! I loved the aroma in the kitchen while this baked, reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time making cheesecake and I didn't know how easy it was! I used organic Newman-Os (just like Oreos) and all other organic ingredients to make the indulgence a little more environmentally friendly. Way, way, better than anything I have ordered at CF. Next time I aim on making a graham cracker crust and adding chips of peanut butter. :)

Made this for a friend's birthday since he loves oreos. I pretty much followed the recipe. I used a rolling pin to crush up the oreos.  I also used the Pro Ganache recipe on here as a topping. I made both this cheesecake and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake on here for a birthday party. Both were fantastic, but I surprisingly enjoyed this one more.

I'm giving it 5 stars because this is the closest I came across again for the one I made.[I used the Philadlehia cheese cake cook book again.] It uses one pkg. of oreos, 30 oreos and a 1/2 a siick of butter for the crust,& 4 pkgs of cream cheese. It's a monster of a cheese cake.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I thought it would be an easy recipe to teach my son how to make cheesecake. It turned out very dry. It needs sour cream or milk..... anything to give it that "melt in your mouth" softness. This did not have that. I will never make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I don't think I could have made a better cheesecake then this. I am not a huge fan of cheesecake but I just LOVED this. Not a huge overwhelming richness that cheesecake usually has which is probably why I loved this so much. You could easily serve this with a whipped topping and not have it be too sweet. I personally followed the recipe to the T and had no issues which is funny how others had so many issues. I was afraid of making this because of all the reviews and alterations. I am glad I made this and I will do so again!

Oh...my...gosh! This was my first time making a cheesecake so I was preparing  for it to be terrible, but this was AMAZING!!! I made 2 small changes (as recommended by a lot of other reviews). I added more Oreos than the recipe called for. It called for 24, I probably used closer to 35-40 (haha, I love Oreos!) The inside of mine was therefore a lot darker than in the picture...which was fine by me! And fine by everyone else who ate it. I also added two teaspoons of vanilla instead of just one. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this cheesecake as a surprise for my sisters birthday. She absolutely loved it! I ended up making two and it was great. However I did add about a tablespoon of heavy cream, and be careful not to over mix as well. The cream I found made it more dense and moist. Great and easy to make!!

It was good and easy to make, but not great. I have made lots of flavors of cheesecakes and this is not a repeater for me. I served it to company and didn't hear any yummy type comments.

A great easy cheesecake recipe especially for beginners like me! I read some of the earlier reviews and added about half a small container of sour cream, doubled the vanilla extract and a splash of lemon juice to the mix. I also used a bit more Oreos for the crust and found half a stick of butter worked better. I let it cool on a wire rack for about an hour before removing the side of the springform pan and placing in the fridge and it was perfect after about 4 hours! Enjoy!

My first attempt with cheesecake was an absolute success. Everyone in my family loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Suggestion: Serve with a side of sliced citrus fruit, it gives contrast to the flavors rich & creamy then clean & fresh.

Used red velvet Oreos instead. Also, I didn't put my remaining Oreos into the cream cheese/vanilla/sugar/eggs mix...I took the cream out of those cookies, crushed them, and sprinkled them on my baked cheesecake. Also put a thin layer of whipped cream on top ??

This recipe is very similar to the basic cheesecake I use as a base to play with.  Used only the chocolate cookie part of the Oreos in the crust with the butter; and added the cream filling into the cream cheese batter.

My teenage son and friends wanted to make a cheesecake one Saturady night and we chose this easy recipe.  Mixed ingredients and made exactly per recipe.  It went into the oven (lowered temp to 320 degrees because of dark pan) and I let the kids takeover from there.  Told them to make sure it wasn't jiggling in the middle before they took it out.
This morning I found it in the fridge only a few slices remaining so treated myself to some for breakfast.  OMG, this cheesecake is delicious!  I really don't care for "Oreo" anything, but I have to say, especially considering how easy it was to make, this is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted.  Totally rivals any Cheesecake Factory cheesecake for sure...

I was so feared up with taking on my first cheesecake, but I was seriously more than pleased with this. I changed things up a little to my own liking, but I feel like it'd be good regardless. I only used two eggs, added some heavy cream, and doubled the vanilla. I also used an obscene amount of Oreos. It was perfect. I'll make this recipe again in different cookie forms. Do it!

This was AMAZING!! So I am writing this review to be of help to future people who stumble on this like I did while on I was on Pintrest. After 30 minutes of arguing with my boyfriend over whether or not the white filling of the oreo should be crush up for the crust or not, I finally made the decision and did it anyway. It is not clear whether you should or shouldn't keep the cream with the crushed cookies, and in the picture it looks completely black. Well let me tell you, the crust was black and it was amazing WITH THE FILLING IN IT!! lol I love when I can prove men wrong. tehehehe (I think he secretly liked it too). P.S. I added about 2 TBL of Sour cream to my recipe after reading Ashley's review.

I must give this recipe a 5. It was very simple to make and i got so many compliments from it. The funnest thing after making it is plating it. I made it into single serve dishes and they turned out great.

I live in a place where many recipes call for ingredients I just can't get.  This recipe is as good as it gets...simple ingredients, easy to prepare, and crowd pleasing.  Great rich cheesecake flavor (and I know cheesecake) and the oreos take on a wonderful texture.  Not to mention I don't have any kind of a mixer so I made it with a potato masher and a wire whisk, turned out great.  I heat my cream cheese in the microwave to soften it before combining.   No need to "fancy" it up. Simple is good.

I found that putting the oreos for the crust in the cuisinart a much easier and faster way then using a rolling pin. It also makes for a finer, more easily pressed crust. I absolutly love this recipe! have made it a bunch of times.

I just made this and it came out too perfect! 

I will say, it won't come out good if your switching any of the ingredients to fat-free. I can totally see a recipe like that not having enough flavor or missing something. 

Mine came out very creamy and rich in taste. I'm always told baking comes so natural to me. =o)

I've made this recipe several times now and for some reason the resulting cheesecake always looks over-cooked.  The first time I assumed I just needed to adjust the time, but as of this last time it had only baked 35 min and already looked cracked and brown.  I would assume it's just my oven except I don't have problems with anything else.  If anyone else has run into this I would love to hear your solution!

This was my first attempt at making any kind of cheesecake and it was beautiful looking and tasted absolutely delicious. I brought it with me to a party and it was the only dessert that every single person wanted. The top cracked, even though I left it in the oven to cool, but you couldn't tell because of the Oreos on top. The only small change I made to the recipe was I added more crushed Oreos to the top.

I read the other reviews and added a dash of lemon juice and extra vanilla. Taste good and my family loved it. Simple to do too. I slightly overbaked it but luckily the inside was still soft and creamy. Will make this again another time.

So yummy! Followed the recipe exactly but added a few more Oreos to the batter and top as another person recommend. Everyone loved it! I didn't have the right cake pan so I just lined a regular pan with parchment and lifted it out after cooling it. Not picture perfect but good enough!

Four stars for some consistently mentioned things in other reviews.  There was a tanginess missing in the recipe.  Add the sour cream or yogurt.  Although making the cheesecake without it cracking seems to randomly happen when I do it.  I also “uppened” the recipe for a 9” spring pan...4 packages of cream cheese, 3 eggs and a yolk, 1 cup of sugar.  Just for kicks, I made a mascarpone ganache to cover up my cracks...my family loved it and the neighbors offered to buy one...

gotta say I'm impressed! tried a few different recipes and this one was the easiest and better tasting. one thing people are saying is that it's missing a few ingredients but take into account that it says EASY right in the title if you want a more complex flavor profile then go nuts that's why it's so good because you can add whatever other items you want but it's a great starting point and a great recipe by itself so don't let other people's tastes and reviews stop you from atleast trying it! :)

I only did 2 packages of cream cheese and divided the rest of the recipe down to do it smaller because I only had two cream cheeses but it still worked out great

This was a very easy and simple to follow recipe. I ended up doing this as a birthday cake for one of my friends. I knew they were going to be a lot of people so I doubled the recipe, which ended up making 2-9” pie pans and a dozen cupcakes. Going by the normal recipe, it calls for 3/4 cup sugar, doubling that is 1-1/2 cups of sugar, so I omitted half a cup of sugar and use the Oreo filling instead which balanced out the flavor of the cheesecake. It was the perfect sweetness for the cupcakes, I used the rest of the crushed Oreo I had for the crust and placed it at the bottom of the cups. This filled half the pan, for the other 6 I used while Oreos as the crust and placed the rest of the cheesecake filling on top of them. For the filling of the cheesecake and the Oreos on top, are used peppermint Oreos which added a nice flavor to it. Upon my little cupcake experiment, both were very good but I opted to go with the crushed crust. I hope you find this helpful!

I have made this several times, I put the oreo cream in with the batter and may consider adding sour cream and heavy cream at some point. for now it's a great savory and not too sweet cheesecake recipe that I can enjoy

Very indulgent. You can easily divide the recipe into a third to make variations of smaller flavours. Crush the Oreos very finely to cover the cake on top and it looks very nice.

I left the cream in the oreos when I made the crust (not sure if that was right). Based on previous reviews, I added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream and a few tablespoons of sour cream to the batter. I also doubled the vanilla and used 12 oreos in the batter instead of 8 and covered it with chocolate ganache. I made all these changes and it was still bland. Not a recipe I'd try again.

Lots of reviewers said you would need to add sour cream or cream, but I didn't and I have to say I really loved it the way it is! I guess maybe I'm just into a thicker cheesecake. I thought it was the perfect sweetness and texture! I used lactose free cream cheese and ALL the oreos. More than the recipe calls for, I like it with lots of oreo flavor and I was not disappointed! Just a note: watch this one in the oven. As other reviewers have said it overcooks easily!

This cheesecake was a big hit with my staff, but not at my family reunion.  A few people raved about it and others just liked it.  I thought it was pretty good, but not "knock your socks off" awesome.  
I would make this again.

This wasn't as great as I thought it would be. The crust got soggy.  It should have been pre-baked before the batter is poured  in. The flavor of the cake was unremarkable. I won't make this one again.

Easy and delicious. I used the food processor to get a fine cookie crust and set a little to the side to use in the cream cheese filling. It turned out great and my family loved it. I will use this recipe from now on.

I liked this cheesecake after it cooled overnight in fridge vs 3 hours after cooling cheesecake to room temperature.  I used Raskas Cream cheese and I think this cream cheese is phenomenal compared to Philadelphia brand for making cheese cake.  my husband never cared for Oreo cheesecake, but he enjoyed this recipe.  His favorite cheesecake is Chantal's New York Cheesecake which you can find in All Recipes.

Made it according to instructions. Simple and easy to make. Didn't have a springform pan though so it wasn't the best looking cake but the taste was definitely yummy according to everyone who tasted it!
I used Oliviani Olive Oil butter for the base.

My sister and i made this cheesecake, and it was the first cheesecake we've ever made, because of previous reviews, we added sour cream to it, and we used red velvet Oreos instead of regular, and while it did end up cracking in the middle, it was delightful, and loved by the whole family,

I was successful in making it, so there's a plus on it's side.
However, no matter what I did I could not get the crust up off the pan, I'm not looking forward to washing it. The resulting cheesecake was tasty and dense, the way I like it.  I will be making it again, but tweaking the amount of butter in the crust.

I give this a 4 because it tasted great but the consistency was not your typical cheesecake. I took some other advice from 2 other reviews and added a little bit of lemon juice and I used the whole package of cookies (cream and all). It reminded me of a cheesecake brownie because the texture was a bit thick. Next time I will try making it with sour cream and see if the consistency is better. Thanks!

it turned out so good, it was my second time making it and i added more oreos for my taste, but my family n cousins loved it, they asked me too make more for all of them, so I'm making a lot of batches today. overall everyone loved the cheesecake, it was so good n rich. Most my cheese cakes turn out spongy but this one was P.E.R.F.E.C.T. I'll make it again on special days. the cheesecae had my friends dying for more!

Easier to serve if you make this into cupcakes, I put a whole Oreo in the bottom of each cupcake paper and pour the batter over top, I also mix 1/2 cup chocolate chips into the batter and then bake same temp but for 25 minutes or until set. Spray whipped cream on top of each cupcake when serving, it's a huge hit!!!

Super easy recipe. The only things I did differently are...I used more Oreos for the pie crust (24) and baked it for 8-9 minutes. I also used more cookies to mix with the cream cheese mixture and to sprinkle on top of the cheesecake. Once the cheesecake cools I will drizzle caramel sauce on top.

It definitely needed some condensed milk, sour cream, and a tiny bit of flour. Otherwise, good recipe.

To me it was just OK. The guests gobbled it up.  Thought it could have been higher.  Probably won't make it again :(

Ive tried this recipe two different times. The very first time i bought the oreo pie crust. And I took some users advice and added a spoonful of sourcream, I also added some lemon extract just a teaspoon possible (I dont measure). The cheese cake turned out really good. Im sure I added more sugar it was rather sweet and very rich. I also used only one package of creamcheese. Now I made this yesterday from scratch and the pie crust wasnt so good. I may have added more butter than I was suppose to and cookies because it wasnt dried out.But the cream cheese was awesome. Il have to make this maybe two more times to perfect this.

Very easy to make! Great flavor, not too overly sweet. My husband likes it served with a drizzle of chocolate syrup.

this is a very simple  affective cheesecake, but i agree with the last review it needed something extra, so i advise you to add some 3 tbls of marshmallow fluff. it adds a different texture. you can purchase fluff from asda, Morrisons next to the peanut butter, give it a shot :)

This was the 1st time I've ever made a cheesecake that I actually had to bake, and the recipe was SUPER easy. I made it at my mother-in-law's house and it got rave reviews. Needless to say, I'll be making this one again.

I made this because I wanted an alternative to a graham cracker crust and it was perfect.  The only thing I did differently was that I made it a marbled cheesecake because I had some shaved semi-sweet chocolate I wanted to use.  It cam out beautifully, I included a picture on my profile of the finished product.

I have never made cheesecake before and this recipe was my first try, although it tasted great (I made it for a friend's birthday so there were many people who like it not just me) it looked nothing like a cheesecake :( After I took it out of the over it flattened.  Can anyone tell me where I went wrong because I am so willing to try it again!  Thanks!

This worked the best my Mom, Dad and Brother loved it except I used "chips ahoy" cookies instead of "oreos". They liked it way better.
