Wonderful drink! I found it while looking for something for cold nights, well this is the one! I will try it with a little coffee next time.

(The name made me expect tea to be the main ingredient.)  At times I drink hot milk with a couple of packets of Equal and a splash of vanilla in place of dessert. It tastes like a hot milkshake and is so satisfying.  When I was a kid, Mom sweetened warm milk with sugar for my sister and me to have at bedtime.  If the honey is too sweet, try a sprinkle of sugar or a sweetener.  Enjoy!!

I love this recipe - it's so simple and comforting when it's cold and rainy.  Add a sprinkle of nutmeg for a spicier variation.

This isn't the worst thing I've ever tasted but it's darned near close.  I'd recommend reducing the honey by at least half or skipping it altogether and going with sugar instead.

This is very soothing and yummy.  I put 1 tablespoon of honey, and that was sweet enough for me.  This is great!

My father used to make warm milk and honey for me when I was little, so this reminds me of that.  This drink is very good if you want something warm and comforting at night, but can't drink tea (or coffee) with caffeine too close to bedtime.  Or if you're a little hungry, since milk is filling.  The vanilla is a good addition, but not necessary, in my opinion.  However, this drink is very, very sweet.  I will definitely reduce the amount of honey next time.  I was a little misled by the "Milky Tea" name at first, but that's all right.

This was delicious!!  It's chilly here in VA and this drink really hit the spot.  I dipped a chamomile lemon tea bag in mine a few times just to give it a "tea" taste and it was great.  This is a good alternative to coffee.  For those milk and tea lovers out there..this is for you.  Stay Warm!!

Although I'm not a honey person I do like it in tea. I'm off today and I was surfing for something hot and comforting to drink as I can't seem to warm up no matter what I do. It got down to zero last night here in Jersey. This was really good with the addition of my nice warm  heating pad and a cozy blanket!

When I was little, a german lady made
this for me (without the vanilla,
which is a lovely addition) when I had
a sore throat, it really soothes. She 
told me that when she was a young girl
in her homeland, her mother and grandmother
would make this for her.
I forgot all about this sweet comfort
drink! Memories!
Nice for a "nightcap" too!

1 Tablespoon of honey I thought was enough to sweeten the drink.  It has a warm yummy 'milkshake' taste without all the sugar like in a real milkshake.

Very soothing and warm.  I am definately going to make my kids drink it when they have a sore throat.  I liked it and my three year old liked it.  My husband even liked it and I didn't expect him to, because he isn't too fond of honey.  I haven't tried it on my 8 year old, but she loves honey.  Yum to my tum.  Think I will go make a glass right now!

This does taste like a milk shake (a warm one-which isn't a bad thing).  It was a little too sweet for my taste, so next time I will cut back on the honey.

This was a wonderful hot drink.  It was kind of similar to a chai.  I knew the 2 T of honey would be too much for us, so I reduced it to 1 T and it was perfect.  This would be even better on chilly winter nights.

Really nice drink, and perfect for kids!  It's rainy and miserable here today, and my 8 yr old son came home from school all wet and cold.  I made this for him, and he just loved it.  It has a frothy type taste to it, and I can see that it would be very soothing when feeling under the weather.  Thanks for sharing, Danielle!

Wonderful recipe!! Perfect for cold or rainy days. I spiced  it up by added a pinch of nutmeg and its great. However, I did find 2 tablespoons of honey two sweet, so I used 1 tablespoon and two drops.

One of my favorite drinks at the end of the day. I use fat-free milk and sometimes, I'll add a little nutmeg. Very relaxing.

Oh dear, this is just not good.  It actually made me feel sick.  I don't know what went wrong..there are only 3 ingredients, all of which I like.  But the quantities were all wrong...way too sweet with all that honey, and the vanilla!  Yuck!  It was SOOO overpowering.  I just went back to check again that it really calls for a full teaspoon because that's just WAY too much.  You know what the worst thing is?  This smells DELIGHTFUL.  Don't believe your nose.  I took 4 sips, because I kept thinking it had to taste good when it smelled so good.  My husband even came in from the other room to see what I'd made, and tried it despite my warning (he hated it, too).  Sorry, but I think next time I'll stick with my own tried and true "recipe":  omit the honey and vanilla from this recipe and serve ice cold, preferable with a chocolate chip cookie on the side.

Before I made this I looked at the comments and almost ALL of them were saying,"...only used one tablespoon because two is to much sugar for me."so I used one tablespoon and it STILL was a little bit sugary! I hope this helps!

I thought the honey was way too sweet and that the vanilla was way too strong and alcohol tasting, so I halved both. I also added some pumpkin spice coffee creamer and cinnamon. Delicious!

A nice surprise, though the name is misleading. I made one mug per directions and it was too sweet/intense, so I made a second one with about 1 tbs honey and 3 drops vanilla, and it was much more drinkable. In fact, toned down it was very good, and will be a nice cold day drink when I want something sweeter than tea but not as rich as hot chocolate. I always like things sweetened with honey, it feels more natural/wholesome to me.

Starbucks offers tea lattes, which I love, but they are pricey.  I take a tea bag and steep it with this recipe.  It tastes almost identical to the more expensive version.

Nice recipe, but add honey after milk is hot--microwaving destroys honey's nutritional values.

I made this twice, exactly as written. I'd never had anything like it. It's deceptively simple, and was very tasty - a nice surprise. I think I might agree with the many reviewers who reduced the amounts of honey and perhaps the vanilla. I thought maybe those flavors were a little too strong. But overall I loved this drink. It served as a nice nightcap, with a taste reminiscent of white hot chocolate. I highly recommend this.

I would change the name to Flavored Milk since it has nothing to do with tea.  Not a fan.

This recipe is similar to "Hot Vanilla" and "Mom's Warm Milk" which are on this website too.  But, HOT VANILLA is my FAVORITE!!!!  I think Milky Tea is good but missing something.  I used flavored honey but it was still missing a spice.  I prefer Hot Vanilla due to the health benefits of the cinnamon in the recipe.  Either way, this drink fills you up after a light breakfast or as a calming, soothing, night cap.

YUM!  Great soothing drink for a dreary day...  I didn't quite put in 2 tbsp of honey.  For the people who gave it bad reviews, I'd recommend adjusting the honey & vanilla to suit your personal taste.

A simple treat that is very good. I think a little ready whip on top would be perfect decoration without overpowering the flavor.

This is a delicious drink, and is great to have when it is cold outside! 2 tablespoons of honey is way too sweet for me; I used 1 tablespoon, and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly until it came to the honey. It was a little bit to sweet with the exact amount of honey but if you add just a little less, then it is the most fantastic think in the world!!!! I drink it right before bed and it really helps me fall asleep fast. I really love it.

A couple of suggestions, first either cut honey to 1 tbs or substitute agave nectar for the honey. Second, to make this frothy and light, heat 1/2 of the milk in the microwave safe mug; then take the other 1/2 of the milk and put it in a large glass jar with a lid and shake for 30 seconds until frothy. Remove the lid and microwave for 20-30 seconds and top off the milk mixture in the mug

Very simple and very good. I don't normally like the smell of warmed milk but this was nice. I omitted the vanilla and used a little less honey and it was warm and tasty, I might try it with vanilla next time.

This hit the spot. I have been looking for an alternative to hot cocoa and this is it!  Sweeter than tea and a super treat.  I did add cinnamon for a bit of spice and surprise.  So easy to make and the perfect nightcap!  =)

Smells lovely but too sweet.  I strongly suggest reducing the amount of honey and vanilla.  I too was worried about the amount of vanilla when putting everything together.  I'll try this again with less sweetness.

This is a wonderfully simple and sweet recipe.  Quick, no fuss, and you can evenbe creative with it.  I ran out of vanilla extract so I used 1/3 Half&Half with 2/3 milk, a little less honey (approx 1 1/2 tablespoons), and about a tablespoon of real Vermont Maple syrup.  (I'm a Vermonter and grew up with it, so it's a kind of comfort treat.)  The half&half gave it that creamy taste, and helped balance the sweet flavors of honey and syrup.

For the amount of ingredients listed and the time it took to make, this is worth a try.  It is nice tasting, something different if you don't want cocoa.
