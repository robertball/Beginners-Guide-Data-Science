Very GOOD!  I halved the recipe, used yellow mustard in place of the mustard powder, cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and and 1/8 cup of vinegar.  I used this on the marinated grilled chicken II recipe.  DELICIOUS!  Simply, easy and not too sweet with cutting back on the sugar.  This makes a smaller serving amount than stated.  If you want to have extra sauce on the side make sure to double the recipe!

The first time I tried this, I used it in a crockpot pork rib recipe (Honey Ribs here on this site), so I diluted it a bit (didn't need too....it turned out too runny that way), but I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the ribs still turned out!  The 3rd time, I poured it directly over pork ribs abd baked them for about 1 1/2 hours, and ohhhh my goodness!  Soooooo delicious!!  These were the BEST ribs I have made in a long time, if ever!  The flavor was AMAZING!!  Very, very good!  And I love that it was so easy to throw together.  I am done buying BBQ sauce anymore, I'll just make it, because its so much better!

Great simple recipe.  I substituted garlic salt for celery salt and added a couple of dashes of liquid smoke. I would recommmend doubling the recipe if you are like my family & like a lot of sauce.

This is a great barbeque sauce!  I was able to make it very quickly and used it for ribs.  This sauce is sweet yet enough "kick" to it for those that like the tang or spice...VERY GOOD no matter what!

This recipe is awesome! I followed the directions exactly except I added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke like others did. I marinated chicken breast in the sauce for a couple hours then threw it all in a pan and covered it. Very flavorful.

This was excellent. I didnt' measure the ingredients but tried to be proportional. I think the allspice is the secret ingredient with this one, but dont' use more than called for or it will be overpowering.

Very good taste on the pork shoulders I cooked them on. I added Cayenne Pepper to my taste, gave it a little more heat. Great for eating and watching football.

Good bbq sauce!  QUICK & EASY!  I made it yesterday in a flash...served it as a warm dipping sauce for bacon-wrapped bbq shrimp. (Bacon-Wrapped Barbeque Shrimp by Jan from this site).  You've got to try this!!!

Delicious! Great place to start from and customize to taste.

I made a little change because I had no Worcestershire sauce. Swapped in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.

Oh, and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.

This was really nice!  I only made half the amount in the recipe to try it but will definitely make it again.   After making it as the recipe stated I thought it tasted a little bit sharp, so added a large teaspoon full of black treacle(Molasses??) That did the trick nicely.  On my next attempts I may try other extras just because this seems like a really versatile recipe.

I first used this on brined chicken - entire family raved about it - I put it through the blender to smooth it before liberally using it on the chicken in the last 5 minutes on the BBQ

Tastes Great.  Just a little too sweet for me.  Reminds me of the sauce at Favorite Dave's

I didn't have all of the brown sugar that I needed so I used 1/4 cup brown sugar w/ 2 tablespoons of molasses.
I will certainly use this recipe again.

Excellent. Doubled the recipe and sweat the onions in some olive oil then added the rest of ingredients. I simmered about 25-30 mins to really develop the sauce. Used with pulled pork and pulled chicken with rave results. Next time I might try adding a bit of liquid smoke and see where that takes the sauce. Perfect sauce though.

This is very delicious and I used it to make barbecue sandwiches out of tempeh. I cooked the sauce for 5 minutes and did not like the taste, but after letting it cook an additional 10 minutes I absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except I added garlic powder and used yellow mustard instead of mustard powder. Ironically, I wanted an alternative to the brand I normally use and this tastes just like it; Open Pit! Like Open Pit it is tangy and spicy, the only difference is it is sweeter. So if you are fan of that flavor (and would like to avoid unnecessary additives) then this is an inexpensive way to get the same thing. As for me, I am still looking for a BBQ recipe. However, I will definitely keep this excellent recipe and stop buying Open Pit.

sooooo good!! 

I didn't really follow the recipe though. I used garlic powder to replace celery salt and i used two pinch of mustard powder (I use English mustard) because my family loves the kick of the mustard. Together with my homemade garlic butter, they were the star of the evening.

I made this exactly as written, and I did not care for it.  The vinegar/ketchup taste is overpowering.  It is also incredibly runny.  Now I'm standing over the stove adding ingredients trying to salvage it.  I would NEVER make this again!

Just made this for chicken breasts on the grill-OUTSTANDING! I used onion powder instead of chopped onion, didn't have any celery salt and used regular mustard as I didn't have any mustard powder. YUM!

Never actually thought of this as a sauce, but this is almost (minus celery salt and lemon juice) my father's recipe for what we call "Jackwich"...his name is Jack and it is a play on Manwich...he adds these ingredients to browned ground beef and voila! Yummy and a family favorite we top with creamy coleslaw on a bun! I will now be using this recipe to make sauce for other things! Thanks!

This is VERY yummy, and a quick sauce to make! I omitted the onion (because I had none) and used prepared mustard instead of powder (about a tsp) - and it turned out great!!! I will definitely make this sauce AGAIN!

great base. Quick and ingredients I normally have on hand. I did put my own spin. Tonight we were out of worcestershire sauce so that was left out. I used 2TBSP dried minced onion, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1tsp mustard powder and then ended up adding a generous TBSP+ of prepared mustard, I also added 1-2 tsp of molasses.

Since using this the first time three weeks ago, my husband cannot get enough!!  I have used it with every leftover meat we have had.  I put the meat with the sauce in the crock pot. We have tried pork, chicken, and beef.  Fantastic.

This is really good barbeque sauce.  It was a little too sweet. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and maybe add some tobasco sauce.

Great recipe for sweet and tangy barbeque sauce.  I omitted the onions and allspice and added a little extra pepper.  Oh, and I simmered for 15 minutes instead of 5. It I a wonderful recipe as is, but I'll also want to play with it from time to time by altering with some of the ingredients others have suggested such as garlic powder, liquid smoke and honey.  I doubt I'll ever buy ready-made barbeque sauce again.

This sauce was excellent I will be making it again! I used apple cider instead of regular vinegar and I used the pulp from the lemons and added some hot pepper flakes and a little more brown sugar.

Yummy!!! this was a great sauce on my pork loin I smoked...easy...I had all the ingredients on hand. Definitely a keeper! Great base recipe...might try honey or agave in place of the brown sugar next time....maybe apple cider or balsamic in place of white vinegar.

My husband really liked this sauce. I used them on drumsticks. I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl, salted the chicken first then coated it in the sauce. I used the rest of the sauce to baste the drumsticks every 15 minutes for 45 minutes on a foiled lined baking sheet at 375. Then put em on broil for the last couple minutes. The sauce set in well and a bit of char on the skin from the broiler made this recipe super delish!

Really good bbq sauce!  I used this to re-use some pork roast and turn into bbq sandwiches.  Worked well and everybody ate happily!

It came out a little sweeter than I like even though I added some smoked paprika and chipotle chili poweder.  I ended up putting a little bottled sauce I had in with it to give it a better flavor.

This was a quick, easy, and delicious recipe! I used some unrecognizable meat that had been in the freezer a bit to long. Cooked it all day in the crock pot and added the barbeque sauce after I got home from work....DELICOUS....I used minced onions instead of fresh and some garlic salt instead of celery salt. Also I added some cornstarch to thicken it as I used it in pulled-pork like sandwiches. I agree, why buy barbeque sauce when you can make it this good! :)

this is a good recipe.  i used this on grilled chicken.  i used apple cider vinegar since i ran out of white vinegar. i added half the brown sugar and filled the rest in with honey as i wanted a honey flavor to my barbecue sauce.

You will want to double or triple this because it is so good you could almost drink it. Much better than any processed sauce and the kids loved it too! Made it just the way it is written(can't understand why others rate reipes but change the ingredients) with pulled pork over noodles. It's a sweet and tangy sauce that the whole family requested again.

I love this sauce! The first time I made it I didn't have all of the ingredients needed for the recipe but really needed to make bbq sauce, so I just made it with what I had and we all loved it! I kind of simplified the recipe... I leave out the worcestershire sauce and all of the spices besides the black pepper, and it's sooo good! I sometimes add a whole chopped up onion instead of the amount called for. The sauce is a thick sauce, which is what I like. And I've used it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and a whole cut up chicken (w/o) skin and it's delicious!(I just poured the sauce over and baked.) I have also used lemon juice instead of the vinegar and it still tasted great! Just for the record, I'm sure the sauce is fantastic made as written in the recipe, and I do plan on trying it with all the spices eventually.

I followed the recipe to a tee, and I must say that it turned out absolutely DELICIOUS! I used it on chicken, and allowed it to marinate for 3 hours before grilling it. Even my 2 year old loved this! It's a keeper :)

I have used this recipe for 2 years in place of store sauces, trying to avoid High fructose Corn Syrup, and MSG. It's great! My family loves it. We use it on baked chicken and on the grill. I use onion powder (1 Tbsp) in place of chopped, and a squirt of mustard in place of mustard powder.

Ok, everyone reading this, I want you to go into your cupboard and throw away any BBQ Sauce recipe you have. This is THE one! Do not alter it, you dont need to. I no longer purchase BBQ Sauce, one taste of this and you will never want to. DELICIOUS!!!

Note: I make this ALL the time.. Most notably with my signature pulled pork. Have not had one person not like it yet.

Just made this...it was great! I always try to follow a recipe exactly as it is written,but I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used molasses in the place off brown sugar and cloves in the place of the allspice. It is fantastic! Thank you for the great recipe.

This recipe was great even with all my substitutions that i added. I have very 3 picky eaters  at home this includes my husband , 5 yr old & my 9 yr old and they all loved the recipe. Even though i made these changes because I was k lacking  the quantities  of some ingredients,  but my family was really impressed . I used half a cup of ketchup with half a cup of tomato paste and I used garlic mustard instead of mustard seed.  Additionally, I used half of a cup of brown sugar with the remaining of honey. Overall, they loved it and I would definitely try this again and hopefully I can have the actual ingredients next time :)

This is a great recipe but way too much sugar in my opinion. I ended up doubling the lemon and all of the spices and adding more vinegar in an effort to cut the sweetness which helped a little.

This is a great recipe to use with anything, but my favorite is to use it on Country Ribs and thrown in the crockpot to cook all day.  It is sweet (not spicy) so the kiddos love it!

We found this sauce to really taste heavily of ketchup, it took a lot of doctoring before I was ready to use it on my chicken (cooked in the crock pot).  I will have to keep looking.

VERY easy to make!  Made a huge batch (36 servings).  Modifications due to ingredient availability in the kitchen: - used 750mL (one large bottle) of Heinz Hot & Spicy ketchup. - omitted Worcestershire sauce and allspice. This tasty sauce keeps in the fridge for several weeks (in my experience) and is awesome with chicken.  I'm glad I didn't use regular ketchup, as the Hot & Spicy version adds heat to this BBQ sauce, which I love!

I just put this sauce together because there was no more bottled sauce in the pantry. Judging from the wonderful smell wafting from the kitchen, I won't be buying the bottled stuff anymore. This is so good! We're having chicken tonight but I can't wait to try it with pulled pork. I followed the recipe as written.

I planned on making ribs for dinner and was sure I had some BBQ sauce on hand in the cabinet; when I went to look for it there wasn't any...so I went to allrecipes.com and found Nana's Barbque Sauce.  It was easy and quick to make and was absolutely delicious.  It made me a star that evening for dinner.  A big thumbs up for Nana's BBQ Sauce...

I made baked chicken last night using this wonderful sauce.  It was a hit with my company.  I made it with Trader Joe's Organic Ketchup because my daughter is allergic to the corn syrup in other ketchups.  We all loved it and I will use this recipe again and again.

This was my first attempt at making BBQ sauce, & I was very pleased with the results! I had to make a few substitutions just b/c there were some ingredients I didn't have on hand. I used cider vinegar, garlic powder (instead of celery salt), lime juice instead of lemon, & I omitted the onion (can't stand them!) It was so easy & tastes better than most of the bottled stuff...I will definitely use this recipe again!

This sauce is AWESOME!  I didn't have onion on hand, so I used dehydrated chopped onions and onion salt instead of the celery salt.  I added cayenne pepper and chili powder (didn't realize it at the time), dill weed and about 1 cup of Sam Adams Winter Brew.  Of course it was pretty spicy because of the first two additives so I put in another 1/4 cup or so of brown sugar and a good long squeeze of ketchup to bring it down a notch (and that's when the beer got added too).  It came out BEAUTIFULLY!

this was a good starter sauce. there are so many different types of bbq sauce out there, and i just might not like this style. for those of you out there who tried this sauce and didn't think it tasted anything like the sauce you are accustomed too, just add molasses to taste. it does wonders.

Fantastic bbq sauce. So very easy to make. This recipe as is can handle anyones taste buds. Next time I would like to try bacon bits or fried bacon pieces while its cooking for a smokey flavor. The only thing I changed was I added a few drops of hot sauce.  Allison TYVM for this recipe, my hubby and kids loved it.

I didn't have any bbq sauce, so i looked up recipes & chose this one. I put it in the crock pot w/6 chicken thighs for about 3  hrs. Delicious!!! Chicken fell right off the bone. I've never made bbq sauce f/scratch, but i don't think i'll use the store bought kind anymore! This stuff was so yummy! (Only thing i didn't add was allspice... I don't buy it bcuz i never use it.) :)

I have been making this yummy barbeque sauce for some time but just realized I've never rated it. This is the BEST sauce ever. The first several times I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. I now use different sweeteners like honey, molasas , I've even used Splenda. I've used dried onion flakes, liquid smoke, different vinegars and every time I get a great tasting sauce. I highly recommend this barbeque sauce.

I tried this because I was in a pinch and I am glad I did. With no BBQ Sauce in the pantry using the ingredient search I decided on this recipe. Cut the brown sugar back a bit and used cider vinegar. We liked it.

On its own this has too much of a ketchup taste to me, but when we used it on chicken and grilled it the sauce took on a nice flavor.  Probably not something I would serve to a guest, but easy to make and a pretty good flavor for quick a weeknight family meal with on hand ingredients!

Very good, but after settling it becomes a bit too sweet.  I think I cut back the sugar required, but I can't remember now.  I just remember thinking that this one was worth keeping!

Great sauce!  I got great reviews from my guests too.  I might use a little less sugar next time, but that's just my taste.  I added about 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg as I'd seen in another recipe and it was good.  I didn't have allspice or celery salt to put in and substituted prepared mustard for the mustard powder.  Tasted great!

This was fantastic and it was so quick and easy to make! I also used garlic salt instead of celery salt and a smokey onion mustard instead of mustard powder. I loved this sauce on ribs and will use it regularly.

It wasn't bad but too much worchestershire sauce taste. It was super quick to make though.  I did have to tweak it for my tastes. I added an additional 1/4 cup brown sugar. About 1/2 tsp molasses and about 2 tsp honey and a few more squeezes of ketchup.

This one was a bit too sweet for me with not much flavor.  All I could taste was ketchup, sugar and vinegar.  I Turned this into a half recipe of Big Al's K.C. BBQ Sauce.

My family loved this bbq sauce.  I doubled the recipe and used lemon juice to taste since I was out of vinegar. I also used garlic salt instead of celery salt. Excellent recipe!

This is a good base sauce recipe.  The allspice and worcestershire give it good depth of flavour.  Just add a dash of this and that - whatever you like - to make it your own!

This is a simple and great tasting recipe!  I love that it uses ingredients already on hand.  I liked it as written, but also tried with liquid smoke for a variation.  Both ways are good.  Ingredients can be added to suit your families tastes.  Definately worth a try.

This sauce is great!  It was quick and had simple ingrediants that most people already have on hand.  I did add some crushed red pepper because my husband likes a little kick with anything he eats.  This was excellent on grilled chicken.

I found this recipe to be very easy and delicious.  I added a little honey and fresh cut jalapenos.  I also put in cayenne pepper because I like it hot.

The sauce was too sweet and sour tasting to me.  Needed more BBQ flavor.  My boyfriend really didn't like it.

Thank-you Nana. I was having a small party and I ran out of bbq sauce for my appetizers. This recipoe was not only a life safer, it was absolutely yummy. My guests couldn't believe that I had made this on my own. I will never buy BBQ sauce from a store again. thanx..
