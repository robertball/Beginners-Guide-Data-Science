I made this for for a small dinner party and it came out very good.  I did skip the sugar and used grape tomatoes instead of cherry.  I also sprinkled it with a mixture of italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, which gave it a nice touch.  It was a nice change from plain ol' green beans! Would definitely make again.

This was very good!  A neighbor went on vacation and he told me to help myself to his garden!  He had a lot of green beans and cherry tomatoes so I found this recipe on the ingredient search.  I omitted the garlic salt and saut√©ed 2 cloves of garlic and a small shallot (like another reviewer) in the butter and then added the tomatoes.  I then added salt, pepper and basil and then I placed the green beans in the skillet so they could get a little of the spices cooked in them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A great idea to perk up ordinary green beans, but I found the addition of sugar to be distracting-- too sweet even with only a tablespoon.  Mind you my husband and children had no complaints! Will definitely try again without the sugar.

This outstanding vegetable dish had my vegetable-hating extended family raving at Thanksgiving dinner, and they REQUESTED it again for Christmas! Easy to prepare, BEAUTIFUL to present, good for you -- what's not to like? I steamed fresh green beans, sauted slivered garlic cloves in the butter, used grape tomatoes sliced in halves (less watery than cherry). I tossed the steamed beans into the butter & garlic concoction and sauteed a bit more, then added the tomatoes when I turned off the heat, so they simply picked up the warmth of the already prepared dish, and did not actually "cook" and get mushy. Fabulous, and THANK YOU for this one!

Love this recipe as is, have made it often, but as a variation I add a little minced fresh garlic and onions to the butter, sugar, salt, pepper & basil.

These were wonderful and looked absolutely beautiful! I used frozen whole green beans (16 oz), 1 cup of halved grape tomatoes, increased  the fresh basil to 1T, and added more salt.  Delicious!

I omitted the sugar on purpose and the basil because I forgot, but these were still delicious without either. I chose to use fresh minced garlic rather than garlic salt, but I do think that would have been just fine too.  I think 10 minutes cooking time is far too long - test after 5-6 minutes.  I used Haricots Verts and five minutes cooked them to the "just tender" stage I prefer.  (I hate crunchy "cooked" vegetables) Less cooking time, no sugar, and fresh minced garlic elevates this to a 5-star rating.

Good recipe.  I halved the butter and it was plenty.  Next time I will use less sugar as it was a bit too sweet for my taste.

This turned out fantastic, but I did make a few changes. I substituted 3T. olive oil for the butter and whole grape tomatoes for the halved cherry tomatoes. Also I reduced the sugar to 1t. since the tomatoes were naturally sweet. I used about 4 cloves of fresh garlic, minced and 1/2t. salt to replace the garlic salt. Served this with freshly grated parmesan cheese... it got a big YUMMMM from everyone at the table :)

I am glad I decided to make this tonight. I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful this vegetable dish turned out. I parboiled my string beans, placed onto the side, then only added a tab of butter in extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan. I added cherry tomatoes, fresh chopped basil, 1 garlic clove, fresh ground black pepper. After reading what others said about the sugar factor I cut back the amount to 1/2 tsp, in fact, I think I used less, more like a generous pinch. I did not pour the tomato mixture over the green beans to toss, I added the green beans back into the pan along with the cherry tomatoes and tossed everything together for 1 minute before finishing. The results were wonderful. I am glad I can adjust the amount of seasoning to my tastes. There was a slight crunch from the bright green beans and the sweetness from red cherry tomatoes was not overpowered by the pinch of sugar I added and fresh basil. This made a very attractive dish with the colors of the vegetables once plated. I found it also pleasing to be able to use my fresh herbs and vegetables from my garden in this side dish, really makes a difference using all fresh ingredients. This was a 5 star rating in my opinion and worth trying for those wanting something different for a side dish. I will make this again with other types of meat dishes.

Found this to be too sweet for our taste buds as written.  The second time I served this I cut back the sugar to one teaspoon and let the natural sweetness of a good garden sweet cherry tomato finish off the sauce.  Wonderful way to use summer's bounty of fresh produce.  Thank you for the recipe starnetsa.

Wow, what a flavorful sauce!  To avoid the missing salt others noted, I just salted the water that I cooked the beans in.  This prevented any salt problem.  Instead of garlic salt, I borrowed others' tips and sauteed minced garlic and shallot in the butter (I cut the butter in half and added 1 T of olive in), then added the tomatoes, basil and 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper.  I used a TON more basil than called for - 2-3 TABLEspoons, not 1.5 teaspoons.  This made an incredibly flavorful sauce.  I added the beans and cooked in the sauce, stirring often, for about 2 minutes.  I think this recipe would be great at room temperature also, so it would be good for entertaining as a make-ahead dish.  THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE, I L*O*V*E it!

These were really good.  I substituted the 1/4 cup of butter for 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter.  I also omitted the garlic salt and used one thinly sliced garlic clove. I only used a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  I salted the water when I cooked the green beans and didn't add any additional salt to the recipe.  I sauteed the garlic in the oil and butter for a minute or so over low heat to keep it from browning, and then added the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Instead of using another pan.  I cooked the green beans first, made the sauce in the pan, and then tossed the green beans with the sauce in the pan.  The fresh basil really makes this dish outstanding so I recommend using  fresh instead of dried.

This is a wonderful recipe, easy to make, and so
very colorful. I was a little leery about the sugar,
but it works well, just adding a hint of sweetness
to the recipe. I've made it with both fresh basil and
dried, and fresh works best. Don't cook the tomatoes
too long or they get mushy; about 2 or 3 minutes.
A 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

I used 1 tsp of sugar (instead of 1 tablespoon) and subbed garlic salt with fresh garlic: came out great! I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  5-star side all the way and easy too!  It's so good that whenever I can find fresh green beans at a decent price, this goes on the meal plan.

I made these wonderful beans last night (along with the grecian pork tenderloin, which was a total flop, by the way) and my guest couldn't stop complimenting me on them! Even my fiance had seconds and he is not crazy about green beans. I think the amount of sugar you add depends on how sour your tomatoes are and on your own personal taste. I used fresh garlic and half salt, half seasoning salt, and just a tad less butter than the recipe called for. Also, I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I used dry basil and it turned out great. This was fantastic; this is my new green beans recipe. Mmmmm. THANK YOU!

I am not a fan of green beans at all. This recipe has changed my mind. I took the advice of members before me and cut down on the sugar to my own personal taste. I did not have any fresh basil handy either, but added in parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs...Will make this when I entertain for sure!!

A wonderful way to eat your veggies.  I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes because that was what I had on hand.  Be careful not to overcook the tomatoes or they be smushy.  Either way they still taste great.

Absolutely 5 stars!  I've made this recipe many, many times.  Don't make changes to the recipe, and don't try it with dried basil - always use fresh as it makes a big difference.  Can easily cut the recipe in 1/2 or double it with no change to the end result.  I choose this recipe often for simple suppers with my family as well as when I am entertaining.  SUPER- DUPER!

This was great. The only thing I would change next time is more garlic, perhaps fresh. I am dealing with an overabundance of both beans and tomatoes right now, so this was very handy to use them up! Thanks for a great, easy recipe. UPDATE: Made this again with beans I had canned last summer; I used a quart jar and omitted the first step. Not as good as fresh, but tasty for canned green beans!

This was very good and a great compliment to Quick Chicken and Wine, also found on this site.  I followed the recipe as stated, but next time will cut down on the sugar because it was a little too sweet for me, although hubby thought it was perfect as is.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe for those of us who have an abundance of green beans and cherry tomatoes from our gardens. My family loved it. I omitted the garlic salt and saut√©ed 2 cloves of garlic and a small shallot in the butter before adding the tomatoes, then added a pinch of salt. I also decreased the sugar to 1 teaspoon since my tomatoes were very sweet on their own. When I served them I grated a little fresh Parmesan cheese over the dish. I know I'll be making this recipe again!

Outstanding recipe! If I could give it more than five stars I would. Looked beautiful and was so easy to prepare. Even my picky kids liked it. I made this for my husband's birthday last night and served with grilled filet mignon and the sugar snap peas with mint recipe from Allrecipes. Great flavors. The red/green color combination was really beautiful as well and think this would be great as a Christmas dish. Used french cut frozen green beans.

Delicious and easy side dish. I only added about a tsp of sugar and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was really impressed with how well these flavors blended together.  I used two cans of green beans, drained, instead of frozen, so I omitted the first step.  It was great!   I was looking for a colorful side dish to serve with pork chops and mashed potatoes, and this was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

It was great, everyone loved it. After reading the reviews, I followed some recommendations and changed a few things. First, I sauteed garlic and shallots in olive oil then tossed the cooked beans in. Added some butter (not the full amount) and doubled the basil. So many had mentioned the tomatoes getting too soupy, so I used grape tomatoes and halved half of them, left the others whole. It was great! Chopped up some fresh mozzarella once it was chilled. I'll definitely be making this again and recommending the recipe.

Love these. So easy and great tasting. Leftovers are not that great though so I would make just enough or eat them all. Also, don't over cook. Otherwise awesome flavor.

Although I love fresh green beans and cherry tomatoes, I wasn't too crazy about trying this one. I  didn't think I would like cooked cherry tomatoes with green beans. Shows you how little I know. The taste was phenomenal. I did make some minor changes. I prefer to steam my vegetables and I love fresh garlic over garlic salt. I didn't heat the tomatoes in the sauce ... I was afraid they would turn to mush. I put them on top of the cooked beans and gently folded them in. So yummy! I didn't want to share!

This was incredibly good---I followed the recipe to the letter, and would only change one thing next time:  I will reduce the sugar to a scant teaspoon.  Otherwise, no changes---we loved this!!!! Thank you!

Easy, quick and delicious side dish.  For once I had fresh basil and this dish just sounded yummy.  The only ingredients I changed were the garlic salt - replaced with sea salt and red pepper flakes and I upped the basil threefold.  The tomatoes added a golden color to the butter, adding the basil near the end, I just let them wilt before turning off the heat and tossing this with the cooked beans.  The sauce these ingredients create was so yummy, I used a piece of bread to wipe my plate clean.

Wow!!  Even when I modified this to make it 'healthier' it was still amazing!!!  I used EVOO and no butter.   I steamed the beans in a steamer basket for 10 minutes instead of submerging them in boiling water (less nutrients lost).  And only used 1 cup cherry tomatoes.  This is the yummiest dish.  I never knew I could love green beans OR cherry tomatoes this much!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a nice change from my normal bean recipes. Flavors blended nicely.  I will definitely make again.  I did cut the butter in half, to try to make it a  little healthier and it was still very tasty.  I think you could do it with even less since there is so much liquid in tomatoes. Thanks for sharing.

Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! A small bag of cherry tomatoes was $3.49 so I bought Italian tomatoes and cut them up into small pieces instead. Would make a fantastic side dish to grilled meat. Might taste really good chilled too.

We like this one.  I did add extra basil because there wasn't the flavor I was looking for.  Add'd only 1tsp.  It was great.  My husband even liked it.  He's hard to please.

We liked this dish a lot. Easy, fast and healthy. I used frozen mix of green and yellow beans. I added some salt to the water and beans,  used fraish garlic and triple the amount of basil.

Wow.. super easy and amazing!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and had tons of compliments!  I found the sauce at the end too runny so I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up, making it a thicker sauce which coated the beans. Wow.. definitely a keeper!

Delicious and easy!  Definitely use chicken broth for cooking and butter for the sauce.  I adjusted to 1 tbsp of dry Basil (had no fresh), 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.    I didn't cook the tomatoes, just halved and dropped them on top of the cooked beans, then poured my butter sauce over top.

This recipe is great!  I steamed fresh green beans.  Once the sauce with the tomatoes was ready, I put the beans in the pan, and tossed them for a few minutes.  I served them to friends, and I was asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

hey, I'm a tweaker! I followed the recipe until I decided the reviews had merit and I ventured down that course. I used the suggestion of much less sugar, Italian bread crumbs and some grated parm. cheese. I don't understand why folks get bent out of shape if you can see a recipe has potential and you customize for your family..anyways, I appreciate the recipe as written, but...after reading the reviews this recipe was enhanced. hey, think about it...do you still drive a model T?

We got a big bag of beans and a big lot of cherry tomatoes from our CSA and I found this. I made it as directed but added some parmesan cheese before serving. My father-in-law said these were the best green beans he'd had in his entire life and he is 79 and spent most of his life growing whatever he ate. So that's saying something.

I made about half of this recipe omitting the sugar altogether.  I cooked my beans for only 5 minutes, which made them perfectly crisp tender.  I tossed the beans with a little butter and topped them with the tomato mixture.  This was very good and a nice way to use beautiful summer produce.

Nice recipe. I made it as written except for the sugar (Diabetic daughter) so we used Splenda at a half of a Tablespoon. I added some Tarragon since I had some.
This was loved by the whole family- kids especially. 
Thanks for sharing.

Holy cow!  This is SOOO good.  I could eat this every night and it's incredibly easy to make.  This will become a weekly staple in our home, I can tell already.  The only adjustment I made was replacing the sugar with honey because we had no sugar.  Worked perfectly, and perhaps, it made the sauce stick to the vegetables better than sugar would have.

Tasty recipe - I used all ingredients as they were listed - threw in a few croutons just before serving.  I only gave it 4 stars because there was too much butter for me - I'd cut back on that (adjusting the other ingredients), but leave the quantity of green beans the same.  Taste was good.

Very good. I had really fresh green beans so I made sure to use fresh tomatoes and basil too (usually I would have used canned/dried), it was perfect. I did use 3tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil with good results. Thanks very much for sharing.

This was nice and refreshing.  The store did not have fresh basil, so I used the chopped fresh basil in a tube.  I also substituted 1 Tbsp olive oil for butter and skipped the sugar.

This is a great side dish. Of all the recipes I have made from Allrecipes it is now one of my favorite. Just a great surprising taste. Normally you have a slightly bitter taste from the tomatoes but not at all present probably due to the sugar added.

These are the best green beans!  I love the sweet buttery tomatoes with the beans.  No more leftovers when we have these.  Could cut down on the butter to make them healthier as I always have extra sauce after all the beans are gone, probably due to the tomatoes losing their juice.

This was an easy and different way to prepare produce from my CSA- I used a little less butter and cut the sugar by about 1/2-  The "eye appeal" is great as well!  Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! We loved this one. I was also cooking this recipe for a diabetic, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and it came out great. Thanks!

The garlic salt and the sweet sugar flavor combined with the fresh basil had a really odd flavor, to us. This has gotten great reviews, but I guess we all don't like the same things. Sorry.

This was a very nice combination of flavors. I steamed the green beans first (they stay crisper). I also sauteed the tomoatoes whole in olive oil and garlic to get things started (until their skin started to soften a bit). Then I added in the rest of the ingredients. The cool part is you could make the beans the day before to save yourself a bit of time. I made this on the  grill using the side burner. GOoes great with chicken  or white fish.

Good and easy to prepare recipe.  Like otheres my only complaint is the mush factor with the tomatoes.  Next time I will keep them whole as I buy the little grape ones it should be fine.  I did cut the sugar to 1/2 tsp.  and only a little sprinkle of salt.  Will make again thanks!

Be careful not to cook the tomatoes too long because mine were a bit mushy.  Other than that, the recipe was perfect.  All I changed was adding a bit of chicken broth to the tomatoes mixture.

lets just put it this way...my 8 year old step son gobbled them up! So good. I used olive oil instead of butter, I used grape tomatos, and I used garlic pepper itstead of the garlic salt and pepper. I also steamed the green beans(better for ya that way). Thank you so much. I just emailed this recipe on to some family and friends.

This is a really colorful, tasty dish.  Great as a side dish for an Italian meal.  I used the packaged fresh green beans and just pierced the package and microwaved for a few minutes to soften the beans instead of boiling them.  I reduced the butter and sugar a bit based on other reviews.  I used grape tomatoes watching close not to overcook.  Will make again.

I only added half of the sugar called for and still found this dish way too sweet for my taste. However, I think it would be delicious without the sugar so I will definitely make this again with that one modification.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 the butter and added some evoo. I didn't add sugar (not needed) and used dry basil. We like our green beans saut√©ed so I remove the tomatoes before they get too soft, add the beans to the pan for a few minutes and add the tomatoes back before serving. Everyone loved it

Just OK as written, with a change from garlic salt to 2 cloves minced garlic (saut√©ed in the butter first) and 1/2 tsp. salt. If I make this again I would double the basil and reduce the sugar.

Such a surprisingly good side dish!  I first had green beans like this as a side dish at a small restaurant in North Myrtle Beach, SC.  We were told it was a "restaurant specialty," so when I found the recipe here on AR I was anxious to try it.  The only thing I changed was to add some fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Absolutely delicious!

So quick and easy with fresh veggies from the garden! Really tasty and the basil just adds that touch! I didn't add sugar because I made it for 3 diabetics. Try to quickly saute the tomatoes....just enough to heat thru so you can still taste the freshness of the garden! Great summertime side dish!

I wasn't so thrilled with the cherry tomatoes but since the directions stated to toss them and not really cook them, the dish was pretty good.

Terrific flavor.  Used basil from my garden, freshly ground pepper & had grape tomatoes left whole.   My favorite green bean recipe so far.   (I did leave the green beans longer in the skillet & added more water as needed to try to soften them up more.  I cook for my grandparents who are used to canned only... & I'm trying to make them work with their teeth... but so far no luck).   They were outstanding as they were & would have been even better crisper!  Yum!  I did put a touch less sugar than a whole TB, maybe 3/4 of one.  I'll probably ease it down to see how little I can put it & still have it be awesome. =)

Very good w/the following changes. Substitute bacon fat for butter, no sugar but a bit of balsamic, real garlic and a shake of salt rather than garlic salt. Tolerated  even by my non-green bean lovers.
  6/17/12 Made recipe as is...and it is good too.

Me gusta! Great flavor and a snap to prepare. I preferred to sear my tomatoes a little bit longer, but this was excellent and made use of the abundance of cherry tomatoes from my dad's garden. This is a beautiful side dish as a bonus....it will liven up any dinner presentation! We will surely be making this again. Thank you for submitting!

This recipe is excellent as is!! However, I did change butter to olive oil, used just a sprinkling of stevia instead of sugar, and then tossed in a little goat cheese right before serving...which put it absolutely off the chart!

I get bored with green beans, and I don't especially love tomatoes -- but I could eat them (both) like this anytime!

The flavor of this combination was wonderful. I used frozen green beans, rinsed them with warm water to partially thaw, then tossed them with olive oil and salt pepper in a shallow baking pan and roasted them at 500 for about 8-10 minutes. Meanwhile, I melted 1/8 cup butter, 2 t. minced garlic, and the basil.  I poured the sauce over the beans after they were roasted and then tossed the cherry tomatoes into the mixture. A fantastic mixture of flavors - next time I may substitute red pepper for the tomatoes.  (4 stars because I didn't boil the beans, use sugar, and cut back on the butter.) Thanks for a great recipe idea!

Yummy!!  My husband requests this all the time now.  He likes that it has a hint of sweetness. Easy to modify depending on what you have on hand.  Have used fresh basil or dried.  Minced garlic from the jar I keep in the fridge.  A little sea salt.  And a great way to use cherry tomatoes that are too ripe for salads.

YUM!  I was only making enough for myself, so I estimated on amounts...I used a little less sugar than my scaled down version probably called for and added olive oil to cut the salty taste because I used salted butter - this sauce was to die for and I am not ashamed to admit I licked the bowl!  Next time I will throw some shallots in the mix.  Great way to use up my garden goodies!  Thanks, PeanutPutter.

I was browsing Allrecipes looking for something to have for lunch. I'm so glad I saw today's review of this recipe! The only changes I made were to cut way back on the sugar - just added a little pinch - and I used half butter, half olive oil. When it was ready, I stirred it all in with mixed salad greens, English cucumber in wedges, and sliced radishes. Absolutely delicious! Thanks!

This was a very easy and tasty vegetable dish. I cannot say how much I enjoy seeing my kids eat green beans without making funny faces. I followed the recipe exactly and will make this again for sure! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us, STARNETSA.

Great combination of flavors.  I changed all amounts and added everything except the butter and used garlic powder instead of salt, reducing fat and sodium.  I used beans   from the garden and slivered and blanched them before I knew how I would prepare them.  Once I decided on this recipe I simmered the beans  in 1 cup water with one teaspoon reduced sodium powdered chicken bouillion until tender, then drained. Then used a drizzle ( 1 1/2 teas) of olive oil instead of the butter, maybe 1/2 teaspoon sugar, a dash of garlic powder, and used dried basil as my fresh was no longer "fresh".  All the flavors combined well and didn't at all need the fat from the butter  or the sodium from the salt. Can't wait to try it with fresh basil and will probably use  minimum double the amount.

These were just okay. Very greasy and the butter/basil sauce is quite bland. I followed the recipe exactly, but if I made these again I would definitely add more basil and less butter, perhaps even substitute olive oil. Presentation is nice though.

I really loved the uniqueness of this side dish. Also the way it smelled when cooking was.......OH......so........GOOD! The beans tasted GREAT, the tomatoes throw me off a bit, but I liked it. This dish is on the sweet side so really think about what you are going to pair it with.

Great simple green bean side dish. I used fresh garlic- instead of garlic salt (saute for a few minutes with butter before adding other ingredients) and grape tomatoes. Fresh tasting and beautiful color.

This is such a good summer recipe.  We used fresh veggies and it turned out wonderful.  The flavors blended very well together and one didn't overpower the other.  We will be making this recipe often.

This recipe turned out great and I followed it plus a mix from other reviews on here.  Changes I made were, to simmer the tomatoes in the butter sauce for a few minutes and then pull them out and set them aside before they got mushy.  Then, I only simmered the green beans for about 8 minutes and then transferred them into the low simmering butter  sauce for about 2-3 minutes just so they got some of the sauce flavoring mixed in.  Then I just arranged the beans nicely on my plate, lined up the tomatoes so they looked pretty as in the recipe photo, poured the butter sauce on everything, and then added a light layer of crumbled bacon.  Now I am afraid my wife is going to want me to keep cooking.

I only gave this a four start as I followed some suggestions and altered this a bit.  I don't think people should rate a recipe that they have changed because then they are not really reviewing the recipe that is written, they are rating what they turned it into.  Having said that, I made these small changes: I blanched the beans in salted water, then I sauteed fresh garlic in the butter, added the beans, then the basil.  Then I added the tomatoes for the last couple of minutes and just a pinch of sugar to balance it out then topped with fresh grated parm......it was sooooo good!

I don't love green beans, but I did love this recipe! I used a few chopped garlic cloves instead of garlic salt, and dried basil because I didn't have any fresh. Also, following other reviews I cut the sugar in half. It came out great!

I made this dish for Christmas dinner. It looked pretty and Christmasy, but the taste was just okay. If I make it again, I'll add bacon as other posters have suggested. I'm surprised at all the rave reviews for this recipe; it just wasn't that exceptional.

Excellent, no complaints here. I didn't add 2 tbls of sugar, only 1/2 tbls and it turned out just a tad bit sweet.  I saved this recipe to my box! Enjoy!

These were delicious! When cooking for others, this will be my go-to green bean recipe. I made this for the first time several nights ago for my parents and husband. We all thoroughly enjoyed them, each of us making multiple comments on how good they were. These are the changes I made: (1): I used 2 pounds of beans, so that the four of us could each have a second helping. (2): I didn't measure the amount of basil I used. (3): I didn't measure the tomatoes - I just used an entire pkg of cherry tomatoes. Though I used more beans than the recipe called for, I didn't increase the amount of dressing and there was plenty to coat everything. This is a very easy and delicious recipe, with room to play with the amount of each ingredient if desired. Snapping the beans is the only part of this recipe that takes any real amount of time. Other than that it's quick to make. Please try - you will not be disappointed!

My whole family loved this recipe! It was colorful and delicious!  We used fresh basil from the garden and I replaced the butter with a good EVOO - tasted like a tuscan delight! I also replaced the garlic salt with freshly chopped garlic which I browned in the EVOO.

Delicious! The only modification I made, based on many reviews, was to decrease sugar from 1 Tbs to 1 tsp. Will definitely make this again and again.

I found this recipe several months ago and it is a staple.  I have basil and cherry tomatoes growing in the garden and I love being able to use what I have in the back yard. I have a foodsaver and this recipes is great for freezing too. I do experiment with the ingredients as I don't use as much sugar or butter but I have never made a batch that turned out bad.

This was good.. but I have to admit that I used dried Parsley instead of fresh basil.  I didn't have any basil, dried or fresh.  Next time I will try it with fresh basil and I bet it will be very very good!
Edit: I've made this three more times with Basil.  It is excellent.  My husband loves it!

Cook beans 7-8 minutes in microwave steamer.  Use 2 garlic cloves and salt.  Add green onions if you have them.  Use ¬º tsp. sugar.  Cook tomatoes quickly ( slightly soft) and add beans to the mixture until hot through.  Sprinkle cooked bacon on top.

The tomatoes were the star of this dish. The garlic-basil mix really compliments them. You may want to try to jazz up your beans, though. I found myself eating the tomatoes and merely tolerating the dull-by-comparison green beans.

This is a tasty recipe.  Try it by parboiling beans, sautee in olive oil with halved cherry tomatoes and spices.  I use garlic salt, salt, pepper.  Also used this recipe with Asparagus.  BonApetite, Carol

This is a great combination of flavors and it's really easy to prepare.  It also makes a great presentation, and there is enough sauce left in the pan to drizzle on plain pasta.  The first time I made it exactly as written, and the second time I omitted the sugar.  Grape tomatoes are so sweet the sugar wasn't necessary.

This did not appeal to most of our family (3 of 4 did not like it). Only the true green bean-lover finished his portion, the rest of us took one bite and stopped there.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!  My 4 and 1 year old gobbled it up like you wouldn't believe!  I would not change a thing.  And the best part is you can serve it with anything.  The first time I made it with garlic chicken and the second time with salmon lemon vinaigrette!  Simply delicious!!

It was Ok as written. Was great after some modifications: I sauteed half an onion and two cloves of garlic in stead of the garlic salt. Put the beans in the microwave for 5min then added to the onion+garlic. Added some thyme, soy sauce, the black pepper and cayenne pepper. Added the tomatoes and basil last and stirred until tomatoes was just soft.

This turned out great and everyone had second helpings.  I used grape tomatoes and left them whole.  The sauce was wonderful - the sweetness really brought out the other flavors.  I will definitely add this to my list of special veggie dishes.

The flavor in this was astounding! I only gave it four stars because it needs a little fewer tomatoes. They overpowered the green beans a bit. I will make this again with less tomatoes!

This is absolutely delicious!  My veggie-hating son liked them so much for dinner that he ran to the store the next day for more green beans & tomatoes and we had it again for lunch. I've also made it with dried basil as I was out of fresh and it was still wonderful. This is definitely a keeper!  I used Cherub tomatoes and cooked them a little more (than the picture shows) which makes a tomato butter sauce that's just great.  I would love this on pasta too.

Love this recipe and it got rave reviews from dinner guests. I have been looking for a simple yet tasty and pretty veggie dish that didn't require soup mix. I used frozen beans and steamed instead of boiling and I did skip the sugar although I might try it next time. I also look forward to trying variations like garlic, pine nuts or shallots etc..

I used olive oil and then only a fraction of the butter. I also used about half a teaspoon of sugar. I'm not sure why it needed the sugar in the first place. I would leave that out completely next time.
Otherwise, great dish!

Great! Didn't have fresh basil so used dried and added some dried dill as well. Used 1/2 TBS demerara sugar.

Simple and amazing!  I use grape tomatoes and it works great!  The first time I tried this I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried basil and it was still amazing!  It's a keeper!

I thought this was very good. I added minced garlic to it. I didn't have garlic salt so I just used garlic powder and salt. I think next time I will skip the sugar though. I also used grape tomatoes, as that was all I could get. I cooked the fresh green beans and then threw it in the frying pan with the other ingredients and tossed it a few minutes and then served.

Yummy!  I used less butter (and will probably use even less next time to cut down on calories and to see if it affects the taste) and didn't add the sugar.  My homegrown grape tomatoes are plenty sweet.

Oh so yummy! I did use 2 cloves of garlic and a chopped shallot in place of the garlic salt, and omitted the sugar. Even without the green beans, this treatment of tomatoes and basil is a versatile base! I could use it on pasta, chicken, pork...lovin' it!

I steamed the green beans for several minutes in the microwave, then cooked in the butter over low heat and removed from the pan.  I added the other ingredients as specified and mixed them as written.  This had a fresh, buttery taste and was a nice note of color on the place.

Minor changes. It seems like an awful lot of butter so I used half butter and half olive oil. I think next time I will use all olive oil....and probably a little less of it...to make a healthier version. It lso seemed a little too sweet for me/will probbly cut back the sugar as well....but overall very good and would make it again.

I would've never thought I'd like green beans and tomatoes.... I was wrong :)
I didn't have cherry tomatoes and basil on hand so I substituted w/ a regular (unsure of type) tomato and rosemary.  I also used garlic powder as opposed to garlic salt and sauteed onions two minutes before adding the tomato.  This is WONDERFUL!  I can't wait to make this with the ingredients recommended.  Afterall... I have a ton of green beans just waiting to be sprung from my garden :)  Thanks so much!

I made this an it looked like a professional chef had prepared this dish.. The tomatoes ad such color to the dish. I also used fresh diced garlic in the sauce w/ the butter.. I also cooked in the greenbean after cooking the tomatoes for 1 minute. This was a good new to serve green beans. I also did not put the sugar in it, didn't want sweet vegetables.

these were really good. i cooked them just until tender, and used only a pinch of sugar, and a little more spices. instead of just pouring the mixture over the green beans, i added the beans into the skillet and tossed, and covered them for a bit to let the juices cook in

Delish! I served this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it! Like other reviewers, I used less sugar- 1/2-3/4 TBS Splenda and it was sweet enough. Also, I recommend letting it set for a while, to let the flavors mix- yummmm.

A keeper in our family! Always looking for creative ways with green beans cause we eat them so much.
This was a hit! Did use real garlic and about 2 1/2 tspns of fresh basil - but that is just preference.

Perfect answer to a side dish, we always have green beans and this was a great diversion to a gourmet side that accompanied our meatloaf perfectly! Will definitely keep this in my rotation and share with my family. btw...used the recipe as a base and did not use as much sugar (almost 1 tsp, frozen cut green beans & fresh minced garlic using my Pampered Chef garlic press) - YUMMY!

I thought they were good but other people in my family did not care for the tomatoes in the green beans and thought they were slightly sweet.

Excellent and enjoyed by us and our company. We did reduce the sugar to 1/2 the amount as we don't like things too sweet, and to keep the calorie count low. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made this tonight on the spare of the moment because the green beans looked so wonderful today at market. I'm so glad I saw the beans because this recipe is awesome. I would not change a thing. I made it for two and all the portions were right on the money. Very nice change to simply blanching the beans. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe.  Used chicken broth instead of water to steam beans and used fresh garlic, no salt. Otherwise made per recipe.  Will make again and again.

Very good and easy.  I used fresh green beans and boiled them in chicken stock for 10-15 minutes.  Drained and put beans in a serving bowl.  In same saucepan I melted butter, stirred in sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and chopped fresh tomatoes.  A minute or two later I put the green beans back in the pan and stirred everything together for another minute.  Put all in the serving bowl.

Thank you for this wonderful green bean dish for my family!!  It is delicious and got rave reviews! I used dried basil (though fresh is best), and took other reviewers' advice and added shredded Parmesan cheese.  Next time I will use a bit less butter since I had a lot left at the bottom of the bowl.  Will definitely make again and again!

Excellent side dish - infact one of the better side recipes posted on AR!  Would make again but probably go easier on the butter.  Found it a tad greasy.  Also used grape tomatoes instead of cherry toms only because they are in season and they taste so much better.

A delicious veggie side dish! I omitted the sugar, cut the butter a little, and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Overall it was a nice fresh tasting mix of flavors.

Everyone in my family hates green beans, except for me.  When you are the only lover of a particular vegetable in your family, you get to eat a LOT of that vegetable when you prepare it.  This recipe changed some minds.  I followed it exactly, and the fight for green beans is on!

These are ok.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I then added 1/4 tsp salt.  I used 1 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. dried basil.  This is a colorful dish, but I'm not sure I will make it again.

Ok, so I skipped the sugar.  I didn't really measure anything, either, so my proportions could have been a little off.  No fresh basil, so I used dried.  Think I used quite a bit more seasoning than was called for, actually. But, these were THE BEST GREEN BEANS EVER.  I made them for Easter dinner, along with a few other new recipes, and I assumed the from-scratch potatoes au gratin would be the winner, but I was wrong.  These green beans were the hit of the meal with EVERYONE.  My brother-in-law, who would willingly go his whole life without eating another vegetable, took a small spoonful of these to be polite.  A few minutes into dinner, he tasted the beans and started raving.  "If all vegetables tasted like this, I would eat them every night," and, "If you're ever coming over and want to know if you need to bring anything, I'll tell you to bring green beans."   Really, make these.  They're fabulous.

My husband who never eats vegetables had 2 helpings of this tonight.   I made it with the sugar, and he still ate it - it really doesn't make the recipe too sweet.  Used dry basil instead (half the amount, since dry is stronger that fresh) by the way.  My husband remarked that not only did it taste good, but it looked "happy", and that I should make it again.  Thanks to whoever submitted this!  I served it with lamb chops (broiled with crushed garlic on top) and bread.  It made a nice light addition to the meal.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I cooked the tomatoes a little too long - as the skins were starting to peel off. So, I'll watch that next time. But the flavor of this dish was fabulous. It's one  I'll make again and again when I have fresh green beans on hand.

I make this veggie side dish with almost every meal I make! My husband and I LOVE it! It is so flavorful, as well as healthy! I use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Lite" instead of real butter and it turns out awesome! Love this side dish!!

Wow!! This recipe is great!! I used fresh garlic instead garlic powder. And added a pinch more basil. I watched to make sure the tomatoes didn't overcook. Next time I will cook the beans a little longer only because I prefer them a little softer. But I was impressed...got my little ones to eat them. :)

I love this side dish- easy to make, flavorful, and pretty to look at. I made it for xmas dinner but it really is a summery salad.

the inner seeds and fles of the tomatoes all came out while cooking so there was a lot of excess mush.  I would recommend squeezing the tomatoes over the sink after cutting them to remove some of the mush (or you could seed them completely if you have time).

I thought this was very good.  I did not add salt and pepper, and used olive oil and real garlic. My daughter tried it with feta cheese, which was great, too!

This was just okay.  I think the tomatoes made things too runny, so you could barely taste the seasoning in the sauce.  I think the concept is good, but next time I would "de-pulp" the tomatoes first and see if that improved things.

Oh how I love green beans and tomatoes in the summer! This was a new way to try them together and I could have eaten all of it. The fresh basil is a must, and it doesn't hurt to add a little more than what's called for. Also, I used small amount of olive oil instead of the butter to be a little nicer to my heart.

I probably would have given this recipe 4 stars, but I left out one (probably important) ingredient.  I didn't have any basil, but besides that (and using grape tomatoes instead of cherry) I followed the recipe.  I would make these again but I would leave out the sugar.  Way too sweet.  But it was a wonderful side dish.  Very tasty, and if you cut back on the butter, a healthy and tasty way to eat your veggies!

Wow!!! First time made made exactly except used a mix of grape & cherry tomatoes (from the garden) and fresh basil and fresh chopped garlic..almost ate the whole pan!  Today made again but used 2 cups fresh green beans, 1 1/2 cup tomatoes mixed again,3 teas "I cant believe butter spray", 2 teas sugar and again fresh everything. Almost as good and ate the whole pan again!  But this time I think I got less calories! Num, Num!!!

I used frozen green beans and fresh garlic and this recipe was wonderful.I loved the tomato and basil flavors. If you use fresh garlic you will have to add some salt though. This is a recipe I will use often. Thanks!

This recipe was perfect for my summer vegetable garden.  The combination of the beans and basil was very refreshing, and the tomatoes added the right amount of sweetness along with the sugar.  Will keep this recipe handy to make many times over.

I was delighted to find a recipe using the abundance of cherry tomatoes and green beans from my garden.  My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I didn't make any changes at all.  Thanks so much for submitting it!

These are so awesome!  I was amazed.  Who'd have thunk that that little tablespoon of sugar would make all the difference.  My fresh basil had pooped out before I could make this recipe and I had to resort to dried, but I thought this was still awesome!  This will definitely be a staple in our house because it's quick and very good.

These are amazing.  I used frozen green beans instead of fresh and just heated them in the microwave before putting the tomatoes on top.   I only used a tsp of sugar instead of a T because it seemed like plenty.  I highly recommend this one.

Flavorful and it seems the beans and tomatoes make a nice combo.  Next time to punch it up a bit I plan to use a Citrus Grill Seasoning,  add some garlic and leave out the sugar.  The sugar was the only slightly 'off' taste to this dish or at least to our taste buds.  Thanks to Starnetsa for a great recipe that taste good and is also a nice presentation!

Great recipe for our bumper crop of cherry tomatoes.  Followed the recipe as submitted - small substitution of using one garlic clove for the garlic salt.  Many thanks for a much needed twist for these crazy cherry tomatoes!

This was a nice change for green beans. I did not add the sugar and used minced garlic for the garlic salt because I did not have any. I also tossed in thin slices of red onion, that were extras from a salad, with the garlic, tomatoes and fresh basil. We both enjoyed this and will make again.  Thank you. * I added about a T of red pepper flakes for a kick because the man likes it hot!

I love green beans and was looking for a yummy green bean side recipe and boy did I find it!

I followed pretty much as written, using granulated garlic and dried basil, just altering the amounts a tad as I was winging it and didn't feel like actually busting out the measuring spoons. I made it with frozen green beans as I didn't have fresh. Microwaved them a few minutes to heat up while the pan was cooking the seasonings and tomatoes in butter. Added together, mixed a few times for a few minutes, done! Delicious! I had to fight myself not to eat the whole pan. Excited for lunch tomorrow! I will be making this often.

So easy to make it. And so nutritious except for the sugar part which I substituted with honey. Stevia is another option which I will try next time. I also used 2 cloves of garlic and sea salt in lieu of garlic salt.

So fast and so good. I make it often in the summer. I prepare the ingredients and pop it all in the pan right when the food is coming off the grill. EVERYONE loves it. I also make this as a side dish to my favorite Greek chicken from the site called Feta and Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffed Chicken. They go together so well and look so pretty together. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving instead of the green bean casserole and everyone LOVED it!   I put a little balsamic vinegar in it and sprinkled a little parmesan on top.  Next time I think I'll add a few pieces of bacon on top for some crunch.

This was delicious and scrumptious as a side dish. Since I didn't have a steamer basket, I just steamed it in a pot with hot water.  I've used salad tomatoes for my cherry tomatoes and unsalted butter instead of salted. I followed the directions from the magazine to a T.  I would make it again.

I love green beans but always ends up with just plain ol' green beans.  I had never cooked GB with a sugar but this adds a slight sweetness and 10 mins cooking time was not too long than I was afraid and this dish has been my favourite GB side dish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

LOVED IT as it is written!
I would give the recipe 5 stars if it had the following modifications I recently made:
-several cloves of fresh garlic, chopped in place of garlic salt
-salt
I also fried the beans for 10 mins, using the same pan to cook the rest of the ingredients...this does not make much difference except to use less dishes.

The only change I made was adding sweet onions half-way through the saute. Easily the best green beans I've ever eaten. I also used organic cherry tomatoes. 
Super simple side dish that I'll be keeping as a staple in my diet rotation.

I love to make this as a side dish with white fish like cod, and either herbed rice or mashed potatoes. The sauce from the tomatoes mixes with everything and is outstanding. Even my non-veggie eating little boys will eat this and ask for more!

I enjoyed this dish very much. It was a nice change and it had a nice presentation. The only changes I made was that I used fresh garlic and only 1 tsp of sugar. Otherwise everything else was the same. Definitely a keeper!

I made these for Easter dinner 2018, and the only change I made was to use fresh/frozen basil from my last years crop. These were very tasty, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

Made this for 8 people and everyone really liked it.   I didn't add the sugar, and no one missed it. It will definitely be on my green bean list.

I always hate when people give a rating and then say the whole bunch of things that they changed, completely ignoring the original posters recipe.  So, I apologize.  I had some left over whole canned tomatoes and green beans and this recipe was the foundation for what I did, so I know the original recipe is awesome.  I just thought I would let people know what I had done. And I had way less green beans, so I eyeballed all the ingredients. Hubby was like, super delish!   
Like some other reco's, sauteed a shallot, in butter, added roasted garlic, added basil, then I took the whole canned Roma tomatoes and mashed them and just put the mash in with a bit of the liquid.  No sugar. Too each their own on that one.... I reduced it.  Added the green beans.  I then gave the family the option to add fresh ground parm.  I rarely add salt, I let people do it.  They added salt to their taste.  Thank you again to the original recipe provider.  I wouldn't have got there without your submission.

Awesome. A quick easy to make side that tastes good. Made the green beans  in a pot one time and a kitchen ninja the other while making the sauce in a pan. A low maintenance recipe you can set down while cooking two other things. Served it to guests the second time I made it, and a green bean hater loved it. Will continue to make. 4 stars because I feel like it is missing something to make the flavor trul y robust. Will continue to experiment.

We served this to 100 diners at our Sr Ctr this week and got rave reviews from everyone. We varied only slightly from the recipe - because we were cooking for so many, we baked the cherry tomatoes whole for half an hour, then mixed them with the beans.  And we added Parmesan cheese just before serving. Oh, and we left the beans whole.  This was a really pretty side dish for a Christmas dinner.

The sauce is very flavorful, but doesn't stay on the green beans very well.  Just used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and less butter.

I love it. I added onion and rest of chicken from my dinner. I tried to add bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Both worked nicely. Will make it again, indeed.

This was superb! Simple every day ingredients combine to create a flavor explosion in your mouth. The small amount of sugar really makes the tomate flavor pop. Yum, yum, yum! I'm making it again tonight. Thank you for your recipe!

This is an interesting recipe.  Hubby loved it.  Following other reviews, I cut the amount of sugar to 1 tsp which worked fine adding just a hint of sweetness.  I used fresh garlic in place of garlic salt.  The 10 minutes to cook the beans is a bit much if you like  your veggies on the crunchier side.  5 minutes is plenty.   Used cherry tomatoes and fresh basil from the garden which added delicious freshness.  There is room for improvement (mushrooms, onions, etc.) but the recipe as is yields some tasty green beans.

I substituted a 1/2 TB of 100% pure maple syrup for the processed sugar. The kids were surprised by the sweetness and enjoyed the side dish.

These were fantastic!  I'm not normally a green bean fan, but I was making kind of a theme dinner that included green beans, so I tried this out.  Instead of garlic salt, I added salt and actual garlic (3 cloves).  I also probably used more basil (our plant is getting out of control so I put in a lot).  They were definitely a hit and I even got seconds despite not really caring for green beans normally!

Delicious. I read a few reviews and reduced the sugar to 1 tsp., and also used 1 clove crushed garlic, rather than the garlic salt. This just subtly enhances the sweetness of the tomatoes without the dish tasting sweet.

This turned out Delicious!  I used canned beans (drained) and a can of drained diced tomatoes and it was really delicious!  If using canned, make sure you drain them well.

This is a fool-proof recipe that is so obvious- but I would not have made it as well on my own (don't the best ideas always seem obvious after the fact?).   We make this regularly and it is always a crowdpleaser.

To save time and avoid throwing away a bunch of cherry tomatoes we used diced (basil, garlic, oregano) tomatoes from a can and it works well.

This is a nice way to serve green beans. Everyone ate their servings before any other part of the meal. The grape tomatoes I used ended up making a kind of flavorful sauce on the beans and it looked great on the plate.

Delicious addition to plain green beans! I must confess though I omitted the sugar entirely and added some grated Parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs. Easy and excellent!

Excellent side dish that is as simple or complex as you want it to be. I added no salt or seasonings to this- made ribs in the crockpot with a beef broth brine and that did the trick! Store had no cherry tomatoes they only had grape tomatoes and those worked just fine! They bring out the savory flavors in your fresh green beans. Great combo!

I added almost a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar when I took the tomatoes off the heat and it was delicious! My husband also really loved it.

This is a very simple recipe that is  wonderful. It was great on asparagas and I also used it on chicken. I added a bit more fresh basil but otherwise I followed the recipe.  And i just realized I forgot the sugas when I made it the second time. It wasn't missed as the tomatoes were so sweet.

I agree that the sugar is too much. I sliced up fresh garlic and cut the garlic salt in half, very satisfying with pork chops!

I didn't read the reviews until after I had mixed the ingredients,  but only started with 2-3 teaspoons of  sugar,  which was plenty sweet. This dish was delicious and a lighter way to fix yummy green beans.

This was very tasty!  I have never added sugar to green beans, but, the sweetness worked perfectly with the acidic tomatoes.  I did reduce the amount of butter slightly.  I also used a sprinkle of dried basil because I didn't realize I was out of fresh basil.  I am sure it would be even better with the fresh basil.

Good way to change up green beans. Sugar is unnecessary. I increased the amount of butter (real, wholesome butter...not the fake cancer causing stuff).  Used fresh garlic in lieu of garlic salt.

This was really good.  Since we were only two at dinner, I cut the recipe back to about a third.  And only cooked the green beans about 5 minutes since I like them with a little bite to them. The sauce was delicious with them. will definitely make again. Am also considering doing this with asparagus.

This is a good recipe for green beans, the tomato gets sweet  & contrasts with the  green beans. Use fresh beans if you can get them & do not over cook. I added a little herb de Provence  & sugar to the tomatoes & used an ice bath to preserve the color while I made the tomato sauce.

delicious. Used one clove fresh garlic and a dash or two of sea salt instead of the garlic salt. I might try substituting olive oil for the butter next time for a bit of a healhtier alternative but as is this was a delicious side to my Eastet dinner. Everyone loved it. Thanks!

Yum. These beans rock.  Easy to make and so fresh. I did use fresh garlic and added a few slices shallots. Either way the flavor of the tomatoes and basil is a nice compliment.

Used olive oil instead of butter, still came out amazing! Will definitely make again, as I have a ton of tomatoes and green beans in the garden

Great recipe! I put the tomatoes in right at the end so they don't cook at much and still have bite.

Loved it - as did my guests!  Easy to make and not only tasty but also beautiful presentation.  I will cut the sugar in half or even 2/3 next time but i do think a little bit makes for an interesting flavor add.  I also used grape tomatoes because I love their flavor.

It was a good change to just regular green beans. I agree with the other reviewers, the sugar was too much. Next time I might just add a pinch or omit it completely. Also, I think 10 min was too long for the green beans. Next time, I'll bring the water to a boil and cut the cook time to 5 min to give it that nice crunchy texture. I'll probably try it with shallots next time too.

Green Beans w/ Cherry Tomatoes Haiku: "Used grape tomatoes, and microwaved the green beans. Did the rest the same." Seriously delicious beans, a bit on the sweet side, so I'd reduce the sugar a touch next time, but the basil, butter ... everything! YUM!

I whipped these up real quick (like 10 min.) so that I had a veggie with my meal.  I just used what I had around the house, which included:  1lb bag of frozen steam-in bag whole green beans (used less butter to compensate), 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes with onion/garlic, garlic powder (can never have too much!), regular salt, dried basil, pepper, and lessened it to a dash of sugar.  Not quite as pretty and I don't know what the original is supposed to taste like, but my quick and dirty version tasted and smelled really good!  My husband professes to hate green beans, though I think all he's had is canned ones.  I will definitely try these with him!  Thanks for saving my meal!

Quick - Easy - Excellent as per recipe.  I did grind some Parmesan cheese over the dish just before serving.  Did more for looks than taste, but nice touch.

I rated this four stars because I think it calls for too much butter. I used about 1 tablespoon and it was perfect. I also substituted the garlic salt for garlic powder and a little sea salt. I put the green beans right into the pan and mixed them together with the heat off.

Because this is what I had in my cabinet, I used a drained can of whole green beans, Kroger brand basil leaves, splenda, and added a little white wine. Let the green beans cooked a little while in the juice and seasoning before adding tomatoes, then cooked a little longer. YUMMY!

I used grape tomatoes and added some feta crumbles on the individual servings to give a bit more layer to the flavor. Also, I reversed the mix process. Instead of pouring the tomato mix over the green beans, I put the drained beans in the skillet with the tomatoes for a few minutes to get them coated. I sauted them together for another 3 or so minutes. Since I was careful not to overboil, the beans maintained the texture we like- somewhat al dente without being "crisp."

I made this for Thanksgiving last year in protest of the ubiquitous green bean casserole that the processed onion people try to sell you on in their grocery store displays.  In contrast, this was fresh, whole, healthy, delicious and a huge hit.  I used half the butter and skipped the sugar. It was great.   I'm making it again this year!

It could have been   I overcooked these, but I found this recipe very bland and vegetables were soggy.

I had just picked a bunch of green beans from the garden and was looking for a recipe that combined both beans and cherry tomatoes.  This was perfect!  My daughter even commented on how good the vegetables tasted!  Anytime I can get a compliment like that, then the recipe deserves to be rated high!  I used fresh garlic and added a few grape tomatoes since I didn't have enough cherry tomatoes.  It was all terrific and will make it again!

I omitted the sugar, used olive oil instead of butter and fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt. Also, 1/2 tsp of dried basil since I didn't have fresh. Good recipe & I think I will even use it for just green beans.

Quick and easy and a nice change from the usual green bean recipes!   I used just-picked green beans, reduced sugar to 1 tsp, didn't have garlic salt, so used 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and replaced fresh basil with 1 tsp dried basil.  We love this recipe!

We made this with the Barbecued Flank Steak recipe and it was perfect. I used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt but that was the only change.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used garlic & salt instead of garlic salt. So delicious. Next time I'd like to try honey in place of the sugar. My teenager - who hates veggies - ate 2 helpings.

These green beans were perfect! Unfortunately, although my husband liked it, he is not a fan of green beans. This means I will not eat this dish often but if it were for me: I would eat it more often than not! It is just excellent as it is. By the way, I used one clove of garlic since I like garlic a lot. I thought that the sugar would make it way too sweet as I do not add sugar to salty dishes and it turned out perfectly fine. I however, next time will not add the sugar.

love the basics of this!  Too much butter for me though and made the green beans crunchy instead of mushy.  Also used grape tomatoes and trimmed up green beans.

This was ok.  I would make it again watching the cook time more closely.  I didn't have grape or cherry tomatoes so I used slicing tomatoes, I would not use them again but I would try it with the recommended type of tomato.

Loved it, something different. I used Janes mixed up salt, garlic powder and minced fresh garlic to the butter instead of the garlic salt and omitted the basil (I didn't have any on hand).  I also never added the tomatoes to the heat and they softened perfectly with the heat from the green beans and butter sauce.  I bet this would work well with asparagus as well. We will make again, thank you!

Quick, easy, & delicious. I didn't have garlic salt so I used both garlic & salt. Ate it over mashed potatoes- great combo. My boyfriend, who usually adds seasoning and/or hot sauce to everything I cook, said "This is SO good! And it's good just like this. I don't even need to add anything to it." Major compliment.

This recipe makes for a delicious and fresh side. I added 2tbsp of shallots a little garlic and some onion (using things before they go bad) with mushrooms, all fresh, and the beans turned out perfect. 5 stars!

This made a fabulous side dish for a Christmas dinner for 16 people. I didn't measure the beans and tomatoes but made lots! I used two crushed garlic, saut√©ed with about 1/3 cup basil leaves, then tossed together at last minute, as the recipe states, just enough cooking to soften the tomatoes. Garlic and basil made the taste interesting but didn't interfere with the wonderful natural taste of the beans and tomatoes.

Cooked this along with some chicken breasts for dinner the other night and it was amazing. I followed some of the other reviews and waited to add the tomato until the end, and I also tossed in some grated parmesan for texture. Wow. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make again!

I took the advice of others and halved the amount of sugar and butter.  I also added some salt and pepper.  Very good, and very easy to make.

Quite delicious, & even my veggie-phobic son & mother-in-law loved these green beans!  Subbed 2 pounds green beans & omitted tomatoes because I didn't have any.   Omitted sugar and added a little balsamic vinegar & Parmesan cheese.  These were awesome with mashed potatoes & grilled fish. I have NEVER seen my son voluntarily go back for seconds on any vegetable (especially bypassing mashed potatoes), but he went back for thirds on this ( he couldn't get enough!).   That's a home-run in my book...THANK YOU Starnetsa for opening my son's eyes to the wonderful, crunchy, delicious flavor of fresh vegetables!!!

I made this this weekend for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  It was super easy and looked and tasted wonderful.  The only thing I changed was used grape tomatoes instead of cherry.

Good. Ordinarily I wouldn't add sugar to any vegetable dish. So this recipe took me out of my usual taste set.  The combination of sugar garlic and basil work together and I liked that it was different.  It paired well with pork loin.

So easy to do! Looking through the reviews I can understand why people would reduce or omit the sugar. Currently it is winter in Michigan do I do not have access to those wonderfully sweet grape tomatoes so I left the sugar in and was glad for that choice. This summer I will omit the sugar. Thanks for a great recipe!

These came out really good. Was a nice change of pace. I added some Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese as someone suggested. Next time I'd like to experiment and see what I can use instead of butter.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! The 2 changes that I made were I used frozen green beans that you steam in the bag (in the microwave), and I only used 1 Tbsp. margarine instead of the 1/4 c. of butter. I also left out the sugar after reading some of the other reviews. Super easy, tasted amazing, and the leftovers the next day were even better!

Great low cal dish. I cooked the tomatoes until they were stewed and it made a wonderful sauce. This will be a regular recipe for me.

Absolutely delicious! I've never had green beans so full of flavor. The sweetness is a nice change from traditional bean flavorings. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, so I subbed canned diced tomatoes, and it was still delicious (and a bit quicker to prepare!). Great recipe that is definitely a keeper!

Very good. Easy to make at the last minute. Everyone really liked it. I stirred the tomatoes in at the last minute so they stayed plump. I also used the fresh basil in the tube as I sometimes don't use up all the fresh I buy and it goes to waste. I will make this again in the summer when I have fresh basil growing.

I hardly ever comment on recipes, but this one was worth commenting on - SO YUMMY!  My 4 year old at the start of the meal said she did not like green beans and wouldn't eat hers.  To be excused, she had to eat 4.  She ate one, looked at me with big eyes and exclaimed, "These are good!  I'm going to eat all of them!"  And she did.  I followed the exact recipe, btw - you should too because it's EXCELLENT AS IS!

Our family loved this recipe! I'm not much of a green bean and tomato person but I even enjoyed it. I am now making this dish every week. I did take the advice to skip the sugar as well. It's sweet enough without it.

One of the best and simple vegetable side dishes I've had!  Added a little white wine to cooking water, also I didn't have fresh basil so used dried - still great and would be better from fresh.  I used grape tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.

I loved this recipe. I love fresh green beans, but I was tired of serving my green beans the same way I always have. This was easy to prepare and really delicious. The sugar in the recipe perfectly brings out the sweetness from the tomatoes. Tres magnifique!

Good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little too sweet for me, so next time I would half the sugar. Also, I would add more basil since i like more of a basil flavor.  Other than that, it was a pretty good recipe and i will make it again with my own adjustments.

I liked this side dish but didn't love it.  I felt the basil flavor was a little overpowering, but that is just a personal preference.  It was a nice change, though and a great way to use some grape tomatoes that needed a home.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, STARNETSA!

I had dinner guests last evening and actually tried 3 new recipes from allrecipes.com! All were a hit. This green bean recipe was a fantastic. I followed the recipe as written with one exception. The grocery store was out of fresh green beans. I purchased a "family size" bag of frozen greens and used those in place of the fresh. I believe it was a 20 oz bag. All of the adults really liked this dish. This is a keeper. The tomatoes really make this dish unique.

Best green beans ever! I added a chopped clove of garlic to the butter, and  heated the beans in the pan with the seasoned butter so they would absorb the taste.  Just before serving, since I didn't have cherry tomatoes, I quickly stirred in a cut up tomato, seeds removed, just until the tomato was slightly heated.

Very good recipe.  The only change I made was to throw the green beans in the pan and saute them for a bit before adding the tomatoes.

This recipe is relative easy and tasty!  My favorite green bean recipe so far.  I used sungold cherry tomatoes fress from the garden and replaced the garlic salt with 1 tsp fresh garlic + 1/2 tsp salt.    I brough the water to a boil before adding the green beans then boiled for 3 minutes.  After boiling I ran the beans under cool water to stop the cooking process.  The beans were bright green and tender but still had a slight crunch.

I make this all the time with fresh produce from the farmers market. The original recipe was a little sweet and buttery for my taste so I cut back on those two things. I make it from memory now and use fresh basil from the garden if it's growing. FABULOUS side dish. Thank you!

Just OK. Seems like it could use something, maybe some lemon would give it some additional zip.

So delicious!  Made them minus the sugar twice and they are so tasty and surprisingly sweet. Just beware and make sure you time your cooking appropriately so your beans don't get soggy.

We loved this!  I did think the sugar was completely unnecessary so I left it out and everything tasted great.  My only complaint is that it was too buttery.  Next time I will reduce the butter by 1-2 Tbsp.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used dry basil, as I did not have fresh. We liked it, but was vastly improved with a drizzle of reduced balsamic.

This is delicious!  I will definitely make it again soon.  I used patio tomatoes from our garden instead of cherry tomatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  We both had second helpings of this.

These green beans were so good.  I used fresh green beans from a friends garden and fresh basil from my garden. I also added a splash of white wine before I added the tomatoes. This is a great recipe!

As many others did, I didn't include the sugar and used fresh garlic. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Absolutely delicious!! Look forward to making it again next week when I get more green beans from my farm box.

Yummy! For those who are counting calories, I used only 1 -2 TBSP of butter, and that worked just fine -Lightly coated the beans and tomatoes. I am sure it would have been delicious with the full amount as well - what's not better with butter??
I used the thin haricot verts from Costco - steamed very briefly then quickly tossed with the rest of the ingredients.

Amazing, love, love.  I had fresh baby green beans and this was the perfect recipe to use them with. The flavor of the tomatoes were wonderful with the savory sweet butter sauce.  I am not a person who likes things very sweet so I did only use half the sugar and we love garlic so I did add a little extra garlic salt. Will make again.

Wonderful way to use fresh vegetables from your garden or from the local market.  I used all fresh ingredients and it was wonderful.  As my husband is diabetic I too skipped the sugar and it was just wonderful.  This is definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times since I first saw this recipe! It is a family favorite now. I did make a few changes- I omitted the sugar, I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry(less watery), and I used minced garlic. Thank you for a recipe that I will likely use for years to come in our family!

Made these green beans last night and my husband and daughter (who fights us on eating her veggies) loved them!  The even sugguested that I keep making these.  I did everything the recipe stated except add the tomatoes because I didn't have any.  And they still came out great!  I could only imagine how they would tast with the tomatoes...yum!  This recipe was also very quick and easy, which is always a plus!  Although, I'm not sure how healthy these veggies are after adding sugar and butter.....but sugar and butter make it taste really good.  Maybe I can add a lil less next time...we'll see =)

LOVED LOVED LOVED IT! Beautiful on the plate and a welcome change to plain ol green beans. Used halved grape tomatoes due to the fact that they have less water. Just a superbly tasty side. The sugar makes it all come together. Thank you!

Yea this is pretty stellar. Never been a huge fan of tomatoes, except in pastas, but this was wonderful! Used parsley instead of basil and used less sugar!  Oh, and I added some orange sweet peppers for a splash of color!

This is my go to veggie recipes.  I love it.  I did not use the sugar; you don't need it.  I used grape tomatoes.  After I cooked the tomatoes, I turned off the burner and mixed I tossed in the green beans in the saute pan for a nice coating of the mixture.  Super easy and fast!

Loved this recipe. I used frozen green beans instead of fresh because I had them in the house. I also added 2 Tbsp of bacon bits and it was wonderful.

We didn't care for the flavor of this dish. If I were to make it again I would omit the sugar and halve the butter, or simply toss the green beans and tomatoes in a tablespoon or two of a favorite non-creamy salad dressing like italianor a viniagrette.

Nice way to perk up plain ole green beans.  I steamed the beans and decreased the sugar a bit to make them healthier.  4 stars only because of the amount of sugar suggested.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got great reviews from my family.  After reading all the reviews, I cut the butter down to 1/8 cup (and frankly it could have been cut down  even more).  I did not add sugar, but did use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also, I added the cooked beans to the skillet with the butter, tossed to coat and then turned off the heat.  Then I added the grape tomatoes.  Delish!!!

I made this two nights ago and it came out pretty good. I altered a little bit based off of suggestions and my own perference. I just did a pinch of sugar and I substituted the garlic salt with minched garlic. Next time I will make a smaller portion since I am just cooking for myself. I currently have plenty of leftovers lol

Great recipe.  I did 4 instead of 5 stars because I don't think adding sugar to veggies is necessarily a great idea, but without the sugar it's a 5 star side dish, even for my green-bean-phobic husband!

Made this with a few tweaks: no sugar, subbed olive oil for butter (and used less), added sauteed shallots and garlic.  Delicious!

This is a great to recipe for a green side.  I always have whole frozen green beans on hand. I made as is no substitutions and the whole family loved it.  Even my finicky 12-year old son who doesn't like tomatoes, ate these tomatoes.  There was enough butter sauce left over that I used it to pan fry my asparagus the next day.  I loved the hint of tomato flavor for the asparagus. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing --

10-19-11: I thought the sauce was a little heavy.  Ann thought better of it, apparently.
3-25-12:  This time did it with 1/2 the butter and it was better.

When I first read this recipe, I was hesitant to give it a try.  At first it seemed strange to me for some reason, but I am so glad I made it!  This dish is delicious!!  
Simple changes were adding some garlic & onion that I had already cooked, thinking I was going to make another green bean dish.  Also cut down on the butter and sugar to make it a bit healthier.  Used fresh chopped tomatoes, as I did not have cherry tomatoes on hand.  I also made the sauce and then tossed the cooked beans in at the end to warm everything.  Great dish, awesome flavor, and very easy to make!  Thanks for sharing :)

I did as other reviewers suggested and omitted the sugar and garlic salt then added in fresh garlic. This was so good. The tomatoes added just the right amount of sweetness to the green beans to make them different from the norm.

I love this recipe because it is so easy and delicious.  I use a bag of frozen beans instead of fresh which I cook in minutes in the microwave.  Everything else I do just as the recipe says.
I first made it at Christmas because I wanted a red and green veggie.  Now that tomatoes are in season I have made it several times and could eat the whole recipe by myself, I like it so much.

Made this substituting olive oil for the butter and omitting the sugar. It was fabulous. I did sprinkle some parmesan  cheese over all before serving. It was fantastic!

I give this recipe 5 starts but myself only 3.5 :-).  Recipe is awesome, but i made the mistake of cooking my grean beans a bit too long and they didn't have the crunch I like. Still, the tomatoe mixture was YUMMY!  covered up the overcooked beans. Honestly, i would eat the tomato mixture all by itself.  It wasn't too sweet and the fresh basil really set it off.  Will definitely be making again.

I made this for Easter and followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  I don't think I've ever hosted a party where there weren't a TON of leftover veggie side dishes.  This is definitely a keeper.

Made this dish for Easter dinner and it was more  popular than my Ham.  Everyone raved about it, all noting the basil and garlic taste!  I confess I did tweak this recipe slightly..  My tweaking was using garlic butter I'd made when butter was on sale..  adding sliced white parts of the green onions I had left from the salad to the butter, used grape tomatoes, and left out the sugar as my ham glaze was pretty sweet.  I did not find the sauce to be runny as some had experienced.  As I love fresh basil I increased the amt to about 1 tbsp.

I liked it best with double the quanity of nuts and much more seasoning.  As listed it seemed rather bland.  I continue to "play" with the recipe since this is green bean season in Wisconsin.  Do enjoy this dish.

Excellent!  Have cherry tomatoes and basil in the garden so just had to pick up some fresh green beans at the farmers market.  Made this as a side but it certainly was the star of the meal.

Really good way to use some tomatoes from the garden.  I cut the butter and sugar in half and will cut back even further next time I make this side dish.

I tried this recipe and it was great!  I used frozen beans and substituted marjoram for the basil because I had none.  They still turned out great and I'm planning on making them for Easter.

Used dried basil, 1 regular tomato, fresh garlic and a dash of salt.  Next time I'd cut down the sugar just a bit and maybe add another dash of salt. But, this was GREAT and the kids loved it.

This is a very tasty and beautiful dish. Like other reviewers, I prefer to skip the sugar and use grape tomatoes. It is also good with two or three tablespoons of olive oil in place of the butter.

Omitted the sugar (personal taste) and really really enjoyed these! Using fresh basil is a MUST! I used marg b/c that's what I had, but I bet real butter would make it even better. Great and easy side that looks great on the table.

I thought this is a refreshing change from plain green beans.  It is really a colorful dish and a great side for a nice dinner.  I did omit the sugar, and reduced the butter in half. Yummy!

I usually make green beans my own way- not using a recipe. In honor of Thanksgiving I decided to give this a try instead. It wasn't terrible but it didn't amaze me either. Not a bad basic recipe but I won't be making it again.

Really delicious and easy - this one is definitely going to be a regular at our table.  I altered the recipe a little - using less butter and leaving out the sugar and garlic salt entirely.  I added chopped mushrooms and a tsp and a half of garlic instead.

I was disappointed in how this turned out.  I did not like the sweetness.  I think I prefer a savory taste to my green beans.

I thought this was a great summer side dish. The only changes I made was to add fresh garlic and some Parmesan cheese at the end. I had this with Caramelized Baked chicken and thought they went well together. Great Healthy summer meal!!!

This is a nice spin on traditional green beans. I did omit the sugar and reduced the amount of butter used to keep it a bit healthier. I also used fresh minced garlic to help bring out the flavors of the veggies. Fantastic and quick. Will make again.

Decadent, and so easy.  Perhaps the tastiest green beans I've had.  I used grape tomatoes.  And I left out the sugar, but it was not missed at all. The fresh basil is definitely a key ingredient and gave the dish perfect flavor.

This was a big hit at my dinner party.  I doubled the green beans and tomatoes (dinner for 11) but I left the other ingredients alone-- to keep it a little lighter.  I loved it, and I got tons of compliments.  So easy!

Used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, but otherwise followed.  Loved this!  Next time I will use even more tomatoes.

Very good and flavorful. I made these as a new way to have the traditional green beans at Thanksgiving.  My mother-in-law claimed all the leftovers for herself!

I thought this recipe was boring. Maybe because I didn't saute the garlic (I used fresh) long enough in the butter...? I thought the taste was bland. Not sure if I'll give it another try.

These are great! I usually make with canned grean beans to save time. Just cook the beans in a pan with everything but the tomatoes. Add the tomatoes during the last minute or so of cooking time. Drain the juice and serve.

Wow. I could seriously eat these beans every night. Both the beans and the tomatoes came from our garden and as the tomatoes were naturally sweet I just used half a tsp of sugar. Great sidedish thanks so much.

This was good. Needs some salt. I did not boil the beans, they were fresh from the garden so I just sauteed them in the butter with the other ingreds. Used frsh garlic, not garlic salt and added more fresh basil than called for, probably about 3 Tbs. Will make again but less butter.

I didn't like this as much as i thought i would.  I did use frozen green beans rather than fresh.  Perhaps that made the difference.  To me, there was something off about the flavor.  a little too sweet.  Maybe some acid from lemon or vinegar would have helped.

Hickory Springs is a Farmers' Market and Bistro.  This recipe was tried because of an abundance of cherry tomatoes.  I give out samples to my lunch time customers and everyone including me loved it.  Now I serve it as a side dish.
Thanks

I used grape tomatoes from our garden, so I added less sugar.  And I took a previous reviewer's recommendation, adding real chopped garlic and salt rather than garlic salt.  This would be a good dish even without the tomatoes!

Awesome combination!!!
I of course used FRESH green beans from our garden - and it was heavinly!  I actually couldn't stop eating all of the tomatoes while they were cooking in the butter sauce!  I would not cook tomatoes very long at all - I prefer them slightly firm!  Thanks for the recipe!!  A new way to fix a southern favorite!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used frozen green beans, because that's what I had, and it was still quite tasty. The basil and tomato combination was very good; I used frozen basil from last year's garden -- much better than dried. Next time, I will probably add a bit more salt, but that was not a major problem.

Great recipe - I added sauted mushrooms to the green beans and tomatoes before adding the dressing for a twist, and it was the "big hit" for my Thanksgiving dinner!

I didn't really like these but I'm giving it a 4 because I got lots of compliments on it, so I guess other people did!  I think I cooked it too long so the tomatoes were really soggy.  I would just caution you to not overcook!

This recipe was fine, but I wasn't as impressed as most of the reviewers.  I think that you have to know going in that you like a sweet, buttery sauce. Neither my family, nor the family for whom I provided a "new baby" dinner loved it, but everyone ate it.  I followed the recipe exactly with fresh, quality ingredients.
