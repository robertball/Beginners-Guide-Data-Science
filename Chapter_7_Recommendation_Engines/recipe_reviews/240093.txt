I used fresh albacore tuna I found on sale at Whole Foods for $8 a lb. I used a whole jalapeño, minced, about twice as much as called for, but thought it could have used more. A wonderful dish, easy to prepare, can make it several hours before serving except for mixing the last parts in. We loved it!

Made no changes, but I sliced everything a lot smaller than the pictures on here.  Make sure you get a firm avocado so the chunks don't fall apart when you mix the ingredients.

I made it with shrimp and green onions. Doubled everything but the lemon and lime. It's delicious!

We liked this recipe. My first time making ceviche. It was just a little too acidic for my taste, otherwise it was very tasty. I made this pretty much exactly as directed. I did drain most of the lime/lemon juice before mixing the rest of the ingredients. I also used an unripe or hard avocado so it would hold up better.

Love! Love! Love this ceviche! I’ve made it several times and this last time I added 1/3 cup of juice from a juice orange and it added a nice touch.

I followed the recipe and all ingredients and it came out good. I will try it again and add a little more orange. I felt there was something missing for a full body flavor.

This was fabulous. I prefer this type of fish to others I have tried. It's just right tender, but not chewy like scallops or shrimp tend to be. I cut down on the radish.
