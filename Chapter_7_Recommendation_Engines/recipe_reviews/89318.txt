I used an english cucumber for this recipe and to keep the dip from being watery, once finely chopped, I sprinkled a bit of salt on the cucs, placed in a colander and weighted it with a can of peas to help drain out the liquid. Left it in the fridge for a couple of hours and then proceeded with the dish. Refreshing and very good. Thanks!

This dip was very good...be sure to salt the diced cucumber and let it sit a while to draw out the water first or you will have a runny dip.

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT FOR ANY EVENT. I HAVE FOUND THAT IF YOU USE PITA BREAD (GLAZED IN OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC SALT & BROWNED) AS YOUR "DIPPING AIDE" IT REALLY GOES WELL WITH THE DIP. I HAVE OFTEN USED A CAN OF SALMON THAT I FRY IN A PAN, TO ADD TO THE DIP! ITS DELICIOUS AND ALWAYS A GUEST FAVORITE!

I love this dip! Instead of using sour cream, I use a full brick of cream cheese.  I make it all the time now!

This is a very refreshing recipe.  I did add a little fresh lemon juice and used green onion to give it some color.

Loved this, as did my Mothers Day company....used reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream. I also roasted a head of garlic and the whole head instead of the raw garlic for this dip. The flavors were fantastic. I also used 1/2 of an English cucumber to reduce the amount of liquid and drained it as well. I did  double the recipe and served with melba toast, sesame bread sticks and baked tostitos. Excellent!

everyone at our Homeschool co-op LOVED this only thing different I did was add about 1/4 cup of feta and 8 oz of cream cheese and a dollop more of sour cream. Enjoy it's good. Thank you.

I used a whole large cucumber and quadrupled the garlic. Because I had a little to use, I used chopped green onion as the onion in this recipe. This was good with the Garlic Pita Bread Bites, the bites were already seasoned so I didn't need to worry about the dip being seasoned. They went really well together. There's only about a half cup of dip left out of the whole bowl......maybe. Next time, I might add even more cucumber.

This dip was pretty good.  I think if I make it next time, I will onlly use 1/4 of a cucumber and seed it as well.  The cucumber seemed to make the dip watery.  I ended up adding more cream cheese to make it thick again.  It was a good base though, a change from my usual ranch dip.

This dip is good and addicting!  We like to eat it with those pretzel chips that you can find at the deli or regular bagged pretzles are good too.

This was a nice mild dip.  Too mild for our tastes.  I finely grated the onion simply because my little one only likes onion she cannot see.  :)  I peeled and grated the cucumber, salted it, and came back a half hour later to squeeze out excess moisture (like you would frozen spinach), before putting it in the dip.  There were several tablespoons worth of juice in the bowl when I was done, so take that into consideration when you make this - if you don't salt/drain the cucumber, your dip will not be thick.  Having said that, I found it a bit bland.  That may be simply because I prefer not to add salt to dishes.  You may be happy with this dip with a few heavy pinches of salt and turns of the peppermill.  I added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and dried dill, and let it all sit and meld overnight  before serving.  This is a very good 'base' recipe - zucchini could be subbed for the cucumber, and a packet of onion soup mix would have worked here too.

I shredded my cucumber and put it in a collander over a bowl, sprinkled it with some salt, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hour so drain the liquid so the dip did not get watery. It goes very well with deep fried zuchini made with the beer batter recipe on this site. Delicious!

Shred the cucumber with a grater, then wrap it in a towel (or equivalent) and ring out the juice. Perfect! This dip must sit at least 2 h before enjoying it.

This was good.  We served with Salmon and Zucchini Pancakes.  Very mild in flavor.  My five year old said it was bland.  Garlic amount was fine for us.  Just needed some more flavor.  Will try again adding some Greek seasoning.

Refreshingly different and tasty! I doubled the recipe and finely chopped the cucumber, placed in a strainer with bowl, lightly salted to draw the water out and put in refrigerator for an hour. Only change I made was to add dill. Served with veggies and pita chips. This is a keeper!

This dip is very delicious and refreshing. Ilike to add cilantro to it and serve it along with crisp pita and hummus.  This is not your standard dip and chilps but it's nice to mix up occasionally.

I loved the idea of this dip, but neither my husband or I were a big fan of it.   Sounds like a lot of other people really  enjoyed it by the other reviews, but we will not be making it again.

I used an english cucumber and scraped out most of the seeds as mentioned in reviews and the consistancy was perfect.  I ended up making 3 batches to cover a staff party, Chritsmas Eve and Christmas Day. The remarks were all "pleasant and refreshing".  Thanks, I appreciated the quick and easy prep.

Grating the cucumber was easier to get the water out. I just grated it with the skin, cause I think it is pretty, and the let it dry on a paper towl for a while.Much better and like another reveiwer- salt the cucumber ever so slightly, while you let them dry out a bit.

Awesome dip, I used as a spread for a veggie roll-up. I love garlic, but this was a little too garlic-y. Wouldn't eat before going to a meeting or a date! 

Every time I make this I like it more and more. Amazing on an everything bagel stacked full of veggies (cucumber, romaine, tomato and avocado) Mmmm!!

I was feverishly looking for something different to bring to a BBQ yesterday and found this recipe.  I had everything in the house so I figured nothing ventured, nothing gained!  Everyone at the party LOVED this dip.  I made it in the morning as per the recipe and let it sit for 4 hours.  Tis gave the dip time to blend flavors.  It was so good!!  I made it figure friendly and served it with carrots, pita chips and, of course, cucumbers!  Thanks so much for this quick and easy take-along dip!

Delicious,  I used the recipe ingredients as a base and made a small amount...I wanted to use it as a mix in instead of a dip...I dont measure things...but a couple heaps of light sour cream, a heap of cream cheese , added minced garlic,  smoked paprika (little sprinkle), dried dill weed,  parsley, little salt and pepper...mixed it up let in sit in the fridge while I was sweating my diced mini cukes and red onion.
Mixed it all together....really good taste...
Thanks

This was a crowd pleaser!  I cut out the seeds which I'm glad I did, since it would have been rather watery. I would cut way down on the onion. My hubby also suggested to chop up the cucumber a little bit finer, but he really liked it!

I added a squeeze of lime juice to give it some extra flavor and it turned out great!

This is a really good recipe, although when I made it per the ingredient list, it really lacked any kind of pizzazz, so I jacked it up with more salt and garlic, and some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.  I added in some bread crumbs to give break up the very thick creamy texture.  Even with all that, the cucumber shines through nicely.  :)

I really liked this.  I had the same problem with my dip being too watery (just like a few others)...even though I had drained the cucumber and seeded it.  Will try an English cucumber next time to see if it helps.  Thanks for a delicius dip.

I found this dip, as written, to be just "alright".  I added lots of salt and pepper (already part of the recipe) but also some dried, powdered mustard, worchestershire sauce, and also some seasoned salt.  It was pretty good after that.

I love cucumbers, but this did not have much zip.  I also should have drained my cucumber.

Simple, light and very good. Definately use potato chips, tried other chips and potato chips are the best. Also used garlic salt.
