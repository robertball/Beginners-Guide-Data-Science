This was delicious. The only real changes I made were using flour tortilla and layered it like a lasagna, two tortillas per layer (I used a small casserole dish ... maybe 9x4) and instead of the salsa, I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. I served it with nacho scoops. Yummy... will definitely be making again.

Kind of bland as written. If I had it to do over, I would probably add a can of hot or nmedium enchilada sauce. Also, I would "dress it up" by topping it with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream when serving. It's salvageable if you add those things, but straight up as is would be pretty boring. Maybe ok if you're feeding a room full of fussy kindergarteners, but for adults not so much.

Made it but used black beans instead of refried, added some mozzarella cheese along with Mexican taco mix cheese.  Used Tacos al pastor seasoning instead of plain  taco cause that's what I had. Used shells and some chips.   Tasty!

This was really good. I used taco seasoning & enchilada red sauce. I also topped with shredded lettuce, sour cream & diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the recipe idea.

I thought this was really good! I used salsa and a ban of green chilis, cheered up a jalapeno pepper and slack Olives and refried beans and layered all that with restaurant style chips and shredded Mexican cheese. Topped it with sour cream at the end. I thought it was a nice mix of chewy chips and crunchy ones. Basically came out like really good nachos. I would spice it wp next time with maybe some chili powder and hot sauce.

Mine was a little dry even though I added extra salsa and only used 12 taco shells. Next time I’ll add red enchilada sauce.

Very good overall. I used what I had in my pantry so I substituted 1/2 can of red beans for the refried beans and added 1/2 can of corn. I used 1/4 cup more salsa and 1 1/2 packets of taco seasoning. Lastly I used Doritos, again because I had that type of corn chip in my pantry. Next time I will used medium instead of mild salsa to make it a bit more spicy. It was hearty and my sons liked it. Will definitely make again!

Added a can of mild Rotel and used flour tortillas. Would use hot Rotel next time and have hot salsa for my son who said it wasn’t spicy enough.

Made this and used spiced tortilla chips for layering. They were too crunchy and lended a blah texture to the dish. Was definitely better as leftovers with sourcreamand pico.

I used tortilla chips and Doritos mixed together and I also added black beans to the refried beans. This recipe was a hit for the entire family (age range 65-8). I will definitely make it again.

I added more salsa and used flavored doritos; it came out great.  I won't use the doritos again; they don't bake well. It was still really good and I will make it again.

Quick- easy & easily modified if you must. My hubby loved it. I add ed some hit sauce (red & green) instead if salsa.
