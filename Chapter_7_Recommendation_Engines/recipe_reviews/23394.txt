A lot of the flavor of this cake will depend on what flavor Jell-O you use. If your not that keen on orange or simply think that orange Jello-O would not taste good with chocolate cake, then don't use that flavor. I used Black Berry Fusion Jell-O and I found the flavors went very well together. The Jell-O keeps the cake super moist and unlike another reviewer, I didn't have a problem with the cake crumbling. We also really liked the frosting.

This cake turned out fabulous! I made it for a dinner party, and everyone was impressed. It was very moist and melted in your mouth.

My grocery store didn't have the whipped topping mix, so I used a tub of frozen whipped topping (Cool Whip(R)). I still mixed it with the chocolate pudding, and just added a bit of milk to help with the consistency.

Also, I didn't need such a large cake for the small dinner party, so I split the cake into 1 one cake and 12 cupcakes.

I liked the frosting for this cake but the cake itself was awfully crumbly and tasted odd. Maybe I am just not used to a chocolate jello cake.
