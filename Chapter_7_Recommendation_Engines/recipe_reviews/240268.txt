Was scanning thru allrecipes trying to find something to make with my leftover croissants.  Although I didn't have chocolate croissants I followed the recipe exactly with plain croissants, great flavor and so easy to put together.  Thanks for sharing.

This was super easy and a yummy way to use up leftover croissants. I made it in a 9X13 pan and baked about 45 minutes. Turned out really well. Next time I will add more chocolate chips or use mini chips.

I made this for dessert when my son and his girlfriend came for dinner.  It was such a hit I am making it again for the family BBQ.  I did not have chocolate croissants.  I made it with plain and added approx 1/4 cup of extra choc. chips. I baked in a 9X13 pan for approx. 40-45min.

Had 2 medium-sized chocolate and 2 medium-sized plain stale croissants. Buttered an 8" square pan. Used a can of evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup 1% milk, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Soaked 45 minutes, added 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked about 40 minutes. Left off the powdered sugar since I didn't have any. Be still my heart!

Yummy! I started off with just two VERY stale chocolate croissants (still not sure how they didn't get eaten fresh), so I halved the recipe and made sure the cut-up croissants got a good half hour in the custard before baking. Baked the whole thing in a 6-cup Pyrex dish for about 28 minutes. Since I didn't have a whole vanilla bean, I used about 2 tsp. of vanilla bean paste, and since that has sugar in it, I reduced the added sugar as well.   Wonderful flavor and texture.

I changes the chocolate chips for raisins and cut  the sugar down to less than 1/2 cup.(I'm a diabetic) but so wanted bread pudding and all I had was croissants.
would sooooo make it again. I used large muffin tins and it made 6 beautiful ones. I'm trying out freezing some for later.
