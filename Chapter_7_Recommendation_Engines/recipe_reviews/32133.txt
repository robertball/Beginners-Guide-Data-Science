This was very popular in WWII.  YOu had to extend your food as much as possible, and one thing more easily available were weiners and bologna chubs. By grinding it with fillers, you could get more sandwiches than serving one weiner per person.  These were called Victory Spreads.  Helping to bring our boys home with our Victory Recipes!

Wow does this ever bring back memories!  My Grandma used to make this for every birthday party.  She had an old fashioned meat grinder she used to use - thank God for food processors! She'd add a little dill pickle juice and maybe some chopped celery to add a little "crunch" but other than that this is a pretty simple and straightforward recipe.  It's great on little potato rolls or white bread with the crusts removed and cut into little triangles.  Kids go nuts for these and a little goes a long way.

I must agree with Uncle Foxy.  Mom made this for 10 years, calling it "Ham Salad".  After grinding the bologna, process a quarter of onion and 2 strips of celery through grinder.  This makes a good salad.

I grew up eating this and calling it ham salad.  I was very surprised to learn later in life that ham salad could be made with HAM!!!

I grew up eating this, too, only Grandma used bologna from Canada. Nothing against American bologna but Canadian bologna is just way better. Grandma also added half an onion and a little mustard. If you're looking for something to compare it to, it's kind of like deviled ham spread only with bologna. It's really like nothing you've ever had before.

Fine dining indeed.  I remember Mom making this for us kids back in the 60s and we'd have friends over during the summer for lunch and she'd give us a big bowl of it with a loaf of bread and Kool Aid and send us all out to the patio and we were in Kid Heaven.  Thanks for the good memory and hence that's why I gave it 5 "stars".!

What an awesome recipe to find on here! I remember making this with my Great Grandma when I was younger. She would get out the heavy hand cranked meat grinder, and let me put the ingredients through. Sometimes we would add hard boiled eggs, onions, or cheese as well. Always finished by running a few saltines through the grinder. We always called it "Monkey Meat". Not sure where the name came from...but that's what it is to me! lol

This was a blast from the past. I found this recipe completely by accident. Growing up in Pennsylvania, this was a lunchbox staple. I don't know how often I'll make it because my picky kids think it's weird, but I really enjoyed it! Thanks for bringing back a wonderful childhood memory!

Made this just a few months ago, using the old fashioned grinder that I bought at an estate sale.  My Mom's recipe.  The same as above but you add a boiled egg and some American cheese to the grinded ingredients. Instead of pickle relish, you grind sweet pickles into the mix.  It was always served with spaghetti soup (cooked spaghetti, butter, milk, salt and pepper).  I am sure that it was a "Depression era meal" but I love it so.

In my house we grind onion in with the bologna. We also use 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 miracle whip along with sweet pickle relish. We always use white bread. To make it "fancy" we cut it in triangles. I love this stuff!

This is a  really quick and good spread. There is a PA Dutch version, only its made with Sweet Lebanon Bologna and some other ingredients. I love how PA people are creative with cooking. It must be built into most of us :)

Sounds like my mother's recipe.  I'm 64 yrs old and remember her grinding the balogna in the counter mounted hand crank grinder.  It was great. (She also used to tell me that those little things in tapioca pudding were fish eyes).  I'll try your recipe tomorrow.

Not bad, if you like bologna!  This is exactly what we used to do with that tube of liverwurst you get in the lunchmeat section - mash with mayo and pickles!  Good sandwiches though!

I have my Grandmother's meat grinder and I only use it for a recipe of sandwich spread. I use ring bologna. I also use baby sweet pickles and not the relish. I also add a jar of pimento for color.
Always was, and will be, a favorite!!!!!

Party Meat!  Thanks for the recipe.  I had this recipe a while back but lost it.  There seemed to be a debate amongst my coworkers on which was better...dill pickle relish or sweet pickle relish.  Miracle Whip or Real Mayonnaise.  Bologna or ham. I guess it's just a matter of taste.  Heard the traditional birthday party 'party meat sandwich' was served on Pullman Loaf with the crusts cut off.  In little triangles, of course!

I gave this a 3 because it needed a little more flavor. I added dill pickle instead of relish ,also added onion and a couple of hard boiled eggs.  I put everything through the meat grinder, made a great sandwich.  This is more like the one I had when I was growimg up.

We grew up on this however we made it with balogna, cheese(such as slices of american), sweet pickles, onion, and mayo. We still have get-togethers and somebody always has to bring balogna grind.  We always used a meat grinder. Run pickles and onions through last to clean out grinder. Also our school made a version of this in the 60's. Don't knock it until you try it.  May also add boiled eggs but will last longer in frig. if you don't. LOVE IT AND WAYS A REAL TREAT GROWING UP. Can use canned meats such as spam, luncheon meat or commadoties canned meat that people get in commadoties or Indian rations.
