Very, very easy. Very, very good. I could not believe this only had three ingredients. I had my honeydew chilled in the fridge before I cut it up so this cut some of the chilling time down. Also, I tried without the oatmeal cookie and while it was very good, the cookie added a little something extra. Plan to try it with an iced oatmeal cookie in a few minutes to see how that goes. Everyone loved this and I will be making many more times. Also, I took one cookie and shredded it instead of crumbling and it absorbed the moisture too much. Make them big crumbles.

The soup itself was pretty good! I just prefer not to put in the blueberries next time. I tried putting in strawberries in as well and that ended up working out really well! :)

This soup was soooo good!  I used graham crackers instead of cookies and got really excited thinking about all the variations that you can do with different types of cookies and crackers--chocolate graham crackers, ginger snaps, animal cookies...yum!

It's amazing what a great taste the oatmeal cookies added to it.  A perfect blend.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point for a variation.  My goal was to recreate the taste of a soup I had on a cruise.  Here are my changes.  I added about 1/2 cup of plain whole milk yogurt and approx 1/4 cup sugar to the honeydew in the blender.  Then I strained the puree through a mesh colander to thin out the slightly grainy texture of the soup.  Finally, I used blackberries instead of blueberries (only because blueberries weren't in season) and left off the cookie (because I didn't have one and because I think the thinner soup wouldn't support a cookie crumble).  I like the results!

I loved this because it was a great starting point.  I did the honeydew with blackberries, awesome, thank you!  I was not a fan of the cookie.  I added a little honey to mine and put just a touch of sour cream on top.  One was a great foil for the other.  I found that I liked cantelope better with the blue berries.  I added just a touch of Brandy to the mix, very good!

An easy-to-make refreshing soup, perfect for a hot day. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I found the blueberry/honeydew combination to be slightly bland. Replacing the blueberries w/ some other berry that has a stronger flavor, such as strawberries or raspberries, would  be great. I used gingersnap granola instead of crumbled oatmeal cookies, and it worked out very well. Anything crunchy, sweet, and preferably w/ a bit of a gingery/spice kick would be good. This would be great for breakfast or dessert.

This was perfect for a hot summer day.  The oarmeal cookies on the top really complemented this soup.

When I first tasted this, it was much like a smoothie. But after first bite it wasn't very good. The flavor is nice, but it is definitely missing something if you are going to eat more than one spoonful. I tried it with oatmeal cookies and even just oatmeal and thought each of those made it worse than alone. I also tried a few cereals and strangely cherrios was the best, but still not great. Granola might work, but I still don't think that will be it. I don't know what it needs, but definitely won't be making this again.

simple and good. i sprinkled a little bit of ginger on top, along with the cookie, and it tasted great! i might add plain or vanilla yogurt next time to make it a little less grainy, but otherwise the recipe is great!!

I served it without the oatmeal cookies. Did a single serving by combining 1/2 cup of honeydew with about a tbsp of almond milk (simply because the honeydew was still too thick after pureeing). Also added one splenda packet to sweeten it-- my honeydew was a bit sour. Results-- very good, crisp and refreshing! Added about a 1/4 cup of blueberries to the top after chilling. Easy! With my modifications (without cookie, but + about 5 cals for the almond milk) this came out to 57 calories, 39 mg of sodium, 11g of sugars, 13g of carbs, 1g of protein and 2g of fiber.

I didn't like this even though I do like all of the ingredients.  Maybe I didn't chill it long enough.

I thought this was excellent!  You have to be sure to pick the ripest melon you can but I also used blackberries instead of blueberries just because I like them better.  I also added a few pinches of Himalayan Pink Sea Salt (you can get it at World Market) prior to chilling which helped to bring out all the flavors.  The only oatmeal cooking I had in the house were the Gril Scout Cartwheel cookies so I used them but next time I am going to try with ginger snaps as mentioned by someone else.

I just did not care for this -- the look nor the taste.  Would just much rather eat slices of melon and a handful of the berries.

Loved this one too!  The oatmeal cookies have just enough hint of cinnamon that it add a little extra flavor.

10+++ stars!! I made it exactly as stated and it was awesome.  I pulsed the food processor to leave it kinda chunky.  If you like this one, try the chilled cantaloupe soup, because its just as good as this one, and just as simple too.

It's a good base. On its own, I felt like it tasted like baby food, too bland and mushy. I ended up mixing the leftovers with strawberries and tapioca and baking it with a 'crumble' topping (brown sugar, flour, oats, and butter). Thanks, though.
