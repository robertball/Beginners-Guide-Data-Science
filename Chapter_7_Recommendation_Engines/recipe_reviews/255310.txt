Um, these were awesome!! I logged mine into my app and they are only 6g net carbs, for the record.  You can reduce that by replacing some of the flour with whey protein, also.  I personally do not use poppy seeds, so I replaced those with chia seeds and did 2Tbsp. Also, I suspected it would not be lemony enough for my tastes, so I added 1/2 tsp lemon oil. I will do 1tsp next time! Also, I didn't have any sour cream so I used very thick, plain Greek yogurt. They were fantastic, thank you for sharing!

When I make these everyone loves them! Even people that don’t eat keto.  My only substitutions were I used unsalted ghee instead of butter and I added 1tbsp lemon extract, to make them more lemony.  They were perfect

Yummy! I used 1/2 cup of erythritol instead of 1/3 cup of Stevia  since erythritol isn't as sweet as Stevia, and it came out great. I used both lemon zest as well as a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract, to make sure it was nice and lemony. I also included the vanilla extract but when I make this again (and I definitely will be making it again!) I may try substituting almond extract for the vanilla.

I really enjoyed these and found them to come out delicious. I think I’ll need to cut the salt down a bit but I was also wondering if anyone knew any techniques to make them less dense. I just started my keto diet and haven’t really worked with different flours so I thought I’d ask

I made these for the second time today.  The first time I used erythritol sweetener and they were not sweet enough.  Today I used Splenda sugar blend (.25 cups per batch) and they are perfect.  I made a double batch but used all of the mix in 12 average size muffin tins which made them a bit larger, but better in my opinion.  I baked them at 350 for 14 minutes and they are perfect.  Next time I will try erythritol again in a larger quantity to test the sweetness without adding carbs.  I also would like to try coconut oil in place of butter.

As a new keto dieter, I was desperate for decent recipes to make to help my carb cravings.  I was happy to see this recipe as I love lemons and poppy seeds.  I made this recipe as it and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was pretty good!  It wasn't as good as a regular lemon muffin made with flour, but no one should expect it to either.   They freeze well too.  Thank you for the recipe!

OMG! 
I’ve tried so many Keto friendly recipes, and this one is my favorite by far. I just baked a batch and ate it warm. It’s moist and nice texture. I used coconut oil and instead of the heavy cream I used the lemon juice, as I like it sour. I also used stevia extract to taste.
I do  recommend it.

These are good. Great texture. They don’t taste lemony to me so next time I’ll add a tsp lemon extract. Doesn’t add any carbs.

My favorite muffin is a lemon poppy seed. When I saw this recipe I just had to make it. They were delicious and lasted all about 5 minutes out of the oven, lol. I will definitely be making these again!

I made these muffins this morning and my kids loved them. They're not usually fond of gluten-free, low carb "bread" things, but they demolished these. I'll make a double batch next time, for sure!

(I didn't have a lemon or poppy seeds, but used food-grade lemon essential oil, for the lemon flavor.)

These were excellent!  I baked mine for about 30 minutes.  I think I needed more time because I added about 1/2 tablespoon more cream.  They were the perfect amount of sweetness.  I will definitely be making these again.

I made these exactly as written.  the texture was great but the
aftertaste was a bit off.  I would say a bit bitter.  I used stevia
so not sure what i would have done wrong or perhaps just me

I wasn’t a big fan of this muffin but I’m giving it 4 stars because my husband ate them up. He’s on the Keto diet and wasn’t a fan about the amount of carbs this muffin had but it was an easy go to when he had a bit of a sweet tooth at night. The only substitution I made was the type of sour cream I used. I had Mexican sour cream on hand which is a little sweeter than the regular stuff you find at the grocery store.

Texture is dense & hard to get past.  Better after they set-up for a day or two.  A little too oily as well.  Flavor is ok, but would not make again.

I eat low carb and sometimes I miss lemon poppy muffins. I was so excited to find this recipe, and I followed exactly with the exception of omitting the optional 1/4 tsp xantham gum. I am dissapointed to say the taste literally made me nauseous. They taste like greasy, buttery, chemically sweetened scrambled eggs with a citrus after taste. I tried to eat a whole one and couldn't. I'm not sure what I did wrong but I will stick to cheat days or no sweets at all, if this is the alternative.

LOVED IT!  I substituted coconut flour with Flaxseed, and the erythritol with coconut sugar. There is also heavy cream involved.  Overall, I would make again and again.

Used soy flour for extra protein and worked fine. Was too runny as measured so had to add extra flour. Satisfies those carby cravings when low-carb dieting.

These turned out better than expected! I wish they would’ve raised a bit more, but I wonder if it’s because I subbed lemon extract for lemon zest. Nonetheless, they are a nice change from eggs for breakfast when you’re following a ketogenic lifestyle.

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  I have just started the Keto diet to reduce my risk of the full on-slaught of diabetes.  It truly appeases my cravings for carbs and sweets.
I make it into 6 muffins and it takes closer to 30 minutes to cook.  Thanks for the recipe....I hope you have more to share:)
