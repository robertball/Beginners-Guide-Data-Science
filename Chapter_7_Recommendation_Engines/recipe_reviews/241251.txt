Made this a few times. Great as-is! Although it's a bit more like scrambled egg pie than the silky custard I prefer. Here's the substitution that nailed it for me. Use 4 eggs, 1/2 cup half & half, and 1 1/2 cups whole milk. That's it! One other opt

A really good quiche and a nice fresh salad always bring a smile to my face, and today, I was smiling.  I did make a couple substitutions.  I used asiago cheese instead of swiss (what was on hand) and substituted Egg Beaters® for the eggs to lower cholesterol.    Lindsey322, I agree with you:  this quiche is creamy, simple, and delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the third quiche recipe I've tried here at All Recipes and one of the best. I don't think I would have thought using mustard, but it really adds to the flavor. No green onion, so I yellow, and all I had was Dijon mustard and used that. I diced the onion, cooked ham, and also 3 cloves of garlic minced (I LOVE garlic) and  added to a frying pan with with olive oil until the onion was tender.. This gets any water in the ham and onion out. No half and half so I used 3/4 cup light cream and 1/2 cup heavy cream and no Swiss so I substituted shredded sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of Cayenne pepper. I also used a store bought 9" pie shell. Hmmm... so rich and creamy and the mustard adds a unique zing to it.

I thought this quiche was okay. I didn't get the creamy texture that others described. I would say it was more like a soft boiled egg texture. I have had better quiche, less time consuming, and less costly recipes. Also, the recipe should say use a deep dish or wide crust. I had a semi deep dish crust I made homemade. The filling still seemed to spill over some as it baked. I am glad I ended up placing the pie plate over a foiled lined rimmed baking sheet. I would have had one messy oven otherwise. Taste wise, it wasn't bad just a little oniony. Not a repeat dish, but nice to try something I hadn't eaten in years.

It made this quiche yesterday and my husband and I really liked it. The only change I made was omitting the honey mustard. I didn't have any on hand. The quiche tasted great without it. I may add some diced bacon next time. I'll definitely make this again. It's an easy breakfast meal to have in my recipe box.

I made this for my family. It came out good and it looked nice. I did change a few things just because I didn't have the ingredients. I used Colby cheese instead of Swiss. I also used sweet onion instead of green. Like I said because I didn't have the called for ingredients. I also added broccoli to one pie and mushrooms to another. One thing I will do different, I will make homemade crust next time. I used store bought frozen crust and I really think that it would be worth the time to make it from scratch. All in all good recipe and I would recommend it.

I had to substitute havarti for Swiss, and used a Rosemary deli sliced ham, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was delicious cheesy and creamy, just as described. Will make again.

This is so yummy and really easy to make. My kids loved it!!  The only change I had to make was I substituted an egg for the 1/4 cup of half and half.( Didn't have enough cream) Thanks for sharing! I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for Christmas brunch. It was so easy and such a hit that I make it all the time now.   Only change I made once  was because I had no cheddar I used 1 1/2 C swiss and dijon mustard.  It was still great and creamy.

Followed the recipe exactly, using a store bought deep dish pie shell and honeybaked ham.  This quiche was wonderful - very creamy.  Can't wait to make it again :-)

If I make this again, I'll reduce how much honey mustard was in it. The tang was a little strong.

Was a little hesitant deviating from my regular quiche recipe, but made this for a brunch, it was delicious, everyone raved about it. And only crumbs were left! Reheats well too!

I just made this tonight. Everyone was so hungry I didn’t have a chance to take a pic! But it turned out beautifully! My daughter is a vegetarian so I left out the ham and I had to wing the honey mustard with 1T mustard/1T  blue agave.  Everyone absolutely loved it! I served it with some sliced white new potatoes sautéed with green onions and called it a meal.

I got a lot of compliments on this quiche. My love thought it had to much cheese to ham ratio. I would make it again with a few adjustments.

Served it as the main dish at my brunch yesterday.  It was excellent and my guests raved about it.  I didn't have any Swiss cheese so substituted extra cheddar.  I used store bought deep dish pastry shell; there was a bit too much filling.  I was afraid it would run over while baking.  So I just used less filling and placed the quiche on a cookie sheet to bake.  Yummy.  I'll be using this recipe again.

This quiche was quick and easy. I had more swiss than cheddar so I swapped those amounts for one another, took out two of the five yolks from the egg mixture, only had a cup of half & half instead of 1 1/4 c, and used dijon mustard instead of honey mustard (it was all I had.)  The result was creamy and delicious! It baked more quickly than many quiches I have made, and really didn't take long to make. Would definitely make again.

The best quiche ever!  I forgot to add the second tablespoon of flour but it came out perfect anyway.  I also did not have honey mustard on hand so I just made my own with a combo of regular mustard and honey....does add a nice touch to the ham.

First quiche I’ve ever made and I tried the variety with 4 eggs, but reduced to 1/2 c half and half and 1 cup milk. If you get an already made crust in a pie pan you will have extra liquid so you may have fill if you aren’t careful.

OUTRAGEOUS!!  Best light, custard quiche recipe EVER!  Used whipping cream, grated Colby/Jack & Fontina.  Crust edge was a bit too brown, even though I had covered it throughout .  Think I’ll use a shorter pre-browning time for the blind baked crust, or start with a frozen pastry shell (mine was storebought and from fridge.  Brava on this recipe!!!!!

I took a gamble on this one since my husband doesn’t like Swiss cheese or onions. He ate it! It was very tasty, but I definitely needed a deep dish pie crust. The filling went way past the crust in the dish. I considered omitting the green onions, but I’m so glad I left them in. I did omit the salt, as the ham was salty enough. I didn’t have honey mustard, so I used 1 T of Dijon and 1 T of honey. Worked for me! If I were making this for myself in the future (sans picky husband), I’d use more Swiss and less cheddar, but I love Swiss cheese!

Made this tonight..very tasty !    Didn't have honey mustard so mixed spicy brown mustard with little bit of honey to coat the diced ham.  Otherwise followed recipe as written.  Excellent in both texture and taste.  Served with a salad. Perfect for warm summer night dinner.  Was hoping to have leftover for lunch tomorrow but all gone.   Will definitely make this quick and easy dish again  soon.   Thanks for submitting it.

I made this recipe and my husband and I absolutely loved it.  Creamy and with a hint of sweetness . The next week, my husband asked me to make it again - that never happens.
I didn't have honey mustard, so I blended 1 Tablespoon of French's with 1 Tablespoon of honey.  I didn't have half-and-half, so I used 50% heavy whipping cream with 50% whole milk. 
I also used a frozen deep dish pie crust, f

I doubled the recipe and added spinach. I also added mushrooms to half since some people I made it for does not like mushrooms. They thought it had too much mustard, but otherwise good.  With all the mustard we scored it a 2-3 out of 5 stars.

Before I cooked the second quiche I rinsed off a bunch of the mustard, leaving just a little. It came out really good! With just a little bit of mustard we scored it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Great recipe! I didn't have honey mustard so I used Spicy Brown mustard.  Worked well. I also added some broccoli, just because. Also it was the only recipe that precooked the crust, which meant the crust wasn't mushy. Will make again!

My new favorite ham and cheese quiche, the mustard is subtle but adds depth to the flavor. I used Goldens spicy mustard, all cheddar cheese and almond milk, loved it.

Made this quiche for dinner. The only change was I didn’t add any salt as my ham was already a tad salty.  Was a hit at dinner, most definitely will make again. Will add some mushrooms and broccoli next time. Nice recipe to have as a quick go to. Thank you for submitting

It was terrific!! I added an extra option of putting 1 tablespoon of Lipton’s dry onion soup mix into the milk/cheese sauce.

I make quiche quite regularly. I used all the ingredients but different proportions. Some more of this and some more of that and maybe not as much as this. I will definitely make it again. The honey mustard did it for us. Perfect!

Delicious and something different to add to the breakfast or brunch menu.  Spice and variety goes a long way.

Very good!  Dijon mustard without the honey works just fine.  I added a tbsp of chopped  fresh tarragon and I suggest using beans or pie beads to keep the crust “disciplined”.   A keeper!

Needed to try out a quiche recipe before I make one for work. This one was perfect! Very easy! Didn't have half & half so I did what another reviewer suggested and substituted an extra egg and added a little milk. Also only had spicy brown mustard and used it instead of honey mustard and also added green, red, and yellow diced peppers. Great recipe!

Delicious and Easy! I made this quiche but didn't have honey mustard, substituted an equal parts maple syrup/mustard blend for the amount of honey mustard needed. It changed the flavor slightly but was quite good. The second time I made it I had honey mustard. Again, delicious!
