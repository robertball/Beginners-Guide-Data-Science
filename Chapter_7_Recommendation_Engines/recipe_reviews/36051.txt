This recipe received raves at an all appetizer extravaganza. I made the filling the day before I served them and stuffed the wontons the morning of the party.  I ended up using about 3/4 of a bottle of peanut sauce and I thought they were perfect; no dipping sauce needed.  The filling was nice and moist and the wontons crisp. Great recipe!  Since my original review I have frozen these after baking and then reheated in the oven--still delicious!

Next time I would use less ground pork, up the veggies and add cabbage to take out some of the fat.  Also, I used soy instead of the peanut sauce and it was delicious.

I made this using my favorite wonton filling recipe and was pleasantly surprised with how well the wontons crisped in the oven.  I usually fry them and I like this option which saves both time and calories.

AWESOME recipe!  So easy and delicious.  Everyone asked what was in it.  Instead of the thai peanut sauce I put in soy and hoisin sauce, delicious combination.  I also added coleslaw mix instead of the water chestnuts.  Made for a great taste and texture.

We loved this dish!  I made them in regular sized muffin tins, so, not as much an appetizer as a snack and as we had it, a light dinner.  I added some powdered ginger and salt and pepper to the meat mixture.  I mixed in the thai peanut sauce as directed and found that it was wasted in the meat mixture.  For my second batch, I drizzled the sauce on top of the filled cups instead and it was very yummy!  But, don't forget to season your meat mixture if you do this, since the recipe relies on the thai peanut sauce for all seasoning.  It was yummy, we all loved it!

These were pretty easy to make (though we did add prep time in using a round biscuit cutter to cut all of the wontons into circles to make the snacks look nicer).  After we put them together, I put a damp towel over the top then wrapped in a big plastic bag to keep the won ton shells moist until baked. Great flavor and presentation - not a typical appetizer - but just as easy really.

Wow!  Everybody loved these. Tasted like a won 
ton in a Chinese restaurant that we can never get enough of. Served with the oriental dipping sauce, they were even better.

My daughter Ashley LOVES these. I added more seasonings and folded them in half and deep fried in my fry daddy for our party yesterday. A great appetizer that everyone went nuts over! Thanks Denise!

The best!  Everyone I've ever made this for raves.  I don't add water chestnuts or Thai peanut sauce.  Instead I add fresh ginger, finely minced, along with finely chopped green cabbage.  Add Thai sweet dipping sauce and hoisin to the mix once all the liquid is evaporated.  Serve with Oriental Dipping Sauce.

This easy-to-make, slightly spicy appetizer went over pretty well with my Bunco group. I served more of the Thai peanut sauce on the side to give it a little more zest.

YUM!  I added a little fresh cilantro and some cole slaw to the mix.  Saved some of the peanut sauce and thinned it out for dipping.  Also used the recipes on allrecipes for sweet and sour sauce and oriental dipping sauce.  Used the leftover cole slaw mix and made a Chinese cole slaw.  They were a big hit!  I made another batch later in the week because people ate them so fast I only got to try one!  Make extras and save them for yourself because there won't be leftovers ;)

These are great!  I used ground turkey to cut back on fat and it worked fine.  Just before filling the cups I added about 1 cup of chopped salted peanuts to the meat mixture to boost the the peanut flavor and they tasted really good.

This recipe was great!... even with ground turkey. No need to bother with a muffin pan.  I just spooned the mixture on to square won ton wraps, wet the edges with water, and sealed up corner to corner.  This way it is a little more dipping friendly. If you don't have peanut sauce, hoisn works great too.  Also, spray the pan and tops of snacks with cooking spray for a nice crispy outside.

Wonderful filling! Do not try to leave out the Thai peanut sauce, it makes the recipe.  Melt some butter and brush it on the wonton wrappers before you lay them in the pan, just one side is fine.  This will make the wrapper a better consistancy once cooked.

Used ground turkey instead of pork, and only used a little more than a pound. Will still need to increase vegetables next time, as I prefer a higher vege to meat ratio, will try the cabbage other reviewers suggest. They crisped up nicely and were popular. I love the fact that they aren't fried!

Made these for a dinner party & they were a huge hit. Couldn't find wonton wrap so used filo dough from the freezer section. Still delicious! Found out afterwards that wonton wraps are next to Tofu in the fresh vegi section, who would have thought? Will make again for sure!

The filling was delicious but I was disappointed with the way my won ton wrappers came out.  They were not as crispy as I thought they would be and they were kind of starchy-tasting.

These were really yummy.  I like the idea of adding the cabbage slaw to the mixture and will try that next time.  I omitted the peanut sauce as well and subsituted soy - deelicious!  I did freeze the leftover mixture and re-used at a later date - worked out really well.  Will definately make these agian!

These were great!  Took more prep time.  But, really easy to put together.  Really good and a big hit.  I'm going to try and make them in advance.  I think if you make the stuffing part ahead, you could freeze it and then put them together when needed.  Outstanding!

I loved this recipe and so did all of my guests at my annual Christmas Party for "girls only" (ages 12-95) in my family. I wanted to keep the menu light because of all of the goodies around this time of year.  We had an oriental chicken salad and I wanted an appetizer that wasnt fried, and these were perfect, I did not add the peanut sauce, I only added soy sauce for flavor and they turned out great, I did add about 2 cups of packaged coleslaw mix and next time will add more veggies and less meat.  I served them with the Oriental Dipping Sauce and sweet & sour sauce recipes I found on this site.  They were a huge hit, I will be using this recipe again and look forward to experimenting with other fillings.

Square wonton wrappers are definitely prettier. I stirred in Pad Thai sauce with the ground pork & onions. In the oven for 12 min.. Then for you Filipinos out there- a dab of Mang Tomas sauce after they come out of the oven!

This has really good flavor.  My grocery store did not have won ton wrappers so I bought egg roll wrappers.  I cut them in quarters, spooned the mixture in the center, moistened the edges with water & folded the corners to the center. The water is kind of like glue, it makes it all stick together.  I sprayed my cookie sheet with canola oil and after putting them all on I sprayed the tops of the won tons.  Also, I only used 1 pound of hot pork sausage instead of 2 and added shredded cabbage mix to the chopped vegetables.  Definitely drain the grease before adding vegetables.  Good with or without the dipping sauce.  Would make again.

These were good, really good.  The ingredients were perfect, it was the sauce that held me back from 5 stars... I used House of Tsang Peanut sauce which is a nice spicy flavor, but I don't like spicy.  So I think that I can use this recipe and play with different sauces - but everyone seemed to enjoy these, especially the fact that they're baked and not fried.  Nice.

I thought these were pretty good, I loved the flavor the peanut sauce gave it (I used the Thai Peanut Butter Sauce from this site) but I wasn't crazy about the texture of the won ton wrappers baked.  I think next time I will deep fry them...I know that isn't the healthiest way too cook, but we will see if it improves the texture or not.  Oh yeah, instead of using all those veggies I just bought a coleslaw mix and used it, tasted wonderful!

Great change of pace for an appetizer!! I only used 1# of pork - but then added napa cabbage, ginger and pea pods to the veggies. After the liquid cooked off, I added only 1/4c. of the peanut sauce and 1/4c. of oyster sauce and a few splashes of teriyaki as well. Hubby wanted to eat them all himself! Thanks Denise!

I made these for a party and added 2 cups coleslaw mix to ingredients. They were a big hit and I was asked to hand out the recipe. Good job Denise!!

I've made these twice now and they were a huge hit each time.  I left out the water chestnuts (simply because I don't care for them) and nobody seemed to miss them.  The assembly is actually pretty fun, thus the high "kid friendly" rating.

Bf wasn't sold on these, but I liked them.  A  tad time consuming, but a good alternative to frying stuff wontons.  I hate frying so I prefer baking whenever possible.  I made my own Peanut Sauce with the Peanut Sauce I recipe on here.  I did find them a bit difficult to put in the muffin pan until I figured out I could pinch together two ends and it went a lot easier from there.  Thanks for the recipe!

For added taste (and reduced health) seal the filling inside the wonton wrapper, as if making a wonton, and then lightly deep-fry (about 15-30sec). These are always a hit at parties.

I had to use over a cup of the thai peanut sauce in order to taste it. The filling freezes very well for later parties, then you just fill the shells and bake. The filling makes a lot so I froze for more than one occasion.

It seems these meat/other ingredients ratio is mixed up.  I used 1 lb super lean ground pork and made 40 appetizers.  These seemed to be a hit.  I used non-stick cooking spray over the top before baking and it made them nice and crispy.  served with sweet and sour sauce and extra peanut sauce for dipping.

These were overall good however I added more seasoning salt, garlic salt and pepper. Also, I ended up cooking these about 10 minutes longer because the wonton skins were still soggy.

This recipe was really good. Everyone liked it at my party. Because I had a lot of other things to prepare, I used a bag of broccoli coleslaw instead of chopping up all the veggies myself. I also used ground turkey instead of pork, and lots more peanut sauce than the recipe called for. But it turned out excellently.

These were fantastic and a big hit!  I added more of the Thai peanut sauce to the mixture and mixed 2 parts of the sauce w/1 part soy sauce and drizzled a little over each cup when it came out of the over.  Yummmm!

I made these for a girls night and they were a hit!  I didn't have water chestnuts or peanut sauce, but substituted black bean sauce and a little soy, and added mushrooms to the minced veggies.  mmmmm :)

We really like these snacks.  The filling can be prepared ahead of time, so it is an easy no fuss snack/appetizer.  I make them with meat loaf mix (ground pork, veal and beef combination).  I brown the meat (with some salt and pepper) first, remove to a strainer and drain the fat first.  Then I sautee the minced vegetables and mix back in the meat when they are tender.  I lightly spray the wonton skins with olive oil Pam, before assembling. I fill the cups with a mini ice cream type scoop that I use for cookie dough (fast and easy).

Everyone loves these! Bags of broccoli slaw make great filling after a few seconds in the food processor. The peanut sauce is the secret ingredient.

These were ok but not as good as I hoped they would be. They were missing something... maybe some soy sauce or hoisin sauce. I might make them again but play around with the ingredients. Thanks anyway.

This was awesome! After reading the reviews, and looking at the amount that 2 pounds of sausage would make, I halved the entire recipe, with the exception of the peanut sauce, and I actually used 3/4 cup. It still made 48 snacks! I used reduced fat sausage and made everything the night before, stuffing the wrappers right before everyone arrived. They were a complete hit! I will certainly make again!

I added some fresh ginger, sugar and sherry to taste, because the meat mixture seemed a little too dry, even after the peanut sauce. That gave it a little more of the potsticker flavor I expected.

I've made these a couple of times and they are always a hit. I use Best Peanut Sauce from this site  instead of store bought (I use schezwan sauce in that recipe instead of hot sauce). Highly recommend both recipes.

Excellent!  Usually when I try to make an Asian dish, they never work out.  This came out perfect and delicious.  I'm sure the original is delicious, but I did make a couple of changes.  Left out water chestnuts, only used 1 pound of mild pork sausage and added some chopped cole slaw mix per other reviewers' suggestions.  Served with duck sauce for dipping.  Absolutely out of this world.  I can't wait to make this for a party.  It's just me and the hubby today and they are disappearing at an alarming rate every time one of us walks through the kitchen.

Think the recipe was supposed to be pork sausage perhaps, as I found this very dry.  I added some ginger to it and some sherry to add some flavor as well as threw in some shrimp when I didn't like it with jsut pork, but ground pork was dry and dind't taste very good.

Although the flavor of the meat mixture was very good, we all thought that this needed a dipping sauce and baking the wontons made them very crunchy and dry.  I would try deep frying these next time.

Very Good!!! I used the square wonton wrappers and cut them in 1/2, and overlapped the top so it was crunchy.  The taste is very mellow and not overpowering...perfect appetizer for an oriental meal.

I have made this recipe about 6 times and everyone that tries them ask for the recipe. I do however use only 1 pound of pork and I use square wonton wrappers (they are easier to separate).  I have also found that different brands of peanut sauce make a big difference in the taste, just find one you like and stick with it.  LOVE IT!
