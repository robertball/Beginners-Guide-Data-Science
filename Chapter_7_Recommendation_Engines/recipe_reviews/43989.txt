This recipe makes a LOT of slaw! I thought we could enjoy it over the next few days, but it got very watery and limp after just a few hours in the fridge.  Okay recipe, but I guess we're just not huge fans at my house.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY TASTY, THO I DID CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR A LITTLE BIT AND ADDED A FEW SPLASHES OF VINEGAR.

I made this for a ladies' luncheon.  No one commented on it or wanted the recipe, I think because it's just basic coleslaw, only a little sweeter.  It could use a little more flavor, like celery seeds perhaps.

Excellent Recipe, and no vinegar or pinneapple juice or any other weird flavor... I liked it because you can really taste the cabbage.  I prefer this recipe made with 1/4 mayo and 1/4 miracle whip, with all miracle whip it's way too sweet... I also add pepper...   Great stuff!

I LOVE sweet slaw from KFC and had looked everywhere for a recipe.  I've found it!!!  The only change to the recipe was that I added vinegar for that tanginess.  PERFECT!!!!

I scaled this down to 4 servings and used a pre-made coleslaw bag of cabbage & carrots.  I should have noted the other reviews regarding being so sweet but I didn't because I generally love a sweeter slaw.  This however was almost candy-sweet.  I definitely like the ease of the recipe though and will probably try again with a lot less sugar added.

I always use this when I need slaw in a hurry. sometimes I go crazy and add some fresh ground pepper and sea salt to it. If I really wanna go nuts then I'll add a teaspoon of mustard, oh yea and PLEASE cut the sugar only needs about 1-2 tbsp but a 1/2 cup is way to much

I mixed in a little milk and cider vinegar with the mayo (Helmann's) don't use Miracle Whip. I also added a little bit of finely minced green onion and a pinch of celery seed. It's like potatoe salad...It's always better the next day!

Make this a 5 star recipe by adding 1/4 cup red wine vinegar to the sugar and mayo and whip with wire whisk before tossing with the cabbage and carrots.

It was very sweet so maybe only adding half the suger and more mayo would be better.

Great coleslaw dressing. We love the sweet style. I buy bagged coleslaw mix and chop it finer in the food processor. Simple and delicious!

Very good coleslaw, just the way we like it.  I wouldn't recommend adding or taking away a thing! Dont fuss it up, this is one of those recipes where simpler is better. If you are looking for a non sweet slaw, this one is NOT for you!

This is the way we like our coleslaw with the following additions:  For ease I buy the pre-shredded cabbage w/carrots.  Add milk to the Mayo for a lighter consistency, a diced onion and only two teaspoons of sugar.  I also add several slices of bacon, cooked and cut into small pieces.  When everything is mixed together I sprinkle the top with paprika.  After chilling for several hours the flavors blend so well.  Everyone that I have served this to always asked for the recipe and can't believe it was so easy to put together.

Normally, I like coleslaw almost any way you can fix it.  But.... this was over the top way too sweet.  All you taste is sugar.  I even tried to modify it a little to get away from the sugary taste, but nothing helped it.  It was edible , but barely.  I won't be making it this way again.

WAY too sweet and no vinegar or acid to counter balance the flavor.   We did not like this at all.

Good start, simple & easy: great after 2 modifications-I gave it 3 & a half stars.
I followed other suggestions- cut mayo & sugar in half. Almost perfect, but a bit bland.
Added a touch of distilled white vinegar & perfecto!! Great even after couple days!!
Thanks for sharing. A definate keeper!!

The key to this recipe is to use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  It makes a sweet and sour taste.  It's also good to add a little celery seed.  My mother used to make a cooked slaw dressing and this recipe (using miracle whip) is very similar to it.  I wouldn't like it with mayonnaise.  I do think you need to use sugar to YOUR  taste.  PS  I'm 73 years young and like things cooked the "old"  way but with modern convenience.

All this recipe is missing is white vinegar balanced to taste with the sugar and little chunks of tomatoes.

This is the typical slaw you'll find in most of the south.  We usually add a little salt to it around here.  And we usually add more mayo than this recipe calls for.  It's a good, cheap side dish.

I have been using this recipe for years. I use less sugar (1/4 c.)instead of 1/2 c.of sugar.You can use splenda instead of sugar. I also add salt & pepper to taste and sometimes add chopped green bell pepper & celery seed to add different flavors. It is a very basic and good recipe...the only thing is that it does not keep well.

My 84 yr old Dad wanted slaw for the Memorial Day cookout so I wanted to make it special. This recipe seemed like what we had when I was a kid.  I used 1/4 cup Miracle Whip and 1/4 cup mayonnaise, "somewhat less than" 1/2 cup sugar, perhaps 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar, 1 cupped handful of celery seeds, and one package of Dole preshredded cabbage and carrot mix.  Both my Dad and my husband declared it excellent so I guess I'll be making it again.

I like Kentucky Fried Chicken's sweet cole slaw, so this is what I was looking for.  I browsed a similar recipe on this site and it had lots of ingredients.  It tempted me to add salt and pepper, plus a splash of vinegar and a splash of milk.  In retrospect, I wish I'd just kept it simple and left it without the extra liquid.  I will keep the salt and pepper though for next time.  It did seem too sugary at first, but let it sit for a while, then test it.  It did create a bit of "juice" after sitting.  Fine with me though; just like the restaurant's.  Sometime when I'm feeling healthy, I will try it with Splenda.  I think it would be very good.  I used a bag of preshredded slaw mix and can't wait to use this again for a SUPER QUICK, CHEAP and HEALTHY side this summer, no oven needed.  I think we'll try it on top of pork burgers - YUM!  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making cole slaw and it came out very well! I used a review's suggestion and used 1/4 cup salad dressing and 1/4 cup mayonnaise, instead of the full 1/2 cup mayonnaise. I also used a little bit of lemon juice and white and black peppers. Turned out fine, will use this recipe again!

This was my first attempt at cole slaw and it was extrememly easy to make.  I would reccomen this for beginners.  I thought that it was way too sweet, although that may have been because I sustituted sugar for splenda.  I guess it does say sweet in the title.  I would also reccomend adding pepper and maybe some red onion to balance out the flavor.

a little too sweet for me, so I dressed it up with some sour cream, red wine vinegar and some celery seed.  So I guess it's not the same recipe anymore?  It still gave me a good "base" to work with.

It is delicious if you like sweetness in slaw. I thought it was delicious for what it is--SWEET slaw. If I didn't care for sweet, I would search for another recipe. The sheer simplicity of this slaw recipe is what attracted me most. Thanks so much to its creator. I would love to publish all of my grandmother's recipes (of course, I will have to get them from my mother first). Her delicious recipes should immortalize her (perhaps you felt the same way about posting this). Grandmas knew how to cook! Perhaps yours, as well as mine, were cooks prior to refrigeration and even preserved foods by themselves--they knew everything about cooking and everything was fresh (of course... I'm referring to my great grandparents). GREAT JOB!!!

This recipe is easy and WONDERFUL!  I had tried a buttermilk recipe on here and it was okay, but definitely lacking something.  I think the tanginess the vinegar gives is really delicious.  I did add about a teaspoon of celery seed, but that was the only thing I changed.  Enjoy!!

Very simple and tastes great.  I use a 12 oz bag of pre-shredded broccoli slaw mix and add some celery seeds to the dressing.  This version definitely needs to sit for a few hours to let the dressing soak into the veggies.

Good just what I wanted.  I'll probably decrease the sugar next time as my hubby said it was a little too sweet.

This is the easiest and most economical recipe for slaw I've ever found. I used a bag of tricolor shredded cabbage mix instead of the cabbage and carrots called for. Super simple, foolproof recipe for great coleslaw. I thought it could use a little less sugar, but no one commented about it being "sweet", which it indeed is. Not my favorite, but certainly great as it is, and worth 5 stars just for the simplicity. Thanks Patty, my family gobbled this up!

This was really good! We used 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar.  It was a little soupy, though. This recipe has a lot of potential, too. I could easily see adding some coconut or raisins or celery or crushed pinapple, etc.

Very good. I did replace a head of cabbage with a bag of coleslaw mix with carrots and put in a splash of vinegar. I found that I also needed more mayonnaise to moisten it sufficiently, but cut down on the sugar. Easy recipe when pressed for time.

It tastes almost like my grandmother’s slaw. I added a tablespoon of white vinegar and some celery seed and made it my own. Came together quickly with a food processor.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my favorite recipe except I add a tablespoon of vegetable oil and sprinkle in celery seed as you would do if adding a heavy sprinkle of pepper, believe me both add just what it is that's missing.

Love it. I use a mayonnaise with lemon flavour and that takes away some of the sweetness.
