My mother cut this out of a newspaper in Maine at least 30 years ago and always made it. It was always a family favorite. After her death and the death of my daughter who she had given it to, I thought we'd lost if forever. Lo and behold it, I found it in my daughter's cookbook.It is a wonderful recipe to use up your leftover turkey or one could use chicken.

Also by using broad egg noodles,rather than spaghetti you get a better flavour and texture.

Love this recipe. It is nearly identical, minus some cheese, to one I have been using for years. I got it out of a magazine, one Thankgiving, to use for turkey leftovers. My nephew saw the recipe and asked me to make it. It takes a little time to chop and mix everything, but even the kids really liked it despite the green peppers and pimentos.

I used a can of turkey gravy instead of the mushroom soup.  I also added a small can of mushrooms.

I substituted chopped broccoli as i didn't have bell pepper.   Added a bit extra cheese, few flakes of red pepper, and 8oz of chicken stock.  
   I think next time I'll also add two cans of cream of something soup for creamier texture.   Hubby loved it!

This was delicious!  I used egg noodles in place of spaghetti noodles, and I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom.  I called it “Turkeggi”??.   My brother said he actually liked it better with the egg noodles.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of celery and I didn't have any pimentos either but it was very good!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was just ok, something a little different to use up leftover turkey. I did add a can of sliced mushrooms, and garlic and onion powders for a little more flavor.   Might make again. Thanks for submitting your recipe.
