OMG, this is sooo good and easy. I don't always have bacon but I think it would be good with any meat, might have to use vegetable or olive oil for the "drippings."

The only difference I did to this receipt was to use part of the flavor packet when fixing the noodles in the water.  I also added bell pepper with the onions and sauted them with a bit of olive oil.  It was delicious. I will make this again!
