I give the smoothie as is 4 stars.  I think the peach yogurt makes the peach flavor too strong.  I recommend using vanilla yogurt and real peaches.  Frozen or fresh is fine. I prefer to have fresh bananas and kiwi and the rest of the fruit frozen so the drink is thicker.  My family loves this, and my kids love it too, and are more apt to eat it when I freeze them into popsicle's.

I did not have peach yogurt, so I used low fat vanilla. I didn't need the ice cubes either as I used a frozen banana.  Kids gulped it down.

This is a a favorite of ours, though it is a little 'seedy'. I have tried different variations of this, leaving out the kiwi or strawberries. We like this alot, and it is our favorite fruit smoothie combination from this site. I love all of the Vit. C in this.

Thick and creamy smoothie!  The recipe turned out great.  This is a healthy recipe with no added sugar.  It is filling enough to replace a meal.  I stayed full for about 4.5 hours after drinking two servings of the smoothie.  It is grainy because of the kiwi and strawberry seeds, but I liked the added texture.  The smoothie was creamy, but thin enough to drink through a standard size straw.  I will probably make this again for my family.

I love this smoothie! Perfect! Blueberries, kiwi and strawberries are some of the healthiest foods ever! Combined with the other ingredients, this is one healthy, delicious meal! I drank my first one for breakfast before going trailriding for the day and I was super-charged! I didn't have time for lunch and I felt fine until dinner. I don't suggest anyone skip a meal, ever, but this is full of great, feel good things and it tastes like your indulging on a sinful no-no! No doubt about it, a KEEPER! I want this everyday!

Very good! I froze my fruit and subbed a peach for the kiwi. I also had to use vanilla yogurt as I didn't have any peach yogurt on hand. However, this turned out to be delicious, a really nice combination of flavors.

I didn't have kiwi and my ratio of blueberries and strawberres were flipped because I didn't have many strawberries left. I used frozen fruits and omitted the ice. I had to add a little more OJ to get it to blend. I also added wheat germ and honey. This is the best recipe I've tried and I've been trying a different smoothie recipe everyday for the past 2 months. I can't wait to try the exact recipe when I get the fruits on hand.

Out of necessity, using what I had in the fridge, I used pomegranate juice and strawberry yogurt instead of the orange juice and peach yogurt – happy substitutions, as both made the flavor of this smoothie incredibly bold and the color vibrant. This recipe, as evidenced by the reviews, is endlessly versatile; a good thing, since it works for our individual preferences and whatever fruits, juices or yogurts we have on hand.  One thing is for sure – smoothies are always better if you can think ahead and freeze the fruit.

Extremely refreshing with a nicely tiny hint of tartness from the kiwi/OJ combo.  We all loved it!

I followed the recipe, with the exception of only using 6oz of peach yogurt, stupid mother won't listen.  It was absolutely wonderful. The orange juice defined the drink with a slightly tart taste, and while I'm not crazy about all the seeds from the strawberries and kiwi, the crunchiness they add is apart of the intoxicating whole. I love how it reminds me of jamba juice!!  I want to use this recipe as a base for other smoothies. I'll try substituting the orange juice for half orange half cranberry or half lemonade. Peach yogurt works really well, I'll keep it for now. And let's substitute out the kiwi for pineapple once.

I totally changed the recipe, but this was my inspiration so I give it five stars. :) I wanted to make more like 1½ servings (for my three-year old and myself) so I used: 1 banana, 4 good-sized strawberries, maybe ½ cup or so of apple-blueberry-grape juice, and 5 ice cubes. I pureed the fruit with the juice in my Magic Bullet cup and then I added the ice and blended it until smooth. It's great! Next time, I'll try the complete recipe, but I used what we had for a quick treat. Thanks for sharing, HEJEANS!

This was great; my kids loved it.  Had to substitute vanilla yogurt for peach, and OJ/Pineapple juice for just OJ; came out great.

I have tried this, and especially being out all day when it's been hot and humid. It's a refreshing treat for me and my family. I found that adding even different berries into it, really makes it pop and be really colorful at times. We've done raspberrys, and blueberries together, and that was just awesome!! I am glad I found this recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

Wanted something quick and lite before heading out to the gym this morning and this hit the spot. Left out the kiwi (allergies) and it was still delicious, refreshing and obviously very healthy. Thank you!

The best smoothie I've tasted in a while. I made some for the whole family, and everybody loved it, including my very picky brother. My father doesn't usually like to eat or drink a lot of sweet things, but after trying this, he drank much more. It was a bit seedy, but I was fine with that. My brother thought that it wasn't sweet enough, so I added half a teaspoon of sugar,  but I don't think it would have mattered to me either way. Great recipe! I'll definitely make it again.

Well, this smoothie was very easy to make, and had a good flavor, although next time I will strain the seeds out of it and maybe add some sugar or honey to sweeten it up a bit.

This was a wonderful treat!  The only thing that I would suggest is adding a touch of honey to make it less bitter.  It may have been the strawberries we used because they weren't fully ripe yet, but overall the smoothie was amazing!!

These smoothies are fantastic!  It's our favorite one to date. My husband says it isn't sweet enough, but what does he know- lol.  Everyone else raves at how refreshing they are. I wouldn't change a thing!

I didn't have a kiwi, so I put a whole banana for a 2 serving and 2 more strawberries. Also, I didn't have peach yogurt so substituted for vanilla as well and it still was delish! I'm gonna make it next time with the kiwi.

Very good blend of flavors. I chop and freeze all of my fruit ahead of time so I didn't end up needing all of the ice.

Did not have blueberries to use (& they are expensive where I live) & used Chobani's strawberry organic greek yogurt.  Made with kiwi & without.  Kiwi added a tart zing to it & I think I prefer the smoothie without it.  Overall easy to make & healthy breakfast/lunch.

good - but i'd probably leave the ice cubes out and just use juice cubes... but for me it doesn't really matter b/c I use smoothie recipes and turn them into healthy delicious popsicles for a simple treat for my almost 2 year old :-)

This recipe.... was healthy, if I may say. It didn't exactly quite fit the taste I was looking for, and the picture made it look a bit too good. One time, I tried a drink, sort of like this, at Casey's in Canada (anyone ever heard of it?). The smoothie had guaranteed lots and lots of protein and to be overall healthy. Anyways, too many blueberry skin pieces, and I dont think the peach yogurt improved the taste that much. However, I adore smoothies and I've had experience with bad ones. If its base really was to be healthy, this drink.. not so bad! The family members didn't LOVE it, however we all finished our glasses without hesitation.

Thanks for the mango idea, I too was out of orange juice.  I used fresh mango and was the star of the breakfast table making it hard to be humble the remainder of the day.  

For friends, who eat no refined sugar, I prepared it without the ice and froze the result; it served as a refreshing, attractive dessert.  Thanks for making me look good HEJEAN.

I liked the strawberries and blueberries, but in future I would leave out the kiwi and banana, or at least make sure they are very ripe. A little too seedy and had a slight bitter aftertaste.

I always have frozen fruit on hand, so my bananas, and blueberries were frozen.  I also put frozen mango, I omitted the ice for that reason, and increased the juice (I used peach).  I also put a bit of wheat germ in.  (I ground it up to a fine powder in my coffee bean grinder!)  It was a great addition to my children's post hockey supper!

I used frozen strawberries, fresh blueberries, kiwi, skim milk instead of the oj, peach yogurt and threw in half an orange. Maybe because it is not the best time of the year to buy fresh fruit, but I was not impressed. Sorry.

I make smoothies all the time, and I liked this one. I usually use Greek yogurt rather than regular—it's creamier and just adds a little something special to my drinks, especially the honey flavor.

This smoothie is wonderful! I subbed raspberries for the kiwi, but I think with the OJ and yogurt you could interchange the other fruits just fine and still have a delicious drink. Thanks for sharing!

I make a similar smoothie - 1/2 c soy yogurt, 1 scoop protein, 1 tbs flax seed meal, no OJ. People commented that it is seedy - I think that is because they don't puree it long enough. I also have used fresh raspberries and blackberries. The combinations are endless.

We substituted vanilla fat-free yogurt for the peach, but otherwise, follow the recipe exactly.  I LOVE this smoothie!  It has such a perfect balance of flavors.  I've tried the other smoothie recipes from this site and this one is, by far, my favorite!

I took out the yogurt, and it still tasted great. I also added a splash of apple juice. And I made it decorative: i put some kiwi on the outside of the glass. Overall: Great Recipe.

This smoothie was very refreshing and pretty tasty! I made a few changes: used a bag of frozen mixed berries, added protein powder, a bit of honey, used plain yogurt, and omitted the other fruit.

Delicious!! Usually I don't like tart smoothies, but this was just right. I would suggest adding one more 1/2 cup of ice, to make it colder and thicker. 
(who wants a thin smoothie?)

I really liked this recipe, but I used Minute Maid watermelon juice, vanilla yogurt and no kiwi (just because I didn't have one).  It's tart tasting.  That's how I like it.

I just made this, omitting the kiwi, ice, peach yogurt and orange juice. Instead I added a banana, peach cranberry juice, 6 oz honey Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp of sour cream, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla to the strawberries and blueberries.  It was absolute perfection!

This was a very good smoothie. I removed some of the seeds in the kiwi, used a whole orange instead of orange juice and added one tbs. of honey just to fit my own personal taste. Everyone thought it was very yummy!

Excellent.  The yogurt contributes a smooth, creamy texture.  I used a frozen berry mix instead of fresh berries.

great taste but not enough protein to count as a meal. I added a scoup of organic whey protein powder. i also made sure all  fruit was frozen....this makes it more like a milkshake.

I had a pkg of frozen mixed berries ( raspberries, blueberries and blackberries) so used that with the banana, peach yogurt and orange juice. Also added about 1/3 cup Fiber One cereal.  Delicious!  It helps to use low-carb yogurt and reduced-sugar orange juice when you are diabetic like me. Update: I tried this with strawberries, banana, vanilla yogurt and oj.  Just as delicious.  When I get some kiwi and blueberries I will try as written.

I didn't try this yet, but it sounds absolutely refreshing.  I think when I make it, I am going to run it through a strainer to get most of the seeds out.  I think that way it won't be so grainy and will taste better!

I made this with my girl scout troop as part of a cooking badge. The girl who was supposed to bring the blueberries didn't show up! So we had to do without. I used two bananas to help sweeten it up a bit. The girls loved it and most came back for thirds!

Yummy!  If you are lucky enough to have these ingredients on hand, this is worth a try.  I used frozen blueberries and strawberries so I didn't need as much ice.

Great consistency, I liked the seedy gritty texture from the berries.  It was really yummy!  I changed the ingredients up a bit by adding banana instead of kiwi and adding blackberries & respberies as well.  But will keep trying different combo's.  Very good!  A new breakfast must have.

This is one delish smoothie.  My 3 children enjoyed it.  The tartness is refreshing and a little seedy due to the kiwi and berries.  I wouldn't leave anything out, the combo is great.  I used fresh kiwi and frozen fruit(even bananas)so only added 1/2 cup ice.  Nice and creamy.  A keeper in our household!

It was a little tart so I added a little sugar. Also I doubled the ice because it was a little thin. All in all this is a great tasting smoothie. You will not be disappointed.,

I didn't have peach yogurt so I substituted with plain 2% Fage.  I did have frozen peaches so I used those.  I didn't have Kiwi.  I also added a scoop of protein powder and a tablespoon of Flax Seed.  It was creamy and sweet.

Great smoothie. I made some changes to mines by using frozen fruits instead, so I didn't need ice cubes.

I'm not a big fan of this smoothie, I feel that there's simply too much happening. The flavors don't really mix and there are a lot of seeds.

A great base which you can EASILY modify. I used vanilla yogurt instead of peach and frozen mango instead of the blueberries and kiwi.

I didn't have any kiwi, so I used ~3/4 cup of blueberries. I also didn't have peach yogurt, so I used fat free vanilla.  I ALSO didn't have any orange juice, so I used almond milk, and I added a scoop of vanilla flavored protein powder.  Oh, and I didn't use any ice (or frozen fruit) since I was making it ahead - and it is DELICIOUS!!!  Obviously a flexible recipe that can be played around with!

Family of 6 loving this! Everyone from the picky DH to the picky teenager to our toddlers enjoyed this morning treat. Will for sure make again. Used frozen bananas, so skipped the ice cubes. Opted for vanilla yogurt instead of peach, mainly because I had vanilla in the fridge and we are not fans of peach ;)

This is a really good smoothie.  The variation of fruit and berries mixed with orange juice gives it a very unique flavor that is quite nice.  I added sugar to the mix just in case it was bitter, but it was not necessary.  It is just a good without it.  My husband and I agree that this is a keeper.

This was pretty good, but a little sweeter than I liked.  I altered it the next time...so I guess it is almost a new recipe, but along the same lines.. 1 cup plain nonfat yogurt, 1/4 frozen pineapple, 1/4 frozen raspberries, 1/4 frozen blackberries, 3/4 frozen strawberries, 1/4 cup frozen blueberries and either a 1/2 large or 1 small banana and 1/4 cup OJ.  I also added ice.  It made one big smoothie as a meal.

I really liked this but I didn't think the kiwi fruit contributed much to the flavor, and, really, any yogurt would do. Thanks!

Grrrrrreat!  Unfortunately I had to do a lot of substituting....I thought I had enough strawberries but it turned out most went bad.  I had the blueberry filling used to add to yogurt, but still needed more.  Luckily I had strawberry and blueberry drinkable-yogurt though.  I added about 1/2 of a small bottle of each and then I did not add any more yogurt as called for.  I didn't have OJ, but I did have lemon juice which turned out fine probably because of the sweetness of the yogurts and I didn't add a full 1/2 cup as called for.  No kiwi either, but dash of honey.  I really had to tweek it a lot, but it turned out great.  I look forward to making it when I have all of the proper ingredients!

Will definitely make again! I used frozen strawberries (defrosted in the microwave for about 1 min.), added honey and wheat germ (hubby did not like the texture of that, but I didn't mind it). It is VERY seedy, but that didn't bother me so much. Didn't have peach yogurt, so I just used plain, which worked out fine.
