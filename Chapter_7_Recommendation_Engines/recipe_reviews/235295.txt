Excellent- i followed instructions except i roasted the squash on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for 1 hour to make the skin peel off and then let the cooked squash simmer with the chicken broth mixture for about 10-15 mins.  It was smooth, velvety, and with just the right start of sweetness and finish of spice.  Definitely will make again.

So delicious! This is a rich, savory, and decadent soup with a hint of sweet. This tastes like it was simmered long and low in order to develop such depth, yet it is so simple. There are layers of flavor that will first tease your palate with delicious savory notes that make you go mmmmm as soon as it hits your taste buds. Next, you discover the wonderful sweet undertone of the honey, making it even more interesting. Lastly, you feel the heat of the cayenne as it warms the back of your palate, but not overwhelmingly so. Perfectly balanced and wonderful. This is the kind of soup you will think about and desire long after it has been eaten up. I didn't change a single ingredient and thought it was perfect. This is going in my recipe box! Helpful hint: Use an immersion blender right in the pot to puree the soup. Save yourself the hassle and risk of burning your hands by trying to use a conventional blender. An immersion blender will soon become one of your favorite kitchen gadgets (ranks right up there with my Kitchen Aid stand mixer).

We love this soup.  I did put a little less garlic in it - instead of
half and half, I used Greek yogurt and instead of the honey, I used
agave. Also used low-sodium chicken stock and added no salt. Perfect with cornbread!

This was absolutely delicious! I subbed coconut milk for half & half so I could have a dairy-free option. It was wonderful the first night and the leftovers were even better the next day!

This soup is wonderful! I roasted the squash first rather than simmering it in the broth and I used a can of coconut milk in place of the half and half, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I've made it a few times and tried slight variations, it's great with either honey or maple syrup to sweeten it and I actually prefer it with vegetable broth rather than chicken broth.  I also reduce the cayenne as a personal preference, I can't handle much heat and a 1/4 tsp was a little spicy for me.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have half and half so I substituted coconut milk, unsweetened, and it worked great. This is very good and you can adjust the heat to your liking.

Delicious, flavourful squash soup with the perfect amount of heat! I used 5% cream instead of half and half, put a dallop of yogurt, some parsley and a few of the roasted seeds on top. The soup is a thinner squash soup. Next time I think I will roast the squash first!

The soup that keeps on giving...Had an extra sweet potato and added it in. It was excellent. With the sweet potato added it was thick but still very good. After a couple of days added the leftover soup to a left over chili we had to make a completely different and also delicious dish.That was also excellent. Again too much left over and used the soup/chili mix as a spaghetti sauce ...wow... the soup that keeps on giving

Excellent! We also roasted the squash first and added 1/2 cup coconut milk in place of half and half at the end and it really amped up the flavour of the squash and curry.

I thought this was wonderful. My husband and boys enjoyed it too.  I will definitely be making this again! Changes: I baked the squash in the oven (whole, uncut squash 400 degrees for 90 minutes) before starting the soup since I didn't want to mess with peeling and cutting a hard squash. I ended up mashing the baked squash with a potato masher as I added it to the soup pot, instead of pureeing it.(I  wanted to keep some texture.) Also, I halved the cayenne pepper as one of the boys has a low spice tolerance. We didn't try the sour cream. It was delicious!

This recipe is delicious. Only thing I did different was microwave the squash for 10 minutes to soften it and make it easier to peel. Great recipe.

This was so delicious!  I roasted the squash for 90 mins at 400 as that was easier.  Just wash and put it on a cookie sheet without chopping it up.  Once baked it is easy to peel the skin off or scoop out the innards.

I made this once and loved the flavors, but I must try something different with the consistency. Since I can't really eat much dairy, due to being lactose intolerant ; I wasn't sure what to use as an alternative. I tried 1/2 cup of greek yogurt. It came out too soupy. May I should have used more yogurt or tried something different. However, I forgot to use my diary free sour cream for a more  creamy texture. If it weren't so soupy it would be perfect. The cayenne pepper and curry is the best part about the flavor .

Wow! Very easy to make and made people think I'm a better cook than I really am. I served it with grilled Muenster/Wisconsin sharp on rye. Great meal for a brisk 1st day of November.

Amazing taste and consistency.  I didn't change a thing with ingredients or amounts.  The only thing I changed with method was to  cook the squash first in the oven (rinsed, whole and at 400 degrees for 90 minutes).

I peel my butternut squash with a potato peeler, to expedite the process of removing the hard shell (as opposed to the bake it till it peels off method). I followed the recipe, except added 1/2 a can of coconut milk to the last part of the process, per another reviewers suggestion. Very good recipe, thanks!

I did change things a bit - approximately doubled the amount of squash and baked the whole squash at 400F for 1 hour.  Peeled, seeded and then cubed. Added extra cayenne and ginger powder.  Also omitted the honey, half and half, and sour cream.  Even my husband, who generally hates butternut squash soup, loved it

This soup was absolutely delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception...I roasted the squash in the oven the day before.  Easier and made it simple to make for a weeknight supper.  It was flavorful with just the right amount of heat to balance out the sweet.  We will definitely make this again.

Full disclosure:  I changed this slightly, by roasting the squash first and using almond milk and vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  That said, this is clearly a good recipe and adaptable!  I am sure it is just as nice as prepared according to the ingredients in the original.

I'm in love!  I had a craving for butternut squash soup and decided to try this different from traditional squash soup.  Delish!  Like others, I roasted my squash first since I was baking today anyways.  Other than that and using an immersion blender to smooth, I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out amazing.  Next time, I might add a touch less cayenne pepper, but that's just to appease the tender palette in my house.  My only real complaint is that my intention to freeze the left overs is going unmet.  If my hubby had been home too, we'd have finished the whole pot ourselves.  I know to make a double batch next time.  Thanks Marci Stohon for the recipe!

This is superb soup!  I haven't made butternut squash soup before but this was decadent.  My significant other loved it so much, he had seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly and will do it again many times. This is a soup I intend to have regularly as long as I can get my hands on butternut squash. The cumin, cayenne pepper and curry powder gave it a very nice kick and paired nicely with the half and half and the honey.  By the Way it was no big deal to peel the squash - came right off with ease but I used a larger than average peeler so that helped. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Love this recipe.  Easy and delicious.  My husband and I 
like the recipe as written.  My one-year-old enjoys it without the cayenne pepper,  and a little extra half & half and honey.  

I took the advice from another comment and roasted the squash for 1 hour at 425 degrees.  This worked well!

Delicious!  A little too much curry for me, but I definitely will make it again.  Thank you.

This is a heartwarming soup!  The flavours all blend well together. Made the same suggestions as others, in that I pre-cooked the squash at 400 for an hour so that the squash scooped away easily. (or to update I really cheat now.  I buy frozen diced uncooked butternut squash.  Just toss it in!  Saves a TON of time)  For personal preference, I cut the curry powder down to 1 tsp and the cayenne to 1/8 tsp.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Topped with sour cream for some extra creaminess, but also enjoyed without.

I've already made it 2 times this week (double recipe last night)! Even my adventurous grand kids liked it and both suggested that it would be good over rice.  I'm having baked ham and company tonight and I will try their suggestion to serve it over jasmine rice. I plan on using the leftover soup and simmer to thicken a little.  I'll garnish it with 1 or 2 of the following--cilantro,  toasted pumpkin seeds, toasted coconut, sesame seeds or green onions.

Absolutely delish. I used whole cream rather than half and half, chopped a banana pepper and included it with the onion and garlic and garnished with a bit of fresh cilantro. I'm glad I made a double batch, as we now have leftovers.

Yummie! We really enjoy this soup.  I've already made it three times.  So easy to make.  I even had all the ingredients in the house, that never happens.  This soup has a great flavor with a slight kick.

Very easy. I actually roasted the butternut squash the day before (so I didn't have to deal with peeling) and just added it with the stock until it was warm. As other reviewers, I used nonfat greek yogurt instead of half-and-half (since I never have that on hand). Also, tasted before adding honey and sour cream, it didn't need either. Very good basic, simple recipe.

Very rich tasting considering I didn't roast the squash. Will probably cut down on the spice/heat a little bit next time,  but not by much. I substituted the heavy cream and sour cream with 3/4 cups of Skyr (Icelandic yogurt) which only has 2.5 g of fat but 20 g of protein.

I made this soup and it was wonderful.  I didn't add the 1/2 t salt as I thought the broth was enough salt.  I topped it with goat cheese, toasted chopped almonds and pomegranates.  I had about a cup of left over wild rice so I added them before serving.  Would definitely make this again.

I made it and added 1C more broth (because I didn't think the 2-1 ration of broth to pounds of squash was enough), 1t more curry (because I LOVE curry) and no honey.  I wouldn't recommend the changes.  The extra broth made it a little more thin than I liked and the extra curry made it more spicy and curry tasting than I liked and you reallyl need a little sweetness with this recipe, so the honey is probably a good idea.  I did add honey to the soup when I served it and it was fine.  Easy and tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a roasted squash, which worked out fine. Otherwise, I'll be making this again!  Perfect for a cold winter day!  Just be careful not to put in too much cayenne...

The soup was  a creamy fresh texture. The addition of sour cream, for me, gave it a big pop. I made it just as  written. Why not 5 star, is a personal taste, i would omit or only use 1 garlic clove. The delicate flavor of squash  does not need the garlic. Spices however were a perfect combination of flavors. I will make the soup again. Thank you.

I’ve always wanted to make homemade squash soup and this recipe hits all the right notes. Spicy, sweet and smooth. I took the advice of another reviewer and roasted the squash prior to mixing with onion and garlic. It turned out wonderful. Will make again.

I’ve made this probably 20 times, it’s delicious! The salt seemed to be a bit much considering the fact it already had the salt from the stock, so I only use half of what it calls for. I like to use olive or avocado oil instead of butter and opt for coconut milk instead of cream. Lastly, I found frozen butternut chunks at a big box warehouse and use them instead of going through the effort of cleaning and cutting fresh. SO EASY! Hands down my favourite soup to make, so rich and warming.

My husband gave this an AAAA++++++ rating. Didn’t have half and half so used whipping cream so buttery and creamy. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for a group dinner and everyone raved about it.  It really was delicious. I also roasted the squash and used all coconut milk .Will definitely make it again.

Stuck with the recipe and made no changes with naan on the side. We've made this quite a few times now and it's always incredible we will never get tired of this one.

I roasted the squash in the oven for an hour at 350 along with  a couple of sweet potatoes that were in the cupboard, onion, celery and carrot and garlic.  I peeled the squash after roasting and through it in the slow cooker along with everything else for 4 hours.  I added fat free greek yogurt instead of the half and half.  Uber delish....

Good flavor! Loved the way the kitchen smelled while making this. Really easy to make! I like the amount of spice, but my family thought it was a bit too much. I will definitely be making this again but will probably play with the amount of Curry and Cayenne.

I made this soup as written with only minor changes. Instead of adding the spices along with the broth, I added them first to the cooked onion and garlic and sautéed them a bit before adding the broth. This usually bring out the flavors of the spices more.  I also added a little more curry and cumin then called for. The only other change was that I used fat free Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I tasted the soup before serving and felt it was slightly bland so I added a bit more salt and another tsp of honey. Overall it was a good recipe but a bit bland as written this the 4 stars vs 5. Oh and it took way more than 15 minutes for the squash to be soft enough to purée. I think I cooked it for at least 30 or more minutes.

I just made this yesterday and we all loved it! I added 3 cups low sodium chicken broth and 1 cup apple cider, omitting the honey. These are just changes I made just for fun. Great recipe without any changes! Thanks for sharing!!

So yummy and simple.  I roasted butternut squash with butter and maple syrup for Thanksgiving and it turned out gross.  Dry and mealy.  It was this leftover squash I used in this recipe.  I used coconut oil for the oil and a can of light coconut milk instead of the half and half.

This is a great recipe! I roasted my butternut squash on 350 for 45 minutes, then peeled and cubed.  Then I added it in the recipe where it calls for it but I brought it to a boil and then turned off the heat. I also reduced the salt by half because I like to play it safe. Well, I am glad I did because it is perfect! This is a spicy recipe so if you do not like it so hot, play it safe and add half of what it calls for with the cayenne powder. Delicious soup and great for a chilly day!

This recipe was delicious. I have to admit that I forgot to add the cream and honey and it was still creamy and had a kick to it. I would imagine the half and half would have taken that down a notch but it was completely devoured by my husband and myself. Making it again!

Any curry that my husband gets seconds on is a win in my book. I doubled the spice mix and subbed pepper in lieu of salt the 2nd time. Next time I make it I'll leave off the honey since it's already a sweet veg.

garam masala works just as well as curry, just make sure the spice quantities are respected for a less spicy/intense version. ginger works well here too

This is very, very good! I made two minor changes: I oven-roasted the squash and doubled the honey. I also doubled the recipe because I could tell it was going to be a winner! I froze some and hope it survives. Yummy!

This recipe was amazing. I personally am not a soup lover but this was an amazing dish that I will absolutely make again! I did change the amounts a little bit and I didn’t add honey or sour cream and I replaced the half and half with milk. I also added zucchini because I didn’t have enough squash. But the taste was great!

Left out the honey, subbed nonfat plain Greek yogurt for the cream, and used Thai curry powder. Yummy. Garnished with light sour cream and sunflower seeds.

Absolutely perfect.  I have made this several times and it always turns out perfect. I have upped it to 3 tsp curry powder and have also tried brown sugar instead of honey (when I had none) and I also like a dash of cinnamon in it.

I stayed pretty close to the recipe, but cut back just a little on the cream.  Toasted nuts also make a great topping for serving.  I put all the soup in small freezer containers and keep one in fridge to warm up a quick bowl for lunch.  Nothing like hot soup on a cold day.  This is one of my favorites.

Delicious! I used kobocha squash and yam in lieu of butternut squah. I had no half-and-half, so I used yoghurt. It curdled immediately and I thought I'd ruined the recipe but after blending it was fine. You could probably cut the dairy out completely if desired.

This is my all time favorite butternut squash soup!!  The only thing that I do different is bake the squash — it’s much easier to peel and cut up.

Modified just a wee bit to get the sugar content down. Used chicken stick instead of half and half and no honey. Did put in a little bit more curry to spice it up. Great comfort food on a snowy day.

This was delicious! I “hid” a head of cauliflower I had on hand in the recipe as well and it was amazing! I doubled the curry, maybe personal preference or to compensate for the cauliflower, not sure. I didn’t have sour cream or cream, so just added goat cheese and croutons at the end and it was fabulous! Made it in the instant pot for speed and it was a hit! Will make again.

The only thing I did to this recipe was add more curry, salt and cumin to suit my taste and used an immersion blender to mix the ingredients.   This is a dinner party and family gathering worthy recipe.  Loved it.

I omitted a few ingredients (butter, onion, honey) and added WAY more spice (3 T curry powder, 1 T Garam Masala, 1 T Cumin, 1 t Cinnamon), but this is a very good base recipe that you can change up to your liking!

This was the BEST butternut squash soup I have ever made!! The only change was adding a bit more cayenne pepper. My husband loved it!

This soup is great! I love butternut squash soup, but it can easily be a little bland. This recipe makes a soup that is full of rich flavor. The curry is perfect with it.

I always use Maple Syrup for sweetener. Also scoop out those squash seeds... season with curry salt and sugar and use to top the soup for a yummy crunchy texture change.

Love this soup! It easily converts to vegan by subbing  olive oil for butter, veggie stock rather than chicken broth, and unsweetened coconut milk for half & half, as well as for finish rather than sour cream. I get extra flavor by roasting until peel looks almost burnt and use the deep brown carmelized juice scraped from the foil. For variety, use acorn squash or better yet Kabocha squash and/or roast a few beets along with the squash. Immersion blender makes it super easy. Chickpeas at very end make it a little more hearty. Excellent recipe - thanks!

Awesome soup recipe!   I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and used 2c pureed butternut since i grow butternut and have lots of it in my freezer.  I only used 1/8 tsp cayenne and it was perfect to my taste.  The only thing that didn't  work was using lite sour cream which is what I had on hand.  When i tried to stir  it in, it didnt dissolve but rather turned into lots of little white floating islands in my otherwise very nice soup! 
The regular sour cream that the recipe calls for may work just fine.    Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This soup is delicious! It's almost got a sweet and spicy kick because of the honey and chili flakes (I subbed these for cayenne because I had none). I also took the advice of others and used my pulse handmixer directly in the pot instead of a blender. Use it in short pulses and it works perfectly!
I also simmered for 20 minutes so it would be nice and tender before blending. Lastly, I think this makes more like 5-6 servings.

Amazing! Made it twice and the second time served it as a sauce over roasted vegetables, chicken and rice as a delicious Indian dish. Sprinkled some cilantro on top. One of my guests even said it was the best meal she had ever had!  Next time I think I will sub in coconut milk for the half and half just to change it up a bit.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: I used vegetable broth so it would be vegetarian-friendly, and I used an immersion blender instead of pouring it into a blender. Everything worked perfectly, except cooking the onions was closer to an hour instead of the stated 15 minutes.

Wonderful flavor & nice consistency (not too thick).    I used half the amount of Cayenne & it was perfect. Roasted the Butternut seeds to use as a garnish...looked good and added a nice crunch and flavor.  This could easily be made dairy free using soy or coconut milk.  Loved it & will definitely make it again!

I used this as a base recipe and made some changes due to what I had available. I did not have smoked paprika so I used regular. I just used one large clove of garlic.. not 4 . I used maple syrup instead of honey...and I blended a chunk of cream cheese into in instead of sour cream dollup. I baked my squash instead of boiling it... Turned out fantastic and I plan to make this again and again !

This was incredibly good.  The first time I made it I peeled and chopped the squash, rather tedious.  This time I just put it in the pressure cooker for 12 minutes, scooped the squash out and proceeded with the recipe - much easier.  I cut the amount of cayenne in half and it still was fairly spicy.  An emulsion blender made it even easier at the end.

My daughter-in-law is gluten and dairy free so I made this with coconut milk and it turned out really awesome!  I also peeled, cut and cooked the butternut squash a couple days before I found this recipe so just had to warm and puree it with the onion, garlic, and broth.  The spices and honey were a perfect compliment to the squash.

This was fantastic! My first attempt at a squash soup - always was hesitant. This is so easy and yummy!

I changed it up a bit, but am sure just as is is PERFECT!  i added about 1 Tablespoon of Chipotle powder, and instead of honey used a part black strap molasses and part maple syrup (better mineral content?!).  

To make it pretty I drizzled a tiny bit of leftover cream over the top after placing it in individual bowls.  Chopped chives would add some more interest too?! Or fresh sage leaves...

This is so look good! it's very rich tasting, so a little goes a long way. I'd serve just a small bowl as a side , definitely not as the main course. It's sweet and mousse=like in consistency.

Way too much onion. I love onion, but it over powers the squash. Will half the amount of onion and double the amount of honey.

I used coconut milk instead of cream and added a couple of slices of crisp bacon. 

The  result was fabulous. The soup has lots of flavour and heat without being too spicy. I will definitely  make this again and again.

Quick and yummy! A great fall dish. The second time I made it I bought puréed butternut squash in a can and it saved me a bunch of time. Dried ghost peppers add a little fuller flavor than the cayenne pepper, but you have to use a little less for the same spice.

Really good and easy! I used leftover roasted butternut squash, and cut the recipe in half but left seasonings the same because I like it spicy! Didn't get out the power tools because it was just me, so just used the potato masher with great results. Didn't have sour cream but didn't miss it, don't care for the taste of half-and-half so used milk, also used veg broth. Taking some to work for lunch today! Thank you for sharing.

I bought a pre-peeled squash, so this recipe was very easy- made exactly according to instructions. But next time I'll use vegetable broth so vegetarians can enjoy too! I also might add a touch of cinnamon.

I changed the s recipe quite a bit so some people will not approve of my rating. I made this vegan so I sauted the onions and garlic is vegie soup stock and I used veggie stock and coconut milk instead of cream. I roasted the squash first and added a bit of extra cayenne. It was delicious. I hope I can duplicate it.

This was really good. I didn't have squash so I subbed two 15 oz cans of pumpkin and it worked great. I didn't even bother to puree it (I want an immersion blender!!!) and it was still good. Garnished with sour cream and cilantro.

This version was perfect. For those that don’t like squash, you would never know it was made from butternut squash. The flavor was a nice blend of spice that reminded you of Indian food. Leftovers were even ore awesome to the pallet. Highly recommend!

My husband and I really enjoy this rich and spicy soup on a cold night.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used coconut milk instead.  I also substituted the sour cream with Greek yogurt.  The soup goes very well with a turkey sandwich: a delicious meal.

I can definitely see myself making this again, however, it came out to liquidity for me. I didn't have a large squash to begin with and used the same measurements as if it was large, so that might be the reason why it wasn't thick enough. But overall, I loved the flavor!

My husband and I love this soup. I make it with my immersion blender to avoid blender cleanup. I substitute coconut milk for the half and half but keep everything  else the same. This time, I served over coconut Jasmine rice with fresh green beans and roasted potatoes. It is a huge hit as soup or as part of a curry bowl.

I used hot curry powder and microwaved the squash for 8 minutes for easier pealing. I wasn't sure about sour cream on top but it made it better.

This soup was tasty on its own, but I garnished it with Thai toasted coconut chips from Aldi and it was so yummy, yummy, yummy. This is what the bag looks like.

I’m very happy this turned out so well because when I told my family I was making Curried Squash Soup I’m surprised there wasn’t a stampede for the back door by the looks on everyone’s faces. Now I get to where a smug face. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out very well! The curry and cayenne pepper blended so well together it hid, somewhat, the taste of squash. The soup had a nice warm spiciness and creaminess to it. I will definitely be making this again. And it’s very easy to make!

It was excellent! I followed the instructions but I cut the squash across  in 4 inches pieces using a potato peeler for easy peeling. This soup was so good that I couldn't  stop eating it. I passed the recipe to my family and friends and they loved it!

This was absolutely delicious! I read the other reviews, so I steamed the squash to save time and used coconut milk instead of 1/2-and/1/2 to eliminate the dairy. I measured the spices exactly as directed. The taste is delicious and different, without crossing the line into "too weird" for my conservative eaters.

Best of the best! Made 2 minor changes: used another type of winter squash along with butternut and I roasted the squash until tender before adding to broth mixture. Creamy, thick and filling. Better the second day!  And, the honey is Essential. I’ll make this again.

One of the few squash soups I like. Sometimes we’ll add a sweet potato and a little extra of the other (non squash) ingredients. Gives it a more attractive orange color because we’re aesthetic AF.

This soup is everything I hoped for. I used veggie stock and roasted the squash first but the recipe itself makes incredible flavors happen. I did go a bit heavy on the cayenne and wife thought was too spicy but it was fantastic for my tastes. Awesome awesome awesome. Cant wait to try it with pumpkin!

Not a big soup person, but definitely enjoyed it.  Made some of the alteration others mentioned. Also, only had a 1lb squash, so used some leftover sweet potato and pumpkin to bulk it up.

Excellent!  I only used 1/2 tspn of salt. I added some sauteed chicken breast chunks after pureeing.  I used 2% lactose free milk instead of half-and-half.  Pureed using an immersion blender.

AWESOME!  My only change was to first roast squash. Cut into 3/4" pieces, drizzle w/olive oil, sprinkle w/kosher salt and roast in 425 degree oven for 30 min or until fork tender. Add to broth mix. This brings out a nice flavor.

Great recipe. Nice balance of flavors. I did use some suggestions in previous reviews. I roasted the squash for an hour at 400 degrees and I used an immersion blender to puree the soup. Both suggestions made this recipe very easy. The soup does come out a little sweet so my next batch I will halve the honey. I do love this tasty recipe!

Even better if you roast the squash first, add a piece of fresh ginger to the simmer, and use coconut milk instead of creams. This recipe is perfect for immersion blenders.

I made butternut squash soup last winter and hubby didn't care much for it. I made this one and he loved it! I used a jar of curry simmering sauce that I got on sale. We topped the soup with croutons and shredded cheddar cheese...it was delicious! I'd give it 5 stars, but prepping the squash is very time consuming!

Absolutely yummy!!!! Followed recipe as written except did not have cayenne pepper so substituted pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Also roasted squash in the oven skin side down with a little butter instead of cooking on the stove.
Took very little time to make a delicious meal served with warm crusty bread. Will definitely make this again!

A nice comfort-food-like  soup with a little kick. Great for dinner on a cool fall evening. I’ve made this several times now, with butternut squash, with half butternut half acorn, with Cinderella pumpkin, with buttercup squash... doesn’t matter... it’s always great. I always substitute 2% milk for the half n half and I either leave the salt out or cut it in half.  This soup is quite thin, so I use more squash to make it thicker. The recipe is quite spicy as written, so, depending on how much extra squash you use, an increase in the spices may not be needed. And lastly, Shrimp is a wonderful addition to this soup: just add frozen raw shrimp during the last 5 minutes of cooking, fish it out when it’s done (opaque, white), before puréeing the soup, and add it to the serving bowls before ladling the soup in. Yum!

OMG this was good! My entire family (non-vegetable eating child included) loved it. I don't think I'll make a different squash soup ever again.  Just a couple of small changes...  I roasted the squash first, and I also doubled the amount of squash so it was a bit thicker. (Squash is such a good price at the grocery stores now with it being fall :) The spices were absolutely the ticket just as written!!  After tasting it, just before I added the honey, I thought it was absolutely perfect the way it was, and I was surprised to find that it did have a nice sweetness to it already (possibly because of the caramelization that happened when I baked the halves of squash face-down on the baking sheet). We tried it with and without the sour cream and, although it was very nice with the sour cream, we all loved the flavour of the soup so much we didn't want to mask it with the sour cream. YUM... try this recipe -- you won't be disappointed!

This soup is wonderful just as it is written! I always try to make a new recipe as is without changing the whole thing. Afterwards, I decide whether to make any changes for the next time. For my family, the only thing I would change next time would be to decrease the cayenne to 1/8 tsp.  This is a great way to use the squash from the garden!

This was exactly what I was hoping for in a butternut squash soup!  It was delish, sweet with a hint of heat.  Only thing I did was roast the squash first as someone else had previous suggested.  Will definitely be making this one again!

And, not to be a "one-upsman-er"....but, just to "beef it up" a bit, I threw in a big can of pre-cooked chicpeas, the niblets shaved off a cob of corn and a can of mushroom soup. (And with all these sources of 'natural' salt, I left out the teaspoon of salt. (Even for this salt-aholic, there was plenty!)
I was also gonna throw in some BBQ'd Cauliflower.....but it was getting late and the soup was smelling too good already!
YUMMMMMMM!
DEFinitely make again. :-)

This was an absolutely delicious soup.  I made a couple of changes to make the recipe a bit more heart-healthy: substituted evaporated skim milk for the half and half and used plain yogurt rather than sour cream.  I also cut the amount of cayenne pepper a little.  I can't imagine it being more delicious!  Will be making this again....soon.

Too spicy for the kids, adults thought it was good but on the hot side. When using Penzey's cayenne pepper, use 1/2 the amount. 

Used one less cup of broth than called for - don't like really runny soups.

Paired with naan was excellent.

So good! I added crumbled bacon and made an apple cider cream sauce:

1/2 cup apple cider, boiled until reduced by half, then cooled. Add 2/3 cup sour cream.

Such goodness! So smooth with just the right amount of heat. Adding cayenne and cumin really amp up the curry flavor. I use coconut milk for creaminess. I cook the squash in my instant pot -- halve it, scoop out the seeds, high pressure for 12 minutes -- and it spoons right out of the skin, no peeling required. This has become a staple at my house.

I did modify it for two reasons..One..there are only 2 of us.  Second, I am used to using curry and that ws not enough for the recipe.  I use a Sweet Curry powder ..  I didn't have a squash, but a 10 ounce package of frozen cooked butternut squash.  I halved the recipe and after the garlic and onions were ready, I put the block of cooked squash in, 2 cups of brother,  and used a tablespoon of curry power.  When I added the half and half and honey at the end, I also dropped in about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese, and then used the hand whizzer to mix everything,  The entire pot of soup was eaten..  My husband decided just as I was getting things going he wanted a carrot in it, so we diced up a carrot..and that also worked.

This recipe is divine! I did roast my squash whole with the skin on, halved, brushed with olive oil, cut side down on cookie sheet at 400° for about an hour. I then scooped it out and adds to soup. I also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. But, the recipe as is, is still wonderful. Roasting the squash deepens the,flavor. I will make this again and again.

Instead of the honey I added (1) diced apple to the mixture while boiling and cut squash in pieces with 1 inch of water and placed in microwave to soften for 5 minutes.  Very good recipe and can be varied in so many ways for certain diets, thank you for posting!

Very good, though I did add a few ingredients.  I used less chopped onion and sautéed it with one finely chopped celery and one finely chopped carrot.  I had also roasted my squash in advance.  The combination of spice was perfect, making an excellent soup!

This is the best soup I have ever ever had! The only thing I would change is the the amount of salt added. It is better to add the salt to taste in your bowl than to put too much salt in the batch.

I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 things.  I roasted the butternut squash first as suggested by some other reviewers.    I also roasted a small spaghetti squash and added it as "noodles" to the soup after it had been pureed.   The spaghetti squash noodles added some interesting texture to  this wonderful cream soup.

Holy. Cow. This is amazing. I made per the recipe, but tested before I added cream and honey. This could easily be made vegetarian or vegan.

The toppings on the soup make it look very appetizing, yet the recipe doesn't mention any apart from the sour cream. 

Accidentally left a few chunks in it which everyone liked - adds texture. A bit on the spicy side.

OK, this is the first curry I have ever tasted. Wanted a recipe that incorporated something   with which we were familiar .
So Good, so Easy.  Cant wait to make it again. Thanks for a warming - in every way - soup for a cold night and for one that got me rave reviews from the rest of the family. Great recipe The only change I made was to use coconut milk instead of the half and half which I did not have on hand.

I would give this a 3 and a halve. the wife and sister-in law loved this. I have to make it for bird day. the hint to cut in half and remove seeds and roast in oven along with some seeds is a winner! edit: I gotta give this a 4 star, I still think it's bland....but everyone else loves it.

This is a REALLY good butternut squash soup.  It has just the right amount of spices - nothing overpowering - to make the taste great.  I used 1% milk instead of half and half.  I also used an immersion blender to purée and it turned out great.  With a crispy baguette and a side salad, this is the perfect autumn dinner.

This is a great soup. My wife loves it and so did I. Added chicken once and added some cooked brown rice another time. Great as is, or with added hardy goodness. Super easy and great flavor.

This is one of the best soups I've ever tasted! I love curry and spicy so this was perfect.  I microwaved the squash and used a wand blender, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent marinade.  You cannot walk away from the grill.  the high oil content causes it to actually allow the steak to catch fire.  I have never seen this before.

What a beautiful sweet puree.   I think I added too much cayenne pepper though because I just eye-balled it instead of measuring.  It had quite a kick to it.  When I make this again, and I will, I'll be more accurate with the cayenne pepper. 
It's not a quick soup to make.  It takes time to peel and chop everything.  But the end result is a sweet  sweet melody of harvest.

Definitely a keeper! My sister gave me a butternut squash but my hubby and kids aren't fans. Which allowed me to look for a recipe that I didn't have to take into account anyone else's preferences. So glad I found this. Only made 2 exceptions to make it a little healthier - used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the honey. The natural sweetness of the squash was perfect and adding honey would have made it too sweet for my taste.

Made exactly as directed, except that I didn't add the salt as my broth was salted.  Awesome soup!  This goes on my favorites list!

Have made it several times.  I put in extra curry, cumin, and cayenne, since our family loves spicy things.  

My mom needs extra protein due to health concerns.  I blend in Bob's Red Mill Whey protein powder (unflavored) to give it some added nutrition and calories for her...about 2 Tbls per 1 1/2 cup serving.  It doesn't change the flavor and makes it a little creamier.

To save on calories, the half and half and honey can be left out, and it is still awesome!  This is a great soup!!!

I followed the recipe closely except that I chose to roast the butternut squash at 375 degrees F before adding to soup. The bonus was that I cut the squash in 6 pieces and took out seeds but waited until it was cooked to add to soup.  Pureed to silky texture.  Used a larger butternut squash so was so thick I added a can of coconut milk instead of the cream.   Heavenly.

I liked this soup very much I used a can of coconut milk instead of cream or sour cream didn't use cayenne , I did add two potatoes and some cauliflower the honey really helps to blend the flavours. I use low sodium chicken broth and I never add salt.

This soup is absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe :) We followed the directions exactly and ate all of it in one sitting! Next time will try coconut milk as other reviewers have suggested. This one is crazy good!

Perfect amount of curry  Honey is perfect amount of sweet, not overpowering like many  recipes that call for apples.  Will be my go to recipe!

Great soup! Only had vegetable stock available but that was just fine. Used 2 parts milk + 1 part cream instead of the half and half. For colour (and a bit of freshness) I floated slices of radish in the soup. Looking forward to eating the leftovers...

I was concerned about the heat some people complained of, so I cut the cayenne in half. There was no need. The actual 1/4 tsp would've made it better, with just enough heat for me. My daughter thought this tasted like tortilla soup. I guess the cumin, cayenne, and curry made it have that similar flavor. I thought it was excellent, and I'll be making it again. We didn't garnish with sour cream; instead we used cilantro leaves, which I thought went perfectly with this soup.
Update: I've made it twice more. This time I added a pinch of nutmeg, and I subbed celery salt for half of the salt. Tried the sour cream garnish, which went well. But I still think cilantro makes it awesome!

This soup is OUTSTANDING!!!  Took the advice of another reviewer and baked the squash for an hour at 400 degrees.

My only change was I used plain Greek yogurt instead of the half and half..    This soup is truly a taste sensation.  We look forward to making again very soon..

Perfect simple, cozy soup. I used all the same ingredients, but took a shortcut using my Vitamix. (Half batch, not sure full would fit!) Chopped small squash in half and cooked in microwave. Softened onions, garlic in butter on the stovetop, added spices and stock, brought to boil. Scooped out squash and combined all ingredients in the Vitamix. Done in 15-20. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the taste of this soup, but it was too thin for my tastes.  I think I would use at least half again as much squash, if not double.  In fact, I made extra squash so I could puree some for baby food, and I think maybe I'll add some more to my soup first!  Other than that, it was very tasty.

This is a soup I make on a very regular basis.  It is SO delicious!  The only difference for me is that I don't put half & half in it.  Maybe I will swirl a little sour cream in it once in a while, but it is so good even without the added calories.  Just brilliant.

This recipe was excellent; my wife said it was the best she ever had and she loves butternut squash soup!  I followed the recipe except I roasted the cut-up pieces of squash in the oven the day before  to bring out the flavour more.  I only used 2 cloves of garlic, sweet curry powder rather than hot, and I omitted the cayenne because I didn't want it to be too spicy.  Will probably add it back in next time.  I used fat-free half and half.  Came out great; it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! I used cream cheese instead of sour cream but it would be great either way.  As I was eating it I realized that I forgot the honey, but it was already so sweet I didn't miss it.  I also roasted the squash first for extra flavor.  This recipe will be a regular for me! Also, an immersion blender works just fine rather than transferring to a countertop blender.

FABULOUS! My only regret is that I had already eaten by the time I finished making this...it was so darn tasty that I wanted to keep slurping spoonfuls of it, but I was already full from my earlier dinner! I made as directed - may try coconut milk as some mentioned, and will likely stir in chicken and use plain greek yogurt vs. sour cream just for the protein. Seriously love how simple and flavorful this is...I'm going out to stock up on curry and cumin!!

I made it exactly as listed in the recipe, but used frozen butternut squash. I boiled frozen butternut squash to soft drained and then added to butter and onion mixture. Was definitely spicy I might use a little less cayenne next time, but it was excellent even still.  . I topped mine with a little cilantro.

This is one of the best soups I've ever tasted. I used acorn and spaghetti squash oven roasted with a little olive oil & pepper. I only used 1/2  the chicken broth  & left out the cream. It was awesome. I only made changes to accommodate my ingredients on hand. I'm sure the recipe is excellent as written.

1 minute into peeling my first butternut squash, I was sure I would never subject myself to doing it a second time, but this recipe is truly inspired.  I will definitely make this again.  The blend of spices is perfection actualized.

This soup has become a family favorite.  We use a little less cayenne  pepper which is more to our taste and sometimes use vegetable broth and milk rather than half and half but it always comes out great. It is easy to alter to your personal tastes.

I added a cup of chopped carrots and a 1/4 teaspoon of marjoram leaves to the recipe but didn't add the honey. I followed the suggestion of another used who said to roast the squash ahead of time at 400 degrees for 50 minutes. I added a smidge more cayenne pepper to the soup and it turned out quite spicy, in a good way!

This is so delicious and so easy to make! I have always found butternut squash soup a bit boring and it turns out all it needed was a little curry and spice! My whole family loved it. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple of stalks of celery when I was cooking the onion and garlic. I'm making it again for Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow night. Thanks for sharing this one!

Loved this soup! Soooo good on a cold day. The flavors are terrific together, although I will decrease the cayenne to 1/8 tsp next time -- it's a little much. The only things I changed were: microwaving the squash in a shallow dish of water for 8 minutes to cook it, adding 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and using an immersion blender to mix.

I roasted quartered squash on a baking sheet at 350 for 75 minutes, cooled, then peeled, cubed and added as directed.  Used an immersion blender - so much easier than transferring to a separate blender.  I had 5 times as much squash and accidentally added almost double the cumin I should have, but was still delicious!  Loved the combination of spices.  I topped with roasted pumpkin seeds.

This recipe is delicious!! Sweet and heat. To make it extra gratifying,  I substituted whipping cream for the half and half. Love the texture. I cook the halved squash insides down on a cookie sheet with water in the bottom for 40 minutes at 375F before adding it to the pot.

Amazing recipe.  I only added some diced carrot and a little dry chardonnay.  So delish!  My husband who isn't fond of squash loved the slight heat.  I served with sour cream and toasted pumpkin pepitas.

Delicious! Some changes I made: used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. After reading another recipe, I added a peeled, baked potato, 1/2 cooked carrot slices, and 1 sliced apple (sautéed with onion and garlic). Because of the potato and apple, which added body, I omitted the half and half, saving fat and calories.

I did not use the half n half, honey, or cayenne, but added 4 cubed red potatoes and the  rinds from Parmesan cheese while boiling.  SO good, I will definitely make again, perfect on a rainy day.

Like many reviewers, I roasted the squash on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for 1 hour (cut in half, scooped out seeds and roasted with cut side down on foil covered baking sheet) before I added it to the chicken broth.  Soup turned out very flavorful.   Even my pickiest eater liked it.   I definitely will make this again.

I discovered this recipe about a month ago and have made it every Sunday since. my husband and I love having it for lunches.  depending on the size of my squash, I tend to add a little more broth and cream. I've also accidentally dumped too much cayenne in and it still tasted great (as long as you have a glass of milk handy).

Mine turned out a little thin, next time I will only cover the squash with the broth rather than measure out four cups; the liquid seemed to be a bit much in my case.  But excellent (and easy!) nevertheless!

I left out the honey, used coconut milk in place of the half-and-half and sour cream, and served with the curry on the side so it could be added to each individuals taste. It was good without the curry too.

Absolutely fantastic. I came across this recipe searching for curry dishes. I have never eaten butternut squash let alone made anything with it but I really wanted to try this based on reviews. There's nothing to say except this is amazing. I followed others advice and roasted the squash for an hour first at 400 degrees. I made two batched, one non spicy for my son. I'm addicted to spicy so I added a little extra cayenne and I did one red curry tablespoon and one yellow curry tablespoon and I also added mushrooms in with the squash only because I needed to get rid of them. Garnished with cilantro and had french bread on the side. Great.

This was my first time making butternut squash soup. It turned out absolutely perfect! I roasted the squash first like many reviewers recommended but otherwise I followed the recipe as is. The combination of seasonings created a very flavorful soup. I will be adding this recipe as one of my fall/winter staples.

I found the soup needed a little more flavouring, so I added another 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne.

I thought this turned out great.  I used probably twice as much squash as asked for because I wanted a thick soup.  I also used coconut milk instead of half and half.  I thought the curry was pretty strong - I may cut back a bit next time.  Worked great with my immersion blender!

All I can say is DELICIOUS!! We might try putting in some diced chicken and rice, as the soup tastes so much like the sauce for Chicken Tikka Masala. YUM.

Also, I substituted evaporated milk for the cream. We didn't miss the extra calories.

I didn't use any honey or other sweetner. I roasted the butternut squash in the oven at 400° for 50 minutes, cut in half and cut side down. I put the cooked squash and chicken broth and spices in the my Kitchen Aide mixer and mixed on low for 15 minutes instead of pureeing it in a food processor.

I followed what another review said which was to roast the squash at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for at least an hour. It was pretty easy to get the squash out from the skin. Other than that I followed this recipe to a tee and it is now my new favorite soup of all time. Thank you for sharing and will definitely keep this one.

This is an amazing recipe! A part of cooking is changing a recipe to your liking, it's just that easy. I peeled and chopped my squash.  When I finished the onions and garlic I added the curry and cumin. I stirred until the spices became fragrant, then I added the rest of the ingredients. I put in less cayenne for just a subtle heat. I also substituted coconut milk for the half and half. This is a keeper!

This was great.  I added coconut cream as I had no half and half.  The cayen certainly gave it a good kick so might have to cut back a little for the kids next time.  Very easy to make.

I added 1/2 spoon more of cumin because I like cumin and a a dash more of salt because I like it salty. Overall great recipe! Will make again. I'll make it in the winter. I wanted to try the recipe out first. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Amazing! I Don't even like squash but wow! I replaced the half/half with coconut milk and omitted the sour cream. I served it with LOTS of cilantro, roasted walnuts and a slice of homemade multi-grain bread...delicious!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Butternut squash is always delicious, and these spices really made it!  I did add the healthy spice Tumeric, which made it a bit spicier, and the end result was fabulous.

Great recipe! We love curry, so I do go heavier on the cumin and curry powder.  I'm not a soup person but, this soup is so good and easy, I make it a lot.

Despite the unanimously positive reviews, I was skeptical. But I'm happy to say this one lives up to the hype! I followed the recipe almost exactly, just shorting the chicken broth a bit (I had a small squash and just two cans of broth) and using whole milk instead of half-and-half, because that's what I had on hand. I was on the fence about butternut squash soup before, but not anymore. This one's delicious!

Great soup! I roasted the squash with garlic in the oven, then added it to soup mixture as others did. I also used greek yogurt as suggested (I didnt have any half and half). I also added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and added some carrots and celery (just to add some extra veggies). Easy great soup - great texture and flavor. Keeper!

This recipe is going in my arsenal of great recipes!  I only used half the amount of cayenne pepper(which was just enough to add some heat, but mellow enough for people that can't handle spicy).  I also used agave instead of honey, and added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  This soup is amazingly delicious!  Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, and added a dollop of light sour cream and a sprinkle of slivered almonds on top. It was very rich, velvety and satisfying. I would give four and a half stars if I could, as I felt the spice was a little too overpowering. Next time I will cut the curry and cumin amounts in half, and omit the salt.

I've now had two requests to MAKE THIS AGAIN from my young adult children.  Tonight we are serving it with Naan bread.  Simple, flavorful, and with a terrific flavor.  Love it.  I've made it....just as written, sometimes adding sour cream at the end...sometimes not.

Rich and comforting, this soup was a hit in my family.  The "heat" from the cayenne pepper is perfect and makes the flavor interesting, but not overwhelming.

Delicious!  There is a kick to it, so you can cut down the red pepper. BUT it is so creamy and yummy.  I used Greek yogurt as I forgot to get the half and half. Healthier and just as good!

Perfection!  This is the most amazing butternut squash soup I've ever tasted.  It has the perfect balance of spiciness and sweetness.  Make it today and don't change a thing.

This was soooo good.  We served this with coconut almond naan bread and garlic naan.  It was amazing!  This would also be a great sauce over chicken and rice, possibly with cilantro and some other veg.  Absolutely delicious.

I thought I'd give this recipe a try and hoped it would be good - but never expected it to be fabulous! I bought pre-peeled/chunked butternut squash at the supermarket to save time - otherwise followed the recipe as written. My husband loved it - it tastes as good as (or better than) any we've ever had in a restaurant. I wonder if adding chopped peeled/cored apple along with the squash would be a nice touch? Or golden raisins and a topping of toasted coconut?Or a sprinkling of toasted pumpkin seeds?  I'm thinking there are probably some wonderful variations to try although the recipe as written is pretty darn perfect. Can't wait to make it again!

Yum.  Very delicious.  I cooked it with slightly less curry powder (because I didn't know how the children would like curry).  It was sensational.

Excellent; I've made it twice now. Once cutting squash raw and the other time baking it. Everyone likes the heat and spice, I like that if we're fighting colds we can up the garlic and onion. Thanks for a delicious recipe. Doubled the recipe tonight as it was so popular.

It's awesome! I would probably use none or a lot less cayenne next time as u wa going for a sweet and savory instead of spicy. I also added a little maple syrup , chopped pecans, and put marshmallows on top and let them melt. It was awesome! I also think it would be good with cranberries on top as well!

I used coconut oil instead of butter and non-fat yogurt instead of Half and Half and sour cream (which would add a ridiculous about of fat and cholesterol)...and it was awesome, dinner crowd loved it....I snuck in a bit more curry, just because I like it...

Excellent a new family favourite. Roasted the squash and skipped the honey as the squash is a sweet one. Good without the cream. Adding the cream reduces the sweetness and makes it really delish!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written; I did not add any extras like sour cream.  Loved, loved, loved it!  The cayenne pepper did not make it "hot"..just seemed to enhance the other flavors.  This is an absolute keeper!  I did find it a bit messy transferring to my food processor, but don't want to spend money on another gadget, so I'll just use a steadier hand when transferring :)  Thank you for sharing!

Ate it out of the pot. It's the perfect mix of heat and sweet.
