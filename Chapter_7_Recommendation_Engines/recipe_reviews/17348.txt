I ALWAYS use this recipe!  the reason everyone is having problems with this icing is simple:  depends on how soft your butter is...the softer butter gives you a soft consistancy, even if u start with hard stick of butter, its easy to over mix, and it melts...also melts in a hot kitchen if you're baking a lot. You WILL have to tweek this recipe every time u make it..because of this...ALSO..if u sift the powdered sugar, it will change the ingred. slightly, so, i always add milk last, in ver small amounts to get it where i want it to be...you can also add about a tsp or so, to your liking to get a glossier icing that spreads easier...i also add more cocoa cause i fiend for chocolate, lol.  which also means more butter, more milk more sugar, to get it the consistancy i prefer.   you can also tweek it to 1/2 shortening and butter for more of a store bought taste...i also add vanilla to this recipe.  different variations..but all the same recipe in general. its just what u prefer.

I am a cake decorator,and have tried many different icings, this chocolate butter cream is by far the best I have tasted yet, creamy and not too sweet. It isn't stiff enough to make roses but this creamy milk chocolate icing makes any cake a hit.

I gave this recipe an average rating not because I was successful in making it but because it seemed like it would have been easy is if had turned out.  There is not nearly enough liquid to make this recipe work.  It would be nice to know the correct measurements.

I'm not entirely sure why the recipe only calls for 1 tsp milk -- it definitely wasn't enough.  But I just added a little more until it looked to be the right consistency.  It turned out really good; unlike many other recipes I've tried, it stayed soft for days instead of getting sort of stiff and crumbly like others do.  Overall...very pleased.

Really easy recipe - I used 1/3 cup of milk and it came out really creamy.

I gave 4 stars because I would like a buttery taste - but since my son's party is in a couple of hours this worked great!

Wonderful recipe - modified using heavy cream to make the texture what I wanted - instead of milk and the amount ended up being between 4-6 TBS probably.

I love this recipe!!!! I made 3 small changes.  I used half butter/half shorting, added 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp. salt to cut the sweetness.  It turned out so well and my kids love putting in a piping bag to decorate cupcakes!!!!

This was below average to okay as written.  Like others have said, it needs way more milk to be spreadable.  I also ended up adding almost twice as much cocoa to get a really good chocolate flavor.

Absolutely easy...great flavor...put in piping bag for cupcakes...looked professional.  Only problem, it only was enough for 12 cupcakes, so double it for the usual 24.  Super...

Now that I think about it I'm sure I added a lot more (warmed) milk as I realize by reading others' remarks there was not nearly enough for the amount of sugar.

I made this recipe to cover a chocolate cake made by my mom, only I added some vanilla flavouring.  Everyone loved it.  I found the recipe delicious, and both easy to make and economical compared to ones where you have to melt chocolate chips or squares.

This frosting tasted really good, but even though I added the icing sugar really gradually, there was not nearly enough liquid - I only ended up using about half of the icing sugar and adding more milk until it was the right consistency. I would recommend this frosting, but be ready to experiment with the milk and sugar amounts.

I think the recipe is alright but the measurements are a bit off. I used 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup butter,  1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of whipping cream and it came out excellent.

This was the recipe that came out tasting most like what my husband's grandmother's creates! :) I agree with previous posts that this icing is wayyyyy too sweet, though. Next time I would try just TWO cups of confectioners sugar to start, mix with the softened butter until smooth, then add the cocoa and milk. You do have to fiddle around a bit - not only get the taste you want, but also the consistency. All that sugar made mine way too dry with just one teaspoon of milk added, so I had to counter with more milk. To lessen the sweetness I countered with more butter & not too much additional cocoa because it was chocolate-y enough. Now I have a lifetime's supply of chocolate buttercream icing, haha. So, yeah, I would definitely recommend starting this recipe with less sugar and slowly building up from there. :)

It was okay. The flavor was pretty nice, but it was sickeningly sweet. Even my boyfriend, who likes to eat maple syrup plain, thought it was too sweet. I added more cocoa powder to mellow it out, as well as a bit more butter. I also used heavy cream, because I had a bit left over, and ended up using a fair amount more than what the recipe called for.

This was my first attempt at chocolate butter cream. I made it several times.  It is easy to make and I got a lot of compliments on it so for that I give it high marks.  However, the liquids are lacking - even if the butter is fully melted (for a creamier consistency, I prefer softened).  
My variations: Start with a Tbsp of milk instead of a tsp and keep adding a Tbsp until you get your consistency.
For an even buttery taste, increase the butter to 1 cup (2 sticks) SOFTENED.

I had to make this without a mixer and it was very thick so I had to add more butter and milk. It is the best frosting I have ever had. I just need to get a mixer for next time.

This recipe has major problems with the ingredients. As others have stated, the amount of milk required is not nearly enough. Assuming this is a typo, even 1 Tbsp. would not be enough. I used heavy cream as I had it on hand and added a splash of vanilla extract. The final product tasted good, which earns it three stars - it would be inedible without more liquid.

good recipes. I read the reviews before I made it. I just eyeballed everything and mixed up other peoples ideas. I added way more chocolate and 2  sticks of butter. Love the idea of whipping cream. I added vanilla, butter and almond extract. I piped the icing on 2o cupcakes with a bunch left over. Yea on with a fundraiser.

This is a very good recipie easy to make, but instead of using milk, I used about 2-4 TBSP of coffee, and added vanilla, and  made it a Mocha buttercream, huge hit with my teenager, and his friends. I Will be using this again.

Excellent recipie I've made for years that always comes out well! Works well for decorating too.  I usually use milk in my frosting and find I need to usually use a little more depending on  how  the cake/cupcakes will be decorated .

Good for flavor but don't try doubling the recipe. It comes out way to thick or t the consistency of cookie batter.

I made this frosting last night and I did make some very heavy changes.  I used 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup dark cocoa powder (sifted) with 2 sticks of softened butter and 2/3 cup of shortening.  I omitted the milk altogether and I must say it is one of the tastiest butter cream frostings I have ever made!  It was very easy to pipe onto yellow cupcakes and then I put them in the refridgerator to help them set.  They are rich and chocolatey without being too sweet.  I love the dark chocolate color of the frosting as well.  Thank so much for posting this recipe!
