This is relatively easy to prepare and is delicious! Very rich and better 24 hours after refrigeration.

This cake is excellent and really makes a wonderful end to any special meal. I could not find the pecan liqueur so I used frangelico (hazelnut) or a chocolate liqueur instead and it still tasted wonderful!

This was my first time making a cheesecake.  I made this for Thanksgiving and was completely surprised at how easy it was for a beginner.  It had great success as everyone loved it and was gone in two days.

This was my first cheesecake. I made it for my Valentine in a heart shaped pan. I used wax paper to flip it over. I also had some left over to make a second small cake. I could not find the pecan liqueur so used Amereto. A local liquer store did tell me they could order it but I did not have time. I'll try it next time. Very good!

This was awesome!! I was looking for something a little different to make for a family get together, and this definitely was it. I couldn't find pecan liqueur ANYWHERE so I used Cask & Cream Caramel Temptation and used Emerald pecan pie flavored pecans crunched up in the crust and in the topping.  Everyone devoured it.  Thanks for posting!!

I did not like this at all. I thought the flavor of the liquor was overwhelming. Some of my guests even choked on it, due to the strong flavor of the liquor. And the cheesecake itself just lacked in taste and flavor.

There was only a few of us for the holidays, silly to make lots of desserts.  This totally satisfied everyone's pumpkin pie and pecan pie cravings!  Plus it's cheesecake, you can't go wrong!

I made this for Father's day.  I had a little bit of trouble with the crust, but my dad and brothers loved it.  I would definitely make this again.

Update: I made it for the auction. Went for $150 & the man who bought it just called to say it's the best cheesecake he's ever had. Thank you, Mrs. Johnson!

This was my first time to make cheesecake & it was delicious. I'm not a fan of liqueurs so I substituted orange juice. Everyone loved it; my mom even asked me to make it for her church dessert auction.
