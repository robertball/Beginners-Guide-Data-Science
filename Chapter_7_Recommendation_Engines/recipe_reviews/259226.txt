I left out the peanuts and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Turned out awesome and everyone loved it.
This will definitely be made again and be a family favorite.

Might need to be in the oven a little longer than recipe calls for.  A roaster pan is great for this.

This is the best snack EVER.  No matter what event I attend, friends and family insist that I make and bring this.  I belong to a "Moms with Freshman Club" where we meet, network and make care packages for our college kids.  This packages up so well in mini ziplocks/paper bags tied with Raffia.  The nickname for this snack is now "CrackCorn" because it's soooo addictive.  I highly recommend to leave out the peanuts due to so many people having a peanut allergy.

Easy and delicious! I couldn't find an 8 oz. bag, so I used two 3.5 ounce bags, and it was fine. I also used two dark, non-stick pans to get the best crunch. I have made it in the past in glass pans, and it does not get as crunchy. I always leave out the peanuts, and I only boil it for one minute. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla. I use it for Christmas gifts. The recipe makes 3 full 1-quart zip lock bags and then about 3 extra cups.

I have now made this recipe a good half dozen times and it is THEE BEST addicting crunchy sweet with a pinch of salty treat that there is!! Made it as the recipe says (without the nuts... just because), and added 1 TB of vanilla cause I like it and baked it for just under an hour (stirring every 15-20 minutes) and OH HOLY HECK!!! YUMMMMMMOOOOOO!!!! :) And another huge plus... it takes NO time at all to whip up a batch and have it cooled enough to eat while your pan is getting washed!!

I've been making this every year for at least 20 years especially around the holidays I make it and give it as a gift everyone calls it Christmas crack because it's so addicting. I've never put peanuts in it and I add a splash of vanilla.

Made this except for the peanuts and it’s so good! Made to give to coworkers as small gifts but can’t stop eating it, might not have enough to give out!  Added the vanilla but didn’t change anything else.

Made a double batch of the caramel sauce and used 3  8-ounce bags of corn puffs instead of 2 -- plenty of topping and tasted just as fabulous! Even better, actually.

Yes, yes, yessss!!! Amazing! So buttery food. I added the optional peanuts, but I think I will leave them out next time, as we mostly went right for the puffed corn pieces. This is addictive and delicious...a keeper~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
