Can't go wrong on this as the recipe is so versatile. Great way to put something fresh and nutritious on the supper table while at the same time make use of the fresh vegetables in your refrigerator. As for the cheese, the Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano I had on hand would have worked just as well, but I stuck to the recipe and sent Hubs out for the feta.  I did change the dressing to the 3:1 ratio of olive oil to vinegar I prefer and used red wine vinegar rather than balsamic (not a fan of it). Light and fresh, delicious and pretty.  By all means, include the fresh basil if possible - it really makes a difference.

Awesome!  Everyone LOVED this salad at our BBQ tonight.  I used 1 Red Pepper, 1 Orange Pepper, a bunch of baby cucumbers, grape tomatoes, an olive medley (from the olive bar at the grocery store), and a little red onion.  Sooo good with the basil and Feta.

Great way to get your veggies! I used zucchini, green pepper, broccoli, tomato, black olives, cucumber, carrots, and mushrooms for the vegetables. I think I would have liked it better without the broccoli & possibly carrots (at least in my version, just would have blended better without them). Tasted a lot like a true Greek salad, especially with the tomato, cucumber, black olives, basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar & feta. Thank You!

FANTASTIC!!!  I used red bell pepper, broccoli, cauliflour, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, and basil.  I'll be replacing green salad for this on many dinners.  I'm sure I will be making this over and over again!!!

I made this today using garden cherry tomatoes, zucchini, seeded cucumber, bell peppers, mild hot peppers and with sweet onion from the grocery store. It was amazing! Three of us ate the entire dish in short time. What an excellent and healthy recipe for summer veggies from the garden!

This recipe is a keeper.  Simple, fast and yummy.  I followed recipe using english cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, 1/2 a zucchini and a green bell pepper.  It could have used a bit more feta cheese, but I love feta.  3 year old daughter loved it!

This was a fresh and delicious salad for using abundant August vegetables.  I didn't have olives or feta on hand, but it was still really good.  Thanks!

Great recipe with very fresh flavors.  I didn't have fresh basil so I subbed dried with great results.  I also had to use red wine vinegar instead of balsamic because that's all I had on hand.  You can use any kind of vegetables you want but you definately shouldn't sub any other cheese for the feta.  That's what makes it delish!

The vegetables I used in this salad were tomatoes, zucchini, red onion, baby bella mushrooms and red bell pepper. I did add some fresh minced garlic as well. I made this early in the morning and let it sit until I got home from work. Simple and delicious!

I could definitely tell I was eating something good for me, which is not always a good thing.  I like eating food that tastes so good you don't even think about how great it is for you.  I kept reminding myself to 'keep eating it, it's good for you'.  Hmm, probably not a keeper for me, but thanks for letting me try it.

This recipe was SOOOOO easy and yummy and a great way to please a mixed family of vegetarians, carnivores, and hungry eaters. I cheated and used bottled balsamic vinaigrette which made it even easier.

All thumbs up from my KIDS on this one!! Used tomato, cucumber, and a little onion. Also used dried basil, about 1 1/2 Tbsp, instead of the fresh basil. The feta cheese was the perfect touch.

Excellent!  Veggies I used were green & red peppers, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, red onion, mushrooms, canned artichokes and a variety of olives.  I also doubled the dressing. Best if marinated overnight.

Made this just the way the recipe is written for a large family get together, only triple everything. Got many compliments, even from the picky eaters. Oh, I did add a little asparagus. Will definitely make again.

This is so very good and easy. I used fresh zucchini, tomatoes and basil out of my garden. Red onion and kalamata olives rounded things out nicely. I didn't have feta cheese so I used fresh Mozzerella. It reminded me of a bruschetta salad. This is a fantastic salad for summer.

Excellent and easy with a little hand slicer. Really good and the little bit of left over keeps for a day in the 'frig. I can add this to other recipes for an added kick. I love things that just fall together.

Very good!  Friends & family loved it.  I used all the suggested veggies, minus the carrots, plus green bell pepper because I had 1/2 of one to use.  I also couldn't imagine this dish (any really) without garlic.. so I added some of that & doubled the balsamic.  MMM!

Excellent - very tasty.  I didn't have an Italian spice mix, so I used oregano, basil and some table shake mix.  Was very tasty!

This was really good and easy to prepare - I did double the marinade because I felt the amount called for in the recipe was not enough to properly coat the vegetables.  I did not have the Kalmatta olives, so I used green olives marinated in olive oil and garlic that I found in my store's deli section.  This added a nice flavor.  Will definately make this again.

This was so simple but so good and flavorful! I used zucchini, yellow squash, baby bella mushrooms, and tomato, and I served it with the Mediterranean Chickpea Salad I from this site. This would be great over a bed of dark leafy greens. Plus, it was delicious the next day, after the flavors had had a chance to soak in.
