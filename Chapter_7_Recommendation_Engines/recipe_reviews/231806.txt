This was very simple to make and was delicious! My family and I loved it. I made it on a rainy, cold day and invited my grandparents over and we had a little spur of the moment dinner party because my parents liked it so much.

I made exactly as written and found it very bland and way too much liquid for the amount of tortellini and veggies.   Before I served it I decided to double up on the broccoli, but that still wasn't enough to give it any kind of body.   I felt the cream of chicken soup added nothing to this recipe and definitely wouldn't use that again.   If I was to make again, I'd double up on the carrots, broccoli and tortellini for sure.   An extra cup or two of chicken wouldn't hurt either.  I would also probably cut back the water to 2 cups or less.   Pepper would be a nice addition, but I'm ok with leaving it out and letting the individuals decide on how much they want at the table.   As written, we had to salt our bowls because this was very watery.   That was disappointing especially when you look at the sodium levels already in this dish.   This soup does have elements of greatness, but I feel the proportions are way off.

As written, the recipe gets a 3 Star. But I read everyone else's comments, and made my own version. I doubled the following hacked recipe, and it filled a big stock pot. My boys loved it.

1 grocery store cooked chicken, picked clean and cut in small pieces
2 generous cups carrots sliced
2 generous cups celery not too finely sliced
1 generous cup chopped onions
1/2 a small garlic, minced fine
2 generous cups frozen peaches and cream corn
1 lbs already cleaned fresh broccoli florets (1/2 Costco bag)

1/4 tsp sage
1/2 heaping tsp basil
1/2 heaping tsp oregano
pepper freshly ground to taste
chili powder to taste

1 1/2  cartons chicken broth (sodium reduced)
500 ml (smaller carton) non dairy broccoli cream soup
4 cups water

1 kg frozen cheese tortellini (1/2 a big bag)

Sweat the celery, onions and carrots together for about 10 mins, sauteing in butter, then add garlic and cook another 2 mins or so.
Add corn and heat. Stir in spices, including some chili powder and garlic, and cook about 1 min, then stir in chicken
Add chicken broth, broccoli soup and water, and bring to a boil.
Add frozen tortellini and stir. Reduce heat to simmer. After about 20 mins, add broccoli to the soup and simmer another 10 mins or so. If the tortellini is soaking up too much liquid add some more chicken broth and maybe some more water.

Really filling, and tastes great with baked garlic bread. The tortellini will soak up the liquid, so will likely add some additional broth when we heat leftovers tomor

I changed it a bit. I added more veggies than this called for including spinach, squash, and zuccinni. I also did my seasonings differently. I do need to add more tortellini next time as I felt there wasn't enough.

This was SO bland, even after cutting the liquid ratio  back quite a bit and added extra garlic and onion powder.  It was bland, but had an overwhelming broccoli taste if that makes sense, and my family loves broccoli in all forms!  I cooked the soup according to the tortellini package, which was 6 minutes instead of 30, as they would have turned to mush in this recipes directions.  It was a waste of good ingredients - we won't make it again.

I followed the directions for liquids and seasonings and added extra vegetabless. It was a hit with the kids. I could taste a bit of the canned taste from the cream of chicken, but it was good for a quick dinner night pinch and a great variation on chicken noodle.

I used my homemade chicken broth instead of the water, so I wish I had not used the canned cream of chicken soup and just made a little roux.  Ah well, next time.  This was an easy and delicious supper that everyone enjoyed.
