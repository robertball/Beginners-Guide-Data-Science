More of a cake than a bread, but very tasty and moist. I substituted apple sauce for a cup of the oil and added an extra teaspoon or so of vanilla, then scattered brown sugar on the top as soon as it came out of the oven to let that make a topping. Next time I may try some cinnamon sugar on top.

I have made this very quick Bananna Bread several times,always adding chopped pecans or walnuts to the recipe.
Today I changed a bit and used a Devils Food cake mix, adding not only the chopped nuts but some chocolate chips, the results are even better than the orginal recipe, I believe ... 
The best of both worlds, Banana Nut Bread and Chocolate!

Use this recipe all the time.  Use a spice cake mix and it will taste exactly like banana bread only lighter & fluffier.  Only use 1 cup of oil.  Add 1 tsp of vanilla.  Chopped walnuts taste great with it too.  Finally able to make a decent banana "bread"  (actually more like cake), other recipes turned out like a heavy log.  Try this one!   Dress it up with a cream cheese frosting or serve it plain like a snack cake.

Thank you for this easy recipe! I made it in 2 loaf pans ... like banana bread! My husband, my teenage children and their friends loved it! It is definately more like cake than banana bread. Banana bread is much more dense ... the way I like it. I also only put in only 1 cup of oil and it did fine ... maybe 3/4 cup next time. I ended up baking the loafs for about 45-50 minutes. Thanks!

This is a PERFECT recipe for those times when you have a few banana around, and you know they are not going to get eaten. It's so easy to make this recipe, you will never throw another banana away! It's very rich and tasty. I can't get over how easy it is to make this, and it tastes great.

Super Quick Super Easy Super Delicious  The name (Country? Bread?) is misleading. It should be called "Quick Banana Cake".  There was NO WAY I was going to put 1 AND 1/3 cups oil into the mix. I put about 1/3 cup and that was plenty. I also added walnuts and/or pecans- about a cup to a cup and a half. Finally, I only cook the cake for 30 minutes. Before the cake has a chance to cool, it is gobbled up every time. I've made this several times now and everyone who has tried it absolutely RAVES about how good it is.   Super Easy and Everyone Will Love You! It's also delicious if you use a chocolate cake mix as the base. Yum.

This is good. I think the oil amount was an obvious mistake, so I used 1 c. water and 1/3 c. oil I also added about 1/2 c. of oat bran and 1/2 tsp. imitation rum. I put a crispy topping on of oatmeal, oat bran, butter, brown sugar, crushed almonds, and crushed banana chips. It's a fun idea for cake/bread, but the recipe should really be edited. Thanks!

AWFUL- waste of ingredients!! I was horrified right after I poured in all that oil- where was MY common sense?? WAY too much oil- I went with it- because how do you get it out after pouring it in- but it was just not right. Do NOT use all that oil- ughhhhh

This was the best Banana Bread I have ever had.  I used a spice cake mix and 1/3 cup of oil and it turned out just wonderful.  I will be making this for years to come.  Thanks

I used a boxed spice cake as suggested by another reviewer and also used 1/3 cup of oil, no water necessary! Scrumptious! Next time I will add some nuts, so much lighter than your standard banana bread recipe.

I made this recipe without adding any oil whatsoever.  It was really tasty and throwing in a handful of chocolate chips ensured it was gone right away!

I had 4 very ripe bananas and wanted to make banana bread but didn't feel like going through all the work. This recipe is good - but to give it a 4-star rating, I made a few adjustments:  2 eggs (the more eggs, the more cake-like); 1/3 cup oil (cound not imagine an add'l 1 cup, yuck); 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup ground flax seed, 1 cup toasted pecans.

I loved this recipe.   I have made it twice in 2 weeks.  I gave the recipe to my Mom who also loves it.  We did as everyone and only used 1/3 c. oil and I added about 1/4 c. of water and 4 very ripe bananas and 1 and 1/4 c of nuts.  I actually like this better than Banana Bread because it's easier and I like the taste.   It is one of our go to recipes for sure now when we want to get rid of ripe bananas or for a pot luck.

I have never made the original recipe and I read all the other reviews, so I decided to make this with a French Vanilla cake mix, 1/2 Teas. Vanilla, only 1/3 c. oil, and added choc. chips and walnuts 1 c each.  Let it cook at 350 for 45 minutes. It was great tasting !!!! Yes I would make this recipe with my changes again...

YUM!!! What a great idea. I, too, cut the oil to about 1/3 cup and added all the bananas I had on hand that were inedibly old, which was 5. It turned out moist and delicious! I also added chocolate chips to appease the chocoholic in the family and it was great. Now it's Chocolate Chip Banana Cake! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this a 4 because it was so quick and easy, but the taste wasn't that great...it was kind of bitter, so I wonder if it was the mix I used or maybe it needed a little something more, like vanilla...I'm not ruling this out though...I always have bananas and this really was simple and it turned out very moist even though I cut the oil to 1/2 cup.

I was very happy to find a quick and delicious banana bread alternative.  I first made this bread when I had sick children in the house, and needed to find a way to encourage them to eat.  I swapped 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for part of the oil.  I also added some chocolate chips.  Very easy, and very yummy and moist.  I can't wait to try this again with a spice cake mix.

I doubled this recipe to take to a church event.  I used two boxes of yellow cake mix, 1 cup of no sugar added applesauce, 1/3 cup veg oil, 6 eggs, 8 mashed bananas and a couple teaspoons vanilla and banana extract.  I baked it all in one large square pan for 40 mins.  It tastes so good!  I agree that it is more of a flavorful rich cake than dense bread but other than that, it is moist, tasty and is  delicious without any type of topping.  It will be a wonderful snack cake to share.

Yummy!  Super easy and very good!  I added more bananas (5, I think) because I had that many.  Topped this with the Cream Cheese frosting and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. A keeper!

I tried the recipe as written - which I like to do before changing it.  And yep, there is way too much oil for my taste.  You could easily cut it in half.  It is definatley more cake than bread.  With that said I will use the recipe again becauase it is so easy!  Probably will add some spices and definately much less oil.

I have made this bread several times, I don't use as much oil (only 1/3 cup) and I add about 3/4 cup of water. Posted photo I only had 2 bananas. It is a really quick fix for banana bread/cake, and is a good way to use up those brown bananas! Used with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.

I love this recipe.  It's quick and simple.  I work in a nursing home and made this as a treat for the residents and staff.  I used the mini individual loaf pans and added a crumb topping.  They loved it!!  I got lots of compliments on it.  Thank you!

I was skeptical since you basically just add banana to a cake mix, but OMG this is delicious!! I will probably cut down on the oil next time, but this was just so moist and so delicious. I used one cake mix, added cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice. I baked it in 2 loaf pans for 50 minutes. What a hit! My family devoured 1 in a span of hours.

I've made this recipe a hundred times and each time I get compliments. I did some minor modifications though. I only use 2/3 cups of oil and I put 5 bananas instead of 3. Bake it in 2 loaf pans and you've got the fluffiest banana bread!

This recipe did not work.  When I saw 1 AND 1/3 cups oil I thought "no", so I cut it to just under a cup of oil and added a few spoonfuls of applesauce.  It didn't cook well (top is done, bottom isn't)and has a terrible oily feel and taste to it.  My kids wouldn't eat it. I was really pulling for this recipe, too.  I feel like I just wasted all those ingredients.

Like others, I made a few modifications. I used a banana cake mix, replaced the oil with 1 cup of apple sauce, added a half teaspoon of vanilla & 1 cup each of chocolate chips, raisins & walnuts. I baked it in 2 9x5 in. loaf pans for an hour, glazed it with powdered sugar mixed with water & sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top. The results were wonderful. I'm definitely adding this recipe to my repetoire. Thanx Melissa!

This is a simple recipe for those who are broke and want something sweet without having to either spend too much or want to use what's on hand. I'll make this now with low-sugar cake mix, a cup of organic applesauce that I made with pumpkin pie or apple pie spice in place of some of the oil, 1/3 cup melted butter, and if I've got the ingredients, I'd frost it with cream cheese frosting. This never fails to disappear. This also makes great cupcakes.

This recipe works great if you use 1 cup of yogurt (I used lemon flavored) and a 1/3 cup of oil to replace the 1 1/3 cups of oil listed.

I found if you use frozen banana's it makes it a bit watery.  The taste is good but it falls apart.

I was speptical if how this  would come out since it was so easy,(my 4 year old even helped) but its awesome! Instead of a 9 x 13 I used a mini loaf pan to give to my mothers in my family for Mothers Day tomorrow.  It was so good I want to make more, but I only have one banana left so I am going to throw it in w/ some left over crushed pineapple and strawberries. I will report back!

I think something went wrong with this one.  It was cooked on the outside, but not in the center.  It also had an oily feel to it.  I may try again, just in a different pan.

This was SO good!!!  And easy!  I also only used 1/3 cup of oil and had to use french vanilla cake mix since I didn't have yellow.  I was able to make 2 loaves with the batch and needless to say that less than 24 hours later, I only have half a loaf left!!!  It's really delicious!!!

I loved this recipe!!  I was searching for something new and quick to do with some browning bananas last night.  I happened to have a cake mix in the pantry.  Easy, super moist, excellent.  No more regular banana bread for me.

I have made this banana bread twice using french vanilla cake mix because store was out of the yellow flavor.  This is absolutely delicious!! Better than other recipes I have made in the past.  I added chopped pecans just because I had some in the pantry.

This was SO easy!! I used 1 cup of applesauce as a substitute for oil, used two loaf pans and I sprinkled  cinnamon & sugar on the top before baking, as suggested by others. They turned out perfect and dense like a banana bread should! I will make this again!!!

Fabulous!  I made this recipe as written.  It turned out great.  I do think the oil can be cut down and I will do that the next time.  I added pecans pieces.  Next time I'll add raisins too.

This is more of a cake then a bread. So, if you are looking for a dense banana bread this will not be it. This is very moist and it baked beautifully but I thought the amount of oil called for was high so I modified it to 2/3C. of oil and added 1/2C. water. I made no other changes. Very Good.

Super-fast quick banana cake.  Very easy.  So easy I can't say it's 5 star.  Only had 3 bananas, I reduced oil as well, to 1/2 cup - then read the cake box which only requires 1/3 c. - still good.  Added 4oz cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Good fluffy cake!

Just wonderful.  I only had 2 ripe bananas so I cut it in half and made a 8 x 8 cake pan.  I thought it was more of a cake than a bread so I made a glaze with confectioners sugar and put it on top of the cake while hot and sealed with aluminum foil so it could melt into the cake.  Just wonderful !

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't use all the oil though. I used about a 1/2 cup of oil and that was more than enough. I was a little unsure about using cake mix for a banana bread but it was suprisingly good. Will make again!

The outside of the bread - (cake?) -was tasty but the center was inedible.  Maybe a jelly roll pan would work better than a 9 x 13 pan.  It's a shame because I really like recipes with only a few ingredients.

This turned out like a very moist cake.  It has a great flavor and was really easy to make.  I added about a cup of chopped walnuts and was very happy with the way it turned out.

This recipe is just what I was looking for.  I prefer more of a cake than a bread and this recipe is so easy. I did decrease the oil to 3/4 cup and baking time was about 45 minutes. I took it to work and everyone loved it. Thanks

I used spice cake mix and 1 cup of oil.  It baked 15 minutes longer that stated and tested "done", but the very bottom lining of the cake was underbaked when I cut into it. It has a great taste...trying to salvage it put it back into the oven @ 325 for 20 minutes, cross your fingers for me. I may try a jellyroll pan as suggested because this was a real time saver! Also will cut back on the oil to maybe 1/2 a cup or 1/3 cup as stated on the recipe.

Great easy recipe.  I usually dont like the after-taste of the cake mix,  to many preservatives,  but you could not taste them.   Yummy!!  I made a brown sugar struesel topping.   Freezes wonderfully!   Thanks

i love how easy this recipe is. i tweak it a bit by using dark chocolate cake mix, instead of 1 1/3 cup of oil i only used 1/2  cup then 3/4 cups of water and add mini chocolate chips about 1/2 cup.. its super moist and yummy..

Reduce the oil to 1/3 cup - the recipe definitely had this wrong.  Great recipe though - will definitely keep this one in my recipe box!  Easy and a hit with the kids!

Great basic recipe! 
I used 1/2 melted cool butter, splash of whole milk, added about 1/ cup brown sugar/vanilla/2 jumbo eggs to bananas. Blended with yellow cake mix. 
Made 12 large muffins with struesal topping from normal recipe. 
Baked at 350f for just over 22 minutes. 

OmGoodness!! Yummy!

Love this simple shortcut, but to make it taste like real banana bread I do the following:add 1&1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3 tbs of brown sugar, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup water, 5 bananas and a dash of nutmeg

This is a pretty good recipe.  I had some problem because all of the cake mixes I had on hand were only 15 oz.  I wasn't sure just how to compensate for the smaller mix and ended up with a cake that didn't want to cook in the middle.  In fact, it had begun to burn on the bottom before it was done in the middle.  I did add cinnamon and allspice and exchanged half the oil with applesauce.  I will shop for a larger cake mix and try this one again.  If it Does work, it would be a great "go to when in a time bind" recipe.  I hope my next review can be better...and do realize that the problems were on my end.  Not the fault of the recipe.  My husband is eating it anyway.  He doesn't mind the slightly burned crust.

Used 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup buttermilk, 1Tsp. Vanilla, and some coconut in it.  Must have turned out pretty good, because it was gone in no time! Visitors even took some home with them.

I have been using this recipe since 2003. I always make the original recipe. I wanted to try something a little different so I only used 1/2 cup of canola oil,1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, 1 tsp. vanilla and 4 tbsp. strawberry Greek yogurt. My banana bread was superb. People outside my home loved it as much as my family. I will used this all of the time. Thank you. (Can you tell me if there was an error regarding the 1-1/3 cups of oil? I love the cake either way).

I just finished making a slight variation of this recipe and it turned out great. I used four bananas, spiced cake mix, four eggs and half a cup of oil. It made two loafs and I put chocolate chips in the second one. Fast, Easy, and stress free. Love it.

I made this recipe substituting 1 cup of buttermilk and 1/3 cup of oil; instead of 1-1/3 cup oil, and added a tsp of vanilla.  Great quick recipe.

I used applesauce instead of the oil, added vanilla and walnuts. I also frosted with cream cheese frosting.
