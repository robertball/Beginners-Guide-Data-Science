Leftover pulled pork?  Check!  Leftover coleslaw?  Check!  Tortilla chips?  Check!  Cheddar Cheese?  Check!  Sriracha?  Always!  Don't be afraid of the sriracha amount because everything else tends to blend out the intense heat (for those wimps who can't take the heat!  haha)  This was perfect!  Very delicious way to serve something---especially when you have all the ingredients on hand.  I'm so glad I have some pulled pork (without BBQ sauce) in my freezer now because Super Bowl 53 is coming up!  Perfect!  Thanks, Soup Loving Nicole!  Love it!
