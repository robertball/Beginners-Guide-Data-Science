Delicious and easy!  Followed the recipe almost exactly to what is written....it is very forgiving with changes to proportions of ingredients.   Perfect as is. I wouldn't stray too far from Orecchiette-like pasta to ensure even cooking. Times listed were spot on. Will make again for sure!

Wonderful! cooking pasta in a reducing broth may not be for everyone- good news is it's very versatile! & I do make it somewhat differntly - for a couple of reasons. I hate the floury taste from pasta cooked in a reducing liquid, same thing happens when you cook pasta in a crock pot-an awful floury taste.. So, if you're like me, here are some tips.. cook your pasta separately, to almost al dente.. 
then use half the chicken broth(any kind of broth/bouillon/ soup mix will work here - if you don't care for salt tho, make sure to use low/no sodium). When you add your pasta cook it in half the broth adding more as/if needed until your pasta is completely done. Another issue for me is the oil and sausage fat (btw - you don't have to use sausage here either, ground or shredded chicken, ground turkey/beef also work well-it should be well seasoned though because it's the backbone of the dish). I use sweet Italian sausage & I add more Italian seasoning & yum-Garlic!. After cooking the onion & any other vegies (yum-diced tomatoes & mushrooms!)-then I check how much oil is in the pan -if I use sausage, I drain the oil/fat then add sausage & drain again before adding pasta. If I use chicken-then I may not drain, chicken has less fat-see how it cooks up & you can judge if you need/want to drain fat off. finally, the greens - arugula/spinach/zucchini all work great! Remember a recipe is only a guide & you know your family's tastes best.

Liked this much better than cooking pasta alone. Much richer. I made with kale as that is what I had. Sautéed the onions, garlic then added kale. I took out of pan and sautéed sausage with about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper. I then drained it and put back in pan with veggies. I used vegetable broth as I had it open. Rich and delicious

I love Chef John, and I love one-pan dishes, but I found this underwhelming.  Like a lot of good, fast recipes it relies on sausage as "spice shortcut" because the spicy Italian sausage already has many spices blended in. In this case, I would have been better off to add more garlic, crushed red pepper, and the other half of the onion.

This was super easy and fast to make.  My fiancee said that it was a gourmet meal that would cost a lot at a restaurant.  My two picky boys thought it was delicious and asked me to make it again the next day, which rarely happens.  My new favorite Italian dish from my favorite chef on this site!

This was quick, easy, and very good.  Instead of arugula I added spinach.  I used 1lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb spicy.  My family said this is something they would like to have again.  Thanks for sharing.

As stated in previous reviews, this recipe is delicious, easy, and very forgiving with the proportions and interchangeability of ingredients. I used ground turkey for the meat and spinach for the greens. I also used homemade chicken stock to control the salt content. A definite keeper, as always with Chef John's recipes!

Another great recipe from Chef John,  I have been looking for an Orichette recipe for awhile as I had a box in my pantry.   I didn't have hot sausage, so I used country sausage and added some Italian seasoning and hot pepper flakes. I doubled up the recipe, but didn't have any low salt broth, just used regular. I thought the recipe called for too much liquid, but nope, it was all absorbed.  Next time I will try it with vegetable broth.  I also used a lid on my deep pan to keep the liquid from evaporating. At the end, I chopped up about half of a 5 oz package of arugula.  Our picky daughter gave it 5 stars, so I had to write this review.   Love the suggestions from others......turkey sausage, ground turkey, fresh mushrooms, cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus.  It is a keeper, thanks Chef John!

I made it almost as stated, except that I doubled it, used turkey sausage, and added a pound of baby spinach leaves at the end instead of arugula; it was deeelish! Thank you for a simple, yet tasty, one-pan meal. Also, the recipe call for 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth and my box had 4 cups, so since I certainly wasn't about to refrigerate 1/2 cup of broth, I just added it and threw in another cup of pasta and it turned out perfect ;)

This recipe is great and beyond easy to make! I think next time I make it I may try pine nuts in it and possibly experiment with some fennel and anise spice. The leftovers were maybe better than the original meal. I did add a ton more arugula than suggested and used garlic. My boyfriend doesn't much care for veggies in his pasta and he ate a huge bowl!

I made this tonight and am happy to say it is one of the best dishes I've done.  Even my picky wife loved it.  For the green I used broccoli.  Used hot  Italian sausage and didn't have to spice at all.  Easy to make with a great taste.  I pan clean up.  This recipe is outta the park! Thanks Chef John!!

This was perfect. I couldn't find orichette at the grocery store, but medium shells were perfect. I doubled the recipe (4 servings), and the proportion of arugula was a little light. I'd recommend using almost half again as much next time.

This recipe is soooo good - definitely one of the families favorite.  I actually put the laptop on my counter and went step by step with Chef John.  The only changes i made: sweet sausage, adding a couple of chopped cloves garlic w. the onions and subbed fresh spinach for the arugula.  Yum....

Rarely do I comment on recipes, but this is the exception! Wow!!! Fantastic! My husband made this dish tonight and it was just wonderful!! The taste was rich, hearty,  and spicy...everything we love! Chef John's recipe was right on target, except for some Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,  which we added at the end of the pasta, adding a little more creaminess. Its amazing that so few ingredients can contribute to such a depth of flavor! Bravo Chef John! I must say, this recipe is restaurant worthy. We will be making this recipe again and for company.

The pasta took forever to cook and still wasn't really done.  Talk about greasy--ugh!  Normally we love every All Recipes recipes.  One should definitely cook the sausage on the side to drain off the grease.

Excellent - I added a handful of fresh sliced mushrooms and some thin asparagus pieces as well - it was very good and will definitely make this again.  I'd think bows or rotini would work well with this.

Another winning recipe from Allrecipes! I wound up splashing a little more broth into this as it cooked and it was fabulous! Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Super easy dish with a lot of bang for your buck. Tip: keep extra broth on hand for reheating with left-overs.

This has become my husband and son's favorite pasta dish. They love how good it tastes and I love how easy it is to make! I follow the recipe with one exception - I purchase hot Italian sausage patties and then break them up while I'm browning it. So much faster than peeling casings off!
This is a restaurant quality pasta dish. Chef John does it again!

I made this last night and followed the instructions to a tee, and I will now admit after making two different one pan pasta, I am not a fan.  Both recipes I have tried are not only bland but the pasta is extremely difficult to cook to my satisfaction.  Maybe it is because I am Italian or maybe I understand seasoning better than some, but whatever the reason, this and the other one I tried was a epic fail!

This was a great recipe.  I used sweet chicken Italian sausage and added about a half table spoon of crushed red pepper while cooking the onion for the heat.  Our store didn't have the pasta that was called for so I used Campanelle and it worked great.  Didn't need the amount of liquid called for but it still turned out creamy and rich.  Also used a mixed salad green instead of straight arugula...Definitely made my recipe book!

This dish is so simple and flavorful!! I used medium shells instead of orecchiette but only because my local grocery didn't have orecciette. Definitely a keeper!!

Very good, quick and easy! I did not have orecchiette on hand so I used penne instead. I also used spinach instead of arugula. I found this to be a bit greasy. I will definitely make this again, next time I will drain off some of the sausage grease before adding the broth & pasta. I really like this method for cooking pasta in one dish! Thank you.

I've made this several times as I think it is just wonderful.  
And to those who say "never add chicken broth, use pasta water", read the recipe, if it is cooked correctly, there is no pasta water.  You don't cook the pasta separately.

I made this dish after you posted it the first time. It was delish! I made it as given. The only advice I could add is careful with the pasta that it does not stick together. It will cause it to cook unevenly. Otherwise, really enjoyed it.

Loved it!  Very easy to make, proportions are flexible.  Add as much pasta/other ingredients as you want, just keep adding a little broth when the dish starts to dry up.  Leaves you with some wonderfully al dente pasta!  Definitely going into the easy weeknight meal rotation.

Excellent! I added the chicken broth one cup at a time, letting each cup absorb before adding more, and substituted spinach for arugula. Delicious, easy dinner.

I subscribe to the magazine & have held this recipe since 2016.  Finally had a chance to give it a try. Was easy & tasty. Substituted spinach for arugula. Added a few red pepper flakes & garlic. Next time I will use sausage patties to reduce prep time. I found it only made enough for one dinner.  I thought I'd have enough for another night. Next time  I may double the recipe if my skillet deems large enough to accommodate all the ingredients.

So delicious!!! The flavor from the onions, sausage (I used sweet-Italian turkey sausage,) and chicken broth are perfect to cook your pasta in (I used bow-ties.) I stirred for a while, but when the pasta wasn't cooked all the way through I put the cover in my pan and let it sit for a while. My fiancée loved it, and said it tasted like a restaurant quality dish. Definitely do not forget the cheese on top. Freshly grated pecorino romano made this dish! Great recipe!

The tastiest pasta I've ever made! The first time around, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I made a few changes: instead of removing the casing from the sausages and grounding them up, I used chicken apple sausages and cut them into slices. I also added fennel. Lastly, I decided to cook the orechiette in boiling water first for ~9 minutes, then I added it to the pan and cooked it in chicken stock until absorbed. It tasted much more flavorful the second time around. I'd recommend tweaking the recipe until it perfectly suits your tastes.

Simple to make. It was good. Make sure you use the low sodium chicken broth! If you use the regular broth you will find the flavor to be very salty.

Delicious and easy.  I used three links of Johnsonville firecracker sausage and added some sliced portobello mushrooms and a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic,  too.  Definitely takes awhile to soften the pasta and reduce the broth, more like 30 minutes.  Loved the arugula.  Another winner from CJ!

Delicious!!  Next time I will cook pasta to al dente then add to sausage onion mix as it took much longer than the 15 minutes noted in the recipe.  Also added minced garlic and almost double the arugula.  Another great dish from Chef John??

I followed the recipe except that I removed the whole chopped onion after cooked.  I cooked the 19 oz sausage separately in case there was a lot of fat. So that I could remove the fat.  I added garlic salt, red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to the Hot Italian Sausage. I added back the onions, poured in 4 cups of broth, 2 1/2 cups of pasta, then  I poured in a can of petite chopped tomato while the pasta was cooking. Cooked it until the pasta was to my liking, added double the arugula.  Yummy!

I was skeptical on this one pan dish, using simple ingredients, but it was just that--so simple and came out great. The taste is almost buttery (light) and melt in your mouth good! This recipe is very modifiable to be gluten free. I hope those with Celiac or GF sensitivity realize how easy it is to modify Chef John's recipes and have delicious results!


I used mild Italian sausage (I don't like spicy Italian sausage). I'm sure Sweet Italian sausage would work just fine. Since it was a generic brand at my store, I doctored the sausage a bit by adding basil, oregano, and garlic (about 1 tbsp each).  Alright, time for the GF pasta notes!


I also made this gluten free (used 3/4 of a 16oz package of gluten free penne pasta--corn based) and ended up using gluten free vegetable broth since that was all I had on hand. I found that I needed to add about 1-1.5 cup more vegetable broth with the pasta. I just monitored the pasta as I wasn't sure how long it would take to cook. It was about 10 minutes for me. If you use a rice based gluten free pasta, the cook time might be different. Additionally, you might not need to add more liquid or might need to add a little more with a rice based pasta. You'll be able to tell once  you start mixing in the pasta and broth. I recommend to just keep an eye on the pasta and just before they are done, start adding the arugula (or fresh spinach, which is what I had on hand. Other reviews have used kale too). Add in more of the fresh leafy greens of yo

Quick to make - perfect weeknight dinner.  I also added garlic.  Next time, I would double the amounts of orecchiette and kale.  (I actually used a spinach/kale blend, so think spinach would be fine alone too.)  The broth didn't absorb as much as indicated, so was more stew-like.  Adding sweet potato or butternut squash might be nice to round it out.

A big hit at dinner!  Easy to make.  I only substituted Al Fresco chicken sausage with red & green peppers.  Also used a spice called garam masala since I did not have marjoram.  A keeper!

I thought this was easy and delish comfort food. Toward the end I added water instead of chick stock. I was using 33% less sodium chicken stock and it started to condense down to be too salty for my tastes. Every time you make it,  or persons preference on saltiness is a little different though. So all in all, I will use this recipe again. Good stuff!

I added some pine nuts (per suggestions) and chopped celery (for a little texture) late in the cooking time, and seasoned the sausage with garlic and onion powder and a little smoked paprika and thyme because I couldn't get "spicy" sausage. Other than those changes I followed the recipe exactly - right down to using low-sodium chicken stock.  I admit I was intrigued but worried by this recipe because I just couldn't understand how it could have any flavor, but was I ever wrong! The flavors were full, intense and delicious. Next time, I'll cut my spices by half and I think it will be perfection.

Pasta is not supposed to taste like chicken.  You should never add chicken broth to pasta.  What you do is save some of the pasta water and use that to form a sauce.

I like the idea but absolutely hated  the idea of cooking pasta in the pan. It took a WHOLE LOT LONGER than just boiling it separately.

I made this last night for dinner and served it as a side dish.  It was fabulous.  I will definitely make it again.  I did add a little fresh garlic to the onions, otherwise I followed the recipe.  So easy, so good.

I made this recipe again - it is amazing.  It's a keeper.

I made the first time, as is. Wonderful.  All subsequent preparations have been made with what I had on hand: mini farfalle, beef stock, veggie stock, spinach, kale, even rigatoni, sweet Italian sausage. It is a very forgiving recipe that adapts well to substitutions. All substitutions I give 5 stars, too.  I make this several times a month.  It doubles and triples well.

Very good recipe but mine was a tad salty so I now use low sodium broth. ALSO, I use fresh leaf spinach instead of the arugula. It's very very good!!

This was a very easy and tasty meal.  My kids loved it.  The second time I made it I used chopped chicken instead of Italian sausage and I added cilantro and garlic for a completely different but equally satisfying flavor.

Very good flavor and a surprising change from tomato based pasta sauces. The sauce was rich and flavorful all without the use of cream or butter. I doubled the amount of sausage using a mix of mild and spicy; draining off the extra oil after browning. I doubled the amount of pasta, using medium shells and kept stirring and adding more chicken stock until tender, about 17 min. Use the lowest sodium stock you can find and do not add any additional salt. Using a good Parmigiano-Reggiano is a must!

One HUGE plus for this kind of recipe is that for people in a wheelchair (or even needing to use a cane or walker),one does NOT have to deal with handling & moving around with a pot of boiling water & pasta!! A very major issue in cooking, for us. The recipe itself, with added kale/garlic/peppers, etc., is wonderful, too.

Made with spinach instead of arugula.....didn't have spicy Italian sausage so I went with Sweet, and that made all the difference in the world, darn near BLAND.  But the 2nd time I made sure I had the HOT and BOOM, great stuff!!  Will definitely make again.

Yummy! This was really easy to make and very good! I made per the recipe, only adding some diced tomatoes, fresh herbs and using medium pasta shells (couldn't find orecchiette in my store). It's perfect for us because my daughter doesn't care too much for tomato based sauces and my hubby doesn't like the cream based. This was a hit! Thanks for sharing!Edit: I've made this a few times now and finally found the correct pasta at Trader Joe's! This is made at least every couple of weeks. We love it!

This was awesome. My husband ate the whole pot. I had to hold back from adding tomatoes and cream because the idea of the dish was keeping it affordable. Glad I did. This was soooooo good ! Will be a regular dish in this household.

As Chef John sometimes says, this basic, adaptable recipe is more about the process than the ingredients, which make CJ's ideas the best in my recipe box. I really appreciate the suggestions of the previous reviewers, generally reading them all prior to doing my shopping.  You've got to love a process-recipe that allows you so much leeway in choice of meat/liquid/starch/seasoning/vegetable.  After my first use of orrecchiette, I think it should be a staple!  True some of the tiny ears stuck together but were easily separated with a fork: you were supposed to be standing there anyway, stirring!

Wonderful method of cooking a pasta meal in one pot! I heavily modified this using a totally different meat, but followed the instructions in the video and they are so simple! The pasta tastes so different when you cook it by gradually stirring in the chicken broth. We loved it and it was easy to do!

Delicious!  Followed Chef John's directions of adding arugula to taste, so we added 2 cups.  Because our local grocery store does not carry orrechiette, we used bow ties.  We did add garlic.  Our sausage seemed pretty greasy, so we drained before adding chicken broth.  If you use commercial broth, be very careful when adding salt to the onions.

This was a really great dish - made it tonight - only changes were used two sweet sausages and two hot - also used escarole instead of argula - added parmesan cheese at the end to cream up the sauce - will definitely make often especially in winter!

Thought it was good but with reservation.  It was greasy.  Too much olive oil or was the Trader Joe's sausage greasy.  Why so little green?  One-half cup is like adding parsley to a recipe. I used about 2 cups of spinach.  Be careful of the "little ears" sticking together.  Never had a problem when I boil them in water, but they stuck together for this recipe. Flavors were good.  Never cooked pasta this way.  Like risotto.

This dish is so simple and delicious ! I’d never cooked with this type of pasta and I must say I’m a fan .  I added a little extra chicken broth to get pasta to be tender .  I added about 1/2 tsp if oregano and basil , otherwise made as directed. Yummy !

Well...yes, it was very good and easy to make but, it reminded me of Italian wedding soup.   I would add more vegetables, such as peppers and carrots and less chicken broth.   In fact, I looked up the Allrecipes  wedding soup entrée and with the exception of basil and one other ingredient there was virtually no difference.    Glad I tried it, though..

Made this with sweet italian sausage and added some crushed red pepper. Also subbed spinach for arugula. Think I may add fresh mushrooms next time.

Loved one-pan cooking. Making the pasta in the forming sauce is perfect touch.   I didn't have brats or arugula, so I used light Turkey kielbasa (chopped) and frozen baby green peas.  As  someone else, I used a little garlic.  Also added  some Worcestershire and 2 cubes of chicken bouillon.  It was delicious.  But the recipe is so basic, I'll use variations of it over and over again.  Husband loved it and suggested shrimp next time.  Kudos to Chef Caputo.

Delicious..one change, I add 1 cup of wine and sliced shallot to the sausage & let it reduce for 5 minutes then add in chicken broth as needed.  so easy & delish - make this once a week & usually sub fresh spinach for the arugula!

Love  the flavor combinations in this dish. I did add 2 smashed cloves of garlic while onion caramelized. I added dry basil and a bay leaf while simmering in chicken broth. I added a heaping teaspoon of Sun dried Tomatoes (sliced) before I added the Arugula and Parmesan cheese. I only had macaroni pasta so I used that instead but I do love the Orecchiette pasta and will use it next time when I make it again. We love spicy Italian food so this was a winner for us.

So easy to make, very good, will make again.  Added a few fresh tomatoes, used spicy chicken rabe sausage, and added toasted panko breadcrumbs with lemon zest on top before serving.

I added a couple of cloves of garlic, sautéed mushrooms as well, then sliced tofurky italian sausage to make it vegetarian, otherwise followed the recipe. It was fabulous and even better (by a lot) reheated the next day. My husband loved it and ate every leftover bite ("smack!"). And he's a meat eater! I will definitely make this again and again.

I made this recipe but used regular chicken stock, not low sodium as it called for. I don't suggest that at all. It was too salty for me, but that was the only stock I had on hand. I love this recipe, and not only did my husband love it, but our kids too! I will be adding this recipe to my go-to's!

This was great!  However I did make several changes based on what I had at home.  I browned a pound of lean hamburger, drained it, and set it aside.  I browned the onion in less oil than called for, then added in the cooked hamburger.  For the broth I used beef, and added garlic, oregano, and basil.  I added in some frozen peas during the last few minutes of cooking.  I used elbow macaroni and cooked it in chicken broth, and then put the meat mixture over that so any leftovers wouldn't get mushy.  It was totally delicious, but most definitely not a one pot meal by the time I was done!

Hey guys, this is Dean.

Preparing the best pasta can be really difficult at first. It was almost impossible for us to master how to do it without proper Step-by-Step tutorial from the professional chefs.

The whole family loved this.  I used homemade German sausage, since that is about the only sausage I ever have.  I used beef stock and added a few sun-dried tomatoes.  I didn't have any arugula or spinach so no green veggie went in. Cooked it just like it said and it was quick and delicious. I did take off most of the fat from the sausage. I will definitely make this again!

I made this tonight for dinner -- it was delicious!  It did take quite a bit of stirring -- probably close to 20 minutes for me to get the pasta done.  But that was the hardest thing about it.  It's a pretty simple, one-pot meal -- right up my alley!
I followed the recipe exactly, except I had baby arugula, not the big bunch.  The combination of spicy sausage, arugula and plenty of stirring and reducing the broth gave it all of the flavor it needed.  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious. It makes two very generous portions. I followed the directions as written. It is salty, even though I used low sodium chicken broth. I may go 1/2 water, 1/2 broth next time. I also substituted Power Greens (arugula, chard, kale combo) for the arugula. I would increase the amount of greens next time too. My husband really like this meal, and said to add it to the rotation! Thanks Chef John!

Very tasty and easy! 1 pan and minimal mess.  I added 1/4 to 1/3 cup of heavy cream to make it creamy.  I also added fresh sliced cherry tomatoes for color. Kids loved it!

We love this dish! I added more pasta. Added more broth as it cooked and needed more. There were NO leftovers! I was hoping there would be but it was so tasty even the picker eater in the house had seconds. One of our favorite dishes.

It was a lot of work for pasta that just tasted like Italian sausage.  I'm a big fan of Chef John but this one needs some tweaking. I'll add garlic and diced tomatoes next time.  Not sure it's worth all the stirring either, may just go old school and cook the pasta.  I used farfalle (bow ties) because orecchiette cups together.

This pasta is deceptively flavorful! It’s not a red sauce, it’s not a white sauce, it’s unique and yummy! I was out of chicken broth and had to use beef broth- I thought it was a beautiful substitute as it lended a tangy flavor and went well with the sausage. My guests raved about this dish, asked for the recipe, and made it that same week!

Absolutely delicious, and my newest no fuss vacation (and any day) meal! Ingredients are easy to find and recipe is simple. I vary the veggy from time to time and have lately substituted the arugula for swiss chard and add cherry or raisin tomatoes for a little color. I also add all the liquid in at once to ensure the pasta cooks evenly. It is on my list of staple recipes!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband said he'd pay a lot of money for this dish at a restaurant. We like spicy food so I added crushed red pepper, garlic and Italian seasoning once the broth was boiling. I also added mushrooms (once the meat was mostly cooked) and tomatoes (at the very end).  Even without these additions, I think this would have been an amazing dish.

The first time I made this I had trouble keeping everything in the pan while I stirred and cooked the pasta.  The second time I made it I removed the sausage before cooking the pasta--less messy for me.  I added the sausage after the pasta was done and the arugula was wilted.  I thought it tasted just as good.  Really yummy recipe.

I made a few adjustments quantity wise but this recipes as someone else said is very versatile. You can also omit the broth and use water if you don’t drain the sausage after done browning.

So easy and delicious.  This is my go to, it requires no thinking or rushing around the kitchen, and easy clean up with one pan.  Get a spicy sausage to add a little kick.  When I can find orecchiette, I'll use shells instead and it is just as good.

The guy in the video is great, I wish we had more of him.

I suggest you drain the sausage fat before adding broth and definitely use a reduced salt chicken broth.

I made it as stated but used zucchini noodles in place of pasta. The lower rating was for flavor as I didn’t particularly love the flavor blend.

This is a wonderful dish so rich and delicious, even my daughter in law who says she doesn’t like Italian sausage ask for the recipe, I did substitute the spicy Italian sausage for mild Italian sausage. One pot from start to finish. I will be make this recipe again soon.

I loved it. Was a little too spicy hot for the wife. I used spinach instead of arugula because I had the spinach on hand. I'll definitely make it again but I'll use sweet Italian sausage instead of the spicy so wife can enjoy it as much as I did.

I blame the score for having a bad day.  It was okay, but I wasn't able to finish it, due to half-cooked pasta. I did swap the minced onion for diced onion as usual.  I would try to make it again and redeem myself on a good day.

The "sauce" seemed nearly nonexistent, so I added some cream to make it a little more substantial.  There's no way my kids would eat arugula, so I added some frozen peas instead.

Definitely will make it again! The spicy Italian sausage added a lot of kick! No need to add more hot spices. I switched up the pasta, made bow tie. Did switch up recipe. Cooked pasta first. Fried sausage as stated and also added a can of seasoned chopped tomatoes. Simmered then threw in the pasta and I used baby spinach instead of arugula. It was delicious!

I accidently got regular chicken broth instead of  the low sodium broth. It was way to salty for me. I don’t think I would make it again.

This is delicious! Cooking the pasta in the broth creates a savory, creamy sauce.  Love that it's a one pan dish, too.

This was so easy and hubby LOVED it!  I usually have these ingredients on hand, so I know I’m going to serve it again and again, especially when I’m pressed for time.  A one pan meal is such a God-send!  One dish and a few plates.  Yay!

I just finished making and now eating this lovely dish. I added Baby Bella mushrooms and substituted the arugula with spinach. Delicious! I will add a dash a red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. Otherwise, it's lovely, especially paired with a a glass of rosé. Delicious!

That was seriously good.  I added fresh chopped spinach for more veggies. I didn’t want to use pork and there was no turkey sausage so I just bought ground turkey and looked up Italian sausage seasonings and seasoned accordingly.

first review I've ever left on here, I just had to because it's simply so good. both my husband and I loved it, wished I had made more because we cleaned the pot! I used sweet ground italian sausage instead of hot, and spinach instead of arugula. next time i think I'll mix hot and sweet sausage just to make it more fun! absolutely loved this recipe though so easy and delicious!

I have made this three times. The first time, I followed the instructions but used full sodium chicken broth. DO NOT DO THIS. It was inedibly salty. And I am a SALT EATER. The second time I used low sodium chicken broth and it was better, but the pasta was cloying and gummy. AND STILL TOO SALTY—even for me! The third time, I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the orrechiette separately to almost al dente and added it into the sausage mixture  with half the chicken broth in the recipe, and cooked it down. That worked much better. It’s a very rich dish. But delicious!

Really good! I tripled it cooking in a stockpot. The sausage didn't exactly brown because of all the grease rendered. Next time I think Id increase the arugula. It shrinks down a lot in cookin I think. More would add some tasty contrast to the sausage. Using good Parmesan really helps this one. I used mild sausage since small kids would eat  if & we found it great. Photo is my tasty leftovers!

I made this recipe to test it out for a dinner party. I am definitely serving this dish! I used chicken sauce patties, but will use the links next time, with casings removed. I added more arugula, and agree that spinach would probably work as well. After adding the pasta, I covered the pan and lowered the heat because the pasta was not completely submerged and I thought it wouldn't get thoroughly cooked. As a result, I ended up using less chicken broth than the recipe calls for. The recipe provides about 4 decent sized servings.

The only changes I made were: adding a couple of minced garlic cloves ( I love garlic) and adding about a cup more of arugula. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Honestly, it was my first time really tasting arugula and I loved it and felt it could've used even more since it really wilts and shrinks down. I might use a hint more broth too since the pasta tends to absorb a lot, almost ran but it cooked through luckily and it turned out great overall. Very creamy in a way due to the fact it is all cooked in one pot so do not pre boil the pasta, it defeats the purpose of the dish. Thanks Chef John!

My husband and I both liked it, which is always a plus because he is hard to please. He frequently complains that recipes are too bland. I did follow someone’s suggestion to drain the sausage, and I wiped out the Dutch oven with paper towels to get out more of the grease. I also pressed more grease out of the sausage itch paper towels. I think that the next time I make it I will reduce the olive oil by half and add fresh mushrooms.

My family loved this meal even though they were a bit hesitant at first. I used 3 Hot Chicken Italian sausages and 2 Hot Pork Italian sausages.  I cooked my pasta separately due to personal preference. I had spinach on hand so I used it in place of the arugula. Also added a touch of half & half to the broth and it brought everything together. Mixed the pasta into the sausage and broth mixture. Let it sit for a few minutes so the pasta can marry with the sausage and broth. Great the next day for leftovers. Adding this recipe to our rotation.

Thumbs up from the kids. We couldn't find the pasta so I subbed small shells. I'm not a fan of Italian sausage so we went with a pork sausage. This was delicious. I think spinach would work well here too. Easy for the rotation.

Used penne pasta instead. Sautéed with garlic and onion for added flavor. I didn’t have low sodium chicken broth, so I used the regular one with half of the liquid and pasta still cooked through fine. A very good and easy recipe!

Fantastic recipe. So forgiving and easy to modify to your group's taste and availability of ingredients. I used regular Italian sausage made fresh at a local deli. I added red pepper flakes while browning it. I found the orecchiette at aldi. I added extra garlic, a lot of chopped kale, a can of white beans and chopped sun dried tomotao. To keep the pasta from sticking together requires almost constant gentle stirring and adding broth a little at a time. We loved the almost stew like consistency. This will be my new recipe for the family soup cook off next Christmas.

This is a very savory and heavy pasta dish. My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

I put two cloves of garlic in with the onion, and it ended up taking much more broth than the recipe called for to cook the orrechetti to cook all the way through. I also used at least double the arugula. If I make this again I will grill the sausage separately and then thinly slice it and add it in at the end.

I wouldn't describe this as cheap to make. Shell pasta is a lot cheaper than oricchiette, and unless you grow it yourself, arugula is pricey, but it's delicious. It doesn't hurt that sausage, greens, and hot pepper are the one true way to my heart. Bonus points if it involves starches or beans, which this does. So yeah, totally worth it. Of course, it probably didn't hurt that I added additional fennel seeds, crushed red pepper, and at least double the parmesan reggiano. But, as Chef John would say, that's just me cooking. :)

My store doesn’t have orecchiette pasta so I used medium shells & my family doesn’t like arugula so I used baby spinach. Some of the members in my family can’t handle spicy so I used mild sausage.

SO GOOD. Next time I plan to do about double the amount of pasta (which would mean more chicken broth, too) because it felt a little sausage heavy. I probably almost doubled the arugula because arugula is yummy! A very good, very easy recipe. Be patient with the gradual addition of chicken broth, it's worth it!

This  recipe was so easy and amazingly delicious.  It tasted like we were in a 5 star Italian restaurant.  Try it, you'll love it.  This was the second time I made this and it will not be the last.  P.S.  I made it exactly as directed both times.  Sooooooo delicious.

Made this dish, used chicken sausage instead of pork sausage. Not quite sure why but it came out pretty salty & didnt add any. Maybe the broth? Couldn't find low sodium. It was ok but I wont make it again.

I love this recipe! I used turkey sausage and it turned out great! You really do have to be patient and stir it a lot. Next time, I would hold the salt altogether - my first go around the meal turned out extremely salty, but other than that it’s fantastic!

I have made this 4 times already and it never disappoints! Like one of the other reviews says, It is very forgiving with portion modifications. I use spinach in place of arugula (just because I never have arugula on hand), I use sweet or mild sausage instead of spicy. I also like a little more sauce

So yummy! I made a few minor changes to take it from a 4 to a 5 star- following other reviews, I cooked my pasta al dente in water prior to finishing it in the main dish with chicken broth. I then started in a separate pan with my sausage and cooked it down by half before I added onion then garlic. I deglazed with the chicken stock and added mushrooms shortly after. I then added the pasta and cheese. After a few moments I realized that the sauce would be very thin so I made a raw butter/flour rue and whisked it in. I waited until I felt everything was cooked how I liked it, then took the pasta off the heat and added the arugula. A little parm and parsley to garnish. I had mad enough for left overs, but every bit was gone by the end of the evening.

Pretty good stuff.  I added a little white wine to the pan.  And a bit of red bell pepper for color.  Also used spinach.  My spicy sausage was almost too spicy.  Might use a mix of regular Italian  and spicy Italian next time.

This recipe is simple and tasty as is, but provides a great base for inspiration as well. I usually add some carrots with the onions, as well as a little white wine or vermouth prior to the chicken broth these days. I've used kale instead of arugula, added parcooked lentils with the pasta, used pan sauteed garlic chicken instead of sausage. I basically adjust the recipe based on what we have on hand. We probably make this or a variation on a theme once a week for a quick weeknight dinner. From opening the fridge to finish it takes about 30 minutes to prepare.

This is the second time I made this recipe.  Last time I added pine nuts and my husband didn't like it.  This time I made the recipe exactly as called for except I added fresh garlic and a half of a red bell pepper and my husband loved it. My only other change was to double it.  It was a big hit.

Writing this review to make notes to myself. Didn't thaw sausage in time, used chicken breast. Shallot, half a habanero, oil and italian seasoning to start. Add chicken and chopped baby portobello, brown, add broth and pasta. Some broccoli. Added arugula and halved cherry tomatoes. Delicioius, but the chicken overcooked in the broth. Will try again with sausage.

With the exception of using farfalle instead of orecchiette (not available at the time), I made this recipe exactly as written. This was a delicious dish that my leafy greens-hating boyfriend and persnickety toddler both gobbled up. I would consider adding artichoke heart quarters to the recipe when I make it in the future.

These one pot pastas are fantastic!  You get such a creamy sauce and the ease of one pot cooking.  BTW, there are so many variations of these... ziti with Italian sausage and three cheeses...etc, etc..  Allrecipes featured these one pot meals a while back.  Thanks!

we really liked this dish.  A really hearty, stick to your bones meal.  Make sure you double it because the original recipe only serves 2 and next time I'd replace a bit of the broth with water.  It was a bit salty for us.  I used kale in place of the arugula.

After reading glowing reviews on this site, I have made for myself many of those recipes. In the end, I thought many of the dishes did not come out as indicated and the glowing reviews seemed false. However, this pasta dish is truly a winner. It is simple to make and is very tasty. It also looks great when served. For my taste, I eyeballed the chicken broth and added more if it seemed to need more liquid. Then added cornstarch to the liquid to tighten it up.

This gets a 5 for easy and delicious! I used Rotini pasta because that's what I had.  I added a bag of prewashed baby Arugula, without chopping it.  And, I used a red onion because that's what was in the fridge. My mother in law makes homemade italian sausage,  I added that to the mix. The parmigiana-reggiano tops it off beautifully.

1st time I made this exactly by the recipe.  It was delicious, but salty and not enough pasta for me.  The 2nd time I changed to- 2 cups dry pasta, doubled the arugula, 4 mushrooms chopped, 1 T diced red bell pepper, 3 cans of low sodium broth.  Husband's new favorite-It's an amazing dish!

Incredibly simple to make and equally simple ingredients required. I highly suggest this comforting pasta dish to any cooking skill level. When I made it though, I added some sliced mushrooms to the mix and made it with sweet Italian sausage and fresh spinach leaves instead.

This was awesome! I am a Super Foodie, always on the hunt for something different and yummy. This recipe is super easy, minimal ingredients, but so tasty! I used real sausage with no casing (not hillshire farms). Upon serving, I added fresh sliced fresh tomatoes, good helping of asiago cheese, and toasted pine nuts. A weekday favorite now, and will make at least once a week. Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious and simple to make! Had fusilli pasta and used it. Worked perfectly. No leftovers. Recommend using spicy/hot Italian sausage. That’s all the seasoning and flavour you need. Can also substitute spinach if you don’t have rapinni or arugula!! As Chef John would say, “ENJOY!”

Good, but not great. I followed to a T except I used bow ties instead. Pretty easy, but I think I’ll use less onion next time.

This was easy and delicious! I made it according to the directions and it turned out great. I did have to turn up the heat for the pasta cooking to make sure it kept boiling enough to cook the pasta through. I used arugula but I think it would be just as good with any green like spinach. I'll definitely make this one again.

Simple, easy and wonderfully tasty!  It says it make a meal for 2 and it truly did.  Have a simple or complex salad before and you have a wonderful meal!  If you don't like spicy (and my wife doesn't) just use sweet sausage and you'll still love it.

This was wonderful... I used spinach instead of arugula because I like it better and I probably used double the amount called for.  Loved that it was just one pot, one knife, and a cutting board to clean.  Very quick to prepare and looked like something out of a little Italian bistro.  Definitely gonna make this a lot this Fall and Winter.

Made this last night and it was AMAZING!  My roommates and I love cheese, so I doubled the parmesan, lowered the temperature to low after adding the greens, and threw it in to melt.  It made a nice cheesy sauce.  I'll be making this one again for sure.

We loved this recipe for its ease of preparation and its great flavours. We added mushrooms - very nice - and controlled the level of spice by using 2 hot to one mild sausage.

We've made this a bunch of times now but changed things up a bit.  We sear the sausage whole first (spicy Italian sausage) and then cut them into chunks before adding to the onion.  We don't break them up, so the chunks are the final product.  We also use rapini instead of arugula.   It's a stronger flavor and contrasts well (needs to be added earlier, about a minute before the pasta is ready).  Add some minced garlic and pepper.

Way too much greasy for me, so I drained the sausage mixture before adding the pasta. Since I love arugula, instead of chopping it, I put the pasta sausage mixture on a bed of whole arugula. So-so

I really like this recipe. It is versatile enough to use ground beef or turkey instead of sausage. It took much longer to cook the pasta than expected. Everyone enjoyed it and there were no left- overs!

I made this for dinner last night and I am a hero in the kitchen.  I had about one and 3/4 cups of the Orecchiette pasta so I used it all and two spicy Italian sausages.  I had some mushrooms which need to be used  so I quartered them and added them while cooking the onions.  I squeezed the juice from half a lemon  after  the sausage and pasta were added to the pan with the cup and a half of the broth.   A few grindings of fresh pepper the rest of the broth (one whole box 900ml low sodium chicken broth)  and finally the arugula.  I probably used about 1 cup chopped.  Then a few spoonfuls of very good parmesan cheese.  This was a very easy and very delicious dinner.  This is going into my "Tried and True" file.   My additions/changes were insignificant to the recipe and did not alter the intended flavour.

Loved the recipe, we used regular broth instead of low sodium since that was what was on hand and it did turn out a bit salty otherwise it is delicious! We grated the cheese finely and between the cheese and the starches from the pasta there was a hint of a creamy feel to it, perfect.  Thank you!

I made the recipe as directed, tripling it for 6 people.  I found the pasta took forever to soften up and the dish was quite salty even though I used Less Sodium chicken broth.  Next time, I will use half hot Italian sausage to spice it up a bit and more arugula which we love.  The convenience of a one-pan dish was great though!

Easy and delicious. I'm a fairly unskilled cook but was able to make this dish stand out for my weekly "Dad meal." I subbed in baby kale for arugula, and it worked just fine. The kale cooks down so I probably could have put more in.

I hesitate rating this because I realized at the last minute that I was out of chicken broth so I used beef broth and it was delicious.  In fact, one of the best pasta recipes I've made in some time.  Next time I'll make it with chicken broth, hopefully it's as delicious as it was with beef broth.

I have made this several times and really like it.  I love using the orecchiette.  I don't use onions (hate them cooked) and using spinach instead of arugula (easier to find in my local store).  It is time consuming, but worth it.  My biggest complaint is that the first time I made it, I didn't notice it was only 2 servings, but I solved it by purchasing a larger skillet and adjusting quantities.

This was super easy and very tasty.  I goofed and added all the chicken broth at the beginning but let it cook down and the pasta by then was perfect.  I used chicken sausage to be more healthy and added extra arugula which was definitely not too much, then grated Grana Padana on it before serving.   My husband loved the dish and encourages me to make it again soon.

I make this all of the time, we love it!  I tend to make it with mini farfalle pasta and spinach, since that is what I have on hand most often.  I add a bit more broth to add some sauciness to it.  Serve it with a salad and bread, so easy!

I love the idea of this: simple, really fast to make, most of the ingredients I have in my pantry on a regular basis. My one complaint is that it is very one note; very flat. It needs acid so next time I'll deglaze with a little white wine before adding the initial stock. This would be great and easy to version: different pastas, different veggies, herbs and maybe tomatoes (sun dried, roasted of diced). Will def use the concept on a regular basis.

I made this according to the recipe, except at the end I added some seasonings, tomatoes, and mushrooms to try to improve it. My husband and I didn't care for it.  It tasted like mushy pasta cooked in spicy chicken broth.

I made this pretty much as written.  I did add garlic, Italian Seasoning Blend, and a lot more arugula than called for.  Excellent one pot meal.

I thought this was just okay. I made it exactly per the recipe and the pasta came out a bit floury. Flavors were good, but the pasta texture was not what I'm used to. May boil the pasta first next time - as advised by other commenters.

This dish is a family favorite.  Easy to make.  Not your ordinary pasta dish.  I substitute the arugula with fresh spinach and I add some fresh basil.  Next time I'm doubling the batch because there were no leftovers!

This is such a forgiving recipe! I didn't have orecchiette so I used pipe rigate. The rest of the ingredients I followed exactly. I love how this is such a basic recipe and can be customized. Use spinach or kale for the arugula, use Cannellini beans in place of the sausage for a vegetarian meal...or add them with the sausage. The possibilities are endless!

I made this the first time just to use up some leftover Italian sausage and my husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again when his father came to visit. It works with spinach too, but the arugula really does add a special peppery flavor. Make sure to eyeball the chicken broth while the pasta is cooking, you made need more or less than the 3.5 cups depending on how long it takes to cook the pasta and what final consistency suits your preference. The taste is just wonderful and rivals fine Italian restaurants. We served it with garlic bread to soak up the super-yummy broth.

My family and I found this recipe to be way too salty, but could tell it had potential.  We made it a second time and cut out the salt and used low sodium broth.  I added garlic with the onion,Then I added about a cup of heavy cream at the end and warmed it through before serving.  It really elevated the dish!

My husband and I both loved it. I used mild Italian sausage,penne pasta, spinach,Parmesan and asiago cheese.I also used hot pepper flakes and some Cayenne pepper. The penne took a little longer to cook. It was a good spicy...

We've made this twice since printing the recipe about a month ago because it was so good!  The first time we followed the recipe for two servings and doubled it the second time so there would be leftovers!  My boyfriend is often quite picky about the recipes we try and this time, he kept a copy for himself!!

I've made this several times now.  Here's my notes for myself, since I can't save notes elsewhere!  Used just 1 link of spicy turkey sausage, and 2 cups of whole wheat rotini pasta.  Added 1/4 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes and used kale, which had a nice chewy texture - I tried with spinach once, but prefer kale over spinach.  Also added some ground red pepper, and sprinkled with cheese over the end.   Decided to try not stirring constantly this time, and it was fine!  Will definitely keep making!

Very good and easy dish!  I added a clove of minced garlic to the onions, used regular Italian sausage, (because hubby doesn't like the flavor of hot sausage) and added a bit of red pepper flakes.  Towards the end before adding the arugala I threw in about 1/4 cup of diced red bell pepper for color plus I needed to use it up!  I'm glad I used low sodium broth because it still was a bit on the salty side.  I'm sure I'll make it again!

Really easy & great flavor; what more could you ask for?  I love learning from chef John & this is another terrific recipe.  I used spinach (since I don't care for arugula) & even my picky "non-pasta" husband approved; will definitely make again!

Really tasty - beware though, when the recipe says use "low sodium broth" it isn't kidding. Used regular broth and the dish came out very seasoned (my chef boyfriend still really enjoyed it, but I found it a bit too salty). I think it could absolutely use more arugula. Adds a great pepper flavor, I doubled what was asked for and was happy about it.

The sausage finds its way into the crevices of the shells which makes it easy to fork.  I added just a few sauteed mushrooms and tripled the arugula.    This dish has tons of flavor!

For whatever reason 2 stores didn't have arugula so I swapped in spinach and it was delish. For anyone that says the dish is "underwhelming" or whatnot, I believe that the key to this is a very flavorful sausage. Our local grocer has 50 different scratch made sausages and they're fantastic.

LOVED this recipe. Mine turned out pretty salty so I would definitely make sure to use low sodium chicken broth as the recipe says. I only had normal on hand. Or use 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth, then 2 cups of water. 

The only change I made was add garlic to the first step with the onion, about 1 clove. I've never seen a pasta recipe that has onion but no garlic, and I love garlic so in it went! As people said, this is very forgiving with changes and additions. I would maybe add mushrooms or peppers next time for a new flavor. It's a good base recipe to play off of. 

Will definitely make again and have fun with this recipe!

This is one of my favorite quick, one pan meals.  It's delicious and very satisfying on jammed weekday night.  Sometimes I have to use spinach instead of arugula (because of what's at the market) and it is still yummy.

The only thing I change was adding a little extra arugula. Very tasty recipe.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  It is a huge hit with my family!  A little lengthy but still very easy to make.  I used spinach instead and it is delicious.

I used spinach and loved it. I also couldn't find the same pasta in my local stores but I did find ditallini and it worked wonderfully.

Easy,  quick to prepare, and with way more flavor than the small list of ingredients would indicate. This one is a keeper.

Very tasty!  I sautéed the greens separately since some of my children don't care for them.  Served with garlic bread, it was a quick and delicious weeknight meal.  Thanks!

My husband loved this dish! I doubled the recipe and added 4 fresh cloves of fresh minced garlic after the onion had cooked for a few minutes. I also added 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes to the meat/onion/ garlic mixture and used 2 tablespoons of high quality balsamic vinager to deglaze the pan prior to adding my stock. It's really important to be patient -as stated in the video- and cook the pasta slowly with enough stock to allow it to become al dente. Otherwise the pasta will be gummy. Thank you for another great recipe Chef John!

Really yummy.  I'm glad I watched the video otherwise I would have thought there was too much liquid.  I also added a lot more arugula as Chef John did in the video.  The second time I made it I added spinach.  I didn't like it as well.  Stick with just the arugula. My family liked it, too.

Great easy recipe, even my picky teen daughter liked. I did substitue spinach for arugula, mainly because I'm not a fan of it and I didn't want to spend the money for arugula for such a small amount and toss the rest. Also, I completely forgot broth at the store and wound up using boullion, not the best but it's what I had, and it did come out saltier than I would have liked, but still delicious.

Excellent! But because I didn't have arugula, I substituted broccoli - which turned out very good, especially considering my fussy husband's opinion - he absolutely loved it! Easy, too, but remember what Chef John says: it's not something you can walk away from.

Loved the simplicity, the flavors were wonderful together.  I used half hot, half mild Italian sausage.  I did add mushrooms.  Will use this recipe for friends over.

I made an 8 serving batch.  Took a lot longer to make.  Give yourself about 45 minutes extra to sweat the onions and brown the sausage in one large pot.  Dinner guests loved it!

Love this recipe for the electric skillet I use when camping.  Used mild Italian sausage and added chopped garlic, Italian seasoning and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Used spinach because I couldn't find arugula.  Awesome one pan meal!

Nice recipe.  I subbed elbow pasta, regular chicken broth, and handful of spinach.    The elbow pasta was fine, but the broth made the dish salty (don't do this!).   This spinach just disappeared, need to use a lot more.

But it still came out good!   Will make again,with adjustments.

I made the recipe exactly as stated. I thought it tasted pretty good, but I found the dish to be quite expensive. Maybe next time I will not buy the recommended cheese at $9 a wedge.

Delicious and super easy recipe! Loved this.  I also added about 2 cloves garlic when cooking the onions.  Next time, I think I'll add some broccoli or some other green veggie.  The arugula was so great, but I feel it needed one more thing in there

Excellent! I used hot Italian sausage, spinach instead of Arugula, and Campbell's No Salt Added chicken broth. I couldn't get Orecchiette pasta so I used medium shells. Some reviews stated that they had to precook the pasta - NO NEED TO! If the pasta is not done to your liking, just add more stock!  This is a one pan dish that makes for an easy cleanup! You must pay attention while making this, as it doesn't take long for the liquid to vanish! Makes for a relaxing 15 - 20 minutes. Thanks, Chef John!

I make this dish quite often, however,  since I eat only whole grain pasta  I adapt the cooking method appropriately, but, it is still delicious. I have used the arugala, but have substituted spinach, kale, and even bok choy, depending on what's on sale. Another  thing to remember  is buy a good, less fatty, Italian  sausage or it tastes "fatty" I have also used both ground linguica, or chourica when on sale. [pardon my spelling ]                                                                                                          I also make this without meat, I use 3/4 types of mushrooms, white, brown, and Chinese black, and white porcini the latter two being dried mushrooms, which I rehydrate in stock, which I then use for the pasta. This recipe lends itself to so many options, and variations that it is a staple of mine. It is perfect for a single person meal !

Only 3 minor changes I made were that I subbed spinach (and more of it, about 2 cups) for the arugula, rotini for the orechiette, and home-made veggie stock for the chicken broth. Hubby and I loved it. We forgot all about sprinkling cheese on top, but it was delish without.

I added some garlic for additional flavor that worked nicely. The pasta was somewhat undercooked so I had to make some adjustments to level of heat and cooking time.

this recipe was amazing! my local grocery store didn't have this pasta so I used wheat rotini pasta and it came out really good. I also added spinach and arugula to this. I didn't follow the same measurements and it still came out amazing! Will definitely make again!

This was delicious, even with grocery store Italian sausage; in Miami, if you want decent Italian sausage you have to go to a specialty store.  And talk about easy--the hardest part of preparing this meal was keeping my cat out of the arugula. This definitely is entering my personal list of "favorites." I did use about twice as much arugula as the recipe calls for, because I love it, and will use even more next time. Otherwise I stuck pretty close.

As suggested by a reviewer, I added a whole tub of  baby spinach and precooked the pasta to al dente firmness and added to the mixture at the very end.  Also roasted pine nuts to sprinkle on top at serving.

Super easy one pan dish. Used sweet Italian sausage and added my own red pepper flakes to taste. Also added more arugula. It did seem to need more broth, but I made it with little shells

4 Stars because it is a good place to start...since I added ingredients I cant rate it as is.  I cooked 1/2 large onion, 1/4 c green peppers,  orange peppers (because I had some), and 1 T garlic.  Right before it was done, I added about 1/8 t thyme, 1/8 t fennel seed, and 1/8 t red pepper flakes.  Then removed vegetables & continued with recipe as written, except used spinach.  Of course, don't forget salt and pepper.  It was 5 Stars when I finished with it.  Prepared some garlic toast and yummy!

I used mild Italian sausage instead of hot so this may be why it was so bland tasting.  It was ok just not great.

It was a great base recipe but I used gemelli pasta instead, sweet italian sausage instead of spicy, replaced the arugula with spinach and instead of cooking the pasta in the sauce, I boiled the pasta in seasoned chicken broth before adding it to the sauce,  I spooned a couple ladles of pasta water/broth into the sauce to thicken it a bit, the family loved it! Especially the sausage, it gave the sauce so much flavor! (P.S. Sorry to whoever created this recipe, I didn't mean to take it apart but it  did give me such a great inspiration and direction for my "revised" edition.)

It was good.  Not outstanding.  I substituted spinach.  I cooked the pasta separately for 10 minutes , and added for the last few minutes to the sauce.  I should have waited until the sauce had reduced more before adding the pasta.  Will try it again, but with a tomato based sauce.

Doubled easily. Didn't need nearly as much stock as it called for. A little salty, but I think that was because of the sausage I used. Reheats well. All-around awesome. Can't wait to make it again.

This dish was ok as written, but I added some finely minced garlic in Step #1.  I'm Italian, so there are very few authentic Italian recipes which don't begin with a good quality extra virgin olive oil, and some garlic.  Also, I used our favorite 'lite' sausages (Jennie-O) Turkey Italian Sausages (squeezed out of the casings). They're healthier, & even tastier than the other sausages out there. Also, they're very deliciously seasoned.  I doubled the recipe for our family here at home, but I'll be sure to send your 'original' recipe to our daughter, who is away at college.

It’s a great recipe!  But I’m not fond of arugula, so I use spinach.  Same fantastic results!  My family loves this recipe.  It’s become one of my “go to” recipes.  So easy to make!

LOVED THIS! I have added this to my rotation - it is quick, easy and it makes great leftovers for lunches. I end up using a pound of sausage and an entire box of noodles -but it works. You can add what you have on hand - that makes this great for when you need something quick on a weeknight. I try to keep this stuff on hand and it is quick and one. My spouse loved it as well. The tang of the cheese is great.

This is a delicious recipe. I doubled it to have leftovers. I used better than bouillon for the broth and found it a little too salty so next time I'll use unsalted stock. Also for some reason I added too much liquid even though I used only the 3.5 cups for a double batch so I strained out the sausage and pasta and reduced the liquid before finishing the dish.  I also used kale for the greens and mixed in a half cup of Parmesan and grated extra for serving. A healthy dose of black pepper and a pinch of garlic powder rounded it out. My husband asked me to put this one on regular rotation.***Update I substituted leeks for the onions and used asparagus instead of the arugula and it was great.

We love this dish.  I especially like it because it's versatile; use any pasta (rotini, shells), sausage (sweet, chorizo, maple) or green (spinach, kale) you have on hand.  It always comes out great and my kids wipe the bowl clean!!!

Super easy and very good. My gf and her daughter liked it very much too.  I  used a little more sausage than called for and I wish I had used more arugula. I did add some garlic cloves to the onion while sauteing, and a little italian spice.  The one thing I wish I had done was to drain the fat from the pot after cooking the sausage... there was too much fat.  I will make this again though - everyone said it was a keeper!

I liked this one, as did my significant other.  Just like others around this web site, I made a few changes.  I'm not a huge fan of spicy, so I used mild chicken sausage.  The chicken sausage idea came about because it was what I saw first at the store.  Also, I used spinach instead of arugula because the rest of the bag of spinach is more usable in my house than arugula.  I threw in a few diced Roma tomatoes as well.  I didn't find orrecchiette pasta; instead I used pipette.  That may have affected the cooking time.  Everything else I left the same.  I think I might try it with regular pork sausage next time.

So easy and such a forgiving recipe! I didn't actually measure any of the ingredients, used kale instead of arugula, and ran out of chicken stock , so half the liquid was vegi stock. It still turned out delicious!

Loved this recipe!  Extremely simple to make and very flavorful.  I added a handful of sundried tomatoes, extra arugula, and sliced sauteed zucchini.  Will surely make again.

Would use low sodium chicken broth and cut out the salt.   I found this recipe VERY salty when made strictly as stated.  May be due to the high sodium content of the sausages.  Will also get a saltiness from the parmesan cheese.
Will definitely make again with the above notes changes.  Have excellent potential.  May try substitute spinach as well!!

This was very good.  Used sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy (personal preference).  Also used escarole in place of arugula because I could not find any arugula at the supermarket for some reason.  I leave out the minced onion and  double the recipe for my family and add 2tbsp minced garlic to sausage mixture while sautéing and 1 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp black pepper to broth.

I've made it numerous times including while I was a guest at my sister's home. It's easy and delicious. The only changes I make at times is the type of pasta since the orecchiette is more expensive than others and not every brand makes it. My favorite is mafalda or campanelle (pretty much the same just one is San Gorgio and the other Barilla).

Outstanding!! The pasta took a little longer because I wanted to make sure none of the orecchiette had 'nested' with each other- this has happened to me before and they don't get cooked all the way. I loved how creamy this dish turned out! Followed it o the letter and the arugula added a great bite of pepper. Delicious! Thanks, Chef John!!

What an easy weeknight(or any night) dinner! I absolutely loved providing my family a quality and delicious dinner...and it was simply done from one skillet! 
About preparation:  I would recommend lowering heat a bit after initial boil. I had to let pasta cook longer than recipe suggested--no biggie-- but I think it added to incredible flavor. I would also suggest adding more arugula. I got this from Allrecipes magazine and it suggested adding roughly 1 cup. You'll appreciate that peppery flavor it adds:) Also, the cheese...add more cheese to your liking. It was  an amazing finish to the dish. Oh yum! Thanks, Chef John

Excellent recipe!  I modified the proportions and some ingredients by using 1 pound of ground Italian sausage, 12 oz pkg of Farfalle bowtie pasta, 1-14.5 oz can, and 1-32.5 oz carton of chicken broth, and 12 oz pkg of frozen spinach, crushed red pepper, and Italian seasoning to taste. It took 25 minutes to cook.

I doubled the recipe to get 4 servings, so used a 1 lb box of orechiette pasta.   Added some red pepper flakes in with the sauteeing onion and sausage plus subbed fresh baby spinach for the arugula.  Next time I will use more  fresh spinach and will use turkey or chicken italian sausage to cut down on the fat.  But very tasy - nice comfort food.

I used kale but it might have been better to precook the kale or used spinach in it' stead.  I loved the taste though.

Don't know how I missed that the serving size was set to 2, but was able to quickly increase ingredients to compensate. Used chicken sausage, Tuscan Kale and garlic. Chicken sausage doesn't break apart like pork sausage, so it needs to be cut up. Also might not create the brown bits to scrape up, but still good. Big hit with the entire family.

Yum! I cooked the pasta and the sausage separately , and just added it all together in the end with some pasta water, spices and lots of extra greens (any kind). Turned out great

So I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical while this was cooking. It just didn't look like it was coming together the way it was supposed to. However by the time I added the spinach (I didn't have arugula), I was feeling a lot better about it. I also doubled the Italian sausage, because why not.

I made this following the recipe.  It was ok.  But I probably won't make it again.  It was much to heavy and salty.  Perhaps because I used chicken bouillon instead of broth.

A bit salty but not in a bad way. I really like the uniqueness of flavors, and the hamburger makes a fine contrast with the broth. I've never tried anything like this. Great meal!

I've made this recipe twice now and it's gone so fast!!!! I need to make a double or even triple batch. Two teenage boys could each have eaten all of it. I used spinach instead and I can never get them to eat spinach. They love this recipe. It's really easy to do.

This was tasty but to salty. I used reduced fat low sodium chicken stock as well. I will make it again but will try with half stock/broth and water.  It was a very easy recipe to make and I used spinach instead of arugala since that is what I had on hand. Served with a nice healthy salad which did help balance out the salt from the meal.

Delicious, easy recipe. Seriously easy. I subbed in medium shell shaped pasta and it turned out great. I'd guess that it took a little less time to cook, since the shells pasta is thinner than the Orchette pasta. Just a note, remember to make the effort to MEASURE your concentrated stock paste, if making your own instead of using canned/boxed premade stock. Mine was WAY WAY too salty as a result of my own error. But the flavor was tasty and truly was easy to put together. Beautiful dish in the end. Will def use canned stock next time, but will def make again!!

My entire family thought it was a delicious meal.  WE made 2 times the meal for our family (4) because the meal didn't serve that many.  It also turned out more soupy than expected, but was still very tasty.  Can't wait to eat it again!

My family loved this! I doubled the recipe and mixed half spicy Italian sausage with half mild Italian Sausage. I also added a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and cubed zucchini and squash.

It was delicious!! I made everything according to the directions exactly as written (except using a different pasta because I couldn't find the ear pasta). It was so easy to make and to clean up since it was just one pan! The flavors were really deep and full with the simmering cooking method. I can't usually spicy food but the flavors of the spicy sausage was just the right amount of flavor and spice. It was perfect! Definitely recommend and will make again...probably next week!

I can't say enough about how good this recipe is. It's a family staple now. I typically follow the recipe faithfully, sometimes swapping out arugula for spinach.

This is a very good but not great recipe for my fsmily tastes.. I made this dish exactly as posted.  It is simple to make and chef John's  usual excellent video make this dish a paint by number portrait on how to cook the dish.  I think me and my family would been happier with a more complex flavor profile. 

I like the concept of the recipe. think I will make again  with the following modifications   adding some garlic, using spinach instead of arugula with some tomato presence. I would also use a combination of sweet and spicy sausage...

Great recipe! I added more pasta as I cooked. The dish is so delicious it isn't enough to feed four hungry people, so the added pasta is necessary.

Just finished  a double helping of this!  Like magic, it thickens and has the greatest taste!  The real plus for us is pasta with no tomato sauce in site.  I rely on these reviews and suggestions for substitutes and alternative measurement.  I used kale, but other than that followed as written, which I try to do the first time I make a recipe. Then if I get an inspirational idea, I improvise next time

Easy and delicious! I love making one pot recipes during the work week- the less dishes the better! I used a whole onion, more garlic and added some red pepper flakes and a can of diced tomatoes. Mixed in the asiago cheese, so yummy!

Definitely a great one pot meal!  I've made it a couple of times now.  Great as leftovers for the week!    I used the broccoli rabe and made it one time with spinach.  Both were great.  I added extra sausage for my guys.  Other than that, stayed true to the recipe.

Loved it! Very easy to prepare. Added more arugula to my dish since I love  veggies. Next time, wouldn't add any salt to preparation since lots of salt in Italian sausage already. Thank you for this great recipe!

After recovering from sticker shock of  the price of orecchiette  pasta at my local Albertsons --Followed this recipe to spec, except for using fresh spinach in place of arugula.
 Gave it five stars as it  turned out to be every bit as yummy as Chef John said it would!  That broth reduced down into thee most delectable sauce – –A more than pleasant surprise! We were wowed! This recipe is perfect for dinner guests too. Served with a nice salad  and pumpernickel bread ~  this is a keeper! Thanks Chef John --Will make this again and again!

A few minor tweaks I made - I substituted the arugula for spinach and doubled the amount, and added halved cherry tomatoes (about 3.75 oz. per serving). Also, I was using leftover (and thus pre-cooked) pasta, so I wasn't using as much chicken broth.

Do pay attention to the use of a quality low sodium broth. Other than that sage advice this was a simple but elegant dish that even our Mr. Picky liked. My fourth grader made this for us with limited supervision. Nice technique of simmering the pasta and adding broth as needed. Pasta really does pick up the flavors.

I made this and my family lived it!  I'm all about one pot meals and this was a great and easy one! I used Swiss chard instead of arugula because it's what I had on hand. It was a perfect and easy substitution. We had just enough left f to send for lunch with my husband the next day.

No changes. I didn't  have any arugula so I used spinach. It was the deepest flavour of any pasta dish I have ever had. Our friends raved about it for days.

My husband, who is not a pasta lover, raved about this!  He said I could make it any time.  I didn't use the orecchiette pasta, but used brown rice elbow noodles.  I substituted spinach for the arugula, and used ground spicy sausage, and also about 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I also added 3 minced garlic cloves. It was excellent!!!  Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

The dish was such a big hit I made the dish a  second time doubling the ingredients. I could have reduced the chicken broth by a 1/3 of a cup , therefore not cooking as long to keep the pasta aladante

I substituted italian spicy sausage with spicy chicken sausage,  and couldn't  find any grown up aragula so I used the baby just didnt chop up. I also added a little mazzorella cheese while adding in aragula. It came out really good. My husband said "don't be afraid to make that again". A++++ Chef John! Thank you. Added note...he also loved the "gravy" ??

Super quick and delicious!  I doubled the recipe for 2 teenaged boys and myself and it was a hit!   I had no issues with the pasta cooking to perfection in the pan (used a whole box of Barilla brand). Next time I will add even more arugula. Fantastic flavor!

The receipe was easy enough but even using  low sodium stock, it was way too salty. I'd try again but use lean ground beef or turkey sausage.

Great dish. I had sweet Italian sausage, so I added some crushed red pepper to spice it up.

This was so easy and delish!   I couldn't  find arugula but I found a marked down container of super greens and they worked just fine.  Cooked the pasta for a good 30 minutes...next time I will boil rather than simmer.   All in all a great one pan recipe.

I'm not fond of spicy Italian sausage so I used mild and substituted raw spinach.  The pasta takes longer to cook than on the package.  But it was really good.   It made me think of Italian Wedding soup, less broth.  Very easy to make.

This is an excellent recipe with great flavor combinations!  I borrowed a trick from another favorite recipe of mine, and added dried fennel along with the sausage.It was a nice addition!  As other reviewers suggested,  I precooked the pasta until just al dense and finished it off in about half of the broth listed in the recipe. I added Italian seasoning, a dash more of salt and wilted an entire container of baby arugula into the mixture at the end! This dish will be in my rotation!

Each time I make this I am surprised how much my family likes it because it is so simple.  I added some crushed red pepper and garlic to kick up the spice.  Would be good using white wine as part of liquid too.

I used turkey sausage instead of Italian sausage and I still thought it was really good. Probably not something kids would like though. I used spinach instead of arugula and regular small shell pasta.

Oh this was great, got to love a one pot meal! I only changed it do to preference, health and what I had on hand. I used Italian seasoned ground turkey to lower the fat, fresh spinach, basil, kale and chard because it's what I had on hand plus family not a fan of arugula (which is unfortunate for me). We enjoyed it and will make again! Might add some red pepper flakes for a flavor kick.

I made this on the weekend and it was delicious. I added a few more "ears" , sausage, and broth and it was fantastic. A few ears got toasted and reminded me of pot stickers. Great taste, easy to make.

I added chopped garlic with the onions & a little pepper.  For a family of four, 5 sausage links & another 1/2-3/4 cup noodles is perfect.  I also doubled the arugula, as it really cooks down to a small amount quickly.  Came out delicious, but rich, so I would drain half the sausage grease next time for a lighter sauce.

Think there is a typo in the recipe-- think it should be 1 1/2 cups  vs 1/2 cup of arugula -- look at chef Johns video-- what he is putting in is a lot more than 1/2 cup arugula

Taste was wonderful

I will do this again in 3 days with the  1 1/2 cup of arugula

I made  this last night and we thought it was delicious! Unfortunately, I thought that it wouldn't be spicy enough, so I added red pepper flakes and it turned out a little too spicy for my husband. We liked it though, so I will be making this again and again, without the added heat. Thanks, Chef John!

I have made it twice and both times it was very good and easy.
I used spinach once and arugula once and added a bit more than the recipe called for (twice as much actually - it cooks down a lot).  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This is a very, very similar recipe to Giada's Orecchiette with turkey sausage and broccoli rabe recipe, which I usually make. You can't go wrong with either. With Giada's you still get pretty full flavor without the onions or broth. 
My kids & husband always love it when I make this. It's quick for those busy nites and I usually have all the ingredients on hand, except for the broccoli rabe or arugula. I generally sub in regular broccoli (lots of it) or fresh spinach.  Enjoy!!

I made this but mixed the recipe with another, similar, recipe. It had a little too much of a glutinous texture, which I think was my fault for mixing recipes. Excellent flavor. Will definitely make it again and follow this recipe more closely next time.

Made this for dinner last night. The video was easy to follow. I did find it to be a little too salty for my taste (eventhough I used the low sodium broth and just a pinch of salt) but overal, it was good. I did add a little bit of oregano, dried parsley flakes and 4 garlic cloves. Boyfriend liked it so much, he had seconds. Oh and I did use "mild" italian sausage, not the hot that the receipt calls for. Boyfriend added hot sauce to his. Was the first time I made a pasta dish without boiling the pasta first and it was a nice/different touch. Served it with tomato/avocado/red onion salad with oil/vinegar dressing. I'd give this a 3.75-4 stars. I'd prob make it again.

This is a great recipe to make in a pinch.  Delicious and easy.  Recently, I've made a couple of changes and the family has loved it.  I added garlic with the onion in the beginning.  Then, at the end, I swapped the arugula for basil and quartered cherry tomatoes.

My 5 yr old said this was her new favorite meal. I did make 2 changes. First, used regular ground pork, not spicy. 2nd I used broccoli since that's what i had. I cooked it the last 5-6 minutes in with the broth, noodles and pork. So good. It's already on the family menu again in 2 weeks.

Friday is usually left over night. I had seen this recipe before during my many searches at all-recipes and decided to give it a try.  Didn't change anything, wasn't sure about the arugula because I haven't tasted it before. Thought about substituting spinach but didn't. I will make this again.

We love this recipe and I make it often. The only changes I made was to add diced mushrooms and used spinach instead. It's easy and tastes like something you'd get in an expensive Italian restaurant. Thanks Chef John.

Had a very difficult time finding orecchiette pasta at my local grocery , so substituted shells. Took a little bit longer than chef john's did to cook, but still turned out beautifully. Would make this again!!

Loved it!  Super fast, super easy.  I used a whole box of orecchiette with a full pound of spicy poultry sausage, adjusted the broth as needed, and added additional arugula.  It was a hit with my family!!!  Thank you Chef John!  Your recipes are fabulous!

Quick and easy!  Use lots of arugula and cheese. The soup stock adds tons of flavour!

This is a favorite in our house! i use a full pound of sausage, or chicken Italian sausage works well, a whole box of shells pasta (finding the orecchiette was hard!), a few handfuls of arugula, and a whole box of chicken broth. Its super easy, yummy, and filling.

I only picked this recipe because I love this type of pasta and I've never seen it specifically used before. This was so easy to make and it was delicious! We didn't have any low-sodium broth so it was a little salty, but that's easily remedied. We also doubled the arugula but both agreed that you could have used even more. Doubling this recipe next time for some yummy leftovers.

I definitely loved the simplicity with this recipe! I ended up using a full onion, added 2 tbsp of chopped garlic and 3 tbsp of butter. Turned out wonderful and I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this with medium shells, and added goat cheese instead of Parmesan. So good! The sausage added a lot of flavor.

Awesome!  The only sub I make is using chicken or turkey sausage to cut down on fat, and red-pepper flakes to give it the heat.  This one gets gobbled down fast on a cold evening.
To put it over the top, I also make a half batch of the Sriracha Biscuits from this site.  Mmmm... total comfort-food bliss!  Update: Can't find arugula?  Use baby spinach instead!

This dish has become a regular around our place. I've made it as is and also with baby spinach, kale, Swiss chard they all work great for us. And best of all, it takes no time at all. A super meal for the work week.

No changes except whatever I have like spinach or broccoli rape in place of arugula some times.  I make this all the time.  It's sooooo satisfying.

Super easy and tastes great. Be sure to use regular pan (not non-stick) to get all the bits at the bottom. And feel free to load up on the arugula (the kids can't even taste it).

I've made this several times, and I love it.  It's easily more than two servings- I usually get 4-5 out of it (but I probably also use more arugula than the recipe calls for).  I usually add some red pepper flakes and halved grape tomatoes.

My best suggestion if you're going to have leftovers is not to add the arugula while it's cooking. I cook the pasta, noodles and tomatoes, and broth, then spoon the hot mixture over the greens. Otherwise your leftovers might be slimy.

roommate and boyfriend loved this dish. I used spicy and sweet Italian sausage and used this recipe as a bit of a guide (I didn't follow the prep instructions and wound up using two pans - one to sauté onions and brown the sausage, and another to prep the pasta). I used different amounts of ingredients (I eyeballed and added to taste) mostly because I simply prefer to cook that way and, let's face it, this particular recipe just begs to be turned in to leftovers and brought to the office.

Delicious!  My picky husband and teen-age boys all loved it.  They liked it so much I made it twice in the same week.  

Adjustments:
I doubled the arugula and added between 1/2 to a cup of heavy cream at the end and added an additional 1/4 cup parmesan. Some adjustments to the seasonings to taste.

Great recipe...I love one pot meals!!!

This was AMAZING. Followed the recipe exactly, only difference being I used sweet sausage and not hot/spicy.  My whole family devoured it. As someone else said, this was like a dish you'd get at a restaurant. Remarkable quality for such easy prep. 

My only caveat would be the serving size yield. When using the amounts suggested in the recipe, we had just enough for 3 rather scant (but completely satisfying) servings. If you have > 3 people I'd start multiplying the proportions. Other that that, absolutely perfect. Thanks to Chef John!...this dish goes into our rotation.

Very good, tasty.  Second time I made it with ground turkey instead of pork.  I love arugula, but baby spinach or kale works well also.  And I liked precooking the pasta al dente before adding, even if this is an extra step.  The first time without the precooking, the pasta was a little too chewy and underdone.

I liked it. I couldn't use the arugula because it wasn't fresh enough so I tossed it. I just used frozen spinach instead. I did not find it salty at all, nor bland, no did I find the pasta "gummy". It's a keeper recipe for me!

EASY GOOD  I just cut sausage in small pieces . I added mushrooms and green chick peas. It needs all the liquid if not a little bit more so add more at beginning. Served with bread. We enjoyed.

This is simple to make.and delicious. My husband really enjoyed it.  I had chicken stock, not broth, so it may have been a bit more intense. Next time, I may try with 1/2 sweet and 1/2 spicy sausage.  There is a local restaurant that makes a pasta dish with sausage that my husbands loves .... I think this is it! They add fresh steamed little neck clams in the shell for a nice presentation!

Edits: I added 2 cloves of garlic, used a whole onion, added a red pepper for color and added 1/2 cup more pasta. 

Challenges: Too much liquid. Ladled out 4 times. I would use a cup less liquid since we like our pasta al dente. The pasta was heading toward overdone.  Overall, it was blander than expected. 

It was good and easy. I would make it again if I didn't have time/groceries.

Great comfort food!!  Delicious and easy to make.  Added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and used more arugula, as well as kale -- just 'cause I could!!  Another Chef John winner.  (Wife doesn't like "spicey", so used sweet mild Italian sausage, but then sprinkled red pepper flakes on my serving.  Worked great.)

Really good easy meal! I changed 2 things about recipe. I par cooked my pasta (needed less chicken broth) and used fresh spinach instead of arugula. The flavor profile is mild but I think you can add whatever spice/herb you desire!

Quick and easy and turned out great! It will be great for a quick after work dinner and it's the perfect amount for two.

Very good.  I added more arugula than recommended.  Other than that, I made it to the recipe..

Very easy recipe with few ingredients!  It also didn't take long to make.  I didn't have spicy sausage on-hand, so I used 5 mild, sweet sausages instead.  The result left me with a tasty, yet pretty salty dish.  I recommend sticking with the original sausage mentioned in the recipe, or know what kind of sausage you may be using to avoid the saltiness at the end.  Also, keep an eye on the pasta and broth to make sure the pasta is cooked properly.  Mine ended up not being as tender as I would've liked, so next time, I will use more chicken broth in my mixture.  Overall, I liked the recipe and would make it again.  I thought it had a pretty rich flavor even though few ingredients were involved.

Made with veggie mixed variety pasta and frozen spinach because it is what I had on hand. Otherwise made as directed. Lots of layers to the flavor and delicious! Easy and limited cleanup.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe 4 time now and it's a very simple dish. I  used rotini instead of orchestra added mushrooms and red peppers (roasted) and it was excellent. I'd recommend this dish to the novice cook. It will make a hit!!

This is a fantastic dish.  Our whole family loved it, even the picky eaters.  I had to use spinach instead of arugula, as it was what I had on hand, and it was delicious.  Splurge for a higher quality parmesan cheese for this dish... you can definitely taste the difference and it's totally worth it.

This is one of the few recipes that both my son & husband love! They will both have any left-overs (if any) the next day for lunch - and this is the only recipe that they both agree is perfect. I double the recipe to make sure there is enough for at least dinner.

Simple, easy and delicious. Only one thing I will change the next time I will make it again i have used low sodium chicken broth but it came out salty, so next time I will add water to cook the pasta and only a little bit of low sodium chicken broth.

This recipe was extremely simple and hit the spot. I added pine nuts before serving, and cooked the onion with the sausage. Perfect for anyone looking for something easy, without compromising great flavor. Definitely a Thursday night hit.

Yummy! No need for additional salt. Loved the texture and bitterness of the Arugula. My son & husband loved it! You must be patient - I doubled the servings so I was stirring for an additional 10/12 mins to cook the pasta properly. The last bit of liquid I used was filters water... I sounds even with low sodium quality chicken stock it would have been too salty if I kept adding it.

Delicious and simple to make..  I subbed Arugula for Kale which gave the veggie some substance. The sausage gave the dish a nice little kick.
We loved it and would definitely make it again.

This was wonderful but I did find the orecchiette pasta to thick and gummy. I made it again with a thinner type of pasta and it was wonderful. Everything in the recipe was great  except the thick pasta.

Simple enough recipe. I cut back on the arugula, added in spinach and mushrooms, and used red onions. Mixed audience reaction, but to be fair you can't always please children and teens. Lol!

I have made this numerous times. Everyone loves  it. Be sure to use lower sodium broth. I made that mistake once. So, yummy! We love it with spicy sausage. We usually make a double batch and about 3- 4 cups of greens.

This dish is amazing!  Everyone in the family loves it.  They go back for second and third helpings!  I like it best the first day but everyone else likes it equally as much as leftovers. ..the only change we made was adding grape tomatoes.

I have made this twice. The first time I made the big mistake of not using low-sodium chicken broth and it was WAY too salty. The second time, I followed the recipe nearly exactly and doubled it for my family of four (very necessary) and everyone loved it. The only very minor changes were that I added a little bit of oregano, and I mixed a little water in with the broth when adding to the boiling pasta.  It was perfect! Great dinner  with some garlic bread and a salad, and so easy!

This was really tasty; I didn't find it bland at all, although I did add about 1/2 tsp thyme, as I had some drying on the counter.  I did use sweet italian sausage instead of mild and I added 16 oz. of pasta (the whole bag, essentially).  I just added extra chicken stock to compensate for the pasta.

Easy and delicious! I didn't realize the servings were for only 2 so I'm glad I had enough ingredients on hand. Used one package of hot Italian turkey sausage. Added garlic after it had cooked. About 4 cups of the pasta and maybe 5 to 6 cups of broth. Also added additional red pepper flakes. We like heat! The arugula was delicious, I want to add a lot more the next time.

I've made this a few times and it has turned out great every time.  I buy spicy Italian sausage from our local butcher and it makes a huge difference vs grocery store Italian sausage.  
The first time I cooked this I couldn't find orecchiette pasta so I used gnocchi pasta (it wasn't traditional gnocchi) and that was good too!  Cooking the pasta in chicken broth adds a really nice richness that I have now duplicated in other recipes.  If I have it I stir in a 1/4 cup or less of heavy cream at the end and I like it that way also.  If you don't have arugula use fresh basil leaves!! 
Leftovers are GREAT!! 
Thank you Chef John.

We all really loved this and the leftovers were eaten up the next day.  I used organic chicken sausage and also added garlic but otherwise followed the recipe.  Loved the Arugula and its flavor!  I doubled everything to make four servings.  Also, my Publix carries the pasta used in the recipe for anyone who shops there.

Yummy, quick dish for the week nights. I love the one pot approach as it's easy to make and less for me to clean! I used frozen (thawed and drained) spinach instead of the arugula and really liked the color, flavor and the hidden nutrients! I also used 1/2 mild and 1/2 spicy sausage for a nicely spiced and balanced dish. I would make this again and perhaps add some tomatoes or fresh herbs on top!

I read the previous comments and added 2 cloves of garlic and fresh pepper. I would not add any additional salt to it! I couldn't purchase the suggested pasta and bought farfelle pasta instead which worked great! Loved the recipe!

So easy. So yummy!  I do strongly advise not adding any salt. I'm a saltaholic, and the first time I made it it was really salty, even for me. This is the second time and it was perfect. I think the sausage must have salt in it.

This is delicious. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. Then, I experimented to make it a bit more Northern Italian. I steeped dry porcini mushrooms in a cup of the broth to reconstitute them and used gnocchi boiled per package instructions instead of pasta. I added the steeped porcinis to the whole mix. The gnocchi thickened it so it can be served on a plate.  YUM !

Pretty good. I substituted mushrooms for the sausage and it came out alright. Probably way better with sausage though.

Absolutely delicious. Cooked as directed. Only difference was that I used jalapeno sausage (I only use fresh sausage made by a local business) and fresh spinach since I had those on hand. Will definitely make again. Another Awesome recipe from Chef John!

Made recipe as is except used a spinach/arugula mix.  I thought it was very easy, elegant and guest worthy.  Serve with crusty bread, and maybe a salad and that's all you need.

Made this again and used thawed and drained frozen spinach and added a can of Italian chopped tomatoes, just reduced the broth and used one can.  I think it's a little more hearty and pretty with the spinach and tomatoes.  Still tastes awesome and it's so easy.

A+ for taste and presentation (especially w/ red pepper flakes)! Looks spectacular on the plate. It was surprisingly rich and heavy, though—didn't need to double the recipe!

As a base recipe it's OK, but as others have suggested it's a bit bland without adding a few flavors/ items/procedures to the recipe up front AND making sure one uses high quality very low sodium chicken stock -- either home made or very high quality store bought. Indeed chef John recommends using homemade stock. 

The stock is the key here so if you mess that up the sauce is either going to be a salt lick or really bland.  The starches in the pasta will absorb the stock, but in that process they also encapsulate it making it necessary to have a few more flavors there to elevate the whole profile a bit.  

I made the following alterations: 
- About 1/3 more onion 
- Used home made low sodium chicken stock 
- In a sauce pot added 1 slightly crushed garlic clove to 3.5 cups stock and brought to boil/simmer then added 1/2tsp. red pepper flakes (making it a two pot process but the results are better). Keep on low simmer to draw from for adding to the pasta cooking pan. 
- Slice 5-6 crimini mushrooms and add to onion near their mid point of cooking
- When finished remove onions and mushrooms and place into a bowl then return the pan back to stove bring back to temp and add sausage to the pan and brown making a deep brown fond
- Deglaze pan with 1/3 cup decent white wine and reduce by 1/2
- Add 2 cups chicken stock to pan and bring to high simmer 
- Add onions and mushrooms back into the pan and stir
- Add orecchiette and stir 
- Add more stock as needed much like risotto

OMG - YUM! I had no idea that so simple and few ingredients would taste so good! My only advice is to double the recipe as it is not enough for a family of four.

Loved this! Used ground chicken and baby spinach instead of sausage and arugula. My family devoured it! I did add salt to taste, (about 2 tsp. because I tripled the recipe to feed 6) and one large clove of garlic when I was sautéing the onions...

Made this for the 2nd time. I skipped the sausage in casings. Instead I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground mild Italian sausage. This time around, my green was fresh spinach leaves,  so I stirred them in just before serving. Never fails to please.

This was a good dish that has made it into our dinner rotation. It's a great one pot meal that even my kids will eat. A nice departure from regular old pasta & sauce. I have made this several times experimenting with the protein. I have to say that mild/spicy Italian sausage gives it the best flavor, but it's good with other proteins as well.

Made this the other night and was not only  amazed at how easy it was to make and how yummy, but also how few utensils it required.  It is literally a "One Pot Pasta"  dish!   My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is equally delicious as a left over!

Easy and delicious weeknight meal! I double it for my husband and I (we're big eaters), add some bird's eye chili for heat, and replace the arugula with a pound of kale to make it a little more substantial.

Simply delicious ! This pasta dish is cooked like a risotto. So, it's important to have a good quality broth.
Because of dietary restrictions, when a dish calls for sausage, I use ground beef or ground turkey with sausage spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes and ground fennel seeds).So, this time I doubled the recipe using  ground beef with the mentioned spices  and a whole 6 OZ bag of baby Spinach.

I am a horrible cook and this recipe made me look like I'm an awesome cook. I substituted the sausage for ground bison. I also didn't have low sodium broth. I used regular and it came out perfect! It was simple and came out so tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe

Lots of stirring and attention but makes it a quick dish that everyone loved. Used low sodium chicken broth. You may need to drain it so it is not too soupy. Pasta with out the tomato sauce. Add a side salad and your ready to serve.

I added green peppers as well as the onion.  I only had sweet sausage so I used that.  Also couldn't find Orecchiette pasta so I used medium shell pasta.  I had to double the recipe to accommodate 4 people.  This recipe only seemed sufficient to feed 2.  Added a side of asparagus.  Delicious!!

Easy! I added a little bit of red pepper at the end and used the HOT Italian sausage because I like it a little more spicy.  It was quick, delicious, and doesn't call for many ingredients!

Definitely a keeper !! My family enjoyed it.  However,  I made the mistake of using the whole box of pasta. I had to add  about 3 cups of water.  It still came out yummy but next time I'll double the broth.

I followed the recipe as written (except I used a spinach/arugula mix) and it was just perfect!  Easy to make, easy to clean up, and my teen boys loved it!  Okay, well, they weren't terribly fond of the arugula part, but it's essential to the balance of flavors so I think they would have missed it if it weren't there.  Love the texture of the orecchiette -- that's one I don't normally buy.  Will definitely make again.

This  was great! I didn't have low sodium broth and just rolled with regular chicken broth, thinking it would be no big deal.. I was wrong- It was too salty! Next time, I will add a lot more arugula and be sure to either use chicken stock, or no-sodium broth. Other than my own mistake- this was a fantastic recipe! Will definitely make again and again!

This was tasty, would have been better if I got the spicy sausage as directed. *doh* we doubled the recipe so we'd have enough for lunches, no complaints.

This was tasty but not a big hit with the family. I think that it probably could be a three star, but I was really the only one who liked it and I like everything lol. Also, make sure that you use a proper sized pan so that all the noodles can be covered and cook so there are not some chewy ones. Oh, and most people (not me cause I liked it the way it was) added alfredo to it and said it was better that way.

Anything that my kids will eat and actually say "this is really good" gets 5 stars.  I was worried about it being too spicy so i used half spicy sausage and half regular Italian sausage.  Otherwise, I made it just as the recipe states and used the servings calculator to increase the recipe amounts required.  (It sounded like it was going to be way too much broth, but it was perfect).  Easy to make and the leftovers were eaten too.

I made this changing only the greens. I used spinach instead. I used Progresso Tuscany Chicken broth and followed the directions using bulk Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage. I was SO salty that we couldn't eat it. I added no salt or pepper, just can't understand where all that salt came from. I've used Progresso Tuscany broth before with success.

Really enjoyed this! I used a different pasta I had on hand and turkey sausage. I added garlic little basil and parsley. Quite tasty! Followed advice about not adding much salt and I'm glad I did! Next time I'm trying spinach. Thank you for this. It's a keeper!

This was tasty, I read several reviews before I made it, I used 3/4 of a large onion (I'm cooking for a family with mostly men ;) so I made a larger amount) and added garlic and some Italian seasoning. Using hot Italian sausage I'm glad I didn't add anything like red pepper flakes the heat was perfect, I drained the sausage very well, and due to someone mentioning cooking pasta this way would make it "floury" I cooked the pasta in the chicken broth several minutes before putting the sausage and onion & garlic back in. I didn't have arugula but had Swiss chard and "deveined" that and I would cook this again!

I made this only I doubled the sausage and I used Ditalini pasta. For the pasta and arugula I just eyeballed the amounts as I was making it. I used regular sausage and added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper as another cook suggested.
My husband said this is a keeper.  Next time I make this I am going to add fresh mushrooms.

My husband and I loved it. A definite comfort food. I made it with mild Italian sausage since spicy is too much for me and it was still full of flavor with a little bite. I added extra broth because I didn't feel like putting it away and at first I thought it was going to be a soup but most of it was soaked up and became a nice creamy sauce.  Next time I will add more arugula-amount pretty sparce and can't really taste it.

I followed the recipe (except I added some celery to the onions). It was wonderful. I used homemade chicken stock. Be patient and allow the pasta to absorb the chicken stock as stated in the recipe. Resist the urge to add more cheese, it will not help the recipe. Also for the sausage I used organic chicken sausage - which reduced the fat content.

This recipe is great and a good 'hearty' easy dinner. I, however, botched it. 
So just in case you are tempted to do the same, here's what happened: I am not a fan of Low Sodium chicken broth.(Let alone space in the fridge for all those stupid cartons)
 I use those jars of Better than Boullion paste that I make broths from. Do NOT use 3 teaspoons + 3 cups of water for this recipe! It came out delicious, but so salty that we couldn't finish and both ended up too scared to try to fix it. I advise that you use maybe 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of the paste and 3 cups of water. Then, for the love, taste a big spoonful-after it has reduced down twice-and adjust it before you serve it. (I tasted one bite, and so so flavourful I thought it was perfect. That doesn't translate to a bowlful.)

Since I do not care for arugula I was going to use fresh baby spinach. Unfortunately, I forgot to buy it.  I made it anyway. It truly is an unforgiving recipe. Also found my fresh grated cheese had gone moldy, so I used old fashioned romano cheese out of a shaker can. I added a little minced garlic and some italian seasoning also I used italian seasoned turkey sausage in bulk.

I added mushrooms, fresh garlic.   I also added a basil chiffonade at the end.   Refrigerated, reheated, was awesome.   The flavors needed to mingle and absorb in my opinion.  My boyfriend loved it!!

We loved this dish! I used chicken sausages instead of pork, and elbows instead of orrichietti, and the dish was delicious! I'd use a little more arugula than just a quarter cup, to give the recipe a little more "kick". So wonderful to make it all in one pot!!

My local grocer didn't have arugula, so I subbed kale, or orecchiette, so I used mini bow ties.  Also added some fresh tomatoes for color.  It was delicious, will definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as Chef John showed.  It was delicious!  Next time I might use a different pasta, just because those orecchiettes stick together so much.  But my husband and I both loved it!  I will definitely make this again and again!

This silky sauce is truly a  treat. No salt is needed at least for my taste. A simple heart warming dish. Serve with something clear and crisp, or bold and baudacious.  Either way it's a grown up dish no skills needed.

I would make this again.
The only thing I changed was the cooking of the pasta.  I know it would have been even better had a cooked the pasta in the chicken stock but I didn't have a pan large enough for the 4 portions.  I boiled the pasta al dente and then used a spider to transfer the pasta to the simmering sausage and onion.  I reserved a cup of the pasta water and added it gradually while adding the arugula.  The end result was beautifully creamy.  
I would make this again - no hesitation.

I made a double recipe to feed the family.  It seemed almost too simple but surprise, it was a tasty meal.  I didn't have orecchiette so used small shells and a can of cannelloni beans to make it hardier.  Next time I will double the amount of arugula.  Served with garlic multi-grain bread. Yum! Pure comfort food.

Instead of arugula, try broccoli rabe, but do not add the orecchiette until the broccoli rabe is almost ready to serve.  Some like the broccoli rabe with plenty of crunch left, some like it cooked well, your choice.  If you make broccoli rabe often, and have left-overs, simply cook the orecchiete  in the left-over juices after the broccoli rabe is removed - be sure to leave all of the broccoli "bits" in the juice

This was a big hit with our family. My husband cooked it (yes, he cooks) last night. Although it is one pan and easy to make, it is a half hour standing over the stove. He used medium macaroni shells because our local store didn't have the oriecchette. He used a locally made (Graziano Bros.) Italian sausage. He also used a half cup of arugula, and I think he could have doubled it. The three of us ate it all!

This recipe was as uncomplicated as it gets. I did get a little worried when the pasta didn't cook as fast as I thought it would, but just a few more minutes in the pan solved the problem. I used hot sausage  and added a little bit of minced garlic and it was delicious. I will be making this one again in the future for sure.

I used mild Italian sausage (12 oz package), added 2 seeded and diced Roma tomatoes and about 2 cups of torn spinach. My picky 10yo son declared this a hit!

Like others, I substituted fresh spinach for the arugula and it was terrific. We don't eat cheese and it was super delicious without it.  This recipe made me look good!

Great dish, quick and easy! I used broccoli rabe instead of arugula and sautéed it with onions and garlic then added it to the cooked sausage!

This dish is absolutely in demand at my house with adult hearty eaters. Sometimes I use sweet sausage vs hot. Tend to use fresh spinach vs arugula just for personal preference. Clean up is a breeze in one pan. Make extra it will go!!!

I have made this dish so many times now I've lost count.  I follow the directions exactly changing nothing except my greens.  I use spinach which makes it awesome.  Like Chef John I use a whole lot of greens and watch it wilt down to nothing.  People still can't believe I've made this in one pot.  It's a great dish and one of my go to's.  The broth does make it salty so no need to add any at the end.  Also if you're like me and don't like your pasta al dente then I suggest cooking this pasta for 20-25 instead of the 15 minutes that is in this recipe. (side note-for this new entry 1 24 18 I used shells instead and it took so much less time and after the 3 cups of chicken broth I added a 1/2 cup white wine-delicious!)

I make this at least twice a month.  It's so easy and yummy.  I don't usually have that kind of cheese on hand and I just use plain old parmesan.  Still wonderful and makes great leftovers and I'm not a leftover kind of gal.

Next time I will use lower sodium chicken broth (it was a quite salty from the sausage/regular chicken broth), and more arugula, but really an excellent (and better for you) alternative to any boxed one-pan mix!!!!!

This was good. Easy and the kids liked it.  I added more noodles and added a frozen bag of carrots and peas to make it a bit more  hearty.  The sauce was yummy.

Absolutely delicious! I subsituted turkey sausage and spinach and added great northern beans. I could not find orecchiette pasta so I used shells.  My husband could not stop raving over this dinner-so good that I am making it again tonight (just made it last week). Thanks chef john!!!!!

This would have been much better if I used ground beef instead of italian sausage - it was too spicy and too salty.

One word, YUM!  Super easy, inexpensive and was a hit with the family.  Cooking the pasta in the broth gives it much deeper flavor.  Substituted spinach and threw in a little oregano and garlic salt, otherwise followed recipe.  Used spicy Italian sausage and wasn't too hot, just right.  Husband insists I make big batches for the coming football season.  Thanks!

This is so addicting! I couldn't find arugula in the store, so I just ommited it. Then I forgot to add the parm cheese and it was still incredible. Only thing was it gave me a stomach ache, but my body is very sensitive. It tastes so good I'll take the stomach ache! Next time I make it I will substitute the arugula for spinach if I cannot find arugula. I'm making it for the 3rd time in 2 months tonight! Yum!!

Great recipe, Chef John!  Easy, fast, and delicious.  My only changes: sweet Italian sausage instead of hot (I added a couple of splashes of hot sauce to the broth to kick it up), and spinach instead of arugula.  My husband loved it, and I will make it often.  Thanks for your tip about the salt--I didn't add any at all because I didn't have low-sodium broth, and it tasted perfect.

We were pleasantly surprised by this dish.  First time using this pasta and the little ears held the sauce perfectly.  I did sub the pork for chipotle chicken sausage and beef bacon fat for olive oil.  I made this with a California vegetable medley on the side but everyone ended up mixing it in with the pasta.

Super simple and easy to customize.  I tried it with ground beef and frozen veggies, and then used fresh spinach.  I also used some powdered boullion and water with the chicken broth as well as onion powder and garlic powder.  Tasty and versatile!

Fantastic!  We are veggie lovers, so I used 3 C Arugula for 2 servings.  We felt it was still a very balanced dish.  I also threw in a few mushrooms that needed using, and recommend this addition.  I want to warn others not to leave the kitchen while cooking the pasta even for a minute, though, or you'll end up with broken pasta and extra scraping!

Wow. Thank you! So good. I wanted to make more than two servings and played around with the measurements. As long as you pay attention and test, it can be forgiving! It was sooo good. Definitely use low sodium broth. I didn't realize I was supposed to so I added some water to the broth

I made this last Saturday night, and let me say WOW!  This is not your typical red or white sauce pasta but it did not disappoint.  It was easy and fast and tasted very good.  I chopped a about 3 cloves of garlic and added red pepper flakes.  I also added baby portabellas slices after my meat was browned.  You really can't mess this one up.  My husband really liked it, my only tweak I am changing tonight since I am making this again is to get a different green than spinach it needed one with more punch.  I will either try mustard or arugula.  Thanks for the keeper!!

This is my first review.  I'm tried hundreds of recipes on this website and liked many but this is the first time I have loved a new dish so much I had to go public!  This was delish and so easy to make.  Pretty much followed the recipe except I used unsalted chicken stock and shin act for the veggie.  Will definitely make again and again and again.

I can't say it was bland because the sausage was overpowering. I guess I'd call it boring.  Even after draining the fat I found it too greasy. It had a heavy quality. I added some grape tomatoes while I was trying to "fix" it.  It helped a bit but not enough for me to make this again.

Prepared the recipe last night as directed, except I used snail shaped pasta (Lumache?), because that’s what I had on hand.   It was okay… but pretty salty (even with low sodium broth) and my boyfriend found it a bit too broth-y.  I liked the idea of one pot, but in the end it didn’t read very pasta-y to me because of all the broth.  If I were to make it again I would boil the pasta in diluted low sodium broth (to give it the savory-ness)  and make the sausage, greens separately.  I would also definitely add garlic (and maybe take out the onion) and mushrooms and toss everything together at the end with a dollop of olive oil.  I think that would give this dish a more traditional pasta vibe.

This was very good.  I used turkey sausage and kale as that is what I had in the house.  Be warned that you do need to use low sodium broth.  I didn't and it was quite salty tasting, but still good.  Will try again with low sodium broth.

The only thing I changed was adding fried garlic in with the onion. I also used unsalted broth. The sausAge adds plenty of salt to the dish.  I had to double the recipe and it still wasn't enough for my two teen boys. One is VERY picky and won't eat anything with greens. He had two servings. This ones a keeper!

Love the simplicity! Used mild Italian sausage and fresh spinach. Great flavor but made the mistake of not using "low sodium" broth and it was too salty. I'll def make again w/the low sodium broth.

Fantastic and easy recipe. I used mild sausage and spinach since that is what I had on hand. As with so many recipes, the quality of your ingredients make the dish. I used sausage from a local Italian store that had very little fat. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Awesome! Everyone tweaks, so I added extra onion, some green pepper and some halved cherry tomatoes for color. Using on-hand ingredients I substituted  bow-tie pasta (1-3/4 cup) and frozen spinach instead of arugula. Three links of Johnsonville mild Italian sausage. Delicious!

This was super easy and delicious a definite keeper. I'm going to fiddle around with the broth to pasta ratio as mine was a bit soupy but not a big deal. I added mushrooms and used extra spinach which probably added extra liquid also. I also used Andouille sausage which gave it an excellent flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

Used penne pasta because that's what I had on hand. Also added red pepper flakes because we like spicy dishes. Paired it with a Pinot Grigio. Wife loved it!

I used swiss chard because I had it on hand instead of arugula.  I would definitely make again!

Thanks for this great, adaptable recipe!  As a recipe of the day, it caught my eye, but I was too lazy to schlep to the store for a single ingredient, arugula.  So I used zucchini and mushrooms instead.  I also added two cloves of chopped garlic.  It was an easy, delicious one pot meal that we loved!

This recipe is delicious and easy!  I used sweet Italian sausage, kale and Pacific Foods chicken broth.  Watch out for the salt.  Next time I will follow Chef John's advice to use low-sodium broth.

Excellent!  I can't believe how easy this was.  I could have had this same recipe at a expensive restaurant and been totally impressed.

I have been making this for years.  The only difference is that I drain the grease after I brown the sausage.  I also use spinach as a rule.  My family likes it as well as guests.

This is sooooo good, just like all of Chef John's recipes!
I used a fully cooked, all natural chicken sausage by Aidell's ,
which I sliced into bite sized pieces with a bias cut to allow a bit more browning surface, then added the onion and some (more) garlic...followed the recipe after that, and, of course, it was fabulous! Thank you Chef John!

I love Chef John all his recipes are awesome ..... except this one.  Maybe I did something incorrect but this was very salty. If you do make this watch the salt.

It was very good, but very salty (not sure if it was b/c of my "pinch" of salt or the recipe itself). I love the "one-pan" approach and will definitely look for more recipes like this!

First I need to say - we're stuffed from eating this tonight. I'm sure as printed it's fantastic, but we thoroughly enjoyed the version I came up with just playing around a little because of ingredients on hand (so don't be afraid to sub if needed). We didn't need any olive oil, used bow-tie pasta, swapped in 1/4 cup white wine with the initial chicken broth cooking mixture and used spinach instead of arugula. I don't think the whole amount of chicken broth was needed, but I'm here to tell you, this is one good meal. We definitely will have it again and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to others. Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

I couldn't find arugula at the moment so I used a spinach/arugula mix and it was great! I also used sweet Italian sausage vs. spicy. This was one of those rare dishes that my all my kids enjoyed. I thought I was going to have to add Alfredo sauce in the end, but this was just too packed with flavor that I didn't need it!

family loved it!  Unfortuantely I had to use elbow pasta, as I could not find the vegetable pasta in shells.  Another note, I would add, I used a ceramic pad, which did not produce the wonderful browning goodness.  Be sure to use a pan other than a non-stick to get the flavorful pan scrapings!

Way too hot for my family! I followed the recipe exactly as video showed except needed more liquid and switched to plain water toward the end. OH BOY SPICY! Maybe if you changed it to sweet Italian sausage or swapped out 1/4 for hot..... and I love spicy food! Also don't both salting the onions - unless you use low sodium broth this gets a bit salty too.  I was disappointed cause I love Chef John and his recipes are usually superior.  Think I'm removing this one from my recipe box.....
