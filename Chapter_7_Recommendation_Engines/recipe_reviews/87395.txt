We were planning a family tenting trip and my husband wanted to show the kids how to cook bannock over the fire as he used to do as a kid. This was something new to me as well so I had to look up this recipe. It turned out great!! You make the dough and wrap it around a stick, then roast it slowly over the fire and serve it hot with butter and jam! Delicious!! Thanks so much for the recipe. My husband and I are going on a mountain back packing trip next weekend and I will definately bring the ingredients with me even if I have to leave something else behind to fit it in!! We will definately make this a family tradition.

I made this recipe and it was delicious!
However, I would suggest making the Bannock a lot thinner than one inch or the Bannock comes out doughy.

Great stuff, I substituted lard for oil (sue me), and baked them in a cast iron skillet on the stove.  I'm planning on making a mix to take camping so all I have to do is add water and cook.  They are great with lard, and cook well on a stove, 1/2 inch thick, three or four minutes on each side.

I bake with the metric system and wonder if there might be an error in translation - the amount of flour is no where near enough... Wowever, when knowing that its easy to add extra, get a few extra buns (which is no loss!) and enjoy this wonderful bread!!!
Lovely!

I really liked the consistency of this once it was cooked. One of the problems I had was the salt, I added much to little of a pinch. In the future I would add a few "pinches" of salt. 

I will make it in the future, but with a few changes.

i just made this a few minutes ago, because i was craving bread and wanted a recipe that didn't use yeast/eggs/dairy.  
it's a very basic recipe that you can obviously doctor up anyway you'd like.  i drizzled honey over the bread- and it tastes so yummy! it's very moist and chewy.

To anyone thinking of using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, DON'T DO IT! My bannock has an over powering olivey taste :( Good recipe but I needed to add A LOT more flour than called for.

The same as I used to make when I was little.  I did substitute lard through as thats what I used in the recipe I no longer have.  My kids wanted a wiener roast and I was out of hot dog buns. I mixed up this dough and we wrapped wieners in it and roasted them over the fire.  Just like when I was a kid!  Also delish with currants!  Thanks for replaceing my long lost recipe!!!

This is exactly the way to make perfect bread. I put mine in a square pan and it came out wonderful. I am guessing Mia is Nish, she knows what she is talking about! For people who are saying there isn't enough flour: you need to sprinkle more on your dough as you are kneading it, until you get the right consistency.

Mia, delicious and Simple.  We recently made this for an event and fed it to 100+ people. We prepared the dough he evening before and i kept very well.  Also, i recommend thining it out with a rolling pin if you would prefer a less doughy bread.   Great work!

Great Recipe.  One thing that I like to do is add about 1-2  teaspoons Cinnamon (6 servings) this and get the cans of Apple, Cherry, etc of pie fillings and put it on this.  I usually take this camping every time and wrap it around the stick and put the pie filling inside.

This is great!  I had a craving for bread and was running low on several necessities like bread, milk and eggs.  This was so easy to whip up and baked in no time at all...probably quicker than a run to the store would have taken.

this was my first attempt at making bannock. i wasn't sure how many pieces to make, so i just split them into handfull-size pieces of dough, and rolled them out to slightly lesser than 1" thick. I also brushed them with oil, which I think was a mistake. They rose and baked beautifully, but they did not get that nice golden brown tinge to them on the top. I ate mine with butter & jam, and could not get enough!

This is a great recipe! I didn't change a thing. I did use warm water. I ran out of bread and needed something that was fast and easy. My 11 year old daughter did this on her own a few times. Very good with butter and jam!

I was looking for a bannock recipe to take while hiking/camping.  I don't like hard or burnt bread.  This bannock came out perfect in the oven.  I haven't tried making it over a campfire, but I planned on preparing it in advance and taking it with me, so this works perfectly.  It taste awesome with blackberry preserves!  If you're gonna make bannock, make this one!

This is great!  I forgot to poke holes so it rose, but it still tastes great.  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt instead of the pinch and it is perfect.

This was a wonderful treat!  I used 2% milk in place of the water, made individual patties and cooked in a cast iron pan over an open (coal) fire pit.  Family loved it.  Had it with butter and homemade jams.  Yum!

I made this recipe just yesterday to go along with "indian tacos".  My grandma used to always make bannock, but I've never attempted it myself.  It was just like grandma used to make.  I altered the recipe just a smidge... I added a couple pinches of salt, and added a tbsp of sugar as well.  I then fried it in a wok, and it was very delicious, my kids loved, loved, loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to try this recipe since it's rather inexpensive and easy. Forgot to add the salt so came out a bit bland but put a bit of butter on them when they were still warm and turned out pretty good. Tasted like biscuits or at least, like the "biscuits" I had tried when I was a child. Will make them again but only when I'm broke.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It turned out delicious.  I will be making this for my family regularly as we like bread with our dinner and yeast rolls take too long.

Not the best recipe. There is a  mistake in it too. Should be 2 TEASPOONS  of baking powder not tablespoons.  Which is still too much. 1 1/2 teaspoons is plenty.  You also need more salt or the bannock will taste flat. I use a scant 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I use milk not water and it is more tender if you use buttermilk. I usually use half milk and half buttermilk. These should be lukewarm.And I use lard which is more traditional. 1/2 cup lard. Cut lard into small bits and rub in like making pastry. Keep lard cold.

This was fast and easy to put together for our cookout.  The dough was quite elastic, and cooks best when stretched out into thin layers wrapped around a wiener or a long bbq roasting fork    The flavour was a bit bland even though I added a pinch of sugar to balance off the taste of all the leavening agent used in this recipe.

Awesome!  It was super yummy and went very well with our turkey soup. The consistency of this bread was nice and fluffy and not too doughy. I would add a little more salt next time but that is just my taste. I doubled up to Make two batches and the first one was gone as soon as it was ready. This recipe will be my go to from now on for baked bannock.  Thanks for sharing :)

I made half a recipe, with a healthy 'pinch' of salt and baked it in the oven in a cast iron skillet. I should have made it thinner before baking-a bit doughy in the middle- but lovely texture and flavour. Can't wait to try it again. Delicious with butter and grape jelly.

Easy-peasy and a good go-to basic. I substituted 1/4 cup of lard instead of oil as that is the traditional way. It worked great!

Bannock is handy when I am out of my usual bread ingredients or when we are on a tight budget. Instead of vegetable oil I use butter and if I have it, I replace 1/2 cup the water with milk. I pout everything into my stand mixer and set it on low, letting it bring everything together and knead it for me. Awesome bread, but gets chewy after a day or so, so maybe I will try storing my bannock with a slice of white bread to see if that helps them from getting chewy.

Very sticky dough. My sister made this (and to be fair, she can't bake at all) but they definitely weren't what I thought they would be. Not worth the 4 and a half stars they had. It also tasted way too much like baking soda.
