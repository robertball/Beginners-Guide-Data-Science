Excellent the way this is written.  Also, you could actually cook and crumble the ground beef so the chunks are larger, then make the gravy and add to that to the ground beef and cook it down for a while, like a stroganoff.  Serve over potatoes or egg noodles!

This recipe has a great combo: easy and tasty.  Served with mashed potatoes.  The gravy was delicious.  Would be even better with mushrooms and/or other veggies added.  I used lean ground beef which made it difficult to hold the patties together.  Kids were a bit reluctant, but everyone ate it and seemed to like it.  I have never used panko before, so now it is in my pantry!  Thanks for the practical, yummy recipe.

We have been making this for years and think of it as a variation of hamburger stroganoff. YUMMY!

This dish was wonderful.  I didn't have any Cream of Mushroom soup so used Golden Mushroom soup instead.  Very, very tasty, and easy to do.

Bland. Yes, it qualifies as comfort food but definitely not worth the calories.

I made this again for the second time. It has such an awesome flavor served with chef Johnâ€™s mashed potatoes. Next time I will leave the egg out of the hamburger mixture because the hamburgers will hold up fine without it and no extra liquid is needed in the burgers.

The whole family loved this!  A couple changes to spice it up:

I sauteed some additional chopped onion and chopped mushrooms in a separate pan while browning the patties. Once the patties were browned on each side, I added the sauteed onions and mushrooms along with the other ingredients to let it simmer.

For the patties, I did add a bit of Dale's Marinade to the hamburger meat before forming the patties.  Dale's is a Worcestershire based marinade that is my secret weapon for adding crazy good flavor.

And the last change I made was using golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Otherwise followed the recipe and everyone raved about how good it was.  I will definitely make it again.

I had no beef broth so I added white wine with beef gravy, and it was not good.   If I were to make this again, I would add the ingredients that were recommended.

I cook some sliced onions and shiitake mushrooms then add them to the gravy before simmering. We love it. Been doing different variations of this for years. Great recipe for adding your own touch.

Normally I follow the recipe exactly the first time to give an accurate rating. The only change I made to this recipe was adding two small cans of mushroom to the soup and beef broth mixture. I just felt that it needed more mushrooms. Had some problems with the patties falling apart, but other than that the dish was very tasty. The wife loved it and so now it will become a regular at our house.
