This is an awesome and easy casserole!! Made a few changes, which made it go farther (big eating family).  Based on the complaint that there was too much mayo, rather than reduce that ingrediant, I added apprx 6-8oz cooked macaroni noodles and increased the cornflakes to 1 1/2 cups (1 cup into the mix and 1/2 cup for the topping).  I also added 1/2 cup diced celery, 1 4oz jar diced pimentos for color and spinkled in some shredded cheddar cheese over all.  All else was left the same.  Not dry, perfect amt of "creamy" and very tasty and filling.  Thanks for the new casserole idea Mary!

I made the following changes to the recipe and it definitely tasted better:
- add 3 or 4 heads of broccoli (chopped)
- add 6 or 7 stalks of celery (chopped)
- add about 18 mini carrots (chopped)
- only 3\4 cup of fat free mayo (less oily)

I think in retrospect I would have chopped up the water chestnuts into eighths, not fourths.  Their unique texture seemed to be a bit of a distraction and you keep thinking "what was that I just bit into?"  You may just want to leave them out completely because in my opinion they don't add all that much to the overall taste.  I put only a thin layer of corn flakes on top, but I would have liked it to be even more crunchy.  You might also consider cooking the vegetables before adding them to the mix (though I only cooked the mix for 45 minutes, so another 15 might have softened them up a bit more).  Overall quite tasty, but obviously the more things you add to it, the longer it takes to make.

This recipe was a hit with my me and my husband. There were barely any leftovers! I did read through the reviews before preparing this recipe, and decided to cut the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. I added some red pepper flakes, half of a minced jalepeno, 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of monterry jack cheese, some fresh ground pepper, some garlic salt, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken soup. I served the casserole with a ceasar salad and bread. My husband barely left me any for lunch the next day!

Substituted Cream of Mushroom with roasted garlic and added about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese and it was superb! Served it at a party and everyone loved it!

This was delicious! A few changes I made: Used low-fat mayonnaise, added chopped celery, chopped carrots, and about 1/2 cup of shredded swiss cheese, which gave it a wonderful flavor. My husband loved it and so did my picky toddler - There were no leftovers!

The ingredients sound weird , but it really works out to be sooo yummy! The water chesnuts are the best part and I always add extra. I add extra corn flakes too on top to make it extra crunchy. I do cut back alittle on the mayo to make it less greasy. this is a winner!!! Try it!

I found this recipe good, but I wasn't blown away.  

I am still undecided about the water chestnuts (which I chose to chop before putting them in).  They were a bit too crunchy for me.  I would have preferred celery for a bit of crunch.  But then again, my kids (6 and 4) hate seeing anything green in their food and so they liked it better this way.  Also, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the chestnuts.  I did, but then added in some of the liquid so the mix wasn't so dry.

I liked the cornflake crumbs in the mix.  It gave it a nice texture.  For the topping I did what I always do and mixed the crumbs with some melted margarine or butter.  This way the topping bakes and isn't just dry on top.

I left the lid on and just pulled it off near the end to brown the topping a bit, but really I think I could have left it on for the entire cooking time.

Overall I found the recipe wonderfully easy to make and would rate it a bit above good.

Overall the recipe was good, I would make it again.  I used cracker crumbs, and only used about 1/4 cup maynoise and added a little sour cream too.  I also put french fried onions on top as topping which was great. The crunch of the water chestnuts were good.

I think the best thing about this recipe is that it's a solid, re-workable one.  Not being a huge fan of mayonnaise, I only used 2 tbsp of it, and mixed that with 4 tbsp of lite sour cream.  I sauteed my onion in olive oil, and added in one teaspoon of dried basil, black pepper to taste, and a crushed clove of garlic.  By precooking my onion and reducing the mayonnaise, I cut the cooking time down to 25 minutes.  I used fat-free cream of chicken soup, and I think just about any cream based soup would work well with this dish.  I didn't have water chestnuts, which I love, so I used mushrooms instead.  No crunch, but lots of flavor.  Finally, I didn't have corn-flakes, so I used cornbread stuffing mix, which was a delicious replacement.  I DO love a recipe that can successfully be altered to suit my own taste.  Everyone in my family loved this, even the kids (though they picked around the mushrooms).  I will make this again and again.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I changed the recipe so much, but again, I think the flexibility is one of the recipe's best qualities.

Excellent recipe~~5 stars!! I made this for family members and everyone asked for the recipe.  After reading some reviews, I did use Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic. I used half sour cream and half Light Miracle Whip instead of mayo because that is what I had on hand. I sauteed the onions because some of my family members don't care for "crunchy" onions. I added extra water chestnuts~~I just diced them quite small.  I also added at least a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and more corn flakes. I baked the dish for just 35 minutes or so covered in a preheated oven ~~ after 35 minutes it was bubbling and browned.  I served it over wide egg noodles with some peas and corn on the side and also served a crusty bread ~~ this dish was soooooo good! My husband said if it was on a restaurant menu he would order it.  It was not dry, not runny, not bland~~it was perfect and tasted delicious. There were no leftovers and we had picky eaters present. Next time for convenience, I think I will add more soup and just mix in some cooked egg noodles and vegetables before I bake it rather than serve these things separately. 
Thanks, Mary, for a great recipe! Yum!

So easy! I have sauted the breasts, used canned chicken, and have also used the already cooked kind in the grocery when short on time. It is easy to put togeather and tastes great.

We have a saying at my home when I try a new recipe (if it is good it's a "keeper".This one is definately a keeper!!I did modify just a bit after reading others reviews.I sauteed the chicken & onions in butter with a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.I added a 2oz.jar sliced pimientos(drained),1 can mixed vegetables(drained),1 can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic-that's all I had on hand.I also added a whole cup of corn flakes to the chicken mixture & enough to completely cover the top.I also reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup.My husband loved it but he said there was something that needed to be left out.We narrowed it down to the mayo.Next time I think I will try sour cream as others suggested.I think I will also try reg.cream of mushroom soup or the chicken.Also you might want to double the ingredients,it won't last LONG!!We aren't big eaters but this went quick!

This recipe is good, but if you substitute the mayonnaise with fat-free sour cream, add 2-3 cups of cooked rice and a 1/2 cup of celery, it's a great recipe.

I did change this recipe some what.
 I added a cup of sour cream and 2 tsp of mayo and I chopped one yellow onion and one garlic clove cooked them together and added 1 tsp of Basil till this was transparent.
 Once I put the final product into the baking pan.
I put slices of Mozerella cheese and corn flakes all over the entire dish. Baked it for 40 minutes on 350. My husband and daughter raved and raved about it.This was excellent.

My husband loved this!  I did add less mayo (3 TBSP) and used celery.  I also used only 1/2 cup onion.  I cooked for only 45 minutes and it was perfect- not soupy at all.  I highly recommend this SIMPLE recipe.  Even I could do it.

My Husband and I have had this a few times now. Very easy to make - We both liked it and my husband does not usually care for casseroles. I like the added crunch of the water chestnuts.I just think it needs flavor - maybe garlic ?   Thank you for sharing your recipe, Mary

I love this casserole!  Some have labeled it "bland", but I find that for my family with three young children it's great.  A friend brought this casserole to me 5 years ago after the birth of my first child and I was thrilled to find the recipe on Allrecipes.com.   I find myself often taking it when a meal is needed for a new mom...I add some grated carrots, and it's perfect for a nursing mom who needs some "comfort food".

Excellent!  I made the following changes, as recommended by other reviewers:

Added 1 C shredded cheddar cheese, used Ritz crackers instead of flakes, and used mushroom soup instead of chicken.  Also, I only cooked it for 50 minutes and that was perfect.  I thought the soup and onion gave it a lot of flavor.  The cheese added a nice texture.  

Next time I plan to skip the water chestnuts, and add some sliced almond.

This is definitely an EASY recipe to throw together, but my family didn't care for the mayo...I will try again with a different base, possibly more soup or some sour cream.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used the basic recipe (for 6 servings) and added a few "twists" of my own.  I sauteed the onions, water chestnuts, fresh garlic and mushrooms together.  I also boiled the chicken with some fresh garlic.  When I mixed everything together, I added a little less mayo and made up for it with a little more cream of chicken soup.  I used all of the corn flakes in the mixture and just add more for the topping.  I also added a layer of grated parmesan before the layer of corn flakes on top. My family and houseguests LOVED it!!!!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!

This came out really bland for me and actually made me a little sick to my stomach. Definitely not one that me or my husband will be trying again.

This was awesome! I added some grated swiis cheese to it.  To the reviewer that said they would jazz it up by adding some water chesnuts if you had read the recipe IT DOES have water chestnuts in it!  I never understand reviewers that don't read the recipe completely or completely chanfe a recipe and then give it a low review. ????  Anyway... great recipe!

This has a pretty good taste, but it is VERY GREASY.  Could be that I followed someone elses' suggestion of adding 1 cup of cheese (though I used non-dairy cheese) though.  The flavor is good but if you are on a diet, avoid this one!

I too was disappointed in the bland part.  I did follow some of the previous suggestions.  I may try again...but will use cream of mushroom soup and add 1/2 cup of wine.

The only problem I had with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough.  My advice is to double the recipe.  It's great.

SUPER TASTING AND VERY EASY!! I DIDN'T FIND IT GREASY AT ALL - I USED LOW FAT SOUP AND FAT FREE MAYO.  NEXT TIME I'M NOT GOING TO BOIL THE CHICKEN AHEAD OF TIME - 1 HOUR IN THE OVEN IS A LITTLE TOO LONG FOR PRE-COOKED CHICKEN.  AN EXCELLENT RECIPE THAT FREEZES REALLY WELL!

I tried this recipe because I love water chestnuts and it was quick and easy to throw together.  But if I make it again, I'll probably "tweak" it a bit to make it more to my taste - perhaps use Ritz crackers instead of the cereal.  Also, I thought the chicken got a bit overdone.  Since it cooks for an hour in the oven, is it really necessary to pre-cook the chicken?

OH MY GOSH!!  I made this dish with 2 chicken breasts, and added celery, carrots and broccoli like the other reviews suggested.  I wish I would have double the amount of veggies I added.  It would have been PERFECT.  And don't skip out on the water chestnuts.  They add just the right amount of crunch!  I'll make this over and over again.  LOVED IT.

My wife and son were "okay" with this dish, but there are other chicken casseroles that they would choose.  I think it was just a bit too much of the mayonnaise; it kind of overpowered the dish.

I did several things differently, 1.) I boiled the chicken with onions, celery and a boullion cube for extra flavor, 2.) I put a layer of egg noodles on the bottom of a pan before I put the chicken mixture on top of it, and 3.) I put some Swiss cheese slices on top of the chicken mixture before I sprinkled the remaining corn flakes on top.  It turned out so excellent; my whole family loved it.

Very nice and easy. I use low-fat mayo, low-fat sour cream and sometimes low-fat yogurt all combined. I also add mushrooms and celery to give it some more hidden veggies that the kids will eat! I also use low-fat Keebler Club crackers instead of cornflakes sometimes, and really, no matter how you do this, it always turns out good. You can cut down a lot on the calories and fat by using the low-fat products intead, and when it's in a casserole like this, you can't even tell. Yum!

I had the priviledge of being Mary's neighbor when I was growing up, and I remember this casserole very well!  So I was thrilled to get the actual recipe.  It's as good today as it was then!  Just for variety's sake, I've tinkered with it by adding celery, carrots, and mushrooms. It brings back great memories!!!! Thanks, Mary!

I read every review before I made this....Used hash browns as the base......didn"t have any water chestnuts so I used slivered bamboo shoots.....didn't have white wine so I used vermouth.....had ony 2 chicken breasts so i cut them into chunks and browned them in butter along with the celery and onion. Added a can of mushroom stems and pieces. Also added garlic salt. It turned out great but I should have used 2 cans of soup...one just can't be enough.......Next time I will have all the original ingredients on hand and I am sure it will tast quite different. Oh yes, 35 minutes is plenty of time to cook this.....one hour would cremate it!

I must admit, I thought this recipe sounded a little weird, but it intrigued me.. My family LOVED it!  I followed others advice and cut baking time to 30 minutes.  I also started with sliced water chestnuts and halved each slice and used fat-free cream of chicken soup.  Fabulous!  A real keeper!

This is a versatile dish that my family loves...however....we don't use the cornflakes, I use 1 - 2 cups rice instead (it's a forgiving recipe), and cover the casserole with Panko bread crumbs and a little drizzled butter.  I also only cook it about 30 minutes......the chicken is already cooked, and it's so good with the rice, sometimes I have a little snack of it before I put it in the oven!

Great recipe! I chopped the waterchestnuts very fine and they added a nice texture without a different flavor that the kids would notice.
Since the chicken was boiled already I only baked the casserole for 30 minutes and it was fine.
We think its a definite Keeper recipe!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  It is fattening, I'm sure, but it tastes great.  If you follow the directions and boil the chicken first, it turns out much better than pre-cooking the chicken.

This has turned into my favorite dish.  The only change I made is adding frozen corn and extra corn flakes.  What can I say, I like corn.  I love water chestnuts and they work great in this dish.  People request this dish when they come over.

I made some modifications to this recipe. I used half sour cream, half mayo instead of all mayo. I also added shredded cheddar cheese to it. We could have done without the water chestnuts. Overall, it was pretty good. We at it with spinach.

Tasted great! I made it on July 1st *canadian holiday* for my family. I didnt have any *real chicken* on hand and all the stores are closed. So I used chopped up chicken strips! Worked out just fine! My son is a picky eater and he loved it!

This is one of my all time favorites that is budget friendly and dietary friendly. You can mix it up and add anything you like.  I'm making this now for 5 of my nieces (12-3) and they love it!

This was so delicious!  We had realized at 6pm one night we didn't have anything planned for dinner. I pulled out this recipe and we were eating by 7!  Everyone (picky kids) loved this.  I only put a spoonful of mayo in b/c I don't like it very much, but it still tasted delicious.

Scrumptious. I made a few changes when I made it. I changed the chicken to white flour. Instead of mayo, I used a couple of eggs. The cornflakes were replaced with cocoa powder, and instead of water chestnuts I put in some baking powder and sugar, and oil instead of soup. I was a little surprised that my casserole came out tasting more like a chocolate cake, but I can say that the recipe, with my changes, was excellent!!! Seriously, yummy recipe. Just having fun with how so many people change everything about the recipe and then rate it anyway.

Awesome for kids however I did make some changes including reducing the mayo and adding some chopped steamed brocolli and cauliflower. I also shredded the chicken instead of cubed.  My kids and their grandpa loved it.  This will be made at least every other week - easy to make and easy clean up.

Yummy!  After I had already started making this, I found out that my Hubby had eaten all of our Corn Flakes!  So I improvised and used herb flavored stuffing.  I was glad I did - I think it added a dimension to the flavor that Corn Flakes just wouldn't have.  I also added a handful of shredded cheese (the Mexican 4-cheese blend) in the mix and another handful on top, under the extra stuffing.  The crust came out crunchy and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again - with the stuffing!  (Oh, I also left out the water chestnuts - just not a big fan...and I used a smaller dish - it was too thin in the large one.)  Enjoy!  I know we did!  :-)

This was an easy and very tasty main dish. I added some onions and only used two chicken breast 'cause there are only two of us. I left all the other amounts the same. My wife said she would like for me to make this again!

This casserole was good but I didn't care of the mayo in it. Possibly with just cream soup or milk in substitute of mayo would be better if you don't care for the mayo tang.

My husbands favorite.  I agree with the others - the mayo makes it a bit greasy.  I have used ritz crackers instead of corn flakes (what I had at the time) and it was good.  I love the water chestnuts!!

Very good recipe.  Made some modifications...substituted a bag of frozen veggies (broccoli, red peppers, corn, black beans) for the chestnuts, added some spices and used light mayo.  Kids loved it, and husband thought it was good and different.

This casserole was "ok" definitely not Best Ever.  Although my family liked it, I thought it was way too greasy and the consistency was not appetizing.  Maybe using light or fat free mayo would help.

I made this casserole following the recipe exactly. It tasted good but was a bit bland. I think next time I will try adding the cheddar cheese as another reviewer suggested and top it with almonds instead of corn flakes. It is a very easy recipe to make.

I have a receipe similar to this one, only I add celery, One can of mushrooms, onion, one cup of cooked rice, one boiled egg chopped, and I also melt some butter to coat the corn flakes on top.  My family loves this and my mom used to make it for us when we were kids, only she would use a whole chiken that she had been cooking all day...

Hi Mary .. I, too, enjoyed this recipe, but also found it too "greasy." Plus, we don't care for mayo. If you sub fat-free sour cream for the mayo, it still tastes great. I cut the breasts into strips & brown them in a bit of oleo a few minutes before adding them with the soup mixture instead of boiling them .. tastes better to me. I also don't put the corn flakes in it .. just serve it with rice or potatoes .. very good basic recipe, tho.

This was quick and easy and I usually make it with leftover chicken for even faster preparation.  I made this 1st time with the full amount of mayo but we found it too rich so I reduced the amount by 1/2c. and it was better in my opinion.  I also added more corn flakes to it since I love the crunch.  Will make again.

A little on the oily side, for me...too heavy. But, it was quick, simple, and I loved the water chestnuts idea. I definitely plan to do some alterations and try it again in the future, sans the mayo. ;)

Very good, quick & easy - great for little kids. I used Special K cereal instead of corn flakes - turned out fine. I agree that it seemed like something was missing. Next time I would cut down on the onion.

My roommate absolutely loved it.  We are in our twenties and she doesn't like beef so I have to be creative.  This recipe was really good except I wouldn't put as much mayonnaise in it the next time.  A bit greasy!! But the cornflakes were perfect.  We substituted peas for the water chestnuts cause we don't like water chestnuts.  I will make this again!

My 5 year old daughter and I really liked
this recipe and the crunch of the water
chestnuts makes it different and delicious.
We also liked the cornflakes, it added 
just a touch of sweetness and crispyness.
I baked the casserole for 45 minutes
and it was fine, but I'm going to trim 
that to 30 minutes next time.  My
husband didn't like the water chestnuts
at all and thought there wasn't enough
ingredients, so if anyone has any ideas
for additions that they've used successfully
I like to try to tweak this dish for his
tastes.  Thanks, Mary, for a great recipe!

Good choice if you are short of time and don't mind a LOT of grease.
Quite kid-friendly, tasted pretty good, but was literally SWIMMING in grease.
I used a cream of poblano (pepper) soup instead to give a little more flavor,
but it still could have used a bit "more" to it.

This was great!  Both husband and kids enjoyed the crunch from water chestnuts. . .and when the kids saw cereal go in, they figured it couldn't be that bad!  Thanks.

This recipe was just delicious! It
was especially good served on a hot bed of
white rice.  In my husband's words "this
is a keeper!"

I give it three stars because I added a lot more ingredients to make this more interesting.  I added some chopped celery and carrots, threw in some green chilli's, and threw in some cooked macaroni noodles to help stretch it (didn't have as much chicken as called for).  Over all, it turned out real well.  It is not an absolute favorite but it can be eaten and enjoyed.  Will probably make it again although there is nothing "wow" about it.  I did, however, like the use of the water chestnuts.  Gave it a nice crunch.

too bland for me, and very dry. IF I make it again, I will add chicken broth to the soup/mayo, and maybe add cheese for extra flavor. A can of diced green chilis would probably help too!

This was very tasty and very easy! My husband is SUPER picky, and loved it. I made several easy changes which is why I give it 4 stars: I shredded the chicken instead of cubed for a better texture. I only used 1/2 of a medium onion and sauteed it in olive oil with garlic before adding to the bowl. Otherwise the onions would have overpowered and without garlic the dish may have been bland. I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream to be less greasy. I sprinkled 1/2 cup cheddar cheese on top before adding the corn flakes. I used the whole cup of corn flakes in the mixture and added more on top, just enough to cover. As others suggested, I used a smaller pan. It came out perfectly, not runny and not dry. I served it on top of quick white rice and with a side of vegetables. Great dinner, fast, cheap & easy. With my changes I give it 5 stars. =)

This was pretty good!  I did make some changes though, which is why I only gave it four stars.  I cut my raw chicken into bite sized pieces and browned it in olive oil, white wine, lemon juice and lightly seasoned it.  I also added a bit of cheddar cheese to the mixture before baking.  I think next time I will add broccoli as well.  Very good base recipe!

This is really good itself or add your own ingredients. The mayo and cornflakes makes a difference. I put some shredded mozzarella, mushrooms and the cracker base on the bottom, a bag of frozen veggies and it was delicious, even the finicky men of the family finished it all!

Tasted good with my substitutions. I didn't read the reviews until after. But I didn't have everything listed. I used a Can of mushrooms since I didn't have water chesnuts. I used Cream of Mushroom since I didn't have Cream of Chicken. I alos used minced onion (2T.) since i didnt have an onion. I used a full cup in the recipe and a cup for the top. And I topped it with butter slices. It's yummy.

I made all the changes suggested in the reviews:  added celery and chopped carrots; left out the water chestnuts; substituted 1c. mayo with 1/2c. mayo and 1/2c. sour cream (with approx. 2 tblsp. milk); used crushed potato chips instead of corn flakes.  Turned out fabulous!!

This was good, easy to make and change ingredients based on what you have on hand. I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup, a can of cream of chicken soup, half an onion, and through in some cheese, frozen peas and corn, and like another reviewer said, just cooked my chicken in a pan with some olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also through in a little splash of worcestershire sauce and some dried oregano with the chicken while cooking it. I would make it again, but I think I might try to make a "crust" like you find in a pot pie. That really is what the flavor reminded me of, but without the crust that is so good in pot pies.

Pretty good! I substituted 1 C fresh carrots and celery for the water chestnuts and added some cheese. Thought the onion was a bit much, and I also recommend using a smaller pan than 9x13 for the given recipe that serves 4 to make the casserole a bit thicker.

Absolutely the "Best Ever"!! I took a few leads and added sauted celery, onion, garlic, carrots and leftover steamed broc and zuc. Also added cheddar cheese in mix. After placing all ingridients in casserole dish, I added extra cheese and corn flakes. The end result was happy faces and full belly's. What a great dish to serve the family. Oh yeh, I also made the fruit crisp recipe and that was also a great success. Thanks a million. I'll be coming back for more delicious ideas.

I did not expect to like this one very much, but I loved it.  I used celery instead of water chestnuts and served it over instant white rice. I think this would have to be eaten with rice or noodles. Great recipe!!

This was not that good to me. I think the mayonnaise was over powering. Perhaps if you took the mayonnaise out completely and made it with cream of chicken soup and sour cream.

This is a full proof chicken casserole.  I'm a good eater but my husband actually took thirds of this one!  I added a jar of pimentos for color and a bit of salt and pepper for taste.  Creamy, yummy and delicious!

This recipe just begs to be played with.  I sauteed a sweet onion with a few stalks of celery and a carrot before adding to the mixture.  During the sauteing I added a bay leaf for flavor (that was a great idea).  If I had some fresh flat leaf parsley I would have added a good handful of that because this dish could use some color.  You could add so many other herbs of your choice - I chose a TBLS or so of dried thyme and that helped the dish "pop"!  I did try suggestions others made and decreased mayo and added sour cream - next time I won't because the sour cream added too much of a "tang" to the dish.  I think the whole cup of mayo is fine - consistency was perfect.  I went above the 1 cup of cornflakes and instead used 2 big handfuls in the dish and 1 big handful on the top.  Sauteing the veggies decreases cooking time to 40mins or less.

This was easy and delicious!  Two of my three kids even liked it.  The only reason the third didn't care for it was because of the water chestnuts (which I love)so I guess you could leave them out or substitute something else.  Several people suggested reducing the amount of mayonnaise but I thought the tangy mayonnaise and sweet onion made a great flavor combination.  I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty tasty! I did alter the recipe a bit - 1) Added Celery 2) Used a tad less mayo 3) Used more corn flakes for extra crunchiness 4) I also cut up the chicken and sauted it on the stove top with veggies instead of boiling (still baked it though). I will make again!

I tried a couple of Hot Chicken Casserole recipes on this site and this was pretty good. I would jazz it up a bit with some sliced water chestnuts, sliced celery and cheese.

No offense to the submitter, and maybe I did something wrong (I did use light mayo and soup), but this smelled like dog food.  I tried it twice ~ the first time the corn flake crumbs were old, so I thought that was it.  I bought brand new ones, and as soon as the mayo mixed with the crumbs, it smelled horrible.  It tasted a little better than it smelled, but not much.

Simple, delicious and easy.  I only made one slight modification. As one that loves the "crunch" texture, I used almost another whole cup of corn flakes for the topping.  The topping came out golden brown and was a nice counterpoint to the casserole underneath.  We probably won't see this recipe on "The Food Channel," but for ease of preparation, reasonably priced, quick and still tasty - give it a try.  I'm betting you will like it.

This was a big hit at a potluck! Next time I'll double the recipe because it doesn't fill a 9 x 13 pan. I'll probably spray the dish with a non-stick cooking spray and cook covered with foil for the first half hour and before topping it with the remaining corn flakes.  Excellent recipe!!

Overall it's easy and fast.  I would add a couple of dashes of white pepper and maybe a can of green chilies, or one red bell pepper, chopped.  An hour at 350 is too long.  I cooked it 45 minutes which was more than enough.  Next time I may even add some cream sherry and possibly some sliced ripe olives.

I would suggest either using a smaller dish than 9x13 or adding more ingred, perhaps even hashbrowns as a base to give this dish more substance...otherwise it was tasty.

I enjoy the simplicity of this dish! It is easy to prepare, tastes great, and fills everyone up. It is a bit rich from the mayonnaise, so next time I make it I will ease off on the mayo. Found that slicing the water chestnuts was a good idea, since I don't care for them whole. Thanks Mary for posting this winner!

I used pre cooked chicken, and added
about a 1/2tea. lemon juice.  I also
used Ritz crackers instead of cereal.
I used low fat creamy chicken with herbs
soup.  My kids loved it.

Absolutely amazing dish - family loves it and it's been a go-to of mine for several years. Based on my own preferences I make the following modifications: use 3/4 of an onion chopped, use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and use 1 full cup of cornflakes in the mix and then cover the top with more crushed cornflakes.

It was very good but I changed it alot the 2nd time (hence the 4 stars).  Too rich with the mayo and soup.  I used sour cream instead of teh mayo.  Added celery, mushrooms and steamed broccoli.

i really really loved it! my boyfriend didnt. but i changed some things, boiled the onions and some carrots with the chicken, did the half mayo and half sour cream and then i thing i put to much cheese. and i should have used a smaller pan. and i probably should have made rice to go with it.

Overall the recipe was very good. I chose to boil the chicken in chiken broth instead of water for extra flavor. I also used mixed vegetables and pre-cooked them before adding them to the mix. Any cream based soup works just as well (if not better) than mayonaise.

Yummy Yummy Yummy! I took the advice of the other writers and used cream of mushroom soup (all i had), added chopped celery, some garlic powder, and used Bran flakes instead (again, all I had), I think I also used less mayo...but I didn't measure anything...Oh, and I didn't boil the chicken, I just pan fried it in a little bit of olive oil.  So all in all, this recipes is quite adjustable to the contents of your pantry :)

I would make some modifications next time. Too much onion & mayo flavor. I would add a little cream of mushroom soup and some sour cream tom replace some of the mayo. I would also use only a tablespoon or two of onion, as it was overpowering.  It's a good idea and I think it will be good with these modifications to better suit my family's tastes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  I added some frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  I also sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese and tried with swiss cheese as well.  I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom.  Everyone loved it even my little one who is picky!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  It is rich and full of calories, but you can substitute the mayo for a low cal version with very little change to the flavor.  It's definitely a keeper!

I deviated a little from the original recipe, leaving out the water chestnuts because the hubby doesn't like them. I mixed in 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/2 a pack of crushed vegatable Ritz crackers. I then topped with more mozzarella & cracker crumbs. My family LOVED this, and we will certainly make this again. Thanks

Ya know, it was ok. Its not something I would serve to impress but it definitley did the job and filled up empty tummies in my house. So thank you for sharing the recipe with us.

Note: I only cooked it for 30 minutes after boiling the chicken.

I found this recipe lacking substance. It had no color and was very bland. I read the reviews and lowered the mayo and added cheese. I also added garlic.I was most disappointed that the cheese and corn flake crust was very hard. I think it should only be cooked about 45 minutes.I made the mistake of walking out in the yard and not keeping a good eye on it. I should have taken it out earlier. I will not be making this again.

Honestly, this was not very good.  Way too much mayonnaise.  My husband melted cheese on it to make it taste better and that was the only way he would eat it.  I will not make this ever again.

I tried to follow the recipe and include those comments that sounded good, but it really didn't turn out all that great. I thought it was a four, my wife thought it was a two, so rated it as three. May try it again.

This turned out fantastic.   I used a sour cream substitute in place of the mayonnaise.   I also took some of the past reviewer's suggestions and added 2 cups of cooked rice and some peas.  This one is a keeper.

I made this dish tonight. I thought it was great! I added an extra can of the  cream of chicken soup. My husband really liked it, 1 out of three kids like it. I have very picky eaters. What can I say, kids have no taste. LOL WONDERFUL!

Must say, I was a little disappointed in this dish.  I followed some of the suggestions from the other reviewers, including reduced cooking time and half the mayo.  It still had a heavy mayo flavor, and the only interesting thing about it was the crunch from the water chestnuts.

I was somewhat disappointed with this dish.  I thought it was rather bland.  Both my husband and daughter were turned-off by the water chestnuts.  Next time I'll use mushrooms.  As recommended by earlier reviewers, I only used 1/2 cup of mayo and cooked the dish for just 30 minutes.

Wow!  What a surprise!  The water chestnuts were such a delicious addition.  I sprayed the dish with cooking spray, used cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 the mayo, and cooked for only 30-40 minutes.  My husband doesn't even like mayo type casseroles, and he wants this dish all the time now!  I just absolutely love this one!  Thanx!

I too added vegetables (red and green peppers, frozen broccoli, and celery) and substituted breadcrumbs for the corn flakes.  With the vegies, the entire 1 hour cooking time is necessary to soften them up.  With these adaptations, the recipe was still simple and my family LOVED it.  This will become a dinner staple!

This was good however I felt it needed doctoring up before serving.  I added veggies and used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.  I loved the texture of the waterchesnuts in it.  I also cut the mayo to 1/2 cup as suggested and it faired just fine with the family.  Cooked only 30 mins.

I really like this recipe with some modifications--I like to use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  Also, it's really good with stovetop stuffing on top instead of cornflakes (I liked the cornflakes too though).  And I also like to put broccoli on the bottom.

Fantastic recipe!  Youngest son is a bit finicky.  And, even he liked it!  (I substituted frozen broccoli for the water chestnuts.  It was great that way, too.)

I was disappointed.  It was ok, not great. I added mushrooms and followed other reviewers advice and only baked it 30 min.  That's all it needed.  Ok, but I wont make it again.  My 3 kids liked it though.

Don't boil the chicken first. You're going to bake it in the oven under liquid, so braise it there. Allow extra time, yeah, but when you're dealing with something as bland and flavorless as chicken breast, you need to retain every bit of flavor you can. With that in mind, I'd poach the chicken, remove it to a plate, and reduce the cooking liquid to a caramelized chidkeny syrup, then mix it in with the other ingredients.

I this was awesome and a favorite. I added noodles with  extra mayo and cream of celery instead of the cream of mushroom. 

 Also added mozzerella cheese.

I made this with a few changes and will make more changes the next time, but I really like this!  Based on other reviews, I added only 1/2 c. mayo.  The next time I may add 3/4 c. because I couldn't taste the mayo and would like to!  I added 1/2 c. corn flakes to the mixture and then 1 c. of corn flakes plus melted butter for the topping.  I think 1 tsp. of salt in the mixture would help improve the taste as well.  I will definitely make this again!

besides halving the mayo and using mozzarella, I only had homemade chicken stock. I used a thickener, onion powder, salt and pepper, it was delicious.

Sorry, I really didn't care for this recipe at all.  It reminded me of Hamburger Helper for chicken!  I'm surprised this dish received such high ratings considering almost all of the comments from members included suggestions for some very drastic changes to the original recipe ~ in some cases, creating a new recipe altogether!  I did agree with a lot of the suggestions, including replacing half the mayo with something else like sour cream (or even milk), adding vegetables, and eliminating the water chestnuts (if I'm going to crunch on something, I prefer it at least be a vegetable with some flavor).  What I did enjoy about this recipe is the ease in putting it all together.  Definitely a speedy meal!  Having said that, I think I'll give this one another chance and make some of the changes as suggested.

What can I say...YUMMY!!!! The only downside is that the way the original recipe is written, you can't help but feel guilty..afterall,  it calls for one cup of mayo! I think next time I will do what some of the others did..use lowfat mayo and half a cup. I may add a few veggies too, like baby peas. (will help with the guilt!) But this recipe was REALLY delicious!!

It was a bit bland done according to the original recipe, but has some possibilities if altered a bit. A great base recipe for another chicken dish.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and I was not impressed.  It was way too bland and I don't think I'll try it again. Sorry, but I guess our taste buds want a bit more than this offered.

This is absolutely delicious!  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I substituted with cream of mushroom.  Once mixture was placed in baking pan I shook a little Mccormicks chicken seasoning over mixture along with a little garlic salt and coarse pepper. Also, used ritz crackers instead of cereal and drizzled the crackers that were on top of casserole with butter. I thought the waterchestnuts added a nice crunch - I diced a whole one into 4 pieces.  This is definetly a keeper!!

This is an AWESOME chicken recipe!!  Everyone Loves it - even those who say "I don't like waterchestnuts" - just skip that when naming the ingreds before they try it - works everytime - and it's always fun to tell them after they've raved about that awesome crunch!!

This was pretty good, but the onion was a bit overpowering. Next time I will try using a milder onion like vidalia.

It was ok... but a little mushy. This recipe called for one onion... it was a bit overpowering. If I make this again I'm definately going to cut the amount of onion in half and add some garlic for more flavor.

I wish I had read some of these reviews sooner. I made it for myself and my boyfriend. I honestly think he only ate it to not make me feel bad. I couldn't take more than 3 bites. The mayo was really not good in it. I did add cheese to it too. I really only ate the water chestnuts out of it. I might try some of y'alls changes to try it again.

I like almost everything about this recipe. Love water chestnuts, it makes the dish as far as I am concerned. Will try to cut down the fat content next time though somehow!!

I would have to agree with some of the others on this recipe that it lacked flavour.  Next time I would saute the onions with celery and garlic to add more flavour and maybe add some chees like someone else mentioned.  I think it would almost be a 5 after doing this.

Husband loved this.  Thought we would add rice next time. Also, I followed the recipe to a tee except I added slivered almonds on top with the corn flakes. Slat,pepper and a little Cavender's seasoning (greek seasoning). Enjoy!

I didn't really care for this recipe. My husband thought it was alright. I probably won't make it again because I don't care for the flavor too much.

My husband and my oldest son liked this recipe, but my youngest and myself were just okay with it.  I think that it was very easy to make, and I may try it again, but I might add some vegetables with it, and some spices to give it more flavor.

This got mixed reviews at my house.  I thought it was good, but a little dry. One daughter didn't like it at all; the other one loved it until she bit into a water chestnut (I thought the water chestnuts were the best part!). My husband liked it. Next time I'll add some cheese, bake only 30 min and divide into two dishes, one with water chestnuts and one without.

I have to admit I was a little hesitant about making this one, but it turned out great! I used cream of celery soup & 2 cups frosted flakes (w/ 1/3 less sugar thank you Tony the tiger), left out the onions.  The flavor was different, but very good. Not the "mushy" texture I would associate with the word "casserole".  I have renamed this "Best Ever Chicken." I will make it again.

I thought this recipe was alright. My family really liked it. Next time I think I will cook the onions with the chicken. (I'm not a fan of crunchy onions.)I also followed others advise and cut back on mayo.

This was just "alright". It needs more flavor and less oil from mayo. I think if I were to ever fix this again, I'll add some spices and cut the mayo in half and add sour cream like others have suggested. 
Although it gets an extra point for being a relatively easy weeknight dinner.

It was great!! The only thing I changed I added to cans of cream of chicken and 2 cups of corn flakes. I used one cup into the meal and then the other cup of crushed corn flakes I sprinkled on top. Also my husband topped his off with a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning.

Maybe "best ever" is an exaggeration.  It was okay for me, but too rich and bland.  I thought it needed more flavor and less fat.  My husband ate it but didn't ask for seconds and my children didn't like it at all.  I don't think I'll try it again.  Sorry.
