I forgot to rate this last year, but it was such a huge hit I'm doing it for Christmas again (and forever lol).

I DID make some changes

1- I steam fresh green beans instead of using canned stuff.

2- I make my own condensed Cream of Mushroom soup instead of using canned stuff.  Then measure out 1 and a third cups (the left over I just make soup out of)

3- I make my own French Fried Onions (you guessed it- instead of using canned stuff.)

This recipe is awesome, but using fresh ingredients really brings it to life.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

No changes.  It’s great just as it is. I did use a couple of extra strips of bacon, just because....  lol.  Nice change from the usual.

I usually make the traditional casserole, but not anymore, this was amazing. definitely a new addition to Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners... possibly week night dinners also. Thanks so much for sharing.

A great way to improve on green bean casserole. I couldn’t taste the cheese so I’m going to make it again without and see if it’s still as good.
