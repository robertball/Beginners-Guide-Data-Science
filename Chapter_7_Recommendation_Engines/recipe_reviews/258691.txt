A great treat for myself. Refreshing and sweet enough for my taste buds.

7.1.17  This was delicious, and I even used 1% milk (what I had on hand) and sub’d Truvia® for the sugar.  Totally refreshing, totally easy, and totally AWESOME!  This could become addictive.

Used sugar free caramel sauce and name brand cold brew coffee from the grocery store and made darn near close sugar free version of any sugary drive thru caramel macchiato!

Tastes just like Starbucks, except better because I skip the sugar as I don't like it so sweet.

Yummy!  I did leave out the sugar as I don't drink overly sweetened coffee.  Great recipe to make in my Magic Bullet.

I used “caramel in a can” (sweetened condensed milk cooked in a water bath in my crockpot) and homemade cold-brewed coffee. Coffee flavor was subtle, and I discovered some of the caramel left in the bottom of my blender, so will dissolve it in a bit of warmed milk next time. Not as thick as pictured - will use a few more ice cubes in future. (Note: for a change-up for someone who needed to cut out some caffeine, I made this, substituting salted caramel tea prepared just beforehand - she loved it!)

I liked this. It has a great ratio of ingredients. I left out the sugar just because I don't like my coffee drinks too sweet. Also, I used coconut milk, and that worked great.

We loved this one.  It was delicious and creamy. Perfect for an afternoon pick me up. Who needs to spend a lot at a coffeehouse when you can make your own even better. Love it!

So good! I used 1% milk (what I keep on hand) and subbed 2 tsp of coconut sugar for the white sugar. This was so refreshing on this 90* day. Thanks, Paula for a great recipe!

Excellent!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and skim milk instead of whole.  I also doubled the amount of ice- and it was still FANTASTIC.  I would definitely make this again! *This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

FABULOUS!   This coffee was the perfect treat on a hot summer day!  It was sweet and creamy and yet the coffee flavor was still the star.  I used splenda in place of the sugar, but, otherwise prepared exactly as the recipe stated.  Thanks for the recipe!

I must confess that I have never had one of these fancy coffee drinks but now I know what all the fuss is about. This one is great. I didn't add any sugar figuring the whipped topping and caramel were enough sweetness. Paula you rocked this one! Despite all the legal jumble at the end of this review I can honestly say that this is my true and honest opinion. This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.

This was so easy to make. I whipped it up in no time flat. Using the Gevalia concentrate sure beats making coffee and chilling it.  We enjoyed drinking this iced coffee on a hot day. You could also add chocolate syrup, too! Thanks, Paula for such a delicious recipe! This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.
