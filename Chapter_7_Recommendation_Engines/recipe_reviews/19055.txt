I made this for a party and it was a hit!  I doubled up the recipe but only used one jar of the marshmallow creme, and it turned out GREAT!  Don't let the low number of reiews fool you on this dip.  I highly recommned it.

I made this recipe this weekend for a family get-together and wanted to contribute a couple of ideas on changing up the flavor.  You could use strawberry or pineapple cream cheese instead of plain - I LOVE strawberry cream cheese with this.  Or another idea is to put in about 1/2 t of any fruity-flavored extract (I used banana and it was AWESOME, but you could also use raspberry, strawberry, cherry, etc.) to the original recipe.  Not only does it taste delicious, but it smells SO GOOD.

Also, a note on using the electric mixer... I only have a stand mixer and I didn't want to dirty the whole bowl just for this, so I mixed by hand.  I noticed that you could feel the texture of the sugar crystals, even though it was powdered sugar.  I would definitely recommend using a mixer.

This dip was so yummy! I made it to serve with apple slices, and it was delicious! I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to make it a bit healthier, and omitted the powdered sugar, because the dip was definitely sweet enough without it! Thanks for such a quick and tasty recipe; I will be making it often!

I've been asked for this recipe at least six times, since serving it on Independence day, this year.  It's sinfully easy, to make - and tastes very luxurious, rich, and creamy. It's like "800 threadcount Egyptian sheets" for your tastebuds.  Great recipe!!!

This is great dip.  I served it at a birthday party and everybody liked it and commented on it.  It went well with grapes, strawberries, bananas, apples and even cantaloupe!

Very good, very easy. Served at wedding with fruit plates. Doubled the batch, served 150 guests and they licked it clean. Could have used another batch or two I guess.

This is outstanding: simple ingredients, easy to make and delicious flavor. I got many compliments on this and would definitely make this again. I served it at our book club meeting with a fruit salad of oranges, grapes, strawberries and cantaloupe.

I prepared this recipe just as described.  It was wonderful!  I have three little girls and they dipped every piece of fruit I could find.  The adults enjoyed it just as much.  Thank you so much for a super easy and very delicious  dip.

I have been making this dip for years. Always a big hit at parties. Only difference is that I use 2 tubs of strawberry cream cheese and 1 large jar of marshmallow creme. I don't add the sugar or lemon juice either. Turns our perfect! Great to serve all year, especially when you have berries or grapes that are not in season...it adds the perfect sweetness to otherwise tart fruit.

Made this yesterday, but omitted the lemon juice.  Very yummy!  It is a bit sticky, I'd like to try another recipe that maybe is more fluffy.  However, still very delicious! Served ours with apples, strawberries, and grapes.

it came out well but I guess I am just not a huge fan of marshmallow fluff.  Next time I will add coffee or chocolate liquor.

This recipe is good. Just good. I like to make it and dip strawberries in it. I call it my strawberry dip. To make it taste not so plain. Instead of buying regular cream cheese to put in it, buy the strawberry cream cheese, or whatever flavor you like. Don't be afraid to mix it up. You won't believe the results and how differant it makes it taste.

I made this dip for a bridal shower and it was great! Not too sweet and light and fluffy. I used fat free marshmellow cream and 1/3 fat cream cheese. Still tasted great with any fruit!

This was perfect! I hoped to take the easy way out and buy a pre-made fruit dip (time crunch!) but couldn't find any at the store I went to (??) Looked this up on my phone, knew I had the ingredients at home, and whipped it up, exactly as written - the teen girls I served it to LOVED it! Served with GS apples, red grapes, strawberries and pineapple chunks. Thanks so much!

just looked this up and made it in less than 5 min.  Had fluff in the cupboard. It's was the big plastic size, but only had about 7 oz left (eyeball measuring), so I added the cream cheese and the confectionery sugar and use the wand blended to mix right in the fluff container.  I'm leaving the extra in there to take with me.  Didn't have any lemon, but it's perfect.  I thought it would be okay, but it's really good.  Thank you!

I halved this recipe but kept the 1/8tsp lemon juice. Sweet with a little bit of tartness. I served this dip with fresh pineapple chunks and whole strawberries.  The only thing I might try next time is to add some red food coloring to make it pink and therefore stand out a little better on the table.

Wow!  This stuff was great and the hit of the party!  The lemon juice makes sure that the dip isn't too sweet.  Definitely on my list to make again!

I thought this was going to be way to sugary sweet.. but with the lemon juice added, it was PERFECT. I dont think I'll ever eat fruit or bagels plain again!

I make this dip for every birthday party my kids have. It's easy and delicious. I recommend using strawberry cream cheese.

It was very tasty but kind of heavy. Next time I'll try a recipe with cool whip so it will be lighter.

Wonderful! My family devours this dip every time I make it. I have made it with and without lemon juice and it is a hit either way.

Such a simple, easy recipe, but sooooo good. My only complaint would be mixing marshmellow fluff, not that easy, so sticky.  I used 1/2 strawberry and 1/2 pineapple cream cheese. This makes a very large portion so save room for the fruit.

Everything about this dip is yummy just as is.  I have added a couple of tablespoons of marmalade or apricot preserves to pretty it up a little.

Disappointed, tasted like Fluff, didn't add sugar, it was already overly sweet. I make another dip with instant pudding, yogurt and cool whip.
