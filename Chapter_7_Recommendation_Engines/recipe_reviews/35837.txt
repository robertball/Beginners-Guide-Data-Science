This recipe sounded so delicious, but it was so sticky and I found it very hard to make into loaves, also I'm wondering if the bourbon wasnt too much liquid. After they baked, cooled and baked again, half of my batch fell apart and crumbled. I'm not sure if I didnt follow something right or not but I wonder how the person who made this recipe did when she tried it out.

A very different texture from most biscotti. It has almost a shortbread feel to it. I used rum instead of whiskey. I cut back on the sugar just a bit. Butterscotch chips tend to make things too sweet. Used 2 eggs on the advise of others. I let the dough set in the fridg and had no trouble shaping into logs. I also allowed the logs to cool compleatly before slicing and had no problems. I will make these again because they add a nice variety to a gift platter.I may use 1-2 tsp of rum extract and omit the booze and will chop the butterscotch chips next time to avoid the intense sweet taste. You can stand your cookies upright for the second baking and cut the cooking time in half.  This also eliminates any chance of breakage on the turn.

I've made biscotti before and this was by far the easier recipe.  I followed the other person's suggestion to use rum and to let the batter sit in the fridge for a few minutes before shaping the loafs.  I also put a layer of wax paper on the bottom of my cookie sheet and I think this made a big difference.  The only thing I didn't like was that the cookies seemed a little stale by the next 24 hours and I had them in a tightly sealed container.  Next time I'll just make these right before the party and not the night before.  My party guests loved them!

The dough was way too liquidy to make into a loaf - and it spread out so much in the oven.  Once I tried to cut it into slices, it just came apart. And though I cooked them almost twice as long as the recipe called for, it never got harder than cakelike - definitely not crispy like biscotti should be.

To be honest, I changed a lot of this recipe, but since they put my picture of it up, I feel like i ought to review it.  I'll give it four stars based upon how I made it.  I did not use whiskey.  I did not use four eggs--only three.  No almonds, but I put in about 1 c. of chopped butterscotch chips.  The biscotti spread out quite a bit, but not so much that it fell apart.

I too found the dough very liquidy and hard to form into loaves. But I formed it the best I could, they didn't spread much at all once in the oven (as I feared) After letting them cool for a couple hours I sliced them w/ a very sharp serrated knife, and baked the second time with no problems. I took them to a scrapbooking party and they recieved rave reviews! I will definatelly make these again! I also subbed Caramel Temptations liquor for the alcohol in the recipe- yum!

This recipe is amazing. I cut mine a little bigger (more the Starbucks size) and drizzle with white chocolate for a professional, beautiful finish. Everyone is always amazed by these, even people who don't like butterscotch and no one guesses there is Jack Daniels in them!

Batter too runny.  Added flour till I got the texture of other biscotti that I make.  Turned out very well with this change of recipe.
