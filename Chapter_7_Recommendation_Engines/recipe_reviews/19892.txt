Everything was good, especially the crumb topping.  However, the granny smith apples aren't the best choice.  Probably a Cortland or Macintosh apple would be better.

This was GREAT!  I left out the apples and used about 5 very ripe bananas, and about 6 peaches.  I did not need to add any water to the fruit mix.  I added coconut to the crumble as someone else suggested.  Everyone thought the banana/peach crisp was very unique and the flavours blended together beautifully.  I have already made 2 more (and have requests from friends and family for more).

Excellent! My family loved this. I used 2 little packs of instant Raisin and Spice oatmeal instead of plain oats and it came out just as wonderful. A scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was heaven.

I made this with frozen peaches and frozen blueberries and it was very good. Even better heated up that night with ice cream. Thanks for sharing such a versatile recipe.

Used this recipe as my guide, but had to make a few changes based on the items I had on hand.  I only had canned peaches & fresh nectarines.  I put 2 cans of peaches in the baking dish, 1 with the juice, the other one drained, & added 2 fresh nectarines (sliced).  I made the topping as instructed, but just before sprinkling over the fruit I mixed in about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.  Came out delicious!!  Thanks for a great base recipe...one I'll have fun playing with!

I concur with others, this is a great way to use the fruit before it's to late. I used apricots, apples, nectarines, banana, blueberries & peaches. I did however, leave out the water as I had fruit that was pretty soft and very juicy.

Smells great baking. I agree with JosieV's comment regarding using Granny Smith apples; I even used (1) sweeter apple to balance it and the Granny's were still way too noticably tart. 
The crumb topping was just a bit disappointing, too. I haven't had much experience with crumb toppings, but this seemed too dry to me. Probably needed more butter. However, I will make again this way because it was pretty healthy and still had four star flavor. And Shelley H. is right: it CRIES OUT for vanilla ice cream. I opted for Fat Free frozen topping (did not thaw) to keep the fat calories down.

This was very good, I would recommend it to any one of my friends. I was suprised though about the banana but it was just another added flavor. 
Only thing i did diffrent was add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and allspice since i did not have cinnamon.  Next time i will try it with the cinnamon

Yum! What a great way to use up fruit that's about to go bad. The only changes I made were I used white peaches instead of regular, MacIntosh apples instead of the Granny Smith and Craisins instead of raisins- only because that's what I had on hand. It turned out great. I was hesitant about adding the 1/4 c. of water to the fruit after reading the reviews, but it was great with it- turns into a nice sauce. I love the addition of the bananas as I had never heard of a fruit crisp using them either. My family loved it. I will experiment with all sorts of fruits with this. Thanks Shelley!

This was very good without the bananas. We had fresh ripe peaches off the tree and blueberries right off the farm, and wasn't sure about the bananas. Will try the bananas when I make this with canned/frozen fruit.  Great lowfat/cholesterol dessert warm with a spoon of lowfat cool whip

Having some apples and bananas that were about to go bad, I searched for a recipe to use them up and happily found this one.  I thought it would be a little weird with all the fruits, but it was great.  Since it was winter, I used canned peaches and I'm sure it'd be better with fresh, but it was still great.  Hot from the oven on a winter night with a bit of vanilla bean ice cream, this is ultimate comfort food!

Yummy!  I used up a bunch of frozen fruit from my freezer (a few strawberries, peaches, & blueberries).  I also added 1 1/2 bananas and 2 granny smith apples. I reduced the water and added coconut as one reviewer suggested!  The topping was very good and it added a nice balance to the unsweetened fruit.

This was very easy to make and turned out wonderfully!  I left the raisins and water out because I don't like raisins.  
The first time I made this, I used a combination of mixed berries and it was excellent.  Tonight I made it as the recipe calls and the banana was a little more prevalent in the taste.  It added a great new dimension to it.
This is definitely a keeper.  The crumble topping was easy to prepare.
I did make this in a 9x9 pan instead of 7x11 because that's what I have.  Baking time did not have to be adjusted.
Try it.  You won't be disappointed!

Didn't care for this recipe.  I LOVE fruit crisps, but the banana flavors just did not work.  I also would not recommend adding the water to the fruit...it made the fruit too soupy after baking.  The topping was bland.

Very good recipe.  The fruit mixture worked well and had a great flavor. After it cooked I used a turkey baster to suck out extra water/juice as it was like soup underneath the topping.  It was still plenty moist and good.

this turned out decent...The choice of using cortland apples for this was a bad one on my part. Granny smith's would have been much better!! I'd suggest making sure the bananas are layered deep within the crisp as well...they taste funny when they dry out a bit and then are mixed with everything else. With some tweaking, this could be fabulous!

I didn’t have any fresh fruit on hand, aside from pineapple, so I improvised by using canned peaches, apple pie filling, fresh pineapple and added chopped  walnuts. I also didn’ have any raisins, which I generally keep in the house (I must go grocery shopping). The  combination was absolutely delicious. Omitted the water since I included the juices from the canned fruit. Will make again soon and include raisins this time but will omit the bananas. This crisp was perfect and pretty versatile. Experiment with your favorite fruit.

Turned out great!  I only used bananas and peaches - not a cooked raisin fan - my husband and I finished it pretty quickly.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm using berries and peaches tonight :)

This was a deliciously, different fruit crisp. I added some dried cherries too since I had some on hand, and used granny smith apples and a sweeter variety. This was delicious warm from the oven. Thank you Shelley!

I had I feeling this wouldn’t work for me and I was right :(.  The bananas and raisins didn’t work flavour wise and the crumble was dry and not very flavourful. My family was petty disappointed and shocked- my deserts are usually really good. :/ 
 Soooo not to be beaten (I hate kitchen failures >–

This recipe was a big hit with my family! I used canned pineapple (pineapple juice instead of water), fresh apples,pears, and walnuts.Next time I will add more cinnamon and maybe cut the sugar back a bit while adding a little splendid or truvia. It's great the way it is but I like to play around with recipes.

Left out the banana and used a sweeter apple. Didn't miss it. Pretty good with lots of possibilities for use with other fruits.
