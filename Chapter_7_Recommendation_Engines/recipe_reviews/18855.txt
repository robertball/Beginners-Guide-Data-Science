This is a delicious casserole. I made it tonight and it was wonderful!  The flavors blend together creating a very tasty dish. I don't think I would make this regularly though, just because it seems more suited for a holiday or to bring to a potluck. I don't think a child under 4 would like it to much. Otherwise, a great casserole!

I have made this for yeas except in my way I don't use the BELL PEPPERS and use Ritz crackers instead of cheesy crackers, it is always the rave of the party when I take to Pot Lucks! But needs to be cooked at 350 for about 45 minutes

I have made this MANY times and the bell pepper does not belong in this recipe!  I add 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it creamier and along with the crackers I add chopped slivered aldmonds to the top!  YUMMY!

I have to agree w/ some that a whole pkg of crackers is absolutely WAY too much. After taking if out of the oven, I had to mix the crackers into the rest otherwise I'm not doing anything but eating crackers. It actually tastes better that way but I would probably use less amt of crackers if I were ever to make it again. Thanks, though.

Easy, cheap and DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I both loved it. I did not mix the cracker crumbs very well so they didnt brown. They did toast nicely though. Next time, I am going to make sure i thoroughly mix the butter by putting the cracker crumbs and butter into a plastic bag and shake it up.

This recipe was a relative novelty to me in that I've never used so many pre-prepared ingredients before. As the recipe stands, I think it needs some corrections: the pepper & onion should either be a little pre-cooked (e.g. sauteed), or the baking time extended, as otherwise they are still quite raw tasting & crunchy. I only used half the quantity of crackers & that was more than enough.  I would probably not prepare this dish for others if I wanted to show off my cooking skills. It is an interesting, flexible, & fast recipe for yourself & family, however.

I thought it was very simple to make and it didnt cost much money either. My boyfriend loved it so much. We live in texas and he said it reminded him of foods he loved when he was growing up in boston. I didnt give it 5 stars because its not the healthiest food to make and I think it could benefit from cooking the onions and green pepper a bit in advance to soften them up a bit. I think next time I will also add semi cooked potato pieces.

This is a wonderful recipe, however, I did make a few changes.  I used Cream of Mushroom soup, diced up 1/2 cup of celery, used 1 cup of sharp chedder cheese, diced up a 1/2 cup of green pepper and eyeballed the cheese its and butter so that it wouldn't be too much.  I get asked all of the time to bring this dish over to dinner parties!

I really like this recipe.  I've made it 3 times now.  The last time I omitted the soup, since I didn't have any on hand.  I did add 1 tsp. of salt since I figured the soup would have been adding some savory saltiness to the dish.  I thought it was just as good, just a bit less creamy.  I also have never tried the green pepper, since the other reviews suggested not using it.  I've also decreased the butter and the crackers (using reduced fat ritz instead of cheezits) - because in my 2qt dish I don't need more than 3/4 sleeve of crackers.

This was great to add into, I put a couple of carrots and a couple of corgettes in, (just cause they were lying around) and had to use cream of asparagus instead. (cream of celery was non existant in the store i went to.) 
My boyfriend loved the creamy sauce. 
I wasn't too thrilled, but I think as a side it would be ok... (yeah, we ate it as a main meal. That's me not reading the recipe properly again)
It was alright, though i put the thing too close to the top of the oven and the crackers burned the first time. (I scraped them off and tried again hehe) With bread or some kind of main food, it could be really nice. I still don't think I'll make it again, but thanks!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I was worried that the vegies would be too crisp, but I just cooked it for 3 mins extra.....I did NOT need to saute them first.  Don't let the picture or ingredients fool you...this dish is amazing and CAN be served as the main meal.

Being a Vegetarian it is hard to find recipes that I LOVE....but this one is a sure keeper. I didnt have white corn, so I used Hominy..it was a bit sharp, so I will make sure to use the white corn next time, however it was still yummy....AND even better warmed up... Also I used cream of broccoli instead of celery...and I tripled the recipe as we are a large family and ate this is the main dish..not a side..great with Biscuits...and a bowl of fresh fruit with whipped topping....TRUST ME...you will love this casserole.

Ugh. Very bland and I won't make again. I would have given this a '1' but I added Morton's hot salt and that helped it a little.

Sorry to be the exception, but I didn't like this very much at all. Maybe it's just not my kind of dish.
I think the amount of crackers was way too much, and I couldn't tell how the topping was supposed to end up - maybe I didn't crush the crackers finely enough.
I ate it all (took days), but I won't make this again, most likely.

This was an easy recipe. I used whatever mixed veggies I had on hand and it worked great. I gave it four instead of five stars because its very campbell soup tasting. I think I will not use any more recipes with campbells, everything tastes the same!!:( Although, my Daughter loved it and she's very picky. Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy! Didn't have enough better cheddar crackers on hand for topping so mixed in cheese flavored french fried onions...Turned so out well that will mix the 2 from now on. Recommend saving some of the topping if plan to reheat later as the topping gets a little soggy during refridgeration.

I was a little freaked out at first, but it yielded an awesome and unique flavor. My fiance and our roommate loved it. We ate the whole thing!

This is the best vegetable recipe I have ever made or eaten. I first made it last Thanksgiving, and ended up making it ALL THE TIME! I didn't change a thing- it was perfect just as the receipe instructs. Definitely a must to try for anyone who loves a good casserole!

Just didn’t love the flavor.  I’d possibly use regular cut green beans and a different more flavorful soup if I try again.

7.21.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18855/veggie-casserole/ ... This has potential to be really good with fresh ingredients & some white wine or sherry maybe, but my 22 had two servings & he doesn't eat vegetables since potatoes don't count.  :D   I had yellow stickers - markeddown - for almost the entire recipe.  'Used two cups each of canned green beans & frozen corn, no green pepper, prob ten crushed whole wheat crackers mixed with just 2T butter.  Two servings!  I'm still in shock.  :D

I enjoyed this casserole, of course making substitutions along the way. I used half a poblano pepper as I was out of bell pepper. I sauteed the onion, pepper and celery I added to soften & decrease the sharpness of raw onion, SO glad I did that, thanks to  reviewers who wisely suggested that.

I used frozen beans & corn, so it baked for closer to an hour to get it nice & bubbly & browned.

Next time I make this, I plan to use a poblano pepper again, and if I can get to Trader Joes, I'll use their fire-roasted frozen corn and a healthy addition of ground cumin to accent the poblano. Maybe a Mexican cheese or at least co-jack. Either way, this is a great recipe as-is or a jumping off point for those who like to customize, thank you to Rachel Query for posting it!

I changed up this recipe a bit, but still think it deserves five stars. Yummy!!  I cooked up a couple of potatoes, carrots, and onions in olive oil and added it to the veggie mixture. 98% fat free celery soup, light sour cream, and low fat butter crackers. Even my super-picky, hates-all-vegetables eater cleaned her plate!! Goes great with corn muffins. :)

Delicious!  I made some modifications.  I used lowfat sour cream and 98% fat free soup.  I also added 2 stalks of celery, diced and 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese.  For the topping I used a sleeve of Ritz crackers and 3/4 cup butter.

This was ok and I liked it but my DH didn't care for it as much.  But he's not a casserole man either.

This was better than I thought it would be, although I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand - I used a can of mixed veggies and threw in some frozen corn, topped it with a mixture of cheese crackers and saltines with a little garlic powder.  I thought the sour cream taste was pretty strong, and I only added about half the amount.  My family (including toddler) thought it was just great, so I would make it again for that reason alone.  Obviously not as healthy as a plain fresh vegetable but still good.  The onion and pepper should be chopped very small or you will have crunchy pieces, which probably won't go over big with kids!

My husband and I have been using this recipe for over a year and absolutely love it!!  We use fat free cream of mushroom or broccoli soup to make it a little healthier.  We also half the amount of Cheese Nips, and use light sour cream...it still tastes just as wonderful.  This is a very easy recipe that everyone will love!!

I added yellow bell pepper I had left over and it seemed to blend well.  My hubby liked it a lot, and he's usually very picky with the casserole type of dishes.

As I'm typing this review my daughter is eating this recipe and LOVING it! I'm not much on celery so next time I'll try maybe one can of cream of celery and one mushroom..the celery taste was a little over powering..I doubled the recipe and am making it for thanksgiving dinner and I must say..that it's probably THE BEST recipe I've gotten from here...and my new favorite food. AWESOME AWESOME taste.  I'm from the south and we typically don't eat food combinations like this.....but now it's my new favorite food and I plan to make it all the time. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING IT UP HERE!

Wow! This is such a nice change from the regular green bean casserole. I even threw in some french fried onions for good measure. VERY good recipe. I'll make this I think from now on!

This was a wonderful surprise (husband liked it although he hates green beans and green peppers).  Works well as a "cheesy potatoe" alternative - not sure about using it as a main dish.
