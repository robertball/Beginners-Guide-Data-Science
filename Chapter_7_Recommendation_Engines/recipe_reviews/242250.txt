I can't believe so few people have reviewed this recipe.  I've made it at least a half dozen times and consider it my go to burger recipe.  The shallots and garlic cooked in...... Yes..LARD is really good. 1 tablespoon of this fat isn't going to change the actuarial tables too much.  Relax, enjoy and add these simple ingredients

I   don't  use lard for any other recipes, so had none in the house. Instead I fried the onions and garlic in olive oil. These burgers were indeed delicious!  P.s. the word "lard" in the description made me pass over the recipe on my first search for a beef pork combo burger!
