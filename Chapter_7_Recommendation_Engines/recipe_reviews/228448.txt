I changed it a little bit after my first time baking it to make it a little healthier, but this is already so good! I simply skipped the salt and oil and only added about 1/4 C any low fat cheese. I also drained the zucchini. Have added fresh cilantro and other spices as well to change it up. Would be great with ham and/or potatoes!

Perfect base to experiment with! I saut√©ed 1/2 lb brown mushrooms in oil and butter; squeezed the liquid out of the shredded zucchini with paper towels; used 1 c flour and 1/2 T baking powder ('cause I didn't have Bisquick); used 2 eggs and 2 egg-equivalents (i.e., egg whites) and drizzled 1-1/2 T butter on top prior to putting in oven. Yummy!

As we had an overly successful zucchini crop this year, I was excited to find this recipe!  My husband likes very few vegetables and he will eat squash, so I'm always looking for tasty zucchini recipes.  This is a very nice, easy recipe that uses quite a bit of zucchini.  Easy clean up, too!  (I was concerned the mixture would stick in the pie pan, but it came right out, cleanly.)

I would have liked it to have been a little more set up on the interior - the moisture of the zucchini is probably a little bit of a variable - and of personal taste (I prefer egg dishes a little dryer.)   I'll definitely be making this again, with the addition of a little more "baking mix", I think.  Also, I doubled the "Italian Seasoning" and added additional garlic or it would have been extremely bland.

There's a lot of potential here.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with some additional ingredients.

Aug 2017 -- We have another overwhelming zucchini crop, so I pulled this recipe up and tried it again with the changes above, which included an additional 3/4 C of Bisquick.  I also squeezed as much liquid out of the shredded zucchini as possible.  I browned, crumbled, and drained Italian sausage and used shredded mozzarella cheese along with doubling the seasonings.  I greased 2 8" pie pans with olive oil and divided the mixture between them, baked for 35 minutes and they were PERFECT!  We ate one and froze the other!

I made this recipe for the first time and took it to work for a brunch.  Everyone loved it.   I made these changes.  I added a bit of grated onion for flavor.  Also,  I didn't have any Bisquick so made my own from an online recipe.  Also, I made it the night before and heated it up in a warm oven.  Worked great.

The baking mix was a bit overpowering. This is a good base for tweaking.
