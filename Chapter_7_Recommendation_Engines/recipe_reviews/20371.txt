Wow! This is good! I made changes to this recipe only to make it somewhat healthier. This is what I did. With the rust I omitted the Tbsp. sugar and used walnuts only because I could not find any pecans in my grocery store without the chemical BHT in them. Then I used 2 pkgs. cream cheese and added 2 cups REAL whipped cream with only 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. Yum! Now for the topping, I mixed 3/4 cup sugar with the 4 Tbsps. cornstarch and added 2 cups organic peach juice (not made from concentrate)instead of the water and cooked that until thick. Meanwhile I sprinkled 2 Tbsp plain Bernard Jensen gelatin over the remaining cup of peach juice to soften the gelatin. Then I poured the hot over the cold juice and added 6 large sliced peaches. I covered it and chilled it in the fridge. O man was this good!

WOW!  This is the best recipe I have found at AllRecipes...no joke and my favorite one made this Fall.  The combination of the Jello filling and fresh peaches absolutely hits the spot.  Way to go TARA!

I only changed a few things. I doubled the amount of sugar in the crust for a little extra sweetness.  And, used more peaches (8 instead of 5).  I also liked to just dollop some fresh whip cream on the top as opposed to cool whip.  Good eats!

Peaches at their peak of flavor and a "five star"
crust earned me lots of compliments on this recipe. I was aprehensive about the gelatin layer 
but it turned out fine; there was just too much of it. No room left to frost with the whipped topping so I spooned it on for serving with a sprinkling of chopped pecans. I would make this again with any fruit in season and the corresponding Jell-O.

This is definitely a 5 star dish!! We loved it even though it seemed to take a long time to make (the cooling of the crust and the jello mixture and then waiting for the jello to set up). The only changes that I made were walnuts instead of pecans and I used less sugar. It was plenty sweet after cutting more than 1/2 cup of sugar from the jello layer. I will probably use more cream cheese next time, only because I love that layer the most. The fresh peaches make this dish so cool and refreshing for this time of year.

we all thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I found that the peach layer didn't set up completely, could be that it didn't sit in fridge long enough or i didn't cook long enough.  This recipe works well with lemon pudding and pie filling instead of the peached(skip the jello step and make 2 packages of lemon pie filling awesome) the only change i made was i used chopped almonds and 2 tbls of sugar instead.  the other thing people could do with the cream cheese layer is use 2 pkg of cream cheese, 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of whip cream, that works very well. will definitely be making this again, we also try with different fruit as well thanks again

Oh my goodness, this was DELICIOUS!  I think I could have eaten the whole thing myself in one setting...  but some how I managed to restrain myself, lol. The crust tastes like a pecan shortbread cookie and is absolutely fantastic. I used two packages of cream cheese in that layer, but that was the only change I made to the original recipe. The whole thing just comes together so well and is absolutely one of the best desserts I have made in a LONG time.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I thought the pie was great, but I did make some modifications.  I used ground walnuts for the crust and thought that it tasted fabulous.  I also did not put the whipped topping in the cream cheese mixture, but instead used two packages of cream cheese.  It was served to about 8 people and they all thought it was great.  Warning:  it made a whole 9x13 pan full to the brim.

I thought this recipe was way too much work for an ordinary result. The crust was really good.

Fabulous!  I found it pretty sweet and will probably use less sugar next time.  But overall it was great.

So delicious! I typically do not like fruit pies, but this was so light and yummy. I didn't have time to make a crust, so I used a store bought pie crust and a graham cracker crust. This recipe made more than enough to fill 2 oversized pie crusts. My family prefered the graham cracker crust, but both were good. I'm going to try Strawberries next time.
