This is a very tasty and easy to make pie. Cost friendly as well. I gave 4 stars, because it took a while to set enough to eat.

It reminds me of quick cheesecake spread that you find near the cookies in the refrigeration aisle. And I chose to eat it plain because I hate imitation products. Opt for fresh strawberries and a homemade strawberry syrup for your topping. Nice easy Recipe

Cream cheese + lemon juice = curdling. I followed this recipe exactly but I used fresh squeezed lemon juice....could that have been the problem? Wish I had used water. Tastes slightly soured with curdled bits. Gross. I read the other reviews before trying, and I'm wondering how they were so successful.

Delicious! I used to make one like this years ago using cherry pie filling. You can use any flavor of pie filling if you like.
