This was an outstanding pizza!  I made it on my pizza stone in no time at all.  I subsituted diced Del Monte basil & oregano tomatoes for the sun dried which complimented the Italian seasoning on the chicken. This is a fun & easy recipe to make with kids too.  I highly recommend it!

We enjoyed the flavors of this pizza, but next time I think I will not use so much ricotta.  It seemed to be too much for the size of pizza crust used.  Everything else was very tasty.

just ok, i made a better version before.  1 pound ground chicken or turkey browned with onion and garlic powders salt and pepper.  use fat free ranch dip from the refrigerator section and put this on your boboli crust (use boboli not the cheap kind
).  top with ground chicken and thouroughly drained frozen spinach.  cover with monteray jack cheese or chedder and jack.  follow cooking instructions.  make sure to dry spinach or you will have a watery pizza.
