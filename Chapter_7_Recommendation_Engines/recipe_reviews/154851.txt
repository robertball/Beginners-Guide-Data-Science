I was very determine to find the BEST prime rib recipe and I found it. I've tried many prime rib recipes and this is by far THE BEST.  I used 5 1/2 pounds and it asked for 2 1/2 cups of Rock Salt.  The outside came out a little bit on the salty side.  I would probably recommend 2 cups instead.  I also added EXTRA Rosemary.  I also did what one of the viewer did, cook 450 degree for 30 minutes and then turned down to 325 degree and cook the remaining 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Removed the meat at 130 degree and let the meat sit for 15 minutes.  The meat came out medium rare... PERFECT!  Thank you for sharing and this recipe belong to a 10 stars!!!

This turned out awesome! The only thing I did wrong (was not thinking at all) was that I used my clay pot.  Not a good idea.  I would not only recommend, but insist on using a disposable pan to ensure cleanup.  That's all.

I have been making prime rib for several years but this is now my favorite recipe.  Be brave and try it...it was well worth it!  I did use kosher salt instead of rock salt.  It worked fine. I also used a tuscan herb mix that I found at Costco instead of the onion soup and rosemary.  I used about 1/3 or so of a cup of the seasoning.  It smelled so good and I was surprised that the meat took on the perfert amount of seasoning even though it was tossed out after cooking with the salt/flour crust.  It smelled so good that I used this mix in my mashed potatoes too! I put the crust on my rib while it was on my counter instead of in the pan, as in the instructions.  I used a bone-in rib and cooked it on my roasting rack.  I completely covered the meat (bones and all) in the crust.  It was very easy to work with and went together very well.  Then I cooked it on my rack and had no trouble with the crust sticking to the pan.  I also changed up the temp a bit.  I cooked a 17 lb rib for 1/2 hour at 425 and then reduced to 325 for the remaining 3 hours.  I used a meat therm. and took it out of the oven at 115 degrees and then let it rest for 1/2 hour.  It was perfect.  Tip: if you have a George Forman grill, it is really helpful for your guests who like their prime rib more well than medium rare.  You can pop a rare piece on the GF grill and in seconds have it more well done.  It was really fun to serve my friends a great piece of prime rib that was like something they would get at a very

I used this recipie for my New Year's Eve dinner and it was absolutely fabulous! I did a 7lb prime rib roast, roasted it first for 30 min, then cooked it for an additional 1 hr 40 min, rest for 30 min. At first I was quite hesitant cooking a prime rib roast with a rock-salt crust, and which took less time that any of the other recipies I had researched. Since the crust covers the entire roast, you don't see what's happening on the outside. So during the entire cooking time, I was praying to the food God's that I did not mess up on this expensive piece of meat. (Please note, that I am a novice cook, so I don't have the experience yet to know what works or not.) However, once it was done and I removed the crust, it was like a gift sent from heaven! I think that it turned out better than any other rib roast that I had tasted. I followed all the directions and added all the recommended ingredients, with the exception of sticking some garlic cloves into the roast and roasting it initially for 30 min instead of the recommended 20 min (as suggested by some members, thanks guys!) , but other than that, it turned out to be a hit. My brother, who is the biggest food critique, said that this was the best prime rib roast he has ever tasted!

This was the most awesomely delicous prime rib I have ever tasted and what is even more thrilling is the fact that I was able to make it!  The only different thing I did was instead of a 20 lb Prime roast I uses a 5.5 lb prime roast.  Instead of cutting the ingredients by 1/4, I cut it by 1/2 so that it would be really tasty and also so that I would have a little more of the rock salt dough that was required (since it was the first time I did this).  I'm glad I did that because it can be messy and I took the suggestion of using plastic baggy gloves, which really helped.  I ended up using all the rock salt dough and it came out beautiful!  I am no longer afraid to purchase this expensive roast for fear of serving a mediocre dish.  Thank you so much for sharing this easy and wonderful recipe!

This was the best prime rib I have ever cooked.  I have always used rock salt to cook a prime rib, but it doesn't stick to the meat.  This year, I used the recipe listed here for the rock salt case.  It worked perfectly!  Normally I don't modify recipes, but I did modify the seasonings on the meat to what I like, and I changed the cooking temperature.  I cooked the meat at 450 degrees for 30 minutes as per the recipe, then I lowered the temperature to 250 degrees for 4 hours (until it reacher 135 degrees) for a 12 lb prime rib.  The meat was butter tender, flavorful, and perfectly medium.  WOnderful recipe that I definately recommend!

Only way to cook a prime rib!
My husband’s idea to fix this Christmas Day – wanted something rather than turkey.
OH WOW it was fabulous.  Seasoned the outside of the prime rib with rosemary, garlic, Cajun seasonings. Next time we will inject some au jus in it.
Other thing we did different…put it in at the high temperature of 475 for 30 minutes so the outer layer would sear quickly.  After that the temperature went to 325.  We also put a layer of rock salt on the bottom and on all sides of the roaster.   Just excellent!

I've never made prime rib before, and this was so easy, and so good!! I would recommend placing foil in the bottom of your pan to make clean-up easier. It took quite a bit of soaking to get the salt mixture out of the roaster, but it was soooo worth it!!

This is a great way to cook your Prime Rib. Great taste, tender and the family and friends couldn't get over how the salt shell was around the roast and breaking it open, everyone was really surprized to see the process.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe and everyone should try this method of cooking your Prime Rib.

WOW!  Definately the best recipe I have ever used for prime rib!  Deceptively simple......I had a 7lb. roast, so I 1/2ed the other ingredients, I started with 1 cup water added to the flour mixture; then added more little by little until I had a soft playdough consistency.  Then I turned the roast fat side down, pressed the 'playdough' on the bottom of the roast, then turned the roast fat side up and continued to press the 'playdough' mixture around the roast until it was sealed inside the 'playdough'.  When ready to serve, I cracked the 'playdough' shell and removed the roast.  It looks like an eggshell cracked in 2.  Sooooo easy, and tastes amazing!

Wayyyyyyy too salty.... I'm not going to rate this because obviously I did something wrong, but reviewed the recipe and can't find where I went wrong. Mine was saltier than salt itself, absolutely inedible.

I am a widower and have never cooked for more than myself.  For Christmas, I deceided I needed the confidence building for myself to cook a meal for my family (8 including great grand kids) and this was a real hit for them and myself.  I fixed a 11# deboned rib roast with the instructions provided.  I may have started too early as the meat was finnished in about 2 hours.  Must say it was excellent and the left overs were fond memories of Christmas with my kids.

We made Prime Rib for New Year's Eve this year using your recipe....IMPRESSED!  Very very good flavor, moist, and juicy.  I didn't put the "cast" on the bottom of the meat, just the top and sides and it was superb!   My husband is very picky about his prime rib and he thought it was delish!  I cooked it to 130 and let it sit for 15 minutes.  The temp rose to 140 and it was perfect!  We used "Johnnys" Au Jus on the side (since the others said it was too salty to use its own - however, I saved it and dumped over a roast prior to cooking I made a few days later and it too was great) Yummmmmmm, making my mouth water just thinking out it.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!

This was an excellent meal!  Served this Christmas Day and was a HUGE hit!  Everyone asked for it again next year!!  Was delicious and moist, flavorful and actually very simple to do.  The only issue I had was that I kept it in the oven until it reached 130 degrees with the meat thermometer and it wasn't quite as pink as I had hoped until we got to the very center.  My roast was only 10 pounds, so that may have been the difference.  I encourage anyone to try this is you love prime rib..easy and absolutely delicious

Very good, didn't come out salty as I was afraid using all that salt in the paste you made to cover the primerib.  I would do it again, though it is very messy.

I searched the internet for a salt-encrusted prime rib.  I chose this one because of the rave reviews.  We were not disappointed!  I used an 18lb. boneless prime rib.  I didn't have any rosemary but used an Italian blend with rosemary/garlic and mixed that with the dry onion soup mix (2 pkgs.).  I felt it could have used more seasoning but that did not detract from the flavor.  Also used a large disposable roasting pan which made for super easy clean up.  I followed the recipe precisely but next time I would not dump all of the flour/rock salt mixture in the bottom of the pan.  This proved to be extremely difficult to cover the whole roast with the mixture.  Next time would cover the bottom of the roast, flip it over and do the top/sides.  I roasted it at 450 for 30 minutes then turned oven down to 325 for 3 hours.  The thermometer reached 115 degrees and I took it out.  I didn't let it stand as I was concerned it was already too well done.  I was wrong!  The inside was gorgeous, medium rare.  The rock salt crust literally fell off but left outstanding flavor on the outside of the meat.  I will be bookmarking this recipe for future use!

We do this once or twice a year. If my relatives had their way we would make it every time they came over. This is way better than what we typically get at a restaurant.  This has now become the family tradition for New Years Day.

The stores were out of rock salt so I used kosher.  When I took it out to patch the cracks I must have missed one because after it had cooked a lot of the juice had leaked out and my prime rib overcooked but stilll very delicious but a little dry.  I poured some aus just over it once cracked and it soaked it right up.  I did scrape some of the sticky coating so it wasn't so salty.  Next time I will line the pan with parchement paper because the salt/flour casing stuck to the bottom of the pan and was a royal pain to get off!

It was Christmas day and we had bought our first ever prime rib of 17.5lbs.  We had invited two families over for a Christmas meal.  After barely fitting the bad boy in the oven we set off for the ice rink. 2 hours later we came home to a house full of smoke because the juice had ran over onto the element. Shortly after, company started to arrive to a house full of smoke and a what appeared to be a very large loaf of bread sitting on the kitchen counter cooling.  We began to chip off the crust and shortly after began to dive into this wonder roast that had been unfortunately over cooked.  I must tell you that it was fantastic even though it was well done and  my kids are now prime rib and horseradish lovers.   Initially we struggled with the high salt idea, because we don't cook with much salt. Some outside pieces were a little salty, but we ended up fighting for the outside crispy pieces.  Will use this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing this one.

gorgeous.  I've had this 3 times now and have never been disappointed.  Be sure to have an au jus sauce on the side, and make your yorkshire's from butter.... I've never had prime so moist and perfect.  A little messy, but so is a super to remember.

While the rock salt kept the beef moist, it was very hard to remove (you need a hammer) and spots of the prime rib were really salty!  Won't do it again.

I've made salt encrusted prime rib several times but this was the best yet!  I got rave reviews from my family and one of them who never compliments even asked for the recipe.  I made a couple minor changes:  I used beefy onion soup mix instead of the onion soup mix and added mixed garlic to the rub under the salt.  I also added a small amount of Emeril's Steak Seasoning to the rub.  Ummmm....all this just added to the wonderful flavor!  Only negative was that I waited until the temp was at 130 before I took the roast out to rest for 20 minutes and it was well done through out.  Luckily it was still juicy and yummy!  Next time I would take it out at a lower temp.  While I like well done meat, I know that others prefer it med rare to rate.  I also encrusted the full roast (including the bottom rib side) even though I put the salt mix at the bottom of the pan - I think this helped to seal in all the wonderful juices and helped to keep the well done meat juicy and tender.  Great recipe and I know this will be the one that I use in the future!

This by far has to be the best tasting prime rib roast I have ever made.  It wasn't at all salty in flavour, it was however moist and flavourful!  Thank you so much!

First time hosting Christmas Eve Family gathering of 25 people so why not also attempt to cook Prime Rib for first time as well? After discussions with a few people I was conflicted on the whole salt, non-salt discussion - "It's salt so it dries it out" vs "It's salt so it keeps it moist." A family member had planned on hosting so they already had the rock salt, so went with salt. This recipe got my attention because of a) the rave reviews and b) the flour salt crust made sense to me that it would keep it moist. 

I had two 8 lb's & a 5 lb roasts. I made my (first) batch of flour/salt/rosemary paste & ran out after the first roast. Luckily my wife was around & was able to mix up a new batch. 15 minutes later, I had created quite a mess, everything looked covered butI panicked. It looks atrocious. I had extra rock salt so I dumped that over the entire thing. 

I started it out at 450 degrees for 20 minutes & then turned it down to 350. When it got to 100 degrees, & some of the guests not there yet, I turned the oven to 250.  At 120 degrees I took the roast out.  Let it sit for about 20 minutes while I stared at the smoldering salt covered very expensive piece of meat. 

To my delight, after 20 minutes I stabbed at the shell I had created & it split just like a shell should. Very easily moved the shells aside and pulled out the meat. Swiped away the remainging rock salt and all looked perfect. 

THE MEAT WAS DELICIOUS. Best I've ever had. Unreal.

Pans are still soaking though.

Two thumbs up! I halved this recipe for my smaller roast. Used Johnny's Au Jus, its the best out there. You can google it and order from company in Tacoma, WA. Best prime rib we ever had!

Oh WOW!  We love, love, love this recipe!  I used 5 1/2 pounds of meat with ribs attached.  After rinsing and drying really well, I applied rub ( 1 1/2 TBS. course fresh pepper, 2 tsp. onion soup mix, and 2 tsp. of the roast and steak rub from safeway's meat counter.  That rested 45 min.  The store was out of rock salt.  I used 3 3/4 cups of course kosher salt, and 3 3/4 cups of flour, with a full 2 TBS. of rosemary.  I put all that in a large bowl and my husband added cold water, very, very slowly as I mixed with my hands. I had recalculated the recipe for 7 servings, and it said to use just under a cup of water, or more if needed.  We used about 2 1/2 cups, so way more.  I was mixing really well, and stopped as soon as the mixture was a stiff sticky paste/dough, with no loose dry stuff on the bottom of bowl.  I covered the meat, rib side/bottom too; like you would cover something with play-doh.  I put it in one of those disposable pans, then in 450 degree oven for 35 min, then turned down to 320 degrees for an additional 70 minutes.  I let it rest for 30 minutes.  Hubby cracked the crust, we opened the "package" and were easily able to pull the meat out.  It was perfect!  The two ends were medium/rare.  The 4 center pieces were rare. It was a beautiful red, yet texture was lovely, not raw at all.  I don't have a meat thermometer, so I felt pretty lucky, as this was our Christmas dinner.  Next time I will put a little less "rub" on the ends. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent roast,but a pain to chip off all the rock salt.Plus some of the salt gets into the drippings,which I combine with beef broth for dipping,but is now too salty.

Everyone loved this recipe, however it was very stressful to cook. I planned on it taking it about 3 hours based on the instructions. I had a bone in 15lb prime rib at followed all the directions. 450 and then repatched the holes. After an hour of cooking the Prime Rib was registering 170 degrees! It was done in 1 hour for some reason, I turned the oven down to 200 and waited it out for the next two hours. 
I think this recipe needs to be revisited because realistically I could of served it after an hour. All my visitors were very impressed with the Prime Rib as was I. I just wish the cooking time was more clear.

Super delicious and I didn't deviate much from the original recipe!  Made this for dinner as an effort to build and practice my holiday cooking menu.  I used a 10lb bone in standing rib roast that the butcher was kind enough to cut the bones and tie back with string.  We halved the recipe for the pepper mix and salt crust.  Definitely needed more water to make the salt crust doughy and I used twice the amount of rosemary.  I let the rib roast sit to room temperature for about an hour and applied the pepper mix and salt crust.  I didn't spread the salt crust over the entire bottom of pan, just did the roast.  I placed it directly into a roasting pan without the grate, popped into a pre heated 450F oven for 35 minutes to sear, then took it out to fill in the cracks in the salt dough and let it cook for another 2 hours.  Let it rest for 30 min and cracked it open to the amazement of our kids and dinner guest.  It came out medium/medium well.  We will definitely continue to use this recipe but keep a better eye on the temp so we can get more rare/medium pieces.  Served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, green salad with orange vinaigrette dressing and creamy horseradish (Whipped horseradish recipe also on this site).  This was a fabulous meal, and certainly not a waste of such a expensive cut of meat!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never made Prime Rib before and I made this for Christmas Dinner.  It was some of the best prime rib I have ever tasted!  The only hard part was getting the shell off the meat!  My husband had to use a saw, but once the crust was off it was tender, juicy and perfectly cooked!  Thank you for making my first time cooking this a huge success!!

We just used a small roast, but the meat was still cooked perfectly.  The leftovers were a bit salty though.  the biggest pain about this was the cleanup.  It took 3 days of soaking to get the shell off the pan.  Next time would definitely use a disposable pan.

Made this last night! Triple love it!! Needed a lot more water for the paste. Not a big deal. Also used Kosher salt, and it worked just great! I agree with others who recommended the Johnny au jus! It really is the best!

Ditto!  Turned out fantastic!!  I did a 5.5 lb prime rib and cut the salt and flour both to 2 cups and just added water to pasty consistancy.  Kept the rosemary at 2 tbsp, 2 packs of onion mix and only 1 tbsp pepper.  This crust is a little more work on the front end, but so much easier to take off in the end vs. a regular rock salt crust.  I did 425 for 30 minutes and 325 for an hour and 15 min like a few previous posts, probably could have cut that to 50-60 minutes total, it was pretty well done for prime rib, but still juicy and tender.  I also didn't bother coating the bottom, just the top and all sides.

It was good. The crust was a lot of fun. My only mistake was that I didn't realize how fast it would be finished. I had read the package it came in and it said around 3 hours at 350. I think it was done in about an hour. Next time I will insert garlic pieces into the meat to give it more flavor.

I made Prime Rib for the first time for Christmas Dinner and this recipe was easy and excellent! I did lower the salt from 8 cups to 4 and it was excellent. My family LOVED it! clean up was a bit messy ... I will use parchement paper before adding the mixture to the roasting pan next time.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. I had a 20 pound prime rib and this was not enough mixture to cover the whole roast. After roasting for 30 minutes, the paste had shrunk so much, I couldn't do any "patch" jobs, so I let it cook as was. Getting the crust off was a challenge because it was so hard, like a plaster cast. As I was breaking it off, pieces kept flying all over the place. The meat was delicious and moist, but I have had equal results with other recipes, and none of the mess. We had a party of 24 and though we all laughed and had a "crack at it", no one is interested in using this recipe.

This is the only way my husband made prime rib, and it always came out perfect.  The presentation is pretty cool, too.

There as an excessive amount of salt transfer from the crust to the meat.  Found that even the interior cuts of the roast were excessively salty.  End cuts were unpleasant.   Next time I will use 2 or 3 layers of cooking parchment.  Given the results of the roast,  the waste of resources (salt and flour), and the increased preparation time; if I could rate this recipe at less than 1, I would.

This is the second time I made this for a holiday.  Just as easy and just as delicious.  Calculated the cook time based on 16 min per pound to get a perfect med-rare center.  Started at 450 for 20 minutes and then down to 350... 3 hours later.  PERFECTION! Let it rest for over an hour.  And THEN removed the shell and it was completely perfect.  The shell came of easily.  One of my favorites and def a go to for holidays to come!

Delicious!!! Grandma and Grandpa bought a 21 lb prime rib roast for Christmas dinner. I had the pleasure of preparing it. NO pressure there! Fortunately, I found this recipe. I wasn’t too sure on time  (the reason I gave this 4 star star rather than 5), and her meat thermometer had disappeared... I cooked it on 450 for and hour then  dropped my temp to 350. A GOOD Thermometer is on my list of must haves to make a less stressful cook time with our next large cut. We were a little nervous with this recipe/technique, but very happy with the result.

This turned out perfectly. It was a little work intensive but well worth the effort!This was my first attempt at prime rib and was very pleased. I made the recipe for 4 so adjust time accordingly. Cooked it then 30 min. then an  hour and 15 min. Yum!

I used fresh rosemary from my garden and just stripped it from the branches and wound up using 3 cups of water to get that sticky texture for the coating - this was absolutely DIVINE!  Extremely juicy and the BEST flavor of any salt encrusted roast I've ever made - I'm so glad I couldn't find the recipe I usually go to~ Thank you SO much for sharing!!!

Made this for Christmas dinner. The meat was delicious and moist. It turned out a little more done than anticipated. I had a digital themometer and pulled it out at 120 degrees but then right after I pulled it it was registering at 145 degrees.  Not sure if it was a malfunction with the themomter???  Everyone said it tasted delicious regardless. The clean up is a little rough!  Pan still soaking this morning, hopefully it'll be easier today.

the recipe is for a 20 pd prime rib, however i used a 5 pd prime rib and quartered the ingredients.  Rib came out fine but a bit salty.  i would image this recipe would work just right on a larger cut of meat.

This was perfectly delicious!  I didn't use the onion soup mix because I hate onions, and then I did add about a half cup of the meat droppings to add to the packaged au jus. Instead of straight horseradish, I made a sour cream with a bit of mayonnaise horseradish sauce with a bit of apple cider vinegar and cayenne pepper.  Best dip ever!

I followed this recipe as closely as possible for a 10 pound roast.  Getting the right consistency  for the water/flour/salt casing was the tricky part.  I didn't add quite enough water and it was difficult to cover the ends of the roast completely.  That didn't matter.  It just meant the ends were a little more done (medium) compared to the center (rare to med. rare) which satisfied all the diners.  Also, I will be more liberal with the rosemary next time.  A meat thermometer is a must.  This was a fun entree that captured the whole family's attention.

NEVER EVER remove the fat.  Cooking with the fat is critical to the flavor of this dish.
