This was excellent! I've made it twice in one week and both times it was gobbled up. Very light pasta dish for summer.  Even my dad, who has to have meat, loved it and asked for more!  Angel hair and thin spaghetti can also be used.  Didn't have goat cheese the second time around and it was fine, but will definitely use it in the future as it does give the dish an extra unique taste.

As other reviewers have noted, this recipe is fairly lacking in flavor apart from that contributed by the goat cheese. However, it is a good base for experimentation. On a whim, I sauteed some onion and red bell pepper with olive oil and red wine vinegar, then added that to the mix. The flavors complemented each other very well once there was a sweeter element introduced. Overall - good, but not great.

This was really delicious - definitely a keeper for me!  I mixed the lemon and goat cheese up with everything rather than just leaving it on top, and it was really tasty.

Fantastic meal that requires minimal time to make.  My wife was more than pleased to see this sitting on the table when she got home from work.  It goes great with a Red Wine!

Wow, this was delicious! I skipped the blender step because we like our sauce chunky. The goat cheese makes this dish delicious, do not skip it or replace it!

Delicious and simple. We are big goat cheese fans so that was the icing on the cake. Nice for a busy weeknight dinner

Found the sauce to be lacking in flavour.  We used a goat cheese rolled in herbs and really enjoyed the strong flavour of it. Would NOT use mozzarella or cheddar as then the dish would have no flavour at all.  Preferred the cheese crumbled on top versus mixed into the pasta. Will try again but perhaps with a store bought sauce.

really fresh and tasty, light but satisfying. next time i think i'll toss it with lemon as well instead of just drizzling it on top. tried it with feta, but maybe i'll experiment with a more flavorful cheese. great with whole grain pasta and some grilled chicken.

My family didn't care for this recipe. It was easy to make, but the lemon and goat cheese were overwhelming. I will probably not make this again.

This was good, but not great.  It was really easy to make though, ecspecially for a hot summer day.  I did substitute angel hair pasta and queso blanco cheese.

It was good, a lot of pasta and not enough sauce it seemed like.  It was more of a bruschetta sauce or a linguine with red clam sauce.  Needed something other than noodles, too plain.  Added mozzerella cheese instead of goat cheese, will try goat cheese next time.  Not bad, not wonderful, it's doable!

My other half and I love this!  We have modified it slightly though, we add prawns and some chilli and it's just divine.

Great recipe. For fun, try adding clams or shrimp toward the end; great with the lemon.

This was just OK for us. We felt like it was missing something. I did only have 1/2c of fresh basil (so I added some dry along with a little parsley and oregano). I also cut down a bit on the lemon....maybe those two changes caused it to be a little bland...

I LOVE this recipe!  It's so easy and healthy! The flavors all go so well together.  You can even use the sauce as a bruschetta topping. Yum!

This was so good. I didnt use the goat cheese because im simply not a fan, and i used whole grain noodles. Garlic toast on the side was great. My kitchen still smells good! My husband said, "I love the fact that you can make some 'real' sauce now and not use the can sauce!"

The lemon is way too overpowering and everything was very bitter. I had to add tons of sugar, extra garlic and other spices, and tomato paste.

This is a really good recipe, but I think it could be a touch more flavorful, or maybe just less acidic. I'm still tinkering with it to find out how. It also can be acid refluxes enemy and this is coming from someone who rarely gets it.
