Great oatmeal! Really like the cranberry/apple/spice flavor! I used maple syrup in place of brown sugar, and lessened the amount to about 1/4 cup. I don't care for overly sweet anything, so this was perfect for me. I used apples that were somewhere between sweet and tart--and next time I would use all tart apples for a bit more punch of flavor. Also, I would add a pinch of salt and a bit of vanilla extract to help bring out the flavors just a bit more. The oatmeal only needed about 5-6 hours on low heat, and should be stirred every so often to prevent sticking. Overall though, I really enjoyed this recipe--it's easy to make, tastes wonderful, and makes your house smell great while it's cooking too!
