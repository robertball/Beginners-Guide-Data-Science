These were delicious and easy to make!  The whole family enjoyed them.  I did have to bake them about 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

These are pretty good, and a nice change of pace from the usual chocolate chip and oatmeal fare. I did not find that rolling them in confectioner's sugar did anything for the flavor, so I didn't do that after the first one. Very easy and quick to make, also. Thanks!

Really great recipe. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and melted chocolate on top for a little something something. Very easy, very yummy snack.

Tasty, but next time I'll omit the ground clove and use more cinnamon. I don't care for clove and so to me it overpowers the fig (and cinnamon). This baked for 30 mins.

Very Yummy. Healthy, and sweet. It could have used a little less fig and a little more crust, but all together pretty good.

Very bizarre bars, there is no leavening agent so they don't rise at all and no fat good or otherwise.  Just chewy squares...won't make again

These bars are delicious.  I didn't change a thing and the whole family loves them.  Fairly light texture considering that they are chewy and crunchy, too. The spices were just perfect.

I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top after it came out of the oven and also just used apple pie spice and cinnamon in the recipe because thats what I had on hand.   I also baked 30 min.
