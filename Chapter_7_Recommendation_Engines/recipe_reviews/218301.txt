I did not care for this recipe. Much too moist/wet.

Unfortunately this cake didn't work out for me. The taste and texture were both unpleasant to me. I think it tries too hard. Between the avocado, applesauce, eggs and butter the texture is almost like bread pudding. The aroma of vinegar and cocoa overpower the taste yet somehow it is tasteless and bland. I think leaving out the vinegar and choosing either avocado or applesauce would render this a nice, moist cake. I tried using red food colouring but it didn't come out red, which has had no effect on my rating. It makes a very large cake. I made a half portion and it filled a 9 inch round cake pan baking for the 1 1/2 hours anyway. Thank you evenstaraleni for your recipe.

I have been asked many times what my favorite flavor of cake is and I always tell them that I am undecided between red velvet and cheesecake but even though I can eat gluten I am still glad that there is a site like allrecipes that offers gluten-free recipes so many can live a healthier lifestyle . In addition to that this recipe makes a perfect, sweet, limitedly ritch cake that everybody will like.

Wonderful. Moist and delicious. I made this exactly as written. It took a little longer to cook than written.
I read other people's reviews and tend to think a lot of folks simply have not dealt with gluten free cooking. It certainly takes adjusting
