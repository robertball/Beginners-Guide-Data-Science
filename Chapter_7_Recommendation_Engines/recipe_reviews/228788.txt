I'm the submitter of this recipe. I use maple pancake syrup, not pure maple syrup. I love pure maple syrup myself, if I could afford it, it would also work here, but it is sweeter, so use your own judgement when adding the amount. You really can't screw this recipe up! If it's too sweet add a little more mayo. For this recipe, I never measure, just add the 2 together until I get it the way I like it. Hope you enjoy!

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, did I mention thank you for this recipe??? Fabulous! I make this several times a week. I use half mayo(for flavor) and half greek yogurt(to make it healthier). I also use pure maple syrup. I serve this with homemade sweet potato fries, fresh sweet potatoes sliced into sticks tossed with a little olive oil, cinnamon and salt, baked til crispy. This dip compliments them beautifully! Thank you, thank you, thank you again!

I almost didn't make it because the idea of mayo with syrup seems odd. It's really good though. I used real maple syrup and real mayonnaise. Then I added cinnamon and a tbsp of honey. Mine came out much darker than the one pictured. But it's really good. I'm going to start putting this on baked sweet potatoes.

Edit: Mom had the idea to pour the leftover dip over vanilla ice cream. Then I had the idea to add a little spiced rum. Delicious!  This recipe is very versatile and so easy. Thanks!

Just what I was looking for---a restaurant always had this sweet, spiny dipping sauce with their sweet potato fries.  I like to add a little hot sauce/cayenne to zing them up!

Made with miracle whip dressing as I don't use mayo.  Added pure maple syrup, as that what I buy.  Perfect with Cajun seasoned oven baked sweet potato "fries."  Made again today adding 1/2 tsp Hot Mexican Style Chili Powder for handcut sweet potato wedges which I roasted with a bit of olive oil, salt and cinnamon.

When made as directed was way too sweet! So added more mayo and it was amazing! 
Close to the maple cream Applebees dip! Now I have a close and easy copycat when craving! 
Thank you!

Per the recipe, it was just ok. I made it again with modifications and now itâ€™s a very good dip for sweet potato fries. I used 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup, added 1 teaspoon brown sugar and a little cinnamon.

First time I had sweet potato fries was when I lived in Florida, at a Tiki bar. 
I've been searching for the sauce forever. 
Your sauce tastes very good.
I used real mayo, real maple syrup . I added half the juice from a lime and a little lime zest. It is exactly what I've been searching for.  Thank you.

I will make it again. I used mayo and cracker barrel maple syrup. I put half the syrup as suggested just because I know myself and how I'm not really a fan of sweet. I made two dipping sauces tonight to go with homemade sweet potato fries (in the oven) one was just mayo and Frank's red hot and this was the other. 
Thank you for the recipe. It seriously could not be easier and is super delishes as well.

Easy, fast,  healthy recipe for a dip. This dip was perfect with Air Fryer Sweet Potato Chips (from this site). As suggested I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise. I also used pure maple syrup. I would suggest adding the syrup 1 Tbsp at a time then  tasting it to achieve the exact amount of sweetness you want. I added a pinch of salt too because I like a little salt/sweet combo.

Used plain Greek yogurt and organic maple syrup. What's a bit on the liquid side but totally delicious.
 Also went well with my well seasoned turkey burger topped with red peppers yellow peppers and onions.
 Sorry no photo to share, because I ate it all before I could get to the reviews.
