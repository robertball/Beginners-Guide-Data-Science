I was skeptical about this but I have a lot of tofu and peanut butter so I decided to give it a shot.  It turned out yummy!  I even used less than stellar ingredients (name brand peanut butter and a store bought oreo crust) so I imagine that if good peanut butter were used along with a decent homemade cookie crust it would be even better!  It was more trouble to make than I thought it would be but that was because my blender is not very good and all the peanut butter was too heavy for it and I had to keep stopping to mix the filling by hand.  I ended up putting in 400 grams of peanut butter and adding about a 1/3 cup confectioners sugar in addition to the honey.  I also put a bit more salt and topped it with chocolate sprinkles.  The texture is a little strange when it comes out of the blender but it freezes up nicely.  edit.  my husband had some of this and loved it!  He said it was as though it were from a restaurant!

Made it exact for a pot luck.  A lot of people tried it, including myself.  I got no compliments or request for the recipe.  The second pie sat on the table.  I personally did not like it either.  Something was just off putting about it.

My whole family thought this pie was delicious!  It's so high in protein, too.  I used a low-sodium peanut butter and I left out the salt, because we are on a low-sodium diet.  Otherwise, I followed the directions.  The filling was smooth and tasted wonderfully of peanut butter and honey.  The pie was great with no topping at all.  It did take a little longer than 4 hours to freeze solid--more like 6, but that might just be the difference in freezer temperatures.  Thanks for such a great addition to my healthy desserts collection!

I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this one!  Our whole family said it was dangerously good!  We substituted melted chocolate chips for the honey, and omitted the pie crust.  Next time I make it, I will use an oreo crust, still use chocolate instead of honey, and add chocolate chips after blending.  A whipped cream topping would be great too!
