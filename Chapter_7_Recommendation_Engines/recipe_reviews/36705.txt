This is a great recipe that has good taste and best of all has very little fat.  I used pena, but I think it would be great with just about any small pasta or even tortellini.  The only thing that I was surprised about was the spinach did not wilt much, but that was not a problem.

This is a great salad to take for lunch, but I would include less tomatoes next time.  The tomatoes have a rather powerful flavor and it can be a bit overwhelming.  Overall, this was easy to prepare and lasted for several days.

A good pasta dish, but I wanted more flavor, so the second time I made it, I used flavored sundried tomatoes in oil and using the oil from the tomatoes I sauteed the garlic, tomatoes, spinach & added salt & pepper.  I then reheated the pasta, tossed in the sauteed mix and then garnished generously with the asiago & parmesan.  I will definitely make this again!

This is great with chickpeas as a well-rounded vegetarian meal.  I use baby spinach and sometimes omit the sun dried tomatoes for time or budget reasons.

I could only find sun-dried tomatoes packed with oil, so I eliminated the olive oil.  It was a great lite pasta dish, but I have to agree on decreasing the amount of sun-dried tomatoes.

The idea is good, but it needs some sauce and less spinach. The tomatoes give it an over bearing taste as well.  It was hard to choke it down as a left over.  Will not make again.

Spectacular.  Added extra Asiago and more garlic.  Hot noodles wilted the spinach.  Could use less sun dried tomatoes to taste.

I put all ingredients together and add the hot pasta on top and cover for a few minutes to wilt the spinach.  I then add the meat of a rotisserie chicken (preferably a seasoned one) and a little chicken broth and toss again before adding the cheese.  The seasoned chicken     really adds flavor and using broth helps  to add moisture without adding fat.  My family loves it.

I also added chick peas as recommended below for some more substance-it was quite tasty.  Two friends tried and both commented on how nice/colorful the presentation was too.

I had this dish in Disneyworld a few months ago & forgot to ask the chef for the recipe.  Found it on this site - this is the BEST spinach salad dish ever!!

This recipe has now been added into our rotation. We'll definately make it again, and again (and again). It was simple, quick and tasty. The minimal required ingredients added to it's appeal. The simplicity made it very flavourful without being over powering. The ingredients in this recipe compliment one another, instead of competing with one another. To top it all off, it was a lite pasta, which is rare with any pasta, let alone a pasta with cheese in it. It was even visually appealling. The colours of the sundried tomatoes with the deep, rich green of the spinach made it a mouthwatering work of art.

i made a couple of substitutions-- fresh tomatoes instead of dried, all parmesan instead of asiago & parmesan.  i really liked it, but my husband didn't.  probably won't make again!
