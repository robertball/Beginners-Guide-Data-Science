Ive made many quarts of tea at my age  and I knew when I read the recipe that 4 small teabags would not make a decent cup of tea - it would be too,too weak.  I changed the recipe drastically.  First, I used 7 teabags instead of 4, used 1 qt of water instead of 2 qts.  The cup of sugar to 1 cup water was too sweet so I used more lemon juice to my taste.  I did use  1 cup of orange juice.  The color of the tea was still very pale and not strong, though it did taste good - more orange flavored than tea flavor. I have a tip for all you tea-drinkers out there.  To keep your tea from getting cloudy add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda to the water while steeping the tea.  You should make 2qts of tea for this amount of soda.  It neutralizes the tannic acid which makes your tea cloudy.

Excellent! I made this exactly as written, and it was SO refreshing!  You can easily adjust the sweetness by cutting back the sugar, but I loved it just as is.

Very good! does taste better a few hours after making and next day. I went outside to pick some mint for this.  Flavors all go well together. I needed something different & this hit the spot.
Next time I'll use less sugar & another tea  bag, I like a strong tea. Thank you for this recipe!

Followed recipe exactly (using 4 large teabags) and it was great.
