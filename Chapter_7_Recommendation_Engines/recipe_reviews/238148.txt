I decided to try these for an end of the summer barbecue. And they were good. The cupcakes are moist and taste like lemonade! The frosting is very tart - and it was a little thick. I had to add a couple Tbsp of water. Also, next time I might try adding a dash of salt to the frosting. (They say the secret to sweet is salt.)

Just have to confirm what someone else said...the frosting CANNOT be mixed as the recipe is written. You must thin it out with something.
