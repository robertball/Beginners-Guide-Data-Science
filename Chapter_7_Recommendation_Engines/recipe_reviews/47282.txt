I made this for someone who I knew loved chocolate and cherries and it went over really well, as did the leftovers with all of my friends.  I did think the consistency was a little off, but I made it the night before and it was still good when I served it.

I made chocolate cups to serve it in by melting 12 oz of semisweet choc chips and 2 tablespoons of butter, then brushing the choc mixture onto foil muffin tins (about 1/4 in. thick).  Once they had set in teh fridge, I peeled off the foil and filled them with the mousse, topped them with whipped cream and a cherry and put them on a plate drizzled with chocolate and rasberry sauce.  It was restaurant quality (according to a friend).

MMMM Good.. Kind of too cherry. Probably my fault though.

This is a fantastic mousse. My family loved it. The kirsch really adds to the elegance of this dessert. I reduced the cherries to 3/4 of a can based on what the first reviewer had to say. Another keeper from Canned Food Alliance!

I really want to say good things about this recipe because I like cherries, chocolate, and mousse... but this recipe really didn't bring those elements together very well. I whipped the whipping cream until it became stiff, but after I added the hot, bleneded mixture, it became flatter and flatter, until by the time I put it in the fridge, it was like a liquid. I figured the only way to rescue it was to put it in the freezer and hope for a kind of refrozen icecream type of thing, which worked out as I predicted. I think this recipe would be better if there were some compromise between whipping cream and whipped topping, so that the mousse would be sure to have the lighter, flufier texture that it should. The flavor is pretty good, though. Will try to experiment again with substitutions for the whipped whipping cream.

I used the basic idea of this recipe and made a black forrest trifle. I cubed a chocolate sponge and place in the base of a good sized glass serving bowl and poured the can of cherries (minus most of the syrup) over the cake. I topped with  the mousse  - I doubled the chocolate and melted it (16 ounces or 250g and used good quality chocolate) and folden this into the whipped cream, which had 2 tablespoons of brandy essence and finshed it off with an additional cup of whipped cream on top and grated chocolate for decoration, I did make it the day before - trifle needs to sit to be any good.  This was excellent for my dinner party with little preperation!  Thank you for the fantastic idea, I was even asked for the recipe.

I made this last night- a double recipe.  It made a lot more than I expected.  I used the variation posted and made chocolate "muffin holder cups" which came out beautifully.  Very elegant looking.  The mousse stayed fluffy as I folded in the chocolate/syrup mixture and cherries.  Mext time I think I'll lightly chop the cherries for a more even distribution when folded in.  I also whipped the cream in my kitchen aid mixer a long time.  It was very thick and stiff which helped when folding in the chocolate/syrup and cherries.  My husband loved black forest baked items and thinks this is a classic favorite of his now!  A surprisingly easy recipe, although cherry brandy isn't so easy to find at liqour stores!  I think you could substitute canned raspberries for the syrup and Chambord just as easily for a raspberry mouse and garnish with fresh raspberries and mint.

I've been making this for years and it's my staple dessert to bring to a dinner party.  Never any complaints.  I have started chopping up the bing cherries as a whole cherry tends to be a bit much.
