Great muffins.  I used an off-brand of bisquick and instead of plain orange juice, I had banana/orange/strawberry juice on hand, and I didn't have any oranges for zest.  I added a tsp of vanilla and used 3 TBS brown sugar in the mix, instead of of white sugar.  I also mixed 3 TBS brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon sprinkled on the top. The variations did not seem to matter because these still turned out moist and my kids loved them. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These muffins are great!! They are so quick and easy, and ohhh , sooo good. I think I really like them better plain, without the sugar/cinnamon mixture and the honey butter spread, but they are delicious both ways. Sure made a big hit with my husband... Thanks Debbie

These are very quick and easy to put together. They are best served warm. The honey spread really seals the deal. They do dry out rather quickly, so they're not as good the next day. I used foil baking cups instead of greasing the pan. I also got 9 muffins rather than 12. They rose beautifully. Next time I might add some orange zest to the honey spread.

I used a homemade baking mix and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the muffin batter. I also do not keep margerine on hand, I used butter in the spread instead. This was not a hit here. I can see what the submitter was going for......we just didn't care for it.

Good muffins. Easy to make. The spread was good too, but I'm not a huge fan of honey. I like them better without the honey spread.

Made them with Whole Wheat mix.  They were good that way.  Made them because they are easy and I had some extra Orange Juice.

These are really good, but I wouldn't call them a muffin. Only slightly orangy and more of a biscuit.
