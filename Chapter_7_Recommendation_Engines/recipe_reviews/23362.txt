I am Polish - and I'm not just saying it - I immigrated to the US six years ago from Poland. This dish is actually called "bigos", not kapusta. You make it with mushrooms for Christmas Eve dinner - no meat for the Polaks that day. On all other occasions, we add kielbasa, bacon, or some pork meat instead. You can add some tomato paste to amp up the flavor. Bay leaf will also aid with the flavoring. You can make it just with the fresh cabbage or just with the sauerkraut - depending on what you like. Also - I've never heard of adding sugar to it - cut it - you won't miss it. One last thing - we make it in a pot on the stove. Originally, it's not a baked dish, rather, it's cooked.

a very different unique taste.  added sliced polska kielbasa to the mix, and then baked.  gave it a very good smoky taste.  will definitly make again.

this is similar to what my grandmother makes, without the mushrooms and bacon fat instead of butter. to save time use 1 whole head of cabbage, 2 large onions and 1 jar sauerkraut and freeze left overs so you have some on hand! i put in a roaster and top with knackwurst, cover and bake 1 hour, easy meal everyone loves!

My husband's grandmoter is Polish and this tastes very similar to a dish she served years ago. This is scrumptious- my teenage daughter ate 3 servings!
This recipe is not  hard- a little time consuming perhaps. To make Sunday dinner easy, I served this with a ready to serve spiral ham, buttered noodles sprinkled with cracker crumbs and poppy seeds, and a chunky applesauce (storebought). Rye or pumpernickel bread would go well with this.

This recipe is great as written.  I do, however, change it up a bit to make it a little heartier.  I place 2 pounds of country-style pork ribs on top of the mixture, cover the ribs with 8 oz. of beer, cover and cook it in a slow cooker for 8 to 10 hours.  When the meat is very tender, I remove it from the crock, cool slightly, and shred it.  I then add the shredded meat back into the cabbage mixture and continue to cook on low for about 20-30 min., until heated through.  I usually serve this with either egg noodles or kluski (potato dumplings with onions and salt port) and rye bread.

This is one of the better, unique, side dishes that I have tried in a long time.  It is so easy to put together and so tasty.  We especially enjoy it with kielbasa baked at the same time the dish is baking.  Thanks for sharing this one, Holly.

Wow!  This is a fairly easy recipe to make and it tastes great.  It might not be the most attractive dish, but the smells wafting from your kitchen as you prepare it make up for that completely.  I wanted a more rounded meal, so I added about 1/2 a pound of browned sausage to the other ingredients.  It made a great lunch.

I have been making this every Christmas for the last few years.  You don't have to add the sugar in this dish.  I've been making it without and it is just fine.  Also for anyone who is watching their weight, this is a wonderful side dish.

I am a "good German girl," and love kraut (and everything in this dish) but this just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't attractive to look at; the mushrooms cast grey color throughout the dish, and I had to add a little sausage to give it the gusto I felt it needed.  Maybe if I had a Polish grandmother, the emotional element would give this dish the boost I feel it so badly needs.

I am Polish and grew up eating this dish at the holidays with my family. I was always afraid to try making Poish dishes, but I gave this a try and it is great, I will definately make it again.  Thanks Holly---anymore Polish recipes would be grateful!(It still doesn't get my kids to eat cabbage tho!!)

hi, i am half Polish. My father always made kapusta. He burned flour in a pan untill light brown and then added water and the sourkraut and stirred until thickened, Then he added pork that had been fried.
The next day we always ate the kapusta leftovers with white beans. delicious.

There are many different versions of a great dish. Most on line are very bland or simple compared to mine. I have even changed mine a bit from what I started eating in diapers 47 years ago. I like mine with a pork meat for flavor, salt pork to make a gravy to thicken it up, potatos', kielbasa, mushrooms, not for the faint of heart about fat or sodium. I only make it once or twice a year, so I get over it quickly. for someone who has never owned a salt shaker for my table, I'm okay with holiday scarfing. but....if you got a family, and need to modernly make it quick and simple, I say go for this one. Just take a little more time on your cheesecake.

It almost tasted like the kapusta I've been making for years.  The things I did different were:  no portabello mushrooms, regular mushrooms only; add Polish kielbasa or sausage; add 1 lb. bacon; no butter and don't add sugar...this recipe doesn't need it. Use the bacon grease to saute onions and this gives the dish fantastic flavor. I also use a slow cooker and sprinkle coarse black pepper generously.   I start cooking early in the morning on medium heat and let cook for 4 to 6 hours when I shut it off.  Any leftovers freezes great!  If you are watching your cholesterol levels beware!

I used 12 oz bacon cooked and drained using bacon fat to sautee 2 large vidalia onions chopped.  Combined with 2lb. bag sauerkraut, 1 head cabbage chopped and pressure cooked, one 10.5 oz. can cream of mushroom soup and crumbled bacon.  Cooked low in crock pot for a few hours.  Delicious!

We make this recipe all the time, however we substitute the mushrooms with cut up potatoes, omit the sugar and use a clear lemon/line soda (sugar free). We also add meat counter quality polish sausage and it is requested from us anytime we go anywhere to bring this dish. It is amazing..

I am a polish vegetarian and was excited to find a veggie kapusta recipe, but I felt this was just okay, not great. Definately edible but probably won't make again.

I used 1/2 my fermented kraut with caraway seed and yes, half canned kraut (in case I didn't like it).  I also sauteed the onion and mushrooms in coconut oil vs. butter.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. 

I am sticking to a plant based diet and trying to eat fermented vegetables (yes, even I destroy the critters in there in some recipes by baking it).

I loved it (yes, even minus the butter) and was even eating raw before the oven because I was hungry. . .a lot of the reviewers says it needs a sausage or kiebiesa to go with it and that may be true, but if you are vegan or plant-based in your dietary regimen, this recipe is worth making also.

I made a few changes the second time I made this. I left out the mushrooms.I cooked the cabbage and the sauerkraut together with caraway seed. I then drained the cabbage after it cooked for a few hours. In a frying pan I put chopped onion, crisco and flour and browned it. I then added it to the cabbage and salt and pepper to taste. I then rewarmed it in a frying pan browning it a bit and it a a huge hit.. we liked it so much more than the original recipe.

This is delicious!  I actually opened a can of saurkraut by mistake so looked on allrecipes  to see if there was a meatless casserole i could make to use it up.   I happened to have portabellas on hand and some bacon fat so used that too instead of butter. I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been eating Kapusta for 60 years.....this is by far the best recipe I've had.  The family loves it!  The portobello mushrooms are a must. We do part butter and part olive oil for health reasons. 
Thanks!

Not sure what I was expecting, I guess - but baking sauerkraut certainly doesn't make it taste like anything but sauerkraut. This was okay. Sauerkraut with onions and mushrooms, basically.  I wish I'd halved the recipe, it's going to be hard to eat all this (it's just me).

Pretty good first effort. I threw in kielbasa yet it wasn't ideal variety. I was surprised I liked it yet it had an interesting combination. Not sure I'll rush to make again.
It is a very big quantity so I'd reduce it a bit.

I was looking for a dish to have at Wigilia, the traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner. I found this one and it was a hit! My mom said it was even  better than her recipe. Very easy to make and leftovers are fabulous as well. Thanks for sharing this super easy side dish!

Thank you for an inspiring recipe! I added bacon, white wine and chicken stock because that's just what I do.  But this is great and I was glad that it was here when I came looking.

This was really good but I'll be adding more mushrooms...just because their so good.  Here's a twist...I made this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/moms-turkey-sausage-patties/detail.aspx
 as a meatloaf and served these two together. It was awesome. Give it a try.

Definitely will try this. My father made it all the time when I was young. Was sick of it then but would LOVE to have it again! Does anyone know if you can freeze any left overs? I'm thinking me father did freeze this but want to make sure. Many thanks!

I'm polish and never even heard of this recipe, so we had to have it. We added cheese on top. Its very similar to another recipe I make that has kielbasi on top. Will definitely make again.

An easy and tasty dish, even my children like it. I add a pound of sliced, skinless smoked sausage to the sauerkraut; the sausage adds so much to the flavor of this dish. Leftovers freeze well.

turned out totally dif. then my Polish Grandmothers Kaupsta. If I was grading on taste alone it would be a 4, but factoring in the look of it puts it down to a 3 in my book.
