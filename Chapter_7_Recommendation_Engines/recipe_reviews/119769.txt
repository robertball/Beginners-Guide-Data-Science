I'm giving this a 4 but doctored up i would give it a 5. I did the whole thing in the crockpot and just put fresh boneless chicken in the bottom, topped with onions, celery and garlic. I mixed the other toppings and poured over the top. I did NOT saute the veggies, I just put them in as is. I also used the same amount of salsa and tomato sauce (instead of ketchup) and used 1/2 the amount of the other ingredients for fear it would be too zesty. My family LOVED it!!

This is pretty good. It kind of reminds me of manwich. I added sweet BBQ sauce (probably like 1/4 a cup) to it, just to make it more BBQ-ish.

I also do this in a crock with boneless chicken breasts.  Made this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  This recipe is also great for pulled pork.  Same ingredients in crock pot over pork.  It also went over well at the bridal shower.

i needed to use up some leftover barbecued chicken in the fridge and this easy recipe fed 3 of us. We thought it was more like sloppy joes with chicken than bbq tasting. This was simple but didn't make our favorites. Thanks these were very filling and The Hungry Teen had two.

Needed something quick for dinner & had most of the ingredients, so decided to try it-Very good & easy, used all salsa & served it over rice. Used the last of my rotiserie chicken & will definetely be doing this again-hubby really loved it, too. Thanks for a great recipe w/room to be inventive.

This is great! I followed the recipe pretty closely but left out the Worcestershire sauce (I didn't have any) and the brown sugar.  We used it as an alternative sub sandwich filling.  Everyone enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Wanted to do something with some leftover rotisserie chicken. 

Only a couple of minor changes. I only had about 2 or 3 tablespoons worth of salsa on hand so i used it and added about 1/2 cup of Jack Daniels Original No.7 BBQ Sauce. I also added an extra clove of garlic for personal preference. 

Tasted amazing, will definitely be making this again in the future. Thanks for sharing it with us!!

Absolutely delicious! I follow the recipe exactly except I used can tomato sauce in stead of ketchup. I will double the recipe next time because for us it only made 3 sandwiches.

First time making this and it was good. I added a little more worcestershire sauce, and add a dash of rosemary with the veggies.

This was really good. I increased the serving size to 16 people since I made it for my husband to take to a pot luck lunch at work. I ended up boiling and shredding the chicken the night before. I combined the chopped onion and celery with the chicken and put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning we combined everything in a crockpot. So when he got to work, he just turned it on low and let it simmer for 4 hours. Everyone loved it and said that it smelled wonderful hours before lunchtime!

This was a great recipe!  I cut raw chicken and cooked it with the butter/onions/garlic and it turned out wonderfully!  Great combination of spicey and sweet.

I liked this recipe. I did what others suggested and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Also skipped the celery for my own liking.Came out good. Thanks!

This was great in the crockpot with boneless skinless chicken breasts and all the same ingredients. I cooked it just over 4 hours on low and it was a hit!

I was looking for a real bbq taste so this didn't work for me. Honestly, if you like sloppy joes then this IS the recipe for you. While cooking it I even kicked up the chili pepper to 2 tsp and it still had to much of that sloppy joe "tangy" taste.

My family enjoyed this dish, although the kids thought it was a little too spicy. If you have kids with sensitive palates, I recommend using a mild salsa.

I made this for my boyfriend and me and we both loved it. The only thing I would add to it is to find some sort of dipping sauce to add on the side...but I would definitely suggest this to anyone!

I thought this was quite good, certainly a nice change from plain chicken breast burgers. Will be making it again. Thanks for sharing.
