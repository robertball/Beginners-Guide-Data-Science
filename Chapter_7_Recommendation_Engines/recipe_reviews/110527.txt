We really like this with cinnamon grahams and light whipped topping. To really make the light frozen whipped topping even more decadent (and to make it stretch a little further), wisk together a 3 oz. package of sugar free INSTANT pudding mix and a cup of fat free milk, then fold the whipped topping into the pudding. To fancy them up a little, it's great to dip the sides in sprinkles or chopped nuts.

Fabulous frozen treat! I used light whipped topping and it was hard to wait an hour for these but it was worth it. Great recipe for "ice cream sandwiches" that's practically "guilt free".

Very kid friendly to prepare and eat.  We also made a variation -- honey graham crackers, a thin spread of melted chocolate and whipped topping.  This combination tastes like frozen s'mores.

I took this a step further and mixed the whipped topping with strawberry yogurt. Absolutely delicious without the guilt. Thank you!

This is SO easy, and SO easy to modify!

I love adding a bit of pistachio instant pudding (just a preference). You can dip the graham crackers in chocolate and coat one side with chopped nuts for a nice fancy treat, and/or drizzle with chocolate.

I've tried this same variation with the addition of vanilla instant pudding and Libby's Easy pumpkin pie mix with cinnamon grahams, or honey grahams with drizzled white chocolate over the top.

You can spike it up as much as you want.

Absolutely delicious, thank you for posting!

Excellent recipe, Sarahlue.  Easily adaptable with flavored whipped toppings now available. We sometimes spread just a little Nutella on plain graham crackers before putting them together, and have even used that great Milky Way spread from a jar. Both are nice and thick, easy to spread LIGHTLY. Plain grahams & original flavor whipped topping however, a great way to go to keep things simple and keep us on track with the diets. Thanks again for sharing this one.

I've made these yummy sandwiches for some time now and they are such a great guilt free dessert.  The only thing I would like to improve on them is to find a way to make the graham cracker softer to bite into like the real ice cream sandwich you buy in the store.  It can sometimes be a little messy to eat as they break apart as you bite into them.

WOW. I had my doubts as to if this was going to be good. But it really surprised me.  I used the chocolate raspberry Newton cookies (which are flat and crispy) instead of crackers. And I used fat free cool whip.  It was great, I mean its not ice cream (but thats the point).  This is so simple and quick to do and it freezes fast.  Will definitely try different cookie combinations or mixing peanut butter or mint into the cool whip!

I was delightfully surprised how good these were when they were served at our Cowboy Church "Healthy Herd" weekly get together.  If you didn't know better, they tasted like they were made with ice cream!

Taste like a traditional icecream sandwich but doesn't have the depth of icecream yet it is still very good. The frozen whip topping doesn't freeze as solid like icecream does but for what this is it is great. Works well for a diet using lower fat ingredients.

I like these better made with fat free frozen organic yogurt (Stoneyfield, slightly softened for easy spreading.) You can change-up the flavors of frozen yogurt. Good with honey graham crackers, too!

These are so easy and very tasty!  I used the extra creamy version of the whipped topping and it was super good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
