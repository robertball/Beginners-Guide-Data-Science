This was good. I added a little shredded cheese to the mixture and then melted some more cheese and turkey on the top. This is a great brunch recipe.

These were fun and fabulous! I made exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. The only one thing I think they could have benefited from is cheese. The texture of the batter was pretty thick as it was so I'm thinking you'd have to add more milk if you were going to add cheese but I do think cheese would be a big bonus. Regardless, these were fun, easy,  and tasty and I will make again.

12.16.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255096/kitchen-sink-hash-brown-and-egg-waffle/ ... The idea of this was better than the result; but when I topped with a fried egg & a hit of shredded cheese?   From three to four stars.  The waffle solo is kind of bland & not as crispy as I'd like.  'Thinking a little melted butter or oil in the batter could help that; & less milk.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

What a neat idea for something different, tasty and hearty!  Simply Potatoes hash brown potatoes work great.  Upped the onions.  And it gives my waffle maker another use.  Im thinking about trying this with leftover mashed potatoes next time.  Keeper recipe!

I used tobasco instead of saracha, and seasoning blend instead of salt. turned out terrific. Husband was pleasantly surprised.
