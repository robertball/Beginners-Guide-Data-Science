My husband loved this!  I made it with Homemade Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce from this site and it was a hit.  Will definitely make again.

Very good!  My only changes was adding minced garlic with the onion, and using spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  One full box of pasta and a full jar of spaghetti sauce are the proper amounts.  If you like a little spice, use hot sausage or add some red pepper flakes.

This is a very tasty dish but not anything extraordinary, which is why I gave 4 stars here.  I used smoked turkey sausage and Hunt's garlic and herb tomato sauce.
