I'm in LOVE with this recipe. I don't use cloves or bay leaves, I use only 1 teaspoon cumin, I use two tablespoons of oregano, I don't use cayenne or any peppers besides the black pepper and about 5 chipotles in adobo sauce  (and it's spicy enough that way)  but it still tastes amazing. These are just little changes I've made throughout the years. I honestly think it's better than store boughs. I've made this at least two dozen times and it never fails.  I put it in the slow cooker for usually eight hours on low after about an hour on high in the beginning. Or you can do 5-6 hours in high. Sometimes I don't even brown the meat and honestly it turns out almost as good as so if you're in a hurry don't feel bad about not browning the meet.  We eat these like a quesadilla, so I take a tortilla and then I put some sauce (ranch or copycat Taco Bell quesadilla sauce) and then I put shredded Gouda or mixed white cheeses and the Barbacoa and I put another tortilla on top and I just fry that in a tiny bit of oil in my cast-iron pan on both sides until it's melted and it is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Top with guacamole and dip it in ranch and you'll definitely make whoever is lucky enough to eat this very happy! I have a pot cooking right now.  I usually double the recipe, it heats up great so leftovers never go uneaten, no matter how much I make!

I've fallen in love with the chain-store simply because of their barbacoa. This recipe squashed that romance, and started a new one. Thank you whoever made this delicious recipe!

My husband loved it, a little on the spicy side.  I didn't have apple cider and used apple cider vinegar instead, not sure what it would taste like if I had used the apple cider but it was delicious.

I like very spicy food, but let me warn you:  I made this recipe as directed except that I reduced the cayenne pepper to one teaspoon (rather than the tablespoon called for), and it was still about as spicy as I could comfortably tolerate.   So depending on your tolerance for heat, you might want to eliminate or substantially reduce the amount of cayenne you use.   In any event, this was a very flavorful dish.  I'll be using the meat for tacos, taco salad, etc.

Wow, this was so good!!! I made as-written except didn't use cayenne - just because I couldn't find it in my pantry, and after the serrano and all the chipotles I wasn't too worried about making it spicier :) I used a pork butt with this marinade and it was SO. GOOD. Marinaded it in the blended stuff overnight then slow cooked with the onions, bay leaf, and stock.  I will hold onto this one!!!

I have never eaten at Chipolte's. I did not know what to expect, my whole family really enjoyed this! My son has stomach issues so I did omit the serrano chili pepper and cayenne pepper. I also omitted the cloves and salt. I used beef broth for the chicken as well. I find meat shreds better when cooked overnight, I put the frozen roast and sauce ingredients in the slowcooker at bed time, cooked for 12 hours on low, shredded and defatted the meat, removed the bay leaves, put the meat back in the sauce and left on warm until dinner time, it was very tender and flavourful. I made home made tostadas from corn tortillas and served the beef on top with all the usual toppings, rice and cucumber salad on the side.

Really good but I made some small changes. First, If you're looking for that traditional gelatinous thing that happens with barbacoa, you should use beef check instead of a roast. Cheek shrinks, so I used 4 lbs rather than 2 lbs. I didn't use oil and skipped the skillet all together and went straight to the slow cooker. I had to add some extra salt in the end. I served it with Mexican rice, black beans, lettuce, avocado, homemade tomatillo  salsa, sour cream, tomatoes, peppers and soft tortillas. Very flavorful! Thanks for the recipe!

Pay attention to the cooks note on this one.  We love spicy food but this was even too much for us. I actually cut back both the cayenne And cumin seasoning by one half. Served in taco shells with sour cream, tomatoes and cheddar cheese. Wonderful  flavor but hubby and I both paid for this meal all night long. If you love spicy, definitely try this recipe.

Used two serrano peppers and fresh hot spicy oregano from my garden in place of dried. I also used a 3 lb roast, so I increased the spices accordingly. I did not think this was too spicy at all, but it was flavorful. I will probably add more peppers or spices next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Watch out - this makes a very spicy barbacoa. I only used 1/4 of the cayenne and omitted the Serrano and still had a spicy result. I love super spicy food, but I prefer a savory meat and add my own spice using salsa or hot sauce. Adding this much spiciness to the meat took away the savory quality in meat that I love. I felt like it covered up the yummy flavor. Next time, I’ll follow this recipe and leave out the Serrano pepper and cayenne. The adobo chilies will give plenty of kick.

I made exactly as written and my guests all loved it but I would say to omit or really reduce the amount of cloves. It was all I could smell and I could certainly taste them!

I THOUGHT THE VINEGAR OVERPOWERED THIS DISH.  I would maybe try again and omit the ACV myself or use the chilies and omit the sauce.  We didn't care for the flavor at all.  :(

We loved this! It was a little too spicy for me, but my spice-fiend hubby was enamored! This was at the center of the chipotle copycat night so I’m thrilled it turned out so well. I didn’t bother pan searing it before the crockpot, I didn’t had the optional Serrano, and I used apple cider vinegar in place of the apple cider because that’s what I had on hand. So yummy, try this one!

Followed the directions. Incorporated the cayenne pepper and the serrano pepper, too. Wow,  we live in the south and those two things made it super, super spicy. The flavor was good but much too spicy. I would make it again but would only use the chipotle peppers with the adobo sauce along with all the other spices listed. It was very tender and delicious with pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream!!

Don't think I'll make this again; it has too much heat to be enjoyable for your average palate. The smoky chipotle was interesting but I'm still on the fence if it was the *good* kind of interesting. It may have been too overpowering. Glad I tried it, though. Yes, I followed the recipe as-is.

This was almost a tad too spicy for my liking, although it was still quite good.  Amount of spiciness is a personal preference and is a simple fix by reducing the amount of cayenne (or other pepper) in the dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used a Poblano pepper instead of a Serrano pepper. Everything I followed to a T. Very good! Spicy if you use the cayenne pepper etc. I would recommend!
