Yummy! We didn't have the ingredients for the glaze, so I made a lemon drizzle with lemon juice and powdered sugar.

They were really dry and crumbly. I make your simple scones recipe almost every week with different stuff added in and I'm never disappointed.

Made these for the first time and do enjoy them. I may tweak the original recipe a bit. I love molasses and ginger so I want to play with getting even more of those flavors to shine.

This recipe worked just as it said! Very good, just the right amount of gingerbread taste. I didn't use the icing provided, just powder sugar and lemon to the drizzle consistence. Great!
