This was very good. I used mayo as one of the other reviewers did. I also brushed the bread lightly with olive oil(what can I say I'm Italian). I placed the meat on the light side of the bread, as the edges toast nicely when they go back into the oven. I have to say- I tried the mix cold before putting back in the oven with the cheese- I like it even better! It tasted great both ways, but it's nice to know you can use it as a cold appetizer too...thanks!

This was easy to make, however, I found the 2T of sweet relish was WAY too much. The relish overpowered everything else, including the crab. I wish the recipe had more "kick" than sweet. 

I also made this as a dip in a shallow bowl and served the baguettes on the side. (Less labor intensive this way.) It's better if you mix the cheese into the overall mixture as well, instead of just putting it on top. You could still sprinkle some cheese on top if you wanted.

This stuff is sooooo yoummy. I was looking for appetizers for a wedding and I almost passed this one up. I am so glad I didn't because this was a recipes that everyone raved about. The only change I made was to use mayo instead of miracle whip.

my mom's version is with American cheese and on pumpernickel bread, without the celery & relish.  She would also use canned shrimp... This is one of our family favorites during the holidays!!! Yummmm!!!
