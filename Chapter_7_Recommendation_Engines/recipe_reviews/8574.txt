Thank you for sharing this recipe, I made a few changes based on the other reviews and to reduce cooking time.  I added additional turmeric. However, word of advice on that; turmeric is one of those spices that become more flavorful when cooked, so it's imperative to do a good browning of it when it's first added (so don't add too much!). I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I cubed the chicken breasts and seasoned them with garlic salt, pepper and cumin prior to browning. I used chicken broth instead of water, however, I think I will stick with water next time. After squeezing the juice from the lemon, I tossed the lemon in the pot to simmer along with the chicken (of course, I removed the lemon prior to serving). :)  Also, I used canned chick peas which I added at the very end, since they didn't need to cook, but just warm up.   We ate this over couscous with a side of green beans (I know, not very exotic, but the green beans went well with the dish). My husband and kids all loved this dish. On a side note, my hubby ate chili peppers with his - he loves spicy food - and said it was fabulous.   We'll definitely be making this again, very delicious!

This reipe needs cumin and up the tumeric to a tablespoon. This is a North African inspired dish. I live in North Africa, here we put cumin in evrything. Also change the vegtable oil to olive oil. It is better for you and tastes better. Also add some salt to taste.

This was pretty good.  I cooked this in a pressure cooker because I hadn't soaked the chickpeas - I used 4 cups of water, 1 cup dry chickpeas, frozen chicken pieces and cooked on high pressure 40 minutes - other than that I followed the recipe as instructed. It wasn't drop dead fantastic but it was a good dinner choice and I will probably make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome.  We just moved, so I only changed a few things because of what I had on hand.  I did not have an onion, so I used two small apples instead.  Worked really well I thought, and I had chicken sausages with mango and jalepeno, I diced, browned and simmered.  It simmered for a few hours, but it was wonderful.  Will keep!  Served over wild rice and served with a cool salad.  Thank you!

Pretty good if you spice it up with some cumin and red chili paste.

I was really excited about this recipe but it fell flat. The flavors were bland and no amount of additional spices helped. I served it over couscous which gave it nice texture.

I used the suggestions regarding the tumeric and cumin. Flavors came through great. Tasted very good.  Will definitely make again.

I used chicken breast cut into cubes and chicken broth instead of water.  I also added carrots and zucchini.  Next time I will add the zucchini later so they aren't over-cooked and I will try adding cumin as other people have suggested.  Although this was not super flavorful, it was a good hearty meal that I will definitely make again!

It is very good and easy recipe. I made it exactly, but after cooking everything in the pan I deglazed it with white wine and added that to the sauce. Serve with steamed asparagus, slice of lemon and sprigs of cilantro
