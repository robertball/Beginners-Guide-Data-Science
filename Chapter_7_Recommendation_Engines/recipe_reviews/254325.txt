This was very tasty and easy to make, which I loved. Made the topping in advance which made this an even easier weeknight meal. I made exactly as instructed (hate when people rate based on their own version of a recipe). Not five stars only because it was very tasty but not WOW-delicious. Will be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Made as written except that I let it cook a little longer and this turned out fantastic! I honestly expected the topping to run off and become a watery mess but it stayed on top perfectly. I typically don't care much for oven baked chicken and prefer the grill but I can't say enough good things about this one. Definitely a keeper!

This chicken recipe turned out to be a gorgeous presentation on our dining table (I submitted photo to prove it!) I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of  frying up two strips of Trader Joe's applewood bacon and crumbling those up instead of using bacon bits.  The chicken turned out extremely moist and tasty. However, I didn't give this 5 stars only because the mesquite seasoning was just too strong of a smoky flavor for me and the family (in additions to the smoky Tabasco chipotle flavor). I realize the bacon added a smoky flavor, too, but it was the overly strong mesquite flavor that overpowered the other flavors. I'll definitely make this recipe again, but change out the mesquite for a milder spice alternative . Probably will add a teaspoon of regular Tabasco to cheese mixture to give it some more heat. The possibilities of different ingredient combos are endless! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a family favorite and in frequent rotation. So easy, flavorful, and lean. Sometimes with bacon crumbles in it, sometimes not.

I made this this evening. I used boneless pork chops, instead, and cooked it at 425 degrees for 24 minutes. The pork was juicy and everyone absolutely loved it! I switched the tabasco sauce to the lower sodium, milder Jalepeno sauce so my daughter wouldn't complain about it being too spicy. 

The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because the nutrition information isn't provided and I had to recalculate the amounts of certain items to be able to stick to my husband's dietary restrictions. 

This is my favorite dish I've made for quite some time, and I will most definitely be making it again.

This had so much potential, but yet was so Bland. Topping taste great, but it does not add flavor all over the chicken, it's like two separate things. My chicken breast were thick, maybe if they were thin it would have been better, but as it was the chicken was very Bland and then had a piece of delicious topping on it.

This is so good. I left it baking a little bit longer because my chicken was thick but it is still so juicy and so delicious.

Thank you for this recipe, Desirae! It was absolutely delicious! My picky 7 year old said this was the best chicken that I have ever made. And I don't cook chicken too often because I am always afraid it will be too dry tasting. I followed your directions exactly except I mixed about a 1/3 cup of sour cream in with the mayonnaise. We loved it! Thanks for sharing.

The flavor of this is good.  I have never known a chicken breast to cook in 16 minutes though so I can't give it 5 stars.  As one would expect, it took closer to 45 minutes to cook.

I didn't have any .mesquite spice or chipotle Tabasco or smoke flavoring.  I would like to try it with the right stuff!  I used Applewood seasoning and Crystal not sauce.  I also need an oven thermometer, it took 25 minutes before the broil time!  Did not find Tabasco brought and chipotle sauce at the store and chose to try Cholula brand instead.  Imported from Mexico.  This is the Kind, very flavorful, does not burn your tongue off!  Still did one with no seasoning for toddlers.

This came out really good! I omitted the bacon but I think next time I will add it.  I also added some black beans just because I had them on hand and that turned out pretty good too.  I will definitely make again.

My husband and I really liked this.  Very flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly except for subbing a sour cream for some of the mayo as I had some to use up, and I baked it for closer to 25-30 mins.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using regular tabasco.  I didn't have any and I felt like the mesquite was going to be strong enough

Confession, I think it is unfair when you change many parts of a recipe & then rate it, but this is what we had on hand that was similar.  Others can be upset with me, but I think this is great how we had to adjust.  I didn't have mesquite seasoning so used Trader Joe's South African Smoke Seasoning.  Thought this might be close.  Then when I saw 3/4 tsp of chipotle flavor hot sauce with Tabasco brand as an example, I thought no way.  Regular Tabasco is very hot & over powering so didn't want to chance it. Instead I used Spice Island Chipotle seasoning & some liquid smoke. I did grind the Chipotle seasoning, but next time think I'll just take from jar instead of grinding it. Also add a little more liquid smoke per hubby.  This I baked at 400 as directed, but will reduce to 350 for 30 min because I thought the chicken was a little tough & usually I do chicken at lower temp for longer time.  The chicken was juicy. Hubby said with the substitutions I had to make, this had a hint of smoke flavor & kept your taste buds wanting more. Hence a little more spice & I'll stick to what I used instead of purchasing the correct stuff.  I don't know what this should've tasted like, the original recipe, but we gave it a 5 star using my alternatives.  If you don't have everything on hand, maybe my ideas will help. Will make this again using my substitutions.

I halved the recipe ‘cause there was just two of us. I made my own Chipotle spice (just googled it) and used shredded cheddar because that’s all I had. I also used regular Tabasco because I didn’t have the Chipotle kind. Despite all the changes it was still delish. Will make it again.

Very good!  I used chipotle peppers as opposed to chipotle seasoning which was a great flavor.  I also added garlic.  Rave reviews!

I was unable to find Chipotle hot sauce so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It was delicious and my family has already requested it in the menu for  next week.

Great, moist chicken main dish.  Very easy, the only change I made was, after reading the reviews, an increase in cooking time due to extra thick chicken breasts.   Definitely a keeper!

Didn't have any idea what I was going to make for supper tonight.  Came across this what seemed to be a pretty straight forward recipe and thank goodness it was.  This will be a go to recipe for my family.  My three young judges gave me an 8.9/10 for tonight's meal.  Let me tell you that they don't give out awesome grades like that if it's not truly to their liking.
Since I didn't have the mesquite spices, I made up a Latin version (cumin, garlic powder, salt and sazon Goya).  I also did not put the hot sauce.  I replaced that with pepper paste.  Mind you, I made these changes ONLY because those were the ingredients that I had on hand.  Respected everything else and served it with Pilaf rice.
Thank you for this recipe :)

Delicious, will make again. Needed a little longer cooking time than 16 minutes depending on breast size. Chicken was so moist!

Excellent!  The whole family loved it and I  will definitely make it again.  I didnt  have any green onions so I  sprinkled onion powder in the mixture.  I will buy green onions for the next time I  make it.

So, I really should have looked in my refrigerator before starting making this recipe...  But, anyway, I used mesquite flavored barbecue sauce instead of the seasoning and was intending to make the rest mostly according to the recipe.  However, when it came time to mix the bacon bits in with the mayo, I found that they were all gone!  Out of desperation, I decided to use the leftover pepperoni that we'd gotten for some homemade pizza that we had already made.  I fried it to get rid of some of the grease and threw it in.

The chicken ended up being a hit with everyone!  The kids all wanted seconds, even!  Thank you for this excellent recipe :)
