Great omelet that you can definitely feel good about eating! I used egg beaters vs. egg whites and a whole egg for this. The red pepper flakes give this a really nice "kick" and just the right amount of heat. I left out the green pepper and instead used 2 Tbsp. of chopped green onion. In addition to the fresh spinach and mushrooms I threw in some tomato. The Parmesan and Cheddar cheeses were a really nice combination. This was perfect with whole grain toast and chilled OJ!

i opted for the non-healthy version and it was GOOD: 4 whole eggs, half a small tomato (diced), half a green onion, and 2 cups of spinach (it welts alot) and the same amt of dry ingr. instead of mixing the cheddar cheese into the egg mixture, i waited until it was almost cooked, sprinked a hand full on one side of the omelet, and folded it in half. YUM!

While this is not a particularly creative recipe, it's tasty and nutritious nonetheless.  You leave the breakfast table knowing you did something good for yourself. Submitter directs to use some egg whites, but I couldn't go that far - I used four whole eggs.  I was impressed that she called for just a small amount of olive oil, although I needed and used more like a tablespoon.  And while the recipe calls for cheese, it's a reasonable amount, not gobs of it - on that I stuck to the recipe.  I eliminated the red pepper flakes, giving this a few grinds of fresh ground pepper instead.  All and all a great omelet - but one you will more than likely have to plan ahead for, unless you just happen to have all the ingredients at hand.

i used a type of "egg-beaters" from kroger instead of eggs. LOVED IT... very simple. used up some salad fixings when you get tired of eating just cold spinach salads.. divided it into quarters and put each quarter into a clow carb wrap for breakfast onthe go... girls at work were envious.. wanted to know which carry out i got it from  :)

I used red pepper instead of green and I did increase the amounts of the peppers and onion. I also used butter instead of EVOO. One of the best omelettes we've ever had--my husband and I really liked it. Our kids refused to try it. Too bad for them.

This is a very tasty versatile recipe. I substituted low-fat cheese, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. A dallop of salsa and a dallop of light sour cream served with a whole wheat tortilla (from Trader Joe's, they're the best) and you have a great healthy breakfast.  And you can sautee any veggies you like to go in it. If you want to serve this on a school or work morning, just chop the veggies the night before.

An awesome combination of flavors! I ate the whole thing myself. I didn't have any green pepper or spinach, so I just used 1 c of mushrooms and 1/4 c onion. Next time I'll add the cheese right before folding it in half.

Mushroom Spinach Omelet Haiku: "I love me some eggs! Nice little red pepper kick. Parm cheese is good too!" /Licks lips. I occasionally swap broccoli for the mushrooms, and, just my preference for preparation, I sometimes fold the pre-sauteed veggies inside the omelet, but the end results are always scrumptious.

Yummo! This is a super yummy recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I replaced the mushrooms with red bell peppers (allergy), and used green onions instead of the regular onion. Also added some fresh parsley, and it turned out delish!

Excellent recipe... a couple minor changes using orange bell pepper (no green on hand) and I had half a tomato to use up so diced that and threw it in.  Awesome with the red pepper flakes and it certainly was a change using parmesan cheese (fresh grated) along with the cheddar.  The amounts of cheese are perfect, anymore and you defeat the 'healthy' aspect of this breakfest omelet.  I started the omelet on the stove, but I like to finish mine under the broiler, eliminates the step of 'lifting' while cooking stovetop and cooks quicker with no fear of burning the bottom.  I added the cheese last, sprinkling it on top and it gets a nice crisp texture from the broiler.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe handy, as others have mentioned, any veggies will do, so experiment! Thanks for the recipe...my tummy is now sated :)

I love this omelet! The spices give it a great flavor. I also add some dice tomato to the veggie mix before adding the eggs.

This was really good! I didn't have egg whites in a carton, and didn't want to waste eggs, so I just used 2 eggs. It still made 2 servings as suggested. I really liked that it used 1 cup of spinach and some other vegetables. Plus, the amount of oil and cheese was really sensible. I have had vegetable omelets, but never one with spinach. The spinach and mushroom are a great combination. For the mushrooms I used thinly sliced portabellas. The garlic powder gave the eggs a nice flavor to. The only thing else I really changed was not using the red pepper flakes and only using a sprinkle of black pepper for personal preference. Mine did stick for some reason. I may just saute the vegetables next time and make the egg part separate and see if that will work and just maybe reduce the salt a bit as parmesan cheese is plenty salty. Great healthy recipe. TY

Very tasty! I used fresh baby spinach, fresh mushrooms, green bell pepper, small red onion and 1 egg  plus 3 egg whites. I followed the recipe directions and cooking method. I did not have any cheddar cheese on hand so I just used mozzarella in its place along with fresh grated parmesan reggiano cheese. I omitted the red pepper flakes and just used more fresh ground pepper. Easy to put together, fresh tasting and savory. I am used to omelets that required folding it over in half or thirds. This was a nice change to let it sit and cook until eggs were set and then cut into wedges. I served this along with some fresh cut local fruits (pineapple, strawberries, cantelope, honeydew melons, etc.) and a thick slice of Hawaiian Sweet Bread!

Definately do not omit the crushed red peppers.  I did the first time and it was bland but the 2nd time it had a blast of flavor. So good!

Chopping the veggies so fine gives it a very sophisticated texture and layers the tastes, as compared to the chop-chop job i usually do... definitely worth the extra bit of effort. (we made them less healthy, using whole-eggs, and should have increased the veggies to accommodate) this would be AMAZING w/ some goat cheese or smoked cheese instead... (but what wouldn't be?)

I really liked this!  It was spicier than I thought it would be, and I used the stated amount of crushed red pepper.  I don't really know how to make an omelet so I just scrambled everything together.  Would have been yummy in a tortilla!

This is almost a duplicate of a dish I make using red peppers instead of green.  I frequently use Swiss cheese instead of cheddar; when I do, I also add some bacon to the mix.  I could eat this dish morning, noon or night and be completely satisfied.

(This review is based solely on Mr. LTH's input, as I'm not an omelette eater)  "It's good.  I give it 4 stars.  It's not the best omelette I've ever eaten, but I'd eat it again."  I made it per directions, though I had some leftover sauteed mushrooms and onions from burgers, so I just heated them in the saute pan.  I also used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites and realized we had no spinach so that was omitted.

Really good! Used a pint sized carton of egg beaters and about 1/4c skim milk .....amped up the amount of veggies, used about 1/2c each of shredded cheddar and 2% mozz. Also made this frittata style in a glass pie plate. Served with whole wheat toast,  perfect meatless Friday dinner and healthy and filling to boot. Thanks!

This was so yummy! I used liquid egg whites for the eggs. I also used freshly minced garlic and mozzarella cheese. I made this twice. The first time I followed the directions and poured the egg whites over the sauteed vegetables. By that time, the PAM dried up and the egg whites stuck to the bottom of the pan. The second time I made it - I sauteed the vegetables, then removed them from the pan, cleaned the pan and resprayed it with PAM, and cooked the egg whites on one side. When the omelet didn't look jiggly in the middle anymore, i topped it with the cheese and vegetables and folded over one side. The omelet came out so light and fluffy and delicious this way! Yummm!

This is now one of my favorite "go to" recipes when I need something quick to eat, especially for dinner.  I love all of the fresh vegetables! An 8" skillet is way too big.  The eggs barely spread across the skillet and it's not very omelet like. I would definitely use a smaller skillet or add more eggs.

the addtion of garlic powder, red pepper flakes and pepper was the missing ingredients for bland omelettes, I used 3 whole eggs very good! I plan on adding 1/8 onion powder next time.

I am transitioning into the world of eggs (I don't like them!) - so I made this omelet with all egg whites. It was YUMMY! I did add some extra onion - I love them. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, maybe I'll be brave and try it with whole eggs really soon!

Make sure you use fresh spinach, not canned. I made it with canned spinach and we didn't like it at all. If used with fresh spinach, you won't be disappointed.

Also, beware of the skillet size when you increase the recipe quantity.

This was delicious, and easy to do. The only change I made was to use fresh minced garlic for the saute, and broccoli instead of spinach, since that is what I had! Thanks for another go-to recipe!

I made individual omelets using all the same ingredients except using one egg and one egg white. I didn't have garlic powder so I added a pinch of minced fresh garlic when I added the spinach.  I loved the idea of pepper flakes in it and garlic! D-E-LISH!

I don't really like eggs but I make myself eat omelets for the protein-packet breakfast; this combination made eating the omelet good!  I should have used just one egg instead of two because with all the veggies it was too big for me (didn't measure them out, just chopped and tossed them in).  I didn't put enough salt in my egg mix, but that was my mistake.  Also, instead of the open-face style, I stuffed half the ingredients into the folded omelet, just out of habit.  Next time, I will follow the method in the recipe as it seems sooooo much easier.  Thanks for a tasty breakfast!

We really enjoyed this omelet.  I used the whole egg, rather than just the whites.  This recipe is a delicious way to eat spinach, even for spinach haters like myself.  I will make this over and over.

This came out great but the veggies inside were a little bland. I used only half the salt on the eggs and added the other half of salt to the sauteing veggies.

Delicious! I beat together 3 whole eggs and 1T cold water (to make them fluffier).  I also sauteed the veggies, took them off, and then made the omelet the traditional way (wait until the eggs are nearly cooked but still moist before adding the veggies on top, and then folding in half).

Best omelette I've ever made. I don't care for mushrooms, however, so I left those out but added some diced fresh tomatoes. I also sprinkled the cheddar over the fillings toward the end instead of adding it to the egg mixture.

Good omelet. I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving , using 2 whole eggs. I don't like it when I have Leftover egg yolks or egg whites in my fridge. I try my best not to waste food, but I either forget about them till they are not safe to eat anymore or I end up using them making desserts.. Macaroons or Chocolate mouse anyone ? :-). I am better off eating the whole egg than, eating a skinny omelet for breakfast and a rich dessert after dinner.

very good! my 3 year old can"t digest cow dairy, so I used some goat feta instead of the suggested cheeses, and used fresh minced garlic vs the garlic powder. I also added some coconut milk in with the egg since I wasn't using a "gooey" cheese. It was delicious!

This was very good...even scrambled!  I am a little challenged in the omelet dept. so I just cooked and scrambled a bit.  I added  a few cut up grape tomatoes with the spinach. I left out the cheddar cheese and right at the end added some feta cheese crumbles.  YUM!

Tasted great. i used 4 whole eggs instead. My complaint is with the presentation... it was nearly impossible to get the top to set, even by lifting up the edges. I finally just flipped the whole thing over, but fell apart. Any tips for me? Taste was great though. Good way to get in some veggies.

Excellent!  I have made other omelets before using mostly egg whites and have always loved them, so this one was a success too - loved the addition of red pepper flakes!  Didn't change a thing and hubby and I both enjoyed this for dinner, thank you!

I really like this recipe, except I would omit the salt. For some reason mine turned out kind of salty, and no, I didn't use garlic salt, I definitely used garlic powder. I'm not really a fan of salt anyway, so it makes sense. Also, to add a little color, I used 1 tbsp of red bell peppers in place of one of the tbsp's of green bell peppers.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I used celery instead of green pepper, used about 40% more spinach and then scrambled as opposed to made an omlet.  Remember when scrambling to stir as little as possible until the end.  I stuffed this into a tortilla and topped with a few pieces of Turkey bacon.  I receive RAVE REVIEWS everytime!

I was looking for an easy and delicious alternative to my usual breakfast and this recipe fits perfectly. The multiple ingredients provide layers of flavor and it was ready in about 20 minutes. It even works without mushrooms (I didn't have any).

This was delish!  I made this using 4 whole eggs & a little bit of water so it wasn't so thick.  I also used shallot instead of onion.  I kept it covered until it was almost done, then I added the cheddar cheese & covered again for 3-5 min.  Turned out perfect!

Such a great omelette recipe!  The spice mixture in this omelette is perfect and not too over-powering so that you can still taste the egg.  I used 3 whole eggs rather than the egg whites and Italian Blend cheese (Parmesan, Mozzerella, Asiago, Romano, and Fontina), and I served it with sour cream.  Lovely!

Excellent!  Very fast and easy and very flavorful.  It says it makes 2 servings, but I would double it. we were still hungry for more.

Very, very good, but slightly too much garlic powder.  Next time I make it I will double the recipe, but use the same amount of garlic.  The recipe as posted isn`t quite enough for two, but more than enough for one (we eat light breakfasts here).  I will make it again.

This is delicious.  I like the idea of using just 1 whole egg and the rest egg whites.  I will make this again & again.
