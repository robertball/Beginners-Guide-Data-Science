Made these for the Thanksgiving get together with family and everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly, except not necessarily McCormick brand spices. Left dough in frig overnight. Did not ice/decorate as everyone liked it as is. Baked only the minimum 8 mins. and they came out nice and soft. I only got 17-18 gingerbread men but might have made them alittle thicker. Longer bake time may make them crispier if you like that way. Family asked me to make more so started a new batch on this day after Thanksgiving. Will maybe freeze some for longer storage.
2nd batch-rolled dough a bit thinner-1/4 inch or less. Got 26 cookies. Tried baking a few for 10 minutes and turned out too crisp after cooling. Recommend 8 minutes but may vary with ovens.

When I first baked these cookies I did not like them.  I thought that they were very bland.  Because I could not decide what to do with them, I wrapped them up and stuck them in my freezer.  I took a couple out last night and WOW are they good.   The flavors all came out and they are excellent.  Also they seemed to be softer after freeezing.  I am so happy that I didn't throw them away!

This is an excellent recipe - I made these for a Christmas cookie decorating party and was really pleased with the results.  I would recommend rolling the dough out as instructed (to 1/4" thickness).  I first rolled the dough out too thick and my first couple of cookies were too puffy and cake-y.  After rolling the dough to 1/4" they turned out perfectly.

I am so sorry my 14 year old niece made these while I was at work yesterday she probably did not measure the spices correctly. And then she left the review before I came home. Again I am sorry I can't figure out how to take it off.

I got ahold of an electric mixer, and I'm glad I did...the reviewer who suggested I needed one for this recipe was absolutely right! Anyway, now that I've made these cookies, I can finally put in my two cents--having never made gingerbread before, I really didn't know what to expect, but this was quite a painless recipe! My dough was a little on the crumbly side, but I suspect it was an error on my part. Additionally, they taste more like molasses than ginger, but maybe that's because I used Black Strap which has a very obvious flavour! Anyway, I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were ok, but I would have preferred to have an extra TSP of ginger in there.  Also, these are more of a soft cookie, even when rolled out thinner and left in the oven a little longer.    TRICKS to easy rolling.  If you are in a rush, put the dough in the freezer to harden.  Then roll out right on the parchment paper.  Cut out your shapes leaving space between each cookie so you can just lift off the excess around the cut outs and place directly in the oven.  No "bent / out of shape" cookies.  Cookies swell when cooking, so if 2 are stuck together, don't pull (you could pull and arm or a leg off!!! oh no!!) just use a sharp thin knife to push through the area and seperate gently.  Voila!  Great cookies.  :)

Very nice cookies.  We didn't notice the 4 hour chill time though so weren't able to make them until the next day.  The dough was way too hard coming out of the fridge so had to wait a bit for it to warm up.  Very crispy and delicious!  Will definitely put these in Christmas cookie rotation.

If I could have I would have given this recipe 2 1/2 stars. It's not terrible, but I found them to be a bit bland. The consistency was good, but overall the flavor was mediocre. Maybe use salted butter or increase salt a little, add cloves, and use more ginger.

No complaints about this recipe. I am making it for the 2nd time today. I made this a week ago (exactly as the recipe instructs) and the cookies lasted just one day (meaning we ate them all). The aroma filled the house with the most wonderful of scents.  Mmm... can't wait for my second batch to be baked.

Delicioous cookies. Just right softness.  Do not refrigerate longer than an hour.  The dough becomes too stiff to roll out if refrigerated any longer.  Will make these again, for sure.

these turned out so great!  i doubled the spices as we like our gingerbread spicy, and they're delicious.  These were the first roll-out / cut-out cookies i've ever made, and they turned out fabulous---i figured out to roll the dough when it is still cool between two sheets of parchment paper:  easy peasy!  Thank you!

My kids loved these cookies. I rolled them thin because they do plump in the oven. To do this I just rolled them on parchment paper and left them on it and stuck it in the oven.  As others suggested I took them out after 8 minutes of baking. They were strong enough to decorate, yet soft and chewy.  The recipe yielded 23 cookies. The kids loved decorating them too.  I used this recipe to make the icing, put it in snack bags with different food coloring and the kids piped it on them.   I will definitely make these again. Thanks.    1/3 cup butter, softened  2 cups confectioners' sugar  1 tablespoon milk  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)  food coloring

Yum!  These are really great!  I rolled the dough out to a little thicker than 1/4".  Had to throw the dough into the freezer at one point (it warmed up quickly and was too sticky to work with).  I pulled them out before I thought they were completely done and left them to cool on the cookie sheet.  They were perfect!  Soft and delicious!  I used the icing from Delilah's Frosted Cut-Out Sugar Cookies on this site (but added about 1/2 tsp almond oil to it).  So yummy!  The kids decorated the gingerbread men with raisins and M&M's, because that's all we had.  What a fun activity.  We will make these again.

These are absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I made the dough and stuck it in the freezer since I knew I wouldn't get to make the cookies for a few days.  And I made them exactly like the recipe called for only not using McCormick. I found the dough easy to work with.  Rolled it out with wax paper or just flour.  The flavor is amazing...they are not too spicy.  Just right in my oppinion.  This will be my go to recipe for Gingerbread cookies for now on.

These are pretty good. I usually use a recipe with real ginger but did not want the hassle of grating ginger so I used this recipe. The only downfall is they are not gingery enough for a gingerbread cookie. I will use this recipe again, I'll just use more ginger.

This recipe was amazing. I'm an amateur cook, and these were so easy, I always look for this one. I wanted to be able to flex with ginger snaps and gingerbread, so instead of nutmeg, I used cloves. they tasted great and everyone I've given them to LOVED THEM TO BITS. Some suggestions though, The thinner they are, the easier they harden, as it, it gets hard if it's thin, so make sure you smooth it out right. The two dozens is pretty correct, every time I make them I have around 2.5 douzens, or maybe it's just me. If you want to cut some fat out, you can limit the butter to a 1/2 cup and lower the sugar just a bit as well. I'm baking them right now, and the smells just brings a smile to my face. You can also lower the heat so it doesn't easily burn but it takes a few minutes more. This is good especially for those who like the thinner cookies.  This is a definitely keepsake recipe alright !

This recipe is great.  instead of piping on decorations in icing I dipped the feet and the head in dark chocolate and let them dry on wax paper, once they were dry I piped white chocolate along the top of the dark chocolate  to create little fur topped boots, I also piped a white chocolate pom pom for on top of the touque.

The dough will be very sticky to work with so it is important that you coat your hands and bowl with flour and then form the dough into smaller clumps (no bigger than the palm of your hand). Also, you'll need to work fast - roll, cut, place extra back in fridge.  If you're going to try to make the batch all at once, put the warmer dough balls in the freezer so they get colder faster as you work.  Otherwise, these cookies are great and get better with age!! The family loved them!!

These cookies tasted good (not enough ginger flavour for me) but the process was very trying.  After lightly flouring the surface and the rolling pin and following all the directions the dough refused to behave and stuck to everything like brown gorilla glue.
I had to flour everything several times and almost gave up.  Having persevered, I can say it was worth it but will not use this recipe again as it lacked ginger flavour and was just too hard to work with

The dough for these cookies was great to work with. I prefer more spice though and will up it by 1/2 what is called for next time and see if the adjustment is good. Otherwise very good recipe.

I made these last Christmas and these were Delicious. They were the first to disappear and the only ones the family asked if we could make another batch of once they were gone! Only reason I say 4 and not 5 stars is the prep time only says 20 minutes BUT the dough needs to be refridgerated for 4 hours or longer, When I furst made these it set me back in my cookie schedule because it wasnt included in the prep time breakdown.

This was the stickiest recipe for gingerbread EVER!! I had to add lots more flour to keep the dough from sticking.  The only thing this recipe has going for it is taste!

This was our first try making gingerbread men, and they were fantastic!  The first batch was a little sticky to get off the counter so we used more flour (our definition of lightly floured must be different). They taste great, the kids love them.  Used a simple powdered sugar/vanilla/milk recipe from BHG for the icing, very good!

I have revised my post from 2 to 4 stars after tasting the cookies with icing on them AND after sitting in a zip-lock baggie in the cupboard for over 24 hours. With icing and in baggies, the cookies seemed much, much better-- they softened up and tasted nice. So, if you use this recipe, I recommend a good icing, and let them sit at least overnight, in baggies, to soften up and "mellow". Here's my original post, so perhaps to prepare you for what they are like right out of the oven...  I followed the recipe exactly and was very unimpressed. The cookies are bland and heavy on the molasses flavor, there's no ginger taste, or even cinnamon for that matter. If I try again I will add 1-2 t more of ginger and sub in 1/4 cup plus 2 T of white sugar for 1/4 cup of molasses-- hopefully that will increase the sweetness and drain out the strong molasses flavor in these. I give them 2 stars because they taste very ordinary. I think perhaps a little orange zest would be good in these as well. Anyway, I tried. Oh, and as someone else said, the dough is very sticky and a bit difficult to handle and work with. You'll need lots of extra white flour for the rolling pin, hands, and surface for rolling out the dough. Merry Christmas! :)

Great!!! Softest gingerbread cookies I have ever made! I had to add a lot of extra flour when rolling them out, as the dough was very sticky. I had some trouble with that at first. Otherwise, they were perfect! I didn't cooked them for exactly 8 minutes and let them cool for a couple of minutes on the tray before moving them.

These cookies came out very well but the dough is very sticky even after being refrigerated overnight.  I had to use a ton of flour to roll the dough out but the cookies were very good.  The only change I made was 4t fresh ground ginger instead of the dried.  8 minutes in the oven and they were soft and chewy; 10 minutes and they were crunchy like gingersnaps.  Good either way.  I decorated mine with royal icing.  (don't care about the raw egg whites; that is why you have an immune system) They came out looking like classic storybook gingerbread men and tasted great.

This recipe is not only very easy to make, but delicious! I decorated the finished gingerbread men with store-bought cream cheese frosting and used it to pipe on gingerbread men decor, faces and hair. I used either red hots or red or green M&Ms for the three buttons on each gingerbread man. If using red hots, make sure to place them on the gingerbread men before baking so they 'stick'.  Enjoy!

These cookies taste great. However, I refrigerated overnight and tried to roll out the dough, but it was way too sticky and I had to knead in about 1/3 cup additional flour. Make sure not to roll too thin, or they will be very crunchy.

Great recipe, I saw it and I said to myself now that's a gingerbread cookie! I did have a problem rolling them out but that is only because I added a little too much butter and was to impatient to let them rest in the fridge for 4 hours. So I made them like a drop cookie and they turned out really good!

the dough was super hard to work with when taken straight out of the fridge, it wouldnt roll and cracked..when i left it to rest, come to room temp and kneaded it a few times, it was so much easier then.so make sure to take it out before you plan to work with it..but super tasty and soft from the inside

When I was younger I didn't care for gingerbread cookies but for some reason I wanted to try them  this year (I'm 43 now). I stumbled on this recipe and made them-OMG, so easy and so yummy! I had no problems rolling and cutting out this dough. They are moist and delicious and I loved decorating them! I'd give them more stars if I could. Definately will be making these more often!

These cookies are fabulous! We followed the recipe to a T and they came out amazing. We opted for cooking them for 8 minutes, and they came out slightly soft with crunchy edges. We decorated them with a Butter Icing ... blissful!

This was an absolutely wonderful dough to work with!  I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated the dough over night.  I had no difficulty mixing in the flour with my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I baked for 8 minutes and they came out slightly crispy.  The cookies held their shape well after baking and I decorated them with a thin glaze and sprinkles.  Will definitely make again.  One more thing; I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper.  This eliminated the need for extra flour.

This was my first attempt at making gingerbread and this recipe was great!

I used black treacle instead of molasses as that's what I had in my cupboard.

Perfect ginger taste!

- It's now many bakes later and this recipe is cooked all year as my daughter loves this gingerbread!

I made these last week.  After baking for just 8 minutes, they were soft and chewy.  The amount of spice was just right for my taste.  My husband also thought they were delicious!

Great recipe.  Dough was easy to work with and the cookies turned out fantastic!  More of a soft gingerbread cookie.  i don't even think they need icing-the cookie is good as is!

These were good, but I definitely recommend doubling the cinnamon.

These turned out really great.  I was hesitant while I was making them because I'd never smelled molasses before and thought it smelled disgusting, but once baked they have a very nice flavor.  Be sure to use a lot of flour on your surface when rolling or they'll stick!  Looking forward to making them with my son next year when he's old enough to enjoy it!  :)

This is the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have tried. Wonderful flavor and a nice soft cookie. If you like the crunchy gingerbread cookie, I don't think this is the recipe for you.

This is the best gingerbread recipe I've used.  I topped the gingerbread men with the gingerbread icing recipe (from this site), and they were very good.

My family loved them. Even my husband ate them and he claims he doesn't like gingerbread.  I did find the dough difficult to work with.  A little dry.  I used water to keep it together.  It may have been that my brown sugar was a little dried out and I put the dough in the fridge over night.  Will definitely make them again.

The cookies were delicious. I took them to work,  every loved them! The cookies are soft in the inside which I love.  I also used this recipe for a Gingerbread House. It worked great! Since I like cinnamon I added 3 teaspoons instead of one.

People ate them but no one commented on how good they were.  I thought the molasses was too much (and I used regular, not blackstrap).  I'm giving it 4 stars because it was a fun cookie to make and no one said it was bad.

I followed the recipe very closely, except that I put my dough into the freezer for two hours.  It was still very sticky and I had to use a lot of flour to roll and cut it, but I think the final product has a very good texture and classic gingerbread taste, albeit perhaps more mild than some gingerbread.  Good for picky eaters who may not like the strong taste of ginger so much.  8 minutes was the perfect time for my oven.  Some of my cookies were thicker than others and they baked up more soft, but the thinner ones are still not overly crunchy.  I was able to get between 30-35 cookies by using small cookie cutters in the shapes of stars, trees, and candy canes. Thanks for a simple, dependable recipe.

I liked these cookies, but I found it lacking in a ginger kick.  If I make these again, I will definitely add either half or a whole teaspoon of extra ginger, and perhaps some grated fresh ginger as well.  I wasn't patient enough to wait four hours, so I separated the dough into batches and stuck them in the freezer for about an hour.  I rolled them between wax paper, and I would recommend having some flour to keep your hands from sticking.  I baked them for about 8-9 minutes and they were aesthetically pleasing.

I made these and they worked well. I added 50% more cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I also rolled thinner (cooked for less time then) and used small men to get more yield. Other than one batch I forgot to take out, they were great. I froze a bunch and will take out and decorate nearer Christmas!

What a tasty recipe!  I made the gingerbread for a house, and it turned out beautifully.  The gingerbread was soft, airy, and most of all... delicious.  I definately had the best tasting house out of all our friends.  I even won first place in a gingerbread house contest!

This Gingerbread recipe was so nice that I made it 13 times in 2009. I recently made them on Christmas Eve when I was also cooking the Deluxe Sugar Cookies. Like i replied on Deluxe Sugar Cookies add a dash of pumpkin spice to add some flavor. May all you have a happy new year. :)

This is a great cookie! This version really lets the spices take the limelight...not overly sugary at all! It's nice to have a cookie that highlights ginger and nutmeg as the stars :)  Yes, the dough did crack, and needed a lot of flour not to stick, but it was well worth the little bit of extra rolling pin elbow grease in the end!

I would give 4.5 stars if i could.  This recipe has more of a buttery smooth spice and almost caramel flavor that most people would enjoy with a bit of chewyness, but I absolutely love gingerbread cookies with a little more crispyness on the edges and ginger spice bite to them.  Next time i will add 50% to all the spices and see how they turn out.  But for anyone wanting to make a perfect gingerbread cookies to bring to a gathering I suggest these cookies, they are universally excellent since not a single person could just eat one and they are not too hard to make.

These cookies are ideal.  I changed very little, but I did only add 1/4 cup molasses because I am not crazy about the flavor of molasses.  To make up for it, I made a molasses consistency syrup of brown sugar and water-about 1/4 cup.  It worked perfectly.    One thing I wish I had known before hand was that when I went to roll out my chilled "disk" of dough, the ends split so badly that I felt like I didn't have a good surface to work with, after each time we used the cookie cutters, we re-rolled and put it the thickness that we wanted the cookies and froze it for a couple minutes.  these cook up beautifully.

These turned out perfect!! They looked like I bought these from a bakery and tasted that way too. The combination of this recipe and  Royal Icing II By: Kristen Pontier  ( I found on here) they made the perfect cookie. The dough was not too sticky. I put my dough in the fridge overnight. The frosting recipe I found on here is the perfect consistency! This recipie gets 5 large stars from me.

These were amazing! The dough was rather hard to work with while adding the flour. It was also tough to roll it out with the rolling pin. However, they turned out really nicely - perfect combination of crunchy yet moist! I made some royal icing: beat together 2 egg whites and 2 tsps lemon juice, then slowly beat in 3 cups of powdered sugar. Yum! Definitely making again next year!

I have NEVER made gingerbread cookies before, but you wouldn't guess that after making these cookies!   This is a super easy recipe that I will use time and time again. I followed the recipe as is and the cookies came out perfect after 8 mins of bake time. I first made them on a Saturday, and on the following Sunday, I had to make ANOTHER batch because all the ones I'd made were gone!   Thanks for posting! This will be my #1 recipe for gingerbread cookies!

A huge hit this holiday season - perfect amount of spice and easy to make. Used a simple icing (vanilla, powdered sugar, nf milk) to decorate.

People kept asking for the recipe.  The cookies stayed soft through out the two days they were on the table. Also - I let the dough sit in the fridge for 36 hours.

These Gingerbread Men are perfect once baked, however, the dough is difficult to work with if it is not refrigerated long enough.  My first batch was refrigerated overnight and was easier to work with, but the second batch I made was only refrigerated for a few hours and stuck to everything.

The cookies turned out really well, with easy-to-manipulate dough, but were under-spiced.  Double the spices and you will get perfect cookies - guaranteed!

We made a double batch and they are good. We chilled the dough for 20 hours and then when we got it out pf the frig,I thought we would never be able to roll it out. We jad wrapped it saran in three discs so we microwaved each disc for 20 seconds,. the dough rolled out nicely and we coud lift the cutouts to the pan without breaking. Nice taste too. although   I would loke more spice but i don't know which at this point.

I've made this recipe 5 times, no complaints, its a keeper in my kitchen, One thing i'd add is that it definitely works better using an electric mixer, the consistency is more well umm... consistent. Mix up and enjoy with a cup of hot cocoa, yum!

I made this recipe and the gingerbread boys also found on this website.  Since my children have begging me to make gingerbread cookies with them.  I am not a huge fan of gingerbread.   I found this recipe was very user friendly, but found it warmed quickly and had to be refrigerated a few times during the cookie making process.  Of the two recipes I made my children much preferred the taste of the McCormick gingerbread cookies over the other ones we made earlier in the day.  I did try them and must say they did taste pretty good but I preferred gingerbread boys over this one.  Between the two I'd say that this recipe is more traditional.  I would definitely make these again for my family.

This recipe made a nice soft and chewy cookie, but the flavor of the molasses was much too strong for my liking.  Maybe that can be changed with different brands of molasses??  If you aren't a fan of molasses either, try "Gingerbread Men" on this site.  It doesn't have molasses, but was a great, milder alternative.

The flavor is good and the dough was very easy to work with.  I had hoped it was a little crispier though so I’ll continue looking for another recipe.

I just made these, and they turned out great. Just a tip: the dough warms very quickly after you take it out of the fridge (and I had chilled it overnight), making it impossible to work with. I had to put it in the freezer for 15 minutes twice during my cookie-baking. Not sure what I could do differently, though, other than perhaps chilling the rolling pin and/or freezing the dough (although I don't know if freezing it would ruin it).

These gingerbread men were amazing. They were super easy to make and were great when rolling out. They made my kitchen smell amazing and they tasted as great as they smelled! Make sure not to over bake them, which can lead to extremely crisp cookies. These will be my go-to recipe for the holidays!

Make sure you do not bake these too long. They taste great if baked the right amount of time. Too long and they're nothing special. Also, instead of leaving the dough in the fridge for hours, try rolling it on and sprinkling it with flour while cutting the shapes. Much faster and easier and not sticky, since the dough was still sticky once it got out of the fridge.

Excellent cookies for ease of making and taste. Chilled dough in fridge overnight and then let sit out about 10-15 minutes before rolling. Used normal amounts of flour to roll. Loved this recipe and have already had requests for it after making this Christmas.

LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it.  We're dairy free so we substituted the fat to Fleishmans, and I've noticed that using fleishmans, we tend to need to add another egg which is what I'm going to do next time.  Really love it, totally delicious and love it

These were really good. We went exactly by the recipe. We think they taste more like molasses cookies though since you can hardly taste any ginger.

Great recipe! Very simple and easy to follow. I had most of the ingredients at home so that was a plus! The first time I made them, I didn't notice the chill time. They came out kind of bland. But I tried again, and chilled the dough overnight. What a difference it made!

Pretty easy to make, the dough is a bit stiff right out of the fridge, but softens a bit which makes for easier rolling.  Baked 9 min, came out perfect.

Loved these cookies.  My husband said they were the best gingerbread cookies I have ever made.  He seems to think the ones I have made in the past are "too gingery" and these are perfect.  I only made one small change and that was: a pinch of cloves instead of the nutmeg.  I personally do not like nutmeg so I don't use it.  These are very tasty and cook up nicely for decorating.

Awesome cookies. I made no changes. Use a light colored cookie sheet as I did use one light one and one dark one and was better able to control the correct doneness on the lighter color pan. They taste mild which is the way the kids and I like them.

Very easy, whole family loved them!  Followed the recipe exactly, definitely easy to work with the dough when it's chilled.  We only worked with about 1/3 of the dough at a time, but we had little hands helping so the process was a bit slower ;)

I followed the recipe except that I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup Crisco.  Classic, delicious gingerbread cookies.  The 8-minute recommendation is spot-on.  I made some smaller cookies and baked them for about 7 minutes.  I had fun icing them with a simple powdered sugar, milk, 2 drops of vanilla icing.  The kids enjoyed decorating and eating them too.

My Grandmother and Great Grandmother used a recipe very close to this one, and it's always been such a big hit with our whole family. And this year my grandmother has turned the Christmas duties over to me, and she requested I make the famous Gingerbread Men Cookies. I can't wait to see how it all turns out.

These are very very good & soft gingerbread men:)  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!  although.....I made this batch x 4 so I didn't have quite enough molasses.  I probably only used 3/4 of what the recipe called for, but you could still taste the molasses in the cookie.  Also, I loved the softness of these, but I might keep them in the oven for 9 minutes next time just to give them a slight crunch, otherwise they just don't seem like genuine gingerbread men.  BUT all around great, thanks so much!!!

Makes a great tasting cookie, easy to roll out, and good for icing, too. Tastes a lot like the gingerbread cookies I grew up on, except they turned out a little crunchier than I hoped. But over all... seems pretty foolproof!

These are the PERFECT gingerbread cookie recipe!  Simple royal icing is the perfect touch to these little guys.  They turned out soft and just right.  Yum!

Liked them.....Loved them.....Gonna do them again.   I have to say my kids and I had a three day cookie marathon .....and these were not only easy, but fun to make and full of flavor.   The only problem we had was trying to find a nice cookie cutter in the gingerbread man shape.  But, once we did, we had a blast!!!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! My sister and I don't even like gingerbread cookies, but these were out of this world. I followed the recipe exactly (just added a splash of vanilla) and let the dough chill overnight. Instead of rolling them out and cutting them into men, I just rolled them into balls and baked them as I would a normal cookie (still only for 8 minutes). I got a soft and flavorful cookie that was so good! I drizzled some white chocolate over them and then sprinkled some red/green sugar to make them look festive. After I tried them I immediately made a second batch of dough that I will be baking today!

The recipe was easy to put together, but like another person mentioned, the dough was crumbly.  Once it harden, it was great, but I did need a lot of flour on my surface so the dough wouldn't stick and break.  Overall, good recipe.

This recipe was super easy and delicious.  I actually put the dough in a large ziploc in the fridge for a couple of days before I had a chance to bake them.  Turned out great!  It's hard to stop eating them!

perfect cookies, no icing necessary, thinner cookies are like ginger snaps, thicker are sturdy for gingerbread house building.

This is such a fun recipe. I always love making things like gingerbread men during Christmas time. It has a homey feeling to it. This recipe is kid friendly and super easy. I recommend icing these as well. They have a nice flavor and they're fun for everyone.

Used fresh ginger instead of powdered ginger. Could be a bit spicier, but great texture and flavor.

Used splenda instead of sugar and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour.  They kept their shape very well and were tasty.

Overall a pretty great, trustworthy recipe. I didn't have time to let the dough chill in the fridge so I put it in the freezer for a short time and that seemed to work out great-the dough wasn't too hard to work with. I found 8 minutes were more than enough for the cook time and would recommend taking them out promptly. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because in my opinion the cookies were really lacking flavor- and that's after I put in an extra tsp each of ginger, cinnamon and vanilla! I highly recommend using 4 tsp ginger and at least 2-3 tsp cinnamon if you love flavorful cookies. However I would definitely use this recipe again with the added spices.

I followed the recipe exactly, and as others have said, the dough was just too sticky, even after chilling as directed. The only way that I was able to salvage the dough and get it firm enough to cut out shapes was to knead another half cup or so of flour into it. I am giving  2 stars only because the flavor was ok (but just ok). Needs more spices for sure.

wWarning! The way the directions are written  it's not very clear  right away that it's a SEPERATE bowl that the flour in the first list of ingredients should be in and if you don't do that it goofs up the whole recipe. I made them in a previous year and they were good. I'm not sure how this is going to turn out.

These were delicious! It helped to make sure that the dough wasn't too hard before rolling it out but once I learned that and once I floured my surface sufficiently, they came out just perfect! I used a smaller cookie cutter for a second batch and should have taken them out at 8 minutes but 10 minutes (in a gas stove) was perfect for a bit larger cookie. They do expand a bit in the oven so make sure not to overcrowd.

I tasted one when it came out of the oven. I thought the next batch I would add more ginger. My daughter arrived home a couple of hours later and grabbed one on her way in (I store them in the cold garage). She said they were awesome, just right the way I had baked them. So I took a bite and realized the flavour had intensified over that time. In the end, the recipes stands as is.  Will definitely be adding this cookie to my Christmas cookie list.

I never knew I loved gingerbread cookies until this recipe. I’d recommend rolling them out pretty thin because they kinda puff up and out. Nice spice level and they taste great on their own, unfrosted.

They were pretty good. They came out soft and were firm enough to decorate however the taste wasn't as spicy as I'm used to. Definitely needs more spices.

Followed recipe exactly for some soft and tasty gingerbread cookies. I have a convection oven, so I lowered temperature to 335 degrees and baked for 8 to 8.5 minutes.

Just made these. So easy. The dough was great and very easy to work with. I added more spices, but I always do to every gingerbread. I’d make them a little thicker, but I prefer my gingerbread a little softer. 
Will definitely make again.

As I always do when I make spice cookies or cakes, I added quite a bit more than the recipe calls for, and 1/2 tablespoon orange zest.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  Refrigerated overnight.  It is not a normal cut-out cookie dough - it gets soft very quickly, so it is difficult to work with.  I followed another reviewers suggestion of rolling and cutting directly onto the parchment and just sliding the parchment onto a chilled tray.  I got 23 5” gingerbread boys, rolled to about 1/8” thick.  Baked for 11 minutes gets a perfect cookie with not a lot of crunch, but still gives a good break!  Even though you are re-working the dough several times, they cookies still turn out just the same - The orange zest makes this an out of this world flavor!

I made them exactly as the recipe states. They are pretty delicious and my son loves them. Next time though I would like to try some fresh ginger. I like my cookies a little spicier.

For whatever reason this recipe is extremely sticky during the rolling and cutting phase. I tried using it chilled and I tried using flour. And sticks to my hands, the rolling pin, and to the parchment paper. Do not recommend this recipe.

Very yummy cookies. Just make sure not to overbake them otherwise they’ll be too dark and burned on the bottom, like mine. The cookies themselves taste good, especially with icing. I’ll definitely be making these again.

My 3 Grandsons did enjoy these but I did cut them a bit thicker than recipe called for since they enjoy a softer style cookie. I refrigerated my dough overnight (what a mistake) as it made it tough to roll out the next day. Bake times I found are depending on if you like a softer cookie (take out sooner) or crisp which leave it in longer. Not overpowering on the spices, just enough that you do notice it.

Six or seven stars if I could. THE BEST GINGERBREAD COOKIES EVER!!!!!!!!! This is a prize winner, I think. They came out of the oven golden brown, it is perfect. Everything is perfect, I think. This is probably the best cookie I ever made. We have never made gingerbread cookies before. It is also relatively easy to make. This is probably our best first-time-made-cookie SUCCESS!!!! Unbelievably good, so I highly suggest it.

The dough came out too sticky, I had to had tons of flour to it as it would not roll out. I even left it for a day in the fridge. I need to give it another try to be sure I did it right.

**We prefer a spicy cookie, so I added 1/2 tsp ground cloves, increased ginger to 2 1/2 tsp, increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, and increased nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. With the additions, this is a very tasty cookie! When I made them before, I found the flavor to be a bit bland (as others had stated). We also prefer a crispy cookie, so we baked for 10 minutes (rolled out to 1/4"). My 8-year old took over the rolling, cutting, and baking, so it is not a complex dough to work with.

This dough is way too wet to roll out or use cookies cutters with. I left it in the refrigerator for two nights, and it still was not hardened. I scraped it off of the plastic wrap and my hands... I must have added at least another half cup of flour before giving up and making them into drop cookies. The taste was good but they're gingerbread men without the men.

Perfect gingerbread people!
Using suggestions from others, I modified the recipe and used 1 teaspoon cinnamon;  2 teaspoons ginger; 1 teaspoon baking soda; 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg.
Roll the dough right on the parchment paper that you'll use to bake the cookies. Position your cookie cutter so you leave 1" space between each cookie. Lift off the excess dough around the cut-outs and place the cookies on the parchment paper on the tray and directly in the oven. Cookies wont be bent or out of shape using this method. After cooking if the shapes touch just use the edge of your spatula or knife to push through the area and separate gently.

Fantastic recipe! Once again due to daughter’s celiac and my sensitivity to it, cut out flour altogether. I replaced 1/2 flour with almond flour and the other half with Bob’s Mill gluten-free all purpose flour. Wasn’t certain if the almond flour would ‘interfere’ with the ginger-ness of the cookie, so put 1/4 t more. They came out superbly. A tad of a crunch around the edge and nice and soft within.! Time to make another double  batch!

This was my 2nd Christmas using this recipe. It is a major success! My husband’s coworkers request these cookies year round. It smells really bad when first mix, but tastes amazing next day

Simple recipe for gingerbread cookies... not too sweet and a good balance of spices.  Be sure to roll dough out on a pastry mat with a little extra flour to keep it from sticking.  I use a gas oven and found 8 minutes left my 1/4-inch thick, gingerbread man not fully cooked throughout, whereas 10 minutes was just right.

Half way through the baking I would change the trays on the racks - bottom to top and turn the trays around to even out the baking. They only need 8 minutes in my oven. I overbaked the 1st batch by only a minute & what a difference. Can’t wait to decorate. I have small grandchildren so am using meringue powder instead of raw egg white for the royal icing. Will definitely make again next year.

Made it exactly as written. As much as I would love to give it a 1 star I can't because we will eat the gingerbread man. The dough is flaky and crumbly it doesn't hold together at all. It just falls apart. I made so much extra so I will definitely have to make changes. I 100% will NEVER make this recipe again. The taste is bland. It's ok but it really lacks flavour. Needs sugar or something. Something is missing in the cookies. I'm disappointed. But hey I tried and time to find a new recipe.
I doubt anybody giving 5 stars actually made this or followed the directions.

This was my first time making gingerbread men cookies; I don't usually bake. I checked out a few different recipes before finding this one, which had less ingredients than a few others I found. I found this recipe simple to do, and they turned out great. They tasted pretty amazing too. I managed to yeild 2 large, 8 medium,12 small gingerbread men ( I had a 3 size pk of gingerbread men cookie cutters) I baked them a little longer get than suggested, so the little ones came out crispier than I would have liked. the bigger ones were great tho. Going to make them again to decorate with my neices\nefew, think I will stick to the 8-10 minutes the recipes says. Overall great. Thanks for the recipe

Made a double recipe all at once, wont make that mistake again! Too hard to mix with our hand mixer and almost too much dough for our largest bowl. Cookies turned out great, but the dough almost needs to be room temperature before the cookies are easy to cut and transfer to the sheets for baking. Remember if your icing with premodern stuff to get the kind that will harden.

I didn’t finish my review as I hit “done” before I was. In addition to increasing the spice, I would make the final dough into 2 or 3 balls and put in the fridge overnight. By the time I got close to finished, the dough was super soft. I rolled mine out on parchment paper and used a little gingerbread cookie cutter and got 50 cookies. My first back with the one large ball as per the instructions, were thicker so I ended up with less. I think if I had rolled these out to 1/4”, I would have ended up with even more. Unless you want extra crispy cookies, 9 minutes was best for a crunchy bottom and soft rest.

Could be just me, but the dough was very difficult to work with even after refrigerating, so I rolled the cookies into balls instead. Good flavor and smelled wonderful out of the oven but spices were underwhelming. Will try doubling the spices next time.

This was my first time ever making Gingerbread. I didnt use McCormick spices, but that dosent matter.  They turned out great. My family doesnt usually like Gingerbread but they loved these. They had the perfect about of spiciness and while they were being made had one of the most beautiful, classic holiday smells. The recipe does say it makes only 24 servings, but i ended up with 52 five-inch cookies! (I'm not complaining)
For the frosting I made a buttercream. To make it I used:
-one stick of butter(room temp.)
-1 and 1/2 cups powdered sugar
-half tsp. vanilla extract
I than whipped them together on medium speed for 3 minutes.

Over all these cookies were amazing and I will definitely make them again.

Made these with my grandchildren.  They were very easy and came out perfect following the recipe.  Just don't eat them the same day, you'll be disappointed.  Let them sit for at least a day or more, they just get better!

Turned out perfectly! I used margarine instead of butter so I ended up having tp add an extra 1/3c flour so it was not sticky. Taste is delicious! This is now my go-to gingerbread cookie. Thank you

I followed the recipe and found it easy to make and just the right level of spiciness for little boys. Chillling the dough is a must. I would recommend just rolling out softball sized amounts of dough and keeping the rest in the frig. I left my dough out and the boys found it sticky toward the end. We used the Royal Icing recipe from Allrecipes to decorate them.

Delicious and easy to make! These cookies are a bit chewy, but still have a good slight crunch to them so they are not completely soft. They taste amazing on their own but even better with frosting. I mixed everything by hand and didn't find the dough hard to mix at all.

I followed the directions exactly. I do not usually like gingerbread because I don’t like ginger very strong in baked goods, but this was just perfect. For clarification I did use  sorghum molasses and not blackstrap molasses.  The little guys were darling and now I will make them with my grandchildren since it was so easy.  For the icing I used a cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons of milk. I beat it until it was smooth and then put it in a very small  little squeeze bottle that I bought 3 in a package  at the Container Store that is  food grade.

Taste great but a NIGHTMARE to roll. I followed the recipe and when I tried to roll it out like a dough it was impossible. I just made balls and flattened them out. Luckily, my kids were not disappointed that they were not getting gingerbread men. Find a different recipe! You've been warned.

Very good! I increased the spices by 50% and it was perfect. I also increased the salt to 1.5 tsp (baking tip, use unsalted butter and measure 1/2 tsp of salt per cup of flour). Store them in an airtight container with a slice of bread on a napkin and they will stay soft and delicious for days!

I roll out between wax paper so it did not put up the needed four that way. I baked for 11-15 mobs to yield a crisper cookie. The extra flour will reduce spread. I used Wilton royal icing and piped with a Wilton #3 tip. So cute in the ninja shapes that came as a kit ( I never used the mixes). Love the simplicity of just the while royal  icing. Dey overnight before packing away. Sooo cute but took a lot of time and effort. I think I’d rather make rolled butter cookie.

I followed the recipe except I used half the amount of ground ginger but added fresh graded ginger. I made two round disks to refrigerate and baked them in two batches, a few days apart.  Tastes great!

My dough was also quite sticky and extremely soft, the first batch I did with the stencils had to be refrozen because I couldn’t get them off the surface of my counter. Remedy: take out small batches of the dough at a time, use lots of flour on both sides and work quickly. I cooked for 9-10 minutes, and they turned out slightly soft and very tasty!
Not sure if the consistency had to do with me mixing it all by hand....ANYWAYSSSS in the end it made about 55 cookies!

The taste is good if you add an extra teaspoon of ginger and a 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. Rolling out and making the dough was AWFUL!!! After putting it on the fridge, the oil separates from the dough and it was very flacks and crumbly. I could barely work with it and everything fell apart. I then tried it again without putting it in the fridge, and it was just AS BAD!! It was super crumbly and flaky. All my stuff fell apart and I could pick it up. I used a spatula to do so, and that quickly became an art to master. Good luck with this recipe!

My first time making gingerbread cookies, and I’m not a great cook, but these turned out well. I received positive feedback from all who tried them, including a good baker, my husband, and a three-year-old. I left the dough in fridge overnight. It was difficult to manage until it warmed up a bit, then much better. Dough stuck to wooden rolling pin, but putting waxed paper or silicon sheet between pin and dough fixed that problem beautifully. I baked on a silicon baking surface. Cookies turned out nicely soft with a lovely firmness (like a nearly imperceptible crunch) at the surface.

I made this. I got about 3 dozen. I probably rolled thinner than recommended but I like crispy. I set these aside for the kids to decorate on Thanksgiving day. It keeps them occupied while the adults are cooking. Very good recipe.

Delicious recipe, although looking at the ingredients I could tell it wasn't going to taste as spicy as I like, so I did make a few of changes, such  as adding a teaspoon of allspice and increasing the amounts of the other spices (sorry, this was a month ago so I can't remember by quite how much).  It's also worth noting that, although they came out of the oven a little crunchy, they did soften up overnight, which was great for me because I like a softer gingerbread but might be something to steer clear of for you crunchers out there.

Made the dough as written but used fresh grated nutmeg instead of ground.  I rolled it thicker than I normally would for a cookie, knowing they would need to be more substantial if decorated. They were perfect and delicious. A male friend who took some undecorated cookies home later texted me, "OMG. These cookies!"

Ok, so these are really good cookies. But they are on the soft side, which i happen to love, so i wasn't bothered. But i needed to increase the spices. I actually cut the recipe down by a third, cause i only had 2 cups of flour on hand, whilst leaving the spices as called for. That made them perfect. Great recipe ????

for being the first making gingerbread cookies from scratch, this recipe was a hit. the only thing I did differently was add pumpkin pie spices to the recipe. they were delicious. I did have trouble rolling out the dough to cut  out little gingerbread men. so instead I just rolled the dough into balls and baked. they came out very good!

Very good gingerbread cookie recipe. Some reviewers have complained it's too bland, maybe they're confusing this with gingersnaps (?). I could pick up on the spices alright; I grated fresh spices and added a teaspoon of grated ginger in addition to the ground ginger, perhaps this made the difference. The flavor wasn't in your face like some vegan gingerbread I've had, but I rather enjoyed it for that reason. It's perfect for decorated cookies because it pairs well with royal icing. It has a smooth flavor and great texture to it. If you like it on the crispier side I suggest rolling it out thinner or leaving it in the oven for longer. I rolled mine out to a little more than a 1/4" and baked for 11 minutes and it came out soft and chewy - just how I like it. It did require a healthy dusting of flour to roll out but that's nothing new as far as gingerbread is concerned. My only complaint is that the cookies didn't hold their shape as well as I had hoped, some of my snowflakes became a bit rounded and lost some definition during baking, but other shapes came out fine.

This recipe gets a four star for the ease of preparation and for the taste, but I knocked off a star because even after 24 hours in the refrigerator the dough gets extremely soft and it can be messy to roll out. If you're planning on making gingerbread men or using this for a gingerbread house you will want to work with small portions.

This is the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have found. It is nice and soft in the middle. This is the one I will be using every year from now on. Isn't Christmas without a nice thick gingerbread cookie!  Cut mine extra thick and it was delicious.

Great recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand except molasses. Because I now live in a country where they don't sell molasses,, I had to substitute for dark maple syrop. I did the roll method (rolled into about 1.5 inch balls and rolled in sugar and then baked) and they came out so pretty and perfectly sized.

These are ok , but I don't understand the rave reviews. Dough was fine to roll out, but not right out of the fridge. The grandkids gobbbled them up, so I'm not going to complain  . I will try another recipe next time.

This is a fabulous gingerbread.  It isn't real strong like some I have tried. We liked that aspect because you can taste the spice not the heat.  I made it for a cookie decorating party and everyone asked for the recipe. One thing I did differently....I ran out of vanilla and used almond extract instead.  I liked the almond flavor along with the spice.  This is my new gingerbread go to.

Good.  They are mild in flavor since there's no cloves or orange peel.  I personally like a bit more spice but for kids and most of the people I know who don't like spicy these are a good cookie.

Yum. Juiced these up with heaping servings of the prescribed spices, plus added allspice, cloves and nutmeg. Also, used one cup of white  whole wheat flour in place of one cup of all purpose flour. Once you decorate with a touch of sweet frosting, these are delicious. Holiday happiness.

Be sure to roll them out on the thicker side so they are a little soft!  Did I already say yum?

Delicious! Made as is to the recipe, no changes. Wish it didn't leave fingers greasy, but that's probably why it's so tasty. Next time I'll replace some butter with yogurt and see how that goes.

Taste wise this was spot on.  But man, what a very hard dough to work with.  I followed the recipe exactly and did chill the dough overnight.  I ended up with cookies that spread terribly and it is hard to even tell what the original shape was on everything except the candy canes.  When rolling, I had to use a LOT more flour, way more than I normally have to with sugar cookies.  Personally I believe the recipe could use another half cup of flour to start with.  I may try again but use Imperial Margarine.  Guess Grandma was right when she said use butter for other things.

KID FRIENDLY BAKING. Basic, and delicious gingerbread recipe. Minimal ingredients and zero chopping make this a VERY kid friendly cookie project. I have used this recipe around the holidays for the past few years and it works out great each time. I also make the gingerbread icing, which is also very easy to follow and delish! Good alternative to sugar cookies.

Followed the recipe fairly faithfully except only put the dough in the freezer (not fridge) to chill for about 45 min. Also added heaping measurements of the spices, but much less than double. The result was a delicious cookie on the softer side. Was told they were the best gingerbread cookies they ever had. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to roll out the dough between sheets of parchment paper. Highly recommended. I did mix everything by hand. Would have been easier with an electric mixer but it wasn't the end of the world.

First time made this during Christmas time and it was a hit for kids. The dough looks so dry crumbly when I took it out. I remember some of the review mentioned it so I just continue, so glad I did. The cookie is soft with lots of flavor. First tray was gone in less than three minutes. Second tray was even faster. Will do it again this year! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my go to for gingerbread. I have made cutouts with royal icing,  topped with chocolate "hugs", and just rolled in sugar and baked. I do recommend extra spices (1.5-2xs) as the molasses flavor is strong.  Keep dough chilled between batches and flour your surface copiously before working with it.  I never let the dough sit overnight, just an hour or two in the fridge. It is a very sticky dough, but yummy and worth the effort! I bake mine the minimum time to keep them soft and chewy. Also, the flavors come out more if you let the baked cookies "age" for 24 hours before eating.

I made the Whoopie pie variation (below recipe).... and it is amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, rolled the gingerbread dough in sugar and baked for exactly 8-9 minutes. They are perfectly soft on the inside.  The lemon frosting for the inside needed a wee bit more lemon extract (I used 3tsp instead of 2).  Super amazing. I posted a picture of them.

Not sure if I did something wrong but my dough was very sticky.  I refrigerated it overnight. I ended up adding a lot of extra flour to keep it from sticking to the countertop and rolling pin.  The texture was great and the flavor was what I expected.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

I made this after reading all reviews and thought it would be a wonderful addition to my collection. Boy, was I wrong.  I can not for the life of me figure out why so many like this recipe.  I had all the ingredients but if I had spent money to purchase specifically for these cookies, I would be pretty outraged.

These were fantastic!  I used 1.5 times the spices - some other reviews said it needed more, but didn't know if doubling was necessary.  Except for increasing the spices I followed the recipe exactly.  I mixed up some easy icing to decorate - 1 tsp. vanilla, powdered sugar and enough water to make a thick paste.

This recipe was really great.  I followed the directions for making the dough and decided to throw it in the freezer for a couple of hours.  Pulled it out and let it sit for about 5 minutes before I started to roll it out.  I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper and didn't have any problem with them sticking.  I only baked them 8 minutes and then let them sit on the cookie sheet on the rack for another 5 minutes after I removed them from the oven.  The cookies turned out moist on the inside with a delicate crunch on the outside.  The flavor was perfect.  For those reviewers that don't like the rich flavor...make sure you like the taste of ginger before making these.  Really yummy recipe!

This dough is so good I cant stop eating it, havent baked yet but I'm sure it will be good. I added 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 teasp. clove, 1/4 teasp. black pepper and increased the ginger to about 1 tblsp. using this dough for gingerbread houses, I hope its sturdy enough!

This cookie is very bland when it first comes out of the oven ... hopefully it gets better overnight.  Easy to make though and with some royal icing to sweeten it probably will be better.  Might also add a touch more of the spices in the mix, maybe it won't be so bland.

These were very easy and fun to make. I put the dough in the FREEZER for just under an hour and it worked perfectly! The ginger is a tiny bit too strong for my taste, so next time I will be taking out 1/4-1/2 a teaspoon. My family LOVED these!

These cookies are just the bomb! They taste perfectly! The only thing that I would change is you should only cook them for 8 to 9 minutes instead of the full 10. I also suggest adding a tad more vanilla extract then what it calls for. It makes it taste so much better!

These are indeed soft cookies - a bit fluffy in my opinion. This recipe makes a great dough for rolling-out and cutting cookies. They looked fantastic, I just wish they were a little more chewy. I'm sure there are adjustments I could make to this recipe but I'd rather find another. I read somewhere else that someone's guests ate them all but didn't comment on the taste. I feel the same about these - nothing fantastic but I am happy to have tried this as my first gingerbread cookie. P.S. I refrigerated my dough overnight and then rolled it out. Put them back in the fridge while the oven preheated. I was more concerned with how they looked the second time around.

Great balance of flavors.  I'd might add a little bit more ginger, but I'm a ginger addict.  The only instruction that threw me was "Bake...until edges of cookies...just begin to brown."  If you're used to baking cookies, you know what to look for.  Just don't burn 'em.

Made good, soft, chewy gingerbread cookies. The dough was extremely heavy and put my electric mixer to work, but I didn't have a problem working with it after refrigerating the dough overnight. Had to generously flour the rolling pin and the surface, however. I baked them exactly 8 minutes, and the cookies turned out perfectly! My icing job, however, could use a little work =P

Very disappointing. I went by past reviews and this cookie has no flavor at all!  All spices need to be increased.  The cookie is soft like we wanted it to be but bland.

Not as good as I was hoping. I love molasses & that came through fine but not gingery enough & not very sweet either. I'd add more ginger & br sugar next time. Kindof bland overall.

I just made these cookies and they taste wonderful!! I made them thicker than what the recipe said but otherwise I did exactly as it said. I used powder sugar icing to decorate, and I baked them for 8 minutes.

Baked according to recipe and they turned out great!  Baked for 9 minutes and they were still soft for me.  They taste great!  I might bake for a bit longer next time (and there will be a next time) to have a little bit crispier cookie.

It came out okay, but it was a little too sugary for us. Next time, less sugar and a lot more ginger powder.

Best gingerbread men recipe because the dough was super easy to roll and the cutouts lifted without changing their shape.  However, keeping your dough cold and only rolling half at a time with the other half in the refrig really helps the whole process.  I found that 10-11 minutes cooking time was good for my oven.

Excellent recipe!  This was my first attempt at gingerbread and I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was - only left the dough in fridge for 2 hours - seemed more than enough.  My girls could not wait until they came out of the oven as the whole kitchen smelled so good - they were eating them before we even had a chance to decorate!

I have been searching for a good gingerbread recipe, and i found it! This is it! I've always wanted to make perfect gingerbread cookies like the ones i use to eat when i was younger. I loved these and so Did my young niece, the kids ate them up. They even impressed my sister and she's impossible to impress. I used cinnamon imperials and royal icing to decorate.

While not a fan of gingerbread myself, everyone who tried one of these LOVED them! I baked a basket for my boyfriend's family, and even his younger brother made a point to mention how good they were. I'll definitely be making these again next Christmas.

My children and I made these cookies before Christmas and we all loved them.  They are soft and not too spicy.  We took some to two different parties and they were well liked.  I have never been a big fan of gingerbread cookies, but now I have to say I really enjoyed eating these!

This recipe is perfect, and it will be the only recipe I use for gingerbread men from now on. I wouldn't make any changes. My husband loved these cookies, as did all of our holiday guests. I cooked mine for 8-9 minutes and they were the perfect balance of soft/firm.

These were pretty good if you are looking for a soft cookie.  However,  seems like the spices could have been increased a little more.  I like a little more bite to my gingerbread.

I made these and they were the best ever. I did change the spices, I used 2 different kinds of pumpkin pie spice 1 tsp each, and 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I loved theses and so did everyone else, even had "demands" for the recipe. They were great!!!

yummy.  soft and flavorful.  didn't change a thing with the recipe.  found that my cookies came out smoother in appearance when the dough wasn't quite so chilled and had been "worked with" a couple of times (ie. the scraps made into a new disc and rolled.)

Honestly I didn't like this version as much as my Better Homes and Gardens version.  Yes, I did make the cookies, they came out OK, but nothing spectacular.  And I felt that the dough from the other recipe was even easier to work with.  Like I said, the cookies did come out, but I won't use this recipe again.

I never made gingerbread men before, and I was a little nervous, but they turned out great! These cookies were easy and fun to make and I found the dough very managable when rolling out. I will definately make these agian. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Terrific recipe!!! Kind of sticky, but with a mixture of flour and a little powdered sugar it does the trick.  Perfect bake time for these cookies! They came out lightly browned on the edges and nice and soft.  LOVED this recipe! Thanks!!!

Amazing!   I followed the recipe exactly, and turned out great.  make sure you double the recipe, if you're planning on bringing them to parties, sales, etc.  Other than that, no complaints!

Actually got this recipe from a Meijer shopping add last Christmas season. My teenage boys loved them last year, made them again two days ago. All the cookies have been eaten. My husband also really liked this recipe. I had cookie cutters to make men, women and gingerbread babies, They were so cute.

Very good, pretty easy to make. I do wish they were alittle more spicy. I will add a pinch more of each spice next time.
