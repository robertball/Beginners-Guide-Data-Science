I couldn't believe how beautiful this cake turned out. I used my large pressure cooker, without the pressure cooker attachment thingy, because it was large enough to hold my bundt pan. I also didn't have any cocoa powder, so I used 3 bars of Hershey's Unsweetened Chocolate Bars(It was all I had left)so the cinnamon is very predominate and delicious. I then made a sauce using Bailey's Cappacino Liquor and whipped cream. Amazing. Thank you for such a wonderful dream cake...

This is probably the best cake I've ever made. It has fabulous texture, very soft and fudgy. It is excellent plain but would be great with ice-cream as well. 

Instead of using a rack I did it in a square Bundt pan that was inserted into a round pot so that the edges overlapped and it was held up by the rim of the pot. I filled the bottom two inches of the pot with water and covered the top with the pot lid (with the pan inside). Seemed to work great but took much longer than anticipated, about two hours because some of the steam was escaping. 

Thanks for a great cake!

in great britain, this is commonly called a pudding and it has been an essential part of the british pastry heritage for centuries.  figgy pudding, of christmas carol fame, is just one example of the many vaieties. nice to see this nod to the amerrican passion for chocolate.

What an awesome cake! Thank you for sharing the recipe! It was super moist and deliscious- I didn't have walnuts, so I left them out and this was still fabulous- even my food snob of a husband loved it! He took the cake and shared it with his friends- it got rave reviews all around!

Maybe I'm the only person who made it wrongly. Bcos I did not get a moist, soft cake. It got a bit hard and when I put it in the fridge, it's getting harder in the next day. I'm familiar with steamed cake bcos in my country we have steamed brownies, which absolutely my favourite. Maybe I have to try again later and hopefully I can change to 5 stars.

I made this cake yesterday and followed the directions exactly. It is a delicious, moist cake and was easy to prepare, even though I had never steam-baked a cake before in my life. The chocolate cinnamon flavor is so nice. I served it with a warm vanilla sauce and my family loved it. I'll keep this recipe for sure.

I really really liked this cake. It took about 2 hours to cook, but was well worth the wait. I don't have a bunt pan so I just used my 10qt pot, placed it on a rack and put in a larger pot. I didn't use aluminum foil to cover it I just used my pot lid. The cake is even great leftover the next day. My father thinks the texture is more like a brownie than cake. But my whole family of seven loved it.
