Such an easy recipe and we love lemon curd in or on anything - that is the British in me.   
Do have a few changes that I feel are an improvement and that is to not use lemon extract - the lemon rind is enough and does not taste artificial.  Also, if you have the time, please make your own lemon curd.........much better than the jarred stuff.   Thanks for a great dessert otherwise.

We really enjoyed this recipe -- my daughter and I made this together.  We used a springform pan, and it worked just fine, although we had to cook longer than 35min.  We also made our own homemade lemon curd.  It was time-consuming, but really worth a Sunday afternoon together.  Thanks so much!

Very good, but hubs wasn't so sure about the lemon flavor of this.  I liked it, but even I, a lemon obsessed person, thought it was too much.  Maybe just the cheesecake without the lemon curd on top, or a plain cheesecake with lemon curd on top would be best for us.  I didn't have whipped topping and so yesterday we tried it w/o the whipped topping; after we bought some, we tried it today with the whipped topping.  It's definitely better with the whipped topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

It turned out well but if you use a larger bunt pan (mine is about 12", I think) you will want to double or even triple the cheesecake part of the recipe.  I made my own crust with gluten-free ginger snaps from Trader Joe's.  ( our youngest has a problem with wheat, especially heavily processed wheat)  It was very good, but needed more cheesecake as the crust was as thick as the cheese cake.  I made this for my daughter's birthday and she loved it, though she wanted more cheese cake.
