It should read:  "Cook 1 cup of wild rice in 1 1/2 cup of water AND 1 1/2 cup of broth, for a total of 3 cups of liquid".  Other places online say that 1 cup of wild rice should be cooked in 3 cups of water, so that's how we tried it and it was great!  BTW, we're vegetarian and left out the bacon all together and it was really great wrapped in Tofurky turkey lunch meats and baked.

I love this stuffing!  This is the second time I've made this and it turned out awesome.  Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in, because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on.  For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary, 2 Tbsp. basil, 1 Tbsp. oregano, 1 Tbsp. thyme, 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage.  I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes.  To cut costs, I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries).  It still turned out fabulous!

Awesome recipe!  I served this with 'Roast Chicken with Rosemary' from this site and it was wonderful.  Would be great for a pot luck.

I purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions.  I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside.  I sauteed the onion and celery, and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'.  Added the celery and onion, the dry herb mix (basil, organo, thyme, sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through.  Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm.
This is an incredible dish.  DH and I plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substituting the bacon for chicken sauage, and the fruits and herbs.

The instructions for the recipe are not written correctly, omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list. The uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed. I think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients. The flavor was good, the texture was crunchy. No one would eat it at Thanksgiving.

I am in the process of making this seemingly wonderful stuffing for Turkey day tomorrow, and it says nowhere in the recipe what to do with the 1.5 cups of the chicken broth! Yikes! I guess I will wing it, and let you all know later with a rating as to how it turned out.

Liked this a bunch. Went great with a roast pork tenderloin. I just made my wild rice separately as well as the white rice. With the wild rice, I used chicken broth plus some water. Added some golden raisins as well. This was very tasty served cold as well.

Before I prepared it I told my husband what was in it and If he wanted me to cook it for him to try. He said no, well I fixed it anyway because I liked most all the ingredients and he ate more than anyone else.  Said it was delicious and fix it again.

This is so delicious!  Goes great with chicken and pork.  The flavor is amazing, and it's not difficult to make, which is always a plus in my book.  I can't wait to make this dish again.

This is awesome.  I just put it together to take to a friend's house to go with Christmas Ham.  I couldn't add anything to make it better, except maybe the pecans like another reviewer did.  If you can get the cherries, use them, because that is my favorite part.

WOW!  So good.  I feel bad rating this because I didn't have quite all the ingredients, but it was just so yummy that I have to say something!  I only used dried cranberries and then doubled the apples, and it was absolutely incredible.  I also ended up picking some of the parsley out after I'd added it because it seemed like too distinct of a flavour.  Maybe I just needed to cut it a little more finely. I also threw in some chopped pecans to one serving of it, and that was a great addition too!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  The flavours blended together wonderfully. I omitted the cherries and increased the apricots, and used pancetta instead of bacon but it worked well.  I also used fresh herbs - thyme, oregano, sage and parsley - the aroma was incredible! Also loved that this was gluten and dairy free! I will definitely make this dish again!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to decrease the dried fruit and omit the mixed herbs.  I liked the flavor of this dish, but it had no eye appeal at all.  I used Zatarain's Wild Rice Mix and used only the amount of liquid (water and chicken broth) the back of the box called for.  When I added the Uncle Ben's white rice and continued to cook it, it got all sticky and mushy. In hind sight, I think I could have cooked the wild and white rices together at the same time since both needed to cook for 20-25 minutes (rather than the 45 minutes stated in the recipe for the wild rice).  While I did enjoy the flavors of this dish, my husband didn't, so I probably won't make it again.

I found this a little too heavy on the dried fruit and herbs, plus it needed a little something to bind it together better. Next time I will make only with apples alone or with cranberries alone and maybe just two tablespoons of dried herbs. Also need to figure out something to hold it together, maybe some cream or soy milk mixed in. Nevertheless, I thought the overall product was worth four stars, particularly because this is a wonderful Thanksgiving table alternative for those allergic to wheat. The bacon is really necessary to balance the sweet with the savory and in my opinion should definitely not be omitted!

This was the stuffing I used for my very first TG Turking Baking experience, and boy did I LOVE this!!! I didn't have any wild rice, so I used basmati (I live in tokyo, and wild rice is very uncommon). I also adore cranberries, so the craisins were delightful. I had some stuffing left over too, and it was good as is, but was even bettr when combined with the turkey.  Highly recommended!!!

Used vegetable broth to make it healthier and no bacon.  Add butternut squash to increase recipe and add extra nutrition.  Was great for gluten free friends.

Delicious. Made it with vegetarian "bacon" to suit both vegetarians and those who can't tolerate glutens. It was a big hit with the carnivorous gluten eaters too!

Wow, this is delicious. We eat gluten free, dairy free and sugar free and I searched so many places to find a good stuffing recipe. This was a huge hit! I read the reviews and cooked both rice and then while they were still moist added the other ingredients. I used the herbs like Diane suggested. I will definitely make this again and will become my yearly holiday go to.

I did not use that much celery or onions.  It was very good and was a change to the usual stuffing made with bread.

No one in my family ate more than a couple of spoonfuls. Just did not care for the taste - it was too intense and way too much fruit for a stuffing. I did substitute sausage for bacon as it is not available where I live so perhaps that is the key ingredient. I still can't see enjoying so many crunchy items with so little rice in a stuffing.

This recipie is so delicious! I altered it a little bit.  I didn't add the apples.  I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup to add some more moisture to the rice and serve it as a main dish.  My family loves it!

Very tasty, everyone loved (or at least liked, you can’t get everyone to love something) it. This is our new family stuffing recipe.

Can you please explain the mixed herbs blend into measurements? Most common blends consist of marjoram, thyme, sage etc. Or are you using herb de provance mix?  Also where does one buy currants?
I have only found currant jellies not fresh berry currants. Directions are a little confusing. Wanting to make this so badly, please help!

I started making this 3 years ago when I had to go g/f and served it at my Thanksgiving. It’s been requested by my extended family ever since as more of us are g/f now. I make a vegan variation so my sister can eat it too. The dried cherries are the must-include as they work so well with the cranberries. I’ve “cheated” and done the whole thing up in a crockpot too, and I’ve switched out the rice for our short-grain Japanese rice which works as I’m careful with not having it go mushy. It’s just delicious!

SUPER amazing outstanding.  directions and comments about directions were a bit confusing.  I used the "helpful review" w the seasoning recommendation.  I cooked the wild rice in 3 cups of liquid (1 1/2 c Water 1 1/2 c broth)   I wasn't sure if the white rice was to be added to the wild at the 45 min mark or the final 20 min of it's 45 (geeez) so I made the white rice totally separately and added the fruit to the WILD rices last 20 min.  combined all 3 pans/pots together for the final product.  I am a total novice cook and my first pre-thanksgiving.  I exploded

A big hit at Thanksgiving! I chose this recipe because I had no room in the oven to bake another dish and because I did not have a whole turkey to stuff. My husband does not like celery so made it without and did not miss it. I also used only a third of the dried mixed herbs and did not miss them either. I cooked the the bacon and onion ahead of time so there was one less thing to do at the last minute. This recipe will be a Thanksgiving staple in our home for years to come. Thanks!

Excellent; definitely outside the box. I used the seasonings for my family's traditional rice stuffing recipe: allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon which blend well with the dried fruits.  There seems to be confusion about the liquid. Read Step 1 carefully: it says to use part of the water AND the chicken broth.

This recipe has immediately become a family favorite and has been used for the past three years at Thanksgiving and Solstice. In fact, I had to find the recipe again to e-mail to a friend.
