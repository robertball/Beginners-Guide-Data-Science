This is a very simple an amazing recipe especially if you make a little extra aioli and brush it on as soon as you take them off the grill. A+ - especially the smoked paprika, which gives a nice little smokey flavor.

this is really good.. cured or preserved lemons are easy to make, just have to do it ahead of time.  look up the recipe - it's easy to find.

Fantastic! Love the lemon aioli, except I cheat and just add two tablespoons of Key West lime juice instead of the cured lemons. I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic out of a prepared jar, making sure to get some of the oil in there as well. It's now a staple when my daughter and her husband come over.

The sauce is interesting and good, although I feel it's lacking some flavor depth (says the girl who never really cooks -- take that with a grain of salt).  The shrimp were simple and delicious -- they were gone within 5 minutes at a bbq filled with all kinds of beef, chicken, etc. grilled on the barbi. If you like shrimp, you'll love this.  Eat it!

I made this recipe to go with crab cakes, which I make every New Year's Eve.  I wasn't thrilled with the aioli recipe I had, which just had too much raw garlic for my taste (and I like garlic). The simple, fresh, clean taste of this sauce was perfect.  My only issue was I did not read the recipe fully, as I was in a rush, and did not have preserved lemons.  I substituted lemon zest and it worked.  Next time I will be better prepared and it will be even better.  Chef John, I've tried a number of your recipes and every one has been great!  Thank you.

I  made the aioli for crab cakes and salmon patties.   I'm not a fan of tarragon so I substituted lemon thyme in one batch and lemon basil in the second batch both from my herb garden..  Loved both.  I love most anything with preserved lemon.

I love this recipe.  The fairly few ingredients make it a wonderful dish to prepare on the fly, with what's in the pantry.  I didn't have fresh tarragon so substituted a slightly smaller measure of dry.  It was still very delicious.

An aioli sauce MUST  have garlic in it, by definition - aioli means "oil and garlic." Also, how much is "2 strips" of preserved lemon? My strips are about 1/6 of the lemon rind. I sliced
2 strips, about 3/4" wide each, because one really wasn't enough. I used fresh lemon juice. Not having fresh tarragon, I used powdered - I think 1/2 powdered spice for the fresh amount is the typical proportion? Still didn't have much "oomph" to it so I added about 3/4 of a tablespoon of creamy, prepared horseradish sauce. Oh, and lots of minced garlic. It turned out to be a nice sauce.

I thought the strong lemon flavor kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the shrimp.
