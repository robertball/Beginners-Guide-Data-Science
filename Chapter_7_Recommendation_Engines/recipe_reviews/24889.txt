This recipe was very good. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I sauteed the onion and peppers first. Also I think this recipe would be just as good if you used canned tomatoes. I used 1 can of Ro-Tel w/chiles that added a kick to the recipe and 2 tomatoes. Also I added whole med black olives w/ vege mixture. Lastly I used a verde cream of chicken soup it has chiles in it. I liked the extra kick but hubby thought it was too much. Other than that I will make this again. One last suggestion if you have leftovers add fresh chips to casserole after reheating and mix in. It makes a diffence.

This recipe is great! If you don't like it as hot use a mild sauce. I also recommend sauteeing the veggies first so they aren't as crunchy. I make this recipe every other week! My family LOVES it!!!

My family enjoyed this recipe the only thing I would adjust when I make it again would be less onion (maybe half an onion instead a whole onion). That was my kids' only suggestion. Overall a tasty and easy dinner choice! The leftovers were really good too!

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and just used one can of cream of chicken soup mixed with about 2/3 of a can of hot enchilada sauce. I also threw in a finely chopped jalapeno with the bell peppers Husband absolutely loved it although he did say he would have some chips on top too. Leftovers are NOT good btw - the bottom chip layer gets very soggy and not at all nice. Thanks so much Patty!

After reading the reviews I precooked the peppers onions & tomatoes (adding a sprinkle of chili powder & cumin). Since my enchilada sauce was 15 oz. I left out the water but did mix in a can of rotel. I served it topped with sour cream hot sauce and salsa. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This stuff sounds like it wouldnt be good and while you are preparing it it doesnt look good either. When you put it in the oven and it starts to bake you can tell how it is. It tastes very good.

Yummy! I substituted Light (or Wow) Doritos and reduced fat cheddar cheese. Instead of 3 tomatoes used 2 plus one can of Rotel tomatoes as other reviews suggested. Would layer the cheese throughout the casserole next time though. Very delicious and will definitely do again!

My husband and I love this recipe. I've fixed it once a week now since I found it. Try with Spanish style rice and refried beans on the side. Best the first day so have company to share with.

I really liked this. My husband said it was "just OK". If I make it again I will saute the peppers and onion first because they were still raw after baking 25 minutes. I may try this with ground beef also.

Absolutely wonderful! Did saut√© veggies too and I have added black beans in the past. I also think it's less mushy if you leave out the tomatoes...do not add canned tomatoes then you have a mess trust me.

I thought this was all right my husband said it was just ok and my daughter didn't like it. It isn't anything special and I probably won't make it again.

I tested this recipe out on "unexpected" guests -- one of them ate four helpings! I used mile instead of hot sauce because of my mother in law. I'm sure it would be wonderful with "hot" I loved it that the onions and peppers were still crispy and the chips were crispy as well -- a terrific recipe and it serves eight or nine....even when they overindulge!

There seemed to be something that was missing in it. It may have been the fact that I used green and red peppers instead of yellow but it was ok. I was thinking maybe adding jalepenos to it or olives but didn't. I will keep experimenting with it becasue it is a really simple recipe.

Very flavorful. Next time I will cook the peppers and onion to get them tender. Were a little too crunchy just baking them and I would also use cheese throughout the receipe and not just on top - we love cheese.

I made this last night for the first time. It's quick and easy and my kids loved it. It is easier sauteing the peppers and onions before hand. Plus I took some extra chips and sprinkled them on top with extra cheese.And I squeezed in a lime with the veggie mix.

There's no way this is 4 servings! This is at least 12 servings! I had to scoop everything out into a 10x15 dish (not 9x13) and add the rest of the sauce and cheese. Otherwise the ingredients are good.

The vegetable ratio to the chicken was far too much. I did not enjoy this one at all and neither did my guests. Sorry.

This was good. Not spicy enough to be named Hot Lips Chicken though. Actually not really spicy at all. Also I don't get the point of the chip crust. They are soggy coming out of the oven. They would be much better served as a scooping agent or even crushed on top after the casserole comes out of the oven.
