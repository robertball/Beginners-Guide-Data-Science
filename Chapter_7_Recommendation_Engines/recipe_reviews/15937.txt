Very good pie crust recipe, and it definitely deserves 5 stars for simplicity.  It is a fantastic basic, all-purpose crust that is easy to modify to whatever recipe you need, and simple to double, triple, or augment to fit your particular dish. I have used it for savory pies, dessert pies, and cobblers with little problem.

My only change is to use milk instead of water, and one can substitute butter or butter-flavored shortening with no problem.  Remember though, if you substitute butter cut the water quantity by about 20% (so from 1/2 cup to 6 tbsp.) because butter contains water and shortening does not.

Happy baking!

mmmm mm!!! ive had horrible experiences with baking pies but this is so easy! at first i thought the dough would turn into a disaster (it was a little mushier than i had expected) so if you encounter the same problem, add half a cup of flour. also, DONT FORGET TO CHILL ALL THE INGREDIENTS for at least 20 minutes! it helps alot. to make the pie a nice golden color, smear on a little bit of milk (half a teaspoon) on the uncooked top crust for a nice touch. If you plan on making a double crust pie, dont forget to double the recipe like i almost did. a wonderful filling for this pie crust is Apple pie by grandma ople. this was the first time i ever made something big from scratch, and it was EASY AND DELICIOUS! also, dont forget to cut slits in the pie so it dosnt pop or overflow. hope i helped!

The Best! Very easy & delicious. Don't know why the note against novices using it! Easy enough for a novice. I chilled the dough for 15 minutes before rolling out. Will definately use this recipe again.

I have finally found THE pie crust I've been searching for!  It's as delicious as it is easy.  It came out PERFECT and my whole family raved about it.  I used it with "Terry's Favorite Chicken Pie" (this site) and we couldn't get enough.  The only problem was I doubled the recipe to make two pies but only came out with enough for 1 1/2. Will start with 3 cups of flour next time.  I used butter flavor Crisco and also added a pinch or two of salt.  I wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to cool while I assembled my pie ingredients.  The dough is more moist than most pie crust doughs so you will need to roll it out on a good dusting of flour.  Thanks Deirdre Dee!! This is the only pie crust recipe I will EVER use!

This is the BEST pie crust.  This pie crust formula will work out every time. This version only makes one crust, but to make more just multipy the ingredients by the number of crusts you would like. Remember ***You must always refrigerate pie dough before rolling*** Also if you are going to bake this as an empty shell, remember to use some alumisum foil or parchment and line it on top of the crust and fill it with beans, so that it will keep the crust in place while it bakes.

i doubled this recipe & easily got 2 - 9" single crust pies. the dough is extremely soft but not hard to work with if you keep everything lightly floured (including your fingers). use ice water & chill the dough for at least 20 minutes before rolling out. thanks deirdre!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  I have been trying for years (more than I like to remember) to make a pie crust.  Everyone in my family of two sisters can make one but not me. Thank you, thank you, Deirdre! It was easy to make, easy to roll, to place in the pie plate. It was the most beautiful pie crust of all my family has made. I am so excited now I can make a pie!!!!!!!! Great recipe thank you again

Thought this was one of the best and easiest recipes for pie crust that I have tried.  My son made it for his first forray into pastry making and loved it.  And my husband thinks it is even better than his sister-in-laws.

This crust is pretty to look at but comes out greasy, as it calls for twice the shortening of most recipes I've used.  The dough was also hard to work with and falls apart easily.  You're better off with the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe.

This is the best tasting, the easiest to make and the easiest to roll. I have tried many many other pie crust recipes and none of them even come close to being so simple and so easy.

Makes a great pie crust.  Definitely need to refrigerate before rolling out.  I find its nice to make up a bunch, roll them out and then roll up on a piece of plastic wrap, place in a zip-lock bag and freeze until needed.  Saves lots of time when needing a pie crust.  Just pull out 30 minutes before you need it so it can defrost.

I've used a similar recipe for years.  However, I also add a dash of salt and I always use butter flavored shortening.  It really needs those additions for maximum flavor.  Also, the colder the water, the flakier the crust.  I also store it in the fridge for 10 or 15 minutes before rolling it out.  This recipe never fails and makes excellent crust.  Another note:  this recipe will make a bottom crust only.  Double it if you want a top crust.

I have a very similar recipe... Instead of shortening, take butter. Less calories, still tastes great! Works really well. Good idea, tho! Love the pic, DD! SK

Besides being a pain to make, this crust tastes like nothing but shortning! I won't be using this again.

Nice flaky crust BUT my advice is to double the recipe. I messed up my first batch it was too gooey and after refrigerating it still did not help, so I made another one and could tell instantly the consistency was much better BUT when I went to roll it out there was not enough pie crust for one of my SMALL pie plates, at this point I was not about to make another one so I had a funny looking pecan pie! It tastes good just strange looking. Very good pie crust recipe just be sure to make extra!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love this crust!  I have done it a few times and have done two things - 1) lessened the water by just a bit and 2) chilled the shortening in the refrigerator for an hour before hand.

I'm not sure I understand why a novice shouldn't make this... because I thought it was very straight forward and easy.  The only thing I didn't see, was directions on cooking~ which I had to guess at temperature and time.  I used butter flavored Crisco and it turned out wonderful, maybe just a tad greasy... but really good!

I really think that this needs some salt (1/2 teaspoon is perfect!), but it is simple, and very flaky. I made a double batch for a chicken pot pie, and was thrilled with the texture while rolling.

Sorry, these just did not come out right and this is the first time pie crust ever failed on me (and I've made plenty)!  It was easy to roll out, but when I tried to prebake the piecrust, it totally collasped on me (ruffle edges I made) while baking! It was unsavagable, so I had to trash it.  I'm only giving it a 2 because I didn't taste it (benefit of doubt).

I used butter instead of shortening and It came our perfectly: flaky, buttery and delicious. Worked great on a blueberry/nectarine pie. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is the perfect recipe for a beginner. I only made a pie crust because I was too lazy to go the store. Boy was this good. I used coconut oil that I put in the freeezer for a bit. Made it very solid. And replace a tablespoon of water with balsamic. So good. If I make a strawberry pie will do the same thing again, just add a bit of sugar. I also made it in food processor. I cut in the oil, and let it form the dough. This is a perfect recipe. (PS I have only made on pie crust before almost ten years ago.)

I definitely don't agree with the part of the description that says it's not for novices! This was the easiest pie crust ever! I've never made a pie in my life from scratch, but I decided to try my hand at it for Christmas. I used this recipe for my apple pie, and it turned out beautifully!

I reviewed this before, but I need to again!  I made this crust again last night...and it is amazing!  I made a lattice top crust for the first time, and it was surprisingly easy!  This crust was very easy to work with.  I added a little bit of salt, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I had some leftover dough, and rolled balls of it in cinnamon and sugar...and they're delicious!  So flaky and light!  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Let me just say that I'm about as novice a baker as you can get.  I have never made pie crust before I found this recipe and had I known how great this would turn out, I would have made it long ago!  It was incredibly easy and turned out simply amazing!!  Thank you Deirdre!  This is the only pie crust recipe I will ever use!!

I am a novice. It was easy. I have been baking pies for 4 years, using store bought pie crusts. I entered a pie contest at church, so I had to bake my own crust this time.  It was easy!  I woke up at 3:30 a.m. and followed directions. I used cold shortening and I used iced to get the water cold. I rolled it into a ball and wrapped it in plastic wrap before putting in the freezer for 30 minutes.  I'm not sure if the freezer was a good idea or not, but the crust came out perfect!  I surprised myself. It was very flaky and reminded me of my great grandmother's crust. I don't have a mixer and neither did my great grandma, I used my left hand to mix ingrediants.

I find that I like to add about a tsp of salt and a tsp of sugar for a little added flavor, but otherwise what an easy recipe.

Yes, this is the recipe I used for years - when I used to cook!  Haven't made a pie crust for a long time, I now use the refrigerated Pillsbury, but I used this formula for many years because it is easy to remember and pretty foolproof.  I do add just a pinch or two of salt.  And if it seems too wet, I just add a little more flour, and plenty of flour to roll it out.  I don't even refrigerate first before rolling out.  I once made 8 pies for Christmas using this exact recipe.  Everybody always complimented me on my piecrust and this is the recipe I used.

Super easy!!  Needs a pinch of salt. I live in Miami where it is always humid.  I only needed to use 1/2 of the water.  Perfect texture.  Definitely will be my crust recipe from now on.

Easy, tasty, and makes an amazing shell for chicken pot pie.  I substituted butter for the shortening, though.  Definitely a keeper!

My high school science teacher taught me to bake pie. Just add salt and this is the recipe he used. If you are seeking the ultimate flakey crust you must use lard! Gross, I know, but as long as you are not serving vegetarians, just don't tell anyone. Allow time for the dough to chill and rolling will be easier.

I have never made a pie crust before.  The first batch came out terribly, but I think it was the flour I used.  It was an organic pastry flour.  I tried again and the next batch (made with AP flour) came out fine.  I used a little more than 1/4 cup water.  I then made one more batch for the top crust and it came out just fine.  I baked the remaining scraps; they were flaky but bland, not at all greasy as someone said.  As part of my blueberry pie, the crust was okay, but bland.  The recipe was easy and worked.  I only give it 4 stars because it lacked flavor...  the rest of the pie had plenty of that to go around, though.

I never knew how easy pie crust is to make! I am never going to buy one again. I am not a crust person when I eat pies but, this one is light and flakey very good. This is my second time using this recipe and both times came out great. I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and mixed it with the flour and used my fave apple pie recipe from this site sooo good.

An easy crust to make.  Very flaky and tasty but, after sitting on a napkin, the crust left quite a bit of grease behind.  As another reviewer suggested, I added 1/3-1/2 Cup flour to reduce moisture/stickiness.  Also, I would add a bit of salt next time.

I thought this was a terrific recipe.  I didn't use quite 1/4 cup of water, I just put it in a tablespoon at a time until it was the consistancy I thought it should be.  This was the first time I've ever attempted to make a pie crust, or even a pie and I found it very simple and it turned out perfect.  It was very nice and flaky!  I agree with the others, even a Novice can make this crust with no trouble.  Just be sure and use plenty of flour as you roll it out, it is just a little sticky, but tastes wonderful!

I used this for a pot pie.  I thought it was very easy to make. i let it rest for a good 30 minutes before working with it.  It was rather sticky and i had to make sure there was enough flour on the cutting board to keep it from sticking.  It had a nice light taste to it.  I plan on trying this crust for a thanksgiving pie i'm making.

Only recipe I use now! It's flaky, easy to remember (don't even need the recipe), quick, and easy to make! It's also the recipe I've had the best luck with. TIP: stir and handle the dough as little as possible. After cutting in the shortening, I just form it into a thick patty and use the rolling pin to spread it out into a circle.

Easy to work with. Easy to remember and good flavor. I added approximately a tsp of salt. It did not get very brown. Next time I may brush with milk and sprinkle a little sugar on top (Grandma's trick)

This crust was OK, but the dough was very sticky.  I did not use all of the water (maybe half of what was recommended) and still had to add quite a bit more flour while I was trying to roll out and form the pie crust.  But for a quick and easy pie crust, this recipe was OK.

Wonderful, easy to remember recipe!

Definitely needed that flour dusting when rolling, I had it stick to my counter, but it pushed together by hand just fine in the pie pan.

This was so simple. I didn't have butter but used margarine instead. I didn't have any problems with rolling at all as others have, and it wasn't fragile or greasy, also how others have suggested. I doubled it to make a top and bottom crust for the Sunday's apple pie recipe on this site.

Wow so easy I got up at 5:30 in the morning want to make my son an apple pie as he requested for his birthday 12 years old! And had to go to work this was so easy and work so well! I substituted coconut oil for the shortening. No problems here I will use this again! Thanks so much!

So easy to do . I was given some fresh apples and I decided to make a pie out of them I used the  " Apple Pie  Filling" recipe  and it came out delicious. My son hated apple pie but he loved this one even the crust. The only thing I did different was I used butter flavored shorting . Thinks!

I used it to bake fruit pies.  It was okay for the ingredients I had.  But the crust was very brittle..  crumbly.  The ingredients were enough for for small pies. My mom are one. I ate the rest.

As it says, I love it ?? it's so easy to make and I got a recipe for apple pie filling on the internet and  wand has a nice texture to it, the crust isn't too crusty or chewy, it's perfect.  And the apple pie filling I got from the internet, delicious.....  I can't even tell you all how good it was ???? definitely recommend this recipe to everyone, even the people who say it's horrible (the people who put bad reviews probably didn't make the dough right or bake it right)

I am not a very good baker,  so I like things that are quick and easy, and this recipe did not let me down! It was very simple to roll out after I realized I needed to put more flour on the dough, (Again, I'm not a baker) and it tasted great! Thank you!

I have tried a lot of different recipes for pie crust and this by far is the most fool proof! It works great for pot pies and savory pies.  The only change I do is to add 1/2 tsp of salt to each crust to give a little more flavor.

Amazingly easy. I love cooking, but am new to baking. I made my first ever handmade (not canned) squash pie. And wanted to go all the way and hand make a dough as well. This recipe is so easy I saw it here and was able to recall it off the top of my head days later. My pie and crust look incrediable! This will be my go to recipe for now on!

Absolutely perfect crust.  Nice and moist.  This recipe only calls for one pie crust. So I had double it to make the top layer.  Also, I had put dough in the refrigerator for about one hour before rolling it out.  After I had put the top crust on, I brushed it with egg whites to make it a little bit crispy.

This recipe is exactly what I learned from my Grandmother, who made about 35 pies a week at the community college.  Easiest pie crust ever, and always turns out great.  Grandma learned to cook when her mother ran a boarding house back in the very early 1900's!  Guess maybe this recipe was original then!! Sheila Duvall

This is my go to pie crust recipe. I have had good results with butter as well as Earth Balance if I want it to be vegan. I found that keeping the butter kind of chunky yields the best results.

This is the same pie crust recipe that my mother passed to me and my sisters and she got it from way back to my great grandmother.  I use butter flavored shortening for more flavor and just a pinch of salt.  I use very cold water and drizzle it over the flour and butter to make sure I need the whole quarter cup.  Very tasty and easy!

Super easy. I thought it would come out greasy, but it's just perfectly flakey. It's not a recipe to use if you want a very clean looking pie, though. It puffs up quite a bit.

Even though I had to modify to make it the way I like, the easy formula still helps me memorize how I do this crust, therefore I gave 5 stars. I increased this recipe by 50% to make a thicker pie crust, with a little left over. I don't care for the crust recipes with egg and vinegar added, but I do add 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/4 t. salt. First time I used this recipe, I discovered this ratio of flour/shortening/water makes the dough a little stickier than I like. Next time I tried a little extra flour: 1 3/4 c. flour, 3/4 c. Crisco, and 3/8 c. ice cold water. Perfect! This makes a thick deep dish single layer pie crust, with only a couple tablespoons of extra dough left over from the edges. I rest the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes or  so before I roll it out between two lightly floured sheets of wax paper. (Don't forget to prick the sides and bottom of the crust with a fork before you bake. Otherwise it balloons up and makes a mess.) Then I bake it for 12 minutes in a 425F oven. Great crust! Thanks Deirdre!

I am not sure what to say about this recipe.  In appearance it was flaky.  Rolling it out between plastic wrap was not too hard to roll (although not exactly easy either). I couldn't add all the water.  In fact it didn't seem to need any water.  Once I added the oil it went into a ball.  However, I did add some water.  Compared to what my  mom used to make I would say this looked like it had too much oil in it.  I noticed that the bottom crust never cooked no matter how long I left the cobbler in the oven.  I am using the left overs again today but this time I am prebaking the crust before adding any filling so that I don't have the raw dough situation.  I think overall this recipe just has too much oil.  Not much taste other than oil either.  It rolled ok but very easily fell apart in transfer process.  Since all the reviews are so great, I will try again maybe adding the full amount of water and then more flour through the rolling process.

This is the recipe that I've used for over 40 years, when I was first married, and I still think it's the best!  I've tried other recipes that claim to be "the best" pie crust, but always come back to this simple one.

I have been struggling to learn how to make a good crust and have tried (and failed) with several other recipes.  This was very easy and worked beautifully!  I added a little salt and used it for quiche.  I might add 2T sugar instead and use it for a sweet pie. Will definitely make again.

This really was the easiest and flakiest pie crust!  I've been looking for a recipe like this.  I added water until I got the right consistency and I didn't end up using a full 1/4 cup.  I would suggest doing that instead of simply adding the water.  Great recipe!

Pies and Pie crusts are not my specialty, but this was the easiest pie crust I've ever made, very easy to roll out.  The crust was flaky and light.  This will now be my go to recipe.

Definitely easy to remember!  Easy to make, as well.  I used this crust as the crust for the Sour Cream Chicken Quiche on here.  Very light and flaky. Just a note: I didn't end up using all of the water, when making pie crust--like bread dough--the humidity can affect the amount of liquids you need, so go slow and don't be afraid to use less or more water.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well, i made a Raspberry cream pie with this. The taste was ok, and i followed the directiosn exactly but there wasn't enough to fill even a shallow pie crust dish.

Despite the description, I felt this was a simple enough recipe even for someone just learning to bake. It is very easy, but it seemed like a little bit too much shortening, which is what I think causes it to turn dark brown too soon. The dough came out a bit too moist with the shortening and water, which made the crust stick to the pan after baking more than I would have liked. Yes, this is easy to remember, but I'd suggest remembering to add more flour, or subtract a little shortening, and the equation will make for better pies. :)

WOW! This is the best pie crust I have ever made, tasted, seen and felt! I think that novice bakers can make this though. To make a reasonably sweet pie crust though, add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar to the mix. Great pie crust. Will definitely add this to my pie collection! Thanks Dierdree, you have solved all of my problems!

Turns out every time, even doubles well.  Sometimes I add a pinch of salt, and sometimes I chill the dough, but it always turns out just fine.

This recipe is amazingly easy.  For my pecan I just made, the graphic even inspired me to create my own visual on top.  Thank you for this contribution.  I much rather like creating things with ingredients I already have than to purchase more ingredients, or buy an already made crust.

I am definitely a novice pastry maker, but this turned out perfectly!  I followed the suggestions to chill for 20 minutes and it was easy to work with, nice and flaky when done.  Thank you for posting it!

Very good considering how simple it was and the few ingredients it has. It's ready to roll after about 20 minutes in the refrigerator. It doesn't get any easier than this.

This was a hit at Christmas!  I used butter and that made it a bit fragile, but so delicious!
