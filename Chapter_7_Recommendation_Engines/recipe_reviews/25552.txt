These are much more like muffins and the are absolutely delicious!  I made some changes - I didn't have any buttermilk so just omitted totally, used 1 c. white and 1 c. whole wheat flour, subsituted the shortening with applesauce, and used 4 bananas (they were going bad).  I also used a strusel topping per other reviews.  It makes a lot and even after 5 days they were still moist!  I will try freezing some next time - will make again soon - as I have some bananas getting over ripe.

My changes: vegetable oil instead of shortening, 1/4tsp nutmeg. Soft velvety inside, perfect crumb on the outside. Not strongly flavored by the apple or banana, but you can still taste each, along with the spices. For more of a dessert I may add walnuts or whitechocolate chips and a cream cheese frosting. Great as is though! I bet they freeze well too.

While I noticed that a good number of reviewers chose to chop the apples in this recipe, and while I'm sure that would be good as well,  I kind of had a hunch that just as with similar recipes made with zucchini or carrots,  shredding the apple would contribute to the cupcake/muffin's (they're both so similar these days!) texture.  I'm so glad I followed the recipe exactly as written!  Whether you call it a cupcake or a muffin, this is a nice little treat - most important, what we always look for first, they're moist.  But they also have their own, unique little flavor going on, not quite banana but not quite apple, with a hint of spice. I'm also glad I preferred to keep it on the "bare naked" side, even though I was tempted to frost or glaze these.  I merely topped them with some demerara sugar (aka sugar in the raw) which gave them a sparkly crunch.  Growing up in Milwaukee, where the submitter says this recipe originates, I can see how these would have been a part of the great, ethnic cooking and baking traditions we have here. Very nice recipe - (love the shredded, not chopped, apples!)

These were absolutely delicious! But beware -- the first batch I cooked got overcooked and burned. To prevent this with the second batch, I set the oven to 350 and then made sure the tops of the cupcakes were even before popping them in the oven. I took the others' advice and chopped the apples, and I also added chopped walnuts in the mix It was fabulous!! It tasted just like the buttermilk spice muffins at Mimi's Cafe. You must try these!!!

These are really good! I took the advice of some reviewers and chopped the apples instead of shredding. I also subsituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar and topped the muffins with the mixture of margerine, brown sugar, walnuts and flour. I offered these muffins to my workmates and there were no leftovers!

If you haven't tried this recipe, do yourself and everyone around you a favor, make it.  This is definitely a "Five Star", "the Best!"
I absolutely "loved" this recipe and so did my husband and his co-workers!    The taste was sooooo good and it was super moist.  I doubled the recipe and made a two-layer 9-inch cake and 12 cupcakes. I took the time to read a lot of the reviews and diced my apples instead of shredding them.  You could taste both the banana and apple, what a wonderful combination!  This will be one of my special recipes that will be made often.
Thank you for sharing!  :-)

I love these cupcakes! I diced the apples instead of shredding to get more of the apple flavor as some others had suggested--worked great. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 4 tablespoons of yogurt which worked fine. 6 of them were gone in a matter of a few minutes out of the oven with no frosting! Thanks for an excellent and easy recipe for two great fruits!

These muffins were really good.  It's a mix between banana nut bread and apple pie!  I followed some other tips w/ the apples.  Instead of grating the apples, I chopped them up into small slivers instead.  I used fresh nutmeg also, I think that makes a huge difference in how the muffins taste.  

I got a little less than 24 muffins.  I think I ended w/ 18 small muffins.  I wonder if I can substitute half of the "shortening" and use applesauce instead?  Because I did grate some apple into the mix and it tasted fine. 

I ate a couple of muffins and threw the rest into a freezer bag.  Pull out and microwave for a quick breakfast or snack.  You should definitely try it!

OK, now I was married into a Polish family, so I have a tough crowd. My husband says this is not Polish but the man ate so many of them who cares! Loved it! Thanks for sharing.

YUM!  This was my last attempt to get the baby to eat fruit & it worked, he loved them as did his brother & sister!  I made them egg free (because baby's allergic) by adding another banana mashed with 1/2 tsp. baking powder & that added extra banana flavor as well.  Thank you Barbara, these are great!

YUMMY!!!
Now for my version...
First, I made this into a loaf of bread (50 minutes at 325).   It makes more then a loaf sized pan...I have an extra-large loaf pan, so it worked.   Otherwise you can do two regular loaf pans and fill half full.

Ingredient substitutions:
2 cups all-purpose flour, 
1 teaspoon baking soda, 
1 teaspoon salt, 
1 teaspoon Pumpkin Pie Spice*,
2/3 cup Butter*,
1/2 cup white sugar*,
1/2 cup brown sugar*,
2 eggs,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract,
4 oz. vanilla yogurt*,
2 large bananas- (mashed),
2 apples - peeled, cored and shredded,
1 cup walnuts, chopped*.

Thanks to all the other reviews who gave me the ideas for the substitutions!!

This is the best Banana muffin I've made yet!!! But I did make some changes:
1.I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder,
2.substituted fat-free yogurt for buttermilk (because I didn't have any),
3.Chopped the apples,
4.I added 1/8 cup sugar to separated egg whites and whipped it till it formed soft peaks.
The step 4 made the muffins INCREDIBLY moist and DELICIOUS!!!
Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

I topped with my Great Grandma's 3-6-9 caramel frosting. 3 tbsp butter, 6 tbsp evaporated milk and 9 tbsp brown sugar. Bring to a rolling boil for 1 minute, cool completely and then mix in powdered sugar until you reach desired thickness. The caramel really compliments the fruit and spice!

My family LOVED this recipe! I was expecting them to come out like a cupcake, but without the icing they're like a muffin. As a muffin they are a great breakfast food.
thankyou!!

As soon as I took these cupcakes out of the oven my children, my husband,
and the neighbor children that were visiting gobbled them up! 
I did not shred the apples, but instead rough chopped them, and this seem to 
add an extra oomph to the cupcakes, you could really taste the apples.

I did an ingredient search because I had a couple apples and a couple bananas that I had to use up.  I came across this recipe and couldn't have been more pleased with my choice!  The only thing I did differently was that I didn't make this into cupcakes.  I greased a 9X13 pan and baked it for 30 mins at 350 deg.  Once cooled, I topped it with a brown sugar/cream cheese frosting, also found on this site.  I brought it to work tonite and had the best response.  The cream cheese frosting was not obnoxiously sweet, and it let the moistness of the cake take the stage.  I did not chop the apples, I grated mine, and would do so again.  This recipe will be in my family recipe rotation from now on.  Good stuff.

Yummy!  I chopped my apples (actually my husband did for me!)  I used half the shortening and added 1/3 c applesauce and sprinkled the muffins w brown sugar.  Also, I was out of cinnamon so I had to use pumpkin pie spice instead.  A KEEPER!

I made these cupcakes because I had extra bananas and apples that I didn't want to waste, so I plugged that into ingredients and found this recipe. I am so glad I did. My family went crazy over these cupcakes, which I totally didn't expect. Finally I tasted one and it was excellent. I topped them with the simple vanilla glaze, a slice of banana and some cinnamon sugar. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful cupcakes!!! Moist and it sure smells as good as it tastes.  My friend who doesn't like dessert gave a thumb up to this cake.  I reduced sugar to one cup and used half/half white/brown sugar. I subsituted shortening with veg. oil and buttermilk with yogurt.  And voila, they are so yummy.  Thank you Barbara for sharing us this great recipe.

These were AMAZING!  I shredded the apples, used applesauce in place of the shortening and used almond milk instead of buttermilk and Gluten free flour mixture.  This made them gluten free, dairy free and fat free.  No one could tell that they met the special dietary needs of my kids :)

This recipe is awesome! I just tweaked a couple things since I was missing some ingredients. Instead of shortening, I used 1/3 cup margarine, and 1/3 apple sauce. also left out buttermilk. I only had one medium banana, so I added an additional 1/4 cup applesauce for moisture. also added a little extra cinnamon cause we love it =) 

I made a simple steusel for the top (brown sugar, butter, and flour), which turned out well. I also reserved a little of the apples and carmelized them in brown sugar and butter to top it with. 

They're definately a little more like muffins, but still fab! my husband and I already ate almost the whole batch, haha =)

I cut the recipe in half and used small loaf pan and 6 muffins. It worked out perfectly.  Obviously the loaf pan has to bake a bit longer. I used vegtable oil instead of shortening and I didnt bother peeling the apples.  YUMMO

Easy combination of apples and bananas to make a moist and tasty cake; recalls an autumn pie with a hint of sweetness coming from the bananas and the apples.  Used 4 medium apples; 2 shredded and 2 diced.  I sprinkled walnuts and toasted coconuts to the bottom and top of the bundt cake for texture.  Baked at 350* for 1 hour.  Will make again...

I followed this recipe pretty closely but only used one apple (all I had) and only put in 1/3 cup of shortening. I also used 1 cup of Whole Wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour. They turned out great!

I would call this a muffin rather than a cupcake but it sure is good! I replaced the shortening with equal amount of applesauce and replace buttermilk with skim milk. Because the applesauce was sweetened, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup. The mixture seemed too wet to me so I added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal. I reduced baking temp to 350 degrees. Done in 25 minutes. Wonderful!

Delicious!! I try to not substitute ingredients as I feel that after altering them you cannot really give an honest review but this time I had to!  The changes I made were - sub applesauce for the shortening, used splenda instead of sugar and I added raisins and cinnamon chips ... oh my they are great!! But not cupcake like - more very moist little muffins. Thanks so much!

This was exactly everything I wanted an apple and banana "cupcake" (I would call it a muffin) to be.  I didn't have shortening so I just substituted vegetable oil for that.  Didn't have buttermilk either so I used 1/4 cup of milk and added a little bit of vinegar to it.  Diced the apples instead of shredding so that there's still a nice texture to the muffin.  This recipe comes out super moist and delicious.

AWESOME! Only thing different was that I reduced the sugar a bit but upped the bananas.  You just gotta try this recipe. I know I will be making this time and again.  Thanks a million Barbara!

Great recipe!  Just the ticket for browning bananas and apples ready for applesauce.  I subbed half of the oil for applesauce I made with some of the apples.  I also chopped the apples coarsely like other reviewers and they turned out as yummy soft morsels in the muffins.  I left out the nuts as my son is allergic (too bad, I bet walnuts would be fantastic in this recipe!) I thought about making a cream cheese frosting to drizzle on top (like other reviewers did) but once I tried them out of the oven, I decided they are really too good without it.  Would be great with icing if taking somewhere for a sweet treat though!  I doubled the recipe (using 4 bananas and 5 small apples)  and it turned out 2.5 dozen regular sized muffins and 2 dozen mini-muffins.  I am freezing some to pop out individually for snacks and breakfast.  Next time I might make with whole wheat flour or add some wheat germ or something to make a bit healthier yet!

My toddler and husband loved these!  They're a great breakfast muffin.  Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar by half (the banana and apple are quite enough).  For ease, I also recommend using a 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce instead of peeling and shredding an apple (TOO MUCH WORK/MESS!!).

It's my first time to make cupcakes. I even not have the cupcakes set. But I tasted great! All of my friends and  her friend's baby like it very much. 
The texture is a bit wet and the taste is not too sweet.

The first time I made this, I made it with over 10 tablespoons of butter (the equivalent of 2/3 cup shortening); the second time around I scaled the butter back to 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter and I used the classic quick bread mixing technique where I melted the butter and added it to the wet ingredients and then folded in the dry ingredients.  Much easier than creaming the butter with sugar.  The muffins were delicious and didn't suffer at all from reducing the fat content.

This recipe ROCKS!! Followed everything on the recipe except the number of apples used because the apples I used were small pommes apples so I used 3 instead of 2. Also, I think the muffin cups can be filled 2/3 full instead of half. I don't cook much but this recipe was very easy to make and reeeaaaaly delicious. THANK YOU SO MUCH Barbara!

I liked these muffins (cupcakes). I would make them again. I didn't change anything, but I think they would be good w/ nuts. Nice for breakfast w/ my coffee. And although they aren't the healthiest (white flour & sugar) atleast they have bananas & apples so they aren't completely bad for me!!

Wow family loved this recipe.  The recipe does not say what size or kind of apple to use so I had used two large Jazz (at least label on the apples say will check on proper name later).  Found that batter was very thick may have over beat the shortening.  I had made 12 cupcakes and one 8 inch round cake.  Found that they were moist and full of flavour and not one ingredient overpowered the other. Just used basic butter/cream cheese frosting but used banana extract instead of vanilla extract.  Will be making again.

Delicious! I like how you get a hint of each flavor without any one being overpowering. I didn't have any buttermilk so I just skipped that, it didn't cause any problems.

YUM!  I just made these cupcake/muffins for my family and they were a big hit!  I followed the advice from other reviewers and chopped the apple.  I think this helped the apple flavor come through better.  I also used only 1/3 cup of shortening, then mae up for the other 1/3 cup with applesauce.  This too helped the apple flavor be more prominent, as it would have been lost next to the distinctive banana taste.  One more thing; I had no buttermilk, so I just used regular skim milk with a bit of lemon juice.  Wonderful recipe- thanks so much! ( Oh, by the way, this only made 18 cupcake.muffins for me- don't know why.  Plus, I glazed these with "vanilla glaze" off this site and it worked out fantastically- especially after I added food coloring to make it pink:) That made them beautiful and fun, as well as delicious).

These were to die for!  I made crumb muffins, these were my changes: 1 C. whole wheat flour plus 1 C. all purpose flour, 1/3 C. olive oil plus 1/3 C. unsweetened apple sauce in place of shortening, 3/4 C. white sugar plus 1/2 C. brown sugar, added 1/4 t. nutmeg, added a basic crumb topping (oatmeal/butter/brown sugar), baked 10 delicious jumbo muffins @ 350 degrees for 27 minutes.

Had two banannas, not enough for bananna recipe, and a bunch of apples so went searching and found this gem!! I think the shreading of the apples is key so there aren't big chunks that will make it fall apart easier. I used my stand mixer attachment but you could use a cheese grater or salad shooter.  I also didn't have buttermilk, but did have vanilla yogurt so omitted the vanilla. Reduced the sugar to a cup m(plenty sweet.. you could even go less) and used butter instead. The apple taste is very subtle. They are taking longer to cook and get golden... 25 min for the minis and they are VERY moist. Possibly b/c I altered the recipe but who cares... they are yummy!!

This is an excellent recipe.  Cupcakes come out light and moist and stay moist for a few days if kept in an airtight container.  A little bit much nutmeg for my taste... maybe use 1/4 tsp.  These would also be good with raisins.  If you like them sweet, frost with vanilla frosting.  I will be making these again.  Thank you.

I would give it 5 stars if only it would have tasted more like bananas and apples. They were very good and moist, but very bland. I expected them to taste more like the name suggests. I used both chopped and grated apples.

I followed the recipe as written & did not care for these cupcakes. They were heavy plus, the spices and sugar were not enough for my taste. Need to fill cupcakes about 2/3 or to the top to get a nice "dome shape". Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

These were pretty good.  I guess I was expecting more from all the other reviews.  My kids liked them.  Next time I'll fill the muffin cups more.  Mine didn't seem to rise much.  Good way to use up those bananas.

I made this into two loaves of bread - and all my co-workers went "bananas" for it! Very moist and tasty - the bananas are not as overpowering as you expect them to be. Next time I'll try adding a streusel topping for a little variety.

One of the best banana bread recipes I've tasted! I doubled the recipe and was able to make 12 muffins and 2 loaves. I brought the loaves to work and got rave reviews! Bake loaves at 325 degrees for 55-65 minutes and be sure to check with a toothpick. Super moist!

I LOVED these and so did others.  I chunked the apples and it was perfect.  I also put an icing on top - just your basic cream cheese concoction.  Also, it could've used a bit more banana just to bring out the flavor, but otherwise, they are WONDERFUL!

Amazing! Perfect texture- although I'm not sure why they're called cupcakes. They are definitely muffins. Delicious flavor. Followed the recipe exactly. DEFINITELY making these again.

Loved these and so did family members who tried them.  They have a quite unique flavor. Frosting/icing is really not necessary. Used yogurt instead of buttermilk.

I just finished making the "muffins".  I did not change the recipe other than I don't use shortening, I used oil (cut back a little) and added chopped walnuts and crasins. They don't raise much so you can fill the muffin tins a little higher than normal.I shredded the apple since that seems to be a discussion point and didn't top them with anything. Overall, they are pretty good and will be my breakfast muffins this week for work.  I will make again.

Instead of making it into cupcakes I made it into a cake with a layer of apples in the middle (I poured half the batter into the baking pan, then spread the apples on and finally poured in the remaining batter), baking for about 35 minutes. 

I modified the recipe a bit and used 3 ripe bananas and about 2/3 cups of sugar. I think I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time. 

My family loved the cake!

Followed the directions exact except replaced 1/4 cup white sugar with brown. They came out perfect and everyone loved them! Like a banana bread muffin with bits of moist apple inside. I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting for the top but they were good even without the frosting!

These are dangerously delicious!!  I was too lazy to make cupcakes so I just made two loaves and increased the cooking time to about 40 min.  Otherwise, i followed the recipe to a tee!  I did finish with raw sugar like another reviewer suggested and this was a delicious sweet and crunchy touch!  Thank you, this is a keeper!

Call them a cupcake or a muffin, there seems to be no real difference in what goes in to them. I typically think of a muffin as slightly healthier, involving more fruit/nuts than a cupcake, and this recipe has more fruit for sure.

I see some people talked about cutting up their apples, I shredded mine on a regular cheese shredder, which was very quick, and used two banana's on the slightly smaller side. These turned out very moist and yummy. I also did not use shortening, as I typically change it out for butter whenever possible. I believe I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead. 

Since I topped mine with a cream cheese frosting, mine were definetly cupcakes.

Followed recipe without deviation and thought they had excellant flavor, not too sweet at all. I think once they cool a bit I will try the brown sugar frosting that another reviewer mentioned. On it's own it's a very moist muffin.

I changed a lot based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I substituted 3-4 Tbsp plain yogurt for the buttermilk. Used half whole wheat flour, cloves instead of nutmeg and grapeseed oil instead of shortening. Also, I left the peel on the apple during grating and used a bit extra banana. Turned out great and moist. The kids (4 and 2 yrs) actually made this and it still turned out great.

Fantastic way to use up extra fruit--delicious and moist!! I used 2 apples, 1 banana and even 1 peach, and it was fantastic!  Substituted plain yogurt for all but 2 T of butter and reduced sugar to 1 cup (could use even less!)  I'm also gluten free, so used gluten free flour.  Turned out fantastic!   Thanks for broadening my baking horizons beyond banana bread and apple crisp!

Definitely muffin like.  I added some ground flax meal, about a half cup of crasins, and some oats to the top.  Great way to use up stray fruit without tasting like banana bread. A kid at the bus stop anointed me muffin genius. Edit: I added about a cup of carrot pulp from the juicer (required a little more flour ~1/3 c), wheat bran instead of flax ~1/3 c , then  skipped the buttermilk and subbed a big spoon of yogurt. More dense and very moist. Delish all over again.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I changed it up though and they were more muffins than cupcakes. Instead of 2 C flour I added in 2/3 C whole wheat flour, 2/3 C quick cooking oats (it was all I had on me but next time I'm going to use rolled oats), and 2/3 C white flour. I changed the shortening to butter and cut it down to 1/2, and I cut down the white sugar by a 1/4. I increased the bananas and cinnamon a bit and sprinkled the muffins with brown sugar (which makes it crunchy on top - AMAZING!). Half of them were gone before they had even cooled!!

Yummmm!  In an attempt to use up from fruit I used two bananas and three apples.  I used 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of oat bran, and only 1/2 cup white sugar.  They came out great!  To make quick work of the apples I halved each apple, cut out the core and shredded the halfs with the skin on.  You will never notice any peel in the cupcake and it adds a bit more fiber.

First let me say to those of you who COMPLETELY changed the recipe then gave this 4 or 5 stars- that makes no sense. If you can't call it 5 stars as is, don't rate as such.  MY 5 STAR RATING IS BASED ON THE RECIPE AS IS!!!!! THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LITTLE CAKE WITH OR WITHOUT FROSTING. ITS A HIT WITH CHILDREN ANS ADULTS!!

Very good, so moist and soft!  The picture shows a lot of frosting but they were delicious with no kind of topping or glaze. I don't like to leave a rating when I alter the recipe but in this case I didn't have buttermilk or milk.  It was such a small amount and they were still fine as one other comment mentioned. The apples make them just different enough from banana bread to make it worth while. Yes, I shredded the apple, the recipe needed the moisture from the shredded apples.

Light, fluffly, moist cupcakes. This is the recipe I've been looking for. It's almost a foolproof recipe. I modified it with 1 cup AP flour, 1 cup cake flour, 2/3 canola oil instead of shortening, 1/4 cup soured soy milk (with 1/2 tsp vinegar) instead of buttermilk, 1 mashed banana instead of 1 cup, and 3 apples instead of 2. I think they needed more flavour, like more cinnamon and swapping out some white sugar for brown sugar.

I loved this recipe!  I made some of the changes people recommended, but only out of necessity.  I didn't have buttermilk so I swapped it for apples sauce (4 oz.), I didn't have shortening so I swapped it for canola oil (same measurements).  I also added an extra banana, but only because it was use it or lose it time!  I added nuts to the top of a few to offer a variety to my family.  And, lastly, instead of making small muffins, I used a large muffin pan and filled them up which made large brimming muffins.  DELICIOUS!  No icing on top so my kids ate them for breakfast.  Not a bad way to start the day!

This is a very nice recipe - I don't like plain banana cupcakes/muffins - the apple makes them perfect.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I cut the sugar down to 2/3 c - could have gone to 1/2 cup (and used rapadura) and used all fresh ground flour.  I saw a lot of people diced instead of grating the apple, but grating was so quick and easy!  Dicing would have taken me twice as long.  We will definitely be making these again.  Maybe with some nuts next time.

I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and substituted the shortening for unsweetened applesauce.  After 25 mins. the outside was done, but the inside was a soggy mess.  I baked them for an addt.'l 10 mins., but the inside was still gooey, soggy..not edible.

These cupcakes are moist and yummy, however, they are more like muffins than cupcakes.

These cupcakes are amazing!! I'm obsessed with baking cupcakes and these are the best ones I've made yet! I followed the recipe exactly, and baked them for 18 minutes and they turned out moist and delicious! I used a cinnamon cream cheese  icing from the pumpkin spice cupcake recipe and my family can not stop eating them! 5 stars!

Delish!  I only had 2 apples to use up so I halved the recipe (and used no bananas) and made this into a small loaf.  I used brown sugar instead of white and was too lazy to peel the apples before grating.  Topped with glaze and this was easy, most, and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm so good!  They are definitely more like muffins than cupcakes.  I kept telling people they are "apple banana spice muffins" and everyone thought they were delicious!  Don't be afraid to chop your apples into slightly larger pieces than the recipe calls for, I did and you really get that nice apple-spice flavor with every bite.

Yum!!  These are really good.  More like muffins than cupcakes though.  I also substituted half whole wheat flour, next time I'm going to try to cut some of the shortening out and use applesauce...I mean they already have apple in them  :-)  why not.

Really good! Made a few changes to make healthier: 1 c white and 1 c wheat flour; 1/3 veg oil and 1/3 applesauce instead of shortening; 1/2 c better'n egg substitute instead of eggs; everything else the same.  Everyone at work loved.  Topped with pumpkin cream cheese--all the flavors worked well.  Might add pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice to batter next time.  Would probably work well with a peanut butter glaze as well.

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup melted butter & 1/4 cup vegetable oil instead of the shortening. I mixed my dry ingredients first, then added the wet to it. I grated my apples and was glad I did! The texture was very similar to carrot cake. topped them with cream cheese frosting... Adults and children raved! They melt in your mouth!

I cut this recipe in half. These came out more like muffins, I think this was because I used healthier ingredients. I used whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp. homemade apple pie spice, I replaced half of the fat called for in this recipe with homemade organic applesauce, cut back the sugar to a scant 1/4 cup, one free range egg, and a whole teaspoon of vanilla. I got nine medium sized muffins out of this, not twelve. 20 minutes at 350* was just right. My kids really liked these. They make great healthy snacks.

These were great, although I would consider them to be muffins more than cupcakes.  I used 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup shortening to cut down on fat, used 1/2 tsp white vinegar and added milk to equal 1/4 cup buttermilk, and cut the apples into small chunks rather than grate them.  This made 12 regular sized muffins and 24 mini muffins (cooked at 375 for about 15 minutes).

An unexpected but great combination of apples and bananas!  The cake is extremely moist and flavorful, a great complement to the fruit.  I made these cupcake/muffins in the giant muffin tins and it yielded a dozen.

These cupcakes were awesome and easy to make.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a 6oz. plain greek yogurt and they were still fabulous! I also chopped the apples.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Yum.  I'm an expert cook & baker, but I never made banana apple cupcakes b4.  Used 4 organic bananas (as they were going bad) and 1 granny smith apple shredded.  Used veg oil (not shortening) and nutmeg too.  OMG My hubby loved loved! moist & still good 4 days later.  Made cream cheese frosting but didn't need frosting.  Took to work & went over fab.  Will definitely make soon again.

I used unsweetened applesauce instead of shortening and I found these to be very sweet but they had a great texture.  Tried again with only 2/3 cup sugar and they were plenty sweet for me.  Also reduced nutmeg by half and chopped the apples.

We loved these!  I made a few changes. Used canola oil instead of shortening. I used 1.5c bananas (had 4 that needed to be used today!) I used only 1/2 the sugar (and used brown--I was out of white).   They were fantastic!!!

great recipe (moist, delicious!), but they taste more like banana bread muffins than cupcakes, so i just put a little butter on top right before eating. i tried cream cheese frosting as suggested, but it didn't seem to fit the recipe.  put some in the freezer and they warmed up nicely (maybe even better than they were originally)... like one reviewer suggested, i subbed oil for butter. 

i also froze some of these for later. however, we couldn't wait for them to thaw.  they were delicious when frozen, as well. perhaps a good summer treat.  :)

Really Really Good recipe..
I'm out of nutmeg, so i just omit them, and i substitute the shortening with butter, which i think makes it more moist.

At first i was worry coz the batter seems a bit thin (coz i shredded the apples), but after they were baked, wow, what a smell, what a taste! Got perfect crunch on top and super moist inside.

Just make sure u don't burnt them, i turn down the tempt to 330 after the first 15mnts, required 20mnts more in my oven.

Yummy!!Just baked a batch for my daughter to take to school and am having trouble saving enough for the class. They smell and taste absolutely terrific.  Sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top prior to baking, perfect.  I added a small handful of coconut and have renamed these "ABC cupcakes" - for the Apple, Banana, and Coconut.

This was a great recipe! They definitely came out more like muffins, but that was what I was after anyways! I substituted oil for cornstarch and vanilla yogurt for buttermilk (I omitted the vanilla), and they were heavenly. I also added the strudel topping that can be found under the recipe "apple pie muffins" and this made them extra special. A keeper!

Perfect taste. I sprinkled cinnamon on the top and maybe i'll add an extra banana next time.

Delicious! I made them practically guilt free by substituting half the flour for whole wheat flour. I also replaced the oil with applesauce and used a half cup sugar and half cup splenda. I also took advice of others and chopped the apples instead of shredding and I didn't peel them.

Delicious. Moist and tasty. The apples disapeared after baking so next time I think I wil finely dice some of the apples along with shredding. I only had maybe 3/4 cup banana and they still came out yummy. I did the homemade buttermilk substitution from the advice section of Allrecipes as well. Will make again soon.

I wouldn't call them "cupcakes" because they remind me more of banana bread - which is why I baked it in a bundt pan, and it came out great (took a little longer to bake of course).  It was moist and delicious.  I did use butter instead of shortening, and next time, I would probably throw in some nuts just because I like the crunch in this type of quickbread.  Overall, this is a keeper!

I have a toddler who constantly starts apples and bananas, but never finishies them.  This is perfect for all those leftovers.  I put the fruit in the blender and pureed it.  I used butter instead of shortening.

I thought this recipe was very simple to make. I used 1 cup applesauce instead of shredded apples. As others suggested, I used oil instead of shortning and yogurt instead of buttermilk using the same measurements that recipe called for. I baked the recipe as a loaf at 325 for about 50-60 minutes. If your oven is hot, you may want to add a foil tent for the last 10 minutes or loaf might get too brown. There was enough extra batter for about 4 cupcakes. If you use all the batter in the loaf dish, it will overflow. The batter was dense in texture but turned out very well and very moist.

Wonderful! Fluffy and soft - even my one-year old could eat them by herself! I used cake flour instead of all-purpose cos the cake flour I get around here has lower gluten content and the cupcakes were really light! I also reduced the temperature to 350F and they were done in 17 mins - people who have wildly varying ovens should start watching the cakes at around 15 mins. Chopping the apples gave the cakes a wonderful bite. Thanks for sharing Barbara! At first I thought 24 cupcakes would be too many for my small family but they disappeared as soon as they were cooled.

These were a HUGE hit. Any time I can sneak fruit to my kids is a great accomplishment. They gobbled them up and didn't even ask what was in them. These will be made again and again.

Delcious!  Our house has never smelled so good as something has been baking.  The aroma is wonderful, and the taste is just as good. A very moist cupcake--tastes more like a muffin.

Giving only four stars since I did make a couple changes.  I used applesauce instead of shortening, made buttermilk substitute from milk and lemon jc and used slightly less nutmeg.  These turned out great.  I just used a cheese grated for the apples.

I made this on a whim. I had one banana and one apple, so I cut the recipe in half. Used butter instead of shortening, and didn't have buttermilk. The rest I made as written, including grating the apple. Very good! I didn't use any topping, and I really don't think it needs any. I could even cut down on the sugar if I made it again. Moist and light.

Made these for a coworkers birthday and everyone in the office loved them! I substituted butter for the shortening and  1/4 cup milk + 3/4 cup plain yogurt for the buttermilk. They were really moist and delicious. Not too sweet. More like muffins than cupcakes. Will definitely bake again.

I had made a substitute, I used non fat greek yogurt and 2/3 1% milk. But I think that made the muffins less cakey. I will try again with just the yogurt. We still loved them. 

ps I didn't taste banana but my apples tasted awesome LOL

These were delicious! I made half a recipe and topped them with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I made them exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. They were moist with just the right balance of apple and banana, and perfectly spiced. Will make these again!

Delicious!  I had to rate it right away.  We ate some straight out of the oven.  I followed the recipe for measurements but I had to change a few things because of what I had in the house.  Used old frozen bananas that I'd let thaw over night in the fridge, and since I wanted to use all three, it was more than a cup of bananas.  I left the "juice" in from those, too.  I shredded the apples with a box grater (easier than I thought it'd be.)  I used granny smith apples.  I used butter-flavored shortening since that's all we had.  Didn't have vanilla (what?!?!) so I used almond extract and a tiny bit of cinnamon extract since the almond was gone too.  We also had no buttermilk, so I used a tablespoon of vinegar and filled to 1 cup of milk in a measuring cup, then let that sit 5 minutes and used 1/4 of it.  Seemed weird, but our "cupcakes" turned out awesome!  They were perfect after 22 minutes.  Perfectly moist, as well. The ones in my baking stone muffin pan were perfect, the ones in the tin didn't rise as much.  I had two 3 year olds help with this, and they loved it and loved the end result, too!  Going to hit the store and make some caramel-like frosting for them to finish them tomorrow evening :)  I really hope these are as amazing cooled and day-old as they were tonight (I think they will be!)

My family decided these were more muffin like the way i made them.  I made a few changes, but really liked the overall outcome.  First, I used margarine instead of shortening, sour milk (milk + lemon juice) instead of buttermilk, egg substitute (like egg beaters) instead of eggs, and used about 1/3 cup mashed banana (only had 1 over-ripe banana on hand) + a little more than 2/3 cup of pumpkin purée, and added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg called for in the recipe.  They came out a nice color, flavor and texture, and are great for fall!

Yum Yum! I made this when I had both brown bananas and apples that were going bad. I used Canola Oil instead of shortening and Yogurt Drink instead of buttermilk (because that's what I had :) ) and I loved it. I omitted the icing and had thme for breakfast - what a treat!

This recipe tastes great, except i didn't have eggs or sugar. So i used brown sugar instead and I have a egg re placer powder that worked too. thanks for the recipe. I also added a brown sugar, cinnamon and margarine topping. It added a good crunch to the muffin.

These were just ok following the recipe exactly. Can easily be 4 or 5 stars by making a few changes. I chopped my apples with the skins on for more apple flavour. Filled the muffin cup 3/4 of the way, and topped with a lemon-cream cheese frosting. These are really more of a muffin tho, not a cupcake.

The cupcakes taste delicious and are incredibly moist. They ended up on the small side. I was making a half recipe to see if they were worth taking to a something important. They are definitely good enough - next time I'll make enough mix for 36 and put it in 24 cupcake liners so that they are larger.

I'm sure if you followed the recipe to the tee it would be excellent, but I didn't have all the ingredients, so these are the changes I made: 2/3 cup of margarine instead of shortening, 1/4 cup milk instead of buttermilk, 4 smaller apples blended in a processor, no bananas.  I also added about 1/4 cup of raisins.  Then made some cream cheese frosting to top, and my kids and I loved them!  It made 12 large cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes.

I could wish for a more banana taste, so I might add more next time, but delicious.  Chop if you want chunks of apple, it just depends on the texture you're going for.

Terrific. Moist, tasty and appealing to my children. Since their breakfast is normally chocolate something or other, this is a welcome change that they devour.

These are so good.  With so many ideas in the reviews I decided to follow the recipe closely to help me dedice what we'd like best. It's true, the banana flavor is subtle, we might have liked more banana flavor but we still really liked these and I'll make them again.  I did use 1/2 ww flour, that's the only change though, and I'll try more banana next time.

i really enjoyed this recipe. it was very simple to make and it didn't take a lot of time.  a lot of reviewers said that it was more like a muffin than a cupcake, but it is very light and fluffy more like a cupcake in my opinion. i added a very simple vanilla glaze on top more so for looks than anything. i will make these again.

The only reason for the 4 stars (because these are wonderful) is that I would not call these a cupcake.  They are much more like a muffin.  They are not light and tender like I tend to think of a cupcake, but are more dense and chewy.  We still enjoyed the flavor, and I made my own icing drizzle with powdered sugar, cinnamon and apple juice to add to the apple flavor.  With the added icing, we couldn't stop eating these.  I did only end up with 18, and they were not huge, so I don't know how you would get 24 out of this recipe.

I loved these cupcakes!  Although.. these are more like muffins in all honesty!  They taste delicious. I did modify it just a tad based on reviews.  I used applesauce instead of shortening, omitted the buttermilk entirely and used an egg substitute instead of eggs since my daughter is allergic to eggs. First time I made this, I used flaxseed as the egg substitute - the muffins were a little dense.  The second time, I used ENER-G and they turned out so delicious!  Because you can alter the ingredients, this is also an excellent vegan recipe - Highly recommended!

great recipe. i have made this many times and its an easy, delicious on the go breakfast.healthier and still DELICOUS version. my changes: instead of adding the entire 2 cups flour, i use 2 cups flour & one cup oatmeal. i replace the 2/3 cup shortening with applesauce, and i didnt have buttermilk, so i used regular milk. to save time, i peel the apples, than chop them up on the cutting board with a cleaver - dont waste time being dainty and trying to them cut on small plate.

I made these for my daughter's first birthday, and they were a big hit!  My picky eater son even liked them very much.  Not too sweet, no frosting to get all over the place, and no chocolate and nuts for little ones who might have food allergies.  I will definitely be making these again someday!

EXCELLENT. Used applesauce instead of shortning, diced the apples, and made mini muffins that I cooked for 12 min. Oh, did half whole wheat flour as well. SUPER yummy, moist, and DELISH!

These turned out great!  Made a few minor changes like yogart instead of buttermilk and applesauce instead of apples.  Also added crumb topping.  Theses have a wonderful melt in your mouth consistency.  Loved by kids and adults alike.

Added a brown sugar crumb on top...super-good.  Did not have buttermilk, used half & half.  Added more spice.  Used agave syrup instead of white sugar.  Used Becel instead of shortening.  This is a keeper. Thanks for the inspiration.

These were AWESOME! I stuck to the recipe except for the apples, which I diced. Also, I didn't have any buttermilk handy so I used regular milk. Can't wait to try it with buttermilk to see if they'll be even better, but I'm scared that my head might explode if they are! The kids gobbled them up like there was no tomorrow... and... umm... ok, so did I :D

This is a delicious recipe! I subbed 1/2 cup of oatmeal for 1/2 cup of the flour to add some texture variety. Also, I used 1/3 cup of butter and 1/3 applesauce to intensify the apple flavor and cut back on fat. I topped with cream cheese icing! My family loved it!

I LOVE this recipe!  The first time I made it I halved it but forgot to half the apples - so I mixed in a little more and put some on top of each muffin!  I was glad i did as it seemed to help define the yummy apple taste.  I made these again a couple days ago, so did the same thing doubling the apples and i just LOVE them!  Fabulous with cream cheese frosting drizzled on top!

Wow. Ok, these are absolutely scrumptious!  They're so soft and delicious!  You have to make me stop eating them.  I substituted vegetable oil for the shortening and yogurt for the buttermilk.  Now I only wish I had made more....

There aren't enough stars!  WOW!  I used a little more bananas (about 1 1/2 cups) and apples (4, chopped, not shredded due to previous reviews) because I had a lot of fruit I needed to use up.  I topped these with cream cheese frosting I had leftover from making red velvet cupcakes.  They are seriously the best muffins I have ever had.  And the smell coming from the oven makes you float!  THANK YOU BARBARA!!!

This was a great recipe. I choppped the apples instead of shredding like others suggested and it turned out wonderful. I used half whole wheat and all purpose flour and it turned out fine. I don't know if I can call this a cupcake though unless you add frosting like I did. Both my dad and boyfriend went back for seconds. very delicious.

these are really good!  I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce and threw in some pecans.  Moist as can be, and a wonderful flavor.   I was never a fan of ban. muffins but these are wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

i LOVE these cupcakes.  I think it is delicious without the frosting.  just a little bit of frosting would be good if you prefer it.  I didn't add the nutmeg but I used a teaspoon of cinnamon instead.  Still amazingly delicious

Yum! I also substituted vegetable oil for shortening. I added 3 bananas total and topped with chopped pecans and brown sugar. I chopped the apples rather than shredding and an apple flavor definitely comes through because of it. With this mixture these were definitely more of a muffin texture.

Used 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp clove & 1% milk instead & still yummy & moist. Frosted w/Brown Sugar Frosting (where I used molasses instead of corn syrup)  Very easy.  I used 25 min cook time on smallish muffins which was perfect.

These muffins were very moist and tender. I did use a bit of canola oil mixed with applesauce to lighten it up. Very tasty.

Worthy of 4.5 stars. Neither of the fruits outshined the other. A delicate combination.
I doubled the recipe. Did not add all the sugar. Used low fat vanilla yogurt  as suggested by another reviewer and used canola oil instead of the shortening.
Thanks for the post

I used chopped apples like many suggested. These are moist and delicious. I made 24 mini cupcakes and 12 regular size. I baked the minis for about 14 minutes, they looked slightly over cooked, but don't taste like it. I baked the regulars for 20 min. and they also look overdone. I added a tad extra flour because I live at an elevation of 6500'.

These were good.  A cross between a cupcake and a muffin.  I made them twice - first time as written, I wasn't that impressed with them so the second time I made with the following changes - I subbed 1/4 cup wholemeal flour, used 4 tbsp of veg oil topped up with apple sauce instead of the required amount of shortening, used lowfat vanilla yoghurt in place of buttermilk (I didn't have any - I used milk the first time and it didn't really work) only used 1 grated apple (because of the apple sauce) and added raisins.  I iced them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

Yum...yum...yum.  This recipe looked more like a muffin recipe to me, so I used 1/2 wheat flour and oil in place of the shortening.  They were so delicious.  I think I will add more fruit next time and reduce the oil.  I don't think it will change the quality of it at all.

I made these today with my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter.  This was a great recipe to use with a child's help.  The cupcakes are delicious and light in texture.  The banana flavor is not overwhelming, which is what I don't usually like about banana recipes.  I did chop the apple like others suggested and also left the peel on.  I could see trying this recipe with other fruit combinations and will keep it in my recipe book. If you are wondering why this is clasified as a cupcake and not a muffin, they are not as dense as a muffin.  I sure could see eating these for breakfast.  They do not need icing at all.

Yum, these muffins are amazing! I used butter instead of shortening and added about 80 gr of white chocolate but otherwise followed the recipe to a T and they just melt on the tongue; the exact right blend of fruit and spices. Just fed two to my flat mate and he said that they were better than those he buys every morning at Starbucks. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. I sliced the apples really thin length-wise, then cut them in half. I then layered the apples into paper muffin cups, surrounding them with the mixture on bottom and top. Turned out awesome!

Excellent recipe!  I made it into two small loaves though.  I also followed previous suggestions by using oil instead of shortening and I cut the apples into small chuncks.  My picky toddler loved it.

These are so good! I didn't have any buttermilk, so I mixed a teaspoon of lemon juice into the milk. I used one Granny Smith and one Gala apple, next time I'll use 2 Granny Smiths. I used 3 bananas and the cupcakes are so moist. I love these, and will be making them often.

These are great!  Here are my modifications: chopped the apples, did 1 cup flour and about a cup (2 packets) of organic apple cinnamon oatmeal, replaced shortening with cinnamon applesauce, used whole milk instead of buttermilk, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup to compensate for the sugar in the oatmeal and applesauce.  I also added 3 bananas since I was adding more apple flavor.  Much healthier with those changes but are still moist and delicious!  I'm sure the original recipe is great as well.  Topped with cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut.  My sister is taking these to work tomorrow and I'm sure they will be a hit!

Yum yum! I made these muffins with whole wheat flour, and substituted egg beaters, and then applesauce for the shortening to make it healthier. They were delicious! The wheat flour gave it a sort-of bran muffin taste, which I loved. I loved the mix of apple/banana for this! Try this recipe!

Oh my goodness!! These were too good!! I didn't even frost them and they were still fabulous, so I can imagine how good they would be with some!! I made no changes besides addin a touch more cinnamon. They are so light and fluffy and flavorfull. I set the timer for 24 minutes and I found that it was too long. I smelled when they were done and against my better judgement I let them go and they were a little darker than I wouldv'e liked but they were still, too good!!

Very easy to put together and tasted delicous.  DH always does my "rating" and he actually awoke from a sound sleep, smelling these at 1 am (I am a night owl..LOL) and had to have one.  Thanks for another keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly..except I used "cinnamon sugar" that I keep mixed all together for various desserts.

I made these cupcakes this afternoon for my 14 month old son, but my DH and I ended up eating half of them before he woke up from his morning nap!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use whole milk in place of the buttermilk.  I used 2 MacIntosh apples and the end result was a very moist delicious muffin, but the flavour of the apple was lost because I used 2 super ripe bananas.  The only other change I made was to to make these into mini-muffins (easier for tiny hands to grab!) and it worked out very well and made about 40 mini-muffins. It would have made more, but I filled the muffin cups to the top (I shouldn't have because they really rose).  Thanks for the great recipe, we will definitely make these again!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Although I rarely ever cook things exactly as they are.  I subbed 1 cup of Oat bran and 1 cup Whole Wheat flour instead of white flour.  I also put in 1 T of Flax seed and then subbed 1 T of flax seed and 3 T of water for one of the eggs.  I also put 1 T of vanilla instead of 1 t.  I used smart balance instead of shortening.  I am trying to move us in a vegetarian and heathier direction.  I did leave in the buttermilk.  The muffins were incredibly tasty and really moist.  My kids loved them even with all the healthy stuff.

Yum.  I was in search of a good recipe to use up the extra bananas I always manage to buy.  Something healthy for me and my toddler.  This is a keeper.  
I subbed 5T butter plus 1/3 C veg. oil for the shortening.
Reduced the sugar to  1/2 C sugar plus 1/2 C equivalent brown sugar splenda.  Traded the buttermilk in for a 4 oz. container of YoBaby yogurt (I have used both banana and apple flavored with success).  And instead of the real apples I toss in a 4 oz. cup of natural applesauce.  I always have the ingredients on hand so it's nice to whip these up when I have 30 minutes.  Don't let them burn!

Made for my son's first birthday and topped with cream cheese frosting. We froze the unfrosted leftover and had them for a breakfast treat. Will make again!

I halved the recipe and used butter in place of shortening - as shortening is hard to come by in some parts of the world. An apple, cored, peeled and shredded equaled about 1 cup for me (I used and "Elster" apple - it's red and tastes a bit like a Granny Smith apple) and I sprinkled a little bit of shredded coconut on half of the muffins just to see how it would turn out - The coconut-topped muffins toasted nicely - and taste heavenly :-) Overall, these cupcakes turned out great - I give it 5 stars - a keeper for my recipe box - will make again and again and again...

These are delicious and easy to make!! Slightly crispy top, moist underneath. My very finicky 5 year old scarfed up three of them, no frosting on them or anything. I will make again and add some bran for his breakfast. Thanks!!!

This was so good.  I made a cake instead of cupcakes and it turned out so moist and yummy.  I made it for my one year old's birthday cake.  She loved it too.  My step-mom even asked for the recipe!  Thanks!

Great recipe, just what I was looking for.  Nice and fluffly, not at all dense and oily tasting like some banana muffins.  I added some chopped walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I have made this recipe 3 times...each time craving a banana apple combo.  I was not really impressed any of the times.  The last time i made it i did sub. 1 c of wheat flour for one of the all purp. flour cups.  Also i topped it with cream cheese frosting which made it much better.

This really is the BEST banana muffin recipe I've found.  I've made banana muffins for over 15yrs now, and tried many recipes, but this is my families favorite.  I chopped the apples like other people mentioned, as well as adding raisins. Fabulous! Two Thumbs Up!

So yummy! I used 5 little macintosh apples and 1 ripe banana. I put the apple into a blender so the muffins had lots of flavour with little bits of apples instead of chunks. I sprinkled the muffins with 5 tbsp of sugar, 2 tbsp of flour, 1 tbsp butter adn a dash of cinnamon.

This is absolutely the best muffin I have ever made and my family proves that out since they disappear as quickly as I make them! Since I cannot have white sugar, I use Splenda and double the recipe to make 24 nice size muffins. I took the advice of others and chopped rather than shredded the apples which gives them a nice texture. Thanks Barbara!

This recipe is wonderful. I work in Activities  at Long Term Care facility, and the residents loved them. The only thing I would have done differently was add nuts. Also, they taste best after cooling a while. Even chilled they are great. The flavor really comes out once cooled. A very easy recipe to double if you need something for a bake sale.

Amazing. The flavor is incredible and these muffins turn out deliciously fluffy. I had a few minor modifications: I had a lot of ripe bananas and apples so I doubled the recipe. I reduced the sugar by about 1/4-1/3 cup (out of the doubled amount). I added a bit more cinnamon (mounded teaspoon). I did not have buttermilk so I substituted using sour cream + milk. I chopped the apples instead of grating, as others have said -- you definitely get more of an apple flavor this way. Baked for 375 for 20 minutes and I think it was just a bit overbaked. It could have been a little more moist on the inside-- next time I will probably either reduce the time by a couple of minutes or use 350, as others have mentioned. Overall, fabulous recipe, will DEFINITELY make again!!

The cupcake is so delicious and supermoist, the smell is so amaxing. I also made few adjustments , I use greek yogurt instead of buttermilk, unsalted butter , apple sauce, I also combined white and brown sugar, reduce the nutmeg and cinnamon powder to 1/4 tsp , added 1 tsp of baking powder and cheddar cheese cut into small cubes and hide it in the batter , my kids loves cheese and they prefer to have it in every cupcakes??

SUPER versatile! (Which I always deem as a sign of a strong recipe. After reading a bunch of the reviews (and not wanted a sweet cupcake--in fact, a muffin), I subbed the buttermilk for greek yogurt, put less than even half of the sugar (and used brown instead of white), grated the apples as instructed, subbed oil for shortening (because eww) and upped the spices a bit. At the last minute I became paranoid that it was too thin of a batter, and tossed in a handful of oats (also wanting to make my breakfast muffins a bit healthy), then it was too thick, so I threw in a splash of regular milk. Came out great! Lovely moist crumb and golden tops. However, it's kind of bland (I take fault of course, for my 800 substitutions). The sort of thing you send over to your parents or in laws . To remedy this, I dipped the tops in this cranberry jam-ish concoction I had laying around from another experiment right when they came out of the oven. This solved everything, and they are great, definitely a recipe I will put in my repertoire. I may double dip them later, depending on whether or not the flavor soaks in. Sorry to be one of those people who rates and reviews a completely different version of the original recipe, but I think it's worth it because it speaks to how sturdy of a recipe it is!

Made half the recipe, substituted shortening with sweet cream butter. it came out so good. I never thought that bananas and apples would pair so well in a muffin. My son loved making this with me, it was super easy.

Halved the recipe, using 1 banana and 1/2 an apple. Subbed 1/2 the flour for coarsely processed oats for a crispy-chewy outside and rather gooey middle. Nice and light! Also halved the sugar but could've reduced it even more, I think! I found the nutmeg a bit much.

Had to make healthy modifications to a recipe for a class, did 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat, used butter and Greek yogurt instead of shortening (very moist!!) and decided not to do a frosting just a little butter and sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg on top. Very very good would definitely make again

I'm trying out various cupcake recipes to make for my daughter's wedding. This recipe was a nice change from the chocolate filled cupcakes that we've tried. I used fresh ground nutmeg which gave these cupcakes a delicious, moist and nutty flavor. I've divided up the batch and put various add-ins in to test a variety of flavors including mini choc. chips, peanut butter chips and chopped peanuts. The recipe doesn't include an icing recipe but I think I'll try cream cheese or peanut butter.

They taste like banana muffins! We modified the recipe by adding lemon juice and regular milk and only baked them for 18 minutes and they turned out fantastic. They were moist and perfectly golden and delicious!

I made this exactly as written (apart from adding ingredients in the wrong order a little...whoops) and it turned out great. I had noticed that someone said theirs caught a little the first time, so I checked them at 18 minutes, and they were done perfectly.  My dad and I love them! The house smells amazing and they taste fantastic!

I went with the advice of Naples 34102, and shredded the apples. Really liked the muffins!

These muffins are absolutely delicious.  I made the recipe as indicated with only one change.  After I put the batter in the muffin cups I sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  This gave it a really good taste.  My husband loved the muffins.  I will definitely be making these again!!

These are wonderful! I made 19 cupcakes/muffins from the batch and topped them with the brown sugar cream cheese icing(on this site).  I did dice the apples and used half butter/veg oil instead of shortening. Didnt have buttermilk so i used 4 tsp of apple pie greek yogurt. I also omitted the spices and used pumpkin pie spice instead. Turned out moist and delicious! The entire batch was gone in a half hour in the ER. Thanks for the recipe, i will be making it again.

I omit the apple and nutmeg and add a little extra bannana. I also add a caramel center after baking and pair with a bannana cream cheese frosting. Super delicious!

This recipe/dish was fantastic and went very quickly!!!  Everyone (family and/or friends) enjoyed this awesome dessert – the only complaint was that no one could get seconds.   I allow for seconds after I have cooked the dish for a first time.  That being said there will definitely be a next time as this dish dessert is going into the family’s meal rotation.

I have to admit, these taste more like muffins than cupcakes, but they are simply delish! But I had to make a few healthy changes. Instead of two cups of flour, I did 1 cup of blended rolled oats and only 1 cup of flour. I also added a little more banana. WARNING: do NOT use to much banana. It will  make your batter to liquidy and it will take to long to bake.

Made these on 03/31/2017 for my coworkers. I used my electric food chopper to mince the apples into small chunks. I used a mix of Granny Smith and a local sweeter apple. They turned out wonderfully, not too sweet with a really nice texture. Since I wanted them to come across more like a cupcake, I used a caramel frosting for half of them. The other half I sprinkled with brown sugar halfway through baking and again right after they came out of the oven. Everyone loved them (including my picky husband, who ate multiple cupcakes in one sitting). Will definitely make these again.

These are very easy and dangerously good. The only change we made was using half whole wheat pastry flour. You could easily cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup. We used *very* ripe bananas that had been frozen and didn't even have to mash them. Since we want these for breakfasts, next time we'll  use all  WW pastry flour,  use 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup shortening, and 1/3 cup buttermilk. And there will be plenty of next times!

These turned out fantastic! Very moist. How I varied the recipe based on the reviews:
I used the one cup banana. I used three apples, two envy and one Granny Smith, and I did shred them.  I substituted butter for shortening.  I made the buttermilk, as I did not have any on hand, with milk and white vinegar. Reduced the nutmeg by half. As I did not intend to frost these, I filled my paper cups full and sprinkled a little sugar on top. They cooked in exactly 20 minutes. Yield was 18.

I absolutely loved this cake!! I did make a couple changes: I used 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter instead of shortening and used 2% milk instead of buttermilk (all I had on hand). Mine definitely were done by 18 minutes so keep an eye on the cook time. I topped them with a honey buttercream and they were delicious!! I do recommend keeping the apples in small chunks instead of chopping super fine. Great recipe that I will be making over and over again!

I made the single recipe first, but it lasted less than 24 hours! I wouldn't make less than a double batch again.  I made mini-loafs, Texas-sized muffins and cupcake sized muffins. I like the apples chopped, but I do have friends that prefer them shredded. I added a tsp. of baking powder and upped the amount of bananas and apples. I replaced half the shortening with applesauce, and viola! Absolutely will make again.

This was amazing! I didn't have shortening, so I used room temperature butter. I also didn't have muffin tins, so I made this in loaf pans. I doubled the recipe, making four loaves. They were all gone in a day and a half! It was the moistest cake I've ever made.

Delicious! Followed the recipe almost to the T, which I don't usually do. Very thankful I did, they were moist and flavorful. More banana flavor than apple, but that was okay with me. I added cream cheese frosting to them and it made it even better. Will make again for others!

The cupcakes tribes out to be very delicious and my hubby loved them. As I read the reviews, I also only chopped apples and oh boy they were yummy. I used homemade buttermilk and used butter instead of shortening. The cupcakes were a bit crunchy from the top and velvety in the middle.

So I used 3 bananas and two small apples (forget the type). Next time I'd maybe add one more apple depending on the size. I loved the measurements on the recipe...came out very moist. Only difference I made was instead of buttermilk, which I didn't have, I just used 2%. Now where I went probably wrong was I just eyeballed and mixed until it had the consistency that I liked. Overall I would make this recipe again and again. I used a cream cheese frosting which made all the difference. (2c confectioner sugar, 1/2 stick butter, vanilla, and 12 oz cream cheese) Definitely think you could use this recipe and turn it into so many different things.

I disagree with adding the mashed banana last. I ended up with swirls of banana and cake batter instead of banana incorporated into the batter. I wasn't impressed with the flavor. I used shredded Golden Delicious apple and I couldn't taste the apple at all although it did add an undesirable lumpiness to the finished product. The cake definitely needs frosting, these aren't sweet enough to stand on their own. I used the basic cream cheese frosting from this site, and it turned out decent. I was planning to take these to work but I don't think they're good enough to share.

I made this recipe with my class and they loved it. the kids range in ages of two to six.  They love the chopping, the measuring and using the electric mixer.   Unfortunately, or fortunately I didn't have the spices on hand but did have pumpkin spice and used a teaspoon of that.  they turned out soft and moist.   Kiddos had them for snack and the rest are going home to the parents.  thank you.

Very moist and tasty, with a great texture. We used honey instead of sugar and doubled the apples. Made 12 cupcakes and one loaf of bread. The nutmeg is a little strong, might cut that back next time.

These are delicious. I halved the recipe and made it as written except i used coconut milk, i forgot to add the lemon juice to make it into buttermilk, but i don`t think that had any effect on the taste.
I added nothing to the top, but to me it was more muffin then cupcake. The flavors are very nice, and will make these again. Thank you Barbara for this recipe..

A really lovely flavor.  I live abroad and could not get everything noted, so had to substitute oil for shortening (and used plain yogurt for the buttermilk).  Because of personal preference, I upped the cinnamon and reduced the nutmeg.  I shredded the apples (wish the amount of apples was stated in cups, as apples vary so much in size). I was worried that the banana would overpower, but it did not. They were not pretty muffins, but tasted great.  Please note: Halving the recipe gave me only 10 modest size muffins.

EXCELLENT RECIPE:) Made these twice,first time as written ( perfect). The second I only had one small ripe banana,so I added about 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries,slightly thawed............ Came out excellent. Doesn't need frosting,they are yummy without. Thanks for the great recipe:):)

they were the best...I did change the sugar ... I used 1/2c splenda and 1/2c brown sugar. and used oil and not shortening. we didn't even frost them. they were moist, and had a great flavor. ty will make them often.

Followed some of the suggestions and used oil in place of shortening. I decided to chop the apples because it seemed easier and it turned out fine. Next time i will add less sugar.

We had a ton of apples from our yard so I've been making apple whatever to use them up.  Since our apples are a little on the tart side,  I increased the sugar by a half cup.  I chopped the apples into small chunks instead of shredding.  I also used more apple.  This did help with the apple flavor.  Great recipe!

Followed recipe exactly and cooked muffins for only 16 minutes. BURNED
I think 375 is too hot for this recipe.  I will try next time at 350 or even 325. Bottoms were burned and cake was not quite done

These taste like banana muffins with a twist. I substituted canola oil for the shortening to make them healthier.

Easy, stood up to my substitutions, kid-friendly taste. I subbed in 1/4c 2% milk with squeeze of lemon juice for buttermilk and vegetable oil for shortening.  I made a pan of mini-cupcakes and 18 regular sized.  They're fluffy and delicious and took barely any time to prep and bake.  Will make again.

I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars only because I had to add a couple of things.  I took some of the other's advice and used a cinnamon streusel topping, I used about  1 1/2 c of mashed bananas, and doubled the cinnamon to 1 tsp.. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used fat-free half and half instead.  Came out super moist and flavorful!  Will be adding to my Recipe Box.  Thanks for recipe.

I substituted the shortening with applesauce, omitted the buttermilk, used half white/half whole wheat flour and doubled the banana. They turned out more like muffins but were freaking awesome! Definitely going to make again.

I made this recipe for a party I was hosting this past weekend.  I had to modify it quite a bit, so that all of my guests could enjoy it. (Some are on the South Beach Diet). After all my modifications, it still came out quite good. I would lean towards it being more of a muffin though.  Fill your cupcake pans to 3/4 full or a tad more if you plan on icing your cupcakes. They don't really rise too much.  Very moist, and taste great. I would make this again!

So yummy!  I substiuted canola oil for the shortening and forgot to get buttermilk at the store, so used skim milk instead - and they still turned out great!  Frosted them with "Brown Sugar and Cream Cheese Frosting" I found on allrecipes that someone else had suggested - SOOOO DELICIOUS!

These are really good!!  This was my first time making them, so I followed the recipe, with the exception of chopping vs. shredding the apples (only b/c it's easier for me by hand).  Delicious!!  Next time I'll try subbing yogurt for shortening, br. sugar for white and half wheat flour.

These are more like muffins to me.  The first time I made the recipe exactly as is and it was great.  The next time I took half of the apples and grated them and the other half I cut into 1/4 inch size chunks.  I really enjoyed biting into little pieces of apple when they were done.  These also freeze well.

I just made these muffins.  They are GREAT!  I tossed the mashed bananas in after the eggs without thinking.  It worked fine that way.  I also had to finely chop my apples because, I don't have a decent grater.  I am going to have to hide these if they are going to last until tomorrow's Mother's Day brunch.  Great recipe!!

Followed the recipe exactly, just substituted with canola oil for shortening and these were delicious! Any kind of frosting would probably just take away from the flavor I think. They didn't rise as much as I would have liked though...maybe because I only filled muffin cups half-way as stated in the recipe. Will go upto 3/4 full next time. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I made these to "celebrate" Earth Day. I didn't tweak the recipe at all. I grated the nutmeg fresh. Didn't serve them with frosting. They were delicious, as they were! Thanks for sharing! My whole family really liked them!

I made these exactly as written and enjoyed the result.  I liked how they were not as dense as cupcakes/muffins usually are.  However, they tasted best fresh out of the oven; the following day they weren't nearly as good.

I followed directions with 2 exceptions.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (couldn't tell) and I also diced the apples after reading other comments.  These were absolutely flavorful and easy to make.  Amazing!

This cake (I made it a cake) is perfect - moist, spicy, and flavorful! Excellent recipe. I made a few minor adjustments by using all applesauce in replace of shortening and only a touch of canola oil, reducing the sugar by half, and adding some extra spices to custom suit it to my palate! Using the applesauce and NO shortening worked really well. I made it into two rectangle cakes stacked and separated the layers with cream cheese icing. Wow, we all have a new favorite dessert!

These were excellent.  I also took the advice of others and shredded the apple.  They were moist and delicious.

My mom and dad really like these.  I added chopped pecans for a little extra flavor and crunch.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted milk with lemon juice ( 1/4 tsp. lemon juice plus enough milk to equal 1/4 cup.  Let stand five minutes.).  It worked great!

Great way to use up old bananas and apples. I used 5 very ripe, small bananas and 2 old apples. Omitted the eggs without any problem. Also substituted shortening with canola oil (used 1/3 cup + 1/6 cup) and buttermilk with sour milk. To make 1/4 cup sour milk, add enough milk to 3/4 tsp of vinegar to measure 1/4 cup in total. Quite sweet, so I found it did not need toppings or frosting. Yummy!!

These were absolutely delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and chopped the apples, instead of shredding them. The small chunks of apples were really great. I also used whole wheat flour and added about half a cup of raisins and 2&1/2 tablespoons of wheat germ. They came out moist and very hearty. We'll definitely be using this recipe a lot. Thanks Barbara!

I served these plain and with a little icing (very tasty both ways), and I think they also would be good with a streusel topping.  The only change I made was to substitute 1/3 c. Canola oil and 1/3 c. applesauce in place of the 2/3 c. shortening.

What a wonderful yet unique, recipe!  I had a few bananas that were extremely, overly ripe.. and I have a hard time eating apples because I don't crave them - so...  this recipe was exactly what I needed to get a fruit boost in "cake" form. :)  With a few substitutions, this recipe became healthier and still tasted fabulous.  I used one cup whole wheat flour and one cup all-purpose.  I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup canola oil (instead of shortening).  And, I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Next time, I may try to sub the oil with unsweetened applesauce, for an even healthier treat! :)  I lined the muffin pan with cupcake liners that I spritzed a little bit of oil in (which probably isn't necessary).. and I baked for 17 minutes.  I think my oven gets hotter than it says, so that's why I went for 17 minutes. :)  The texture is great.  Very, VERY moist and soft, and a true delight!  I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips with a a tiny sliver of butter.. and drizzled over the cupcakes (which I should say, are more muffin-y than cupcake-y). :) If you have the ingredients on hand, definitely give it a try!  Thank you for the recipe, Tricia!

They were pretty good muffins. I substituted applesauce for the shortening, chopped the apples instead of shredding them, and I only had one banana, so I threw in a few handfuls of blueberries.  I also skipped the buttermilk.  I would try this again, but with 1 more banana and maybe some soymilk to keep in the moistness of the muffins. Thanks Barbara!

I thought these were pretty good. I followed the ingredients exactly and the only thing I did differently was to finely chop the apples instead of shredding. I didn't frost them but have been spreading low-fat cream cheese on them when I eat them for breakfast and that is quite yummy. I have been storing them in a covered container and a few days after making they are extrememly moist which  makes it difficult to put the cream cheese on but the flavor is still good.

These disappeared so fast I hardly got a chance to taste one! They weren't too sweet for my picky almost-three-year-old, and my skeptical husband (not a fan of too much banana) devoured them.  Great balance of apple and banana.  Thanks for the instant-hit recipe!

For me, these were just ok. They tasted good but not great and didn't look very nice. I filled the muffin cups to about 2/3 or 3/4 full and I still got very small muffins, that weren't nice and plump and round. And lets face it - these aren't cupcakes. I did chop the apple as other recommended but honestly, I could see it being good shredded also. With so many good recipes out there, I'm not planning on making this one again.

Very good and moist.  I used two apples and one banana and put the whole thing into a 9" and 4" cake pans.  I finely chopped my apples but the pieces were still too big, the kids could see them and wouldn't touch it.  Next time I'll follow the recipe and grate the apples so they get hidden in the mix. My husband loves it with frosting I prefer it plain for breakfast.  I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg because we like spice but I'm sure its still great with the normal amount.

Love this recipe, have never liked my own muffins as much!  I substituted 1.5 sticks of butter for the shortening though and used 3 small apples and 2.5 bananas (half of one fell on the floor!) I also used a crumb(ish) topping... Great!!!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted the shortening with vegetable oil and I diced 2 apples rather than shredding them for more apple flavor. It definitely helped otherwise you wouldn't really taste it so much. I used two 12-muffin muffin pans. One pan was slightly burned and the other one was fine, reason being, I did not grease one of the pans enough. Please note to grease the bottom of muffin cups well or else they will definitely burn!

Definitely muffins in my book, but delicious ones! I used Smart Balance instead of shortening and whole wheat flour instead of white. I also subbed some brown sugar for white sugar, since this recipe really seemed like it should be in there! These are really good. I am glad I got the baking bug tonight!

I love, love, love this recipe and so does my family.  I do however make a few changes.  I use half the sugar, half the oil and add applesauce!!!  Sometimes I add raisins, shredded carrots, or zuchini.  I add on or all of them to give my two year old an extra serving of fruits and/or veggies.  I have also melted a couple of dark chocolate squares and gave them a little chocolate flavor!!!  All the children and mommies in my sons playgroup rave about these...I will continue to repeat this one!!!

My family absolutely loves this recipe! We made no changes to the basic recipe but we frost them with a penuche frosting from an old Betty Crocker cookbook. Excellent and a hit with everyone who has tried them. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a muffin recipe, which isn't quite what I was looking for but it was very tasty. Nice and moist. I liked the flavor combination. Kind of boring, though. I didn't frost these after I tried them because it didn't taste like cake to me. It tasted like banana bread with a twist of apple.

This recipe actually worked really well.  They had rave reviews with the family.  I didn't have bananas but they were still good.  I made some changes to the recipe...I used whole wheat flour, canola oil instead of shortening, extra cinnamon and reduced fat milk instead of cream.

these cupcakes/muffins are AWESOME!!! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and wholemeal flour instead of white and dried apple instead of fresh but only because this is what I had on hand. Seriously, these are so so good. I used 4 bananas... yuuuum. These are going to go so quickly.

I followed other Reviewers advice and made cut the apples into small chunks rather than shred.  I really liked it this way.  I didn't mash the banana's completely either so there was small banana chunks in it as well.  My Husband is not the biggest apple fan and he really liked these.  I also wanted to note these were definately more of a Muffin, I see nothing "cupcake" about these.

Yum!  I soaked some cranberries in hot orange juice and added them.  Also finely chopped the apples instead of grating.  Used butter and oil instead of shortening.  Turned out great.  Going to try a lemon glaze next time.

I did not like these at all. I was very surprised that these have such good reviews.

I like the idea of the apple/banana combo, but the shortening made these taste awful!
Nobody ate them, and  everyone who was at my house at the time  love cupcakes. Even my dad who usually eats 4 or 5 portions worth of anything sweet only had 1 of these cupcakes.
I will try another variation of these cupcakes, but without the shortening.

I'm giving this particular recipe a big thumbs down.

Make your own cream cheese instead of store bought.  I suggest the Cream Cheese II recipe.

These muffins were great! Next time I will chop the apples instead of shredding them. I did not peel them. I used applesauce instead of shortening. And I substituted 1 cup oats instead of 1 cup flour. They were so good!

these were good.  for some reason my brother didn't like them, but i thought they were really yummy.  i did put in some applesauce instead of shortening, and cut back on the sugar a tiny bit.  i think that white chocolate chips would make a wonderful addition.

More like muffins than cupcakes but who cares. I used dried bananas boiled in water for 5 minutes, first time I have had to do this. Bananas in Australia at the moment are incredibly expensive. The apple/banana combo kept the cost down and the taste was just beautiful. Will make again & again.

Yummy! Very moist and tasty. I subtracted a little of the sugar to compensate for the cream cheese frosting I added.  Also great with walnuts!

I halved the recipe and made 12 small muffins that disappeared as soon as they made it past the oven door!  It was yummy!

Yum! I grated the apple 'cause I didn't want a strong apple taste, just the moistness that comes from the apple. Also, I didn't realize before I started that I was out of nutmeg, so I just left it out. It still turned out great. I bet it's even better with the nutmeg.

These were nice and moist, but I think the bananas I used were too ripe because the flavor was overwhelming.  Otherwise, they were good.  :)

I was disappointed in this recipe.The cupcakes tasted like banana muffins...I couldn't taste any apple flavour at all.Maybe my apples were to small.The texture was good and they were moist just not enough flavour for me.

This recipe was very tasty.  I used granny smiths.  Make sure to use VERY ripe bananas to enhance
flavor.  Vanilla frosting makes this recipe complete.
