Made this Christmas Eve 2002 and everyone loved it!  Was even good for breakfast the next day, similar to quiche.

I made this tart in a glass pie plate for a potluck lunch. Finding creme fraiche in the deli cheese case was lucky. The parmesan crust, mushrooms, ham and artichoke hearts made it special. Since I've had several requests for the recipe, I'd say it was a big success.

Very good! I followed the directions exactly, which is pretty admirable considering all the steps with the crust (it's awesome, btw), and added shredded parmesan to the top of this. I used a 10-inch springform pan because I don't have a pop-bottom quiche pan and it worked fine. The cooking time for the actual quiche was a little over for me. I had to stop mine at about 25 minutes, but it may have been due to the pan I used. Anyhow, great recipe - thanks!

Excellent tart or quiche. Needed something different for Thanksgiving, it was a hit. I didn't change any of the ingredients.

It was just like a breakfast quiche.  I made it as an appetizer for a family dinner, and we liked it.  It's not so great that we raved about it or I can't wait to make it again.  Maybe I might add a twist of some kind.  The loose bottom pan is a trouble though....I poured the egg mixture and veggies, put the tart in the oven, and I immediately heard and smelled dripping and burning.  Some of the liquid went right through the bottom of the pan.  Was I supposed to put the pan on a cookie sheet?  Dripping stopped within a few minutes, but I nearly set off the fire alarm and woke up my husband!

It's a good quiche; not the best recipe I've ever tried.  The dough sure uses a lot of butter!  Also, I substituted broccoli for the mushroom and artichoke (I love them, but hubby won't eat them).  Thanks!
