Delicious...if you aren't partial to escargot, I would recommend replacing with either clams or oysters, shrimp, or scallops....as a matter of fact, if you aren't partial to any one of the ingredients, this is the kind of dish that you can alter to fit your fancy!

I have always made the escargot with the shells and garlic butter.  I tried this one for a change, but do prefer my original. I found that I wanted the garlic butter for dipping and the puff pastry absorbed all of the butter.  I did like the crispness of the pastry, but prefer the "old way".  Just a matter of taste.

I personally do not like escargot, but my hubby and some of his friends do.  So, I made this for a dinner party.  They said that this is the best escargot that they have ever had.

I grew up eating these, they're popular in England.  I use the Pillsbury shells that come 6 to a pack then I just make a basic white sauce adding whatever sounds good...ham and swiss is good or instead of ham you can put crab, chicken...pretty much anything you want!  I also make them with a mushroom sauce just using a basic white sauce recipe also. Thank you for posting this, I didn't know anyone in America had heard of these!

I made this for Valentines day dinner and it was fantastic.  I didn't have the puff pastry shells so I rolled out regular puff pastry then wrapped it around the escargots and mushroom etc.  I had to cook it a little longer than stated.  closer to 15-17 mins and still the dough inside wasn't cooked as well as I had liked......

The only thing I changed was to use a shallot instead of a green onion because I didn't have any.  I found that with the shallot there was too much onion, but that's on me.  Next time, I'll follow the recipe exactly, but with more butter.  It was really good!

What I was looking for - I used shallots rather than green onions and brandy rather than white wine also added a pinch of allspice. We both enjoy escargot and this was the perfect starter for a Valentine dinner. Thank You Sally
