The correct Norwegian spelling is Lefse not Lefsa.  Lef-sa is how it may look phonetically.

My Whole family LOVES lefsa!  The kids like it with butter & sugar (brown or white) or cinnamin & sugar, then they roll it up.  It goes fast! My Husband's Grandmother makes this & every time we go out to visit her we bring back bunches of it.  It stores very well in the freezer for even a year.  She says it is very time consuming & you need a big nonstick frying pan or maybe a wok.  She bought a special lefsa pan online though.

I've made this recipe using leftover mashed potatoes.  Mix everything while the potatoes are hot to mix easier, then I fridge it overnight.  I omitted the cream and used milk and butter.  It worked just fine.

The lefsa was great however it made WAY too much!!!!  I made it for a party and had tons of leftovers.  This makes enough for about 18-20.  Other than that it was delicious and everyone loved it!  We sprinkled with butter cinnamon and sugar.

This is exactly how my grandfather made lefse, I used to love watching him in action!  BTW to the reviewer that thought it might be a good idea to try garlic mashed potatoes or red potatoes:  No, please.

I love Lefsa, and can not find it in southern California.  It might be interesting to use garlic mashed potatoes, because garlic is a natural preservative which might add shelf or refrigerator life. Also it my might be interesting to try red potatoes also.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  I haven't made it yet but I'm sure it will be great.  I also had lefsa when I was little.  They sell it here in upper Michigan, but I think it is too thick.  I bought some and tried it with cinnamon and sugar but it wasn't like I remembered.  I will have to try it again with my own lefsa and roll them out thin.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love and was also raised on Lefsa!  I've been making it for my kids for a few years now and butter with brown sugar is our favourite.  Just wanted to thank you for the keep your dough balls cooled to prevent sticking.  Happy Lefsa making everyone!

Some helpful hints for this recipe:  Melt the butter in the microwave, add the cream (or milk) and when heated, add the sugar and salt (which can be reduced to half a tablespoon) to this mixture, then to the mashed potatoes.  I find it easier to make long rolls of the dough (about 1 1/2 in. in diameter if using a griddle). Cut off slices about a half inch thick.  This method is faster and makes them easier to roll out. It's also important to stack the baked lefses between dishtowels to keep them soft.  We love these and they are a must for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!

These turned out delicious!! The only change I made was substituting milk for the whipping cream to cut some of the calories. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I make Lefse every year and this was the best batch by far.  I followed the recipe exactly, but after I take my lefse off the grill I actually stack the pieces between damp flour sack towels, after they are moist I stack them, put them in a zip lock bag and freeze them.  They only take around 20 minutes to thaw and turn out perfect!

These were a pain in the butt to make, but worth it. Haven't had these since I was little and had to make them for my family that has never heard of them. I'll make again, second time will be easier I'm sure.

They were good.  I grilled them like the recipe said, but the grill marks were dark.  Maybe I should have cooked on a lower heat bc the sugar in the lefsa smelled and tasted burnt.  I would probably try again without the sugar.

Traditional Lefse recipe.  I have made these for 40 years.  My mother before me and my grandmother before that who came from Norway.  I make mine on my pancake griddle turned to the highest heat should be about 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  they only take a minute or so on each side.  When you roll them out, roll them very thin.  You can use lots of flour as it can be brushed off after.  These freeze very well.  I make at Christmas time and then have for all the special occasions until the next Christmas..

I grew up eating Lefse even though not Norwegian.  My mom used leftover mashed potatoes and cooked them on the griddle our stove had.  We used the Lefse to wrap up leftover turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce sort of like a Burrito! We never had it with butter and sugar and I will have to try that next time although they disappear so fast we don't really need another way to use them.

Have made this version for years just as written, never had a problem. BTW 8 cup of potatoes is approx 5 lbs. I always do up 10 lbs of potatoes because people are always wanting to take some home.

It's pretty close to Moms recipe. We use a ricer for the potatoes, better chances of no lumps. We  make it in November so we can just put the rices potatos outside on the deck to cool. The best grill to use is a lefsa grill. Mom found it heated the best, the everyday grills weren't hot enough. In our family we only use butter and roll it up. (I sneakily dip it in my gravy)
