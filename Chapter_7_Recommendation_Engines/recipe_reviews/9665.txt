I was worried about trying these cookies after reading the review, but these turned out great for me!  I was careful in adding the flour, but did add it all and had no trouble rolling them out.  The filling was great too!  I used 8oz of dates and had plenty for the cookies.  Yummy!!

Either the recipe is incomplete or something is wrong. I wasted a batch of I dont know what. The " dough" didn't turn into a dough. It was just a dry crumbly mixture. I had to throw it away.
