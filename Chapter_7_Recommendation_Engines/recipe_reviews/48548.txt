We loved this dish!  I tweeked the preparation a bit, starting with only two tablespoons of butter, and added about one tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  I then added my cajun spice seasoned shimp, sauted for a minute, then the onions and garlic.  I added the wine, allowed for a few minutes to cook off the alcohol, and added a can of diced tomatoes, pasta, and spinach.  More cajun seasoning, and viola!  a smashing dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this dish.  The seasonings, 1-1/2 tsp. Louisiana Cajun seasoning and 1 tsp. black pepper were perfect.  I did, however, make a few simple changes to suit our diet and my ease of preparation.

Campanelle for the Orecchiette, I couldn't find the Orecchiette, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp. olive oil, a 14 oz. can of Hunt's diced tomatoes, drained, and a 1 lb. bag of frozen, all-ready cooked, shelled, and deveined shrimp.

I think next time I make it, I will add 2 - 3 cups of spinach.  I really liked it and more would have been nice.

The sauce is very light and thin, but oh-so flavorful and we liked it that way, especially with the warmer summer weather.  I will definitely be making this again very soon.

While I thought this was tasty enough, Hubs enjoyed this a lot more than I did.  For me, I would have liked this much better leaving out the Cajun seasoning altogether!  I did prepare this a little differently - I coated the shrimp in olive oil and rubbed them with Cajun seasoning (just to my liking, didn't measure).  I had them set awhile until I was ready to have Hubs throw them on the charcoal grill.  Meantime, I prepared the pasta and sauce, of course without the shrimp and Cajun seasoning.   Hubs and I are not big eaters, but I found scaling this recipe to three servings was barely enough pasta for the two of us, so please keep that in mind!  I found I had to add more of the spinach as well - except I used baby arugula, since that's what I had in the fridge.   I piled the pasta (again, wonderful as is, without the seasoning!) into big, individual pasta bowls,  then topped it with the grilled shrimp.  For those having trouble locating the orecchiette (they're so darned cute!), you'll find it wherever the DeCecco brand of pasta is sold.

Loved this!  I only used 2t cajun spice and 1t pepper, and our lips are still burning.  Soooo good.  I added 1c of fresh sliced mushrooms with the shallot/onions/garlic.  And I used defrosted cooked shrimp (adding them right at the end to warm through).  I will definitely make this dish again!

I keep trying shrimp pasta recipes and finally THIS one turned out! I used canned tomatoes cuz that's all I had and added a couple spoons of tomato paste to thicken it up. I used frozed cooked shrimp and it was soooo good! I used Emeril's BAM seasoning instead of cajun. Not too spicy that way. My 2 year old ate it! Use the right pasta it calls for, too. They really soak up the sauce and have a great texture. This is in my top 10! I also doubled the spinach and garlic and green onion.

This dish was outstanding!  I modified it just a bit by doing what the last reviewer mentioned:  I cooked the pasta (used a different pasta as I couldn't find Orecchiette in the store), then set aside.  Then I used a lot less butter (probably 1 1/2 TB) and 1 TB olive oil in the pan.  I added the shrimp and cajun (used a full 1 1/2 teaspoons)and sauted for 1 minute.  Then i added the onions and garlic and sauted for a few more minutes.  Finally i added the canned tomatoes (drained first), then white wine and spinach (increased to 2 - 3 cups of spinach), and pasta.  COoked covered for 6 minutes or so and then i was done.  I actually forgot the black pepper, but there was plenty of spiciness and it wasn't missed.  served it to my fiance and mom with crusty garlic bread and salad and it was a winner!  Very spicy but not insanely so.  For people who love spicy food this is perfect!  For people who are more sensitive to spice, just reduce cajun seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon.  Yum!!!

My family really liked this recipe. I could not find the pasta listed in the recipe so I subbed with tri-color fiori. I added  a splash of EVOO, minced vidalia in place of shallots,  and added about 1/4 cup freshly grated asiago and parmesan cheese just before serving. I'm not a seafood fan, so I saved a small amount of pasta and tossed with grilled chicken.

Orecchiette are a distinctive Puglian type of pasta shaped roughly like small ears, hence the name (orecchio, ear, orecchiette, little ears). They're about 3/4 of an inch across, slightly domed, and their centers are thinner than their rims, a characteristic that gives them an interestingly variable texture, soft in the middle and somewhat more chewy outside. 
I cut down on the spice alot in this recipe, too. The family is not real keen on spicey.

I used 1 1/2 TEASPOONS Cajun spice and 1 teaspoon of black pepper, allowed the sauce to reduce, and served over rice. I felt like a superstar chef. My husband, who is a professional chef, loved it. I will certainly make this again. It's so easy!

"2 cups" is a confusing measurement for pasta which is usually describing in weight.  I used a pound of pasta and there wasn't enough sauce.  I did successfully stretch it with chicken stock but would recommend either doubling sauce for one pound or  using 1/2 pound of pasta.  Otherwise, it was a  really good recipe.  I modified only slightly by cooking down the tomatoes and wine a bit before adding the shrimp.  That didn't help the volume but was great for the flavor.  nice recipe with minor modifications.  Thanks!

This is was amazing.  I read other reviews that suggested adding cream or cornstarch, but frankly that would ruin this dish.  This is not supposed to be a cream sauce or thick tomato sauce.  It makes a super tasty broth that should be ladled into bowls.  Pick up a loaf of crusty bread to sop up the juices and enjoy. Also, I forgot to mention that this is also quick and easy to prepare.  What more can you ask for?

This is a winner.  My changes were:  double spinach, 4 cloves garlic, 1/2 Tablespoon Cornstarch, 1/2 wine, 1/2 C shrimp stock from boiling shells, 2 1/2 teaspoons cajun seasoning and double tomatoes.  Absolutely Delicious!

From my "not wild about shrimp" husband, this dish is "good enough for company!" I doubled the cajun spice and used three large handfuls of baby spinach changed the 1/3 C butter to half butter and half EVOO and used chicken broth instead of the wine. . I will DEFINITELY be making this again & will also try it using chicken as someone else recommended. Thank you Dawn for submitting this great recipe!

This was delicious!! I didn't have shallots or green onions so I just substituted with white onion. I also had to make the cajun spice, which was relativey easy. My husband loved it and said that it is restaurant quality. The only problem was that I couldn't stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great as written. If ingredients aren't drained well enough a little tomato paste will thicken everything up.

One of our favorite recipes. I have no idea how people eat it with all of the spices, I always half the Cajun and pepper. And I can never feed 6 people with it either, more like 2-4.

Good flavor - sauce was way to thin for my preference.  If I hadn't already added the shrimp, I would have let it reduce more, but since the shrimp was in already it would have turned them rubbery.  I know better for next time!  Added mushrooms and a whole bag of spinach.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good combination.  Love the pasta choice!  I added mushrooms and red peppers, which I am thinking could have made the sauce a little too runny.  I just added some Wondra flour to fix that. Added some feta cheese to make it even more interesting.  Will definitely make again!

This was soooo good! I added a little old bay, lemon zest and cream to finish it off. I was worried since the sauce was so watery but it was perfect.

I thought this recipe was way too spicy!!!  And I only put in 1 TBLS of creole seasoning and pepper.  Next time I will only use a tsp. of both.  I followed others suggestions and added 2 TBLS of tomato paste and a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Except for the extreme heat, this dish was delicious.

This was excellent, the spinach and tomatoes really make the dish!  I used precooked frozen shrimp and it turned out great, but it took a liitle longer to cook.

My shrimp loving family greatly appreciated this dish. Used shell pasta. A little heat from the Cajun seasoning was a great change. Nice low cal pasta dish - it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

The only changes I made was 1 tbs butter, 1 tbs olive oil and defrosted chopped spinach. Both my DH and I thought this dish was "meh." Not bad, but not to be put on the list to make again. I feel sort of like I wasted 1 lb of shrimp and a cup of good wine.

This dish was really good. Both my husband and I enjoyed it. Next time I make I think I will add some additional spinach but overall was great.

Decent dish, but I agree with other reviewers about it being bland. I don't like a lot of spice usually, but this amount you could barely get a sense it was even there. I added more cajun seasoning plus a little salt, to taste, before I served it. I liked how quick it came together (after you're done with all the chopping), however, I would recommend playing around with the seasoning!

We love this recipe. We have a pescatarian friend who adores this. The great thing? Trader Joe's now carries orecchiette, which is definitely the best pasta to use - I've tried others

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  It was good, but I think the wine overpowered the dish.  I like cajun food and did not really taste the seasoning.  I think it needed more. I used a regular onion and added a package of mushrooms that I needed to use up.  I did not use the green onion and used cooked shrimp which I added only at the end.   Not really sure I will try this again.

I made this recipe just now; my immediate reaction is... underwhelmed. It sounded like a really good recipe with a cajun flair, but it sorta fizzled out for me.

The sauce has an aroma that promises endless flavor, but it leaves the palette a bit disappointed. The thin sauce can't really lend much help to the al dente pasta and the cajun heat I was hoping for really wasn't there. I used an Emeril recipe to make the cajun seasoning from scratch, so maybe that's where something went awry - I don't know.

It definitely isn't bad, I muddled it up a tiny bit by forgetting to peel the shrimp, but I don't think that changed much. I would suggest this for a light dinner with wine.

Thanks.  This had a lot of flavor and I will definitely make it again.  I used medium shells because I couldn't find orecchiette pasta.

Made this dish for my family.  This is now one of my husbands favorite dishes.  3 out of the 4 kids liked it, so that is a huge win!  I did what other commentor suggested and reduced butter to half and added olive oil.  I also doubled the spinach and added more cajun seasoning.  You just need your fresh baked bread and you are al set.

EXCELLENT! I subbed a can of drained diced tomatoes for the fresh, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil and the whole bag of baby spinach. I felt it was pretty watery, so I just thickened it up a little w/ a cornstarch and water slurry and it was perfect! Hubby raved over this. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love this! It's very flavorful and easy to make! I didn't add as much Cajun seasoning as it calls for because it seems like it would have made it to salty. This is delicious and light!

great pasta dish. i didn't have the pasta called for so i used corkscrew pasta. the only other change i made was to use chicken broth in place of the white wine. i used to much pasta but that was my fault! great recipe to use the bag of frozen shrimp and bag of baby spinach!

This was a pretty good recipe. The hardest thing about it is the prep time, because it took more like 30 minutes to chop everything up. I added more spinach and made it a tad bit hotter. All in all it was great!

I was expecting a lightly sauced pasta dish but I ended up having to eat this with a spoon as a soup.  I normally love dishes with these ingredients but I had it for leftovers today and it wasn't good.  Sorry.  Thanks anyways.

This recipe is delicious! I altered with two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes, 6 oz of fresh baby spinach, 3/4 cup white wine, 5 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup chopped green onions. I also added a couple small pinches of red pepper flakes. The sauce wasn't too thin and I thought it could have used more spice. Next time I will use 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp, 2 tsp of cajun seasoning and 10 oz of spinach (we love spinach in my house). I'm looking forward to having this again.

Based on other reviews and personal taste, I offer my humble opinion of this tasty dish. Sub'd butter to 2 tbsp EVOO and 2 tbsp butter. Increased Cajun spice, plum tomatoes by double. Omitted the cracked pepper. Tripled spinach and added 1/2 tbsp cornstarch at the same time as spinach. Also, couldn't find orecchiette at the regular grocery so served over linguine. Excellent! Thanks Dawn, for a nice Cajun twist on Scampi with veggies!

This recipe turned out great!  Made a few changes though because we like things a bit more spicy...made the recipe with 4 cloves of garlic and added more Cajun seasoning (2 tsp).  Also added some red pepper flakes.  I used a few more plum tomatoes to make more sauce so I had about 1.5 cups.  I used olive oil rather than butter too.  Highly recommend for a nice refreshing dinner.  Husband and husband's friend raved!!

Since I have a seafood allergy, I substituted chicken.  I cut the chicken into 1" pieces, browned them in the butter, removed them, then added the vegies.  I also added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  I thought it looked a little thin.  Got great raves in my house.  Will definitely do this again.

I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Quick and easy to toss together.  I would serve this at a dinner party as well.  Salad, a glass of white wine and some garlic bread -- is all it needs to round it out. My boyfriend took the leftovers to work and 2 people asked for the recipe.  Thanks - this ones a keeper!

This was very good and very easy!
At the suggestion of someone else here, I added about 2 tbs. of tomato paste, and my sauce wasn't runny at all.  I also cut way down on the butter, added a little olive oil, and used 1/2'd grape tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes.  
Will make again, and think I will add more spinach next time.

Outstanding!!!! The only addition I made was to add fresh basil and parsley because it was available in the herb garden. I also used frozen shrimp and it was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make many times.

Excellent!  I did cut down the black pepper a lot and it was perfect for me who likes spicy but not overbearing spicy.  Perfect with a loaf of baguette bread to soak up the juices, which I didn't have, but next will have for sure.  My husband enjoyed it too but he likes very spicy and added hot sauce to his dish.  But definitly a keeper.

This was great, but a little thin.  I added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and about 1/3 cup of alfredo to thicken it up a bit.  Very good flavor and a nice mix of ingredients.  WIth the extra ingredients, I give it 5 stars :)

I made this last night for my family.It was very good , but WAY too spicy!!I thought maybe the 1.5 Tbs. cajun seasoning should have been 1.5 teaspoons.I would advise to start with ALOT less and add  more to taste.We aren't wimps , but this was spicy!! Also, I couldn't find the orecchiette pasta so I used shells, which worked fine.Thanks for the recipe.Next time we'll try the milder version!!

Loved this! Of course, I changed a couple things. We added a chicken andouille sausage and mushrooms, We added a bit more seasoning. Perfect amount of garlic and shallots.

Tasty!  I took other users suggestions and added extra spinach and mushrooms.  I also added another teaspoon of cajun - it was just right.
Also, I only used a tablespoon of butter - that was plenty.  Next time, I think I will eliminate it completely and just use oil.

Love this recipe, but personally I double the shrimp, the wine and the spice. Also, its a lot better if its left on low for a couple of hours before eating it. I don't think it tastes great if you eat it right away, just decent. Spice and wine need time to bring the flavors out. Recipe is super easy though.

I used a Chardonnay for the wine and added sliced mushrooms and a pinch of crushed red peppers. Delish!

I followed this recipe exactly as written but my Cajun seasoning is called Joe's Stuff, from New Orleans. It gave the dish a rich, buttery taste to start. And we could add all the Joe's Stuff we liked to kick it up as many notches as we wanted!

This is a great recipe, my wife says I make the best cajun shrimp around. I did tweek the recipe a bit though. I went to medium to large shells instead of oricchette, as I could not get them little hats from sticking together. Besides the shells hold more of the juices. I also doubled the amount of garlic, cajun spices and even added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. WONDRFUL !!!!!!   Thank You Dawn !!!!!

Meh... It was okay. I doubled the spinach and the Cajun seasoning... Still pretty bland. The family ate it but asked me to scratch it off the menu.

Delicious! For those who end up with a "runny" sauce, you're not letting it simmer and reduce enough. And, if you cook your pasta al dente, then add to the shrimp/tomato mixture, the pasta will absorb the remaining liquid, to end with a glorious thick sauce, coating everything perfectly. I did add a tablespoon of tomato paste as well, after the addition of the wine/broth. Can't wait to eat leftovers tonight! FYI-I used Torchiette pasta and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe -- I only adjusted the hot spices down a little -- I love well seasoned, but not TOO hot, and doubled the spinach as one reviewer recommended.  I would not use precooked shrimp as another reviewer recommended -- they don't absorb the flavors as well, and can get rubbery.  Buy the raw frozen shrimp(easy peel or with only tails on).  It only takes minutes to defrost under running water and they're ready to cook.

Very nice.  I cut down on the cajun seasoning since I don't like too spicy, and left out the spinach and green onion since I didn't have either.  I also used a full can of diced tomatoes with the liquid and reduced the amount of wine by half--bf isnt' that fond of wine.  He liked this, though.  I found the orecchiette at Trader Joe's, so if you are having difficulty and have one in your area, you should be able to find it there.  We've never had orecchiette before, and they are pretty cute.  They stuck together--maybe I needed to stir better.  All in all, this was quite good and very easy.  I will probably make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious- the sauce was so good with a little kick to it.  The only thing different I did was put about 5 cloves in of garlic.  May make some garlic bread next time to dip in that delicious sauce!  Used frozen shrimp- came out great.

Tasted like something from a restaurant! I did double the tomatoes and added parm cheese when I served it... otherwise as the recipe stated. A little spicey- but DELISH! Try this recipe! Especially if you like cajun!

This was good but not great. I threw in some zucchini, used about 2 tbs+ of cajun seasoning, and added some crushed rep pepper flakes to spice it up.  I think the wine overpowered the dish, as others have mentioned.  I wouldn't say the sauce was bland, but there was something missing that I can't put my finger on.  Next time, I'll use half the measurement for wine and the other half chicken or veggie stock.  My husband thought it was amazing though.

Good base recipe but the sauce was a bit bland. I did cut back on the seasoning since I have little ones. Would like to have a sauce that is a bit more substantial.

I made some serious adjustments to this dish, but the base is a good one so I am giving this 5 stars.  For starters, I was hungry and had to use what I had on hand in the fridge.  I replaced the shrimp with a few chicken sausage links that I had and the green onion with a regular yellow onion.  I also did not have scallions, but I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much as stated.  The flavor on this was superb!  I also added a little feta cheese on the top at the end.  I would certainly make this again, super easy!

Wow, this was wonderful--so packed with flavor!  It had a bit too much black pepper for my taste, but still give it 5 stars.  If you don't like heat cut back on the black pepper and the Cajun seasoning.  You can always add more later.  Also, with the shallots, garlic and green onion this probably not a good "date night" recipe.

I followed this recipe step by step. I didn't officially have "Orecchiette" so I used shells. Overall my boyfriend really enjoyed this recipe. I thought it would be a bit more spicy but the amount listed is good for those who are spice sensitive (I'm giving it 4 stars because I was expecting more spice. Nonetheless this was tasty!). It was simple and quick to make and was very pretty to look at :)

My adult children LOVED this. Used regular spaghetti pasta. Definetly add more fresh spinach and depending on what kind of Cajun seasoning you use, add to taste. I needed more then what was called for. Added parmesean cheese and 1/4 cup of half and half at the end. My only contention with this recipe was the sauce was runny...would have loved it even more if the sauce was thicker.

This was good and went over well at a potluck the other night but the Cajun spice that I bought just didn't have any kick to it. I used 3tsp (doubled recipe) and couldn't taste it. I added 2 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of chili pepper to get it where I thought it should be. I couldn't find the orecchiette pasta so I used shells instead. I also used frozen shrimp that was thawed in cold water and added at the last. One more thing, add more of the spinach. I used a whole salad bag for a double batch.

Very good!  Fast and easy, a great weeknight dinner.  I added more spinach because we love it, and the amount listed didn't seem like quite enough.  Nice, spicy dish, just the way we like it!  I served it with parmesan cheese on top and a little lemon.  Thanks!

Too much pepper?  Here's whatcha do!  I should have listened to my instinct when it told me not to put the full amount of pepper in and to just begin with half that amount and taste it.  The pepper ended up overpowering every other flavor in the dish.  I saved the dish by making a cream sauce consisting of 2 tablespoons butter, 1/2 cup cream cheese, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp parsley.  I melted them all together, adding the milk slowly, until it was a nice, thick cream.  Then I reheated the pasta in the pan and stirred in the cream sauce.  Voila!  Another tip:  Definitely increase the spinach by about a cup.  I gave this recipe four stars despite the pepper problem because I should have known better to begin with.

LOVED this recipe! We do add some mushrooms and some red pepper flakes as well. We love it hot! This is a much healthier option for us over the Cajun Chicken Pasta on this site that is made with cream. It's very tasty and I love the fresh spinach in this dish. Fantastic!

The only change that I made was I used canned diced tomatoes, other than that, I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  It was wonderful!!  So easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

My boyfriend & I thougth this was very, very good. Althougth I made a couple small changes, I still gave it a 5 stars. I used 1 1/2 T butter & 1 T of olive oil when sauteing, used 1 can of Hunts petite diced tomatoes instead of plum, and added 2 T tomato paste to thicken. Very easy & had a great kick. I can understand why its too hot for some people but we love hot & spicy.

This is really good.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the cajun spice and pepper in half, but I shouldn't have.  It wasn't very spicy at all.  I'm from Texas, so maybe I'm just used to spice, but the recipe probably would have been perfect if I followed it exactly.

Excellent!  Not too spicy at all!(but...my cajun spice mix may be a bit stale)  Makes a wonderful sauce!  Plan to serve with lots of nice crusty bread (I sure wish I had!)  Very easy (once all the onion-slicing is done).

This was excellent!  I cut the amount of spices and wine in half and it was perfect.  Tasted very similar to a dish I had in an upscale restaurant very recently.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy recipe.  Way too spicy though.  We love spicy foods, always 5 stars at Thai restaurants but this was even to spicy for us.  Burned our mouths - but - the flavor was excellent.  I will definitely try this recipe again but I will cut the cajun seasoning and black pepper in half.

Loved the sauce next time I will just use a different pasta than orchetti . It was way too thick for thin sauce. Maybe angel hair pasta in future . But overall super yummy!

I added sun dried tomatoes and roasted asparagus to replace the spinach ( husband is not a fan)!  We liked the dish but the sauce was soupy and didn’t coat the pasta. I will make it again and will thicken the sauce with a rue or a little arrowroot.  The Riesling was a nice pairing.

I have made this a few times. I love it!  Quick and easy!  I have added mushrooms.  I also cut back on the butter.  I tend to add more tomatoes.  I would recommended adding shrimp later around the time of the pasta and spinach so they don’t over cook and become rubbery!

Delicious but a little spicy so I’ll use 1 tsp Cajun spice and 1/2 tsp pepper next time. I used fresh Cavatelli pasta, 4 tbl butter, 1 tbl olive oil,   4  Roma tomatoes and 6 oz spinach. Will use 6 tomatoes and more spinach in future. No green onions. I think any small pasta would be good.

Made this as directed, but it did not turn out as pictured. The flavor was good, but I was looking forward to a creamy pasta dish. However, this sauce was extremely watery. By the time I added the pasta and shrimp, it was too late to reduce the sauce. I would reduce it a lot and probably add some tomato paste, cornstarch, or cream next time.

We loved this dish but I made so many changes it may have really been a different dish, lol,  I used one yellow pepper instead of onion, crushed tomatoes instead of chopped, 2 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning, one cup chicken broth and a tablespoon of rice vinegar instead of wine.  I simmered the mixture for about 5 minuets after adding the tomatoes, broth and vinegar and then added the shrimp.  I omitted the spinach and tossed the mixture with spaghetti. Yum

I loved this recipe. I’m a lover of spice and this was pretty good. Not really spicy but the Cajun spice lingers after you have eaten it. I put an additional 1/2 tsp of chipotle chilli pepper and substituted the baby spinach with baby arugula and it was perfect for me.

I used 2 Tablespoons butter and 1 Tablepoon olive oil in the pan, as others suggested. I improvised by using 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, as I lacked fresh. Fresh basil from the garden added to the great taste of this recipe!

This recipe was ok.  I did use chicken instead of shrimp because my boyfriend isn't a fan of seafood. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. 
To me one of the best parts was the spinach. or would have definitely added more. 
I ended up adding more Cajun seasoning to my personal plate after tasting it originally because I thought it was pretty bland (but I like a lot of season).

But all in all it was just ok. I will eat the leftovers but probably won't make this again.

A good base recipe, but needed more oomph. I did add a bit of cream to the final product because it felt right. Would make again, but would put more something else into it. Maybe more onions, celery and green peppers like a true Cajun recipe. Or start with more of a roux to thicken it without cream. Not sure, but would be worth trying again...

This is excellent- I did take the advice of the other reviewer and I used 2 tblspoons of butter and 1 tblspoon of olive oil  and sauteed the shrimp in the cajun seasoning before adding the onion and garlic.  Then I added wine and tomatoes and then 3 times the spinach it calls for. I added a squeeze (or 2) of lime.  I also would use half the shrimp next time, but all in all it was a keeper!!

This was super yummy! I used fresh spinach, only 1tsp of Cajun seasoning and used a reisling for the wine. It turned out sweet but really good and not too spicy. Quick prep too. I will definitely make this again.

Overall, this was a good and easy dish to make.  I made very little changes to this recipe based on spice preferences.  First, I added more garlic and tomatoes.  I then checked taste throughout the cooking process and ended up adding lemon pepper to the mix.  I usually include this with most of my shrimp dishes.  I added more cajun spice at the end and used frozen spinach instead of fresh baby spinach.  Turned out great!  Simple and fast.

I modified the ingredients. I used 2 tablespoons of butter , 2 tablespoons of garlic oil, and 1 cup of cooking white wine. I used spaghetti, shrimp, canned diced Roma tomatoes, spinach, and 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning . Next time, I will try it with sun-dried tomatoes. Delish!

I've made this several times and has become one of my family's favorite.   The only thing I changed is doubling the amount of spinach maybe even more.

This recipe was super delicious!  I did make modifications.  I used a drained can of Rotel original tomatoes and green chilies because we like things spicy.  I increased the spices to taste and added about 3/4c of heavy cream at the end because we like a thicker, richer sauce!  This was better than what I could get at a 5 star restaurant!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was AMAZING! I I altered a few things. For instance, I didn't add shallots, I added scallops!! Made the dish even more flavorful in my opinion :)

Very good. Left out the butter and used olive oil. Added some garlic salt and red pepper flakes. Very delicious. Next time will add more tomatoes and some mushrooms. Very simple and tasty!

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I made it and everyone wanted the recipe just by the photo we posted on Facebook.  We later made it for my parents and they loved it as well.  We did make some adjustments - we used one can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) and more spinach.  Also recommend not adding the shrimp until after the spinach so they don't overcook.

My husband and I tried this recipe for the first time last night.  It was fabulous! I changed very little. I didn't have any green onions,  and I put a whole can of diced tomatoes in rather than just 1 cup.  A sprinkle of parmesan on the top, a good roll and yum!

Very yummy. Even the non-pasta loving man of the house enjoyed it. I basically made it as per the recipe except for using shell pasta as I didn't have the other kind.

Alright, so I tweaked this recipe a bunch and it turned out amazing! To start, I did not have shallots so I used a half a vidalia onion. Used half butter and half olive oil, and halved grape tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. I also used cubed chicken breast instead of shrimp because that's what I had. Lastly I added another cup of pasta because it didn't seem like enough. I added the chicken after cooking the onions, etc for a bit then added the wine and tomatoes a minute or two before adding the pasta and spinach. Topped with fresh grated parmesan...It was SOO good and nice and light. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Opted for a different but similar seasoning blend. The shrimps were seasoned perfectly, but it the flavours get lost in the less than substantial sauce. Healthy and quick dish though.

This was a hit!! I would have loved to try the orecchiette pasta but had to substitute. I also used a yellow onion rather than shallot. Loved the flavor and will definitely cooked this again! YUMMY!

Wow.  This was awesome.  My husband loved this and said we should have it weekly.  I used half butter and half olive oil for the fat, and maybe put in a bit less than what the recipe called for.  I used the Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site.  I doubled the amount of creole/cajun seasoning and halved the amount of black pepper.

Wonderful! I was told this was a "keeper", but I did add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of white pepper, and an additional cup of diced tomatoes. I felt the sauce was too dry with only a single cup of tomato. These additions really pull the dish together and give it that extra "kick" we craved. Thanks!

A fantastic dish.  I loved the flavors it was light and delicious.  I made the mistake of using frozen shrimp.  This can be chewy.  Definatly use fresh when you can.  I love the flavor of the oreccheitte pasta.  I buy delallo pasta as it is the only one I can get that is orecchiette in my local market but it has great flavor.  I never thought it made a difference with what pasta I bought but it does.

Very good and easy to make dish.  I thought it needed a little more spice so I added red pepper flakes to my plate but, left everyone elses alone.  I was a little worried about the 1 cup wine because it had a really strong smell but, the wine did not overpower like I thought it would.

Delicious!  This was infused with SO much flavor.  I added probably 2 cups of spinach and would add even more next time along with more tomato.  Other than that, it's just perfect.  Before serving, I sprinkled the dishes with green onions & fresh parmesan and enjoyed with a salad, bread and white wine.  Truly fantastic dinner... thanks for the awesome recipe!

FABULOUS recipe- one of my new favorites!  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter lite and added more cajun, but this recipe is perfect how it is.  Looks elegant and impressive, but really is sooo easy!
Great job

Update 2/23/2016:
I have been making this exact recipe for 8 years now. I enjoy it just as much as I did back when I first saved the recipe. It's part of my regular menu rotation and a clear family favorite. So delicious!

This was delicious! I couldn't find orecchiette do I used whole wheat rotini instead, and it worked out great (the sauce was so good, no one noticed the whole wheat pasta). There is a lot of butter in this recipe, but it's surprisingly light. I like this type of sauce much better than a heavy cream sauce, and the amount of spiciness was perfect.

Absolutely wonderful!  I added a little twist by putting a can of tomato sauce (for sauciness) and stirring in some mozzarella.

I took this to a Mardi Gras style potluck and people inhaled it. I used rotini (corkscrew) pasta, which worked just fine, and didn't have enough shallots, so added some chopped onion. Also added a few TB of hot sauce to pump it up a bit. All in all, a really wonderful dish that reheats very well. Thanks!

Given how easy this was to prepare and how quickly it came together, I was surprised by the flavor!  I used grape tomatoes, extra baby spinach and sprinkled parmigiano-reggiano over the top.  Very good!  I will definitely make this again!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe and said it is a recipe that can be repeated again.  

I altered it a bit as my grocery store did not have Orecchiette pasta; therefore I used Davinci Gnocchi.  

I also added 1/2 can large artichokes (drained and quartered) the same time you add the tomatoes.

Loved it. The only thing I changed is using a can of fire roasted diced
 tomatoes and next time I will use 2 cans.

Loved this recipe with a few changes. I reduced the amount of butter to 2 or 3 tablespoons. I sauteed the shrimp with the onions, garlic and the cajun seasoning to give it some extra taste. I was a little concerned the shrimp would be overcooked but they were perfect. I had a small piece of smoked sausage left over so I chopped it up and threw that in too. It was FANTASTIC!

after reading several reviews, I found they all had one thing in common - too much liquid. I cut the wine in half, it was great. My family loved it and it was just as delicious as a leftover. I would double the tomatoes and spinach, as they were a nice addition.

I made this dish for my husband last night. He loved it!  It was very easy to make.  I added freshly sliced mushrooms to my dish (I took the idea from other readers).  We also had fresh garlic bread with this meal.  A white wine was also right on time for this dinner.  I will definitely make this again.  I brought the leftovers to work today and my co-worker devoured it!  Now she wants the recipe.
Thanks

Very good, nice enough for company.  Substituted greek seasoning for cajun as my family can't handle anything hot.  I thickened with cornstarch and milk at the end as one reviewer suggested.  Also skipped the shallots and green onion and used plain white onion that I had on hand, and added fresh mushrooms.   Delish!

I used 1/2 tps of cajun and it was perfect.  I could not find Orecchiette so I used something similar and we loved it.   Even better the next day.

This is a great recipe, but in my opinion, WAY too much Cajun seasoning! I would suggest using less than a teaspoon--any more, and it dominates the entire recipes, and there are a lot of great flavors in it. I could find the orichette (?), so we just used rotini.

I thought there was way too much pepper. My husband really liked it as is. Next time, I will use half the pepper and may even double the tomatoes.

I made this tonight without looking at the recipe.  Surpriseingly, I almost had it dead on.  The main thing I forgot was the cajun seasoning!
I remembered other reviewers saying it was too watery, so I added about 2 TB tomato paste to pan along with draining the tomatoes.  I also added a couple of fresh shredded basil leaves.  Top with some cheese and it was a perfect dinner.  Thanks Dawn, next time I'll try it with the cajun seasoning!

Delicious!  My boyfriend and I ate all 6 servings between the two of us.  I did cut the spices a bit as other reviewers suggested, and it was still plenty spicy.

Just finished eating this and was very pleased with the overall recipe. For some reason, this came out more like a soup than anything. I substituted broth for the wine, but I am considering leaving the liquid, aside from the juice of the tomatoes, out all together. I cut the Cajun seasoning down to two teaspoons and it was perfect. My family loved it and liked it despite the 'soupy' texture. I will definitely make this again.

This could be a good recipe if the seasonings are adjusted.  Using the amount of cajun seasoning and black pepper made this dish unappetizing and unedible.  Adjust the seasonings downward and it will work.
