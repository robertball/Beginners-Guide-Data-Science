We substituted gorgonzola for the blue cheese since we really dislike blue.  Next time, I would only use 3 oz cheese - it kind of overpowered.  The grilled chicken was great on the salad.  I also added crumbled bacon and sliced cucumbers.  Unfortunately I forgot the avacado!  I even bought one just for the salad.  Oh well, next time!

This was the first time I've used blue cheese in a recipe and I found out that I don't like it.  Otherwise, the recipe was delicious and I would just substitute another kind of cheese if I make it again.
