This was perfect!!! Tasted awesome. It is difficult to find a good low carb recipe. We toasted the slices and made a BLT. I will be using this recipe again!!!

I thought this was very good.  The dill really complements the flavor, and I love the creaminess of the cottage cheese.  It helps to have a couple of tools, like a blender and a hand mixer, but you could do it with just elbow grease.  I blended the wet ingredients in a blender after mixing the dry ingredients, then use a mixer to combine everything.  I've made flax bread before and this is my favorite recipe so far.  

 So for the man who posted a curt, uninformative, negative review, here is the thing about flax bread.  It tastes like flax.  If you like the taste of flax, you will like this bread.  If you don't, you won't.  So don't make this bread and then be upset because it tastes like flax.  

Great recipe!

Yes I made it. Wish I hadn't. Horrible.
