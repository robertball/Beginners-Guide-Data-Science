I tried this recipe for my first vegetarian dinner for vegetarian friends, and it went down really well.  I added mushrooms to give a bit more variety, and therefore needed a bit more wine / water to make it a bit more 'saucy'.  I still found it was only enough for about 3 people, so add more tofu or other vegetables for 4 people.  The 'bourgignon' taste was great and worked really well as the wine soaks into the tofu... yum!

I substituted seitan for the tofu, and this was without a doubt the most delicious dinner I have ever made. Especially with the seitan, it is an unusually hearty vegetarian meal.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it didn't quite meet my expectations.  The previous reviewer said that the tofu soaked up the red wine flavor...I don't think it did.  The tofu was a little bland.  Also, the 15-20 minutes simmering did not thicken the sauce, so I had to add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch/water slurry at the end to help it along.  If you are serving this as a side dish, then it produces 4 servings.  However, if you are preparing this for a main course, you do only get 3 servings tops.  This was an okay dish, but I probably would not make again.  It was a lot of effort for something that was just a little too bland.

This was just okay.  I gave it three stars because I like the sauce itself.  It is a nice, flavorful, light tomato sauce.  I did make a few changes, as I added more mushrooms and instead of one fresh tomato I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes which gave the sauce more juice. I did not have a problem with the sauce not getting thick after simmering it.  However, the tofu was not very good with it.  It did not soak up the red wine flavor even after simmering for 45 minutes, so it was very bland.  Also even one whole package of tofu was too much for me--any beginning vegetarian should only use half of a package at most.  In addition, the look of purple tofu is not very appetizing.  I will use this recipe again, but I will use ground burger-style vegetarian crumbles instead of tofu, or just make the tomato sauce by itself and serve it over some penne pasta or liguine.

Pretty tasty and not difficult to put together. Not as beautiful to look at as meat bourguignonne. Fresh parsely on top after cooking would help it be more attractive, I think.

I found the sauce to thin, but I suppose if you follow the ingredient amounts then it wouln't be, I added to much tofu (got no idea what 2 8oz boxes of tofu are in metric) so I added more wine with water, more mushrooms and tomatos.  It was tasty, I don't think it lacked flavour and I found that the tofu did soak up a little of the wine flavour.

I really found this to be blah.  Doubled the mushrooms and fresh tomato.  Needed a lot of salt and pepper.  Still feel it needs something.  I served it over a bed of wilted spinach and sprinkled it with Parmesan because it tasted more like a pasta dish than a Bourguignoone.

Good basic idea but I modified the recipe a lot to taste.

Have used this recipe as a base several times. I think the bland flavour of the tofu works excellently against the flavoursome sauce. I have also made this with Quorn and swapped the veggies around.

When choosing a wine, if you don't want to drink it, you're not going to want to eat it.
