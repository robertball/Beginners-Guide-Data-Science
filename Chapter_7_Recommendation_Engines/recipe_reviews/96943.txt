These were so yummy! I made them for a party so I quadrupled the recipe and they turned out wonderful. I think next time I may cut the soy sauce down to half a tablespoon as it was a bit overpowering. (I'm in Asia and the soy sauce here is much stronger then out west.) I roasted red and orange peppers on my stove then sliced them up and served them like that. I then sauteed the onions and added mushrooms.. They were gone so fast, I barely got a taste!

This is way good and will now be a family staple. Instead of adding 2 tsp of chili powder, I used 1 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp of cumin. I used fresh squeezed lime juice and didn't add any lime juice to the veggies, as other reviews said that the lime flavor was a little overpowering. Turned out great. Not too spicy either, just flavorful.

This was VERY easy and a tasty meal.  The next time I make this I will add a little more spices.  Maybe some crushed red pepper.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be making this over and over again.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  This is an excellent recipe for a meat marinade.  We made our fajitas with a little more "stuff" that we piled on after everything was cooked (cheese, sour cream, Schwan's guacamole), but this was a perfect recipe.  I marinated the chicked for an hour- gave it tons of flavor.  This recipe is now a fixture in my recipe box!

Delicious! I adapted a little to my family's taste: sauteed the peppers and onions first and on higher heat until lightly browned just like our favorite Tex-Mex restaurants, then did the same with the chicken. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly; next time, I will add a little salt and pepper. This is definitely one I will cook again. Even my picky husband liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

I was surprised to see Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce used in this recipe, but I decided to give it a try anyways.  The ingredients made for a tasty (and easy) marinade and my family finished all of their plates. I would make this again.

I read the reviews first and after I got the marinade mixed up, it did smell alot like something Asian so I added 1 packet of Italian dressing mix, as this was an ingredient in several other chicken fajita recipes on this site.  I cut chicken breasts into thin strips and didn't find it dry at all.  These were wonderful with the change.  I made this with "Avocado,Mango and Tomato Salsa" from this site and it was to die for with this salsa.  You MUST try this salsa with this recipe.  It is a great combo.  Very quick and tasty recipe.

Tasty. And easy to make.  Just remember you'll need 30 minutes before you start grilling to marinate the chicken.

I was expecting more.  It was okay.  I added some additional lime and salt after cooking.  I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

Marinade was good. Would probably take out the chili powder next time. Also, would reduce the heat when cooking chicken, as the marinade burns very easily. I doubled the recipe and served the fajitas with the onions and peppers, homemade guacamole and salsa, cheddar cheese and lettuce.

This was great!  I didn't have any worcestershire, and since I know NOTHING about it, I used the rest of Balsamic vinagar, which was only about 1/2 teaspoon.  Oh and I used beef instead of chicken.  I added some garlic powder and cumin, salt and pepper.  Great recipe!!

I used half the lime juice as previous reviewers mentioned it was all they tasted, but if I make this again I'll follow the exact recipe.  The lime really makes it fajitas!

These fajitas are bland and taste nothing like those we had in Mexico. I made them with beef instead of chicken, that's why I still give them 3 stars. Might try with chicken to see if it's any better.

Very good, the favor of the chicken was excellent! I used 1/4 tsp taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and it worked fine.

This recipe for our family was not outstanding, or above average, just ***average***. There was too much lime. Lime in the chicken and lime in the onion and pepper saute. It tasted citrusy and strange, when all I wanted was the flavour of the chicken. It left an aftertaste of sour lime as well.
