This recipe definitly lives up to it's name as being the "best ever"! I made the soup last night to rave reviews.  I made a few minor adjustments as follows. First, I added 1/4tsp. Cayenne Pepper to "kick it up a notch".  Then I added 1/2 cup sour cream (yummy).  And I made sure that the 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese was sharp!  That added so much more flavor.  Excellent recipie. Would make again and again.

For taste, I would give this recipe way more than five stars!  It tasted great--I loved the combination of vegetables, plus I added a couple of carrots, and substituted frozen chopped spinach.  My only other additions were salt, pepper, and the tabasco that I add to all cheese soups.  The texture of mine turned out crappy, though, but I'm pretty sure it's because I didn't have enough potatoes.  I'd already started putting it together before getting out the potatoes, and I maybe had 1 1/2 pounds, so the cheese had nothing to stick to but itself.  Despite that debacle, everybody loved it, and I will definitely try again!

If you have some time to prepare all the veggies and potatoes (it probably took me 45 minutes to chop everything) then it's worth the work!  This soup was super creamy, I couldn't believe there wasn't milk or cream in it.  I didn't chop the broccoli and califlower enough, so the pieces were too big- that's what I would change next time.  Delicious!

Little pepper and it's perfect! 
Hooray for *real* food!! It's refreshing to find a recipe that's doesn't called for bags of frozen vegetables, dehydrated potatoes, canned soups and processed cheese!

I scaled this down to 4 servings. To make it vegetarian I used vegetable bouillon instead of the chicken. After tasting I added some garlic powder. My daughter likes her soup quite chunky so I only blended about a third of the soup. Very enjoyable and bound to be on the menu again. Many Thanks.

This soup has a fantastic flavor. My husband had oral surgery and needed something totally soft to eat; so we pureed the whole thing, broccoli, cauliflower and all.  It was really tasty and had a great texture.  However I am really looking forward to trying again with the original recipe when his mouth is healed.

I was looking to use up some broccoli and cauliflower that I had and stumbled upon this recipe. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I just used what was on hand. I added some little bits of grilled chicken. Exciting way to use up my veggies

This was absolutely delicious! I have a hard time getting my husband to eat vegetables, but he loved this. It turned out very green, which I loved but he was hesitant about, but it was so good he didn't mind!

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but pureed it a bit more. I also added sour cream after reading the other reviews, and I recommend it. It tastes almost like a loaded baked potato. Very creamy and filling!

I really LOVE this soup.  I omit the potatoes (to reduce carbs for a diabetic) and saut√© broccoli and cauliflower along with the onions in olive oil and butter, then follow the other directions as listed.  I use my immersion blender and blend all the vegetables once they are cooked.  The soup is very creamy without lots of extra calories.  Once the cheese is added, no salt or pepper are needed; the flavor is perfect.  I've started calling this my "Virtuous Soup".  Thanks for sharing the recipe, AMEHNEY.

I hardly would call this the best ever anything. It's fine.  I used 2 less potatoes than called for and the soup was still way too thick. I tried after eating two bowls of the soup to puree it, but its still too thick. Flavor wise it's fine, but not great. I would not make this soup again.

Must've been operator error, but my soup turned out very green! Dear Daughter just got clear braces and can't eat foods that will stain. I made this soup just for her, and halved the recipe, using 3 oz spinach and a head of broccoli, but it was spinach-colored dark green. It tasted fantastic, but for the next two years while she's in braces, I'll have to find a potato soup recipe. I'll serve the remainder of this tonight to the other 3 family members. Beware, this makes a ton of soup!

I made this with some variation and my husband said this is the best soup he has ever had. (and his mother cooked homemade soups all the time). He ate the whole pot within 2 days,then asked me to make more, or to show him how to make it (rolled my eyes...he doesn't cook, that was his way of saying...please make some asap). He bragged about it to the neighbors and they asked to try some, so I made another batch, handed it out and have been asked for the recipe. My changes were: I only used two onions, added two stalks of chopped celery, added a finely chopped clove of garlic to the saute part. I used 4 large cut up zucchini's instead of the potatoes, added sprig of thyme, some ground black pepper, 1/2 cup of milk, and a can of cream of mushroom soup. Once all cooked, I used a hand blender in the pot to puree and apparently, it was "award winning".

I halved it and used onion soup mix instead of the chicken cubes. It turned out very good, would make again.

so yummy! love this soup- made it exactly as the recipe calls and it was very good, i did leave 1/4 of the soup chunky just because i didn't want the whole thing pureed, but it was outstanding in flavor! 
also- this seems to be a great "diet" food,.. except for the potatoes, which you could scale down a bit, and add more cauliflower, it would be pretty much low carb ! :) also without any added dairy (besides butter) (you could add olive oil) its dairy free! and then.. less fat as well. 
Love this, will be making it regularly! thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

Excellent -- even my son who doesn't like cauliflower enjoyed this soup.  I love that it's thickened with the potatoes -- so no cream and it freezes very well.  I probably only used a little over 3 lbs of potatoes because I didn't think I could cook 5 pounds of potatoes in that amount of water, but I don't see where that would have affected the taste any.  I hesitated on that many onions, but it wasn't too oniony tasting at all.  I froze half without the cheese and will add it when I reheat.   Made the French rolls on this site to go with it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious as is but for all of you spicy lovers a couple dashes of hot pepper sauce really makes this over the top!  I love how this is almost cream like but with no cream!  Yum!

I thought this soup was very good and I always wanted a soup that used  broccoli and cauliflower.  I added salt, pepper and franks red hot sauce.  I used chicken broth to cook the broc and cau and used that liquid in the the soup.  When the soup got too thick I thin it with more chicken broth.  I really don't like the chemical taste of bouillon cubes.  I will make this again and again. Thanks

Very good recipe. When you add the five cups of liquid to cook the potatoes make sure to keep the remainder on hand in case it's too thick (like mine was) when your done adding the blended half back in. I added a little garlic powder to mine I just love garlic. It came out delicious and would probably be better tomorrow!

Delicious.  I only had 3 potatoes and no spinach.  I also used chicken broth vs. bullion and it turned out great!

I meant to add that carrots and garlic cloves are a perfect addition to this recipe. For some reason I had every single vegetable in my refrig. So when I saw this recipe I just went to work. I didn't chop up the broccoli and cauliflower till after I cooked them Then used a knife while they were still in pot. Saved time there.

Let me preface my review by saying that I chose this recipe because most everything it called for was something I had  on hand that absolutely needed to be used up.  I did not change the recipe or substitute any ingredients.  The only deviation I made was that the broccoli and cauliflower that I used were the stalks and cutoffs from heads that I had used the florets in a salad earlier in the week. I can't bear to throw the stalks away as there is so much good stuff left even if it isn't the "pretty" part of the veggie! The onion and potatoes were aging garden produce that needed to be used up soon as well.  That being said, this soup is truly delicious and filling!! I added both sharp cheddar cheese, along with some Velveeta (as mentioned by another reviewer) that  I had in my fridge that also needed to find a use. This recipe is really easy to pull together (hardest part is peeling the potatoes, and I might not have done that if my potatoes were a bit  fresher), and well worth a try. I don't think you will be disappointed!

I followed the recipe exactly but after adding the cheese it was a clumpy mess and all the cheese wouldn't melt. I used old cheddar. Anyone tell me what I did wrong?

Too much onion not enough cheese or broccoli and very watery  if I make it again I will increase the cheese add just a 1/2 of a small onion and skip the potato put in more broccoli use milk or cream instead of water. Won't make it this way again.

Delicious exactly as-is... However, a 8oz block of cream cheese and crumbled bacon take it over-the-top!!! -- I used chicken stock instead of adding the broccoli water to the potatoes/onions

I only made one ingredient change....I added garlic.  Because, well....garlic makes everything better.  I did change up preparation a bit.  I microwaved the broccoli and cauliflower to limit the number of pans that need hand washing.  Yes, I'm lazy.  Then I put the potatoes and spinach in as called for.  And the broccoli and cauliflower at the same time as NOT called for.  I used a stick blender to puree partially and it is delicious.  Next time I may increase the broccoli and spinach.  Excellent!

Made it for the first time and was surprised it turned out so well despite my omitting couple ingredients. I didn't have cauliflower on hand, and also halved the recipe (still made a big pot though!). This is a very forgiving soup, I realized after finished cooking that I forgot to add chicken boullion but the flavor was still good! Also added some shredded carrots for color, and salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Soup was super creamy and texture was wonderful with some chunkiness to it. Loved the fresh ingredients and great way to incorporate veggies! Very easy to make.

Soup was very good, butI think 5 pounds of potatoes is a typo error. I think it should say 5 cups,so that‚Äôs what I used. I also cooked the veggies in chicken broth.

LOVE THIS!!!  While I was making it I kept thinking the instructions were wrong.  First, 4 onions seems overkill for a soup, and especially one that only calls for 6 cups of water!  But I followed the recipe exactly despite my skepticism.  Then when I 5 pounds of potatoes to just 5 cups of water, I thought for sure there was a mistake!  If it were me I would have added double the water.  But I kept on... It turned out perfect, and my family of 9 (4 of whom are under age 7), gobbled it up! I did add a tsp of salt and a half a tsp of pepper to the whole pot at the end.  I will be making this again and again!

Quick and easy. I used veg broth and bullion instead of chx and it was still delicious! Put grilled chx on top for my love and he loved it. Don't forget to blanch broccoli to preserve it's gorgeous color and be sure to add lots of pepper!

Love it!  I didn't have broccoli when I made it but it was just as good.  I didn't use 4 med onions because I was a little concerned that it may be too much.  I used 5 small (golf ball sized) and it seems enough.  I added pepper and I may add a little more cheese.  But overall... it's a keeper!

I didn't have any broccoli and only had parmesan and fresh spinach, but this was great. I generally shy away from bouillon, so I put in my own spices (celery salt, cracked pepper, a little oregano, and whatever else I found) -- both partner and I enjoyed it on this chilly winter day. Also: pretty easy and it turned out a lovely green color!

This was great! Very easy--I followed directions basically as written, except I substituted extra broccoli for cauliflower, and since I didn't have a food processor handy, I just kept everything in tact at that stage. I only used about 3/4 cup of cheddar, but everything turned out well. Very tasty, and cheesy without being too heavy/creamy. Will definitely make again.

My kids call this "hippie soup" because of the color.  This soup is s awesome and is now a staple in our vegetarian diet.  You can add or subtract any ingredients(like tomatoes!) if you use the basic potato, spinach, onions.   Served with crusty bread or warm pumpernickel or rye...yum...

I wouldn't put as much califlower or Broccoli in next time it absorbed all the broth.  1/2 a head of califlower and 1 head of broccoli would probably be good.

I had to add more water to thin this soup.  Also added extra bouillon for more flavor, but in the end, the soup tasted great and was very healthy.  I used an immersion blender so I'd still have some chunks.  I may cut down on the potatoes next time.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because the prep time took a lot longer that expected

Yum.  Was missing a little something, though.  I added more bullion as someone suggested and even a bit of garlic powder.  
Great healthy meal.

I have found that if you add more chicken bouillon i gives it more flavor, I hate bland food, so I usually use more than just 6 cubes, more like 12.  Just season it to your preference.

It's good but it's missing something.  I added more water (2 cups) and also 1 cup of Parmesan cheese that the recipe didn't call for.  The Parmesan helped give it a bit more flavor but it's still lacking something.

very good soup, I added a little nutmeg in there.  Feels like it needs a little extra kick/flavor somehow though.

This soup was delicious.  It's a beautiful green color.
I made it without the brocoli & the cauliflower, and it was still great.

I fixed this soup for my turn in our soup club at work and everyone loved it. It was a quick and easy recipe to make.
