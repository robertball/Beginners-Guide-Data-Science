This is the most delicious recipe I have ever tasted. I was worried that the venison back strap would be gamey and tough, but it was "cut with a fork" tender and amazing!! I didn't change any of the ingredients for this recipe. The only thing that I did different was I browned my meat as directed but I put it in a Dutch oven instead for a 9x13 pan. Poured the sauce over the meat, put the lid on and popped it in the oven for an hour. Served it with mashed potatoes and it was A-MAZING!!!

Great recipe! I didn't have an onion and didn't have time to run to the store, so I used the closest thing I had... French fried onions. I was really concerned about this substitution, but it worked out great! I will try this recipe again as it is written, with real onion next time, but I gotta say there was nothing wrong with using French fried onions :)

Very good recipe. I used round steak instead of venison. My family really liked it. It's a keeper.

Wonderful Recipe! It had such great flavor. Be careful when browning the steaks on the stove. Do not leave on one side for too long. Burns fast! :)

Simple to make and flavorful.  It's a bit too sweet for my taste even though I reduced the sugar (didn't have brown so I used 2 tsp. white plus 1 tsp. molasses), and I made the amateurish mistake of doubling the butter.  I think I missed the vinegar I usually put in my BBQ sauces.
