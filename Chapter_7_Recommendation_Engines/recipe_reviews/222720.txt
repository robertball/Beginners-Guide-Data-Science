Brushed olive oil on both sides with pastry brush. Added Montreal Steak Seasoning and as others suggested grated parmesan cheese. Grilled for 3 minutes per side at med- hot temp.  Finished with fresh lemon juice. DELISH!! Will make again.Thanks for recipe! UPDATE~ Try crushing garlic croutons on top after grilling. Gives a really nice crunch.

My husband has been making this for years, only he puts fresh parmesean cheese on top and slighty melts it.  Everyone loves this and its so easy to do.

I've made this a number of times. I use Italian dressing brushed on before grilling. I fry up some bacon real crisp and dice up some tomatoes or halve cherry or grape tomatoes and saute them in the bacon grease. When the lettuce is done, throw the bacon and tomato on the top. Drizzle a little more Italian dressing over the top and it's a BLT grilled salad!

Awesome!  I used some garlic infused olive oil.  Served with steak and grilled zucchini and peppers.  Easy and very tasty.

Outstanding! Made this for my wife on Valentine's Day 2013 and she flipped over it! I used a mustard vinegrette dressing and omitted the steak seasoning for just salt and pepper. Nice change from the everyday salad. A party in your mouth!

I love to make grilled Romaine in the summertime, instead of lemon juice I gave it a couple of squirts of balsamic vinegar salad spray and server it along side of balsamic marinated chicken with fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, and sliced tomatoesâ€¦.awesome summertime meal!

If you haven't tried grilled romaine you must give it a try!  It's something completely different and delicious!  My family even loved it!  Try really hard to get the oil and seasoning in between the lettuce leaves.  YUM!

Really good and really simple. I used Montreal steak seasoning and skipped the lemon simply because I didn't have any. Will be making this one again.

Love this!  I just used the olive oil with a little salt and pepper.  Fresh parmesean melted on it is great too.

I've always wanted to try grilled lettuce and I was blown away by how much flavor this had! It's still got some crunch to it and it's got great smokey flavor. YUM YUM!! The lemon at the end really makes it.

We were anxious to try this, as we don't always get our Romaine used before it starts to wilt.  We used a fresh head of lettuce and grilled as written.  Interesting, and the taste isn't bad.  We didn't care for the texture of this dish.  We might try this again to see if it was our error, but I believe our results were similar to expected results of this dish.

I had heard of this technique once and was intrigued.  It certainly was easy, though I don't think I put enough of the seasoning on since I could barely taste it.  Also, I was making it for four and almost bought the recommended 2 heads of romaine, but thought better of it.  Used only one and that was more than plenty.

So easy and good.  Sliced zucchini and grilled it the same way just skipped the lemon juice on it.  But the romaine was perfect with steak seasoning and lemon juice.  Will definitely make it again!!

I was skeptical about this one but tried it anyway.  I only had iceburg lettuce and green leaf lettuce on hand.  I tried the iceburg first... tasted great.  We decided to grill more and used the green leaf lettuce.  It was just okay.  I am looking forward to trying it with Romaine.  I used montreal steak seasoning, olive oil, and drizzled balsamic vinegar.  I topped it off with freshly grated romano cheese.  I will definitely make again in the future.

This is the 3rd time I have made this recipe and loved all 3 times.  I also chopped up some and created a Cesar style salad.  Add tomatoes, cucumbers and a little parsley.  used a dressing from the ar site.  Will be making again but will not cut the end off the romaine lettuce until after it has been BBQ.

If you are grilling anyway, put this on after you take off the other stuff to rest. Don't let it sit long before serving. And, a little Hellman's mayo doesn't hurt anything.

I didn't use the lemon juice, but substituted white balsamic vinegar. As others suggested, I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. I think it would be great with freshly grated Parmesan too! Great way to use up Romaine! Very easy and delicious. I made it with steak and baked potatoes. Mmmmmmm!

Left off the lemon juice, but it was still amazing, especially the charred edges.  Next time I'll cook it a bit on the other side, too.

I had to try this.  This is terrific and I have made it twice, so far.  I never would have thought to put romaine on the grill so I am glad you did and shared it with us!  Of course it doesn't take long on the grill, don't walk away!

Absolutely AWESOME. I've grilled some unusual things and this is one of them. Everybody loved it. I used Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick, I think.

We have some food sensitivity in our family so we did have to substitute a few things. Here is what we used for substitutes:

Oil - Sunflower Seed Oil
Spices - Garlic and Sea Salt, Korean Cyan Pepper
Cheese - Vegan Cheese slices

We cooked it in the oven as opposed to grilling. Cooked under the broiler 5 minutes per side (more or less)

Easy, different side dish we enjoyed!  Croutons and parmesan make everything tasty.  My husband now calls all Romaine, "fry lettuce."

I was skeptical of grilling lettuce but I'm glad that I tried it. Family members liked it as well (kids wouldn't try it and I wasn't surprised by that). As mentioned in another review, grated fresh parm. cheese was a great addition but I'm sure that it would of been just as yummy without.

This is a nice twist to traditional romaine salads. Season to your taste and serve.  The finished product does vary based on the quality of romaine you start with. Also, in a pinch, you can do it under the broiler on high, top shelf.

Make it better! 1/6 cup brown sugar, 1/6cup grated parm, 2tbls of seafood magic 5 oz Caesar dressing 3 oz melted butter...mix 1tbls seafood magic and 5 oz Caesar dressing and set aside for salad dressing. Mix other ingredients in mixing bowl.take whole head of romain and cut in half. Leave romain intact to hold romain leaves together. Trim romain tips off. Grab brown sugar, park, magic, butter mix and spread on the flat bottom of both halves of romain. And place in large skillet preheated on mid high. Leave in skillet until brown sugar mix melted, romain leaves browned and wilted on bottom, and each half head is warm threw out. And pull from skillet. Leaving skillet hot place your steak coated in blackened season and cook to desired temp.

This recipe is perfect as written but you can also customize it the way you want to. We like to sprinkle Lawry's seasoning on after the olive oil. After the lettuce is grilled we dice it, add in some chopped grilled tomatoes and splash a dash of balsamic vinegar or on top. Grated Parmesan sprinkled on top is good, or add some feta.

I've made this on my gas grill several times and it always turns out delicious. I know it sounds unusual, but try it.  If you like that grilled flavor, you will like this salad.

Simple, impressive and delicious! What 's better than making your entire meal - salad, entree and side - on the grill!? I grilled the lettuce over med-high heat for about 4-5 mins. After squeezing the lemon, I topped it with a bit of freshly grated parmesan. YUM! This is one of those recipes that is so easy, you wonder where all the amazing flavor comes from! Perfect for company.

A really simple recipe that the entire family loved!  Who knew the kids liked lettuce?

I skipped the lemon juice at the end. Instead I added some grilled onion, chopped everything up and served as a salad.

Decided to try it, since I had a head of Romaine in the frig. And we're we having steak.  Was a nice surprise how good it tasted.

This is a Great salad if you want something different.  I use three types of flavors of vinegar's one in the middle and a different flavor on each end. Fresh bacon bits don't hurt either. Don't tell your guests about the flavors and watch their eyes when they taste it. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grilled-Hearts-of-Romaine/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=grilled%20romaine%20hearts&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe&soid=sr_results_p1i1

Wow.  I had only grilled one head for 5 of us. That went sooo fast I immediately had to make 2 additional heads!  I used montreal chicken seasoning, added crushed cheese and garlic croutons and parm cheese and it was amazing!  Already had a request to have this again with dinner tonight!  Thank you for making me look like a star! :)

Serve with steak and blue cheese dressing!  Heaven! We used a medium high temp on the grill. Easy and loved the flavor and texture.
