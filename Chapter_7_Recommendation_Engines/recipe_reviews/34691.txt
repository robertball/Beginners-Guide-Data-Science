You could substitute low-fat cream cheese for the "fromage".

Note: For more "heat" add cayenne pepper or a hot curry powder, like Madras, to taste. Also, chopped cilantro would be more authentic to recipe than green onions.

I made major changes, so take this with a grain of salt. First of all, I made this in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours. I threw in a 1 lb tenderloin whole. I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I used regular potatoes (diced), but didn't add them to the pot until the last hour. I used regular onion, which I threw in the cooker with the meat. One of my mangos had gone bad, so I used enough pineapple to make up the difference. I used creme fraiche at the end instead of the "fromage." Oh, and I used full fat everything. All in all, it was good and worth making again.

This was very good. I was concerned about a heavy taste of cumin so I used 2 tablespoons and it was perfect. I also used fresh potatoes. This is a keeper.

Good recipe which can be altered for ingredients on hand, however, it did not cook in time frame described. Required additional time.

This is a perfectly nice pork curry, which we pretty much made as is.  We didn't have korma curry powder on the shelf, so we made our own mix ((3 tbsp ketumbar seeds (coriander), 1 tsp jintan puteh seeds (cumin), 1 tsp white peppercorns, 2 (2-cm) sticks cinnamon, 2 cardamoms, 2 cloves - all heated then ground together - and a 1/4 tsp of tumeric added at the end)).  The second time around, we didn't have fromage frais available, so we tried a bit of cream cheese and that was equally good.  Not bad at all, and a great way to use up mango if you have it about!
