I used margarine and topped these with chocolate icing. They were gone in no time! The coffee and cayenne were a nice twist.

I made this for Mother's day. The cupcakes had a nice, thick flavor and the hint of coffee added an excellent taste. Made 18 cupcakes, and went excellent with the cream cheese frosting.

I used margarine instead of shortening because that's what I had on hand.It was fabulous 18 cupcakes exactly and 24 minutes in my oven.

I ended up with 21 cupcakes because I didn't want to fill the cups too full. They turned out moist, cakelike, filling, and very chocolatey! I topped them with chocolate syrup and sprinkles and they were delicious.

Not super impressed.  They were ok.  I definitely did not overbake but they still seemed a little on the dry side.  Will not make again.

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I needed a tasty, moist chocolate cupcake to serve to kids and adults at my son's 4th birthday party.  What a huge hit!  And I didn't even frost them, just served with vanilla ice cream.  I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the cayenne...wasn't sure the little ones would like it.  Next time I'll add the cayenne back in.  Thanks for a great and, yes, "Super Easy" recipe!

This recipe was alright. The texure of the cupcakes was great, but I think the next time I make these I might have to add more cocoa, because I could barely taste the chocolate. Over all, this recipe was good, but it was not what I had begun to anticipate from what I had read in the reviews.

Very moist, dense, cupcakes that baked up beautifully. The flavor is somewhat mild - next time I would add 1/4 c more cocoa. I do not use granules of coffee in recipes, but instead substituted coffee made in a French press for the water. The coffee flavor isn't terribly intense, and the cayenne was not noticeable at all (I used 1/8 tsp.). Those who like the heat with their chocolate should add more. All in all, a solid recipe.

I made them exactly as the recipe instructed and the batter was very thick and not at all pourable. They smelled unpleasant as they were baking and that was my first warning sign; they had a loose consistency once baked - and I didn't overbake - and tasted mostly like flour. The other people who I had try the first pan couldn't even tell what they  were - I was asked what flavour they were supposed to be, which is never a good thing.

I am just delighted at how these turned out.  Luscious is the word for it - mine were moist and came out of the tin perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly, then added a cup of Hersheys chocolate pieces, just for the kids.  I will be back using this recipe next time.  I always wanted a recipe so I could avoid packet mixes, and this will be it.

I did not like this recipe.  Cupcakes do not have much chocolate flavor.  The consistency is more for a cake than cupcakes as I was not able to cleanly remove any of the cooled cupcakes from the wrapper.  They fall apart.  If there was more chocolate and they were baked in a 9x13 I would rate this a 3.  Adjustments should be made if you are planning on removing these from their wrappers.

The texture was perfect, and they were incredibly moist, but the taste was a bit bland. However, with a mocha variation of the One Minute Icing, they were perfect and a great hit with my friends!

Simply outstanding.  I've made these several times now, and even used the recipe to make my son's birthday cake (sans coffee).  I am invariably asked for the recipe.

A wonderful, dense, moist cupcake! I used butter, instead of shortening, and my left over morning coffee in lieu of the water, and omitted the instant coffee. Was hoping for more coffee flavor- nex time I'll use the instant! Topped off with powdered sugar...Will make these again.

Great tasting cupcake! I made mini cupcakes using a piping bag to fill them. They took 18 minutes in the oven. I couldn't taste the cayenne so next time I will add some more.

WONDERFUL! I used butter because I didn't have shortening. The texture of these cupcakes is very nice. I paired them with a mocha icing. Definitely a keeper!

Great cupcake!  I didn't have the instant coffee so I simply used brewed/cooled coffee in place of 1 cup of the water, then used plain water for the other 1/2 cup.  These had a delicious flavor without icing.  Great.

I used butter instead of shortening and I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I left it out. I did add mini-chocolate chips for an extra chocolate punch. Everyone raved about them. I would def make these again.

Some of the best tasting homemade cupcakes I've ever made. I read the reviews and came to a conclusion. Instead of instant coffee powder and water I just used leftover coffee. I also used butter instead of shortening, and the cupcakes were fine. I followed the whole recipe (except for the suggested changes) to a "T" and the cupcakes came out perfectly. I will definitely make them again.

WOW this recipe is delicious. It's difficult to bake things like this from scratch, so I was kind of afraid to try, but it was so worth it! 100x better than a cake mix out of the box. the cayenne pepper really does the trick. I didn't have instant coffee so I left that out and they still taste amazing.

One of the best tasting cupcakes I have ever eaten - even better than the fancy 'designer' store ones! I didn't have enough butter (sub'd for the shortening) so I used 2 scoops of cream cheese with 1/2 cup butter - (perhaps this is why they tasted so 'creamy')?  I added a dash more coffee & cayenne but I can still hardly taste those flavors (although I have a peppery after taste on my tongue). I definately recommend watching the bake time and keeping the temp on the lower side. I had them in for 18 mins at 360 and they were perfect. A little crumbly when they first came out but after letting them stand and cool they firmed up beautifully and didn't lose the moistness. I pushed a half of fresh strawberry into the top of each one and then dusted with icing sugar - delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly for the cupcakes  but they came out very dry.  I even baked them about 7 minutes less than what was recommended.  They came out a lighter color than I would have liked.   I am very disappointed in this recipe and still on a search to find a go to recipe for homemade chocolate cupcakes and cake.

Made these for Valentine's Day and topped with cherry cream cheese icing and sprinkles.  They were okay.  Maybe not as rich as I would have liked and I really don't think the coffee and cayenne really made much of a difference.  Found them a little dry.  May try again and reduce cooking time slightly.

I used margarine and made mini cupcakes (they took about 15 minutes to bake and made about 69 minis). I didn't put anything on top of them and my co-workers and husband loved them!

These had a nice light flavor and were very moist. I would definately make them again. Thanks for sharing!

I made exactly the recipe as written, but for some reason the batter came out more like dough.  I had to actually drop by spoonsful into the cupcake liners.  They came out more like chocolate bread than cupcakes, and I wanted to glaze them, but I ended up with rough tops to my cupcakes.  That being said, they are dense and delicious, and I ended up just frosting with a chocolate buttercream instead.  They were a hit!

Great recipe. Changes: I used brewed coffee (cold) instead of water and coffee granules (or half coffee and half water), and I used 100% whole wheat flour, and you couldn't tell at all that it wasn't white flour. I used Nutella on top instead of icing (or syrup as suggested). Yum.

Delicious!  Taste and texture much like a Hostess Cream-Filled Cupcake, but less waxy.  Made about twenty full-sized and fifty mini cupcakes, and twenty-four hours later they had disappeared among six people.

I made changes-but mostly its technique.
Use all butter & Cream butter till pale! Then add sugar. I used 1c white, after all creamed then add vanilla, then 1/2 c brown sugar
Use Milk, not water- all dry ingredients, reduce flour to2 c. Increase chocolate powder to 1 c.
Results in a very Light fluffy cake mix 
Mini cupcakes 14 minutes
Full size cupcakes bake 350 for 20min.
Cool completely before frosting.

Fantastic flavor and texture. I was afraid they wouldn't be a deep enough color (was making halloween spiders), so added a tablespoon of chocolate syrup to that last 1.5 cups of water (replacing fluid, not adding volume). Perfecto! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight and must say that I am asolutely not a fan. I followed the instructions exactly without any alterations. The result was awful! They spread so much that I was rescuing my cupcake pan for 10 minutes and they were definitely inedible. Never again.

I cut this down for 12 cupcakes. I didn't have instant coffee so I brewed really strong coffee and used 2/3 cup strong coffee and 1/3 cup milk, instead of water. Delicious!!

These were AMAZING! Made them for my co-workers and they couldn't get enough of them. Made a couple of changes; used 1/2 margarine, 1/2 shortening and substituted 1/3 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I used the chocolate icing recipe on the back of the Hershey cocoa box and was good to go!

THESE CUPCAKES WEREN'T VERY GOOD. THEY HAD A BLAND TASTE YOU COULDN'T TASTE THE CHOCOLATE AT ALL. I WOULDN'T MAKE THESE AGAIN, BUT IF SOMEONE IS MAKING THESE, I SUGGEST ADDING MORE COCOA. THIS RECIPE ALSO ONLY MADE ELEVEN CUPCAKES.

This was not very good. Despite adding extra liquid they came out a bit on the dry side. Also very bland taste. A box mix would taste better and be less time consuming.

Too sweet for my taste. Like other reviewers I had to increase amount of butter to 6 tablespoons and decrease chocolate to 1/2 cup. Flilling it half way works perfect

It was ok but it came out really dense. More like a brownie to me. If selling this say brownie not a chocolate cupcake. Or put less cocoa powder.

Very good! I used a double shot of espresso with my water and added small chocolate chips. Also doubled the cayenne. Topped em with vanilla frosting. Super yummy
