This was absolutely fantastic!  My husband ended up with a whole flat of strawberries from a local farm, so I was really looking for something different to use them in.

This was the perfect use for them.  Like some of the other reviewers, I added more strawberries (4 cups: 2-pureed and 2 sliced), cut the oil down to 3/4  cup, and only used 1.5 cups sugar since my berries were fairly ripe.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.

This had a wonderful texture and flavour.  I will definitely make it again!

Thanks SO much to all the previous reviewers who provided such great tips. This turned out wonderfully! I halved the recipe to make one loaf - used 1/4 c olive oil, 1 1/2 c strawberries (I sprinkled them with sugar, then smooshed them up with my fingers), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. It was perfectly cooked after 45 mins. The consistency was light, the sweetness spot-on, and the strawberry flavor was just right also. I served this warm with a little fat-free Cool Whip and a sliced strawberry garnish. Thank you, Ellen, for boosting my baking confidence!!

I needed to use up some strawberries and decided to give this recipe a try.  It was easy to make and it turned out great!  After reading the reviews, I was concerned that I didn't have enough strawberries so I added some frozen blueberries.  I also cut back on the cinnamon and added a little vanilla.  My family was pleased with the results.  I would definitely make this again.  I was feeling lazy about washing two loaf pans so I baked it in a bundt pan.  It filled the pan perfectly and would look nice for company or to take to a brunch or office party.

I had some strawberries that most would have thrown out.  They were past ripe for eating.  I threw them into the food processor(there was 12 oz. berries) and put the 2 cups of sugar in and let it spin and set for a while.  I also threw a half of a tangerine rind into the processor as well.  I decreased the oil as suggested to 3/4 cup and decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tbsp. Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  This bread was perfect!  The flavor of the strawberry, spice, and tangerine essence gave it such a nice spark.  Took this to a meeting at work and everyone raved.  I also made some cream cheese spread w/ 8 oz. cream cheese, 10x sugar to sweeten, and grated lemon rind.  It complimented this very nicely.

Very good, although with the recipe as is you can't taste the strawberries. Next time I will double the strawberries, blend in half with juice, and fold in the other half right before the batter goes in the pans. I used 1/2 c. less sugar and it was very good, I also used the sugar from the 1 1/2 cups to sprinkle over the strawberries, otherwise the bread may be too sweet. I baked mine for 1 hour and it was perfect.

Makes a sweet, moist, dense bread. I used fresh strawberries at the peak of ripeness, and was disappointed that the bread didn't have a stronger strawberry taste. The predominant flavor was that of cinnamon. If I were to make this recipe again, I would increase the strawberries - perhaps to 3C - and I would decrease the cinnamon. Additionally, I would consider dicing the strawberries instead of slicing them (or slicing them thicker) so that chunks of fruit would be visible when slicing the bread - like one would see in a blueberry or cranberry bread.

Great recipe, especially if you have a lot of fresh stawberries to use up.  I doubled the strawberries to four cups and cooked in it one bundt pan instead of two loaves.  I cooked it about an extra twenty minutes on top of the fifty, checking until knife inserted comes out clean.  Everyone loved it!!

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: I just love this site b/c I random people.  I mean, it's so much easier when you've had 100s of people try & revise it to PERFECTION!  1. 1st time I made this, I cut the ingred down to only make 1.  BIG MISTAKE! So much better to make full amount so you can slice and then stick in ziplock bags in the freezer.  Breakfast on the go, just heat for 50sec in the microwave!  2nd, 4Cups of strawberries are a must (2 diced, and 2C smooshed w/bottom of measuring cup).  3. Dump the 2C of sugar on top of strawberries, gently mix while mixing rest.  I just dump all in the ingred in one bowl then gently fold. Can't taste the difference when separating dry with wet first. 4. Tasted wonderful with half wheat flour  5. Use one snack size container of unsweetened applesauce then fill rest of 1C measuring cup with oil! 6. With or without vanilla, everyone always says it tastes the same!

Excellent! I used 4 cups of strawberries and halfed the amount of cinnamon as suggested. I also substituted 1/2 the amount of oil with unsweeten applesauce.

AWESOME!!! I mean the cinnamon really gives this bread a great taste!  I would rate this higher than 5 stars if I could!!! I halved this recipe and used 2 mini loaf pans.   I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup and it still pretty sweet.  Baked for 38 minutes.  The bottom was a little browner than I liked but had to get the middle cooked.  Make sure you grease the pan well cause the berries in the batter can stick in the pan.  I didn't get to try the bread until the next morning after it was in the fridge...really great flavor!  This goes to the top of my yearly strawberry recipes.

As I made this I never thought I'd like it - the batter seemed like one, big grease wad.  As it baked, I still thought I wouldn't like it - it was a wimpy loaf, not tall enough, even tho' I baked it in an 8x4" loaf pan rather than the 9x5."  When I tested it (several times!) to see if it was done, I knew I wouldn't like it - it took forever for the inside to get done, while the outside just kept on cookin.'  As I cut it, and it didn't always want to stay in neat slices, I thought it was a gone-er.  I asked Hubs to taste it - he doesn't like bread or muffins.  He gave it 5 stars.  He said it's moist and flavorful on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Can taste both the strawberries and the cinnamon.  As he was giving me his remarks he ate two, good-sized pieces.

I think this recipe is awesome. Usually I don't rate when I've changed some of the ingredients, but I decided to this time. I used closer to 3-1/2 cups of strawberries, and crushed them into a chunky puree. I cut back the cinnamon a little and added about 1 tsp of vanilla. I also baked it in a 9x13 as I didn't have 2 loaf pans. I think it ended up taking about 40 min or so to cook. 
**A note to those who are having difficulties with the outside being crunchy and the inside being soggy...I have always been taught that if you are baking in a glass dish, or a dark metal pan, to lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees, as these types of pans retain more heat than the light metal pans, which reflect more of the heat. This will help your baking to cook a little more evenly instead of darkening too quickly on the outside.

Where did my strawberries go?...I followed the recipe exactly.  I used 2 aluminum bread pans.  It took about 1&1/2 hours to finish baking in the center.  The strawberries vanished after it baked and I wish I had doubled them. I could barely taste them The bread was also overpowered by the cinnamon.  Next time I will double the strawberries and cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon.

Yummmmmmmmm!!!  Changes made, based on previous reviews:  4 c strawberries, decrease sugar to 1 1/2 cups, decrease cinnamon to 1/2 TBSP, add 1 tsp vanilla, use 3/4 c applesauce for half of the oil.  I also used 2 c all-purpose flour and 1 1/8 c whole wheat flour.  BONUS:  When the bread is warm, spread on homemade strawberry butter:  Blend together 1 stick butter, softened + 1-2 tsp powdered sugar + 3 strawberries.  Great recipe!

I give this 4 stars as written.  Based on previous reviews, I doubled the strawberries (sliced some, chopped some and pureed some); cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups (1/2 c over the strawberries and mixed 1 c with the dry ingredients); added 1 tsp of vanilla extract; cut back on the cinnamon some and omitted the pecans.  I baked it in a bunt pan at 325 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours - kept checking it until it was slightly golden and toothpick came out clean.  I brought it to a potluck with Cool Whip on the side and received raving compliments.  You could really taste the strawberries, it was super moist and not overly sweet - it was perfect :)

I thought this was delicious and will add to my recipe box!! I did make the following changes to make it 5 stars and a little healthier: I doubled the amount of starwberries; used 1/2 whole wheat floue and 1/2 white; used 1/2 the amount of oil called for and substituted applesauce for the rest. Also, i split up the batter and added  1 cup pecans to one loaf and 1 cup chocolate chips to the other. Thank you for the yummy recipe!! Oh - I used fresh strawberries!!

MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!

I read all the previous reviews before I made this and with a few adjustments, it was FABULOUS.

1.  Put all dry ingredients + 1/2 bag white chocolate chips in the food processor and chop on high till the chips are gone.

2.  Use TWICE the strawberries and puree them in the food processor.

3.  Cover the top of the batter with a coat of sugar for a muffin-like top crust.

4.  Cook for about 60 min - 75 min.

Delish!! I coarse chopped the strawberries (increased to 3 cups as suggested)in the food processor, I then added only 1 1/2 cups sugar to the berries, stirred well and let it sit while I prepared the other ingredients. Batter was not thick as stated in previous reviews so I was a little worried.  Baked in a Bundt pan for 1 hour 10 minutes.  Perfect!  Great recipe!! THANKS!!

Ohmigosh!! This was fabulous!! I had 36 oz. of strawberries going ripe very quickly and didn't want to make anything fancy, so I check A.R. and found this simple recipe. I doubled the recipe, getting four loaves worth. The only adaptions I made were to subtract 1 c. white flour and use 1 c. whole wheat flour, giving it a more healthful twist. And...I didn't feel like cutting up the strawberries, so I threw them in the blender and made a puree, using that instead of chunks. The bread turned out light and fluffy and just delightful to snack on. The recipe was a HUGE hit!!

Great recipe!  I made this with whole wheat flour subbed for the AP flour, applesauce subbed for the oil, egg substitute for the eggs, and used half real sugar half Splenda.  The healther version turned out just as well as it had the first time when I made it with the "regular" ingredients!  I also popped in a few overripe bananas in addition to the strawberries.  Cooked it cake-style in a 9x13 and it turned out just fine.

I love this bread. I've made it many times and get rave compliments. I always use a whole package of strawberries, putting 3/4 of them in the food processor and then slicing up the rest. Also, I use strawberry applesauce in place of the oil. Make sure you get the no sugar added variety! It really helps make it more healthy. 

This bread is done with a toothpick inserted in the cracks on the top of the bread come out mostly clean. It's wonderful served with a homemade cinnamon cream cheese spread, which consists of cream cheese, white sugar to tase, cinnamon to taste, and a splash of powdered sugar & milk. Yum!

I just made this for the first time and I love it!  I substituted 1 cup of oats for one of the cups of flour, and I put in some nutmeg and about 1/2 cup of extra strawberries.  It's delicious!  I might sprinkle some powdered sugar on it or drizzle some glaze though...looks plain if you want to bring it somewhere.

I had extra strawberries to use...quick.  I tried this recipe b/c I had everything on hand.  I was sure I had left out a liquid ingredient b/c the batter was so thick and stiff - so I had doubts.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by a WONDERFUL breakfast bread.  It is delicious.  I left the recipe alone and tried it as-is.  I gave four stars b/c as good as it was, I would add more strawberries to it next time, but leave the rest alone.  The only change I did make was to extend the cooking time for another 20 minutes.  It didn't change the color of the bread or burn it - JUST RIGHT.  Such a great addition to my recipe box!!  Thanks for sharing it.

I used only 1/4 of the oil and the rest I used regular applesauce. I also only used 1/2 of the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. I also only used 1 teaspoon of cincinamon. Very moist but I do agree strawberries do not leave a lot of flavor but I still liked it well enough I would make it again. BUT I would puree some of the strawberries and add it as a liquid to boost the flavor a little.

Really good - much better than what I expected. I know that this already had good reviews, but for some reason, I didn't really think I would like it. I was wrong. It's very moist and has great flavor. I made half the recipe for one loaf. Based on the other reviews, I gathered that it could use more strawberries, but since i didn't have extra, I let them sit with 2 Tbsp of preserves instead of sugar, hoping that would make the strawberry flavor stronger. I also used 1/4 cup of oil and skipped the cinnamon. I would make it exactly like that again because it was perfect.

I followed many of the recommendations of other reviewers.  I sliced my strawberries first, and added a combination of sugar/confectioners sugar so that a juice would be made.  Then I used 1 1/2 cups of those sliced strawberries in syrup and pureed another cup of the strawberries in juice.  I added walnuts and it was delicious.  I've been asked by 3 people already for the recipe.  I made it in a bundt pan instead of the 9 inch loaf pans.  Can't wait to make again!

This is one of the fruit breads that I make in small heart-shaped muffin pans and freeze for a quick breakfast for my granddaughter. Just take it out of the freezer and pop it in the microwave a few sec and its like it just came out of the oven. I cut the cinnamon down to 1 1/2 tsp for her tastes but I love it with the full amount. When fresh strawberries aren't in season, I use frozen. It doesn't look as pretty but still tastes good. I also use 3 cups of strawberries and 1/2 tsp of strawberry extract. Very easy and yummy recipe. Thank you Ellen, you've made breakfast much easier and faster.

I REALLY liked this bread...but I did make a few changes including cutting it down to one loaf. I made sure to still add 4 cups of very ripe strawberries (2 cups purred and 2 cups diced) and sprinkled all with sugar. I then used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. Baking for 45 mins is perfect and this is one of the best breakfast breads ever!

This bread was good, I didn't have quite the full amount of nuts so I added some unsweetened flaked coconut and the flavor was great!  Mine took muvh longer to bake (over an hour) than the recipe said.

Ugh. I've made this twice and it's just not good at all. Like MANY other reviewers, mine would not get done in the middle.  I left the bread in the oven about 20 extra minutes, and now the edges are hard.:-( The bread is also not sweet enough...it needs some vanilla flavoring or something as well as more sugar. I wasted a LOT of fresh strawberries on this...twice.  I won't do it again. Ally

I absolutely love this recipe. I have found that dicing the strawberries instead of slicing them makes them more consistent throughout the bread. I've also learned that fresh strawberries must be used - it's not the same with frozen strawberries!

This was very good, a nice change from the usual banana bread! I replaced about half the flour with whole wheat flour and it worked out great.

I made this, but I doubled the amount of fresh strawberries, left out the nuts, and cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 TBSP.  The result was heavenly!  I will certainly make this again!

This bread is awesome, everyone loves it, I have found that I need to cook it on a lower temperature and for longer in order for the bread to get cooked through. I have made it with both fresh strawberries and defrosted strawberries and its great either way.

I used whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose and chopped the strawberries with a food chopper, so the pieces were small, but not pureed.  I baked one loaf of bread and used the rest of the batter for mini muffins for the kids. We all loved it!

Did frozen strawberries (3 cups somewhat thawed and sliced and well sugared), 1/2 tbsp. cinnamon and 1 1/2 tbsp. vanilla. This is really good.

Very good! I agree with most of the reviewers, it does need double the strawberries. OR, half strawberries/half fresh raspberries or rhubarb would make this a 5 star recipe. Sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking and have a crust with a bit of sweet crunch!

I made this bread for dessert for a dinner party, and it flew off the dish! Everybody loved it, and I ended up having to write the recipie for a few guests. I also added more strawberries to the batter, gave it a more "strawberry" taste. We topped it with cream cheese or butter, and had no leftovers!

So good. I did 2 different things... I subbed 2 eggs with flaxseed & used subbed in 1 full cup of whole wheat flour (I used the rest white flour). I only got to have 1 slice. My neighbor, DH, & DS at it all!

I had my reservations about making this bread, but I had 1/2 flat of strawberries that were very ripe, and needed something to do with them.... What a delicious recipe! The bread was moist, and the strawberries were perfect... I cut each strawberry in 8 pieces.. worried that 1/4 would be too big... I doubt it. A wonderful cake that is permanently added to my recipe collection! YUM!

I've made this twice and it is so good!! I sent a loaf home with my parents and my mother called the next day for the recipe. I did find that it took much longer to bake. At least 20-30 min longer. My mom found this also when she made it.

Only 4 stars because I strayed from the original recipe. This bread was delicious and will be such a nice addition to my recipe collection. I made the following changes: I used 1 cup of white sugar and one cup brown sugar. I used the full amount of cinnamon and would not recommend dispensing with it. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup. Instead of putting sugar on the sliced berries, I added a 12 oz jar of fresh homemade strawberry freezer jam which I made days before without any preservatives -- just strawberries & sugar (moderate amount of sugar -- not as much as most recipes call for but certainly sweet) mashed together by hand WITHOUT sure gel or any other congealing agent so it had some juiciness to it. It took my bread at least 60 minutes in a new, higher-end convection oven. The result was hunks of strawberry and a lovely cinnamon flavor which combined with the brown sugar made the base of the bread taste really good all by itself. Thanks for the recipe inspiration!

Outstanding! I made it with frozen strawberries. Thawed them then patted them dry and tossed them with a big of flour before adding to the mix. Outstanding bread! Don't omit the pecans and definitely use pecans vs another nut. Almonds just aren't the same. Thank you for this, Ellen!!!!!

OMG this is just amazing! At the advice of others, I also halved the sugar, replaced the oil with apple sauce, and used 1/4 cup olive oil, and in the end decided to make a streusel topping with flour, butter, oats and cinnamon which I crumbled on top.  I also made a strawberry butter which really added to the recipe. Since I am gluten sensitive, next time I'll try it with almond or rice flour. Wonder if anyone here has? Anyway, one loaf was already gobbled up by my family, and 2nd one is rapidly disappearing.  This would be perfect for brunch or as a favorite snack. Forgot to mention but I baked for 63 min. Anyway, try it, you won't regret it!

I have made this twice and I love the flavor but I can't seem to get it done in the middle. I think it may be I'm using too small of a loaf pan. The second time I increased the cooking time and that didn't help. I love it so I am going to try again using a larger pan. Also I omit the pecans due to a nut allergy. This is a delicious bread.

I thought this bread was awful. The strawberries turn to mush when baked, therefore making the bread around them mushy. The bread has way to much oil in it too. Before I even made this, I couldn't see how it would turn out any good, given the combination of ingredients. But decided to try it as it looked quick and easy to throw together and I had all the ingredients on hand. I should have trusted my instincts.

This made excellent muffins; filled the cups almost full & baked 25 minutes per batch (2 dozen muffins).  I also used a full pound of berries.  Definitely a winner!

Excellent!  At the advice of other reviewers, I used 4 cups of strawberries (2 diced & 2 smooshed), 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I baked in a bundt pan for 65 minutes and it was perfect!  Remember to let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning out - I couldn't wait and lost a few pieces as they stuck to the pan (it's okay though, it just gave me a sneak taste before my husband could cut a slice!).  UPDATE: I have to re-review this.  My daughter and I made this as written (halved to yield one loaf) and it is perfect as-is, no modifications needed!

This was the best bread I've made in a long time.  I took other reveiws in mind and used 4 cups of strawberries, 1 1/2 cups of sugar and little less cinnamon.  It was perfect!!  My husband loved it.  He had it warm with some honey and he thought it was the best.  I will definetly be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

This was very good. I tasted it while it was still warm and immediately brought some to my grandmother so she could taste it. I used 2 full pints of strawberries, but adding more berries didn't ruin the bread. I used splenda instead of sugar and applesauce in place of oil, and it came out great. The only thing was that it had the splenda after taste, so next time I will do half sugar and half splenda.

Delicious!  After reading other reviews, I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups, baked it in a bundt, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and substituted 1/2 cup of unsalted butter for the oil.  I made it more cake like and fluffy by creaming the sugar, eggs, oil and butter together first and then adding the dry ingredients until just mixed.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it and it's excellent way to use leftover strawberries.

I, too, used 1 pound of strawberries, but I  sugared them overnight. After sugaring overnight, I pureed about one cup of the berry and juice muxture. It made the bread far more strawberry-flavored.

I also sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on top, and added some allspice in with the dry ingredients. The bread came out well, nice and moist. My silicone loaf pan needed an extra 20 minutes of baking time, but my metal loaf pan baked right up in 50 minutes.

Good recipe, took FOREVER to bake in a bundt pan. I used a full pound of ripe strawberries pureed with about 1/2 cup of sugar, but would have liked a stronger flavor. My husband said it was just right with some melted butter on top.
I also followed one of the other reviewers suggestions and dusted the pan with powdered sugar instead of flour which made a sweet crust on the outside of the bread, great idea!

I thought this was very good and 3 out of 4 of my kids did, too. I doubled the strawberries as another reviewer suggested, and used walnut meal instead of pecans (my kids don't like to notice the nuts). The cinnamon flavor was very pronounced. Next time I might cut that back a bit to emphasize the strawberry flavor.

I had never heard of straberry bread until I found this recipe.  I had a bunch of strawberries to use up & this was perfect!  All I did was double the berries & cook it in a bundt pan for 90 mins.

This was okay, but next time I will double the strawberries.  I've made strawberry bread before using another recipe and could definitely smell the strawberries throughout the house.  When I couldn't smell this one as well, I knew there weren't enough.  This was further confirmed when I tasted it.  I substituted applesauce for half the oil--following others recommendations--and I can't say I missed the oil at all!  
One other thing . . . I had to cook this for at least 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it came out really moist.  I doubled the amount of strawberries - blended 75% and chopped the rest so that I'd have strawberry taste throughout the bread and also have nice beautiful chunks visible when I cut into it. I also used half the sugar so it came out less sweet and more subtle which I prefer.

I halved this recipe but kept the full amount of strawberries; this was a good ratio.  Also reduced the oil to 1/2 cup (so 1 cup if I were making the full recipe).  Very cinnamony; might consider toning that down a bit next time.

My husband and 2 yr old loved this!!  I followed the directions exactly minus the nuts (husband wont eat anything iwth nuts).  My husband is in to weight lifting and wantd me to experiment with putting protein powder in it.  I made 1 loaf just like the receipe then I put 1 scope of vanilla protein and about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract in the other 1/2 of the batter and made mini-loaves.   They loved it!!  (I didn't try either because I don't like strawberries so I can only go by what they said and the fact all the bread is gone)

Loved this bread.  I halved the recipe to one loaf and now wish I would have kept it the same.  I used some whole wheat flour (half a cup to the one cup in the halved recipe) and it worked out great!  Also my husband doesn't eat nuts so I just sprinkle them on half the bread when poured in the pan.  This is delicious...thanks!

Dense would be the first thing I think of when I eat this.  I read a lot of reviews (good and bad) before I tackled this bread.  I doubled the strawberries, sliced half and pureed half after they sat in the sugar.  I added a splash of strawberry flavoring and even after that I didn't taste a lot of strawberry.  
To combat the interior texture problems I used 1/2c oil, 1/4 sour cream and one suuuuuuuuuuuuuper ripe banana for sweetness.  You couldn't taste either the sour cream or banana in the bread but it made it moist without being runny.  I also baked in dark metal loaf pans with a sheet of foil on top.  I think I baked it for 65 minutes (I kept resetting my timer and losing track) but when it passed the toothpick test it came out clean and not overdone.  The taste is good, but heavy, and the texture was great: crisp edges without being chewy, and soft center with bits of juicy strawberry here and there.  I might cut down the nuts next time because they seem to take center stage in this bread.

Excellent bread, although I was hoping for a stronger strawberry flavor.  I did double the strawberries and cut the cinnamon and also increased the baking time.  Very moist and overall a success.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow.    This was a great way to use fresh strawberries.     I used the recipe as written as a base.    I added more strawberries, a little vanilla flavoring, and decreased the oil to 1 cup then added 2 small jars of straw/banana baby food.     The baby food is the trick.    I have been using it in banana bread and it really adds flavor and moisture.     Try this bread.    It is delicious!

This is very good, but as written I think it would be too sweet.  It was plenty sweet enough for me w/1.5 cups of sugar.  At the advice of others, I doubled the amount of strawberries, added 1 tsp of vanilla, decreased the cinnamon to 1 tsp (A TBSP would overpower the flavor of strawberry IMO), decreased the oil to 2/3-3/4 cup and made the flour about 1/2 whole wheat flour.  It's delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  I love nuts, but it could do without them and be just fine.  I would like an even more strawberry taste.  I might even try it w/more strawberries.

changes made for a HEALTHY, AMAZING STRAWBERRY BREAD RECIPE: 4 cups of strawberries, 1.5 cups of sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup applesauce (instead of oil), 5 egg whites and 1 egg yolk (instead of 4 whole eggs), and omit the pecans, if desired. It was sooo yummy with these changes. I used a bundt pan though, and I had to almost double the baking time. Personally, I like to eat it cold. When it first came out of the oven, I tried it and I thought the strawberries were too sour when they are hot, but the next day after refrigerating it, it was amazing!! The whole family loved it! I'm making this again next week for a potluck and I think I'll put chocolate icing on it with sliced strawberries and bananas on top. :D

This is a very good recipe. I followed others' reviews and substituted 1 c. unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 c. oil (using 1/4 c. oil). I used probably 3-4 cups diced strawberries and put about 1/4 c. sugar on them while preparing the other ingredients. I reduced the sugar by about 1/3 c. I also added vanilla and just a few dashes of cinnamon. My big twist was adding milk chocolate chips to the recipe (about 3/4 bag). I love chocolate covered strawberries and though that the chocolate would make for a decadent bread - and I was right! I also baked for about 50 minutes in a bundt pan. Will definitely make again!

This is great. I have a really good banana bread that I usually make, but now my hubby likes this better. I've already made it twice this week. I did make a few changes as per other reviews. I substituted half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce one time and all of the oil with applesauce another time. Equally as good. I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the strawberries and diced them. I sprinkled brown sugar and oats on top before baking for presentation. Next time I might try a streusel topping. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

This smelled soooooo good baking. I was not disapointed with the taste either. Skipped the pecans for this one. The instructions could have been a little more detailed (note that you're adding the REMAINING sugar to the dry mixture, not 2 cups) but everything worked fine. I added about an extra 1/2 pint of strawberries to this. I may try with strawberry extract next time.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added more strawberries (4 1/2 c.) and I chopped them into quarters rather than slices. I also pureed half of the strawberries and cut down the oil to 3/4 c. A few other changes that I did was to add only 1 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of the full amount of white and I omitted the nuts this time around. My husband and daughter love it, it's got a sweet, caramel taste from the brown sugar and ripe berries. I think I'll add nuts next time for more texture, otherwise I liked it too.

My family and I love this bread!! I just made it last night(started my holiday baking) and we ate almost a whole loaf right from the oven. It's sooo good!! It makes for a great Christmas treat! I make this every years as gifts and everyone loves it!! It's such a nice departure from banana bread~everyone makes that :) Two things I do differently...I use 2-10 ounce containers of frozen sweetened strawberries defrosted and I only use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. You must try this, you won't be disappointed :)

This was great ... thanks!  I used applesauce for the oil and added chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  A repeat for sure!

What a wonderful and easy bread! I didn't have any freash strawberries so I used thawed frozen berries. I sliced them up and removed most of the juice but left maybe 1/4 cup. I decreased the oil to 1 cup due to the liquid in the strawberries. Perfect! Just the right sweetness and so moist! Thank you for the fabulous recipe, it will be a regular in our home!

I made a dozen muffins and one loaf with my first batch and they were fabulous! I omitted the nuts (mainly because I forgot I used the end of my supply making coffee cake!), but I can only imagine it would make this recipe better. 

I will definitely be making these again in a large quantity for freezing when I see strawberries cheap! 

5 stars for great taste and as easy as you can get for a wonderful bread/muffin recipe!

A tasty bread, easy and moist.  The flavor is very mild.  A good use, though, of strawberries just past their prime.

I made a whole wheat version of this bread, and turned it into muffins. They smelled amazing.

I halved the recipe, used whole wheat flour (king arthur's), added only 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of almond extract.

Beautiful and delicious aroma!

I just made this bread in a desperate attempt to use up what left of 5 pounds of fresh berries.  A total and utter waste of the berries - the people who say their bread doesn't cook through are dead on accurate.  I figured the problem was a bit too much oil and sugaring the berries after slicing, so I cut down to 1 cup oil and just sliced the berries.  Still a great big no-go.  I left them for over an hour, and at 75 minutes cut my losses - pulled them out of the oven with overcooked edges and ooey-gooey middles.  Just gross.

I obviously did something wrong here. Because I feel like I wasted not only my strawberries, but my time. I followed others advice and used applesauce and cut down on the oil and added more strawberries. It is just to bland, not at all as I was expecting. Again maybe I did something wrong, but I am not gonna try this one again to find out if it was me or the recipe.

Went to the strawberry festival in Arroyo Grande, Ca. and came home with a ton of strawberries.  I did as others suggested and increased the strawberries to 3 cups and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and reduced the cinnamon to half a tablespoon.  I also had trouble getting it to cook in the middle (I lost track of how long I had to bake it!!!) but it was still really good, especially warm.  I buttered and sugared my pan so it had a wonderful light crust on it.  I will bake it again I just wish I knew how to get it to cook in the middle!!!

I cooked and cooked and cooked the bread until the top was burnt and the inside STILL wasn't cooked through.  I was able to find a dry spot on the end to try to see how it would have tasted had I been able to eat the rest.  Not bad, but I couldn't even taste the strawberries.  This might make a good muffin mix, but the inside didn't get cooked in a bread pan.

Very tasty bread.  It is a sweet, but not too sweet bread.  A great recipe with lots of flavor that you do not have to put jelly/jam or butter on it...I just eat it by itself!  I've made it several times for my family and co-workers.  Everyone really enjoys it.

I liked this recipe, but I will add more strawberries next time.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of the oil with strawberry applesauce.  I used almonds instead of pecans and added almond extract.

I've made this 3 times so far, once I used more cinnamon than the recipe asked for (by mistake) and applesauce instead of the oil(each time), it was fabulous.  A second time I made it w/ the correct amount of cinnamon and it was good.  The third time I tried more strawberries as some have suggested and found it too sweet for my tastes.  I'll go back to the extra cinnamon.  Still an easy recipe and very good and moist.

This was the biggest food crime (and waste of organic strawberries) I've ever committed, and I'm definitely glad I didn't make both loaves that the recipe actually calls for you to make. Cinnamon with strawberries...? Gut reaction was "ew," but I gave it a shot, but this "strawberry" "loaf" was a complete flop. Don't waste the berries; use apples instead, because you can't taste a single berry in this. Berries end up making a soggy perforated mess of the bread. I gave it a two only because 1.) it was still edible, and 2.) not considered a poison by the AAPCC, but overall the texture and flavor make this not worth a remake...or even an initial make if I could go back in time.

This is really good strawberry bread. I used 4 cups of strawberries and I'm glad I did. I made it in a bundt pan only because I had to transport it and carrying it in a cake holder made it easier. I will make this again.

This is a wonderful bread. I did make a few changes. I only used 
1 1/2 C sugar I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and only 3/4 C. veg oil and 3 Cups of strawberries. Also instead of two loaf pans I used one bundt pan. I used no stick cooking spay in the pan instead of butter then instead of flouring it I used powered sugar. I have a small shaker thingy with small holes that I keep powdered sugar in and it has a lid on it so I always have it handy that way I don't get flour on things that should have something sweet. I mashed up some of the strawberries to get some juice. I cooked it for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was really wonderful. I took a kitchen dinner knife and kinda loosened it a bit around put a dinner plate on top turned it over and poof it came out onto the plate with no problem. The nuts were great all was wonderful.

I made the recipe as is but didn't have pecans on hand so replaced them cup-for-cup with chocolate chips. It's like chocolate covered strawberries in a bread. Fantastic!

Made this recipe exactly as posted the first time. It was great, but a little on the dry side.  Next time I reduced the oil to one cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce. It was more moist.  I now use this as my basic bread recipe, and switch up the fruit. I have made banana-strawberry bread, banana bread and pumpkin bread so far! Thanks for this great basic and adaptable recipe!

YUM! very easy and deelish. I cut the recipe in half (all but the berries)for me and my husband. The extra berries made it nice and moist. Strawberries are out of season so they were not sweet so adding the sugar helped with that.  I love easy recipes like this, next time I will try it with other fruit like pineapple or blueberries. I will make this over and over.

I did a search for strawberry bread because I had a carton that was going to go bad if I didn't use them. This was a great recipe, I made one large loaf instead of 2 smaller ones and it came out great using the same temp just longer time. I wanted to add a crumble to the top so in a small mixing bowl I mixed about 2 tablespoons of unmade instant maple/brown sugar oatmeal, about a teaspoon of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. I sprinkled it over the top just before baking it and it gave it a nice crust on top.

This was excellent. Very moist. Used extra strawberries, along with some vanilla and strawberry extracts. Both loaves a hit at my potluck and quickly disappeared.

This was delicious!! Even my picky 2-year-old gobbled it down! I think next time I might experiment in trying to reduce the sugar and oil content in this recipe, but as is it tastes great and the crust is delicious.

I really enjoyed this.  It can go with coffee for breakfast or be a dessert.  I will probably adjust the cooking temperature next time becasue at 40 minutes the outside was perfectly cooked but the middle was slightly under cooked.

I took advice of the most helpful reviews and added more berries and reduced sugar and cinnamon and oil, and it was very bland.  Next time I will do original recipe, and see if it is 5 star worthy.  Giving it 4 stars now until I try it again.

I followed Amy's suggestions (added 4 cups of strawberries: 2-pureed and 2 sliced), cut the oil down to 3/4 cup, and only used 1.5 cups sugar). I was very happy with the recipe - you can really taste the strawberries! Thanks Ellen and Amy!

From my 8 year old daughter - "My story is I wanted to bake my own strawberry bread recipe so my parents told me to look on the computer for a recipe.  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  And I have to say that this is the best bread I ever ate.  I would rate this a million stars if it was possible." I agree - it was very good.  Lots of cinnamon flavor and not too sweet.  We will definitely make it again!

In reality, this is a 4/5 only because I am in agreement with many others.  It needs more strawberry.  If the original recipe had more strawberry, it would have been perfect.  I think the 1-1/4 cup of pecans is sufficient.  I'd say that strawberry chunks is the way to go and not a liquefied form because the beauty of this recipe is that the chunks of strawberry are really mini blasts of flavor.  I ended up doing about 2.5 cups of strawberry's instead of 2 cups and I can easily see doing 4 cups next time around.  I might cut the sugar, but just by a little bit.  Strawberry's and Pecans can be expensive together though so I am considering the addition of raisins in addition to strawberries next time around.  The raisins would be for a little extra kick so maybe just 1/4 or 1/2 cup of raisins.  Enough to add a little kick but not overpower the taste of strawberries.

This bread was great and made a low-fat version by substituting applesauce instead of oil , egg whites instead of eggs and half splenda half sugar. Bread came out super moist and you couldn't tell it was a lower fat version , thanks for the recipe

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using raspberries instead of strawberries..simply because I had so many. My husband takes a slice every morning to work and says it's great with a cup of coffee. Thanks for sharing!

Good, not great. There were so many reviews that advised various modifications to this recipe that I just made it as originally called for. It came out just fine.   Don't reinvent the wheel on this one, it's satisfactory as is.

I was a bit worried about how the bread was going to turn out, I thought it would be really mushy. To my surprise it turned out very nice, my family really enjoyed it. The recipe itself is easy to follow, and my bread acutally looked like the pictures posted when done.  Thanks for posting,  I will be making this again.

I cut this recipe in half. I used half whole wheat flour, half the sugar called for, used applesauce in place of the vegetable oil and half blueberries because I didn't have quite enough strawberries. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. If I hadn't smushed my strawberries, there wouldn't have been near enough liquid to make these muffins. I had to add 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk to get them to muffin-batter consistancy. I really don't know how everyone else got this to turn out without the extra liquid. The end result was nice, though. The smell of these is really out of this world while they were baking. I think if I make this again, I would double the strawberries at least and use a cup of puree like others had before me.

I thought this bread was pretty dry.  My bread recipes usually have butter in them, so maybe that was the problem.  It would be good with a little customizing.

I added a cup of pureed strawberries and a cup of oatmeal and it was awesome!  I did take about 1 hour and 10 min to bake though so not sure about that, but overall a very good recipe!

Excellent and easy.  I used two cups of strawberrys and tossed in half a cup of pineapple chunks because I needed to get rid of them and it tastes great.  I changed nothing except for baking it in a bundt pan for 60 minutes because I don't have to 9x5 loaf pans.  It is delicious!

This recipe is great, I also altered it a bit. I crushed one cup of the strawberries up mixed with sugar then diced the other cup. Also as suggested I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c, used a little less cinnamon, some vanilla, used one cup of oil and 1/2 c applesauce. Also toasted the peacans and added a cup of blueberries with the last step. Awesome results!

I lost my notes on what changes to make per the suggestions of the other reviews and I made this as the recipe stated.  I ended up throwing it in the trash.  CUT THE SUGAR, by at least half.  Making adjustments will help but if you are rating this recipe written as is, then it is horrible.

Yum-ee. Husband and I both loved this. I couldn't stop going back for "just another half slice." Modifications made: 3 1/4 C strawberries. (One frozen bag of whole strawberries, 2/3 sliced, 1/3 diced.) 1 3/4 C sugar. 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Same amount of oil, but subbed 1/2 C no sugar added applesauce for that much oil. That's it. Really, the changes were so small I doubt they were needed, except for the applesauce for health sake, and the strawberries. Even adding 3 1/4 cup of sliced/diced strawberries wasn't enough to give it a real strong strawberry flavor. May try adding more, but I think it just may be one of those things that you either accept, or the solution is much more crafty than I'm capable of. (Strawberry applesauce was a good idea- but I didn't see any at my store.) I may want more strawberry flavor, but this was pretty fantastic anyway.

I cut the oil down to 1cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used about 3 cups of berries. I made them as muffins and they are great I would prefer a more strawberry taste (maybe some strawberry flavoring or strawberry jello).

This is SO good!  I used frozen strawberries and just chopped them up.  I also reduced cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp based on reviews that it was a little strong.  Tastes perfect to me!  I also used half whole wheat and half white flour.

Made this recipe twice.  Used mini muffins and a loaf for the first go around.  Yum.  Only gave four stars because I made it again and used a bunt pan and this recipe turned out thick and heavy!  Better in smaller baking portions.

This was delicious! I made the whole recipe, and brought the extra loaf to work... everyone can't stop eating it! I almost regret bringing it in! lol. I did make a few changes, some not entirely on purpose. I doubled the strawberries based on others reviews, and mixed 1 cup of sugar into half and mushed it up with a fork. The rest I set to the side to fold in at the end. I used 1 cup of sweetened applesauce instead of oil (ran out of oil), and left out any more sugar. I used 1 tsp of cinnamon rather than what was called for, and added 1 tsp of vanilla for flavor. The end result was great! It turned out with a banana bread type texture. I didn't end up with any problems about it not cooking, though I did add an extra 10 minutes to be sure. I recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again!

Okay but not a keeper.  As per other reviewers, I increased the amount of strawberries and added vanilla.  The bread falls apart very easily.  And the taste is merely okay.  Thanks anyway.

I'm not really sure what happened. I halved the recipe since I only wanted one loaf, but it didn't turn out very well. My cook time was over an hour and it STILL wasn't done in the middle. I finally just took it out. After letting it cool, I tasted it and it tasted pretty good, but it was dry from having spent so much time in the oven. It's almost as if I should have used an 8x8 pan instead of a loaf pan. It was a pretty decent bread overall, but I don't think I'll be trying it again. Good luck to the rest of you!

Yummy! I followed some other reviews, doubled amount of strawberries, used unsweeten applesauce instead of oil. Bake in a bundt pan, coated the pan with cinnamon/sugar not flour. Everyone enjoyed it. They liked adding fruit salsa (used recipe from this site) & cool whip on top. Thanks for the recipe to help use up lots of strawberries:)

I normally don't add to so many reviews, but here goes. Definitely add more strawberries. I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice and vanilla each. I  used 1 Cup of Splenda to replace the sugar. Instead of white flour I used a combination of soy, whey protein, and whole wheat. I processed the strawberries and walnuts (not pecans).It tasted like a mild fruit bread and not like health food.

This is a wonderful way to use fresh strawberries during the summer months.  Two of my co-workers only tasted a small piece
of this and they both immediately wanted the recipe.  The longer the bread sits the better it tastes too.  The only thing I changed was instead of dusting the pans with flour I used sugar.  Definitely will make this again and again

I made this recipe last night and it was pretty good. I used 2 cups of strawberries and two ripe bananas. I also sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top prior to baking. It came out pretty good, and I am sure with all strawberries it would have been better. The loaves looked like they were sinking in the middle but they eventually evened out. Perfect amount of sweetness and very moist. It did take a bit longer somewhere around an hour and 20 minutes. I would make this again.

I used some of the sugestions of previous raters. I used the half bag of white chocolate, and cooked the bread for 65 minutes. My mom made Strawberry Bread when I grew up so I was used to the chunks of strawberries in it, but I was not sure how my family would react so I pureed half of the strawberries and left the rest in chunks. My family really liked it. I used a little less oil then the recipe called for next time I think I will use the full amount. I will definatley be making this again!

This was a super way to use up my garden's berries!  I made this 3 times in the past month!  The only changes I made were: adding 4 c. of strawberries, leaving out the nuts, and I'm not sure on the overall baking time but it was pretty long; I just kept an eye on it!  I really appreciate this recipes- I love having a way to use my berries!  Thanks!

This was delicious.  I received a lot of compliments on this recipe.  I added 3 cups of strawberries but next time I think I will add 4 cups.  You also have to let it cook a lot longer than stated but I think that is because of the extra strawberries.  The next time I make this, I will make one loaf with the nuts and one without because my kids were not fond of the nuts.

What a great recipe. Very easy, and very tasty! Per other's comments, I increased the amount of strawberries (5 cups of sliced berries for three loaves). I also used walnuts instead of pecans. Cook time was definitely longer than stated - I cooked my loaves about and hour and 20 minutes. Still, a great treat and an easy way to use up an overabundance of berries!

I make this bad boy EVERY Christmas. The only down side to this as a holiday treat is that it is expensive. Fresh (out of season) strawberries are pricey yet make the best choice. You can get by with frozen. I buy my strawberries in the summer and freeze 'em. 

In any event, this dish rocks!

My young daughter made this for a home-ec assignment, and it turned out beautifully.  It tasted great.  We used frozen strawberries, and more than what the recipe called for.

Wow, this bread is fantastic!  I used the batter to make both loaves and muffins.  I think the muffins turned out a little heartier.  You can make 12 Texas muffins out of one batch of the batter, just be sure to adjust the cooking time to 25-30 minutes.  I'm just sorry that strawberry season is almost over.

Good recipe! Although I did make some changes like other reviews suggested. 3/4 cup oil, some vanilla and puréed half of the strawberries. But otherwise followed recipe, recommend.

Love making this bread! My boyfriends coworkers request it often because it is so delicious. I usually use 3 cups of frozen strawberries, but I keep them partially frozen and add them as the last ingredient instead of following the directions. Turns out amazing!

After reading several reviews I took into consideration a few of the changes that were recommended. I used 4 cups of strawberries, used 1/2 of the oil called for & substituted unsweetened Apple sauce for the rest, cut down the cinnamon to 1/2 tbsp, added 1tsp vanilla extract and lastly I used a bundt pan instead of the loaf pan, I did add 20 mins to the cooking time, sprinkled powdered sugar on top after it cooled & after all the changes it came out delicious. I will definitely be making this again, this will be a good addition to bake sales!

Delicious recipe! I used coconut oil and reduced it down to 3/4 of a cup, used cane sugar instead of white sugar, and I didn't have an fresh strawberries so I used some frozen ones. I let them thaw out before I began making the batter. I used two cups of pureed strawberries, as someone suggested, and sliced two more cups of strawberries. Delicious and perfectly moist bread! I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe worked out perfectly! I took others' advice and made a couple of modifications. I reduced the granulated sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I tossed the berries (which I cut up into large chunks) with a couple of tablespoons granulated sugar. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, shook in a scant amount of cinnamon, and changed the oil to all unsweetened applesauce. I also added my secret ingredient: 2/3 cup strawberry jam that adds to the taste of strawberries. I also sprinkled the top with a package of apple/cinnamon Quaker instant oatmeal. I baked them in my Pampered Chef mini loaf pan (and they rose beautifully so I'm glad I used it). It took over an hour, but they came out perfect! My son ate half a loaf shortly after they came out of the oven. I have an apple bread recipe that mixes similar to this, so I wasn't worried when I saw that it wasn't a liquidy batter. You just need to make sure you mix it together really well to get all the flour added. Will definitely make this again!

I read the reviews and made the suggested adjustments. This bread was excellent, especially after sitting overnight. I double the berries to 4C. I mashed up half with some sugar, & left half sliced. I also added some of the sugar to the sliced berries. I cut the total sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. I added a snack size applesauce & reduced the oil to 3/4C.  I cut the cinnamon in half also, per suggestions. I used walnuts, since that is what I had on hand, & baked in a bundt pan. I thought that was an excellent suggestion. I baked it for approx 65 minutes. After cooling for about 20 minutes, it came out of the pan beautifully. I sprinkled with a little powdered sugar. I took for the ladies at my Pilates studio today, & it was a big success!

After reading several of the reviews, I decided to make a few changes. I did double the amount of strawberries; 2 cups sliced and 2 cups mashed. I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. I added the 1/2 cup of sugar to the strawberries and let them sit while I prepared the rest of the batter; then I added the 1 cup to the batter. I cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tbsp and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. For the oil, I did 1 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of applesauce. I omitted the pecans. I baked it at 350 degrees in bundt pan for an hour. It came out beautifully with a wonderful crust and the cake itself was moist and delicious! Huge hit! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is absolutely AMAZING. I cut the recipe in half to make only one loaf - BIG mistake! The only changes I made were: I used coconut oil and a TBSP of sour cream instead of vegetable oil, and I added vanilla extract to the strawberries. I must say I was doubtful when I put the dough in the pan - it was just so doughy - But it came out great and I'll be making it again and again!

this not work for me. I have baked many types of breads but this was a complete flop. Followed the recipe but as  others recommended i added an extra cup of strawberrys.  The bread did not rise well and it was very heavy yet mushy. And all my ingredients were fresh. I had just made strawberry cupcakes and they were fantastic, a different recipe not on this site.

I was looking for a different recipe to use up some past their prime strawberries.  I don't know that this was anything special but it fit the bill.  My husband had a bite without knowing what it was and thought it was banana bread.  I doubt that I will make this again.

This is delicious! Instead of using white sugar I used one cup of brown sugar and only one cup of oil. I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top. Love this-will never throw strawberries away again!

Had no problems with baking.  Iused a glass 9x5 dish and baked at 325 for 60 minutes.  Inside was moist, outside done perfect.  I used double the strawberries and liked it.  My husband said he didn't care for it.

I made these as muffins and bread.  Both turned out well.  I chopped the strawberries, sprinkled them with a little sugar, left them in the fridge overnight and pureed them for the bread.  I also substituted vanilla extract for the cinnamon, decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and omitted the nuts, since I was making them for young children.  Delicious!

I get rave reviews whenever I make this for friends, family, and co-workers. It's truly simple to make and tastes delicious. I use whole, frozen strawberries (thawed, of course) and double the amount of berries. It’s not necessary to add the additional sugar to the strawberries, as they are naturally sweet. Doubling the berries causes it to be more moist, meaning it's not necessary to use butter or cream cheese as a topping. It's scrumptious by itself!

This is such a good recipe!!!!! Very easy and versatile. I add graham flour (1/2 cup in place of 1/2 cup all purpose flour) wheat germ and oatmeal to give it an extra kick of whole grains. I also omit the extra sugar for the berries because it is sweet enough. Thanks for a great recipe.

My family devoured this! I did make a couple small adjustments though. First I cut back the cinnamon to  1/2 tbl., added 1 tsp pure vanilla and instead of 2 cups sliced strawberries, I used 1 1/2 cups sliced and 1 1/2 cups pureed fresh strawberries, that way the flavor is in every yummy bite. This was an instant family favorite!

This had a tartness to it that I loved. Not very sweet, but just right. I put in way too many strawberries, my fault, so my bread turned out to be too moist and fell apart easily, however, next time I'll stick to 2 cups. 5 stars on the flavor and easiness.

needed an easy recipe to use up some ripe cherries. I found this & decided to try it out. In addition to the cherries, I switched the pecans with slivered almonds. Following other reviews, I cut back on the oil and the cinnamon.  I should have added some vanilla, but didn't think of it until I was done. The bread was delicious. I do want to try it with strawberries.

I used applesauce instead of oil, half sugar and half Splenda, and half white flour/ half wheat.  I made just one loaf, and the modified amounts all worked out great.   Next time I'm going to add a little vanilla and maybe some lemon zest.

I read the reviews and now I kinda wish I didn't.  If you are a sweet tooth, I wouldn't change a think about the recipe except for adding 2 more cups of pureed strawberries.  I only put 3/4 cup oil and 1 1/2 cups of sugar due to the reviews and I wish I would have followed the recipe.  I feel it is very bland.  My husband who isn't a sweet tooth loves it.  Next time I make it, I will definitely follow the recipe as is but add the other 2 cups of pureed strawberries.

I make mine with almonds. I put almonds instead of pecans in the blender and chop them until small pieces and put in the mix last and stir. It's makes it crumbly and so good. I do this to add need vitamins for my daughter who is allergic to milk. Even my picky man likes this recipe:)

Outstanding recipe--Thanks for sharing!  I did put at least an extra cup of strawberries in and cut them a little smaller, also using the suggested tip of mashing them by hand.  I also replaced about 1/4 cup of oil with lite applesauce and cut down on the overall amount by about another 1/8 cup.  Both loaves baked perfectly in about 47 minutes.  We couldn't stop picking at the finished product, which I can seriously recommend topping with Smucker's low sugar strawberry preserves!

I enjoyed this bread.  Of course, I always substitute to make a low-fat version.  I used two eggs and three egg whites, substituted 1 cup Splenda, applesauce for the oil, and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Turned out delicious!

While it is moist, this bread is much more a cinnamon bread with some chunks of strawberries than a strawberry bread, it seems.  The berries I used were VERY fresh and juicy, having just been picked.  I even added 2 additional cups of pureed berries.

My review is based on a modified recipe. Based on the multitude of comments, I made several changes. I used 3 cups diced strawberries, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 teas cinnamon, and 1/2 cup veg oil plus 3/4 cup applesauce. I used a white whole wheat type flour for mine. It turned out fine. I think I could have added another 1 cup of diced strawberries and it would have been even better. I liked the pecans in it. If I was using a regular white flour (AP) then I probably would reduce the sugar more. This produced two smaller loaves for me. They were maybe half the size of the pans. However, the loaves did not seem overly dense.

This was good. I did tweak this recipe a bit. I cut the recipe in half but still used 2 full cups of strawberries. 2 cups of all-purp flour. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of veggie oil. Reduced the sugar to 1 cup, 1 1/2 teas of cinnamon, 1/4 teas salt, 1/2 teas baking soda, 3 eggs, 3/4 cups of chopped pecans. I also added 1/2 cup of Greek style plain yogurt. Yummers!

Very good!  I halved the recipe to make just one loaf.  I use wheat flour and skipped the pecans due to our personal taste.  Used 2 pints of strawberries - one diced and the other pureed - and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Mmmm...

This was good.  Super moist- maybe too much so the next day.  I doubled the strawberries as per the suggestions.  I did find the cinnamon to be overpowering so I will cut that in half next time, and there will definitely be a next time. Used 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.

Great recipes! I increase the strawberries to 1/2 cup more, and reduce the sugar 1/2 cup less. It works our great!, and another tip, you can leave your bread in the oven for 15 minutes after baking will let the center of the bread cook to perfection without drying out the bread too much, and try using walnut instead of pecan.

made just as recipe states. except I did not have pecans so I used walnuts.Also no brd pan so I put it a bundt pan. Baked 55 mins. before putting batter in I cut fresh strawberry slices and put them in, poured batter in. Had a warm slice to see if it was worthy enough to bring to the office. And it was ....

Good bread!  Followed the other's suggestions and added 2 c. sliced strawberries and 2 c. pureed.  It could probably use a more strawberry flavor but I'm not sure how to go about getting that.  I also added 1 t. vanilla.  The only thing I changed up was I used less pecans than it called for (about 1/2 as much) and it turned out the way I like it...not too crunchy.

Great tasting bread! To cut down on the fat and sugar, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the full 2 cups. Turned out great!

Great recipe! I mashed the strawberries and only used a cup of sugar, since the strawberries were super ripe and sweet (I also tasted the batter to see if sugar was needed after everything was mixed) and I used applesauce instead of oil, and only a tsp of cinnimon (thats all I had left). Per my oven and dark pans I cooked on 325 for 50 min.

Sooooo good. I used more than two cups of berries, but didn't measure them, just what I needed to use up. Also cut down the oil and subbed applesauce, cut down sugar and cinnamon just on preference. Very moist, very good bread.

This bread rocks my socks. I followed the advice of some reviewers and added 2 c. of strawberries pureed and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. I didn't have cinnamon on hand so I substituted nutmeg. It is moist and delicious with just the right strawberry flavor. Two thumbs up, for sure.

Very yummy. Made mini muffins to take to my kids pre-school. Doubled or more of the strawberries. Used half whole wheat, half regular flour. Half oil/half applesauce. DELICIOUS and moist. Great way to use up on sale strawberries!

This recipe was wonderful and so easy to make! It wasn't extremely sweet so if you have a big sweet tooth you might want to make a few modifications, but we loved it as it was! It was a great breakfast treat.

This was my first time making strawberry bread and I thought it was pretty good.It does have a nice strawberry flavor and it's very moist.I didn't have fresh strawberries so I used a 16oz package of frozen strawberries that I partially thawed and just chopped up.I didn't even drain them.I added a tsp of vanilla and I had some rasberry applesauce that I used for half the oil.I used 2 tsp of cinnamon and it tasted about right to me.I made an 8x4 loaf and 3 mini loaves out of it.I wasn't sure if I would like nuts in this bread so I only added walnuts to half the batter.It turns out I do really like the nuts so next time I'll add them to all of it.I'll have to try this again sometime using fresh strawberries and maybe even try adding a mashed banana.

I made this for the first time while visiting my aunt's elderly mother with changes as follows:  I used a 16 oz. container of (thawed) frozen sliced strawberries, only 1 Cup of oil (since there was lots of juice in the strawberries) and 3 Cups plus "a little" flour.  I've never measured 1/8 C of a dry ingredient so that was a little bit of guessing, but it turned out great!    I had never heard of strawberry bread and was surprised to find that my aunt's mother hadn't either!  I thought women of her generation, and especially her baking expertise, had heard of and baked everything possible!  We both loved it, as did her daughters and caregiver!  My family did get to try a little too (hehe) and loved it as well.  I took the other loaf to a friend for him and his son and the review was "it was kicking!!"      There's another batch of this in the oven as I type, although since I had some bananas mashed with as yet, noplace to go, I tossed in just a dab of them to see if I liked it that way too.

So Good!! Wow! OK I made a few changes - I only used 1 1/4 cups sugar & I used applesauce instead of the oil, I also ran out of cinnamon so I only used 2 tsp - it's Perfect!! I was craving blueberries instead of strawberries & it turned out so unbelievably good. I can't wait to try other fruits with this. Thank you so much for sharing!

WONDERFUL with the changes as follows: less sugar (1.5 cups), more strawberries (3 cups), and replacement of all the oil with applesauce (1 cup).  Great flavor and ended up with 4 mini loaves and 9 muffins!  This is a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  This was a tasty bread but I couldn't taste the strawberries at all.  It tasted mostly like cinnamon bread.  It took a lot longer to bake than recommended as well.  If I make it again I'll use more strawberries as other reviewers have recommended and cut down on the cinnamon.  There was way too much oil, so next time I would perhaps use milk or water and halve the oil.  This recipe definitely has potential, but it wasn't what I expected.

YUMMY!! I made this bread with our local Oregon strawberries and it turned out SO good. I did make it a bit healthier- i used half whole wheat flour and applesauce for half the oil. I also only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the 2 cups- the strawberries were plenty sweet as was the applesauce. Anyway- fantastic bread- I will make it again!!

Very yummy bread! I used a small tub of drained frozen strawberries that I pureed for more flavor. Since the frozen berries added moisture I used 3-1/4 cup of flour. And I cut the sugar down to 1 cup since the frozen berries were sweetened. And used 1/2 T cinnamon. It is very tasty and moist. Will be taking some to work.

I followed the advice of other users and added strawberry puree.  It still wasn't a really strong strawberry flavor.  My kids weren't big fans, and they LOVE strawberries.

Very moist and I like the pockets of strawberries - next time i'll try pureeing half of them.  Also added a couple sprinkles of cloves - very good.  Nice to have a recipe for those wilted strawberries!

I followed the recipe and my mix was very dry.  I made half of it into bread and half into muffins.  The muffins turned out much better than the bread - it was still raw in the very center but the top was crispy.  The muffins tasted yummy!

This is so good.  The cinnamon is such an unexpected flavor and smell when thinking of strawberries.  They worked together beautifully.  I used half cake flour, half whole wheat flour.  I also substituted half the oil with u/s applesauce, although next time I think I will just use all u/s applesauce.  I also used egg substitute for the eggs (I always do!!).  But the best thing I did was to add chocolate chips to it!!  YUM!  I think I probably should have turned my oven to 325 since the cinnamon and the wheat flour sort of browned the outside faster than the inside could get perfectly done.   Overall-fabulous recipe and I will definitely make again!!!  P.S.  Seriously - use ALL the cinnamon it calls for.  Sounds a little strange but it really does make the recipe different!

I thought this bread was just ok. Not what I expected. Instead of being able to taste the strawberries, all I could taste was the cinnamon.  Next time if I do decide to try again, will def. cut down on the cinnamon and add some extra strawberries.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the results were wonderful! I second-guessed the amount of cinnamon, but used it all anyway, and it is delicious! I have another pint of strawberries at home, and will be making this again tonight.

OH MY GOD!!! This bread was so good!! I made it for my roommates and it was a total hit. Use all the sugar and a touch of vanilla extract. The outside was crisp and the inside so soft.  good.

great recipe! Modified it for a lower fat/low sugar recipe. like others, sub half the flour with whole wheat flour, 1 c applesauce, 1/4 c oil, sub 1 cup sugar with splenda, sweetened strawberry's with splenda, cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added the 1 tsp vanilla others recommended, and added one ripened banana. Great results! My picky 10 y/o son was also impressed!!

I am a very beginner but this turned out great.  I had 2 packages of strawberries that I was going to have to throw out very soon so I used them all.  I sliced half and pureed half so it ended up being about 3 cups sliced and 1&1/2 cups puree.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and only 3/4 cup (since I pureed some strawberries).  I used just over 2 cups of white flour to 1 cup of wheat flour and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and the cinnamon to 1/2 tablespoon.  In the end, it turned out amazingly well and it was not too sweet or tart.  Just right...I did forget to add the vanilla though as others have mentioned...maybe next time.

Very good. I used 1 c applesauce instead of oil b/c I didn't have any. That seemed to work well. Also, I did 2 cups of pureed strawberries and 2 cups diced. I did 1/2 tbsp cinnamon, but I honestly think the whole tbsp would have been fine since the strawberries were increased. I added a splash of vanilla and increased cooking time by about 15 minutes. I put one half of the batter in a loaf pan and 1 half in a bundt pan. Both turned out nice. Will definitely be sharing this one.

This was delicious!  As suggested by others, I used 4 cups of strawberries instead of two and used a 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon.  It was the perfect blend of strawberry and cinnamon.  My husband suggested trying a crumble topping next time.  I'll let you know how it goes.

YUMMY..... This was the perfect change to bread that I was looking for. I had Strawberries in the fridge that needed to be used. And this was the perfect recipe for them. I did not have two loaf pans, so I opted for the muffin trays. The batter fit perfectly into two 12 count muffin trays and cooked in perfect time as directed. I love Strawberries, so I took the advise of prior reviews and added two cups of smushed Strawberries to the two cups of sliced berries. Delish!

My family belongs to a community farm & this week we found ourselves with LOTS of strawberries, so needless to say I began searching for good strawberry recipes. I found this one...and I'm really glad I did! My mom has an intolerance to wheat, gluten, eggs and dairy, so I had to change it up a bit. 
First of all, I made this recipe as muffins, not bread.
I crushed rolled oats in the blender and made a flour out of them and used 1 tablespoon of oil replacing the eggs.  
I didn't have lots of any oil on hand so I just used ricemilk instead of the oil; and I pureed the strawberries in the  blender to create a more consistent "strawberry-ey" flavor throughout the muffin. 
Finally, instead of putting nuts in the batter I crushed almonds and sprinkled them on top of the muffins. My only complaints are (1) the recipe made so many muffins that I'm going to have to freeze some and (2) I wish I'd found this recipe earlier! Definitely 5 stars!

I made this for a house full guests who were visiting for my daughter's graduation and it was a huge hit. Every bit was eaten. I then made several small loaves for them to take on their long drives home. It was perfect just as written. Thank you for the recipe!

Thanks,
I added on to this recipe.  I am already satisfied because the good LORD provided us with so many good ingredients to use, such as: strawberries, plants, animal products, etc.
Be sure to give thanks for what you have!

It was good, but like other reviews it had me wondering where those strawberries I put in there went!  I did use a cup of wheat flour, and an 1/8 cup oats (trying to make it healthy-ish) so that might have been the problem.  I also reduced the amount of cin. but I don't think that would have made the strawberries disapear.  It was good however, if a bit dry, and I had no problem with it being too moist in the center or too crispy on the outside.

I made this as a desert on a steamy day wen I wasn't sure if icing would hold up to the heat at a BBQ.  I used a little less oil, vanilla instead of cinnamon, left out the pecans and raw sugar instead of white(I made these changes because it's what I had in the house), also, didn't have any loaf pans so I used a 9x13 and baked for 30 minutes. It turned out with a beautiful, crispy golden top and it was delicious, I got a compliment from everyone who tried it!  I am bringing it to my next brunch for sure!

I subbed one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, no oil--instead I used one cup of natural applesauce.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavor.  YUMMY bread!  I cooked it for just under 50 minutes in two loaf pans.

Easy to make and addictive to eat. Quite high in calories, so I'm looking for ways to make it a bit lighter. Would make a great potluck dish because it doesn't require a spread. Definitely use the two pans to get an even and consistent texture throughout. The dough does rise.

I loved this recipe ! I dont consider myself a baker but this was right on the money..I noticed a few people said it wasnt done in the middle,I too had to bake my a bit longer about 15 to 20 mins.. I would bake it slowly and increase the time..
I also used walnuts sprinkled on top right before baking..That was my only sub.. I dislike when someone reviews a recipe and changes the whole recipe.

Tried this recipe and am really impressed.  I left out the pecans, simply because I didn't have any on hand.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was great...I wouldn't change a thing.  I used a 9x5 glass pan, which took 65 minutes to cook through in my oven and then a metal mini-loaf pan and those took 30 minutes to cook up.  Mini-loaves to friends...big one for my family...worked out prefectly!

This bread turned out nicely, I divided it between two pans of different size and misjudged how long th e bigger pan would take.  Even though the toothpick came out clean it still sank in the middle and I had to cut off that part to serve (we still ate it, it tasted delicious!)Great recipe.

This was an excellent bread. I toasted the pecans sprinkled with cinnamon for a few minutes to bring out their flavor and had to cook it an hour before it was done. I liked the reviewer who said they used applesauce to cut the oil down. I would have done the same, but was out of applesauce.

The recipe as written, tastes like a strawberry cobbler in bread form. It's good, but it's nothing special. I made it 3 times and 3 different ways before it turned out with a little pizzazz! The final result is this--- use an insane amount of strawberries. Also, be sure to cut them up ahead of time so that they can make their own juice. Include a lot of juice (it makes the bread really moist). I also added coconut and pecans. After making these changes, it turned out great!!!

I was disappointed with this bread.  It was rather bland and, even though I followed other's suggestions to bake it longer, could not get the right consistency.

Wow! This bread was moist and delicious.  I didn't have any pecans, so I substituted walnuts.  Excellent breakfast bread, I heated a piece each morning and spread with Country Crock.  Yummy!

I'd never made or even heard of strawberry bread before I saw this recipe, but I had to get rid of a bunch of our surplus strawberries we'd picked this year so I gave it a try. I thought that this bread tasted just ok. I thought you could taste the cinnamon more than the strawberries, even though I had added about a cup extra. I also omitted the pecans as I don't like nuts in bread, replaced about 3/4 c of the oil with applesauce, and ended up baking it for 60 minutes. While I didn't find this to be anything spectacular, the 2 loaves that it made disappeared within 2 days at my house.

Yumm...I have never tried strawberry bread.  I really liked this recipie.  I agree, increase the strawberries a bit and there is quite a bit of oil but it was still delicious.  I didn't smush or puree the strawberries and like it that way but will try the puree next time. I warmed it with butter for breakfast! Very tasty!

Overall, good recipe.  My husband love it.  I added more strawberries and if I make it again, I will add even more.  (Warning: It takes a lot longer to bake than recipe says.)

This was good. Easy to make and went over well with everyone who tried it. I don't like nuts so I substituted grape nuts. Will make again. Thanks.

Sorry but our entire family was disappointed in this recipe. We really enjoy fruit quick breads but this one just didn't thrill us.
It did not seem quite sweet enough and if I were to ever try this again, I would mash to strawberries to pulp and see if that'd improve the bread.

Very good. Made one loaf and 6 extra large muffins. Really liked the muffins better. I increased strawberries to 3+ cups and it was very hard to get the bread center done. Firmed up after cutting and letting sit awhile. Took the loaf to work and everyone loved it. Made strawberry butter to serve with it, but think cream cheese would be better. Will make again, my husband liked it too!

Very good!  I was impressed with this.  I was a little concerned with the batter because it was so thick, but it turned out great.  I must agree with everyone and would recommend MORE strawberries!!

This was great.  You have to cook it ALOT longer than stated in the recipe or else the inside is mushy.  My kids liked it -- even my daughter who's not a big fan of strawberries.

Very delicous. I added extra strawberries as suggested and it was very hard to get the bread done in the middle. Be sure to bake this beyond when you think it is done. The strawberries add a moistness that requires more time to bake.

This was very yummy! It freezes well, too. I used the bundt pan, increased the strawberries by at least half, and used about half whole wheat flour.

I wish there were more than five stars, because this recipe definantly deserves more! It's really original and tastes great. I was a little worried at first.. starwberries in bread seemed kind of weird. But once it's all cooked, the strawberries fit right in and it kind of reminded me of having pound cake with sliced strawberries. I'm really excited about this recipe because I think I can also substitute other fruits, too. I can't wait to try. This is great!

This recipe was really tasty.  I did put in 4 cups of fresh strawberries and the amount was perfect.  It was nice and moist.  I also left out the pecans because my kids don't like them and it was still quite flavorful.  My relatives gobbled it up.

Great bread. I took this to a church dinner and it was gone before any of the others I took. I made this with both big and small chunks of berries and like the bigger chunks better.

I also doubled the amount of strawberries and lessened the cinnamon a tad.  And I substituted applesauce for all of the oil except 2 tablespoons, and it turned out moist and yummy.

I substituted margarine for one cup of the oil, and added about a quarter cup of oil to the strawberry mixture. The bread turned out nice - was delicious with mixed berry cream cheese spread. Seemed to be lacking a little something ... maybe more cinnamon next time ... although I'm in the minority here, the other 2 who ate it thought it was perfect as it was!

This was a very good recipe. I substituted applesauce for the oil. It turned out well. I made cream cheese icing (with chopped up strawberries in it) to put on top of it. I made both loaves and muffins with this recipe. Yummy.

I was pretty skeptical about this bread, but had lots of fresh strawberries. I was surprised at how refreshing it tasted. If you don't think about all the fat in it...really its a nice change from banana bread! I also made it without the nuts and it was still tasty.

I made this with only one change. I used 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of canola oil.  Baked in 4 small loaf pans instead of large pans for about 35 min. I like to share. 
Turned out perfect. Very moist and not to sweet.

We always end up with a lot of frozen strawberries so I had to try this. It's like the best banana bread you've ever had but with strawberries. The possibilities are endless. I just made a loaf with strawberries and mini chocolate chips. I make it in my bread maker on quick bread but I take it out a few minutes early. That's just my bread maker though. Best bread ever.

Good recipe. Follow the adjustments, and let the bread cool completely before pulling it out otherwise its too wet from the strawberries and it will separate

I made the typical "healthier choice substitutions" when making this bread, and it still turned out great! 
The 2 things I would suggest cutting a bit is the sugar & cinnamon. To add, I would say def add extra strawberries. And a good sub for the pecans (if don't want to/can't use nuts) is dark chocolate chips!

I cut this recipe in half for only 1 loaf, and I'm a little sad I did that because it turned out pretty yummy!

I used 1C pureed strawberries (using my food processor), and a little over 1C diced strawberries.  I did about 1/4C unsweetened applesauce and 2 tbsp oil.  I cut the sugar down to 3/4C, which is poured over the strawberries, stirred a bit, then let them sit while I did the rest.  I omitted the nuts as personal preference.  I also only used about 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I made a hole in the dry ingredients, poured in the strawberry/oil mix and then stirred very carefully.  Make sure you butter and flour the pan really well because I must not have done the bottom as well as I thought, as the bottom completely stuck to the glass dish.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I lowered the temp to 325 deg because I was using a glass dish.  Took about 1 hour.  The bread came out light and moist.  Perfect amount of sugar, I think!  I'm looking forward to making this again!  I may even try to lower the sugar a bit more in the dish and then add a brown sugar crust on top.  Yummy!

I love this website. I love the recipe ratings because you go into it having a good idea what could potentially go wrong . Or on the flip side, a great rating typically means a lot people have had good luck with the recipe. Boy was I fooled on this one. I followed the directions and measured the ingredients out appropriately. I baked for even longer than the recipe called for. The middles of both loaves of my bread would not cook . Pure mush! I'm not sure if my berries were too juicy or exactly what fueled this disaster, but...what a disappointment and waste of ingredients. I was generous with two stars ONLY because some of the edges that stuck to the pan tasted good. Thumbs down on this one.

This strawberry bread was very easy, tasted wonderful and was moist. I did use almost 4 cups of strawberries ( 2 cups roughly chopped, 2 cups puréed) I used just a bit less than 2 cups sugar and used some of that sugar to soften the chopped strawberries. I used just a dash of cinnamon as I topped the loaves with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil which still provided a moist bread. I basically mixed the dry ingredients then mixed the wet and gently stirred the two together. Then folded in the chopped strawberries and the pecans. Baked up perfectly at 48 minutes. Topped our slices with a mixture of cream cheese, honey, powdered sugar and a bit of the puréed strawberries. Grandkids gave it a big thumbs up.

Have made this delicious bread 3 times recently.  The reviews from friends, family -all- love this bread.  One neighbor called it "Award Winning:"  I on the other hand usually taste all my finished items - but this one was SO good, I baked one just for me!  I changed nothing, made it just as written!  Thank you so much for sharing this marvelous treat!

Excellent!! I used three plus cups of fresh strawberries. Honestly, I think you could use as many as you want. At first I was worried since the batter seemed a bit stiff, BUT it turned out great. Also, I used a bundt cake pan rather than the loaf pans. I will be making this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, was delicious and didn't last more than 24 hours for both loaves.  Will be making again as recipe states and with a variation with bananas.

This is my second time baking this strawberry bread.  The first time I went exactly by the recipe.  The second time I modified the recipe.  I used 2 containers of strawberries, 16 ounces each container.  I reserved some of the strawberries for the topping and about a cup of the strawberries for a puree.  I feel the puree made a difference in the taste, it had a more flavorful, strawberry taste this time.  Other than that, I used the same amount of sugar, oil and eggs.  Maybe, next  time I will reduce the sugar and substitute with strawberry applesauce, or regular applesauce as long as I can buy applesauce with no added sugar, preservatives, etc.  I know Motts has strawberry applesauce that does not contain artificial stuff.  I might try that, or buy more strawberries and make more puree.  **Please note you will need to add more baking time if you use puree, perhaps 20 to 30 minutes more, always check batter with toothpick.  And at the last 10 to 15 minutes you should top loaves with aluminum foil so as not to dry or burn the top**

Good flavor, very moist. Subbed honey for part of the sugar and cut back on the oil (would reduce oil even more if making again).  Like the pecans with the strawberries.

This is an excellent recipe. I bought a huge tub of organic strawberries and needed to find something to do with them before it was too late. Who knew there was such a thing as strawberry bread?! I have no sweet tooth and don't like to add sugar unless I absolutely have to since fruit is sweet on its own. Reading reviews, I made 2 loaves of this wonderful bread using 4 cups of strawberries (1 cup puréed & 1 cup thickly sliced), only 3/4 cup oil, only 1 cup sugar, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and only 1/2 T cinnamon. I did not sprinkle the strawberries with sugar before adding them to the batter. The bread is wonderful with pecans & strawberries throughout! Next time I will use the whole tablespoon of cinnamon. Cutting it back tastes great, but I do live cinnamon. I will be making this again!

I didn't read reviews before making the bread, so I followed the exact recipe. My baking times may be different and my result may have been altered due to high elevation. I found it to have too much cinnamon, that was the "star" of this bread. It tasted like gingersnaps and the texture was dense, not fluffy.

Wonderful fruit bread! It made the house smell heavenly, and I made it for my fiancée as a welcome back from a trip. I cut the serving size to 12 and made it in a tube pan; it turned out to be a lovely looking, medium sized bundt sweet. Substitutions to make it a healthier bread were applesauce for oil; 1 cup whole wheat flour with 1/2 cup white flour, and 1 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup white sugar. I buttered, floured, and lightly applied cooking spray to the bundt pan, and baked the bread for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. After it was done, I waited about ten minutes before dusting the top with confectioner's sugar. When the bread is this temperature (warm and beginning to cool) some of the sugar seeps in giving some sweetness to the top, but it's cooling enough where some of the sugar stays in solid form and keeps the pretty sugar dusting look. I will make this again!

Have to agree with some of the others..the strawberry taste was not as predominant as I'd like. Also agree that the cinnamon should be reduced and the strawberries increased. I added pecans to mine and it was what saved it. But I like a lighter cake and would not make this again. ):

I made this recipe the first time as it was written, although I did take the review advice and doubled the strawberries (no pecans).  It was awesome.  The batter is so thick it kind of scared me, but I stuck with it and it came out great.  This time I still doubled the strawberries and put in 1 cup white chocolate chips instead of pecans.  I baked it in muffin tins because I like to give a lot of it away and it got messy.  Wish I would of read the suggestion to top with sugar before baking!  baked for 25 minutes, made 18 muffins.  I filled each tin almost to the top but next time will fill all the way up to get more "muffin top".  Also, after greasing the tins, I dusted them with flour because the strawberries do stick.  I can not emphasize enough how fantastic these turned out!!

Good tasting bread. Had to use up our strawberries we had picked. I used 3 cups of strawberries as recommended. I had the same issue as many others with the baking times. I had to bake this for over 90 minutes.

Thank you so much Ellen for sharing this delicious recipe.  I halved it, because I wasn't sure if my family would like strawberry bread.  I wish I would have made the full recipe, because it's almost devoured already.  We made slight changes to suit our families tastes (for a half recipe): 1- used 1 1/2 cups of diced strawberries, 2- only used 3/4 cup of sugar (and tossed all the sugar with the strawberries), 3- for the flour we used 1 cup of white whole wheat and 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp of all-purpose, 4- cut the cinnamon down to 1 tsp, 5- added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients, 6- substituted 1/2 cup of nonfat Greek yogurt for part of the oil, still added 2 Tbsp of oil to make up the difference.  This WAS  absolutely delicious.  Thank you again Ellen for helping me to feed my family delicious wholesome food.  Thank you also to all the reviewers for your suggestions.

This recipe is delicious. I actually cut all of the measurements in half so that I would end up with only 1 loaf. The reason: I didn't want to waste any extra ingredients if it didn't come out right or if it didn't taste good. This recipe is seriously a winner. I should have made two loaves after all. Yum!

I made this today after realizing I had almost 4 cups of strawberries thawed on the fridge that needed to be ate. I've never heard of strawberry bread before butt an so happy I found this! I used all of the berries I had and took the advice of others, adding vanilla and reducing the cinnamon and it was amazing... moist, flavorful, and completely addicting :) as I write this, I've ate 4 pieces! thanks for sharing!

So I read through the comments & went with what made sense. I upped the amount of berries, and mashed some up so that the flavor was more throughout.   I used about half oil & half applesauce. Cooked a little longer (though this could be my oven).  Can't post a picture - it was attacked too quickly by my daughter & her boyfriend.

This recipe for the most part is worth 5 stars. The only things are next time I make this, I will do way more strawberries then the recipe called for! There were defiantly not enough of strawberries. It also took a long time to cook. It took about 65 minutes to bake due to the middle staying mushy. Although the loaves turned out darker then I had hoped, it tasted good and the middles finally got done. Yum!

OMG this was good! I followed the recipe with the exception of adding more strawberries. I used about two of those plastic containers (the kind of rectangle ones). Sliced most of them and sprinkled with sugar and set aside. The remainder I sliced and smashed up and then added to the batter with the wet ingredients. Folded in the sliced strawberries at the very end. I used the full amount of cinnamon and didn't find it overwhelming at all. I used pecans too. So good! I had to bake this for about 15 minutes more than the recipe stated in order for my tester to come out nearly clean. Well worth the wait!

Just awful! Followed the recipe but added 1 cup extra strawberries. Took nearly an hour and a half to cook and turned out soggy on the inside and over crisp on the outside. Tastes very bland and oily! Wouldn't even give it 1 star but had no choice to submit a review.

Love love love this bread! Made it for an office potluck and got rave reviews. The second time around, I used 3 cups of strawberries instead, and it worked out wonderfully! The extra strawberries really give the bread the perfect amount of flavor.

Add 1-2 cups extra strawberries just before putting into pans.  Use part of the sugar in the recipes to cover berries.

Good recipe for the basic baker, i.e. me!! As with prior suggestions, I doubled the strawberries to 4 cups, used only 3/4 cup of oil and ~1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and used less cinnamon, ~ 1tsp. I also added ~1tsp. nutmeg. Otherwise, all ingredients used as listed. Even without putting sugar on the top, I very much enjoyed the crunchy top layer. I did bake in a bundt pan and it took an additional 25 minutes to bake.

Just finished cooling.  Tastes wonderful.  I did make it with double the strawberries, as many suggested.  Glad I did.  It is very tasty.  Other than that, it was the same recipe.  I used a bundt pan and four 2 cup size crocks, as I thought that the bundt would overflow.  The bundt cooked up in an hour time at 350. The smaller ones were done in 45 min. I was worried that adding the extra berries would make it mushy, but there is plenty of cake to it... good consistency. I thought the amount of cinnamon and sugar was perfect. And the pecans are a wonderful addition.

This is by far the best strawberry bread recipe I've found over the years - the pecans are a very nice touch -  as others suggested, I added alot more strawberries - probably making it almost 4 cups of them - also a few drops of vanilla extract - just picked another big basket of berries so I'm about to make two more loaves!   A year later and this year I've combined strawberries with blueberries and another batch of strawberries and mashed banana to equal 4 cups. Yum.

This bread is great. Would be awesome with blueberries I bet. Followed the recipe mostly except I didn't have reg pecans but I had 300g if candied pecans so I ground them in the vitamix and added them. Cut my sugar to only one cup. I also used 4 cups of sliced strawberries and cooked in a bundt pan for one hour. Definitely a keeper

This recipe was awesome!  I'm not one to say that AFTER I've changed the recipe all around.  The only thing I did was reduce the cinnamon slightly to 1/2 tablespoon.  A friend gave me a container of strawberries, but I'm not sure how many there were.  But once I chopped them, I had at least two cups.  My baking time was longer, too.  The pick didn't come out clean until about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I made two loaves and have already eaten half of one ALL BY MYSELF since last night.  I will definitely make this again.

LOVE this recipe! The only changes I made was, I cut the recipe in half so I could only do 1 loaf. The bread needed a little over an hour to cook.

I also used Gluten Free all purpose rice flour a little more cinnamon. Next time, I will also use a little less sugar. The flavor was still great, just a personal preference when it comes to sweets. The bread was UBER moist and the strawberries were perfect!! Thanks

CHEERS & GOOD EATS!!

I loved this recipe! I used all the tips from others and it turned out AMAZING!!  I took some to work and everyone couldn't get enough and kept complimenting me and asking for the recipe.  Although word of advice, the 2nd time I tried to make it I wanted more strawberries in the bread so I put in an extra cup and a half (I know... How dumb!) and the bread just came out really soggy. Edible, but not enjoyable.   In any case thanks for the recipe, I will be making it for years to come :)

I too read the other reviews and made some modifications. I used 4 cups of berries, cut back the cinnamon to 1 tsp and substituted 1 cup of applesauce in place of 1 cup of the oil, left out the pecans. I baked in a bundt pan for about an hour and 15 minutes. Everyone loved it!

This bread was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the nuts and stirred in an additional 2 cups of chopped strawberries just before putting the mix in the 2 pans... as many had suggested. It came out perfect and moist! 

Only issue I had was the cooking time. Not sure if baking 2 breads at the same time affects cooking time, but 45 minutes at 350 was not nearly enough! At least not for my oven! So I just kept increasing the cooking time by 15 mins (and closely watched so I didn't over cook or burn) until it was done. It ended up at around 1 hour 40 mins of total cooking time in my oven.

Still five star worthy... will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe... :)

I halved the recipe (to make only one loaf) and followed all the ingredients and directions perfectly.  I really liked the overall flavor of the bread and the sweetness of the bites with strawberry.  I didn't care much for the pecans and would probably omit next time (not a huge nut lover) but I made this for my dad and he thought it was amazing.

I followed recommendations of those before me! Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c., cinnamon to 2 t., used 2 c berries, another 1/2 c. puree. Presto! Came out perfectly in bundt pan, about 50 minutes. Perfect blend of moist inside, crispy out.

Loved it!  Like others, I used half whole wheat flour, half white; half apple sauce, half canola oil; 3/4 the sugar; double the berries.  I would have used half the sugar, but my strawberries were a little tart.  The bottom of my cake stuck in the pan, but I pieced it back together and it still slices fine.  Wonderful way to use strawberries!

This is a good recipe for strawberry bread, but I found that it needs some significant changes to be worthy of five stars. I would recommend cutting back on the cinnamon (about 1/2 the amount called for) because using the whole tablespoon just drowns out the strawberry flavor. I think I'd also cut back on the oil and increase the strawberries, maybe even mash another cup of strawberries for flavor (and to keep the bread from getting dry).  Mine took 50 minutes at 350, and while it was good I did expect more strawberry flavor and, with the changes suggested, I think this recipe can work really well if you have a lot of strawberries you want to use up. Thanks for sharing!

3.5 stars, but I don't want to bring the overall rating down, so I'm putting it in as 4 stars.  I did not add nuts to the recipe, and used fresh fruit that i weighed out and also drained after putting them through a rough chop in the food processor.  First of all, the loaf (pyrex container with no change in temperature) took longer to bake than the stated baking time.  But when it is done, it starts crisping up rather quickly, so you have to carefully watch it at that point.  I read somewhere that you should take it out of the loaf pan as soon as it is cool.  I did, and it broke.  After being left overnight, I noticed that the loaf had a more solid feel to it.  So next time I will wait a little longer before flipping it out.  As for the taste, I was just not that impressed.  Neither the pineapple nor the strawberry really shined through.  It was still pleasant to eat, and if I had these ingredients to use up in the future, I might pull this recipe out again.  Bottom line, it was simple and fun to make, and the result was a simple, but pleasant tasting loaf.  I also used half the recipe to make muffins, and at 350, that took just a little under 20min in my oven.

This is so good!  I found the recipe a couple days ago since we had strawberries that I needed to do something with or they'd be thrown out.  I just sliced it and gave some to my husband and I had some, of course!    So moist and flavorful!  I packaged the other loaf up for the freezer.

I make this regularly when strawberries are in season, replacing part of the white sugar with brown sugar, depending on how much I have of each at the house.

Instead of using two 9" pans i used three 8" pans. It still took 1  1/2hr to cook with the center barely done and the outside burnt. One loaf still wasn't cooked through.

everyone's reviews were super helpful! i was using this as a tasty way to use up some too-ripe strawberries..
i made a very modified version.. as i ran out of sugar!.. i only used 1/2 cup sugar, they were just sweet enough, something to consider if you don't like to eat too much sugar. i used less cinnamon, about 1/2 cup oil, and i had no nuts, and also the less sugar, i crumbled three big graham crackers into the flour mixture. i also added a little over 1/8 cup cocoa pow.. i would recommend using more. also as another reviewer mentioned, choco chips.. because who doesn't like strawberries with chocolate? i'm not sure what the original version tastes like, but this not too sweet semi chocolatey version is pretty good. also i only had one bread tin so i made 12 muffins with half the batter. i baked the muffins for about 18 mins. i meant to add vanilla and totally forgot. thanks everyone!

I doubled the amount of strawberries and baked in a bundt pan, I was worried after I mixed it...it was a really thick batter. I increased the baking time by 20 min, next time I'll increase at least 25. It was good that day, but excellent the next day.

Absolutely fantastic! I halved the recipe to make one loaf as a tester. I used 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries, though, since other reviewers had commented about there not being enough strawberry flavor. It made the bread so moist you don't need anything to top it if you don't want! Husband and son are already asking me to make more!

I only made one loaf. I tried to keep this on the healthy side so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used three egg whites instead of two whole eggs. I held off a little but on the oil and omitted the pecans entirely. It turned out moist and very tasty. I will make this again in the future.

I took some other reviewers suggestions to halve the cinnamon, reduce the oil a bit, and add 1 tsp of vanilla and more strawberries. I was worried about the dough, it was thick and looked more like cookie dough than the bread dough I'm used to. It also took about one hour to cook in my oven. But the end result is delicious!

As suggested by others, I doubled the amount of strawberries but otherwise made the recipe as it was. It had to cook for over an hour to get done all the way. I brought this to a gathering, and it was a huge hit. People kept going back for a second, third, and fourth slice. Very good!

I doubled the berries and added mini chocolate chips. Baked in a bundt pan and covered in chocolate glaze. Very good but a little too much cinnamon. It overpowered the berries a little.

I thought my husband would love this bread since he loves strawberry pie so much.  Unfortunately, he didn't like the cooked strawberry texture. My 8 yr old daughter said she couldn't taste any strawberry flavor in the bread...

So delicious! I did make a few changes: only used about 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon (not a big cinnamon fan), used about 3 cups of strawberries, and left out the pecans (didn't have any on hand). It was a big hit with my very picky husband and 2 year old so I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good.  I used fresh frozen strawberries.  I thawed them so I would have some extra juice.  I mashed them with a fork.  I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil.  I added 1 tsp cloves as well.  This was a hit at work, so moist and flavorful.

The bread is ok, probably would not make again without change. Did use only 2 cups strawberries, that is all I had, and it def. is not enough to have a a good strawberry flavor. To much oil in recipe and to much cinnamon, and I love cinnamon. Should have made strawberry coffee cake from this site, that recipe is very good.

The flavor of this bread was very good. However, mine was basically raw in the middle after the cooking time. The toothpick test didn't detect it either. Even though it wasn't completely cooked we still ate it... kinda like eating cookie batter! I will try again!

So very delicious! I did increase the strawberries, though I didn't measure I think it was about 3 - 4 cups. I also used half sugar and half splenda, and subbed half the oil with applesauce. Excellent!

This wasn't bad, but also wasn't anything special. Unlike banana bread, the strawberry flavor does not spread throughout the bread, leaving it a bit boring. It is delicious when you get good strawberry bite though :) I'd recommend adding more strawberries than the recipe calls for.

The thickness of the batter surprised me a little.  It took longer to bake because it was so dense, so the ends were a little overcooked.  I agree that it needs more strawberries.  I used chopped toasted almonds in place of walnuts, 1/2 t vanilla extract and 1/2 t almond extract, which worked nicely.  Thought the flavor was really good.

halved the recipe with the lovely "calculate" button may. Only thing i did do different is after blending my strawberry mixture in I thought it would be good if it actually had chunks of strawberries in it also so i sliced up a few more strawberries and folded them in with the pecans at the end. Came out amazing. had to cook slightly longer than what the recipe called for though.

This bread is very nice.  I had frozen defrosted stawberries in the fridge and I thought I'd try this.  I did end up adding about a cup more of fresh sliced strawberries and purreed the frozen strawberries, and after tasting the final product I do think it needed that extra strawberry flavor.  I also cut the sugar a bit, and this was great.  Unfortunately, I had cut onions in the fridge and the onion flavor permeated this bread so we had to toss it.  My fault, and I definitely won't do that again bc when I tried it yesterday it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! I only made 1 loaf and the changes I made were: used 2 c. strawberries, 1/2 c. sugar, and 2/3 c. strawberry puree, 1/2 tbsp vanilla, and no pecans. I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this!!! I did follow some other reviewers' advice and used oil and applesauce (1 cup to 1/2 c.). Mixed a puree with added Splenda. Then used a comniation of diced and whole, soft strwberries. It came out so moist it was more like a bread-pudding. I made it a second ime reducing the oil to 1/2 cup and increeasing the applesauce to 1 cup. It was a better cosistecy. VERY flavorful!!!

This was pretty sweet, cakey bread, more like a dessert.  This turned out wonderfully! I halved the recipe to make one loaf - used 1/4 c oil, 1 1/2 c strawberries (I cut into thirds and sprinkled them with sugar), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I baked for about 50 minutes, but it was still a little mushy on top and should've used foil for another 5-10 minutes.

Loved this! Made one loaf since there were not a lot of folks here to eat it and was not sure how it would hold up- but I think I need to make another loaf! I did double the berries, and ended up baking it about 5 min longer ( am guessing due to the extra moisure?) The next morning it was just as moist as when I made it- not dry at all. Definitely a keeper!

A good recipe but the strawberries I used were not juicy enough next time I will mash the berries and might substitue applesauce for some of the oil. My family really like it though.

This recipe was fantastic!  I'm not a nut lover, so I put an extra 1/2 cup strawberries instead of the pecans.  It took an hour and ten minutes to cook (vs. what they listed), but it was worth the extra time.  My family and friends have been devouring this bread!

Every time I told someone about this bread, they looked at me like I was crazy.  Then I used the description "like banana bread, only with strawberries" and they were intrigued. This is a great way to use up over ripe berries, in fact, I don't think it was taste as well if it were made with "perfect for eating" berries.      For a real treat, lightly toast a slice and spread it with cream cheese. YUMMMMM.

I never write reviews on this site, but my bread completely flopped so had to share :(  Followed directions to a tee and my bread would never get done? After 1 hr 10 minutes it was still gooey. BOO!

Pretty good. Was a little dry, but not too bad. Took it to work and got good reviews. Wonder if I mashed the strawberries up, like you mash bananas when you make banana bread, if that would make it more moist.

These were YUM! :)  I did sub 1/2 of the oil for applesauce, and I forgot to add the salt (oops).  But the fresh strawberries were killer and this was a definite winner.  I made 18 good-sized muffins.

I made 24 muffins. I doubled the strawberries and i roughly chopped them while they were still slightly frozen and threw them in. I also only had self rising flour so i used that and omitted the levening.   DELICIOUS!!  A definate keeper for the recipe box.

WAY too much oil.  I could seriously smell/taste the oil instead of the strawberries and I doubled the strawberries (my only change to the recipe!!).  Kinda dissappointed in this one.

Both loaves were gone in a few hours!  I substituted one cup of oatmeal for one cup of flour and used 1/2 amt of sugar.  Also, my children have egg allergies; the egg substitute worked break in this recipe!

This recipe was very good, and I only made a couple minor adjustments. I used 3 cups of diced strawberries instead of 2. I did mash 1 cup of the strawberries. I only used 1 cup of oil since I added an extra cup of strawberries. I made some strawberry peach butter to go along with this bread. It was a huge hit at work. Thanks so much!

My husband (huge critic) said it tasted like it was bought from a bakery. My sister (an accomplished baker) loved it and asked for the recipe. Thank you to those who suggested using olive oil and dicing up the strawberries.

Makes 6 mini-loaves, I used them for gifts (the ones I didn't eat myself!).  The mini loaves took 40-45 minutes and I absolutely loved the crispy edges on this bread.  Very good!

This was great!  I doubled the fruit, added a little vanilla extract and lemon juice, and cut the oil and sugar.  I've never had strawberry bread before, but will definitely be adding it to my list of good recipes.

This is fabulous with the changes noted by others. (Less oil and sugar and cinnamon, add a splash of vanilla extract and more strawberries...I sliced the strawberries with a 6mm blade in the food processor and then measured out 4 cups)  I took it to a family weekend away and it did not make it past the first day.  The kids especially loved it, but everybody thought it was good stuff.

This was really great. I followed some of the other suggestions to health it up and also addressed the "mushy" comments... Cut sugar by 1/2c (will cut a full cup next time), replaced 1/2c flour with whole wheat+ground flax seed, replaced oil w/ applesauce. I diced the strawwberries and added a 1 cup of strawberry puree. Froze nicely too!

This is a very good recipe.  The first time I made it according to the directions (minus the nuts) and it was good.  The second batch I made I added about .5 cups more strawberries.  Substituted 1c white flour for whole wheat.  The bread was still very good.  In the future I will also reduce the sugar.

This was fantastic! I made two nights ago after buying fresh strawberries at the local farmers market. My boyfriend was a little skeptical but he love it and so do our kids! I added about a cup more strawberries and no nuts, but that was it. Great recipe.

Flavor was fantastic. Great way to use up a big lot of strawberries. Only issues for me were that the bread didn't rise like a typical quick bread, and also, the moisture from the strawberries made the bread a bit mushy in some places, especially in the middle, so much so that the middle wasn't servable. I threw it out, and served the rest in "cake-size" pieces, and called it strawberry cake.

I have made this recipe before, my family & I really liked it. I wanted to make it again, this time I use whole wheat, I used 3/4c. each brown sugar & organic raw sugar, I used 3/4 c. applesauce w/1/4c. oil. I warmed up the strawberrys just alittle with 1/2 t. extra cinnamon, then set aside to cool. I put about 1/2 c. chopped pecans in 1 of the 9x5 pans. The other 9x5 left pecans out. I have a mimi muffin pan (12count) so any time I make bread I always use some of the batter to make muffins, they cook in about 20 mins. The muffins & the loaves turned out great! I have learned that strawberry breads are a milder flavor than, bluberry, raspberry & banana breads, but still very good. The pan w/ the pecans in it cooked alot faster, by almost 10 mins. I am learning to cook alittle healthier, some adjustments turn out good, some not. This is a good recipe. Thanks so much for posting it!

5 stars with these changes: Used whole wheat flour, reduced oil to 1\2 cup, reduced sugar to 1\2 cup, used walnuts instead of pecans (they are what I had on hand), added 1\8 cup brown sugar, added 2 teaspoons vanilla, and added 2 cups pureed strawberries.  Cooked in a bundt pan for about 50 minutes, until tester came out clean.  Cooked in a bundt pan and dusted with powdered sugar. Delicious, moist, and much healthier with the changes.

GREAT! I got called a Chef for making this bread, because it's so delicious and perfect! But I made some adjustments. Following another user's advice: I halved the recipe, used 1/4c oil, 1 1/2c strawberries, sprinkled with sugar and mashed, and I replaced the cinnamon with 1/2tsp nutmeg. It only needed to be cooked for about 40 minutes, and it turned out so good. Will definitely save this to remake it! Thanks!

The revised edition of this "Strawberry Bread" (see Celeste's review) is really awesome! I had this improvised version for my birthday a few years ago and I loved it! I can't wait to make it this summer!

Per the hand-written note on this recipe, I have been making this strawberry bread since 2005. This recipe has made it into my 'best of the best' recipe hall of fame. Today I decided the bread doesn't rise enough so I separaated and beat the egg whites before I added them to the strawberry/oil/egg mixture. I think the breads may have risen a little higher due to this change.  I also usually substitute 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little healthier and I add whatever nuts I have on hand.  Today it was walnuts rather than the pecans the recipe called for.

I went to a strawberry festival and ended up with a half of a flat of strawberries. This is a great recipe although i did alter it quite a bit from the original. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose. 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown. I used 4 cups of strawberries 2 cups in which i pureed into the the flour mixture. I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf. I will eat the muffins now and i froze my loaf for later. :)

Made this last night.  I used my mini loaf pan and the batter was just enough for four loafs.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and decreased the amount like other reviewers suggested.

I'd never heard of strawberry bread before, but decided to try this because I had a ton of strawberries I needed to use.  I took others' suggestions and reduced the oil, sugar, cinnamon, and diced 2 cups of strawberries and pureed 2 cups.  These loaves took over an hour to bake, and the diced strawberries were mushy (although they didn't alter the texture of the bread, just the way it looks).  The flavor reminded me banana bread, minus the banana flavor.  Because it didn't taste like strawberries, I won't make this again...

This was nice and moist, very tasty and baked up in just a few minutes longer than the stated time. I didn't slice the berries, just smashed them up with my hands in the bowl instead. I think though after eating some, I'd rather have mine without the nuts in it. This wasn't too sweet like I thought it was going to be with all the sugar. This recipe even is generous in that you get two loaves from this, one to eat and one to share with a neighbor!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've never thought to make strawberry bread before but had a bunch of strawberries to use up.  I halved the recipe and it turned out 6 small individual-sized loaves.  The taste was wonderful and light.

I recently made the Strawberry Bread for a family reunion. My 89 year old grand aunt loved it and has requested it for her 90th birthday party. 
For her party, I decided to make it as muffins instead of loaves. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes, this recipe made 5 dozen

These were really good!  To make them healther, I substituted 3/4 of the sugar with splenda, and 3/4 of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce, and still it was great!  It was nice and dense.  I used the full cinnamon amount, and I even sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.  Oh, and I baked them in jumbo muffin tins--12 total, about 22 mins.

I had never heard of strawberry bread until recently and it was a huge family hit. I agree: cut the cinnamon in half. I also added a bag of defrosted, squished strawberries. So moist, so good.

I made this bread with a few changes as suggested by other reviewers (including vanilla and more strawberries, using less sugar and oil, and baking in a bundt pan). It came out really moist and perfect with a cold glass of milk or for breakfast with coffee. It is a great way to use extra fresh strawberries.

My husband loves this bread! He brags about it to everyone. I have made it this way and also with half whole wheat flour. It's great. As for the sticking-to-the-pan issue: grease the pans as usual, then just line the bottoms of the pans with wax paper, or you can use parchment, but the waxed is cheaper and works great, spray some Pam or other similar type on the paper, and when you take out the bread, you can easily peel away the paper with nothing lost to the pan. Great recipe!! Thanks

This bread is really yummy! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 4 cups of strawberries instead of 2. I mashed half of the strawberries with the batter and then added 2 cups of sliced strawberries. I used slivered almonds in the bread and then used sliced almonds on top for a nice crust. came out so tasty! I did bake it for 60 minutes and it was still barely done, if you have an older oven like mine, I suggest a longer baking time. five stars :)

This was delish! Everyone at work loved it. I halved the recipe & made 1 loaf. I thought the mix was a little dry so I threw in a little plain yogurt. Served with cream cheese frosting. YUM!

Wonderful recipe.  Definitely would recommend including reviewer suggestions.  I reduced sugar by 1/2 c., swapped out 1/2 cup of oil and replaced with pureed fruit (pears) and added vanilla and extra strawberries.  Very, very good.  I don't think we'll have trouble eating both loves.

This was very good.  I halved the recipe to make less (small household) and included 1/2 c. WW flour for part of the AP flour.  Used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce combination to make it lighter and added 1/4 c. light sour cream for more moisture.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Used slightly less sugar (3/4 c.) and walnuts instead of pecans because that was all I had on hand.  Thanks to someone elses suggestion, I mashed the berries with a fork before adding them to the batter too.  Made as muffins instead of a loaf (individual portions, YAY).  My non-sweets eating DH went back for seconds, so that makes this recipe a keeper.  Thanks for the post!

This is a fantastic bread!  Everyone loved it.  My family of 5 easily ate one loaf at our meal today.  

I substituted half of the oil with extra virgin olive oil.  While I was a bit cocerned about the savory flavor, it was not noticeable once the bread was baked.  I like to think I added a little bit more nutrition this way.  :)

I subbed half of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  This provided a nutty texture without taking away the moisture or making the crumb too dry.  The bread is just a touch "heartier."

I also subbed walnuts for pecans, just because that's what I had.  We love pecans so I'm sure it's great with them, too.

Delicious, moist, with an excellent crust.  I will definitely be remaking this bread again and again!!

Very good, but it did crumble and kind of fall apart.  I used 1 cup white splenda and 1 cup of real light brown sugar and it was just sweet enough.  Cut the oil down to 1 cup, because the berries had a little liquid in them when they sugar was added.  Never had strawberry bread.  Will make it again.  Thanks

I made this last night, in an 8x8 square and a 9x5 loaf (I only have one loaf pan right now).  It came out awesome.  My boyfriend even liked it and he's not a fan of strawberries (or any fruit for that matter...)  I left out the pecans because I didn't have any (and he hates nuts in anything...picky boy)  Also, I only used 1 cup of oil, and threw in one of those single serve cups of applesauce to make up the difference.  I baked both pans at the same time, the 8x8 took about 50 mins and the loaf took 40.  They came out awesome, and I'll definitely try it with pecans sometime when he's not around :-P

Awesome recipe :-)

this was wonderful! i didn't have pecans, so i put in chocolate chips, and it was so good! i had frozen the second loaf, but had to take it out almost immediately, since the first one went so fast (a rarity in my house!) thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! My fiance loved it (w/o nuts) and he won't ever eat Strawberries.  Also, all my co-workers loved it (trust me, it is extremely difficult to find something that everyone in my office likes...this is the 2nd thing ever!)

Healthy changes I made: 1) used only whole wheat flour 2)used 3 1/2 cups strawberries 3)added 1 tsp Vanilla 4) used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and only 1/4 cup veg oil.   People are crazy to use less cinnimon...it was subtle and perfect!  Definitely smash the berries alittle though...was ready in exactly 45 min! I can't stop eating it.

This was by far, the best tasting bread ever! My husband can't stand my cooking or baking, but on rare occasions he will allow me in "his" kitchen to give a new recipe a try. 

He didn't regret it this time around!!!

i just made this and it was easy and really tasty!! i left the recipe as it was, although i didn't have any pecan nuts, so i used chopped walnuts and slivered almonds instead. it turned out great!! the edges/top of my loaf went slightly crispy and chewy, while the center stayed moist, which made it all the more delicious. will definitely make again!

Loved this!  I really like the way it is crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside.  I made slight adjustments -- 3 cups strawberries, 2 cups white flour plus 1 cup wheat flour, and I added 1 tsp vanilla, omitted the nuts.  I baked it in a bundt as recommended.  It took over an hour to cook though, but I waited until the knife came out totally clean and stuck it all the way into the bread to make sure it was cooked throughout.  This is more like a cake in my opinion, but awesome!

Was looking for a way to use up all the strawberries I had and this was a very quick, easy, yummy recipe. Never had strawberry bread before but I definitely enjoyed it. I would probably add more strawberries next time since I felt the strawberries got lost in there.

I have no idea how many times I've made this recipe...at least a dozen or more. I usually delete the nuts and add some vanilla and allspice. I've always had to cook it at least 15 minutes longer. Also, I have NEVER EVER had a problem with crunchy edges, gooey centers...so I have no idea why people are having difficulties with this recipe

Had a lot of strawberries that had to be used up so I made this on a whim.  I ended up having almost 4 cups of sliced berries, but that is ok.  I didn't add extra of anything else, left the same.  I tasted the berries and added sugar accordingly and mashed some of them with a potatoe masher then mixed with the dry ingredients.  I put in a bundt pan instead of two loaf pans and it had to bake for a good hour and even then the very middle is still a bit soggy but it tastes very good.  I added chopped walnuts to mine, didn't have pecans and I like walnuts better.  it would look really nice dusted with some powdered sugar on a nice plate for company for dessert maybe with some fresh strawberries around it.

this bread turned out wonderfully! It slices easily & tastes great. My family loves it.
I used 1 cup of oil instead of 1 1/4 cup & walnuts instead of pecans - it turned out fine.

Strawberries are just coming in season in Ontario, so I had plenty at home and decided to try this recipe.  I had to make some adjustments, and whith those, the bread turned out perfectly:  I reduced flour to 3 cups and replaced 1 cup with whole wheat flour; I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups (and used 1/2 cup brown sugar); I replaced 3/4 cup of oil with plain yogurt; I increased strawberries to 3 cups.  
I baked it in a bundt for 1h10min at prescribed temp.  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  Family and friends loved it, and it was gone in less than 12 hours!

I was expecting this bread to be as good as the banana bread recipe that I make, but nowhere close!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 & used a glass loaf pan...maybe that was my problem!  The bread would not get done in the middle - even after about 20 extra minutes of cook time!  the edges were too hard, and even after it cooled, the middle was still gooey.  When i tunred it out onto the cooling rack, the thing fell apart in the middle, edges staying intact.  not my idea of good.

Very easy and tasty!  Left out the nuts because my husband doesn't like them.  I halved the recipe and the cinnamon was a bit strong, but since I didn't follow the recipe exactly that could be the reason.  Will definitely make again and again while strawberries are in season.

It had a good taste, but it didn't seem to get cooked enough no matter how long I left it in. I did double the strawberries which made it taste pretty good.

I will definitely make this again. It's very moist and tastes great.  I used very overripe strawberries and put in about 3 cups.  Also used candied pecans.  Yum!

This was really yummy. It kind of tastes like bread with built-in jam.  I halved the recipe and made only one loaf.  I used all whole wheat flour, half the sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla, and added 1/2 cup pureed strawberries.  A great way to use up not-so-great strawberries!

This was very good. I halfed the recipe because I didn't know how it would turn out. It was great. I di use 2 cups of strawberries diced instead of sliced and I used applesauce instead of oil and baked it in a stoneware loaf pan for 55 min.

This bread was okay. Nothing spectacular. I was looking for something with more strawberry flavor. From the photo, it looks awesome.  I used 1/2 c. crisco ILO oil as I don't like anything with oil I also followed other suggestions to add more strawberries and I even added a mashed banana but still no strawberry flavor really came through. Oh well, at least I got to use up the strawberries before they went bad :)

This recipe is wonderful, I made it in an 8" round cake pan instead and added more diced strawberries (ended up with two cakes).  It was so good I was volunteered to make it at my daughters school. It's a definite hit with the family and friends.

I thought it was great.  I didn't bake it in the loaf pans, but in a 9x13 and turned out great.  I served it more as a cake.

The bread was good, but everyone said it needed more strawberries. Since we used greenhouse strawberries, the flavor was not very strong, so I would probably add another cup unless I was able to use really yummy strawberries. Definite hit, regardless - kids and adults had seconds and thirds.

This recipe was great. However, I found it tastier to almost puree the strawberries ( 2+ cups) and add chunks of white chocolate to make it more sweet after reading some of the previous reviews.

Very good made with 4 c. strawberries and baked
until center was not mushy (have no idea how long
it finally took).  Tastes best eaten cold with
cream cheese!

This was pretty good. I made it lowfat by subbing cinnamon apple sauce and banana puree for the oil. I think this made the bread more dense. It might be better with a chunkier applesauce, or with the oil. If I make it again, I will add lots more strawberries - they are definitely the best part, they should be in every bite!

This recipe is fantastic. The bread turns out moist and delicious. The only problem is that it disappears of the plate too quickly. I agree with other reviewers though,  the more strawberries the better. I used 3 cups and it was wonderful.

I made this tatsy bread one night for an after dinner treat.  I pureed the strawberries and  wish I would have used more.  Next time I think I'll leave the straberries sliced, too.  Overall, a good bread.

My husband is in the strawberry business, so this time of year, I'm always looking
for a way to use fresh strawberries.   I used applesauce in place of most of the 
oil, and made muffins.  They were very good, and a lot less fattening.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I gave a loaf to my daughter and her family and it was gone in no time... the children loved it!

A very good recipe.  My toddler enjoyed eating it almost as much as helping me make it.  Very moist.

I followed the recipe to a T. it is very dense and extremely greasy. The top is very crunchy, the middle is extremely chewy and soggy in the bottom is crunchy. I have no idea what happened here but I will not be making this recipe again. I had actually doubled it because I had a lot of strawberries so now that's a lot of money down the drain. ??

I love this bread; however, 2nd time I made it, i added a few more strawberries, and baked til toothpick came out clean.  The bread was too moist. 
Also i stored bread wrapped in aluminum foil in refrig, and it made it even more moist.
What is best way to store the bread?

Interesting twist on bread, but mine ended up flaky and fell apart easily.  It could be because I used three eggs instead of four, but other than that, not sure why it turned out the way it did.  Still a tasty treat that my kids enjoyed.

I listened to a few others reviewers and added an additional 2 cups of sliced strawberries, lowered sugar to 1.5 cups and oil to 1 cup. I wanted to give these away as gifts so I used 6 small individual loaf pans and baked for 40 minutes. They came out really nice and looked fabulous when I put them in festive baggies and tied with twine.

Thank you so much for the great recipe!

Love this loaf! Nice change and lovely flavour with the sweet strawberries and crunchy nuts.  I did make a change though - substituted unsweetened applesauce for half the oil.  Still came out nice and moist.  Great for brunch with friends

I love this strawberry bread, turns out great every time! I like to add some raw sugar to the top, yummy! 
I have one little problem though, I have a butt load of zucchini and I wanted to make a strawberry/zucchini bread but can't find a recipe that I like as much as this one.

Replaced half of the oil with applesauce, and cut cinnamon in half, following other suggestions. No almonds, so added 1 t almond extract.
Tastes fine, but strawberry taste isn't very pronounced.

Really Yummy..I took some advice and mashed some of the berries and added 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Also used a tsp of Strawberry Extract - which enhances the overall strawberry taste. Oh - and used Bobs Redmill GF flour - AMAZING!

Used applesauce in place of oil.  Also used 2 cups chopped rhubarb and 2 cups sliced strawberries.  I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. This was very moist and tasty.  Makes 2 loaves which disappear quickly at our house.

I halved the recipe as I didn't have enough strawberries for 2 pans. Followed the advice of others and increased strawberries to 2 cups (smooshed), reduced oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Came out beautifully with a nice strawberry flavor. The pecans add a nice crunch.

This was a big hit and very much like a recipe I have at home. Glad I could find one similar on the road. One thing I noticed and rectified with my second batch was my recipe at home called for more strawberries (four cups). Otherwise, it is a great recipe.

This is a delicious strawberry bread. I made a batch of muffins for my kids to take camping but realized that 1 & 1/4 c of oil was too much when the cupcake papers were soaked on the bottom. (No I did not grease the muffin tin) so I  put an extra paper under them and away they went. My 2nd batch was perfect when I only added 3/4 c oil. Still moist but not wet. Only problem is now we can’t stop eating them.

Made this exactly as recipe was written as I always do. Lacked strawberry flavor and the cinnamon was over powering.Next time I’ll follow advice of others and cut cinnamon in 1/2 and double strawberries, probably purée some.

Great recipe!  So simple and quick.  I used about 1/4 c. less oil and 1/2 c. less sugar because we typically do similar mods with all our baking recipes.  I also used this to make muffins instead.  Also, what we do with loaf recipes.  So, those mods worked great with this recipe, will use this again!

i used 4 cups of strawberries, reduced the cinnamon,  reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, and substituted applesauce for half the oil.  The bread was sweet, and a real hit!

I made the recipe as is and it is good, but that being said next time I plan on doing what other reviewers did, cutting back the oil and adding more strawberries. My husband also suggested rhubarb would go well so I'm going to try that st one point too. The strawberry taste isn't as dominant but it's still a good cake bread with the recipe as is.

I also took the advice and doubled the strawberries, so it took a little longer in the oven. It was well worth it though, three people devoured the first loaf in minutes. I will definitely be making this regularly.

I took other reviewers advice and increased the strawberries to 4 cups, reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I used the full amount of sugar because my berries weren't very sweet.  Next time, I'll try pureeing 1/2 of the berries first, so there aren't as many chunks in the finished product.  Really moist, with great flavor!

Made this twice so far,  first time specific to directions (I didn't have fresh strawberries so I used some strawberry dessert cups that are smashed and diced) .  Turned out fantastic!  Absolutely loved the top when it came out crispy on the top and around the edges.  Second time I added extra strawberry cups but forgot to decrease other liquid amount and used applesauce for the oil; this batch came out with good flavor but overly dense.

Anyone else have trouble getting the bread to bake thoroughly? I followed the directions but the center of both loaves never cooked. Tested my oven’s temperature gage and my oven works fine. I had to end up throwing both loaves away :( I tried to save what I could and tried some just to say I ate it... the bread was delicious! So mad it didn’t work ??

Excellent and easy to make.  As many reviews suggested, I added more sugar (to taste), doubled the strawberries, and added a bit of vanilla extract.   This will definitely be made again and again!

The loaves were wonderfully moist and flavorful with one slight flavor that my family didn't like.  The cinnamon was a bit overpowering as the amount shown in the recipe.

I was a little disappointed on how the bread turned out.  It was very dense and dry.   You could hardly tell this was a strawberry bread.  I probably will not make this again.  :/

Turned out moist and full of strawberry flavor. It was perfect. I followed previous reviewers substituting an extra 2 cups of pureed strawberries and reduced vegetable oil to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious! Made the recipe as written. My entire family loves it and asked me to make this again. I used fresh strawberries and will use frozen in the winter. Easy, quick, and I even made a second batch in our bread maker. Turned out great in the bread maker. Will continue to make it, thank you Ellen..

This is the best, most addictive quick bread I’ve ever tasted.  Per the comments I only used a teaspoon cinnamon and added a teaspoon vanilla.  Also increased strawberries to 4 cups (and skipped the pecans because I didn’t have any on hand).  Crunchy and perfect on the outside with a delicious soft center.  I made two loaves this morning and have already eaten almost an entire one ??.  I am now obsessed with this recipe.

It  was very flavorful and moist. I had walnuts on hand and used them. I cut the recipe in half and made one loaf and it worked well. I plan to make it again. It would be a good Christmas gift.

Made this and it actually turned out really good (I’m not the best baker). Kids liked it (and they’re picky), husband liked it and I have thoroughly enjoyed eating too many slices!  

Will definitely
Be making again!

Was great. I used  2 cups whole wheat flour and the rest unbleached white, added bran and flax seed also. I only had 1/4 cup oil so I added sour cream and buttermilk to make it the right consistency. I also hope only used 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty. I did not sugar the strawberry’s as they we Sweet already. It turned out better than the last time I made it using all oil.

Added a few more strawberries than called for, almost the whole pound. Smelled delicious. Checked both loaves for doneness - passed. removed from oven and cooled. One loaf baked perfectly; the other was underdone and was discarded. 
Friends and family loved it.

Delicious! I was serving more people so doubled the recipe and it doubled perfectly. I followed the ingredient list as is (other than toasting the pecans before chopping) and loved both the flavor and texture...I wouldn’t change a thing. I made regular loaf, mini loaves, and large muffins, and all turned out great. Thank you for this recipe. It will be one of my new “go-to”s!

This bread was delicious.  I halved the recipe for one loaf.  But I did use 2 cups of strawberries for just the one loaf.  I mashed half of the strawberries and lightly chopped the the other cup of strawberries. I also made a vanilla glaze to top the loaf.  The finished product was very pretty, and the strawberry flavor was excellent. My husband said he had never heard of strawberry bread, but he loved it.  I loved it as well even though I am not a big strawberry fan.

Great as written. I usually use strawberries I have frozen whole, zap them briefly in the microwave to thaw enough to get a knife through, cut in half, and stir in. This seems to preserve the structural integrity of the berries during baking. I have also baked this in one 13 x 9 pan for 40 minutes, and that works fine. This last time, I used a combination of applesauce, canola oil, and olive oil, and cannot taste any difference.

Very yummy, but here are some things I've done to make this less caloric.  1) Decrease the oil to 3/4C, and add 1/2-1 C extra fruit of whatever kind you have (you can even puree some of it).  2) Decrease the sugar to 1C - the fruit makes this sweet enough.  I've done this once with rhubarb and once with peaches.

Delicious with a thin coat of spreadable cream cheese!  When I make this bread, I gently crush the strawberries before adding the other ingredients.  I've been making Strawberry Bread that way for years, using a different recipe, so I'd just followed through and did the same thing with this one!  The recipe is fabulous!

I was dubious after reading some of the reviews but it sounded so nice and I had the strawberries so I went for it. I am so glad I did! Really delicious! I cut back a little on the sugar, salt  and oil and it came out beautifully.

Adjusted cinnamon to 1/2 t., used bunt pan, increased amount of strawberries, used 1 1/2 cups of sweetener and, 1/2 cup of sugar for my diabetic family, and cooked for 1 hr.  Had a crispy outside and moist inside. My picky family liked it very much.  I will be making this again.

This is my go-to recipe after getting a bunch of strawberries from the farm. It’s a family favorite!  I follow the directions except for adding extra strawberries and vanilla and I always bake in a bundt pan. Perfect every time.

WHAT A DISASTER!  TOO much liquid caused both "loaves" to sink in the middle - totally NOT DONE.  I knew 1-1/4 cups of oil AND 4 eggs AND sugared strawberries would be too wet, but as usual, I follow recipes exactly.  Won't make this again.

Wow! Love this recipe, as do my family and co-workers. I made this on Saturday. Friday was National Banana Bread Day, so I had made that Friday for my son who loves my banana bread. He came over on Saturday, so I gave him a piece of the strawberry bread. He liked it better that my banana bread. I gave a piece to a co-worker and he said I was in the wrong profession; I should open my own bakery.

It was very easy to make. And so good. I only made one, so I baked half of the recipe. I did add a little almond extract, but that's my favorite in most baked goods. Try this recipe.

I've made this three times, and it's an easy, delicious bread. As is, with no changes, the recipe gets 4 stars from me, because it always takes WAY longer than 45-50 minutes to be baked through. But since I don't mind waiting longer, I'm happy to make it again and again.

A couple suggested changes: 1)I mix extra cinnamon and sugar together and 5 minutes before the strawberry bread is done baking, I sprinkle it on top of the loaf. It makes a delicious topping.

2)The strawberries: My girlfriend and I were theorizing that it might takes ages to bake through (long enough that the crust starts threatening to burn) because the strawberries release so much water during the cooking. They also look pale and kinda gross when you look at them in a baked, sliced cross-section. So next time I think we will slice and sugar the strawberries, then roast them at 350 for 10-20 minutes before mixing them with the eggs and oil and proceeding with the recipe. It might minimize all the extra moisture, and lessen the baking time, as well as keeping the strawberries red and their flavor concentrated. It might also mess things up by drying it out too much; I'll update once I try it!

All in all, even without changes, a great sweet yummy snack or dessert, and very simple, even for people who are more adept at cooking meals than baking, like myself.

I added extra strawberries and vanilla as suggested. The flavor of bread is delicious. However, after the timer went off, I used a toothpick to see if they were done and the toothpick came out clean. As the bread cooled the middle sunk deep into bread and it wasn't done. So my advise is to leave it in longer to make sure it's completely baked if using extra berries.

I didn't have any pecans, so instead I added a healthy dose of chopped Cuban mojito mint (I halved the recipe, so for the full recipe it would have probably been around a cup and a half of chopped leaves), and then split the dough into two small aluminum bread pans (I prefer using the small ones because you get more edges). I left one as is, but to the other one I added a handful of chocolate chips. They were both absolutely delicious, they're among the most amazing breads I've ever had. I'm not sure which one I like better.

Delicious, though I made quite a few changes.
Peaches instead of strawberries
Half a banana for each egg (vegan version)
Walnuts instead of pecans
1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2

I don't like cinnamon in any fruit bread, so I used vanilla and a Tbs of grenadine syrup. It gives a pinkish color to the batter plus adds a nice fruity flavor.
I also used 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda in the recipe. No nuts either.
For pretty presentation layer some sliced strawberries on the batter prior to baking.

I diced the strawberries and omitted the pecans. It was really tasty. I might add chocolate chips next time

I had two gallons of strawberries in the fridge and decided I would try this recipe. I halved the recipe and added a few more strawberries than it called for. It turned out delicious. I will definitely make this bread again!

Quite good - although I think I prefer the taste of butter in quick breads / muffins instead of oil. I also added a splash of vanilla. I would reduce the oil a bit next time as it was quite greasy.  Lastly, I made into muffins instead of a loaf and baked about 18 - 20 minutes.  They turned out well.

We love this bread.  I've made it several times.  The only arguments are whether it is really bread or cake.  I doubled the strawberries and mashed them, cut the cinnamon back just a little.  Once because I didn't have pecans, I tossed in about 2 tsp of Almond Extract, and the family still loved it.

Followed other reviewers' advice to double the strawberries, cut  oil down to 3/4 cup,  reduce sugar to 1.5 cups and add 1 tsp vanilla.  Otherwise, I do not believe it would have turned out as well.

Won't make again.  Made recipe as written, much too oily and not sweet at all.  Took about 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe states .

I made the recipe exactly.  It was only okay as a strawberry bread but pretty good as a cinnamon bread.  Very heavy on cinnamon and couldn't  taste any of the strawberries.

Yum, yum, yum! We really like this bread. My changes were: cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and increase strawberries to 4 cups. I cut back a little on the cinnamon to 2 tsp, but next time I’ll use 1 T, because the hubby says you can’t have too much cinnamon. On loaf for him to take to work and one loaf for us. Perfect!

y'all dont need to follow the recipe when it comes to how much strawberries you need. i used extra and i still feel like i should've gone with double.

also, frozen strawberries are the same quality as fresh!! just use frozen berries!! and less sugar like holy  im gonna remake this with half the amount of sugar and make up for it with some extra flour. 

anyways: delicious fluffy sweet bread, easy to make, ive run out of cinnamon and now ive got to use something else, maybe cardmon

Delicious! I used chopped frozen strawberries and a much simpler way of mixing--liquids first, dry ingredients, then strawberries coated in a tablespoon of flour. I baked them as muffins and they came out light, airy, and cinnamon-sugary!

This was wonderful. I agree with previous posters- I doubled the strawberries and squashed them ( otherwise you end up with big holes in the bread) and for a half recipe only put in 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp vanilla and 1/4 cup of oil- I used canola. It is soooo yummy. Thank you!

Great recipe! Very easy and the result is fantastic. When I added the liquid ingredients to the dry ones, the batter was very heavy and I added a bit of milk to be able to mix everything in the bowl. Highly recommended :-)

Loved this recipe.  I added a tsp. Of vanilla and baked longer than the recipe called for.  The crispy top and sides was just as good as the soft middle.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Absolutely the best bread I've eaten or made.
What I did is to put in 2 cups coarsley mashed strawberries, 1 cup blueberries and 2 ripe bananas mashed.
I did not have 4 cups of strawberries so I decided to make the other 2 cups of fruits out of blueberries ( which I had excess of)  and ripe bananas which I also had excess of. I decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups which was plenty sweet enough . I decrease the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Everything else as described in recipe.
In order to solve the "wet" fruits I mix it in the combined dry flour mixture first to "coat" and also so that the berries will be distributed evenly throughout bread while baking rather than sinking to bottom.
That solved the wet fruits issue in batter when baked as mentioned in another  review.
Baking took longer than 1 hr. Mine took 1 hrs 15 min on 325-350 depending on your oven. You can also insert a toothpick for doneness. Be patient. It will turn out. The bread was so moist  and delicious!
As always thanks for other reviewers feedback and to Ellen for posting!

Kidlets liked it but I have a thing with mushy strawberries. Also, the bread around the strawberries was mushy. Might try flour and not sugar to coat the strawberries, use strawberry bits, or use dried strawberries next time.

I loved this.  I wanted a strong strawberry flavor so i doubled the strawberries. I pulverized them before adding to get a nice pink cakey bread.  So good, I'm going to try it with blueberries next!

I have been making this bread for over 30 years. I got it from my ex mother in law. It's the best holiday bread ever. I do change it up a bit, I add extra cinnamon and I use one LG container of frozen strawberries with juice and one package frozen strawberries without juice. I don't thaw the strawberries without juice be cause they have a wonderful taste and texture after they cook I the bread. I always get asked for the recipe, and everyone who tries it loves it.

Delicious!  This recipe is my go-to food to give to new parents that have had a baby and it gets rave reviews all the time.  Occasionally, I have added additional cinnamon.  Instead of fresh strawberries, I have even used frozen strawberries and it still comes out fabulous!

I loved the recipe! I made it with my mother and it was really easy  to prepare it, and it was delicious. I was thinking about smashing up more berries and drizzling the juice onto the dough for the bread part of the muffin to give it a little more flavor. Overall, it was AMAZING!

Made this today. Had extra strawberries and wanted to make a cake initially. Saw this recipe and decided to make it. It's outstanding! It's the best fruit bread  I ever had. 
I made it taking into consideration the other reviewers'  recommendations. Used 4 cups of strawberries. Reduced sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups. Also used half the amount of cinnamon. Used same amount of oil because I didn't have apple sauce. I used walnuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any. Wow it's amazing. I wanna eat the whole thing if I could. BTW I'm not a professional baker I just try recipes every now and then so this was easy to make. I did use bundt cake and baked for 50 minutes. Definitely will make it again. I'm in love!

There is way too much oil in this for my taste. Maybe 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil, plus more strawberries, would really help it taste better. Not bad overall.

Very moist bread. Delicious!  People always ask for my recipe.

It's a yummy way to use up strawberries  before they go bad.

Making this was an absolute delight  I had gone strawberry picking and having fresh berries in this recipe  was to die for   The  only thing I changed  was not cutting the berries in small pieces  but in halves  that way they didn't melt away in the batter while cooking   Excellent and everyone loved it!,

I used Coconut Sugar instead of the regular, added 2 tsp of vanilla. Swapped the Pecans for Walnuts since I had some on hand. Replaced 1/2c of the oil Strawberry banana  nectar. I also reduced the sugar by  1/2c. One more thing, I used a Pound of strawberries in a combination of sliced & diced. It turned out Perfect to me.

Changes I made:
1/2 cup veg. Oil and 3/4 cup olive oil 
Took out cinnamon due to allergy 
Put in 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 
Used walnuts instead of pecans
Sliced my strawberries thick and used 3 cups instead of 2
Turned out excellent! Nice strawberry flavor! Dense bread!

I'll certainly make this recipe again. It's delicious, and also great to serve folks with a dairy intolerance. It did need 50 min. to cook through thoroughly! I used parchment paper instead of greasing and flouring the pans.

Easy, quick and yummy. Got lots of compliments from my wife.
It's hard to stop once you start eating it.
Great match with ice-cream or coffee.

My grandchildren and I picked strawberries at a local farm and came home to bake this delicious bread. I hesitated to put strawberries in a bread as past attempts resulted in a wet, soggy loaf. This loaf (2 loaves), following the recipe without changes,  was excellent. The cinnamon gave it a nice flavor. It  was easier to slice the second day.  One loaf to eat, the other to send home with the grandchildren- a very successful baking experience for all.

Excellent. Reminds me of an apple bread recipe I make but with strawberries. Don't put the strawberries along the top. The bread was mushy under those.

Followed other reviews: substitute sugar for zero calorie/diabetic friendly, half gluten free flour/half white flour, more strawberries, mixed some in the blender which really does make a huge difference. I've made this recipe following the exact instructions and for personal preferences, appreciate the most helpful suggestions from peeps who already played with the recipe. Gave four stars because I changed too many of the original ingredients it's not right to put five without rewriting the entire recipe. My suggestion is to read most of the reviews and play with the original recipe as it's versatile.

Strawberry Banana Bread anyone?  I used 3 cups strawberries, ~ 1 cup mashed bananas (3 medium) 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce (you could probably use all applesauce instead of the oil), 1 Tbsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg.  The remaining ingredients were the same as in the recipe.  I also beat the eggs and oil first then added the bananas to that mixture and beat until mixed. Then added it to all the dry ingredients and hand stirred until well blended. Lastly, I folded in the strawberries until just mixed. Yummy!

Very good bread! After going strawberry picking and coming home with an abundance of strawberries I was looking for recipes to use up some of our strawberries.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the only addition of 2 tsp of vanilla. This bread is dense, moist and tasty. I personally would prefer more of a strawberry flavor. Next time I make this I'm going to use 3 or 4 cups of strawberries. I froze one loaf so we will see if this bread freezes well. Definitely will make again!

Like others, I used 2 more cups of berries mashed in addition to the 2 cups sliced berries.  Reduced the sugar by 1/4 c.,  substituted 1 c. Unsweetened applesauce for the oil, only using 1/4 c oil. Mixed everything in one bowl.  Baked about 50 minutes in 2 loaf pans.   Had no trouble getting it out of the pans after making sure they were greased well. Turned out well although even with 4 cups of berries it doesn't have a real strong strawberry flavor.

I made it with a few changes.  I did use more strawberries (4 cups).  I did not add the strawberries until the end and folded in with the pecans.  Also, being lazy, I changed the order in which I made it.  I did slice the strawberries and added a little sugar. Beat the eggs, added the oil and rest of the sugar and beat until  well blended. Add cinnamon, salt and baking powder, beat, then beat in flour just until moistened.  Fold in strawberries then pecans.

Warning! Do not make this if you are trying to lose a few pounds. This recipe make two delicious loaves and the scent of it alone will draw you in. I halved the oil and subbed applesauce and it was super moist. I added nutmeg because I think everything should have nutmeg. I also doubled the strawberries and reduced the amount of sugar.

I used whole wheat flour,  both brown & white sugar, added vanilla, added more berries, and reduced the amount of oil by a fourth.  My cooking time took a little longer than the recipe. The result is fantastic. Very dense and moist! Great flavor!

Ps - I quadrupled the recipe to make several muffins and loaves at one time. The recipe easily stood up to the mega batch.

I LOVED this bread. HOWEVER, I omitted the nuts and cinnamon. Just didn't sound like a good combination with strawberries. I also added a little cream cheese and strawberry yogurt for flavor. I increased the amount of strawberries after reading others comments about lack of strawberry flavor. I will make this again...SOON!

Very Very good! Molto buono! As many previous suggestions, I increased strawberries double portion, but put less pecans. I cooked one big loaf pan. I didn't imagine it was going to be sooo good!! Thank you for this great and sweet recipe! My colleagues loved it!

I made as directed except I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. That was before I read the reviews. Tasted just fine. I didn't think it was too much cinnamon at all. I will play with it though. Next time, more strawberries, substitute butter for some oil, add vanilla, and substitute brown sugar for half the overall sugar.

Great recipe! I did modify some of the ingredients. I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 3/4 cup of Olive oil, added 1 tsp of vanilla. I beat the eggs for a minute then added the chopped strawberries and beat for another minute, then added the oil and the vanilla and beat for another 30 seconds. It turned out delicious and had a very nice consistency.

Great taste and great outcome in smaller pans, but very sticky batter that takes a long time to fully cook the center and stuck to the sides of the pans. Cooked 3 individual pieces: 2 in smaller bread loaf pans and 1 in a regular-sized pan. The regular-sized pan ended up sinking in the middle with the bread perfectly cooked on the sides. Will be trying a different recipe... great end taste, though!

Very good! I didn't have pecans, but it tasted good just the same. Next time I will omit the cinnamon, I don't think it's necessary.

This is so wonderful.  I was 1/2 C short of the strawberries.  I made up the difference with cranberries.  Wow!  I'm doing this again tomorrow.

Modified the recipe as recommended by others, reduced sugar to 1 1\2 cups, cinnamon to 1\2 TBS, vegetable oil to 3/4 cup and increased strawberries to 3 cups the strawberries where cut into quarters and sliced.  The texture was perfect and the sugar and cinnamon was not over powering but it was a little bland so I may not reduce if made again. The 8" aluminum loaf  pans I used came in a three  pack so I made 2 1/2 loafs.  Going to serve it as desert with cool whip. All in all a good recipe.

I made this as written a couple of times and it was really good,. When I made it again, I only had frozen strawberries. It was just as delicious. I now make it all of the time with the following changes.
1 teaspoon cinnamon instead of 1 Tbsp, 
1 cup canola oil, 
2  - 2.5 cups (16-20 oz) frozen sliced strawberries, thawed in the refrigerator.  (I take the strawberries out of the refrigerator early to take the chill off.) 
Mix all of the dry ingredients first - 3 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, then add the liquid ingredients: 1 cup oil, 4 eggs and the strawberries along with the juice.  I omit the nuts. I stir with a large spoon until well mixed, but I am careful not to over mix. I use 2 loaf pans sprayed with Joy cooking spray.  It takes around 50 min in my oven. It is so good. It is one of my husband's favorites during the holidays.

Made it without the nuts, but otherwise it was perfect.  Nicely crisp around the edges, but moist inside.  Wonderful flavor, sweet, but not too sweet.

This recipe is perfect as is! So delicious. I doubled it and only had two loaf pans, so baked two in 8" round pans. I just had to bake those for a little less time. Thank you!

This was great. The other reviews helped me add the perfect touches to make this awesome. A little vanilla extract and sugar on top. I also added a splash of lemon extract to bring out the strawberry flavor. This was a GREAT use for "extra" strawberries.

I replaced the oil with applesauce and only used 1 Tbsp of oil. Great way to use up strawberries that are past their prime. I used the advice of other reviewers to keep half the strawberry mix separate and chunky, while pureeing the other half. 
This molded quickly, so I next time would store in the fridge.

Loved this!  I used chopped and halved strawberries based on reviews.  Made in bread pans and in a bundt pan.  Both worked well.  I freeze large servings in baggies so it's great for a quick snack or dessert.

Love this bread! And so does everyone else :-)  I cut the strawberries up into smaller pieces and chopped the nuts smaller too. This kept a nice mix throughout the bread. I used extra virgin olive oil and it's so moist and delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

Wonderful bread!  I followed the advice of some others and halved the amount of cinnamon.  I replaced 1/2 c. oil with a 1/2 c. applesauce and used 3 c. strawberries that I froze last year.  I also used 1 c. chopped pecans which was plenty!  Love this recipe, it is definitely a keeper!!!
**Update**
I substituted sour cherries for the strawberries, following the recipe as written with the rest of the ingredients. Very good!

I backed off on the cinnamon to 1 tsp. All the other ingredients were per recipe. It took about an extra twenty minutes baking time because of all the moisture.
Next time, I will substitute half the flour with whole wheat flour, and back the oil off to 1 C, substituting 1/2 C with softened butter.

This bread is delicious. I did make a few modifications based on other reviews. I used 3/4 cup of coconut oil instead of vegetable, and 4 cups of strawberries. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla, and avoided "blending" the strawberries. After I let them sit with the sugar for about 15 minutes, I mashed them lightly with my potato masher and then added the other ingredients. I didn't put the pecans in the batter, but sprinkled salted maple pecans on the top of one loaf before putting it in the oven. Absolutely delicious. Loved the one with the pecans more than the one without!

I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and used oiled parchment paper to line my loaf tins (I find that they come out much easier this way). Overall a very good bread which I will be making again.

This was delicious! I replaced most of the oil with applesauce and pureed strawberries and it turned out so moist. Husband ate two slices and finished the loaf by the next day! So glad the recipe yields two loafs. Sliced the second loaf and froze in plastic wrap, defrost in the microwave for 40 seconds. So yummy for breakfast with some lemon curd. Will definitely be in my usual rotation.

I halved the recipe. It took more than an hour before it was done. When I tried to get the bread out of the loaf pan it crumbled in half. My husband said it tasted good even though we had to eat it in broken pieces. If I make this again, I will cut back on the cinnamon and slice my strawberries smaller.

I made it exactly like the recipe said and it came out great!  I kept one loaf for home and the other I took to work to share.  They raved about it as well.  I will say, one of the loafs took exactly 45 minutes, but the other took 55.  I firmly believe it was the cheap back-up pan I used. Not sure what metal is was made of, but I won't be using that again. I also will be trying this with blueberries and rasberries, next!

This was delicious - with the changes I made. 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla. 2 packages of strawberries cut into quarters. No sugar on the strawberries beforehand, and only 1 1/2 cups. Butter instead of vegetable oil. Everything else the same - made 2 loaves. One loaf was gone in 2 days! Highly recommend.

It's very good! Thanks for sharing.
I wanna try it but find myself without fresh strawberries, but with plenty blackberries and raspberries. I use 3/4 cup of oil and 1 1/2 cup of sucanat. Yuuummy!
Made it again and again, my husband love it! And asking for more and more... thank you, is so versatile, it makes my imagination fly! My kids? Love it!

it is a moist but dense bread. it rises very little and i used fresh baking soda and salt.  the only trouble i had, was converting 2c strawberries which so very variable and slicing them.  couldnt figure our if i needed 2c of sliced berries so had to guess. it does have a great taste.

I love, love, love this recipe. I just made it today and I'm actually having a piece of it as I type this. Thank you so much! It is absolutely delicious.
I did add something of my own. After greasing the pan, I added a thin layer of crushed/sliced almons at the bottom. I love the moist fluffiness of the bread with he crunchiness of the almonds. Mmmm mom mom mom.

Didn't feel anything special about this cake.  It just tastes like any other recipe that mixes fruit, flour and eggs.

So good! My husband really liked the crispy texture of this bread (he thought it had a sugar crust), yet it was still super moist.

Very good, but I modified it a lot. I halved the recipe, but used nearly three cups of strawberries. I mixed the entire 1 cup of sugar with strawberries instead of with the dry mixture. Per one of the reviews, I used only 1/4 cup of oil and added vanilla. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. Quite yummy, and very strawberry the way I made it! Took a little over an hour to bake in my oven.

This needs three cups instead of two of sliced strawberries and backed down to 1.5 cups of sugar.  I put the topping from my banana muffins on it and baked it in muffin tins to reduce the baking time.  I fed 9 people breakfast with the amount this makes.

Perfect recipe for freshly picked berries.  Increased to 4 cups of strawberries (2 cups chopped, 2 cups mashed), decreased the sugar and oil.  Will definitely make again and try other variations.

Fabulous! That's what I have to say. Did loaf with pecans and one without, both turned out absolutely delicious. Glad I found this recipe when I did, just in time for strawberry picking season.

I used the 1/2 recipe amounts.  I feel the recipe should be more specific about the amount of sugar used on the strawberries.  Looking at the recipe, my initial thought was 1 cup of sugar added to the strawberries.  Also, use 3 small pans rather than 1 9".  Easier to slice and bake more quickly and uniform.  Nice to share using smaller pans.

Ooohhhh sooooo good! Only changes were too add extra strawberries and reduce the cinnamon (rather taste the fresh fruit than the spice) to less than 1 tsp. looking forward to getting another bucket of strawberries and baking more!

I made this last night and it came out kinda crunchy on the outside but really moist on the inside. My fiancé really liked it as did I. I halved the recipe and I didn't measure out the amount of strawberries I used. I had a normal carton from the grocery store that was starting to get a little mushy so I just cut them all up and threw them in which was way more than a cup. I didn't add sugar to them they were already sweet enough. And I didn't add the oil and eggs to the strawberries just added it to the flour mixture and mixed well and then folded in the strawberries last. Seemed to work fine.  The only issue I had was that after 45 min this wasn't even close to being done. You could tell just by looking at the middle of it. I ended up baking it for about 25 min longer than the recipe called for. I was a little worried the ends would be dry but they were fine!  Other than the timing issue this was a really moist bread!

This bread was fantastic! I made one loaf without the pecans (my husband doesn't like nuts), and one loaf with nuts. The one with was definitely the winner! The nuts were crunchy and added a lot of flavor. I also used about three cups of strawberries. I will definitely make this again.

at the grand old age of 55 I have never baked a cake or scone in my life, to my families delight they were thrilled that I gave it a go and also scored it a 5/5. sister in law wondered what a little bit of baking powder would do for it.....so I am asking you....

Dense moist cake.  Only problem was that the cinnamon overpowered the taste and you couldn't taste the strawberries.  Made a second time and changed cinnamon to 2 tsp and strawberries to 2 1/2 cups -- much better this time.

My husband couldn't stop raving about this bread!  I made it exactly like the recipe only cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups and even that was pretty sweet.  I could have easily cut it in half and not missed it.

I followed the lead from other reviews and I doubled the strawberries. I pureed 2 cups and sliced the other 2 cups.  I still did not achieve a strong strawberry flavor.  The bread was just ok.  I really would not recommend.

Love this loaf!  Everything about it is wonderful.  It's moist, slightly strawberry flavoured in a good way, not fake strawberry flavour.  The crust is golden and crunchy.  I toast the pecans before making this for more flavour.   The best loaf cake I've ever made and I've been using this recipe for more than 25 years.

This was delicious!  We had four quarts of strawberries in our CSA share one week and this was a great, delicious way to use some.  The bread is easy to make and has a wonderful flavor.  I used very finely chopped pecans and chopped the strawberries, as well.  Baked about 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for as it did not test done when the time was up.

Made this bread today and we loved it.  One loaf is already gone.  I used 4 cups of sliced strawberries and used 2 tsp. of cinnamon, as my husband isn't a fan of it.  Those were the only changes I made.  If you use dark pans you need to reduce the oven temp to 325 degrees so it doesn't dry out.  Will definitely make it again and again!

Love, love, loved this bread! 

Used the recommendations in the reviews and made bread with the following adjustments: 4 cups strawberries (half pureed), 3/4 cup oil, 1 tsp. cinnamon. 

Came out perfect - absolutely delicious, very moist, and much lighter than I expected.

This bread is so good. I had some ripe strawberries in the fridge and they were past for eating. I checked the site for a recipe and found this awesome bread. After I read reviews, I definitely decide to double the strawberry and reduce the cinnamon as everyone suggested. I diced those strawberries and set a side in a bowl. Moreover, as I don't like eating too much sugary things. I reduced 1/2 cup sugar from the original recipe so, I used only 1 1/2 cup white sugar. Plus my ripe strawberries were loosing too much juice and to make the dough less runny I reduced the oil. So, I used only 3/4 cup veggie oil in it. Actually, I came up with this solution after I read one of the reviewer so, thank you for that advise, it really worked fine for me. I baked 1 hour and it was baked perfectly.

I will absolutely bake this bread again and again. Me and my hubby loved the moisturized textured bread. Thank you Ellen and reviewers made it perfect.

Very disappointing! I used raspberries instead of strawberries. Nothing else was changed. The loaf was dry and crumbly. The texture was dense but overall, not a delicious recipe.

Very yummy.  I did add more strawberries like others recommended.  I served warm with cool whip.  It was my version of a fancy strawberry shortcake - that was less work to make.

I just made this recipe as muffins.  It made 21 muffins, I probably could have re-proportioned to make 24.  I baked them 22 minutes at the original recipe temperature.  I added a splash of vanilla.  They are light and fluffy but I wish I could taste the berries more.  The family is liking them.

I made this bread today.  After reading many reviews, I did add 2t strawberry extract to the mix.  I also did not add the full tablespoon of ground cinnamon, just a dash. My husband, daughter and I loved the bread!  There is only half of the first loaf left.  I quickly froze the second loaf for later.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.

I made this according to recipe, mine came out much heavier than I would like, I also felt the cinnamon was way too much.  I will make it again and omit cinnamon, cut back on oil and add vanilla.  Then let you know how that comes out.

Want to try this recipe, but I was wondering if anyone has made it using less sugar. It seems like a lot of sugar for the amount of the other ingredients.

I love this bread, and everyone that I've made this for loves it! I have used more berries then suggested, and still turns out great. I have found then making them in mini loaf pans (only filling them half full) solves the problem of them not getting done in the middle. Thanks!

I've made this twice already, both times using frozen strawberries from this past summer.  The cinnamon/pecan combo didn't do it for me with strawberries, so I subbed lemon zest and almonds both times.  Definitely something I'll make again.

Sooo sooo good. I did change things up a little bit to make the recipe healthier. First off, I only made one loaf. 1) I halved the sugar and used 5 packets of powdered stevia. 2) Instead of strawberries, I used two cups of frozen berries. 3) I used only three tablespoons of vegetable oil, I mashed a ripe banana for the rest of the oil. Before I mixed the fruit and the oil together, I microwaved the berries and the banana. After blending the fruit and oil mixture, I added an additional 1/2 cup fresh berries, just to give the loaf some texture. Didn't have any pecans, so I left them out. Result: Fantastic!!! If you need anymore sweetness, I would maybe try some vanilla extract and liquid stevia. All in all though, I was very pleased.

Delicious! Made just one loaf with 1 c puréed berries + 1 c chopped chopped, 3/4 c sugar, 1/4 c + 2T oil, and 1/2 of everything else. Would be yummy to use 1 c purée and 1 c rhubarb next time...maybe with a little streusel on top.

Why does this recipe call for buttering and flouring the pan vs. Paming it, because it sticks to the pan when you don't! Lesson learned the hard way. Tasted delicious though...

Great recipe. I too, had a ton of strawberries gifted to me and wanted to do something creative. I did scale it down to make 1 loaf instead of 2. I did 2 cups of strawberries (1 cup sliced, and 1 cup pureed) added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 2 eggs, 1 and 1/2 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp salt and omitted the pecans. At 350 degrees for 45 min, the middle still was a little runny, I popped it back in for another 15 min. I think it came out great, nice and moist. My co-worker is raving about it right now and she's a hard one to win over. I want to make muffins with this too, I bet that will be awesome, and fill it with cheesecake or cream cheese frosting. I will use this recipe forever!

Very tasty bread. I doubled the strawberries, 1/2 sliced, 1/2 puréed. Cut oil down by 1/2 and replaced with applesauce. I would make this bread again, but I'm also going to continue to look for other recipes that might knock my socks off.

I loved the results - the strawberry bread.  After reading some of the other ratings, I decided to double the strawberries to increase the flavor.  I also used 1/2 applesauce instead of oil.  Then because the batter was so liquidy, I added about a third cup of flour to give a little more body.  By this time, I had so much batter that I had to use an additional loaf pan - though it was a small sized loaf pan - 4x8.  Also, since I used the extra pan, the timing was pretty accurate - I had to bake the smaller pan for 40 minutes and the larger pans took 55 mins.  Having said all of this - the bread is wonderful and everyone loves it!

After reading the reviews I used 3 cups strawberries (and could have used a bit more!) and used 1/2 cup veg oil and 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the 1-1/4 cup veg oil. I also used 2teaspoons cinnamon but would have preferred more cinnamon flavor so I will try it next with the full 1Tablespoon as written. Great bread and was done in about 50 minutes.

Really nice breakfast bread. I took the advice of others and added more strawberries (at least 3 cups +) and dusted the pan with confectioners sugar.  Eliminated the pecans and, by mistake used baking  powder.  It was wonderful and lots of compliments

Changed this up a little and loved it. Used 3 C. of strawberries and sprinkled a few on top before baking. Only used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and substituted applesauce for the oil. Omitted the pecans entirely. Would definitely make again.

I thought it was pretty tasty. I gave it 4 stars because there is not much strawberry taste, but it did taste good. It took about 65 minutes to bake.

I loved this recipe however, I did change it a bit.  I added about 1 cup extra of strawberries with about 3 tablespoons of strawberry yogurt and did a puree.  Then I cut back on some oil (about 3/4 of a cup) since there was extra "wet" in the batter.  I also cut back on the sugar (to about 1 cup) since there was a lot of sugar in the yogurt.    I did add about 1 tsp. of vanilla as well.  Over all it took about 1 hour to cook since the bread was more dense.  I also added a powder sugar glaze on the top so it was more of a dessert bread.  It looks delicious!

Decided to make this recipe after my little one requested strawberry bread. After telling her there was no such thing I came across this recipe! 

I am giving this 3 stars because my husband and little one said they liked it (but hubs said it was "dense" so he only at tiny pieces at a time) - also I had no issues with it rising appropriately. The downsides to this recipe were that (1) it tastes nothing like strawberries (2)and I, like many others, had to cook the heck out of it to get it done. Even after about 70 min it was still somewhat gooey in the middle but the edges were getting burnt. Mine did not come out light like "bread" but much thicker. 

Inspite of all of that it was not bad tasting just not what I was wanting.

making this now. I gave it an Ok* because of how much i actuelly have to alter the recipe. thats just in intense amount of sugar. I used Agave instead and often times when I make bread with enough fruit you really don't need any sugar at all. i also added some choc chips into the mix and more strawberries than asked for. and some less oil

Yum!  This is tasty.  I made it exactly as described.  My daughter described it as tasting like a snickerdoodle cookie with strawberries.  It had a nice, thin, crunchy outside with a moist inside.  My only regret is that I didn't have enough strawberries to make a second batch.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this morning, the kitchen smelled wonderful. I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers:  added about a cup more strawberries, used half oil and half applesauce, decreased the cinnamon a bit.  Made in a bundt pan.  This was a wonderful addition for brunch.  Thanks for sharing

This was excellent! Only change came from previous people. Use 2 cups pureed berries with 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c oil. Reduce rest of sugar to 1 cup and 2 cups sliced strawberries and you have a perfect bread!

I made this recipe as called for (24 servings) but I added an extra cup of strawberries, added 1 t of vanilla, decreased the cinnamon to 1T, and used 3 jumbo eggs instead of 4 regular eggs. I also poured the entire batter into a 10x5 glass loaf pan and baked at 325 instead of 350. Everything came out perfect other than I thought it was a bit too greasy. I would decrease the oil from 1.25 C to 1C maybe. I am making strawberry muffins now with the same altered recipe. Yum. They taste great frozen and thawed too!

So yummy!  Like many people I increase the strawberries from 2 to 4 cups-I mashed 3 cups with a pinch of sugar and then added another cup of sliced strawberries.  I also had some homemade applesauce so I substituted part of the oil with that, cut out the cinnamon (I already add some to the applesauce), and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  My family gobbled it up!

I made the recipe as written with fresh strawberries from my garden and 1 loaf was gone in a matter of about 60 minutes.  I was hesitant about the amount of oil but proceeded with the recipe as written.  The batter was a beautiful dark pink/purplish color.  I didn't have a problem with the bread rising or the baking time, as others mentioned.  I cut part of the loaf in small squares and took it with us to the zoo for snacks.  My family devoured the first loaf and the girls kept asking all day for "more strawberry cake!"  I do agree that the cinnamon was almost un-noticable but overall, great strawberry bread!  Next time, I would like to make into cupcakes and frost.

We really wanted to love this bread, but it was just  ok.  I followed the recipe as is (fresh strawberries), and added more strawberries based on the reviews.  The result was a bit mushy, and I did end up cooking it 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  We certainly preferred it warm, compared to the next day.  It may have been better as a dessert with ice cream, served right out of the oven.  I may try it again with another fruit...maybe apples.

This would have gotten a five if it called for more strawberries. I used 2 cups of sliced and 1 cup of mushed and I would definately use more next time I made it but it had a great flavor.

Was a good, moist bread. Very tasty. However -  I would definitely lessen the amount of cinnamon next time. It should be called Strawberry Cinnamon Bread! I added an entire pound of fresh strawberries and still couldn't really taste them. Was expecting more strawberry flavor.

I followed other recommendations in using double the strawberries (I mashed them), half the cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. I made muffins and came out with 15 (probably would have had a few more if we didn't love the batter so much...). The batter tasted wonderful, but the muffins were a little mushy. I think I will decrease the oil next time or add a bit more flour.

A really unique and good recipe. I only had one large loaf pan and 2 smaller ones, but the batter fit perfectly. I did 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 white and chopped the strawberries instead of slicing them. I didn't have pecans so used chopped almonds instead. It turned out really beautiful and delicious. A great gift in a mini loaf pan.

Excellent. I fed this to some very picky hunters for brunch; it was a complete success. I used a bundt pan as suggested and omitted two of the eggs and all of the oil because I used frozen (thawed overnight) strawberries and it was plenty moist. I only had about 1 1/4 cup strawberries so I used about 3/4 to 1 cup frozen zucchini that I had in the freezer. Excellent. I greased my pan heavily then floured it and it came out all in one beautiful piece. Sprinkle the top with large grains of sugar for extra special effect :)

I used about 3 cups of strawberries, sliced.  Also, I subbed the oil for 1 cup of applesauce.  Baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect!  So delicious, moist and sweet.

Excellent! Next time I use this recipe, I think I'll add a little less cinnamon and maybe more strawberries.   Stayed moist and was DELICIOUS warmed up with some vanilla ice cream and fresh blueberries on top... yum! Got tons of compliments.

This was my first time making bread, and despite my many mistakes, it turned out fantastic. I decided to go with three cups of strawberries and it was perfect. It had the perfect moisteness and was still good after a couple of days.

I made this according to recipe with no changes. I only rate it 3 stars because there is very little strawberry flavor to it and there is way too much oil in it. The bread literally leaves grease on your hands after touching it. I expect that from pepperoni pizza, not from bread. It had a good flavor but it was more cinnamon not strawberry. I will try it again with the tips from other reviewers... less oil, more berries.

I liked it! I adjusted a bit since other reviews said the strawberry flavor was lacking a bit. I added more strawberries so that I had a cup *after* they were sugared (sugaring compacts them), and added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to accent the flavor (an old trick from making apple pies when the apples are a little bland) plus some vanilla as recommended by another reviewer. I thought almonds would be nice (and they are cheaper than pecans) so I substituted 1/2c sliced almonds. Also threw in a tablespoon of flax meal and subbed half applesauce for the oil. Subbed 50-50 ginger and allspice for the cinnamon because my son is allergic. It ended up baking for about 65 minutes and still wasn't quite done so I left it in the oven after it was turned off to finish since it was still a little soft on top. It finished perfectly and tastes great! I only gave 4 stars because of the poor nutritional quality of the flour and sugar. Next time I'm going to add some wheat germ and use less sugar. Maybe some orange peel as well. A little Grand Marnier or almond extract would be good in this too.

I used almost 3 cups of strawberries and decreased the cinnamon by half.  I also used approx. 1 c. of applesauce in place of the oil and added about a half TBSP. of vanilla.  The bread turned out sweet enough for breakfast but not sweet enough to be dessert.

I loved this bread!! I did not know what to do with the strawberries I had that were past where people would eat them. I would have given it a 5 star but I used some suggestions from others... I 1/2ed the recipe to make only one loaf. I reduced the cinnamon to 1tsp (wanted 1.5), added vanilla, reduced sugar to 3/4(wanted 1 cup) and reduced oil to 1/3 (wanted 1/2). I also added 1.5cups (maybe a little more) strawberries and I cut and diced the strawberries. There was LOTS of strawberry flavour, bits of strawberry and it browned really nice. It was wonderful and I will be making it again

I just made this bread, and I must say it is the best. I turned it into muffins, and I  think i will have to make more because they seem to be disappearing already. VERY GOOD

Made mini-muffins, followed recipe exactly, just used mini tins, and baked for 17 minutes. Next time I will not fill baking cups too high, they expand more than my blueberry recipe- and will ADD Vanilla to add some more depth to the muffins. Very good, light breakfast on the go!

This recipe was really great.  I only made a couple of changes.  I threw in some blueberries because I needed to use them up and instead of the 1 1/4 cups of oil, I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of granny smith applesauce (I frequently use applesauce instead of oil in baking goods).  The cake was moist, delicious, and my family enjoyed it for breakfast during their recent visit.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The bread was flavorful, but we couldn't taste the strawberries. I'm tempted to use the ingredients as written, omit the strawberries and add shredded zucchini instead.

MmmmMmmmm.  I just made these tonight with the following changes: used 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 oil as well as 4 cups of diced strawberries.  I followed everything else as per the original recipes.  I made one loaf and a tray of muffins.  Simply delicious...will certainly make these again.

Sorry, I just didn't find this special. I even used 4 cups strawberries and toasted the pecans and added a glaze.  It wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

Flavor and texture were great.  I did double the strawberries as others had done and I omitted the cinnamon and used 1 tsp vanilla instead.  Also, omitted pecans (kids can't bring any food with nuts in it to school).  I think the pecans would have made it superb! Also, I had to bake longer though (about 55 min). This is a great to way use up excess strawberries!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used the tips from other cooks and lessened the oil to 3/4c, 1/2 tbsn cinnamon and used thicker slices of strawberries.  I don't recommend the thicker slices as I found that they settled somewhat and made a layer that kinda split the bread in half when I tried to remove it from the pan.  Diced strawberries would probably be the best way to go.  Even though my loaves were split with strawberries, this recipe is yummy!  Mix some cream cheese with marshmallow cream and you have a truly yummy spread to match this bread (on a more dessert level). =) So yummy!!!!

As the recipe stands....3 stars, but with the modifications that others listed, 4 stars. Decrease the cinnamon and increase the strawberries. Wonderful for my toddlers. They loved eating strawberries while they were being chopped.

We liked this well enough, just weren't "Wowed!" by it.  The strawberry flavor is very mild.  I would probably make again if I had an abundance of strawberries.

I made this, exactly as stated, and it came out beautifully. My family really enjoyed it. I still had some strawberries left, and Sunday Funday was over, so I modified it to make it a little healthier. I used:  1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon of all     purpose flour 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon of whole wheat flour 1 cup brown sugar plus 6 packets of Splenda 1 Tbs ground cinnamon 1 tsp salt 1 tsp baking soda 1 1/4 cups unsweetened cinnamon apple sauce 4 egg whites, beaten 1/2 c chopped walnuts I also sprinkled a little Splenda on the strawberries instead of sugar and my loaves took approximately 55 min. It wasn't quite as good as the original recipe, but I still really loved the taste (sans the guilt!)

This was deliciously different!  I used half whole wheat flour, decreased the oil and sugar by half and increased the strawberries by a 1/2 cup.  I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top before baking.  I would like to try making muffins next time!

This bread turned out great. Not too sweet, I can taste the strawberry, not too cake-like. I loved making it with my 3 year old son who just wanted to eat all of the strawberries. I used extra strawberries and nuts ( we love nuts! ) Next time I will use at least 2 cups puree strawberries to give it more flavor. If I had used the origional there would be very little strawberry taste! Definately use more strawberries than called for and otherwise its a good bread! (high altitude and no problems)

great recipe, my whole family loves it.  I didn't add the nuts, only because my kids go to a nut-free school.  I will make again, but cook time for me was just over an hour.  Maybe it's just my oven though.

Tastes Good!  I also put in far less cinn. as others recommended and reduced the oil to 3/4 a cup. I baked all in a bundt pan for 1 hr. Additionally I did a strawberry slurry made of 1.5 cups of cut strawberries and a cup of sugar, mashed up the berries and cooked for a bit. I then reduced the amount of sugar added to the flour to 1 c. I also added in a cup of cut up fresh strawberries added like blueberries, but it could have more.  Husband and son, LOVED it.  Great plain, or crumbled under ice cream or yogurt, or topped with whipped cream.  I will make this again.  I have a friend with a crepe cart that can use this for their left over strawberries.  I would also make these as muffins and top each muffin (before baking) with golden large crystal sugar, for a nice topping.  Perfect for sending to a kids teacher, as I ofen to with my baked goods. The teachers have loved that!

I made delicious, moist bread with this recipe.  Not too sweet but very tasty.  I left the pecans out, and the bread was done at the lower end of time (~45 minutes).  My boyfriend loved it, and eats it for breakfast and dessert!  I'll definitely make it again.

I cut the recipe in half because i didnt need two loaves.  I used about 1 1/2C strawberries and sprinkled them with splenda instead of regular sugar.  I also used part whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour for the entire recipe when i made this.  It wasnt as sweet as i'd like it, but stil good.  I did sprinkle on brown sugar towards the end of baking and that definitely helped sweeten it up!  When serving, i serve it warm with spray butter and whip cream...that definitely  makes this bread very tastey!!!!

Yum! There's only the two of us so I halved the recipe. Like some of the other reviewers I decreased the oil (1/2 cup for my little 1/2 batch) and used 1 1/2 cups of chopped strawberries. The 1/2 recipe made 6 gorgeous muffins and 1 mini loaf of bread. I took the mini loaf to a friend's for brunch and kept the muffins just for us!

I had some left over strawberries so decided to find another way to eat them fast. My family didn't care for this recipe. It was too sweet and just didn't have the flavor of a good fruit flavored bread. Just doesn't compare to a Banana or Zucchini bread. Thanks for sharing though!

Yum!  This got gobbled up  in my house.
Used about 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of the full amount.  Next I will also try substituting whole wheat for some of the white flour.

I did follow other reviewers suggestions and reduced sugar, added cinnamon and mashed half of strawberries. The bread had nice taste and walnuts complemented strawberries well. However it was not as moist as I like my bread to be. Nice way to use up strawberries.

Great Recipe!! I cut the recipe in half and made a dozen muffins.  As suggested by previous reviewers, I used WW flour, added vanilla, 1 cup more of strawberries (mushed), used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbsp of flax meal, 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup plain non fat yogurt....the muffins turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was a first try--and IMMEDIATELY devoured.  as suggested, i doubled the strawberries, blending some, and folding in the rest.  tastes great with some oatmeal flour substituted in for the plain flour.  (also used walnuts b/c i didn't have pecans)

I needed to cook it much longer, perhaps it was because i was using a stone loaf pan?  Anyway, i tried with the 1 T vanilla someone suggested, and that ruined it for me.  Then i made it without the vanilla, and it was super.  This really helped use up the strawberries we had.  Natch, it's good with strawberry cream cheese!

I made several batches of this to use up strawberries that we had picked.  It comes out so moist and sooooo yummy!  I gave away one loaf and kept getting requests from others.  I did not have any pecans on hand so I omitted them and the breads turned out just fine.  I did not change anything else.  I did have to bake for about 55 mins, but that could just be my oven.

Love this recipe. I halved the cinnamen, and added vanilla extract.  It was good by itself, but even better served warm like a strawberry shortcake.  Will make again for certain.

Yum !!!  Easy to make a delicious. Not too sweet and I was happy to find something I could use fresh strawberries in and then freeze. I followed another review suggestion for using an egg slicer for slicing the berries. Why didn't I think of that before !

This was such a hit at our bake sale. Almost sold every slice! I substituted 1/2 the all purpose flour for half whole wheat flour. It was so moist and had wonderful flavor. I have had many requests to bring this bread to upcoming events!

Wonderful! I halved the recipe to make one loaf.  The only changes I made were to add 1 Tbsp. vanilla and I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  This recipe makes me want to go strawberry picking again soon!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was okay. It was a nice change of pace from the typical loaf of banana bread, but I was kind of disappointed by it. I wish my oven wasn't so old and crappy, that may had made a difference in the outcome of this recipe. I'll definetely give this recipe another try, it has potential!

This was great.
I made a few healthful adjustments and it turned out awesome.
I used: 1 lb. of slightly mashed strawberries, one cup of splenda, and 1/2 a cup of light brown sugar. 1/4 cup of oil and 2 4oz jars of babyfood (prepared oatmeal). It was perfectly moist and definitely sweet enough.
Great recipe for using up extra or on-sale strawberries.

Fabulous!  I altered a little bit by cutting cinnamon in half, adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla, cutting nuts to ~1/2 c. and adding ~3/4 cup coconut.  I think next time I'll add some lemon zest...it needed more fruitiness.

After picking strawberries at the strawberry patch, we were excited to make this bread.  The bread came out just fine - except it didn't taste like strawberries...even after doubling the amount of berries.  I was very disappointed - BUT the bread tasted great...Just not like strawberries.

This was pretty good, but too sweet for my taste.  I halved the recipe, didn't add nuts because my boyfriend is allergic.  I cut out an extra 1/2 c sugar because I was using applesauce instead of oil.  Tasty, but a bit too processed-tasting.  I'll hold on to this recipe, but will continue to try tweaking it.

I made this with high altitude adjustments (9,000 feet) and with gluten free flour, and it came out great. I made 1/2 recipe with 1 1/2 cups strawberries, and added 1 t vanilla extract and 1/2 t almond extract. It's delicious.

I thought this tasted great!  My husband really liked it too!  I even forgot to put the oil in and it still tasted great!  I did what some others did and added 1 tbsp vanilla extract.  I will make this a lot!

This was great, I only used half the oil, and used mashed strawberries for sub.

This is a keeper, next time I will add more strawberries, I didnot have that extra cup to put in.  I also baked it in a bunt pan and put a sugar glaze on top.  This is great........

Pretty good.  I will make a couple of changes next time.  Add 50% more strawberries and use pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinnamon.  Will bump that up 50% too.  Otherwise, mine looked just like the pic.  My kids love it.

Great tasting bread.  But the most stiff dough I've come across and I thought I was right on with the directions.  Further, the bread crumbles badly.  I need to freeze one loaf and I fear that when I take it out of the freezer it will be nothing but crumbs. 

Fantastic flavor, though!

This was good - like the texture of banana bread, but with strawberries.  The only thing I didn't like was that the strawberries were very mushy in the bread.  I probably wouldn't make this again as there are many better bread recipes out there.

Great way to use extra strawberries! I substituted 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt for both 1/4 c of the sugar and 1/2 c of the oil; it still came out sweet and moist. I used walnuts instead of pecans as previous users suggested, and I added choc chips to one of the loaves...yum!

This was a tasty way to use up strawberries. I substituted applesauce for half the oil, like the others had suggested. I also let the berries soak in milk in sugar before adding to mixture. My batch made FOUR mini loaves.

Another so-good-you-want-to-slap-your-mama recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers to add more strawberries, and it was scrumptious! It's strawberry season in Louisiana, and this was a great way to use them. I did sub 3/4 cup of applesauce for that much oil, and increased the berries to almost 3 cups. Too much of a good thing is a good thing. I made five mini loaves and passed them out to lucky friends and co-workers. Thanks!

I followed the advise of others and doubled the amount of strawberries.  I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 3/4 cup low fat sour cream.  I also baked it in a bundt pan greased and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar as others have suggested.  It was lovely and moist but the flavour of strawberries is very subtle. I would  make it again if I had over ripe strawberries to use up.

This recipe is good, but could use a little tweaking.  I should have followed the advice of other reviewers - it's a little too sweet and needs more berries.  But, I'm snacking on it hot from the oven, and it's still pretty tasty.

Wonderful bread! I had some strawberries that were over-ripe and put in 3 cups and less oil like other reviewers suggested. It was delicious, will definately make again.
