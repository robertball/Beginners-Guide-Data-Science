I suggest adding 4 large tomatoes instead of 1 and halving the tamarind. If you don't mind the extra calories, a cup of coconut milk adds a delicious richness (don't use regular milk!). If using potatoes, prick them raw, dice into bite size pieces and cook them in the tamarind (or tomato) juice. Okra is GREAT in this recipe.

Better pre-soak the peas. They'll never get soft in just 15 minutes cooking (w/o pressure). Seasoning is a good combination.

1/2 cup tamarind is too much, must be a typo.  Cut the tamarind at least in half depending on taste.  other than that good.

Very disappointed in this. I have had sambar many times over the years at various Indian restaurants, and this recipe was way off the mark. 
The tamarind was too strong, and gave the dish a strong, tangy flavor that was disagreeable.  
And the yellow lentils, while edible, were way too firm---and I even soaked them for a couple of hours first, and also cooked them 3X as long as the recipe called for. 
I could see maybe using an immersion blender on the lentils to puree them after they've been cooked. 
And in my experience, sambar is supposed to have slices of carrot, which this recipe did not have.  
I now have a pot of soup that I am not at all enthusiastic about finishing eating, and will probably toss out.

It was great, I was cooking for someone with a coconut allergy so I had to leave out the coconut, and the yellow split peas took a lot longer to cook with a lot more water, but it came out tasting very good.

I'm getting ready to make this -- I bought tamarind concentrate - how much should I use for this recipe? 

Thank you.

I did not make this yet, but am wondering .... why is the photo that accompanies this dish actually a shot of what appears to be banana or zucchini bread, not the biryani. I suggest you change the photo so that people won't pass by the recipe simply because they are not trying to make bread.
