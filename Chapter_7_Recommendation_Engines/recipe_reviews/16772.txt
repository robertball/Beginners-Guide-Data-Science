Giving it three stars as it was a good base to work from but all the butter and can soup turned me off.  My changes: Cooked one cup rice in chicken broth, made my own cream sauce (2tbl butter, 2tbl flour, one cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup half & half, 8 oz cheese, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder).  Made 3/4 cup breadcrumbs from homemade italian croutons and skipped the butter and skipped greasing the pan.  It was wonderful.

We have really enjoyed this recipe. My husband is a picky eater so that says a lot. I used white rice as the only yellow rice I could find had spices in it which my taste buds tend to be sensitive to certain ones. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and will probably cut back on them next time as the topping was fairly salty. This is a definite keeper! Haven't tried it on any kids yet.

Overall we really enjoyed this recipe. I did season the chichen when I was cooking it and added melted garlic butter to the broccoli before essembling the casserole. Also I will use less bread crumbs next time.

Good taste. Could be easier in preparation by mixing everything except the bread crumbs and butter together and putting it in the pan. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top and dot with pieces of butter. Butter will melt as casserole bakes.

This is my husband's favorite thing for me to make he has renamed it "Chicken Erika." He loves simple dishes like this rice chicken broccoli etc and especially the breadcrumbs. Me I like things to be "kicked up" a little more but if he'll eat non-processed foods this way then I'm happy to do it. I do use "healthier" canned soup mixes for this and sometimes use low-fat crushed ritz instead of the breadcrumbs. Not sure that it helps with the fat/sodium content all that much but whatever. A good homecooked meal can't be all bad. He loves it!

Made this for grandson's 1st birthday party and everyone raved! Made a few changes recommended by others. Seasoned the chicken while I cooked it with poultry seasoning and lemon pepper. Used only 3 cans of soup (broccoli and cheese and cream of chicken). Mixed everything together (inc. cheese) before I put bread crumbs on top (only 3 cups). Easy simple and very tasty. Thanks for the recipe. It was great!!

Absolutely wonderful!! Our daughter fixed this for us the other evening and everyone just loved it! She did not have any bread crumbs on hand so substituted seasoned croutons sprinkled over the top. It was GREAT!!! We were all wanting the leftovers.....of which there were NONE!!!

I used leftover jasmine rice instead of yellow substituted a can of cheddar soup in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken and omitted the bread crumb topping. The casserole wasn't terribly exciting but a good solid meal with plenty of leftovers for my husband and me and it should reheat well. This dish is a great way to use up leftover rice and/or chicken. Or if you left out the chicken and added a second bag of broccoli it would make a nice side dish. I will make this again but not all the time.

My sister sent me this recipe after she tried it and really like it and it's become one of my favorite casseroles. I've tried lots of different variations - frozen peas frozen squash/zucchini or frozen green beans instead of the frozen broccoli; canned chicken or leftover grilled chicken for the cubed chicken; and different types of cracker crumbs instead of the buttered bread crumbs. I like using leftover grilled chicken because it gives the whole casserole more flavor than using plain cooked chicken. Also I have found that using crushed Ritz crackers (reduced fat) instead of the buttered bread crumbs tastes just as good and cuts out the butter in the recipe. I usually keep all the ingredients for this great casserole on hand and can put it together fairly quickly and pop it in the oven. It also freezes really well and the leftovers are fantastic! Thanks Kathleen for this great recipe!

We thought this casserole was bland and dry. The breadcrumbs overwhelmed the rest of the dish. You could probably make some adjustments but I'd rather just use a recipe I like.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe this is comfort food at its best. The only changes I make are using Ritz crackers and seasoning the chicken as it cooks. I'm thinking of omitting the chicken and taking it as a side dish to my in-law's this Thanksgiving. Oh and the leftovers are the best cold. Yum yum yum.

I had high hopes for this dish as my husband is big on comfort foods...he thought it was o.k. My son ate it my daughter asked me to never prepare this again. As for me I thought it was fair-to-good. Not a rave review I know but it was definitely worth a try.

To cut time in half we purchased the ready to cook chicken from Tyson. We only used one cup of breadcrumbs and it was still too salty.

I prepared just as you said to and it was delicious. The 5 year old was even impressed! Lots of color! I would like to know if anyone has tried it with a can of cream of cheddar substituted for one of the cream of chicken? I may try that next.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. We wanted to try something different and it was very last minute. I made a few changes for one I used red peppers when the chicken was cooking. I also used one can of soup. This is very easy to make but takes a lot of time to prepare so better start this early.

This was very good; I changed it quite a bit though. I used leftover chicken & rice (to cut down on prep time) and completely cut out the butter & bread crumbs in order to cut down on the salt & calories. It was still delicious.

My husband and I go back to this recipe over and over again and we love it every time! We switch it up by adding whichever steamed veggies sound good to us that day. Only steam them about halfway since the vegetables will finish cooking in the oven. We also use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken soup as suggested by an earlier poster. We get the low sodium/low fat kind of soups so we feel a little better about all the cheese we add to the top!

This tasted pretty good. I did change a couple of things like omitting the butter using chicken flavoured rice rather than yellow rice and adding more broccoli. Something doesn't quite taste right not that this tastes bad but can't think of what I could change to make this a 5 star recipe.

This recipe was not "quick and easy" as I anticipated. Everything needed to be cooked prior to mixing and then needed to bake an additional hour! To top it off the whole thing tasted like nothing more than bread crumbs. Sorry Kathleen.

Great comfort food for a chilly night! My only concerns were the saltiness probably from the soup and all of the prep. By the time I cooked the rice and chicken mixed the soup and milk together melted the butter and mixed w/ breadcrumbs believe me I had a sink full of dishes! No big deal but if you're looking for a quick easy one-dish meal this isn't it.

Pretty good! I changed it quite a bit--diced and fried the chicken with salt and pepper before adding it; had no broccoli so I added mixed carrots and peas to the rice instead. Broccoli would have been better or for the picky kids no veggies at all.

Gave it 4 stars because this was a great starting point for me. I have gestational diabetes so I really have to watch my carbs hence all the changes in the recipe. But the finished product was amazing.... Used 1/2 C. minute rice instead. Cooked 1 chicken breast and steamed 1 head broccoli. Mixed chicken broccoli rice 1 can cream of broccoli soup and 1/2 C. milk together and poured in sprayed baking dish. Sprinkled 1/2 C. cheddar over top then 1 TB melted butter and a little less than 1/2 C Italian breadcrumbs. Only cooked for 20 minutes (uncovered).

My rice turned out crunchy around the edges! Next time I will mix it together and put it in the pan before putting cheese and breadcrumbs on top. I only had white rice on hand but I bet yellow rice makes it even better. It does need more seasoning maybe just pepper and onion or garlic. Will try again but will make some changes.

Pretty darn good; although I made a few changes. I had leftover chicken from a roaster that I shredded up - great way to use your leftovers! I also subbed cream of mushroom as my soup simply because we prefer the taste. I added some garlic in as well. Everybody likes the comfort foods around my house so went over well. Also I loved that my leftovers got used up. Thanks!
