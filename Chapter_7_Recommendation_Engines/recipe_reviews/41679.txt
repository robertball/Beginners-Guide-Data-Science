This was GREAT! Made it for our Mother's Day get together.  I never use shortening  and always sub it with sour cream, I also used a whole can of whole cranberry sauce. I also made one loaf with nuts, the other without. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I will make this again!

EXCELLENT base recipe.
Thanks for the start!

bananas and cranberries -- what an awesome combination!  The result is a kind of "spice bread."  I think that the nutmeg is key!!

Here's my healthier version.
Note: bananas -- Using VERY RIPE ones, and more of them, gives the moisture AND sweetness.  

Banana Cranberry Bread

2 1/2 c. sugar --> reduce to 3/4 c. sugar 
1 c. shortening -- eliminate this entirely
3 eggs 
3 mashed bananas --> increase to 10 VERY RIPE (brown) mashed bananas
1 c. cranberry sauce --> substitute 1 bag = 12 oz. whole cranberries instead
1 orange, peeled and mashed -- ADD this
1/2 cup milk 
1 t. vanilla extract 
4 c. all-purpose flour --> substitute 3 c. self-rising flour
1 1/2 t. baking soda 
1 1/2 t. baking powder 
1 t. ground cinnamon 
1/2 t. ground nutmeg --> increase to 1 t. ground nutmeg
1/2 c. chopped walnuts 

2 loaf pans (9x5") --> 3 loaf pans
350 for 50--60 m --> 40 m (less cooking time means more moistness)

I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce, no shortening, 3 T of dry milk powder (in place of liquid milk), and only 1 cup of sugar.  It is now my family's favorite banana bread recipe, even beating out the cocoa chocolate chip banana bread.

Absolutely delicious.  I was looking for a recipe for moist Cranberry-Orange bread.  This was it. The first time I make a new recipe I try to make the original recipe but this time after reading the reviews I used 1 cup of chopped fresh cranberries instead of the sauce and I used the zest of one orange.  This recipe made 6 mini loaves.  I used a toothpick to make sure it was done. This will go into my Hall of Fame.

This is a great recipe!  I always have mashed ripe bananas in my freezer and often cranberries so it's a dandy.  I, too, might add a handful of whole cranberries to my next batch and would perhaps add a few more walnuts.  For extra flavour, I toasted the walnuts lightly in a non-stick pan first - no oil, just medium heat and remove before they burn! Lesley, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

I used my leftover candied sweet potatoes instead of banana and WOW. Very moist, very delicious and very happy to use my leftovers in such a creative way.

My husband (who hates cranberries!), loved this recipe. I used homemade cranberry sauce (recipe on this site, Cranberry Sauce I submitted by Toni) and while the actual cranberry sauce was excellent, I have to agree with other reviewers that there didn't seem to be enough cranberries. Should consider adding some whole cranberries next time. I substituted margarine for the shortening and made them into muffins instead of loaves. Worked out well.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I made it into muffins and it worked well, I just didn't find them particularly flavorful.  Adding some dried or fresh cranberries might add some needed zing.

I cut the recipe in half to make just one loaf (but kept the 3 bananas (very ripe) and 1 cup cranberry sauce).  I also made some changes to make it healthier.  I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted apple sauce for the shortening.  It turned out moist and delicious.

This recipe was very good. The only thing I substituted was using 25% less flour and butter instead of shortening. I will surely make this again. This tops the list for cranberry bread recipes.

This is really good! I used jellied cranberry sauce but added in some dried cranberries and it was awesome. Will make for the holidays for gifts in mini tins. Thanks a bunch!

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes: 1 cup of sugar only, used nonfat yogurt in place of shortening, used 4 bananas, used 100% white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, used fat free milk.  Came out perfectly moist, the kids raved about it.  Will definitely be making this again!

These are quite delicious. I didn't have 3 bananas so I I just used 2. still has plenty of banana flavor. I also made them into muffins where the cook time was about 25 minutes. It made 18 muffins. Very good recipe.

I had a 303 can of cranberry sauce I needed to use and used this recipe with very good results.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (more like bread than cake), 1/2 cup shortening was enough to cream the fat, sugar and eggs with plenty of volume, and I used water instead of milk and stirred into the sauce.  The extra 3/4 cup or so of cranberry sauce in the can gave extra needed moisture.  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt to help bring out the flavors (probably not necessary if using salted butter as someone suggested).  I omitted the vanilla since vanilla tends to mask the banana flavor in banana bread.  It was somewhat crumbly when still warm but sliced very nicely when completely cooled, which is typical of using shortening I think.  Also, next time I am adding 1 teaspoon of dried orange peel.  I always add this to regular banana bread with good results and it is always a good combination with cranberries.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I mostly followed the recipe.  I had little bits of stuff to use up, so I got a little creative.  I didn't have a full cup of cranberry sauce, but I did have an aging mango, so incorporated that into the recipe.  Between cranberry sauce and mango, I had about 1 1/2 cups of "liquid", so I left out the milk.  I had 1/8 cup of brown sugar hanging around, so I added white sugar to make 2 cups total, and the recipe was still sweet enough.  I didn't have any shortening, so I used 1-1/3 sticks of butter and 3/4 c of oil and beat those in with the sugar til it was light and fluffy.  I put orange extract to up the "tang" factor after reading other reviews.  I baked 1/2 of the batter into a loaf and 1/2 into muffins.  Came out great!  I would definitely make again and want to try with more cranberry sauce and chopped cranberries.  Surely a keeper!

My son chose this recipe to make and of course I supervised since he is only 10.  I found the bread a little dry don't know if it's because we used whole cranberry sauce?!  My son loves it...We also put in a few dried cranberries since we all love cranberries.  If we make it again, I'll add another very ripe banana and frozen cranberries to help with moisture issue. The nutmeg was quite strong and took over some of the banana and cranberry taste.  Overall, it's really good and my son is gonna take a loaf to share at his sleepover tonight.

Great recipe and I loved that I didn't have to just throw out the cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving that wasn't eatten.  I did use the suggestions from someone else to substitute sour cream for the shortening and used pecans instead of walnuts.   Very good!

Excellent.  I used 1/2 cup margarine instead of shortening, and the whole can of whole cranberry sauce.  I agree with the other reviewers that more berries are needed, and next time I will probably reduce the sugar to 2 cups as well.

This is very good bread, but it's a little too sweet for my tastes. I halved the recipe to make just one loaf and it turned out very well. I chopped up some frozen cranberries and added those to the batter. I did forget to add the nuts (oops). Thank you! :)

Not enough cranberries, I should have read the reviews.  I substituted butter for the oil and turned out excellent but took a little longer to cook the top center of the loaf. So perhaps I don't have the conversion right but it tastes better then using the oil.

This was very good! I did not use 2 1/2 cups of sugar because it just seemed like too much. I only used one cup and it seemed sweet to me. I totally forgot the nuts too until my husband said "This would be 5 stars if it had nuts in it!" Go figure! I will make this again :)

My first batch did not come out very well, but after I altered the cranberry sauce component to include equal parts of jelly and whole cranberries (as opposed to the first batch where I purposely picked out the whole berries only), doubled the amount of cinammon and watched my baking time more closely (remember, the 50-60 minutes cooking time is for 9x5 loaves, and I was making smaller ones) it came out pretty good.  I personally did not like it, but my husband and a lot of family liked it and even asked for the recipe.

this bread was AMAZING. i replaced the shortening with butter and repaced the milk with cream, also added no walnuts. the batter was almost better than the bread! in my opinion, you could use a little more cranberry sauce but overall, it was outstanding!

This turned out quite nicely. I really liked the combination of the cranberry sauce and bananas. However, I think next time I'll use whole cranberries in addition to the cranberry sauce just to give it a little more texture. Very good recipe.

After making only half the recipe for Tyler Florence's cranberry sauce on Food Network's website, we had tons left over.  Looking to use up the leftovers, I found this recipe.  Have to say, while I'm a pretty good cook - I've never tried baking before. The bread came out perfectly moist, tangy and yummy!  Delish!

Oh so good! I only had 1-1/2 bananas, so I halved the recipe. Because there was plenty of juice in my whole cranberry sauce, I didn't add the milk. Used butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup each of brown sugar & white sugar--it was plenty sweet. Next time (and when they're in season!) I'll use whole cranberries. The taste & texture is moist and tender like regular banana bread, and the cranberry flavor is not pronounced, but it adds a definite flavor boost!

Yummy!  My kids really like this as muffins.  I made 1 large loaf and 24 muffins.  I used Blue Cranberry sauce (not really blue, has blueberries)found on this site.  I was out of vanilla so I used lemon extract.  It was very simple and a great way for the kids to get in some extra fruit and fiber without them knowing.  Thank you!

WOW!! I Love It!! I Have Found the recipe where I can use my leftover homemade cranberry sauce every year.  What a wonderful tasting bread!! Great for the winter!! I love that it makes two loves! My daughter took one to a cast party and they gobbled it up! The other loaf was a great after school snack, warmed up w/ a tab of butter and hot chocolate. My kids are still asking for more! Sorry Grandma, but I have found a new banana bread recipe.

I, too, was looking for a way to use up leftover cranberry sauce (and some extra-ripe bananas).  I was a little nervous about this recipe at first, as I had homemade cranberry sauce on hand and I didn't know if it would work.  IT DID!!!  This recipe is excellent!!!  I only have one loaf pan, so I was able to make one loaf of bread and 24 (reg-sized) muffins.  I baked the muffins for about 15 - 17 minutes (they were done at 15, but I wanted them to brown a bit more, so I left them in for another 2 minutes).  I followed the instructions as noted in the recipe for baking the bread.  They smell delicious and tasted even better!   THANK YOU for this "keeper"!!!  Will definitely be making it again!!!

I changed the recipe by using 1 C sugar, 1 stick of butter, 5 ripe bananas - what I had on hand,  1 t nutmeg, and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also added 1/4 C of crasins, which I had on hand, and made muffins instead of loaves.  The recipe makes 36 muffins baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes until golden brown, maybe a bit longer would be better - watch for doneness. After cooling, I wrapped each muffin in plastic wrap and gave them to neighbors as a Christmas gift. Recipe was a success.

I made the cranberry sauce in this recipe from scratch (http://christmas.allrecipes.com/az/CranberrySauce.asp) and even though the sauce was very tasty, I couldn't taste any trace of cranberries in this bread. I do believe the cranberry sauce makes it more moist, though, as it was VERY moist!  I made 4 mini loaves and 1 regular loaf in stone pans, and I may bake at 325 next time; the "crust" was sort of hard. also, I put 1 cup walnuts instead of 1/4 cup, and I could have stood more!! Enjoy!!

The flavors of cranberry and banana didn't work together as well as I expected -- it felt strange to be eating sweet banana bread and suddenly hit a pocket of tart cranberry. I didn't include the walnuts -- maybe the flavors work better together when nuts are included too.

Good!  Very good-  much better than plain banana bread.  Everyone liked it.  I used canned whole cranberry sauce but made sure to add it last and give it only a few mixes so the whole bread wouldn't turn pink.

Only changes I made was use half butter/half margerine and omit the walnuts. (I didn't have any.)

This worked out perfectly for me. Took a bit longer to bake and I had to place a piece of foil over the loaves to keep them from burning, but that really wasn't an issue for me. The loaves were really fluffy, but I think that's because I took the time to beat the fats in with the sugars before adding the other liquid ingredients. I also alternated the milk in with the dry ingredients when adding them in. 

I made these for Dustin's pool league members. I'll update again when I know how they liked it.

EDITED 08/18/08: This was a hit. Will make again.

Used butter instead of shortening, added more walnuts and cranberries. Otherwise made according to recipe. I made this recipe and a chocolate chip banana bread recipe, thinking my husband would like that more. He actually liked this one better. Very moist and declicious.

I wanted to do just one loaf so I changed the recipe as follows: 1 cup sugar, ½ cup margarine, 1 egg, 2 large bananas, 1 cup cranberry sauce, NO milk, about 1½ TBS orange juice (half of an orange), 1 tsp vanilla, 2 cups flour, just under a tsp of both baking soda and powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon (got allergies in the house), a couple good shakes of nutmeg, and around ½ cup walnuts. The batter was pink when I put it in the oven, and it came out sort of a purpley-tinged baked loaf color. That's fine, I KNOW there's cranberries in it! If it offends people, they don't have to eat it... Oh, and it took closer to 75 minutes to bake. I increased the temperature to between 350 and 375 after an hour and, luckily, the top didn't overbrown. If it does seem to be browning too quickly, try covering it with foil. A great way to use up cranberries and yet the bananas took away some of the over-tart flavor. Thanks, Linda!

I couldn't believe the response I got from this recipe.  People raved over its moistness and that it wasn't too sweet.  I baked it in a 13x9x2 pyrex pan, and just slices the pieces in small sample sizes.  A great way to use up those bananas.

I was not very impressed with this recipe.  I used hm cranberry sauce plus added some fresh cranberries as others suggested and still it really had no flavor of cranberries and only a hint of banana flavor.  It did make a moist bread but mine fell in the middle-not sure what was up with that. I  might make this again next thanksgiving when I have leftovers to use up but wouldn't bother if I didn't already have the cranberries.

Yum! Excellent bread and very simple to make. I used fresh cranberry sauce this time, but would even consider using some whole cranberries in the next batch. Definately will make this again!

This bread is amazing. It is moist and the cranberry gives it a nice tart pop of flavor. I used whole fresh cranberries instead of cranberry sauce.

Couldn't taste the cranberries, so it was really a banana bread.  Baked well as muffins, but in loaf pan, the center was not done.

This is really good.  For the cranberry sauce I used the Cranberry Gelatin Salad by Sharon Wolfe that is on this site.  Other than that followed directions.  I didn't have any 9x5 inch loaf pans, but did have 9x3 and it made 3 perfect loafs.  Thanks.

This was a nice change from traditional banana bread, although i didn't even taste that much banana in this one. if you get a banana bread craving, this might not quite satisfy it, but i definitely would try this again

I made this bread for Thanksgiving company and they raved about it, although I personally would lighten up on the nutmeg and cinnamon -- I thought the spices were a bit overpowering and got in the way of the banana flavor.  Next time I think I will skip those spices and simply use vanilla extract.  I used homemade cranberry sauce (cranberries, OJ and sugar), which worked well, and doubled the nuts.  The bread was very moist.  My mother made me promise to make this recipe again for Christmas, so I suspect it is going to become a tradition for us.  Thanks, Linda!

VERY yummy, but no cran taste, as other reviewers mentioned.  I thought I'd get cute and make 1/2 a batch of bread, since I only had 1/2 cup of cranberry jelly leftovers (btw, how do you "halve" an egg?  heehee, I did my best!).  I also tried to cook it in a cake pan instead of a loaf pan to cut down on cooking time - what a disaster!  The center was still mush, and the top was getting pretty crusty.  My husband and I chowed down on the cooked parts, though.  Excellent flavour!  I will follow the recipe next time, and add some craisins or something to get that "cran" flavour.

WONDERFUL BREAD! Great use of leftover cranberry sauce. I used my homemade cranberry sauce along with some of the jellied canned stuff. It is so moist and delicious. My husband who doesn't like cranberry anything loved it! Will make again!!!

Awesome recipe!! I had about an extra quarter cup of Cranberry sauce than the recipe called for and I added the little juice with it so I left out the milk(I used both kinds of Cranberry sauce and just cubed the jellied into cranberry sized squares--and I added them dead last and barely mixed them in)Also, I had small bananas so I used 4 instead of 3.  It was tasty, light for a bread, moist and delicious-almost like cake. I might add a small amount of salt (1/4 tsp)the next time I make this but it was terrific-banana bread with some pazzaz.  It made 1 5x7 and 2 4x7 loaves and they are all gone!!!

Great recipe! Used a can of sauce with whole cranberries in it instead. But I did like cream cheese instead of the shortening, then a sprinkling of brown sugar and connamon mix across the top halfway through cooking to add a sweet crunch to the top. Awesome!

This recipe is delicious. It makes much more than regular banana bread recipes do. I split mine up into two cake pans because I ran out of baking loaves (baked about 40 minutes) I made my own cranberry sauce to cut down on the sugar. 
This recipe is super moist and perfect for sharing with lots of friends.

I've made several kinds of alterations to banana bread, but this was by far the husband's favorite recipe.  I can't seem to figure out  why this recent batch sunk, I know I had the right amount of leavening.

Very nice bread.  If you are expecting a cranberry type bread, though, this isn't it.  It's more of a sweet banana bread--even with frozen cranberries, like I used.  I added more the second time I made this to have a bit more of a cranberry flavor.  A great way to use up bananas and cranberries, though.  This recipe makes a lot--I have smaller breadpans and this yielded two loaves and twelve muffins.  Thank you for the recipe!

Bland. Fresh cranberries might be better. Too crunchy on the outside and crumbly on the inside.  Took much longer to cook than recipe suggests.  I would not use this recipe again.

Shortening is blasphemy, so I use butter or lard instead. Next time I would swap one of the bananas for another cup of cranberry sauce; my sauce is really zesty, and I could still barely taste it in this recipe. I'm thinking that could turn this into a 5-star experience. Maybe more spice, too. It just tasted like a standard banana bread, to me.

Really liked this recipe although I made muffins instead of bread.  Made about 36, cooked at 350 for 26 minutes.  The only thing I would do next time is lower the sugar amount a bit, but that's personal preference.

It turned out pretty good. I made one full sized loaf and 3 mini loaves.  The full sized loaf had to bake 10 minutes longer than the recipe says for me. Be sure to do the toothpick test! It could use a little more flavor. I think I’ll add some orange zest next time. Family liked it as is...

The first time it burned with at least 15 minutes cooking time.  We did eat the inside and it was really good.  The second time we cooked it even less time.  The outside was gorgeous, but the inside was raw (toothpick came out clean) and fell.  Won't make this again!

I made this & it is delicious! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk because my Banana Bread recipe calls for buttermilk & it adds moistness. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I used left over cranberries I had made with orange peel. It added a nice orange flavor to the bread. I also drizzled a glaze over it to dress up the look. It is moist, delicious & will be a favorite for sure!

Since I only had one 9.5 size pan I then used my mini individual loaf pans which I was able to make 4 to complete my batter. Very nice recipe it looks and smells good. Thank you for posting this recipe. Keep on posting good delicious recipes.

I made this receipt twice. The first time it just tasted like banana bread and you didn’t see any cranberries. It was still delicious. Then I made it with 2 bananas and more cranberry sauce. Still no visual cranberry. It doesn’t look like the picture above but does taste very good. I’m want it  to look like the picture. I’m going to try again using just 1 banana and hopefully you’ll see the berries.

Used 1 cup of sour cream in place of shortening, a whole can of whole berry cranberry sauce and dried cranberries in place of nuts.  It is a huge hit with the fam!

This was the first time we edited our standard banana bread to add leftover cranberry sauce and it was a hit. We did substitute butter for the shortening, because I cannot justify putting that much lard in anything I eat. Also we forgot the cinnamon but it was still excellent without. I think the cranberry sauce adds a lot of moisture.

I made this delicious recipe and it was a hit!!! I did, however, make a spread to go with it. I saw it on Allrecipes as well. It was 1/2 cup softened butter, 4 ounces of cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of honey and 1/2 a cup of whole cranberry sauce. I also made a drizzle of powdered sugar and milk and drizzled it over the loaf cakes. Yummy!!!! I’ll certainly make it again!!

The banana bread I made was different....used recipe originally got from Taste of Home. 
I put freash cranberries in food processor  along with 2 whole oranges, Honey Crisp apple & pecans. Had some left over as well as there were two very ripe bananas laying on my counter. 
So I made a variation of banana cranberry bread. It is good but the orange comes through and bananas not so much.

For this recipe, I did substitute  cream cheese for the shortening.  It was a little on the heavy side  but very tasty.  I also used 1 cup of whole cranberry sauce.  Next time I will use the whole can.  After a few days, the bread very moist and more flavorful.

I made this recipe as written and the results were delicious!  I might use more cranberry next time (whole) but otherwise wouldn't change a thing!  I love that it makes 2 loaves.  The cranberry sauce adds a delightful taste to ordinary banana bread special for the holidays!

This turned out nicely, it was very tasty and we liked it.  I used half butter flavor crisco and half butter. Both my hubby and I thought we preferred either banana or cranberry bread, not the mixture of the two.  But that is our personal preference.  If I made it again I would add craisins.

Next time I'll add some Craisins along with the cranberry sauce to sweeten it up just a bit more, otherwise it was terrific.  Would rate it a 4 1/2 stars.

I made this recipe the other day and used butter instead shortening, only 1 cup sugar, and I made muffins instead of loaves.  They turned out very well after 20 minutes at 350 degrees and made 2 dozen plus 4 extra.  Really liked the combination of banana and cranberry but would consider using some chopped whole cranberries for a more intense flavor.  Will definitely make these again.

Great recipe as is however as most cooks do I tweaked it.  I used Splenda for baking and cut it down to 1 and 3/4 c. , light sour cream in place of shortening, cut the white flour to 3 c. and added 1 cup pumpernickel meal.  Added the zest and juice of one orange, omitted the milk entirely.  I used homemade cranberry sauce and folded it in as the last step so that I did not have pink batter.  I happened to have pecans on hand so used them instead of the walnuts.  I also cut the baking time down to 50 minutes and may cut it a couple more minutes the next time.  All other ingredients  stayed the same.   it was a  not too sweet delicious comfort bread and served with a lovely cup of tea made my day.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that is a keeper in my book as it can be tweaked so many ways.  I am thinking blueberries.

Only used one and one third cups of sugar (brown) and only 3 cups of bread flour. Also only two thirds of the cranberry sauce, no milk. Turned out wonderful at 350 degrees in a convection oven for 70 min.Thanks !!

I was disappointed.  I love banana bread and I love cranberry sauce so I was excited to try this, plus I had 5 really, really ripe bananas.  I made it per the instructions, even included all of the 2 1/2 cups of sugar....and found it to be really bland.  Nothing exciting about it.  If I make it again, it'll be tweaked a lot, but I'm not even sure how to tweak it.  Easy enough recipe to follow, but not for me.

This turned out better than I thought it would.   Subbed sour cream for shortening.  Used the cup of homemade cranberry sauce in the batter but at the very end, I swirled about 1/3 cup more into it, to give a little extra cranberry kick.  
Had leftover batter, so I also made mini muffins and added mini chocolate chips - this was a great addition.

I substituted sour cream for the shortening and used 1 1/2 cups of Splenda for baking.  I also added 2 tbsp. of banana liquor to the wet mixture. I also substituted white whole wheat flour for the AP flour.  Great snack for a diabetic.  Bread was moist and flavorful

I’m not a big baker but this came out nice and moist enough and I can really taste the banana flavour with the taste of little bits of  the sweet and tart tasting  cranberry ...
My sister actually asked me for the recipe exactly like I made it ... and added encouragement for me to try more baking

I can't believe that you put in 2 1/2 cups of sugar!! Why?? I would never, I put 1 cup, that was enough. Otherwise, it was ok.

I only had a can of jellied cranberry sauce, but I added about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. SO glad I did! The only cranberry taste came from the dried ones (I'd use a whole cup next time), but the canned sauce did keep it nice & moist. This was my first time making banana bread & it was perfectly delicious! Thanks for a great recipe. I highly recommend!!

I made a few changes, I added an extra banana and I used a little canola oil instead of shortening.  I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! I added approximately 1/4 cup extra cranberry sauce. Cooked this in my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker! Worked perfectly! Very moist!

I substituted Splenda for sugar and oat flour for white flour.  It was pleasantly sweet. Seemed moist also.

This is the best banana type bread I have ever made. Kudos to you! Thanks for posting it. The cranberry put a good amount of tart to a bland banana bread. Next time I am going to add a little fresh lemon juice to add to the tartness.

I made it according to directions, except for walnuts as I'm allergic to nuts.  Was tasty and moist.  Will definitely make it again-one to enjoy right away and one to freeze to enjoy later.  A treat for the holidays for sure.

After reading other reviews, I decided to be bold with substitutions. Surprisingly, the bread turned out really well and I already have requests for more. I substituted as follows:

This bread came out incredibly moist.  I substituted 1 1/2 cups of coconut sugar for the white sugar.  Will definitely make it again.

YUM!! I subbed butter for the shortening and made the "Holiday Cranberry Sauce" from this site.  Made into muffins and sprinkled with raw sugar. Rave reviews from the family! 
Definitely a keeper! Thanks

I made according to recipe except that I used the entire can of whole cranberry sauce, approximately 1 1/4 cup, and discovered I was out of walnuts so used slivered almonds. For me the bread was way too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar by at least half.  Otherwise I felt the flavor was good.  As noted in another review, the center of my loaves collapsed while cooling.  Never had a quick bread do this and not exactly sure why it happened.  When I make it again I would probably try adding fresh cranberries just to get more of a tart 'pop' of contrast to the sweetness of the banana.
