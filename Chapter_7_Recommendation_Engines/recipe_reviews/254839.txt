It was easy to customize and my family enjoyed it. I did use 2 jars of sauce and doubled the cheese! It makes a lot, but we didn't mind the leftovers at all. ;)

I used the Barilla Tomato and Basil for this recipe and used two jars of it.  I also used 2 cups of everything regarding mushrooms, broccoli, and fire roasted red peppers.  I used 16 ounces of whole milk mozzarella.  This is one dish that EVERYONE loved.  This is very kid friendly and a very non-boring way to eat a lot of vegetables.  My advice is to go a little crazy with the veggies, and use your imagination!

I really liked the flavors in this dish. I used 2 hot Italian sausages and mini pepperoni pieces for the meat. I also used broccoli and roasted red peppers for the veggies. I cut the recipe in half and, in my opinion, had too much pasta. I added only as much as what I thought there was enough sauce for.  This and a salad made a delicious dinner!
