This pie had a distinct rubbery texture, and I assume this was from the gelatin. I tasted the filling from the bowl before I poured it into the pie shell and it tasted wonderful. I used Ghirardelli chocolate. I would make it again without adding the gelatin, perhaps serving it in dessert cups like a mousse.
I think the gelatin really detracts from the flavor of the pie.

This pie was great! I did make a change though. I didn't have unflavored gelatin when I made this so I substituted it for a package of raspberry flavored gelatin. It was amazing. I took it to our Christmas get together, and everybody loved it. It was a complete success and I will definitely make it again, probably trying different flavors of gelatin.

I agree with Katys. The pie was not "fluffy" like I expected it to be. It was def. rubbery. I, like Katys, tasted it before pouring in in the pie shell and it tasted wonderful. But after it set, I thought it was terrible. I would not make this again.
