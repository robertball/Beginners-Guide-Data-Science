This was a first for me. I have had grilled peanut butter and cheese and grilled bacon and cheese but never thought to combine all three. It was actually a very good combination of flavors. I used Velveeta slices. I would eat this again.

I had to take off the peanut butter because i'm allergic, but the bacon has a nice spin to it. If you don't want the sandwich to end up too greasy or soggy make sure you drain the grease out of the bacon. Too much will make the bread soggy and that's not all that great xP

Ok, it's a silly thing, but we adored these sandwiches. I would totally make these again.

This recipe is delicious!!! The combo sounds strange, but it works.  Made the recipe as stated, I would probably put peanut butter on both sides next time.  It's a keeper!!!

I was hoping this would be better.  It might be better with Maple Bacon or something.  It needed a little something sweet.  Jelly perhaps??
