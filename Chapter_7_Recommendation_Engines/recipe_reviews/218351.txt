I got some round steak at a great discount and tried this recipe hoping for something tender and tasty.  I did exactly as the recipe called for and it came out delish and really tender.    I will definitely hang on to this recipe for nights when I'm in a hurry but still want a home cooked meal.

I've made this for years and my whole family loved it.  The only difference being I left out the  chopped onion and in the last 10-minutes, added a drained can of peas I called it "Steak with Pea Gravy"!  I never tried it with the added onion, but cann't wait to try it!               Janet

Years ago I had this very dish, but we know it as Red eye gravy. I followed to a T and it was really really good. I double the batch because I was making for 7 people and there was nothing but the gravy left behind when the meat was eaten up. I think even if I double the meat and left the ketchup, onions and the water the same, it would still be plenty. The gravy still tasted like ketchup with a little bit of a nice kick, rather mild. Could use some black pepper, but other then that. It was fine and my family ate all the meat. TY. I'll have to repurpose the gravy with another meat.

I never thought of using round steak, I make a similar dish using pork chops.  I don't use the flour, although it would thicken the sauce/gravy as it cooks.  I simmer with the lid on and then off later to reduce the sauce.  Everyone is right, lots of onions and the ketchup and you have a great gravy for mashed potatoes!!

My mom used to make this when I was young only she used boneless porkchops and didn't dredge in flour.  She would salt and pepper chops, sear both sides in a little oil with the onions, cover chops with ketchup (she wouldn't use a whole bottle) and a little water, cover and simmer until tender.  I still make this today for my dad, since my mom past 2 years ago.  They are great with mashed potatoes.

Hubby loves this!!  It didn't really have time to cook enough to get tender and he still loved it.  Rubbed the steak with Cavenders Greek Seasoning and then sprinkled with flour and rubbed it in while the olive oil was heating.  Browned and removed and carmelized the onion before adding the ketchup and water to the pan.  Poured all over steak in roaster and cooked, covered, at 250 for four hours.  It needed more time but he couldn't wait, it smelled so good!  Great gravy and served with smashed potatoes.  Thanks for sharing!

I I was kinda afraid about it having so much ketchup so I changed alil bit the recipe,  I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder,  1/2 teaspoon onion powder and 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 Teaspoon ground pepper, I gotta say it was delicious! Doing this recipe again soon!

Well, the kids liked it a lot.  I wasn't as thrilled with the finished dish - not bad, but not fabulous either.  IMHO, the recipe makes about twice as much sauce as you need.

I was not crazy about this recipe. The flour did not work well at all so it was omitted after the first little bit. I did not care for the sauce on it's own, but over potatoes it was okay. My children however absolutely loved it! I will make it again, but probably only enough for them.

Had the butcher put the meat through the tenderizer; added paprika as some suggested; baked covered in the oven at 350-375 bout an hour.  Excellent - had no leftovers!

A surprising use of ketchup.  I love vinegar, and the vinegar flavor really comes out during cooking.  I really like this.

This was delicious. I have always followed my mom's direction to always tenderize a round steak. Also, I have to admit I added some fresh ground pepper, fresh carrots, worcestershire  sauce, and Cajun seasonings. I adore fresh pepper and Cajun seasonings! Thank you. My husband loved it and I plan to make it for our grandchildren!

This was tasty, very easy, but I would back off a little on the ketchup, add garlic and saute onions first.  You can really add pretty much anything to this.  I served over mini-gnocchi and everyone really liked it.  Be prepared for a strong vinegar taste as that comes out with the ketchup, but it is surprisingly interesting flavor. Good Luck!

Very easy, very tasty, plus it's versatile. I followed recipe exactly, but I had some mushrooms calling out to me. So I threw those in with the onions. Turned out great.
Served with steamed rice and sautéed squash (zucchini & yellow) with Parmesan.
Definitely will use again.

Pretty good.Did not use flour, followed Sue's recipes advice & took lid off last 15 min. I used a jar of canned tomatoes & 3 big squirts of ketchup. Needs more seasoning, i will use cavenders &/or old bay next time to spice it up a bit. Rolls were good with this dish.

I have made a similar recipe to this for years (got it from my Mom who got it from my Grandma). I use the onion and add baby carrots. Delicious!!! Also I cook it in the oven on 350.

I made it for dinner last week, i wasn't crazy about it but it was good. I like the simplicity.
