This was fantastic! I love the unique medley of ingredients. I have been fighting a cold and with the colorful rainbow of veggies I should be better in no time! I have never used pumpkin puree in chili but I think it gives a beautiful velvety touch along with the coconut milk. I did add a red pepper and pretty much doubled the recipe. I will DEF make this again and tweek a bit. Maybe a hint of lime would be great. Thanks so much!

I omitted the mushrooms and forgot the coconut milk.  It tasted good!

This was such a huge hit with my family -- even the picky eaters loved it, which is surprising because the ingredients seem so odd at first glance. "Sensational" was the word my wife used.

Had to use cilantro from a spice jar, since fresh was unavailable. Carrots are mentioned in the ingredients list but not in the directions, so I roasted them with the pineapple and corn. Just wondering . . . since you're roasting stuff anyway, why not roast the onions, too? Something to experiment with next time.

Super good! I made a few adjustments: I added 12 oz of  crushed pineapple(broiled w/ corn and some spices sprinkled over), a red pepper, 1 large 30 oz. can of pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of Oregano(I was out), In addition to a can of Black Beans I added 1 can of Buttered Beans as well to level out doubling the pumpkin and pineapple. I only used 2 C. of vegetable broth instead of 3 C. because others said it came out more like a soup. I'm really glad I used less broth. I like it thicker. I could still have used less broth. I added an extra 1 1/2 tsp of Harrissa Spice(blend of Caraway, Cayenne, Chiles, Coriander, Cumin, Garlic) Just thought it would give it more kick. I made this before bed and left it in the slow cooker all night. I was taste testing it before I went to bed and I kept saying wow this is REALLY nice, but let me tell you the spices intensified over night quite a bit, but not so much that  it was too overpowering.  Yes the xtra pineapple flavor made it sweeter but it still came together so good even with the extra pumpkin. I would not change the way I made it. I feel the extra spice I added is good this time of year (Late Dec.) but Summer I might not add as much spice because I noted the night before how nice the flavor was as well. I really think also next time I might even do less broth(1 1/2 C.) because It is still a little like soup. I am grateful thank you for sharing the recipe:) I would have never thought of it.

Just made this recipe for my family.  My family was worried cause there was no meat but it tasted amazing and was nice and hearty. We did use some sour cream along with the shredded cheese in our individual bowls.  I would definitely make this again.

I really like how these flavors combined and will be making it again. I didn't have carrots or mushrooms, and I subbed chicken broth for the veggie broth since I was adding chicken as suggested. I think I might try to make it spicier next time, or add more pineapple. I served it just as soup, but over jasmin rice, tortilla chips, or tortillas seems like it'd be a good combo.  **oh, i just threw it all in the crockpot (with thawed chicken on the bottom) since I needed fast and easy. 6.5 hours on low was perfect and then I shredded the chicken and stirred it back in.

I was really excited to try this chili, and while the ingredients were so diverse it had a 5 star rating so I thought it would be awesome.  Unfortunately for me, I'm not sure if this combination of things hit the mark.   I really did not like the pineapple in this dish...it was a little bizarre & if I made it again I would without a doubt omit it!  I like meat in my chili so I added some ground turkey breast. Just as other reviewers said, it does turn out more of a soup than a chili.  It definitely was different, and I recommend giving it a try based on all the other positive reviews....I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.

This is really good. Excellent combination of flavors. I actually came across this by accident when I planned on grilling but there was bad weather and had to come up with another way to use all the onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, and pineapple. I can't believe I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. If you like chili and/or pumpkin even a little bit you have to try this recipe!

No cheese or cilantro. Used Italian seasoning instead of oregano and curry powder instead of cumin. Still delicious.

This was a big hit.  So many different flavors mixed together.  It is definitely a keeper.  I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Next time, I might add some chicken.

Wow, this was a pleasant surprise!   As I was assembling the ingredients, I looked at the large amount of canned goods that went into this and I instantly regretted picking this recipe to make, but I decided to make it anyways.  I'm glad I did.   This recipe came together really nice.   It didn't have too much pumpkin taste and the pineapples and coconut milk didn't make it too sweet.   It came together as a nice mellow chili and was super smooth.   The directions of the recipe left out the carrots, but I added them in with the peppers, onions and mushrooms.   Maybe if I made this again I would add shredded chicken, but honestly this recipe doesn't need any revisions.

I thought I had submitted a review, but it doesn't seem to be here, so I must have accidentally deleted it before submitting. Grr!

I made this quite a while ago, as the combination of ingredients intrigued me - I'm always looking for something new. I had to make a few changes based on what is available where I live. However, I don't believe that these changes make a substantial difference in the results. First, I used frozen corn instead of canned, 1 pound of mushrooms (love them in everything!), green pepper instead of yellow, my own homemade tomato sauce (using garden fresh tomatoes), my own homemade pumpkin puree, and parsley instead of cilantro. I might have used beans that I had in the freezer (plain boiled), but I can't quite remember. Everything else was the same (ha, ha - I hope the recipe review police won't get after me! 

Anyway, our family found this chili quite delicious, and made with unusual ingredients. I served it with Basmati rice as it was a little soupy. Thanks to the submitter for this interesting recipe!

Really liked the idea of this.  Sounded unique and I love all the ingredients, but while tasty enough it falls short of being exciting enough to make you crave another bowl.

This chili was excellent, unique and quick to make.  I used frozen pineapple rather than canned and that change was smooth.  The only other change I made was to omit the pepper and cheese as I didn't have any.  The flavors were fabulous although next time I think I'll add slightly more chili powder.

I made this for myself, knowing my kids and hubby wouldn't eat it, and loved it.  Hubby ended up loving it as much as I did.  I followed the recipe but used cans of RoTel in place of tomatoes and did not have a carrot on hand that day.  Making this again soon!

This is an excellent soup! It's warm and hearty! The pineapple and pumpkin offer very nice flavors. I like to leave the cilantro as garnish and top the soup with sour cream.

Loved this recipe! I left out the mushrooms and used great northern beans because I was out of black beans. Amazing with a squirt of Siracha sauce if you like a little heat. Can't wait to make it again.

We tried this tonight. Tastes great. Different from the norm, but really good! I'd probably pick it over traditional, spicy chili and a lot of the white chicken chilis I've tried.  It's definitely not spicy if that's what you're looking for.

Love this chili!!  I used fresh corn cut off the cob and roasted it with the pineapple.  I added 2 more cans of beans as chili to me isn't chili with out more beans than other veggies. Might add a little more coconut milk next time.  We will be making this again!!
