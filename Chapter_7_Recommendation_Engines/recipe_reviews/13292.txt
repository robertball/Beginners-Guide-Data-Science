This is a handy recipe when you have a leftover chicken carcass but it does need to be livened up. I add chicken boullion poultry seasoning & whatever else I feel like. But a good basic soup.

Unimpressive. I had to add 1/4 cup of Wyler's shakers instant bouillon so that it would have a taste. I also added celery & noodles to make it into "Awesome chicken noodle soup" that is found on this site. It makes a good stock but then why not just call it leftover roast chicken STOCK. Very misleading.

I agree with MC_MA_OF 3 that it was very bland. The only way I like to make chicken soup IS with a left over chicken carcass. The roasting gives the soup a much better flavor however you really need to add a lot more seasonings including salt which I normally don't cook with but in a soup you do need some. By the way "Mom Of Three" I got a charge out of reading a couple of your reviews. Darn no tomato juice in the house!!!!

I'm giving this a 4 because I really didn't care for it the first night or the green beans in it either. However this is one of those recipes that gets better as a leftover. I did add a LOT of salt (probably 2 tbsp) to it as I am a salt freak but I still thought it was bland the first night. Hubby and son liked it surprisingly as neither are chicken lovers. I heated it up 3 days later and it was really good. The flavors had really come together. Thanks Nikki I will use this again.

Great use of leftover chicken frames! I used two leftover frames 8-10 cups water added 1 tablespoon of salt with the other additions and subbed peas for beans since that made more sense to me. Mine's not bland at all but that could be because I also added 5 jalapenos that were dying a slow miserable death on my counter. But I'd make this again without the peppers no problem!

Thanks was a great starter for my soup. I used some of the left over gravy to add some flavor along with chicken broth.

Did need more bouillon and salt. Also added some carrots and celery to the broth before straining.

I've made it last week. I used chicken broth instead of water! This weekend I'm using turkey! My husband loves it!!
