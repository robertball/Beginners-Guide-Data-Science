AMAZING!
The combination of flavors made this dish unique and delightful.  Fresh and savory, so delicious.  I prepared exactly as written except I didn't have fresh thyme so I used about a teaspoon of dried.  We follow a low-carb diet, so I served as is, no noodles, rice, etc.  Absolutely wonderful; I will DEFINITELY make this again.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my 2nd time making this.. and its unbelievable.  So yummy and easy.  Great for hosting as you do the work before and then take out of oven.  Leftovers are even better.. so I made a huge amount today.  I suggest keeps sides easy with warmed good french bread and green salad.  Then just enjoy your company and meal!

Made exactly as written and it was wonderful. I served it with fresh green beans and a crusty Italian bread. There was none left and everyone raved about it. Be sure to season the thighs well with salt and pepper before browning.

Made it exactly as written. I was afraid the fennel would over-power the dish but it had a very mellow flavor. I served it with a buttery rice with vermicelli and a green salad. This recipe is delicious and is definitely a keeper

Followed the recipe exactly and served it with linguini. It was a hit with everyone including picky teenagers. I loved the lemon zest to finish. I will definitely be making this again.

This had great flavor. Used fresh and canned tomatoes as well as a variety of olives. I'd definitely make again.
