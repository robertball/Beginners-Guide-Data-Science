Excellent!  Chicken kiev is always time consuming to prepare but is worth it if you use some TLC.  Shape the butter into logs and freeze before using, easier to stuff the breast and less likely to leak out while cooking.  I added 1 tbls lemon zest to the butter to increase the lemon flavor.  After assembling if you have time, put the chicken in the fridge for an hour, this lets the seam set and greatly reduces the chances of the butter leaking out.  Instead of deep fat frying, I browned the breasts in a skillet in olive oil and butter than baked for 20-30 minutes.  They also freeze beautifully so make a double batch and freeze one batch so you can enjoy them quicker the next time.  Just add 5-15 minutes to the baking time.

This recipe is really good, however I had a hard time keeping the butter in the chicken.  I fried the chicken for about 2 minutes on each side, then baked it for about 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven and it came out perfectly.  I did use more dill, because I love it.  A great recipe!

I have to disagree with everyone who said this recipe was 'easy'.  

To keep it short and sweet, be prepared.  It was messy, time consuming (getting the chicken wrapped securely around those pats of butter is HARD....rolling the chicken breasts pierced with skewers/toothpicks in the coatings and getting them well-covered is even harder!!) and the end result was very bland.  Maybe I should have used some salt (which is not listed anywhere in the recipe)??

Prior to using a recipe from this web page I like to read the reviews.  I took a few things into account, like not lemoney enough and to filet the chicken breasts.  I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried ones and added one more tsp of lemon juice.  I also prefer my chicken kiev baked so I added some extra virgin olive oil to the bread crumbs prior to the coating step.  I then baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  They were so good my 5 and 3 year olds made up a new word to describe how good this was.  My husband thought they were better than the store bought brands...definitely will make these again....They were a big Valentine's Day HIT!!

Good when stuffed and baked. I've never had good luck flattening chicken evenly so I cut a slit and pocket in each breast and pushed, squeezed or otherwise injected the butter/chive/parsely mixture in the pocket. It didn't leak out and still kept the chicken moist. It looks very impressive when done and tastes great!

Delicious! I added some dill to the bread crumbs, and opted to bake rather than fry (375 degrees F / 190 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes) for a healthier version.

Beginner cook and this was excellent. I added a touch (two leaves of basil)to the recipe. Be sure to flatten breasts to about 1/4 inch else they don't cook sufficiently.

I'd never tried making Chicken Kiev before, but the recipe turned out better than I've ever eaten! I highly recommend this, as long as you have a couple of hours to spare.

this is the first time that I ever made this dish, I diidn't fry it, I drizzled with olive oil and baked it at moderate heat for about 25 minutes. It's very good and not at all greasy like I thought it would be. I used a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and panko crumbs and so it was really crispy. Thanks for a great recipe. I would have rated this 5 stars, but never having it beofre, I had nothing to compare it to.

Excellent recipe.  I need to practice the skills but even for a first time, this turned out very well and my family all enjoyed it, even the picky eaters.  This is worth the effort for a special dinner, but isn't overly fussy.  I used a meat thermometer to gauge the chicken which also helped.

Wonderful! Brought back memories of eating at the Mir Hotel in Moscow. I prepared and served this recipe for 3 adults and 4 children. Adults and children enjoyed it. I kept reminding the kids to watch out for the toothpicks.
During preparation I had better luck pounding the chicken in a large glad zip-lock bag than with wax paper.

This is not as easy as those frozen ones you can buy but they taste a lot better. The steps in this recipe may make someone apprehensive but it wasn't as hard as it appears. I too used another's advice and fried for a few min and then baked until cooked through. I served over Uncle Ben's wild rice pilaf and a side of steamed veggies and it was very good. It worked great for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend and leftovers were ALMOST as good as the ones right out of the oven.

Very good and if you are having trouble with keeping the chicken together use some cooking string like they have on roasts and untie before serving!!

This was extremely good!  I made more butter then was called for in order to double stuff the chicken.  Turned out great and it was extremely buttery inside!  Loved it!

This turned out pretty good.  I followed the suggestions of others and fried them for about 6 minutes until they were browned and then baked them in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1.5 tsps garlic powder for the garlic butter.  I also used fresh dill (about 1 Tablespoon but think I should have used more).  One thing I didn't like is that the flour seemed to all come off in the egg mixture.  Next time I think I might just mix the dill (etc) with the bread crumbs so I don't lose it all.  It was also a whole lot of effort for dinner, but the taste was definitely worth it.

I gave this recipe 4 stars when in reality it merely gave me a guideline and I took it and ran with it.  My butter was from a tub of flavored herb butter I got as a Christmas gift, and I flavored my bread crumbs with seasoned salt.  And finally, I took another reviewer's suggestion and merely pan seared in a little oil, to brown and crisp up the crumbs, rather than deep frying, and finished it in the oven.  I've never made chicken kiev where the butter didn't completely leak, but cooking it in a small pan and spooning the liquid butter over the finished chicken was pretty darn delicious!

The directions made this complicated recipe easy to follow. I also sauteed the kievs in olive oil before baking them at 350 for 20 minutes--came out perfectly. Thanks!

Surprisingly easy to make, for a recipe that comes out so impressive!  For a variation, try stuffing it with chopped veggies.  Excellent!

This recipe was very good. I used Italian bread crumbs to give the chicken a little more flavor.

For a healthier recipe, I rolled the chicken breasts in organic wholemeal flour which I seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper. Also, found the chicken breasts tasted a little bland, so I seasoned the chicken with a tinge of salt and pepper before I inserted the butter pieces. Baking did not appeal to me as it meant waiting a long time for the meal. So I pan fried the chicken breasts on medium heat and it was wonderful. By the way, for low sodium content, I used Himalayan rock salt. It is a better idea to flatten the chicken breasts and then slice a small pocket inside to house the butter piece. That way, you can be assured that the butter will not ooze out during cooking.

This recipe is fabulous!!  I really enjoyed it and found it fairly easy to make.  The hardest part is rolling the butter into the chicken.  I used garlic salt instead of powder because I love salt.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand!!!

Found this recipe this morning! Very good! Very easy! The butter froze enough on a dinner plate to roll in the chickennand I added a little parsley and freshly grated garlic to the mix, just as one other commenter posted they had done. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Following the directions was simple and dinner was a huge success! Thank you! Recipe favorited!

After reading reviews - I chose 2 variations ... I filleted the breasts and chose baking vs. frying.   - This was good! I did premake the butter mix and used any extra for my accompanying rice.

Fantastic!  I didn't have chives on hand, so I used parsley, basil and garlic to season the butter.  Wrong?  Maybe, but it was delicious!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made them ahead of time and kept them in the fridge for a couple hours before frying. I followed other users advice and quick fried them and put them in the oven for about 15min to finish. They turned out great. Will definately make them again.

This was pretty good.  I think 8 minutes was a bit too long.  But I should have checked for doneness a bit sooner.  I have never had chicken kiev and thought this was good, although my boyfriend remembered it being a bit more lemony. A good dinner, but I will keep looking for a more lemony chicken kiev recipe.  Thanks!

I start making this the day before. When I put the butter in the chicken, I wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. It's easier to flour and egg it the next day, because it is firmly set in the rolled shape.

My family loved it!  Next time we will use half the dill, though.  I had chicken thighs instead of breasts so I put the butter under the skin, coated it and cooked it like you would Southern fried chicken.  It worked out just fine.

Made this tonight for my family!!! What a hit!! We used Crisco instead of vegetable oil, it fries so much better. I fried and then baked as others suggested. My family LOVED it! Even if some of the butter escapes, it flavors the chicken enough that its not a huge deal! Very good! We will make a again!

Good taste for butter filling, another option is tarragon instead of chives (or basil) Also blending a loaf of italian bread to make crumbs instead of dried crumbs is good too...

I really loved the flavor of this! I sprinkled some garlic powder on the chx breasts with the salt and pepper and I seasoned the bread crumbs with some lemon pepper and all-purpose galic-greek seasoning. I didn't fry mine in a deep-frier. I fried it in a pan over low heat...I think next time I might bake it. It's so pretty when you cut into and the herbed butter oozes out of it! Thanks!

Wow, just delish! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It took me awhile to be sure the chicken was completely cooked, but with thinner chicken breasts I think I'd get a better end result, but besides that, it was very yummy and a big hit with my mom! ;) Thanks for posting!

We had company over for dinner and this recipe really impressed! After reading the reviews, I fried the chicken like the recipes states, but then baked it in the oven to finish cooking. It seemed like I lost a lot of the butter while it was baking, but there was still plenty left inside. It was also really juicy and flavorful. It was a little time consuming, but this will become a weekly staple in our household. What I liked best was that I already had all the ingredients.

I have to agree the recipe was a bit bland and the butter was difficult to contain. I often find many of these recipes bland and in need of more. I always enjoy skinless boneless chicken breast recipes for the health value but all the butter negates this benefit. C'est la vie. I will be trying it again.

This does take time. . . and is in my opinion tough. . however that being said it is not impossible to pull off. A few things, make sure your oil isn't too HOT! my poor guys burned in a minute. . .still good but not cooked and they had to be finished in the oven. Second, I would make a garlic sauce to go over them to save the flavor if your butter disappeared. Some salt wouldn't go astray in this dish. Basically don't expect to get it right first try. . .experiment lol And more dill!

Chicken was very moist. I brinned it for 3 hours prior to preparation. Couldn't really taste the dill or the garlic - recommend using more of each and probably coating the outside just prior to the flour. Also I think cheese like fontina would be a great addition. I pre-softened the butter for 15 seconds in the microwave which helped blend the ingredients and shape it into the required rectangle. Also cooked in a pot instead of a pan. The oil was higher 2/3 up the rolled breasts and six minutes worked perfectly on both sides. Got a great brown this way as well. If you don't use cheese recommend a little salt. This dish has an excellent look just needs a little more flavor. I didn't use fresh dill (rather out of container) probably a mistake. I also might use boiled fresh garlic in the butter mixture next time.

What, no garlic?  I don't like mine rolled in bread crumbs, but simply egg wash and flour to fill the seams so the butter doesn't leak.  Just before cooking, try rolling them in eggwash again and roll in Panko.  Yum

I went to my.butcher and had him butterfly a nice plump, lean boneless chicken breast. Much easier to.pound flat and roll up starting with a thin fillet. Messy? Yes. But worth the effort.

I didn't freeze the butter but it comes out and melts. If you want to save a few calories, fry it in little oil and then bake it.

Took to a dinner party with Uzbekistan theme, never having made fried chicken in my life, snatched up the second I put it down, had to snag a piece for myself...I used tenderloins instead of breast simply so I could serve more (made frying time 5 mins), delish!!! the butter is everything!!! Total freaking hit.

What I did was make a pocket and stuffed the herbed butter in it, secured it with toothpick, proceeded to bread it, fry and finished in the oven. Remember to pierce the chicken in the pointed tip to let the "pressure" out before serving. Bon appetit!

I had some trouble getting the chicken breasts to roll up and stay that way, but I blame the chicken I bought for that. This recipe has some pretty good flavor.

Followed the recipe but added a small amount of lemon zest from the fresh lemon. After mixing the butter mixture I poured it into a foil-shaped structure and froze it--easy to cut and place on chicken breast later. Be careful not to flatten too much or tear the chicken breast when pounding. I used Panko crumbs, browned in oil on top of stove, and then baked for about 25 minutes at 375°. Looked beautiful and tasted delicious.

I wish that I had read the reviews before I made this dish, but I was in a hurry.  As written, this is a 3-star recipe and not worth the effort.  If I make these again, I will filet the breasts or bake in the oven as others have suggested. Mine took anywhere from 12-15 minutes to cook and were nearly burnt on the outside.  I will also use lemon zest instead of lemon juice.  I used real butter and could not get the lemon juice to incorporate into the butter.  This might be okay to try again with some adjustments.

It was OK. I have an old recipe, but it is quite time consuming. I was hoping for a quick way to a delicious end. Really good Chicken Kiev takes time.

I baked it instead of frying it and just drizzled a little bit of Olive Oil on top before cooking to help with the browning.  I also didn't use an egg wash, I just used Skim Milk instead.  And also used a less fat butter.  All to make it a little healthier.  I also used more seasoning then the recipe called for.

I made this recipe for a family potluck and everyone absolutely loved it!  Just a little time consuming.

my husband and kids loved this! Even my six yr old enjoyed helping me make it.
