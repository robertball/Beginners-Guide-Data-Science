Sorry, but this chili did not work out for us.  I had really been looking forward to this, so it was disappointing.  The flavor was just unusual, and not in a good way.  Mixing ranch beans, beer, cocoa, and the other spices together had strange results that we found unpleasant.  The redeeming thing about this recipe is the cornbread waffles.  They were delightful!  I would definitely make those again to serve alongside a different chili.

I used twice the brisket recommendation as it was leftover from a couple briskets I smoked for a party.  Everyone loved the waffles - I served them on the side for people to use as they pleased.  This was a great recipe for leftover brisket and I strongly recommend giving this a try.

This was just okay to me. I think that the recipe calls for too much coco. I had to add beans and tomato sauce to try and fix the flavor. If I was to make this again (which I won't)I would use less coco or no coco. I also cut the brisket in cubes, then seasoned and browned the meat. after I cooked all the other ingredients, I poured all into a crockpot and let it cook.
