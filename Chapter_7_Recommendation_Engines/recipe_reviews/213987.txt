OMG!!!!  Can I begin to tell you how amazing this is!  The only thing I changed was that I added boneless diced pork at the five minute mark of the ten minute simmer with the kaffir lime leaves (i.e., five minutes coconut milk and lime; the next five minutes, add the pork). I only did this to make it a little heartier but TRUST ME even as written this is an amazing dish with an incredible balance.

Do, do, DO try to get galangal and not ginger. So many people treat them as interchangeable but trust me, they're not.  You will know the difference because galangal is smoother on the surface and has almost "tiger stripes" on it (google a picture of it, you'll see what I mean). And YES, if you can find them, spring for the bag of kaffir lime leaves. They keep forever in the freezer and are well worth the investment for the difference they make in flavour to using just lime juice.

I served it over jasmine rice and my life changed for the better, forever.  Thanks for the great recipe Wiley!

I needed a vegetarian version, so I substituted 1T Miso for the fish sauce and added cubed ex firm tofu.  I swear the sauce is so good I caught my picky 12 year old trying to lick the pot!
