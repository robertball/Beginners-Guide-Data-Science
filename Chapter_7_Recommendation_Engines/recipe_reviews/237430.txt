Delicious! I omitted the carrots (didn't have any on hand) and added in sliced mushrooms, red pepper and a little fresh spinach that I had to use up along w/ the spinach and tomatoes. I used more than 1 clove of garlic, and just eyeballed the cheese until the sauce was the thickness that I wanted. The whole family gobbled this up! This is a great recipe to make when you have a lot of odd and end veggies in the fridge that need used up. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Came out looking colorful and tasted great. I liked how the tomatoes cut through the richness of the sauce. I used squash and zucchini instead of carrots, but everything else was the same. Very delicious, but I might use a little veggie stock/sauce mix next time if I'm not in the mood for a rich sauce.

Made it for Brunch.  Asparagus, zucchini, red and green peppers.  No carrots no tomatoes.   Despite double the cream used-  It was not too thick and cheesy.  Very tasty and easy to put together.  The different veggie colors made it a very nice looking dish. Would definitely make again.  It could use something to give it a little more "zing," but otherwise good.

Earlier this week, I've made the creamy penne pasta primavera. It was fantastic. I passed on the asparagus and had no substitute for it. Instead of shredding a carrot, I've used matchstick sliced carrots instead. I've added more cherry tomatoes to make up for the loss of other veggies. And leftovers was awesome as well. I'll make it again for sure.

I pulled this recipe from my All Recipes magazine April/May 2019 and made the Healthy Pasta Primavera and the fresh sautéed vegetables and fresh oregano was so yummy!

I made it without measuring.  I used Campanelli pasta, 1 tomato sliced and peas instead of asparagus. I didn’t have Parmesan cheese so I added some Alfredo sauce with the cream. It turned out great and my 3 year old ate all of it.

Nothing special here....actually won't make again - prefer either a true Alfredo with added veggies or an olive oil based primavera better.

I make a variant of this recipe using bow tie pasta and I add spinach and frozen peas.  I also roast the asparagus in the oven at 450 for 10-15 min.  Delicious!

It was ok, not sure if I'll make it again. I followed recipe, but added yellow pepper for color and taste. I felt it needed more sauce. It didn't taste like Omg I need to make again, if I do, I'll double sauce and omit tomatoes.

I threw in most of the veggies I had- asparagus, onion, red and orange mini peppers, yellow zucchini, squash and tomatoes. It was very tasty! I also ate it with my homemade farfalle pasta which made it even tastier. I followed the directions as written other than the veggies.

I used the carrots, garlic, and tomatoes as listed, but added fresh broccoli  florets instead of asparagus. I used 16 ounces of heavy cream and 8ounces of shaved Parmesan cheese to make it really  creamy. This recipe is so delicious, and I will make it again trying different vegetables.

Really easy to make. I used veggies that were in the fridge: broccoli, sugar peas, carrots,  cherry tomatoes, & asparagus. I added a little extra garlic.  The flavor was a little bland & the cheese a little stringy, will try to solve those 2 issues the next time I make it.

I thought this was great. I plan to try making it next time with whole milk. I used mushrooms, carrots, red pepper, onions, garlic and asparagus and made it with penne.

Great way of having asparagus. I only changed a couple of things, mushrooms instead of carrots, because I'm not so crazy about cooked carrots. Also half and half instead of heavy cream. Oh and I used less tomatoes, I didn't have that many, just a cup or so. It was absolutely delicious!

There were so many tomatoes the sauce turned pink. They didn't really add anything good to the dish either because they fell apart and added too much tartness.   It's a good thing I checked on them because the brand I used had a much shorter cooking time.

Very yummy dish. Super easy to prepare and is a great addition to the menu. I added salt and pepper to taste but also added some hot pepper to give it a kick. Nice flavor and even the kids enjoyed it.

Awesome recipe. I didn't have asparagus so I put a yellow paprika instead and it was great!
