This is a must to try!  Loved it and will definately make this again.  My husband loved it too.  Great on a cold night with crusty rolls.

This recipe is totally yummy as long as you like spicy food. Not to mention it's very easy and very quick. I make it all the time and I definitely suggest you try it. If the spice gets to you, add fewer jalapenos!

this recipe is so easy.  I had been looking for a good peanut sauce since getting hooked on it in West Africa.  This one really hit the spot.  I like to eat this as a sauce over rice instead of as a soup.  So I use less broth and more of everything else.  I also use vegetable broth and organic peanut butter (instead of the super sweet/salty kind).  Highly recommend it.

I enjoyed this soup very much. I added a little half and half to make it creamier. I think next time I'll add better peanut butter as mine settled.

I added celery I used about a half of a jalapeno pepper added some red peppers. I didn't add much onion. I thought it tasted good. It was kind of runny I probably should have added more peanut butter. I didn't put 4 cups of chicken broth I only used one can. I guess I cut this recipe in half I wasn't sure if I would like it. I did like it tasted could I love spicy foods.

WOW. this recipe looked very interesting, but I am on a tight budget so I had to improvise everything but the bell pepper! I started with dried onion flakes and reconstituded them in the juice from a can of cooked chicken breast meat. then I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1 chopped green bell pepper. I sauteed until tender. Then I added 1 can cream of chicken soup with 1 can of water, the meat from the canned chicken and a sprinkle of garlic salt. I then lowered the temp and added 1 cup of peanut butter and 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar. I didn't think it was spicy enough so I added more cayenne. It was thick and creamy, salty, spicy, and rich with flavor. Absolutely delicious. I served over brown rice. I hope my husband likes it, because I will make it again and again!

We enjoyed this. I believe I enjoyed it more than my husband, because I'm more used to peanut butter soup. I used red bell pepper in place of green, and I pureed my soup with an immersion blender, because my husband has texture issues with cooked veggies. Served this with grilled pb&j sandwiches and it was a comfort food for me :) Thanks for the recipe! (*In the future I would add celery, a can of Ro-tel, and some fresh thyme.)

Horrible. I threw out without serving. I followed this recipe exactly - measuring everything, and timing everything precisely as it states. It is runny and tastes like spicy onion water! I do not recommend and I am not a picky eater normally. Yuck.

The flavor was very strong and needed no added seasonings, so I would rate the taste 5 stars.  But visually, this was unappetizing, and the texture was unpleasant.  It didn't look like it would taste good and the soup itself was very thin.  I would add more vegetables to it if I made it again.

Sorry but I didn't like this at all!  I tried to spice it up a bit by adding more peanut butter and crushed red pepper but it still tasted awful.  Consistency was very runny as well.  At least it was easy to make so not too much time was wasted on it.

Very good- we lessened the spicy ingredients a bit for our more sensitive family, and it was still very tasty and super easy.

This was so much easier than some other peanut soup recipes.  I added some peas and chopped tomatoes to the soup just for more substance.  I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I used red pepper flakes which spiced it up.  This soup is great on its own without all the veggies.  As another reviewer mentioned, this soup could also be served with rice--just add less broth to make it thicker.

Absolutely delicious!  I added hot peppers and used smooth PB as I didn't have any crunchy.  Next time I will try using organic... definitely a great recipe!

This was delicious. I used a vegetable broth instead of chicken, natural peanut butter, and added 1 additional very hot pepper (Madame Jeanette) and it was wonderful. Will definately have it again!

This was okay, but it seems to need more substance. (Veggies, potatoes, rice)I used a fresh habanero pepper instead of jalapeno, but other than that, I stuck to the original recipe. If I make this again, I'll double the recipe and add my own twist on it, I think. Probably diced potatoes.... Served this with Best Ever Corn Muffins, a good pairing.

WAY too rich...and I *love* PB.  I think that it would make a good sauce for rice, though, if used in serious moderation.

I was afraid to try at first because of some people saying it was runny... plus peanut soup?  I made mine for a serving of two and it came out awesome!  Real good.  I used two different type of peanut butter.  I used a cheap crunchy brand and it was runny, then I added a few spoons of a creamy brand and it came out great.  

The next time I will use a creamy non-crunchy brand because I have braces.  And I will try unsweetened.  It was great but very rich, and I am not a person who can eat very rich stuff for long.  But overall, it was good.
