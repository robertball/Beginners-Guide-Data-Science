Terrific! I  grew up in South Bend and cannot find ANY Polish food  here in Oregon which compares to that from home, not even at our local St Stan's parish. The only thing to have made this dish better would to have had it made and served by the Polish ladies at St Hedwig hall! Now, if only Eby's shipped kielbasa....

I grew up in St. Adlaberts parish and watched the cooks (Mrs. B as all us servers called her) make their noodles many times.  Yummy.  My mom makes them to and her recipe includes adding a 1/2  stick  of butter to the broth

Awesome recipe! I come from a Polish family in South Bend, IN and this recipe made everyone happy! It's the classic noodles we all love at weddings and holiday feasts! I did add a bit more soup base (bought the essenhaus brand at my local Polish market) to give it a bigger punch of flavor.

I am from South Bend and make these quite often. In addition to this recipe I add about a half a stick or margarine and a can of cream of chicken soup when they are done! This makes them extra creamy!

These were delicious! The soup base is quite salty so I recommend using a reduced sodium chicken broth.  I also felt they could use a fresh element so I added some fresh chopped parsley to mine as a garnish. These are super simple and this type of noodle is about as close to a home made one as you are going to get from a package. I will use this recipe often!

Great and easy side dish that I’d make again. I bought thick egg noodles at Aldi and used those. I also added granulated onion and granulated garlic, because that’s my thing. These noodles would be AMAZING under a Beef Stew on a cold day. I’m feeding men here and they really liked these. Thanks for the recipe.

I am from South Bend too and sure do miss a good Polish Wedding (and the food).  This is the way I traditionally make it as well.  Except I add a little bit of yellow food coloring sometimes.  This was something my mother in law did to give it great color.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used my crockpot to save space on stove. I added the broth and chicken (I cheated...I used precooked chicken already diced) on high (4 hrs)... for about one hour before I cooked noodles to al' dente, about 12 mins.  I drained noodles and added them to crockpot. I turned the heat to low on crockpot (mine has 12 hr. for low) this way your noodles will not turn mushy.  Very yummy they were, not much left overs! Thanks

Born and raised in South Bend, still live there.  These are the best noodles.  I have friends who relocated here from the west coast and had never had them.  The noodles are now one of the  dishes requested for Easter dinner.  I also add parsley flakes to these.
