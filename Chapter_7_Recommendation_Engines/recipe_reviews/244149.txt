I left out sugar and just used one cup of vinegar. Actually I think it can be done with even less.  also didn't make it very spicy, only mild-medium. Sugar is not needed at all, I don't want  sweet salsa. Don't know why anybody would add sugar to Salsa, but that's just my 5 cents.

I used jalapeños instead of banana peppers and when I tasted it before canning I thought it was going to be very spicy. However, after processing it and not trying it for several months, when we did open a jar it was fantastic! It actually came out to be mild and slightly sweet - perfect if you want to add jalapeños to the dish you are serving. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing!

my co-workers liked it. said it was like store bought. but they like my fresh salsa better. would cut out the super, add more heat and salt. only used about 7-8 cups onion which was fine. would add 2 bunches of cilantro instead of the  1 I used. I liked the tomatoes paste but used 3 6 Oz cans instead of 2 8 oz. will cut back on that too. otherwise I think you need the vinegar to preserve the canned goods.

No changes made to recipe first round but we chose to omit the Cilantro(made Spouse feel unwell just with the smell of it) on the second batch still Loved it. Will definitely be making this again and again I'm sure.

Very good base recipe.   Had to adjust several amounts of the ingredients, hence the four stars.  Less vinegar.  Less cilantro.  More garlic.  More heat.

I questioned whether I should keep the vinegar or not. Big mistake to add it. It's way too thin and detracts from the flavors.  I had to cook it a long time to get it to a good consistancy. No vinegar, no sugar and it would be better.

Delish!  I made it exactly as written.  My husband and I both loved it, but next time would use less, or eliminate the sugar, but that is personal preference, it was wonderful as written.  One weird thing:  I included all the ingredients, in the exact amount intended, and only ended up with 10, rather than 17 pints!

Gave me a good foundation of where to start. Cut out the vinegar, not neccessary. Cut out sugar, also not needed. I used anaheims, serranos, and jalapenos and roasted them with my bell peppers on the traeger before dicing them up and adding them. Only needs 1 large sweet onion.

Excellent recipe!  Alter the sugar and salt according to your taste. I used 5 different kinds of peppers. I know you realize, but wear gloves to cut the jalapeños. I roasted, deseeded and cut 2 dozen, and my fingers have been burning all day. Duh.

Too much salt in my opinion. I followed the recipe exact. I also added cumin. Fabulous but cut salt in half.

I have been making this for the past 2 years. I cut the sugar in 1/2 and sub ghost pepper for the chilis. 17 pints use 3-4 ghost peppers, seeded and chopped fine. Add more if you like extreme salsa. Its almost time again so I thought I would thank cookingmama for sharing.

the only changes I made was to cut the recipe down, but I used a calculator because when canning, you have to do that so the acidity level is correct. I also used apple cider vinegar as that was all I had. to make the tomato's easy to peel I put them in boiling water for 1 min and then straight into a ice bath, they peeled real easy!!

Yummy!  My husband loved it too. I will make this again!  I used only the brown sugar and it was still a little too sweet.  I’ll cut the brown sugar in half next time.

Recommend using Roma tomatoes - I have made this recipe a few times, but used just regular tomatoes this year.  A bit too watery and cooked the salsa down.

This turned out yummy and easy to make!  I had to alter the amount. I had to adjust the servings based on the number of tomatoes I had.
