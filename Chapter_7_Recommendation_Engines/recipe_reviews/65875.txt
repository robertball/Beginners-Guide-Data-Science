Used this glaze last year and the entire family loved it so much that I'm using it again this year. Real easy to prepare and use. :)

This was the hit of Thanksgiving, hardly anyone ate turkey.  In addition to the glaze, I cooked the ham on the bar-b-que and used hickory chips for a little extra flavor.  While the ham was cooking I added the glaze as directed.

My fault, I did not read the fine print cook time.  I made it too late and didn't realize how long it took to cook down to 1 cup!  Everyone was starving.  I did not purchase real star anise-too expensive, so I used ground.  It did not have much flavor the way I made it and for the amount of time it took, it wasn't worth it to me.  Hope someone else who uses real star anise has better luck.  Maybe I'll try it for Easter.
