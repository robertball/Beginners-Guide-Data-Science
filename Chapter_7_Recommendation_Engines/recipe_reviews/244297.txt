Easy and good.  I added 2 tsp of chicken bouillon to the water the quinoa was cooked in and used coleslaw dressing instead of ranch.  I also added some chopped dried cranberries for  color and another flavor layer.

This is a good and healthy basic salad.  I didnt have any walnuts on hand so I substituted pecans but otherwise I followed the recipe.
