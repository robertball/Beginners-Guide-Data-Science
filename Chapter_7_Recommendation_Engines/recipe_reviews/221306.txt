LOVE Bee's Knees! I had it in a 1920s throwback bar in Boston and fell in love. Thanks for the recipe! It tasted exactly right! The honey syrup is easy to make, make sure you mix it up until the honey dissolves. I made the mistake of thinking I could just squeeze honey in with the gin, but it made a goopy ball. Delicious recipe!

great old school cocktail. If you make a pitcher of this classic, I suggest throwing a few sprigs of thyme for an herbaceous twist

We taste tested several 1920's era cocktails for a party and this was included. We did not care for it.
