It makes sense to me to omit the boxed hamburger meal and just use plain pasta and add your own seasonings...otherwise you are just adding a whole bunch of ingredients to try and mask the horrible taste of hamburger helper.

I don't see the value of doing the work this dish takes, and then adding the unhealthy additives present in a boxed Hamburger Helper.  I couldn't recommend this dish.

I just wanted to say that the caseerole came out excellent! We made a side of brown rice with this dish. I made some changes however. I added 2 turkey sausages into the meat mixed and used a little more bread crumbs. Instead of one pack of cream cheese, I used two packets of powdered cheese mix that came with the "hamburger helper". I didnt use hamburger helper, I used an organic brand and used two boxes instead of one. I also added some cut onions to the water.  I completly took out the nutmeg and instead added some bays seasoning, thyme, parsley and the salt. I used real garlic instead of powdered then I used a tablespoon of tomato paste along with the a1 sauce. Also, after I cooked the meatballs and the macaroni in the oven. I added a bag full of mixed veggies. Mixed together and added the meatballs on top with Mottzarealla cheese sprinkled over the top and some olive oil.  I let it cook for ten minutes and all done! A delicious meal!  Thanks.

So after reading all the other reviews I decided not to use nutmeg and used garlic powder and onion powder. After cooking noodles I added fresh green beans then the cooked meatballs and baked together. My husband said it was a great stroganoff with a side of green beans. I will make again and just steam the green beans on the side.

I basically just used the idea of it. I didn't have hamburger helper so I had to do some substitutions.

The noodles would have been better off boiled in water, and the sauce mix just made separately. Omitted nutmeg and added celery seed.  Otherwise a very tasty meal.
