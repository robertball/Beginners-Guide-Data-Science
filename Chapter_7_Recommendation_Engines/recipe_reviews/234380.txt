Pretty much followed the recipe except for omitting the oil & adding a half cup bread crumbs to help bind them.  They smelled pretty good before cooking, but tastewise after, just okay.  No big deal.  'Couldn't really tell I'd used barbecue at all - & it was spicy.  It definitely improved the flavor when put on the burgers, but ho-hum without.  Maybe dry rub spices would be a better option.

I thought these were okay, but was surprised the bbq sauce flavor didn't really come through. It also changes the texture some, which I didn't love. Only change I made was subbing 2 Tblsp of very finely minced yellow onion for the green. I used Guy Fieri brown sugar bourbon bbq sauce I had leftover from another recipe. I shaped them using a mashed potato scoop and got 8 smaller burgers. To save time, I also broiled them. I thought they would have been good with some garlic, so I just sprinkled some garlic salt on top after they were done. That helped some. For a quick and easy complete meal, I served them with Ore Ida baked tater tots.

Giving this three stars because I like the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and these burgers didn't hold together. They were soft and fell apart when I tried to flip them. Wound up just putting the cooked ground turkey on a bun like sloppy joes.
