I am not much of a baker -- so keep that in mind. I had trouble with the "crumbly but holds together" description; I added lots of extra flour to get the dough as described then after chilling and rolling discovered it was much too dry. Worked in a little more water until it would roll out. Other than that the recipe worked fine and the turnovers are very good especially drizzled with honey!

I had the HARDEST time with the dough. It was either too crumbly or too soft. Tip: Use a knife to get the dough off of the surface you're using to make the pies I think my difficulties were in part because of the fact that I had to hand mix the dough and also had no rolling pin. Other than that this recipe was very easy. Just got these out of the oven they are SOOOOOOOO good!
