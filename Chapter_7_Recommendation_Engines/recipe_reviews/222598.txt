We LOVE this recipe. I think it'd be great as is, but I have made a few adjustments to make it healthier and vegan, to suit our tastes. Instead of olive oil, I cook the veggies in step 2 in veg broth. I added a chopped zucchini to that step and halve the rice to make up for it. I lined the tortilla with baby spinach before adding the mixture. I skip the cheese totally and top it with chopped cabbage. I use enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  It makes a TON, so it's worth the time it takes to make this dish. It's not difficult to make, you just have to plan ahead to have it ready by the time you need it.

Pretty great vegetarian enchiladas! The only comments I have are that I really prefer a saucier enchilada, so I would probably sauce it up with a traditional enchilada sauce not just topped with salsa next time. And, I ended up having to use two pans, because I could only fit 5 in my pan. When I rolled them tighter, too much of the filling fell out of the ends. This is not a quick meal because the brown rice takes so much time to cook, but it makes a large amount, so I could easily make this on an evening when I have a bit more time, to eat on a night that I don't. Thanks!

Increased cheese to two cups and just used my favorite enchilada sauce instead. Great for meatless Monday.

Delicious...thank you!!  I made it as shown except I didn't feel like rolling the tortillas, so I laid a layer of homemade enchilada sauce, a layer of corn tortillas, a layer of mixture, a layer of cheese, and repeated.  On the top layer, I spread salsa out, then baked it.

I made this last night and they were excellent. I did a couple of thing different, I used homemade Cuban style black beans, used both green and yellow bells. I omitted the spices and rotel (cuban black beans has the same seasonings) added queso fresca with the cheddar. I had enough for a pan of flour and a pan of corn tortillas. I topped both with homemade enchilada sauce, more cheddar and queso fresca. Simply wonderful with a tangy slaw on top. I can tell with the recipe would be just as good as written, it is very versatile.

These were awesome!!! My whole family loved them and asked for more. The only change I made was instead of brown rice I used quinoa. Delicious!

Very good and relatively easy.  I made some adjustments to handle little kid taste buds-- reduced the spices and added 1c corn to the mix. I used enchilada sauce on the side for the adults and just used cheese on the kid side in the baking dish.  A hit for the whole family.

Delicious.  Didn't change anything other than used white rice (that's what I had).  We are not vegetarians but I made this for a guest and we all enjoyed it.  Will make again.

Love them!  Although for my tender tastebuds it is a bit spicy.  I think I will reduce my crushed red pepper next time.  But, excellent flavor!  And I omit the green peppers and use Basmati rice.

Wonderful recipe. I did some tweaking with the filling. Didn't have a green pepper so I shredded a small zucchini, a bit of shredded carrot and 3 chopped mushrooms. Cut the rice back to 1 cup and lined the tortillas with fresh spinach before I filled and rolled them. Used canned enchilada sauce. Got rave reviews! It's a keeper. I love that you can vary the filling and it's still terrific.

Very Delicious. My entire family (7) unanimously named this a keeper. We did add 1 cup of corn as another person had suggested as well as only putting in 1 tsp of chili powder, but then adding 1 tsp of a Southwest Spice Blend that we had on hand. We cooked the rice in some chicken broth, which gave it extra flavor. It was a tad spicy, but not enough to be a problem for those of us with low heat tolerance. This was very tasty, though next time we add an extra cup of cheese and some additional diced tomatoes, I think.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used enchilada sauce instead of salsa to cover the filled and rolled tortillas, and it was excellent. Otherwise, the recipe makes an enchilada that is delicious and flavorful.

We really liked this!  I made it exactly as written with the exception that I added a can of enchilada sauce to the top prior to putting them in the oven.  It made 1 9x13 pan plus about 6 more in another pan!  I put the left overs in the freezer for another day.  Two thumbs up from my family.

These were enjoyable and healthy.  But, I have a seafood and spinach enchilada recipe that I frequently prepare which is much tastier.

Loved this!  Made it with quinoa instead of rice and topped with my favorite red enchilada sauce.  So good, made a double batch and it froze wonderfully.

So yummy! I used enchilada sauce, added jalapenos, left out the green pepper. The rice mixture could even be eaten on its own as a sort of jambalaya, I plan on doing this with the recipe in the future. Do take the advice of covering the dish for the majority of the time in oven.

Enchilada sauce on top, no rice. Used 1.5 cups of dried black beans for economy/health/flavor (no added salt and therefore no need to rinse, so you get more flavor). Fit about 1/3 cup filling in each one, then sprinkled cheese and wrapped it up. Yum!

We LOVED this recipe.  My daughter who is a vegetarian claimed that these were the best enchiladas she ever ate.  We made two batches, added chicken to one.  Because of the chicken, that batch made double than the recipe stated. Takes a little time to make, but well worth the effort.

Though this is a bit labor-intensive -- it's well worth it!  I used two (seeded) jalapeno peppers and only half the green pepper, just for a bit more 'spice.'  I was more generous with the cheese, using mild cheddar, probably over two cups finally.  I mixed cilantro in with the bean mixture, as it's one of my favorite flavors. Everyone loved the casserole -- our triplet teen vegetarians as well as my wife and me. Served it with sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.  Thanks, Di, and all who commented.

I held the red pepper flakes not wanting it to spicy. The picante sauce and green chile tomatoes provided enough heat. Substituted vegan cheddar instead of dairy cheese. In place of the salsa I used just enough mild red enchilada sauce to coat the tortillas in the baking dish. My wife and brother loved the enchiladas. I will make these again.

I didn't use salsa, red pepper flakes, green chiles or picante sauce (preference) I added sour cream on top along with diced tomatoes.

Very good recipe! The only thing is that it was pretty dry for my taste, I think in the future I'd add some type of sauce or maybe refried beans.

These were great! I poured canned enchilada sauce over everything before baking, and accidentally added the cheese as well, but they came out just fine. The were too spicy for my kids' tastes, but you could adjust them based on how much of the diced tomato/green chilis you add.

This was delicious though I did make a few substitutions: Red bell pepper instead of green. Half a tablespoon of onion powder instead of onion. Three quarters of a teaspoon of garlic powder instead of garlic. Taco sauce instead of picante sauce. I also omitted the red pepper flakes and used a full cup of cheese on top. My husband would like extra salsa  on top next time as well. In Canada our cans are in mL. I used 540 mL can of black bean and 540 mL can of Aylmer chili seasoned stewed tomatoes. I will definitely make this again.

we replaced the green bell with 4 large pasillas, chopped, a few big jalapeños, seeded and chopped, and used lots more onion and garlic for a heartier filling.  used a homemade salsa from my brother in TX!  skip the rotel, just use a can of mini diced tomatoes and some chile or spice that you like.  these would be good stacked, too, NM style.  and the filling would make a good taco salad.

Second time I made this I used pinto beans, enchilada sauce, Mexican cheese mix, added a can of green chillies and I think the flavors were much more authentic. I also used much more sauce than called for.

It was pretty good, but a little dark in taste. I used a salsa that was a little too spicy, so changes would start there. Also, it is a little heavy for our tastes,  so I won’t make it very often.

These were perfect! I used the local grocery store Giant Eagles Mexican style salsa, it added extra cilantro flavor since I didn’t have any fresh available. Leftovers only made it till breakfast, I can’t wait to make these again.

Awesome recipe for spices and the use of beans and rice. I added a pound of ground beef and chicken that I cooked in taco seasoning and fajita seasoning, respectively. I also used corn tortillas instead and layered this in a pie dish instead of rolls, then added a few cups of green enchilada sauce. Really, really yummy and everyone liked it with sour cream and cilantro!

This was my 2nd time making enchiladas, first time being with a skillet and a recipe using meat! This was a nice change and a new way to try and make enchiladas for me and keep them in a dinner rotation as well as making some good use of a couple of my pantry items!

I did not use oil in my cooking, I substituted with broth. I also did  not use red pepper flakes to keep the heat level low and also use less of chili powder. It's a great basic dish.

You can also use frozen black bean burgers from Walmart, Sam's, etc. to avoid buying everything separate.

I love this will definitely make it again! I love that there's bell pepper and cheese in there and it's not just rice and beans (even if it didn't say to add cheese, I would have). I didn't have red pepper flakes so I didn't add that and I used store-bought canned enchilada sauce - I followed the directions and spooned it over them but it wasn't enough. I will pour more over it next time I make them. Since there wasn't enough sauce, I add leftover picante sauce when I reheat them which is very good. They make a lot which is good for me because I cook for the week  and it lasted me all week.

I used basmati rice instead of brown rice but followed the rest of the recipe for the filling.  The recipe made enough filling for 10 enchiladas and leftovers.  I much prefer a regular enchilada sauce to salsa to using salsa so I user mild green chili sauce and extra cheese on top.   They were very good so we will be making them again as modified.

Excellent recipe. I used corn tortillas and also used Daiya cheddar cheese to keep it vegan. I used a mixture of left over enchilada sauce and salsa for the topping. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Thanks, very good. I will make this again for sure.

These are so good!   I used quinoa instead of rice and used corn tortillas instead of flour.  My last batch I used flour tortillas which were delicious and held together better but I wanted less calories this time.  I didn’t have a bell pepper so I substituted 2 jalapeños that I seeded and deveined.  This made it a little spicer.  I also added some sweet corn-about 3/4 cup and I left out the cheese because I am vegan.  I used red enchilada sauce instead of the salsa.  These came out delicious!  I thought I may miss the cheese(I’m a new vegan) but I did not!!  I know U made a lot of changes but I salute the original author.  I wouldn’t have these enchiladas had you not posted your original recipe

So good! I made with 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 quinoa for extra protein and added a diced jalapeno as we like spicy. I took others suggestion and added a can of corn and lined  tortillas with spinach for extra flavor and nutrients. It made a huge batch but I stuffed into 4 flour and 4 corn tortillas. I especially love adding the cheese to mixture before stuffing. It added an extra creaminess. Next time I want to try quesco fresco for even more creaminess. It is a hearty vegetarian/ lenten meal that all enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really flavorful. I did make a couple of changes though:
1) added some vegetarian stock to the rice to add a little more flavor to the rice
2) added mushrooms to offset the lack of meat
3) used large jalapeno tortillas cut in half to add a little more kick

Overall this was rated a keeper in the family!

Turned out fantastic! I used wheat wraps and wheat basamiti rice. I didn’t have an picante sauce so I used salsa and doubled the amount. Also I used vegan mozzarella instead of cheddar. We all loved it!  I somehow ended up with a lot of left over rice mixture. So I took corn tortillas and layered them with the rice and salsa like a lasagna. It also turned out fantastic! We loved it’ Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe has excellent flavor! I made it simpler by substituting jarred salsa verde  for the (green pepper, onion, garlic, tomato/green chilies) since all of the same ingredients are in the salsa verde. It saved prep time and added flavor. I also substituted canned corn for the rice  so mine were full of veggies. I would definitely make this again. I did have to cook mine  for an additional 20 minutes but it was totoally worth the wait. DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing!

Didn't make any changes but next time might use some enchilada sauce just to give it a little extra kick and found it a little dry and like enchiladas with a little more moisture. Also might add some olives only because I tend to add olives to all Mexican dishes. Was a hit just as written and will make it again.

I took out the oil, cilantro (forgot about it), and salsa. Instead of salsa, I used 1/2 C red enchilada sauce. I used Ole Mexican Tortiall wraps that were only 50 calories each and 4.5 oz of filling in each 8" tortilla wrap. I ended up with 12 enchiladas instead of just 8 bringing the calories per enchilada down to 174.

Very filling and tasty -- all with no meat in the recipe. Didn't have red pepper flake or chili powder so substituted 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Will definitley make again. Everybody loved it.

Love this recipe and have made it several times.  I make the following changes:  I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  I cut the amount of rice in half.  I puree a cup or more of mushrooms and put it in the mixture and I don't add the bell pepper only because my husband doesn't like peppers.

The flour tortillas get mushy, don't save well. I'd bake them without sauce first and add the salsa afterwards next time, though to be honest, there probably won't be a next time, they weren't bad per se, just nothin special.

Didn't have any red pepper flakes on hand, but it already had enough heat with the enchilada sauce I used.  I had to add quite a bit more of all the spices and salt and pepper to make it more flavorful. I paired it with a sweet onion salsa and that was a nice mix.

DELISH!! Definite make again. I only had small corn tortillas which don't enable rolling SO.. I layered them like a casserole dish instead.  Added the spinach as a layer as recommended by another reviewer and turned out great!

These came out really good. I used diced jalapeños instead of a bell pepper and enchilada sauce instead of the salsa and picante. I also put a Colby jack cheese stick in the tortilla before adding the rice/bean mixture. Thanks for the recipe:)

A bit spicy for my kids due to red pepper.  I will reduce next time.  Great way to use extra brown rice leftovers.  Substituted yellow pepper for green.  Good.

I was expecting to miss a traditional enchilada sauce, but the salsa/picante sauce (I used both for the topping) was a tasty change. Really good recipe!

Excellent!  Just put less pepper and added a chopped zuchini, and lots of mushrooms, since nightshade plants bother me!  I used a boxed rice mix due to time constraints, but next time would use brown. Yummm!!!!

The first time I made this recipe, I thought it was perfect, but it was too spicy for some family members; so the second time I made it, I decreased the chili powder and cumin by about half, and didn't add any red pepper. It was still delicious! I also used mild enchilada sauce in place of the picante and salsa. This is a great vegetarian recipe to add to our meal rotation, especially when we have leftover rice to use up.

This was not one of those recipes where one could cut the heat and not lose the flavor.  To meet my wife's heat sensitive taste preferences, I use diced tomatoes without the chiles and cut back on the chili powder.  Even though I used enchilada sauce (mild, of course) the resulting product was pretty boring.  Not the recipe's fault - I'd love to try the recipe as listed.  I bet it would be a great vegetarian addition to a week's menu.

These were excellent! I didn't have picante sauce so I just omitted it.  Everything else was made according to the recipe and then I added some chicken to this for the carnivores in my family and just didn't put any chicken pieces in my serving. It was a bit spicy for the wimps in my family so next time I won't add the red pepper  flakes  but this was super easy and really good. I recommend not leaving out the cilantro.

Very tasty!  I'm watching my cholesterol so I omitted the cheese and just added a can of creamed corn instead. I let the filling cook until more of the moisture was out so it had  a firm consistency before I spooned it into the tortillas.

So simple - everyone loved it. Says it serves 8 but I made it to serve 2 enchiladas to each person so it served four with left overs for lunch. Next time I might swap the rice to white beans to cut the carbs but the flavouring was awesome.

Just used more than 1/4 cup of shredded cheese to top the enchiladas at the end (closer to 1 cup). Be sure to finely chop the green bell peppers.

So good, will definitely make again!  Only thing I changed was used less hot sauce.  Great vegetarian recipe.
