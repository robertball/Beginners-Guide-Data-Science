Very good! I used fresh blueberries. So easy to make. I would recommend that you bake it at 375 instead of what's on the recipe. I tried it at 425 but it was browning to quickly. Reduced it to 375 for 18 minutes. I didn't have turbinado sugar so I sprinkled cinnamon on top after the egg wash. Turned out great.

Used Sweet Almond Flaky Pie Crust for the base, which worked well.  The crust was slightly sweet so the fact I didn't have turbinado sugar didn't mar the end product and almonds + cinnamon + blueberries?  Of course!  This recipe also came together really quickly.

Changes: I would be more generous with the cinnamon next time, which is on me.  Additionally, I had thawed my blueberries because I thought the frozen fruit would have too much water.  Finally, the cook time has to be reduced.  By 14 minutes my pies were starting to burn so I scooted them out of the oven way early.

Very good flavor, I only had one pie crust so I made 4 small from the exact recipe @ 375 for 12 mins.  Turned out great!  Great flavor and portion sizes, DELISH!
