I brought this salad to a party.  I used orange bell peppers instead of yellow and used the white and spinach tortellinis, which added beautiful color.  I also used sun-dried tomato vinaigrette (Kraft)as the dressing, which complemented the sun-dried tomatoes in the recipe and had more depth than regular Italian.  Everyone enjoyed it!

It was very good but I would wait to add the meat until you're ready to serve it...it get's a little soggy in the dressing.

This salad is so easy to make.  I made it for work today and shared some with a colleague - she loved it.  I found most of the items I needed at Trader Joe's.  It even tastes great warmed up.  Had leftover chicken from last night, chopped it up and added it to the pasta salad for dinner. Definately will be making this dish again.

Very good!  The one thing I'd change next time is I think I'll try with a mild salami, I think the prosciutto didn't hold up very well in the refrigeration.  Otherwise, it was great, and I will used it again

Took this salad on a picnic.  My friends loved it.
