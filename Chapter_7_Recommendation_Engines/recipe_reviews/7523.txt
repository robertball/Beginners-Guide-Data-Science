Tasted great!  We will definitely use this recipe again next Easter.  A few comments -

* After creaming the butter & sugar, I had trouble mixing in the water.  Maybe it should have been room temp water?  Maybe I should have added it more gradually?

* The dough is very stiff. "Folding" in the beaten egg whites was an amusing activity.

* I had extra batter.  Which was OK, since I baked that in a separate little pan & we got to sample that before Easter Dinner :-)

* I baked it for 45 minutes & even tho the toothpick came out clean, it was still raw in the center.  Next year we'll go for 60 minutes.

* To the JOSMITH - think of this as a pound cake. You need such a dense cake to show the details of the lamb from the mold.

The outside of the cake has the same consistency of waffles due to the egg whites.  It is a very heavy cake.  If the kids want to help ice it this would be the cake they wouldn't tear up.  However, it's not the one I would use for a wedding cake or an easter cake.
