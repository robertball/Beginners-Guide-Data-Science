I can't give this recipe a true rating as I didn't have the galangal, i didn't have shallots so I used an onion, used dried lemongrass (bad idea), I made it in the instant pot, and used more coconut milk than I was supposed (used a whole can). But what I can say is that the paste seemed really good, I had a good flavor. Unfortunately I made it super spicy. Hard to tell how spicy the hot peppers are when they are dried! But it's still eatable. My sauce didn't separate, so that's good. And since it's in the instant pot, I didn't take the time to cook it down to thicken the sauce. Anyways, I just thought I'd post a review in case someone else wants to make it without all the ingredients or the appropriate amount of time so you can cook it down and let the sauce thicken. I'll try it again sometime. Good Flavor!

The sauce ended up separating.  It tasted good, but wish I would have had sauce to go with the meat.
