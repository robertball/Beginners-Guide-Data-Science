This was incredibly tasty. Possible the best tenderloin I've had.

This was absolutely delicious!! Followed the recipe exactly and the coarse sea salt came off completely leaving it tender and perfectly seasoned. I am not sure what the other reviewer did that it wasn't good.

Ah-Mazing!!!  Will never need another recipe for beef tenderloin again.  Just perfect.  I had a 5lb tenderloin so doubled the “marinade”.  I didn’t want to smoke out the house so I skipped searing the meat and opted to cook at 475 for 10 min then lowered my oven to 325 for another 45 min.  Thermometer read 145 when I took it out.  Let meat test for 15 min.  The salt “crust” fell right off giving the meat delicious flavor.  The beef was so tender and juicy.  Perfectly pink.  Got rave reviews from guests.  Tasty as leftovers too!

Sorry, chef John, this was the saltiest meat its ever been my displeasure to eat. And I had to eat it, because it's tenderloin and it's expensive. Washed off and doused in a creamy (salt-free) gravy, it was edible, but it wasn't good. First bad experience I've really had with Food Wishes, but it really stings because of how expensive tenderloin is.

This was too salty for my family.  Also really watch the time while cooking, I almost ruined a very costly piece of beef by leaving it in the oven too long.  Hubby has high BP and said not to make this again.  Flavor was good, tho too salty.

The temp this guy said to do this dish at left my meat bloody. I'm sorry but I like cooked meat not raw so I looked it up and the serve safe national restaurant association says that the temp this recipe says to cook the meat to is a temp danger zone and bacteria growth is present it says between 41 and 135 is the zone. I also read for a medium well beef 145 is the temp it should be.

The family loved it... all 18 lbs were eaten at one sitting.  I followed the recipe to the T...  and cooked 25 mins. after I took it out of the oven to let it rest, I check the temp again, it only registered 120, I put it back in the 475 over for an additional 7-8 minutes, it was a perfect medium rare.
