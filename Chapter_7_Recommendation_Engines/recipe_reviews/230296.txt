Sorry, but this does not belong in the royal icing category.  It is a GLAZE.  A very good one...but an icing glaze.  And yes it hardens and is shiny, but it is not a royal icing.  It has a category of its own.  Also it doesn't dry and harden as quickly.  It's all I ever used to use....It tastes better than most royal icings and that is a plus.  But for fine detail that holds it shape better...the royal icing wins.  On taste...the glaze wins hands down.

I love that this recipe does not contain egg whites, so I feel better serving it to young kids.  I used it to decorate my gingerbread men; I simply scooped the icing into a decorating bag with a plain tip. You can easily change the consistency by adding a little more warm water (thinner) or a little more powdered sugar (thicker).  A little goes a long ways!  Quick and easy.

So easy to prepare, and came out perfect...I just made this and the icing is already setting up and hardening nicely.  i added orange extract to mine to go with chocolate angel cutouts...great recipe!

I used and really liked this recipe. I subbed 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract for the almond extract due to allergies and it turned out well

After trying two batches of the glaze that was suggested for the sugar cookies I made and have them both bomb, I'm so glad I found this recipe and tried it.  It was perfect!  Easy to make, easy to dip my camel shaped cookies into and get the icing where I wanted, and are now beginning to harden just like I wanted!!  Next time I'll try a different extract, but didn't want to deviate from the original recipe on my first go.  I live in the middle east and we are having U.S. military personnel over for Thanksgiving, these camel cookies are to go in the 'to-go' treat bags when they leave.

It worked perfectly for my chocolate sugar cookies! I added quite a bit more sugar to make it thicker & the color stand out more. I also used coconut extract (just cuz I love that stuff & it tastes great w/chocolate!) instead & it tastes great!! Good alternative when egg in icing kinda grosses you out & you don't have meringue powder! haha

I have been on the hunt for the perfect Royal Icing recipe and this is my winner!! It may not be a technical "royal" icing but it is the best I have ever used! All of the royal icing recipes I have tried either don't taste very good or they are hard- rock hard! Everyone said the cookies tasted as good as they looked! I had to add about 4 tbsp more water then this recipe called for but just add what you need!

Followed the recipe exactly, highly recommend! It dries to the touch rather quickly, so handling them is easier. Made valentine cookies with my 2 sons and they had a blast. This will be my go-to sugar cookie icing recipe. (I'm not sure it will hold gingerbread houses together, but perfect for sugar cookies.)  big success! Yay!

I could care less if this is scientifically classified as a glaze, royal or whatever, this was a great icing for cut out cookies!  It was a tiny bit thicker than I would have liked, so I added a touch of milk to get it to my liking :)  It hardened up nicely and had a really pretty shine to it, very nice!

The frosting was great!  You can easily adjust the thickness and choose the flavor.  The end result is a shiny, flavorful layer on top of your favorite cookie recipe.  Bonus!  No egg whites either dried or fresh so can be used for children and pregnant women.

It works and tastes great. Taste tons better than the "Original" Royal Icing recipes. My son is severely allergic to Raw Eggs. He is ok as long as the egg is baked in a baked good but any form of raw egg whether pasteurized, dehydrated, etc. Will cause a severe reaction. This recipe is Perfect for everything we wanted to do with our sugar cookies.  God Bless you for sharing this life saver recipe.

Sure the icing is glossy and hardens nice but what does it taste like? IThe icing tasted like soap with the almond extract. It was way too overpowering and I followed the recipe exactly only adding more powered sugar to thicken it. Won't do that again. Back to the tried and true Royal Icing.

I really like this recipe. I use lemon extract and the flavor is great.  I'm just wondering if anybody has tried freezing the cookies after using this icing. Does it change the flavor?

I make this icing every year at Christmas time for my children and I to decorate the gingerbread ornaments we make. I LOVE how it doesn't have egg in and it tastes great. It dries hard like royal icing as well.

I used this recipe to decorate Easter cookies and they turned out well. The original recipe was quite thick and perfect for edging, I did thin it for filling the cookies, everything turned out well I would use this again.

I made this icing with a few changes 
Add half tablespoon more of corn syrup 
Heat CS and water on stove just until bubbles appear . Transfer to stand mixer Nd mix on high for 1 min add PS and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice 
Mix in high for 4 mins.
Turned out great drying time is a little longer but 
Was very shiny alone or airbrushed

This was a very nice icing. It might not be a true "Royal" frosting, but it was a fabulous egg-free option that worked nicely for our gingerbread houses. It hardened quickly and adhered well. I'll definitely use this recipe again for cookies and next year's gingerbread house.

In order to make it a bit easier to put on my bear claws I just held my kitchen aid bowl over the gas stove to make it more liquidy.  I didn't want to add more water because I wanted to be sure it set hard.

This recipe is wonderful! The corn syrup makes for a pliable frosting, easy to flood - or, with a little more sugar, easy to pipe. I also appreciatiate the ability to change flavorings. This one’s a keeper!

This glossy royal icing is great. After making the complete batch I removed 6 tablespoons to use as my flood icing then added 1/3 of a cup more powdered sugar to  what was left in my mixing bowl to make it a bit thicker to use for my piping. It turned out absolutely perfect.

This is my first time making a royal icing.  I saw a friend's sugar cookie icing and it was so shiny and pretty!  I normally make a vanilla buttercream, but   my girls' and I were making gingerbread cookies and knew I had to find a recipe and I chose this one.  I have found that this is much easier to work with for cookie decorating (why haven't I found this and figure this out sooner)!   I flavored the icing with clear vanilla, so the white stays white.  After tasting the icing, I was worried that it was too plain (once again, I love a rich buttercream icing), but I carried on.  What I love about this icing is that no matter how you spread it ( uneven like), it smooths out perfectly!  I found that if the consistency is off, you can always add more water or powdered sugar to correct it!  I also found  that if you make this thicker to use for piping, this is the best way to put the icing on!  I started with a knife at first (it was fine, but the edges were messy).  I am sure most of you know that already!   My girls loved decorating with this icing and said it was a lot easier for them to use!  

When it comes to taste, like I mentioned before, I thought it may be too plain.  However, with gingerbread cookies, this icing tastes amazing!  I was surprised!  I am not sure this particular recipe would complement the sugar cookies, but I will definitely use it and update this post (if I can remember)!

I used this to frost gingerbread cookies, and it worked perfectly! I used orange extract instead of almond. I used a combination of gel and water-based food colorings to make red, yellow, and black. I made the base frosting thicker so I could pipe on my edges first, then added water by 1/4 tsp at a time until it was thin enough to fill in.

It hardened nicely, tasted great, and looks beautiful! It added just the right amount of sweetness to my cookies. I had never even decorated cookies before, but this worked easily enough that my co-workers have been raving about them. One is even thinking about hiring me to make another batch for her grandson's birthday!

This is an icing that is great for cookies as it flows. Tasted good too!  However, I wanted it for cupcakes so I added 1/2 cup of confectioners to it and then sprinkled water as mixing until the right consistency.  As it is, it flows off the cupcakes and is somewhat thin.

Made as stated in recipe and my Easter egg cookies came out beautifully. Really like the shine it leaves and you don't break your teeth biting into the cookies

Loved the high gloss of this icing. It dried well too. After trying many recipes, this one is the keeper.

This icing is a bit more difficult to work with than the traditional royal icing as it's slightly more gooey but it leaves the beautiful shine that I have been trying to get for my cookies.  It dries just as hard so the cookies can be packed in cellophane bags without any damage.  Tastes just like the royal icing as well with the proper added extract.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Worked beautifully and stayed glossy like stated.  It took gel coloring well also.  I put it into a squeeze bottle and let my kids go to town making free form stars to decorate our Dallas Cowboy cupcakes!  I will use this recipe again!

Great icing that I have made before, but this is NOT royal icing, which contains egg whites to produce a harder set.  Again, there is nothing wrong with this icing, but this is a misleading recipe, especially if people are specifically looking for royal icing, which this is not.

This is an excellent glossy royal icing. It took a little while to dry since we live in a humid area, but it looked amazing on our Christmas cookies. It had a nice shine to it.

Dries fast and tasted fine.  I used maple extract on gingerbread cookies.  I had to experiment to get the thickness just right to pipe but it all went well once I figured it out.

I added some lemon zest to a vanilla extract base and liked it. I have not tried with the almond yet as my friends had allergies to almonds
It is good though, if you take too long, it forms a "skin" on the icing but stir a little and it will work again. We just dipped the front of the cookies in it and it fills it itself while resting. Will use again on my sugar cookies.

I made this but it was really thick and hard to work with. I made it to decorate sugar cookies. It was my first time making cookies and royal icing. So maybe its supposed to be this thick.  I ended up adding water so I could decorate the cookies. I followed the directions except I only had vanilla extract so I used it instead of what the recipe called for. It tasted ok just like sugar.

This recipe does not produce the effect as the photos show. I followed the recipe and found it to be very thin in coverage and not opaque on gingerbread. I added additional conf. sugar and food coloring but couldn’t get the opaque coverage shown in the pictures linked to this recipe.

No changes  - excellent recipe - but I wish there were weight measurements instead of volume, as a tiny difference in the water to powdered sugar ratio  can easily throw this recipe off.

I tried this recipe because of the good ratings but this is a glaze, not icing. I needed to make decorations with it and it was too clear and runny, I even tried adding more powdered sugar and that didn't work. If you need a glaze, this is the go to recipe. For decorating, the original royal icing recipe wins.

Worst glaze/icing I've ever tried. I followed the directions exactly. However, even following the directions exactly as described in the instructions, the glaze/icing was way too runny and I ended up having to use a lot of powdered/confectioners sugar to thicken it up to a decent consitancy to make the border around my cookies. Even before thickend the glaze I did a trial cookie and the icing was too runny and on top of that even when it dried.....it was NOT glossy at all. It still had a matte finish. I will not be using this recipe again

I gave this 5 stars for the ease of preparation and the nice glossy finish. Taste is closer to a 4. I probably will try a different flavoring next time; this batch I used Butter Rum. The orange would probably taste better. It does harden quickly so work fast! Cookies come out so pretty and professional looking. This took a gel coloring very well and just a drop of blue made a pretty light blue snowflake cookie

I love the glossy finish. I doubled the extract.  It tasted too much like "powdered sugar" to me. I didn't finish it, so it is in the fridge as directed. We shall see how it works tomorrow.

Worked great for what I needed, but I did have to add almost an extra cup of powdered sugar to get it thick enough.

I used this recipe to ice puppy cookies for my daughter.  Beautiful result! Made as written I dipped the cookies for a lovely, smooth base. Then I added cocoa powder to what was left which thickened it to a perfect consistency for outlining and details. Both versions look fantastic and are ridiculously tasty! Thank you!

As someone else pointed out, this is more of a glaze than royal icing. It tastes delicious but even with added confectioner's sugar it was too thin.

Does what it's supposed to do, although as someone else already said, it's not icing but a glaze.
