The potato, onion, poblano chiles mixture is absolutely delicious. I did season it with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Being of Mexican heritage, I can say that I didn't really care for it in my tacos and it's not something I grew up eating. I will make the potato mixture again but as a side dish, not in my tacos.

I doubled the amount of steak and grilled it.  I  felt like the dish could have used more seasoning, maybe some cumin, red pepper flakes or something, but overall like the concept of including potatoes.   I would make this dish again, experimenting with additional spices.

Fantastic! We will definitely make again. There's a lot of heat in the recipe, so I think next time I'd use some cold salsa or sour cream. Will just cool off the bites a bit. Otherwise excellent.

We enjoyed these, but I felt like there was something missing. Not sure what the something is, but something.
I really enjoyed the potato/onion/pepper combo (which I seasoned with salt & pepper) and I think it would also make a really great side dish for Mexican-inspired meals. 
For the steak, I added some cumin and instead of using chili powder I used ground chipotle chili peppers. This gave it a great flavor and a little heat. After rubbing the seasonings onto the steak I lightly brushed both sides with olive oil and cooked it to medium on the grill.

This turned out pretty good and was easy to prepare. I think it could have used a tad more seasoning. Maybe some cumin? I really enjoyed the potatoes being inside the taco and this is one I will do again.
