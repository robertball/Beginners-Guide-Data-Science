Scrumptous!!!  I fixed this as a sheet cake for lack of round cake pans of the correct dimensions.  It was extremely moist & delicious.  My husband & I finished the entire cake in less than a week!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it!  I left out the walnuts and added more pineapple and brown sugar to the upside down layer and it turned out delicious, the cinnamon adds a unique flavor to the pineapple and brown sugar.

I used pecans instead of walnuts and pineapple cake mix...using 1 cup buttermilk, 4 eggs, and 1/4 cup canola oil (that makes cake mixes taste more home-made). I put the pineapple (whick was pineapple chunks) mix in the bottom of a bundt pan and cooked it for 1 hour. It got great reviews!

Very moist. I used a bundt pan & used a 15oz can of pineapple.  Next time I'm going to try 1 tsp of cinnamon because we couldn't taste it.

Everyone loved this in my house.  My 18 month old wanted "More!".  I didn't have a yellow cake mix so I used lemon.  I also was out of crushed pineapple so I made the brown sugar mix, spread it over the pans and layed down pineapple rings with maraschino cherries.  Delicious!

This is the best pineapple cake ever! I can't tell you how many I made and handed out as gifts. To "kick it up a notch" I added orange marmalade to the cake batter. It gives it a zing.

My family enjoyed this cake and it was sooo simple to make.  I made it exactly as directed except I added water to the pineapple juice to make 1 1/3 cups.  It also took alot longer to bake than 25 minutes.  The box said 35 minutes but I even baked it a few minutes longer than that.

I have been craving pineapple cake for a while. I pretty much kept to the recipe, except i used pecans instead of walnuts. Also,I was short on pineapple juice so I added a touch of light rum instead of water. It was incredible.

This was good, but I did use a 20 can of pineapple and adjusted accordingly.  I didn't care for the cinnamon, so next time I will leave it out.

Great cake - I am not usually a cake mix lover, but had one on hand. I used a 9 x 13 cake pan, and used a 20 ounce can of pineapple rings (because that is what I had in my pantry!) - will try as written next time - easy, delicious & fast. Best eaten warm right from the oven (gets a bit soggy by the next day).

I made it exactly as directed.  It would be better with more of the pineapple brown sugar mixture at the bottom as that was the best part.  It was a very refreshing cake - better than something out of a box but not as good as I expected.  It took much longer to bake than in the recipe so maybe mine was a bit more dry because of this.  I added a cool whip/vanilla pudding/pineapple mixture of icing and put it on top of the cake which made it even nicer.

This came out perfect, with the recommended modifications of the reviewers. I used 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 20 oz. can of pineapple. I melted the butter and put 2 T. in each pan, then sprinkled with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, the nuts, and the pineapple. That worked really well, and it didn't stick to the pans at all. We ate only  one layer - I sent DH to work with the other cake! It does take significantly longer to bake than the stated 25 minutes - I stopped timing, but would guess 35 to 40 minutes - and my oven is slightly fast.

Just took this out of the oven and couldn't wait for it to completely cook to have a taste.  Very good!  I made it in a bundt pan, using a large can of crushed pineapple for the topping and also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the cake batter.

Delicious! Not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. I used the crushed pineapple in the natural juices rather than the sweetened syrup, and it was plenty sweet, and really moist too. Easy to put together as well.

Wonderful!  Instead of a layer cake, I made this in a tube cake pan.  I used 2 cans (8 oz) crushed pineapple and pecans instead of walnuts.  It took a little longer to bake, but well worth the wait.  I took this cake to work and everyone loved it.

EXCELLENT! My husband, 20 mo old son and I have literally eaten almost the entire cake in 3 days! I did make a mistake by not reading the recipe correctly and accidentally added the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon mixture to cake mixture.  I just remade it and threw it together anyway. It was soooooo good and sooooo moist. I doubt you'd need to do what I did for it to be really moist.. but I would recommend adding the cinnamon and maybe a little brown sugar to the cake mix though.

Spectacular! Hot, out of the oven, the topping made me moan.  I'm glad I doubled the cinnamon and although the cake itself is deliciously perfect, there was only a slight hint of pineapple.  I made a pineapple filling to take it over the top.

Must have been good- was gone before I ever got a piece!  Didn't look too pretty though, the sides came off in my pan.  Next time I would make it in a bundt pan for sure.

Good, light, fluffy cake that comes together with very little effort. I have made this twice now. Once with yellow cake mix and again last night with a vanilla cake mix. I really don't think there is a substantial difference and either could be used. None of my guys noticed a difference and they all commented (again) on how much they enjoyed the cake.

The pineapple juice made a little over 1/4 cup liquid, use water to make 1 1/4 liquid total. Put in sheet pan. Made good coffee cake for morning.

I had to have done something wrong because I was so excited by the reviews.  I swear I followed the directions but it just tastes like a regular cake to me.  Maybe I overcooked it?  It's not particularly moist for me (but not dry, either).  I sooo wanted to like it!

Best pineapple upside down cake ever! Made this cake couple times already and it's alway gone while it is still warm. I used to make pineapple upside cake w/ pineapple rings, which everyone took off and only ate the cake.  Not the case with this one.  It is now my family's favorite pineapple upside down cake.  Like others I added 1tsp cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe.

So I totally screwed this up through noone's fault but my own and I still give this 5 stars. So here is how I screwed it up...I mixed the creamed mixture with the cake mix mixture- don't ask what I was thinking. I realized it after the fact but I still baked it in a 13x9 for 35 minutes and it was still awesome. The only "topping" I had was cool whip- oops! This cake even messed up was delicious and moist. I can't wait to make it the right way but love it this way too and so easy...
Thanks for sharing.

This was yummy! I changed a few things though. I used a pineapple supreme cake mix and tripled the topping, baked the cake in a 9 x 13" pan (which took longer to cook...so extended baking time). Will definitly make again and again and again!!!!

This is an awesome cake! I had to improvise on the brown sugar...didn't realize I was about out, till I had the cake started. I used some Gold'n turbinado sugar, mixed with about 2/3 C brown sugar, and 1/4 C corn syrup. I omitted the nuts, used 16 oz crushed pineapple, and doubled the cinnamon. I baked the cake in a 9 x 13 pan.  We have company coming over, and I can't keep my hubby out of the cake! Can't wait to serve it! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! A VERY moist cake. 

I had trouble squeezing the required 1 1/4 cup of pineapple juice from even a 20oz can of crushed pineapple and had to crack open a 20oz can of chunks to make it. So have an extra can of pineapple juice on hand. 

I also did as other recommended and added 1 tspn cinnamon instead of 1/2. 

Lastly, I made this in a 12 inch flat non-stick pan and had to cook it some 40-45 minutes.

We loved this cake. I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix and followed the suggestion of PPK and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. The is the first time I've put cinnamon in a pineapple upside-down cake, and I love it. My Mom, who is recovering from surgery, ate with gusto for the first time tonight and declared it the best pineapple upside-down cake ever. Thanks for a delicious & easy recipe, Jodie.

Recipe was super easy. I had high expectations for this recipe given the rave reviews, but I was pretty disappointed. I didn't care for the nuts (which overwhelmed the flavor of the topping) or the cinnamon. I even doubled the pineapple as reviews suggested. The topping was my least favorite part, and I am a pineapple lover. I think I will stick to traditional pineapple upside down cake.

I was trying to figure out what to do with a yellow cake mix and a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple sitting in my pantry, and I came across this recipe. The changes I made were to substitute 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil called for on the box and add 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt. The large can of pineapple yielded right at one cup of juice. I used all the pineapple and mixed it with the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon, which I increased to 1 tsp. I used a 9x13 pan and this turned out very good. I did have to increase the bake time to about 45 minutes...cake was light and moist and the pineapple layer was perfect. Great recipe!!

This is the first pineapple cake I ever made.  I had a special request for a pineapple cake, and the person who received it was thrilled.  They said it was the best pineapple cake ever! I made two of them, on for me and one for the person requesting the cake.  The first cake I put in a bundt pan and it turned out beautiful.  The second I put in a spring form pan.  I dont know what I was thinking... do not try this in a spring form pan.  The cake was not cooked through at the center and was gooey, but it was still delicious~

I used a bundt cake pan, and doubled the pineapple topping. It was good, but not "great". I'll try again and make some changes. I believe it'd be better as a sheet cake, and with some additional pineapple flavoring in the cake mix itself. The topping was excellent.

This was awesome when it came right out of oven- but seemed a little dry the next day!  Next time, I think I will add more water to batter to closer match amount required on box!

This recipe turned out great! I read all the reviews first and did a little tweeking of my own. Also a very pretty cake. I used an angel food tube pan so when i turnned it out the bottom of pan stayed on and let cool like that then decorated top with a few cherries and sprinkled powdered sugar. I used the pillsbury butter yellow mix, also added some extra pineapple used a bit of apple juice when not enough left from can. Also used real butter, it was a little crumbly when still warm but next day is perfect!!  Great Recipe thank you much!  Dawn

This was OK.  I used a lemon pudding cake mix but cooked it in a round spring form pan.  Had to cook it a little longer to get done in the middle.

Pretty good for such a simple cake. I made it with pineapple rings so that it look prettier. But I find the creamed butter and brown sugar hard to spread. Might try to melt it and pour in on next time.

awesome!  my 7 year old son made this and it was super tasty.  he used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 butter in the cake mix recipe (it called for 1 stick of butter).  the coconut oil really keeps the cake moist.  also, we had no brown sugar so we used white sugar and added a bit of molasses.  yum!!!

I followed the recipe as closely as possible given the ingredients that I had on hand. I used french vanilla cake mix and had to omit the nuts (kids are allergic). To replace the nuts, I used some shredded coconut. I had to open a can of pineapple chunks to get enough juice for the cake mix, but I did use crushed pineapple for the cake. I wish that the cake itself was a bit more pineappley...maybe next time I'll use a pineapple cake mix or stir some of the crushed pineapple into it. It was very simple to make, and tasted good.

This recipie certainly lives up to all the positive reviews.  I made this as written except I also had a hard time getting enough liquid from a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple. (I only got about a 1/3 cup) I had a jar of canned peaches in the fridge so I supplemented 2/3 cup liquid with that.  I also used a 9x13 pan instead of two cake pans, but had no trouble flipping it out at the end. So very, very delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This is delicious.  I used three 8 ounce cans of crushed pineapple in order to get enough liquid, and also doubled the cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.  Since I used the extra can of pineapple, I could have used more butter and brown sugar in the topping, but it was still fine without.

This was fantastic! So moist! I made the recipe as directed, omitting the nuts. I mixed up a pineapple sauce to use as a glaze and it was so good.

My husband was needing something sweet after dinner, so I gave him a can  of pineapple and a yellow cake mix and sent him to Allrecipes. He came back with this recipe. It is awesome! We are coconut lovers so after we flipped the cakes we drizzled it with a coconut glaze. It also freezes well making it great to have on hand for unexpected company or sweet cravings.

This is a great recipe.  I used the Butter Recipe cake mix, a little extra pineapple and doubled the cinnamon and it was fantastic!
