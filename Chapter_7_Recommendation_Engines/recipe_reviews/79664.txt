Let me just say I dont EVER rate recipes on here.. usually for fear of offending someone. With that said, this is absolutely a wonderful recipe! The thing is folks, it tastes just exactly like a bbq chicken pizza, and said pizzas have chicken, red onion, cilantro & cheese. If you don't like bbq chicken pizza its no surprise that you wouldnt like this. I just think it kind of defeats the purpose of making a recipe called "BBQ Chicken Calzones" and then give it a bad rating because you dont like an ingredient. Anyway, thats my two cents. It really is a fool-proof recipe. Thanks!

UPDATE: Since initially trying this, I have made it many, many times.  I use the WalMart Brand Pizza Dough mix you add water too and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, I also add some chopped onion before baking, I really think that the cilantro adds an extra dimension to the calzone and shouldn't be omitted (unless of course you don't like it).  I have also brushed the crust with butter spread before baking with excellent results.  This is an AR fave.6/17/2007:These are delicious and so easy.  I made "minis" for a bridal shower and everyone raved.  The beauty of this recipe is you can you use whatever ingredients you like (try turkey kielbasa with green peppers, onions, pizza sauce, and fresh basil); the one suggestion I would make is to saute garlic in a pan and brush over calzones before baking, I have also found the cooking time to be a little excessive.

Quite good.  I did, however, make some changes myself.  I used chicken breasts which I had previously grilled to make it a bit healthier.  When cooking the onions I also added fresh garlic b/c my husband enjoys garlic in just about everything.  I didn't measure the bbq sauce I just used it to the consistency that I liked.  Also, I used canned crescent rolls to make the pockets b/c we enjoy anything made out of crescent rolls and I had some in the fridge.  Additionally, it takes away a few more calories if you use the low fat crescent rolls, which we did.  They were great!

This recipe is delicious!  I used Kraft's "Brown Sugar" BBQ sauce for a little bit of sweetness and they turned out perfect.  These are a new family favourite.  One word of caution - frequently check them while in the oven as the cooking time may vary with the pizza dough you use. I used the Pillsbury pizza dough and I had it in the oven for 17 minutes and they almost burned ... but they were still fantastic!

Quite good.  Quick and easy recipe which gets my vote every time when you have hungry guys clamoring to be fed!  I upped the barbeque sauce and substituted caramelized onions as that's all I had on hand.  Very similar to Texas Chicken Quesadillas also on this site.  Thanks so much Tummy13.

Delicious! Even better with olive oil drizzle and Parmesan cheese sprinkled on the crust before baking.

Surprisingly delicious! I skipped the cilantro, and used way more barbecue sauce. I wish I'd added more bacon too. Husband wolfed it down, and said he especially enjoyed the crust. He said he'd love to try it with a pepperoni and pizza sauce filling. I made calzones like that before, but with my own pastry crust. They turned out rock hard, and I was really disappointed. I'll definitely be experimenting! Thanks!

Amazing! Great great flavor. Just like the BBQ Chicken Aussie Pies I used to buy from the market. This one goes in the recipe box! Next time I'll try turkey bacon for a lower fat version.

Awesome! The only thing was, it seemed like a bit too much filling for the calzones, so I ended up using only about 3 quarters of it. But, the extra filling was really yummy just to eat by itself.

I did not use any cilantro, just because I don't really like it. Overall, really really yummy, and pretty easy to make. Next time I'll use my own crust though, rather than store bought.

This was GREAT!!!!  I went with others ideas of using more bbq sauce and bacon.  I used the 2/3 cup bbq sauce just in mixing the meat together.  Then I poured 1/4 cup bbq sauce over the mixture before folding over the pizza crust.  It was perfect.  I also used 7 pieces on bacon.  Other than those changes.  It was great.

I have fixed this twice. It is easy and tastes wonderful. The second time, I Ieft out the bacon. It was still a huge hit. Both times I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. My family loved it!

This recipe is Fan Freakin Tastic!!! I'm not a fan of cilantro so I let that go.  As per other peoples suggestions I eyeballed the amount of BBQ sauce and added extra bacon.  I went to a local pizzeria and bought pizza dough and let me tell you, it was $2.50 for alot of dough and it was sooooo good, so go to your local pizzeria, i'm sure they sell dough and its worth it, trust me!!  I melt some garlic and butter and brushed the tops and added some Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese and when it was almost done I brushed the tops with egg and it came out perfectly!!  TRY THIS RECIPE!!.  I tried to add a picture, but I keep getting an error, I wish I could show you, I was so proud of myself and my husband loved them.

This was GREAT! I don't even like BBQ. I ended up making way too much meat mixture so we saved it and used it to make BBQ sandwiches the next night, and loaded baked potatoes the night after. It was flat awesome. Really, the kids are asking for it already and this was just a day ago!

The family loved this. I used chicken diced in small pieces instead of the shredded chicken, a cheddar mix, and refrigerated crescent rolls in place of the pizza dough because that is what I had on hand. Just rolled them out and cut in half. Baked at 325 for 25-30 min. Easy and delicious!

DELICOUS!!!! Used red onion in the mix, which I ran through the food processor so that my older daughter did not complain that the recipe had onions.  She never knew. :) Also ran the chicken through the food processor as well. Rolled out 2 pizza crust doughs and was able to make 8 individual calzones. Omitted Cilantro.

My hubby loves the BBQ chicken pizza from Papa John's so we wanted to give this a try and it was so good! We used all of the ingredients in the recipe but changed them up a bit based on our personal preferences. For example, we definitely used more bacon, bbq sauce and cheese. We also added grilled diced pineapples and we used a rotisserie chicken.

This is awesome to say the least. Add a little more sauce to the meat mixture for the best chicken sloppy joes you will ever eat. Make calzones or sloppy joes, it is great either way. Thanks!

Awesome recipe! I used Bone Suckin' BBQ sauce (sometimes hot, sometimes original) and Kraft Shredded Mozzarella with a touch of Philly for that extra creamy and cheesy factor. Will definately make over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these for my boyfriend and his friend to take camping but once I tasted one I ended up keeping some for myself ... too bad my mom found them because I only got one! I didn't use bacon or cilantro because bacon was too much work and cilantro isn't something we like. I cooked the chicken and then broke it up into pieces with my hands but not all the way shredded. I fried the onion with garlic powder and some other spices then turned the heat to low and added the chicken and BBQ sauce mixing until well combined and warmed throughout. I used two things of pizza crust and cut each into four. Before putting them into the oven I brushed them with a mix of melted butter and garlic powder. The boys said they were delicious and super handy to walk around with. Mom said they were sweet and tangy almost like dessert. *Make sure your crust is super cold or it gets extremely hard to work with.

I used a casserole blend of shredded cheese and didn't have cilantro, but they still turned out tasty. I saw these over at Life as a Lofthouse cooking blog and knew I had to try them!! Turned out tasty! I boiled a split chicken breast with seasonings then shredded it for these.

I made two variations of this. One calzone without cheese, since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant. It tastes great without the cheese; you taste the bbq a lot more. For the other calzone, I cut up slices of montery and colby jack cheese and it's a great alternative to the mozzarella. Kraft's bbq sauce tastes great for this!

Awesome!!!  Only change was to omit the onion because my kids don't really like them.  These were so easy to make, using the already made pizza crust.  The bacon adds a nice flavor along with the cilantro.  I will use this recipe over and over!

I used my own crust recipe instead of a pre-made one.  I also didn't measure anything and just dumped it all together.  They were terrific!

We are not a fan of this at all....but it may have had more to do with the pizza dough than anything.  We used Pillsbury pizza dough....and in the end it was a huge pain in the butt to work with.  I rolled out the pizza dough and placed the ingredients on top but unfortunately, some of the other ingredients were still a bit warm (we grilled the chicken) and this essentially melted the pizza dough making it really difficult to work with.  We carmelized our onions and did not use any cilantro as DH and I both dislike it.  We will not try this dish again, we'll just stick with our standard BBQ chicken pizza.

AWESOME LOVED THESE.  Doubled the recipe. Cooked my chicken in the crockpot with a bit of BBQ sauce and boullion. Used the thin style dough. Made as written and used my own BBQ sauce. Awesome.  YUM.

My entire family loved these. I didn't use extra bbq sauce in the calzones - just mixed some in (unmeasured) w/ my cooked chicken till it looked right. Hubby said they tasted like a good bbq chicken sandwich on crunchy bread. Will definitely make again!

Made only a few minor changes, based on personal preferences: Left out cilantro, halved the amount of cheese & added about 1/3C more bbq sauce.  Also, the crust was done perfectly after 16 minutes...I think 25 min would have been way too long.

Dipped them in ranch dressing and Oh. My. Goodness. Absolutely amazing! My husband and I loved them; I'm betting you will, too!

Loved this. Threw in a little more bacon and used homemade pizza dough and instead of putting cheese inside, I put it on top. Made 4 small ones instead of two large, will definitely make these again.

These were very good but I didn't have fresh cilantro and that may have made the difference between 4 and 5 stars (not the submitters fault of course!). I found I needed extra BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's of course) as the crust was a little bready for my tastes. I had leftover filling and it was great by itself! Thanks!!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I can appreciate it for what it is but I didn't like the tastes.  Maybe a different bbq sauce would make it better. (shrugs) I'll try it again, w/out cilantro and w/better bbq sauce.... and maybe w/out the bacon, too.  haha.

Wasn't crazy about them at first, but I think it was my fault: didn't put in enough cilantro or BBQ sauce or cheese or something. I added a little more and they were pretty darn tasty.  These heated up really well the next day.

Great great recipe! Made these for my daughter's 3rd birthday for all the extended family. They were devoured, even my picky Father-In-Law went back for thirds. I followed the recipe, except I cooked my chichen in the bbq sauce in my crockpot and then shredded it in my food processor. I will be making them again for a girls night next month. I just picked up some pre made dough at a local pizza place as well. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious!!  My family loved it and it was so quick and easy.  This is a definite keeper.  I made one minor recipe adjustment. Because slow cookers generate a lot of juice, I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of a 28 oz can because I didn't want it to be watery.  It was perfect!!

This was great! Everyone in my family loved it. Rather than use refrigerated pizza dough, I made the Bread machine pizza dough from this site and it was delicious. I also used a rotessire chicken from the store and added it to the crockpot with the other ingredients. I added the bacon right before I assembled the calzones and put them in the oven. They turned out so good.

This was my first attempt at homemade calzones and they were excellent! I followed the recipe as written for the BBQ chicken filling and used homemeade pizza dough instead of store-bought. Turned out great. The filling was flavorful and delicous. Hubby gives it 5 stars and I agree with him. Thanks for a fun, yummy recipe.

LOVED this!  My husband and 4 kids loved this.  The only things I did differently were to leave out the cilantro and I added 1/4 pound smoked kilbasa.  Going to use leftover meat mixture on tortillas for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving this four stars only because of how many things I changed.  I used leftover grilled chicken thighs, green onion instead of white, and omitted the cilantro.  I also added mushrooms, red bell pepper, fresh tomatoes, and made my own pizza crust (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site).  This was absolutely delicious and I will definately make it again, but I will definately keep my modifications.

Kids actually ate this without complaint.  Used pillsbury thin pizza crust, which turned brown fast therefore decrease time.  And maybe try putting some butter on it towards the end next time.  Didn't use the cilantro, but it would be great for Craig and me.
-start at 10 minutes less time and check on it

I made this almost exactly as written (just added more bacon and more barbecue sauce based on other reviews).  It was easy to put together and was very good.  I wasn't sure about the cilantro, even though I love cilantro, but it really does add something to the dish.  Unless you absolutely hate cilantro, don't leave it out.

Amazing!  I made my own dough, added a little more BBQ until I thought the texture was right, brushed olive oil and garlic on the bread before baking, and loved the way the bacon, onion, and cilantro made this dish perfect!  All four of my kids LOVED it.  Great for adults and children.  Will definitely make again!

These were very good, but a little lacking in flavor.  I put in more barbeque sauce than was called for, but still could have used something.  I also only cooked for 20 minutes and they were perfectly done.  Next time I think that I will try a different combo of ingredients - chicken, bacon ranch sounds like it would taste good this way.

i used 7 slices turnkey bacon instead of regular bacon and it still turned out great. before baking, i combined olive oil with garlic powder and brushed it over the tops, sprinkled on some parmesean cheese and parsley.  i'm excited to play with this recipe as it is extremely versatile such as chicken alfredo or making a meat lovers one!

This is seriously delicious! My husband said it is his new favorite and I should open a restaurant with it. Anyway, I followed the recipe, but I drained half of the bacon grease before I added the chicken. Also, I added a bit more BBQ sauce than called for. Really good - thank you!

When I pulled my calzones out of the oven, my mom was very impressed.  They were very pretty to look at.  My mother and boyfriend both complemented me and how good they were, but for me, they were a little too tangy.  I think next time, I may usea little less bbq sauce.

No need for adding sauce in calzone. Chicken has enough. Will add more cheese next time. Sour cream went perfect with this!

Great recipe. I substituted shallots for the onion and pancetta for the bacon only because that is what I had on hand. So good...even as leftovers the next day.

This was really good - not the most amazing thing, but good.  I bought thin crust pizza dough and wasn't paying attention to it but just baked it for the 25 minutes it said, and it burned a little, so just keep that in mind if you are using a thin crust.  I also added some fire roasted red pepper.  That addition made it a whole lot better!

Yummy!!  I did three chicken breast cooked all day on low in the crock pot with Hunt's Hickory and Brown Sugar barbque sauce.  I followed the rest of the directions with a few slight modifications: cooked the bacon and removed from pan, then the onion (I used red onion) in the bacon fat (drained a little out before adding onion).  I then added it all back into the pan including my shredded chicken.  After all the ingredients were combined I added it back to the crock pot and waited for dinner time.  Easy Peasy!!

I must say this was very tasty! 

On a different note, a few tips from my experience. The 3 cups shredded chicken is in my opinion too much. Even with the value sized 13.3oz canned pizza crust, it was still difficult to fit all of the chicken mixture into the calzones. I can't imagine using the recommended 10oz can.  I'd scale it back to 2 cups shredded chicken.

Also, if I make this recipe again, I would probably forgo the calzone casing altogether and use flour tortilla shells instead. The pizza crust just didn't add enough to the dish to justify extending cook time by 20 mins to let it bake when this would be just as delicious wrapped up in a warm tortilla.

Quick and simple.  It was a great way to use up leftover poultry.  We didn't add any fresh cilantro since we didn't have any on hand, and it wasn't missed.

this was delicious! 
we made our dough in the bread maker and added some extra bits to the filling (we added two fresh sliced tomatoes and some strips of bell pepper to the chicken, bacon and onion)
also we made two large calzones instead of 4 small. 
this is now a huge family favourite! thank you.

These were excellent - I followed the recipe closely, using crescent rolls for the dough. it was a little tough getting the dough rolled out and sealed after filling them but it did work out - i worried they would be too flimsy after they cooked but they worked out great and had good flavor. The guys really liked them, we'll have these again!

My husband loved these. I did add in some chopped green and yellow pepper b/c I had it leftover from making salad last night and wanted to go ahead and use it. I also mixed the cilantro in and added some chopped turkey pepperoni and minced garlic. I just eyeballed the bbq sauce b/c I wasn't sure my husband would be crazy about these so I didn't want to overdo the bbq. I also brushed the tops with some egg before I put them in the oven so they would brown nicely. They looked wonderful and my husband said they were delicious. He doesn't like pineapple but I do so next time I think I'll throw some pineapple in my calzone.

Good and easy.  I like that it uses refrigerated dough.  I was able to make it after work in about 10 minutes.  I used canned chicken and it was good.

This was OKAY but was a lot of work! Cooking the chicken and the bacon took some time. I guess I had such high hopes for this and was SO excited because these ingredients sounded awesome together. But I wasn't that impressed. I love cilantro but don't know that it belonged here. Don't think I'll be making again.

I made my own pizza dough from a favorite recipe. I added to the BBQ sauce some brown sugar, spicy mustard, garlic powder, salt and some pepper. I used a lot more BBQ sauce and cheese so the inside would not be so dry. After removing from the oven I brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. I didn't have cilantro so I left it out, I believe it would add to the flavor but still excellent with out. Great recipe with the additions my kids and husband loved them. This would even be delish as a pizza and would be much less work.

Delicious!  This recipe was easy to make but a bit labor intensive. It took me twice as long (if not more) to make than the time called for.  I used more bacon than called for just because I had it. I also added mushrooms, a couple cloves of garlic, and went ahead and used the whole small onion. Really delicious!

I made this recipe 2 nights ago and it got rave reviews from my fiance.  I used Pillsbury Pizza crust and I noted from others reviewers to watch the cooking time.  Mine were done after 17 minutes baked at 400.  I followed the recipe except I used onion soup mix instead of an onion and I added banana pepper rings and a few dashes of Franks Red Hot because we are both big fans of spicy.  The only thing I would change for next time is the way I shredded my chicken breasts.  I did it in my food processor and I think next time I will manually shred it to get a more uneven consistency.  The processor shredded it a bit too much for me.  But it was still very tasty and paired with a ceasar salad, it was great.  Thanks!

I did not use the refridgerator dough as I think it is like eating a piece of bread which isn't exactly what I am going for when making pizza...I used the "Real Italian Calzone" recipe for the dough.  I definitely recommend using all the ingredients listed especially the cilantro! It really brings out the flavors! I used marble cheese with mine and added some seasoning to the dough. You definitely need some garlic action in this as the crust can taste a bit floury without seasoning!  I also took someones tip and slowcooked my  chicken in chicken broth to make it super tender before using.

Used rotisserie chicken to make this a super quick weeknight dinner.  Makes a lot of filling.  I recommend using two tubes of dough.  Delicious.

I have been trying to clean out my freezer, and when I noted I had some leftover rotisserie chicken and a loaf of frozen bread dough, I started thinking about what I could do with it.  This recipe pretty much filled the bill and I had all the other necessary ingredients.  I thought the calzones were pretty good and my husband enjoyed them.

Love this recipe!  I omitted the cilantro and bacon because I simply didn't have those items on hand.  Otherwise loved this recipe, only change I would make is to add a bit more cheese-we love cheese in our family!  Great recipe.

These were great!!  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and added more than the recipe called for!  Other than that, no changes. So simple and very yummy!

My husband LOVES this and brags to everyone how great it is.  I just use the crumbled bacon I get in the purple bag (they are NOT the bacon bits).  Super easy and really good.

Was pretty good! I learned the hard way howevwe that with the pizza dough, NEVER take a piece of it out, (even if its dirty), cause when you open it all the way up, there's was a big hole in it.
Thats just so u know, other that that I think next time I will stick more with the actual recipe, and use mozarella chese.

Not a real fan of this one...it was OK, but I think it would have been better with tomato sauce instead of the barbeque sauce.

This was easy and delicious.  I did add more bbq sauce than the recipe called for though.  I'm not sure how much more, just enough so that the chicken looked covered enough.  I used dried cilantro instead of fresh, and you couldn't taste it at all.  Definitely use fresh if you like it.  Also, I forgot to add the cheese before I folded the dough over.........so I just added it on top of each calzone.  It still tasted great, and looked better than it would have otherwise I think.  Keep an eye on the baking time too, since it seems to depend on the dough you use.

This was very good.  It will be a nice filling dinner on a cold winter day.  I added some fresh garlic with the onion.  The only thing was since I used chicken breasts that I had to shred I found that the prep time took longer than 20 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!! I made smaller "hand-held" calzones to serve, and they were great.  I accidentally forgot to include cheese in half of them (OOPS!!) but they still turned out fantastic. Super simple, tasty recipe.

Simple to make and great flavor. Everyone in our family loved it! I added garlic as I do to about every dish.  I saw one review where they used crescent rolls instead of pizza dough. I think I will try those as well just because we really like the crust from them. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner. It was good, but dry and not as flavorful (shockingly) as I had hoped. 25 minutes almost burned the calzones. In the future, I will add more BBQ sauce and bacon. The crust (Pillsbury pizza dough) wasn't great either, so I'll go with another brand. First attempts aren't always great, but I would definitely make this again with a few alterations.

Needed more cheese. Felt like it was lacking something else as well, but I'm not sure what. Definitely do not try to make this with canned chicken breast or it will come out very dry.

The taste was great, but it is not "easy to make" by any means. Unless you pre-cook the chicken and the bacon, this takes time and effort next to the stove! And bacon is not something easy to make with little ones at your feet! I would make again but plan for it to take some time for prep!

Fixed exactly as shown.  My family gobbled them up but later commented that there was too much BBQ sauce.  Other than that, great, easy recipe.

My family LOVED IT! I did make it with teriyaki sause instead of BBQ, I think you can stuff it with pretty much any filling you have left over or just be creative.

Quick,easy and delicious! I grilled the chicken, microwaved the bacon ( 8pc) bacon and used EVOO intead of bacon fat to cook the onion ( plus minced garlic) then I brushed a little melted butter on the shell.

I used crescent roll dough and had a hard time getting it shaped right. It stuck to the card board and the end of it was dark. I never buy crescent roll dough. Next time I will use the pizza dough or make dough from scratch. I used bacon but will leave it out next time. These tasted great. My dh liked the crescent crust.

These were delicious!  I used about 1/4 cup more BBQ sauce (Famous Dave's Sweet & Tangy).  I used a Pillsbury Thin & Crispy Crust.  I cut my dough into four individual pieces.  Mine were done at 20 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe can be kindof intense if you don't buy pre-cooked chicken. I made it as a pizza with the Jiffy Pizza dough {2 boxes} and it was a HIT in my house. Despite all the work, I'll probably make this a lot more! Thanks!!!

I would give this between 4 and 5 stars. My husband ended up making the meal and he didn't measure the cheese so I can't say for sure, but would use more cheese next time or measure it to 1 cup. We cooked up cubed chicken and used 2 cups. Definitely could feed 6 if you add a salad and fruit. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

We loved this! Instead of cutting the dough in half, I cut it into four sections which made perfect leftovers for lunch. (You can also adjust each pockets ingredients this way for those picky eaters) I didn't have bacon, but I will absolutely make this again adding it...and maybe even some cracked red pepper. This is a perfect alternative to the basic bbq chicken pizza.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because I had to add to and change the recipe. First, I had no idea how much chicken is 3 cups. I used 4 chicken breasts hoping to double this recipe (which it did). I felt the recipe needed some added flavor. I used 1 cup of bbq sauce and 1/4 cup of ranch dressing. Instead of Cilantro, I added 2 tsp of Italian seasonings. After rolling out dough I did not understand why the recipe wasn't written for the dough to be split into 4, so you could actually have 4 individual servings. So, that is what I did. Worked perfectly! I sprinkled dough with onion and garlic powder before I cut it for some extra flavor. This ended up having a wonderful flavor! You could play with the ingredients and make a large variety of different calzones.

I love a good BBQ Chicken Pizza, you can't go wrong with this recipe for the calzone version. I put two chicken breasts basted with BBQ sauce in the slow cooker with a can of low sodium chicken broth and about a cup of bbq sauce floating in the broth. When it was time to eat I carmalized about half a large red onion, thinly sliced in a Tbs of olive oil and shredded the chicken -- so moist and shreddable out of the cooker, then put it all together. I didn't have mozz on hand, so I used Colby-Jack, which I thought went better anyway. Yummm.

This was really good and pretty simple. I used whole chicken breasts-cooked and then diced in my veggie dicer-and we also used turkey bacon. We didn't have any "bacon grease" thankfully, since we wanted to keep this on the healthier side. I would absolutely make it again =)

These were great!  My only advice is to not cook the calzone for as long as it says (25 minutes), because the bottom almost burnt.

Delicious!  I used Cheddar Cheese and everthing was fine.  On the top, I put a dollop of sour cream and drizzled some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce = attractive!  I used Pillsbury's Pizza Dough and was not impressed.  Would not used this pizza dough again ... needs more research and can only be less cost!

This was amazing!  Please do not use store-bought pizza dough.  I used the California Pizza Kitchen dough recipe. Everyone raved.  Don't be shy with the bacon or the red onions.  Cook on a pizza stone if you have one.  I doubled it and gave one to my neighbors.  You will make friends with this one!

Pretty good recipe here!  Very easy to make and has GREAT flavor.  I used turkey bacon (about 6 slices) and fat free shredded cheddar cheese and Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  I will probably add some garlic powder to the dough next time for some extra flavor though.

Yummy! Loved the blend of flavors--the bacon is awesome in this. I used a 6-Italian cheese blend. I found them a little drier on the inside than I would've liked, but I didn't want to overdo the BBQ sauce. Next time, I will do a combo of tomato sauce and BBQ sauce - mainly using BBQ, and just a touch of tomato sauce. We found they tasted GREAT if you dunk them in ranch dressing. YUM!!

My boys loved, loved this!  A little too sweet for me so next time I won't use honey BBQ sauce.  I also stuffed in some gargonzola cheese.  Yummmmm.  So easy to put together, very filling and quite economic!  We'll definitely use this one again!

As a newly married girl who has little skill in the kitchen,  I searched this recipe out for my husband who loves BBQ Chicken Pizza.  He absolutely loves this and asks me to make it weekly.  He's bragged enough that I've fixed them for his family too and everyone can't seem to get enough.

This is a very yummy Calzone.  I took 4  individual packaged chicken breast and diced them up into pieces.  Fried them in extra virgin olive oil added crispy bacon and then my sauce and simmered until the meat was tender.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce, but I added 2 table spoons of Apple cider vinegar for some extra zest and tang.  I added whole kernal corn to my meat and sauce mixture at the end and let it cool down first.  For my dough I made my own from scratch.  There are a million pizza dough from scratch recipes but I used this one...http://www.greatpartyrecipes.com/pizzadoughrecipes.html

To my dough I added italian, oregano, cilantro, and cajun pepper seasons, and olive oil.  I let it sit for 30 minutes.  After I rolled my dough out I coated it with butter.  
It cooked for approx 15 minutes at 395 degress. 
 
OMG it was the best ever! The homemade dough is extra work but it is well worth it! So soft, so yummy, so good!

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site. I had trouble getting all of the filling to stay in and I even had a little more dough then it called for. The trouble was well worth the finished product. I will definitely be making this again!

We didn't have cilantro so we just did without.  We made the dough from scratch (using Ricardo's Pizza Crust on this site) and it was a great flavor combination.  My husband and I along with our two dinner guests really enjoyed this dish!

Very easy and good. I've made bbq chicken this way before but with no bacon and it was chicken thighs and it was very good. I didn't make calzones though, I had no pizza dough. I had whole wheat pitas though, so I stuffed the chicken in them! VERY TASTY!

I did not like this recipe. Although edible, it really ended up tasting like bread with BBQ sauce on it. I couldn't taste the onions and chicken at all, despite adding more onions than recommended. I did not use bacon in this recipe, and added dried instead of fresh cilantro. Used with Jay's Signature pizza crust recipe from this site. Will not make again. I do have a suggestion for cooking the chicken (I've done this before when I made regular BBQ chicken pizzas and it turned out well)- cook your chicken in the slow cooker all day with a can of chicken stock, and then shred it when you're ready to cook your pizza- that really brings out the chicken flavor.

This was wonderful tasting! I am a new cook to this site, i am doing one meal a week for this site, for my parents when they get home from work. I did mostly everything right on this recipe... The dough was overdone a little though. This thing should strongly suggest to watch it, and when it is brown to take it out, but thats me! anyway, it was DELICIOUS!

This was wonderful! I had to quadrupal the recipe in order to feed my large family, but now I have a ton leftover! I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site instead of refrigerated. I have a lot of leftovers! The whole family loved this and it will become a regular in our house! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, not outstanding for us.  Made 6 smaller ones rather than large ones.  Might try again and chunk the chicken instead of shredding it.

This recipe is fantastic! I made 4 calzones instead of 2 but they were still tasty. I also made a different version with ground sausage and cream cheese that was great too. Thanks!

It was good.  but felt they would have make small rather-doughy calzones.  So instead we made pizzas out of htem.  They were really good!

Wow! Great recipe!  The only change I would make is next time, I'll brush some garlic/parmesean mix over the dough before cooking, but that would be the ultimate!  Can't wait to make it again.

These were pretty good for a change from pizza, and relatively easy to make.  I added green peppers for an extra veggie.  I had enough dough to stretch it thin and form kind of a pocket that I crimped the edges to keep it shut.

These were so delicious and extremely easy to make. We thought the mozzarella would be a bit bland so we did a 3 cheese mix with colby, montery jack, and cheddar. The cilantro was amazingly good on it, I added extra. I also poached my chicken in the morning and then put it in the slow cooker for about 3 hours with a 1/2cup water, 1/2 cup ketchup, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a pinch of ground black pepper. It was outstanding!!

Not your typical calzone which is why I liked it so much. Different taste sensation for sure. I drained off most of the bacon fat before adding the chicken and did not use the cilantro. We don't like it and I didn't feel the flavors would have gone together anyway. Nice change Tummy and thanks!

this is so simple to make, and tastes great.  I used Honey BBQ suace which gave it a sweet/spicy taste.  Left the onions out, and It was awesome!!  The kids and hubby loved it!  Next time going to experiement with different cheeses.

I added slightly more chicken and cheese to this recipe to make the calzones bigger. I would say the bigger calzones serve approximately six people!! My husband is a firefighter with a huge appetite (he normally goes back for 2nd or 3rd helpings), and he barely ate half of a calzone. We both loved them!

These were very good.  Don't forget to allow time to cook and shred the chicken when figuring out total prep time.  My husband and I both thought they tasted better the next day cold.  It only took about 15 minutes to turn golden brown, so watch the time carefully.  Next time I will use more bbq sauce.

This recipe made excellent bbq chicken. My only recommendation would be to roll the pizza crust a little thinner so the edges of the calzone aren't so thick. Great taste.

Wow, was this filling!  We ate 1/2 the calzone and everyone was stuffed, including my two teenage boys!  We like our food a little spicy (well, okay, more than a little spicey); so, next time, I'm going to put in more BBQ sauce.  We will definitely have this one again!

Maybe it was just the crust I bought, but I only needed about 12 minutes for it to become nice and golden brown. Good thing I was keeping an eye on it. I don't like bacon, so I skipped all the steps involved there, and instead cooked the chicken in olive oil and then shredded it. I added a bit extra cheese, but forgot the cilantro. It was still very tasty, but I think next time I would take other's suggestions to use green onions.

Amazing!  My family wanted to eat only this for 3 days!  I could not make it as fast as they were eating it.  When I ran out of chicken I made it with ground turkey.  They loved that just as much!

It was good however I'm not a big fan of chicken and BBQ on pizza. My son loved and it was the first time I attempted calzone.

The taste was great, easy to make and pretty quick. I just had the pizza crust a bit to thick and i dont like the taste of cilantro so i left that out.

This was simple and delicious.  My kids loved it.  I made as recipe states.  Next time I will use Pillsbury crescents in hopes the crust will be a little lighter.

who knew it could be so easy to make tasty calzones?  I used rotisserie chicken breast from Costco.  Both picky husband and I liked them a lot, and he's not a big BBQ fan.  Will definitely make this again as written and will try different combinations.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is super easy to make and pretty good. It depends on what BBQ sauce you use. It also needs more cheese. Thanks.

Easy and delicious. I made mine into 4 smaller calzones instead of two big ones - but then we each at two because they were so delicious! My only complaint is that I should have drained a little of the bacon grease off - the extra grease made it a little hard to get the dough to stick together.

Excellent easy recipe! I used ready made pizza crust in the tube and was able to make 4 nice size calzones! Used bottled barbeque sauce with lots of cheese. Going to try using my homemade pizza dough next.

Very good! I didn't separate the BBQ sauce, just mixing all in at once, but don't know why that would change anything. Thanks for the recipe, we'll have this again soon!

I did like this alot.  I marinated the chicken in a barbeque marinade before mixing with everything else.  There was something missing, but I'm not sure what.

Delicious!  Let me just start off by saying that I love barbeque with anything so I'm a little biased.  (Not too much though.  I know good food when I eat it.)  Some changes I made, I added most of the barbeque with the onion and chicken.  I think it is less messy and retains more flavor that way.  I also added 4 chopped garlic coves along with the onions to add more flavor.  My only trouble was getting the pizza dough to completely wrap around the chicken.  I ended up using toothpicks to hold it all together in the oven.  I ended up with a lot more chicken than dough so the tasty chicken will be saved for something else tonight!

They were a little dry, sadly, and there wasn't enough dough. Might recommend using pizza dough or something along those lines.

I'm not sure I cared for this much....Made exactly as written. I seem to be in the minority on this recipe, so I'm sure it's just my personal preferences.  DH liked it but wasn't impressed and munchkin ate some of it.

Great meal when your low on time. This recipe is one of my husband's favorites. I recommend using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and leave out the cilantro.

amazing recipe! i actually didn't use the bacon, because we just didn't have it, and it was still really good. also, i sealed up one of the calzones, forgetting to put the extra sauce, cheese, and cilantro. and that was the one calzone that my sister said was amazing.

I liked this recipe but wasn't the best to me. I didn't make any changes except I didn't use the cilantro because I forgot to buy it at the store. The crust was cooked too long since I just followed the directions and didn't check on them (I understand that is my fault). I would think that a homemade pizza dough would be better tasting here.

These were delicious!!! The only changes I made were that I didn't use cilantro I don't care for it. I also used real pizza dough instead of the pilsbury pizza dough I don't care for that too much either. The only thing I would change is that I think red onions would go much better than regular ones but even still it was delicious!!!

I just found this a couple days ago and made it for dinner.  I have already shared the recipe with some neighbors and can't wait to make it again.  I was so simple and quick.  I did use crescent dough instead, and made individual smaller pockets.  I also used Colby Jack cheese which was a nice substitute since I didn't have any Mozzarella on hand.  My husband took the leftover chicken the next day in a Pita for his lunch and said it was just as good on day 2!

I made this as a pizza, rather than individual calzones. I used homemade pizza dough and bbq sauce. Will make it again. A unique taste that my family really liked.

Yes! This recipe agrees with me and I with it! Opted not to fry chicken in bacon grease (George Foreman grill was ready & willing for that task), but this does not mean I didn't use bacon. Oh, heavens no, used extra bacon, in fact! Mixed all the BBQ sauce with the chickeny-bacony bliss at once (no drizzling) and used the herb-ified Ricardo's Pizza Crust for the dough. Easy to over-indulge on these Calzones! mmm...

these are a common item for dinner when we are busy. i halved the onion (neither are onion people). and they are really large so i put extra bbq sauce and cheese on about 5 minutes before they are finished as they are too large to pick up. i also use thin crust.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have made this several times as calzoness, and a few times as a pizza.  The only caution I would give for this recipe is - be careful what type of BBQ sauce you use!  My favorite BBQ sauce is Bulls Eye, but it's too overpowering for a recipe like this where you want all of the flavors to compliment each other.  I think I used Kraft Honey BBQ or something of that sort and it's always delicious!  I always get rave reviews when I make these!  Make them with a rice dish (like fried rice or Rice a roni and a salad.

This was really really tasty.  My boyfriend likes spicy so for his I used Dave's Devil Spit sauce and subbed jalepinos for the onions.  He loved it!  I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ for mine, it's my favorite BBQ sauce!  They were quick to make too so their perfect for a weeknight meal.

Tried this recipe out because I had frozen dough in the freezer and a lot of left over chicken from a roaster I made the night before.  The only change I made was that I used cheddar cheese.  It was perfect, and my 7 year old loved it.  Thanks, I will add this one to the rotation!

My husband wanted chicken alfredo calzone so I used this recipe replacing the bbq sauce with alfredo sauce.  I also sauted minced garlic and broccoli with the red onion. 
Thanks for the idea.

wow--quick and easy....my kids loved it. I cubed and broiled chicken breasts on my lunch hour after tossing with a bit of olive oil and onion powder. I substituted Canadian Bacon which I slightly pan cooked and layed it on the dough before piling on shredded chicken and sauted onions mixed with BBQ sauce--and then added a heaping handful of shredded mozzerella  (Also left out the cilantro cause I'm just not a fan).  I am not the world's greatest or most motivated cook so a quick and easy recipe like this is perfect for me.  Thanks!

This is one of my boyfriend and my favorite recipes.  The choice of BBQ sauce really defines the taste so make sure you choose one that you love!  We like Sweet Baby Rays.  I also add more bacon than the recipe calls for because otherwise I couldn't even tell it was in there.

Great recipe. I've never had BBQ chxn pizza, but I figured how can you not like it. I used frozen bread dough, as I do with all my calzones (that way I didn't have to go to the store, too), made the recipe as stated execpt I brushed the dough with an egg white/water wash. Very good, definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

AMAZING! My BF said it was one of the best dinners I ever made. The bacon makes it. We bought pizza dough from our favorite pizza place and I measured out 10 oz. and rolled it. I bought a honey rotisserie chicken and pulled it apart. I only used half the cheese. I think with my leftover ingredients tomorrow I'll make small handheld pockets. The filling would be great on small toasts for hors'dourves, too. Thank you Tummy13 for this recipe!

I REALLY liked the filling of these (I used the bread part of the "Real Italian Calzones" which was great).   I used one HUGE chicken breast and added a bit more bbq sauce into the mix (Sweet Baby Ray's) along with some garlic.  I didn't have cilantro but didn't miss it.  Really good!

The whole family raved about this one! I made my own pizza dough. I didn't have quite enough chicken and didn't have any bacon, so I added some diced up turkey pastrami. I didn't have any cilantro and I chose to mix all of the BBQ sauce into the chicken mixture. This recipe is really adaptable- I love it. There's no doubt that I'll make this again!!

We liked the filling but just didn't enjoy it in the pizza crust. I think this would work out quite nicely as a topping for a pizza.

I didn't love this calzone, I think that it wasn't the best choice of toppings for a calzone.  I think that a traditional pizza topping would be better for your taste buds.

i used left over fajita guts so i included some bell peppers as well. i also didn't have any bacon on hand but i did use some ground sausage instead. i put it all together then added some chopped garlic and then added the sauce and topped it with cheddar as that was all i had. the cilantro came from my garden. my boyfriend took one bite and was like "I feel like we are eating something from a restaurant" now he wants it to be a weekly thing!

This was pretty good!  My husband, an avowed BBQ hater, raved.  I did find them to be a little on the dry side, so I think next time I'll use more sauce and a little more cheese.  I ended up making 4 individual calzones.  **OK, update!  This recipe is so versatile.  I recently made the calzones using leftover shredded cranberry pork roast and brie cheese.  It was scrumptious.

Yummy and easy - family said it was great!  Used calzone dough from Real Italian Calzone recipe.  I didn't measure, just used enough sauce to make a "goop" that wasn't too thick.  I added some sauteed zucchini to get some extra veggies.

These were pretty tasty, but it felt like they were missing something.  Maybe a little more spice to it?  Or perhaps a stronger cheese like colby or monterey?  Overall, I thought it was great though.

YUMMMMMMMMY!  I made this for my family tonight and it was loved by all!  I used homemade dough and BBQ sauce (I try to use as little jarred/canned foods as possible).  I also used Monterey Jack cheese because I thought it would be more complimentary than mozzarella...

The calzones were awesome!  Thank you for sharing!

The only thing that I would change the next time that I make these is that I would leave out the bacon. The bacon was too overpowering in flavor, besides that a very good and very easy to make.

These were between a 3 and a 4. I think I used more cheese perhaps. I think if I made it the way it said it would have come out better. Liked it with the cilantro. Possibly make again. Dipped in a combo of BBQ sauce and blue cheese dressing.

My family can't stop talking about these!  My picky eater gobbled it up.  I always use my own pizza dough when the recipe calls for a store-bought dough.  I added extra sauce with the chicken and on top.  Prefect!

I thought this was average...did what other users suggested- added extra bacon, cheese and bbq sauce.  Easy to prepare.  I like the concept and will probably make again..but will play with the ingredients.

These were pretty good, but something was a little off to me.  Maybe it was the combination of cilantro and bbq sauce.  Maybe I didn't use the right bbq sauce. We all enjoyed it, but I am not sure if it was enough to make it again. Thanks.

This recipe is awsome! What a great way to use up leftover chicken. Very filling too. I didn't have the exact ingrediants, so I am looking forward to making it again when I have "All the Right Stuff"!

It was average.  I made it exactly as posted.  Not bad, but not more than 3 stars.  Don't think I'd make again but like I said it was average.

These were great.  I used a simple calzone dough recipe that I had lying around and stuffed it as indicated in this recipe.  They came out great--I had people drooling over the leftovers at work!

I liked this recipe.  It was a good change.  I'm not a big cilantro fan, so next time, I'd probably leave it out or reduce it.  I'd also use bread dough (I use Rich's brand in the freezer section) rolled out instead of the refrigerated pizza crust.  Those are never any good.  But overall, pretty good.  I'd make it again.

I actually couldn't find the can of pizza crust in the store, so I wound up making these ingredients (minus the cilantro) into a pizza!  It had an amazing flavor, and my boyfriend made me promise to make it again!

We thought this was good, nothing to write home about, but will make again from time to time.  Depending on your appetites, 1/2 a calzone might not be enough (DH had a whole one by himself, but I struggled to eat a half).  We don't care for cilantro much, so just left it out.  Overall, pretty good, would recommend.

This recipe was tasty - very easy to make and the chicken and bacon and cheese tasted great together!  The only thing I did not care for was the canned pizza crust - it tastes too much like bread, and not enough like pizza dough.
