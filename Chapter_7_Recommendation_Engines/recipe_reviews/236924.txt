I am a die hard Manwich user.Until I made this! I did change a few things like I added 1 TBS minced garlic, 1 TBS chili powder (or more to taste), tsp liquid smoke and 1/2 c water, left out the brown sugar. I’m a convert! We like it less sweet and more spicy. I don’t think I’ll be buying Manwich any more.

I left out the light syrup. It was sweet enough. Great for kids.

WAY to sweet for us.  Right idea but just too sweet.
