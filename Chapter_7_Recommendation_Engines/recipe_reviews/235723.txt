I added some white rice, minced onion, extra cheese, and replaced the garlic powder with garlic salt, and that seemed to keep them from being bland, like other reviewers had mentioned. My husband loved them!

What a great side for dinner these were!  I pulsed the broccoli in a food processor before mixing with other ingredients.  They are a little bland by themselves but PERFECT with a dipping sauce.  YUM!!

Served with ranch as they were a little bland. But, the kids loved them!  May use seasoned bread crumbs next time.

I started making these for my baby when he transitioned from purees and demanded finger foods to feed himself.  I make up a batch at least once a month. They're so good I usually eat a serving myself before I even batch them up!  Such a fun side dish for dinners too. You've got your veggie, grain, dairy, and protein all in one little nugget! Love!!

We liked these but tweaked the recipe a bit. We used half cheddar and half freshly grated asiago cheese. They were tasty! The asiago added some complexity to the nuggets. I would definitely use asiago again.

I followed the recipe, but put the broccoli through the food processor for a few seconds and used seasoned bread crumbs. They were so good, my toddlers loved them.  Great recipe.

These are bland, even with substituting garlic salt for garlic powder. However, they have a nice consistency, and my daughter seems to be enjoying them. I served with Siracha/sour cream dip. I might try them again, but experiment with the cheeses added and also add quinoa for a little protein.
