Hi! I'm Polish and this is really spelled "paczki," which means "little packages" in Polish. The way you have it spelled is kind of the way it's pronounced. It's great to see your recipe up here. It's different from mine. You use raisins, which is more common in "babka." Glad you're carrying on the tradition! Thanks.

I also know these as "paczki", not "ponczki". I also know that they are usually filled with a prune filling (traditionally) and they don't usually have raisins directly in the dough. So instead of raisins, I chopped up prunes and added them to the dough; and I also filled some of them with a prune filling I made--a kind of compromise lol. I also used rapid rise yeast instead of a compressed yeast cake (it is difficult for me to find that here). I made the yeast sponge by warming the milk with a little bit of sugar in the microwave until it was warm to the touch. Added in the yeast and flour and let it sit for a bit. Then I creamed together the egg yolks, egg, and sugar in a separate bowl until pale yellow and the sugar had dissolved. Then I mixed in the melted butter, vanilla, orange zest, salt, and prunes to the egg mixture. Also 1/2 cup of orange zest would be way too much--only use a tablespoon or two at most. Then added in the yeast sponge, and the rest of the flour, and followed through with the rising of the dough. It is a sticky dough, but you should still be able to form it into a ball. I also patted the dough out to about 1/2" thick, and cut out rounds using a 3 inch round cookie cutter before frying. Make sure that your paczki's are no more than a 1/2" thick or they will not cook all the way in the center (I had that issue with a few). I also baked a few in the oven at 350 for about 25-30 minutes, and they are ridiculously flaky! Overall, very good doughnuts! Thank
