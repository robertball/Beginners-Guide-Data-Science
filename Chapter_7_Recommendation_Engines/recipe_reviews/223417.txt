This is a very easy & tasty chowder. I used extra large shrimp & pollock for the white fish. Instead of adding water I substituted sodium reduced chicken broth. The chowder is so chunky you don't need to thicken it, if at all. Great job Maddie

I used this recipe as inspiration for my own version, and it was delicious! I had some tilapia that I wanted to use up so I just made up the portions as I went and used veggies I had on hand, and it was delicious. I used some heavy whipping cream instead of coconut, added extra onion powder, garlic, ranch seasoning and some salt and pepper. Made some cornbread to go with, perfect for a dreary January!
