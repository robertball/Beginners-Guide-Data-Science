This was really good!  Don't make the mistake of caramelizing the onions in a separate pan. Use the same pan as the soup so you can get as much of the flavor as possible. Once the onions are done, add the rest of the ingredients as stated.  I thought there was a little to much broth. Next time I will reduce broth to 6 cups. This will be the chicken soup recipe I use from now on.

This soup is surprisingly good! It is simple and good.  I did change a couple things, I didn't use the carrots or celery and added a little soy sauce to the broth.  It turned out great. Taste was similar to wonton soup.

We enjoyed this recipe modified to make it thicker & more stew-like, using only 4 cups chicken broth, about double the chicken meat, no carrots, crushed garlic & 1 cup uncooked quinoa instead of pasta.  I also used the same pot for cooking the onions & then adding the other ingredients.

Very good soup!  The caramalized onions make all the difference.  I did cook the onions first in the stock pot I cooked the rest of the soup to get all the onion flavor and added a bit of poultry seasoning.  I used 1/2 regular chicken broth and 1/2 low sodium broth.  Very good simple yummy soup.

This is so good, I cook it the first time it gets cold. The carmelized onions are the key and the best. Since I have made it several times, I also did the onions overnight (or day) in the crockpot method and it was even better if that was possible. I highly recommend this one!

It is TRULY cold here in the tri-state area and wanted to make chicken soup.  Made this one and was disappointed - the soup definitely tasted like Onion soup and maybe I should not have been surprised since it said Carmelized Onion.  I would only make this again if I had a desire for Onion soup - I was looking to taste chicken soup with a mild onion flavor.

This is a really nice soup. It's not extraordinary, but it's just a really good soup with nice flavor. I would defintely make it again. My husband (who claims he doesn't like soup), finished off the leftovers the next day.

This is my new chicken noodle soup recipe. I used mini-bow-ties, so I had to use 3 cups of pasta and the full 8 cups of reduced-sodium broth. Took the advice of adding sugar to caramelize the onions - really good. It's also good with a few shakes of Sazon seasoning right in your bowl.

Yum!! This is a great soup...quick and easy too! I opted for the 6 cups of broth and it seemed just right, and I caramelized the onions in the same saucepan. All the other ingredients I kept the same except I used Rotini pasta. Will definitely make again!

Just another dish too high in sodium. Use reduce sodium broth to bring it down a bit.

This soup was very easy to make and was probably one of THE best tasting soups I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying!  The carmelized onions are really the key to it.

This was such an amazingly easy and super tasty recipe! We added lemon pepper instead of the black pepper and a bit of garlic; it was perfect!!! Definitely will be keeping this as a go-to meal in our house!

After reading a handful of other reviews/suggestions, I made the following changes to make it a little more flavorful:
-6 cups broth instead of 8
-Prepared the onions in the same dutch oven that I used to cook the rest of the soup to have the added flavors
-Added a 1/4 tsp parsley and 1/8 tsp garlic powder

It was *delicious*! I have never written a review before, but this recipes is so simple and customizable, I just had to respond. Perfect for a fall afternoon!

As others stated, this is just another chicken soup recipe.  I was hoping for something that tasted more like a cross between chicken soup & French onion soup, but - no such luck.  We couldn't really even tell that it had the carmelized onions in it!  Not worth the extra step, IMHO.
