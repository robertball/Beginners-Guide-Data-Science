I thought this was excellent!  I did alter the recipe a little by adding 1/2 cup of Basil/Pesto salad dressing, red bell peppers, cucumber, and black olives.  This was SOOO good though!  It goes well with just about any meal!

I love this recipe. I just do a few additional things. I add broccoli, cauliflower, shredded carrot or basically any fresh vegetable I have available and add 1/2 bottle of Salad Supreme seasoning. If I don't have angel hair I use vermicelli or thin spaghetti. I make this for almost every get together and always come home with an empty bowl.

My brother-in-law called last minute tonight to invite us to a cook out. I was frantic to find something to take and didn't have time to run to the store. I came across this recipe and it required every thing I already had. It took no time to prepare and I didn't come home with any left over. Thank you!

I was looking for something quick to do with pasta for lunch today and came across this recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  It was quick and easy.  I didn't want to use my fresh tomatoes, so used a can of diced tomatoes I had.  Also added fresh chopped garlic - as recommended by one reviewer.  I'll be making again.  Oh - it tastes good with whole wheat pasta too.  :-)

I served this as a light main course, at room temperature and with lots of cheese!  I also used cherry tomatoes and roasted them first.  Overall a easy and tasty last minute dinner.

A basic cold tomato + pasta salad.  As written, 3*.  By adding extra items - fresh basil, salt-free seasoning, chopped broccoli and yellow squash, my rating would go up to 4*.

Excellent dish. I doubled the recipe and added a can of fire roasted chopped tomatoes, chopped garlic, broccoli and cauliflower and substituted Ken's Lite Ceasar dressing. Yummy!

I brought this to my in-laws for dinner and everyone loved it. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I made some changes/additions. I used bow tie pasta instead of angel hair and feta instead of parmesan. I also added a dash of Newmans Own Parmesan and Roasted Garlic dressing. It was great!

I needed a quick, easy, yummy recipe and this fit the bill. After reading many helpful reviews I embarked on my attempt at this recipe and feel like I have a hit on my hands. I used fresh cherry tomatoes and basil from garden and then just added everything I could think of that I had on hand. Broccoli, cauliflower, red onion, olives, fresh parmesan (added it grated and shaved) and topped it off with a little sprinkle of kosher salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic.

Perfect at the end of a hot summer day.  I would've loved it as is, but in order to satisfy my husband's "need" for meat, I added some chicken. We both loved it!

This wasn't all that flavorful, but it was still good for what is in it. I added chopped green onion because I'm an onion fan.

Substituted half of the italian dressing for some balsamic vinegar. Probably about 2 tablespoons worth. It was ok.

This was very plain as is. I think if I make it again I will add some celery and maybe sliced black olives. Not a bad summer salad to go with food off the grill.

I thought the angel pasta was great with the tomatoes, but didn't like the Italian dressing.  Next time will just use olive oil instead.  Other than that, pretty good.

This is delicious.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe, though.  I didn't measure anything, I just grated parmesean on top until it looked like enough (I'm sure I used more than was called for) and then I drizzled Italian dressing until it looked like enough.  I also added some garlic herb seasoning and some leftover turkey.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm...........

This was very good.  I used a light Italian dressing, and am sure it would be even better with regular dressing.  It could be changed up any number of ways with different veggies-cukes, zucchini, broc, caulif, etc.  I added some cut up chicken breast for myself and agree it could be a meal all alone as mentioned by others.

This was quite good for a speedy dish.  It will only be as tasty as your tomatoes, and we had some great ones from a friend's garden.  I made it as directed and snipped about three leaves of fresh basil into it and added some cooked chicken. Will try it with tuna another time. I used bowtie pasta because we like it better than angel hair. I'll be making it often.

This was a complete disaster - the pasta was fine until the sauce turned it red.

This was pretty good. Next time I will try adding garlic and green onion.

I made this dish as an entree but due to its subtle flavors would be much better as a side.

Excellent! Simple, quick, easy, and delicious - just what I was looking for. I substituted Mediterranean Feta for Parmesan as that's all I had, and it was a great flavor booster.

I thought this pasta salad was very good. I used fat-free zesty italian and it tastes just as good. I also added fresh basil for more flavor.

I love this recipe! I didn't have the right dressing, so I used a dry mix recipe that turned out really well. It makes a lot, so if you aren't having a lot of guests, you might want to reduce it.

A very quick and simple recipe, but I think next time I'll add some sausage to it.

I thought this was great!  My husband not, anything pasta without meat is an omen.  This is also good cold with a little bit of tweaking.

I have been using this recipe for the last couple of years now and have found that sun dried tomato dressings work great too...I also add chicken to mine. Everyone here in my home really enjoys it.

My family loved this recipe.  I added zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper and a little onion for flavor along with some lemon and seasoning sprinkled on top with parmasean cheese.  It was very good.
