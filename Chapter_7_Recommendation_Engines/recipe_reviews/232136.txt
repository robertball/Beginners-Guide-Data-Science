Awesome recipe!!!  The buttercream is light and delicious and not too sweet but also holds it shape enough to pipe!  Perfect.

I fell in love with this recipe when I first tried it in 1969, soon after I married. It is imperative that the flour and milk be thoroughly combined before cooking and that the mixture be cooked to a texture of wet mashed potatoes both for firmness and to cook out the flour taste. Be sure it is chilled before adding it to the butter, or obviously it will melt the butter. This is a great recipe.

This recipe is flawless as is if you do it right. It's light,fluffy,and not too sweet. Only tip I can possibly give is whisk the milk and flour vigorously so it doesn't get lumpy and don't over cook it. Amazing recipe!

had tried a similar recipe, but this uses confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar and also calls for more flour. This frosting is very light and not too sweet. I did add an extra tsp of vanilla (I use Mexican vanilla); i also refrigerated the frosting a bit before I put it on the cake.

Quick and easy. Great texture and flavor. I added almond extract instead of vanilla and it turned out phenomenal!  Advice..slowly add milk and flower mixture to get desired consistency.  I had to add more powderd sugar at the end.

I thought this was great! Since I read that it might turn out lumpy, I mixed it in my blender, and it turned out excellent. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Thank you for a great recipe

Make sure when beating the butter your butter is soften & is at room temperature! Avoid cold & melted butter otherwise your buttercream won't whip up into the correct shape. The buttercream is pretty good ! But has a buttery taste (not surprised since it is a standard basic buttercream).

It was very lumpy and flour tasting. I had to whip the flour mixture for over ten min. to minimized the lumps.
I added less then half of the four/milk mixture to the butter/sugar mixture then tasted, the flavor was delicious. I follow the recipe and it ruined the taste. It became a flour tasting frosting. I would recommend adding 1/4 of the flour/milk mixture.

Really easy to make, a lot easier then I thought it would be. Lacked the vanilla flavor in my opinion so I added half a teaspoon of the Almond extract to bring more of the Vanilla Flavor out. I thought it accompanied the vanilla very nicely. But you know to each it’s own. Good Luck Baking y’all.

First time I made the milk flour mixture it was clumpy so I read reviews and learned to well mix before heating which I did the second time. It wasn’t clumpy but then the frosting still was. Looked like baby rice cereal.

This was way too buttery. The only up side to thus frosting is the fact that it wasn’t as sweet as the others.

This did not turn out at all. Despite using a stand mixer I could not get the milk mixture to mix into the sugar and butter without causing lumps. Also there was no way that there would have been enough frosting given the quantity of ingredients listed.

Tastes awesome! This would go great on French Macaroons like I used it for. If you wanted Vanilla Buttercream Frosting,  you would be ridiculous to use another recipe! I will make this again!

I am not sure where I went wrong or if this was how it was to turn out but it was not so good.  The frosting started to separate and it didn't look like frosting but a glaze.  I might try it again to see if I can get it to look like the picture, but if it doesn't turn out again I will be on a search for a new recipe.

I made 2 batches of this recipe. The first, I didn't whisk the flour and milk quickly enough while it was cooking. Maybe the heat was too high also because it got very thick and lumpy very fast. I continued with the directions and it was delicious, but did have small bits of the roux throughout even though I whipped the heck out of it. The second time, I was more aware of what was happening. The roux was smooth, and I utilized the pudding technique of pressing the plastic wrap directly on the surface of the roux while it refrigerated. No little bits! It was creamy and delicious and I'm making it for my niece's cake today.

This recipe was okay. It was sort of time consuming. I followed the recipe fully and the milk mixture would not stir in with the other ingredients, and because of this it  leaked milk. The thicker parts spread on okay, but all I could taste from the frosting was sort of sweet, whipped butter.

Loved the recipe! Put the milk and flour mixture in too soon and it curdled a little but just sat it in the freezer for a few minutes then stirred it for a few and it came together great!!! Love love love this recipe

I didn't use all of the milk/flower mixture. But this was REALLY delicious.  It took a little longer than 5 minutes to heat up and thicken the milk and flower though. 
I will definitely be using this recipe again. Yummy!

It came out thin and tasted more of flour than the sugar or butter.

This recipe turned out perfect! It's creamy and light and delicious. I'm using it in the dark chocolate cake recipe from this site. It makes just enough for a 13 x 9 cake. I'm going to try using it for filling cupcakes next.

this looks nothing like a "frosting." it's all clumped together. it tastes good, but does not have the consistency of a frosting. it can't even be spread with a spatula!!

I didn't follow the directions and it turned out terrible!! But then I actually followed the directions and it turned out ok, I just think I messed up because it was a little thin, and I hoped for it to be thicker

My recipe is similar but it only has 3/4 cup of butter. I would try this again with wondra flour if you have problems with regular flour. This might help to eliminate the lumps. I use gold medal flour in my recipe.  I do NOT use this for frosting.  I used this as a filling for my chocolate torte recipe.
