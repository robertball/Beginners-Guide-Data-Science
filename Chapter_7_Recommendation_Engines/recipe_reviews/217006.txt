This is absolutely delish!!! A definite keeper. My fam is accustomed to grains, so I cut the honey in 1/2 & it was plenty sweet for our tastes. What a healthy, delightful way to eat the most important meal of the day. I would give this 10 stars if I could. The nutty, but sweet flavor is great! Thanx, Yasi! :-)

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes and loved it even more.  Instead of vanilla I added Brown Sugar and some mixed nuts.  Very good!

I am new to the gluten-free world (only a few days!), and thought I would try this to replace my beloved oatmeal.  Well, score one for the team!  I did not have dates or apricots, so I substituted golden raisins.  I will say that I found the recipe too salty, so next time I make it I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.
Other than the salt, I found this to be delicious, with a comforting texture.

This was SOOO delicious.  I used sweetened coconut milk instead of cow milk and honey.  Didn't have apricots so used dates and raisins.  The results were fabulous!  Nice to find a dish that doesn't need wheat, gluten or dairy to be awesome!

I'm not sure how to rate this. I had been looking for a sweet recipe with quinoa, not the usual salty side dishes. This tasted a lot like an oatmeal dish. It was good, but I think I prefer oatmeal to quinoa (at least in this instance). Apricots were too expensive so I used raisins and blueberries instead. The only thing I would change would be to add more cinnamon and honey (or sugar) because those flavors were a little too understated for me. Again, the lower rating comes more from the fact that I did not care for the texture of  quinoa in a "breakfast cereal."

The salt really overpowers this dish. The flavors would be perfect with half as much or no salt. I like the texture of the quinoa and I like the dates and apricots. I added cranberries as well, and I think dried cherries would be nice too.  Be careful that the milk doesn't burn (I used soy) or boil over.

Just wanted to address the "too much salt" comments; I used flaked sea salt, which is a lot more delicate than regualr table salt. So if you're using conventional salt, do lower the amount to taste.

Be sure to use yellow quinoa. I used red quinoa (quinoa with the hull) and it took a lot more liquid and about a half hour more time to get a nicely cooked cereal.  The fruit and spice amounts needed to be increased slightly as well but that can be done at the table.

This recipe really made me love quinoa! The cinnamon so good when you're making it. Really cheap, easy, lowfat, and healthy. I used almond milk instead of cow milk.

I am only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because the amount of salt the recipe calls for ruins the flavor.  I don't like to use a lot of salt, but having never cooked quinoa before I thought I should add some so I added 3/4 tsp. and it was SO salty it was really hard to choke down.  I think I would have loved it if I had completely omitted the salt like I do when cooking oatmeal.

Mine boiled over really fast, even though I had it on low, so I had to continue cooking without covering completey. So..be careful it doesn't boil over!! Other than that, this was my first time cooking with quinoa. It came out very tasty qith a bit of a crunch. Kids loved it! Nice change from regular oatmeal.
thanks!

Very tasty and makes for a nice change for a cold morning.  We live near Trader Joe's and if that's the case for you, make it easy on yourself by using their already toasted almonds.  Works perfectly, saves a step and tastes just as good.

I LOVE salty things & was intrigued by salt/milk mixture.  Unfortunately, it was too salty as written.  Would suggest 1/2 amount of salt.  Also a little bland, so I would add more honey or sugar next time.  Perfect winter food b/c it was surprisingly filling!  Couldn't eat more than 1 cup's worth and was full 'til 2pm.

WAAAY too salty for me  Smelled really good though.  I'm pretty sure this would be a 4-star recipe with less salt.  Unfortunately, I ran out of apricots so I will have to wait to try it again.  Just a note: quinoa should always be rinsed until the foam dissipates before use or it may taste bitter.  I may also add golden raisins and a pinch of ground cardamom when I try it again, I'll have to taste it as written first, with less salt that is!  UPDATE: Add a 3rd star without all that salt!  But I think the quinoa would cook better in water and maybe stir in a little cream right before serving.  The flavors are lovely, especially with a little bit of ground cardamom.

Such a nice change from my morning oatmeal. I reduced the salt and used stevia in place of the honey. Omitted the nuts and mixed with a diced apple and a few dried cranberries.

I heated the Quinoa and cinnamon too long and the cinnamon had too much of a taste to it.  Next time I will use half of the cinnamon.  Otherwise this would have been very good!  

Looking for ways to add whole grain to our regime.

I wanted to love this, but I should've paid closer attention to the reviews. Seems like the two main complaints (too much salt and the fact that it boils over easily) were also my main issues with the recipe. I used 1/2 tsp sea salt, when using just a pinch would've sufficed. As a quinoa newbie, I forgot to rinse it, so I'll definitely do going forward. I didn't have dates (which I adore and would've improved the flavor), so I subbed out some pomegranate craisins. I also used toasted walnuts in lieu of the almonds and added more cinnamon while it was simmering. I will definitely tweak this for next time and try again, as I'm trying to incorporate more quinoa into our family's diet.

It is a little salty, but it's also AWESOME.  I added some chopped fresh ginger and it's super duper yummy.  I used golden raisins for the dried fruit too.

This recipe was very easy to make. The taste was fine but a bit too sweet. Might want to try 1tbsp honey instead of 2tbsps.

It also becomes an IRON POWERHOUSE dish if you replace the milk (which prevents iron absorbtion) with almond milk and the 2 tbsp of honey with 1 tbsp of blackstrap molasses (since the latter has tons of iron). A wonderful change from the typical oatmeal. NOTE: As the cook later indicated in the comments, if you're not using flaked sea salt you need to halve the amount of salt.

VERY TASTY, PERFECTION! I added only 1 tlb of honey & 1/2 the salt & 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I used 3 apricots, chopped mango pieces & chopped crystalized ginger. I rinsed the mango & ginger to remove most of the sugar. I will try grated fresh ginger next time & see if it's not too strong. Also, hubby doesn't like nuts in his food so I sprinkled some on mine only. Gluten Free adds the over-the-top review, esp. when I can't always get GF in the oats.

This is sooo delicious! I only used castor sugar instead of the vanilla as I didn't have any but I am sure with vanila I would've loved it even more! I am on a iron-rich diet and I think this is just the perfect breakfast to start with! :)

I agree that this recipe is too salty, though I only put in a pinch of salt. I'm not sure you can get around it. Overall though, it's pretty tasty.

A fantastic dish! I felt it was sweet enough as it was for a breakfast dish, so I didn't modify in any way. It was the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and nutty. Definitely a wonderful dish to start the day with. Great texture. Also wasn't too heavy or too light, perfect for a breakfast dish and held me over just fine until lunch time. Thanks for sharing.

Eh, this was all right -- other people may like it more, but I wasn't sold by the consistency or taste.
