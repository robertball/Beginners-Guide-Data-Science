This was very easy and fast! I didn't have any asparagus or carrots, but I added peas at the very end and it was delicious.

I also reserved 1/2 cup of pasta water when draining to add to the pasta, helping the parmesan to emulsify into a great sauce.

Made this tonight and loved it. It's very versatile, I omitted the oregano/mushrooms and added broccoli. The touch of lemon at the end really makes the flavor pop...don't skip it! I made a whole bunch so I could have it for lunch tomorrow too!

We saw this in AR Magazine thought we give it a go.  The recipe was easy to follow, prep was a cinch and a pasta primavera that didn't weigh me down with a cream sauce was exactly what I was looking for!  The meal was delicious and filling, we will be making this often during the summer months!

Very easy and quick. I've made it twice now and the second time I subbed fresh green beans for the asparagus and mini-bell peppers for the squash. I think I liked it that way better. Only negative: too much penne - and, that's an easy fix.

This was delicious and a good treat. I've made some minor tweaks to the meal: instead of yellow squash, I've used zucchini since I didn't have the squash. I don't like asparagus and passed on it. Since I didn't have carrots, I've used red peppers. It came out all right.  I would make it again with the yellow squash, but I did have leftovers for another night.
