These are "Delightful" breakfast burritos! I cut the recipe in half and cut back a bit on the garlic and left out the garlic salt. I also cooked the cherry tomatoes a bit in with the scrambled eggs. I used reduced fat cheese and added ham instead of alfalfa sprouts.  I seasoned with a little cracked black pepper. Very filling!

I started this recipe, thinking I had tortillas in the refrigerator.  When I discovered that the tortillas were gone, I just served this dish as straight up scrambled eggs--with the embellishments.  I love the garlic and would never have thought of using garlic in eggs.  I love almost anything in tortillas, so can't wait to try this recipe with with them.  Different and delicious!

It seems like it's heavy on the mushrooms and garlic and light on the eggs, but turns out quite perfect.  I would recommend at least halving the cherry tomatoes just before adding them.  Thanks Andi!

Pretty good. I cut this down to two servings so I could make enough for this mornings breakfast and tomorrow's. I used three eggs actually but one egg yolk, two egg whites. I used 2% cheese and instead of garlic salt, I used a little sea salt. I ate mine wrapped in whole wheat tortillas with a little homemade salsa. This was a filling breakfast made a little lighter with my adjustments.

This was delicious!  I used red pepper instead of mushrooms and 5 eggs.  I may add a little milk to the eggs next time.  I loved the flavor the garlic added.  Great recipe!

Turned out well! I had to substitute some grated paneer for eggs as I was short of eggs and I used marinated mushrooms as I had only those on hand.

Sorry, but the combination of mushrooms and tomatoes made the burrito soggy and unappealing.  Won't make again, but thanks for the intrigue.

My family did not care for this. It is very bland. Even tried adding Picante Sauce and hot sauce to spice it up. Will not make it again.

This was pretty good. I would have never thought of putting sprouts with eggs. I think the recipe calls for too many of them but overall, this is a tasty recipe.
