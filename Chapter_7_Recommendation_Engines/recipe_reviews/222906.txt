I had some leftover arugula from a salad I made and wanted a new way to use it. I found this recipe and ended up eating it as a pasta sauce, over whole wheat penne and sprinkled with crushed red pepper flakes. I love that the sauce is super healthy, loaded with greens and best of all, no olive oil or unnecessary fat! It tastes very fresh and is full of flavor. The lime really adds a nice touch and the avocado makes it creamy, without using heavy cream. I ended up having to use about 1/4 cup of water to get everything to blend. Next time I will try this with flank steak, as suggested by the recipe submitter. Lots of possibilities with this!

I needed a way to finish off a lot of arugula and other ingredients in the fridge so I used this recipe to make a sauce for a pizza. I used milk instead of water to avoid watering down the flavor, and had only lemon juice and not lime juice. The sauce still worked out wonderfully for the pizza, and the flavors worked perfectly with the crust and toppings. We also had a pizza with tomato sauce which tasted VERY salty after eating the pizza with arugula sauce, so safe to say that I found my new pizza sauce.
