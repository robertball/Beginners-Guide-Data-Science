The taste is great, but mine never "set."  Instead of banana pudding, we had banana soup.  Not quite sure what I did wrong.

This is THE banana pudding to make.  My whole family loves it!  Worth every second it takes to make it and every calorie, too.  Though I always use skim milk and you can never tell the difference!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the 1st time I've made anything from scratch that actually turned out and was good!  Actually it was delicious and that fact that it was low-fat made it all the more enjoyable!

This was great!  It was my first time making "real" pudding.  No one could tell it was a healthy version.  I will make this again.

This is a great recipe.  The low fat version is virtually indistinguishable from an original recipe.  Thanks.

It turned out great. I'm not a dessert person but I intentionally made it for my husband and he thought it was the best banana pudding he ever tasted. Thanks!

Wow!  I'd never tried my hand at from-scratch pudding before; this was great!  I realized that I forgot egg substitute at the grocery store, so I used two eggs in its place; there didn't seem to be a problem.  I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I have made this for my boyfriend a number of times and he loves it.  I don't like Banana Pudding but I know that he could not tell that it was healthier for him.  The only thing is that it can stick to the bottom of the pan quickly so make sure that you stir it often.  I will make this receipe again and again.

The is easy and delicious, and worth the extra time instead of making pudding from a box.  We only got 8 servings, but we like sweets.  The pudding was so good, I'd make it alone.  Mine got really thick (thicker than any I've ever seen or eaten) but I may have cooked it too long.  It didn't hurt the dessert though.

It didn't turn out well at all... Way too much vanilla
