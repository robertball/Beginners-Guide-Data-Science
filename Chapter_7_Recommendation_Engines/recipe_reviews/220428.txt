Great recipe! I did not use the jalapeno because I don't like spicy hot foods. Instead of grilling the salmon I poached it. The sauce was very tasty and helped make a nice presentation.

I did tweak the recipe a bit, but not too much.  The salmon needs seasoning - salt & pepper at the minimum, but I chose to use some blackened seasoning that I had left (recipe also from this site).  Grilling the salmon would have been great too, but I chose to broil it in the oven, because it was freezing out today, and I wasn't about to fire up the grill.  I used my own roasted peppers (the ones in the jar just don't cut it for me), and I subbed fresh parsley for the cilantro, in keeping with more Italian flavors.  The sauce is so good!  I love the addition of the parmesan, which gives it a creamy texture.  We all enjoyed this recipe, and I will make it again.  Thanks!

AMAZING flavor! I used 2 fresh red bell peppers that I roasted then pureed, instead of canned ones. Also used canned Salmon that I flaked into the pasta. Dish was flavorful, with the spicy tang from the jalapeno, freshness from cilantro, smoky flavor of the red peppers, and the creaminess of the parmesan all working together perfectly with the salmon.

Pretty good.  The salmon could use seasoning before grilling.  The dish seemed to have some flavor, but not the OOMPH we expected.  We kept adding more salt.  I wonder if something like capers in the sauce would help?  Felt it was missing something.

This was pretty good. The flavor was there, but the sauce didn't thicken up enough for me. Next time I will use flour instead of cornstarch. Overall good recipe.

I had Pacific cod, so that's what I used instead of salmon, and I had snail shell pasta instead of angel hair, but otherwise I followed all the instructions...eventually. (I did use my own roasted red peppers because it's so much cheaper that way.) I forgot to add the cilantro at first though, and so I'm eating the sauce and thinking "this is pretty good, kind of basic Italian tasting, just with a hint of kick from the jalapeno, maybe a 4 star recipe" and then I remembered the chives and cilantro, sprinkled the dried herbs on top, tasted it again, and WOW it made everything just pop. Very good!

I cut the recipe in half because it's just the two of us tonight. I goofed the recipe and put the peppers, cilantro and jalapeno in the processor to make the sauce. I did add extra cilantro and jalapeno for preference. Then put it all into a pot to simmer with the broth, much longer than specified to thicken. More like thirty minutes. I tried to add the parmesan, but it turned into a blob that I eventually fished out, luckily saving the sauce, which was fantastic tasting. I did season the salmon with a lemon marinade before grilling them on the pit, and served everything over pasta. I think it would be better tasting over rice to keep the Spanish flavor going and maybe melt a nice Oaxaca vs parm...or even no cheese, because the sauce was pretty flavorful. Will definitely keep the sauce in mind for future use, so thank you for that!

Really this is all about the sauce!  It pairs very nicely with the salmon which does need seasoning.  I used old bay and lemon slices then cooked it under the broiler.  I also roasted two red bell peppers and sub'd parsley for the cilantro (can't stand the stuff), but otherwise followed the directions.  I wish we would have found this recipe this summer as it tasted so light and fresh and the salmon would have been so much better on the grill.

Tasty and quick! Left out the jalapeño because my 2.5 year old sons were eating it too. Also used sautéed broccoli and zucchini instead of salmon.  We all loved the sauce!!!

The red roasted pepper sauce was delicious pair with the salmon.  The only change I made was to use flour instead of cornstarch, based on someone's recommendation, since I run out of cornstarch.  
Both my husband and I loved it, will definitely go on the rotation
