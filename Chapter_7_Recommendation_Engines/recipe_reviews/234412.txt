10.4.19 I know there are a lot of Jell-O® haters out there, but this family still likes Jell-O®, and we enjoyed this. More sweet than tangy I’d say, but It is SO easy to make, and we liked the crunchy apples and nuts.  Couldn’t really taste the cranberry flavor much, just the sweetness. Reminds me of a recipe my mother-in-law used to make where she used canned cherries, pineapple, and pecans and served with her special chicken casserole. The recipe submitter said that sugar-free Jell-O® was suitable, so that’s what I used. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this recipe a couple of times now...I really liked the flavor & so did my entire family. The only complaint I have is the 12 servings size is a somewhat small size serving. I tried filling a muffin tin with this recipe (just to see what 12 equal amounts would be), the muffin tins were just under half full to get the FULL 12 servings size. Not very much...So I just double the recipe & everyone get more than JUST a TASTE, Other than that IT WAS YUMMIE! :) Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Makes a lot! I used it for Christmas dinner and still had a ton leftover. It was delicious though.

Walnuts are optional.  A dollop of whip cream tastes good.

Husband Loves it!  He asks for it often.  Fast. Use any kind of pineapple or jello. Great for parties and holidays.
