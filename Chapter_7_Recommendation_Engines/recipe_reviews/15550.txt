I loved this recipe!  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead, but it still tasted great (so great that I made a double recipe so I could eat it all week).  Add chicken and black olives and it makes a wonderful salad!!

This went together very easily and quickly. Liked the flavor. Have never added chicken broth to a dressing before and thought I might not like it but everything tasted very good. Might put a little sugar in next time to cut down on the acidity.

Very good, but added a little sugar to cut the acidity of the vinegar.

So simple and yet soooo good.  My husband often asks for me to make the dressing for his regular salads as well.  We love garlic so we put extra garlic in the mix but this one is easy and delicious.

Very good but use sparingly because too much ruins the flavour.  I added green onion and red and green pepper slices.

Makes ALOT of salad, but very good.  I was very suprised by the dressing being so delish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good. I did make some changes though, mostly due to what I had on hand. I used a package of Italian blend salad, halved grape tomatoes, 2 tbs. olive oil & some salt free lemon pepper seasoning (to make up for lack of lemon juice). I also added 2 chicken breasts cooked in some chicken broth and lemon pepper seasoning. I had my doubts as I normally don't enjoy a really "vinegary" salad, but this was good. I also topped it with some shaved parmesan. Even my finicky with salad 7 year old ate it.

I don't know about this one.  It had a strange taste to me.  I think it was the chicken stock.  I will try it again and substitute the chicken stock for dijon mustard.

This was really good.  I did add a little bit of brown sugar to the dressing to cut the acidity. Will make this again.
