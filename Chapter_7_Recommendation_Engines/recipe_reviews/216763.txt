This was really good and I followed the recipe until the end.  Upon tasting it, the texture was really tender, but the flavor was a little more "roast like".  To suit my taste for brisket, I shredded it, added some of my favorite tangy bbq sauce and returned it to the oven to heat through.  This made it great for us--my 5 yr. old loved it too.  Yum!

This was very easy to make and a hit with the family.  Used BullsEye BBQ sauce instead of smoke flavouring which I added to the beer before braising.

My family loved this recipe.  It was not only easy but was moist and flavorful.  I did add BBQ sauce when cooking the brisket as suggested by another viewer.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!!

This is Micki, who submitted the recipe.  Thank you to everyone that left reviews!  I wanted to let you all know that the last couple of times I made this, I did not have time to marinate.  So I tossed all of the ingredients together and covered the pan tightly and baked it at 225 for 8 hrs.  It came out awesome!  Better than the original recipe IMHO.  Enjoy!

Never cooked a brisket before- but I will be doing more again- this was an easy recipe and a great meal for the week!  I wonder if I can incorporate potatoes, carrots and such to the recipe?

Perfectly tender, used newcastle for the beer and it turned out amazing. Definitely go above and beyond on the amount of onions because they're so delicious after they cook in the juices.

I tried this recipe for my wedding reception for the first time. I was running behind so I mixed all of the ingredients together and then poured it over the Brisket and then put the minced garlic on top along with a little garlic salt and onion powder. I didn't have time to do the 24 hour marinade thing. I Cooked it as directed on time and temp and it was amazing. I basted it with the juices twice during cooking and my brisket was a 10lb one so I cooked it for 7 hours. My friend who is a chef said it is the best brisket he ever ate. It was so tender it fell apart. I had to cook it and let it cool completely before I could even slice it or it would fall apart. The key is always have enough liquid in the pan and keep it tightly covered and always cook low and slow. It was awesome!!

Wonderful!  I was only able to marinate for 20 hours, I cut the fat cap off before baking, which was risky because it could have ended up being tough.  Was fall apart tender!  I sliced some Hawaiian rolls in half, placed the meat and onion on, drizzled on our favorite BBQ sauce and placed the tops back on.  Going into regular roation at our house.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hi! I am the submitter of this recipe.  I wanted to let everyone know that the last few times I have made this, I did not marinate at all.  I just threw all of the ingredients together in a roasting pan, covered it and baked it at 250 for 8 hrs. with the fat cap up.  After baking, the fat cap came right off and I skimmed that fat off the gravy.  I then reduced the gravy by half and added some BBQ sauce, (not necessary though because there is plenty of flavor still in the gravy).  I chunked up the meat and tossed it in with the gravy.  It was AWESOME!  The revisions make this perfect.

This was great.  We made brisket tacos with it and served it southwest broccoli slaw and beans.  Will definitely add this to our weekend menus.

We thought that this meat didn't really have a lot of flavor on its own without BBQ sauce. We were kind of disappointed, as it smelled fantastic cooking. I did do the full 24 hour marinade, too.

This was awesome.  I didn't change a thing EXCEPT I added more onions and used onion instead of powder to marinate in.  It was great for our first Hanukkah dinner and will be even better on sandwiches!  You won't be disappointed!

1-15-2016 ~Maybe it’s because when we eat brisket it’s smoked and from notable barbecue restaurants that Hubs and I were not terribly impressed with this.  I followed the directions closely yet despite all those wonderful ingredients and a long marinating and cooking time, we found this surprisingly lacking the robust, beefy flavor we expected. And it was not as tender as we had expected either.  It was ok, but my high expectations and enthusiastic anticipation resulted in disappointment.

Great recipe - my family loved it!  Two suggestions: the cooking time is a little on the long side for a 5 lb brisket - I would suggest closer to a four hour cooking time (then let rest, tented, for 10-15 minutes). At 5 hours the meat will fall apart, but it will be oddly dry.  Also, do not skimp on the ingredients for the sauce it is actually cooking in (more liquid the better). The sauce does make the meal. 
Not a lot of flavor on its own? I read these type of remarks. Slow cooking at a low heat with a good sauce is the best way to enjoy this inexpensive cut of beef.

I used guinness for the beer and this recipe was smashing! I served it to my family of 8 adults and 4 children.  We are all foodies and we all loved it! I also cooked it for 6.5 hours instead of just the 5.

I liked this recipe. I turned out to have a nice smokey flavor all on its own, and was even better with a little bit of bbq sauce. Perfectly tender, falls apart when you eat it but you can still slice it. Will definitely use this on all my future briskets, thanks. (Side note, I didn't have a full day so I only marinaded for 12 hours. Will probably be even better with the full day)

fan-flippin'-tastic. Usually inTexas, brisket isn't cooked in barbecue sauce like many recipes on here call for. Each person adds there own sauce after it's finished cooking. I think this is what accounts for some reviewers saying it didn't have much "flavor". I used this recipe to make brisket sandwiches that I served with coleslaw. Yum! Followed the recipe exactly as is. This recipe is a keeper.

We thought it was Bangin' Good!  I had a bigger brisket so I cooked for 6 hours.  Also, added about a half a beer in the marinade.  Yummy!  Everyone, my husband, father-in-law, 10 year old, 6 year old, & 5 year old ate it up!  Thanks for sharing!

Well, I didn't have non-condensed liquid heat so that may have altered the intended taste, but we just didn't care for the tangy flavor. Wouldn't make this recipe again.

This was a big hit at my party I altered the marinade by adding 1 can of beer to it and I used the can of beer when it was cooking. 

I got compliments on this recipe and people came to me and asked me how I got it so juicy and I was called an "oven cheater". Next time i'll follow the same recipe and smoke it for real instead of using liquid smoke.

This turned out wonderful.  Only change I made was I did use the concentrated liquid smoke in the amount called for and it turned out great.

Just made it. Have smoked many a briscut, this was a big let down. Followed the directions to a T, like other review was tender but it is an hour after dinner and still waiting for the bangin'... Nearly tasteless and to true briscut enthusiasts,  this was embarrassing.Glad not a dish served for company. l

Cooked brisket for July 4th exactly according to the recipe. Although, the brisket came out very tender, there was no flavor at all. I was so disappointed. Cooked 10.65 brisket at 275 for 7.5 hours. Sure was glad I checked the temp of the meat because it was done way before according to cook time of at least an hour to 1lb of brisket. I gave it 2 stars just for being tender!

Really good!  Instead of baking for five hours, I put this in the slow cooker all day.  Delicious!

This was really good. I had on hand a 1.6 lb rolled, grass fed brisket. I should have un-rolled it, but no problemo...it was flavorful and delish!

Made this for a big family dinner yesterday. Made it exactly as written- no reason to change anything in this recipe. Was loved by all. Will definitely make this again.

this recipe is awesome.   I have now made this three times and have made minot changes.

I added half a can of beer to the marinade.  
For the final half hour I removed the juice, cut the brisket into strips and covered with a bottle of bbq sauce and water ( 1 to 1)
Unbelievable and this is now a staple in our house

Easy recipe to follow.  The brisket was juicy, tender, and very tasty.

I left out the liquid smoke because I had to prepare the meat that day and couldn't fit in a special trip to the store just for that. Still turned out BANGIN'!  Will definitely make again!

I used the can of beef broth in the cooking instead of a can of beer. The rest was as the recipe said any it was great. I’m gonna make this again!

This turned out super tender & juicy.  I followed the recipe pretty closely as far as marinating & cooking time.  A half hour before the end, I added cabbage wedges & red potatoes.  I found the onion flavor to be overwhelming and just didn't care for the tangy flavor so probably won't be making this again.  Tonight, I made leftovers of the dish and added carrots plus more potatoes & more cabbage.  I liked it better - the carrots were a great addition.
