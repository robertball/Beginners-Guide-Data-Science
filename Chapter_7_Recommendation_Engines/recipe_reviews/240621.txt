I love overnight oatmeal and make mine using most of the ingredients listed for this one. While I like sweet potatoes, I discovered with this recipe that I don't particularly care for them in my oatmeal. I think this is a personal preference type thing on my part. Others might really like this savory oatmeal, but I'll probably stick with fruit in mine.
