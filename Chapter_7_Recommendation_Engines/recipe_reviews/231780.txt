This is a tough one to rate, so i decided to keep it simple and go by the stars' descriptions and the most accurate is the two star "didn't like it".  I chose to use the submitter's suggestion in the tagline and shake in a shaker, then pour over ice in a cocktail class as a sipping drink.  This is the first *faceless* drink I've made that I did not finish.  It's quite strong and I couldn't get past the milky consistency.  I thought after a few sips it would grow on me, but it didn't.  CHEERS, KEHUGGINS2!
