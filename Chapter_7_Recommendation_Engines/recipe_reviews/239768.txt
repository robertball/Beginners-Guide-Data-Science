Good.  Mine weren't quite cornucopia looking, but tasted good.  I served with scrambled eggs for breakfast.  I think next time I will dot the filling with a scant 1/2 tsp. of pineapple-apricot preserves or marmalade prior to wrapping dough to give them a bit of moisture and touch more sweetness.  I think that may take them over the top.  They tasted better at room temperature after sitting around for 30-40 minutes to let the flavors meld.  The outside temp here has been 107 degrees the last two days so I baked in two batches in my toaster oven for 22 minutes each and rotated pan half way through baking because it cooks one side faster than the other.  Used left-over cooked chicken-apple sausage and a Mexican cheese blend that needed to be used.  To ensure equal amounts of filling for each and no leftovers, I dumped the filling onto a plate and divided into 4 piles; then filled each with half a pile.  I think breakfast sausage would have tasted better. After studying the picture, I just figured out where I went wrong with my cornucopia technique.  I was sealing the short side instead of the long.   Short side needs to stay open and then stretched a little on the bottom to keep filling inside.  Picture helped; because the words just weren't sinking in.
