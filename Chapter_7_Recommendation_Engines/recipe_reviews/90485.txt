Really delicious, my whole family loved it!  I added 1/2 cup instant rice, another can of beans, and a little more broth.  We topped it with sour cream, tortilla chips and a blend of shredded mexican cheeses, yum!

Abandon ship! Abandon ship on the original recipe. It has no taste. Someone should have known better than to post a recipe like that. I had to seriously adulterate the recipe to get something tasty out of if and I am a college student- we usually eat anything. If you don't heed my advice and you've already made it try adding lots of canned diced tomatoes (chili without a tomato base is a preposterous concept, that should have been my first clue) and pepper and chili powder and  little cinnamon

A keeper recipe!  I used 2 cans of great northern beans and one can of navy beans.  I mashed one of the great northern beans.  We really enjoyed the recipe!  Not only was the recipe fast and easy, but my entire family enjoyed it.  This is a recipe I will make again and again.
