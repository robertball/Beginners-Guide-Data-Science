This recipe was really tasty.  I did make a few changes:  I didn't have desert cups and didn't want to dirty alot of dishes so I used a pyrex pie dish instead of the desert cups.  I used 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs bc I love this type of crust and to also add a little more substance to the dish.    To compensate for the additional graham cracker crumbs I added more melted butter and a small amount of sea salt (to taste).  Be careful with the sea salt bc you just want a hint to complement the sweetness in the dish (You can always add more but won't be able to take out).    I put down my grahm cracker crust in the bottom of the pie dish, packed it down with a clean dry spoon, added the cream cheeese mixture on top and them topped the dish with cherry pie filling. I put in the fridge then served.  Yummy!! A very quick and delicious snack to make for your family.

Made for Valentine's Day.  So easy to make and even more delicious.  Only change I made was to substitute powdered sugar for regular sugar in the crust. Just personal preference. Everyone wanted seconds!

Absolutely a great recipe! I just got little dessert dishes and wanted to try them out. Instead of the Cherry Pie filling I used thawed Strawberries and layered them on top of the graham cracker bottom, then added more on top. I topped it off with whipped topping. So easy, and looks amazing. One thing I found was it was a little sweet, but other then that Great recipe : )
