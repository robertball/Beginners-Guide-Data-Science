This is a great easy and fast dip you can make that everyone will love. Almost as good as a chicken wing dip that I make in the oven only without cheddar cheese and blue cheese dressing added. I think from now on ill make this one. Its a little less junky, not nearly as greasy and tastes almost the same. Not only that but its ready in just minutes in the microwave. How can You go wrong

Super easy and quick.  Great recipe go-to when you need something to bring to a pot-luck or party or just when friends drop in.  Try adding blue cheese or putting the dip under the broiler for a few minutes!

My family doesn’t like spicy food so I used half the amount of hot sauce.  If you don’t care for hot food I would suggest you add 1/8 cup and taste it before adding more.  The dip is, as it’s title suggests “ quick and easy.”  It tastes good too.  I can see adding a bag of frozen cauliflower to this and baking it and serving it as an entree.

All the flavors you love in a buffalo chicken dip made easy with Tyson's grilled and ready pulled chicken. It doesn't get any easier than this! For an added texture, broil in your oven on low for a few minutes to create an irresistible "crust" on the outside. Wing lovers will love you for making this dip....

We loved this dip!!! Easy and very tasty. We had it cold with tortilla chips, carrots and celery. The chicken was very tasty and very practical for quick recipes. I'm making it again.

Very quick and easy! I pan thawed my chicken and that heat helped melt together my cream cheese, etc. All the guests at the party ate this up. It goes a long ways, so great for a crowd!

This was so easy! I used almost half the chicken and it was plenty meaty. My family will definitely make this again. This recipe will be great for football season. Tastes like wings but isn't fried!

Very addictive!  Thanks for the recipe.  We put it in a small crock pot and heated it up.  Liked it better warm than cold.  Used some roasted chicken  that was left over.

This is such a quick and easy dip! Tasty too. I couldn’t find the Tyson shredded chicken, so I used the grilled strips and cut them as finely as possible. I used Frank’s Buffalo Sauce. Dinner was on the table tonight in less than 30 minutes!

Quick. Easy and delicious. I halved the recipe and used rotisserie chicken, a few mins in the microwave and it was good to go.
