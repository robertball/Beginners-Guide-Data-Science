Fun to make with my kids. We substituted the extract with pur√©e. Mine turned out a little more heavy.

We opted for vanilla instead of the berry extracts. Turned out delicious. We used starburst cut in half with ocean animal gummies to finish off our ocean themed cupcakes. My 8 and 10 year old made these together and found he recipe easy to follow.

it came out very yummy! Instead of berry I used all raspberry instead of strawberry abstract and blueberries. The frosting was a pain to make and made a mess.
