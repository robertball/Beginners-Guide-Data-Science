The problem with this recipe is that its wrong.  Way wrong...You forgot gin, and blue curacao, the tequila is optional, and your missing the whole reason the drink is called a grateful dead.... Take a pint glass full of ice and add you VODKA, GIN, WHITE RUM, AND TRIPLE SEC, fill with SOUR MIX and top with LEMON-LIME SODA... now the most important part...around one half of the rim of the glass pour in a little BLUE CURACAO, and the other half pour in a little RASPBERRY LIQUER....the two twist together through the drink creating a tie-die effect, hence the name...GRATEFUL DEAD!!!

This was a really easy drink to make, but because it tasted much more like rum & coke than a punch.  It's verrrrry powerful too!

This was ok at best in my opinion.  The concept seems great & the flavor is nice BUT it is just way too sweet for me.  If I made it again, I think I would omit the triple sec since it is primarily a sweetener.

This was very sweet, and very strong, but VERY tasty!  It was a little too strong for some of my guests, so I had to reduce some of the alcohol, which is why I rated it a 4.  I loved it, though.  For myself, it's 5 stars...

This is not a drink I would want all the time because it's pretty sweet.  That being said, this was delicious.  It almost has a chocolatey taste to it.  So you'll know, 1/4 fluid ounce is about 2 1/4 teaspoons, and 2 fluid ounces is 4 tablespoons.  Thanks for the recipe!
