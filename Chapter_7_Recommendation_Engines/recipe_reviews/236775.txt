I like that you wrote add your own pazole ingredients, so because sometimes I go crazy having been brought up in areas around numerous other cultures learning their traditional seasonings, because even though I have been a certified chef for over forty years I started cooking long before that learning my one great passion, I and I'm still passionate about cooking although I can't walk very well, Belinda and have to use a stool if I have to stand very long. Your recipe was very good I used a lot of Serrano peppers though because I'm either crazy or immune, but it was very good, and I eve crumbled cooked bacon in it once, thank you, and Shalom.

Dice some tomato, use menudo seasoning, most of my recipes are simply bases, add to as you see fit or want to try.

I liked the combo of pork and hominy.. a different burrito. I do think this needed a lot more seasoning and I also think it needs something tomato.. any posole I have had has contained tomatoes of some sort
