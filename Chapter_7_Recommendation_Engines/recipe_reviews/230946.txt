This was a hit with my husband and son, despite the fact that I made my own crust and kind of burned it. I used milk instead of cream, which turned out fine, and regular cheddar cheese.

I did not have the specific cheese or cream this recipe asked for--I used equal amounts Helluva Good extra sharp cheddar cheese and equal amounts evaporated milk. I also used leftover taco-spiced chicken meat from dinner a couple night's back and added some fresh ground pepper. I served this with sour cream and homemade salsa. Very good. NOTE: This rewarms well.

I didn't have cream so I used milk; I added canned mushrooms, fresh ground pepper, and 1 egg. Perfect!
