Wow, I thought this was best Mexican Rice ever.  I used the Rotel tomato with green chilis and added some extra green chilis to spice it up.  This is definitley a keeper!

This was really good!  After reading others reviews, I used Rotel tomatoes (about 1/2 of the can and all the juice).  Since I used all the juice from the Rotel, I only used a cup of water.  Also, I sauted half of a jalepeno chopped up and 1 tsp. of minced garlic with the onions.  As for the seasoning I just used heaping 1/2 tsps of cumin and chili powder.  The flavor turned out great!

This recipe is delicious!  You have to use chicken stock instead of water, as it gives it even more flavor!  Other than that, I made it as is.  It's really easy too!  I DEFINITELY would highly recommend!

I have tried quite a few mexican rice recipes from this site, and this is one is my favorite - my search is over! The amount of spice and tomato was just right. I did just dump in some salsa instead of opening a fresh jar of tomato sauce.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

Really good.  I added 1/2 clove of garlic to the onions and a couple of teaspoons of chopped green chiles to the tomatoes.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  i would have used rotel instead, but i was out.  also, after the rice completed cooking i added a handful of frozen corn then put the lid back on for a few minutes.  the corn heated up and retained it's texture.  I served this with a mexican style steak and it was really good.  this will become a go-to on fajita nights!

Excellent!  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and added a can of rotel tomato with chilli.  So good! ****the juice from rotel is about a 1/2 cup.  So only add 1 cup of water or chicken broth******.

I didn't stick to every letter of the recipe, but I still give this five stars for flavor and versatility. The only real changes I made were to add 3 cloves minced garlic, and swap the water for chicken stock. I doubled the chili and cumin. We devoured it.

I made this with my Cinco de Mayo meal and it was great!  I used diced tomatoes with chili spices because that's what I had on hand and it worked well.  Better than anything you buy in a packet!

This is really easy to prepare with things you most likely already have in your kitchen -- I use salsa instead of diced tomatoes (no sense opening up a whole can of diced tomatoes for just 3 oz). It's good as a side dish and won't overpower flavors of the other things you might be serving with it.

This is good.  I used chicken stock instead of water and I think I got better results that way.  I used a fresh tomato instead of canned.  Needed quite a bit of salt even with using the chicken stock.  Thanks so much Michelle!

We really like this recipe as a standby for taco night.  We usually substitute about a 1/4 cup salsa for the tomatoes, because who wants to open up a whole can just for that?  Super fantastic.

This rice is good, but I made it with 3/4 c chicken broth and 3/4 c water. I had to add another c of water or so, and when I did I threw in a boullion cube. I can't see how this would have any flavor made with water. But it's good--our new side dish for tacos, etc.

Really good Mexican rice- very close to restaurant quality.  I used a can of chicken broth instead of the water.  Also a whole can of diced tomatoes with green chilies so I cooked 1 1/2 cup of rice.  This is a great go to side dish!

This was really easy and good.  I doubled the recipe, using onion powder instead of onion (I didn't have one).  I used brown jasmine rice (the only kind I had) so it took about 35 minutes to cook.  It would be really good with corn thrown in too (I had corn on the side this time).  I served it with shrimp tacos, and it was perfect!

This rice was great!  I added 1/2 can of drained petite diced tomatoes, along with a chicken bouillon cube and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I have to beg to differ on the serving size though; this rice fed my family of 4 and I can't imagine getting 7 servings out of it.  Great recipe!

I was very, very low on groceries and happy to see an easy rice recipe. I didn't have onion or tomatoes, so instead I used a six oz. can of tomato paste. I used double the rice (but it was brown rice) and triple the spices (except the salt). I also added about 1/2 cup of green pepper. The result was good, but not fabulous.

We liked this recipe a lot.  It had the spices but still pretty mellow.  The second time we made it we added one fresh chopped tomato instead of the canned.  It's easy and tastes great!

Tripled the cumin and chili pepper, almost a whole can of roasted diced tomatoes (semi drained) and the sauteed onion were all added for the last two minutes of the rice. Used a rice maker. Easy and excellent. Don't even like lots of spice, but "as is" is bland. Will add black beans next time to make this a main entree for a vegetarian meal.

Excellent.  Easy to make, ingredients I always have in the house, and to top it off - excellent flavor.  I would absolutely make it again.

Used a half a tomato, diced, rather than using 3 oz of canned.

Really good! I followed all of the directions as written except I used a little salsa instead of diced tomatoes (because it was already open) and after sauteing, before adding the broth (instead of water), I threw everything into my rice cooker and let it go. :) great recipe, easy to make.

Very tasty. I didn't add the 1 1/2 cups of water because I wanted the rice to stay firm and I didn't have time to do so.

This was simple and tasty. I used chicken broth instead of water, that's just how I do it. I didn't have canned tomato so I added a spoonful of salsa. This needed a little garlic but it was good overall. Thanks Michelle, this was a good rice.

Love this rice.  It is perfect as is.  I have used diced tomatoes with green chilies.  This adds a bit more kick.  Either is excellent.  I serve this rice with every Mexican meal I make.

It might be unfair for me to rate this as I changed it so much! But, I used 1 bag of instant rice instead of regular.  I also do not like cumin or chili powder accept maybe in tacos as the taste is so strong!  So, I just minced a clove of garlic. Lastly, I used vegetable broth in place of the water which adds a lot more flavor. Because I used instant rice it only needed to boil for about 5 minutes or less, an added bonus, as I was busy. This recipe is very adaptable, but if you like a milder rice skip the spices and add a clove of minced fresh garlic like I did. Was all eaten up with the chicken tacos it was served with!

Wow this rice was amazing! The best mexican rice I have ever had in fact. I actually did something a little different. Instead of adding the chili powder and cumin I used 1 tsp out of a Taco Bell taco seasoning pkt and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of just water....Wowza!!! This was awesome! Gotta try it that way and see what ya think. We will definitely be having this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty.  I used a whole 10 ounce can of Rotel mexican tomatos.  Chicken stock instead of water and a small can of corn niblets undrained.  I used Basamati rice and had to add a bit more stock halfway through cooking time.  Will definitely make again!!!

I was hoping this would be a good way to spice up rice. It smelled good cooking, but it tasted really bland. The spices gave the rice a nice color, but no flavor at all... I'm not making this one again.

This was very good and pretty easy.  I used brown rice and a fresh tomato, since I didn't have any canned, and it worked beautifully.  The spice level is mild, but satisfying, although I think it could use a little more salt.  Definitely a keeper.

2-5-2016  ~Very nicely flavored; one of the better recipes for Mexican rice I’ve tried.  While some Mexican rice recipes are either too bland or too bold, this one is just right. For extra flavor I cooked the rice in chicken broth and, because it would not have been practical to open up a can of tomatoes for the small amount I needed, I simply substituted good, red-ripe tomatoes.

It was good, but my rice came out a little too mushy for my liking. I would either use less water next time, or use chicken stock. I also think it could of used more flavor, which the chicken stock would help with.

This was very easy!  I grew up thinking that Mexican rice was like macaroni and cheese with tomatoes ~ it just didn't sound appealing.  When I had it at Mexican restaurants for some reason I always thought that it was SPANISH rice.  After making this I won't hesitate to make/eat it again.

My rice came out tasting sweet for some reason. I used brown jasmine rice and followed the recipe exactly, except that I used fresh tomatoes, diced jalapenos and garlic salt. I also used chicken stock instead of water. I made these few changes because many others who posted comments about the recipe also did the same things. Maybe the fresh tomatoes were too sweet. I will add more salt next time, but I'm still not sure what went wrong. Still a good recipe, though.

This is a very good recipe as written. It tastes almost exactly like the rice a Mexican acquaintance of mine used to make. However, I prefer to use chicken broth instead of water. It adds a little more flavor.

This was pretty good. I made it with chicken stock and added some poblano pepper to the onions and some garlic powder to the seasonings.

As other reviewers have suggested, I used a full can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. Even with that volume of tomatoes, the tomatoes didn't overwhelm the dish. In the future, I may go with more chili powder and cumin; the flavor was just not as pronounced as we prefer. Still, this is a delicious side dish and offers the benefit of being healthy too!

My family just loves this rice.  I made it like the recipe suggests but once I had no tomatoes so I added salsa.  Wow.....a party in your mouth! Great recipe without changes and the amount of spices adds wonderful tastes. Thanks for the recipe.

All I had was Minute Rice, which I cooked in chicken broth, with a little vegetable oil, then mixed the cooked rice with all the ingredients from this recipe (except I used fresh diced tomato instead of canned). It was a huge hit, my family loved it! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was very tasty but my rice never seemed to cook all the way though leaving it underdone.  I just added a hint more water the second time around and it was fine.  It had a great flavor.

yeah, this is pretty much delicious. i use short grain instead of long grain rice, and it fluffs up perfectly in twenty minutes. also, like many other people, i've used the rotel tomato/chile mix as well as diced tomatoes, and instead of water, i use chicken broth. mmm.

Mmmm, easy, tasty...  I'd agree to go for the ro-tel/Mexican-style canned tomatoes; otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  Used low salt chicken bouillion broth and just a dash more salt.  Thanks!

I made this last night and my family loved it.  I didn't have regular tomatoes, only rotel, so I used them.  I also used heaping 1/2 tsp. of cumin and chili powder.  I had to add a little more water (it may have been the type of rice I used).  I will definitely make this again!

Super easy and super delicious!! I never thought I could make mexican rice myself. This proved me wrong. I did use chicken broth instead of water. So, I omitted the salt. I make it at least 3 times a week!

This was good, but I made some changes. I added corn and used chicken broth in place of the water. I also left out the onion because I realized at the last minute I didn't have one. 
All in all, I will definitely make again

I'd definitely make this again, but would probably add some taco seasoning to give it a bit more flavor.  I also added a bit of salsa to it while it was cooking.

This is a great foundation for a recipe, even though I can't figure out the screwy measurements. I added or changed a few things...for four servings, added  2 cloves of garlic to the onion. Substitued lime and cilantro flavored rotel for the diced tomatoes (and added more than recipe called for). Also Substituted liquid from rotel and chicken broth for water.

This is great rice recipe. It is simple & cheap to make but also tastes wonderful. I have made this without the diced tomatoes and just used tomato sauce and it was just as good.

I thought it was good but I like spicy and hot food so I added a jalapeno to it, which made it better, in my view.

This was really good, I used only organic ingredients and instead of canned tomatoes I used tomato paste. I also used a bit of curry powder instead of only cumin and vegetable broth instead of water. At the end I sprinkled a bit of lemon juice which gave it a nice tangy fresh flavor. I topped  it with vegan homemade refried beans. Super Yum!

The finished product was good, but not phenomenal. Personally, I would've preferred a higher spice to rice ratio.

This is the first time I’ve ever made Mexican rice from scratch and it turned out perfectly. I even had to quadruple the recipe and it still was perfect. And I liked that it was simple. I’ve always been intimidated by Mexican rice but not anymore! I’ll definitely make it again & maybe add bell peppers next time. Otherwise perfection!

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I followed it exactly the first time but will use a little more chili powder or maybe chipotle chili power the next time.

I tried this because I had run out of my favorite boxed Mexican rice but this recipe will be my goto solution for Mexican rice in the future.  

The only issue I have is that it uses very little of a can of diced tomatoes so Im thinking about putting the rest of the can in a plastic ice cube tray and freezing.  A couple of cubes should be just about right for this recipe.

This recipe seemed too simple to have this much flavor! This recipe rivals many restaurants. I substituted brown jasmati rice for white rice and chicken broth for water. I also left out the onion as my family isn't a fan of onions. We all thought it was delicious! It doesn't make a large quantity, so consider doubling if you're feeding 4 or more.

It was very good.   Only change I made was toast the rice in the oil first which makes the rice fluffy.   Definitely will make again.

It’s a great basic Mexican rice. Some changes I do, add a few green olives, and three bay leaves during the simmering. I also sub the water with chicken broth.

I loved it, but quadrupled the cumin. If you want that authentic Mexican taste, you might want to increase it to taste, as well. I also substituted chicken broth for the liquid and think that added a bit of flavor. A great recipe overall!

I have found the recipe that I will be using from now on when we have taco night.
This is my families favorite recipe!
I used to just buy the box mix because I couldn't get the rice right. Now I can make it homemade and they come back for seconds and thirds. Thank you so much.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It had good flavors, but there was way too much liquid.  In order to cook off the liquid I had to simmer it much longer than instructions said to do.  That made it very mushy.  No one wanted to eat it.  Might try again with less liquid and, therefore, cooking time.

I guess I really shouldn't rate this yet since I did make a couple of changes...but...it was really delicious. I used a whole can of Rotel with chilies and 1 cup of water, and I used a mix of brown, red, white and wild rice. For my husband and me, it was too hot. For my daughter it wasn't hot enough! And my sons thought it was just right (Does this sound like Goldilocks and the Three Bears? ha ha ) The next time I will cut back on the Rotel so I can enjoy it more. It was moist and tender. Thank you!

I made this exactly as written, and we found it very bland.  Next time I would sub chicken broth for the water and pump up the amound of cumin and chili powder to try to give it some more flavor.

I love this rice dish, I used to buy the microwavable packets and I  can't believe it was that easy to make this myself without spending a fortune on packet rice. I added some spring onions and had this as a side dish with chicken. Lovely!

Well, I was going to rate this 3 stars, then realized salt IS listed in the ingredients. Not sure how I missed that! I did add a diced jalapeno (seeds and membrane included) and would do that again. I missed the flavor of garlic in this SO MUCH. So much so that finally I couldn't stand it anymore and had to add garlic powder at the table, which bums me out because garlic powder is such a waste compared to what this COULD HAVE been like. In the future I would absolutely saute a smashed garlic clove (or 2!) with the rice just before adding the liquids, stirring constantly to keep it from burning. I'd up the spices, too, but that's just me, I prefer everything spicier than others do :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this rice to accompany Texas Chicken Quesadillas and it was a good side dish.  I added minced garlic with the onion and used salsa in place of the tomato sauce.  It was pretty simple and quick to make.

I made this with a can of Rotel tomatoes which was suggested by many.  My husband loved it, and I will definitely be making again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious! But I did have to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand last minute. I used brown minute rice, was out of chili powder and cumin so I used an equal mix of garlic powder, paprika and cayenne pepper. I also added fresh salsa instead of canned diced tomatoes. Still very good and I bet original recipe is even better!

My husband made this.  He loves Mexican rice and said this was way better than anything we get at a restaurant or out of a packet.  Instead of the diced tomatoes and 1.5 cups water, we used a 10oz can of Rotel and 1 cup of water.

Good side dish.  A tad bland.  Might be better if made w/ chicken broth.  An addition of beans or more "zip" (like chili pepper) might be good.

Enjoyed this recipe. Used rotel (about 3/4 can and all the liquid as a substitiute for equal parts water)as suggested by others. Thought it was missing a little something...added shredded cheese to the top on the reheat and liked it even better.

This was awesome. I skipped the cumin since I didn't have any and used a whole can of Rotel that I had on hand. I added garlic powder a must for me. As recommended I used chicken broth in place of water (1 1/4 cup) and just a 1/2 tbsp of seasoning from a taco kit I was using. I did as it said and sauted the onions and then added the uncooked rice to coat w/ the oil but afterwards I added all of the ingredients into my rice cooker and let it do the work. It turned out delicious and my honey absolutely loved it better than the store bought mexican rice I usually make. I used salt to taste after rice was cooked.

Very easy! I used this side dish in feeding a large crowd. I added vegetable base (can use chicken bullion instead) to give it a little extra flaver. I also added cilantro for perfection.

Used 1/3 cup salsa instead of tomatoes and a chicken boullion cube for flavoring.  Otherwise followed the recipe and we really liked it.  Will make again.

This ended up to be a very tasty side dish - but I can't give a 5 for the recipe because I changed the proportions and ingredients.  I only used 1/2 cup rice and added an entire 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes (liquid included) then adjusted the amount of water to total about 1 1/4 cups liquid.  I made this to serve with Fish Tacos so wanted something with a bit more kick.  I made this the night before, and when I reheated I added some picante sauce and some chicken granules for even a little more spice and flavor.

Very good - I added taco seasoning like it was suggested by previous reviews. I wanted this to be a one pot meal so I added left over chicken that I shredded,some peeled whole tomatoes, sweet corn, and red kidney beans and it came out great.

This is very good rice--I like the flavor. I used a roma tomato, and will use another tomato next time, along with 1/2 tsp. of salt--it was a little too salty.

This was easy to make, and good! I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I didn't have any cumin on hand, but it was good without it! I served this with pollo fajitas on this site. Thanx for sharing the recipe!

Sorry, this was missing something for us.  I used tomatoes with green chiles, and used the juice from the tomatoes in place of some of the water.  Despite those additions, this was still not that flavorful.  On the plus side, this was really easy, but I think we'll keep looking for a mexican rice recipe.  Thanks anyway!

I have looked for an easy recipe using items that I already have in my kitchen, including several with chili powder and cumin as the main spice. I was truly surprised how much flavor this had. I assume it comes from the sauted onion. It definitely made our house smell good. 
I did make a few variations that probably took away from the flavor/texture.  For example, I used fresh diced tomato and red onion because that is what I had. This was the best that rice that I have made, but not the best that I have ever had.

This wasn't bad....but not my taste. Too much tomatoes and it didn't taste like anything else when it was done.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It smelled great while it was simmering, but the tasty was absolutely bland. I expected much more flavor, and I thought there were too many tomatoes. Unfortunately we could not eat this. Mexican Rice II from this site is my favorite!

This was an easy recipe.  It was very spicy, but very good.  I used rotel tomatoes and chilis, like someone else recommened instead of the canned tomatoes and it was very good.

Great!  To fit my diet better, I cut back the oil to 1 teaspoon, cut the salt in half, and used brown rice.  It was terrific!

Excellent rice!  It has just the right amount of seasoning.  We really enjoyed it.
