Super easy. My daughters made this for me. Only problem was that they stuck it in the fridge. I liked it better at room temperature!

I have to say that for being so simple this was just so yummy!  I substituted one bar of dark chocolate for the chocolate/almond and it gave it a nice rich taste.  The best part is that my kids made the entire thing!

This was delicious! It was a lot to have sitting around the house, but I may make it again and cut it into little squares for Christmas time.
