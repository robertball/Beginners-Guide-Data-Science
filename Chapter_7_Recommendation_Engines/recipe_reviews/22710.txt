Excellent recipe, have been using this on for years.  I add one more step to mine.  I slice the loaves into about 1/2 inch slices.  Put back on a baking sheet, sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar and bake for 20 to 30 minutes at 250 degrees to dry them out.  It is much better this way

THIS IS SIMPLY DELICIOUS! I formed three loaves the width of one baking sheet--they dont spread so much and it was able to cook it it all on one sheet. Trust me with this one- check after 30 or 35 minutes of cooking. When LIGHTLY BROWNED, take them out of the oven. Let them cool till warm (about 15 or 20 minutes) and slice. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and lay pieces on sides. bake for 2-3 minutes on each side. Cool completely. Trust me-this seems like they would be undercook but theyre delicious when theyre slightly underbaked. if not, theyre too cakey. so underbake them by 5 minutes or so...TRUST ME!! ENJOY!

This is fabulous as it is, but I buy three disposable aluminum pans, approximately 5 x 12 by 1 inch high.  It makes three perfectly uniform loaves in 1/2 hour.  I then slice them and return them to the oven at 250 for 1/2 hour as someone else had suggested.  Couldn't be more perfect!  They are gone in a flash.

I don't know if the photo is misleading or I did something incorrect, but I expected chocolate mandelbrot not regular mandelbrot with chocolate chips.  While the end result was ok, I was disappointed after all the rave reviews.  Also, 50-55 minutes cooking time burns the bottom.

These were really good.  I also baked the 2 loaves, then sliced them after they baked for 55 minutes, sprinkled on more cinnamon sugar and then baked on each side for an additional 10 minutesper side.   I made them for my Jewish friends for Passover. Everybody loved them. I will be making another batch tomorrow to keep! I am also going to try cranberries and white chocolate.

I prepared these for the first time and they are all gone!  I got a really high yield of cookies out of this, prob about 4 doz biscuits.  I formed 3 loaves, baked them on parchment paper lined pan, and only baked them for about 35 minutes.  I cooled them for 20 min, sliced them, sprinkled them again with cinn sugar, and hit them again at 250 for another 30 min.  Superb!  They were crunchy without being totally dried out.  Next time I will add cranberries and nuts (I left the nuts out this time as I did not have any on hand) to the choc chips.

Wow this recipe was the best.  I just became a member so I can review this.  I made this on Monday for the seder and it came out incredible.  But mine was more like a cake and I loved it.  I don't cook much but I made this and it was a huge hit.  I just followed the recipe exactly it was great.  Thanks for putting this on.  I am going to make it again for next week.

Was so excited to get this in the oven, forgot to sprinkle sugar/cinnamon on top - didn't miss it!!  YUM!  AND you don't have to make these into logs, the dough is thick/heavy enough that you can shape them into any shape for fun.  Highly recommend!!

I have just made this for the forthcoming Passover, but I doubt if it will last that long. I followed the directions exactly, sliced them and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes  @ 250 degrees. and they really came out fantastic. Thank you for sharing.

This tastes so much better than the store bought versions I grew up with.  Very excited to have a new Passover staple.    I took the suggestion to dry them out after slicing.  I cut them about an inch thick and found I had to flip the cookies.  They dried out for about 20 minutes on each side.  I did not use the extra cinnamon and sugar as they were already sweet enough.  Next time I don't think I will put the cinnamon and sugar on top.    The other change was that I did not have matzah cake meal only matzah meal.  So I ground up the matzah meal in my coffee grinder before adding it to the recipe and it came out fine.

I usually hate mandelbread but this one is delicious! it's chocolaty and has a great texture- crunchy but not dry. Everyone loved them! I baked them for about 30 minutes, then sliced them, sprinkled more sugar and cinnamon on the sides and baked on each side for about 10 minutes each.

This is a keeper.  The mandelbrot was a huge hit with my family and is sure to be an annual favorite at our Passover meal.  I would suggest cutting the loaves as soon as they are removed from the oven, and then leaving them out for a few hours to cool/dry out.  Unless you were told, you wouldn't guess there was matzah meal in the recipe.  Delicious!

Outstanding!  This is a keeper!  I made two batches - the first I made 2 logs - the second time around, I made 3 logs.  I prefer the smaller mandelbrot.  
This is a great year round recipe.
Thanks for sharing!

"Best Mandelbrot I've ever had!" - a comment made by my calorie-conscious mother-in-law - with a compliment like that, how can anyone doubt this recipe?!  Seriously though - this recipe is a keeper - easy, tasty and makes enough to serve to a crowd.  Definitely make 3 loaves, bake it twice (10 minutes each side once sliced) and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.  The more crunchy the better!

Absolutely excellent - everyone raved, and this makes such a large amount that we ate it for several days.  The suggestion that you slice it and sprinkle with extra cinnamon/sugar and rebake was well worth the time - better than biscotti!

I made this for my Jewish relatives during Passover and it was a HUGE hit. I had to make a second batch because the first one was gone in two days. I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips, and didn't use nuts for allergy reasons (although I want to try them with almonds if I make this for a different crowd).   I also did what many reviewers suggested, and let the loaves bake for about 35 min, then sliced, sprinkled with more cinnamon/sugar, and returned to the oven for about 10 min on each side. I wasn't sure they were crunchy enough at that point, so I let them sit in the warm oven after I turned it off for a bit. Similar to biscotti, only better!

This recipe was yummy! It was like a cross between a toasted quickbread and biscotti. I made one batch with chocolate chips and walnuts and another dried cherries and almond slices. All my Jewish friends loved it and couldn't believe it was kosher for Passover!

The best ever Passover recipe I have tried!  I also cut the loaves into biscuits and browned them a bit on their sides to dry out.  Otherwise, you can't mess with perfection!

This recipe turned out very good even though I made a few mistakes with the help of my little kids.  I didn't have Matzo cake meal so I used regular Matzo meal.  I also accidentaly bought mini chocolate chips.  My kids turned the stove to broil about halfway through the normal cooking time.  I noticed the smell of smoke and never guessed that this had happened.  I ended up taking it out of the oven at this point and cutting off as much burned part as I could.  Even still the Mandelbrot was amazing.  My guest asked to take some home.  They showed me the next day that their children had only left crumbs.  Thanks for a good recipe.

this just came out of the oven and I couldn't help but take a taste, it was as good as all the other reviewers say it is.  I took the advice of the others and took out the bread at 35 minutes, let it cool, sliced it, and then sprinkled the cinnamon & sugar.  Then I put the bread back in the oven for a few minutes.  I can't wait for my guests to try it, thanks!

Just made this as a dessert after our seder. Wonderful!!! A+! There is definitely enough batter to make 3 loaves instead of two, as someone else suggested.

This was delicious. I will definately make this again. It was messy when it came time to form into loaves. I needed to do this right on the baking pan because it was too sticky to transfer. I cooked it the whole 55 minutes and it was fine. Probably cooking it a little less would have been better, however no one complained.

Delicious... I recommend checking for doneness after 45 minutes and every five minutes after that until the pick comes out clean.  According to my husband, this recipe only serves 2!!

This recipe is delicious! I am a newlywed, and this is our first Passover together. I have impressed both his family and mine with this mandelbrot! As other reviewers have noted, I cut them into slices when still warm from the oven. I will definitely be using this recipe for years to come! Thanks Joyce!

I made this recipe with just chocolate chips and it was great. Then I made it with only walnuts (2 cups) and it was even better! Everyone loves it! I find I'm making it still, even though Passover is long over.

My sister n law made these for pesach last year. These are fantastic you would never know they were kosher for passover.  She actually got the recipe out of the Canadian Jewish News and when I looked up the recipe in the archives it was this recipe. Do not hesitate to make these, you will not regret it!

IT IS DELICIOUS.  YOU SHOULD USE A MIXER MADE FOR CAKE OR BREAD, THE BATTER IS VERY HEAVY.
LOAVES SHOULD NOT BE TOO HIGH.

These were amazing !  I followed other reviewers suggestions.  I made these into 3 loaves instead of 2.  I baked for 35 minutes and then sliced them and turned them on their side.  Turned the temperature down to 250 and after sprinkling with more cinnamon/sugar, I dried them out for 15 minutes and then turned them over.  Sprinkled with more cinnamon sugar and another 15 minutes.  These were so delicious.  The next time I make them, I'm going to try the 3 loaves 3 different ways.  One loaf with the chocolate chips & cinnamon/sugar like the recipe calls for, the 2nd loaf with the chocolate chips but no cinnamon/sugar.  The 3rd loaf, without the chocolate chips but only the cinnamon/sugar. I'm especially looking forward to just the cinnamon/sugar alone.    Thank you Joyce for this amazing 5+ star recipe.

This is a great recipe! I've dried the loafs, after cutting them, in the oven for 50 min. It's a huge success!

This is a great recipe. Got plenty of compliments. Will make this again.
followed instructions and it turned out great, baked for 55 minutes.
It did not stick to the pan, I oiled the pan first. This is definitely a 5 star recipe.

I couldn't get my kids out of the dough.  Usually if the dough is good, the cookie is great!  And it was!  I will make this again soon!

What a wonderful delight.  I followed the recipe to the 't'.  This dessert wasn't too sweet. Thank you Joyce, for sharing your recipe.
