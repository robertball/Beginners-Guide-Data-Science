Love this recipe!  I actually saw this recipe in a Prevention magazine last year.  I folled the recipe listed here, but used ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg for the spices.  You have to put just a little bit of spices in, otherwise they are overwhelming.  Perfect with fat free Cool Whip on top!  I also like to put it in a graham cracker crust, freeze it, and serve it as a pie.  It is also good to mix the Cool Whip in when making it to lessen the spice flavor.  Very easy to make.

We really enjoyed this healthier alternative to pumpkin pie.  The flavor was almost identical to the standard Libby's pie recipe, but with fat-free evaporated milk, fat-free whipped cream and no crust, we felt much less guilty afterward!  Based on other reviews, we used 1/2 the amount of pumpkin pie spice that was called for, and it was just perfect.

I had a very bad experience with this recipe and ended up tossing the entire thing. The spices were a bit overwhelming. Also, I used pumpkin that I had prepared myself for use in pumpkin pies instead of canned pumpkin. All of my pies came out great but the pudding was terrible. If I had used the canned pumpkin I might have enjoyed it because the texture is probably a bit smoother (even though I pureed my pumpkin in the blender). I won't make this again.

This was so good! A really sweet dessert. Perfect if you like pumpkin pie and really tough to mess up. If you use prespiced pie filling it's even easier.

I made this and brought it to work for potluck.  Everyone loved it!  The second time I made it using butterscotch flavor pudding, and I almost died it was so good.

At first I didn't think it was going to be good, then I made it and tried and I like it.  It was pretty good, I just made it a little different, instead of 3.4oz of pudding I put 3.9oz, and a can of Evaporated milk plus 1/3c. of 2% milk, 09oz of pumpkin mix and 1/2 tbls of pumpkin pie spice.  But besides that I thougt it was wonderful and I'm using this recipe for my mid-term at school.

Thank you for adding this recipe!

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving feast in my 2 year old preschool class.  THis 
is a very easy recipe but I did not find that the kids were that crazy about the flavor.
The adults on the other hand, ranted and raved about it.  I had to give the recipe
to five of the moms and all of the teachers!  Thank goodness it was easy to remember!

I made this with sugar-free instant cheesecake pudding.  In place of the pumpkin spice, I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/8 tsp. ginger and 1/8 tsp. cloves.  I stirred in a tub of sugar-free cool whip.  I put it in mini graham cracker crusts.  Very good and quick.  My pumpkin loving family gave it, "thumbs up!"

Tastes too much like uncooked pumpkin pie filling.  If you modified the recipe like KATRINA02 suggested it would probably be better.  there was definitely not enough vanilla pudding mix and way too much pumpkin pie spice.  Perhaps adding a little bit of sugar would help too.  I won't ever make this again, although this was so simple and quick to make.

At first this came out tasting a little funky... definitely a two- star at that point. But after being refrigerated overnight with the Cool Whip on top of it jumped up to a three star :)

This tasted amazing and is very healthy. The only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of vanilla soy milk for the evaporated milk. I also reduced the amount of spice as suggested by others. I dipped graham crackers in it. YUMMY!

Really good. I used SF instant CHEESECAKE pudding mix, FF evaporated milk and homemade pumpkin pie spice. I LOVED this and really had to hold myself back from having another serving. My kids really loved this as well and my pumpkin-hating, low-fat avoiding husband ate all his and what remained. Oh, yes.....this is a keeper. SO simple.

I used fat-free, sugar-free cheesecake flavored instant pudding mix, 2 cups 1% milk, 1 cup of one-pie canned pumpkin, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon and it came out delicious! Use skim milk and top with fat free cool-whip to make it ultra healthy!

Love this but I also do it with a bit of a swist I actually forllow the recipe as directed but instead of the whipped cream on top I actually fold it into the mixture . It makes it lighter and fluffier almost like a mousse.

This recipe is incorrect in stating the amount of pumpkin pie spice to use.  If you look at Nestle's Very Best Baking website, the recipe there says to use (1) 5-1/10 oz pkg. of pudding mix and only 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  This will help to improve the taste very much!

I made this recipe for thankgiving and it was a hit! I used the additions suggested earlier with a little less pumpkin, and some additional milk. I also made it with half vanilla pudding and half butterscotch pudding and added half a container of cool whip to the actual mixture.

Absolutely HEAVENLY!!!  I love, love, love pumpkin pie and THIS IS EVEN BETTER!  I sincerely do not understand how anybody could give this less than 5**'s, especially if you love pumpkin pie.  It has fewer calories and less fat, too (I made it with fatfree evaporated milk and fatfree whipped cream on top-- and it was still extremely flavorfull and rewarding!) I only used 1/2 tbspn of the pumpkin pie spice, as others suggested.  This is PERFECTION.

Delicious.  Made even better with a dollop of mixed sour cream/sugar topping and a sprinkling of crushed ginger snaps.  

Cut the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tsp., not tbsp.

This was pretty good.  Very easy to throw together.  You can easily substitute skim milk for the evaporated milk.  I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon (our cinnamon was temporarily missing!).

I tried this wonderful pudding for a family dinner. Since some of the reviews were negative on the pumpkin pie spice, I replaced the spice with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. It turned out WONDERFUL, and I will definitely make this again and again!

A tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice is too much...use a teaspoon.  Also, make the day before you want to eat it because it's better really cold and by the 2nd day it had a chance to meld the flavors better.  I also added two small packets of Splenda to add a tad of sweetness.  Otherwise...yummy!

My husband was adamant that this would be a huge mistake, but the kids really wanted to try it - and once it was chilled, it was really good! We did cut the spices to half and the balance was just right for us.

Ugh!  And I fixed for dinner guests--how embarrassing!  The spices made it bitter and unpleasant-tasting.  My guests were polite but . . .  .  And I garnished it so pretty with whipped topping and nuts and gingersnaps.  Not to be repeated.  I regret not making "Upside Down Pumpkin Cake" instead.

This recipe was pretty good. I followed the instructions but the pudding didn't really thicken as much as I wanted it to. I ended up adding almost another 1/2 pkg. of vanilla pudding mix to it. I was also curious about using the evaporated milk instead of regular milk, but it worked. Thanks!

I wasn't too impressed. It WAS quick and simple, but seemed bland to me. I did use sugar free pudding. I also added pumpkin pie spice slowly since others said the spices were hard to get right. I felt like I either had to have it too bland or too spicy. 

I added a cup of cool whip at the end to try to sweeten this up. I'm probably not making this again...too bad, it seems like it has possibilities but I can't figure out how to fix it. Maybe another kind of pudding, like white chocolate?

A nice idea. The kids loved this and asked me to make more every day for a week. I thought the texture was a little gritty from the pumpkin pie mix.  The adults said it was pumpkin pie without the crust--and they are right. In any case, I had to make it again.

In my second attempt, I kicked around the concept of cooking the pumpkin and spice, which would alleviate any grittiness. However, one of the strengths of this recipe is its quick convenience. So, I decided to beat a 5.1 oz box of instant vanilla pudding with the 12 oz can of evaporated milk and then combine it with a 30 oz can of Libby's pumpkin pie mix, eliminating the pure pumpkin and pie spice.

The kids loved this version as well, and they said that it was creamier. (I didn't tell them that I made it differently.) I will make this again, as any time I can get the kids to eat more fruits and vegetables--although "sugared up" pretty well--I think I've come out ahead.

I agree with other reviewers - I can't believe anyone could give this anything but 5 stars! However, I almost made a big mistake - check your pudding package for the ounces. I had to use 2 packages (the smaller ones are about 1.5 oz). I'll be making this throughout November as a healthy, delicious dessert - I used 2% evaporated milk. This would also be great scooped into a graham cracker crust....I think I'll be trying that next! This is definitely for those that like Pumpkin Pie filling, but not the crust ;)

Had some leftover canned pumpkin from "Iced pumpkin cookies" on this website, found this recipe and was a great way to use the rest.  DIdn't have pumpkin pie spice, used mixture of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.
