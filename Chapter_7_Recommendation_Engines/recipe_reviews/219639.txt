I make this every once and a while to go with spaghetti or ravioli dinner. It's great because not only does it disappear fast but little hands can help make it, too. This is even better if you can sprinkle a little parmesan cheese over the top before baking and after you invert it onto a serving platter.

If you love herbs this is the recipe for you.  However I personally had to add 5 minutes to the baking time and I still could have baked it a couple more minues.  Also don't forget to crush the rosemary, I did forget and it was a little over powering, next time I won't forget!

Is there anything more annoying than a cook that substitutes  near everything and then gives the recipe a low-star rating? If you sub biscuits with bread dough, garlic powder for fresh, thyme for rosemary and bake it in a loaf pan, you have just created a NEW recipe! 
Whew. With that being said, this is a terrific little go-to when you don't want to knead and wait (like when you're using a sauce for leftovers) for fresh bread dough. Because of the unhealthfulness (New word there!) we limit the amount our little people eat, however it is very easy to just keep picking away at it. Without the appearance of a slice of bread, it's no problem at all to grab about 40 little knots and think it is the same serving size. 
Great recipe. Thanks!

I needed some kind of quick garlic bread tonight but had no french loaves or other bread to start with.  I came across this recipe and had everything on hand except for the dried parsley. I grabbed fresh parsley from the garden and threw this together. What a hit and less than 30 minutes from start to table!

Easy enough for kids to make and delicious - the whole pan was gone by the end of the meal, and we had leftovers of everything else.  It did take me 22 minutes to get a light golden brown on these, even in a slightly hotter oven.

This bread was really good!!  Simple to make, easy ingreadients, tasted great.  We made it the first time to go with a sweet viniagrette green salad with chicken, cherries, and candied walnuts, and it was gone!!  The only thing I might change is to make it with frozen bread dough, since we would prefer that texture to the biscuit dough.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Will make this again!!

Wow!  I sat down to write my review and looked over the recipe to see if I had done anything differently....I added tons of Parmesan cheese.  For some reason I thought that was in the recipe!   I cut the biscuits into small pieces, put them in a gallon size bag with the dry ingredients (and lots of Parmesan), then got them All Shook Up (hey, I am in Tennessee...)  I put the dry coated dough balls in the Bundt pan, then poured melted butter over the top.  My pan is pretty heavy duty, so it took forty minutes to bake, but the results were FABULOUS.   Every guest LOVED them, even the baby, who licked the cheese coating off the bread.  I will be making this again and again, and encourage you to make the same mistake I did by adding cheese!

Great the first time my 8 and 10 year old nieces assembled and baked. The second time, I assembled a few hours in advance and refrigerated but the bread did not rise much. Take Away: assemble and bake immediately.

Delicious!  I put some grated Parmesan cheese in the bottom of the pan before adding the biscuits which added a nice look on top and a nice taste.  I only need to cook this about 14 min in my oven.

We loved this. All I had on hand were two 7.5oz cans of biscuits so thats what I used. I cut each one into quarters and layered in the pan and followed the rest of the directions. I didn't add the leftover butter sauce (there was actually very little) because I was shy by 5oz of biscuit dough. Kids and adults both loved these will def be making this one again with different variations.

Loved it - I usually like to try recipes unmodified, but didn't have any crused rosemary, so added a teaspon of oregano, was almout out of butter, so used half olive oil and used 5 cloves of garlic.  Wow -  it reminded me of the oil/herbs you get at restaurants for dipping! Yum - my kids couldn't keep their hands out of it!

AMAZING!! This bread is so incredible â€” moist, fragrant, soft, and so flavorful. I didn't have biscuit dough so I used fresh bread dough (challah dough to be exact). We aren't rosemary fans, so I subbed oregano. And to keep it dairy free I used olive oil instead of butter. I served it with a big Greek salad and my entire family was raving.

I made this for dinner tonight with pasta and it is delicious. It is so easy to make but appears to take a lot longer. I will definitely be making this often. I made the recipe exactly as shown and would not change a thing. I think I will try it with butter, cinnamon and sugar next for a quick breakfast treat.

This was so easy and delicious. Everyone loved it! I don't own a bunt pan because I haven't learned how to keep things from sticking... :) I can never get the pan to release the baked goods perfectly. Anyways, I ended up using a different kind of baking dish ( don't judge but it was a casserole dish because it had higher edges), and everything still turned out great. The only con was that it required I cook it for a longer time. 30 mins

I even added more herbs than it said and it was still pretty bland. I think it needed salt, pepper, or some other seasoning.

Let me just start out by saying this recipe is great. Didnt change anything except I cut the biscuits into fourths and baked in a cupcake pan with a single biscuit worth of balls per cup to make portions easier. The biscuits I used was southern homestyle grands. The only thing keeping this from being a five star review is mine still had a slight biscuit flavor. Maybe if changed to a refridgerated pizza dough that can be resolved. But the seasoning and most importantly the amounts is spot on and leaves nothing to waste. Side of pasta sauce for dipping and what an appetizer! Thanks for sharing!!

This was very flavorful, although maybe a but too much garlic for my personal taste.  As other reviewers have stated the cooking time listed wasn't long enough.  I added an extra ten minutes after having read the reviews, but it still wasn't completely done.  I think the amount of butter could be reduced a bit as well without sacrificing flavor while at the same time reducing calories/fat.  All-in-al a good recipe that I'll be making again.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight as written except I halved the recipe and put it in a metal loaf pan. Was excellent as is.  Next time I will try adding a bit of grated parmesan. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

2 tsps rosemary is WAY too much, but that is a personal taste issue. It didn't get done in 20 minutes. We cooked it for 25 and it was still a little doughy but good. If I make it again it will be with little-to-no rosemary, 25 minutes cooking time, and some parmesan cheese.

Do not substituete with frozen bread dough buns. I gave it 4 stars only because the flavors, ingredients and method would likely result in a better outcome than my attempt.
The herb and garlic flavor was excellent.  I decided to substitute frozen bread dough (the buns) for the bisquits. The result was a bun that was a little too sweet for this savory seasoning.  If I were to attempt again, I would make some french bread dough in my breadmaker and use that.  There is a very good reason garlic bread is made with either French bread or Sourdough bread.

I made this with a basic white bread from scratch instead of the biscuit dough and about 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter to help cut down on the fat content.  It was good, but next time I'll use butter instead of olive oil. It was a little dry with that little olive oil. The family liked it fine.  Thank you for a nice change of pace for garlic bread!

So delicious! I made it for a party and it was such a hit! A little too buttery for my taste, so next time I make it I'll use less butter, but otherwise I definitely recommend this recipe. So easy and tasty!

This is a nice recipe that adds a lot of flavor to the typical store-bought, frozen variety. The kids don't necessarily like seeing the "grass" (i.e., rosemary) on their garlic bread, so I may half the rosemary next time just for visual appeal to the kids. Other than that, I think it's a great recipe.

I made it like the recipe stated and the bottom layer was super under cooked. I had to let it almost burn on the top to get the bottom layer done. Next time I will try dipping the biscuits in the herbs & spices and just pour the butter on the top.  It was good and we liked the flavor.

Not everyone liked this because they thought it had too many herbs and seasonings, but most of us really enjoyed it.   This was a super easy to make and tasty garlic bread that I will make again.   Due to the store not carrying the smaller tubes, I had to use the 16oz Grands.   I cut them each into 4 pieces before dipping into the butter mixture.   I only used one tube.   Thanks for a great recipe.

These were really good. I used  some compound/herb butter I had on hand and didn't add the garlic because the herb butter already contained some roasted garlic. I also added some Parmesan cheese and that really made them delicious! Will definitely make again

I'm not sure what the heck happened, but this recipe did NOT turn out for me. Guessing it was the pan I used, but it was still raw in the center way after the cook time was over. The part on the outside edges was great.

This is a really good recipe, the bread has a really good taste and it was easy to make. It is one of my sons favourites so i make it often. I have make a variant of this using cardamom and cinnamon instead the garlic and herbs and it makes a really nice semi sweet bread.

I have to  change my review, because this is not the original recipe for the Garlic and herbs pull apart bread that I saved a long time ago. It is so disappointing, I just moved to a new place and couldn't find my recipes notebook so obviously I came here to check out the recipe only to find that they changed it . The original one was made using dough from scratch and this one uses canned biscuit dough... So I have to take my 5 stars because I gave them to the original recipe not to this one.

This recipe is a keeper.  For convenience (plus I don't care for rosemary), I used 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. oregano, crushed & 1 tsp. basil, crushed, instead of the recipe's spices. I mistakenly bought 2-16.3 oz. cans of Pillsbury Grands (instead of the 10-oz. cans called for) so I had to bake 30 - 35 minutes in a Bundt pan.  I think the addition of parmesan in layers was a great idea & I plan to do that next time. I recommend adding a bowl of marinara sauce on the side for dipping.

Super good! I would give it 5 stars if not for the rosemary. Just felt like it didn't belong. It also needed more time in the oven, so plan for that and just check before flipping out of pan. (The bottom was still raw for me.) I used flaky biscuits- superb! I would definitely make this again.

These were pretty good, though I think I didn't put enough garlic in it as we really love garlic though I put 2 in at the last that were plain as I have 1 person who has a slight garlic allergy. I didn't have canned biscuits so made a double batch of AR recipe of Easy Biscuits. I added about 2 tsp of granulated garlic to the flour. (The garlic allergy is very slight.) Next time I need to add more flour to that recipe or use the canned biscuits as they took a really long time to get done. But  my husband thought they were worth the wait.

This was great. I used 1 can of the 8-ct jumbo biscuits, and instead of the separate seasonings I used Italian seasoning. And of course, being the astute individual that I am, I didn't realize I'd run out of garlic at home so I ended up using a generous shake of garlic powder. Really yummy!
