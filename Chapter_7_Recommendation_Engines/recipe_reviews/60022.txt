DELICIOUS! I did make a quite a few changes though. First, I sauteed some onion in with my ground beef. I used Mexicorn, and instead of the Miracle Whip, I used just over 1/2 cup of  fat free sour cream instead. I also used a packet of taco seasoning rather than the chili powder. In my pantry, there were some refried black beans I wanted to get rid of, and I figured this would be a good way to do that. Boy, was I right! I layered it on top of the beef mixture in my 9x13. For the crushed chips, I used Fritos rather than tortilla chips, and last but not least, I used 2 cups of Mexican cheeses rather than just Colby. In essence, I guess I changed almost everything about the recipe. LOL! But it was DELICOIUS! Ally

I have been looking for this recipe.  My mom used to make it when I was young.  But she passed away, and never had any of her recipes written down.  Suggestion:  The recipes your family loves please write them down so if one day something happens they will be able to re-create your delicious food, and have pleasant memories when eating it.

Um, HELLO!!! Of course this isn't real "Nachos"!  It says CASSEROLE in the title....honestly, this is pretty good, but do sub. sour cream for the Miracle Whip.

I really wish people would review recipes AS THEY ARE WRITTEN. If I see you put as the first word DELICIOUS I assume the recipe is really good. But then I go through it and everything about the recipe has been changed...use some common sense people. Review the recipe as it is and then maybe state what you did differently.

I tried this recipe but made a few alterations.  First, I substituted ground beef with ground turkey.  Always a healthier choice.  Then I replaced chili powder with 2 tbsp. of taco seasoning.  I also reduced the salsa to 1 cup & added 1 can of black beans in with the corn.  Instead of 3/4 mayo I used 1/2 cup of sour cream & 1 heaping tbsp. of mayo.  Once complete, this was really easy to make and so good!  I totally loved it!  My husband said it tasted like Nachos Grande.  It's also is a good recipe if you have broken up pieces of nacho chips left at the end of a bag.  I found the smaller more crumbled up pieces filled it in great.
Thanks for the new recipe!

I used Rotel instead of salsa and did not add corn. I seasoned the beef with taco seasoning and cooked a chopped onion and garlic to the meat while browning it. I also used half sour cream and half mayo. Very easy to make and the bf loved it.

I agree with another review.  This is ridiculous that people rate recipes according to how they completely modify it from the original.  Please follow the original recipe first and then make suggestions!!!

This is a casserole but it is definitely not nachos.  Miracle Whip has no place in Nachos, and neither does corn.

Loved it. After reading all of the other reviews, I made some changes - I added onion to my ground chuck, used 1/2 cup Miracle Whip and 1/4 cup sour cream, 2 tsp. chili powder and 2 tsp. of Tastefully Simple's "Fiesta Party Dip" mix (it was what I had on hand!) and Nacho Cheese Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips. The whole family loved it, it was quick and easy and will certainly be made again!

This was pretty good. I used sour cream instead of mayo, taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, and Barbecue Fritos instead of tortilla chips. Hubby is now on his 3rd bowl. It would be really good with some refried beans and put inside a warm tortilla!

We really liked this one!  I had to change it for what I had, I used a can and a half of Rotel instead of salsa (drained it a little bit) and used cheddar cheese.  A keeper for sure.  Next time I might sub Ranch Dressing for the mayo just to kick it around it a bit.  VERY yummy!

This was delicious and simple to make.  I did make the following changes: 1) Added a packet of taco seasoning to the beef 2) Added a chopped onion to the ground beef while cooking 3) Used sour cream instead of the mayo.  You would think the chips get soggy, but they don't!  This tastes just as good leftover too!

Hubby and Son whom I made this for liked it very much. I tasted it before baking and I was just a tad put off by the over powering taste of salad dressing. But didn't say nothing to them. Baked and out of the oven. It was nicer in flavor then it was before I put it in. But will say, it was a tad runny and could totally use less salad dressing and more spice. I had to use Cool Ranch Dortios because hubby ate the plain ones. Go figure. However, I totally liked this best next morning out of the frig...it had that nice casserole flavor and I liked it better cold. But I would make again with adjustments of less salad dressing, more chili powder and more crushed chips.

My kids loved this! My daughter said she may even have me make this for her Birthday dinner instead of going out to a restaurant to eat. Wow...that's a real compliment. :) From other suggestions, I cooked an onion with the ground beef, used 1/4 C mayo and 1/2 C of sour cream for the mixture, and used 2 TBSP of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder. Great recipe, thanks!

Just finished eating another bowl of this a few minutes ago.  VERY, VERY good and super easy to make. I made a couple of substitutions, however, because I wanted to use up some stuff in the fridge and lighten the fat and calorie factors.  

First, I used up some turkey/beef mix I was saving in the freezer to make burgers later.  It had some onions, garlic, salt & pepper, and some gluten free bread crumbs in it. Then I used a packet of Simply Organic Southwest Taco mix instead of just the chili powder, a 6oz container of 0% fat free Greek style yogurt with about 2 tbsp of organic full fat sour cream, a mix of purple tortilla chips and baked lentil-azuki bean chips (got these from Trader Joe's--the lentil chips actually stayed crispier than the tortilla chips), frozen corn and some freshly chopped zucchini that needed to be used, only 1 cup salsa, and lower fat, shredded mexican style cheese.  

The result was all yums!  Leftovers for dinner and lunch tomorrow!  Hooray.

I don't think I'd make this as written, but it's a good base recipe. I could only give it 3 stars because I made a lot of changes,which were excellent. I filled a 9x13 pan with layers, baking at 350 for the same amount of time directed. 

First, I used approx. 2.5 lbs hamburger (that was the size it came in), cooked with a lg chopped onion, 2 pkts taco seasoning, water, salt, pepper, dried diced garlic, and cayenne pepper. To that, I added (still on heat) 2 cans drained corn, 2 cans black beans (not drained), 1 can diced green chiles (not drained), and approx. 1.5 cups each of medium and mild chunky salsas. Since the pan's contents already had created a nice sauce, I added 1 c. plain Greek yogurt (unnecessary)(I wanted to save my sour cream for serving on top). I didn't want to use Miracle Whip, which sounded greasy and gross. I took the opportunity to use up 3 bags worth of tortilla chip crumbs (you know, the little pieces toward the end of the bag that are too little to dip) that I had been saving for an occasion like this.  I layered twice as directed (meat mixture, chips, cheese), using about 6 cups of various shredded cheeses (sharp cheddar, taco blend, pizza blend, etc.)(wanted to use up a few opened packages).  All of this filled my 9x13 pan.  I served it cut into large squares with a large dollop of sour cream and some salsa.  My teenage son and my parents raved over it, looking forward to any leftovers. I must say, it was absolutely delicious.  I'll make this again!!

My husband loved this. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions but I don't think some of the changes should be made..... 
I used rotel tomatoes instead of salsa. Next time I will defiantly use salsa.
I used taco seasoning and chili powder abt 1.5tbs.
I added black beans and had to use frozen corn since I didn't have any canned corn. 
Instead of the creamy salad dressing, I used 3/4cup of fat free plain yogurt and about 2tbs of light sour cream. It tasted great (I don't care of plain fat free yogurt by itself) but I would like it a little creamier. So I will probably use 1/2c yogurt and 1/2cup sour cream since the sour cream is thicker. 
I cooked green onions with the ground turkey.
All in all it was very good. I think it would be great exactly as the recipe is written but I wanted to make it a little healthier. By the way, the chips stated crunchy. I was afraid they would get soggy but they didn't.

To a previous reviewer - I was given some very good advice a long time ago:  "Never try a new recipe, for the first time, when you are in a hurry, or making it for company.  Something will go wrong about 99% of the time!"

The only change I made was added a layer of refried beans.  My 3 year old practically licked her plate!  Will be making again, with the beans.

SOO GOOD! I did a couple of things differently such as using sour cream instead of Miracle Whip & didn't have any chili powder on hand. Made some beans & cheese, & mexican rise for the sides. Hmmm. It was the best homemade mexican dinner!

Well I make some changes due to diet restrictions--low fat, low sodium and no MSG. It's still a good recipe. I added cumin, garlic powder and onion powder and occasionally throw in some pinto or kidney beans for fiber or instant brown rice if the low sodium chips have been eaten already. It's easy, fast, filling and relatively cheap and leftovers are great the next day, if there are any leftovers. Sorry I can't eat it as written but guess it one of prices you pay if you live long enough.

Recently found a 'natural' sour cream at Kroger. It's very low sodium so I use instead of regular sour cream or salad dressing.

I used less mayo and salsa than the recipe called for mainly because I didn't have enough ha! And added jalapeno's to the meat mixture. I liked this more as I ate it but initially wasn't a huge fan. Next time I will try half sour cream and half mayo. Maybe add some chili!

Yum! Subbed taco seasoning for chili powder and sour cream for mayo. Love it. Wish I had thrown in some onion and pepper, but still really good. Hit with the kids!

Editing to add: made it a third time today, but had no sour cream and didn't feel like going to store, so I used mayo, even though it still sounds weird to me. But it is just as good! Did a layer of refried beans between the meat and chips layer and threw some green onion, green pepper and leftover corn on top. Yum! Looks pretty too! :)

I give this one only 4 stars because of all the modifications. The base idea was great though. I used a can of rotel, 3/4ths cup of sour cream, and taco seasoning instead of chili powder. I also used turkey instead of beef to cut calories, and sauteed a clove of garlic and 1/2 cup of onion with the turkey. In addition, I used 2 small corn tortillas for a top layer with a thin layer of cheese to help bring out the flavor of the tortilla chips and it was awesome!

This is a supereasy and tasty recipe.  I made one substitution just to make it healthier.  I substituted nonfat greek yogurt for mayo.  I also used baked tortilla chips.  I didn't have colby cheese so I used cheddar instead and it was super yummy!

I thought this was very good. My husband liked it as well. I don't think I would change anything about it. Except definitely use sour cream instead of miracle whip.

After reading the reviews from this site, I made the following changes.  First, I skipped the corn altogether (my husband despises it, and I wasn't in the mood to argue with him!)  I used 1/2 cup lite Miracle Whip and 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream; I finely chopped some onion and grated 2 cloves of fresh garlic, then added them to the cooking ground beef; I used a combination of reduced-fat cheeses (I think any types of cheese that you and your family like would work just as well here.)  I  also crushed 2 cups of Nacho Cheese Doritos for this, but next time, I think I will use barbecued Fritos (if only there were low-fat Doritos and Fritos, we'd have it made!)  Even with my attempts to make this dish a lower fat recipe, it was absolutely delicious! My husband had two large helpings, and the rest of the family polished it off!  Thank you, Lunch*Lady for submitting such a quick, easy and delish recipe!

I took so many suggestions from other reviewers, that the only ingredient that remained the same in this recipe was the ground beef. 

These were my substitutions:  1 can Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilis), 1 can Fiesta or Mexicorn, 3/4 sour cream, 1 packet taco seasoning, 2 cups corn chips, 2 cups mexican shredded cheese.  It had a little zip to it, but if our 2 year old wasn't eating it, I would have used "hot" taco seasoning.  My husband and I topped our servings with sour cream and jalepeno slices with extra corn chips on the side.  We both had seconds.  This will be made again and again!  I give my recipe 5 stars!  Thanks reviewers!

Made this for lunch today and it was AWESOME!  I added commerical taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I had some leftover Black Beans, Corn and Yellow Rice (recipe here on AR) so I added that as one of the layers instead of just corn.  I used a Mexican cheese blend for the cheese and Hint of Jalapeno tortilla chips.

excellent recipe.  I used the sour cream like other reviewers recommended, and I also added a can of green chilis.  I used medium hot southwestern style salsa, with corn and black beans, which really added some extra chunkiness and heat.

This was great and easy.  I made it vegetarian by substituting refried beans and black beans for the beef.  Will be making this again.

This recipe was a good starting point for me.  I changed quite a bit and it turned out okay.  Not anything to make when I want to impress but it was pretty tastey.  Some of the changes were out of convenience/health and some where preference.
I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I didn't use salsa at all.  I used no fat sour cream instead of mayo (it just sounded too weird!).  I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I used whole grain chips, which I would probably change if I made this again.  And lastly I added 1 can of fat free refried beans.  There was about 2 cups of the beef mixture left over and I used that to dip tortilla chips in later.  My concoction turned out pretty well.  Good luck!

O.K. - I made some changes (I always do), so I rated it w/ the changes I made.  First, I despise Miracle Whip, so I substituted with ½ cup of sour cream and ¼ cup of spicy ranch dressing (Hidden Valley makes it).  I cooked the beef with onion and substituted the chili power w/ taco seasoning & cilantro. I added black beans, black olives, and green chilies; for the salsa I used ½ cup of jarred salsa and then ½ cup of homemade salsa with ingredients right from my friend’s garden (fresh cilantro, red onion, garlic & tomatoes)- so that salsa will be hard to recreate again, BUT it really added something to the dish.  Finally, I sprayed the entire mixture with fresh lime juice and a bit of red pepper flakes. I used Mexican blend cheese and the “hint of lime” tortilla chips.  It got good reviews from the fam. It also makes a great dish to take for lunches throughout the week. Also, if you take out the chip layer, it could easily be a layered chip dip.  Thanks so much for the idea!!!

Great meal. I took Ally's suggestions an added whole black beans, replaced the miracle whip (never cared for) with sour cream and used Colby jack and mexicorn and added onions to the burger. The suggestions always help. I'm glad I read them before I start a recipe!

My whole family of nine loved this which is a difficult assignment in itself.  I didn't bake it, as we don't use the oven in the summer, but it (doubled recipe with added black beans) turned out great in the crockpot on low for about five hours (I think).  Used 2/3 sour cream and 1/3 mayo.  My opinion because the chips absorbed whatever liquid was in there, it turned out with the consistency of tamales. Great recipe!  Will make again!

A good alternative to just plain nachos for dinner. :-) I used ground turkey, whole grain chips, and subbed sour cream per other reviews. Also halved the ingredients and it fit well in an 8x8 pan. Next time I plan to add black beans, more spices, and use more finely grated cheese.

Very yummy and smells great while cooking too!  Instead of the corn, I added 1 can of drained black beans to the meat, and used sour cream instead of the mayo.  Along with the chili powder, I added about 1.5 tsp of garlic powder and a pinch or two of salt.  I used the nacho flavored shredded cheese and topped the casserole with chopped chili peppers.  Great quick meal!

This casserole was so simple to make.  Under 30 minutes!!  I replaced the mayo with SOUR CREAM (only 1/2 cup) and the taste was much more in line with a mexican meal.  I also used a taco seasoning packet to give it my pizazz and diced up black olives because I had them.  I also offered additional chips on the side.  This would also be a great party dip!

This made a good comfort food dish.  Quick and easy, it's perfect for a middle of the week kind of meal.  I did make changes however - mainly due to what I had in the kitchen.  I used hot salsa, added a packet of hot taco seasoning (w/o water) to the beef, as well as some garlic powder.  I didn't have any corn (travesty, really) and used colby-jack cheese.  Yummy!

This was good but could be better.  Next time I will use sour cream instead of Miracle Whip.  The Miracle Whip gave it a funny sweet taste.  As others suggested, I might try taco seasoning instead of chili powder.

My husband and son (age 16) liked this a lot.  To me it was just okay.  However, I liked it a lot better by putting it on a bed of shredded lettuce!

I'm rating this recipe as it is written.  We are not fans of Miracle Whip.  I didn't follow all the ingredients so I give it 3 stars.  But as I prepared it, I give it 5 stars all the way!!!!  This was so delicious.  My family LOVED it.  Especially one of my picky eaters.  Even the other picky eater tried it, and that was a huge step for him.  But I made some adjustments to fit our palates.  I didn't use corn, Miracle whip, or chili powder.  Instead, I used lean ground turkey, 1/2 chunky salsa and 1/2 mild taco sauce to my liking (not sure of the measurements, but I didn't want it runny).  I used about 2 heaping Tbsp of fat free sour cream and 2 heaping Tbsp of plain greek yogurt.  I used 1 packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning, and Mild cheddar and Monterey Jack shredded cheese.  When I layered it, I started with the crushed chips, meat sauce, cheese.  Then chips again, meat sauce, a few finely crushed chips, then cheese and topped it off with some sliced black olives.  This will definitely be our new "Taco Tuesday" dish.  YUMM-O!!!!

This is similiar to a recipe that was a favorite of our boys when they were young.  I use ranch dressing instead of mayo/salad dressing and like it much better.  Pepper jack cheese works well too or any leftover graded cheese you have in the frig.

This was good, the whole family liked it.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used sour cream in place of salad dressing.  I tasted the meat mixture before assembling the casserole and found that I wanted more seasoning.  Added Mexene and cumin a little at a time until I was happy with it.  The biggest change I made was omitting the corn only because I had fresh corn on the cob I had planned to serve.  I will certainly make this again and will include the corn.  Thanks!

Omitted corn & added onion and spices when browning meat.  Added beans and subbed reduced fat sour cream for mayo.  Layered meat mixture, refried beans, chips, cheese.  Served w/ jalapeño slices.  Yum!  4 stars instead of 5 b/c as written, it is much less healthy than it could be.  Without sacrificing flavor, this could be fairly healthy w/ lowfat products and only layering once allows you to reduce the amounts of chips and cheese.  Thanks for a recipe the whole family enjoyed.

The recipe would have been good but the Miracle Whip was overwhelming...I feel that you should rate recipes as written.  I will try this again but follow other's advice and use sour cream in place of the Miracle Whip.

Not bad, not real exciting either.  The flavor is OK.  I ususally don't fault that to the recipe, as I cannot smell.  Not being able to smell, diminishes my taste ability to sweet, salty, bitter, or sour.  But DH and DD thought it didn't have much flavor either.  Thanks!

I love it. I use ground turkey instead of beef. I use a half of jar of taco sauce instead of salsa and 1/4 cup of miracle whip. I add cumin, onion powder, garlic powder and chili powder because ground turkey requires a lot more seasoning than beef. I serve this with salad on the side or a vegetable. Yum.

1 tsp of chili powder is not enough seasoning. I added extra cumin, chili powder, paprika and pepper. I used half mayo / sour cream. I couldnt taste either so dont be afraid to use mayo! Loved the corn in it too. We had whole grain nacho chips. They have loads of flavour too.  This is a good family size casserole.

This is such an afforadable dish that will keep well if your family doesn't mind leftovers (and I like to have them for my lunches at work). Very yummy, quick economical dinner on those worknights when you want a quick meal.

Yummy!  I made some last minute changes because while I was making it I found out I was having extra people for dinner!  I doubled everything, but was out of ground beef.  I thawed some pulled pork and added it.  I also added 1 cup of black beans and topped it with olives.  The casserole was almost gone in a matter of minutes!

My husband and I just tried this recipe. It is really good and super easy. I followed some of the suggestions and used 3/4 cup sour cream instead of mayonnaise, 1 packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and a packet of shredded Mexican cheeses instead of colby cheese. It was really good and only took us about 30 minutes to make.

I like this recipe. The nachos give the dish great texture, and if you have kids helping you in the kitchen, they can help crush the chips. Also, the corn is a good addition to the meat mixture. It makes the meat layer more filling without as much meat. Also good for color too. All in all, this dish was fun to make, serve, and enjoy, and my husband liked it better than Ortega's enchilada casserole that I used to make about once a month. One other plus...I liked that this recipe called for salsa rather than enchilada sauce because sometimes my grocery store doesn't have enchilada sauce in stock, and it's never a bad thing to have leftover chips and salsa. Yum.

I made several changes myself: I added sour cream instead of Miracle Whip (gross), fresh cilantro, cumin, chili powder, taco seasoning, red pepper flakes, and a can of refried beans into the mixture.  I used Kraft's Taco Cheese instead of colby, as well.  I topped it off with sliced black olives and fresh tomatoes, placed foil on the top, and baked for 25 minutes.  YUM!  Definitely will make again!  All my friends LOVED it.

Very good! I used a cheesy taco packet after browning the meat. Then I used sour cream instead of the mayo after reading reviews. This was a hit with the whole family.

This is really pretty good, with some adjustments.  Kilty, give it a break, nobody said a thing about it being from Mexico.  I used taco seaoning, sour cream, and chili beans.  Also, some hot sauce on the side.  A cold beer is also a good idea.

My family loves this recipe!  I decrease the mayonnaise and add a can of black beans (rinsed well) for extra nutrition.  We like spicy so I combine hot and medium salsas and add a bit of hot taco sauce too!

We really liked this! However, I couldn't bring myself to put mayo in a "nacho" casserole....so I used SC. YUMMY! I used lower fat cheese.....which I WON'T do next time because it doesn't properly melt! An 8x8 pan is the perfect size. Thanks!

My family REALLY enjoyed this dish! My husband loves tacos, but I hate the mess. With this casserole, we both got what we wanted! Our 14 year old Loved it too!  I used sour cream instead of the salad dressing, taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, sauteed an onion with the beef, and added 1/2 can of black beans. I also had some leftover taco shells, so I crunched them up instead of using tortilla chips (I saved the chips for the leftover salsa!). The shells got soft, but not soggy - I thought it was perfect. This will definitely quite often take the place of "taco night" in my house! Thanks!!!

I made some changes after reading reviews.  I used Rotel Tomatoes, black beans, corn, taco seasoning mix and sour cream and mayo. I did not use the chips in the layers, just cheese.  I know I changed a lot but if I had never read this recipe, I would never have made it, so thank you for the recipe.  I will make this again.

Delicious!  Took other reviewer's suggestions and used lite sour cream instead of mayo, and used rotel instead of salsa.  Also added a layer of refried beans on the bottom.  Yum!!! Will definitely make again!

And one small corn sweet corn   Pico de gallo mix   Real bacon bits bout 1/4 cup.   Layered just like recipe but broke up chips for top layer then added shredded cheese........ Topped it off with a few nacho chips, olives, sour cream .........was delicious

This was excellent, my husband loved it.  Only addition I made was to add fresh cilantro to the last layer.  Definately making this again.

Great dish! Easy to prepare and hit with the kids! I also changed some things around. I used a taco seasoning pack, Mexican corn, sour cream and miracle whip.

I made this one night in a pinch when I had nothing planned for dinner.  I used light ranch dressing in place of the creamy salad dressing, and it was quite tasty simple recipe!

This was easy after gardening all day and I usually have browned ground beef in the freezer. I did mix a little Ranch dressing with the mayo. I told my boyfriend that it reminded me of something you would get in a school cafeteria LOL. Easy and quick enough and I always have the ingrediants on hand.

LOVE THIS! Why do people rate stuff when they don't follow the recipe?  If you are one of those people that MUST change everything about the recipe, I suggest making it as is, then putting extras to the side.  This if fast, cheap - totally easy.  And the mayo gave it the unique flavor.  For that, I give it 5 stars.  I would definitely make this again.  My boyfriend added beans, rice, hot sauce, etc... I personally thought it was good just the way it was.  However, it serves as a good base, and you can add to it what you prefer.  Again - the mayo gave it enough zing that I did not think it needed anything extra.

My 6 year old and I loved it!  I combined just a few tips from other's advice...I used sour cream instead of mayo, and about a 1/2 pack of taco seasoning instead of chili powder....came out absolutely perfect!  My son is not the pickiest eater, but we had another favorite taco bake/casserole that he loves, and he was very skeptical of the corn in this one - but said he loves this one just as much!  I'm so happy to have something a little different!

This is delicious!  We have had it several times and love it!  It is also good as nachos - just prepare the beef mixture & heat through, put it on your tortilla chips, top with cheese and bake until cheese is melted.  Very yummy!

AN Awesome way to spice up a ground beef recipe! I added sliced Olives & Sourcream to each individual serving. PLUS I added an extra teaspoon of Chili Powder! I think it made all the difference!!

This is a great easy recipe that is pleasing to adults and kids.  I make this when my family wants a change from tacos or burritos, and it is always a hit.  Even the leftovers get eaten.  The only changes I made were using taco seasoning instead of chili powder and sour cream in place of the mayo (my family does not eat mayo).  Great find on this site for an easy meal.

This is OK for being so easy, but I would definitely try some of the other reviewers recommendations before I would try it again. I will try to substitute the mayo for sour cream, try taco seasoning instead of chili powder and cover the casserole when in the oven so that the cheese doesn't turn hard.

I'm sorry to give this such a low rating. I love nachos and was really excited about trying this. Followed recipe exactly (except did saute onion with meat)  and found there was too much meat and not enough of everything else. It was dry and very bland. Not sure if I'll try it again.

My husband and I both liked this one.  Easy and quick to prepare on a weeknight.  I followed some comments and used less mayo, otherwise I followed the recipe, as I like to do at least the first time.  May try adding pinto beans next time.

Didn't actually try this dish myself, but my family gave me 5 star responses:) EVERYONE had seconds, MOST had thirds, and SOME had fourths. They all loved it and couldn't stop telling me thank you for making it. This was so simple to prepare. I used a big cookie sheet that had slightly raised sides and just spread the meat layer, crumbled the chips over it, and topped  with all the cheese. This made it a little bit faster than layering it. I used 2-1/2lbs ground beef, a cup of salsa and a can of diced tomatoes w/chilies, 2-1/2 cups frozen corn, 1-1/2 cups ranch dressing, some taco seasoning, 4 cups of crushed tortilla chips, and 2 cups of cheese(ran out). The only thing I would probably do different next time is to add some onions, mix extra cheese into the meat mixture, and use sour cream. This one will definitely become a regular at our house. Thanks for sharing!! Oh, and be careful not to leave in the oven to long because the cheese gets really hard which makes it difficult to cut.

This was yummy! I did add onions to the browning meat with garlic powder. Then after I drained the meat, I added fajita seasoning to it. I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 2 tbs of mayo. Then I used Doritos instead of plain chips and followed the rest of the recipe. This was very good. All 5 family members loved it! Thanks!

This is yummy, delicious, tasty and fun to make with the kids. For something different we used the frozen fajita chicken (thawed & from HEB) instead of beef, also the taco seasoning instead of chilli powder, kids just don't dig spicy. We used the light sour cream (for my thighs). Served it with a side of pico de gallo, tossed with shredded lettuce. This is a keepa!

Delicious! Everything my husband and I like to eat in one easy meal! We did add black beans to the beef mixture though. I think that in the future I would add more spice to the mixture, in the form of garlic, onion and diced green chili peppers. A great weeknight meal!

Wonderful dish!  I put in one can of Rotel instead of salsa and put in 6 tablespoons of sour cream and 6 tablespoons of miracle whip.  Everything else I did the exact same.  Kids loved it. I loved it.  Husband loved it.

This was pretty good for a quick meal. I didn't use the corn (not in the mood) and used about one cup sour cream. I think the addition of either black beans or refried beans would be tasty and will try next time. It wasn't thoroughly heated after 20 minutes however and I only got 3 generous servings. All in all, a good dish when time and ingredients are short. Thanks

What a Winner!! This was so good. The adults in the household loved it just as much as the kids. I did use ground turkey for a more healthier approach and added a pack of taco seasoning to the pan when I browned the meat. Finally, I added jalopenos, black olives, and green onions to the meat mixture. Following others suggestions, I used only 1 tbsp of mayo and added sour cream instead. I also omitted the corn since I didn't have any on hand. Finally to enhance the taste I added pico de gallo seasoning to the ground meat mixture and served the finished dish with a dollup of sour cream and guacomole.

This was awesome!  As others suggested, cooked an onion with the ground beef and used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  Also, omitted the mayo.

This was pronounced a "keeper" recipe by most of the family.  Next time I would sub sour cream for the mayonnaise to make it less sweet, but that's the only change I would make.

This is so, so good!  The whole family loved it, and we finished the pan in one meal.  Next time I'll double the recipe.  I also think this would be good if you used black beans to stretch the meat a little.  Would also be cheaper to make that way!

I love this recipe and have been making it for a variety of people for the past 2 years.  I do make a few changes to the recipe depending on what I have on hand.  I normally use medium salsa instead of mild, and use just plain cheddar cheese instead of the colby or montery.  I also found it really nice to use taco or fajita seasoning instead of the chili powder.

Very good. In San Antonio where I'm from this is made all the time it's called Southwest Caserole (you can do it with chicken too) it's delish. We ALWAYS put corn in our nachos as well, it's a southwest thing.

After reading the reviews, thought I'd try this. 

Very tasty, and easy. I did make a couple changes. I used sour cream, about 1 1/2 tsp chili powder and a 15 oz can of corn. I also sauted onion, garlic and green pepper with beef.

We thought it was very good.  Kids ate it, too!

Nice tasting dish.  Used plain yogurt with a 1/4 cup of reduced fat mayo for the salad dressing. Kids do like it.  Added reduced fat sour cream to the finished product.  Yum

This was a very good, inexpensive to make casserole, I also used Rotel as I only had a small amount of salsa on hand so it was not as flavorful (I should have read more reviews and used taco seasoning also), but all in all everyone enjoyed!!

I have been making this for months now and it is delicious.  My toddler LOVES it.  I use taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and sour crean instead of miracle whip. I also use Colby and Jack cheese and use WAY more than the recipe calls for!!!  This is one of those recipes you can change up to suit your taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was good.  I added onion and minced garlic to the meat mixture.  Instead of chili powder, I used taco seasoning and then layered black beans on top of the meat.  I didn't have sour cream or mayo available and used Ranch dressing instead.  The Ranch was overpowering and I ended up adding more salsa to dilute the Ranch taste.

If I'd made this as written, I know we would have found it really boring, so I made the following adjustments: sauteed some diced onions and added it to browned ground beef; added a little taco seasoning, some ground cumin and some red pepper flakes to the meat; used roughly crushed Ranch-flavored chips; topped it off with a combination of extra-sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. It turned out pretty good!

This was just okay. The tortills chips get soggy and would make more sense just putting them in the bottom of the bowls people are eating out of. It didn't have much flavor either. It's a good base recipe, something to add tons of flavor to and try diffrent combos of ingredients.

This is a good recipe and so easy. I made my 15yr old make it as punishment and serve me for a change! Haha! He made it with ease. We left out the mayo, used mexican cheese and frozen corn. Served with sour cream and jalapenos.

Yummmmm...I incorporated previous suggestions and added one of my own.  I substituted sour cream for mayo, added a can of pinto beans, and instead of the 1 teaspoon of chili powder I used the allrecipes.com recipe for taco seasoning 1 (1/2 of the original recipe or 5 servings).  My beef was 1.25 lbs and with the additional beans I used a 3 quart dish and increased the chips and cheese to cover the layers.  Next time I will add a half cup of salsa and a 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I will definitely do this again!  Move over tacos!

My family loved this recipe and i've added it to my recipe box. I followed suggestions and added a can of pinto beans (rinsed, used taco seasoning and all sour cream and no mayo. It didn't get hot enough, next time I will bake longer and add the chips and cheese on the top at the end.

My teenage son and his friends LOVE this dish.  Another way to fix it is to accidentally forget to put in the Tortilla Chips and just use this dish as a dip for the chips after it's baked. :)  It's very good either way!

This was so good.  My husband loved it and asked for a frequent repeat of this dinner.  I added shredded chicken and refried beans, as well as, the beef. My boys ate it up.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

I liked this recipe and so did the family., However, I did make a few changes...  For 1 I used sour cream with a tb spoon mayo just for the added element, 2 I decided to go with a smoother salsa and also added refried beans into the mixture... This made the dish taste super authentic..Will definately make this recipe again!!

This was really good I used sour cream instead of mayo. I also put in Ranch-style beans. I really liked it and I am a picky eater.

I thought this was great.  The Miracle Whip definately gave it a "tangy zip."  Good flavor and filling.  Top with a little sour cream and hot sauce and your good to go.  Quick and easy.  I just added in a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder, etc.

Everyone loved the recipe.  Next time I will use sour cream and salad dressing instead of so much salad dressing.  Also tried chili powder and taco seasoning and it turned out great.

This was pretty good, although I did make some changes becuase I didn't have everything on hand.  I didn't have enough salsa so I added a little bit of tomato juice.  I also thought that it had a little too much of a mayo flavor so next time I would maybe do half mayo and half sourcream.  I also added a little cumin and cayenne.

My family loved this and my husband cooked it! He left out the corn, we added sour cream and tomato as toppings, used lite Miracle Whip, and used a combo of colby jack and cheddar cheeses. My 2 year old, who eats nothing mexican but bean burritos, loved it. Will definitely  make again. For more "kick" try a spicier salsa. I also like the dip idea.

This is very good and pretty easy to make. Use a spicier salsa than you normally would. I tend to like mild salsa, but I used medium in this recipe and it was just perfect.

DH and I LOVED this dish!  The salad dressing gave it great zip and the dish had good flavor.  The leftovers were a little disappointing because the chips got soggy, but still good with fresh crumbled on top. This will be made again and again!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used a 16 oz can of corn because that's what I had.  I loved it, and would really like to make it again.  My little sister however said there was too much mayo in it.  My mother and I loved it as is though, but I suppose substitution ranch for miracle whip would be a nice variation.

Made it tonight.  Made some substitutions as suggested in previous reviews.  Rotell for Picanta and added taco seasoning as well as chili pepper.  All ready had requests to make it again.  It was simple and quick to make.  Oh, I also added sliced black olives and cheddar cheese along with Colby cheese.

I omitted the corn, added black beans, and a layer of refried beans.  Like others I substituted sour cream for mayo and taco seasoning for chili powder.  I used whole wheat tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it.  Easy meal for a busy night, thanks for the recipe

I used 15 oz hominy injstead of corn and reduced the cheese to 1.5 c.  For my salad dressing, I used yogurt mixed with ranch dressing mix.  The only change I would make is to add more corn/hominy.

This recipe is great! I tried it as it states and then made a few changes. I did half sour cream and half mayo the second time and it seemed to be better that way. When it seemed like it was missing something I added the black beans that was suggested and that did it. Also adding onion and garlic while frying the ground beef adds that touch to finish it off. I'm going to try the taco seasoning to see if that makes it even better if that's possible! The bf loves this!

Pretty good dish, family liked it more than I did but you can add ingredients to make it to your own liking. I decided to only do half the mayonnaise and replaced the rest with sour cream.

I loved this! I tweaked it a little; adding sour cream instead of miracle whip, and my husband and I loved it! The only thing I would change in the future is the length of time in the oven...20 minutes was a little too long and the top layer of cheese was a little too hard. But otherwise delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This was a last minute dinner decision - worked out well because I had an open bag of tortilla chips and ground beef in the fridge.  Added onion to the browning ground beef, used some taco seasoning along with the chili powder and added a can of black beans.  Someone said, "It's like Mexican lasagna" and I served it with Mexican-style rice.  This is one I'll put in the "weeknight dinners" folder of my recipe box.

Made this exactly as written and it was a hit with my husband and stepdaughter.  I was sooooo tempted to replace the Miracle Whip with sour cream, as it just seems to make sense, BUT I wanted to try the recipe as written.  I'm glad I didn't alter the recipe because we all agreed the Miracle Whip definitely added something special to the flavor - a zippy tang that was unexpected!  I did serve with sour cream on the side so hubby could add some on top. Also, I love how easy this recipe is to make!

This was just ok.  I thought it was a little bit bland, needed more flavor.  I also didn't like the corn in it but I think that was because I used sweet white corn which was just the wrong flavor for this dish but that's all I had on hand.  I'm not sure I'll try this one again.

Awesome! I made it once with beef and again with chicken that I cooked and shredded... it was great both ways :-)

I also added a small onion and taco seasonings to both versions and to the chicken I also added some black beens... very yummy!

Thanks for the great idea

Good flavor & very easy. I used 15oz. ground beef, 1/2c. sour cream, 1T miracle whip, 15.5 oz. can of corn & mexican cheese. The rest of the recipe I followed like stated. next time try a small can of mexi-corn and some black beans. Also try taco flavored chips. I crunched the chips in my hand (not finely). Next time keep the chips crunched to a 1/2 dollar size. Black olives on top would be good too.

This is really good! It definitely needs to bake for longer than 20 minutes because it was still a little on the cold side when we ate it. But the taste was great! Not too spicy and my two year old loved it!

Make this on the regular! It's so good and easy to make, and my son loves it. I made it exactly as it is called for - minus the mayo (I hate mayo) but ranch dressing or sour cream work just fine in its place. Thank you for this recipe.

AMAZING recipe. I cook for 6 guys and they all loved it. Made a few changes however: took out the miracle whip and replaced with about 1/4 cup sour cream and added a layer of re-fried rice. Also, used taco seasoning in place of chili powder. Next time, I'm thinking of using doritos in place of corn chips. Definitely enjoyable for the entire family!

Tastes like nachos in a dish. Definately use sour cream instead of Mayo. Mayo just does not go with nachos.

Not the healthiest dinner, but it's an easy weeknight meal.  Followed recipe nearly exactly except used Mayo instead of salad dressing. I also did cover it while baking.  Pretty tastey! Served with black beans and green salad.

I made this and it was awesome!  I did tweek it a bit.  I added 2lbs of hamburger and a packet of taco seasoning and half of the mayo and about a cup of sour cream and a can of Bushes grilling beans the Black bean Fiesta.  It was very good it made a 9 x 13 pan and my husband took it to work for lunch!  Will make again.

We had friends over and served this.  They loved it...had seconds and thirds.  I double the recipe and swap on can of regular corn for one can of creamed corn. It really gives it a creamy sauce.

Only changed it slightly and I make it at least 3 times a month!  I use ground turkey and any mayo I have - Best Foods, Kraft or even sour cream if I have a little left in a container.  I don't like the chunks of tomatoes in salsa so I pureed it in a blender and have also used Mexican stewed tomatoes.  I have added a can of beans that I had in the pantry for a while and I use can or frozen corn depending on what I have the most of.  I have made this so many times that I don't use the recipe and "eyeball" all the ingredients but it always turns out delicious!  I work nights and will make it in the morning, cover with foil, and leave it in the fridge for the kids to bake off later.  Yummy!

This was pretty good, but felt a little rich to me. I think I will mix a little sour cream in with the mayo, so its not so rich. Also will probably put it into and 8x8 pan instead and layer more chips in, since not all of my mixture could fit into the 2 quart dish. Will make again, my hubby loved it!

I liked this recipe. It was easy and quick! The only thing I would change is the miracle whip makes it a little too sweet for my taste. I'm going to have to find a less sweet substitute.

Really good and easy to make. I made a few changes due to what I had available. I used frozen corn instead of canned corn. I added a can of black beans. I used some taco seasoning instead of chili powder and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese. I added some onion while browning the meat (Venison). My picky kids even like it! I will definitely make this again. It is easy to tweak a little to what you have on hand. 5-10 minutes of prep time and the oven does the rest.

Loved this!  Browed meat with onion and added taco seasoning packet as per other reviewers. Sour cream instead of salad dressing.  Loved the corn addition.  Will make again!

OMG!!!! This was so fantastic! I did not have Miracle Whip so I added 1/2  cup mayo &  1/4 cup sweet val. onion dressing instead. I also used Walmarts Black Bean & Corn Salsa instead of regualr salsa and Colby Jack chesse.  My teenaged sons have been begging me to make it again.

This is a yummy base for a dinner. I, too, cooked diced onion with the meat, added the 1/2 cup sour cream instead of Miracle Whip, and used a packet of taco seasoning. I strongly recommend topping this dish with tomato, avocado, additional sour cream, and hot sauce if so desired. The added vegetable garnishes really amped up the flavors and provided more health benefits. My picky husband loved the result.

Made this *almost* as written - just subsituted regular mayo for Miracle Whip as I don't care for it.  And unfortunately, I have to say that this reciped just isn't my cup of tea.  When it came out of the oven, it tasted distinctly too much like mayo, I didn't like it at all and I was afraid I'd have to throw it out.  

However, the leftovers the next day had a much better taste, but I still wouldn't make this again.  I'm surprised, because I like everything in it...but apparently just not together.  Oh well - that's why everyone has different tastes, I guess!

Fantastic! This was a quick and delicious meal. I used miracle whip, but just less than called for and it was just a slightly sweet taste that we loved. I used frozen corn as that is all i had and it was great. I paired this with cornmeal muffins. definitely will make again :)

I had problems with this one. Added onions with ground beef. Drained that and added the salsa, Miracle Whip/sour cream, corn, and spices and... it was downright soupy. I finally had to thicken the mixture with flour before layering it. Nobody else had this problem? Maybe the salsa was too watery. I'm gonna do this with taco seasoning next time -- the chili powder wasn't enough. Mixing chili powder with the cheese was good, though. My fella REALLY liked this.

Like others, for the creamy salad dressing  I used  light sour cream with a little light mayo.  The casserole held together pretty well.  My husband complained it was a little bland so I added cayanne pepper to 1/2 of it the second time I made it.  He was happy and the kids were happy with their less spicy side.

This was really, really good. Even my Dad who hates trying new things liked it.   Used 2 % milk mexican blend cheese and light sour cream instead of Miracle Whip.   I only hade 3/4 lb. of beef so I  added 1/2 can of black beans and used frozen corn ( cooked first) because I did not have canned.  Used taco seasoning mix instead of chili powder.  We put extra light sour cream on the finished dish with shredded lettuce on top.  The next day it was even better with Light Hidden Valley Ranch dressing on top!!  Thanks for the recipe Lunch lady.

omg!  Super easy and super delish!  I kept the recipe pretty much the same, used mayo and a bit of ranch dressing, used Fritos as suggested by another reviewer, and used (hot and spicy, by accident, but it was good) a package of taco seasoning.  I cooked mine for twice as long (40 minutes).  Garnished with shredded lettuce, freshly made pico de gallo, and a dollop each of guacamole and sour cream.  Made a pitcher of Margaritas and this was a fantastic meal!!  I would bring this to a pot luck any time and it would be DEVOURED!  Thanks for submitting!

DELISH!!!! I USED HALF MIRICLE WHIP HALF RANCH, ROTEL, PEPPER JACK AND CHEDDAR CHEESE, AND HINT OF JALAPANO CHIPS. I ADDED A LITTLE QUESO FROM A JAR TO THE MEAT MIXTURE. TURNED OUT GREAT. IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD WITH LETTUCE, TOMATOE AND SOUR CREAM ON TOP. MY FOUR YEAR OLD LOVED IT. GREAT IN A TORTILLA. WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN....SOON.

I hate to give a bad review but my family aren't real picky eaters and no one would eat this. Most of the time if something isn't great it is at least edible. All you can taste is chili powder and miracle whip. I thought the miracle whip sounded odd and you would think it would have called for sour cream instead but I just went with it.

This is great recipe minus the mayo and sub for sour cream.  I did not try it with the mayo, but it was a huge hit with my husband who is from San Antonio and loves good mexican food.  I also added refried beans to the mixture.  It was awesome will make again.

I used taco seasoning recipe mix from this website, and seasoned the beef with it.  I also used chedder cheese instead, and added black beans. I think it was great!!  Didn't do the sour cream like people suggested..kept it with the mayo, but used canola oil mayo. I was surprised about the taste together, really delicious. Corn was good too! Although I am into the tex mex stuff.

To all of you that changed this recipe you really missed out. The mayo was what made this dish. i did add olives but that didn't change the recipe. My children and husband loved it. I used plain tortilla chips and topped it with a little sour cream.

This casserole was delish!  I did serve it atop shredded lettuce, which basically made it a taco salad...  Thanks, Lunch Lady!

This is a favorite with my family.  I've also spread the beef mixture in a 9" X 9" pan, topped with cheese then baked it and served it with the chips on the side as a dip.  It was a hit!

I used Rotel instead of salsa, sour cream instead of mayo, and also added a can of black beans, and taco seasoning as well as chili powder....it was great!   The only thing I didn't like about it was the cheese on the chips......the top layer was rather chewy?  Think I will leave the top layer of chips off the next time and just put them all in the middle....good recipe tho, a keeper :)

This was such an easy meal to make. My picky teenagers loved it as well. It does say casserole so keep that in mind it isn't really nachos in the since but a yummy dinner dish. I also changed a few things from what was suggested below. My son is allergic to red meat so I changed to ground turkey, I used sour cream instead of mayo (he is allergic to eggs as well), I used 1 cup salsa vereses 1 & 1/2 cups, 2 tbs of taco seasoning from package verses chili powder, I added in 1 can of black beans as in additon to and whatever chips I had left I added to the top for the extra crunch. It is very easy to put together, place in the oven to bake and walk away until it is ready! VERY filling. Thank so VERY much for sharing. I have added to my box to keep on making.

Delicious...with a few changes. As others mentioned, I used sour cream instead of mayo. I cooked the meat w/onions and added my taco seasoning. I added chopped jalapenos (2 tbsp). I used Jack's Salsa, Mexican cheese and spicy nacho Doritos. The meal had tremendous flavor and was great as leftovers the next day. My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was, thanks Lunch*Lady!! Will definitely be making again, and again!

This is very good but I did change a few things.  I used ground turkey, rotel instead of salsa, sour cream instead of mayo and added black beans and onion to the meat mixture.  The biggest change was using a homemade taco seasoning mix to increase flavor (using a packet would be fine too).  Nice texture, quick & easy.  Makes a lot too.  A nice basic recipe to play around with and clean out your pantry.

This was good but I have had better by far. There just didn't seem to be much flavor to it at all and I even added about a cup of Jalapenos to the meat. Hubby says its not a keeper sorry!

A great classic to cook for the family. Easy to memorize, ingredients are always on hand, and everyone loves it! My only modifications were using 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and 2 T of mayo (instead of all mayo) and I also threw in a can of black beans. This is really good comfort food and the kids say they like it even better than tacos!

We loved this.  The only change I made was I used salt and pepper instead of chili powder, and we topped it with a bunch of fresh ingredients (tomato, avocado, cilantro and lime juice)  It was really easy to make.

Made a few additions based on reviews.  I also substituted corn tortillas for the chips. Pretty good.  I'll try the chips next time.

Really good - I did take some of the other reviewer's suggestions like subbing sour cream for miracle whip and using taco seasoning in place of chili pepper.  My DH liked it and he is tough to please.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious - reminds me of a taco salad without lettuce.  I too used taco seasoning and sour cream.  I did keep the corn and added a can of kidney beans.  The chips we used were the doritos spicy nacho.  It was so good, moist, very flavorful and easy.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for the idea!

I loved this! I added refried beans to the bottom of the casserole, and topped it with some sliced black olives...kind of turned into a crunchy enchilada bake but without the sauce! Also substituted sour cream for the Miracle Whip, as others suggested.  I really really liked this dish but I don't think my boyfriend did so much because he's not really into casseroles...but in any case, I really liked it but I will have to wait a long time before I can make it again :( Can't wait for leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

Really, really good! I used frozen corn (not a can) and a taco mix packet (not chili powder). I added lots of garlic and one cup black beans.  I will use more cheese on top next time.  This was a huge hit with everyone and we ate it for lunch the next day.

This was good. I added homemade salsa, a can of black beans, and sour cream instead of mayo. I also added half a taco packet to the ground beef. I did not have many tortilla chips, but I think more would add a nice crunchy taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! I did modify as previous reviewers suggested using taco seasoning and sour cream. I also used Southwest Corn sold under the Kener label because it has red peppers and diced green chiles in it.  The "topitos" or tortilla chips I used were lemon flavored (that's what was in the pantry) and I found the additional flavor to be compatible with the dish.

Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Good Stuff.  My family was trying to cut back on meat, so I used TVP instead of ground beef and it was fabulous.  Good, Easy weeknight dinner.

Just getting in from soccer and having to rush off to an award ceramony at school I had only minutes to throw it together. I was running back and forth from the computer to the kitchen and on the phone (don't know why I didn't just print the recipe) I didn't have salad dressing but did have sour cream, totally forgot the corn and salsa...oops! I added beans and it still turned out great. Everyone liked it. But next time I will take the time to make it as the recipe states, but I will still add beans...love em. I will also be better prepared on a busy day!

Very simple to make and tasted good.  I followed some other recommendations and used half cup sour cream and half cup mayo, sauteed onion and garlic and added to beef with some black pepper, and added in a can of black beans.

This casserole recipe is GREAT and easy.  As others did, I made some alterations (added onions when browning beef, added black beans and cut back a little on the corn, supplemented chili powder with a little over a tablespoon of packaged Taco Seasoning mix, changed Miracle Whip to Mayo/Sour Cream mixture, used a Mexican combo style shredded cheese along w/ some shredded cheddar).  YUMMO!  I will definitely make this again.  THANK YOU!

This was a great recipe.  I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and sour cream instead of Miracle Whip, and cheddar instead of colby.  Even my dad who isn't a huge fan of mexican food had two helpings.  Perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

UPDATE:  I made this a second time and added chopped onions while browning the beef, used a package of taco seasoning per pound of beef, and used a mexican blend of cheeses.  These changes gave it much more flavor.

This casserole was easy, but no one in my family liked it. The Miracle Whip made it too sweet. I won't make it again.

This was a HUGE hit with my five picky eaters, so it gets five stars.  I used ground turkey to lower the fat a little, and light mayo.  Next time I will try using taco seasoning, but I didn't have any.  I added cumin, garlic, and pepper in addition to the chili powder.  Very good and a breeze to prepare!

I made this last night for my 12 year old and we both loved it.  I think I added a little extra salsa by accident and used the sour cream as recommended by others.  This will be added to our menu rotation for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good but did make changes as some suggested...taco seasoning and sour cream.  It also needed a little more liquid, we added more salsa and some lettuce and sour cream on top. It's good because you can make it at the last minute because we all have these things on hand.  Will make again...

Easy, easy, yummy, yummy! Added a can of pinto beans for a little more heft and used a combo of sour cream and ranch instead of Miracle Whip and taco seasoning instead of chili powder (per other reviews). I didn't think it was bland - the salsa gave it a nice mild flavor. I can see using some more heat but then my kids wouldn't eat it so this was just fine for us! Great recipe.

I thought this was really good. The family thought it was just ok. I thought it could've used a little more "something". I did add a teaspoon of cumin to help give more flavor. Next time maybe I'll add some noodles.

This recipe is amazing (although I did substitute taco seasoning and sour cream for the spices and mayo as others)  My family can't get enough of it.  I brought it to a house warming party and when I left I had given out the recipe at least 4 times.  There were polite arguements over who would get the leftovers.
Will make over and over

Great recipe, very easy and tastes good.  Not a fancy dish, but good for a busy weeknight.  I add a can of refried beans to the meat mixture and like it a little better that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS! I also substituted 3/4c. of sour cream instead of the Miracle Whip. I used a mexican style shredded cheese blend instead of plain colby. Pace Chunky Medium Salsa gave it just a small kick. Very good!

This was a real winner! I used 3/4 cup of sour cream instead of teh mayo and used a blend of colby and monterey jack cheese. Other than that, I stuck with the original recipe and it came out great! Thanks for the quick, easy, delicious meal idea!

My family loved this dish. There wasnt any leftovers. I made a few changes, instead of using chile powder, I used a pkg. of taco seasoning. I used cheddar cheese instead of colby. And on the top of the cheese, I put diced tomato, green onion, and hot pepper.

Everyone liked this.  I used sourcream instead of the miracle whip.  I also served it on the side instead of mixing it in because my daughter doesn't like sourcream.  I will def. make this again.

My picky husband and kids enjoyed this. However, next time I plan on replacing the corn with refried beans. I did as another person recommended and replaced mayo with sour cream. Very good recipe that isn't too time consuming! Thanks!

I love this recipe. Easy to make. Would be delicious with some slices of avocado and maybe a dollop of fresh salsa.

This is a great recipe my husband loves it. But one thing that wasn't good was miracle whip. So instead I just used regular mayo. Next time I'm going to try sour cream. I would have used it last time but needed it for diffrent recipe.

I really like this recipe except for the zing from the miricale whip. I took other advice and use taco seasoning and instead of using 3/4 cup of Miracle whip, I used 1/2 cup miricale whip and 1/4 cup of sour cream. I think next time I make this I will use 1/4 cup Miracle Whip and 1/2 cup sour cream. Other than that it was great. My two boys(3&4) enjoyed crushing the chips and helping me layer. Thank so much.

I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 Miracle Whip. I may try adding some black beans to it next time. I thought it was very good, but just lacked something.

Really good & easy. My only change to the recipe was to use 1 packet of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and I added some garlic. Served with Sour cream and refried beans. Super!

This was an okay recipe.  I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any zing but maybe that was because I took some other people's suggestions and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  Also when serving, it falls apart.  I used half the amount of salad dressing that the recipe called for and it still came out fine so that's an easy way to cut down on calories and spare your arteries.

One of my picky kids liked it, the other didn't.  Personally, I thought the mayo overpowered the other ingredients.  Made it edible by piling on more salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Won't make it again, mexican and mayo DO NOT mix!

This was so filling and delicious! I added cooked rice-a-roni spanish rice and fritos corn chips instead of tortilla chips. I also added sour cream instead of miracle whip. And I cooked the ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning. This would be a perfect pot luck dish!

This is a good basic casserole the whole family loved.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  After browning the beef I added a packet of taco seasoning.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans and 1 1/2 cups minute brown rice, 1 c. frozen corn and 1 c. salsa. After spooning the serving on a plate we put shredded lettuce, tomato and sour cream on top.  Really good

Was pretty good and really fast! Used sour cream instead of mayo, added taco seasoning and used fritos. It tasted like a big frito chili pie with a little spicier meat. Will make again when in a pinch. Speed turned this from four to five stars.

This is definitely a "keeper" if what my husband and stepkids say is true. I stayed with the basic recipe, but tailored it to our likes.  I used diced tomatoes w/green chiles (instead of salsa), and mexi-corn, as well as using sour cream with a whole packet of taco seasoning.  I also used corn chips because that's what I had on hand.  I also "eye-balled" everything when mixing it up....I just looked for the right consistency when mixing in the sour cream, etc.  It turned out quite well and we all enjoyed it.

AWSOME!  I made double the recipe..hoping for leftovers...its all gone.  I used Taco Bells Thick and Chunky Salsa and it wasnt runny, so the chips were not soggy.  I did use sour cream, shredded Taco Cheese, and Doritos Taco flavored chips.  I will definitely make this again!!

I love Miracle Whip, especially on my sandwiches, but with this recipe that's all I could taste, that and tortilla chips. Not a recipe I would try again, but then again everyone has different tastes, other ratings were very high......

This was really good. I followed the reviewers suggestions and made some changes. After cooking the hamburger I added taco seasoning and omitted the chili powder, used 3/4 cup of sour cream instead of mayo, and used sharp cheddar cheese because that was all I had. I also used 2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies instead of salsa. This is a great casserole. I didn't even use a fork. Just used tortilla chips to scoop it up and eat. The only complaint I had was that my middle layer of chips got soggy. But I will definitely make this again.

Loved it! Kids loved it. I took advise from earlier reviewers and altered a few things. Ranch dressing instead of Miracle Whip. Packet of taco seasoning in the beef. Also, I didn't read the directions properly and combined chips with meat and it was fine. Thanks so much.

2 tbsp. of taco seasoning. I also reduced the salsa to 1 cup & added 1 can of black beans in with the corn. Instead of 3/4 mayo I used 1/2 cup of sour cream & 1 heaping tbsp. of mayo

I did make significant changes to this recipe, but the beauty of it is, it lends itself well to customization. I basically followed the tips @allysonhester outlined in her comment, lol. I sautéed some onion for the ground beef, added frozen diced green peppers to beef also, I used 1/2 c. sour cream instead of Miracle Whip, Taco Bell original seasoning packet (whole packet) instead of chili powder, chili cheese Fritos instead of corn chips, and Mexican cheese (shredded) instead of Colby. It turned out fantastic. I will use more sour cream next time, like 3/4 c. but it doesn't need it.

Pretty good and easy to make. I used sour cream instead of Miracle Whip because I can’t stand it. Also added a small can of sliced olives to the mix. I would suggest using a 3 quart casserole dish, instead of the 2 quarts it says. Filled the 2 quart with just one layer each of the beef mix, chips and cheese and had to get out a second dish 8x8 to use the rest of the ingredients.

Would definitely make it again, but would add things to it. It is basically nachos, which I love so that worked. But could easily have added some refried beans, green onion and other toppings. We added salsa on top as well because it needed a little extra.

We thought it was good but not great. I would make it again but it’s not something I would crave. But our little 4 year old ate 2 small servings which is unusual so that’s a testament. I liked the suggestion to lesson the miracle whip and add sour cream because after I added the miracle whip and tasted I thought Oh No! But after cooking it was fine. I did add some things like a can of pinto beans and onion and green chili’s but everyone thought those were good additions.

My family of 6 loves this recipe!  My oldest son even asked for it for his birthday.  I made it the way the recipe said the first time.  The family said it was a bit too tangy, so I substituted sour cream for half of the Miracle Whip and it was perfect.  I have doubled the recipe and just cooked it a little longer and it came out great.  When I developed a sensitivity to corn I substituted black beans for the corn and cut up flour tortillas for the chips that go inside the casserole and my family said they liked it even better that way.  You just can't go wrong with this casserole!

Great! Replaced the miracle whip with ranch sour cream.  Miracle whip with rest of the ingredients just didn't sit well with me.  Omitted chili powder.  Excellent recipe!

I love this stuff! I usually make it with spicy nacho Doritos. Sometimes with a different salsa. Otherwise it can be a little bland.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good, but a little sweet.  This time I didn't have tortilla chips so I substituted Doritos.  Then, I found my mayo was gone so I used sour cream.  I also used Monterey Jack cheese.  No more sweet taste with these substitutions.  Mmm good!

Super easy and tasty. Of course I made a few modifications for family's taste and pantry's contents. Made with "Southwestern corn and peppers," Doritos, and taco seasoning. Also added onion to ground beef. Was tasty and warming. Would definitely make again, but would bump up the spices a bit. Didn't love the corn's texture, might have been the brand. Kids and hubby liked it.

Loved this but I did make several changes.  I included half a minced onion and cooked it with the meat.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I substituted an equal amount of low-fat sour cream for the Miracle Whip, and I used a package of low-sodium taco seasoning on the meat once it was cooked, as well as the chili powder.  I also used 2% cheese and along with a can of corn I included a can of black beans.  It tasted DELICIOUS and even my super picky 8 year old loved it, we will definitely be making it again.

We loved this recipe, although we tweaked it.  I used ground turkey, subbed the mayo for sour cream, and used monterey jack cheese.  For the salsa, I used the fresh kind you find in the produce section at the grocery store.  It didn't make as much as I would have thought, so I may double it the next time.  Easy and yummy recipe!

Made recipe as is and the family loved it.  I was asked to put it into the normal dinner rotation.  

I also made it "my way" and the family loved the changes.  I added yellow onion to the ground beef, 1 can black bean, 1 - 5oz can of black olives, 1/2 cup sour cream + 1 heaping Tbsp of mayo and taco seasoning in place of chili seasoning.  

After making it a couple of times, would recommend thinner tortilla chips rather than thicker chips.

Family approved as is, and easy to make. Next time I might add sliced black olives and green onions before baking, and maybe some chopped tomatoes  to the top before serving. Can think of many ways to add to it, but great the way it is too.

My family did not love this, it was just ok.   I did make a couple of changes but don't think it made much difference . . . subbed the mayo for sour cream and used cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I think this could be good but next time I would leave out the sour cream/mayo all together, add more spices, more veggies, possibly use corn chips instead of tortilla chips, and maybe add more cheese.  It definitely was kinda bland, so needs more spices.

The only thing I did was add onion and did 1/3 mayo with 2/3 sour cream. It tasted weird with the corn. I wouldn't put corn in again. Plus the cheese melted hard so I think 20 min. is too long. It was okay but I'm pretty sure this is how you get the runs.

My kids said this was the best supper ever! Very easy to make. I would add a little more dressing and salsa to make it a little saucier, but it was still amazing.

This has now become my all time favorite!  It is very rare to find something that ALL of my family memebers LOVE!!
I recommend the following changes:
Use 1 1/2 pounds of beef, and season beef as it cooks with pepper and La Victoria Green Salsa. I also used a whole container of Rojos restaurant style salsa (not jarred, very fresh!).

this was a much easier way to do taco night with little kids!  we usually are making soft and hard shell tacos as fast as the kids are eating them and then my husband and I end up eating after the kids have already eaten 2 or 3 tacos (that can have its own benefits though!).  With this casserole we get to eat all together as a family.  I also used sour cream instead of mayo/salad dressing.  I used ground turkey to make it healthier and we put chopped tomatoes and lettuce on each serving for freshness.

I made the original recipe and some of my family loved it but others did not. (half don't eat mayo.) So I revised it a bit, instead I used sour cream in place of mayo and fiesta corn in place of normal corn and it was a hit!!! Everyone loved it an scarfed it down! It was great! Love this recipe, I will be making it again.

I used sour cream, but my mom used the mayo option. We think they taste the same no matter which option :) everything else we left the same.  Even my 2 year old loved it!!! :) flavors are great, and the chips added a nice crunch!

Like other reviewers, I added black beans and substituted sour cream for the miracle whip and taco mix for the chili powder. I brought this to a pot lot for quilters--all good cooks, and they loved it!

This recipe is good as a base but it needs help. Mayo, REALLY??? So, instead of the mayo, I used Lite Sour Cream adding an extra 1/4 cup to the mix. Used Mexicorn, too.  I opted for a Mexican Mixed type of shredded Cheese.  Added a rinsed can of  Black Beans, a small can of undrained Chopped Green Chiles, & Cilantro to the Sour Cream mix. Added onions with some minced Garlic to the meat while cooking. Used a little EVOO to fry it all up. Also used some Cilantro for garnish. Taco Seasoning worked out better I think than the plain old Chili powder, to which I added a touch of  ground Cumin. When out of the oven, I sprinkled some sliced  Black Olives over the bubbling cheese. I can't imagine how plain it would be without these extra ingredients and steps. It did turn out good but would be dry without the extra SC.

I save 5 stars for the best recipes and this is one of the best! I used 1/4 light mayo and the other half cup I used plain greek yogurt. Superb! I ran out of tortilla chips so I had to use Cool Ranch Doritos and Cheetos. Desperate times but it tasted great.  I might do regular Doritos next time, actually. I added green peppers and black beans to make it a little healthier.

I agree with many others that you should try it once as written and the next time make your changes.  With that said, and my changes, it was a keeper.  The basic flavor and ingredients were good, but dull.  The second time around I added chopped onion and garlic to the meat during the browning phase, and taco seasoning in place of the chili powder.  As I don't keep Miracle Whip in the house, I used a 1/4 cup of yogurt, and added can of black beans.  I layered it in a casserole dish, and used grated Mexican cheese.   Adding hot sauce or peppers to your own heat tolerance is always acceptable.  It makes great burritos and/or taco salad.  It was also easy to prep and only one fry pan to clean.

I added corn, jalapenos, black beans, taco seasoning, changed up the miracle whip and did sour cream and a smidgen of mayo, and added a whole jar of black bean and corn salsa. Because of previous suggestions ans it was still MEH! Next time, because my husband wants me to make it again but bump up everything to my seasoning level. When I do I will update.

I wished I had made my own alterations but I was just lazy that day.

It was really good; however we felt it had way too many chips!  If I make it again I may use about half the amount!  Also, I used ground turkey.

Yummy!  
Used a foil 9" X 13" pan, so nothing to scrub except utensils and the non-stick frying pan.
Followed exactly.  Not a word from the DH except for a few moans of pleasure.
I packed him a nice lunch for today, but when I went into the fridge this morning,his lunch bag was still there - and the leftover casserole was gone.  
Next time, I think I'll add onions and use Fritos, and maybe add sliced black olives.
I have to admit I used a little extra cheese on top, but that was only to empty the bag.
The best part was that I had everything I needed already at home.

I'm happy to say my family loved this dish. I added son chopped green onions between the beef and crushed chips and under top layer of cheese though. The one thing I might change for next time would be to use picante sauce the make it a little more moist.

Made this for Cinco Daimyo and I put half a package of taco seasoning instead of chili powder and replaced with a name brand taco sauce in place of the salsa and sprinkled chopped olives after baking,and served with sliced avocado,and fat free sour cream. Olay!!

It was DELICIOUS! I only had 1 cup of nachos, but several soft tortillas. I layered the soft tortillas in place of nachos, and then sprinkled 1/2 cup on top of tortilla and continued layering. I also used frozen corn because I didn't have canned corn. And it turned out AMAZING! My family loved it!

I will make again! Wow! I had corn on cob, so used fresh corn, also put in fresh cilantro, garlic, and used ancho chili powder and cayenne, two cups of Gouda.  Didn't have tortilla chips, so crisped up hard taco shells and used them instead.  Fantastic!

I saw this recipe yesterday & just happened to have all of the ingredients on hand so I made it last night.  Glad I did, my husband loved it (said it over and over lol ) We love anything  Mexican & this was delicious!  I did sub sour cream for the miracle whip, mainly because  I love sour cream on my tacos or nachos. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making again!

I thought it was okay. My husband liked it. My daughter said if she had to eat more than was served to her she'd throw up. I made it as is. Hubby will get it in his lunch bowls.

It's great that so many people looked at the recipe and decided to change it.  If you see a recipe that you know your family won't like...why make it.  I applaud these cooks who used the basic idea of the recipe and added other ingred.    Looking at all these comments it seems we have a lot of new things to try...if they suit our taste. Thanks to all of you for the ideas.

Confession, I didn't make it but have been looking for casserole dishes that use tortilla chips.  I go to the review page to see what changes others have done and how they turned out. So, I LIKE FOLKS TO REVIEW THEIR CHANGE RECIPES!

So I wonder why ally99 bothered to review the recipe at all, after preparing an entirely different dish? I can't understand the premise. Make your own dish and leave the reviewing to those that tried the recipe. 
I tried it and loved the idea but found it a little more bland for my spice loving pallet. Everyone else asked me to add it to the rotation. Very quick, very easy, and very tasty.

I honestly think that this is one of the BEST recipes I ever made.  I ran out of tortilla chips, so I substituted Fritos and sweet potato chips.  Yum Yum Yum.

This one is a keeper!  I used sour cream and added a tablespoon or two of ranch dressing.  I also used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and I used black beans instead of corn.  Lastly, I had some left over rice, so I threw what I had in too.  I would recommend to cover while baking, so the cheese doesn't get hard and maybe 5 minutes before you take it out I would in cover it.  Definitely will make this again!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe! We scooped it up with some Tostitos Scoops. We added a little sour cream on top when serving it. We will definitely add this to our list of dinners to make again! Next time, I will try to adjust the recipe to add a little more spice to the meat.

Iinstead of mixing most ingredients into pan used to brown meat I just  put everything in pan and mixed everything together, then added nacho crush in one layer topped with  cheese. I used a grated Mexican cheese mixture (Centrella) and sprinkled it all over top.  It needed a little more time to bake, 5-7.  Looks great.

This was an incredibly simple recipe that won raves from my family.  It took me about 5 minutes to assemble and 20 minutes to cook- you can't beat that for a great dinner on a work-night!  Best of all, it works beautifully with meat-substitute crumbles, for those who have tried to make their diet more plant-based and less caloric; you would never know you weren't eating ground beef.  I suggest you put very thin layers of the crushed tortilla chips on because they tend to harden during cooking and it can make the chips taste stale.  Thanks for such a great and simple recipe!

We enjoyed it a lot!  I did a few things differently: sautéed an onion with my hamburger, added a can of mexican corn and black beans, used sour cream instead of salad dressing.  Used regular tortilla chips  and served with extra chips on the side.  Makes a great dip for nachos!

Definitely use sour cream instead of mayo or miracle whip. It gives the dish a great flavor. This is a dish you can make many ways but I like this one.

Added cilantro, chopped green chilies & avocado which turned out fabulous. Increased to 1 1/2 of hamburger, but it could have used more chili powder or some hot sauce, but it still disappeared quickly.

No changes but I would make it again and add something to make it taste less bland.

I made this recipe as written and it was just ok. So the second and third time I made more adjustments and now it’s a family favorite!  I use 2 lbs of ground beef and brown with taco seasoning packets. I use mexicorn instead of regular corn and use taco sauce instead of salsa. For the tortilla chips I use taco flavored Doritos and finally I add a can of black beans. We like it with miracle whip but use a little less than the recipe calls for. Fantastic!

My family loved this. I didn't have sour cream so I used one can of cream of chicken soup.  I also used a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I did not use miracle whip at all.  I will make this again!

This is a fab recipe. Have done it three times this month and sons have made it for their families too - they loved it too. 
- Used Hellmann Lighter than Light mayo instead of whip. 
-fried an onion with beef
733 cals ( I am a calorie counter ) with 30gms cheese. 
Really, really worth a go. Thanks Allrecipes. Have used so many of your recipes recently and saves me time from looking for ideas in books and internet.

I made this once according to directions, it was good but it needed to be kicked up a notch. The second time I made it I switched to using a package of taco seasonings, sour cream instead of Miracle Whip, Mexican 4 cheese blend, Fritos, & canned fat free black refried beans that I microwaved to somewhat loosen it up, & jarred chunky salsa (Pace). It was really good. Family loved it. Now THIS time, I had a frozen Paleo chili from Walmart that I forgot about so I nuked it & added to the ground beef onion mixture. I added Mexicorn & a small can of green chilis. I also added a small can of sliced black olives as well. I know this is not the original recipe but I did make it accordingly to the original. I kept the Fritos which I think works best for crunch. My family voted & gave it 15 stars, lol. I to,d them only 10 at most but they voted against my suggestion. We are looking forward to burritos in the coming days.... if it lasts that long, lol

I made this recipe as written and it was delicious.  I then used mexicorn, swapped out the miracle whip with sour cream and instead of salsa used a can on Rotel.   Both ways were just as delicious!  Thanks for sharing

Great recipe! Honestly it's  straight forward, pretty much a taco salad, so nothing too special. Some adjustments, I used sour cream instead of mayo and added some black beans for more "meat" to it. 

After all said and done though, this works better as just a dip. Save the tortilla chips and use them as dipping chips. I like the concept of the recipe, but the "casserole" ends up just being a taco dip

Used half miracle whip and half ranch dressing. Added extra for creamy touch. The salsa made it a little too spicy so adjust with the chili powder.  Easy and the family loved it!

Delicious!  I added some chopped raw onions and hope to use a little bit of some spicy seasoning.  My husband liked it, where he usually doesn't like new things that I make.

We loved this! The only changes we made was to use low fat sour cream instead of Miracle Whip as we don't use that and onion instead of corn. The rest was exactly as written. Husband gobbled it up and pronounced it a keeper!

I took this and made a few changes:
3/4 C sour cream instead of miracle whip
1 Can corn
1 Can black beans
1 C Lightly crushed Fritos 
1 C /lightly crushed tortilla chips
1 Taco season mix 
Then I accidentally set the temp to 375, but it worked out well and the cheese was lightly brown.

Terrific recipe! I used sour cream instead of miracle whip and did not add the corn but only because my husband doesn't like corn. I also used crushed Doritos instead of regular tortilla chips. My husband even requested that I make it part of our weekly menu.

Made this just as the recipe called for; however, the Miracle Whip was way overpowering.  I would definitely cut down the portion of it or leave it out altogether next time.  I would also add beans instead of corn.  The consistency of this dish was definitely not like that of Nachos.  A little disappointing.

Yummy. I wasn't sure about the miracle whip and it was a bit strong the first night. But by leftovers the next day, the miracle whip taste wasn't as tangy and the taco chips were softer. I will be making this one again.

Delicious and easy recipe to prepare for family and guests.  We made a couple substitutions. First, we had extra sour cream so we combined it with the cooked ground beef instead of Miracle Whip.  We decided to leave out the corn.  We added 2 garlic cloves (minched), one forth an onion (diced), and a half cup of diced bell pepper.  The garlic, onions and bell pepper combination added flavor plus  an extra pop of color.  We also swapped  shredded Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese for Colby cheese.  We included  1/4 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon old bay spice in place of chili powder.  Definitely making this wonderful casserole again!

I used left over taco meat and still added the chili powder. It was very tasty! Next time I will add more chips because it added a great crunchy texture to this recipe. Will definitely make again!

This was fast and easy to pull together using ingredients that I had on hand! I added onion, and a chipotle flavored chili powder. I served it with a plain yogurt topping.

Love the recipe! Made some changes, black beans a must!! Used taco seasoning instead of chilli powder. Tonight im using chorizo from the deli store instead of ground beef. This is definitely a recipe we like the way it is and a recipe we like to play around with!!

As written, this is a good, easy, and tasty casserole. I now make it with the following changes: add a small chopped onion to the ground beef as it browns, add about a 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes to beef mixture, add some chopped, jalapeño and no miracle whip!  I have also made this without the corn if I don't have any. I always add black beans, and sometimes a layer of refried beans. Layer the refried beans, then the beef mixture. Sprinkle with some of the cheese, then I bake for about 15 minutes, then add the tortilla chips and more cheese, and bake for an additional 5-6 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Also, because there are only two of us, and this makes a ton, I very  successfully divide this into two small casseroles and freeze one. I do not add the cheese or chips to the frozen casserole until I am ready to put it into the oven.

This recipe when you read it doesnt seem like its that much, but there is something about the combination of flavors that makes this casserole so very good. This one is the reason my daughters like to try new casserole recipes.

LOVED this recipe!  I did make a couple of changes, I really like this recipe because it's so versatile you can make it how you like and with whatever is hanging around the pantry. I used Dorritos because that's what I had on hand, I added black beans because we had some I wanted to use and I think I added more salsa since I like that tomato-y taste. Definitely one of my husbands favorite dishes now so will probably be making again soon!

This recipe was fantastic! It was so simple to make. My husband absolutely loved it. I did make a few adjustments I added fresh cilantro and green onions to it. I was skeptical about the miracle whip, surprisingly enough it was very tasty and gave it a twang. I served it with sour cream and siracha.

I love it and I'm not even a fan of this kind of food! I seasoned the beef with Taco Seasoning during browning, used sour cream and a combination of Taco Blend and Pepper Jack cheeses.

Very Yummy! A nice switch from regular tacos and really easy to make. I used sour cream instead of Miracle Whip and added onions and taco spice. This recipe is a keeper!

I used sour cream with a couple tablespoons of ranch dressing instead of Miracle Whip and colby-jack combination instead of just colby cheese. My husband and I enjoyed it and yes, I would make it again.

This  was pretty good!  I used blue tortilla chips to liven up the presentation and they were yummy too.  This would work as a hearty dip, too.  I also layered a can of retried beans in with it and that was really good; the tastes all blended well together.

A couple reasons why I didn't rate this a 5 stars. It needs more depth of flavor. Maybe the taco seasoning is the way to go. The second reason was, while reading the reviews, being chastised by several people for not making it exactly like the author did, is in my opinion, immature.  It makes me want to move on to another recipe or even another website. So why don't these people pull on their big people pants and deal with it.

I LOVE this! A couple of modifiers...used Ranch dressing instead of mayo (as much to taste), didn't bother crumbling the chips and layered them. That gave the dish a chewy/ slightly crunchy layer. I make this till my husband gets tired of it. I still can't get enough.

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I also used Mexican corn and lots of extra cheese. It was something different and I will make it again and try changing up the ingredients a little differently next time.

Really good and easy to make. Only gave it 4 with the original recipe, but with the changes I made it was a 5 star. Sub: sour cream with mayo, and taco seasoning with chili powder. very good and will be making it again!

I added 1 chopped onion to the hamburger, 1 chopped jalapeno, 1 can of mashed black beans, used frozen corn instead of canned, subbed sour cream for the miracle whip, added chopped black olives to the top before baking and had chopped lettuce, tomatoes and sweet peppers and sour cream to add to the top after baking. I covered it with foil for the first 20 minutes, took off the last 10 minutes. My husband liked it better than I did- I just prefer taco salad. I would make this again probably though for the ease of this dish.

This caught my eye  because I had some miracle whip that I wanted to use up. I wasn't sure about the recipe when I was reading it, but this turned out really good. This is a eassssy one skillet meal. I did follow the recipe,the only change I made was I had a 1/4 to 1/2 of a onion, I wanted to get rid of it so I chopped it up and cooked it with the hamburger. I used medium chunky salsa also. I do agree with other viewers that black beans would be good in this dish. I will try that next time.My son put this in a tortilla wrap he said it was gooood. I know I will be making this again.

I have made this casserole twice now,it's that delicious.  Like other readers I subed sour cream for the mayo. I also added black black olives and jalepeno chilis for an extra kick.  I am so confident about this recipe that I serve it to guests on a weekend night at home.  A good addition is to serve homemade refried beans as a side dish.  I know you will enjoy this.

Just tried this, it was great!  I did use frozen white corn and added olives to the top.  I think a poster made a comment about the cheese on top being quite crusty and recommended covering it while is bakes.  I will do that next time.

I found it to be quite dry and there were too many chips. The chips also ended up very chewy. It just wasn't a texture I liked. I won't be keeping this one in my recipe box.

If you could see all of my reviews you would see that I rarely, if ever, give a one star.  But I made this recipe as written and it was the most boring, bland casserole I have ever made.  Thank goodness I made cheese dip and guacamole to go along with it.

Such a great recipe as is, yet it can easily be changed up! I needed to use up some kale so I chopped that in with the corn and tomatoes (about 1.5 cups fresh chopped, didn't have salsa on hand ) it turned out good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was yummy!! I made a few changes as another poster did by using sour cream instead of salad dressing, added some refried beans and some mild cheddar cheese instead of colby jack. Husband loved it. Next time I think I'll put the servings on a bed of shredded lettuce and some black olives on top.

My family loved this recipe!!! I don't like corn in casseroles, so omitted that. I uses mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip. I used Italian blend shredded cheese and muenster. I didn't have a lot of tortilla chips so I also used French fried onions in the mix with the tortilla chips.

Very good- use sour cream in place of mayo and taco seasoning in place of chili powder.  Cooked 30 min. covered and then add cheese cook for 10 more minutes.

I made this exactly as written. It was very good but it definitely has that tangy miracle whip taste. Curious about the sour cream. Next time I won't add the tortillas for baking, I'll add them on the side because I think they do get soggy.

This is very good but I did not care for the Colby cheese on it.  I changed to cheddar the next time I made it and that was better.  I also changed the chips the next time & used Doritos Nacho cheese chips.

Really good. I did use sour cream for the mayo, add more taco spices and black beans, and had rotel in my cupboard rather than salsa, but still good. Might try to make it gooier next time, more sour cream, velveeta cheese, something..

Great recipe! I am a single guy and this is an easy recipe to make. I did make a few modifications. I added a packet of McCormick HOT taco seasoning and   several dashed of Franks red hot. I know this is crazy but as i am a single guy this recipe lasts for a few days. I ran onto the problem of the chips turning stale and mushy after the first day, so i used corn tortillas instead.  turned out grate. Yhea i miss the crunch but still over not bad at all..

All 4 of my kids loved this, and the grown ups too.  I added taco seasoning, onion and garlic.  Mixed in some sour cream with mayo.  I also used the Mexican tostadas and crumbled them up because they're super cheap.  Will definitely keep this in rotation

I followed the recipe exactly. It was good however it seemed the Miracle whip and salsa overpowered the recipe.  I didn't taste any chili powder. I put a lot of chips in but, I'm not sure what happened to them.  I tried the first serving and then had the kids crush up a few more chips and served theirs on top of the chips. Kids liked it. I will make again however next time I will only use 1/2 cup Miracle Whip, I'll use taco seasoning instead of chili power, I'll add beans and I'll serve with some black olives.

I took some of the suggestions of other reviews.  I substituted sour cream for the Miracle Whip.  I used a taco seasoning packet in place of the chili powder, and lastly, I added a can of black beans.  This was quite yummy.  Easy mexican meal with no fuss.

My family liked this but one thought it was a little too spicy. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't like Miracle Whip but the family does and I wasn't going to be eating it anyway (vegetarian) so it worked. It was easy to prepare and served 6 teens/adults with a little left over.

I have to double everything because my family inhales this.  A 9x13 pan, five people (3 are girls), and we have just a couple "pieces" left when we're done.  I make mine more like a lasagna consistency so it isn't "slop".  One of our favorites. Keep the chips on the larger side as one reviewer suggested, for some reason it just comes out better that way.

This is really good. Definitely liked the corn in it. I think I would like a half pound more meat and a can of chopped green chilis. I did use taco seasoning and sour cream.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! Easily one of my top 10 favorites of all time!  Trust me on this and take my advice! Do not change anything with this recipe!  I noticed most substituted the miracle whip with sour cream.  DON'T DO THIS!  I admit the miracle whip might sound strange to put in a taco recipe.  But it works beautifully with this recipe! I guarantee you will love it as the recipe was created! I have made this multiple times and will continue to make it on a regular basis! Trust me! You are going to love this one!

Made this for the first time tonight! So glad I did. I did sub cream cheese for most of the mayo and added a small amount of mayo to it. I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and added minced garlic and onion to the meat mixture. I also subbed kidney beans for corn because I prefer the protein. This is going in my recipe bank!

This was very delicious! I recommend using mayonnaise instead of miracle whip if you want less of a dressing flavor to it.

I should start off by saying that I typically don't take the time to review recipes, but this one deserves a review. After reading many of the other user-reviews, I also made some changes to the base recipe and it was fantastic.  Here are the changes I made: 

1.) I browned my meat with chopped onion and minced garlic; 
2.) After browning the meat, I added a packet of Mrs. Dash taco seasoning (followed directions on packet); 
3.) I added a 15 oz. can of reduced-sodium black beans; 
4.) In place of the Miracle Whip, I combined 1/2 c. fat-free sour cream and a large spoonful of reduced-fat mayo; and
5.) I used Mexican cheese instead of Colby.

Lastly, I sliced up an avocado and served it with the casserole. I don't exactly love cooking (I'm trying to get myself to love it), but this is an easy dish that I will definitely be making again.  I highly recommend it!

My mother-in-law makes this and they call it Nacho Slop. Disgusting name, amazing flavor! She'd bring it to us in college and we'd eat it right out of the container on the first night. But, if there's any leftover, it's delicious cold the next day. One of my family's all-time favorites!!

I made this instead of the usual boring burritos - and my family loved it!!! I also changed things around, diced tomatoes for salsa, sour cream for dressing, taco seasoning for chili powder. Added a little shredded cheddar & mozzarella on top & Colby cheese in the layering. And, I  added a cup of chopped spinach & 1/2 onion chopped, then, as a special secret ingredient - once my beef had drained I mixed in bout a cup of my leftover manwiich/sloppy joe meat. YUMMY!

This was a hit at my house, but I made some changed.  I swapped sour cream for Miracle Whip since that didn't seem to fit in the recipe.  My son doesn't like corn so I left that out and made it as a side veggie.  I did add a bit of onion to the ground beef and used a medium chunky salsa. Also, I didn't crunch the nacho chips, I used tortilla strips and left them in big pieces so they didn't get as mushy.

This recipe is a good starter recipe. I made this and took the advice of reviewers and subbed sour cream with a heaping tablespoon of mayo, that way it worked for my family. It wasn't bad. The next day however the flavors settled and it was a great dish! I also added refried beans on top which I think helped the dish out a lot. I will be making this again with my added changes.

Made this recipe last night. There is none left. He ate this like he was starving and then asked for more. He had another heaping plate for dinner. He asked me when I was going to make it again.

I liked this very much. Was thrilled with it, except the fact that it didn't serve very nicely, and did sort of resemble a bowl of dog food (as other reviewers also pointed out. I expected it to look like your photo, which was very appealing. It did not. 

But it tasted incredible, so I am willing to forgive. A lot. I am so thrilled to be moving beyond the sphaghetti/meatloaf/lasagna rotation. 

As one other reviewer suggested, I did layer the casserole, but only put cheese on the top and not between the layers. Cover your casserole before baking (we tented with foil).

I read several reviews before making this recipe. I made the following changes/additions: I used 2 lbs of ground beef (package it came in). I used sour cream instead of salad dressing, ~ 1 c. (had to use it). I used one packet of taco seasoning (to which I added ~ 1/2 tsp each: smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne and oregano). I added one finely chopped chipotle pepper with about 1/2 tbs. adobo sauce that it was packed in. I added the following vegetables: one can of mushrooms, 1 finely chopped red pepper, 2 med. finely chopped onions and one grated carrot. I added ~3/4 cup of chili sauce 

I cooked all of these ingredients with the beef before baking. Will make repeatedly. Fantastic!

Holy moly this was good!  I browned the meat with some diced onions.  Instead of chili powder I used a packet of taco seasoning.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream for the "creamy dressing."  I added some sliced black olives, since I had an opened can.  This recipe is very versile.  You can add kidney or black beans.  I served this with sliced avocado.  DELISH!!

My husband and I enjoyed this.  Only thing I did different was use mexican cheese blend instead of colby.  I used Tostito brand Artisan 4 Cheese Queso tortilla chips which I think added some flavor.  Hubby had seconds and that is always a good sign.  I enjoyed the miracle whip in this recipe.  I don't like sour cream in my mexican food so this is a great recipe for me.

very good basic mexican casserole. After reading reviews, I also added a can of refried beans, and only used sour cream, NO mayo! Added a tsp of ground cumin, since we love that flavor. Used combination of fritos and crushed tortilla chips, as that's what I had on hand.

Thought that I would go out on a limb and try this simple and quick option, but wasn't expecting what I got.  My family LOVED this including my 3 little girls.  Two of my girls even asked for thirds!!  It only got 4 starts because I opted to use sour cream instead of the miracle whip and seasoned the beef a bit when I browned it.  Definitely will be making this again.

I made this with sour cream and cheddar cheese. Cooked the beef with taco seasoning and added a few diced tomatoes. It was really yummy, but rich..

Made it as is and it's terrific!  My two young kids and husband enjoyed every bite.  It's a keeper and now has taken over as favorite recipe.  The only thing I did different was once I browned the meat a bit I added the chili powder just to get the flavor 'locked in.'

The first time I made this I thought it was good, not great.  The 2nd time, we used mayonnaise because we did not have Miracle Whip.  It was even better!  I know that mayo/Miracle Whip is a personal preference but us - this made it go from 4 stars to 5!

I like it a lot but, yes, change the dressing to sour cream and add taco seasoning...I made it with all Mayo and changed chili powder to taco seasoning.  Too much zing from the Mayo.. But VERY good otherwise and EASY and quick to make!!!

I can review this with one word only......YUMMY.  I made this one for my granddaughters and all of us enjoyed it.  It makes a very large amount, so be ready to have left overs, or freeze leftovers for another day.  I served a small salad on the side and it was a great, fast, and tasty meal.

My family did not like this dish. It smelled good but it looked like mushy dog food when it was finished.  The mircle whip give it a funky taste. Overall it was just bland.

This was very yummy.  I made my own tortilla chips by baking some corn tortillas.  I also used sour cream, like several other reviews suggested.  I added black beans to the mix to make it a little heartier.

It was decent.  I followed everything exactly.  It was a little too sweet for what I was expecting.  Reading through the other reviews now I wish I would have done sour cream instead of miracle whip but I was scared since this was the first time I made it.  I will probably make it again because it was so easy but not going to be an all the time dish.

This was excellent as is. All I did was keep it in 10 minutes longer for more browning and used some of my own cheese, which is Cheddar because it has more flavor and leftover corn because it was there! I will, of course, try some of the other suggestions but I liked how the salad dressing added that little bit of extra flavor!

This was a big hit at our house, even my fussy kids liked it.  I did sub some of the mayo for sour cream and use taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  Also, I used flavored  chips (doritos) to add more spice.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was pretty good.  I think it would be good with spanish rice or beans mixed in and I may try that next time.

This was a good recipe. I suggest to swap sour cream for the mayo. I turned out great. Thanks for the recipe

Added onion and black beans. Tripled the chili powder. Used sour cream instead of mayonnaise.

I do like to follow recipes exactly, but I did replace the mayo with sour cream and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder, because that is what I had on hand and it did sound good. I also used Mexican cheese mix...my hubby was talking to me while I was making this and as soon as I added the top layer of cheese, I realized that I forgot to add the top layer of nacho chips...so I improvised and added the leftover nachos to the finished product, which added just the right amount of crunch. Scrumptious!! My hubby and I loved this dish! It was so simple to make and it also keeps well in the fridge- I rarely like eating leftovers for lunch the next day but I devoured it. Thank you so much, I will probably make this a weekly thing! By the way, this is a great alternative for tacos or burritos if you like the taste, but don't like the mess!

I used a packet of taco seasoning and some chili powder. I also used about 1-1.5 Tablespoons of miracle whip and 1/2 cup of sourcream. For the cheese, I used whatever we had on hand, and for the chips I used cheese flavored tortilla chips. I put mine in a small baking dish instead of a casserole dish and baked it for only about ten minutes or so cuz the chips started to get too dark.

This was excellent, my whole family loved it.  My only change was 1 cup each of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese instead of 2 cups of Colby.  Will definitely make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and my family wasn't crazy about this.  They ate it, but said they would rather me not make it again.  I thought it was ok - not good or bad, therefore the 3 rating.  The taste was somewhat bland and it was a little dry.  We added salsa and sour cream to make it somewhat better.

Overall concept was good.  However, next time I'd make it with much less mayo or none at all.  Would probably add a little more heat/spice to it, too. Thanks for the idea.

This is a really good and easy recipe. I did half and half salsa plus rotel and while I was browning the burger I cut up an onion and sautee'd it with the meat.  I used sour cream instead of miracle whip and used half and half Colby cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. We had refried beans on the side and of course more chips.  What a great flavor this dish has. I highly recommend this.

I used fajita seasoning as recommended by another reviewer. I was afraid there would not be enough flavor, as they were.  Too much!! I wish I had left well enough alone. I also substituted sour cream instead of the Miracle Whip.  I think that's a risk. I will make this again, for sure.  But I will keep it closer to the recipe or use taco seasoning instead.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  I decreased the chili powder to about 1/2 tsp in hopes that the two children 6 & 9 would like it,  but they thought it was too spicy and didn't care for the salsa.  We will make it again, but might modify the to make it less hot.  Also substituted plain yogurt for mayo to reduce fat content.

I know I'm in the minority but my very hungry high school football player took a bite after a hard practice and then asked for a grilled cheese and tomato soup.  He loves mexican food - maybe adding fresh crunchy lettuce, peppers, on top, etc would make it more appetizing.

I made it according to recipe and did not like it. The miracle whip is what made it taste bad, if there was a more tasty substitute then it might taste better.

This is my new "go to" recipe.  It's quick, easy and delicious--and the leftovers are great (if there are any).  I cook onion with my ground beef and used sour cream instead of Miracle Whip, as others suggested.  Can easily be doubled to fit in a 9x13 dish and feed a larger crowd.  Highly recommend!

Overall solid dish. Will add red pepper flakes or more cayenne next time to up the heat factor. Make sure chips are finely crushed- too course makes the top layer hard to break through.

Wonderful!  My family loves sour cream so I used that instead of mayo but will make it next time with the mayo to see the difference.  I liked that it had corn in it so my kids would get a veggie but I only had a 15 oz can of corn (instead of 10 oz) and I used the whole thing.  Too much corn.  Less would be better.  As another suggested, this would be good to wrap in tortillas or I think just as a dip!  Yummy! Thanks so much!

Really good. I've never been a fan of Miracle Whip, so when I make it again (which I will) I'll probably try it with sour cream or something, since I saw another review which said to try that. But overall, I'd recommend making this.

We all liked this.  DH even said it was good the next day in his lunch!  I used 1 home canned tomatoes and 1 home canned salsa.  Subbed sour cream for SOME of the mayo (becuz almost out of mayo).  Put 1/2 in the freezer, plan on baking it in a 8x8 pan and layer with chips and cheese.

This is a good backbone to build off of depending on what your family likes.  Overall, it was a good dish but my family will be adding black beans, more cheese in the middle and more chips on the top layer.  Definitely worth a try for anybody wondering tough

I gave it 5 stars because it is so easy and pretty darn good.  I used lean beef and cooked it with some onion then used 1/2 cup light sour cream, 2 tablespoons light mayo, taco seasoning, and mexi corn, and 1 cup salsa.  I added a layer of refried black beans and used baked scoop chips (crushed) and weight watcher's mexican blend cheese.  I also covered it for the first 15 min of baking then cooked uncovered for another 10.  Turned out pretty good, even the hubby liked it!

This was good as written.  I didn't have any plain corn so substituted a 10 oz. can of southwestern style, but made no other changes.  I will make it again and probably experiment some by adding chopped green peppers and onions and perhaps try different cheeses.  It is a little bland, so I'll probably add more spices, maybe use taco seasoning as suggested by others. Overall, though, a good recipe to add to the file.

My rating may not be fair because I didn't have Colby and I used mild cheddar cheese. My husband just said "don't make it again".

I didn't expect this casserole to be so good.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I thought the tortilla chips would come out limp, but they remained crispy.  This is a true 5-star recipe.

A great recipe,very simple to make I took the advice from other reviews and used the 1 cup sour cream w/ 1 large dollop of mayo.Used refried beans and frozen corn,sliced black olives. Added some hot pepper flakes as we like hot! I only baked for about 15 min. and it was ready. Thanks for a great recipe! Hubby said it was delish!

This was a great casserole.  I did make some changes though based on other reviews & my families preferences.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, 1 1/2 cups salsa, 1 can Mexicorn, 1 c sour cream, 1 package of taco seasoning, 2 c crushed tortilla chips, 2 cups Taco cheese, half a can of refried beans & some black olives.  I baked in a 9x13 pan at 350 for around 15 minutes.  In the middle of the layers I added dollops of the refried beans.  After it came out of the oven I let it cool for a bit & then added a little cream cheese on top with some sliced black olives.  Will definitely make again!

This rocks! I was out of tortillas so I whipped up a batch of corn bread & put it on top, like a cobbler. I made changes due to what I had: used ground turkey; frozen corn; 1/4 c lite sr cream b& no mayo (which was enough creaminess for me); 2 T taco seasoning; sautedd the meat w/ chopped onion, bell pepper, and 3 cloves minced garlic; added 2 T fresh chopped cilantro; used 1/2cup shredded mexican blend cheese before put the cornbread on. It was amazing!!

This is an excellent casserole.  My family all said it is definitely a keeper!  I didn't have any salsa, so I used a can of tomatoes and green chilies, and I also added green and black olives.  YUM!

I had to change a few things with the recipe due to being allergic to corn. I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 t chili powder, 1/2 c sour cream, 1 1/2 c salsa for meat mixture. made as directed minus corn. spread out in 9 x 13 and cover with 1 lb of refried beans. Cover with layers of chips and 4 c shredded nacho taco cheese. Turned out fabulous. The hole family loved it and it made a large amount very inexpensively.

I enjoyed this casserole.  I used sour cream instead of mayo, and frozen corn instead of canned.  It was really good!  The only thing I would do differently next time is use Medium salsa instead of Mild.  I just want a little more kick.  For a simple and fairly quick recipe, this is great!

This was a great recipe.  I did follow the advice of other posters, subbing in taco seasoning and sour cream.  I think the next time I make it I will skip the corn chips entirely.  They work well for the initial serving, but not so well for left overs.  Everyone loved it, mission accomplished.

Very good!  A nice change from our usual weekly mexican dishes.  I used sour 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo, basically because I was out of mayo.  I also used Doritos.

Delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good for a taco/ nacho casserole.  I have made several with different variations and this one is a keeper.  The only changes I made was to use sour cream instead of Miracle Whip and I mixed the beef mixture with the sour cream and put that in the bottom of the pan, then the chips, then put the cheese on top.  I will be making this again and again.

This was really good, I thought it was gonna be so so, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you have fussy eaters in your house like me this is a staple dish and is really easy to make and serve a lot of people ... unlike tacos.

I used sour cream like everyone else mentioned. Also I used taco seasoning, I put about 4th of a packet while browning the meat then a teaspoon when I mixed everything.

I only put in 1 cup of salsa (medium heat, mild would have no heat) and upped the sour cream to a full cup.

I think the key to this is using quality chips (I use hav a chips) and organic salsa.

Not bad.  I used the sour cream like everyone else, and Taco seasoning.  I also used tortillas cut in cubes in stead of chips.  The idea of mushy chips just freaks me out.  I made enough to make two, one for today and one to freeze.  I served with chips on the side and it worked.  So I will make it again.

I did not like this recipe at all! I usually try to give the recipe a shot and follow the same ingredients. I should have looked at some of the other suggestions! It would have been ok but there was way too much salsa. Definetly cut back on that!

This was a great recipe base for my household.  I used 2# of hamburger and used taco bell taco seasoning as well as a 1/2 cup of salsa with the hamburger mixture.  I also added refried beans.  Then I used 2 cups of a Mexican blend of cheeses, and layered 2 times.  I took out the corn, and the chips, and the other stuff.  I was afraid the chips would be soggy, so we used Frito Lay corn chip scoops, and had sour cream and salsa on the side.  There wasn't anything left after dinner!!  Even my 2 year old tore it up!!

I usually ask my husband to rate new dinners on a scale of 1-10 and he gave this one a 10.5 and said it was probably the best thing I'd ever made.  I used Tastefully Simple Corn, Black Bean Salsa, and about 2/3 of a 15oz can of corn.  Everything else was the same - it was excellent!  He was happy that there were leftovers that he took to work for lunch the next day, he said it reheated well too!

Thank you for a slice of my bf's past. This is the dish from his college days that I have been trying to recreate for several years. I did use Rotel instead of the salsa and Mayo instead of the "salad dressing", but I left the rest of the recipe alone. You made me a hero at dinner tonight.

Good recipe! I made it with the intention of it being a "main dish" but at the end realized it would be better presented as a dip. Took suggestion of others and added red onion to the meat while browning. Overall good recipe and will make again for a party or gathering.

It was just okay.. for us. Followed the recipe pretty consistent.. it was more of a appetizer with chips than a meal.

I made a few minor modifications:  I used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. regular mayo instead of the called for 3/4 c. salad dressing.  Instead of the chili powder, I used Tastefully Simple Brand Wahoo Chili Seasoning.  I also used the Mexican Style Shredded Cheese.  Turned out great.  Super easy for a quick dinner!

This recipe turned out good. The kids enjoyed it and want me to make it again. We liked the creaminess of having the miracle whip in the casserole. I doubled the recipe and had no leftovers. Very simple and quick.

My husband and children enjoyed this for dinner last night, well save one very picky eater.  Next time I believe I will use sour cream in place of the mayo. I think that will make it even better. Its quick and easy to make. Just what I need with four kids on the go all the time.

Good and easy.  Tasted a lot like tamales. I substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder, shredded cheddar for the Colby, and 1/2 Miracle whip, 1/2 sour cream.  Also added garlic and onion.

Good base recipe that you can adapt to suit your tastes or what's in your pantry. I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder, sour cream instead of mayo, and added refried black beans. I served the corn on the side (not everyone likes corn on our family) as well as a boxed Mexican rice. I liked mine scooped on top of some shredded lettuce with extra chips and salsa. Not something I would make for company, but great for a quick weekday meal. We could all use more of those quick, easy, and good recipes!

My kids and hubby liked it. I definetly used the sour cream and not Miracle whip, and some taco seasoning.  I thought it was good too, as I sat there and keep dippng chips into it, but I dont like it for a sit down meal for myself, but when I'm throwing something together for the gang really quick I will definetly use this recipe on my list for quick and easy.

I followed the directions and it wasn't the greatest.  My husband was the only one who liked it.  It would probably be better with sour cream instead of salad dressing, to me that was all you could taste.  I might make it again with a few changes.

This recipe is very easy and quick to make and tastes even better the next day.  The only change I would make next time would be to add taco seasoning to the beef and add the remaining ingredients as suggested.  Very good and will make again.

This was wonderful.  I don't use miracle whip, and didn't want to buy any for one recipe so I substituted sour cream for it, absolutely great.  I'm always worried about trying new recipes, but this turned out great.

This was great!  Easy and quick, and everybody loved it.  I used 16 oz. salsa, sour cream instead of salad dressing and omitted the corn.  Also, I didn't add the sour cream to the beef mixture but made its own layer between the tortilla chips and cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe, we'll be making again and again!

My family loved this. I made it as stated on the recipe with the exception of adding some black beans to fill out the recipe a little more. My husband ate half the pan that night and it was finished the next day. I was a little wary of the miracle whip but used it any way and liked the zippy taste that it added that sour cream would not have. Thanks!

Very good.  Followed advice of others and used sour cream instead of mayo, added a package of taco seasoning to the ground beef, used Pace picante sauce for the salsa, crushed cheese doritos, and it went over big.  Some dipped tostito's some just ate from a bowl.  Very quick and easy, little clean up.  Would have given 5 stars, but seemed just a bit dry.  Will make again.

The whole family loved it. It was so easy to make. I used taco seasoning, doritos and sour cream because it was what I had on hand. Hubby and kids went back for seconds. Will make again.

I used sour cream mixed with half a package of taco seasoning instead of the Miracle Whip and chili powder and also added a clove of garlic.  I wish I hadn't added the clove of garlic as it didn't need the extra flavor - the salsa provided enough!  I also did not add the tortilla chips until 15 minutes into baking (because I was afraid of too much sogginess with the leftovers) and after topping the dish with tortilla chips I let it bake for 5 more minutes with a little extra cheese on top.  I put refried beans in but I think next time I will just use some black beans as it would work well with the corn.  I also used Boca burger veggie crumbles which worked out great in place of the ground beef.  Thanks for your suggestions!

What is not to love about this recipe? it was AWESOME!! I originally thought that this dish would be a little dry because of the tortilla chips but it was extremely flavorful.Plus I like the fact that it has corn which the kids normally don't care for. so they not only get a delicious meat treat but also they get those veggies!!!!

My family love this recipe. I leave out the chilli though 'cause we're light weights.  I also prefer real mayo. My 3 and 5 year old like to eat it with sour cream dubbed on top.

I thought this tasted decent.  My kids didn't like it because of the salsa I put in it.  We are still working on liking onions, peppers, and tomatoes.  The Miracle Whip gave it a unique flavor.  I think I'll try sour cream next time and the taco seasoning like the other reviewers mentioned.

My family really liked this recipe...I thought that the miracle whip taste was way too strong.  I added some sliced jalapenos and hot sauce to mine to make it spicier, but I could still taste the miracle whip.

This dish was ok.  My boyfriend wasn't too fond of it, and my son hated the tangy taste that the salad dressing adds to the flavor.  I liked it.  It was different than anything I have ever tasted before!

Great, easy and so tasty. Next time I will add a can of green chopped chilis.  I also used half Boca and half beef on this  because I ran short on beef. It was really yummy!

Quick, delicious and very popular.  I also made a lower fat version (extra lite sour cream in stead of dressing, very lean beef and low fat cheddar cheese) and added some fresh garlic. It tasted just as good!

I made this tonight with a few alterations, and it was really good.  I only had cream-style corn, and so I used that instead of whole kernel.  Instead of mayo, I used a half-cup of milk.  And my kids were impatient so I just put half a bag of shredded cheese and a bowl of leftover pasta shells into the pan and finished cooking it there, not it in the oven.  They didn't eat the pasta but asked for tortilla chips to eat it like dip.  A new standby is born!

Very easy and my family loves it.  I used salsa with corn already in it so I didn't need to add any extra corn.  The left overs reheat well. I also froze one.  It worked well to cook it after it had thawed completely.  The only change I made was to add the final layer of chips and cheese after it had thawed.

i thought this was tasty but my husband wasn't impressed. I used sour cr in place of salad drsg and used crushed Dorito's for added taste. I would recomm. using a good salsa since it's so improtant in the taste. I used a crummy store brand (all I had) which probably didn't help...VERY EASY to make...

Just so/so...I added sour cream instead of the Miracle Whip and Taco Seasoning instead of the chili powder.  The finished product tasted okay, but it looked like dog food.  I didn't want to say anything while we were eating, just in case my husband was enjoying it, but when we were finished I said, 'You know what that stuff looked like?', he said 'DOG FOOD.  I felt like I was eating Alpo'.  I guess he was thinking the same thing.

I made this exactly as the recipes said and it wasn't the best. Of the 5 of us, I was the only one who really ate any of it. In the recipe where it says "salad dressing e.g. miracle whip" I took lunch lady's word for it and used miracle whip eventhough it sounded kind of yucky to me. I think it would've been good with something other than miracle whip. I might try the recipe again and use sour cream instead of miracle whip.

Did some changing-had 1 lb of left over sloppy joe meat-added 8 ounces of sour cream too it,mexi corn and 1 package of taco seasoning. Did not add salsa to keep chips crispy and served the salsa on top after cooking. Tasty-a little zesty for the kids though.

This recipe couldn't have been easier or faster to make, was made of ingredients I had on hand, and -  most important - it got "two thumbs up" from my picky teenage food critics.  I added sides of rice and cornbread, and everyone was a happy camper!

Very good recipe.  I made some changes that I had read on other ratings.  I used ranch instead of mayo, taco seasoning instead of chilli powder and I used Cool Ranch Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips.  It was great, very fast and easy.  My husband loved it.

This was very good.  I substituted sour cream for the mayo, used nacho cheese Doritos, and marble jack and cheddar cheeses.  My husband, 4 year old, 2 year old, and I all enjoyed it.  I 1 1/2 the recipe so we had leftovers which were just as good.

What a wonderful recipe!  My husband and I both enjoyed this.  Instead of Miracle Whip, I used 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning.  Instead of corn, I added a can of black beans, drained.  I also topped it with chili peppers and served it with tortilla chips.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good and very filling. I rinsed the ground beef to cut down on the fat...it seemed like it'd be pretty greasy otherwise.

To help make this casserole more of a meal I added boiled Spanish Rice (I packet of Lipton's Spanish seasoned rice.) I also added a can of drained black beans and left out the salad dressing, but put a drop of sour cream on each serving. I pretty much made a different recipe, but it was good.

I also changed a couple things. Instead of Dressing I added 1/2 cup of sour cream as suggested from another preparer and I added taco seasoning. It was awesome , quick and cheap as well as easy. I will make it again definately

I really loved this dish - we all had seconds and thirds! As the other reviewers suggested, I substituted sour cream for mayo and 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning for the chili powder. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  I used ranch dressing instead of the mayo like other reviewers had suggested and I also added a can of Rotel.  It had some kick to it, but very very good.  I would definatly make this again!

Very easy to make. All six of my family members loved it. Maybe a little bit too much mayo, but still very good!
