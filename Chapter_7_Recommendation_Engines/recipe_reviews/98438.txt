I also tried the recipe and it is way off. I was determined to make it work, so i tried it with 1/2 the baking powder, 1/2 the liquid, added 1/2 cup of water, 1 apple diced very small.  I didnt make the sauce as i thought it was way too fattening, i just put light syrup on top.
They were thick, and very hearty pancakes, very filling, but good after the modifications.

With some modifications, this recipe could be a good one. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder (1/4 cup of a rising agent is way too much), the 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/4 cup honey (pancakes need sweetener in my opinion!), 2 eggs, and 1/4 cup canola oil. This at least will give you a good basic pancake recipe. From here, add or omit the cinnamon, apples, etc. Didn't do the glaze, but a brown sugar glaze sounds intriguing.

I'm glad I didn't read any reviews first or I might have been scared away.  GLAD I WASN'T!  I halved everything in the recipe to feed fewer ~ I thought they turned out great but I had to add a little more milk to thin them out since I like thinner pancakes.  I'm not sure why so many people feel they need to modify this recipe... I think you should take them at face value.  With whole wheat flour and no sugar, this recipe will only appeal to a few people.  Our family was one.  Everyone devoured them!  I didn't make the brown sugar glaze but if I did I sure wouldn't want sugar in the cakes PLUS this glaze on top.

This recipe did not work at all. There is far, far too much baking powder, too much liquid, and the apple chunks are too large. It took quite a bit of doctoring to make it edible.

this was a hard lesson for me in reading the reviews of others before making a recipe.  you definitely don't need that much baking powder.

I made this exactly the way the recipe called it, except I used sea salt instead of  salt. Pretty good except I agree, way too much baking powder, the batter was very "fluffy" but it helped to encompass the apple chunks. Pancakes were a little dry but the brown sugar glaze was SO good and helped. I used light brown sugar because I didn't have any dark on hand.

These are really good, not sure why there are all these negative reviews!  The consistency was good, not too sloppy at all.  The only change I made based on the reviews was to reduce the baking powder to 2 1/2 tsp.  I didn't miss a sweetener and served them with regular syrup.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe.

This looked like a lovely recipe, but there was WAY too much baking powder.  I would say use half the required amount at most.  Otherwise, though, they were great, and with a modification or two I would probably make these again.

the thought is good, but i don't see how this could be a healthy alternative with a whole cup of butter and a whole cup of brown sugar --its probably worse that regular pancakes!  will definitely try this recipe with some modifications.  perhaps with a topping of a cinnamon topping made with applesauce.

This recipe turned out great. I was scared of the amount of baking powder but it turned out well, the pancakes turned out nice and fluffy. I added some vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar, oats and wheat germ. The kids loved them and asked for seconds. I did not make the topping, I was looking for a nutritous breakfast for the kids and all that butter would of defeated the purpose.

Surprisingly light!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, added a bit of brown sugar, increased the cinnamon.  On the advice of other reviewers I decreased the baking powder, but next time I make this recipe I will add a bit more.  We would have liked them to have been a bit fluffier.  Did not make the glaze, just ate them with pure maple syrup.  Also, the next time I make this recipe I will add some chooped walnuts or pecans.

Its a nice recipe, apart from the bake powder amount. There is no way so much baking powder can be healthy. Other than that its Great! I added baking powder to my like

Best pancakes ever!  We added 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the pancakes and used syrup instead of molasses because we didn't have any.  We also only made half of the glaze and still had some left over.  Amazing!  And only 1,000 calories per serving :)

I took the advice of another reviewer and used only 4 tsps of baking soda.  I also used 3 tsps of ground cinnamon because I love extra cinnamon.  The pancakes had so much potential but they still tasted like baking soda.  I also didn't do the glaze.

I absolutely did not use 1/4 c. of baking powder. I used a couple tsp. and added a little vanilla and nutmeg. After reading the reviews, I decided to use applesauce in place of the oil and start with 1 cup of buttermilk and keep adding until it seemed the right consistancy. I did toss the shredded apples with the dry ingredients before adding in the wet ingredients. The topping was a nice compliment to the pancakes, I'm really glad I cut it in half. If I'd made the whole amount, it would have been overkill. Good idea for a recipe, it just needs a tweak here and there.

I was looking for a wholesome, sweet-tasting recipe my whole family would like, but this recipe was a little heavy on the baking powder, and we could tell.  Reduce the baking powder about a tablespoon and substitute a tablespoon of sugar, and this recipe would probably hit the spot.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this. I took the recipe down to 2 servings, and it STILL seemed like a ton of the baking powder. That HAD to have been a typo, no? Anyway, breakfast was great... enjoyed these pancakes along with scrambled eggs with fresh scallions and a couple diced Li'l Smokies :P

This recipe is quite good.  I did add 1/3 cup of Splenda and 1/2 tsp of baking soda which made it even better!  PEOPLE...there is a difference between baking powder and baking soda.

Overall a good pancake. I did cut the baking powder down and I added a little vanilla. I didn't try the glaze but plan on trying it at some point.

I found the pancakes to be alright.  They needed a little less baking soda and a little more sweet.  The glaze did not work at all.  All the molasses ust sank to the bottom and there was too much of it.

I modified this to be healthier.  I cut the recipe in half.  is ed 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/ 2 cup Greek yogurt instead if milk.  1 and 1/2 tap baking powder and 3 tbspoon apple sauce instead of the oil. made 4 4 inch pancakes.  perfect for 21 day fit fix which would be 1 yellow, half a red, a quarter blue and two Tsp.   if you need syrup then add 2 tablespoons but count half a yellow.

The only things I changed was I didn't have but 3/4 cup of milk at the time.  So I filled the rest with thin applesauce, added a cup of brown sugar and put in only 3 tablespoons of Baking Powder.  It turned out very very good!
