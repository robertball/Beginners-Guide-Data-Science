I'm always looking for new ways to prepare asparagus because I eat it quite often. This is quick, easy, and very flavorful.  I like the Asian twist. I served this with grilled salmon and it was the perfect meal. Thanks for the great recipe naturalbornhealer!

I made this for my family this evening for dinner, my first time cooking asparagus on a stove top and it was delicious. I quadrupled all liquids to end with a little sauce to put over brown rice and it was perfect! My husband and kids loved it, we will be using this recipe often.

Easy recipe. I subbed  2 T of tamari sauce for soy sauce. Way too salty and we like salty. I had very thin asparagus so that may have been the difference. Iâ€™ll try again with less tamari.

Added mushrooms.  Soy gives it extra delicious kick.

Easy to make! I tossed in  some sliced baby Bella mushrooms and added a dash of powdered ginger!  Great over rice.  I'll be taking this to work for a healthy meatless lunch!

Easy and very good. I added some red pepper flakes while cooking, and topped the asparagus with sesame seeds when they were done. Very tasty, I will make it again.

Good flavor, but not convincing enough for my kids to love it. I personally would make these again. I did steam them x5 minutes. They were a little too soft. I will definitely steam them for a little less time, as aldente is better.

I was looking for a simple way to fix asparagus and something different. Loved this recipe.  My husband loved it too!
