I just now came across this recipe and relized that I make these all the time! I do brown the chicken first on the stove before putting it in the oven, though. Sometimes I serve them just as is, and sometimes I'll add toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo (trust me, it's awesome!) This is a great way to make a different meal out of leftover chicken parmesan. Do try it! :)

Yum! I seasoned the chicken before breading, but otherwise followed the recipe. Super tasty. Thanks! :)

DIDN'T MAKE THE HEROS, BUT OTHERWISE, FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO A T. THE FAMILY LOVED IT. I LIKED THE BAKED AS OPPOSED TO FRIED.

I thought this recipe was super easy to make and super yummy. I did change a few things. I used a different pasta sauce. It was barillia (sp) evoo and garlic sauce which gave it a great flavor. I also used hoagie rolls that I sliced and smeared with butter then put it in the oven for a few minutes. Will make again.

pretty good idea, will make again using less sauce....they kinda just drowned in it.  will tweak to our tastes, thanks for a super easy dinner idea, though!

I liked this recipe. It was easy and fast. My changes are that I cut it down to two servings, which worked out great. Next time I will add a bit more cheese on top. Also, I served it with a side of pasta instead of on bread. It was very tasty that way too! The time seemed pretty accurate as well. If you need a quick, yummy meal, this is perfect!
