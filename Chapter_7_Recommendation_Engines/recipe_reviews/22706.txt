Delish stuffing! I didn't grill it, I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.I'll probably use this stuffing in other dishes like...stuffed shrimp, mushrooms and in puffed pastry as an appy.Sooo good!!!

This is a very simple, rich stuffing recipe that isn't just butter and ritz crackers.  I have used it to stuff jumbo shrimp when lobster is not an option.  I usually double the stuffing, even for only 2 people.  I am really pleased with this dish!

It was good, but not the best I've had.  I felt the stuffing lacked seasoning. I will make it again, but will use additional seasonings.

Four stars, and darned near five! I baked these, 425 degrees, about 15 minutes, using the four (6 ounce) tails as directed. They were tender, sweet and moist - perfectly done. I highly recommend cold water tails rather than warm if possible. The crab meat filling seemed like it could use a little spunk, so I used about 2 T. of chopped red bell pepper instead of celery and I believe that was a  positive change and contribution.  I also added about another 2 T. of melted butter to ensure the topping would be sinfully rich and moist.  With my usual consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I omitted the cayenne pepper, choosing a few grinds of freshly ground pepper instead.  For the bread crumbs I crushed some crostini and added a little Parmesan cheese. Bottom line?  This was excellent  - not "overworked and overdone." When you're paying big bucks for jumbo lump crabmeat and lobster tails, you want to taste THAT, not a bunch of other stuff.

WOW!  This was SO good!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs around, so I ground up some cheddar chex mix (delicious!).  I also doubled the stuffing.  If you double the stuffing, I would actually suggest baking the lobster for a few minutes first, and then putting the stuffing on top for the last 5 minutes or so... our stuffing started to burn (I actually took it off the lobster in the middle of cooking, and then put it back on towards the end) It looked so fancy!  Try this!  You won't be disappointed!

The crab stuffing was awesome.  I am going to use it often.  Plan to make Filet Mignon stuffed with crab and this recipe will be perfect.

This was wonderful.  I made it for my husband for Father's day and we loved it.  I thought it was very easy to prepare  and looked great coming off the grill.  This is now an all time favorite.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Delicious. Had 4 small lobster tails -- single batch of stuff was more than sufficient. Cooking time seemed perfect as well.

This is a great way to jazz up your lobster tail.  I read other reviews and decided to broil lobster breifly before adding stuffing to make sure the lobster did get thoroughly cooked. I then added sesoned stuffing to lobster and broiled until stuffing was cooked.  Only takes 4-9 minutes.  Very quick, very good, and very easy.  Great recipe.

The only reason this gets a 3 is because I change a few things so a 1/2 wouldn't be fair.  First, the cayanne was overpowering, and we couldn't taste the crab!  I dont like celery, so I used celery salt instead..always a good substitute.  Then, the lobster cooked unevenly and the stuffing was burned on top and still cold on bottom.  I don't have a grill, so I baked it at 425 F for 20 mins (this cooking method was from another recipe).  When we spraped the stuffing off and dipped the lobster in lemon garlic butter, it was great!  But that was plain lobster, w/o the wierd stuffing.  I would recomend using fewer spices if you want to be able to taste the crab, and if you're a spicy whimp like me.  The worst part.....the lobster tails took me 1/2 hr to cut opn two!!! sooooo much hard work.

This was amazing! however  I did boil the lobster with seasonings and beer to give it lots of flavor and then in place in oven with the stuffing. I also added  shrimp, bell peppers, and mushrooms to the stuffing with seafood seasoning Old bay.  i doubled the suffing and added bread crumbs to half of it the other half I added heavy cream and served it with white rice, baked potatoes in oven with garlic salt, Parmesan cheese, and dill. Served with asparagus and mixed green salad and garlic bread. Family loved  it and couldn't stop talking about how amazing this dinner was, said it's was better than any  rest food

Baked at 400 for 20 minutes, turned out perfectly cooked and delicious.  Stuffing has a little kick with the cayenne, but just the right amount.  Nice Valentine's Day dinner!  Made as directed, with three 4 oz. tails.  Good amount of stuffing.

My family loved it! It was my first time cooking lobster, and I must say this was easy. I put my own twist in the stuffing. I added 3 table spoons of chopped garlic, green bell pepper , Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, and lastly I added 1 tblsp of garlic salt. The cheeses really made the flavors pop. I had plenty of stuffing left over so I made what my kids call " crabby patties". It was all very yummy. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I think if I added more salt to the recipe, it will be more flavorful. The crabmeat stuffing really made it very nice. 
If I make it next time, my veggies sidedish will be something creamy.
