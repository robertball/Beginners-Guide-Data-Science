I was terribly disappointed in these zucchini sticks. I made them exactly as the recipe indicated and they simply tasted like fried bread crumbs.I'd printed the recipe out months ago so I didn't have the numerous changes from the reviews to factor in, but I was certain they'd be tasty after reading the description on the recipe itself. The first problem I ran into was the recipe calls for heavy cream...but nowhere in the instructions does it say to WHIP it. Instead the instructions begin by saying to mix the whipped cream with the eggs. THERE'S A CRUCIAL STEP LEFT OUT IN THIS RECIPE. Additionally, these are extremely bland. Some spices desperately need to be added to the crumb mixture. After reading the reviews today, I see that there are a number of things others have done to produce a more tasty zucchini stick. But after doing that...I feel that I now have a different recipe and not this one. I L-O-V-E fried zucchini, but was sorely disappointed in these and will not be making them again.

This is a tasty treat. I don't deep fry it though, I just cover the bottom of a skillet with oil and turn the zucchini over after the first side is browned. Mix some grated parmesan in with the crumbs for extra flavor. You can also make round slices instead of strips.

An easy recipe for one of  the greatest snacks/appetizers ever. My family has made these for years. Two suggestions: 1.) Before dipping zucchini in egg mixture, coat lightly with flour. The egg sticks better. And 2.) To taste the authentic Italian side dish, add a little garlic powder to your batter and after frying, sprinkle with grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.  Oh, man -- perfection...

Oooooh sooooo good! Just like you get in restaurants! DEFINENTLY coat zucchini slices with flour before dipping into egg mixture so it sticks and DEFINENTLY sprinkle with salt and pepper and parmesan after frying. Delicious - we even forgot to use any dip, just ate them up as soon as they were cool enough!

My first time making these, and they are excellent!!!  The table cream makes all the difference, but I love garlic, so I added garlic and onion powder, and a couple of sprinkles of italian seasoning.  Once finished cooking, I added some grated parmesan cheese all over the top with a little more salt and pepper, and PERFECTION!!  I will definitely make this recipe again!!  Thanx LaDonna!  :)

I marinated my zucchini sticks in italian dressing overnight first and used plain bread crumbs instead. They tasted fabulous, but I had trouble getting the breading to stick once I fried them. Nothing I tried seemed to work. Great dipped in ranch dressing.

A great way to get rid of extra zucchini!  I agree with others who said to dip in flour before the egg mixture.  It sticks better that way.

These were just okay.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the batter didn't stick well to the zucchini, so the end result was closer to fried plain zucchini rather then the batter coated, deep fried zucchini sticks I sometimes order in restaurants.  I'm not ready to give up on this recipe just yet though.  I'll have to try these one more time and see if they turn out better next time.

Added some additional seasoning and instead of cutting into sticks, I just sliced the zucchini. Never tried the ranch dressing, maybe will next time. Overall, I liked but my kids didn't care for them.

These were very good but a little time consuming to make.  Perhaps that is because I used one huge zucchini and cut it into smaller strips, about 1/2" thick - maybe they were a little too small.  I took others' recommendations of adding garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese when they came out of the deep fryer.  Delicious!  A little greasy but we enjoyed them.  A great way to use up an abundance of zucchini.

This is like the appetizer at Carrabbas Italian Grill. They make it simple by coating in flour seasoned with salt & pepper, deep frying, and serve with A roasted Garlic Aioli (mayo) sauce. Yummy way to get kids and picky eaters to eat their vegetables!

Loved them! I love zucchini and I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of regular. You get a lot of flavor this way. Thanks for the recipe.

very time consuming and the batter didn't stick too well.  I didn't mind the taste but needed to add much more parm cheese for otherwise bland flavour

I had to slice these into rounds instead of sticks because I had round zucchini.  Like others had said, coat the zucchini in flour and then into the egg mixture - if the egg mixture still doesn't coat the zucchini then dip into the flour again and back into the egg and then the crumbs.  A sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and a bit of kosher salt while they are still hot adds a nice finishing touch.

They were a lot of work for something without a lot of flavour.  My husband said to me, don't bother making again.  He eats anything!

Really good, my 3 & 5 year old sons even ate them. Wonderful in the Ranch dressing. It does however need a little more seasoning added, but great just as is. Getting my boys to eat them was excellent.

They were good. I like the ones I get in the restaurants better. They were a little on the bland side. Maybe would be good with more spices.
