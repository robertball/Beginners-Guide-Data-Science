Instead of the flour I used 3T of cornstarch as someone suggested. Did mine on stove top worked out wonderfully.  I did use 2t of vanilla and next time may reduce sugar by 1/4 cup as it is super sweet but really good!

I made mine on the stovetop.  Bring milk and sugar just to a boil, then temper that into your eggs/salt/3T cornstarch mixture.  Return to stovetop, bring to boil and then cook for two mins.  Remove from heat and add vanilla.  Perfect!

I still can't believe that this recipe is so good yet easy to make.  I made cream puffs and tried this filling recipe.  Everyone loved them and said they were the best cream puffs they ever had.

This custard sat up beautifully and tastes great! Simple to make and it's a keeper!  I did use 3T cornstarch instead of flour.

I love how quick this is. I had a fairly small cake however, and this was a ton of custard!! You end up with about 2 and a half cups of custard. I'd recommend halving the proportions for a more moderate amount.

It was very easy to make & definitely beat stovetop method. I filled chocolate/strawberry cupcakes.

It is very easy to make and tastes great but can be a bit messy in the microwave if you're not watching closely

I've made this custard twice, once for cupcake filling, and once for cake filling, and it turned out beautifully both times. I increased the vanilla the 2nd time, to 1 1/2 tsp, and liked it even more. It was a hit with everyone who tasted it both times.

Quickest easiest best tasting custard I have ever made! I substituted cornstarch for flour though I always find it has a nicer taste that way.

Very easy. Used cornstarch substitute and it worked quite well. Used for popover topping. Used 1t of almond AND 1t of vanilla extract. Tasty! Also separated some and added some heated strawberry jelly - strawberry custard! Nice brunch variety.

My 12 y/o tried to make it and it completely did not turn out. It was a watery mess with lumps at the bottom. I tried again and was not having success. I microwaved much longer than the recipe called for and it did finally thinken, but it was not smooth. I think that if you have to edit the recipe to make it work, it's not a 5 star recipe. Obviously stove top would have been better; it always is. And I would suggest following the cornstarch directions on other reviews. That probably would have made a positive difference. It worked out. It tasted good. I'm not sure I strongly recommend the recipe though, definitely not as written. Photo is of Extreme Chocolate Cake  with this as the custard filling, and Kit Kats, per the birthday boy's request.

I swapped out the flour for cornstarch and the milk for almond milk. Didnâ€™t have to microwave nearly as long as the instructions said. 2 minutes for the milk only, and 1 minute after I added the cornstarch, sugar, & salt.

I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated after it was all put together. It was in the freezer for about 20 minutes and came out like a stiff jello. I had to add whipped cream to get it to the right consistency for a cake filling. It is good as is, but I would add another yoke or 2 for better taste and consistency.
