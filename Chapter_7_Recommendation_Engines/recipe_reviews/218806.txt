This was really good! I have tried quite a few of these chocolate banana drinks and haven't tasted one I really liked. This tasted like a chocolate malt with just a lite banana taste. I made 1/2 recipe and got 2 average sized drinks. I used vanilla bean gelato and topped with a little whipped cream and chocolate crunch topping. Yum!

I used skim milk, and it didn't detract from the lusciousness of this milkshake.  Also, I know other reviewers were concerned about a whole banana overpowering the chocolate flavor...trust me, it didn't. I live in Florida, so it's legitimate to make milkshakes year round, not just during summer, and this was a real treat today.      :-)

wow this was so simple and very easy to make. In place of powdered drink mix, I used a chocolate hazelnut spread and it turned out really yummy. You won't be able to put this drink down!

Awesome! I substituted chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla for an extra chocolate boost, and it was delicious!

This milkshake has a great balance of milk to ice cream and I like the half of a banana so it doesn't become too overpowering. I used Carnation regular malted milk powder instead of Ovaltine, but I added 1 Tablespoon Dutch Pressed Cocoa Powder. I topped mine with homemade whipped cream.

I used homemade greek frozen yogurt in this recipe instead of vanilla ice cream. I also cut back on the milk a bit. Surprizingly good!

I made this recipe in the middle of winter because I wanted something cold to drink. It was the best milkshake recipe by far! Because I didn't like the idea of chocolate and banana, I eliminated the chocolate, and it was spectacular by itself. I also added 6 ice cubes to make it colder and thicker. Everyone in my family loved it and wanted seconds :)

Great fun to make and drink! For an added taste punch, try putting sliced strawberries on top with whipped cream and chocolate chips.

It is just right... great recipe especially as a base to make it your own. I added grated cocoa, caramel sauce and some whip cream with chocolate sprinkles on top and banana to garnish and voila... the perfect milkshake was made! My hubby went crazy for it. Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have time to freeze the banana but it was excellent.  I used a stick blender instead of dragging out the 50 year old Oster blender my mom gave me.  Used Ovaltine for the powdered drink mix.

I was great! It says it will be ready in 35 minutes, it is actually much faster.
