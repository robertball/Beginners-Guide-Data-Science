This is a DELICIOUS basic recipe. I have been doing a similar one for years. I also, prefer adding a few more spices TO THE BREAD CRUMBS,like basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, fresh cracked pepper and onion powder, and a few TBSP of the parmensan cheese;not only ON IT later. For some reason these spices (added separately) are good, but we don't like with an pre-mix of "Italian"spice. It seems to taste a little "soapy". Not sure which spice does that to it.? Some suggested to "double dip" in bread crumbs;if you do, you should really LIKE a heavy battering. It was too thick for our tastes(esp. since you bake in the sauce; to me,the bottom gets  a little mushy, and it just adds extra fat and calories). I also use a cookie cooling "RACK" SET ON TOP of a baking sheet, to bake the chicken on instead of just on the cookie sheet pan. It comes out much crisper; letting air get to the BOTTOM of the chicken,also.  Also,I wait to spoon the SECOND 1/2 of the sauce UNTIL SERVING, the chicken will stay crisper,(even with the cheese on top). Obviously, we like the chicken on the crisp side (but we don't want to deep fry).
For company, put the chicken (with just the cheese baked on top) ON TOP of a small mound of spaghetti and sauce,or any pasta; It makes for a delicious looking presentation. A side salad with some sort of CREAMY dressing seems to compliment the red sauce, and completes the meal wonderfully. We get cravings for this one about 2c a month!

This was an extremely easy, very tasty recipe.  As many others suggested, I only put sauce on the bottom of the chicken and then spooned a little over the top when serving.  I think the recipe could be improved, though, by (1) pounding the chicken to a uniform thickness and (2) by spicing up the bread crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs but next time will sprinkle pepper on the chicken before dredging through the crumbs, and I also plan to add more Italian seasoning and maybe a little parmesan to the crumbs.  Both these steps, in my opinion, would take this from a really good recipe to an excellent dish!

I BRINED my chicken in 4 cups water , 1/2 cup kosher salt (1/4 table salt) ½ cup sugar for 30 minutes. No need to brine if you are using quick frozen chicken that has been enhanced. Kosher chicken is prebrined. Brining=juicy chicken. Took brined chicken, cut off thin edges, pounded out & shook chicken w/flour (preflouring allows bread crumbs to stick) in a Ziploc-letting floured chicken sit for 5 min. I heated 6 TBS vegetable oil till it shimmered & then added 2 TBS butter to my pan, reserving half of this mixture for my second batch. Bread crumb mixture: I use ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs(same as 2 ounces), ½ cup grated parmesan( double what recipe calls for), 1tsp. Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb, ½ tsp. garlic powder, ½ tsp, onion powder, ½ tsp. Italian seasoning & a pinch of pepper. Took pre-floured chicken, coated it with egg mixture, then dipped in bread crumbs & FRIED the chicken to a medium golden brown. Shook some parmesan on them right away when done frying to absorb any oil. Side-by side I plated plain spaghetti noodles & cutlets, w/2 TBSP sauce on cutlet & desired amount of sauce on pasta, covered in cheese & baked each individual plate till cheese melted, serving them straight out of the oven. 
The reviews on this were probably the best I have ever gotten, I used to work in an Italian Restaurant owned by NY Italians &  have picked up some techniques. My Fettuccine Alfredo used to be my husband favorite dish, after last night he told me he has a new favorite.

This chicken was so easy to make and turned out excellent! Used Best Marinara Sauce Yet (found here as well)instead of regular spaghetti sauce. This added even more flavor.

I REALLY liked this recipe.  I made my own spaghetti sauce and used parmesan reggiano.  I also skipped dipping the breasts in egg as I thought it was unnecessary and it was.  Cooking temp. and time are accurate.  Even my fussy fiance liked this.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! This was really tasty and simple. Something quick to make when you can't spend too much time figuring out what's for dinner.  Also great on a toasted roll/hero as a sandwich.  I varied the recipe a little by adding some parmesan cheese (big cheese lover that I am!), garlic powder, onion powder and some salt into the bread crumbs and then mixing it up before breading the chicken with it.  Also added a little salt to the beaten egg to make sure the chicken wouldn't end up bland, but that's just my preference.  In response to the one reviewer who wanted thicker breading, what I did was double dip the chicken - coat first with the bread crumbs, then dip into the beaten egg and re-coat with breadcrumbs before actually baking (this would require some more breadcrumbs and probably another egg).  Excellent recipe! =]

Wonderful chicken recipe! I have made this several times. One night we were craving it and I didn't have any bottled spaghetti sauce. I poured  a 14 ounce can of tomato sauce in a microwave bowl, added 2t Italian Seasoning and 1t of garlic powder,  cooked on high for 6 minutes, and ended up with a rich thick sauce for the chicken.

This is gonna be one of those it’s a good recipe when you completely change it reviews. I did originally follow the recipe and the chicken tasted like it had been in breaded in cardboard. It just was not appetizing. However there is a great breaded chicken recipe on this site, garlic chicken. Made this simple and easy and oh so TASTY. I got great reviews. Here is what I did. Took ¼ cup olive oil with 3 cloves garlic crushed and heated in microwave for 30 sec. Then coated the chicken in the oil and dipped in a mixture of ½ Italian seasoned bread crumbs and ½ parmesan cheese (double coat if u like thick breading). Cooked in oven at 325 for 20min (on a foil covered cookie sheet to make clean up easy). Set them in a casserole dish on top of about ½ a jar of spaghetti sauce for 3 chicken breast. Covered the breast with slices of mozzarella cheese and baked for another 20-25 minutes. Top with parmesan cheese. This turned out really really yummy and smells sooo good while it’s cooking.

I'm all thumbs in the kitchen, but I managed this recipe quite easily.  My boyfriend, who was a bit skeptical at first, ended up LOVING it... lots of "mmm" noises throughout dinner.  Thanks!

Check out "Tomato Chicken Parmesan" on this site for a truly fabulous chicken parm recipe.  Every time I make that one, people say its the best chicken parm they every had.  No matter what kind you make though, always pound your chicken breasts, it will help immensely keeping the chicken tender and moist.

My fiance said "yum, yum yum" the whole time we were eating! And he said it's better than the kind he loves at a restaurant we go to. 

I double dipped the chicken in the breading (which I had also added parmesan to), then I browned the chicken in a skillet with olive oil and fresh garlic, then baked the chicken in the oven with sliced mozz and parm. Didn't add the sauce until I served it - I heated the sauce in a pan and then just put it as the base on the plate. 

I'll definitely be making this one again and again!

Very good!  I added some parmesan cheese to the breading mixture and baked the chicken on a cooling rack so it would get crispy on the bottom too.  Turned out great!  Son loved it!

I never knew that chicken parm was so easy! I made this last night for the first time, I had always wanted to make chicken parm like I got in the restaurants, but I was sure it would never turn out. This recipe is so easy it stunned me. But after making it I came to a conclusion: it's better than what I have ever eaten in a restaurant. I added spices to the bread crumbs, and I also heated the sauce and added garlic, oregano and a little cayenne pepper for a kick. Flattening the chicken breasts does add to the aesthetic value, but I don't think it's necessary. Thank you so much for the great recipe Candy!

Super yummy! Made once and husband kept complimenting how good it was the entire meal. Said he could eat this every week!! Made exactly as recipe specified, except made 3 chicken breasts and used whole can of sauce. Eye balled other ingredients. Had angel hair pasta on the side. I already know that this is going to be a new family favorite.

This was really good and really easy.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, and I added some mushrooms sauteed in olive oil and Italian spices to the top of the chicken breasts before the final bake. It tasted great...not to mention it looked like it came from a restaurant!  We will make this regularly.

This was AMAZING!  I did one thing to simplify the cooking process (I wont call it changing the recipe though!!)  I breaded & baked the chicken last night. Tonight, I threw the chicken in the microwave for a few minutes -just enough to take the chill off- while I doctored up the sauce in my 9x13 pan.  Baked as directed in the 2nd step while the pasta cooked. This is my new "Where have you been all my life??" recipe!

This was really good. Another one that my boyfriend devoured, I mean licking his plate at the end and can't wait for the leftovers, I doubled the recipe. I also added a little salt to the beaten eggs and used seasoned breadcrumbs and then added some onion powder, garlic powder/salt and parmesan cheese. I would probably use less salt and seasoning though, it tasted a little too salty to me (my fault). I followed the advice to make it a little crispier to put a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet so its crispy on both sides. I used a vodka marinara sauce which was great! I put half of it in the baking dish, then added the chicken and put back in the oven for 10 minutes. Then added the remaining sauce and topped it with a lot of cheese! It was really good! I served it with a green salad.

I tried making this again and it came out better the 2nd time! I used a little less salt, onion powder and garlic powder and did not put parmesan in the breadcrumb mixture. Definitely made a big difference! And this time I followed the recipe as is and put half the sauce in the baking dish, then the chicken, and then remaining sauce and cheese and baked for 20 minutes... It was delicious!!!

I had some fresh mozzarella at the brink of going bad, so I made this dish to top my spaghetti. It was pretty delicious except for a few things that could've been slightly improved. My chicken was a little bit drier than I expected after I took it out of the oven for the second time, so I think I will probably either reduce the cooking time before or after I apply the sauce. The chicken also tastes a little plain with all that cheese. I even customized my spaghetti sauce a little bit by stirring in some extra tomato sauce and fresh tomatoes.  I think next time I will sprinkle some salt and pepper to season and see if I get the favor I have in mind. Other than that, it was a really good recipe!

Excellent!  Loved this recipe.  I pounded my chicken for aesthtic value and as another poster mentioned below - I double dipped my chicken for a thicker breading which required an extra egg and a little more bread crumbs.  This was even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Candy.

First, let me say that I rarely rate anything a 5 star as that is "Thank God for this!".  That said, this is a pretty good recipe.  We doubled the cheese and used freshly ground/shredded cheese and finely crushed bread crumbs.

We also cut the cooking times to 20 min & 20 min based on our oven.  The first time I cooked it the original cooking times made it very dry.

Thanks and it'll be a part of our rotation.

Absolutely fabulous! I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/4 inch thickness so it cooked evenly.

We liked it. Chicken was very tender but crispy. I will add seasoning to the bread crumbs next time just did salt & pepper.

One of the best chicken parmas I've had. Tried and tested on many a "pub food" expert. Very easy too. I normally add more cheese and sauce than the recipe calls for. Crumbs stay relatively crunchy despite the fact they cook in the sauce.

I like the fact that the chicken in this recipe is baked. I was looking for something a bit lighter than my own recipe, and this is perfect. I always use 4 breasts and a full jar of Prego sauce. Also- my secret is to add a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the sauce- makes it very rich and flavorful. The pan gets scraped clean every time.

I used italian style bread crumbs and I was glad I did.  The chicken really needed the extra flavor.  I also baked the chicken on a cookie cooling rack so the bottom got nice and crispy.  I wish I would have pounded the chicken breasts to a nice thin size but I will next time.  Overall, very good.

I made this a little differently. I used panko breadcrums(it turns out crispier) I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder to the egg mixture. I added mushrooms to the spaghetti sauce. I also added garlic powder, basil, oregano, onion powder to the bread crumb mix. Turned out fabulous!!

I had no idea Chicken Parm could be this easy! This is a very delicious recipe. (I did eyeball the amounts instead of measure, as it seemed to call for too much.) My husband only had one complaint: that there wasn't enough for him to have seconds! I'll be making this again! Thank you!

I made them the same thickness, baked them for only 25 minutes and then pan fried them a little to make them nice and crunchy. Because I made them thin when I pounded them, they cooked fast. The second time I only needed to bake them for 10 minutes (until the cheese was bubbly). Thank you!

Wow! I am a VERY beginner cooker (like just cooked chicken for the first time a few months ago) and this recipe was so easy to do! My husband was very nervous when he found out that I was trying something new, but he ended up loving it! The only thing I would recommend is greasing the baking sheet a little more as my chicken burnt on the bottom so when I took it off of the baking sheet to put it in the baking dish, the bread crumbs and the bottom of the chicken stayed on the sheet.  I added spaghetti and french style green beans and a biscuit to make it a meal. Definitely Recommend this recipe!

Extremely good. The only thing I did different was that I did not put sauce in the pan because I thought that would be too much so I took the chicken out and topped it with sauce and cheese then put it back in the oven just until the cheese was melted and golden brown. I will definately make this again.

This dish was so good!  I did add basil, onion powder, garlic powder, a pinch of red pepper flakes, a little pepper, oregano (I think that's about all) to the bread crumbs and my whole family just RAVED over it!  I served it on top of spaghetti.  Definately a hit!

one of the best pasta dishes i've come across!! i used whole pieces of provlone cheese and dry Parmesan cheese and it turned out perfect.  i also seasoned my bread crumbs with garlic powder, garlic salt, pepper, and parsley flakes.  while the chicken is in the oven try making buttered garlic noodles as someone else mentioned.  it's really easy to make and it gives this dish a little extra kick.

Great family recipe, even my pickiest child wants this again! I double dipped the egg and bread crumb mixture. I used Italian bread crumbs and I added extra spices (garlic, basil and pepper). I did not put the sauce in the bottom of the baking dish but instead heated it up on the stove and then placed it as a base on the dinner plate. I used shredded mozz. cheese but wish I had used slices for a prettier presentation. Served this with garlic breadsticks and salad. A great aside: the house smelled wonderful! Enjoy!

I added Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the bread crumbs, used more sauce, and sprinkled it with some parsley for color.  This was absolutely WONDERFUL: so moist and it smelled delicious cooking.  Thanks, Candy!

This is the best tasting and easiest recipe.  I made a couple of changes to try and duplicate our favorite dish at an Italian restaurant.  I mixed half Italian flavored bread crumbs with half plain and when fixing to serve it on the plate, I put spaghetti sauce over the spaghetti and then added a few tablespoons of Alfredo Sauce over that.  Then I placed the chicken on top and my husband said it was the best recipe I have served him of Chicken Parmigiana.  Thanks, Candy

I've learned that with Chicken Parm, if you don't pound out the chicken as thin as you get it in resturants, it doesn't dry out!  Very easy recipe to follow.  Takes time to cook..but little prep time.

This recipe was very easy and good! You really only need to cook the chicken for 20 minutes before adding the sauce and cheese if you're using boneless skinless chicken breasts, otherwise the meat would be a little tough.  I simply reduced the time and it came out great!  I think next time I will pound the chicken flatter just for aesthetics, but it's not necessary.  Thanks for sharing!  -Allison

Excellent.  I never made chicken parm before, since I previously lived in the NYC area where delicious Italian food was available by delivery any time day or night. Now I live in Asia and have to make many dishes myself to get an authentic taste of home.  This was just as good as Italian food from a delivery place in NYC, if not better.  It was very easy.  I did make some small modifications to the recipe-(1) I dredged the chicken in flour first before dipping in egg. (2) I did not have breadcrumbs, so I made some by smashing some store-bought garlic/Italian flavored croutons in a bag (they didn't come out food-processor small, but some crumbs were fine and some were pretty giant, almost mini croutons). (3) Instead of adding parm at the end with the mozzarella, I added it to the bread crumbs (smashed croutons).  (4) my two chicken breast halves were actually each pretty enormous, so I cut each one into 3 cutlets, for a total of 6 cutlets.  (5) I used the whole jar of sauce.  I have no idea if I used the right amount of mozzarella but just covered each cutlet with it and it worked out fine. Note, 2 oz breadcrumbs is about 1 cup. Serve with a side of pasta with a little of the sauce spooned on top of the pasta and a dash of grated parmesan, along with a side of veg or salad, and garlic bread. Made about 3 reasonably sized or 2 large servings, probably since I had such big chicken pieces to begin with. Baked it exactly as directed for the exact time directed. Will make it often!

this is a great basic recipe with a technique anyone can follow for foolproof chicken parm you can customize to your own tastes.  in our family we season the breadcrumb mixture and add shredded parm to the breading.  i also use a mixture of provolone, mozzarella, and asiago cheese for the topping.  the good thing is this is so basic it's good on it's own, but you have the ability to easily change to suit your tastes.  use alredo instead of red sauce, add italian seasoning or use flavored breadcrumbs, switch up the cheeses, etc.  we enjoy many variations of this on a pretty regularbasis around here! thanks!!

Wow! This chicken was moist and tasty! I first coated the chicken in flour that was seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder, then the egg, followed by regular bread crumbs seasoned with italian seasoning and parsley. When it came down to the last part, I eyed the amount of sauce I added and seasoned the cheese with a little basil, oregano, and pepper. I served the meal with sides of corn and brocolli and a glass of wine. My boyfriend loved it and it made for a wonderful night in. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow, so many 5 star reviews! I like this recipe, but the crumbing takes so much time when cooking for 7. So I make a lower fat version my family loves... so, its not the same as the traditional method, but its always a hit! No crumbs, just chicken baked in spaghetti sauce, topped with lots of stringy mozzarella, and there's never leftovers. Yum yum!

LOVE this recipe.   I pound the chicken with a tenderizer to make it flatter, my family prefers it that way.   I also add spices to the bread crumbs (some parmesean cheese, garlic powder, italian seasoning) and don't dip in egg prior to dipping in the bread crumbs...I just make sure the chicken is moist by dipping it in water first.     My oldest loves this so much he requested it for his bday dinner!   Very good.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband was really impressed, which is always a good thing!  The only thing I did differently was that I added onion powder, garlic powder and pepper into my Panko bread crumbs to give the coating a little more flavor.  I served this over some angel hair pasta with a side of broccoli.  Also I did bake the chicken on a wire rack instead of on a pan so that both sides would get crispy.

Delicious. I fried the chicken first in a little bit of olive oil to crisp and brown the bread crumbs. Then I placed the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, put the chicken in, and topped with sauce and cheese. Baked for 40 minutes @ 350 deg. I have also made this with turkey cutlets and people actually like it more than chicken. Thanks.

Excellent recipe!  I studied past reviews prior to making the dish so that I wouldn't make any errors.  I combined this recipe with another I found on the Kraft website:

Pounded chicken breasts thinner and dipped in melted butter. Then dredged in Panko seasoned breadcrumbs and placed on a wire rack in a pan.
I baked the chicken for about 20 minutes at 375F. Then I placed the breasts in another dish and topped with some spaghetti sauce and shredded mozarella cheese.  I put it back under the broiler until the cheese was melted.
Served over angel hair pasta.  
Everyone loved it.  Made it for my husband's birthday so I wanted it to be just right and it was!  My 13 year old son ate two servings, so I know it passed the taste test! Thanks to everyone for all their very helpful suggestions.

Chicken Parm is my absolute favorite and the best place to get it in Dover, Delaware is Roma's restaurant by the air force base. I like this recipe because it is very basic and easy although i do prefer a better sauce than the ones in a jar that i have had. The only thing different i did was to add some Parmasan cheese and garlic salt to the breadcrumbs. Very Good! Very easy! Thank you!

This is one of my favorite meals but I prefer it when the breasts are pounded really thin. And it takes much less time to cook this way which is a definite plus. I also prefer to brown the chicken in a frying pan, and then cook it in the oven with the sauce and cheese for 20 min. I serve it with plain white rice.

Hi I made this today, I think as written I would give it a 2 because it would have been pretty bland. I made it as follows:::: in the bread crumbs I addded oregano,basil,garlic powder,salt,pepper and some crushed red pepper and grated parm cheese and fryed in some olive oil. Then put on pasta and covered with sauce and cheese and heated untill cheese melted.

Excellent recipe. Really simple and delicioius. I used regular breadcrumbs and added italian seasons to it. After the chicken baked the first time, I layered the casserole dish as followed: already cooked spaghetti to the bottom of the casserole dish, most of the tomato sauce, the already baked chicken, more sauce, and then cheese. You may have to use about 1-1.5 jars of tomato sauce, but it is worth it! What could be better that chicken parm with baked speghetti! A definite keeper!

so bland - needed garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, and basil in the bread crumb mixture for a better taste. (or Italian seasoned bread crumbs.)

This recipe was easy and tasty! We made our own bread crumbs by slightly toasting and then crumbling using Magic Bullet (or you could use a food processor). We served it with steamed snow peas and spaghetti.

My 10 year old actually complimented this chicken - a miracle!!  I sliced the chicken in to thin halves and browned them in olive oil before placing in baking dish with sauce and covering with the cheese (baked them until cheese was melted and sauce bubbly).  I also lightly salted the chicken and added garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  Wonderful!  Thanks for this one.

Excellent.  I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, double-dipped each piece (egg then crumbs then egg then crumbs again), and used Classico Spicy Red Pepper spaghetti sauce.  Served over angel hair pasta.  I did use quite a bit more crumbs (because I double-dipped) and more sauce than the recipe called for.  Next time I might serve it on a toasted deli bun for a chicken parm. sandwich!  Excellent recipe!

Wonderful!  I made my own breadcrumbs since I was out (bread slices processed and seasoned with various seasonings).  I was short on time, so I browned the pieces (after breading them) in olive oil in a skillet.  I was short on spaghetti sauce, I didn't want to "waste" any, so I just baked the chicken after searing them in the oven topped with mozzarella for no more than 30 mins, served this over linguine noodles and spaghetti sauce and it was a hit!

This was a terrific, very easy recipe that everyone in the family enjoyed. I had no idea Chicken Parmigiana was so easy and so had never attempted it before but this was *so simple*! My husband is extremely picky and he ate this right up, and my 3 year old loved it as well. Great recipe; I didn't change a thing!

I'm used to more complex recipes than this.  I thought "It can't possibly be this easy."  It turned out wonderfully.  Halfway through the baking, I flipped the ckicken, to golden the other side.  Love it, love it, love it!

Terrific recipe. It was very simple and I had all the ingredients at home already, no need to go shopping. I made this for 5 people and there was no need to measure. You can't go wrong with this and the taste of the chicken was incredible. Moist and delicious. Perfect recipe for a big dinner or a small dinner for two. Add some pasta, a nice salad, and some garlic bread and you've got the perfect dinner. My husband couldn't stop raving over it, and has already asked when I will make it again. This will be an made often in my home. Thanks

I'm revising my review of this recipe.  It still gets my five stars, but I agree that the breaded coating gets soggy in all that sauce.  The only thing I do differently now is, following Dyann's (10/03)suggestions, I season the bread crumbs more and bake the chicken on a cookie-cooling rack rather than in the sauce.  Also, I add the cheese in the last few minutes.  I like the crispy-coated chicken topped with a great sauce t serving time.  This is everyone's favorite.  Thanks!

Loved it. As others suggested, I added some spices to the bread crumbs and didn't put the tomato sauce on top during the second bake. Served with some brussel sprouts and garlic bread, and the family really enjoyed it!

Very good recipe, although I made a few changes. I bought boneless chicken breasts. I cleaned the fat, etc. I butterflied the breasts in half. Then i pounded them between a sheet of plastic until they are about 1/3" thick. Then salt, pepper. Dip in egg, then Panko bread crumbs. Bake 30 mins, turn over, bake another 10 (I think this is about 10 mins too long) Once they were slightly brown, I followed the directions of sauce, cheese, then bake. It was one of the best chick parm i have ever had. Raves from my dinner guests. 
I meant to take a pic but no one could wait to eat after smelling my dinner. 
I served with a side of  zuchinni sauteed in onion and garlic, and garlic bread.

This is my second attempt at Chicken parmigiana and this by far was way better and healthier than the other one I had tried. The flavor of this dish is deep and delicious my husband and I were still talking about it the next day. 
I did made a few changes. I added some parm and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and I baked the chicken on a cooling rack so it got crispy all the way around. OH, and I did season the chicken with S&P
I served this along side some fresh pasta. This dish was so good and I will be making it again next week! So simple I kept saying I must be missing something.....

This wasn't a hit at my house..but I think if I had thinner chicken breast and used a better sauce, then it would have been better.

Worked out well, chicken was done, tender and not dry.  Put it on a bed of Linguini - nice.

Delicious!!! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and Cajun seasoning before breading it! I'm adding this to my recipe book!

What a delicious and simple dish!! definitely a KEEPER!!

I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, except for the following:

-placed the breasts in a Ziploc and flattened them to a 1/4 inch thick by pounding with a can of beans (couldn't find our meat mallet, so I had to improvise)

-added approximately a tablespoon of garlic powder and italian seasoning each to the plain bread crumbs

-didn't have mozzarella on hand, so I substituted with pepperjack (which came out delicious, btw)

I used a Bertolli tomato and basil sauce and served it with a side of caesar salad.  Both my husband and I couldn't get enough and will definitely make this again!

Great basic recipe. I followed the suggestions of others and added additional ingredients to my bread crumbs for flavor. I also pounded the chicken breast and seasoned them and placed them in a zip bag with a little milk to ensure they didn't dry out. Finally I cut about 10 min off initial bake time.  Turned out great and BF said he thoroughly enjoyed.

After seeing Rachel Ray make a similar dish I needed a place to start. I didn't have egg but the chicken was so moist after I pounded it we didn't miss that layer at all. I also discoverd too late we only had sun dried tomato mozzerella. Since I pounded my breasts thin, I just fried my chicken in a bit of oil, topped with the sauce and cheese, then covered. It was fast, easy and super yummy in only about 15 minutes. Philly pesto pasta also from this site was the perfect compliment with some fresh string beans and french bread. So good.

This was a fantastic dish that even had my full blooded Italian friends asking me for the recipe! The key is really in the sauce, so go ahead and splurge on the expensive imported sauce from Italy if you can't make your own! Amazing, thank you for the easy and delicious recipe, I will definitely be using again!

Overall - a good recipe! The spaghetti sauce you choose for this dish makes or breaks the flavor. I chose Emeril's Home Style Marinara - big mistake; too sweet. I'll choose something different next time. I also used Italian-style Panko breadcrumbs, and the coating on my chicken was so wonderfully crispy! I will definitely use Panko again.

Easy, delicious and a great variation if you want to avoid frying the chicken in oil as you would in the more traditional method.  Like others have mentioned, I add about 1/4 parmesan to the bread crumb coating along with additional herbs - usually oregano, basil and thyme.  I also add  a little water to the egg to stretch it a little further, and if I have homemade sauce on hand I'll use that.  Great weeknight meal, as it really doesn't take that much time or effort to prepare, but it's hearty and satisfying.

Delicious!! Really a perfect recipe, and much healthier than frying the chicken. I did season the breadcrumbs with garlic powder, dried basil, and onion powder. I HATE using the italian-flavored breadcrumbs, but regular breadcrumbs seasoned like this are great. I will make this often, its a great EASY recipe!

It was really good! I added adobo (blend of dry spices, kind of seasoned salt) to the beaten eggs; also added basil to the spaghetti sauce and used a prepared mix of cheddar, parmesan and mozarella cheese.

Wonderful recipe!! I made this with spaghetti noodles and it was great.  I highly reccomend it but if you are making it with spaghetti noodles I would suggest MORE sauce.  I used one large glass bottle of Ragu ( i think its called) and I needed two.

Delicious and simple chicken parm recipe! I made this for my fiance last night because we hadn't planned in advance but had all the ingredients for this already. It was kind of a throwback to NYC where we spent many years and chicken parm is a staple. It took a bit of time to make, but we followed "somethingdifferentagain?!'s" modifications and it came out delicious. Parm and italian seasonings in the bread crumbs, baked on rack on cookie sheet to maintain crisp-ness, no sauce on top for second bake. Overall turned out quite well, and I will definitely make it again!

Delicious and simple! Juicy, flavorful chicken in no time. I did a few things to make it healthier and tastier. My sister, boyfriend, and I could not get enough:  1.) Instead of traditional Italian bread crumbs, I used Panko Style Italian Bread Crumbs (by Progresso). They give the chicken a more crispy texture and a GREAT flavor. Plus, they are MUCH healthier than traditional breadcrumbs - just compare the ingredients. Panko has no partially hydrogenated oil (a trans fat that increases your cholesterol), preservatives, or wheat gluten. I pay attention to what I'm feeding my family, and I'm sure you guys do, too :)  2.) As another reviewer stated, pounding the chicken would be a good idea. Then you could even fry the breasts to finish everything more quickly.  3.) To save time I used jarred sauce. Since both that and the bread crumbs have a lot of sodium, I skipped the pasta and served fresh steamed broccoli with a bit of melted mozzarella.   Happy cooking!   PS. If you're trying to get more flax seed (Omega 3's) into your family's diet, toss a few tablespoons of ground flax into the bread crumb mix. It's taste is completely undetectable due to the delicious, light taste and texture of the batter.

This recipe was simple, quick and very full of taste. I would recommend this recipe, absolutely! My advice would be to season the chicken w/ salt, pepper and italian seasonings before dipping in egg and breadcrumbs(extra zest and flavor) The spagetti sauce you use will make the difference, so choose a great one that compliments flavors you love. Parmesean cheese and mozarella are the best cheeses to use...I tried monterey jack because it's what I had on hand(2nd time around used cheeses as recommended) If you like chicken parmigiana, try this quick recipe because you won't regret it

This was so good!  I pounded 3 chicken breasts and then cut them in half, plenty for 3 of us plus leftovers.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added just a bit of garlic powder, salt, pepper and onion powder.  Then baked chicken on a rack.  Had no problem with coating staying on.  However, I did put most of my sauce in the bottom of the baking dish (needed to use a 9x13) and then just spread a generous spoonful of sauce over each piece, then the cheeses, before returning to the oven.  I used the directed cooking times, came out perfectly.  I served it with spaghetti noodles and used a regular size jar of my fave sauce.  Leftovers were just as good.  Thanks for this recipe, we loved it!

Excellent! Tastes like you spent hours on it! Family loved it! I took the advice of some pounded the chicken flat first, then put on a cookie rack over a cookie sheet for crispier chicken. If you pound the chicken it does take time off of the baking. I found 30 min was perfect! Then 5 minutes with the cheese on top! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was one of my favorites so far.  I used Hunt's 4 Cheese sauce and I also dipped the chicken in flour before  the breadcrumbs so they'd stick better.  I didn't put suce underneath because I wanted crispier chicken.  I added the sauce when it was totally done.  I also cooked it for 50 minutes instead of 40.  Those were my only changes, this was absolutely delicious!!

This was fantastic! I herbed the bread crumbs and added about 2 tblspns of garlic powder also because we LOVE our garlic. I cooked them on a airated cookie tray to make them extra crispy and then transfered to a baking dish for saucing etc. I also used chicken thighs (no bone) instead of breast and it was much more tender if you use thighs decrese the first cooking time by 15 mins.

Easy to prepare and quick to make! My very picky husband even liked it! I did use the Italian bread crumbs and added some oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper as others suggested. I added some sauce and topped with mozarella the last 15 miutes it baked as well. Would definitely make again!

This was the first time I made this, and it was good, except it needs oregano! This was the first dish I cooked for my boyfriend, and I was so proud he was enjoying it until he quietly went to the spice cabinet and grabbed the oregano and said "you forgot this." Yikes...so much for my first impression.

This has great potential. Quick and easy, although I feel it lacked Parmesan flavor. Next time, I'll combine parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs, EQUAL AMOUNTS! I just know that will make it absolutely PERFECT!

This is an absolutely phenomenal recipe. The chicken comes out soft, not like a lot of the restaurants where it's firm or tough. I used italian breadcrumbs rather than just the normal ones for an extra kick, and everyone I've made it for LOVES it.

Fantastic!  Used 1lb of Perdue thin sliced chicken breast (no pounding needed!) coated in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. (Helps bread crumbs stick on.)  Eyeballed the bread crumbs (garlic&herb), added some parm cheese, some onion powder and garlic powder.  Used up the last of my three cheese tomato sauce in fridge.  Poured sauce on bottom of pan. Added chicken, approx. 2 Tbs of sauce on top of each piece of chicken, then coated in mozz cheese and sprinkled parm on top.  Perfect!!!  (Cooked 20 mins on baking tray, then 15 mins once covered w/cheese).  Update:  I have found that if I marinate the chicken in Italian salad dressing for a few hours before cooking, I not only get a great infusion of flavor, but then I avoid the egg coating and just coat it right away in bread crumbs and panko.  Panko makes it sooo much crispier!

HOLD EVERYTHING - how can this be so simple and so good.  Use a very good marinara /sauce(I used a three cheese one)make sure you pound those chicken breasts, serve over spaghetti or linguine tossed in olive oil, garlic, and coating of fresly shaved parmesan, and eat the best comfort food ever.  Loved it.

The simplicity in making this recipe deserves a five star rating, the taste does not.  Way too much sauce, this made it soggy.  If you like chicken parmigiana that is swimming or floating in tomato sauce, you may enjoy it.  Won't be making this again - would rather have a recipe that has an evenly balanced flavour.

I tried this made ahead style, breaded and baked the chix breast for 20min. then put them on top of sauce and when I was ready to serve topped with sauce and cheese and baked in oven for 25 min. Came out not as moist as usual and the crust was a little on the soggy side.  Not great as a "make ahead" dish.  Much better if you make it all at once and serve it, as I've done many times!! This is a definate fave!!

This was delicious!  The only thing that I did differently was to first carefully pound the chicken to about 1/8" thick before dipping to give it a crispier texture after frying.  I served it on a bed of spaghetti and topped with finely shredded Parmesan cheese and a side of garlic bread.

I originally rated this recipe with 4 stars.  However, after making this a second time with a few minor changes this is superb.  The big difference is double coating the chicken!  After coating it once, dip it in egg again and recoat with bread crumbs.  This makes a world of difference in the taste!

The only thing that I regret about this recipe is not using my own sauce (but I'm not a big fan of jarred sauce).  I skipped the egg step, and used "homemade shake and bake mixture" from this site (baby has an egg allergy) in it's place.  Great EASY recipe!  Thanks Candy!!

I liked this recipe pretty much.  It really matters what jar speghetti sauce you use.  My favorite is the one that has merlot in it.  Also, using italian bread crumbs gives it some more pazzaz.  I do this recipe quite often.

EXCELLENT!   I did make a few changes: added garlic owder and used parmesan and garlic flavored bread crumbs.   I didn't know it could be this easy!  I made it an easier way by cooking the chicken, then just adding the sauce to the same pan so as not to dirty two pans.  Cam out great.  I served it with Fett. Alfredo.  Excellent compliment!

I doubled this receipe,used italian bread crumbs,and cut the cooking time of boneless chicken to 20 minutes cooking in electric skillet. Came out great!! For a change of pace,,I served over feticini.Second time I fixed it, I served over angel hair pasta and it was a hit too. Thanks for this delicious recipe that is so easy.

This recipe is wonderful and so easy.  I made it with 4 breasts by just increasing the other ingredients slightly.  Also, I pounded the chicken to tenderize, also added some garlic to the sauce.  This will be a new standard for me!

Very tasty and simple enough for a beginner.

I made this to feed 60 people at youth group and it was a big hit.  I used the pre-breaded frozen chicken from Costco and cooked it completely, then added the sauce and cheese and started with step 3 in the recipe.  It was very well received!

Added oregano and Parmesan to the bread crumbs and used thinly sliced chicken breast. Cut the cook time for the chicken in half.

Personally, you do not need this much spaghetti sauce. Save some of it for the side dish of pasta. You will want to add some seasonings to the bread crumbs: Garlic powder, oregano, pepper, or something because it did not have a lot of classic flavors. You should also add the parmesan to the bread crumbs and then top with some more with the mozzarella.

My husband begged for chicken parmigiana and I'd never made it. This recipe was a perfect jumping off point for a few tweaks of my own.

I read several reviews and decided to brown my chicken after breading and before baking it. I used pankow crumbs jazzed up with some Italian seasoning and pizza rather than spaghetti sauce(I got caught without any). I left the sauce off the bottom of the final baking pan (since some said it made the crumbs soggy) and just spooned some over the top. I sliced my cheeses thinly rather than grated them.

It also just happened that this chicken had been marinating over night to grill it when rain hit, so this recipe was my fallback choice.

Sauteed asparagus and roasted potatoes with white wine got me compliments. 

Whatever it was, it was great. Of course now I'm obligated to make it again.

I ended up making this recipe exactly the way it's listed, however, for us it ended up a bit too bland.  Next time I will add more spices (basil, oregano) and garlic, otherwise the idea is great! Thank you!

Not bad, but I had to add a lot of spice to it for more taste, lots of diced garlic and a few red pepper flakes. I used Emerils jar marinara sauce and doubled the servings. The chicken did come out very moist, I cooked it with a rack on my backing sheet, this way I lost none of the crust to the pan.

The family thought this was very tasty and it was very easy to make.  We did take the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and ground pepper before coating it with Italian seasoned crumbs.  I agree with the review(s) that said the chicken should be pounded to the same thickness and I will do that next time.  However, I think it is only fair to rate the recipe as it is presented to the community.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was super easy to make - I do think it would have been better with a home made sauce  - but overall the chicken was juicy and the flavor good

Tried this yesterday and It turned out really really good! However I read the previous comments and seasoned the bread crumbs and also baked it on a rack instead of in a pan. I think it really helped the dish alot. Also I double coated the bread crumbs. It was one of the best meals so far!

I made it a point not to read the reviews on this one. I made it basically as is and it was THE BOMB!  I only added some salt into the bread crumbs and pounded the chicken about 1/4" thick. Once they were done, I spooned sauce onto the fillets, topped with cheese, and baked for a few minutes more.  Loved it!

This was a simple recipe that made a good meal. My boyfriend really like it and I thought it was ok. I added onion powder, fresh pepper, thyme, dried basil and some italian sesoning to the bread crumbs as well as lots of parmesan. I think next time I will double up on the spices and maybe add some cayenne or pepper flakes. It was good, just a bit too salty and bland for my taste.

This chicken turned out delicious, I added a variety of spices to my bread crumbs to spruce it up- crushed red pepper, garlic & onion powder and salt. I used a jarred four cheese sauce. Because I know my oven I didnt bake it as long as the recipe called, I left it in the first time for about 27 minutes and the second time for 20 minutes. Yum thanks!!

Firstly I made my own sauce from garden canned tomatoes with 3 gloves garlic, fresh minced basil and oregano and half a small sweet onion minced in EV olive oil. Drain juice from canned tomatoes and add to pan, boil 5 minutes then reduce heat to simmer uncovered 1-3 hours, stirring every so often. I doubled recipe to use 4 breasts that I cut into 3 fat strips each. I coat my chicken in flour first then egg then italian seasoned breadcrumbs/parmesan cheese mixture.  Used parmesan slices as what I had on hand. Super tasty recipe. Great potential to play :)

Very good recipe. I have never made chicken parmigiana before, and thought I did very well. My daughter helped to prepare it, and it was delicious. It didn't wow me (that is why only 4 stars) but it was definitely enjoyed by my family.

Great. We moved the oven rack up to the top when it came close to serving so that the cheese could brown a bit. I might use less sauce next time, ala a chicken parm sandwich.

This was so easy and delicious!!  I used Perdue Perfect Portions Chicken Breasts because it was on sale and the chicken breasts were about the same size.  I also added parm cheese to the Italian bread crumbs before dredging.  I did cook the breaded pieces for only 30 minutes as the chicken pieces were not that thick and did not want them to dry out.  I had Prego Marinara sauce so I used that, added my cheeses and cooked it another 15 minutes.  I put the chicken parmigiana over rotini and the entire family loved it!

The house smells divine!  Definitely season the chix breast with s&p, and garlic, and if you have plain bread crumbs like me, and have some italian seasonings on hand, just mix it into the bread crumbs.  I mixed in the parmesan cheese with the crumbs, too.  DeeeeeeeeeeLISH!

This was a great and simple recipe, and I'll be making it regularly from now on.  The prep time and cook time guidelines are a bit misleading though - it should say 10 minutes of prep time and 60 minutes of cook time.  It's very simple to throw everything together and throw it in the oven, giving you time to do something else while it bakes.  My husband said he would prefer a little more sauce, so next time I will use a full jar of pasta sauce.

I made this Saturday night for the family and it was a hit!  I did use a homemade spaghetti sauce that I think had a lot to do with the flavor of the meal.  I must admit though, I work with a girl who I purchased the homemade sauce from her Italian inlaws!

super good, super easy!  I followed the reviews of others and added spices to the breadcrumbs.  I also used frozen chicken breasts so I baked them for extra time in the oven (followed the directions on the bag of chicken for baking times).  This meal is definitely one of our staples now. I will never pay for chicken parm again!

My family devoured this dish! I pounded the chicken and  dipped the breasts into Italian breadcrumbs with some Parmesan cheese added to the breading.  Otherwise, I  followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy to make.  We will make this dish again!

Oh Wow! Is all I can say about this Chicken Parmigiana Recipe. It's absolutely amazin I tried it yesterday and it came out absolutely wonderful. It's simple and straight to the point :-) I also took three tips from another person's review i read before making it(by pounding the chicken, seasoning the bread crumbs wit Italian seasoning and grated parmesan cheese and sprinkling the chicken wit pepper after dippin it in the egg before putting it in the bread crumbs)those theree tips were amazin and it turned out wonderful. I used 3 big chicken breast 2 i had to cut, so i ended up with 5 in the end. After putting the chicken parmigiana over some angel hair pasta it topped off the dish completely. Thanx for this wonderful recipe and those three great tips. I will most definitely make this again and again :-)IT'S AWESOME

This turned out excellent.  My husband and son complimented me on this dish.   I did do a few things differently, though.  I pan fried my chicken because I like the coating to be a little harder than the oven will make it.   I always salt my chicken or pork with sea salt first because mixing it into the breadcrumbs just doesn't cut it for me but I do put garlic powder or salt and pepper in the breadcrumbs.   I did everything else like the receipe stated.   It turned out fantastic!

This recipe is about as easy as it gets and it tastes great. My wife loved it and my kids cleaned their plates. I added some Italian seasoning to my bread crumbs to give it some flavor and after eating it, I think it would have been a little bland without it. I also cut my thicker chicken breasts in half. This cut the cooking time down a bit, but the results were still juicy/moist.

I've got to say, I was so incredibly pleased with the way this turned out! I was worried that the chicken wouldn't bake in the time said and that I'd end up making it dry, or that it wouldn't have the same texture as others I've eaten in restaurants, but it did! And it was so much better than the breading-less crock pot recipe I used once before! I was so excited! It turned out perfectly! I used 2 chicken breasts that I sliced into a total of 4 thinner pieces. The sauce I made using two large cans of chunky tomato sauce mixed in with oregano, bay leaf, white wine, garlic, and basil. I also only had wheat bread crumbs. I think white would taste better, but this worked too!

This was an easy and wonderful recipe. I pounded the chicken breast to make them thinner and then followed the advice of others as far as cooking them on a rack so they wouldn't get mushy. Will definitely make it again.

This was the first time I combined pasta with something other than ground beef or fish. This dish was sensational! 
I too didn't put any of the sauce on top of the chicken and I'm glad I did, the crust of the chicken (enhanced with garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper) was really good! 
Hubby almost ate the bottom out of his plate, definitely a keeper!!

Good not great.  You better add at least a teaspoon of italian seasonings to the bread crumbs. Also add a little cream or half/half to the egg wash. A nice touch. Serve over a bed of spaghetti

This is good and easy. I eyeballed the sauce and cheeses. I also double-dipped the chicken to give it a thicker coating. It was easy and quite good. The chicken was very moist.

Had such a craving for Chicken Parmigiana and I must say this did meet my expectations. I will keep this recipe as it is well worth it. However, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel that it is wise to season the chicken prior to adding to the egg and dry bread crumb mixture. Without doing so, I think it would be too bland.

Pretty good. I suggest pounding your chicken to even thickness...make sure you don't overcook...40 minutes is way too long in my oven. Maybe 20-30.

This was good. Normally, I'm not a fan of Chicken Parmigiana but this recipe really hit the spot. The only thing I altered was using Italian dry bread crumbs because its all that I had. Served with spaghetti and Ina Garten's "Parmesan-Roasted Broccoli."

Great way to use up extra homemade spaghetti sauce!  I took a few reviewers advice and salt and peppered the chicken before dredging and also did not top the chicken with sauce until after it was baked.

Perfect instructions for making chicken parmesen without frying it.  My husband is a chicken parmesan connosuer and LOVED this!  Will definitely make this again!

I thought this turned out good, not fantastic, but good.  I did take advice of others and made the chicken the way I make breaded pork chops.  Flour, Eggs and then breading.  I fry them on top of the stove until they are browned and then bake them in a pan with foil on top.  Everyone always comments on how juicy and tender the meat is.  This was good, I will just have to tweek the sauce and cheese mixture to make it more to my liking.  My husband loved it, the kids were so so.  So that is why the 4 star.  Thanks

I thought that this was a fantastic recipe.. I love chicken paramesan and this was an amazing 'homemade' version. I did adjust the bread crumbs according to other reviewers such as adding basil, thyme, and paramesan cheese to the mixture. I will definitely be making this again especially when I have a taste for an Italian dinner dish! You will not be disappointed by this one, just follow the recipe!

yummy, simple and cheap.  I used split breasts with bones... cut off the crappy parts.  Had everything on hand so it was nice and easy too.  I'll save this one.

The chicken came out chewy. I cannot imagine why. My husband ate it all but as I have TMJ I couldn't eat it. The only thing I can imagine the problem being was that I baked mine on a cooling rack over top of a cookie sheet so as to keep it nice and crispy on the bottom, as another reviewer recommended. It's just very strange, I might try again someday as I really can't see why this didn't work for me.

My sister and I made this for my parents, and they gave rave reviews!  We followed others' suggestions and added seasoning to the bread crumbs and cooked the chicken on a cookie cooling rack in the oven; it turned out perfect and crispy.  We found this recipe to be very easy to put together and will definitely make it again!

Great base recipe! I like to pound the chicken first. Don't skimp on the egg - olive oil and the like just doesn't grab enough of the crumbs.  Crushed crackers are a nice sub for bread crumbs, and add fresh garlic, pepper, and italian seasoning to the mix. to make it extra crispy, bake on a pan that has slits in it, flip the chicken when it's close to being done and turn oven to broil. Add cheese for the last couple minutes til melted. Then, put sauce on the chicken when it's already on the plate, no need to soak it in sauce while cooking - makes it soggy. Enjoy!

this was so delicious. I added italian spices/mrs. dash tomato&basil,garlic salt, parsley,basil to the bread crumbs with parmesean cheese. instead of using motzerella I put slices of provolone cheese on chx for the last 20 min. turned out great! just the smell of the chx cooking with the bread crumbs was awesome!!

I cook this recipe for the first time. My husband said that this recipe is better than the restaurant. We pay $15/per order of chicken parmigiana. I used young chicken breast. Marinated the chicken with egg and italian seasoning for 30 mins. Added some parmesian cheese on the bread crumbs. Used classico marinara sauce. Then follow the rest of the recipe. Coming from an italian family. This is easy and delicious!!!!!

This is a great basic recipe.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs and added extra italian seasonings and garlic to mine and then served it over spaghetti noodles and sauce- delicious!   I baked my chicken on a cooling rack inside of a baking pan, but it still wasn't very crispy.

This recipe is amazing! A few changes:

1. I used chicken tenders and used a mallet to flatter the meat. 

2. I added oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic salt to the bread crumbs.

3. At this point, I pan fried the breaded chicken quickly, just to make it a little more crispy.

4. After quickly frying, I baked for 20 minutes and then 20 mroe with the sauce. I added fresh basil, garlic, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce to make it more flavorful.

5. I did not measure the cheese but instead put enough to cover the top

This is the first recipe I tried from All Recipes.  I've been craving chicken parm for a while so I thought I'd give it try.  The following tips were excellent add to the bread crumbs

"basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, fresh cracked pepper and onion powder, and a few TBSP of the parmensan cheese  . . . .  I also use a cookie cooling "RACK" SET ON TOP of a baking sheet, to bake the chicken on instead of just on the cookie sheet pan. It comes out much crisper; letting air get to the BOTTOM of the chicken,also. Also,I wait to spoon the SECOND 1/2 of the sauce UNTIL SERVING, the chicken will stay crisper,(even with the cheese on top)."

Tastes better than from a restaurant.  My boyfriend loved it too.  This recipe is a keeper.

VERY GOOD!!!  My daughter made this for our dinner tonight and it was very good, she did what some of the other reviews suggested and reserved half of the sauce until serving.  She also added basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder and salt/pepper to the bread crumb mixture.  Will definately make again!!  Thanks for sharing, Candy.

This recipe was really good and really easy to prepare! I only made a couple of small changes:  I pounded the chicken breasts thin and then cooked it for less time (about 20 min)--I like to cut my chicken with a fork!  I also added some parm. cheese to the bread crumb mix and spiced up the chicken a bit.  And I used my homemade spaghetti sauce.  I served with plain thin spaghetti noodles and asiago cheese baguette sliced and toasted.  My husband said he's looking forward to making a chicken parmigiana sandwich for lunch today with the leftovers!

People making this recipe may want to try this recipe with the following modifications: 1.  Instead of using store bought "Italian Style" breadcrumbs, use the Panko breadcrumbs (normally found in the Asian section of your grocery store). then season the breadcrumbs to YOUR liking and preference. Or, grind your own bread in a food processor, then season it. 2. Dredge chicken breasts in flour, prior to the egg/breadcrumb mixture. You can use the whole wheat flour as an alternative. 3. Once chicken is coated with the breadcrumbs, deep fry them in shallow oil, then place in oven topped with cheeses. 4. Most important.. Make your own sauce. It's easy enough to do and will make all the difference in the world.

I thought the recipe was ok. It definitely needs more spices to taste really Italian...or to have any taste at all, really. I'd recommend garlic, oregano, maybe basil.

This was a great recipe. I only gave it 4 stars due to the additional seasonings I had to add to spruce it up. I would suggest decreasing the cooking time just a bit (especially if you flatten your chicken). I followed someone else's sauce recipe and it was wonderful! Definitely a recipe to keep.

I love the simplicity of this recipe! My children, all eight of them, love this recipe! The changes I make are to add seasoning to my bread crumbs, when coating the chicken, and baking the chicken without sauce. I add my own  homemade, organic spaghetti sauce  when serving, along with freshly grated parmesan. This keeps the chicken from becoming soggy. I serve with spelt linguine.

This turned out great! We did however make some small changes.  To the bread we added Italian seasoning, garlic powder and pepper.  When cooking on the baking sheet we sprinkled the chicken with Parmesan. It turned out beautifully! For the spaghetti sauce we used (for a serving of 6) 28oz of tomato sauce, 4 oz tomato paste, 3 cloves of minced garlic sautéed in 2T olive oil, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t sugar, 1/2 t basil, 1/4 t black pepper. After sautéing the garlic we added the rest of the ingredients and let it cook for 1/2 hour. It worked wonderfully with the chicken. We will definitely be making this again.

This was excellent!   I combined several users' suggestions:  added oregano, basil, garlic powder, and butter to the breadcrumb mixture.  I baked the chicken on a cookie cooling rack, and I didn't add any sauce until it was ready to be served.  I used a plain jar of pasta sauce and added oregano, basil, brown sugar, and parmesan cheese to it and just simmered it on the stove.  
Thanks for the recipe and thanks for all the great tweaks and suggestions!  This recipe is going into regular rotation!

Really easy, really good! I marinated my chicken breasts first in Italian dressing, then breaded and baked. I only put the sauce beneath the breasts, not on top - saved extra sauce to add if wanted.

after reading some other reviews i added some extra spices to the Italian breadcrumbs (a few shakes of oregano, basil, garlic powder, pepper, etc). this is my favorite chicken Parmesan recipe! i always serve it over hot, fresh spaghetti with a side of garlic bread.

Great recipe although I confess to adding italian seasonings to my breadcrumbs. Sometimes I cut my chicken into nuggets, bake, then put my cooked spaghetti in a casserole, add sauce then nuggets and sprinkle cheese on top. It's easier for my grandson to eat this way.

I used two chicken breasts and sliced in half (think butterflying) to spearate into 4 thin cutlets.  To the panko (japanese breadcrumbs) I added oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and grated parm cheese. To cook the chicken faster tahn baking in the oven I treated like a breaded cutlet and quickly fried in a small amount of olive oil to brown the outside, but not necessarily cook to completion.  Not as healthy as baking, but faster.  I finished the dish by placing marinara in the bottom of a 9x13 dish, placing the chicken on top of that, spooning a bit more sauce, then baking for 15-20 minutes to finish heating through.  Then I put some slices of skim milk mozz on top of the chicken, and placed under the broiler until the cheese was browned and bubbly.  Yum!

I used homemade bread crumbs (crumbled bread placed in the oven at 250F for 15 minutes), and added less cheese just to make it more healthy, but it was still great.

I made my own breadcrumbs, and my own spaghetti sauce. I also butterflied the turkey breasts (I used instead of chicken) and stuffed them with the cheeses. It was SOO YUMMY.

This recipe was wonderful, my family loved it,I will definately make it again. I followed the recipe almost exactly, I put the sauce on the bottom of the pan only and spooned the rest of it over chicken before serving, other than that I didn't change a thing.  It was great!

We truly enjoyed this delicious and easy recipe. I made my bread crumbs from fresh bread torn apart, used some italian seasoning, too. Then baked crumbs to dry them out. I not only used the chicken breasts, but also some chicken Italian Sausages, which I also coated after the breasts. Served over Cappellini with a side of Italian Green Beans. Will make this one again.

I'm guessing chicken parmigiana is usually fried, but it was still good this way, especially if you're eating healthy. I made extra chicken to serve on toasted bakery buns for chicken parmigiana sandwiches.

VERY VERY GOOD! I played with it just a little to make it more my own. 

I used boneless-skinless chicken thighs because I feel the dark meat is more flavorful.  To the store purchased spaghetti sauce I added: a dash of sugar (to cut the tomato acid), 4 lg. fresh Basil leaves - minced, 1 1/2 cups fresh mushrooms-sliced, 1 lg. clove of garlic -minced, and a splash of Merlot wine. I simmered that on low while the chicken baked. 

I followed the rest of the directions to the letter.  I found it much more convenient to bake the chicken in the oven as opposed to frying on the stove as some Chicken Parmigiana recipes suggest. That 40 min the chicken bakes frees you up to prepare the other parts of the meal, set the table...or just plain RELAX.. :). 

It was super simple. A REAL KEEPER!

Excellent.

I used the plain breadcrumbs and added basil, onion powder, garlic powder, garlic salt, salt, pepper, and italian seasion.  

Cooked chicken for 20 minutes on a cooling rack, then added marinara sauce but only on the bottom.

The last few minutes, added fresh grated motz and also parmesean.

Sat chicken on angel hair pasta.

Next time, I will cook chicken dry and add the sauce at the table.

Love this one.  Very romantic type dish.

This was pretty good.  If you are using spaghetti sauce in a jar, I suggest that you add your own mix of spices.  Otherwise it can get a little bland. The chicken was very moist.

I really enjoyed the flavor.  The chicken was very moist.  I used no sugar added spagetti sauce.  I had left overs the next day and it tasted just as good.  I did add seasoning to the bread crumbs.  My husband doesn't like too much spagetti sauce... therefore, he wasn't too thrilled with the dish since it had a lot of sauce.  I would recommend this recipe.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!!! My wife loved this dish. I also made garlic and butter noodles as a side dish and it complemented the dish well. I used fettuccine, butter, fresh garlic, pepper and parmesan cheese. It was great. Thanks

I really enjoyed this. It was my first time making Chicken Parmigiana and I did change just one thing.. Instead of baking the chicken I didn't have that much time so I fried it in a pan with a little bit of vegetable oil and patted them dry then just layered my lasagna pan with sauce put the chicken in and poured sauce over the chicken sprinkled with the parmesan cheese then the mozzarella. Baked it in the oven on 350 for around a half hour. Turned out great.

This recipe was even better than the Olive Garden's Chicken PArmigiana.  I was skeptical at first, but it turned out wonderful.  I served it on top of angle hair pasta and spaghetti sauce.  The chicken came out juicy and the sauce and cheese was melted and bubbly.  This one is a definite keeper!

REgardless of the 3 stars this is a very very good staple dish; however, I followed the recipe to the "T" with exception of adding Italian Seasoning, but I am asumming these cuts of chicken are to be 8 oz cuts, which I used and the chicken was fairly dry, I would recommend which someone had mentioned earlier in these reviews, and that is to cut your filets in half or into strips  which will I'm sure (and are my plans when I make this dish again) will moisten up your chicken, and YES which was also mentioned earlier was having  a side pan of sauce at the ready, which I feel is imperative.

This was my first time making Chicken Parmigana, and I have to say it turned out awesome.  The taste was wonderful.  I give it a four only becuase i felt it could have used more sauce.  Will definately add more next time.  Two Thumbs Up though.

My husband and I (especially my husband) really enjoy this recipe and we have it at least once every two weeks. The only thing I do differently is slice the chicken into chicken tenders size pieces and use italian style bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese.

This recipe was a good basis to start from.  I mixed the bread crumbs with about 1/4 cup parmesan, some basil, oregano and pepper before coating the chicken. I used homemade sauce (we like a LOT of garlic in my house) and cut the first baking time by about 10 minutes and the chicken was perfectly done.

Loved this recipe! Easy to make, chicken was tender and tasted delicious. Only thing I did different (since it was what I had), I used Italian bread crumbs. Gave it a little more spice to the chicken. Also...remember to turn chicken over half way through first bake or bottom crust will sog up.

Not bad at all for my first time making it. My bread crumbs didn't want to stick very well, but I think thats because I had to defrost the chicken and it was wet from the chicken juices. I think you need to make sure it's godd and dry that way when you dip it in the egg and then into bread crumbs it will stick better.

This is a wonderful recipe and easy to make.  I too followed the advice of the other "posters" and double-dipped the chicken.  I also cut the chicken into strips...it was awesome!  It was nice to have the strips because sometimes you don't always want to gnaw away at a whole breast.  I will make this again!!!!!

This was really liked by all.  I did add Italian bread crumbs instead of plain and double coated the chicken like other people suggested.  I also added two slices of mozzarella cheese per slice of chicken instead of sprinkling shredded on and I strongly suggest a bigger jar of sauce to be added if you like sauce.

Simply delicious!  The only change I would make is use a larger jar of sauce, since we like more sauce.  I took the suggestion of others on this site and double breaded the chicken.  I cut my chicken into strips.  To save time, I prepared mine on top of the stove on simmer.  Yummy!

This recipe was very simple and tasty!  I liked the fact that it was baked first - it wasn't as greasy as it would've been fried.

I thought this recipe was average- just something different to do with chicken- but my fiancee LOVED it! He can't wait until I make it again.

Everyone loved this recipe! I didn't really change anything about the recipe.  I covered the chicken after putting the cheese on so that it would not burn as suggested. I would suggest using more sauce, my boyfriend seemed surprised that there was not alot of sauce. Also make sure that you use a good quality sauce, it really does make a difference.

This is so easy to prepare and it tastes great.  No question that I will be making it again.  Serve it with some spaghetti or other pasta, a salad and some crusty bread and you couldn't ask for a tastier meal.

Dredged in eggbeaters then italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Used Ragu Robusto sauteed garlic & onion sauce. Broiled last couple of minutes to brown the top.  As good as any restaurant and really, really easy.

Very good and easy to make - I used croutons crushed up instead of bed crumbs - it was still good - next time I will spice up the chicken a little - needed a little more umphh.

What a winner!  Thanks Candy.  My whole family loved it!  I used Italian bread crumbs which came in a box - very easy.  I served it over angel hair pasta and we ate every bite!  My 12-year old daughter said, "Mom, you can make this again....soon!"  NurseLA

I marinated the chicken for about an hour in McCormick's Falvor Medleys (Garlic Herb) and it gave it a wonder flavor and kept the chicken moist.  Also, I added the spaghetti sauce at the 1/2-way point and put the cheeses on about 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven.  I'd DEFINATELY make this again. My family LOVED it.

How well you like this recipe will depend heavily on the pasta sauce you use to make it. Of the ones I've tried it with, I like the Classico Sweet Basil Marinara version the best. Use Italian flavored crumbs and plenty of cheese. Cooking time & temp are good.

Use Garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, use a seasoned pasta sauce.  The more cheese the better!

The first time I made this recipe, i found that it calls for a little too much sauce.  But after making some adjustments, sprinkling some bread crumbs, garlic, and parmigiana cheese on the sauce on the bottom of the pan before the chicken and then topping it with the same (along with the mozzarella) it comes out very delicious and elegant looking, too.

My husband and I tried this last night. We both liked it. We followed the recipe closely. I did use a slightly deeper baking dish though. Breading the chicken seemed like a wasted step as it all just got soggy from pouring the sauce over it. But we both plan on having it again.

I love chicken parmigiana and this recipe! For the sauce my grandma always used marinara sauce you get when you order pizza and it tasted just as good if not better!

Good as is. I melted the cheese directly on the chicken while only putting the sauce on the bottom though. Once the cheese was melted I dumped the rest of the sauce on top and continued to cook until the sauced was hot.

Me and my family loves this recipe!!!! It tasted very good. Since my family includes 5 people (including me) we had to double the ingredients. Make sure you always check the servings to know how much the recipe is telling you to make. So I checked out the servings and knew I had to double it. Since last time I made a cookie recipe and all the cookies were smashed together cause I did not check the servings, but although that happened the cookies still tasted delicious. It was that the presentation didn't turn out so well. So I knew this time I would not make that mistake again. I really recommend this recipe though it was OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!! :)

Good.  It totally depends on the sauce you use, but this one is a keeper.  I used flour/egg/seasoned breadcrumbs for the dredge, with shredded parmesan in the breadcrumbs.

Used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts because it was much cheaper, ended up delicious and cooked a little faster than the called for recipe. Overall, I would highly recommend this as I am a terrible cook, but this dish was both simple enough and delicious enough for me to understand.

What can I say? This was the most delicious dish I have ever tried! I was looking all over for the perfect Chicken Parmigiana recipe. Low and behold, this was it! I made this for my mothers birthday dinner and it was and success. My family loved it! And what's not to love? The Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside texture, the warm flavor, the rich aroma. Shall I go on?

For those Italian lovers out there, I do very much recommend this dish. It's one you will regret you hadn't made sooner!

This was good, but the bake time was way to long. I baked the breaded chicken for 15 minutes, poured sauce and sprinkled cheese over top, and put back in the oven for another 15 minutes, then broiled for a couple minutes at the end to get the cheese nice and bubbly brown.

I didn't use an egg, just Italian flavored panko bread crumbs. Used olive oil to coat my cookie sheet. The chicken I used was pounded thin so I had to adjust the baking time. Ten minutes and then flipped them over to the other side for ten minutes. I also only put the Marinara on top of the chicken and then topped it with the Mozzarella. Then a few minutes on the middle rack with the oven on broil to melt the cheese. This recipe turned out very well. I decided to find an oven made recipe because I had quite of few pieces to make in a frying pan which would have taken too long. I will definitely make my version of this again.

This recipe was awesome.  I didn't expect it to be this easy.  I added garlic and onion powder and also browned it before putting it in the oven.

So good! I pounded my chicken breasts  first and I used Pampered Chef garlic and herb seasoning in the bread crumbs and on top before baking. Then before putting breasts on top of sauce, I tossed in my al dente pasta on the bottom. Mmmm

It was pretty easy to prepare, but I didn't think it was that special. I even added herbs to the bread crumb mixture to give it more flavor, but I didn't think it helped it much.  My husband liked the dish, so it may just be different taste buds on this one. :)

I loved this easy recipe....I added garlic powder, oregano, parsley, and parmesan cheese,  and basil to the Italian bread crumbs.  I also used a broiler pan to allow the chicken to get thoroughly crispy.  A new favorite!!!

This was a great way to bake chicken parmigiana and it came out great! I agree with your reviews, that the bread crumbs neeed some spices, and the chicken should be brined, pounded flatter, floured and egg before breadcrumbs. This was a fantastic meal and everyone wanted seconds, so good thing I doubled the recipe!

Great base recipe!!  I used 1/4 c each bread crumbs and panko, added a few shakes of parm, oregano, basil, and garlic, too taste.  After coating and placing on baking sheet, I drizzled with melted butter.  Turned out perfect!

This recipe was amazing. The only changes I made were pounding out the chicken. I used a mix of salt garlic powder and pepper to season the chicken. And I mixed in some milk to the beaten egg. I also topped it with fresh mozzerella. The fam loved it... I'll be making this one again

Very good! Kids loved and was very easy to make. My son is a picky eater and enjoyed this very much.

This was super good my son was amazed! I cut the chicken into small chunks, breaded and baked it without sauce. I made spaghetti noodles and added marinara to it. Then I cut up the baked chicken into bite size pieces and tossed with the pasta and sprinkled with mozzarella and parmesan. I put our plates in the oven and broiled for a few min to melt the cheese. Turned out fabulous!

I've been using this recipe for a while, well since I added it to my recipe box. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed. I sometimes add more/less cheese, depending on who I'm making it for. The family loves it!

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe. Simple and tasty.   I only tweaked it by adding a bit of garlic powder and dried oregano and to the bread crumbs.  
Also while the chicken was cooking, I put butter and minced garlic in the baking dish, and left in the oven until the butter melted and dipped two halves of italian bread in that to make garlic bread, then left the thin coating of butter and garlic in the dish before adding the layer of sauce. Not sure how much that added, but it was delish.

So easy and good!  We think putting about half a cup of parmesan in with the bread crumbs may be good and will try that next time.  We also used one 24ounce jar of spaghetti sauce and it was fine.  Just saucy enough, put over pasta.

Great Recipe.  So simple and delicious.  My picky teenagers love it.  I like cutting my chicken breasts in half length-wise.  The thinner breast meat seems to crisp up a little better.

This was absolutely amazing and easy to make. I added extra cheese on top and left it in a little longer at the end. But didn't change anything. It didn't need it! 
Definitely making this again :-)

Perfect! Wouldn't change a thing! I have a hard time cooking chicken because I'm always afraid it won't get done enough. But I used all the exact times in the recipe and it was cooked perfectly. 

**I did marinade my chicken in italian salad dressing for a few hours before breading--just for a little extra flavor.

Easy for anyone to make and delicious, this recipe is one I'd do again.  Similar to previous commenters, I put all of the sauce under the chicken and spooned over the top when serving.  However, I wish i had set aside some of the sauce to toss with the pasta I served under the chicken.

My suggestions when making this:
> Don't be stingy with the bread crumbs; a heavier coat is better!
> Adding some black pepper to the crumbs would add more kick to the chicken (or using a spicy marinara sauce instead would also add the needed kick).
> This makes great leftovers; double the recipe--the recipe baking dish can easily fit four breasts.

This is a great recipe! I added some herbs and s&p to the bread crumbs (panko). I also pounded the chicken breasts, so they cooked faster than 40 minutes. Other than that, followed the recipe pretty exactly. Didn't double bread, or bake on a rack. It was delicious - great recipe!

So easy to make and everyone from my 5 year old brother to my husband loved it. I didn't have to bake the chicken as long as reccommended. It only took about 35 minutes total.

This is an excellent recipe! I spread a can of flavored diced tomatoes on the bottom of the baking dish, and then added the spaghetti sauce. I placed the sauce and cheese on top of the chicken, as the recipe calls for.  I also added plenty of oregano, and other herbs to the bread crumbs, and italian seasoning and milk to the eggs. Scrumptious!

I made this last week and me and my husband loved it. The only thing I added was a little milk to the egg wash. I also cooked the chicken on a cooling rack to get them a little crispier. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I did this last night, great recipe! I just changed a few things. Instead of plain bread crumbs I added Parmesan, dried basil, oregano, and garlic powder right into the breading.  I pan fried the chicken breasts for about 3 mins a side before adding sauce and cheese and putting them in the oven. Just to speed things up.

Very good recipe :)  I also agree that you may wanna season the chicken beforehand though.  The actually meat did taste a litttle bland. It so moist and yummy though!

I follosed the recipe and used seasoned bread crumbs, a good quality sauce but to be honest it was only ok. I would have thought with such a high rating that it would be great.  It could be a good recipe for a weeknight dinner when you are busy with other things as it does not require lots of attention.

We enjoyed this, even with $1 spaghetti sauce. I'm making it again tonight with homemade spaghetti sauce. It does take a while to make (not in effort but actual baking time) so be prepared. The prep is actually pretty fast. We made as written except we seasoned the breadcrumbs, doubled the recipe and cooked it in an 7x11. :)

Really delicious!  I followed some suggestions and pounded the chicken and seasoned the bread crumbs with oregano, basil, and romano cheese.  Also, baking the chicken on a wire rack for even crispness was a genius idea!  I found the cooking time to be way too long for 2 chicken breasts, considering that it usually only takes 20 mins.  I baked for 20 mins before adding the sauce & cheese, then baked for another 15 & it was perfectly done.

Made this for my husband tonight and he said this was something you could get in a restaurant!  To the bread crumb mix I added 1 teaspoon garlic powder & Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning mix, 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt, 1/4 teaspoon black powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I served this dish with pasta and toasted bread topped with spinach artichoke dip II from this site.

I was so surprised to find a recipe for chicken parm that was so easy and tasty. My husband is a huge fan of Italian food, he gave me lots of compliments when I made this, he even compared it to Buca. I did make a few changes, I was out of jarred sauce so I made my own simple sauce using organic crushed tomatoes, garlic and basil. I also did like many others suggested and only put sauce on top of the chicken and not under to prevent soggy chicken. This one's a keeper!

Very quick and easy dish.  I used italian bread crumbs to spice things up a bit and just spooned a small amount of sauce over the chicken before melting the cheese.  Also served some rigatoni noodles with this so had to buy an extra jar of spaghetti sauce.

Great easy recipe for 2! I only cooked my chicken for 20 min by itself and 15 min in spaghetti sauce and it was done. My super picky husband loved it! Next time I might try some pepperonis on it. Thanks for sharing :-)

Very good. I use Panko breadcrumbs and season with basil, parsley, garlic powder, and sea salt. I also dip the chicken in flour, then egg, then the breadcrumb mixture.   I typically fry my chicken but decided to bake and was amazed at how juicy and crispy it turned out, not to mention the amount of fat ane calories saved by not frying. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made twice the serving suggestion for New Year's Eve dinner with my family. 2 jumbo eggs were definitely a bit too much for 4 breast halves, so I'll suggest using just 1 jumbo egg or 2 smaller eggs. I also seasoned the bread crumbs (whole wheat) with 1/2 tsp onion powder, 3 garlic cloves, minced, a generous pinch of black pepper and 1/2 tsp of salt. It was great with steamed broccoli and chicken and pasta. My family didn't care for the Parmesan cheese, but it was a great hit overall.

First time I ever made Chicken Parmiginana....easy recipe!  I agree with other reviews, so I "dressed" up my bread crumbs with Parmesan, Oregano, and basil...I also flattened the chicken (per other reviews)...meal was delicious!

So good! This is one of my all time favorite recipes! I used panko breadcrumbs, seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I spread about a cup and a half of the sauce in the baking dish and spooned the sauce just on the center of the chicken, so it was still crispy around the edges. I heated the leftover sauce and served it over spaghetti noodles with the chicken. Goes great with garlic bread and salad.

For the most part I followed the recipe but I used Progresso's Italian Style Bread Crumbs, and a lot more Spaghetti Sauce then required as my crowd wanted enough for their noodes :)  Best dish yet!

This was so easy and so great. I followed a couple of other people's suggestions - put the chicken in the egg mixed with oregano, basil, and garlic powder and let it sit in that for about 30 minutes before coating them with the breadcrumbs. I also added parmesean cheese (el cheapo powdered stuff) and Adobo seasoning to the breadcrumbs and used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs. I was worried that between the herbs in the egg & the italian seasoning it would be too much, but it was AWESOME. Used Classico 4-cheese sauce and probably way too much cheese on top... mmmmmmm. Very delicious, I will be making this regularly!

This was such an easy recipe to make and the chicken turned out so moist.  The ultimate taste may depend on the sauce you top it with.  I tend to buy different brands at the supermarket and rarely keep track of, which I like better.  :(  I'll make this again.

This recipe has always turned out for me, and there is just so much you can do with it to make it even better, luike adding seasonings and garlic and such.  I made my own bread crumbs out of a few slices of bread I put in the food processor.  Then, I added about 2 tbls of parmesan cheese and about a teaspoon of oregano.  Breaded the chicken as directed, and used someones idea of cooking the chicken on a baking rack.  TURNED OUT GREAT!  Then chopped about three cloves of garlic to throw in the ragu sauce, and poured that into a 13 X 9 dish with the chicken on top-mostly. Just sprinkled the cheeses on top and baked and ta-ta....yummmmm.  Healthy too!!!

This was really good. I was skeptical that a baked version would not be tender but it was delish. I mixed the Parm with the bread crumbs for the breading. Will make again.

This was a big hit! Used Panko bread crumbs and filled a 9x13 stone with four pounded breasts, basically doubled the recipe but one egg was still enough. We enjoyed the leftovers as much as the first meal!! A real KEEPER!! Thanks!

Good but bland.  Spice up the seasoning and add garlic to the egg. Better yet use melted butter.

I hate thick chicken so I took the breast and sliced it in half (I guess you could pound, but this works better for me, it's easier).  Also used my own spaghetti sauce, not the basic jar sauce.  It was yum!

This recipe was so good and delicious! I cooked the chicken on a wire rack so the bottom didn't get soggy and it came out wonderfully. Also, I added salt and pepper and oregano to the bread crumbs. Will make this recipe again and again!

Did not like how the cutlets came out.  I used very thin cutlets and the breading never browned up when baking and they came out very very dry.  Good thing I had another package of cutlets on hand and this time I fried them.  I used italien flavored bread crumbs and  added some salt and pepper and some grated romano cheese to the egg mixture for some extra flavor.

This is easy and tastes great every time! I make few changes when I make it: I add some grated Parmesan to the Italian Style bread crumbs and dip the chicken in that mixture instead of just bread crumbs. Also, I prefer to make my own spaghetti sauce by sautéing an onion and then add two cans of San Marzano tomatoes, some basil, sugar, salt and pepper and let simmer for 2-3 hours (while adding some water when it gets to thick).

This recipe is excellent! I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers by adding basil, thyme, and garlic to Italian style bread crumbs. I baked the breasts on a wire cookie cooling rack on top of a jelly roll sheet and I did not add the top portion of the sauce until the chicken was completely finished. Yummy!!! And, my husband loved it!

Excellent. My husband and I just had our 4 Year Wedding Anniversary and this is all he asked for.  It was absolutely YUMMY! I am definitely making this again. It takes a bit of time (cooking time), but preparation is super easy and really quick. I highly recommend this!

A very easy restaurant style dish.  Ive tried other chicken parm dishes and this seems to be the one that has hit the spot.  Ive made some minor changes of course as everyone does. You need to add your personal touch.  I use parmesan bread crumbs.  I also top the chicken with some fresh basil and tyme before baking.  I dont bake the chicken with the sauce, I wait 40 minutes until the chicken is crisp and then pull out the baking sheet and put a little bit of sauce under neath each filet.  I find that this doesnt make the chicken soggy.  I top the chicken with some homemade sauce, which is just mashed tomatoes, basil, garlic and some pesto.  I top that with freshly grated parmigiana and mozzarella and bake until the cheese is brown on top.  Wow is this tasty. I then serve it with some fine angel hair pasta and a lasagna roll.  What a meal!

This was just so tasty! I didn't have any sauce on hand, so I made my own and it was incredible: 

1 diced red onion, caramelized in a little x virgin olive oil until golden and almost creamy 
1 clove garlic, added to onion last couple minutes of cooking
1 can whole tomatoes (I took them out of the liquid and crushed them into the pot with my hand.)
a big pinch dried basil and oregano
sea salt and fresh pepper

I pounded the chicken flat (it's so tender and evenly seasoned this way, plus it cooks more evenly.) I used a small cast iron skillet and pounded the chicken between sheets of plastic wrap until it was a very big, thin piece. 

I dredged the chicken breasts in egg thinned a bit with milk (sometimes just straight egg can give you a coating of solid egg between the breadcrumbs- this way it breaks up the proteins a bit.) Then I dipped the chicken in italian style seasoned breadcrumbs with parmesan cheese. 

I fried the chicken in a bit of olive oil and butter until golden and crispy (remember the chicken is pounded thin so this took no time) spooned on some of my homemade sauce, topped with mozzarella and parm, and broiled until the cheese was melted. It was quick, crispy, juicy, and succulent. Everyone loved it. 

Next time I want to add fresh mushrooms to the sauce and try this on a bun. YUM.

Excellent recipe.  I used breadcrumbs the first time, added my favorite seasonings and fried them in a bit of olive oil before baking for about 15 mins.  I baked at 375 and the chicken was very juicy and moist.  Second time I used panko bread crumbs (seasoned again) and fried in olive oil once again.  Loved the Panko crumbs.  Delicious recipe and has become a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing

So simple and so good.  I used italian bread crumbs, double dipped, and lightly drizzled some sauce on top before cooking.  Spooned in on before serving after cooking as other have said.  I wanted the breading to stay somewhat crisp.

A fairly simple recipe. I think the egg & bread crumbs were more than necessary (though it's a bit difficult to cut back on one egg :-)). And I think a little less spaghetti sauce would be good. It was pretty good, but nothing really any better than other similar recipes.

It was very very easy to make and I used a homemade sauce for mine and I also tossed my noodles in EVOO and some Italian seasoning and also some red pepper flake for a bit of bite...but it was even easy enough for my husband to make!

Very good. I cut the chicken breasts into fourths before breading, and served on top of garlic/buttered spaghetti noodles. Will make this again!

I've made this twice and its pretty good. I do season my chicken with a little seasoned salt and pepper and I also add some oregano and basil to the breading mixture.

This was easy to make and really pretty good. However, I think the next time I would do more of a egg-wash/flour/bread crumb mix to give it more coating. I did follow some others in that I added onion powder, pepper, ground salt, and oregano to the bread crumbs. After I poured the sauce over the chicken I gave a few shakes of crushed red pepper to give it some spice. I would probably pound the chicken thin next time because the breasts I used were really thick. Overall good stuff and easy to make.

This has to be the BEST version of Chicken Parmigiana ever! this is a family favorite! The only little mod I do to it is put brown sugar on the tomato sauce to neutralize the tomato acids *especially for those who suffer from Migraines* but this is a fam favorite!

This chicken was good, but not the greatest that I have tasted. I have made it a few times, though, so until I find a better recipe, I will be using this one.

i bumped up the temp a little, to 360, and cut the time down to 30 minutes, as this was plenty time to cook the chicken thoroughly without drying it out.  i also added some oregano and a little parsley to the otherwise plain breadcrumbs.  this seemed to add a little kick to it without taking away from the originality of the recipe.  i also cooked the chicken on a vented broiler pan so the heat could flow throughout, and the second trip into the oven i only let go for about 10 minutes, just enough to get the cheeses melty and the sauce heated.  otherwise, great recipe!!

This recipe was quite tasty. The only alteration I made to this recipe was that I tend to make my own pasta sauce now.  

First I put in about 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil, heated in the sauce pan. Then add 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, 1-2 shallots or 1/2 of a medium sized onion, chopped briskly.  Sautee until browned.  Then I add 1 can of pureed/chopped tomatoes or the equivalent in a box.  1 container of tomato paste.  Salt and pepper to taste.

My family loved it, my partner especially. He can never wait for me to make it again!

I have made chicken parm on several occasions and this recipe did not disappoint! Per some other reviewers, I opted to bread the chicken and cook on a wire cookie type cooling rack to allow it to crispen on the bottom as well. I pounded the chicken first, seasoned the breadcrumbs with garlic, oregano, pepper and fresh basil.  Baked the chicken and then added some homemade marinara on top and topped that with a mixture of provolone/mozz and baked for addtl 10-15 mins. Served alongside some whole wheat rotini with marinara. The only downfall was that I should have used a mix of either parm/mozz or parm/provolone, but that was my error!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I made it for dinner tonight and my husband loved it. I used plain dry bread crumbs which were okay, I think next time I'll use a parmigian flavored one. I also added a pinch of garlic salt and pepper. It gave the chicken a nice flavor. Overall I'd give this a 5 and will be making it again.

When I make it, I don't bread the chicken. I just season it with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and cook it in a pan on the stove (no oil, no butter). I season the chicken and spray the pan with no stick spray and let it cook on low until it's done. Before I serve it, I put a slice of Swiss cheese on top of the chicken, which I put on top of spaghetti, and put some sauce on top and sprinkle with Parmesean cheese.

This is the best chicken parmigiana recipe I've used, and it was so simple! I used almost double the cheese that the recipe called for, but that's because I love extra cheese on everything. I made it with spaghetti and will definitely make this again as my husband and even my picky 2 year old devoured it!

Very good.  Put just a bit of sauce at the bottom of the dish before placing the chicken in.  Had guests dish out the amount of sauce they wanted so it wasn't too wet.

This is so good, I made 5 breast in 9 X 13, 32 ounces of sauce, and topped with fresh cilantro since my fresh basil is now out of season. I've made this a few times now and my crew is always begging for more.

My girlfriend and I made this, she added some yellow peppers and mushrooms and I got to say, this is probably the best chicken Parmigiana I have ever tasted. We followed the instructions exactly the way shown and it turned out perfect. Thank you.

Love it! I did butterfly the chicken and then pounded it. I added some garlic and oregano to the bread crumbs. I also baked it first on a rack and did not pour any sauce on top of the chicken as suggested by others.

I changed this recipe a little based on what I read in reviews and what I had on hand.  I added grated and shredded cheese to bread crumbs (as I did not have fresh), along with garlic salt and powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, parsley, oregano and a some of a Tuscan mill blend that I have. I dipped the chicken in egg and then the bread crumb mixture. My husband bought these boneless chicken breast pieces that were smaller and thinner.  I baked them for a half and hour, thinking they would be done, and served with whole wheat penne pasta and mushroom/olive marinara sauce.  They were not cooked, so definitely leave them in longer like the recipe says.  I ended up throwing them in the microwave since everything else was done.  My husband ate almost all of them and loved it! He said they tasted like chicken tenders (go figure). I wasn't sure if he would like this because he is training for a marathon and doesn't carbo load like a lot do.  It's a definite keeper!

This was a good and very simple recipe, even a novice could manage.  I used thin cutlets which baked quicker. I also put the broiler on after the cheese was added to get that bubbly golden cheese. I also toasted a hoagie roll and put the chicken inside.  It was really delish!

Great. Pound the chicken. Cook for 30 min instead of 40 before adding the cheese.

This was pretty good.  I dipped the chicken in flour before the egg and it helped keep the bread crumbs on.  It was a little bland in taste even though I used italian seasoned crumbs, garlic powder, and dried italian seasoning to the crumbs.

My hubby loved this recipe. I added italian seasoning,garlic powder,parmesean,seasoned pepper and used italian bread crumbs. I also put a little garlic salt on the breast. I couldnt find my tenderizer mallet so I just sprayed the oven racks and let it cook. I also put garlic in my spaghetti sauce and of course sugar. It twas yummy. I'll definately make this again.

I made a few changes, mainly using italian seasoned bread crumbs, and, because of time issues, I just costed the chicken and cooked it the whole time in the spaghetti sauce. I served it over spaghetti noodles.  My husband and son really enjoyed it.

This was soooooo good.  I absolutely loved it.  We had a lot of left-overs, next time I might just do 1/2 a breast per person.

Super easy and totally yummy. I pounded the chicken flat to about an inch thick and salted and peppered the bread crumbs (I used plain). The only thing I'd like to figure out is how to make the chicken breading crispy on all sides. The breading on the bottom got a bit soggy, but the top was nice and crunchy.

Pretty good as written but five stars with a couple of tweaks. I added Italian herb seasoning and also very finely grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs. Also, you can't beat a nice chunky homemade marinara sauce. Thanks!

i think this recipe is really good and very simple.  I do not recomend putting all of the spaghetti sauce it tells you to put in because you can't taste any of the chicken.

This was pretty good.  I wanted to try baking the chicken, as opposed to sauteing in a bit of olive oil, but I have to say the breading gets a bit more crisp and flavorful when sauteing.  Nothing too special about this recipe, but not bad either.

This is a great meal.  I like to bake the breaded chicken though to make it lighter.  I drizzle a little olive oil so the bread crumbs aren't too dry.

This was pretty good.  I used Italian style bread crumbs and instead of store bought spaghetti sauce, I used some leftover BEST MARINARA SAUCE and it came out nicely.  I also flattened the chicken breasts out by using a meat mallot.  Recommend this recipe.  Served over whole wheat angel hair pasta.

Chicken came out great. I made the mistake of thinking that the one jar of sauce would be enough for the chicken and a box of penne. Next time I'll use one jar for the chicken and one jar for the pasta. But with a nice salad and some french bread this meal was fantastic.

Okay ~ I followed the directions to the "T" but was not as pleased with the results as so many others were.  I, like others, found the chicken to be too dried out.  Next time I will either use Chicken strips/nuggets are cut chicken breasts down to smaller sizes.  Other than that, I thought the dish was a very good staple and easy quick dinner.  I will definetly try it again.  I made spaghetti noodles and extra sauce and served the Chicken Parmigiana on top of this.

I think this recipe is as good as the sauce you choose. I used Ragu with mushrooms, which is my favorite jar sauce. I went light on the cheese and it was still great. Fresh parsley and a few dashes of pepper in the bread crumb mixture makes this recipe even better.

This was wonderful! The chicken cooked quicker than I thought it would (only 30 min) but it turned out amazing. I've made Chix Parm. a few different ways before, but this is the only way I'll make it now!

This was so easy and yummy!  I also used Italian style bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand, but I'm so glad I did because it adds an extra zing that I loved!

A couple of the thinner pieces of chicken were too done.  When will I learn to watch chicken more carefully?  Anyway, most of it was excellent.  I used Mr. C's sauce.  Mr. C's is a local Italian steakhouse that sells their own spaghetti sauce in local supermarkets.  I recommend freshly grated parmesan cheese.  It's worth the additional price.  One would be hard pressed to find another recipe with such a good ratio of easy to prepare vs. delicious.  Served with Ali's Amazing Bruschetta, another winning recipe from allrecipes.com.

Doubled this recipe for dinner guests last night and it turned out great!  It's one of our favorite dishes, we usually buy the frozen breaded chicken to use for chicken parmigiana, but I really think it's worth taking the extra time to bread your own chicken.  We even fried the breaded chicken on the stove top just to brown them before baking them in the oven.  Hey, if you're gonna go all out, might as well get as many calories as you can in one meal right!  Turned out delicious and will be making again on a regular basis.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Great starter recipe! I modified this by marinating the chicken breasts in buttermilk, egg, and a blend of italian spices overnight. I coated the chicken in a mix of italian bread crumbs, plain bread crumbs, and parmesan cheese. This was the most moist chicken I have ever had! 

For the spaghetti sauce, I started with a Light Ragu sauce and added fresh sliced mushrooms, green pepper, red pepper, onions, a can of diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce. To give it an extra kick of flavor, I also added italian seasoning and a packet of thick 'n zesty spaghetti seasoning (from McCormick).

This recipe is wonderful when served over whole-wheat pasta and complemented with fresh steamed broccoli or asparagus spears. My family thoroughly enjoyed it! Yum!

This was good, better than some of the restaurants. I doubled the recipe and used 26.5oz of spaghetti sauce because my family loves their sauce. I also seasoned the bread crumbs with oregano, basil, pepper, salt, and garlic powder. I didn't have any problems with the bread crumbs sticking to the chicken like others had but will definetly fry the chicken first for more flavor. I used Hunts spaghetti sauce and it would be so much better with a good quality spaghetti sauce. I also added garlic to the spaghetti sauce and used provolone instead of mozzarella. I put the provolone on the chicken then the layer of spaghetti sauce and then parmesan cheese. Will definetly make this again with garlic or french bread to dip. Yum!

Easy. A favorite at our house.  Instead of the shredded mozzarella cheese I put a slice of provolone or mozzarella directly on the chicken then the sauce.

This is an amazing recipe! I didn't have bread crumbs on hand, so I just used cracker crumbs. You can also use melted butter instead of an egg. I've made it for get-togethers and it's in my meal planner!

We had this dish for dinner last night....My husband raved at how good it was....I put a table spoon of olive oil in a shallow pan, and oven fried the meat before adding the sauce....using the olive oil gave the meat a nice chunch....this is a dish I'll make again.......Oh yes, I also used Italian bread crumbs...

I love Italian food so of course i loved this, it was very simple but a little dry but still good. I used spaghetti sauce with flavoring, like garlic and basil or mushroom and onion, plus i added garlic, i think if i hadnt done that it would have been too plain. In my opinion there was way too much sauce and i didnt even use all that the recipe called for, but it was okay because i used the extra on the pasta....i guess that was the idea.

Excellent recipe....will add to my favorites.  I did bread the chicken and browned in olive oil first with 4 cloves of whole garlic. I also used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce because we like our foods on the "wet" side.  Finally, I didn't have mozarella cheese so I used sliced provolone and added some Italian Seasoning.  Wish I had some right now!

Recipe is great. . .However, I would like to add a few suggestions.  I  had actually received a comparable recipe from my sister and law and it's a surefire hit.

To make the breadcrumbs stick, pan fry them just a little bit before putting them in the oven to bake.  Just so they can stick to the egg coating.  

Second, I generally use seasoned bread crumbs for an even better kick, and throw in garlic cloves (pressed) and finely chopped onions in the spaghetti sauce (which i mix together in a pan before pouring over chicken.

Hope this helps.

Very good and extremely easy to do! My only suggestion is to pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2-1/4 inch thickness before coating.  Mine were really thick, whic prevented a lot of flavor to get throughout the meat.  Otherwise a great recipe tasting just like the same dish in an italian diner!

This recipe is AMAZING. Everyone loved it. It's easy to make (I'm 16 and I don't cook often), and it tasted better than my favorite Italian restaurant's chicken parmigiana. Definitely try it!

I really love chicken parm and this is a five star recipe!!  I altered the directions by pounding the breasts to a uniform thickness.  I think it gives the breasts a more cripsy, crunchy texture.  I also double dipped the breasts and held off on the sauce until serving.  Again, lending to the crispy, crunchy texture that is a hallmark of chicken parm.  I also added the parmesan cheese to the seasoned bread crumbs and used sliced mozzarella.  Thanks Candy for a sure fire keeper!!

This is a GREAT recipe--so simple and yet, so delicious! I used sliced mozzarella rather than shredded, and jazzed up my regular jar of tomato sauce with some sauteed onions, garlic, and green peppers for a kick.  My guests raved. Good job!

Everyone that I make this for asks for the recipe. Instead of using a jar of spagetti sauces I make the sauce from fresh tomato, olive oil,finely chopped onion, fresh garlic and mixed herbs. Season to taste buds. This takes no Time and always a hit!

This was very easy and tasty and I will definitely make it again. That said, it was a little bland-- though this may depend on the seasonings in the spaghetti sauce used. I used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs and Colavita garden-style spaghetti sauce. The result was good but not great. The next time I make this I will season the chicken in addition to the breadcrumbs.

Wonderful!  I used provolone since I was out of mozzerella, and it was still very tasty.  I'll make it again.

Thank you Candy!! I made this last night--my first time making this dish--and I couldn't believe how beautiful it looked when it came out of the oven!!  I used Italian bread crumbs and it was YUM YUM YUM!!  My boyfriend raved and said it reminded him of something his MOM would make (and she's 100% Italian!!)  Big points for the French girlfriend!!  Thanks again Candy!!

This was a good recipe but I think next time I will brown my breaded chicken in the pan and not put the sauce over but just under the chicken and melt my cheese ontop like instructed! Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is amazing. Really really good. I used plain breadcrumbs and seasoned them myself. Everything turned out great. 

Here's a tip - cut the chicken into strips before you bread it, forget the sauce, pasta, and cheese, add some plum sauce, and you have really really good chicken fingers.

I made this for Mr. Picky (my husband) and he even had seconds, which is very unusual.  I thought it was delicious also.  The only change I made was to use Italian bread crumbs instead of plain ones.  I will definitely make this again and again! Thanks!

This recipe is very easy and delicious.  The only thing that takes a while is the actual cooking time.  This gives you a good reason to sip on some wine while you're waiting... Also, make sure that you use good quality sauce such as the Classico tomato and basil sauce.

This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  I am not an experienced cook- I generally take something out of the freezer then look online for a recipe.  I am proud to say this chicken recipe was wonderful.  My other-half also raved about how good it was.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This one hasn't failed me yet.  It does take a little time to cook, but not much to prepare at all.  Simple enough for a guy with not a lot of cooking experience to do (that being me).

This is the first time I've made Chicken Parmigiana and this was WONDERFULL!  I used Five Bros. Marinara & Burgandy Wine sauce and Italian Bread Crumbs.  I also used Foster Farms Tomato & Basil Marinated Chicken Breasts and the chicken was so moist and tender that one of my fiancee's friends was using the back of the knife by mistake to cut the chicken and it worked just fine! Will DEFINTELY be making this again :)

This a great and easy recipe to make.  Everyone liked it at my house, but you gotta make it with some kind of other dish like pasta to full everybody up!  Unlike some other recipes I tried here I'll be actually make this one again!

Bravo!  I thought this recipe was very good and it was simple to make! My husband didn't like the "mushy" breading on the underside, but he's pretty finicky when it comes to chicken.

I used my own pasta sauce with this, and the chicken turned out great!  There weren't any leftovers, and it was well worth the time that I put into the entire meal.  This is definitely one I'll do again!

Turned out great and family love it! Did not cover the chicken with sauce after placing in baking dish so it would turn out crispier, which it did but also fried the cheese. Good thing I love nearly burned crispy cheese!

Tastes great! I’m still trying to figure out why the listed prep time is 30 minutes, though. Took me maybe 15 at most.

I’m a mother of infant twins. , So anything I make has to be fast and easy. This was both and it sure felt good to put an actual something on the table tonight that wasn’t from a box. Sure if you want to kick it up a notch, add the spices everyone suggests, I’m sure it would be delicious. But it’s pretty good as is (which probably depends on the sauce you use since there are really no spices in the recipe) and I could throw it together, no problem.

The prepared spaghetti sauce  ruined it for me but making it again I used a 5 minute  sauce from tomato sauce, basil, oregano, tarragon, fresh garlic, salt and pepper. Other than that I’ll be making this often,  Now it is part of my  go to recipes. Whole family loves  this.

I made this just as the recipe stated and my man can’t stop eating it. The reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it needed more sauce. I recommend the whole jar or equivalent to if your making homemade. The only adjustment I made was pre flouring the chicken 10 minutes before coating in the egg then I used seasoned Pablo instead of bread crumbs because that’s what we use in this house. It has a better crunch factor.

A nice,simple recipe.  I changed out the tomato sauce with salsa (I hadsome left over) and it added a tasty zing.  I will definitely make this recipe again (as written by poster.)

I’ve made this a dozen times. I add Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mix so it gets cooked in the breading. And I use thinly sliced and tenderized breasts and reduce cooking time by 10 min.

Simple recipe to build on!  I added basil, oregano, minced garlic and onion powder to the chicken and the sauce.  The chicken was tender and flavorful paired with veggie pasta tossed in oil and balsamic vinegar reduction.  The flavor composition was outstanding!

I made this with turkey. And I also didn't fry the turkey. I used the bread crumbs on top. Yummo.

Made as directed with additional Italian seasonings. Super easy simple. A better quality pasta sauce than what I had would make it even better.

A simple recipe for a wonderful meal! The only differences in preparation was that I added some garlic powder and parmesan to the bread crumbs, as well as using a tenderizer to flatten the chicken out. We also used chunks of fresh mozzarella as well as shredded mozzarella, which I highly recommend! Garlic bread and a pot of linguine made this a fantastic dinner, and one I plan to make often.

I made this with the recommendations of adding pepper and Italian seasoning.  Baked 15 minutes turned and another 15. Didn’t add sauce to top till after finished. Was wonderful! Will make this again.

Turned out delicious!  Though I didn't really experiment, you can probably improve the taste by using a better spaghetti sauce, or making your own.  Also, chicken breast seem to come larger these days, so I had to increase the cooking time by about 25%.  Otherwise, quick and easy, family loved it!

Next time I'll try it with a more granular breadcrumb. My breadcrumb was very fine, which didn't hold up as a crunchy crust after baking.

Overall, this recipe was really good. I made a couple of adaptations based on what I had. I used 1 XL chicken thigh and cut it into 4 pieces, which cut the cooking time to 25ish mins (I left it in for 28 min which was a little too long). I also like more breading so I double battered them (which used up the entire egg perfectly). I put way too much sauce on though, I'll definitely cut that down next time. Definitely will make again though!

Blah.  It was ok, but I probably won't make again.  Maybe it was the sauce I used, but I found it a bit dry and not very interesting.

My family loved this recipe.  2 things  I did differently were 1.  I  fried the chicken on both sides for 5 minutes after I dipped it in egg and bread crumbs, 2. I heated up the sauce on the stovetop before putting in the oven.  I was short on time and wanted to be sure chicken was thoroughly cooked!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for an easy and delicious evening meal!

I like that the chicken is baked and not fried.  I sliced the boneless chicken breast into thinner pieces  so baked them at 400 degrees for 30 min.  I also baked eggplant at the same time with the same egg dip and bread crumbs.  My husband and I both really liked the results.

I loved this recipe. The only extra things I did was add a little extra mozzarella on top when I plated it and I cooked the noodles while the chicken and sauce was cooking. It ended up timing out perfectly.

My husband loved this. It is so quick and easy to make compared to other recipes that have so many ingredients. Perfect. I don't think I did anything different but add my own spices to the bread crumb mix...I used roasted garlic bread crumbs, onion powder, oregano, basil and parsley, I would have just used my Italian seasoning mix but I was out so I used what I had.

Extremely easy.  Because I was making it for a "covered dish" affair, I actually cut the chicken breasts into small strips but followed the receipe on everything else.  It disappeared quickly.

Instead of using egg, I slathered sour cream all over the chicken before I dipped it in bread crumbs. It was delicious!

I made this last night for the carnivore BF and he loved it! I did make the sauce vs jarred and added a bit of parm to the crumb mix.  I also pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2 in. and baked on a grill pan ( I think is what you call it ) turning half way thru cooking time. Love the no oil version. My other carnivores enjoyed and ate what was left. Thank you Candy!

I'd never made Chicken Parm before and this was a great, simple recipe!  I double dipped the egg and bread crumb mixture and used my own sauce I had on hand.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and super tender!  I've never particularly liked Chicken Parm, but made it for my husband who loves it for Valentine's Day.  He loved it and so did I!

Very easy recipe, very tasty results. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and threw together my own sauce.  It takes some time, but it's very easy. My family's collective belly was satisfied.

I made it as part of a buffet for Christmas- some of the guests liked it others did not.  While it was easy to make I personally did not like it and will go back to chicken parm the traditional way.

For an easy Chicken Parm recipe, it was very good.  I purchased one of those expensive sauces at the grocery and it was good.  If I could have made my own sauce, I'm sure I could have taken it to another level.  That being said, I would make this again.  It was tasty and oh, so easy to make.

It was perfect. I just added some herbs and garlic, random things I had in my cabinet to jazz up the sauce some more. I don't cook that often and I was so glad it turned out well and my boyfriend approved!

Both my husband and I loved this.  I make chicken breast all the time and get bored with the same old stuff.  I added spinach to the sauce because I had some fresh that needed to be used.  It was perfect.

Easy way to make this dish on the fly. I add herbs and spices to bread crumbs I made from all the bread heels my family won't eat. And made my own sauce but the basis of the chicken parmigiana is spot on!

I used chicken cubes as that was the only kind I had. I reduced the oven time because of this. I also used Italian breadcrumbs instead, which gave it an amazing flavor. Finally  I added some gouda cheese along with the mozzarella. My family really enjoyed it! and it was really easy to make!

Very tasty. As a new cook trying to make sure my new husband and I get healthier foods instead of frozen dinners, this was incredibly easy to make. The chicken came out very moist and the sauce complimented it well. Will try to make my own sauce next time. Husband says this recipe is a keeper! New cooks, don't be afraid to try this. :)

My husband is a fan of chicken parmesan, so, I thought I would give this a try.   It was good, but, I think I prefer when the chicken is seared in the pan before baking in the oven to get a nice crispy crust.   Instead of jarred sauce I used the "Best Marinara"recipe from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

Chicken was good, unfortunately I tried a new spaghetti sauce that I did not like. Will make the chicken parm again with a different sauce.

This turned out great and my husband loved it! Like others, I added spices to the bread crumbs - Italian seasoning, basil, thyme and granulated garlic powder. I didn't have spaghetti sauce so I spiced up the sauce with the same flavors. I also didn't have good parmesan cheese (other than what was in the shaker jar which I hear is glorified sawdust - yuck!), but I DID HAVE some sliced jalapeno cheese, so on it went. And really, it couldn't be more perfect. I served it with a side of fresh steamed asparagus topped with lemon juice.

Chicken parm is one of the finest comfort foods ever invented, and this recipe is a fine basic recipe. I was aiming for easy, and not necessarily for the pinnacle of fabulousness, and it fit the bill. I added more mozzarella cheese, because I am a cheese nut.

It was really good! I used Shake N Bake instead of bread crumbs, spread mayo on the chicken breasts before putting them in the crumbs, and put them in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. Then I turned down the oven to 350, added the sauce, chicken and cheese, and cooked for another 15-20 minutes. So good and juicy!

I have made this several times in the past year and it is now one of my favorite recipes. So quick and easy to make ... and so moist and delicious. I prepared it pretty much exactly as in your recipe, only I like my Italian food a little spicy, so I always enhance the jar sauce. I added some fresh minced garlic, chopped onion, oregano, a small can of mushrooms and a dash of red pepper flakes to the sauce, before I poured it over the chicken. It was very yummy !!

I made this recipe with the addition of adding some garlic and onion powders to the sauce. It was a big hit with my wife, who is an expert cook! Definitely will be made again ... perhaps with a bit of something to spice up the sauce a bit more.

Soon good. Used Silver Palate low sodium Marinara Sauce and par boiled chicken. Didn't coat chicken with bread crumbs I just added on the top. So simple, I made this about a week ago and they are asking me to make again!!!!  Thanks! I also have to double this recipe for a family of 5 so there is left over.

This is a great recipe.  I've made several times but I season the chicken with Goyo adobo all purpose seasoning  and dried basil before coating with egg and breadcrumbs.  Also, I set my oven to 375 degrees because the chicken was a little pink on the inside because I use slightly thicker pieces of chicken breast.

I've made this recipe and it was DELICIOUS. I've made a few changes. What I did was marinate the chicken breast with rosmary, thyme, and garlic and let it sit over night in the refrigerated. And I substituted the bread crumbs with some fried onion snacks that I crushed up. It gave the chicken SO MUCH FLAVOR. It is a family favorite.

I followed the recipe except for using Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also used a cooling rack to bake the chicken more evenly. Chicken was moist and cooking times were accurate. Next time I may try marinating the chicken first in Italian dressing. Super easy, great tasting meal!

I took the advice  of two other reviews: I pounded the chicken to half inch  and added the seasonings of basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the bread crumbs and parmigiano cheese  mixture.  I also lowered the time in the oven to 32 min. on the first cooking as well as put the breasts on a wire rack in the sheet pan in the oven. They came out great: very moist and tasty. Thanks everyone.

Another add to the "dear do this again" recipes! Very simple recipe to do made a couple alterations to it just for personal taste. In the bread crumbs I added some garlic powder and Italian seasonings. I also warmed up the spaghetti sauce and added some spices to that as well. 
The only complaint I have about this recipe is that it is absolutely too much for 2 people. I paired it with some thin spaghetti noodles and we each had a chicken breast. Neither my boyfriend or I could finish, we each had about half a chicken breast left and noodles left over. Next time I might just do one large chicken breast and half it for each of us. Other wise he loved it, I loved it, we will be doing this again. :)

So good; just what we were craving, and so easy! Added some fresh tomatoes, and spices to the breadcrumbs as is so natural. Cooking times were perfect - used 5 chicken breasts and still didn't need a whole jar of sauce. Definitely will be making this again!

Simple and quick, my kind of meal. However, the cooking ingredient counts were off.  

I tripled the recipe in - order to make six chicken breasts - and only used one single 25oz sauce jar, and it was enough to completely smother the chicken top to bottom. I used one egg and still had leftovers. It turned out great and everyone loved it.

Great recipe. However, I rub the chicken with mayo (pick whichever mayo you prefer, mayo light, mayo with olive oil etc) and then roll it in bread crumbs. Tastes way better.

I loved this recipe, it was so easy to make, especially with a 1 year old running around. I chose to use the shake and bake chicken coating( to make my recipe easier). Baked in a glass cake pan and it turned out nice and juicy. My husband loved this meal especially for Valentines Day!!

Made this for the wife and she raved about it.  I also thought it was really good.  The only thing I added was a can of mushrooms and fresh parsley to the sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

A decent place to start, but very plain as written. I'll probably give it another try with a marinade and homemade sauce and breadcrumbs.

This was pretty good but I'd add half the amount of Parmesan it says too because otherwise it tastes a little dry but don't get me wrong it was pretty freaking good

This was exceptional! I followed as other reviewers indicated to add spices and cheeses to the breadcrumbs. I also baked the chicken on a cooling grate inside a cookie sheet to keep it nice and crispy. I heated the sauce separately and assembled at the end. I would highly recommend using a smaller chicken breast or slice a larger one to make a smaller one. This is a very filling meal. You will also need less spaghetti because of the addition of the chicken.

I made this for my family last night and got rave reviews! They said it was "outstanding" and that it tasted "restaurant quality". The only changes I made was to add a little salt and freshly-ground black pepper to the chicken breasts after dipping them in the egg. I used seasoned bread crumbs and mixed some of the parmesan cheese with it as some suggested. This was in addition to adding more parmesan later with the mozzarella in step 3. I also sprinkled a little oregano on top to give some more herbal flavour which I love. The pasta sauce I used was Prego Fresh Mushroom which is a family favourite. I tried not to change the recipe too much with the first try. It is definitely a great basic recipe that you can build upon. This is a keeper!

One review stated time consuming, I thought this was fairly easy to make. It is very good tasting. I served over spaghetti (angel hair), using the remainder of the jarred sauce. I used 3 single breasts and cut in half horizontally and then in half again. I still pounded the breast meat to 1/2 inch. I did not have provolone either, but it still was tasty. Thanks for the good recipe.

Loved this recipe. The seasoning was a little bland for us so I added some oregano, garlic powder & parsley. It was a win for our family :)

Yummy! All the family enjoyed this, even my 5year old. I used chicken thighs as we prefer these to the breast. The only thing I will change next time is to add some sauce to the pasta before plating as I don't like to see plain pasta on the plate. I will definitely cook this again.

If I could, I would give this 3 1/2 stars.  It was good.  I used salt n pepper and garlic powder on the chicken before breading.  I added a little bit each of the following to the bread crumbs:  parm cheese, salt, garlic powder, oregano and italian seasoning.

This recipe really turned out well! I made it tonight for dinner, substituting the breadcrumbs with Kraft Shake n Bake extra crispy which I added lemon and pepper spice and 2 spoonfuls of parmesan cheese. I left the baking temperature at 355 F instead of 350. For the tomato sauce in the pan, I included some of Kraft's shredded TexMex cheese along the first half of the pan to include a cheesy binding agent to the chicken and then used the rest to coat. Served it worth pasta and a side salad. Will totally use this recipe again!

This recipe is great! Make sure that you put sauce in the bottom of the chicken as well as on the top. I've forgotten twice and it really does make the difference in taste and moisture.

There's one thing I learned after many attempts at GOOD chicken parmigiana - good results = a good recipe!  And I finally found it!  I seasoned it the way I like but really just followed the recipe. The chicken was so tender and juicy. Just right!  Thanks!

I've always hated chicken parm! But its my boyfriend's fav dish, every time he orders it at a restaurant he has me try a bite and i never like it. But this recipe was great!!!!! I can only handle about 3-4 bites as it fills me quickly but its a new family favorite! My picky 8yr old even loves it and requests it!!!!!

All I can say is yum!  I made the dish according to the recipe, the only changes I made were, I added some of the Parmesan cheese, pepper and garlic to the egg mixture when dipping the chicken.  I also double dipped the chicken breast and it gave the chicken a great crisp breading even with the sauce on top.  I used marinara instead of spaghetti sauce and that was it.  Even my picky 6 year old ate this dish, so good.

Me and my husband love this recipe!  You can add your own spices etc to the sauce if you want, but even with just plain tomato sauce it is delicious.  Best of all it is VERY easy!

I have to say that I absolutely hate to cook, but I tried this really recipe and it turned out great. I added 100% Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs for a cheesier flavor.

Always a huge hit. I made 8 cutlets, also seasoned the egg mixture with salt, pepper, dried parsely and garlic powder.  I use an Italian seasoned crumb mixture as well and used my own home made spaghetti sauce instead of jarred sauce. Served with linguine on th side. My family loved this!~

Excellent recipe.  I sliced the breasts to thin for even cooking, used Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs and for marinara I used abarata style because We like a spicy kick.  I baked the chicken early in the day to divide the prep time, this didn't hinder flavor or texture one bit.  Thripled the recipe and ended up 5 out of 5 rave reviews.  Days later I'm still getting calls and emails about the chicken!

Using Italian bread crumbs, along with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese and some salt and pepper adds so much flavor, also, that's a lot of sauce, my family prefers just a light dollop on the chicken between the cheese and chicken. I serve this with Parmesan angel hair pasta and a veggie of the day, beans seem to be in abundance in the garden right now. :)

I fixed this last night and it was wonderful.  I did add purple onions and mushrooms. I saute' them in butter then added the spaghetti sauce and heated up.  I also baked them for 15 minutes then added the mozzarella cheese and baked for 5 more minutes.  Wonderful meal with salad and bread sticks.

Recipe was wonderful! Used Bertolli marinara sauce and Italian braed crumbs. I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt,and pepper after pounding evenly. Chicken was tender and juicy. I received many compliments at the dinner table!

This was delicious and so easy!  I mixed garlic salt with the bread crumbs and only put sauce on the top instead of the top and bottom.  I liked it better than any restaurant chicken parm I've had, and my husband and dad raved too!

I washed and tenderized the chicken breast with the dull and flat sides of the meat cleaver. Then seasoned it up.  Don't forget the salt.  I use seasoned breadcrumbs and use a good handful of shredded cheese per chicken breast.  I used mozzarella and 6 cheese italian combined.  i also used a full jar of sauce so there was enough for the pasta.  

If serving with pasta, start boiling the water in the last 20 minutes of baking time so everything is ready at the same time.

So simple and I can fool my husband into thinking I've spent some time on dinner. :0) Make sure you pound the chicken out so it's an even thickness throughout. So good and EASY!

Thank you for a great recipe it was simply wonderful. I used progresso garlic & herb bread crumbs which gave it a great flavor. I also followed some of the other suggestions and waited to put the sauce on.

Simple- and tasty.  But could be tastier if chicken was marinaded or had some seasoning on it first.  And may try without sauce on top next time to see if we like it better more crunchy.  Kids gobbled it up!

This recipe is so simple and delicious, it made it to the top of my recipe binder. The first time I made this, it came out a bit soggy on the bottom. This time around, I think I just might bake it first and then ladel heated spaghetti sauce on it; followed by a few minutes in the oven to melt the cheese. Another alternative would be to fry it.

This was so easy to make and tasted delicious! I used Italian bread crumbs and added a little extra Italian seasoning and minced garlic. I also put about 3/4 the sauce below the chicken and about 1/4 on top. Added a little angel hair pasta and garlic bread on the side and it was delicious!

It was easy to make. Our only complaint was it came out salty. Perhaps the breading I used along with the Parmesan Cheese, or even the spaghetti sauce I used, created a salty taste. Any how, I will cook this again and maybe use a different breading, I used Italian from Aldis, to see if it is less salty. Very quick and easy.

This is a great basic recipe that is easy to prepare. This was my first time making Chicken Parmigiana, and i followed this recipe exactly. It did come out a little bland.  First, I would recommend using a higher end jar of pasta sauce instead of basic Ragu because the sauce really does pull the whole dish together. Secondly. SEASON SEASON SEASON. Next time, I will definitely be rubbing the chicken down with some sauteed garlic. But for a someone just learning about cooking, this is a grwat foundation to build off of.

This is one of my favorite dishes and I was glad to see how easy it was to make! Unfortunately I ran out of normal bread crumbs and had to use original shake n bake that only I noticed the taste of. I think next time I make this, I'll get the Italian seasoned bread crumbs to add some flavor.

Great basic recipe, which I appreciate as a struggling new cook. I followed the recipe exactly except for sprinkling some Italian seasoning on top. I think it added a little more flavor.  I will reiterate what another reviewer said, the sauce you use will make or break the dish. I didn't particularly care for the one that I used (Barilla's Roasted Garlic... what I had in my pantry), but that's not the fault of the recipe! I'll keep playing around with different combinations until I find one that fits, since this recipe lends itself to being changed to your tastes.

Despite a lot of my breading falling off, this was amazing!!  I added salt and pepper to the chicken while breading it, and added some Italian herbs over the cheeses.  Everybody loved it!

this was really good. i will probably brime(is that the term? let the chicken soak in salt water a few hrs before cooking) next time, as the chicken was a little dry for me. could have been my fault for overcooking though. i added a dash of salt and cheese to the bread crumb mix. it was great, and very open to modifications.

a simple and amazing dish! The men in my house ate this right up with ceasar salad and garlic bread, and were begging for seconds. So easy to make, was able to watch most of a movie with little pause. Fun it up with your own flavor of sauce or use jalapeno rounds like we did

One of the best dishes I have made in a long time!  My family absolutely loved this:)  The only difference I made, other than adding extra spices and Parmesan cheese, was instead of dipping the chicken in egg first, I sprayed it with a non-stick, olive oil spray.  The spray didn't have any fat or cholesterol and added a taste of olive oil.   Wonderful!!!!!

Very easy to make. I added parsley, salt and pepper to the plain bread crumbs. I didn't have chicken breast on hand so I used boneless skinless thighs and pound them down a little bit. I also didn't have eggs, so I dipped them in butter instead. I DID think the baking time was WAY too long. I only baked mine for 25 minutes alone, then added sauce and cheese and baked for 20 minutes more. Turned out nice and moist and not bit soggy at all.  My husband and I loved this!

Wonderful!  So easy to make.  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I did different was added fresh sliced zucchini to the tomato sauce and viola, you had a vegetable too!

Very easy to make, but next time I will season the chicken very well before breading- otherwise it tastes a little bland. I also added italian seasoning, garlic powder and parmesean cheese to my breading. Seems like it would be very easy to play around with.

This was so good.  I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I crushed dried stuffing mix and used that instead.  As per another review, I cooked the chicken on a cooling rack on top of the cookie sheet to make the chicken crunchier.  Very yummy!

Great, simple recipe.  I only had Italian bread crumbs on hand and I can't imagine using plain.  Served over whole wheat pasta.  Will definitely be making this easy recipe again.

Very good. It was similar to my own recipe I've been using for a while.  I don't dip the chicken in eggs, and I change up the breadcrumb mixture a little.  I add parm cheese, salt & pepper, garlic & onion powder to the breadcrumb mixture.  I also cook the cultlets in a frying pan.

I pound my chicken to 1/2 inch thick. Instead of baking, I cook in pan on the stove with oil. When I am ready to serve it, I pour sauce over chix, add a slice of cheese and broil until bubbly. This keeps the chicken from losing its crispiness. They do it this way at Carrabbas Italian Grill as well.

I was trying to figure out how to cook up some chicken and only seemed to have bread crumbs and spaghetti sauce, found this recipe and it was DELICIOUS! I did add parsley, oregano, garlic powder and parm. cheese to the bread crumbs, and since I had thin chicken, I only cooked it for 20 minutes, then after adding sauce and cheese another 20 minutes. It was so good! Will definitely be making this regularly, and it was so easy to! We enjoyed this with caesar salad and angel hair pasta (topped with the leftover sauce)

Simple yet elegant. I had a few pieces of provolone left over from Baked Ziti IV that I made the same day, and added a bit to some of the chicken, and it went over well.

I don't like chicken parmigiana most people make. I am not a frying kind of person. I made this recipe almost as is (my hubby and I love garlic), I added some spices and herbs that I like. I actually like this recipe. It's the first time I ate Parmigiana that didn't have a fishy taste. Thanks Candy. I now have a new recipe for my biweekly rotation.

This was okay.  The chicken was good but I think a homemade marinara sauce would have been best with it.  Great as a starter recipe and sure is simple to make.

I'm always looking for recipes for 2 considering I usually only cook for my boyfriend and myself. This was a great find. I have made this many times since first finding it and  I always look forward to eating it. For a side dish, I would recommend sticking to vegetables or maybe a small portion of wheat pasta and vegetable in order to have a healthy dinner :-)

I changed a couple of things. I used Italian bread crumbs, Bertolli marinara sauce, and sprinkled Italian seasoning after the cheese was added. A wonderful and easy dish!!!

Great recipe.  I agree with other reviewers about adding a little more seasoning (garlic, s&p, parmigiano) to the bread crumbs.

This was really good.  The only thing I did differently was pour the sauce over the chicken & sprinkle with cheese the last 10 minutes, kept it from being soggy.  Yummy :)

Following KC Martel's instructions from the reviews below, I'm turning out restaurant-quality Parmigiana without fail. This is also a great recipe to try with turkey.

Yummy! I also put the last of the sauce on last - just a dollop on before serving the rest I put over penne pasta. I used Italian bread crumbs and added parmesan to them.  Very good!

Very Good!  It is important to use a good spaghetti sauce when making this recipe.  It will make a huge difference.  I cooked the breaded chicken 50 minutes as it wasn't crispy enough at 40 minutes like the recipe stated.  After I put the chicken in the sauce, I baked it just long enough to melt the cheese, which was about another 10 minutes.  I heated the sauce prior to putting it in the baking dish because I was cutting down on the final baking time.   The end result was very yummy and I will be making it again.

Delicious!  I happened to have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used that and store brand jar sauce.  Everyone loved it!  I made extra and (unfortunately for me) there's barely any left!

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time, I didn't realize that my Parmesan cheese had gone bad so I used mozzarella cheese only.  I absolutely loved it but my fiance only thought it was okay.  The second time I made it exactly like the recipe said and my fiance loved it but I just thought it was okay.  I guess it depends on your taste.  Either way, this is definitely a good recipe.

Wonderful! My husband and I enjoyed this very much. I made it accordingly to the recipe. However, I used my own sauce instead of buying the jar sauce. I think with the usage of different sauces, it will either be good or real bad.

Loved this dish...I pounded the chicken to make it super tender then added some herbs to the bread crumbs for more flavor.

The chicken was juicy and tender. Very yummy. Like several others here, I pounded the breasts to a uniform thickness, cooked them on a Pam-covered cookie cooling rack, and added some Italian spices to the breadcrumbs. I will definitely make this again.

I am a total cooking novice. However, this recipe was easy to make and it came out better than I could've expected given my terrible cooking skills. My boyfriend (who is a picky eater) and I thought the chicken was phenomenal - perfectly cooked - tender and juicy. Great recipe!

This was delicious!  I used butter instead of egg and Italian bread crumbs.  My BF would have liked the chicken breading to be crispier so next time I might broil it the last few minutes.  And yes there will def be a next time!  Thanks!

This was great! I added the extra spices suggested by 'something different again!?' and spooned the extra sauce on top after baking rather than before. I served this on Spaghetti. Yum!

Love this recipe!  Easy & tasty--the perfect combo.  The only variation I make is to pound the chicken thin for easy baking.  In a pinch, I once used sliced provolone on top, and that was just as tasty!

This is a good, easy, but basic chicken parmigiana recipe. Maybe next time I'll add some fresh herbs to jazz it up a bit. Thanks!

Very good and easy recipe.  I often mix a couple palm fulls of grated parmesan with the bread crumbs and provolone to melt on top.  And when I'm feeling a little lazy, I just put a few slices on top of the chicken during the last few minutes of cooking and then pour the sauce over to serve.

This was a big hit with the family. Before egging the chicken, I rolled it through a mixture of flour, garlic salt, oregano, and pepper. I used an Italian bread crumb mixture, then fried the chicken in a cast iron skillet for two minutes on each side(medium heat) before sprinkling Mozz and Parm on it. Twenty minutes at 350 covered top and bottom in sauce, and the Mmm Mmm's started. It was served over spaghetti, with a store bought sauce boiled down with 1/2 cup chianti. BOOM! It has already been requested that I make it for my wife for her birthday dinner. Now that's a statement!

This was very good!  :)  I will definitely be making this again.  Instead of pouring the whole bottle of sauce over the chicken I saved half and poured it over the spaghetti.  Then laid the chicken on top.  YUM!

This dish is my hubby's absolute favorite!  I like to use thin-sliced chicken breasts and brown them (after coating in bread crumbs) in a few tablespoons of olive oil, over medium high heat, until they are nice and golden and crusty, about 2 minutes per side, before baking (another 8-10 minutes in a 400 degree oven).  Delicious!

This recipe was pretty delicious. I added noodles with garlic and some butter, and put garlic in the sauce. I also served with sauteed spinach. I give it 5 stars because the small number of ingredients it requires, most of which most people already have at home.

Very good, a little dry but my husband and I enjoyed it! Next time I plan on taking others advice and using a homemade marinara rather than spaghetti sauce.

My family LOVED this dish! I was a little turned off by how easy the recipe and ingredients sounded but thought I would give it a try. This is now a family favorite and will definately make again and again. The only alteration I made was to the bread crumbs. I added Freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs before rolling the chicken in them. Very easy and delicious recipe. A must try!

This recipe turned out ok, but was not a favorite.  However, I can not say that it was all because of the recipe, I think it may be because of the sauce I used.  I will try it again in the future with some changes.

I pounded the chicken to flatten it first. Added onion and garlic powder to bread crumbs.  Only covered the top with sauce after it was done.  Also tried it with veal -- baking it with the chicken was fine, but could have gone for less time because the veal's thinner.

SOOOOO great. I've been making this exact recipe for 2 years for my husband. He loves it very much.  This was the first 'real meal' I ever learned how to cook. It's right up there with the Garlic-Lemon Double Stuffed Chicken recipe on here.

This recipe is very easy and very good. We added garlic and herbed flavored crackers instead of regular bread crumbs and could tell a difference. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe!  Used a jar of Newman's Own Sockarooni Sauce and is was perfect.  Next time I think I'll try other reviewer's idea of having the chicken on a rack to make it more crispy.

i gave this five stars because it was super easy to make.  i think four stars on the taste.  not because it wasn't delicious, but because i am not a big chicken parmigiana kinda girl.  therefore, five stars overall.  i covered the chicken in garlic powder and italian seasonings after coating with the bread crumbs.  i also used italian bread crumbs and half mozzarella and half parmesan cheeses.  will definitely  make this again.  thanks!

This recipe was just "okay" in my opinion.  I don't like using the jarred spaghetti sauce, and the breading really wasn't thick enough.

Also, I never put the breaded chicken swimming in the sauce when making chicken parmigiana.  It's a really good way to turn your breaded chicken into soggy chicken.  Instead, I just assemble it, and let the cheese melt on it's own.

I will say one thing for it, it was quick and easy.

My husband said the chiken needs to be juicier, but we liked it a lot!

As others suggested, I added basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.
I was going to, but I forgot to add parmesan cheese in there...

I added the second half of the sauce and the cheeses after 15 minutes of the second baking time.

Will make this again!

We are low carb people so I always substitute parm cheese for flour and comes out great.

Very nice, although I spiced up my chicken, and dipped it in seasoned flour, then egg, and breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan. Very easy to make

Make this for impromptu dinner guests and look like a rock star.  It's easy and you probably have the ingredients already.

Here's what I did. Made chicken strips 
(think kid friendly) I did the egg wash then the seasoned bread crumbs baked it then did cheese and let them dip in store bought spaghetti sauce. Not fancy but it was delish and they would probably eat it once a week so that works for me! EASY and GOOD.

I would have given this four or five stars if I had followed the other reviewers' advice to bake the chicken on a cooling rack to make it more crispy. I wanted to try the recipe as written, but I think it needed to be a little crispier. I'll try this again with the suggestions and I think it will be a bigger hit.

bake 40-50 minutes on cooling rack on baking sheet.  Make homemade sauce in skillet and add chicken at last minute, top with cheese and let melt.  1/3 cup italian bread crumbs, 1/3 cup parmesean cheese, seasonings

I made this for a joint birthday dinner for my husband and my grandmother.  Everyone loved this, from young to old.  Definitely bake the chicken first on a cooling rack over a pan.  It kept it crispy and delish!!

This recipe was easy and simple to make.  I seasoned my bread crumbs with some dry spices (oregano, garlic powder, black pepper) just because my husband likes the extra flavor.  But otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was moist which was great because sometimes I have problems with dry chicken breasts.  I would definitely make this again.  It was a hit at my house.

Good, but I think next time I try this, I'll make a few changes.  It tasted like it was missing something.  I think some garlic powder, onion powder and pepper might add a bit more flavor.  A good basic recipe, a couple of minor adjustments would make it great.

I love this recipe.  I don't follow it exactly.  I sometimes substitute tomato sauce for the spaghetti sauce.  I also add red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs to add extra zing.  I have been using the recipe for years.

Very good and very easy, I did pound the chicken breasts to make them thinner so they would cook faster. Husband and daughter both thought it was very good. I will definitely make this again.

This was a very easy recipe and my kids loved it. I put the noodles on the plate and then topped it with the meat.  I sprinkled a little more parm. on the top and with a little broccoli on the side and a bread stick it made a wonderful meal.

Very good - I have made it twice - once following the directions exactly and once by frying the chicken pieces in a pan instead of baking it as the directions state. It's not as healthy that way, and I wouldn't do it often for that reason, but it tasted great!

This recipe was easy to fix and will be a repeat dinner.  However, it did not have a lot of flavor--it was pretty bland.  Will have to try spicing it up next time.

I followed everyones suggestions about waiting til the end to add the sauce on top and it was delicious! I also sprinkled a bunch of the cheese in the sauce that was used underneath the chicken, it added some extra gooeyness that was great! I will definitely be making this again!

Very authentic recipe, tastes just like what I've had at restaurants. The only thing I did differently was to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. The cooking time was not long enough either but only because I had gigantic chicken breasts. I would say this is more of an adult recipe than a kid friendly one, mine kind of turned up their noses at the cheese.  I will make this again though, thanks for sharing!

I thought this was delicious. I was craving chicken parmigiana and this was super easy and hit the spot. My family thought is was ok but they arent big on the dish anyways. The only change I made was what other reviews suggested.  Sauce on the bottom. Next time I think I will just put the sauce on when the chicken is done and ready to be served. That way the chicken will be crispy all over.  I will use this recipe from now on every time I get a chicken parmigiana craving.

This was really good! I used garlic/herb breadcrumbs and added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a pinch of oregeno. For the sauce I used pre-made 3 cheese, added parm cheese to the sauce. I cooked it for shorter times than posted. It turned out great- and will be making again!

This was a great easy recipe for a starting cook. My family really liked it. I made this with some pasta to go under the chicken for the second time in the oven.  I used a recipe I found online for the bread crumbs to add extra flavor other than just plain bread crumbs

This is really good and easy! I used Italian bread crumbs, a 14 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and added garlic and Italian seasoning. Also, I used a bag of real shredded Parmesan cheese instead of the grated stuff in the canister.

This is a good recipe, and my whole family liked it. I also pounded the chicken out, and added extra seasoning to the bread crumbs. Good stuff.

I made this for dinner tonight for my family. It turned out better than I expected. However, I did add a lot of Italian seasoning to both the chicken and to the sauce. To my bottle of sauce I also added garlic salt, Parmesan cheese, and pepper. I did pour the entire bottle of sauce to the pan. Then added the chicken on top, with mozzarella on top of it all. It turned out wonderfully. I served it with salad, garlic-buttered rolls, and angel hair pasta.

The first time I went to try this recipe I accidentally bought the gold n plump garlic herb chicken breasts in the freezer section. I figured it would be fine since garlic and herb seemed a good thing to pair w/ the dish. However, I was disappointed with the flavor of the chicken breasts. So I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt and tried again with plain chicken breasts pounded flat and baked for 30 minutes. I used prego 3 cheese pasta sauce and it came out pretty good. It was a little on the boring side and could use some more herbs and spices in the chicken, but the recipe worked out good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. I used too much sauce, though, and it was like my chicken was swimming in sauce. I served mine with spaghetti.

Easy and Great!!  My boyfriend is so picky!!!  It's hard to find anything that he'll eat.  He loved this one and it didn't require a lot of effort.  I made sure to use polly-o cheese and a good sauce.  The only thing I did different was to use chicken cutlets so and this was wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I took others'  advice and cooked the chicken on a cookie rack- made the chicken crispy all around.     recipe is great if you spice up the bread crumbs.  Hubby loved it!

ive only had chicken parmigan once in my life and ive never made it. dh and i made this together (which was amazing) and we both LOVED it! it did have a strong marinara taste, so next time i might make my own sauce and add a little more cheese (or something to cut back the marinara kick). otherwise, OUTSTANDING!!

Hubby was impressed - this was incredibly easy but very tasty. I would just suggest to be careful with your cooking times; my oven cooked the chicken in less than 25 minutes instead of 40, which would have dried it out.

This was pretty good. Not spectacular. I felt like the chicken needed more. The spaghetti sauce and cheese was not enough flavor on the chicken, it sounds weird I know. Maybe if you use seasoned bread crumbs it would help give the chicken some more flavor.

This was VERY good for not much effort! I used more sauce than indicated because I used more chicken. I also followed others suggestions to put all the sauce in the pan, then spoon some over the chicken when serving. This tasted just like the chicken parmigiana at out local Italian place. Will keep this receipe handy for when guests come over!!

I have been married 15 years to man who I thought hated chicken parm. Last week he asked me to make some. I am glad I chose this recipe. It was good. The chicken was moist. I served it over angel hair. I can't wait to make again.

4+  I also used Italian bread crumbs because regulare would not have had enough flavor.  Next time I may try Panko bread crumbs.  All in all, the chicken was very moist and was a HUGE hit with the family.  Everyone gobbled it up.  It's in the family rotation now! Thanks for sharing.

Simple enough and the chicken came out juicy which impressed my husband since I'm new at this cooking stuff. I used Italian bread crumbs and sliced mozarella cheese on top. The only thing I would change next time is to make sure that I either pound the chicken breasts or just use a thinner piece....just to make it like the restaurants do.

This is a good recipe, but it relies a lot on what kind of spagetti sauce you choose. I recommend a fairly sweet sauce, so that the cheese and chicken don't get over salted.

This was very good.  Although, I might try italian bread crumbs the next time to add a little more zest.

This recipe is great!  My family loved it, and there was enough sauce (which is always the complaint at my house).  The only thing I changed was that I used sliced mozzarella rather than grated, just because that was all I had.  Excellent!

I just thought it was ok.  I used Italian breadcrumbs and added crushed pepper flakes, oregano and thyme to it.  I used an entire jar of mushroom and basil spaghetti sauce.  I used an entire 8oz. pack of shredded mozzarella and an entire 3oz. pack of shredded parmesan.  I also served it with fetuccine, which I tossed with a butter, garlic, crushed red pepper and parsley mix.  In my opinion, the pasta was better than the chicken.  My husband thought that the chicken was better than the pasta.

Another chicken hit in our household.  The meat was incredibly moist and tasty.  I even added grated parmesan to the breading mixture to give it some added "cheese".

This came out very tasty and juicy. I had two big pieces of chicken to use, so I doubled the bread crumbs and egg mixture.  I used Italian seasoned crumbs and added some italian herbs and minced garlic to the outside of the chicken breasts before dipping and coating them. My husband loved it.  He even asked to bring leftovers to work, and he never likes taking leftovers!

I thought this was a great recipe and will certainly make it again!  I did use my own sauce though and seasoned bread crumbs, to which I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I served it over angel hair pasta and both my husband and I loved it.  Very easy to make, even with home-made sauce.

Oh my gosh this was so, so good! I served it with fettucine sprinkled with butter and parmesean but I didnt even touch the noodles. The chicken was too delicious to ignore! I used a four cheese spaghetti sauce and put a little splenda in there like some suggested. My fiance said this was the best chicken dish I've made so far. I will absolutely make this one again.

Oh wow. This is the first thing I've ever made!  I'm a newlywed and just learned how to cook.  My husband LOVED this recipe.  It's by far the best thing I've made yet.  It's in the oven as we speak..I'm making it for our Valentine's Day meal.  I passed on this recipe to my sisters and one of them is making it tonight for her husband as well.  I add olives, italian seasonings and pretty much extra on everything:) We love Cheese in this house

Very simple and you do not have to be exact, easy to season the way your family loves it. I use a mix of italian cheeses - we are cheese lovers.

This came out perfect the first time I made it and I am not the greatest of cooks.  My boyfriend who is very picky loved it!  The only thing I did differently was use provolone slices instead of the mozzarella.

I've made chicken parm a few different ways, and this one is the easiest, and turned out the tastiest. I did use Itallian bread crumbs instead of plain, cuz that's what I had on hand.

The chicken came out a little dry, but that was my own fault. I should've pounded the chicken breasts to make them thinner, and also should've used more sauce.

Very Tasty!!  I used cubed mozarella (it was all I had) on top instead of shredded. Also, served it on a bed of spaghetti.  Delicious and very easy to make. Thanks!!

OK I don't cook but I'm learning... I decided to make this recipe and I'm sorry but I have to give myself a two thumbs up. I was cheered by my boyfriend and his cousin.... They said they couldn't tell I couldn't cook, it was that good. thank you for this recipe.

I used Italian breadcrumbs and shredded Italian blend cheese instead of mozzarella and parmesan. This is a great recipe for a weeknight family dinner.

Loved, loved, LOVED this recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing, except maybe more cheese!  My 4 yr. old daughter absolutely loved this.  She is a big chicken fan and a big spaghetti fan, so to her, this was the best of both worlds!

Great starter recipe, though I tweaked it and LOVED the outcome:  Added dried basil, dried oregano, dash of garlic powder and a dash of onion powder to the bread crumbs before coating chicken breasts.  OMG! Sooooo good with the extra spices.

I'm sitting here with a full tummy and a smile on my face.  This is the best recipe I've tried so far on allrecipes.com.

I followed the instructions exactly, prep was very easy, and it turned out wonderfully. I served it with spaghetti.  

I never thought I could cook something that would be that good.  5 stars, and I wouldn't change a thing.

Freshly grated asiago cheese was added to the bread crumbs, and the breasts were pounded for uniformity.  I used more sauce than called for, and topped with provolone, mozzarella and asiago.  This was very quick and easy, and garnered compliments from the picky teen!

This was a fantastic meal. My whole family loved it. I had never cooked this before, but have always eaten it at Italian restaurants. This is just as good, if not better, than what I have eaten in restaurants.

Totally delicious!  I used parmesan bread crumbs and put a little romano cheese on it in addition to the mozzarella.  We've already enjoyed this several times.  My whole family loves it.

Very Easy and delicious.  Like others suggested, I pan fried the coated chicken breasts in olive oil and reduced the baking time to about half.  I have cooked them twice and twice it has been wonderful!

I used chicken cutlets.  Cooked for only 10-12 minutes then 10-12 minutes with sauce.  Very good.  Be sure to have extra sauce available on the side.

Made this last night, and my father loved it!  I didn't care for the taste, but that's personal preference.  However, it was still good and perfectly moist.  He's forcing me to make it again for him some time, and normally he hates when you introduce new dinners to his tiny catalogue of meals.

Good recipe.  Spiced it up a bit using some italian seasoning.  Also did like others and browned the coated chicken in butter.  Served over pasta which was a nice presentation.

This turned out very well. I don't think I would prefer it with seasoned bread crumbs because I used a nice quality of pasta sauce that was seasoned well. I had no problems with the breadcrumbs sticking to the chicken. I baked them on a baking stone and didn't have a problem with the breading sticking when I removed them. I served it over whole wheat noodles with a side of steamed mixed veggies. My family has begged me to make it again soon.

A yummy easy way to make chicken parm- I usually pan fry and then bake which I think makes the chicken a bit moister but this way was delicious too and probably healthier :)

I thought this was a good recipe. I folled recipe exactly with two exceptions. I pounded the breasts flatter first for even cooking and flavor and I used a little more cheese than called for bc of my family's preferences. Dh said it was 'ok' (but keep in mind he's a picky one lol). I did enjoy it and the kids ate it all up too!

Yummy, this is a great comfort food! Family loved it! I used italian style dry bread crumbs instead, mixed it with flour. I also double dipped (egg, bread crumbs, egg again, then bread crumbs). Then I pan fried it before sticking it in the oven (to help bread crumbs stick). I always wondered how to make it, and now I will make it again and again! Thanx Candy!

I wanted something easy, healthy, and interesting. This was all three plus delicious! Even my uber-picky boyfriend loved it. I served it with a little pasta and a green salad (just like she recommends) and his exact words were "Wow, sweetie, you've really outdone yourself!" This recipe is now in my regular rotation, thanks to Candy!

Good base recipe. It's quite plain, you may want to spice it up with garlic, oregano, basil...

This recipe was good, but I found that the breading did not stick to the chicken very well. I would recommend adding some flour to the breading to help the bread crumbs stick.

I am usually not a big fan of this recipe, but I wanted something different for my husband.  I was pleasantly surprised that this was actually very good.  I would definitely make it again.

This is definitely restaurant quality. I did not have any dry bread crumbs in the pantry, so I made some by toasting 5 pieces in the oven as it preheated for the chicken,then crumbled the toasty bread and added garlic salt, parsley, and some parmesan cheese.
I used Ragu sauce and a bag of "Italian" mix pre-shredded cheese. I served it over angel hair with creamy roasted vegetable soup, and cheesecake mousse with fresh strawberries for dessert.
I am the granddaughter of an Italian chef (from Italy) and this is just as good as his recipe... Thanks Candy! What a lovely entree.

Followed the recipe exactly - but as so many others said - doing it that way did not produce a crispy chicken.  When I make this again will follow other reviewers suggestions by double breading it.  If that fails, I will go back to what I do know works and that is frying the breaded cutlets in oil - which by the way would cut the cooking time of this recipe drastically.  I was trying to be healthy by baking it! Served it with spaghetti & sauce, salad with Italian dressing and garlic bread.

Great meal. I breaded the chicken with a mixture of italian bread crumbs and parmisian cheese. I also seasoned the chicken ahead of time with Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic. (In New Orleans, we season everything first)

This was easy and very good. I used boneless chicken strips instead of the breast halves to
cut down on the cooking time. I also covered my
dish when I returned it to the oven to keep the cheese from burning. I served the chicken over
angel hair pasta, it was a hit!

Not enough sauce for putting on top of pasta, and the breading disintegrates too easily when baking with the sauce.  You would be best off using a fairly runny tomato sauce, and heating it up first to cut down on the final baking time.

This is a great recipe. I pounded my chicken breasts so they were thinner and it makes them very tender.  I was in a hurry however and misread the instructions so I did not cook the chicken for while and then put the sauce on top,I just dunked them in the egg, dredged them with the bread crumbs put them in the pan and put the sauce over them.  I baked them about 35-40 minutes and put the sauce over spaghetti. A nice salad and garlic bread and you have a feast.  I used the traditional Prego sauce that has meat in it, but a good marinara would be just as wonderful. Yummy!!!!!  Thanks, Candy

I have always wanted a chicken parmigiana recipe at home instead of always going out to a resturant, my family and I enjoy this very much and it very easy to make. Thank you Candy for putting this recipe on here for us to use. Tania Z.

This was excellent! My husband made it and used Healthy Choice Garlic Lovers - turned out great!
