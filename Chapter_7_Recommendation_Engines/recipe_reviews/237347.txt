It was delicious. I did do something a bit differently; instead of adding both the meat and potatoes, I just added the meat, because I was afraid that I couldn't get a good browning, which is so key. After the meat was well browned, then I added the potatoes, and continued with the recipe.. It's great for those times when you want a break from your regular meals. Thanks for a great recipe.

The recipe was easy to follow, despite seeming long when I first looked at it. My own issues with getting the rice cooked properly added an unnecessary occasional crunch, but otherwise my family loved this! I kept it very mild for my elementary-aged daughter, and served the hotter condiments on the side for my husband. It worked perfectly for both. The favors melded even better on day 2.
