My kids and husband loved it!!  The only thing I did differently was that I put the pasta in at the beginning, raw, and let it cook until tender.  One less pot!

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I added the pasta uncooked at the beginning of the cooking time and the pasta turned mushy.  It was still great. It is a very Weight Watcher friendly recipe - 3 pts. - and very filling.  I'll make this again and again,my husband loved it!

Very, very good!!!  The only change I made was to skip the turkey sausage.  We had guests over and they loved it as well!

This hearty dish was a favorite at the table.  So colorful, healthy and bursting with flavor. Definitely a keeper!! Freezes well, portioned in usable containers and enjoyed later.

This soup was fantastic.  I followed the recipe, except that I added two sausages.  I used Applegate Farms mild Italian chicken-turkey sausage.  It has a delicious flavor that really made the soup even better - especially the fennel.  Definitely brown it first.  I used all organic veggies and beans (sorry Bush!).  I also used multicolored bowties that my daughter loved.  I actually had pesto at home and tried it on the soup, but it really just doesn't need it.  The soup is delicious as is and the pesto flavor just masks the soup flavor.  Unless you LOVE pesto, I'd skip it.

This is really good and very easy to change up and make it to your liking.  I did not use the meat or pesto and it was a great veggie minestrone.  I'll make it again!

This was not only pretty easy to make, but it was DELICIOUS!!!  My very picky 16  month old actually ate it - and asked for more.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have the pesto to top it with.  I made it with garlic toast for dipping.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty! It is a healthy, hearty, and flavorful. We used provolone and red pepper turkey sausage. It filled my entire crock-pot.

We all loved this! Left out the sausage and it was still great...did add a bit of Italian blend seasoning, more garlic and a dash of cayanne.

This was absolutely delish.  The whole family loved it.  Made no changes to original recipe, but made it a second time with regular Italian sausage.  Probably a little less healthful for you but just as good.

I made this the other night, and it was fabulous.  The only change I made was I used sweet Italian sausage and left out the spinach.  I also added ditalini pasta instead of the bowties, which is more traditional for minestrone.  Awesome recipe, loved it!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  Super easy to make & with little kids, I don't have time to chop up everything & do a ton of dishes so I threw all of it into the crockpot.  I only made a few changes because I wanted to empty out my freezer.  We skipped the pesto & Parmesan completely.  Added a cup of frozen turkey (leftover from Christmas)- cut up into small pieces, chicken would work well too. Instead of zucchini, I just put an entire box of frozen spinach in.  I also chopped up the celery, carrots, garlic, & onion together in a food processor - easy to hide the veggies from the kids that way.  Threw about 2 cups of uncooked bowtie noodles in & cooked on low for 5 hours.  My kids thought it was as good as Olive Garden's minestrone!

Great dish with some substitutions for items I didn't have on hand.  Everything into the slow cooker with no browning 1st.  Turkey legs instead of sausage cooked with all then meat removed from bones; no white beans added; mushrooms added at end of cooking; no pesto added.  A keeper!

Very good minestrone! I used 4 cans of reduced sodium chicken broth, drained/rinsed both cans of beans and used all of the red kidney beans, and used dried basil instead of oregano (I didn't have any oregano on hand). I also left out the spinach, and cooked on high for 3.5-4 hours. Great dinner with some garlic bread! I may add some green beans next time.

I made a vegetarian version of this without the turkey sausage.  I substituted yellow squash for the zucchini because that's what I had and egg noodles for the bowtie pasta because I had some leftover that I needed to use up.  It did not taste like much until I added the cheese.  I did just notice that I was not supposed to drain and rinse the cannellini beans, which may have made a difference in the flavor.  I will make this again with some tweaking.

Very good! I made it vegetarian by leaving out sausage and using vegetable stock instead of chicken. I also used fresh basil instead of the pesto, just my personal preference. My sons really liked the soup and I served it with garlic cheese biscuits from this site

FIVE STARS!! Used prepackaged shredded carrots and omitted the spinach and pesto. Added about 1 cup fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter. Also added 3 slices American cheese to thicken, and aged white cheddar shreds with a handful of feta on top. Kids ate it up, and hubby and son took it for lunch yesterday! I've eaten leftovers for lunch and just now finished the last. Mmmm, this was awesome!

This was so good!  I had to improvise a bit since I did not have everything in the kitchen, but still was outstanding.  I did not have pesto, zucchini or Cannellini beans so I left them out and did not miss them.  I only had pork sausage, which I added close to a 1lb., 1/4 cup does not seem like enough.

This was very good.  My 10 year old said he would like to see it added to the regular dinner rotation.  That is a high compliment from a child that prefers meat and more meat. He did ask that I leave the zuchinni out but it was wonderful in this. I really liked it with the added pesto at the end.  I made it pretty much exactly as stated on the recipe except I did not have tomato paste so I added a about a 1/4 cup of chopped canned tomatoes and then I added the rest along with another can into the soup.  So I guess I almost doubled the amount of tomatoes.

We loved it! I too used a whole pound of ground turkey Italian sausage. Other than not having the spinach, Followed the recipe to a T. Makes a big batch-I froze half the leftovers after we each had 2 bowls! Thanks Bush!!

This is an awesome way to stretch your food until payday. I had a can of Navy beans that I used along with the kidney beans. I also used a Hillshire farms smoked beef sausage which gave this an amazing smokey, hearty depth. I didn't use spinach b/c I didn't have any. But thats the beauty of the soup, it is very versatile! The seasonings were spot-on for my tastes. I used half chicken broth and half beef broth and used seashell pasta instead of bowties. Make this recipe!!

Huge suggestion: don't leave out the sausage. :-) I'm a vegetarian, so I left it out, and I think it affected the entire dish negatively. It lacked a lot of flavor. I still gave 4 stars because otherwise it may have been good.

I made this for me and the kids on Christmas Eve...my house smelled great all day.  The kids not only ate the soup, but were dipping their garlic bread into the broth to get the last bits!

LOVE it!  I've tried it with Pork sausage and Italian flavored ground turkey.  I think the pork sausage was better-more flavor.  Don't need to change a thing unless you want it vegetarian style or more meat.  With more meat (then the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for) we just put a little extra tomatoe paste with the extra meat. A scrumptuous soup!

I love this soup - it's a staple at my house.  I double the recipe and use two crock pots, freezing the soup in individual portions.  I make a couple of changes though.  First, I use ground turkey breast for the meat.  Secondly, I use whole wheat pasta.  And, lastly, I don't add the pasta to the crock pot until the very last minute so it doesn't overcook.  I also increase the veggies some.  I've worked it out so that depending on the number of servings, using "my" revised recipe, it comes out to be 4 or 5 points on Weight Watchers (without the pesto or parmesan).

Absolutely wonderful.  Instead of only 1/4 cup of Turkey sausage I added 1 lb extra lean Hillshire Turkey Kilbasa sliced in chunks.  No Pesto for me either and it was one of the best soups we've had in ages.

This was pretty good, but it seemed like a lot of effort and a long list of ingredients for just being pretty good.  I probably won't make this again.

Fantastic, hearty, healthy soup that's easy to make, and will fill your home with a wonderful aroma all day while cooking. If you do some of the chopping ahead of time, it will make it even easier.
