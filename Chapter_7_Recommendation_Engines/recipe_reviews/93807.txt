Cheers to the party-sized portion!  I had to make this immediately upon seeing the photo today. Used whipping cream from the refrigerated carton (on-hand), and it worked out wonderfully. This is a Restaurant-Style cheesecake for sure, only better. Used fresh, cut up, lightly sweetened strawberries on the side after chilling the cheesecake instead of using the strawberry pie filling.  Wonderful! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was fantastic!! Made it the first time for 40 people & got rave reviews.  I didn't put the cherries on until a couple of hours before serving & my filling set up perfectly (don't know if holding off on the cherries had anything to do with that or not)!!!

Excellent!!!! Oh my gosh was it ever good. We ended up serving it in bowls though as it didn't hold like a normal cheesecake does-don't worry-it's sooooo good you won't care!!!! YUM!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!

Wonderful!! I hate cool-whip, so I substituted a pint of sweetened whipping cream. I also left off the cherry topping. It's a perfect alternatitive to painstakingly baking a cheesecake, especially in the summer.

Made this for a church gathering.  I used shredded coconut in the crust in place of the sugar and also added crushed walnuts.  Excellent.  Very easy to make and has a wonderful presence.  Thanks for posting it.

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. I have been trying to figure out how to replicate a recipe from a restaurant back home for "no-bake" cheesecake and this is almost IDENTICAL to it! I was thrilled w/ the huge portion too! :)  The lemon juice really adds some kick to this cheesecake. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first as I'm a very plain cheesecake lover, but this was amazing.  Next time I will add some crushed raspberries and cool whip to the top. YUMM!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I made the crust for this and found that 2 1/2 cups of graham crackers wasn't near enough. The crust ingredients looked way too greasy and wet, so I used another cup or so of crumbs. I used Splenda in the crust as well. I did bake the crust for 8 minutes to crisp it up a bit and to help melt the sugar so it wouldn't crunch when you ate it. (It only takes once to have that happen, it's not pleasant.) I used low-fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, fresh lemon juice and "free" whipped topping. I found out at the last minute that I didn't have any canned pie filling on hand, so I whipped up my own with frozen berries, Splenda and a couple other ingredients. This was a few steps but the outcome was nice and it's sure to be a real crowd pleaser tonight. NOTE: The recipe dosen't say that you should set out your cream cheese and let it come up to room temperature. If you don't do this, you'll have lumps in your cheesecake and it's a little embarassing to have your friends and family bite into clumps of cream cheese. EDITED REVIEW: Out of that whole pan, only three pieces remained! HUGE hit. HUGE.

This was very good for a no bake cake.  I read some reviews that said the cake did not "set" firm enough.  While I was mixing ingredients, my toddler son distracted me and I left the mixer on.  I mixed it longer than I would have let it had I not been preoccupied.  The mixture set as firm as a regular cheesecake.  I think mixing it more will make the mixture set better

This cheesecake was so easy to make.  Usually cooked cheesecake can be chalky, this recipe is so creamy and delicious.  The lemon juice really sets it apart.  I've made this a few times now and have substituted the cherries with strawberries or raspberries for the topping.

Tastes great, very creamy and rich.  Did not firm enough to serve cut pieces, more of the consitency for perfect use in a trifle or parfait.

To me it did not taste like real cheesecake. No matter how long it was in the refrigerator it would not set up as firm as normal cheesecake is. I am very disappointed :(

Loved it! I halved all ingredients except the cream cheese I used 2 whole blocks and it was so good better than the other no bake that just has sweet cond and cream ches. I will def. make this again. The longer it sits the better it gets. Day 3 and I am tempted to eat all that is left.

Have made this recipe at least 10 times in the past year - my family & friends love it!!!  We alternate topping from non to blueberry to cherry to 1/2 & 1/2 - always a hit!!!  I recommend cutting the cream cheese into chunks for a smoother blend. Great!!!

Cheesecake set up fine, the problem was I could taste the condensed milk, recipie calls for 1 (12 oz) Whip cream.  Containers came in 8oz or 16oz.  I used about 10 so I am not sure if that was the cause, but no one really liked it including myself. So we just tossed it.

Way too sweet, not firm enough. Very heavy lemon flavor.  I can see why it's called 10 pound cheesecake, when you're finished with it, you weigh 10 lbs more... LOL.  Very very rich.

This makes enough filling for 3 pie pans, so with a few more graham cracker crumbs, it is  a great recipe for bake sales or fundraisers. I have also used peanut butter instead of butter for the crust  and added flavors to the filling with instant coffee, peanut butter crust and mocha filling is delightful.

I made this cheesecake for the first time over the Easter weekend, i had 9 of the family here to try this, they all said the cheesecake was the crowning glory! They raved about it and still are!!
I followed it exactly except for the crust, i never add sugar to graham crumbs they don't need it as they are sweet enough on their own. Because i didn't have a pan big enough for it i made 2 separate pans.
On 1 pan i spread my own homemade blueberry topping, and the second i spread it with the supreme strawberry topping from this site, they were the best cheesecakes ever, and i know no baked cheesecake could be any better! It set perfectly everyone was amazed how nicely it cut for being a no bake cheesecake!!
I would like to give some feedback to neighbour who was wondering why her cheese cake didn't set, ican't say for sure why it didn't but do not cut back to 1 can of condensed milk as it will be too sour, i used the full 2 cans and it set perfectly, i would recemmend letting it set longer, i made mine the night before and i served it for supper the following night, so try making it the night before you want to serve it, i hope this helps keep trying because if you stick to the recipe it should set perfectly for you!

For a no-bake, this is pretty darned good. One reviewer suggested baking the crust first, to cut down on the grit/crunch of the sugar. What I did instead was substitute honey for sugar. Worked great.

Very easy, tastes is very good.  I did add a little cinnamon to the graham cracker crumb mixture.  This is great for family gatherings as it makes a huge cheesecake!  Will definitely keep in my recipe box!

I didn't make the connection between the name and how much this would make!  Luckily there was only about 2 pounds leftover.  Only change I might make next time is using 8 ounces of whipped topping, maybe make it a little more solid and actually fit in the 9X13 pan!

This was amazing! Not your typical cheese cake texture but I liked the light fluffy but creamy texture. The flavor was excellent. I was disappointed I only got 2 pieces, I will definitely make this one again. I did make one change because I don't like pie cherries, I cooked up some strawberries with sugar and lemon juice the tartness was a good combo with the sweet taste of this cake!

I halved the recipe and made it in a store bought crust, poured cherry pie filling over each piece as served because it was so full in the pie plate didn't want a mess in the fridge. I used 1 cup of whipping cream whipped with 1 envelope of Whipit for the Cool Whip. Very good and easy when it is hot out but you want dessert. If you beat the mixture longer it will start to set up faster reducing your fridge time.
I have also made a key lime version using key lime juice for the lemon juice and adding the zest of a key lime, skip the cherry pie filling, just serve with whipped cream.

I haven't reviewed a recipe on here unless it was worthy of it.  I am a professional cake decorator, and this recipe is a KEEPER!  If using a stand mixer, buy heavy cream and whip your own cream (make sure to add powdered sugar to it!).  I used 32 oz. of cream cheese (as I buy mine in 3 lb. blocks), but besides that, followed it to a T and it turned out spectacular!!

Very good recipe for a no bake cheesecake, and so easy, too!  I followed the recipe to a "T" except to use fresh strawberries on top in lieu of the cherry filling.  This was very well received at our Memorial Day cookout.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, cookie!

I took this to Bunco and everyone loved it. Best no-bake cheesecake ever. Even had my friend's husband call me and tell me it was good. I did notice that the crust fell apart more than I thought it should, no one else complained but I'm thinking maybe a little more butter next time. The lemon juice made it perfectly tangy...not to sweet!! Loved it!! Also, absolutely no problems with this setting up. I made it the night before I needed it but I did check it after 2 hours and it would of been perfect then too!!!

I decided to make this recipe for my husband who only likes the light, whipped cheesecake (like Sara Lee). I was not making it for a large crowd, so I cut the recipe in half. I did not have graham cracker crumbs on hand so tweaked the recipe slightly. These are the change I made ic case someone else opts to cut the recipe as well.  I used a box of cinnamon graham crackers and crushed then, and added about a cup of melted margarine (went by feel). I pressed that into a 9" springform pan, covering both sides and bottom. I also used 2 boxes of cream cheese, 8 oz each, because I did not want to open a package and use only half. One thing that other reviewers mentioned was the cake not stiffening. I added one envelope of unflavored gelatin to the lemon juice to dissolve it before adding that to the mix. I also used fat free sweetened condensed milk. After being sliced, each person was able to add canned cherries to their liking. Delicious! My entire family loved it!

This came out fabulous..however, I cut the recipe in half, and used a premade graham crust. It filled it to the brim, and then when we sliced it up, we put on the pie filling topping (on the plate). Beautiful results!! Thanks for the recipe!

It's like the jello no bake cheesecake in a box but I think this is better.  I halfed it by looking at the comments b/c I just wanted one normal sized cake and I used a store bought graham crust.  It was exactly the right portion size for the crust and so easy to make. I actually read off the ingredients and let my 12 year old do all the work.

This was my first cheesecake. Super simple and came out perfect. I read many of the reviews which is always a good idea. There were 2 things that I made sure I did. #1 made sure the cream cheese was room temp and #2 added another 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs.
 I did not put my fruit topping on until I served. My favorite is the Blueberry topping which I also found on All Recipes. If you are going to make the blueberry topping make it a day ahead of time. its much better the next day.
 ENJOY!!

This doesnt have the denseness of a cheesecake its more of a consistincy of cool whip. After first i didnt tink it had much flavor but i Changed my mind on this. After eating it for a few days i liked it more and more.
For me to love it i had to make sure i got the crust in with each bite and it made it even better. My brother in law and mother in law both asked for your recipe because they liked it so much

This recipe is great, my favorite is to make the filling and add PEANUT BUTTER, then put it on top of BROWNIES. Another Flavor I've tried is Key Lime (replacing the Lemon Juice). Since it is a no bake recipe it is alot easier to experiment with different flavors.

I made this exactly as the directions said. I used 2 premade Graham cracker pie crusts instead of making my own. It does not hold like a regular cheese cake......but I froze one to use at a later date. Just took it out and let it thaw. It held up VERY well, kept its shape and I think for some reason even tasted better (not such a lemon aftertaste). I will be making this for my family at Easter this year!

This was excellent!!  I forgot to take the Cool Whip out of the freezer so it was partially frozen when I added it to the cream cheese.  It worked out great, I'll probably always do it this way as it made the filling thick immediately.  For those that are having problems with the filling setting up, try this.  Thanks for sharing Cookie!

Very tasty & easy quick cheesecake to make if don't have time to bake one. Used a packet of unflavored gelatin as suggested by other users. Made gelatin as recommended on package and added with lemon juice step. Set up great! Put cherry filling on the side and got rave reviews.

Very good cheesecake.  I made it this morning and it's setting up beautifully and tastes wonderful (licked the mixer beater!) I'll be sharing it with wonderful family tomorrow and I cannot imagine that they won't love it!  Thanks for posting this.  And by the way, I used my big stand mixer and it was easy easy easy to make!

This is my second cheesecake review from a recipe from this site and I think this also deserves a 5 star review...I doubled the recipe to bring a jumbo cheesecake for my niece's baby shower(she invited 50 people), and there was a line up just for this cake...none of the other desserts were touched until this was gone (within minutes)...next time I make a cheesecake, I'll have difficulty deciding which recipe to use...but with 50 people lining up...this recipe will definitely be used again!!  I had made it the weekend before and kept it in the freezer...because it was double in size, it took several hours to thaw...and still held up perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe and making me look good!!

Easy and delicious!  Made it for a 4th of July party today, so instead of cherry pie filling, I made it look like a flag with fresh blueberries and strawberries on top.  Everyone at the party loved it!

LOVED it.  But what is with the lemon juice and why so much?  Before refrigeration, it was SEVERELY strong.  I was nervous.  2 days later when I finally served it, the lemon died down.  It was still strong enough for everyone to question why it was there.  I will FOR SURE make this again but with alot less lemon juice.,

I was hunting an easy cheesecake recipe and hopefully one that would make more than one at a time......this is it!  It is super easy to put together and I used 3 regular graham cracker crusts from the store so it was even quicker and easier!!!  Great recipe, will take to our monthly church potluck next month!!! THANK YOU!!!

This recipe is really great, I followed it exactly. I had no problems with it setting up, and I think it was because I used the Cool Whip.  Some reviewers suggested using whipped cream instead of Cool Whip, I don't think it would be the same result.  It helped it stand up fine for a no bake cheesecake. This is going to be my cheesecake recipe from now on.

This was awesome and very easy. It serves a lot of people. I will add another can of cherries the next time. I did it in a large casserole and think it could have used more cherries! Great for a crowd! Fifi

Delicious!! I made this for Thanksgiving and the entire family loved it! My husband is requesting I make it for his birthday in December! It was so quick and easy to make I was really impressed with the outcome. I was worried it was going to be runny, but it wasn't at all after it set up. I made it the night before Thanksgiving so it had all night and all day the next day to set up in the refrigerator. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy, but very tasty desert! I didn't even have any topper for it either. Just the plain cheesecake. It was great.

DELICIOUS!! i subbed 1/2 c skim milk and 1 regular sized package of cheesecake pudding for 1 of the sweetened condensed milks. for the bottom i used 2 whole packages of graham crackers. then i made individual "cupcake cheesecakes" by placing cupcake papers in a muffin pan, 1 Tbs of graham filling, then a smaller ice cream scoop of cheesecake filling and 3 canned cherries from cherry pie filling on a total of 36 cupcakes. to save on space in the fridge, i pulled them out of the 12 count tin with a fork outside of the paper and lifted it into a 9x13 pan with a cover. it fits 18 with space on the side. then place the remaining graham crumbs in a 9" square, the remaining cheesecake filling over that, spread it out. then for the top, mixed a package of no sugar black cherry jello dissolved with 1 c. boiling water and then mix that with a can of lemon pie filling. spread it over the cheesecake filling. cover and let sit and set in fridge.

Very easy to make.  I rate this five for what it is, a no-bake cheesecake. I do not feel one can compare no-bake to baked.  This is creamy and sweet.  I served a crowd. No one had seconds, but none went to waste. Folks even fought over who would get to take the last few pieces home for breakfast...

This is fine, except I prefer mine a little bit sweeter.  The recipe I use does not use the whipped cream and I prefer it that way - but I know some would prefer it a little less sweet - for you, this should be perfect.

This was delicious and I don't even like cheesecake. The texture is creamier (better!) than your standard cheesecake. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/3 fat neufatel cheese, non-fat sweetened condensed milk, and low-fat cool whip. It definitely did not taste "low fat!" I made it in a 9" spring form pan and served it with sliced strawberries which worked well. Will definitely be making this recipe again and again. Easy and delicious!

Easy to make, delicious, and great for a crowd!  Best of all, though, no baking!!!  A perfect summer recipe.    I've made this exactly like the recipe.  I've also merged this recipe with the Wave Your Flag Cheesecake.  Instead of using the "cheesecake" recipe from the Wave Your Flag, I used this one and decorated it like a flag using strawberries and blueberries.

This has a wonderful flavor! I followed the directions, except I used real whipped cream. I served this at Thanksgiving. It held up great when it first came out of the fridge, but after about 10 minutes, it began to get a little soupy. I'll make it again & see what happens. YUMMY!!

My oven died and I needed to make a dessert to take to a family gathering before I could get it fixed. So while searching for a 'no bake' dessert I came across this cheese cake. I came home with an empty dish! Thanks!

Excellent - just the right amount of lemon juice. The cool whip gives it a fluffy texture rather than the usual density of a baked cheesecake. This is my new favorite no bake.

I thought it was good, but does not compare to a baked cheesecake, which I think is so much better.  This recipe would be good for the holidays because it can serve many and also, if your kitchen is anything like mine during the holidays with the oven always on, you can serve an extra dessert without the oven going constantly.   For an excellent lemon cheesecake, my go to recipe is "Sunsational Cheesecake" from the Philadelphia Cream Cheese cookbook.

I've been using this recipe for the last year and I have to say it's really great! The texture is fluffy but creamy, and it makes enough to feed about 15-20 depending on how you cut it. I've brought this to many family parties and it's always a huge hit. Definitely a make again recipe.

I made half this recipe in a regular pie pan and it was delicious! I didn't add the entire can of sweetened condensed milk or all the lemon juice because people said they had trouble with it setting. I would say I added 90% of each. We used cherry topping and also caramel topping, both were really good!

BEST no-bake cheesecake ever!  I whipped up real whipped cream and sweetened it myself before adding to the recipe. This recipe works best in mini pie tins with the graham cracker crust already baked in. When I ran out of those, I put graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of ramekins and filled those up with cheesecake and the topping. Just as good. GREAT recipe but not firm enough for a standard-sized pie. Go mini...this one is worth it.

Really great flavor and texture.  My husband loved it.  The only problem I had was that the graham crust didn't hold together and pretty much stayed in the pan when I served the desert.

If you like this less creamy allow it to sit in the fridge 24 hours.  I prefer a heavy cheesecake however, this was easy to make and the entire family really enjoyed.  I cut the ingredients in half for one 9 inch premade graham cracker crust.

I have made this for 4 events between Thanksgiving and Christmas and had raves each time. When I make this recipe I use a 9X13X2 cake pan and the recipe fills it completely. Since I have made it so frequently the changes to the recipe that we prefer are: Use 1/4 cup Splenda or sugar in the crust instead of 1 cup.   Also, I use sliced fresh berries because the cheese filling is sweet enough without the added sweetness of the pie filling.

For a DULCE DE LECHE flavor, either boil the two cans of sweetened condensed milk (fully submerged by at least 3 inches of water) for about 2.5-3 hours, or buy already prepared dulce de leche, and proceed with the recipe as written (without cherry pie filling).  DELICIOUS.  And still works the same as uncooked sweetened condensed milk.

Followed this recipe to the letter...with the exception of the crust..did an oreo cookie base with butter...set well.  HOWEVER...I thought while making this that there was one too many sweetened condensed milk in it(?)  I still added what the recipe called for (2).  
I made it at 11:30 am. and refridgerated it. I didn't put the raspberry pie filling on top until 4 pm.  
When I went to serve it at 6 pm I took it out of the spring form pan and it wasn't set yet...only partially set.  It tasted wonderful, and my guests thought it was GREAT, however I was upset that it cut so poorly...it was the consistancy of sour cream.
I wonder WHAT I did wrong?  Any guesses? 
 Feedback?

I may try it again one day with only one can of sweetened condensed milk.

This is a fantastic recipe! It was very easy to make. I made it the night before and let it set up over night and it was not runny at all. I did wait to put my topping on until  right before serving it. I used 1 cup of butter for the crust because 1/2 cup did not seem to be enough to bind the breadcrumbs together. The best thing about this recipe besides how delicious and how easy it is, is the fact that it makes so much! This recipe is a definate keeper!!

Love this recipe! The filling sets nicely and is creamy and delicious. I've made this many times, and it makes a LOT of cheesecake. Another thing about it that's cool is that you can do mini cheesecakes in cupcake pans with an Oreo or other cookie for the crust--the cookie gets nice and soft overnight, delicious and easy! Very adaptable recipe if you just want to serve it in bowls or fancy glasses too. Every time I've made this it is gone, baby gone!

How can you go wrong with a recipe called 10 pound cheesecake? Wonderful flavor and all around delicious tasting cheesecake. I love anything with sweetened condensed milk as a key ingredient.

I made two of these for my husband to take to one of his potlucks where he works, and ever since then, i am not allowed to make anything else! The guys always ask him if he signed up for a desert and if I was going to make this cheesecake.

I did alter it slightly, well not alter just made it to my husband's liking, I added a 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to it, then I swirl chocolate on the top....so basically it tastes like a recess. other than that I have to say, I just live this no bake cheesecake it's very versitile to adapt it to someone's favorite 'anything' is very easy!

love it, live it!

This recipe is exactly the same as the recipe that I've been making for years with the exception of the cool whip. I liked that addition!  It lightens the dessert up and mellows the lemon. Instead of making my own crust,  I used three extra serving pre-made crusts. This will be my go to no bake cheesecake recipe from now on.
