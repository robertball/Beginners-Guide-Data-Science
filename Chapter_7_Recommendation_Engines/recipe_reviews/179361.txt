The first time I made this recipe I would have rated it only with one star. It ended up tasting just like Bisquick. But, I tried it a second time replacing the Bisquick with Italian seasoned bread crumbs and viola...there it was...a great tasting homemade chicken fingers dish. I omitted the salt, and added garlic powder and the paprika to my already seasoned bread crumbs. The kids loved them and I will definitely be making these again with my alterations.

This recipe is super easy and super tasty.  I follow the recipe exactly and always serve with homemade Honey Mustard.  1/4 cup mayo, 1 tblsp Yellow Mustard, 1 tblsp Honey and 1/2 tblsp lemon juice.  I got the recipe off this site.  I also always make them on my rectangular baking stone without foil.  There is no problem with sticking this way.

These were great!  Quick to make and the family loved them.  I used Garlic Salt rather than regular and also used the butter as directed.  They had great flavor and I was pleased with how the breading turned out.  Let's be honest - they're not deep fried, so you're not going to get that thick, hard crunchy breading.  But this was a very close oven baked copy.  We'll be making these again.

I had these ingredients on hand and thought I'd try it.  So glad I did.  Crispy, delicious coating!  Family enjoyed it very much.  I love chicken fingers when I go out to eat.  Now I think these are better than the deep-fried versions in restaurants.  My tip would be to put only 3 strips at a time in the bag when coating.  Add more garlic powder if you enjoy the flavor of garlic.  Onion powder would probably be great too in addition to the garlic powder.

Tastes great, easy and fast to make.  I had to increase cook time to 20 minutes, they were cooked but not dry.  I think if you try to flip the chicken too soon, that might cause the breading to fall off or stick to the pan.  But if you use foil and spray, and wait about 10 minutes before turning, I think the breading stays on better that way.

I did everything according to recipe, but I did not care for the way it turned out. Tasted more like bisquik thank chicken fingers. I would definately not reccommend this to anyone looking for a crunchy restaraunt chicken finger recipe.

The chicken fingers were easy and tasty. I didn't have a large ziploc bag so I just used a bowl instead. Also, when you flip these chicken fingers half-way through baking, they tend to stick to the tin foil. That was the only negative.

Embarrassingly easy!! I had two very large chicken breasts that I pounded down so the would cook faster. Turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make these again.

Followed the recipe except used olive oil instead of the margarine. Tasty and less fattening than the traditional. Would make again.

Yes tweaking this was no big deal, used all our eggs to go into our Salad so they were out of the equation, however they were marinated in Kens Balsamic Vinaigrette Salad Dressing for approximately 6 hours, then used the Bisquick, Parmesan, Garlic Salt, Smoked Paprika and coated the Fingers in a Gallon zip lock and pre-heated my oven to a whopping 400° and punched em out in 16 minutes and temped out at 170°...

My husband and I think these are great.  They are ready super fast and are super easy to make.  I make a large tossed salad and serve them along side with Honey Mustard.  Since we like ours "kicked up a notch" I either add cayanne or Cajun Seasoning.  1/2 to 1 t.

Just searched oven baked chicken tonight for a different recipe and found this! Followed it exactly and it was so yummy! Everyone loved it! It had a great golden brown to it like it was fried and the meat was juicy. All around a great dinner! Saving in my recipe box.

I make this quite a bit. Super easy! I usually don't drizzle the butter over the chicken though- works fine. They can be a little sticky on the foil- but I use my tongs to genly shake them free. This totally quenches the craving for friend chicken for me.

Followed the instructions exactly, and although they tasted good, the breading did stick to my stone pan pretty significantly, leaving the chicken "naked" on one side.

These were very simple to make and very tasty!!  They were a hit with the kids and didn't even need dipping sauce. If you're a  parmesan fan you'll love them. I think I'll try them with marinara as dipping sauce next time as a twist to  chicken parmesan!!

This was good with some additions. Extra seasoning, bread crumbs instead of Bisquick mix based on other reviews and deep fried. Would make again my way.

This is a keeper!  Followed the directions and had no problems with soggy chicken or sticking.  I did however, add 1 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash's Chicken Seasoning along with other dry ingredients.  Felt that recipe as written "might" be a little tasteless.  My family loved this!!

Substituted Panko for Bisquick and added some cayenne and they were great - crunchy outside and tender inside. Just tossed chicken in Panko mix in a bowl and then used non-stick foil instead of spraying regular foil.

Excellent flavor and the chicken was very tender.  We put the strips on buns with ranch and buffalo sauce...yum yum.  They were a little "soggy" with butter, but I am from the dairy state...no amount of butter is too much (as I'm sure Paula Deen would agree!).

We enjoyed the preparation with our girls but the end result was not so enjoyable. They didn’t seem to be quite done after 15 minutes and the taste was bland (bisquik). Eventually we added salt and barbeque sauce and baked a little longer.

This was very good.  I would suggest using the finely grated parmesan, the type which comes in the tall shaker.   I used freshly grated hard parmesan and found it separated from the Bisquick mixture.   So I then sprinkled it on top of the chicken pieces.   Also, I'd suggest using a little more melted butter/margarine to coat more thoroughly.   
All that aside, they cooked up evenly and had and were delicious! I will make this again!

The chicken fingers turned out great,but I did make a couple of substitutions and they worked just fine. I didn't have any Bisquick so I used buttermilk pancake mix and I used 1T. butter and 2T olive oil. I did use my meat thermometer to be sure the chicken was at 165 degrees. I will make these again.

Used Italian breadcrumbs instead of Bisquick. Added the salt as directed. Plus 1/2 tsp garlic. Finally I found the recipe I was looking for!!

Most tender chicken ever! I used garlic powder, rather than garlic salt, and added onion powder. I used less melted butter. I think any hard, Parmesan-like cheese might work - I've mixed in Grana Padano for a stronger taste. Use fresh cheese that you grate yourself! Also, lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper - flipped over beautifully, no breading fell off.  And, yes use the honey mustard sauce recipe that another reviewer provided - excellent! The first couple of times I prepared the chicken fingers, I tossed everything together in a bag, as directed. That way never seemed to coat them quite right. Now make them the traditional way - dip chicken in egg, dredge with Bisquick mixture, & place on pan. I bake & eat one whole chicken breast by myself, & call it a total dinner - not very balanced, but super comfort food!

For the breading, I doubled the ingredients and I also used two eggs instead of one. Cooked for about 25 minutes. A good substitute for bisquick would be panko!

This was a good recipe. The chicken did not get crunchy but the flavor was good. Since I don't use bisquick I went with dread crumbs. Will make again. Oh, I also used someone else's suggestion and made a honey mustard dip (1/4 C mayo, 1 Tblsp yellow mustard, 1/2 Tblsp lemon juice, 1 Tblsp honey.) Yummy!!

Very good! Made with exact ingredients. I recommend using bowls for the egg mixture and the dry ingredients. This allows you to coat it better and not get too much egg mixture mixed into the dry. I don't agree with the other reviews that say it's too bland, it tasted just like the usual chicken strips found in a restaurant. You could add spices with heat if you prefer those flavors. This is a great basic recipe. I also made the homemade honey mustard recipe found in one of the reviews; it goes really well together!

This is a good everyday recipe for a family. I made it gluten free by using GF Bisquick mix. I also didn't over coat the chicken in the mix. I would make it again but cut down on the butter as it kept the chicken too moist and it didn't want to brown.

We really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again. I did add some Italian seasons but otherwise made it as instructed. Made enough for the freezer and can't wait to heat a few quickly in the microwave as a snack or lite lunch.

This is exactly how I make them and then have homemade honey mustard along side.  The only  difference is I put  them on  a warming rack on top of a large flat pan and oven-fry them that way.  They don't take as long and don't stick to the pan.

Very good recipe, easy to make. Only thing I would change is not adding any salt because there is salt already in Bisquick, and my wife and I found it to be a tad too much salt with the additional call of salt. Otherwise, very tasty!

My son likes these better than any fast-food or restaurant chicken fingers or nuggets, and asks me to make them anytime he knows there's chicken in the fridge.  And the rest of the family likes them too! The last few times I've made them nugget-shaped.

This recipe was so good and we doubled it because we have a big family! It was a snap to make and the kids thought they tasted better than McDonald's strips! We used the garlic salt instead of regular salt. It brought our the flavor so much more! Thank you so much for sharing.
