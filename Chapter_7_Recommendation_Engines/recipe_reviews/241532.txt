I made this as directed once and it was a little bland. The next time I added 3 tbsp minced onions, 1 tbsp diced garlic, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and I increases the broth to 1 cup. It was so good I added it to our rotation. I also made it with smoked chicken sausage to make it that much healthier. I have a developmentally disabled daughter who won't eat vegetables. Once she tried it, she clean the plate and wanted more!

Easy to make meal in one pot. I left out the pine nuts and broth,  used a can of tomatoes (with juice) instead of cherry tomatoes, and used fresh green beans because I didn't have zucchini. Cooked green beans in the tomatoes and juice. Everyone liked it. I will try it with the zucchini next time.

I made this, but used artichoke hearts instead of zucchini, and added fresh garlic (4 cloves minced), red pepper flakes, and definitely mushed some of the beans to thicken the sauce.  I also used 1 cup of vegetable broth. Came out delicious!

I am too much of a novice to roast pine nuts so I roasted sunflower seeds. 
 Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious and the presentation was terrific.   I might try to make it with spaghetti just because it was so light and flavorful maybe it would like being married to spaghetti.

I made this as one of my soups for dropping calories.  Varied by adding more broth but had no squash.  The sausage I used was from the Salt Lick smoke house in Texas.  It was so good it'd make your tongue slap your gums to death!

I did like this!  I thought it was quite good.  Based on what I had available I did some different things but in general it was the same.
I used chicken sausage vs. pork.
I used crushed tomatoes vs. cherry
I added onions and garlic
Between the Spinach, whole wheat pasta and beans, there is a lot of fiber in this meal so it is quite filling. I think I was still full the next morning!

This is really good.  I did not have zucchini or fresh cherry tomatoes but I used (some) canned tomatoes.

Great simple fairly healthy dish.  Made it pretty much as is but added 1 cup of vegetable broth VS 1/2 cup.  thanks for the idea.

This is a great, hearty recipe. I did make a few additions to make it even better. I added sundried tomatoes, a couple dashes of pepper flakes and I doubled the vegetable broth for more of a sauce. Delish!

This was a tasty meal - slightly boring but will make again for sure. It takes longer than the time the recipe says though and dirties up a ton of dishes.

I made this and it was quick and easy on the stove top so it didn't require heating up the kitchen too much. I used black beans instead of white. Tasted great!

I left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any and I honestly could have done without the tomatoes. I had to substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth. I'm giving it 3 stars based on how I made it, not necessarily the way it was supposed to turn out.
