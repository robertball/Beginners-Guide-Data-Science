Quick, easy and yummy.  The batter is thick but once I  figured out how to sort of 'glob' it on and spread it worked well!

This was a good way to use up some of the unsatisfactory fruit on sale this Spring.  My strawberries were red and hard, not ripe, and for the rhubarb I supstituted an equal amount of sour imported seedless grapes, cut in half.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as printed and was very satisfied with the results.

This was...as depicted in the picture, very dense. I did not care for it at all. I was looking for a recipe for a cake to put over fruit but this had more of the consistency of a pudding..especially after some time spent in the fridge. Next time i'll just make a plain ol' white cake.
