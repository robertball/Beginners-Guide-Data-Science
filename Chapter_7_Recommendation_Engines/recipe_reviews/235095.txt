First, do yourself a favor and cook these at 425.  I baked an extra 15 minutes trying to crisp up the bacon at 375 and, finally, just turned up the temperature.  In the future, I will halve the bacon strip instead of cutting into thirds.  On some, the bacon barely wrapped around, and when cooked they came apart, so I think a larger piece of bacon will work better (at least for me).  As far as flavor, they were absolutely delicious.  The dressing I used was Ken’s Steak House Lite Asian Sesame with Ginger & Soy, and it worked well with the pineapple and bacon.  It worked so well that I ended up pouring some into small dishes, to use as a dipping sauce.  Don’t skip the water chestnuts, that little bit of crunch adds some texture and interest.  You can prep these early in the day, bake later, and serve a nice warm appetizer with minimal effort.  I served these to a group of six people, and each and every person gave it a thumbs up.  I’m giving it a 4-star rating only because I believe the oven temperature is off.  Barbara, thanks for sharing this easy appetizer which has nice presentation.

YUMMY!  Big hit at guys ice fishin' weekend!  I agree with the 1st reviewer that an oven at 425 worked well.  I like my bacon crispy, so it seemed the higher temp worked better.  I baked these on a cookie cooling rack, which allowed the grease to drain and make it easy to flip them over, since there was very little surface area to stick on. I used the Sesame dressing because I had it on hand, but it would have been fine without it too.  The pineapple was a nice easy addition that got a lot of compliments.

These are not just for appetizers and snacks. The 2 of us had them for dinner, no left overs. I fixed some rice with teriyaki sauce and chicken broth to go with them. Like others I also cooked mine at 425 because that's the same temp I cook bacon in the oven. An important rick to choosing pineapple is make sure it's a nice orange color. Green pineapples are far from ripe and like a green tomato may turn color after being picked but the ripening and flavor development process stops at that point. If I made these for a gathering I would definitely double the recipe.

Although this received a lot of compliments at the NYE party, I'd be hesitant to make it again. This recipe claims to be quick but it isn't. The prep time was easily doubled between cutting the fresh pineapple and wrapping greasy bacon around slippery pineapple. The cook time increased from 20 to 35 minutes with the time it took to flip and baste them and 5 extra minutes in the oven. The bacon never browned which was a huge disappointment even after I increased the oven temp to 400 for the last 20 minutes. If I were to try this again, I would increase the temp to 425.

These flavors together is magical.  Agree that 425° is better. I think I'll use the grill next time for more even crispness. I took them to a party and people were freaking out how good they were. I added a light sprinkle of sesame seeds.  I may have eaten 4 before I got there.

Definitely need to cook these at 425, and I had to cook them about 12 minutes after I added the sauce to make sure the bacon was cooked and crispy.    I also cut the bacon in half, not thirds.     They are yummy and were a big hit!  Will definitely make again.  :)

These were excellent!  Based on reviews, I made half with an added slice of jalapeno and half as the recipe stated.  I also cooked at 425 due to comments about the bacon not cooking quickly.  I used 1/3 a slice of bacon for each piece, but I had a problem with some of them coming apart.  I think the bacon may have come apart where it was very fatty.  At any rate, this was a hit and they were all eaten quickly!  I bought pre-cut pineapple (fresh but cut by the store) to save time.  One suggestion I would make is to make sure the pineapple pieces are small enough to cover with the water chestnut and wrap in bacon.  Some of my chunks were perhaps a little too large and I stretched the bacon.  I think next time I will try with turkey bacon, but I will definitely make them again.

Just yum!  Def could bake hotter, took forever to get bacon crisp (my bad for using thick cut bacon).  I forgot the dressing and they were still yummy!  Remembered the pour on dressing 2nd batch, even better.

Awesome.  Family loved them.  I used the prebaked bacon and these took about 7 minutes and were perfect.

I LOVED THIS. Actually - EVERYONE loved this. I was excited about adding the pineapple chunk to my old standby appetizer.  I used whole chestnuts though,  and only cut may bacon slices in half....the sesame dressing made the  perfect combination of flavors. Im hungry just thinking about them now.

These were a hit but I definitely had to crank up the oven to brown the bacon. I added a slice of jalapeno to each bundle and it added a nice kick. I would make these again.

I’m rating a 5...not because I’ve made it but I’ve made many and I liked the idea of adding pineapple. I used whole chestnuts and cut 8 wedges out of pineapple slices. In the past I put into crock pot on low in sauce of choice. Was ketchup, brown sugar, and hot sauce. Now adding separate batch in chili sesame ginger. Looking forward to outstanding appetizers

Two observations:  Mine are in the oven, all basted... Seeing how these are present, one inch pineapple cubes seem too big to be a one bite food.  So next time I'll go with smaller cubes, like the ones in the pineapple chunk cans. Those are more like 3/4 inch.  Second, Do use the think cut bacon.  I used the regular bacon, cut in half as others recommended, cooked at 425, and the bacon is coming loose on many of the pieces.  Based on the ingredients I am sure these will be very tasty, but probably messy.

Delicious. A little tricky to wrap, ended up cutting bacon just in half not thirds and worked out better.

I cut the bacon strips in half as per some of the reviews, I think next time I will cut it in thirds. I used canned pineapple tidbits that were too small and ended up having to put 2 tidbits on the chestnuts. Didn't have any sesame-ginger dressing and used balsamic vinaigrette with a sprinkle of dried ginger spice. Cooked it at 425. Pretty good .

Bacon doesn't crisp. We were not impressed. If a 425 oven is needed (which I think it is because no one likes soggy bacon), the recipe needs to say this.

Love this recipe! It was a hit with our guests and delicious. Next time I'll cut the bacon in half instead since my pineapple pieces were a little bigger. I'll bake it at a higher temperature too so the bacon will crisp up more. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

It was really good but it was hard to crisp the bacon.  I wound up using skewers but it took a lot more time.

I increased the temp to 425 as others suggested, but I made one mistake. I used thin sliced bacon thinking they would crisp up faster, but some of them fell apart! One reviewer said the bacon was too short cut in thirds. You can stretch the bacon slightly and it wraps perfectly! Great appetizer or finger food for a party.
