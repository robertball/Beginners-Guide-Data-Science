This is loafie who submitted the recipe. You can add 1 more TBSP of cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker.  This recipe is a lower fat version - I use skim milk and low fat butter. If you want to make it fancier (but more fattening) you can use cream or whole milk. With the onion, you can always use the minced dried kind to make things go faster and to make it less lumpy. Thanks bd.weld :)

I didn't end up using all the pasta since we like ours to be on the very saucy side, so used probably about 3/4 of the amount I cooked. Wouldn't change a thing - the sauce was creamy, bright, and fresh with the lemon. I cooked up some diced chicken in olive oil with salt and pepper, then removed that from the pan and followed the directions as written. My whole family enjoyed this, and I would definitely use this one again. The only thing I might change is to add some diced steamed broccoli, asparagus, or peas to the mixture to make it a complete one-pan-meal. :)

Don't let the long list of ingredients and instructions fool you. This is easy to make and the sauce puts it over the top. Don't panic if the sauce looks lumpy - it's the onions. This one goes into my 'Keeper' folder, thank you loafie.

Delicious!  I served it over Zoodles (zucchini made into noodles with a kitchen gadget), which didn't absorb the sauce as much as pasta noodles would, so it was a bit saucy.  But hey who doesn't like a yummy sauce!  Will make again!

This was 4 stars the day I made it but 5 stars the next day.  I'll double the lemon next time but otherwise this recipe is a spot-on winner. Serve with salads or broccoli to pour the sauce over that first night! Thanks for sharing!

SO DELICIOUS!!! The only things I did different were: 1) couldn't find lemon zest at HEB, substituted lemon extract and 2) grilled the chicken in butter and lemon pepper before adding to mixture. FIVE STARS THOUGH!!!

I change the recipe for two person added 7 shrimp cut on it side,slice mushrooms and muligrain spaghetti and didn't add the lemon zest. Once it was all together i let it sit for 15 minutes. To long i found it dried up. Over all it was not to bad.

This was pretty good, but not the best ever. It felt like more work than I could taste, and I still found the sauce to be a bit bland. Everyone eating seemed to like it fine, but next time I try it I may need to add some more flavor.

So delicious! The lemon zest made it tangy which was nice and it turned out perfect. I didn't need to change anything about the recipe.

Only thing I changed was I cut the lemon juice in half. I also seasoned my own chicken breast. Awesome. Will be keeping this one for sure!!!
Served on Catelli Lemon Pepper Linguine.

Have made this twice now. Family favorite and I have 5 picky kids! Last time I was in a pinch for time so I made the sauce and noodles then threw some frozen breaded chicken tender in the oven.   Definitely recommend.

The whole family loved it, a version of fettuccini alfredo. Used cream and milk instead of milk and water, and not as much lemon as the recipe called for. Delish.

Used dried parsley and fresh lemon juice. Looks really soupy when you initially combine the chicken mixture with the pasta but it quickly thickens up. Hubs and the youngest went back for THIRDS and had NO leftovers-so yes, it went over well! Also, I did not add the salt, didn’t really miss it.

Turned out amazingly!! Sauce was a huge hit- loved how bright the flavour was. For chicken I flattened chicken breasts to 1/4” or so, brushed both sides with olive oil, seasoned both sides generously with italian seasoning, some garlic powder, salt and pepper. Baked at 425 for 4 mins, flipped 4 more minutes checked temp and left in for 2 more mins.  Rest and slice up.

If you’re expecting a lemony pasta, you’re going to have to double the lemon. The amount of lemon in this is just enough to give this a bright finish, but not a very lemony flavor.

I could eat the sauce with a spoon. I love fresh lemon, so I added a little more. It seemed a tad too lemony right after I made it. After allowing all of the flavors to soak in, the next day it was perfect.

It’s delicious, but maybe just a touch too lemony. Might have to change that up a bit for the next time I make it. It also makes A LOT. I mean, when they say it serves eight, it definitely will serve eight, and then some. Added a walnut raspberry salad to pair with it.

Made as written. Flavours were amazing! It was a hit with everyone. A definite keeper. Seems like a lot of ingredients and time needed, but it really isn’t. Delish.

Was a big hit with my wife and rest of family. Since it was the 1st time to make it, no changes except had to use angel hair pasta & ran out of corn starch so sub'd in some flour/water mix. I can't think of any changes or additions to do with this, was good "as is"! A request to make this more often!

This was awesome. I halved the recipe, used less butter and 1% milk. I didn't have parsley so I used fresh basil. I also added red pepper flakes for a little kick! I will definitely make again.

I thought this was a great recipe..   My husband and I both loved it and I will definitely make it again.     He had the leftovers the next night - I just put the pasta in a skillet on day 2,  added a small amt of skim milk and heated up.. perfect.  I followed the recipe to the T.. with one exception - I didn't have a real lemon (used lemon juice) and used a half teaspoon of lemon peel.    That's it!  Nice change to the rotation!

I didn't like it.  It tastes wierd to me.  The chopped onions really stood out to me more than the lemon and the chicken.  Another thing I don't like is the thin consistensy of the sauce.  I let it simmer and thicken but I it didn't get thick enough. I'm not making it again.

This was very easy and really good but also fairly healthy because it uses milk instead of cream.  I made the recipe exactly as written but I added spinach and mushrooms because I had some that needed to get used.  My husband and 2 yr old daughter both loved it so I will definitely be making it again!

I made this last night simply because I had the ingredients on hand so I didn't have to go to the store. In the end I ended up feeding 11 people last night and 5 where teenage girls after practice. Hands down everyone loved it. Great flavor. Great consistency. Great recipe. We will make this again.

I had to start with uncooked chicken breast, which I cut into 1 inch cubes and sauteed with fresh pressed garlic in olive oil. I remove cooked chicken from saute pan and proceeded with recipe directions using the same saute pan. I did add extra corn starch. My twelve year old Alfredo addict loved it : )

Entirely too lemony. I tasted the sauce before I added the lemon and it was very good. Maybe just a squeeze of lemon or don't add it at all. Otherwise, it would've been great.

Whole family liked this - very light sauce, not a heavy cream sauce.  Recipe isn't like the picture though.  It has the chicken cut up in the linguini.  I'm sure you could make it either way.  Cut up chicken serves a crowd more easily.

Wondering why there is so much water added to the sauce?  Is 1 cup water normal for a sauce recipe?

This was OK but very similar to an Alfredo sauce.  Not especially new or original.

Made this for supper last night and was a little leery at using milk and water, but was very surprised. Very tasty without the heavy cream, but I did have to use a bit more corn starch to thicken it. Will make this again for sure, next time I will try it on company.
