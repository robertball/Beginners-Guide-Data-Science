This is a great healthy muffin recipe. I made a couple of changes... Nothing major. I just used whole wheat flour, and Splenda instead of sugar. With the Splenda change, I calculated it, and each mini-muffin is about 35 calories. Amazing, right? I also used a different blend of spices (1 Tbsp Cinnamon, 1 tsp Nutmeg, 1/2 tsp Cloves, no allspice or ginger), just because that's how I like it. Aside from being healthy, they taste great too. I probably should have halved the recipe because I might try to eat all 48 muffins in one sitting.

while it looks and sounds delicious, i would hardly call a recipe with only white flour "virtuous". try half wheat flour, or a whole wheat pastry flour (ghram flour) for a healthier result. If you like lover sugar, try a half sugar half sweetener brand, otherwise you can cut the sugar to 1 c or even 3/4 cup and retain the sweetness. maybe you could even taste the pumpkin then.

These are delicious muffins!  They are also very addictive.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  They are going to be my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner with the family this year.  I plan on topping some of them with vanilla icing and sprinkling them with chopped walnuts.  This is a great recipe that will sure to be a hit with the entire family!  Thank you so much for sharing it.  Excellent recipe!

I cut this recipe in half. I used whole wheat white flour, buttermilk, my own organic pumpkin mash and quadrupled the spices. At the last minute, I threw in half a bag of butterscotch chips that I needed to use. These turned out really well, though I wish there'd been more of a pumpkin flavor. If I make these again, I'll use all pumpkin and eliminate the applesauce. I'm glad I added more spice, they'd have been bland if I hadn't. NOTE: To help with a more fluffy muffin and to eliminate the "rubbery" texture, wisk together your dry ingredients together and the wet ingredients together and gently fold the wet into the dry taking care not to overmix. The more you mix, the more tough your muffin will be.

The texture of these was odd, kind of rubbery.  Definitely will not make these again.

These are excellent! I'm making my second batch. Stay very moist, flavor even gets better the next day. Added mini-chocolate chips to some of them for my kids!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe! I was trying to be extra healthy, so I decreased the sugar to just under a cup and used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour. I also adjusted the spices to fit my taste and lowered the salt to 1/2 tsp. The consistency is PERFECT and the bake time is right on (be sure you are baking them in mini-muffin tins). Thanks for a GREAT recipe. This one is going in my binder. :)

Great taste and amazing moist fluffy texture for a low-fat recipe, but cut the salt way down! I reduced the salt to 1 Tsp and used low-fat buttermilk in place of regular milk. I will make these again, but with only 3/4 tsp salt and the more traditional pumpkin-pie ratio of spices.  Mine also took longer to bake than the recipe states.

The original title to this recipe was Kim's VIRTUALLY FAT FREE Mini Pumpkin Muffins.  The publisher must have thought that was too long and shortened it.  As with all of my recipes, they lend themselves well to alterations to suit your taste preferences, ingredient availability, and nutritional needs.  Enjoy!

Great flavor! Mine came out really dense like they were underbaked even though I cooked them almost 30 min? I did use splenda instead of sugar(the stuff for baking, not the packets)I don't know if that would affect this recipe.

Toddler helped me make these this morning.  Good flavor.  We added about a cup of mini-chocolate chips and substituted one off the eggs with flaxseed.  Our mini muffins baked in 10 minutes and regular size muffins baked in 15 minutes.  Tastey and fairly healthy!

I followed the recipe and found these to be very dense and rubbery.  There also wasn't much flavor.  If I did try these again, I would increase the spices and bake them longer as we also had some of them that were still dough at the top under the outer browned skin.  I did test with a toothpick and the ones I tested must have been a little smaller and were done.  Not at all impressed with this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. The texture is strange. Another reviewer described them as rubbery and that's a pretty good description. The flavor is a little "off". I could excuse that and make some adjustments to the spices if it was a good base recipe but it just isn't.

Taste is ok but the texture is rubbery and chewy . Will not make them again.  I made these for my 3 year olds preschool snack and tossed them, I was concerned the kids would choke on them if they didn't chew them thoroughly.
