DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  We had these with coleslaw on the side- I had dill pickles on mine and my mom had horseradish sauce on hers and they were both outrageously good! The possibilities for condiments seem to be limitless- although these sandwiches need nothing else to be awesome. These are great- so easy and HUGE results! (I used a thick cut ham steak instead of a whole ham because there were only two of us for dinner last night.) We're having a birthday party here next weekend and I'm going to make a big pot of these for our guest- this recipe is TOO GOOD to keep to ourselves!  Thank you so much for sharing this! UPDATE 1/15/07 I used this recipe 3 times over the holidays for my 'holiday ham' and it was a SMASHING SUCCESS!!!!!!  I don't think I'll ever do ham any other way ever again!  We even had a repair man here one night who wanted to stay for dinner because it smelled so good!

My husband loved this.  I only bought a 5 pound ham and scaled back quite a bit on the brown sugar to about 4 oz. hubby don't like real sweet meats. I also added an onion due to his preference.  Served it on Kaiser rolls with potato salad and fresh cut up veggies.  He loved it.  Took another reviewers suggestion and froze leftovers for hubbys sandwiches for work.  Thanks so much for the post.

This is a hit with a busy household that has teenagers coming and going at all hours. I bought those trays of rolls that are in a metal pan, I placed the ham in all of the rolls, placed the rolls back on the pan, tied the plastic cover back up and placed them in the fridge. The kids just help themselves, sometimes eating them cold, sometimes heating them up in the microwave for 15 seconds. They don't care for a bunch of condiments so this recipe works out great! Thanks :-)

This was easy to make and very tasty. I had spicy mustard on hand so that's what I used. My husband did feel it needed something else so he added some dill pickle slices to his sandwiches and declared it perfect.
I make up lunches ahead of time for my husband and freeze them. This is a perfect recipe for that purpose. It's also great for those days when you have family in and out all day.
Try this one...you'll like it!

This was pretty tasty!  Although, I wasn't feeding a crowd and didn't have all day to cook it so I had to make some adjustments.  Since it was just for 2 of us, I used a 1 lb. ham slice.  We just added brown sugar and mustard to a skillet and cooked over medium-high for about 20 minutes.  Very tangy and easy.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  It goes great with baked beans on the side.  And my husband who almost never has a comment about what he's eating said, "This is really good!", and had a second helping.  It's got a subtle sweet & tangy taste to it and it's perfect for after holiday left over hams.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a really different and delicious way to make ham!  We made it for our casual Easter today and it was perfect.  Based on other reviews, I decreased the amount of brown sugar by about half and the "mustard barbeque sauce" was still perfectly sweet.  I did not discard the ham broth after preparing the ham ... it will make a great soup base later!!!  It looked/smelled heavenly.

This is such an awesome recipe!  It takes awhile to cook but of course that is why it is a slow cooker recipe:)  Once it is done it is very simple to make and fast once the ham is cooked.  It tastes so good and has been a real big hit with our family and extended family.  This recipe has become a regular recipe for us and is great for anytime.  It makes a lot so you can eat it for several days or take it to a carry in!  Sure to be a hit anywhere!!

Very, very good.  I made it just the way it says and loved it.  I will definately make this again, it would be perfect for family gatherings.  The only people who didn't like it were those that don't like sweet ham - believe me it is their loss.....

Pretty good the first time around. A bit too sweet though. Had to add some toppings -- pickles and/or cole slaw -- to round out the sweetness. I froze the leftovers for another day.

Excellent.  I used much larger ham and still used same amount of mustard 8 ounces and 1 lb brown suger.  Takes about an hour to shred but well worth it.  I removed all but about 1 inches of ham juice before adding mustard and sugar.  This made for very moist sandwiches.

These are DELICIOUS sandwiches!!  I got a 6 lb ham and didn't have time to cook it for 8-10 hours, so I had it cooking in my crockpot on HIGH for 4 hours, then on LOW for 2 hours.  After I shredded it, I put it back in the crockpot with the mustard and brown sugar on LOW for another hour and it was perfect!!  Although, the recipe says it serves 24, it didn't seem to make that much.  I'd say more like 10-12.

LOVED IT!!  Bought a 6.9 lb bone in John Morrell ham that cost about $12.  Cooked all night on low with water to the top.  Shredded EASILY (bone fell out) after cooling in the morning, added 2 cups of brown sugar (not sure how many cups are 1 lb?) and yellow mustard as directed. Took it to Memorial Day camping and everyone LOVED IT!  Thank you for sharing.  I may try cutting back even a bit more on brown sugar next time since it is very sweet.  I don't want to lose the sweet tangy taste though.  We topped with pickled jalapenos and yum!  Feeds a crowd and then some and cheap!  Thanks again.

We really liked this recipe! It was delicious! Easy to make, satisfying.  We will definately be eating this again!  We made this exactly per recipe--although we ended up starting with a 10 pound bone in ham by Smithfield. Cooked on low on stove top for approximately 7 hours. It was falling off the bone by then.  Cooled and shredded it. Followed the next day by using the crockpot on low for 5 hours.  Superb.  We were expecting it to be really sweet, but really wasn't --it turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing this!  The only change we will make next time is tryingit with pickles on it.

I have tried this recipe before. I do not put water in the crock pot when I cook my ham. It makes its own juice while cooking. When it is done, after about 6 hours on low, I take it out and add my brown sugar and mustard. Shred the ham and put it back into the crock pot in your sauce. I use less brown sugar than this calls for and add the mustard to taste. This is always a hit with my family!

This was pretty easy but I think my crockpot overcooked the ham. The hamm was pretty dry. I did not use a full pound of brown sugar just because I was worried about sweetnes. This was good but you must serve it with pickles. It really needs that tangy counterpoint to the sweet mustard sauce.

Here's one more five-star thumbs up for Harveys Ham sandwiches.  Fixed it as written.  It's delicious with a slice of onion or with a few dashes of your favorite hot sauce.

I have used lots of recipes from this site before but have never rated one until now.  This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I took it to work today and everyone LOVED it.  I didn't tell them it had mustard in it until after they ate it.  One of my coworkers thought she didn't like mustard until today :).  I did cut back the sugar by about 1-2 cups as others suggested and was very pleased.

I don't feel I can give this 5 because I didn't cook and shred a ham!  I did however make the sauce (reduced for 4 servings) in a skillet with Dijon mustard and I stirred in some sliced deli ham for quick hot sandwich dinner.  Put the mix on some raisin bread and my contrary 2 and 4 year-olds changed their tune from "I'm NOT hungry." to "This is delicious!"  I will definitely be revisiting this in all it's glory for a large gathering.

Want to try this, but nobody mentioned the yellow mustard.  Is it very strong in the taste?  Some people just don't like mustard.  I love it.  Just wondered.  It sounds great to me.  Definitely will try a small ham to start with.  Will not change it. Think the baked beans & potato salad sound really good with it. Have a granddaughter who will be turning 18 in March.  Want to have them over for a Sunday afternoon get together. Thanks for all the good recipes.

5 Stars because I can't' remember the last time every single person I served this dish to, raved about it and wanted the recipe. I did use Hawaiian buns since they are sweet, and only added the pickles to the sandwich. Perfect!

I made this for a church function for 300 people and it was a hit!  As I tested this recipe before hand, I found that I prefered a little less sweetness so I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and it still balanced well with the mustard.

Just not my taste. It came out overly sweet and with a funny texture. We won't be trying these again.

This was delicious! I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. I also cut back on the brown sugar. I used an 8.5 lb. ham, and used almost a pound of brown sugar. I just slowly added the brown sugar & kept stirring & tasting until it was sweet enough for us. It does take a while to shred, but its well worth it. We've had leftovers for days and still have some to freeze. This is a great dish for a crowd. I used Kaiser rolls, and topped it with horseradish mustard and banana peppers. Very good!! Everyone was asking for the recipe :)

used leftover christmas ham and these were really great.  so i couldn't follow the recipe amounts exactly but i just threw what ham i had left in slow cooker with a little water.  cooked for several hours til i could shred it up and then added the brown sugar and mustard.  served ontop of fresh raised buns.  delish.  i'm not a big ham fan but i'll be eager to cook a ham just for the leftovers so i can make these sandwiches again.  thanks for the post!!

My husband and I love to cook on Sundays. In our last project, he spent the day making ham and bean soup and I made these sandwiches.  This recipe couldn't have been easier or more delicious. We invited 9 last-minute guests and every one of them loved these.  I made the recipe almost to a "T", just mixed yellow and spicy brown mustard instead of using one kind, and had a smaller ham.  We added onions and pickles as we put them together (great suggestion by previous reviewers) and they were outstanding. Will definitely make this again for a crowd.

I was only feeding four with this recipe, and so I didn't want to spend the money for a ham still on the bone.  I used a Honey Baked Ham instead that was ten dollars less.  I did put the ham with a little water in the slow cooker for about 4 hours just to see if I could get the juices flowing, and get a texture similar to a ham with a bone in it.  I don't know if I was exactly successful, but I was still pleased with the outcome.  I used half spicy brown mustard, and half regular deli mustard.  The ham was sweet, and and a lot of flavor without covering up the natural flavors of the ham.  I would say if you want the mustard to be stronger reduce the amount of brown sugar.  But, the sweet taste was really good.  I thought I would want a pickle but I didn't even think about it after one bite.  I think for a short cut you could get thicker cut deli ham.  Maybe warm for an hour and than maybe shred a little or cut into smaller pieces, and than add the mustard and brown sugar.  This is really a step up from a BBQ pork sandwich.   A little bit more classy.

Even I couldn't screw this up. I made it for a trial run for Easter, ssshhh don't tell me it's November!! All my picky eaters loved this, agreed that my family will love this for Easter. I started making this right after I finished making brunch and just left it all day. I don't have a big enough crock pot for a 6lb ham, so I got a 4 and still had to cut it in half. I have enough left over for my daughter to bring some back to her dorm and my dad to have for lunches. I took another's advice and saved the bag and cardboard from both of my Kings Hawaiian buns for leftovers. These were good, right amount of sweet!!

Delicious. Next time I am going to try scaling back on the brown sugar. Also would have been good with coleslaw served on the top. We had it on Hawaiian rolls.

This was absolutely delicious.  The next time I go to a pitch-in, this is what I am taking.  I was a little concerned that the amount of mustard would make too much bite, but not too worry.  It was great!

These turned out pretty good.  I only used half of an 8 lb ham (reserving the other half for later use).  Therefore, I scaled the brown sugar and mustard, as well.  I did scale back the sugar even more than half, per other reviewers suggestions.  Easy and tasty recipe!  Thanks, IMATECHGIRL!

This recipes has been in my "recipe box" for a very long time and I just got around to making it.  Boy, have we been missing out!  I sed a 6 lb. bone-in ham and simmered it on the stove for about 7 hours.  It feel apart beautifully.  I used 8 oz of yellow mustard and substituted 1/2 cup of coconut palm sugar for the brown sugar.  (I recommend mixing the two together before pouring it over the shredded ham.  I think it'd be much easier to combine.)  I left it on the stove on low for about 10 minutes while I set the table, etc, and it turned out fantastic!  My kids (5 and 3) both wanted seconds (of just the meat, no bun) and my husband kept telling me how good it was.  This is a definite make again!  I do have loads of leftovers but I don't see that as an issue.  I am freezing a quart sized bag of it and I am leaving the rest in the fridge for a quick lunch later this weekend.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I can't believe I forgot to review this recipe.  I've made it 3 or 4 times and we love it.  I don't change a thing and follow the recipe as written and it's delicious.  It will feed a crowd or you can freeze it for a quick meal when you don't have time to cook.  It's definitely a worth trying.

Turned out very good! Cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 2, then shredded and kept on warm for about two hours. Also I had a 7 pound ham, used almost 2 cups of sugar and probably 6 ounces of mustard bc I hate mustard and was afraid to add all of it. Was perfect for our football party. Served on potato slider rolls with pickles and bandanna peppers. Got rave reviews!

This wasn't anything special to me at all.  Basically like squirting honey mustard on shredded ham.  The sauce was too sweet for me.  Adding a dill pickle to the sandwich helped a lot but I will not be making this recipe again.

***** I grew up with a variation of this recipe.  A smoked ham was scored, covered with a mixture of yellow mustard and dark brown sugar, and cloved.  The ham was then backed until done.  It's the only way I make ham, and family and guests always ask for it on the holidays.

These sandwiches are so easy and so good! My family  loves them! I made them for my brother and sister in law to eat when they had a baby, and then she asked me to make them for the baptism party, too! YUM

I used 1lb of deli ham too, then quartered the amounts of mustard and brown sugar.  Served on my local bakery's fabulous onion rolls.  Yum yum!

I made this just as the recipe called and it was fantastic. I'm a single dad with two kids so the ease was a definite plus. I threw it in the crock pot in the morning and when I got my daughter back from cheerleading practice was able to quickly shred it, sauce it, and get it on the table. Both my kids loved it. The only downside is the smallest bone in ham I could find was 6.5 pounds, but that just means I have a freezer meal for another night I need something fast. Definitely recommend this!

I made this and follow the recipe to a T. I have never shredded ham before but it turned out great! The only thing I changed is I topped with mayo and Swiss cheese then baked open faced to make sliders.  This makes a great and easy party sandwich recipe! Will definitely make again!

I cheated and cooked the ham in my Instant Pot pressure cooker instead of the crock pot.   I used my KitchenAid stand mixer to shread the ham.   Except for procedure, I followed the recipe and it is fantastic.   I think this would be great to prep ahead of time and take camping.   Beginning to end, using the pressure cooker and mixer was 40 minutes tops.

Very good! Only used 1 cup, loosely packed brown sugar and put a horseradish cream sauce on the bun. Made for Christmas Eve and everyone enjoyed!

Kids said they were really sweet. And if the kids think they are sweet, than they must be. Nobody ate much of it. These looked so good, too. I will try again and work on toning down the sweetness.

Made it for a Sunday School snack with coffee, a little sweet I wonder about a tablespoon or two of apple vinegar.  That could "break-down" the fiber of the ham as well.  It will be great to use again for a half-time ballgame treat.

The only change we really made was to add some apple juice concentrate to the water it cooked in overnight. Everyone loved it, on rolls or by itself people were in it constantly.  Only one person said they thought it was a little sweet, but they also had it on a Hawaiian roll and thought trying it on sourdough would be better for them. Lots of room to play and customize the recipe, could add some cloves, and/or a splash of apple cider, could even add some crushed pineapple if you really like sweet ham. Many options for change and great like it is, definitely will be making it again for family gatherings.

The ham is delicious!  After reading other reviews I altered the dressing (1 Cup mustard, 1/2 C brown sugar) and it seemed to be perfect. Not too sweet, not too mustardy.  I didn't put the ham and mustard back in the pot to cook together. We used it more as a condiment since we have kids that don't like mustard.

Very, Very good recipe!  I cooked this one day while I was at work.  When I came home, to fix it, the ham was so tender, it fell right off the bone!  We invited my in-laws over and we all loved it--even my 2-year old!  I did make it another time, but made it with a spiral cut ham this time and it was really hard to shred, but still turned out yummy!  I do think the leftovers are a little dry for my tastes, though.

Cooked a ham and shredded.  Made half 'Harvey' and half not.  This was OK; not great, but that is likely just personal preference.  Maybe my proportions were off, but the flavor of the sauce seemed to dominate, not complement, the flavor of the ham.

Are you kidding me? This is about the best new recipe I have tried in a long time. I used exactly the amount of ingredients listed and it was amazing. Using the hams without the bone made it easy to pull apart and all I had to do was remove the casing at the end. I can't wait to make this over and over again for people who havent had it! Thanks for a great twist on barbeque.

Sometimes I feel like mixing random ingredients will make this miraculous mingling of flavors, but this was just sweet, mustardy ham.  Not bad, but very sweet.

Way too sweet!!!  Such a waste of a good ham!  I suggest all of this recipe until you add the sugar and mustard...make a sauce that you can use as a condiment out of the brown sugar and mustard. Then you can make it to your taste. The ham fell apart, so that part was perfect.

Used a 9 lb bone in ham. Once ham was tender in crock pot,  I let cool and took meat off bone. Took all water out of crock pot. Tore  ham in small chunks, put back in crock pot. Mixed 1  cup brown sugar and a 12 oz container of yellow mustard with jalapenos it,  poured over ham chunks, once warm again, I used an electric  hand mixer to shred the meat in the crock pot.  There was a hint of spicy heat, but by no means was spicy. My 4 year nephew and his very picky mother loved it!! Definitely a hit with my family, the leftovers won't last long.

This is delicious and easy!  I used leftover spiral sliced ham instead of bone in ham but the results were amazing! I cooked exactly as outlined and it was a tad sweet.  But that was easily solved with a pickle slice on each sandwich.    Seriously - this is delicious.

Awesome. I also halved the brown sugar on an 8 lb  ham. My picky 5 yr old ate it up. Pickle slice and hot sauce on mine :-)

This was awesome!  I bought a very large ham that wouldn't fit in my crock pot so I put it in the oven in a roaster with about 1 inch of water and baked at 250 for about 7 hours until it was falling apart. Took it out, let cool for about 15 minutes and then shredded with forks. Added my "sauce", stirred all together then popped back in the oven for about 45 minutes. It was perfect with some homemade slaw and dill pickles. Lots left so put in freezer bags to enjoy again!

My family loved it! Very sweet so you might want to tone down the brown sugar but I didn't mind it as-is. :-) Super easy, delicious, tons of leftovers - who could ask for more?

Have taken it to two parties and everyone loved it! Just came on the site to send the recipe to a friend. Keep the water when draining it and make split pea or ham and potato soup.

Made the quick cheater version: Microwaved 2 to 1 ratio of mustard to brown sugar until it was warm and mixed well. Warmed up left over ham in the microwave. Mixed some of the mustard into the ham until it tasted good and served on toasted buns. Mmmm This was good. Thanks!

I made this so I could have a lazy day at home with my family.  We followed directions to a tee and it was GREAT! My husband now brags to his friends about this ham.  He will eat it on buns with an onions slice, I like mine with dill pickles.  This has instantly become a household favorite.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe that my whole family loves.  We've made it several times and just freeze the leftovers for a quick meal for another night.  It's easy and doesn't require a lot of ingredients.  Enjoy!

Very Sweet, if we had not put the onion and horseradish sauce on the sandwich I don't think we could have eaten them, they were soooo sweet. Won't be fixing this again... just not for our taste.

Everyone who tried this loved it, we used relish the first time as someone sugested then tried dill pickles the second and I would have to say the dill was much better it gave it a sweet and sour taste. I followed the recipe exactly using plain yellow mustard and an 8lb bone in ham.
