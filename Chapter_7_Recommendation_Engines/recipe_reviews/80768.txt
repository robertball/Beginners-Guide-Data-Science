EDIT: I MEANT I ADDED THESE INGREDIENTS TO THE RECIPE! This is delicious! I used 2 oz spaghetti, much more garlic, some minced onions, one small yellow sweet-hot pepper, more zucchini, green beans, spinach, a can of olives, and more feta. With more vegetables and less pasta, it's just wonderful. Thank you.

STRONGLY recommend substituting artichoke hearts for the zucchini! We got one small jar of the marinated artichoke hearts, and one can of plain ones (cheaper) then mixed them together...there was definitely enough marinade from the small jar to completely soak the regular ones as well as the entire dish! I can't imagine this dish without the artichoke flavoring- it made it! my picky bf loved it as much- if not more- than me. we used lots of pasta and it lasted several meals. YUM!

Wow...  Loved it!  I made this with a few adjustments:  I substituted red and green bell pepper for the zucchini and just left out the olives since I didn't have them.  It was good the first day but got better as it sat in the fridge; reheated in the micro...  This was a flavorful and healthy dish.

Has the potential to be out of this world, but it needs WAY more feta and olives.

We double this for our family of five, which allows for some leftovers, and make the following changes - leave out the zucchini, add one jar of marinated artichoke hearts (with liquid) & one can of plain artichoke hearts (drained), use a bunch of extra olives and feta. You can also use regular, button mushrooms instead of crimini ones. This dish would be really good with sun dried tomatoes, but I haven't actually tried it that way yet.

I didnâ€™t think it was going to be that great but I was very impressed when it was done.  I substituted Artichoke Hearts for the Zucchini because that is what was in the cupboard.

My husband and I thought it was absolutely delicious. I sauteed the zucchini with the mushrooms in olive oil, and added the garlic only when the veggies were almost ready so as to keep the flavor and not burn it. We also added a lot more feta, cut into small cubes (about 1-2 oz for half the recipe). Next time, we might add a diced fresh tomato. Thanks!

This was great! Definitely making again. I did use calmata olives instead of plain black and marinated artichokes since i had some to use and thought that they would fit well.

This is awesome if you love just an olive oil pasta and I wanted to see if I was one of those. But I am 100% a tomato sauce person, so I had to add it after I tried it, then I loved it!

This was easy and pretty good. I used goat cheese instead of the feta b/c that's what I had handy. I think the feta would have been better.

This was quite tasty!  I took the advice of another reviewers and added Italian sausage, asparagus and artichokes to the mix.  I also added an onion, lots more garlic and some Greek seasoning.  It turned out delish!!

It was dry, but we added tomato sauce and it was a good pasta dish. Easy to make! We added asparagus also, which was yummy!

This tasted ok to me.  It needed a little more flavor or a sauce or something.  It wasn't bad, just tasted incomplete.

I added sausage for our meat loving house and to make more filling.  I had to use canned mushrooms.  My fresh oregano went well with this.  I used more feta than called for, I had two containers here and didn't measure, just eye balled it.  I will make again.

I needed a side to accompany the Pork Souvlaki from this site.  I used orzo instead of spaghetti and since I didn't have crimini mushrooms on hand, I used regular button ones.  Kalamata Olives completed the "Greek" taste.  Delicious!

This was excellent-- a  perfectly light summer pasta. It was drier than we expected, and I did add an extra tablespoon of olive oil. Overall, it was well-received in our family. Thanks! (I finely chopped the veggies instead of having larger slices)

We loved this meal and will use it again but will add more garlic when the veggie's are ready to be added so we don't lose the flavor. Also, we would suggest cutting the zuccini in smaller pieces.

This was great and easy to make- i hardly took any time at all. I used regular fresh mushrooms and adjusted the recipe for 6 people. I'm not a big zucchini eater, but I really liked it in this dish! Even my picky little sister ate this.

Go easy on the feta. Too salty otherwise. Probably would be better with parmesan or something. The veggies were great.

This was delicious! It's great how you can add or take out according to your tastes. I added extra olives, onions, and diced tomatoes. It still would have been great without the extras.  The crumbled feta cheese really completed the dish.

I used Kalamata olives instead of black olives, and used way more than 12 of them. I also added more feta than it calls for. Mix the feta in while it is still in the hot pan, and it spreads out and makes the dish more flavorful!

It's good as leftovers both heated up and cold!

Used as a base for what I call "refrigerator" pasta -- using up spinach, rotini, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all ready to use.  Feta and olives are always a great combination in pasta and this was no exception.

Delicious. Substituted artichoke for the zucchini and added some red bell pepper and kalamata olives instead of black olives.

These were simple to make but nothing to excite me.   I had used spanish olives instead of black ones because I was making this dish just for me and did not want to open up a new can of black olives.  And the over thing I had replaced per reviewers suggestions was artichokes for the zucchini's but I really think the zukes was meant to be in this dish.

I surprised my boyfriend with this dish one day and it was absolutely delicious! I skipped the mushrooms and zucchini and added slices of grilled chicken and it was very flavorful. Definitely one of my favorite pasta dishes!
