This is a wonderful dry rub or whisk into olive oil for a marinade. I didn't have any turbinado sugar so I substituted raw organic coconut sugar.   Makes a large amount but so easy to keep in an air tight container.

I don't usually rate recipes but since this one has so few ratings I just had to give my 5 stars.  I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  I made a thick paste with olive oil and coated a pork loin roast with it.  I slow roasted it uncovered and the result was awesome.  My party loved it.  Almost everyone went back for seconds!  Even the drippings were spooned up!  
I also want to say that I normally don't like jerk because I find it too heavy with cinnamon.  This one is really balanced with all the different spices.  I didn't find it spicy enough but maybe my cayenne was old.

Delicious and unique. Usually the griller receives all the compliments, but this rub is so good, I was complimented as well. I didn't have all of the ingredients, but most, and it was still amazing. Thank you for sharing.

We loved this in a rub for grilled chicken. I used Coconut Sugar for the Turbinado and cut back a little on the cayenne. It was easy to cut the recipe to 1/3 which still made enough for a few batches of grilled chicken.

Delicious! Good blend of spicy and sweet. I skipped the salt completely and didn’t miss it.

Made it, used it, everything worked out fine but flavor left me wanting, Amount of heat was spot on but didn't taste much of anything else. My spices weren't old. Maybe I didn't use enough but thighs were covered. May increase other ingredients if I make again.

Solid Jerk dry rub! I use it for grilled boneless chicken thighs. coat the thighs, place in a bag, (I use the food saver machine) Let them set in the fridge for a day or so before grilling. Grill and enjoy. no additional sauce needed! Fantastic Jerk rub!

I used the recipe with all the optional stuff added.  It's great.  I think I will try it like a season-all type addition.

Wonderful! Made jerk chicken tacos then used the rub to make spicy jerk lentil tacos then turned the leftover jerk lentils into lentil burgers. This will definitely become a staple in my kitchen. It's the right about of spicy heat and sweet heat.
