I tried this recipe last year since I had left over dates to use. To my surprise they were a huge hit with family and friends. Great coffee cookie! I made them again this year and now they are a part of my Christmas Cookie baking ritual.

i made this recipe as part of a massive holiday cookie bake.  if i were doing it at any other time i probably would have been pleased with the process.  the end product is fine, if a little bland (even with the addition of nutmeg and cinammon.)  i might use half brown sugar in the future.

as it was, the recipe took a while to put together, even using ye trusty hand mixer.  chopping the dates was an enormous bother, and frankly i will in the future stay away from any cookie recipe that requires sifting flour.

finally, due to their richness, the cookie do take a full 12-15 minutes to bake.  this is about twice the bake time i need to finish baking this weekend.

i will certainly keep the cookie dough on hand - my husband loved them, as they weren't too sweet for him.  but quick and easy these ain't.  well - for a more organized baker they might be.  at any rate, if you have to make a lot of them, i'd suggest doing two batches at a time to save the hassle of doing everything twice.

Nobody in this house is fond of dates, (the dates were a gift and were quite fresh) but these cookies are really VERY nice.  They hold their shape well and look very much like huge chocolate chip cookies.  However, you'll need to grease the cookie sheets as the cookies will stick a little.  The dates taste far better than raisins in a cookie recipe, in my opinion.  Happy baking!

These cookies are the best ever. I made them to celebrate that my mom finished radiation. I am 11 years old and these are the first batch of cookies I have ever made by myself and not messed up, they are incredibly easy.

I had some leftover dates from Christmas that I needed to use so I tried this recipe. These turned out so tender and delicious. The kids ate them right up. This recipe is a keeper.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! My Texan grandmother (born 1910, she was old school) made this exact cookie for me as a kid in the 70's.  I never had her recipe, so when I saw yours...
One bite, took me right back to her kitchen after school.  Wonderful!

This recipe was pretty good, only complaint was that the cookies were hard after they cooled.  I made sure not to overbake.  Othewise, they were good, the whole family gives a thumbs up on this one.  :)

I baked these cookies for my Grandma's 102nd birthday--she loves dates.  Following instructions exactly, I thought the cookies were a little bland.  So I sprinkled subsequent batches with a sugar/cinnamon mixture before baking and they were very good.  Next time I'll use more dates and nuts.  (Have to admit that the first thing I reached for all week when I walked in the door from work was one of these cookies.  They stay soft to the last crumb!)  And Grandma loved them, too.

Really great recipe and wasn't hard to make.  I didn't use walnuts and they were still great. It was soft and moist.

I made these for my students for something different, and they were a hit!  My 5th graders were sure that they wouldn't like dates, but they were shocked at how great the cookies were! I'll definitely make these again!

This made 32 big cookies for me. Very good and an excellent way to use dates. Cookies have a nice date taste, but not overpowering. I used 1 cup chopped walnuts. I will make these anytime I have dates.

These cookies are great!  My hubby was very hesitant, and my 4 year old was turned off because there wasn't any chocolate, but everyone else who tried them thought they were very good.  I will definitely make these cookies again, even if it's just for tea time or to share with others

Very nice, easy recipe. For half of the flour I substituted whole wheat flour, as my sweetheart is diabetic. I enjoyed the cake like texture of these cookies.

These came out great! I didn't flatten my cookies on the baking tray as I prefer them 'chunkier'. I would use this recipe again with other things such as dried figs or chocolate chips.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used Namaste Gluten Free flour. They turned out fabulous!! I will definitely make these again.
