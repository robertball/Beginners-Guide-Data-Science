This was an excellent salad, however I hate beets.
I omitted those and added artichoke hearts instead.  YUM! I will definately make this again!

My company and I throughly enjoyed this salad.  I used butter lettuce instead of romaine, and added walnuts and crumbled goat cheese.  Very tasty!

Very good.  The beet and bacon flavors go well together.

Liked the combination of flavors and colors. This was really a pretty salad. Will make again. Used regular spring mix instead of romaine and real bacon bits as a timesaver.

I'm new to beets and have never had them in a salad, so I wanted to start with a quick, no fuss recipe to test them out.  This is a great one.  Simple, not a lot of prep, and tastes fantastic!

Thought this salad was great! I thinly sliced an entire bunch of ramaine, not just the hearts. Was a big hit, and great for my diabetic Dad.  Will make again!

We loved, loved, loved this salad!  The main dish was too hot to eat immediately, so we started with the salad.  I didn't think we would even get to the main dish.  Made it exactly as listed, although I only had sliced beets - they were fine sliced thinly cross-ways.  We didn't quite finish it (we're only three), but I think it will still be tasty for dinner.  Thanks Lori.

This is a really tasty salad - it has all the right elements.  Of course it depends on the dressing you use - just pick your favorite.  Adding Feta or a crumbled goat cheese would be good if you don't have parmesan.    I use fresh cooked beets but canned would be awesome too.  I added some nice crunchy croutons.  Very nice.

I didn't have bacon bits, but I can't wait to add them next time. I did crumbled feta for the cheese and added croutons for an extra crunch. I like Nonas balsamic reduction for the dressing. Definitely going into the salad rotation in our house!
