Amazing recipe. I bake a lot of bread and this is by far one of the best Wheat breads I've come by. Surprisingly, this recipe is pretty much perfect. I've made it about 4 times now and it's fail-safe everytime. I've also sub sugar for honey and it works fine (use the same amount). This is a very moist, tender, slightly chewy bread. It makes the quintessential sandwich bread and stays moist for at least a few days. To make sandwich size bread, you will only need TWO 9x5" loaf pans.  Exactly 25 min. was perfect for me.  This will be my master Wheat bread recipe. **For variation, I've added 1/2 cup of 10-Grain mix (Bob's Red Mill brand) and 2 tablespoon of whole flax seed for added nutrition and texture. You can also add sunflower seeds, sesame seeds or flaxseed meal for other options. I used a Kitchen-Aid mixer and always end up adding about 3.5 cups whole wheat flour. I knead on level 1 & 2 for about 10 min. then take out and knead by hand for about 1 min. to form a large dough ball before letting it rise. **TIP** For a more chewy bread and higher rise, similar to the store bought ones, add 3-4 tablespoons of powdered gluten.General rule is usually 1 tablespoon gluten for every 1 cup of flour. But for this recipe, I found 4 tbl. was fine. I've also halved the recipe with success - 2 cups bread flour, 2 cups wheat flour, 1 tsp. salt, 1/3 cup honey, 3 tbl. gluten.

This bread is DELICIOUS! What I did differently was add a mixture of seeds such as sunflower, sesame, and whatever else was in the mixture. Also I add 1 cup of oats. I replace the butter with un-sweetened applesauce, and I don't use as much honey. I think the amount of honey the recipe calls for makes the bread too sweet. This bread does not need to be kneaded on a flour surface. I knead it in the bowl. After kneading, make sure your bowl is buttered so that the dough won't stick when you let it rise.
*** NEW BREAD MAKERS:*** Take 5-8 minutes to knead your bread. It's properly kneaded when it's smooth as a baby's butt.You will know when your bread is done when you insert a thermometer and it reaches 190-200F. If you don't have a thermometer, knock on the bread. If it makes thud noise, it's not done. It should sound hollow. As soon as the bread is done, remove from pan immediately and let it cool on a wire rack. If you leave it in the pan, the steam will make the bread soggy and it'll mold on the bottom!

My family loved this bread.  I took 2 of the dough loaves and froze them after they had risen and punched down.  When needed, you defrost in fridge 24 hrs and place in greased pan and allow to rise the 2nd time and bake as recipe calls for.

This is one great recipe.  I kept making it and kept adding more fresh ground golden whole wheat flour until I made it the other day with 100% fresh ground whole wheat flour and no white flour and it was so yummy and good.  This recipe is very forgiving and turns out well even if you add a little more or a little less flour to it.  It's good for toasting, slicing for sandwiches, and best of all, right out of the oven with butter melted on it.  Everyone should try this recipe.  I wish I could give it more stars even!!!
UPDATE: I am still making and selling this bread made with 100% fresh ground Montana Gold wheat berries.  I make it vegan for customers and sub sugar and canola oil and it still comes out perfect every time.  You just HAVE to try this recipe !!!

This is an awesome recipe! I have a little trick to cut the rising time in half~ if I've just folded clothes and the dryer's still hot, I'll place the covered dough in the dryer & close the dryer door. Of course you don't turn the dryer on, but the heat from it causes it to rise faster.

Wow! I have been baking bread all my life, but my loaves never turned out like this one, it is perfect. I follow the recipe exactly and never have a problem. I have been making this bread for about a year now. It is wonderful to always have fresh bread for  sandwiches, etc. We live in Alaska and bread here is expensive and stale. I will never go back to buying bread from the store, thank you!
One hint I can give for cold climates: I let the dough rise in the oven and turn on the oven light; my bulb puts out just enough heat to make it warm in there but not to hot. Also, I let it rise twice in the bowl instead of just once, it makes the texture even better.

I love this recipe, it's easy and it's always a hit!  I usually make one or two of the loaves into cinnamon raisin bread.  I roll it out, sprinkle a little water on it and then sprinkle about a half cup cinnamon / sugar mixture and lots of raisins on top.  I roll it back up tightly and pinch the ends together.  I also have put a little more whole wheat flour and less bread flour to make it healthier.  It's great to have three loaves, I can give one away and still have two for my family.  It freezes nicely too.  To help the dough rise even faster, I turn my oven on for about 1 minute and then turn it off and let the dough rise in the oven.

This bread is absolutely delicious! I scaled the recipe down to one loaf, and it came out perfectly! This was the VERY FIRST time I made bread, so I made a few mistakes: used water that was too hot, so it killed the yeast; overbaked it, so it came out too dry. But when I finally got it right, it was great! I used a little more honey and yeast than called for. One loaf calls for 2/3 package of yeast, and I just used a whole packet. The rising, however, took longer than the 3 hours indicated in the recipe (even when I only used 2/3 packet of yeast). It took me about 5 hours, so don't start this bread too late in the day! Hubby and I usually eat this bread with breakfast: I wrap it in foil to reheat it (it stays soft and moist!), and I spread butter on it. YUMMY! This one's a keeper!

Superb! This ends my search for the Holy Grail of whole wheat honey breads. Thanks, Nita! I added .25 cup sunflower seeds per loaf, and omitted the butter during baking, though did butter brush the crust. Lovely. (Kitchen Aid speed 2, dough hook, 10 minutes)

This is a no-fail bread!  It has a great texture every time!  And it tastes great.  I make all three loaves, then once they are cool, I wrap up two of them with aluminum foil, then a ziploc, and throw them in the freezer until I'm ready to use them.  This is a delicious bread!

I've been making my own version of this bread weekly for 3+ years now. I must admit I am always annoyed by "whole wheat" recipes that call for all-purpose or bread flour. I make it 100% whole grain, with 7+ cups of freshly ground whole wheat flour (hard white wheat), 1 cup of old fashioned oats, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup ground flax meal. I add 3-4 Tbsp of vital wheat gluten to help it raise. I use olive oil instead of butter (and don't bother buttering the tops). It's awesome, soft, and delicious. Wonderful whole grain bread for daily eating, sandwiches, etc. Wait til it's cool (or next day) to slice. We use 1 loaf and put the other 2 in the freezer to pull out a few days later. - EDIT - I now add an egg to this. It makes it much less crumbly when cutting and using for sandwiches. I also replace half the honey with plain applesauce.

One of the nicest wheat breads I've ever made.  Soft textured in the middle due to the white bread flour.  I used molasses instead of honey and substituted one cup extra whole wheat for one cup white - good thing because I didn't need to use all the wheat flour in the end.  I used my KitchenAid to do the entire loaf and luckily, I have the big, beefy model - a lesser model might have a tough time kneading all that dough.  I made the full recipe shaping two loaves of bread and the rest I formed a dozen rolls for our dinner tonight.  I just snuck one and Yummo!  Great recipe, even though I did forget the salt!  Oh well, the melted butter had enough in it, I'm guessing.  I didn't overmix it in the KitchenAid BTW - one reviewer let it knead in the KA mixer for 15 minutes.  That's way too long!!  Oh, and don't try speeding up the process for rising by sticking your bread in a hot dryer or oven like I've read.  A towel in the oven with the light bulb on is plenty of heat.  The long rise lends itself to a lighter texture.  Dough is enhanced in a slow rise - don't speed it up as your loaf never turns out quite as nice!

If your preference is the fluffy balloon bread typical of the mega market this is not the recipe for you. I've tried this recipe twice, both times different, and the resulting bread was tender, moist,  chewy with a good closed crumb but not heavy or overly dense. With my  first attempt I followed the recipe exactly as written and the bread was delicious. The second time I made a few personal changes. I used only whole wheat flour to which I added vital wheat gluten, 1 Tbl per cup of flour, and 1/4 cup of dry milk. I let the sponge sit for about an hour and reduced the honey to about 1/3 cup total. I used my kitchen aide mixer and after the initial mixing I let the dough knead for 7-8 minutes on 2. All-in-all both ways produced an excellent bread which stands up to sandwiches and toasting very well. A few suggestions; bread has three main ingredients, first is flour-so a good quality flour is imperative, second is water-if you do not drink the water from your tap do not put it in your bread, third is yeast-it must be fresh. Also, yeast can be inactivated by heat and salt so I always test the temperature of my water and temper my sponge with flour before adding salt. Never force the dough to rise as a low slow rise imparts flavor. Lastly, always measure/weigh all ingredients. These are a few tips given to me by a dear friends mother who was a professional baker, in her Chicago bakery, for over 50 years.

Oh my!!! I've found the mother of all bread recipes. I follow the recipe exactly except that I use 100% fresh ground whole wheat. Mine always takes MUCH LONGER TO RISE. If you only want one loaf: After the first rise, wrap two of the loaves individually in plastic wrap, then place in a freezer bag, and freeze.  To bake: Take one loaf out of the freezer 24 hours before baking, unwrap, place in greased pan, cover, and place in fridge until next day.  Take out and put in a warm place to allow it to rise and then bake!

This is only the second bread I've ever made. The first one that I made was in a cook book and it turned out horribal, it was extremly dense and hard as a rock! This one turned out great, it was nice and soft but hard enough to cut easily through it. And to help people who bought the yeast in bulk (like me)two .25 ounces of yeast is 1 Tablespoon.

I followed the recommendation someone else gave for use with the kitchen aid.  The first time, my kitchen aid started smoking during the kneading.  10 minutes is probably too long to knead if you have a mixer.  Most kitchen-aid recipes only recommend 5-6 minutes.  When I kneaded it for only a few minutes in the mixer (until it was a nice ball) and then set it onto the counter for just a few minutes and kneaded until it was elastic, my bread turned out much better.  Also-  if you are a novice bread maker like me, you'll have to be sure you know how to shape the loafs right.  Just plopping it in the pan after dividing in half makes air holes within the loaf.  You have to roll out your dough flat (about 10-11 inches long to fit your pan), and then roll it up  like you do when making cinnamon rolls.  Tuck the ends under a bit, and set into the pan.  When I did this the second time, my bread turned out perfectly!  This recipe also makes great rolls and artisan-style bread.

Excellent! Everyone is right on the money, this is a no fail recipe. A few things I want to note however: Whatever you do, do NOT freeze the dough after you punch it down. You'll kill the yeast and it will not rise again (which it should do in the loaf pan before you place it in the oven). It will bake fine, but it will never rise. It will be just as small as it was when you put it in the freezer and will be very dense. Trust me, I know because I did it. When it refused to rise, I then slapped my forehead thinking about killing the yeast.  :--: 2. Be sure your loaf pan is well greased. I tore off the bottoms of my first loaves accidentally because my pans were not liberally greased. The next time I did it with plenty and the loaf fell right out. :--: 3. For newbs like me who are doing this by hand... the recipe says to "stir in" flour. Do not panic when you find that very quickly you cannot "stir" any longer. I finally had to resort to sort of kneading the flour in (especially the whole wheat) and to my delight, it still turned out perfect and light. :--: 4. I do not need the extra whole wheat flour for kneading. I knead mine in a bowl (as someone suggested) and doing it that way only requires a small amount of extra flour. I add the 2 c. of whole wheat and then I probably use less than 1/4 c. for kneading and I'm a newb! :--: I'm just so proud of this. I'm done with store bought bread from now on! :)  Thanks so much Nita!!!

Wonderful dough to work with, even cutting it in half. I did it all with my Kitchen Aid mixer, proofing the yeast with the honey and warm water in the mixer bowl and then adding the rest of the wet and then the dry. I didn't need any extra flour to get it to jump on the hook and knead for five minutes. It came together really nicely. And rising? This dough was a champ. Really rose nicely. 30 minutes at 350* was perfect. Good, chewy whole wheat bread. VERY nice.

This bread is absolutely delicious with a wonderful, slightly sweet flavor!  My only change to the ingredients was using Brummel and Brown spread in place of butter.  I made it the way I make all my breads -proofed the yeast with 1/2 c warm/hot water & honey & let it sit for 10 minutes until foamy.  I combined the salt and most of the flour in my KA mixer & after the 10 minutes, poured in the yeast, remaining water, honey & melted butter.  I used my kneading hook & added 1/4 c of flour at a time to the mixing bowl as it mixed, just until the dough cleanly pulled away from the bowl.  I kneaded it for 8 minutes, then put it in a large Pam sprayed bowl & covered it with saran wrap.  I placed the bowl in the oven which had been preheated to 170 (the lowest my oven goes) and turned off.  I left it in the oven until doubled, punched it down, formed 3 loaves & placed it back into the warm oven, uncovered.  When the loaves had doubled, I removed them from the oven, preheated it, then placed them back in to bake.  I've had issues in the past, with my bread rising, then falling when I uncover it.  I never cover it anymore for the 2nd rise.  It works great every time and I've never noticed any negative results.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing!! This bread is fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly and it made 3 generous loaves. The rise time was about an hour for each rise session and I put it in the oven with the light on to rise in a warm environment. When kneading, it took about an extra cup of whole wheat flour to make it not real sticky. 20 minutes in my oven was just perfect. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

PERFECT bread!!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!  The taste is amazing, and usually I'm very picky about bread.  The texture is perfect, it's very light and fluffy!  I followed the amounts in the recipe exactly as the recipe called for, but I had to make one change because my grocery store was sold out of white bread flour - I purchased whole wheat bread flour and used that in place of the 5 cups of white bread flour the recipe called for.  So then I substituted normal, white all purpose flour in place of the 3½ cups of whole wheat flour the recipe calls for.  Essentially, I just reversed to ratio of whole wheat to white flour, so it worked out to be 70% whole wheat bread.  THANK YOU for sharing this recipe; it's so good that it's almost beyond perfect and amazing.  Tips to new bread bakers:  Knead the dough for close to 10 minutes (until the texture is completely smooth and elastic) and make sure you let it rise completely!  To test if the dough has risen enough, take your finger and make an indentation in the dough that's about a half inch deep; if the dough springs back, it's NOT risen enough yet.  If you poke your finger in and the indentation stays there, or very slowly comes back out, then your dough is risen enough and will bake beautifully without being dense.  If you live in a colder climate like I do, put the dough in your oven (NOT turned on) and turn on your oven light; it creates enough warmth to speed up the rising process without being too hot.

Very good bread. I changed the ratio down to 24 b/c I didn't want my first try to make 3 loaves (and I don't think my kitchen aid could handle that amount of ingredients). I forgot to change the honey measure as I read the directions but it still came out great and made 2 loaves. I used applesauce instead of butter and my picky husband said it was great. We had toast this morning and used for tuna sandwiches this afternoon. It held up perfectly for the sandwich!

Excellent recipe, my picky family LOVES it.  I did change the honey for 1/3 c of white sugar and 1/3 c of brown.  It also freezes well, I quite often make the recipe and shape the loaves, before it rises again I take the dough and pop them into lightly greased freezer bags.  When you want a loaf take it out, put it in your pan, let thaw, rise than bake.

This is absolutly the best whole wheat recipe I have made.  I did add vital wheat gluten to make a better crumb and make it last longer.  1 T per 1 cup flour.  I also used all whole wheat flour.  This would be great with sunflower seeds, oatmeal and flax seed in it.  I have made this 3 times in 2 weeks, my family loves it.  Great recipe.

A suggestion for baking a perfect loaf.  Bake for one hour at 350 in an oven that has not been pre-heated.  The loaf comes out soft and airy in the middle and with a hard thin crust on the outside.  Don't add butter to the loaf afterwards and keep the hard crust.  Delicious!   I first tried to bake it for 30 min at 350 and then took it out but it had a doughy inside (not yet baked).  I put it back in but it was too late.  Still doughy in the middle after another 10 min of baking.  So for the next loaf I tried my old trick of baking it for an hour in an oven that has not been pre-heated and it was perfect!

This is a wonderful Wheat bread.  It has become our favorite sandwich bread.  This recipe makes 2 really big 9 x 5 loaves.  You can add cracked wheat or flax in step 2.  Easily halved to make 1 loaf.   I often make the full batch then make one loaf and a bunch of sandwich rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Update:  I have started making this using more WW flour and less white flour.  Add the WW flour first so it totally hydrates and then mix in the white flour - you might not need all the white flour as the WW flour absorbs more water than white flour does.

I took your method and used whole wheat flour only and it's the best recipe for whole wheat I've found yet. For the person who finds it difficult to knead in whole wheat flour, I think you just need to hang in there - it takes longer to get the gluten up and working.  Spectacular bread and makes marvelous rolls: brush with beaten egg white, sprinkle on oatmeal.  Both bread and rolls keep well in the freezer, fantastic toast!

I've made this bread 2-3 times per week for the past 4 weeks and it'just keeps gettin better!  I've subbed molasses for half the honey and it's a nice rich flavor. So far, I''ve also added sesame, sunflower, & flax seeds as well as quinoa to total approx 1/2 cup add-ins.  My husband can't get enough. I do it in the bread machine and do the last rising in the pans in the microwave, sitting with a pot of steaming water then bake.  It's so much I usually make a 1/2 batch to make two loaves.  Thank you so much!  I'm finally getting my hubby to eat healthy!

I agree with another reviewer -- the nutty, slightly sweet taste of this bread is very reminiscent of the Arnold brand wheat bread.

I mixed and kneaded the dough in large Dutch oven, and then let it rise in an upside down plastic cake server I had greased so clean-up was very easy -- no messy counters!

I also made 2 loaves and split the dough for the last loaf into a 12-hole muffin tin for large rolls.  It worked out fine.

Very tasty -- definitely a keeper! Thanks!

So easy, SO GOOD.  Added 3 T. gluten before the sponge, and made two med. size loaves and rolls.  Used a mixer and kneaded for eight minutes on 2.

When I make this I make one loaf that is plain wheat, one that is cinnamon raisin, and one that is cherry white chocolate. After dividing the dough for the three loves, I roll out the dough for two of the loaves into rectangles about 7 inches wide and 11 or 12 inches long. I sprinkle one with cinnamon sugar and raisins and the other with shaved white chocolate and dried cherries. I roll each of them, tuck the ends and bake.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. I have been making it for over a year now and it has never failed me. Anyone who tries it tells me it's the best bread they've ever had and asks for the recipe. I did change the recipe a little...I add ALL wheat flour except one cup white, and I don't add the butter. I forgot the butter once, and neither my husband or I could tell a difference so I've been leaving it out ever since. Good luck and enjoy!

Watch out: if you make this bread and leave it out, entire loaves will disappear because your family or roommates will eat them in less than a day. Fortunately, this is a simple and yummy recipe, so it is easy to make more, and it turns out great every time.  I often knead in 1/2 cup each ground flax, cracked wheat kernels, and steel-cut oatmeal (substitute for 1.5 cups of the whole wheat flour) to make a healthy high-protein multigrain loaf.

Great bread, and even better AFTER it is frozen! Straight out of the oven, this bread is so moist, it is downright wet. So freeze the other two loaves. Take frozen loaf out of the freezer, thaw, and it is perfectly heavenly. Just right. Enough moisture to be chewy, but not gooey. The advice about mixing in a large tupperware container was great. It is messy to mix, and this made it much easier to clean up.

To start off with, I live at 7000 feet elevation, so baking has been quite difficult for me to master. However, I have refused to give up. This is probably the tenth bread recipe that I have tried, and the first loaf of bread that's come out PERFECT! Usually, my bread comes out too hard, too crumbly, the crust is an ugly bubbly looking thing, and it never browns. But with a couple high altitude tweaks, not a single problem occurred.

What I changed:
- I preheated my oven at the end of step 2, so the oven was completely hot when I put the loaf in.
- I preheated it to 375 instead.
- I filled a pie pan half full with water and put in on the bottom rack of my oven during preheating and baking. This was so the bread wouldn't dry out too fast.
- In step 2, I started with only using half the whole wheat flour while kneading, and added more to the dough as it got stickier. Once I could turn it 2-3 times without it sticking I stopped.
- I cut the baking time down to 20 minutes.
- I only baked one loaf at a time (but this is because I only have one bread pan).

I really hope my tips will help anyone who is having difficulties baking at high altitude. And needless to say, I will most definitely be baking this again in the near future!

This is indeed the most delicious bread made! I scaled down to 1 loaf and followed all the same ingredients except that I used vegetable oil instead of butter. I used the whole package (0.25 ounce) of yeast too. However, having experience in baking bread often, I mixed the ingredients as how I am used to. I mixed all the dry ingredients together, then the honey, vegetable oil (substitute for butter)and lastly the warm water (bit by bit). I mixed them well, then knead them on a floured space. It worked just as well, with less the hassle, I feel. The bread turned out perfect. The texture was soft and chewy. Now, I regret that I made only one loaf. I will definitely make this again. Marvelous for sandwiches!!

this recipe is fantastic. i now make this bread once a week. i also increase the ratio of whole wheat to white flour and it still comes out great. even when i use 100% whole wheat flour it is very good. the initial 30 minute rising also makes it a very easy dough to knead.

Excellent bread recipe. I grind my own grain and make this with 100% freshly ground whole wheat flour. I add one tablespoon of vital wheat gluten for each cup of flour that I use to help it rise since using all whole wheat flour makes a heavier loaf of bread. Very, very good!!!

I scaled this down to one loaf (12 servings) and used my bread machine, adding all the wet ingredients first and then the dry.  Results were absolutely fantastic.  So fantastic in fact, that I may not ever NOT make this bread in the bread machine (my apologies those of us with more sincere artisan bends) - at least not until my young children are older.  :)    This bread is light and airy with the most wonderfully crunchy crust.  Bread machine or by hand - if you want a superb whole wheat recipe, you've found it right here!

This recipe was a really good starting point.  I changed the amounts of flours to make it a little healthier.  I used 5 cups of whole wheat and  added that first.  I find it's much easier to knead in bread flour than whole wheat flour.  I also added 4 TBSP vital wheat gluten with the whole wheat flour. (You can buy this where the bread machine mixes are sold) It made the crumb much finer than just plain whole wheat would have been.  Even with tose "healthier" changes, this bread got definite thumbs ups from my family.  I just started my second batch, since the first 3 loaves are gone already! I will try freezing one loaf's worth of dough this time, to thaw and cook at a later date, as suggested by another reviewer.
Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I've made this bread 4-5 times now, love it.  Agree that you should only make two loaves out of it if you want good sandwich-sized bread.  Also left off the butter brush on the top this last time, since it kept turning my crusts into this unpleasant pruned-finger skin texture.  I don't know what the concern is about the crust hardening, mine is still a beautiful soft golden-brown after three days in saran wrap on the counter (and let's face it, it won't be around much longer).

Wow!  I read all the reviews before trying this.  I used only wheat flour and added 5T gluten, no butter in the bread and 1/3 of the salt.  Awesome!!!  My husband said it rivaled the bliss of eating ice cream, and that is saying a lot for him!  Will make SO many more times, love it.

Okay, I'm convinced! It really is a very simple, wonderful bread recipe.  I thought it was going to be disastrous, but since I'm stuck inside here on Christmas Eve due to incredible, torrential rain, I thought I'd give it a go....how wonderful it was!  Tasty, sweet (but not TOO sweet) and has a fabulous aroma....give it a try, you'll be glad you did.  I swapped one of the bread flour cups for another cup of whole wheat.....added fiber and very tasty.  Merry Christmas!

this was the simplest wheat bread i've ever made. only one thing wrong with it. the ingredients should have said 2/3 cup of honey. that was a little miss leading if you'd only had enough for a 1/3 cup

I scaled this recipe to "12" servings and baked it in my bread machine.  It made exactly 12 good sized slices [we use an electric slicer], an equivalent of 1.5 pound bread.  It is delicious.  Thank you.

This is the only whole wheat bread you will ever need.  I used 5 cups of wheat flour and 3 cups of white flour.  A hint to new bread makers, add the flour one cup at a time, don't just dump the flour in all at once.  I made this bread in my Kitchen Aide mixer so there is no need to knead the dough on a flat surface by hand.  This bread is really good........

The greatest bread. Has anyone tried to use a bread maker to do this? I would love to see the process/results for that.

A wonderful bread; however, another reviewer says that she froze the dough after the first rise, then thawed, let it rise for the final time and baked. This did NOT work for me. The thawed dough never did rise, so I had to discard it. A better option is to go ahead and bake all three loaves and then freeze the bread. The bread freezes and thaws nicely.

I make bread by large batches (6-8 loaves at a time) regularly and have experimented unsuccessfully to make good ww bread, not just good white bread.  I added a little more honey than the recipe said (eyeballed it), used ww bread flour and used 5 cups of that and about 3 of white bread flour, and added 2 heaping TBSP of vital wheat gluten, but otherwise didn't change anything else.  My bread came out very soft and moist.  It's a more dense bread, but not heavy or crumbly and makes for excellent sandwiches.  Use good and as fresh of flour as possible and let it rise!  Let it rise until doubled, punch it down, let it rise again, then degas, let it rest 10 mins or so, then shape, rise again, and finally bake.  The more time you take the better it will taste.  Also, make sure to do the window pane test to make sure the gluten is well developed to ensure the right texture (while kneading, stretch a section thin; if it can get very transparently thin without ripping, it's ready.  Also the dough will get nice and smooth looking).  This will be my go-to recipe to base off of for ww bread.  It would probably even make nice white bread or rolls.

This bread is fabulous!  I did cut the recipe by one-third so I could make just one loaf.  I accidentally goofed and added 2 tbsp of oil instead of the 1 tbsp melted butter (completely misread the recipe!), but it still turned out great.  I also mixed and kneaded the dough in my bread machine, which worked really well.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is an amazing recipe.  As followed, you get fluffy, wonderful loaves.  This bread rises quite a bit in the oven, so don't fret if it rises to just barely above the pan in the 2nd rise.  I usually make two loaves and a batch of dinner rolls (which I freeze before the last rise).   We've experimented with this recipe quite a bit and it is super resilient.  I just made rye bread with it by subbing rye flour for the whole wheat and molasses for the honey.  Turned out great!  I've also varied the ratio of bread flour to whole grain flour, and it rises perfectly every time!

I was looking for a fast and easy recipe for whole wheat bread. I came across this one and gave it a try. I added some flax seeds, sunflower seeds and some oatmeal and just baked two loaves and they turned out really nice. I used my KitchenAid too which helped.

Great bread recipe. I changed it a bit... instead of three cups of water, I added 2 cups of water and 1 cup of scalded milk that had been cooled.  I just really like the taste of milk and honey.  I also added a bit more salt and used rapid rise yeast and added some wheat germ to the top for some crunch.  Very delicious!

I've been making this bread for about 3 months now. I have experimented with a lot of different ways. The biggest thing I think could make the recipe not turn out well is the first step. I did it that way the first time, but my dough never got fluffy. Now I mix the yeast, water, and 1/3 cup honey and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then stir in the 5 cups flour. Then follow the rest of the recipe.

Very good starter recipe. But I ended up using  less whole wheat flour then called for. If you leave the dough more sticky it will produce a softer, fluffier bread. Also it will be more moist. Thanks from Brazil

Great recipe! I have been experimenting with making my own bread for a while and I was consistently failing and becoming increasingly frustrated! This recipe is perfect and the end product can't be beat by anything you'd get at the store. The first time I made this recipe I followed it to the letter and it turned out quite well. I only have one loaf pan, however, so I freeze the other two dough balls after the first rise. Then when you're ready to bake them you just put them in the loaf fan and let them defrost and then rise before you bake them as usual. I have made this using honey and I have also substituted sugar when I found my honey supplies low and they both turned out excellent. I do recommend adding at least 3 cups of the wheat flour before you turn the dough out onto your mat for less of a mess. I also am not fortunate enough to have a stand mixer so I knead the dough by hand. It will take you at least 20 min. to get it properly kneaded. Good luck!

GREAT sandwich bread!  Don't make a full recipe if you don't have a HUGE mixing bowl.  To really get that yeast doing its job, mix half the water, all of the yeast, and the first round of "sugar," pre-heat oven to WARM for 20 SECONDS (then turn oven off), pop the liquid in the oven for roughly 10 minutes...the mixture should have doubled at this point.  Done this way, it shouldn't matter if your water isn't warm enough.  Add the yeast mixture into the flour and then combine with the rest of the warm water.  I use the pre-heat to WARM for 20 SECONDS technique every time I do a rise...this ensures a good rising environment every time, no matter what the weather is like.  If you are freezing the dough at all, be sure to give it LOTS of rise time upon taking out of the freezer.  It typically won't do much rising until it's room temp.  Then, do the pre-heat trick.  Patience tends to be the one ingredient that most people attempting to bake bread lack!  Also, this is a very soft, sticky dough; you really don't need to add too much extra flour beyond what the recipe lists.  I've done this using 100% whole wheat flour and it still turns out great...soft, fluffy, delicious bread, perfect for making samiches!

Great bread recipe! I have made it twice now, and I think it is a keeper! The only thing I have changed, is I use 100% hard white wheat that I grind myself. Since it is a lighter wheat, I have been able to use 100% and it is not too heavy. I also used 4 tablespoons of gluten as recommended by one of the review on here if you are using all wheat. The only negative thing I have to say is, it is a little too much dough for my kitchen aid mixer, but I like the fact that it make 3 loves at a time, that is enough bread to last us all week. We have even eaten this bread a week later and it was not dry and still good, this really surprised me.

Awesome!!  Delicious & easy.  Got great results.  This is now my base recipe for my husband's lunch-box!  I added sesame and sunflower seeds.  I also ommited the butter & used 6 T. ground flax seeds with 2 T water added (basic oil repacement ratio with flax).  It is wonderful. Also, followed the advice of another review and used only 2 bread pans.  Perfect sandwich size loaves.  Thank-you for sharing this great recipe!  Now if only we could get more non bread machine recipes on this site!! ;)

This recipe bakes off for a fine wheat bread but it is titled Whole Wheat Bread.  It is not a whole wheat bread!  Whole wheat bread is made from 100% whole wheat flour.  This should be titled Wheat Bread.

This bread is of the perfect moisture and taste!  I cut the recipe to 2/3 to make two loaves, and instead of brushing top with butter, I sprinkled some oatmeals.  The crust came out perfectly.

Prior to making this bread I had tried many other whole wheat breads from this site but always kept with the Whole Wheat Honey Bread recipe. This recipe has changed my mind! The Honey Wheat Bread is still a favorite, but this one is far more simple in ingredients and gives me 3 loaves!! I use all whole wheat flour and add 1T of wheat gluten per cup of flour.

Sooooo good!  I love the texture and flavor of this bread.  I only made a few changes.  Instead of honey I use 1/2 cup of sugar (because I'm a poor college student) and I substitute applesauce for all of the butter.  The applesauce mades the bread more moist and also healthier.  Last, I use 5 cups of wheat flour and 3 cups of white because I like more wheat in my bread.  Overall, a very, very good bread recipe.

I only made one loaf, and I doctored the recipe a bit. I added 3 T of flaxseed and about 2 t brown sugar (in addition to the honey). I also added about a T gluten. The loaf turned out great, with a not-too-dense crumb. I wish I had let it rise three times instead of two, because I think it could have been even less dense. I really like the taste though, and the recipe is indeed easy.

Best, softest bread recipe I've ever tried.  I only made two loaves because my pans are bigger than hers, but it is still amazing.  The whole family adored it.  Perfect for sandwiches, toast, anything.  Note that she says *bread* flour; if you don't have bread flour, sift your all-purpose flour before using.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  

I used only about 1/2 the honey and skipped the butter topping, and we didn't miss it at all.  

Since this was a test run, I made exactly half the recipe.  In order to test the versatility of the recipe, I used most of the dough for a loaf of bread, and the remainder I made into one dinner roll and 3 hamburger buns.  All were great.

Be sure to grease the pans liberally.  I sprayed one pan liberally and one lightly.  The rolls baked on the lightly sprayed surface were difficult to remove and were damaged in the process.  But the loaf, in the liberally-sprayed pan, came out neatly after I ran a knife around the end of the loaf.  

This worked well as a sandwich bread.   Suprisingly, it did not toast well, possibly due to the moisture that makes it a good sandwich bread.  It will be interesting to see if the drier leftovers will toast better and/or make good croutons, although there are plenty of other breads for that.

good bread, tasted kind of like something they would serve at a restaurant maybe? I will definately make this again. It didnt turn out perfect but I think that was just because it was my first time making bread. made one loaf into cinnamon raisin bread by after punching it back down rolling it out sprinkling with water enough to make a thin film of paste across it but not enough to run or drip and then rubbed on brown sugar I made a solid layer but I definitely will use more next time- too much will probably be just enough! You couldnt see the swirl or really taste it... just looked like random rasin bread!(just sprinkled a generous amount of raisins on top of sugar then folded longer side over just a little then tightly rolled from left to right tucking edges under positioned loaf) but still good just the same! Easy wonderful recipe! couldn't stop eating it!

This is THE best wheat bread ever! Not at all difficult and its very good for slicing for sandwiches, toast etc.  The problem with many loaves is they dont slice well, but this does! My family loves it and I have made it many times!

Fantastic baseline wheat recipe and now it's shared in my bread classes as a great whole wheat recipe.  I even invert the flour amounts and add 4T wheat gluten for variety.

Yes you can use less honey and it still comes out great.  The honey helps with pliability and resistance to mold.  This loaf can keep a full week on the shelf in a bag.  If your loaves don't rise on the second time look at the temperature and the  yeast.  It can take a couple to 3 hours to rise a loaf if the bread and room are cold.  If too hot it will kill the yeast before it develops the gas bubbles in the dough and you get a rock.  Development of crust too early in the raise can have the same effect.

Let me say first that I am a complete novice baker. No, beyond that, I'm a baking idiot. I have never made bread before, but I wanted to try in an effort to save some grocery money and reduce the amount of preservatives and other assorted  one finds in store-bought bread in my diet. But I know nothing of the yeasty mysteries of bread making. Which is why I know that this bread's failure to rise was all my fault. I am giving this recipe 5 stars because even though mine came out flat and dense, it tastes like heaven.   The first two rising times went just fine, but when I put it in the pan to let it rise the third time, it rose only so far and then sort of deflated. Are there any experienced bakers who might know where I went wrong? Again, the flavor of this bread is amazing, and we are certainly going to eat it. And I will try, try again!

YES!!!  Finally a honey wheat bread recipe I love!  Remember to knock on the top to check for doneness: it's done when the knock sounds hollow.  Also, you can just rub the butter stick on the top of warm bread instead of melting it ahead of time.

I have made this bread a few times now and It comes out great each time, the people that complain about it being two dense may have some of the following issues: your yeast is old, you dont use bread flour or you are over/underproofing your dough. I have figured out that bread is an art as well as a science and this bread, along with all the others takes patience. The part when you mix in the rest of the flour is where I have found most of my trouble, the perfect consistency comes and goes in an instant, for the beginnners add 1/4 cup of flour at a time, be sure to add less flour towards the end so you dont incorperate too much flour making the loaf too dry. even when my bread came out funny they still tasted great and went to good use for something else!

I am a first time bread maker.  I made two large loaves instead of the three smaller ones. I followed the recipe but did do what one other person did and replace one of the 1/3 Cup honey with molasses and put in about 1/3 cup ground flaxseed. I used the 5 cups of bread flour and all in all, probably added about 3 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour.  My loaves are beautiful looking but the bread seems dense to me.  When you are kneading the bread, which I did by hand, (I have no machine) it pulled away from the board and did not stick to it and when I divided the dough after the first rise it was very "elastic-ie."  I had to twist the two pieces apart to make into loaves.  Maybe the bread isn't too dense - I have never made bread before so I am not sure. The taste is wonderful, however, my main concern is the density/texture.    OK tried this again and this time loaves came out like bricks.  Followed exact recipe.  To me, this is NOT a fool proof recipe and I am moving on to another.

This is the first recipe I ever felt the need to review.  I used 4 cups of whole wheat and 1 cup white to start, then added the other white flour later.  This was soooo moist and yummy.  The three loaves were made into one braided loaf, a dozen little bread balls (that I covered with garlic salt before baking) and one loaf bread that I put basil, salt, pepper, minced onions and garlic on before baking to make an "everything" loaf.  It all tastes great! Thanks.

I had never made "real" bread before, but was attracted to this recipe because it's been called a very forgiving recipe. I followed it exactly and it was the most delicious bread I've ever had in my life. I am definitely hooked. Thanks Nita for giving us this recipe!

I was out of honey so I subbed brown sugar and it worked fine.  I only got two big loaves and  a few rolls out of the recipe.  But I found my family's new sandwich bread!  This bread stays fresh and fluffy on the countertop and has a really good flavor.  It's also deceptively filling for its overall lightness.  Thank you!

Not a simple recipe. I cooked my loaves for 40 minutes and they still weren't done, so I ended up feeding the birds outside with it. 

The second step was very confusing. My bread was not very sticky so I didn't add that much more flour, and then they didn't rise as much as they should have.

Wow, that was good! I was nervous because the dough seemed overly dry while I was mixing it, and not all of the wheat flour was able to get incorporated. I decided to leave it alone though and continue with the recipe, and it turned out very well. Also, I didn't get to add all of the honey because I ran out early, but still turned out wonderfully. I froze one loaf after the first rise, so I am interested to see how that will turn out. I can't wait to make this again.

Great!  Has a similar taste/texture to store bought sandwich bread... only fresher and more delicious.  I will keep tinkering with this as I tried to scale the recipe to two loaves and they were much to small for sandwich bread.

I have never written a review before nor have I ever made bread. This is why I felt compelled to write a review. This bread is fool-proof! I wasn't sure how long to knead or wait for it to rise and it all just worked out. I ended up kneading for about 7-8 minutes and I let it rise the first time for about an hour and a half and then after separating into pans (I froze one) I let it rise for another two hours.  It probably could've been done much faster but we had a busy afternoon. I also added 1 cup of oats.  Fantastic bread- my kids (5 and 6) loved it! I will make this again and again and probably never buy  sandwich bread again.

This is a great whole wheat recipe.  I love my bread jam-packed full of nutty flavors so I do adjust it to have half of the honey, have never added butter, and I add any seeds/oats that I have around.  I always find that it helps to add the first 4 ingredients and let them set covered with a damp towel for a half hour before continuing on because it allows the breads proteins to connect to form a strong elasticity before adding all of the seeds that will block those connections in the later rise.  I make this bread at least once a week.

How can you call this 'whole wheat' when more than half of the flour is white flour???  We tried the recipe with all wheat flour, and it turned out great!  My mom loved it because the gluten developed quickly, which required less kneading.  It wasn't QUITE as yummy as I was hoping, so I may try some more bread recipes on this site to find my favorite.

This bread makes great sandwich bread - the loaf stays together well when cutting.  It also makes great toast!  :)

so simple!  both simple to make and simple tasting.  it is a forgiving dough, so don't worry too much... just give it lots of time to rise and you'll have a wonderful bread.  i didn't put honey in this, i just put a little sugar in when proofing the yeast (1/3 cup).  ENJOY!

Just finished baking and WOW, oh my! Perfect texture, flavor - just plain PERFECT loaves. Only had about 1/4 c. of honey on hand, so added about 3 Tbsp. brown sugar at step 2 instead of the additional honey. Otherwise followed recipe exactly, except realized afterward that I added only 3 c. whole wheat flour to the mixing bowl. I worked in at least 1/2 cup w/w flour during kneading though, so the end result was right regardless. Note: This made two loaves in 9x5 pans, not three (followed other reviewers' advice). Thank you for sharing this 5++ star bread recipe!! Already looking forward to making it again. :)

This is amazing! I forgot to put in the second 1/3 cup of honey and this still turned out SO GOOD! I'll definitely keep making this and I think I'll stick with the reduced honey. When they cool, I'll freeze one to see how well it holds up. Also, I may try increasing the amount of WW flour just to see how it tastes. Thank you!!!

This bread is amazing! It was my first attempt at homemade bread and it turned out wonderfully! It's also very forgiving, as I had a sick toddler and had to leave the dough at several points. I will definitely be making this again!

our YFriends will ALL ask for this recipe...NOTE for freezing/thawing. Freeze after the first rise and punch down. I freeze in separate containers/bags in 3 equal "ball" forms. Thaw in fridge for 24 hours. When ready, allow the dough time to come to room temp. and actually start rising a bit. Gently press out air, shape into rectangle, roll up, pinch sides and seam and then place into greased pan. I have found this the be the best way to use the frozen dough. MAKE SURE TO ALOT THE EXTRA TIME to come to room temp...dont make the mistake I did by taking out at 9pm thinking to have fresh am bread...I was up till after 1:00am!!! Ha..was excellent though. I also have added the brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins before rolling up. Magnificent!!

Wonderful tasty bread- when making it I thought it was a bit too much honey because I don't like sweet bread, but it tasted great.  It also had just the right amount of salt.  I even used all purpose flour instead of the bread flour and it still turned out perfect.

Wonderful bread.  Soft and chewy with a great crust.  To make the bread more hearty, I added 1/4 cup flax seed and a few handfuls of walnuts.  For one loaf I also rolled the top in sesame seeds before its final rise - its to die for. I had trouble with the bread sticking so make sure you grease your pans well.

I'm giving this bread 5 stars because I can tell it has the potential to be wonderful.  The texture was awesome, I've just never made bread before so I had 1 problem with it.  Could use some advice if anyone has any....The bread had an INCREDIBLY harsh alcoholic scent and flavor.  Since I'm new at making bread, I was wondering if anyone has a simple answer to what causes this.   Here's what I did...I cut the recipe in half so I used only 1 packet of yeast.  I ran out of honey so I used only half honey and then a little bit of molasses.  The water may have been a little too cool when I dissolved the yeast in it.  I let it rise, punched it down, then let it do the rest of the rising over night in the fridge (as a dough ball).  I pulled it out, let it warm up so it could rise again in the loaf pans.  It took a couple of hours to warm up and rise.  Then I cooked it for 25 min each, I put one loaf in the oven at a time.  When it was finished I brushed butter over the top and immediately removed it from the pan to cool.  My husband still liked and ate it, but the aftertaste was a little too harsh for me.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'm new to the site so if there's a way to email me, feel free!  Thanks :)

I made this bread for the first time today, and I am pretty pleased with the results.  I followed the recipe almost completely; the only changes I made were adding 4 T. powdered gluten like one reviewer suggested, and I also brushed the tops of each loaf with some egg wash and then sprinkled them with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and flax seed.  This recipe was easy to follow and makes an excellent textured sandwich bread.  I may play around with the ingredients a bit next time, adding molasses in place of some of the honey, and maybe a bit more wheat flour and less bread flour, simply because I like a heartier wheat bread.  Overall, I am very impressed with the tuexture of this bread, because unlike some homemade ones I've made, it is light and chewy. Great recipe!

This is a great whole-wheat bread recipe by itself. But, I modified it just to suit my own habit and taste: (1) Dissolved yeast in 1/2 cup warm water; (2) Used 2-1/2 cups warm milk, or 1 cup dry milk dissolved in 2-1/2 cups warm water; (3) Added 3 eggs; (4) Subbing molasses for honey, and oil for butter; (5) Stirred in some raisins; (6) Used more whole-wheat flour than it was called for due to the addition of eggs. As a result, my loaves turned out to be darker than those made with honey, and the taste of molasses was just right. They're absolutely fabulous! Happy baking!

WOW! this bread is AWESOME! I've made it twice before, but didn't try any until now...I don't like wheat bread but this is GREAT! I used two pans instead of 3 for sandwich-sized bread, hubby's request, and baked for 35-40 minutes...came out perfect...I also discovered that when kneading the 2-4 cups of wheat flour into the dough, 2.5 works best for me...hope that helps someone...I will be making this again...probably in a few days the way I'm eating it!

I made in my bread machine (dry ingred first) and it was great.  Pull out and butter loaf before it cools. I love making from scratch and often do but sometimes..No Time!  Thanks!

Absolutely yummy. I followed many of the reviewers advice and I'm adding some of my own.

1. I used oil in the dough instead of margarine
2. I used the wet yeast because I didn't have dry yeast. Basically I put all the cups of the regular flour in a bowl and made a whole in the center. I crumbled up the yeast, sprinkled a tiny drop of sugar (to activate the yeast) and used 1 of the three cups of warm water and poured it over the yeast - waited until it bubbled and then poured the rest of the water and honey etc and mixed the mixture. Do NOT use your hands this will not be a dough it will be a sticky, gooey mess(which is ok) waited again until it became big and bubbly about 20-30 minutes as the recipe suggested.  Then continued according to the recipe. 
3. I brushed the top of the bread with egg so when the bread was ready it had a golden color on top
4. I brushed the tops (AND, the sides) with margarine - I wasn't thrilled to use margarine but it really helps the bread not get dry.
5. I made three loaves and 1 little roll for my son to try. He gobbled it up!

I was really excited to make this based on all the glowing reviews.  I had to slightly tweak things as I only had enough yeast, etc. for one loaf.  Maybe my measurements were a little off, but I can't think it would have mattered THIS much.  The bread was REALLY dense and left a strange aftertaste.  Husband, who's been begging me to make bread for weeks, only ate a slice.  Said it tasted like there was something missing . . . ended up throwing half the loaf away.

We'll keep looking, but appreciate the attempt (and my apartment smelled delightful, which makes it worth trying in itself ;)).

Great bread!  The most difficult task is waiting for the dough to rise, and aside from that, a trusty Kitchen Aid or a pair of willing hands is all you need for a wonderful snack. 3 loaves is a bit much for a single person, but it keeps well in the fridge (and from what I've read here, the freezer as well).  I used solely whole wheat flour and left out all of the butter to eliminate the fat from this recipe and it came out beautifully.  Next time, I'll leave out all the honey (I put that on my toast after the fact anyway) and cut the recipe in a third to make a great, lower calorie bread that's perfect for a quick carb meal.

I am definitely an amateur but this recipe turned out great!  I altered the recipe a little--I added a little dough enhancer and some gluten and I only used 2 cups of white flour (the rest was wheat).  The bread was light yet solid and oh so delicious.

Best whole wheat bread I've had.  Nice sweet taste to it.  If you've made bread from scratch before this is about the same technique, gets easier everytime.

I have been using this recipe for a while with great success.  I never have to use any more than 5c plus 2c of flour and usually get three perfect loaves, and though the ingredient list calls for 1/3 c honey and the method tells you to add it twice - I only add the 1/3c.  I wanted to share though, today I decided to use the Richard Bertinet method of working the dough, and oh my gosh the difference.  My bread is almost ready to come out of the oven, and it is twice as big as usual.  My loaves are HUGE!  They are almost touching the top burner, and they kind of stuck together because I didn't space them enough for that amount of growth in size, and I've had to move them apart.  I will probably be able to get 4-5 loaves with the same recipe just because of his method.  If you haven't tried it.  youtube it and give it a go.  If you are looking for a fluffier lighter loaf this is probably the answer.

Excellent! I let my yeast prove before adding the first addition of flour. I use all purpose four as that is what I have on hand (4 cups + 1 cup whole wheat) for the 2nd addition of flour I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup mixed oats (usually some combo of oats, ground flax, flax seed, sunflower seeds).

Best bread recipe I've found!  My wife was ready to give up on making bread until I found this one and now she can't get enough!

I changed the recipe to make a single loaf and then I make this in my bread maker.  It turns out great.  My modified recipe for the bread maker is as follows:

1 cup warm water (100 F/45 C)
2 tbl. honey
1 1/2 tsp. active yeast

Put in bread machine and let sit for 20-30 minutes while yeast proofs

1 tbl. butter, melted
1 tbl. honey
1 tsp. salt
2 c. bread flour
1 c. whole wheat bread flour

Add remaining ingredients to bread machine and run on 1.5 lb, wheat setting.

I actually remove it from the bread maker before the final rise and bake it in the oven because I prefer the shape of the loaf, but I'm sure it would bake just fine in the machine as the dough turns out great when made in the machine.

Great for beginners! This is the first time I've ever made bread that wasn't for dessert. 

I used all whole wheat flour, so it didn't rise as much, but I wanted to stay true to the "whole wheat" label. It's still delicious though, and is plenty lofty, for anyone who is contemplating doing the same. 

As a college student, honey is expensive, so instead I measured the same amount of brown sugar and made a simple syrup. Cheaper, and gives a deeper flavor.

I'm still figuring out rising times, how much to knead, etc. But as a newcomer to the breadmaking realm, I'm very happy with this recipe. It's easy to replicate, and very adaptable to your own spin!

Unbelievably easy! I used regular white flour because that's all I had and it STILL came out like store bought bread! My family has requested I make the bread from now on and it's really not a complicated process so I don't think I'll ever buy bread again! Trying it with wheat flour next!

My first attempt was horrible for some reason. The dough was super stiff and just didn't feel right. After baking in an 8x4 loaf pan for 25 minutes, I took it out only to find the inside was still raw and the whole bread texture was tough. I figured I must have measured the water amount or honey amount wrong. On the second try, I did a sort of poolish pre-ferment with 160g water, 160g flour, 1 tsp yeast, and 1 tbsp honey: 2 hours on the countertop in a chilly house, followed by 8 hours in the fridge. No reason for the time...I was just so tired at 3 AM! The next morning, after double checking all my ingredients, I added the remaining ingredients and proceeded with the recipe (though my smaller pan needed to bake for 43 minutes) and boy was it spectacular! It was soft, chewy, slightly sweet, slightly nutty. I didn't brush any extra butter, but I'm sure looking forward to adding additional ingredients to future loaves for textural contrast. I knew the AllRecipes community was right!

I scaled this recipe down to two loaves and added 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten to help with the rise.  Baked for 28 minutes.  This bread is delicious!  My family loved it.  Thanks for sharing, Nita.

Wish I could add to the 5-star rating, but I can't.  While the flavor was fine the second rising wasn't.  It wouldn't rise any higher after the punch-down than 1/2 an inch and certainly didn't rise any higher in the oven.  I tried twice.  Moving on.

This bread is very good.  Followed to the letter and have made it twice so far.  Has come out great both times.  I will comment that the bread is a bit dense in texture, but I like that in this bread. Very tasty and easy.

This is definatly going to be a constant bread made now! The texture came out perfect, and it was delicious. Only next time I'm going to add even less sweetener, overall, I thought the sweetness was the only thing dragging it down.
I used more whole wheat flour then called for, it didn't make as much as I expected, so next time I'll have to double it. My family is very large so three little loaves didn't last very long.

This bread came out great. I wish i could taste the honey a bit more but it was delicious. It was heaven when it came straight out of the oven with a piece of sharp cheddar cheese. Will definitely make again and try to get it to all whole wheat when i perfect this recipe. Thanks!!

I used this as a last minute recipe.. I generally am no good at making bread, but I was making soup and really wanted some. All I had was boring ol' white flour, and (don't laugh) I used maple syrup because I didn't have any honey. Scaled this down to 2/3 the actual recipe, and make rolls in cupcake pans. It actually worked! And my bread is good. :) Thanks!

I love this recipe, the bread comes out perfect with a soft texture better than store bought sandwich bread, the loaves rise beautifully, and the bread tastes heavenly. I wouldn't substitute the honey with sugar, because I think it would take away the taste.

Loved it! Got lazy and used my bread machine :) works like a charm. Since my favorite bread went up on price, this will be my go-to for now and add flax seeds next time. Great for toast. Also, I halved the recipe and used a 9x5 bread pan.

AMAAZZINNNGGG!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS BREAD!! It is delicious! The first time I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and it was DELICIOUS! The second time I decided to go out and buy the bread flour, try it, and I WILL NEVER GO BACK! Bread flour really adds to it and makes it so light and airy and such a delicious bread. Never think twice about NOT making this bread...i would make it every day if i had the time....DELICIOUS!

Just delicious!  I halved the recipe and used my Wilton long loaf pan.  I made the dough in my bread machine with no special directions like the recipe listed.  Just put it all in there and let 'er rip.  Made a perfect loaf in the long pan.  Will make again!

These instructions are great. The flavor and texture of this loaf are just what we were looking for. I had been using the 'no knead' method to make a bunch of different kinds of breads, looking for a good sandwich loaf--slightly sweet, tough enough to hold up in the sandwich setting, and not too tough in the crust. This loaf delivers. I did as another reviewer suggested--making two loaves instead of three from the listed ingredients. It made a perfect sandwich sized loaf. I changed nothing. I may try later with a higher percentage of whole wheat flour, but this recipe and method rocks. I used my kitchenaid for the mixing and kneading, then I finished kneading by hand, divided into two loaves, and baked them off. Hubby is very pleased. I may not go back to no-knead. :)

This turned out beautifully and made the whole apartment smell wonderful.  I don't think I can ever go back to store bought bread again.  This is one of the most delicious breads that I have tasted and I am proud to say that it came from my kitchen and was of my own doing.  Thank you for such a great recipe.  This bread is great all by itself or with a little butter and/or jelly.

Great bread.  I've never made bread before, but this turned out perfect.  I added about a 1/2 cup of oats with the wheat flour, and it is very hearty.

Wow!  So delicious!  I added 6 Tbl. of vital wheat gluten and substituted 2 cups of white flour with 2 cups of dry 6 grain cereal.  It turned out perfectly, and my family ate 1 1/2 loaves during dinner tonight.  Yum!

This was wonderful - texture and taste. Took the advice to add the gluten, but it took me longer than 25 minutes to bake. I really should have taken the internal temp and not gone by the time on the clock.

Perfect wheat bread recipe. I made two tall loaves with this recipe (in regular sized bread pans) instead of three regular size. Same baking time. Worked out wonderfully!

Oh my gosh!  So good!  I only have 2 glass loaf pans so I changed the servings to 24 and followed the recipe as well as I could with the change in amounts.  I only have jarred yeast so I looked online and ended up using 1.5 tsp. At the last step before baking I put the 2 loaves in the fridge overnight (covered with some saranwrap) so I would have fresh bread in the morning (felt like making the dough at night) and the dough still finished rising beautifully and baked up so great this morning.   A huge hit!

I have been baking bread for several decades now, so when I say that this is the only one I make anymore, it's a big deal at my house!  We love it, just the way it is written, no changes.  If I switch to another recipe, just for a change, there are loud complaints!  A truly terrific recipe.

This has become my staple bread recipe in the house. I have tried several, but this one is #1 for the easiest and tastiest. It also adapts well. I often times use 100% organic white whole wheat (to satisfy my husband's silly fear of brown wheat) and it's terrific that way, too. I also make dinner rolls out of it, freezing them on a baking tray at the shaping stage and then putting them in freezer bags to bake at a later time.   The only thing I change in the directions is that I allow the yeast-water-honey to sit for 10 minutes before adding the 5 cups of bread flour. To me (and it could just be me) it gives the dough a better rise.

I made this simple bread recipe with just all whole wheat flour and made rolls out of it. They came out wonderful. I had to use a little less flour than it calls for since I used only wheat flour. I also just used oil instead of butter. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks to the one who posted it.

I used agave nectar to give this bread a lower Glycemic Index rating.  I bake it for the full 30 minutes.  To brush the crust with butter I use a wadded up paper towel, this way I don't use too much butter.  I halve the recipe to make only one large loaf, but if I let it rise in the pan for too long it doesn't fit in the toaster.  My KitchenAid mixer isn't powerful enough to handle the full recipe.  I've made this recipe at least twenty times now, and it always turns out better than anything bought at the grocery store.  My husband and toddler son can't get enough of it.

This is a great basic bread recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly as listed.  I made 2 batches(6 loaves), they were both excellent.  I did try to use my stand mixer to mix the dough, but there was just too much of it.  I ended up just using the mixer to, well, mix.  I added all the ingredients as listed, and used about 2/3rds the total flour.  I then kneaded the rest in by hand.    To freeze:  Wrap bread in plastic wrap completely.  Then wrap in foil.  The bread will last frozen for a good 6 months.  To defrost, just let it sit out until thawed.

I have been using this recipe for about 6 months and love it.  I cut the bread flour down to 2 1/2 cups and replace the other 2 1/2 cups with whole wheat.  I also add 3/4 to 1 cup of flax meal for a little extra fiber.  Last time I made this I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of cinnamon into the initial flour before mixing into the yeast, water and honey.  It certainly did not make it taste like cinnamon bread, but it gave it a very light, unique twist.  The cinnamon really just took the whole wheat edge off and made it a wee bit 'sweeter'.  It's still absolutely suitable for sandwich use.  Great recipe to use as a base.  (I have also replaced the butter with EVOO to make the bread vegan for my sister)

I added 2 cups of breakfast cereal that I purchased at Costco. It is a medley of rolled oats, rye flakes, sunflower seeds, barley flakes and flax seed. I used this as I was out of whole wheat flour. I made 2 loaves and 8 buns for sandwiches for lunches. Super dee duper amazing!!!

I lost a recipe to make coconut bread, so I use this recipe with coconut milk.  I substituted 1 1/2 cup of water with coconut milk.  Taste really yummy and a healthy version of the original white coconut bread.

I have to agree with everyone else.  This is a fabulouse recipe!  I grew up with homemade bread and have my mother's recipe, which is similar, but the method here is slightly different.  I increased recipe for 4 loaves.  My last batch turned out just like the photo, in my convection oven.  Today I am adding 1 cup powdered milk as my mother's recipe suggests, and as I have read elsewhere for increasing nutritional value and preservation time.  I also add 1/2 cup wheat gluten with the second flour addition.  I plan to try 100% home ground whole wheat soon.  I really enjoy reading others' reviews and tips, esp. for freezing loaves for future baking.

This is so yummy. It's good as it is, although from where I am in Singapore, the recommended amount of water seems a little too much, so go slow on adding all the water to the dough - enough to make it a soft but not too sticky. Started including some oats and wheat germ to the recipe for increased fibre, the bread still turns out great. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this bread 4 or 5 times. I only use one cup of white flour-the rest whole wheat. It always is great and is easy (for yeast bread). The extra loaves keep well in the freezer. I also sometimes use molasses and/or agave nectar if I am out of honey.

IF you have a grain mill, this is something you have to try. In my mill I put 1/3 hard spring red wheat, 1/3 spelt, 1/3 soft white winter wheat. I am guestimating that the amount of each grain was around 1 cup (+).Ground it up and used 4.5 cups , added it to the water and followed instructions as it said. So, after the soaking phase where you add other flour, that is where I added my unbleached white bread flour. This recipe is amazingly easy and SOOOOO good. The oven spring was excellent.The flavour with those grains is just so good.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe! I used quick rise yeast which cut the preparation time in half and it still turned out perfect!

I love this recipe!!  I have just started making my own bread and this recipe is fool proof.  I use all whole wheat flour and skip the second amount of honey as I find it is too sweet with both amounts of honey.  I also make the dough into only 2 loaves as they make pretty little loaves if you divide them into 3.  This makes awesome buns too!

Great recipes! This is the best homemade bread I've made. I took one reviewer's suggestion and added cinnamon, sugar and raisins into a loaf,and it was better than cake. The other loaves were so good that my father in law (a chef) and my friend (a pastry chef) both said it was some of the best  bread they'd had. The initial starter took a little longer to rise for me (about 2 hours, even though it was in a v. slightly warm oven), but that's the only issue I had at all.

Used white whole wheat so it came out lighter in color than the picture shown, and absolutely delicious.  The texture is wonderful.  I also used evaporated cane juice (granulated, Bob's Red Mill)for the sweetener.  This recipe makes three perfect looking loaves.  I will definately use this recipe again!!

This recipe was really good! The only thing I changed with I used olive oil instead of butter. I will be making this, again and again. Also made one into pizza, worked out great!

Great, simple recipe. The flavor is perfect and works great for sandwiches and toast. I like the fact that it makes 3 loaves. I slice it, put wax paper between the slices, bag the loaves and then freeze them, so my family and I can just pull out what we need and don't waste any of it. It's so good, I don't even waste the ends - I toast them! My mom bakes bread every couple of days and I introduced her to this recipe and she hasn't gone back to the one she was using before. We both like the fact that it is soft and stays soft if stored properly. Thanks for the recipe - it's a definite keeper!

I've made many recipes from this site.  I have learned that experience improves the bread.  This recipe is one of the best 'wheat' recipes here.  My tip for you is to not add all the wheat flour listed here at first.  Instead after the dough has rested in the mixer with the water, honey, yeast, and bread flour turn it on, add the butter and salt.  I add 1/2 cup of wheat bran and 1/2 cup of wheat germ. Now begin adding wheat flour until it comes together. Now change to the dough hook and on speed 1 (no higher) kneed for 5-7 mins.  If the dough is just spinning on the hook you need a tablespoon of liquid.  It is OK for dough to be somewhat stickey but it should not sink to the bottom of the bowl when the mixer is shut off.  It should keep its shape.

Fabulous recipe!  I added 1 cup flax seeds, 1 cup sunflower seeds & 1 cup of mixed irish oats and whole wheat...had to add 1/4 cup extra water to get the right consistency but it came out moist and very flavorful!

This is an awesome recipe.  I use molasses instead of honey.  It seemed to rise better and give a better flavor.  I used 4 cups wheat and 1 cup white in the first step.  I make this constantly.  I've actually stopped buying any bread because of this recipe.  My kids devour it and I make it for about 65 cents a loaf.

Let me first say that I'm a rather accomplished cook who is challenged in only one area -- baking bread. I am terrible at following recipes exactly, being meticulous with measurements. But none of that was no matter -- this recipe turned out beautifully! I did follow the recipe exactly but probably was not perfect/exact with the measurements. This bread is amazing -- soft, chewy, tender -- a perfect sandwich loaf. 

I used the full 2/3 cup of honey and did not find the bread too sweet at all. I baked one loaf right away, froze another loaf after the first rise and shaping, and baked the 3rd loaf into dinner rolls and then froze them. I will definitely be making this a regular staple. Thank you!

This was my very first bread-making experience! I had made some cherry preserves one weekend and thought that it would taste better with homemade bread. I had never made bread before - not by hand or in a machine - and I was feeling daring, so I made the bread following this recipe. I was so shocked when I saw how beautiful and tasty it turned out! My wife says its even better than her mother's recipe. As you can guess, I am now making this recipe every Sunday and we've almost stopped buying store-bought bread altogether.

This past January 1st, I made a pact with myself that I would not buy a single loaf of bread in 2008.  So far, I have held to that pact; therefore, I have made many loaves of bread in the past five months.  I just used this recipe for the first time and it came in a close 2nd to my grandmother's old fashioned whole wheat bread recipe.  I made a few variations -- I substituted 1 T molasses for 1 T of the honey; I pulverized 1 cup whole oats in my food processor and substituted it for one cup of the bread flour; I added sunflower seeds and chopped almonds toward the end of the kneading process to add a little crunch.  I just took the bread from the oven and spread it with some butter -- excellent.  I will use this as a basic recipe and will make variations as I go along.

Absolutely delicious.  What a wonderful texture and taste!

I didn't follow the instructions exactly... The packets of yeast I had were a little bit bigger but I used 2 of them anyway. I let the yeast, honey, and water sit for 10 minutes until it was all foamy and then i mixed in the other ingredients and kneaded it and let it rise for an hour.  Then, since I only had one loaf pan-- i made 1/3 of the dough into a loaf of bread, 1/3 into rolls, and the other 3rd into bagels!  I just shaped the dough like bagels, boiled them, topped them, and stuck them in the oven-- absolutely wonderful whole wheat bagels!

This was so easy!  This is the first bread I have ever made that actually worked.  I have only tried making bread a couple times, and the last time was just a few days ago. I followed a recipe off the flour bag (whole wheat flour.) Not pretty!   ~ So I came here to find something good... and I found it.  The only things I did different is that I made 2/3 of the recipe for 2 loaves.  I also added two T. of wheat gluten because I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.
It raised perfectly, is not dense, and tastes good!
Tip  ~  When raising the bread, I turned the oven on for maybe 3 minutes, turned it off, then put a dish of hot water in the oven.  Then I put the dough in the oven. (It took about 45 minutes for each rise.)  I left the water in the oven while baking too.  Not sure if it made a difference or not.

Made this last week using a third of the dough for rolls, a third for a loaf and froze a third which I'll bake tomorrow.  Awesome recipe for chewey, moist bread that keeps that way for many days.  Will make this recipe often, perhaps adding ingredients such as wheat germ, millet, cracked wheat, etc.  Using the "bread flour" is key, I think.

This bread is fabulous!!!  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour and it turned out perfectly.  I also kneaded the dough in my kitchenaid with the dough hook for 5+ minutes and it was so fast and easy.  This makes delicious sandwich bread.

I scaled this down to make one loaf and wished I hadn't as had to make another one today. Which by the way is nearly all gone. Great recipe easy to make and tastes really good. Thanks.

This was okay, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.  In fairness, I substituted 2 cups of white flour for 2 extra cups of wholemeal, as some of the other reviewers had done.  But I found the bread quite dense as a result.  I can really only use it for toast.  I think I'll give it one more shot, but stick with the 5 cups of white flour that the recipe calls for.

This bread was delicious! I have no complaints. I brushed butter on it when it came out of the oven and that made the crust really yummy. (I think I accidentally added a little more salt too, which made it good.) Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the best wheat bread I've made. I didn't have honey so I substituted brown suger and it worked just fine. I think the taste from the sugar was actually better then when i tried honey in other recipes. Will definately make again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I got a new mixer for Christmas and decided to make bread from scratch for the first time (yikes)! This recipe is AWESOME!! My husband and I have nearly eaten half a loaf and it's still warm.  I'll definitely make it again - and again.

I think the name is misleading. Step 2 was very messy. The mixing method was different. Almost threw it in the trash at this point. Overall the taste is good. Still moist on the second day. Taste great with honey. Do again? I don't think so.

I agree with others this is foolproof.  Hate to buy bread because of the soy licithin that is in every bread available.  Won't have to buy it again.  I did add extra local honey we love the flavor. Will be making this from now on.  Thank you!

This bread makes excellent sandwiches, toast, crouton - everything! I do half honey and half sugar in this recipe. I also add oats, flax seeds and sunflower seeds to my bread to make it extra tasty. This has been my bread recipe for the last year and my husband and I can't get enough.

I made this today after school.  First of all, for bread, this is a pretty quick recipe.  I have an electric oven which most of the time I'm not thrilled with, but I turned the oven on twice during the cycle of making this bread, lowered the temperature to 170 degrees.  It would not go any lower.  I would leave it on for about 5-10 minutes inbetween the stages of making the bread rise and then turn it off.  The warmth made the dough rise nicely.  I've never seen a recipe where you add flour after it's already been rising and I was very sceptical of it turning out okay.  It was delicious!  I did not alter anything and used about one extra cup of wheat flour besides the two you are supposed to add in.  This one is a keeper and the best part is that it makes a lot of bread!  You could probably freeze  a loaf and eat later, but I'm not really sure.  I baked it for about 27 minutes and perhaps it could have gone the full 30 minutes.

Everyone that's tried it has loved this bread. I found that after putting it into loaf pans it takes double the time to rise, but that's probably because I add oats and flax seed to the recipe.

If you want to add walnuts, oats, flax, whatever, I add them when you add the first two cups of whole wheat flour. The added ingredients tend to soak up a lot of the moisture and you don't want to be stuck with bone-dry dough.

Easy. Just take one step at a time. I did run out of honey and subbed sugar for more than half of the honey. I made 3 large loaf and 3 mini loaves and adjusted the baking time a little bit.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have never made homemade bread before and this was extremely easy and tasty to make. My entire family loves this bread. My three year old requests this for dessert! My six year old told me not to buy bread anymore that he just wants this bread. Definitely a keeper.

Just finished making this bread. I used my kitchen aid to knead the dough. It was so easy. Thanks to the reviewer's tip about speed number and amount of time needed to knead on the Kitchen aid. Followed exact directions except brushed melted butter then cinnamon/sugar on top of 2 of the loaves before putting in oven to bake. Sliced them and will freeze one. This will definitely be my go to recipe for bread.  A great recipe, Nita. Thank you so much for sharing !!!

When it said you may end up adding 2-4 cups more of flour, I probably only added a cup and a half more at that point. I put a shallow layer of hot water in the sink in put the bowl and then the pan in the water when the dough was rising. I may divide the dough in 2 instead of 3 for bigger loaves next time. The bread turned out fluffy, soft, with just enough substance and sweetness. Really good stuff and directions were straight forward to follow.

I've decided to start making my own bread as a potentially healthier option for my family. I tried this recipe and it actually turned out amazing my first time. I followed the directions exactly and will continue to do so until I am a more experienced bread maker, but for a first timer, I highly recommend this recipe. Sweet, delicious and the stone ground whole wheat adds a little nutrition! Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread was GREAT!!! I used all whole wheat flour.  I also put it in 2 loaf pans instead of 3 to make it the size of sandwich bread from the store. The store stopped carrying the 100% whole wheat sandwich bread that we loved so I tried making this and will not buy store bought again.

Our favorite! I make a lot of bread and this recipe is great, the only change I made was to divide the dough into 2 loaves instead of 3 like the recipe says, I ended up with two beautiful chewy loaves of wheat bread.

You have to try this recipe! Delicious sweet loaf with a slight chewy texture. A suggestion, use 2 big bowls, mix all in first bowl, then after punching down dough and adding additional butter/honey, transfer to the kitchenaid mixer bowl for kneading. Wash the first bowl and brush/spray with oil for 2nd rise. The only thing I did different was using a kitchenaid mixer to knead the dough. I used the dough hook and kneaded the dough for about 3 mins at 1 and 2 speeds. As instructed on the recipe, you must add flour to prevent dough from sticking to your hands/dough hook. Use the 2 speed to pick up added flour on bottom of bowl and do stop the mixer and use a spatula to remove dough to "reset" the kneading. After brushing the baked bread with butter, I put the bread back into the oven for about a minute or so and that gave it a nice golden crust. As mentioned by another member, I also put the extra dough in the freezer to bake later. I baked it for 30 minutes for those wondering.

A neighbour told me that in order for her to get bread slices the size that you buy in the store she will make a recipe for 3 loaves but only split it between 2 pans.  Since this recipe said it made 3 loaves and the pictures in the video made the bread look rather flat, i thought this was the perfect recipe to try this tip out with.  during the 2nd rising phase, once they are in their pans they rose like CRAZY.  i thought it was gonna spill over but it didn't.  I just went ahead and baked it for the full time and it came out decent.  a tad chewy but I think if I baked it for maybe 5-10 min longer it would be perfect.  bread tastes good.  sweet but not overly so.  I will use less butter to top it with next time as I felt it to be a tad oily.

This was my first attempt at homemade bread and it turned out great! Very moist with a hint of sweetness from the honey. My family went through an entire loaf in less than 24 hours! I only used 2 1/2 cups of white flour instead of the 5 cups listed because I try to avoid white flour as much as possible.

This bread has turned out every time I have made it.  I have started rolling the loaves in flax seeds before I bake it.  I also used raw local honey for some extra health benefits.  I don't know if we'll ever buy bread again!

I made this recipe many times using the recipe as written then started modifying it (so the 5 stars is for both the original recipe and my modifications). My modifications: 3 cups white flour, 3 tsp yeast, 1/3 cup honey, 3 cups water - add to mixer (kind of like a kitchenaid), let proof for 30 minutes, then add 1 T salt, 3 T butter, and 5 to 5 and 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. Let the mixer knead it for ~8 min, then put in a greased bowl for an hour into a warmed oven (heated to about 100F), the cut into 4 equal chunks and roll into loaf shapes, then they go into the smaller size loaf pans (I have big ones that I've tried to make the 3 loaves the recipe states and the loaves are just too big). Back into warmed oven for ~45 min then turn oven on to 350F for 25 minutes. Everyone loves this bread!

Question: when this bread bakes, it gives off a vinegar smell when in oven.  Nothing is affected by this - bread tastes great etc.  Anyone know what might be causing this?  I used honey the first time, Agave the second - same result.  I do let yeast sit 10 minutes before I add flour, but that is "normal" for breads.  Any ideas?
Regardless, This is a great bread, very very easy.  I use Agave instead of honey, and increase whole wheat by 1 cup (and decrease bread flour by same).   Am still working to get it a bit more wheat flavored, but overall a great recipe.

Very good. I am very pleased with how this turned out. Next time i'll try adding various seeds. But in the meantime this is awesome! I did use less honey than called for. The first part I used a 1/4 and the second part not even that and it is still sweet but not overly.

So good! I made exactly as written. I think you do need 3 9x5 loaf pans- another review mentioned two was okay. I had a HUGE 9x5 loaf and a HUGE round loaf- like filling (and way over top of) a 9" cake pan. This is a perfect recipe, and I guess you could make it vegan by using something other than the butter. I make all of my own bread, and this will be my staple sandwich/etc. bread from now on.

Turned out great!  Very tasty warm with butter and honey! Good neutral flavor...not sweet and not too whole wheaty tasting. Feel good feeding it to my family because it doesn't have perservatives.  Put two loaves in freezer.

Double the recipe by using two large bowls. We mix and knead the dough in the bowls. Just coat the dough with wheat flour and keep the outside dry as you kneed it, that way your fingers don't get so sticky. Then we place them a warm oven (not hot!) to rise. When they're done, put them in zip-locks and freeze them. They come out perfect every time!

I love it! I'm new to making bread and have been looking for a good everyday recipe. This is it! My Cuisinart couldn't quite handle 3 loaves so I think I'll cut it down to 2 next time. Thanks!

I've been making this for the past few years and it's a great go-to recipe.  It makes three loaves, which is enough for our family for almost the entire week.  It makes wonderful sandwiches or toast and it stays soft for several days.  I've frozen the unbaked loaves but they don't rise as much (although they still make delicious loaves).  Now I just bake all three and wrap them tightly after they cool and they're ready for us later in the week when we need them--still as soft as the day they were baked.   I've swapped out the honey for white or brown sugar or a combination of them and it tastes just as good.  Fantastic recipe!

My second attempt at this bread turned out perfect!  Note to all beginners: the second rise took a really long time, pretty much all day.  I will be making this as our sandwich bread from now on.

I just started baking bread again after getting a KitchenAid stand mixer for Christmas. This is the third batch of this bread that I have made and everyone that I have shared it with loves it. Compared to other bread recipes I have experimented with, it is my husbands favorite. I took the advise of another review and increased the amount of whole wheat flour each time. For the last batch I only used 3 1/2 cups of white flour in the starter and added 5 cups of whole wheat before kneading with my mixer for about 5 minutes. I only add a half of cup of honey at the beginning because I do not like bread that is too sweet. Great for toast, sandwiches and with soups or stews.

I was looking for an easy, foolproof bread recipe, as I had never baked bread before.  After trying a few different recipes I found this one and it changed my life! :D   This recipe makes 3 loafs.  I bake my 3 loafs every weekend and freeze 2 of them to use when needed.  My son loves his school lunch sandwiches on this bread - all all his friends come over and ask for some fresh bread - so sad its such a novelty!!  Thanks so  much for sharing this recipe Nita!!   (this also makes wonderful cinnamon/raisin bread...)

Great recipe.  I used all King Arthur's Whole Wheat Flour, no white flour, also used Agave rather than honey, cut to 1/4 cup.  I did add 1/2 cup roasted pecans, very good. I think next time I will add 3/4 cups roasted pecans. I also made 2 loaves plus 12 buns.

Delicious, perfect whole wheat bread. I used 7 cups of whole wheat pastry flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour and replaced the butter with a canola/olive oil blend. I  used a method I am more used to for making the dough: combine water, honey, and yeast and let sit until bubbly (about 10 minutes), add oil (or butter), kneed in all of the flour, let rise until doubled (about an hour), punch down, put in loaf pans (mine yielded TWO loaves, not three), and let rise until just above the rim. It turned out great!

A totally awesome recipe! Since I'm the only one in the house, I cut the ingredients in half and used a large glass loaf pan to make a HUGE single loaf of bread. I also added 4 tablespoons of wheat gluten to the recipe after reading another person's review. My loaf came out pretty close to one of the fancy loaves  like you'd buy at the bakery or grocery store. I'll be making another loaf tomorrow for the coming week. 

Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

This was my second time making bread from scratch and it worked perfectly!  I've just started grinding my own grains to make healthy bread & decided to try this recipe.  I was a little worried because I wasn't sure what "bread flour" is considered.  I ground 2 cups of hard red, 2 cups of hard white and a little more than 1 cup of Ezekiel blend for a total of 8 cups of flour.  I have a large package of yeast so used 1 round T.  Then I mixed it in my Kitchenaid mixer and when it was time to knead, I used my dough hook vs doing it by hand.  I also added some flax seeds during kneading.  Each rise was around 30 min.  It came out in perfect loaves & holds together beautifully, will make a great sandwich bread.

Probably one of the best wheat breads I've ever baked.  I cut down on the honey, a fair bit - used just over 1/3 cup total and brushed the crust with a bit of thinned honey just before it was done baking.  

Dough holds up well to freezing.

I didn't even follow this recipe all that well and it still came out good.  I had to use all purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour.  I did have to let it rise for quite a few hours.

I'm not a fan of wheat bread because they're always to dense (I'm a new bread maker, so it might be my fault), but since this wasn't a "full" wheat bread I decided to try it. It came out so good! Sorry to change the recipe on my first try, but I halved the recipe and didn't want to deal with sticky honey, so only added 4tbsp of sugar and made two small loaves. It didn't rise like I expected, but it's still fluffy and very un-dense. I love it! Thanks!

I can't even make bread and I made this.  So there you go.  I did halve the recipe and put it in one 9x5 pan after reading reviews, and it made a nice sized loaf.  I will add extra gluten next time, as some others suggested, to make it more chewy, like you'd get in the store.  I also used ALL whole-wheat, no white flour.  This made the everything take longer to rise, but I was going for healthy, not convenient.  Overall, this recipe is as perfect as I've found - simple, tasty, easily modified for a change of flavor, and pretty much fool-proof.

Something happened with the honey and yeast that made the bread taste like a bitter beer. I feel bad for rating this so low because I’m the one that probably did something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly.

Fantastic bread every time! I make it into two fairly large loaves instead of three small ones. I've experimented with adding more whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. It's never turned out that badly but in my opinion it's always better when I make it as written. Thanks so much Nita!

Was really excited after reading all the reviews, not so much after baking.  I usually make a basic white bread but we are switching to healthier whole grains. The dough came together perfect, the first rising was beautiful and then it all went south.  I punched the dough down, shaped and placed in loaf pans, allowed it to rise for an hour but after the first 20 minutes it didn't rise anymore.  I baked it, but unfortunately I have two bricks of bread.

As far as bread recipes go, easy and delicious.  You can taste the honey in the bread.  Makes great rolls too.  Recipe halves well.  I made this again recently and used equal amounts of bread flour and WW flour and it was great.   Thanks, Nita!

I like to try new recipes , so I tried this one for the first time. I have been baking bread for my family for about twenty years. I have have used many a recipe, but this by far is the best. Usually I follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, but this one I decided to tweak it alittle after reading the reviews. I used 3 cups of unbleached organic flour, and the rest was organic whole wheat that I grind. . My family continued slicing and eating. I would like to make this all whole wheat, eventually I will.

I make 2 loaves with same recipe and I changed the recipe a little to add items that we like in our bread. I used 4 cups flour, 1 cup oats, 3-4 cups whole wheat flour or whatever to get to correct consistency and 1/2 cup ground flax seed. This bread is absolutely marvelous. I have made alot of bread over the years yet this recipe is the best ever. Moist, slightly sweet and tender. I am now making this regularly to replace store bought.

An excellent whole wheat bread recipe.  I used 60% ww flour for all the flour (with gluten added - 5T for a the whole batch).  I made 4 smaller loaves - and par baked 2 to finish another day.

DELICIOUS bread!!  Me and my husband love it.  It's so good with the sweet honey flavour that it's great just plain with butter.  The only thing I change is, instead of 5 cups white flour, I use only 2 and the rest whole wheat.  This is the only recipe I use now for bread.

Great bread.  I changed the portion size to only make one loaf, but next time I will make the whole recipe as it was a huge hit with my room mates and the loaf was gone in less than a day.    I used only whole wheat flower and substituted the honey for raw sugar (as I did not have any).  I also used olive oil instead of butter and the bread still turned out great.

Ends my quest for homemade bread!  I change it to 24 servings to make 2 loaves and use my bread machine to mix it up and knead it.  I use only freshly ground whole wheat flour (a total of 3.5 cups hard white berries and 1 cup soft white wheat berries.)  I reduced the honey by just a bit and added a tablespoon of milk to the water in the first step.  Also makes the BEST homemade whole wheat burger buns!

Awesome bread recipe! Makes great French Toast and I used it to make Rhubarb Bread Pudding from this site and it was great in that too. My only word of caution comes from experience.  I tried to mix the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer and, well, it was a bit too much and I had flour everywhere (which I saw coming but tempted fate anyway) You can start it in your mixer, but you will have to knead a good portion of the flour into your dough by hand unless you have a super mixer which I unfortunately do not.

Wow...This is easily the best whole wheat bread I've ever made.  Usually, when I attempt a whole wheat recipe, the bread inevitably comes out really dense, and well, not good.  This bread, however, is really light and soft with a slightly crispy crust.  The flavor is a bit sweet, though, a lot like Roman Meal brand, but that can be adjusted.

This recipe was really easy.  I hope to make this a lot more in the future.  The reason I gave it four stars was because of the butter/margarine on top of the bread after baking.  Our family likes a crunchy top, and this step detracted from the bread for us.       I did change three things. 1) I used the rapid rise yeast.  This eliminates the first rise.  2)I used 1/3 c. sugar for the second part of the recipe.  As one reviewer noted, it's a little cheaper.  3) I used canola oil instead of melted butter.  We try to keep all our bread non-dairy, and I don't like margarine.

i started making bread about a year ago  and this is by far the best , i mean best best ever recipe.  i add olive oil instead of butter though and sometimes just add sugar instead the extra 1/3 cup honey because honey gets expensive.   i use my Kitchen Aid for all the kneading -  wouldn't be making it if not for that piece of wonderful equipment.  my family loves loves this and my sister and all of her family, i just cantt seem to make enough for everybody

This bread came out perfectly! I used my kitchen aid mixer to stir the ingredients and kneaded the dough for 10 minutes. This was my first time baking homemade wheat bread and I am super proud. Thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting bread. I use white whole wheat flour to fool my family. I also mix it all in the bread maker, but bake it in the oven. (It comes out too dry if I bake it in the bread maker. Plus I hate the paddle hole in the bottom.)

Perfect! This was my first attempt at bread making with my new KA mixer. It was a little dense, so next time I will either use a little less flour, or let it rise longer, but the taste was wonderful. I will be making this again and again, and quite possible never buy wheat bread from the store again!

Wow!  I have been baking all of my family's bread for about a year now, and I have tried several recipes.  When I made this bread today, my husband said, "That's the one!"  That's all the review I need!  This one is a keeper!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe, Nita!

I do not like whole wheat bread and have been baking white - however my husband does prefer whole wheat bread so I tried this recipe.  I cannot believe that I prefer this to the white I have been making.  My son-in-law and grandkids were here last night and they also enjoyed it!  BTW - I did not have bread flour and used all purpose and it still turned out great.  I also divided into three and the one loaf I made was neither small or dense  (cooked on a pizza stone not in a bread pan)  I have the rest of the dough in my fridge but I'm sure it won't last long.  Followed recipe exactly except I always give my bread a second rise before shaping for final rise.

This recipe is delicious and is easily adapted to 100% whole wheat.  I use fresh-ground white whole wheat and add a T of gluten.  I can put everything into my mixer bowl at the same time without proofing the yeast.

If you are looking for a light whole wheat bread, this is very nice.  I have made it for my neighbor, a diabetic, replacing half the honey with agave nectar and using whole wheat flour.  She likes it like that.  Today I made an extra loaf for myself, and I used bread flour for a third of the flour.  It was not my favorite because I like a heartier, denser loaf.  But it would make nice dinner rolls.

I have made this recipe a dozen times now and its fabulous! I have made it with all whole wheat flour, however the bread becomes very dense, so I used 5 cups of unbleached white flour (as bread flour is simply white flour with baking soda in it) and 2-3 cups of whole wheat flour. I have also added flaxmeal for more nutrition as well. I also allowed the dough to sit longer during the rise times due to not using bread flour (I'm assuming). This bread is great to slice after it has cooled and put into the freezer. Very yummy as toast, sandwiches or warm with butter! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy to make and turned out great. I threw in 1/2 cup wheat bran and reduced the flour by about 1/4 cup to add more fibre. I will be making my own bread from now on thanks to this recipe!

Great recipe works every time. I use white whole wheat flour and canola oil instead of butter. I have used honey or sugar and it works equally well, sugar I reduced to 1/4 cup, still absolutely fabulous.

This recipe was okay.  It was very, very light on the wheat flour and also I didn't like how you had to knead with the wheat flour (which is so rough on the hands!).  I ended up adding wheat flour and using it first because I really wanted more of the whole wheat and I did not want to knead with whole wheat.  I bake bread weekly but forgot my regular recipe book so looked this one up.  The bread rose but not as much as usual, although the flour-sugar-yeast proportions were comparable to my usual recipe, so I don't know why.  It is also a very sweet bread and therefore, less versatile.  But I would like to say that the advice on kneading until it's still a bit sticky but almost not, is spot-on and that is really good for first-time bread bakers.  That is really how to avoid over-flouring the bread.

I make this bread at least once a month and we love it!!!  Sometimes I substitute molasses for half of the honey, and I like it that way the best.  I also like to sub some of the flour for ground oats, and wheat germ for more of a multi-grain type bread.

I love this bread! Healthy, no GMO's, MSG or preservatives and my kids love it. I tweaked it a little. I made this with a Kitchenaid mixer. I let the yeast, water and honey proof for 10 minutes before adding 4 cups of white flour then let it sit 30 minutes.   I then added the butter, salt and honey as directed.   I then added in 1/2 cup King Arthur RED whole wheat flour, 1 cup King Arthur WHITE whole wheat flour and 2 more cups of white flour. I let it rise about an hour in an oiled bowl.   I puched it down and then let it rise again in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 hours (until doubled). At this point I put it into oiled loaf pans to rise one more time or shape it into loafs for the freezer.

It truly is the best but, once, I put the yeast into water that was too hot and ended up with bricks instead of bread. Every other time, the bread came out perfect, raised nice and scented my home beautifully! It even sliced nice - thick or thin slices were perfect and I couldn't ask for better texture.

This is such an easy and great tasting recipe.  Everyone who has had this bread raves about how great it was.  The great thing about it is that even for a novice bread maker like myself, you would have to work pretty hard to screw it up!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good! The only changes I made were that I halved it and only made one loaf, and I used a little less honey. A very good bread, I'll probably use this recipe from now on for my wheat bread!

I LOVE this recipe and have been making it regularly for over a year.  I use all whole wheat flour that I grind myself and when I use a white winter wheat, it is still very light and moist.  I often cut the honey in half for a less sweet bread.  I have also used oil instead of  butter but do prefer the taste of the butter and rationalize that it isn't much saturated fat per serving.

This recipe is so great! I did scale it down to make 1 loaf cause I wasn't sure if I would like it or not because I am not a fan of wheat bread. But now I wish I would've made all 3 loaves, it is so delicious!!! The loaf I made is almost gone already! I will definately make this again! Thanks for the wonderful recipe and to wifey for suggesting it!

So good! This bread is tasty, sweet and beautiful!  Thank you for posting a recipe that doesn't use a bread maker and has a good yield!  I used buckwheat honey instead of regular honey and that adds another bit of flavour to the bread.  Oh, and my 2 year old son loves this bread!

We have finally found our "every day" bread!! I have been baking our families bread for about 6 months now, I tried this recipe yesterday morning and were on loaf #3!! Every time I have halved the recipe and I let my bread machine do the kneading, then I take it out and put it in a loaf pan, let it rise, and cook for exactly 25 minutes and its perfect! One of the loaves was divided into onion sandwich rolls for BBQ beef. All I did was add 1/3 cup dry onion flakes during the kneeding process. Anyway, this recipe is great! Very moist, but "sturdy" enough to make sandwiches, it doesnt fall apart like other recipes have.

time consuming, but SO worth it! substituted applesauce at the beginning for butter and added 1 cup oats. lasted in a ziploc bag on the counter for over a week and makes delicious pb and honey/jam sandwiches, french toast, or just plain  toast.

This has been my staple bread recipe for the last year.  Love it, Love it!  Good trust worthy bread recipe.  I love that it uses honey instead of regular sugar..even more healthy.  I also used Whole Wheat White Flour for the Whole Wheat and it came out perfect!

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe I've found! Even my picky husband and three-year-old love it. It's fantastic sandwich bread. And it freezes well, so if you can't use it up quickly, just pop the extra loaves in the freezer until ready. It thaws within a day. WONDERFUL!!!

I'm new to bread making and I threw away 7 loaves from 7 different recipes before I found this one. It comes out great every time! The only change I have ever made was to use a little less salt. I sometimes will use more white flour and less wheat flour and then add wheat germ, or flax, or rolled oats, but most of the time I follow the recipe right down to the letter. Thank you for giving me confidence in my bread making ability!

My bread is still rising, the rolls are about to go in the oven, and I just finished 4 slices of pizza made with this recipe. Amazingly easy to put together. It takes a lot of time, but it is soo worth it. Thank you so much. I also used only 1/3 cup of honey total, I don't like my bread too sweet. Thanks.

Finally, I made a yeast bread that turned out well.  I took earlier suggestions and put a pan of water in the oven while cooking but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I was determined to get a decent loaf.  I somehow only ended up with two loaves but that was fine with me.  I wanted something large enough for sandwiches.  I prefer a more "wheaty" taste to my bread so I will probably adjust the ratio of wheat to bread flour next time.  As I can attest, a great loaf for beginners.

I taught myself to make bread with this recipe. It's very easy to follow and yields great results every single time. I've made it dozens of times now. Sometimes I embellish it with sunflower seeds, dried herbs, cinnamon and raisins, etc, but it's really quite wonderful just as is. Lately I've been spraying the tops of the loaves with some "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead of real melted butter, and that works well too.

I am still new to yeast bread...but when I saw that this was easy...I had to give it a try.  So glad I did.  This is a wonderful WW bread.  I think so much better than store bought.  Next time (and there will be one) I am going to take some suggestions and add some flax seeds to this.  Thanks Nita!

I have published 2 cookbooks and write a weekly cooking column for the local newspaper. All this is to say that I try and review tons of recipes. Simple Whole Wheat Bread is fantastic and will be one of my favorites for years to come.

I LOVE this receipe! I tried a different but just didn't turn out quite like this one. I use the bread for pizza dough and my family just loves it. When I make the bread it is moist and has a good flavor to it. It doesn't crumble like other breads that I have made. This is a god bread for slicing. I also made cinnamon bread from it by putting a mixture of butter cinnamon and sugar and rolling it and placing it in the bread pan. With a powered sugar icing it was very good. Thanks for the receipe.

I have made this recipe several times and really like it.  I have more success when I cut the recipe in half.  I knead it on speed "2" on my KitchenAid mixer as others have suggested.  The mixer seems to "struggle" if I make the whole recipe.  Delicious!!!  I have experimented using more whole wheat flour and less bread flour with no problems.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Easy to make but way too sweet. If I try it again I'll leave out the second dose of honey.

I made this Friday night when I was in a bit of a baking frenzy. I haven't made bread in 20 years and I must say that this was a wonderful recipe to start out with.
Instead of using some white flour and whole wheat flour, I only used whole wheat flour. I didn't miss the white flour at all. I didn't know what "Bread" flour was, when I went to the store, no flour specified bread flour so I bought All-Purpose. I have a feeling that using All-Purpose made my bread a bit densor than it should have been but it was still yummy. Next time, I'll brush up on my baking verbage so I do it right. Thank you BIZZYBRANDI for the "New Breadmakers" instructions. That really helped! This is definitely a repeat recipe!! ADDENDUM: I just found out why I needed to use both white flour and whole wheat flour! I found this on another Web site: "Within categories of flour, there's also a range in amount of protein between different brands. It's also important to know that, despite its high protein content, whole-wheat flour has to be mixed with all-purpose flour to form a light loaf (the bran in whole-wheat flour tends to cut gluten strands, reducing elasticity)." Learn something new every day!!

This was very good! I mixed canned milk and hot water to make 3cups of liquid. And i use 5cups of wheat flour and 3cups white flour. Butter the tops of the dough before 2nd rise.It's very tasty and very soft. My kid's loved it!!

This recipe was WONDERFUL! I mill my own hard white wheat berries into flour & have been looking for a recipe. It was moist & did not crumble when cut!!! I modified the recipe by using only my milled flour, 1/4 c honey, 1Tbsp dough enhancer. I didn't need as much flour as it called for. I used 1c less. This made a perfect 3 loaves!! YUM YUM! It did not last long & so I am making it again today! THANKS SO MUCH for this simple recipe!

I loved this recipe! I'm the only one in my family who enjoys cooking, but honestly, I'm terrible at it! I tried this recipe and it came out perfectly! The bread was full of flavor and the texture was amazing, by far the best thing I have ever cooked! The only thing I changed was that I used no white flour for this recipe, only whole wheat. Thank you so much for this recipe, I'm sure I'll use it again!

This was so easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I made it into dinner rolls by scaling the recipe down to 2/3 and breaking the dough into 20 balls, distributed between 2 round cake pans.  I brushed the tops with an egg wash before baking, and out of the oven came delicious, fluffy whole wheat rolls.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have been trying several different whole wheat bread recipes and this is by far the best.  It isn't too dense or dry, it has a great elasticity to it, and the flavor is great!  I really like that the recipe uses butter (instead of lard, yuck) and honey, two of my favorite ingredients.  I replaced 2 cups of the white bread flour with whole wheat flour and it turned out perfect. This recipe is also a lot easier then most bread recipes.  I will be making this again!

This bread was "ok" I guess.  I made it exactly according to instructions.  I don't like bread machines so made it by hand.  I have had better...

This recipe was fabulous! I used whole wheat flour only and it tasted great! So healthy too! I thought this recipe was pretty simple for a new bread maker. I was't real sure about just how sticky it should be and how long I should knead it, but I've made this several times and I can't seem to mess it up! It's good every time! Does any one have suggestions on how to freeze, thaw and cook after freezing???

This is a wonderful moist bread! It is so easy to prepare. I made it for a bake sale and all the loaves sold quickly. I made 4 loaves of bread (instead of 3 larger loaves) in pans slightly smaller than the 9 x 5 suggested in the recipe. I baked the loaves for 30 minutes. This recipe is a keeper! YUMMY!!!!

Fantastic!  We originally froze one loaf & gave the 3rd away thinking we'd never go through 3 loaves in time -- big mistake!  After using the frozen load (it freezes great BTW), I had to make a 2nd batch within a week!  My husband loves it, and he's usually a strict white bread eater.

This is an awesome recipe. I have never cooked anything before in my life, yet I was able to make this bread and it was absolutely fabulous. I took it to school and my friends keep begging me to make more! It is also great after being frozen. Not as moist, but still has a good taste.

This is a great recipe.  It is nice light, and that's even when I use a higher percentage of whole wheat flour than what is suggested in the recipe.  Super yummy!

This is, in my estimation, the BEST bread I've ever tasted, let alone made!  It tastes like Arnold's original - moist, chewy, tasty, and is a perfect bread with a meal, for sandwiches, toast, french toast...the BEST!!!  Thanks a million for sharing!

I did one tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil (instead of 3 tablespoons of butter.)  I also added a tablespoon each to the dough, chia seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.  I brushed the top of the loaves with olive oil and sprinkled with oats before baking.

This is my first bread. I made this last night and didn't follow directions. it was a fail.  I just made it again and followed directions exactly and this bread is amazingly perfect. I'm pretty proud of myself and this recipe is pretty awesome for ham sandwiches.

This is a great recipe. I only use 2 cups white flour and the rest whole wheat. my kids love it. I also use it as a base for cinnamon/raisin bread. To do that I add 1 cup of raisins to the water yeast mixture and follow directions until you kneed it after rising in the greased bowl. Then roll it out very thin just before putting it into the bread pans to rise, rub milk over the surface and spread 1 cup of sugar mixed with 3 tablespoons of cinnamon over the surface and then roll it up and cut into 3 loaves, tuck ends under and put into pans to cook. Very Yummy.

FANTASTIC. I enjoy cooking but am not much of a baker. This bread made me look like a pro! My husband even admired the loaf before it was baked--it looked that appetizing. Rose and baked beautifully and he said it was delicious. I've baked bread before but it's never turned out this well--the sponge step makes ALL the difference. If you like me have been meh about baking bread, try this excellent recipe and get ready for the admiration! Thank you, Ms. Crabb, for this wonderful recipe! ETA: Came back to add that yesterday a 5-lb. bottle of Costco honey appeared on my kitchen counter! Hmmmm..........I think it's a hit with the husband! :D

I loved it, and hey! I know what I'm talking about. I already tried out lots of recipes,  but this became a family
Favorite! Thanks to Nita crabb, we have this recipe!
I loved the taste, crunchyness, and texture!
The one, and only problem is that, this makes 3 small breads, not big. (You can double it up, then it makes 5 normal sized)
I just change  a few things, I add some seeds, depending on what I have in storage.
So I cut the  2 to 4 cups to simply 2, and all the seeds.
Sometimes a bit more but that's it. 

Also, I just loooooooooveee how everyone likes it!

Thanks Nita!

I made a vegan version based on this recipe, substituting the butter with coconut oil, using spelt flour instead of whole wheat, and exchanging the sugar with the same amount of equal-parts light agave nectar and grade A maple syrup. It turned out very delicious! Best bread I've ever made.

This is good, and the whole and white flour combo gives it a great texture and flufiness. If yours didn't come out right, there's a reason for every scenario. No bread is "fool proof." Even if you're new to bread baking, there are helpful sites where you can troubleshoot your bread issues, such as baking a "brick." Did you do the window pane test? Did you over mix the dough? That's why home baking is so awesome: it's not the exact same thing each time. It's not cheaper to bake at home. We do it to ensure that we are eating wholesome ingredients and, simply for the fun of it. Good luck :)

I am new to making bread. I have made rolls before but not bread. I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfect. I made 2 regular bread and one cinnamon raisin bread. The recipe is very easy to follow and easy to make. Mixing it with a mixer helps make it easier. This is the recipe to keep.

it turned out okay considering I've never made bread before. I did not have honey, but used Karo syrup. I think I did not knead the bread correctly so I will try again.

I joined allrecipes just to review this recipe! I've been baking bread for over 40 years, and this is hands-down the best recipe I've found. I followed the recipe exactly other than substituting whole spelt flour for the whole wheat (it's what I had). It tastes incredibly good, the texture is perfect, and it makes wonderful sandwiches and toast. It's especially good with added dried cranberries, chopped almonds and cashews. I mixed and kneaded it with my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook then covered it with a damp cloth and put it in the oven (slightly warmed and turned off) to rise. The recipe made four mini loaves and two standard loaves. From now on, this is the only bread recipe I'll use!

This was my first time making bread and it came out great! I used 3 cups of regular white flour (not bread flour) and substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of white flour to first step. I also did not need to add so much flour while kneading (I used less than a cup of flour that I poured on the counter while kneading until I got the desired texture).

I usually do not like wheat bread but mu hubby bought wheat flour on accident so I thought I would try this out. It turned out fantastic! I cut the recipe by a third so that I would end up with two loaves as I didn't think my KA could handle the whole recipe. And I was right, it would not have been able to. I followed the recipe as written however, I forgot to add the second amount of honey. It didn't matter. It turned out wonderful. We (the kids and I) ate a full loaf right out of the oven with butter and jam. We ended up eating it all night and didn't even make dinner. haha. Very good! a keeper for sure! Just follow the recipe and it'll turn out perfect!

This recipe is AMAZING! I will never have to buy bread again!

A few tricks to help your bread turn out the best:

1. Mix warm water, honey, and yeast together. Let stand about 10 min (or until a film forms on top) then mix in with bread flour and follow recipe directions.

2. Make sure your mixing bowl is not cold or it will cause yeast not to rise correctly. 

3. I used half again as much honey because I wanted it a little sweeter.

4. Have a warm place for the dough to rise.

I'm so glad I read the reviews for this bread. As written it is amazing but I love that it's so versatile! Took a suggestion of adding sugar, cinnamon, and raisins and it was a hit! Great AND easy bread recipes are hard to come by this is my go to bread recipe from now on.

This is my new go-to recipe for homemade bread! It turned out absolutely perfectly. Not too sweet, not too "whole wheaty" and the texture is dense yet fluffy. It did take longer for it to rise for me, probably because our house was cold. We all love this recipe, thank you for sharing!

This is hands down the BEST one I've tried. 

I've been making this recipe twice a month for 4 months. I slice it up once it has cooled off and wrap the loaf multiple times in plastic wrap. I then throw it in the freezer so that it will last longer. Whenever I want a slice or two I'm able to just grab it out of the freezer and put the rest back in. 

I'm addicted to this recipe.

Best sandwich bread EVER! This one is a keeper. Followed recipe exactly. What I like most is that this looks like traditional sandwich bread. Nice and fairly square which makes it perfect for school lunches. And the taste is heavenly.

This was a GREAT recipe! I used all white whole wheat flour. Mine didn't rise quite as much as in the pictures but I may not have been patient enough. Tastes great and isn't as dense as some whole wheat breads.

I made this bread a few time and could never get the dough to rise above the pan and it looked kind of like melba toast.  This is what I did to make one loaf. I adjusted the serving size to 18, like a loaf and a half. I used three teaspoons of yeast and substituted the honey with sugar, but just for the first rise. For the mix, I added the honey and other ingredients accordingly. Since the NEW serving size was a loaf and a half, I lowered the oven temp to 340 degrees and baked the loaf for an additional 6 to 8 minutes.

I am very satisfied with the outcome. I use the sandwich option on my bread maker and it turns out fantastic. Brushing butter on top does keep the crust soft.  However I change the servings from 3 loaves (36) to (16).

Very good recipe. I made this while preparing some other dishes for dinner and it came out perfectly. I cut the recipe in half and it made one large loaf. The recipe requires very little work for an excellent loaf (or loaves) of bread.

Just tried this recipe. I have never made bread before and this was wonderfully easy. My kids and husband love it so much I think I am going to be making homemade bread from now on. This time I am going to try a little bit of ground flax seed and see how much it changes the texture and taste. Also thinking about giving some of it away for Christmas presents.

Awesome. Exactly what I'd expect from a whole wheat bread. Make sure to cool on a cooling rack and not in the pan. The only change I used was using vegetable oil instead of butter (I was too impatient to melt butter, and didn't see the point as it's more expensive). Next time, for a healthier version I will use melted coconut oil. I love replacing it for most oils in my baking and sometimes cooking. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was so incredibly easy, that even I could make it! I couldn't believe how good it tasted. I would say that I used 2 parts lecithin oil and 1 part vegetable oil in a mixture to coat my bowl and bread pans with.
Thank you, Nita!! I'm loving this, and so is my family!
BTW: I made two large loaves instead of three.

I googled best honey wheat bread recipes and this recipe and Honey Wheat Bread I came up in the top. This recipe got a ton more reviews, but the other won a country fair blue ribbon and also received 5 stars from allrecipes. I've made both in case anyone, like me, was wondering which was better. Hands down Honey Wheat Bread I. I think it's the addition of milk and I substituted the melted shortening for butter. Hope this helps someone!

I have been making this recipe for a while now, and it is perfect every time! I have subsituted sugar for the honey when I had none in the cupboard. I've also added a much higher amount of whole wheat to the a/p flour ratio with GREAT success. 
The dough is soft and elastic and is also great for buns. 
I love this recipe for everydays bread use; toast, sandwichs and my favourite is grilled cheese! It browns so nicely on the outside and has a wonderful nutty flavour from the whole wheat. 
Might be more time consuming, but totally worth it!!

The best bread I have ever made!  I hate rating recipes when I alter them...but I subbed one cup of oatmeal for one of the cups of white flour and added flax and sunflower seeds.  Flavor and texture was out of this world.

This is an AWSOME recipe! It works every time for me. Just follow the instructions and you got it! I put the dough to rise in a cold oven with the light on. I let it rise higher than this video because I like my bread light and airy. You gotta try this one!

LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!!!
I was very hesitant to try the recipe but, I am glad I did. I did not have bread flour. I used all purpose flour and white whole wheat flour! The results were amazing! The bread was very soft and it did not fall apart when the loaf was getting cut. I made two loaves of bread and six sandwich rolls.

I have used this recipe for a few years now and it is amazing!  I add 4-6 tbsp of vital wheat gluten, and use all whole wheat flour.  I usually grind my own flour from hard white wheat berries that I have on hand.  It works great as sandwich bread and is a delicious treat with homemade jam!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The first time I made it, the bread itself was absolutely delicious. However, either my yeast was too old or my water wasn't hot enough so it didnt rise the same as it did this time. This time, after only 1/2 hour the dough had more than doubled in size, and after another 30 minutes it was over the top of the pan. It is baking now & my mouth is already salivating. I did freeze one loaf the last time, but did not like the texture after thawed. I will try freezing the dough the next time.

We made this recipe twice in the same day and it was a bomb. We followed directions to a tee yet both times the dough did not rise as expected. ( Note: we went back to the store and got different yeast to use in the second batch) In both cases we put the dough in the oven at the right time hoping it would bake. The end result looked like large bullets for a tank. Even though 3rd times a charm I don't think we will try making this again.

I scaled this recipe to 12 servings/1 loaf to make in my bread machine. I used 1 cup warm milk, 2 1/4 tsp yeast, 4 tbsps honey, 2 tbsps butter melted, 1 tsp salt, 1 c all purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup Robin Hood Omega 3 plus flax whole wheat blend and 1 tbsp vital gluten. Used 3 lb, light crust and whole wheat settings. Enjoyed this bread will definitely make again.

I just finished this bread, and it turned out pretty well. I cut the recipe in half and made a single loaf in a silicone bread pan. There were no issues with rising, and I followed the directions. However, I used 1tbl of yeast, 1.5c water, 2.5c bread flour, 1tbl honey, 2c whole wheat flour, 2tbl margarine, 1/6c granulated sugar. On the second rise, it took 45-50min (and was lightly coated in olive oil for the rise), and then another 35min in the pan (brushed with honey and sprinkled with slivered, chopped almonds) and baked for 30min. It is a very moist bread but next time I make it, I will add an egg. We'll see how it turns out when I slice it for sandwiches as I made it specifically for ham sandwiches this week.

This is a very good recipe.  Very light and fluffy.  Lots of honey and plenty of hydration.  The flour amounts might be confusing for beginner.  It looks like you add the white flour first, then add 2 cups wheat, and up to an additional 2-4 cups wheat.  What it means is you add 2 cups of wheat flour but, might have to add up to an addition 2 cups (4 cups total). Although the 3 and 1/2 cups listed in the recipe will do for most climates.  I made 2/3 of a recipe and made one smaller loaf in an 8.5 x 4.5 pan and one large round freeform loaf ball.  Both came out great in 30 minutes.
I had a few tablespoons of unused wheat flour when I made it.  I used a standing mixer with a dough hook and the dough eventually pulled away from the bowl after 6-8 minutes of kneading on medium.  It was still quite sticky when transferring it to the bowl for rising.  But after an hour of rising (in an oven heated to 175 F and then turned off)  it was easy to pick up and divide.  I let it rise about 45 minutes at room temperature after punching it down and shaping it.
I don't know why most recipes say to bake wheat bread at 375 instead of 350.  375 works great for dense crispy-crusted whole grain bread.  But 350 for 30 minutes was great for a nice decadent fluffy load.
This certainly isn't the healthiest wheat bread out there, but it is so tasty.
If this didn't work for someone, either they misread the recipe and added 2 or more cups too much flour or had bad yeast, or water that was too hot, etc.

All I have to say is WOW. This was my first time ever making bread and it turned out perfect. I had absolutely no knowledge about bread making and this recipe made it easy. I did read a lot of the reviews to get a few pointers and I think that also helped.

Absolutely AMAZING!!! It was my first time making home made bread. I ruined the first batch because the water I used was too hot and I think it killed the yeast because the dough didn't rise. My second attempt was a COMPLETE success. Followed the recipe exactly (just made a 1/2 batch). I used my Kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook on #2 speed. I DID NOT have to add any extra whole wheat flour during the mixing process. I used a mini loaf pan that had 8 rectangular cavities to put dough and got 8 mini loaves exactly from a 1/2 batch. This recipe is an absolute MUST TRY! Once you do you will be hooked. I am sooo happy I picked this recipe to try. My kids (6yrs & 7 yrs) LOVE this bread SO much!!! Oh, I didn't put the butter on the top of the loaves at the end. It was fine without it. It doesn't have a very hard crust. Grease your pan liberally so it doesn't stick to the pan.

Best whole wheat bread I've ever made and I've been baking bread for almost 40 years. No, it's not 100% ww flour for you purists. But it does have a high content of ww flour, and the recipe lends itself to whole grain additions (flax, wheat berries, etc.). I used my Kitchenaid to knead the dough and was just amazed at how this dough rose considering the large amount of ww flour. I may add gluten next time, as some suggest, but I wonder if that's even necessary. The resulting loaf, recipe as written, is light, moist, slightly chewy, with just the right density, and not bitter. I hate to admit to a slight recipe change, but the fact is, I've made hundreds of loaves of bread, so I know that no plain eating bread requires 2/3 c of honey or other sweetener, so I used 1/3 cup, and it was plenty. I let the first rising go an hour while I took a walk. Came back to a mountain of dough overflowing the large bowl in my proofing oven. Second rising took just 30 minutes, and it was huge too. I made two loaves because I like big ones. I will absolutely keep this recipe and make it over and over again. Just fantastic. Thank you to the contributor for sharing this unbelievable recipe.

I've made this bread many times and it turns out phenomenal every time!  I take the advice and only make two loaves instead of three and I knead it by hand because my KA mixer is one of the smaller models and doesn't handle all the dough very well.  Thanks for a winning recipe!  LOVE IT!

Amazing!!!!  This was my first attempt at making whole wheat bread and it came our amazing.  My only complaint is not being able to keep my husband out of the kitchen when the bread came out.  He devoured 1/2 loaf to himself lol.

Just baked this bread for the first time and it turned out terrific! I really loved how it turned out. The only thing I would change is to not add so much honey next time, because my husband thought the bread was too sweet for his liking. I'll definitely bake this wheat bread again! Also, I used my Aunt Rita's advice (she's made homemade bread for about 40 years!) before I put the dough into the baking pans, I flattened it out gently with a rolling pin & then rolled it up "jelly roll" style & then the dough fit perfectly into the bread pan & it prevents any air pockets. Then when I took the baked bread out of the oven, she suggested I put each pan on its side for a few minutes to cool, exposing the bottom of the pan to more cool air before turning them out onto my cooking racks. Worked great! Thanks very much to BIZZYBRANDI for her very helpful tips geared to new breadmakers in her review. :-)

This is my first experience making bread from scratch, so I learned a few things, but all in all, this recipe turned out some tasty loaves! Mine are slightly chewy, and denser than I imagine they should be (probably because I added too much wheat flour and kneaded too much,) but they're worth another try! I figure 1,500 people can't be wrong...

Brilliant!  This is an easy recipe (I don't even use my standing mixer--just my hands)  and produces scrumptious bread. It also freezes very well!  (ie it's great heated up out of the freezer).  I now make a batch each Sunday for the week.  Yum!

This recipe is very nice. I did not make according to directions, however. I have a 2.5-pound capacity bread machine so I halved the recipe exactly and made it in there. The ratios are perfect. I used warm water when adding to the machine and the 'rapid bake' setting under 'whole wheat', which took about 3 hours. It was delicious and rose perfectly well. I've never had to add gluten to any of my breads but I am at sea level so that probably makes a difference. Lastly, I have made this substituting sugar for the honey but it does not come out as sweet or flavorful (still nice, just not AS nice).

This is a really tasty bread.  It's heavy, but not dense like a bread that didn't rise well.  I wanted hearty loaves big enough for sandwhiches, so I baked into 2 loaves instead of three.  I baked them for the same amount of time though and they turned out perfect.  I also didn't have enough honey, so just made up the difference with sugar and that didn't seem to hurt anything.  Will definitely make again.

A marvelous recipe.  I made it exactly.  I only baked for 25 minutes and it was all I needed.  The second batch I kneaded in raisins and cinnamon.  By the way, the entire house smells like a bakery!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! It was my first time making a loaf of wheat bread and was so simple and easy to follow. Honestly, I don't know why I didn't do this sooner. It has wonderful taste, great density, and didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would to make a homemade loaf of bread. It took just over a week for my husband and I to eat it, and it stayed fresh and moist and delicious the whole time. I won't be buying bread at the store anymore! Try this, you won't regret it!

This is delicious! I only gave it four stars because splitting the recipe into three loaves did not make large enough loaves to make sandwiches from the bread, which is what I was looking for. I'll be making just 2 loaves with it next time!

Easy, yummy bread recipe! I added ground flax seed and freshly toasted sunflower seeds.  I used 1/3 cup of sugar with the yeast (instead of honey), and skipped the second 1/3 cup of sweetener. I also subbed EVOO for the butter. This recipe makes two large (9 X 5 bread pans) loaves of bread. I lightly brush tops of the baked bread with butter, but not 2 tablespoons.

Pretty excellent recipe, very easy for even a novice bread baker. Added flaxseed, sliced almonds, and allspice, then divided into two decent-sized loaves. Great texture and taste!

I've never made bread before and can hardly believe how easy it was and the bread was absolutely delicious! The other reviews with helpful tips were just that: extremely helpful. Thanks to everyone for your ideas and suggestions!

Not bad tasting bread.  But no eggs = no crust and crumbly bread.  It is an interesting take on bread-machine bread.  Easy to make and not bad. Result is ok for crumbling into soup but not edible alone.

AMAZING! This was my first time making bread and I will never use another recipe for whole wheat bread! I also won’t buy bred from the store ever again :) After a few tries I got it right and here is how (long but hopefully helpful):

First time I tried to cut the recipe down to 1 loaf, it worked better with the original for 3 loaves –plus it takes so long to make you might as well do 3 loaves
Bread making takes time and can’t be rushed (I learned this the hard way) -give yourself and afternoon, honestly
I killed my yeast the first time, thermometer purchase is necessary, the water has to be the perfect temperature: 110-115°F (I’m sure most expert bread makers know this but I thought I could just “feel out” the temperature for the yeast) 
The other reviews were very helpful with my process and I read a lot of them for tips & tricks

Once I got comfortable, I made a few modifications to turn this into a 12 (9?) grain bread:
-swapped the regular bread flour out for whole grain bread flour
-added a handful of 9 grain granola mixture prior to kneading (when you mix the bread flour with the wet ingredients)
-added milled flaxseed
-also only used 2 cups of whole wheat flour while kneading and only added more as needed
-once dough rose in pan, I sprinkled more of the 9 grain granola mixture on top of loaves; to do this I used an eggwhite solution to get it to stick to the crust ->1 eggwhite beaten with a teaspoon of milk

Very Good Bread!!  I Changed it from 3 loaves to 1 as I am alone and do not need 3 loaves of bread. I did "Cheat" a little however. I placed the ingredients in my bread machine on the DOUGH setting and then when finished put it in my loaf pan and baked it for 30 minutes. I let it cool for about 10-15 minutes and could not wait longer. It is about half gone and was just made yesterday, so I may need to make 2 loaves instead. LOL. I toasted some this morning for breakfast and it was great plain and with honey on it. I will be making this again in a few days and whenever I need bread. Thanks ever so much, Nita for posting this recipe.

This was the best whole wheat bread I've ever tasted. I never liked whole wheat bread, but I thought I'd try making this one mainly because my boyfriend is a fan. I thought his compliments were just because I was feeding him, but it was no joke. Just an all around great wholesome taste with a light touch of sweet honey. This is prime bread whether toasted with butter or jam or for a sandwich. I kid you not, I will no longer buy bread from the market because of bread like this. Definitely a favorite.

We loved this! And it was fairly 'simple'...my first bread that I've made without my mom. I added some flax seed to it as well. I would like to add more grains next time...just to make it healthier and have a little more texture. The flavor itself is great though!

I use this recipe as my guide for my weekly loaf of bread. It is delicious! It is also a very forgiving recipe. I often substitute whole wheat flour for the bread flour and it still tastes great as long as I add a couple extra tablespoons of water. Also, I regularly cut the amount of honey I use in half if I feel like a more savory loaf.

I've noticed that the quality of the flour I use actually does have a large influence on the flavor of the bread. I guess this should have been obvious to me, but it wasn't for whatever reason. Now that I've proven this to myself, I spring for the soft whole wheat flour that I can find in the bulk section of the "fancy" grocery store. It makes all the difference.

This was my first time ever making bread and it turned out amazing!  I changed two very small things: I used only whole wheat bread flour and I added 3 tbsps of flax seeds.  I found that mixing the finished dough with the hook accessory on my Kitchen Aid mixer for a few minutes on setting 2 was a helpful way to bring it all together.  I kneeded for a few minutes more but didn't need more than an additional 1/4 cup of flour.

*I also wanted to make some savory bread for dinner at the same time so I sliced some garlic and added some dried rosemary.  Worked fantastic.  I think this will be an excellent everyday bread/base recipe for specialty loaves.

Thanks so much!

I am new to bread making. This recipe has proven to be simple and turns out perfect every time. I use a bread machine to make the dough and then roll and place in bread pan to cook in the oven (after rising for about 30 minutes). I will never buy bread at the store again.

Good taste, a bit doughy but I believe that is because for some reason the dough fell a bit when taking off the towel from the last rise.  Not sure why it fell.  This is my first time making bread from scratch and not using a bread maker. Definately will make again.

Also known as Challah bread.  It's almost the exact same recipe as many challah braided breads.  Whatever you call it though, it is delicious.  I like it braided just because it looks prettier.

GREAT bread recipe, rave reviews from the kids (10 & 12) and hubby, who isn't fond of wheat bread.  We will be making this on a regular basis.  So excited to find a great bread recipe we can use instead of buying our bread.  Store bought just  doesn't compare.

So delicious! I made two loaves of bread and 16 buns with this recipe. They turned out great, so wonderful hot out of the oven with some butter and jam! Also makes excellent toast. I used this bread to make my husband's brown bag sandwiches of peanut butter and jam, and he said they were the best sandwiches he ever had (because of the bread!)

BEST BREAD RECIPE EVER, I'm 16 and me and my dad were having a bake off for money i won. this is so easy, i would suggest adding the flour slower because all flours have different protein content. this means you might have to add more or use less. lol if you add too much flour its not going to rise like my dads... lololol

This was very good bread.  I had to bake it a bit longer to get it to bake through completely, but it was fluffy, and the flavor was great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend likes white bread better than wheat, and substituting more bread flour for the wheat flour also tasted delicious.

Wow! Great bread.  Ground my own red winter wheat and tried to make this bread in my new Bosch mixer not knowing how it would turn out.  Added a touch more yeast and let it bubble up right in my Bosch mixer bowl....it worked great.  After the 30 minute wait I added the rest of the ingredients and used all 100% freshly ground wheat....let it mix with the dough hook for about 8 minutes, pulled it out of the bowl onto my pre-oiled counter top and broke it into even amounts.   Worked it into a bread pan shape with my pre-oiled hands and slammed it on the counter top a few times before setting it in my pans.  Let it rise for about 40 minutes and into the oven.  This was effortless with my new Bosch mixer and my 5 teenage kids and wife absolutely loved it.  Thanks allrecipes.com

i am SO happy i found this recipe! i have never baked bread (other than a traditional danish style ring at christmas) because it just seemed so involved. don't get me wrong, it IS involved but completely worth it. we made honey butter to go along with it and it was wonderful. we're making more for thanksgiving this year :)

I followed the directions exactly and when I let the loaves rise in the pans, they didn't get big enough.  I waited a very long time! I have made a lot of bread in my life, this one just didn't work out.

This was an amaziing bread recipe, my kids loved it! The only thing I might do different next time is add more whole wheat flour as recommended by another reviewer and make 4 loaves instead of 3 as the tempurture and baking time didn't seem to work out for me. Other than that, a great sweet bread with lovely flavor and texture, I highly suggest you try this one!

WOW! My first time making bread from scratch & this was a great recipe, easy to follow too.  first batch I followed exactly (except subbed agave nectar for honey like others). My family is racing about it. I'm waiting for the second batch to rise. I used a little molasses & sugar because I ran out of agave, then I added with the whole wheat flour one packet microwave organic oatmeal with flax. It looks delicious so far & no change in the rising properties or feel of the dough. I also used my kitchen aid mixer dough hook on speed 2 to knead it as suggested by another baker! I will update on how the oatmeal, molasses wheat comes out. Wonderful recipe, thank you so much
Update: I'm not buying bread anymore! My 14yo son loves this so much, even when I added extra"healthy stuff". I'm kind of addicted to making this now, keep thinking I will freeze lots, but my family is eating it too fast! My neighbor is also hooked & going to start making this too. Thank you Nita!

I bake lots of bread and have tried multiple recipes. This is GREAT. It also works really well with stone ground wheat flour in place of whole wheat flour. My family enjoys it for sandwiches or by itself.

Delicious!! I halved the recipe (with 2 cups bread flour and 2 cups wheat flour) following the review from Mommyfromseattle - including the vital gluten! I baked it for 30 minutes till temperature read 190 degrees. So soft on the inside and crunch on the outside with a hint of sweet! Perfection!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I am the mom of 7 children and this is the only bread my family will eat! It is so simple to make, and it is practically infallible! I love that it makes 3 large loaves, and it freezes very well! Guests who come over think that I have purchased the bread from a high end bakery! Are they ever survived when I tell them " I made it"!  This is the best bread recipe ever and I love making it and sharing it! The only problem I would say I have is finding storage bags big enough to put the loaf in! A problem I enjoy having!   
I recommend this recipe to all!  Thanks for sharing! You've made one family extremely happy!

My wife and I are experimenting with baking bread instead of buying it.  This was the best one we've found!  It was so light and moist.  It wasn't even half as dense as some as the other ones, making it ideal for sandwiches.  I only added a little vital wheat gluten to make the bread stick together better (I substituted it for some of the all purpose flour) and added a little more yeast.  Wonderful recipe!

I have passed this recipe around to everyone I know and they all say the same thing.  It is fail-proof!  Whether you decide to add a cup of oats or five grain cereal or a handful of sunflower seeds it always turns out perfectly.
We quit buying bread two years ago and I have been making this bread at least once a week since then.  All my neighbors know that Monday is baking day and that is when they show up at my door with goodies from their gardens knowing that I will repay their kind gestures with a loaf of this delicious fresh baked bread.

Easy recipe. The bread comes out soft, delicious. I made it with whole wheat flour only and it came out fantastic. You don't need to be a chef to follow this recipe.

I've been making a variation of this recipe for about 6 months now. I keep trying other recipes and then return to this one. Here are my changes. I change the recipe to yield 4 loaves - I have 7 kids :) I cut the water in half and add whole milk instead. I grind my own whole wheat flour just prior to making the bread and use King Arthur Special and whole wheat flour 50/50. I substitute virgin coconut oil for the butter. I make a yeast slurry with the liquid, honey and yeast, add that to the dry ingredients, add the rest of the honey and oil and let mix for 5 minutes. Always comes out great.

This bread came out excellent.  I added some vital wheat gluten and cut the recipe in half to make one 9x5 inch loaf mixed and kneaded by hand and used vegetable oil instead of butter.  This recipe is a keeper.  Also it worked fine with all purpose which is what I had on hand instead of bread flour.  Instead of brushing butter over the top I just laid a towel lightly over the bread while it cooled and it kept it nice and soft.

Me and my husband absolutely love this recipe!  My husband made french toast out of the bread and also used it in a meatball recipe as the bread crumbs.  This bread is simply versatile and I will continue to  make this over and over from now on.  I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfect every time!

OMG - this was DELICIOUS!!  I baked up two loaves and put the 3rd in the fridge to slow the final rise (only have 2 loave pans!) and will bake tomorrow.  I used instant yeast instead of active, because that's all I had (same amount), but it rose and baked beautifully.  Couldn't resist cutting a slice just out of the oven - heaven!  I would probably cut the honey back to 1/3 instead of 2/3 next time, just to save money, but the taste was superb.  My husband was jealous of how beautiful it looked too (his last attempt at a different recipe didn't turn out so well).  Will definitely make again.

Amazing!  Only the second time making bread and first time going solo, but it was super easy.  I don't have any honey, so  used 1/3 c. agave nectar and 1/3 c. sugar.  Still works.  Love the textrue, the flavor.  I may do as others did and add flax seed (or similar) to the bread next time.  Would be good for cinnamon bread or rolls as well which I will have to try.  Super easy, super delicious!

This bread is perfect!  I changed it up a bit, 1/4 cup of honey so it wouldn't be too sweet and reversed the flour 5 cups of wheat instead of 5 of white.  I made 2 small loaves, froze 2 more unbaked, and froze a 1/2 dozen dinner rolls all on this one batch.

We have made this bread every week for the last several months.  It's wonderful!  We added gluten, like someone else suggested (3 tbsp. to the bread flour, 1 tbsp. to the whole wheat flour), and it is really unbeatable.
Also, I meant to say:  we have made this in metal and ceramic.  We get a much better rise out of the ceramics!

Crucial:  flour should be measured by mass and not by volume.

Love this bread we make it several times per year and follow the recipe exactly as written. Careful not to overtake or it will dry out. My family requests this bread for holidays as rolls. I have officially taken over as the holiday bread maker from my elderly mother in law who baked the bread for 50 years.

I added some ground flax and a little extra butter. The bread is moist and tender. Next time I think I'll add a little more salt and perhaps some walnuts or sunflower seeds. YUM!

I followed the recipe as written.  The dough was much springier than normal dough -- it was fun to work with.  The bread is softer than the bread I normally make -- with the consistency similar to store bought bread.  The taste is great.  This is a nice all purpose bread to have on hand.

WOW! A yeast bread that turned out amazingly good. 
I have tried numerous yeast breads and have never been able to turn out something edible without using the bread machine. The bread machine is long gone, and thus was my ability to produce edible bread! 
Not anymore, this turned out great, wonderful, better than good. Pretty much followed recipe to a "T", but used 1 cup whole wheat and 4 cups white bread flour in first step, then addeded additional 3-4 cups of whole wheat later. Easily made 3 big loaves of bread. 
thanks for great addition to my kitchen

I made this for the first time and loved it! My husband and toddler went through 2 loaves over a weekend! So easy and delicious.

I used spelt flour as that was all I had, and agave nectar instead of honey. Still turned out amazing. I bake them every week now and freeze to make sure I have enough for my guys. 

Thank you Nita!

Absolutely fabulous!!! I swap the wheat flour and the bread flour (5 cups whole wheat and 3 1/2 white) so it takes a bit longer to rise, but so worth it! I have a really hard time finding good wheat bread recipes since I am not the best baker and I always swap to use more wheat than white flour. But this one is so simple and delicious. It makes great rolls too!

This wheat bread is very easy to make and tastes just like the whole wheat bread you'd purchase from the store. I only needed the 1 and 1/2 cups of wheat flour to make it not stick to the counter and feel like that the bread is very heavy on the wheat taste (I personally don't like wheat bread but try to teach the kids it's healthy). Maybe next time I'll add a little extra bread flour and a little less wheat...just for my personal taste. *note* I did use fresh yeast rather than active dry. But after reading up on it that shouldn't matter. 1 oz of fresh yeast = 1 package of active dry.

EDIT-
After sharing some of the bread I made with my in-laws I realized that most people love this bread. It makes wonderful toast as well.

This is an amazing bread..... Simply follow the directions and you can't go wrong. I have made many different breads and this one is the best for every day use ..... It makes the best toast ever! The trick to keeping it nice and fresh is to slice after it cools and freeze in zip lock bags. When you need a slice or two just grab and go..... It easily comes apart and thaws with no trace of freezer burn or staleness. Thanks for sharing!

I make this bread at least twice a week, once for our family and once for a neighbor.  It IS simple and DELICIOUS!  I use all whole wheat, no white at all, and I add 5 TBS gluten to make up for the bread flour.

Wonderful, simple bread. I used quick rise yeast, so I let it rise the first time only 10 minutes. I used 5 cups wheat flour and 3 cup white flour, and I changed the honey to 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar.

Hands down, this is my new favorite Wheat recipe. I agree with others, who found this to be forgiving (I hate recipes you can't play with!).  I didn't have honey, but I did have Agave Nectar and Honey Powder. I doubt it made much difference, because this bread is D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.  I had been using a recipe that called for milk and oil, so I was excited to try a reciped that I could  add just honey and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (It's pretty much all I use. I rarely buy butter, unless a recipe specifically calls for it.). This is my new back-pocket wheat. I forgot to add that I halved the recipe and made one loaf of bread. It made the perfect size for sandwiches. I've made it again since I wrote this review, and don't think I'd ever recommend making 3 loaves with this recipe-I'd make two loaves with the whole recipe, and one with half the recipe. Still my absolute favorite. It makes a terrific grilled cheese! Aloha.

I thought this recipe made a great sweet and soft loaf of bread!  I made two round loaves and one traditional.  I thought the texture of the round loaf was a bit better, maybe softer and more consistent?  The dough was very easy to work with. I needed about slightly less than 3 c. of the whole wheat.  I used my KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough.  I used gold medal bread flour for the white flour and a stone ground whole wheat.  I added a bit of ground flax seed.  This recipe is almost identical to the recipe on the back of the wheat flour I have, but this one has twice the amount of honey, which I like very much.

Made this exactly to instructions. All the tops were overdone by the end of 25 minutes while the entire lower half of each loaf was still quite raw. I'm not sure what happened, but I will probably not try this recipe again.

Simple, yummy.  I did not need as much flour as was stated.  Love that there's honey instead of sugar and I think if you wanted you could make it with all whole wheat flour.

This came out perfectly! The dough was very sticky, so I was a bit worried, but they rose high and very delicious! I will definitely be playing with this recipe to add more things to it, oats, cracked wheat, sunflower seeds, etc.

Best bread I ever made!! And I make a lot. I used my bread machine to make dough (added liquid ingredients, then flour, salt yeast). I also divided the recipe in half, and made two small loaves. So: added 1.5 cups warm water to bread machine pan, then 1/3 cup honey, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 2.5 cups bread flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1.5 tsp salt, 2 1/4 tsp yeast. Then selected "dough cycle". Then took dough out 2 hrs later, separated into two equal portions and baked at 350 for around 30 minutes. Superb bread.

Awesome recipe!!  I made this last week with all whole wheat bread flour & it ended up being as dense as a brick.  That was a TERRIBLE loaf, but of course I held off on rating the recipe because I didn't follow it exactly...  I made it again today (following the recipe) & it turned out wonderfully.  I used agave nectar instead of honey (and reduced to 1/2 c. total), and Earth Balance nondairy butter instead of butter.  Other than that, I followed it exactly & it's a gorgeous, delicious bread.  It will be perfect for sandwiches!  Oh, and MOST IMPORTANTLY (for me), it is EASY to cut into slices.  Too often I end up butchering homemade bread while cutting, but this bread was perfect for slicing.  LOVE this recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and each time it seems like the bread is gone in minutes with my family and friends begging for more. I love this recipe and it's great for experimenting with different proportions. The bread turns out a little on the sweeter side, so if you don't like your bread to be too sweet, I suggest cutting back on the honey.

This has become my go-to sandwich bread recipe, and is just delicious. I only make 1 loaf at a time in my bread machine, and I use about half the honey called for.  Beautiful, moist, delicious bread recipe. Thanks!

What a fantastic recipe! Since I only have two bread pans and was pushed for time, I wrapped up the last third of the dough and placed it in the fridge; thinking it'd be ruined by morning. But the next morning placed it in a bowl and I let it rise then rolled it out.   Last week I had made some fig preserves - I mashed up some of the figs and placed it about every second roll of the dough . . .YUMMY - it turned out fantastic and had gone into tummy's within 4 hours!!!! VERY GOOD and VERY EASY . . .it was especially good while it was still warm.

Soft and delicious. I didn't have enough honey on hand so I substituted agave nectar for half of the honey. It worked perfectly. Left out the butter and didn't miss it at all. Just brushed the crust with a little olive oil right out of the oven. This is my new go-to recipe for whole wheat bread. *** Just made this a second time but didn't have time for a double rise. Just shaped the dough and let it rise once. Still turned out delicious!

Loved it! I added some ground flax seed and used agave instead of the honey. Also I used straight whole wheat flour and no white flour. It is perfect! Next time I think I will add a few oats to the top, but it is hard to improve on this recipe!

Oh my!  So good!  I used rapid rise yeast.  I also used instead of some of the wheat flour, I used ground up old fashioned oats with about 1/3 cup of flax seed.  Toast is incredible!! YUM!!

I normally am not a fan of whole wheat bread, but this bread is the exception. I halved the recipe and followed one reviewer's advice and kept the 1/3 cup honey. The bread was not too sweet, had a nice crispy crust and a soft interior. The bread rose to perfection and was the easiest bread to make. I will make this my definitive wheat bread recipe and know I will make this recipe at least once a week. Thank you Nita!

I would just write a review geared toward other newbies like me. I made this bread yesterday and I had never made bread before, ever. This was very easy and turned out amazing (mostly). A few points:  In the first of my 3 loaves, I was not very careful getting out the air during/after "punching" the bread down. I noticed that this loaf ended up being very dense and not as fluffy and even consistency with the other two. So after the rise where it is supposed to double, "punch" down your dough and seperate it into three loaves, then take a rolling pin (I didn't have one, just used a large glass water cup) and flatten it in to a rectangle, notice you will see all the air bubbles come out in the ends. Get the air out, then roll up the dough like a jelly roll, seam on the bottom. Pinch the sides and tuck them under and lay in your loaf pan. This recipe didn't mention how to shape the loaves so I had to google it :) But it was pretty easy.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and let the dough rise in the dryer after a cycle. It was great! Thanks!   Anyway, I loved this bread, it turned out nice for basic wheat bread. Next time I will make it sweeter, I have a major sweet tooth - maybe add some cinnamon and brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I have ended my search for bread. After weeks of looking for the best homemade bread I could find, this is it! HINT FOR KITCHEN AID USERS: CHANGE THE "SERVINGS" SIZE TO GIVE YOU THE 1 (12 servings) OR 2 (24 servings) LOAF RECIPES RATHER THAN 3 (36 servings). OUR KITCHEN AIDS WORK TERRIFIC WITH THE SMALLER AMOUNT OF DOUGH!   LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe and it is now M.I.N.E.!!!  :-)

I use 100% stone ground whole wheat flour. Azazing recipe. I cut the recipe in half and still came out with two big loafs of bread. Follow the recipe to a T, no complications, a very soft moist texture.

This is the first recipe I've been able to use 100% wheat flour (5 cups pastry, 3 1/2 cups regular whole wheat flour) and not have it come out really dense.  Thank you!

This makes really good, easy bread.  The crust is a bit crunchy, and the bread is not dry or crumbly.  I used multigrain flour in place of the white flour (since my multigrain flour has white flour in it).  YUM!  Be careful it doesn't burn. I found it browned quickly and had to cover it with foil.

Very delicious! I reduced the recipe by half and made one plump loaf- and I also used only whole wheat flour, and it came out fantastic! It was so moist and hearty- give it a try!

Really good bread! I also added 3T of gluten and it turned out great. I can't eat as much bread as this recipe makes so I divided the dough in half. With one half I made a large loaf of bread. With the other half, I took out about 1/3 and made 5 hamburger buns and rolled the rest into cinnamon rolls.

So yummy and perfect.  This was my very first attempt at bread making and while I over kneaded the dough instead of just punching it down, it turned out very well if not a tad heavy.  Nice and sweet.

This recipe is so tasty. Up until a month ago I had never made homemade yeast bread before and then I found this recipe. It's simple enough for beginners and turns out beautifully. Ive since then made 6 loaves and will have to make another batch soon. Even my super  picky husband likes it!

We loved this bread!!! I made 2 large loaves & 2 small loaves (for my 4 yr old-she likes to have her own)I used a little less bread flour & a little more wheat flour I also subbed 1/2 c. 7 grain cereal for some of the wheat flour (it was what was left in the package). I'm making it again today!!So yummy plain or toasted with butter or honey butter. My kids devoured it!

I'm so happy I found this recipe!  This is by far the best wheat bread recipe I've made.  The flavor and texture are perfect.  I think the amount of honey is just right.  I froze two of the balls of dough (as suggested by other reviewers) and I have baked one of them and it turned out perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Not sure if I did something wrong (thought I followed the directions to a T other than cutting everything to 1/3 (I only wanted one loaf) but the bread was too dense. Taste was good but somehow something needs to be done to make it a lighter loaf.

Very very good! I really like the taste of this bread and it keeps very well! mine didn't make 3 loaves however, it only made 2 loaves for 9X5 inch pans. very simple to make too, it's not a hassle to make at all! perfect for weekly sandwich bread! thanks!

also, i like a very wheaty bread. So instead of using 5 cups of bread flour at the beginning, i used 2 1/2 cups bread flour and 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. And it was just as amazing as it would've been by just working in the whole wheat flour. also, more healthy for you too!

I have made many, many, loaves of bread but "This Is The One"  I wanted a bread that made good toast that was healthy but not heavy.  I made mine in the kitchen aid and let it knead for 5 minutes.  I put butter on the top when they came out of the oven and because I live in the Prairies where it is very dry I  added 3 tsp gluten.  Now I can get rid of all those other recipes

Best bread I've made. Hands down! The dough freezes beautifully (thanks to responses made earlier). Give 24 hours to thaw in the fridge and then rise again in your greased baking dish.  No more store bought bread for me. Thanks again!

its a perfect recipe for home made fresh bread. i tried it today and it turned out really good. the only thing i made a change to the recipe is i used very less honey as i thought that the honey that mentioned in the recipe might make it too sweet and me and my hubby both dont like sweet bread, the bread turned out really good.......

Just awsome!  Used all purpose flour, didn't seem to affect the outcome.  This is my new favorite bread recipe!

Wow!  This bread reminds me of the ones brought out by nice steakhouses at the beginning of your meal.  Like others, I added whole flax seed and decreased the honey by half.  I also used a higher ratio of whole wheat flour.  I recommend using a high quality flour.

This was the first time I have ever made bread, maybe I started with something too hard. I don't know what I did but I didn't do something right! I followed everything to the T but...It was a mess. Any helpful pointers would be great! Thanks

Great flavor, not to wheat-ey (I'm not a fan of super dense wheat bread)... though texture is softer than I anticipated. I know oven times/temps vary, but these loaves weren't close to done at 25 minutes... took 40 minutes for two loaves (I froze the third) at 350°.

This is a truly great bread recipe. I only wanted one loaf,so I cut everything down by 1/3. A little tricky, but I managed. I did, however, use an entire package (1/4 oz.) of yeast. The bread had a nice, soft texture, and a homey taste. It was delicious with butter and fresh strawberry jam!

This is just the bread recipe I've been searching for.  It tastes wonderful and its not difficult to make.  My favorite thing about it is that it makes three loaves.  So you can freeze the others, take one out for the second rise when you need it, and pop it in the oven.   I use a cake pan instead of a bread pan because I like how the shape turns out.  I bake it for only 22-23 minutes and its just right.

This bread was too big for my Kitchen Aid mixer so I took it out and hand kneeded it for about five minutes.  I also used maple syrup for the first honey and sugar for the second.  I also think that it only makes two loaves for the real size bread for sandwiches.  Very good and I can't wait to make other things with it such as rolls and bread sticks.  I didn't use the butter at the end but just sprayed with pam when it came out of the oven and it was wonderful.

Ya!! Success:) I am so happy! Thank You Nita,I love this bread! I, according to my kids, am not that great a baker,until this bread. It was a little heavy,I even added a bit more yeast,maybe a 1/2 tsp. just to hedge my bets. I used the refridge method for the first rise, excellent results! the The flavor was really nice.

Delicious and super easy to make.  I did halve the recipe to make one huge loaf..still great, but very dense.  All in all, I love the recipe but will maybe make in two loaf pans next time.

Wow! This bread is sooo amazingly good. It has the perfect texture, moist and chewy. And the taste is great! I was a little worried that it might be too sweet, I don't like sweet bread, but it had just a hint of sweetness. I'm hooked!

It was good! I proofed the yeast first before adding the white flour by combining the warm water, honey, and yeast... let it sit about 15 minutes and then add the flour and let it sit again for half hour... worked well. I think it was a little too sweet for my taste in wheat bread so next time I will not add so much honey, maybe will try a little oil instead.

Absolutely wonderful.  It is my family's favorite recipe and we love the simple ingredients.  I do switch the white / wheat ratio.  I add the 5 cups of wheat first ... then the rest in white flour

Very tasty and moist bread that stays fresh.  I followed the recipe as written since there were a few good reviews about the original.  I say that because I'm always amazed at reviews that say, oh, I changed this ingredient and that method, etc, etc....if you do that, you're not making the same recipe so what good does your review do?!  Kudos to Nita for a good, easy bread recipe.  I've made it every weekend for the last 3 weeks and will probably be making more today.  My family loves it!

This yields a delicious denser bread. I did not use white bread flour, but a whole wheat bread flour. I don't know what happened but my loaves wound up being a little bit smaller, even after allowing plenty of rising time.  Possibly my yeast was getting old, but I will try again. Either way, it didn't affect the taste, just the height. Delicious warm and with butter.

delicious! this was my first attempt at bread making and it took two tries for me to get the proper results. the first time my dough didn't rise AT ALL and after retracing my steps and doing a little research i realized the water i'd used was WAY too hot and it killed the yeast. the second time around got the results i was looking for. puffy, chewy, delicious wheat bread. thanks for a fabulous recipe for a first time bread maker!

This recipe is perfection!  I have made several previously disappointing attempts at baking bread in the past.  And so I was absolutely delighted (and shocked) when my loaves came out BEAUTIFULLY!  I halved the recipe and used 2 8X4 inch loaf pans.  I used 2 cups bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.  I used 1/3 cup of honey.  I look forward to using more whole wheat flour next time, as well as adding some extras (flax seeds, sunflower seeds, etc).  My kids gobbled up several slices right out of the oven -- drizzled with a bit of honey -- YUM!  This one is a definite keeper!

Delicious! I made the whole thing in the food processor. I put the water, honey and yeast in the food processor, pulsed a few times, and let it proof for a few minutes. I then let it rise (in the food processor) for half an hour. I then pulsed 1 or 2 times to punch it down. I added the ingredients, and the amount of flour called for in the ingredient list which ended up being the perfect amount to make the batter sticky, but fall away from the sides a little.   I scooped it out, sprayed a bowl with olive oil pam and then sprayed the dough with it too and let it sit for an hour. As a side note I love pam olive oil because it contains only olive oil and is great for lightly greasing anything, (including food) without over doing it with oil out of the bottle.   I will definitely keep this recipe!!

i started baking bread for the first time last Oct or Nov.  I substitute the butter with Olive Oil.  Sometimes, I use 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 honey and it really tastes the same.  THIS RECEIPE IS DELICIOUS.  I CAN't  make enough of it.  My sister has 4 grown children and all of my friends and family absolutely love it.   i bought a new Kitchen Aid mixer just for this bread    IT IS WONDERFUL.   I also brush top with olive oil instead of butter.

Outrageously good!  I'll use this recipe for my WW bread.  It knocks the top rated store bought WW bread out of the competition.  Thank you, MommyFromSeattle for many of your suggestions; I used 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup sugar and added 4T vital wheat gluten.  I also opted to bake 2 loaves instead of 3 and this produced nice tall sandwich sized bread.  25 minutes is perfect; this has such a soft texture.  Thanks for letting me try this excellent recipe!  EDIT 6/29/09: I would go with baking for 30 minutes as today, when I cut into the middle of the loaf, it was slightly underbaked.

I only used 3 cups of white flour, and the rest multigrain (didn't have whole wheat) and this turned out amazing!  It was fluffy like a store bought loaf, but healthy and delicious like homemade.  I will definitely make this again and try with whole wheat flour.  I was able to use my stand mixer for most of it, but did knead it at the end so my 2.5 year old could get his hands gooey.

This is the best whole wheat bread I have eaten- better than store bought.  I substituted sugar for the honey and ended up using the additional 4 cups whole wheat flour.  I allowed an additional 1/2 hour for the rise and was able to get 3 loaves so I shared it with family and friends.  It is now our weekly ritual, even my 2 year old gets into the act of kneading!! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This is my first time making bread. I followed this recipe to the T, and I made it by hand because I dont have a mixer. I made it into 2 giant loaves, one for my family and one for my boyfriend. It turned out fabulous. It was so, so perfect. My dad, who doesnt like wheat bread or even a hint of sweetness in his bread, liked it. And my brother said "I love you" when he ate this bread. It was so successful, I am so pleased. I was going to buy bread maker but now I realize I dont need one. Next time I might try adding flax and sunflower seeds, as well as mixing in more wheat flour in place of bread flour. I love it.

I decided this bread seemed easy enough so i decided to try it. I used all purpose flour cause it was the only other flour i had besides the whole wheat flour, and used 3 tbls melted crisco instead of butter cause i did not have butter! but all turned out well and this is the best bread recipe ive tried yet! the inside was soft and fluffy!

This recipe is delicious!  The key is to keep it moist but not too moist that it is sticky.  I put it in the oven for 15 minutes and turn then for another 15 minutes.  Sometimes I have to place a piece of foil over the tops so they do not over brown.  Great EASY recipe!

I have tried this recipe two times.  Each time the bread is raw/undercooked in the middle.

this bread is awesome. I make it almost every sunday and it never fails. it is very versatile too. If I don't have butter, i use Olive Oil, I add flax seeds, sunflower seeds, etc. TRY IT!

This was the very first time that I have EVER made any sort of bread and I have to say that it turned out delicious! I was a little concerned at one point, but simply because it was my first time. The directions were so simple and so easy to follow. Once we got it baked and allowed it to cool off, my husband immediately cut into it to "try it out". With this recipe, I won the Greatest Wife in the World award because I baked him bread..lol.

This makes very good bread.  One thing I've changed, though, is substituting blackstrap molasses for the honey because I find honey whole wheat bread to be too sweet.

I make this using all whole wheat flour(5 cups + 2-3 cups more) and I add just 1/2 C. honey to the water when I warm it up for the yeast.I get 2 large loaves with this recipe; I also slice it and freeze after it cools, then we take out of the freezer as needed(if you freeze while still warm the slices are harder to seperate).This recipe is also great for dinner rolls!

So good! It's just sweet enough to make you think it's not wheat bread. :) Just remember that it requires a BIG bowl, since it makes a lot of dough.

Absolutely wonderful!!! I am new at baking bread and this was great - i scaled the recipe to make two loaves, made one as is and the other into cinnamon-raisin and they both rocked!!  The only change I made to the recipe is to substitute molasses for half of the honey.  The only change i will probabl make in the future is to use half whole wheat and half white whole wheat.  I want my kids eating whole grains rather than all white stuff (but half whole grain is better than none !)  Thanks for the recipe !!! It will be my standard wheat recipe from now on!

Wonderful recipe! I reduced the amount of white flour to 2 cups and use wheat for the rest. I also used only 1/3 cup honey and did 1/3 cup molasses and thought it gave a richer, deeper flavor to the bread. Love it!

In the end this bread turned out pretty well. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but next time I think I'll make a few changes - first off - I think this makes two good sized loaves of bread rather than 3 small loaves. Second - I would try and cut down on the amount of bread flour in the beginning and add some more wheat flour. Other than the loaves being a bit small and the bread not being too dark I think it turned out tasty, although it was a bit hard to make with no appliances to help.

I registered to the site only to be able to comment on this recipe. I too have been on a quest to bake the perfect whole wheat loaf. Last week I was determined to nail it and baked 6 different loaves in as many days. This one won by a mile! I really like it. Better than the bread from our bakery (which I really like too, btw). Probably not that much cheaper, maybe flour in the US is cheaper than in Australia? But worth every cent. I did get a bit confused about how much flour I needed. I made half the quantity and also let the breadmaker do the kneading. Only when the dough cycle was finished and I saw the sloppy dough did I realise that I missed something. So I added another cup 1/2 (?) of flour and kneaded it in for about 3 minutes. Still came out perfect! The only downside to the recipe that I can think of is the need to let it sit for 30 mins. That means it takes close to 2 hours from starting it to putting it in the oven. For a time poor sole mother, that requires careful planning. I also had to leave it in the oven for longer than 30 mins. Maybe my dough was still a bit too wet? I do like my bread quite dry.

I love this recipe. I have changed only a few things. I use 5 1/2 C whole wheat flour and 3 C. bread flour. for each loaf I measure out 28 oz. per loaf and it makes a perfect loaf. I also kneed the dough with my kitchen aid dough hook. I have not bought bread since I first started making bread. I also place the yeast in the water 112 degrees with 1/3 C. honey and let it proof before adding it to the first stage of the recipe. then follow recipe as it is. makes fabulous toast. Char

Love this!  I use 5 - 6 c. whole wheat flour (I grind my own, and is lighter and better than store-bought -- sooooo worth the price of the grinder) and 2 - 3 c. bread flour.  I also add approx. 1/4 c. of ground flax seeds.  It has worked perfectly for me every time.  The secret to using more whole wheat flour, is to knead it extra long and really well to get the gluten going.  I use my Bosch and mix it on 2 for about 10 minutes.  I also store my whole wheat flour, flax seed and yeast in the freezer to keep the nutrients and let my sit on the counter for 15 min or so to warm up before using them.  I look forward to trying this with 100% whole wheat, but it is so perfect for me now, that I hestitate to ruin it.  I have been using this recipe for quite a while and it is great!  I often have to do this 2x/week, as my family gobbles it up and I end up giving away at least one loaf each batch!  Thanks, tons!!!

I continue to have problems making whole wheat bread,  I have tried this recipe twice, the firs time with reg. flour so that failure seems ok. but this last time I used white bread flour and whole wheat flour and yet my results are less than aceptable.  The dough rises fine the first time and is very rewarding, but the last rise in 3 bread pans is less than perfect.  The dough only rises to the top of the pan and no more.  The bread tastes great but is way too dense and nothing like a slice of bread.  Very dense and not high at all, however the flavor is great and I would love to get it to rise properly.  Anyone have suggestions???  I cannot understand why the second rise is so dissapointing.  Could it be that this is a Recipe for only two loves, and I am not putting enough dough in each pan.  I dont know but I have never been able to get an acceptable whole wheat loaf in many years.  I gave up some time ago, but know am determined to make it work.  Please feel free to Email me with advice.  Thanks

do not hesitate in making htis bread.  It rises beautifully and turns out HUGE loaves.  I added sunflower seeds and next time will cut back on the white flour and try with more whole wheat.  I did cut back a bit on the honey but not too much.  Great tasting loaf!

I made this recipe for my mother who is on a low cholesterol diet.  It is by far the best whole wheat bread recipe that I have made.  I love that it is sweetened with honey.  Honey has no cholesterol and very low in sodium.  I added extra to the dough and I also used 4 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour.  My younger siblings also enjoyed the bread very much.  They usually hate wheat bread.  I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.

Great recipe!  The bread turned out light and fluffy and tasted awesome.  Since I only have one loaf pan at the moment, I scaled the recipe down to 19 servings, which resulted in using 1 whole packet of yeast.  Also, I discovered I was out of honey, so I substituted brown sugar, using 2 Tbs for each of the two measurements.  I'm DEFINITELY going to buy more loaf pans so I can make the full recipe next time.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious! I had only made two other loaves of bread before and it was superbly easy to follow the recipe. The result was fantastic. I will use this recipe over and over. Everyone who tries this bread loves it. *Update* I've made this bread five times since and every single time it's a hit. My friends are begging for me to make it, and my boyfriend loves to eat it in sandwhiches. I even made this bread for a class and the teacher raved about it so much that I gave her the other loaf I had made. I am not a very experienced baker, but I recommend for everyone to try and make this, it's delicious and relatively easy to make. It does require some time, but what I do is study for each hour I proof the bread or whatever and it works out well. There is nothing better than fresh out of the oven bread that you made yourself. Plus the smell of bread in the oven is scrumptious.

I've made this bread twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. The second time, I added more honey (abou5 1/3 cup) because I really like a sweet wheat bread. The thing I like about this bread is that it's very adaptable. You can make it more or less sweet, add sunflower seeds, add oats...it's a great base for a wheat bread and it's the one I plan to use from now on.

The easiest bread I've ever made. Even if you've never made bread before you can make this, and it tastes fabulous as is, or ammended with flax seed (2T) or pulverized oatmeal (1 cup) or with more whole wheat and less white flour...it's good every time.  Perfect for sandwhiches,or toast, and a time saver in that it makes 3 loaves at once. Lasts a week on the counter, and freezes well, just thaw on a rack! Great recipe.  Thanks!

I halved this recipe, which made one full loaf (sandwich bread size) plus about 4 rolls to sample. It took quite a while from start to finish, about 5 hours, but I don't have much experience with whole wheat flour. I kneaded the dough in my KitchenAid on speed 2 for quite a while (15 mins. or so) until I was satisfied with the feel of the dough. Then I let it rise for about an hour and 15 minutes until it was doubled. I formed my rolls and my loaf, and let rise for another half hour before baking. It came out pretty good in the end, although pretty heavy and a bit more dense than I would've liked - but it had great depth and flavor. This is a really good breakfast bread to eat toasted with cream cheese, butter, honey, jam or anything else you can think of. Good recipe as long as you know what to expect. If I were to change anything, I'd probably use less dough per loaf and let it rise longer to produce a lighter loaf for sandwich bread.

We all love this bread!  I scaled it down to 24 servings to make 2 loaves.  I made the dough in my Kitchenaid.  I didn't have bread flour, so just used AP.  Next time I make it, I'll try to use more whole wheat flour.  This bread is so delicious with homemade strawberry freezer jam!

Good recipe, excellent taste. It is really easy to make too. I like that is makes only 3 loaves and not too much like other recipes. Made twice already. What I did not like is that the recipe didn't say how long to let it rise in the bowl. I left it for 45 minutes and the top of the dough dried out a bit even with a towel over the bowl. I also reduced the oven to 325º.

This is the first bread I ever made and I have now made it twice. I freeze the extra loaves and they are still fantastic. I also took the dough for the 3rd loaf and divided it into four small loaves. Baked them in mini loaf pans and they are great to pull out for a dinner or to make small toast in the AM.

My first homemade bread, and it turned out fantastic!!! Even with three loaves, they didn't last very long, they were sooo good! also, I added sunflower seeds and flax seeds for a nice toasty flavor. And topped it with sesame seeds and egg white, for a nice golden look.

My new conquest is bread, and this is a winner! I subbed white sugar for the honey, I may try brown next time for a richer flavor. I mixed it in my KitchenAid, but did all the kneading by hand. The flavor was spot on, the texture was perfect, it rose beautifully (which is an accomplishment for me!), and it kneaded really nicely. I switched the flours, used whole wheat bread flour, and all purpose, respectively, with no adverse effects. I ended up making buns with half the dough, and a giant loaf of bread with the other. Both are wonderful! Highly recommend, especially for beginners!

I've been making this recipe now for over a year and it turns out perfect every time.  Sometimes I vary it with additions such as wheat germ or cracked wheat, and it does great.  We never purchase bread from the store any more.

This bread Rocks! I was my first time making a wheat bread, and i wont go back to store bought unless i really have to because this is soooo much better.  I let the doughs do a final rise in the bread pans until about an inch or 2 out off the top, and baked.  Brushed with butter on top when done, and Let cool COMPLETELY before slicing, and mmmm mmm mmmm good! thx

Great recipe! I left out the last 1/3 cup of honey, and it still tasted great. I made 2 loaves of bread and a pan of cinnamon rolls, because I only have 2 loaf pans. The loaves were a little smaller than I am used to, so next time I will use all the dough between the 2 loaf pans. Tasted great! Thanks!

A great basic bread! I am still fairly new to making yeast breads, but this one was simple and came out great. I followed the recipe exactly. Will make again!
PS- It freezes well and makes awesome grilled cheese sandwiches!

This is very good bread.  My only complaint is that mine came out a bit heavy....I was hoping for a "fluffier" bread.  Regardless, it's very good.

ok ...this recipe is awesome!
I made it in a dual loaf bread machine borrowed from my friend.
The bread tastes great.  I followed someone else's advice and only used the first amount of honey- we don't like overly sweet bread, and often whole wheat bread is too sweet.

My 1/3 recipe for two smaller loaves is:

1 cup warm water ----           
2 tsp yeast ( I used red star bulk which said 
               1 Tbsp =1 pkg---
1 3/4 TBSP honey---    
1 2/3 cup bread flour*---    
1 TBSP sea salt---   
1 1/6 cup whole wheat flour ---   

*We have several food allergies, so instead of using regular bread flour,I used a combo of  white whole wheat flour and potato starch.  1 TBSP potato starch per cup of flour to make bread flour, put the TBSP of potato starch on the bottom of the cup,then measure white flour to make one cup      

I made a third of a batch for each loaf pan in the dual loaf bread machine, I actually started with the yeast/warm water/honey first to let the yeast work a bit longer because I used half white whole wheat flour and half whole wheat.   That loaf turned out really well- it did over rise a bit and was touching the top of the loaf pan at first rise, but the machine punched it down and it was fine.              
   The dough looked a little dry when it first started mixing so I added 2 tsp of water to it as it was kneading per bread mak

I have made this bread three times and it is perfect! The bread is chewy and soft. It saves well in the freezer, tasting just as fresh with a room temperature defrost. My 80 year old father-in-law says that it tastes just like the bread his mother made when he was a child in the Ozarks. 
Thank you for the amazing recipie.

Since Christmas I have been trying different bread recipes and this is the best one so far!!!!! I did however substitute brown sugar for the honey (because I had none). I also substituted some whole wheat for the bread flour and didn't need all of the 3 1/2 cups of w.w flour (just add it in 1/2 cup increments). The first time I made it I made 3 loaves but they came out small for my liking so the next time I just made 2 loaves. This was a better size for me. My husband even complimented me on this bread. It was very soft and easy to make. This is now my favorite bread recipe

Excellent recipe! I halved the recipe and made the dough into rolls about a golf-ball in size each. Then I let them rise to about twice the size before baking them in a 350-degree oven on a baking stone. They were PERFECT - and a total hit at a potluck. I have already made them three times in the past week! I great (and lightly sweet) recipe!

This bread turned out pretty good.  I added 5 heaping T. of vital wheat gluten, and I think that was a little much.  The crumb was a little *too* soft.  Maybe 3 next time.  Also, it didn't rise very high.  I took 1/3 of the dough for rolls, so maybe I took too much.  Next time I'll try 2 loavs for the whole batch.  The flavor is really good.

The second time I made this I used light corn syrup instead of honey to keep the sweetness but get rid of the fermented honey smell. I also found it easier to bake all 3 loaves & then freeze 2 of the loaves after baking. When I froze the dough, it took 1/2 a day to rise before cooking.

The flavor of this bread is delicious! My husband even proclaimed it better than his mom's bread, so you know it's good. My two year old assisted in the making, and it still turned out great, so the recipe is obviously pretty hard to mess up.  Next time, I'll try adding more wheat flour and less bread flour.

This was my first time making bread, and it turned out great! The flavor is nice and rich, and it's so soft. Although after mixing together the yeast and flour, it did take closer to an hour to get big and bubbly, not 30 minutes like the recipe says. I also accidentally kneaded it drier than was called for, and it still turned out fine. Five stars; I'll definitely make this again.

My whole family and all our friends love this recipe! I always receive compliments on this bread. I've used the recipe as is once or twice and it turned out excellent! Whenever I bake bread I always go to this recipe. It hasn't disappointed me or anyone else once. Very simple and easy to make. I did change the recipe a little bit to fit my family's needs. Instead of Bread Flour, I used Kamut. Other than that, everything else is the same. The texture is light and fluffy (even with the Kamut version) and GREAT tasting!

I absolutely adore this bread!  I've never made bread in the oven before so I was incredibly pleased at how easy this recipe is.  Not only that, the bread is light and delicious.  I followed the directions exactly in regards to ingredients.  The only thing I didn't follow is I didn't wait until it was "cooled completely" before eating some!

The last whole-wheat bread I made was so horrible that I had to throw it away still warm from the oven.  I probably wouldn't have tried this one if I hadn't been out of hamburger buns.  The reviewers who called it forgiving certainly aren't lying.  I let it rise in my oven on the lowest setting but the oven got a lot hotter than I had expected and the dough had more than doubled in half an hour.  I feared the worst but it turned out great.  It sliced easily and was lovely toasted.  Had a nice, delicate flavour - not too sweet, not too hearty or yeasty.

I've been looking for the "perfect" bread recipe for awhile, and I think I've found it! I can't bake loaves fast enough...it's been a hit with everyone. This makes fantastic toast. The texture is light and full; the crust is crunchy but not hard. I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

This was soooo simple, yet fantastic.  I had freezed the one loaf as recommended by another poster.  Kind of wished I hadn't.  Went through the first loaf in a flash, and gave away the second loaf with a meal to a friend...  GREAT!

This was the best bread recipe I have tried so far.  I made two loaves and a dozen cloverleaf rolls.  The rolls could have baked a few minutes less than the rolls so as to not be so crusty.  But the taste, consistancy, everything was perfect.  My son said it's the best bread he's ever tasted.  Thanks for the delicious, easy recipe.

I used oil in place of the butter as I keep kosher and wanted to be able to eat the bread with a meat meal. The bread is delicious. I took a loaf to a potluck with some hearty soup and it was a hit!

This is a keeper. I made it as two large loaves. I don't buy bread flour, but I do buy vital wheat gluten. I added three tablespoons.

2nd time making - cut recipe in half , for one loaf. Added flax seeds, chia seeds, and some quick oats. Also, added gluten to flour (about 5 tsp - removing 5 tsp of flour), it turned out great.

This is a very nice bread for sandwiches. You can put it in two 5*9 loaf pans instead of three for a more sandwich sized slice. I am eleven years old and I made this by myself so it is an easy recipe. I mixed it using a kitchen aid and then finished kneading it by hand.

Phenomenal. Soft and sweet and just right. I wrapped two of the three loaves in plastic after the first rise and froze them so we can have fresh bread for weeks. I'm glad I did that, because we would have eaten it all in the first 48 hours if I hadn't - this stuff is GOOD.

This should not be even classified as "whole wheat" since it is not. With more white flour than whole wheat this should be listed as a wheat bread and not whole wheat.

Thanks to reading other reviewers suggestions, the first time I made this I hit it out of the bread making ballpark!! I felt like a bonafide baker and wanted to take my freshly baked loaf in my convertible and drive it around the neighborhood like a 4th of July parade!!!

Cut the recipe to make only 2 loaves instead of 3.  It was perfect.  Looked just like the photo.  My neighbor was thrilled because he go the 2nd loaf.  I will make this again.  It was easy and turned out great.

It's like crack. Such an addicting bread, and so easy to make. My first time ever making bread and it was a BIG HIT! Followed instructions exactly EXCEPT I kneaded a bunch after adding additional wheat flour. Oops lol Probably didn't "knead" to do that but I had another recipe on the brain. It's not as time consuming as you'd think. And you get 3 loaves for just a couple of hours work.

This is a great starter recipe. I tripled the ingredients to get six loaves. A little too sweet for everyday bread for us the first time around so this time, I cut the honey in half... actually, I cut the salt in half as well. Added oats, flax, chia, and wheatgerm. Tastes yummy!

This has become my go-to bread recipe. My family loves it and it's very simple. I buy organic and GMO free ingredients and flam able to feel great about making a bread my family loves that has no preservatives. It also freezes well. I personally use a little less of the whole wheat flour as it rarely needs more than the additional 2 cups, from my experience. Tastes great with jam or honey or just butter. People often ask me for this recipe after they have tried it. If you're the type who doesn't mind hand making bread, I would absolutely recommend this recipe, any day!

WOW, this worked very nicely for me.
I used my sourdough sponge, 2 cups and substituted 1/3 of a cup white vinegar for an equal amount of  water and added 1/2 of a cup of molasses. 
GR8 loaf and texture, fantastic flavor!
THANK YOU!

We loved this bread & it is so easy to make!  I made 2 good size loaves and 6 rolls.  Next time I'll try using mostly whole wheat flour and a bit less honey as I'd like it to be a bit healthier than it is as written.

This is the first bread I ever made. My family loves it. I only used white flour in the recipe. The bread slices really good and as thin as you want, I'm not a fan of thick toast. Give it a try, I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

Make bread rarely and do not have a bread machine. This was easy recipe, and unused rapid riding yeast. Bread came out very nice, soft and tasty. It  was an instant hit with the family. While baking it made the entire house smell amazing !

I LOVE this recipe! It turned out so well the first time that I am making it again now. I had never made bread from scratch before this recipe, so if it turned out well for me, anyone can do it! I don't keep bread flour in the house, but I found a substitution that works well. Add 1.5 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt for each cup of all purpose flour to make a bread flour. So, for this recipe that calls for 5 cups of bread flour, 7.5 tsp baking powder and 1.25 tsp salt.... The smell that will fill your house while this dough is rising and baking is HEAVENLY! And this bread is good enough that you could bring a warm loaf or two to friends or neighbors. GOOD LUCK!

This is my go to bread recipe. Been using it for years. Changes include using whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, occasionally add ground golden flax seed. Don't use a whole tablespoon of salt usually. Always delicious!

very easy to make! I used all whole wheat flour and it was fluffy and moist. the trick to making WHOLE wheat bread is to make sure you don't add too much flour. I made mine in a mixer and I stopped adding flour when the dough pulled away from the sides of the bowl, cleaning itself as it goes.

This is the ultimate bread recipe.  Light, fluffy perfect loaves.  It's never failed me no matter how many little tweeks I make to the recipe.  I make 3 loaves of this bread a week.  We all love it.Thank you for sharing.

This bread was so simple to make and my family raved about it!  I used coconut oil instead of butter. I had all but two Tbsps  of the needed honey, so I replaced it with coconut sugar.  The directions were excellent, and I followed to the letter, just added 2 minutes baking time to allow for my under heating oven.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, and plan to make it many times in the future.  Thank you,  thank you for this!

Absolutely fabulous recipe. This delicious bread is a family favorite. I made no changes to the recipe other than dividing the dough into 2 loaves instead of 3. We go through about a loaf per week so I make the recipe twice a month. No more supermarket bread for us.

This is a fantastic recipe. I adjusted the servings to 12 (divided by 1/3) for one 9x5 pan and found it to be perfect when baked at 350 for 30 minutes. I added about a half-cup total of different seeds and ground flax (and decreased the bread flour), and it was delicious. Next time, I will taken another reviewer's advice and make the full amount, freezing 2/3 after the first rise. Thank you, Nita!

I made this yesterday after seeing the recipe. I found the powered gluten and was so happy to use that. I think I added a little bit too much flour as even my kitchen aid had a hard time. I failed to see it said add 2 cups first then more as you go.  But it was delish, and I think I ate half the loaf myself. Gave one to my friend and the other in the freezer. Best recipe!!!Thank you

This is a great recipe, I was very impressed by the results. Soft enough that it is a delight to bite into and yet just the right density and chewiness. I did grind my own whole wheat flour and used raw honey and it yielded fantastic results. I was a little skeptical after the dough was kneaded as it seemed a little too soft and wet, but it worked out just fine. I did follow another reviewers tip for it rising in the oven and it worked splendidly. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a very forgiving recipe and amenable to a lot of changes.  The first time I made it, I made no changes excepting I never use bread flour, adding 3T. of gluten. The crust and crumb is lovely for slicing and toasting.  Since the first time, I add all the ingredients excepting the AP flour, proofing the yeast while the butter melts and the honey pours.  Then mix and let the whole mess rest for about 30 minutes.  I then knead in the AP flour via mixer then by hand.  Oh, I also use only about 3 cups of AP flour increasing the whole wheat or substituting ground oatmeal.  I don't bother with the melted butter at the end.  This has become my standard whole wheat recipe, thank you  Nita.

This is a great recipe, made two loafs and the last loaf I made buns.
They were perfect for sandwiches and will be awesome for burgers. Making this again for guests at our B&B, it's that good! Will use it for stuffed French toast and just plain old toast.  Nothing better than homemade with a great recipe.

Turned out great!  My only complaint was that it needed salt...then I looked at the recipe again and saw that it was there, I just missed it!  Don't skip the salt.  Great recipe!

Wow! this is by far my family's favorite wheat bread recipe. I tried using a different recipe and they new and ask for this one immediately. I made some adjustments in order to bake in my OSTER BREADMAKER. Comes out light and fluffy. Not dense. Just perfect for sandwiches. In a bowl combine: 
2 cups warm water
1 package yeast
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 cups white flour
Mix well and pour in breadmaker pan. Wait 30 min or until big and bubbly as noted above. Then add the following ingredients:
3 tbsp butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1.5 cup wheat
1/2 cup oatmeal 
1/3 cup sunflower seeds
Select "Rapid Bake" for 1.5 to 2 pound loaf. That's it! I have added a picture of it as well.

I used the dough to make rolls for a family gathering. I made one substitution by using all wheat flour (Prairie Gold All Natural White Whole Wheat). They were light and fluffy with a slightly sweet flavor. This will definitely be my new go to recipe when I forget to soak the night before;)

This was my second attempt to make bread.  The recipe was easy to follow.  For being a noob at bread making, the other reviews and video were invaluable.  I bet I watched it 5 or 6 times.  The recipe says 3hrs to ready.  I think it was closer to 5+ for me.  Some of that is because I'm a noob.  But, it also took a lot longer than I was expecting for the bread to rise in the pans.

This is an excellent recipe, It rose very nicely and it was light and fluffy.  I did substitute the honey for sugar and used All purpose Flour. I also added a cup of finely grounded chia seeds and flax seed meal.  As indicated in the recipe you will need to use more whole wheat flour when your kneading. This is my second time ever making bread and thought it was super easy and will be keeping this recipe.

I used this recipe for my first time baking bread (besides beer bread and banana bread, which don't require yeast or nearly as much time), and I'm really pleased with the results. It tastes great, and the instructions are easy to follow (even for beginners like me). I'm definitely planning to use this recipe again, and I think it's a cheaper and healthier alternative to a lot of store-bought options-- plus, who doesn't prefer fresh bread over the pre-packaged loaves they sell at the grocery store? This is a great recipe for tasty, versatile bread.

Perfect! I only bake with 100% whole wheat and it comes out perfect, every time, never fail! This is my go-to for kids lunches & the perfect toast! I have even substituted the yeast with my own sourdough starter & that worked out well too.

I have made this recipe twice, and it went over very well both times. I made this in the morning and my husband ate all the bread I packed for his lunch on his drive to work! I also formed part of the dough into rosette rolls and froze them after the first rise.
I used AP flour, since I don't have bread flour or vital wheat gluten on hand. I think the bread turns out a little airier and less elastic, but it works for us!

Yep, by far the best whole wheat I've baked.  I used buckwheat honey as it is what I had- it is a dark honey almost reminiscent of molasses.  Turned out very good.  Nice soft bread texture(not too dense or fluffy, moist, flavorful. Excellent - this will be a keeper for me.

This was my 1st attempt at bread and it was easy!  I used 2 pans as suggested by others and used my Kitchenaid mixer to knead the dough.  I was short on honey, so I used sugar also, but cut the total amount used by at least half to avoid having it too sweet.  I also didn't think all the butter was necessary, so I only added 2T instead of 3, and did not coat the finished loaf with butter and it's still not hard 3 days later.  The taste is similar to store loaf bread, but slightly heartier.

This recipe was perfect! I have been trying to make bread at home, without a bread machine, for a while with limited success. This is great. I will try all whole wheat next time. Thank you!

I make this bread regularly! Based on personal preferences, I use about half of the honey recommended and let it rise longer. That way it's fluffier and not too sweet!

Adjusted the recipe to make 1 loaf. Although I'm not a fan of whole wheat bread, this was pretty good and the kidlets liked it.

I like this recipe a lot but I have a problem recently. I added 2C oatmeal, 1C pecan, 1C dried cranberry, 1/3C wheat bran/flaxseed powder/hemp hearts mix into the dough before the first rise, and it had minimum rising only. Should I add more yeast? I probably was too greedy!

This bread is delicious. I made a mistake on gambling on yeast packets that were 2 months to expiration...so I didn't get the rise that I wanted.  I followed some suggestions and added 2 tbs of gluten and 1/2 cub of 7 grain hot cereal with flax from Bob's Red Mill.  The only problem is that it didn't rise enough.  I missed up on some of the waiting instructions too.  Even messing up on all of this I got a smaller loaf..soft...nice color...absolutely yummy.  I will do it again and try to not mess up.  Thanks everyone for the ideas. The video is nice too.

I have made this recipe a couple times and feel in love with it I use white flour in place of the wheat bc I am allergic to wheat I also replaced honey with Agave.  It is so delicious we had some tonight after it came out of the oven with dinner I love the ends of the bread.  Nothing better then homemade bread!

I really wanted this recipe to work. I tried it 2 times over the weekend. Both times it did not rise a lot in the second rise and every time I punched it down, it did not rise anymore in the oven. Followed the recipe and made no changes - I kneaded by hand. The taste was great and the family liked it but I was not satisfied with the denseness of it. I know it did not rise like I would have wanted it to.

My husband doesn't normally eat whole wheat bread.  This bread is the exception.  Occasionally, chooses this bread over his favorite white bread.

Ah-Ma-Zing!  I've never made bread before, but WOW this was so good.  I used the trick I found in one of the reviews to turn on the oven for 1 minute, then turn it off and put in the dough to rise.  It doubled in no time flat.  Next time I will try increasing the wheat and reducing the bread-flour like others have done, but only for the health benefits.  This was super-yummy!!

I literally just popped these out of the oven and they are really good! I was certainly surprised because this was my first try at whole wheat bread. I used half of each ingredient and tried even less of the white flour (used about 2 cups).I substituted the honey for brown sugar since I had none being that this was a quick whip up. My next batch of these will hopefully be next weekend and I'll be going for only whole wheat flour. I saw some great suggestions from other bakers which I will surely keep in mind.

I halved the recipe... It made 2 medium size loaves. The consistency is very good. U can easily slice and use as sandwich bread. I used White Whole Wheat flour and I used vegetable oil instead of butter. It's a keeper for sure!!

I had never made bread before finding this recipe, but I wanted to give it a try.  Simple is definitely correct.  I had no trouble making the bread.  It came out perfect and delicious.  My family loved it. It actually kind of reminds me of the bread they bring to the table at Longhorn, especially when you toast a piece and smear it with butter! So good! It's time consuming, but definitely worth it!

This is an incredible recipe.  I have just started baking my own bread, and wasn't always happy with the results.  with a couple of minor tweaks, this one is just about perfect.  I start with whole wheat or multigrain bread flour - 5 cups mixed in with the water, yeast and honey, with 4 to 5 tablespoons of essential gluten.  Then I use white bread flour in the second step.  The dough rises beautifully, handles like a dream and I always get 3 good sized loaves - sometimes a little extra for some freeform rolls.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I tried it a couple of years ago as a first time bread baker and have made it every week since.  I use it as our staple sandwich bread, but also throw in a handful of rosemary and garlic occasionally to serve in chunks with dinner.  I also switch between honey and brown sugar in this recipe depending on what I have on hand.  Would give this 10 stars if I could...

This is easy to make and the taste is out of this world! It takes a good amount of honey. If you have access to any local, fresh, non store bought honey, use that!

First time making it, second time ever making bread, it came out wonderfully. I did substitute sugar for honey, I have no complaints and plan on making double next time.

I tried this as the recipe states; also with multi-grain flour instead and the last time all I used was whole wheat flour. Each variation was better than the last. This recipe made me an expert baker I had never made bread before now I make it weekly. Easy and great recipe.

Very good.  I roll it into small baguettes and cook it until it is nice and crusty.

I've made this several times and it is perfect every time.  I used 2 cups all purpose flour and 3 cups white whole wheat flour for the first part, and 3.5 c of white whole wheat for the second part. I make 2 loaves and cut into 16 slices each.  Around 135 calories a slice for those who care.

I love this recipe.  I add about a 1 1/2 cups of a mixture of sunflower seeds, flax, slivered almonds, poppy seeds and a little extra butter.  Instead of loaf pans, I make three balls and place on cookie sheet to rise.  I also brush the tops with an egg and sprinkle with rolled oats before baking.  Always a great hit.

I've been using this recipe for a year.  We bake 3 loaves about every 10 days. We use a 1/2 & 1/2 mix of whole wheat flour that we buy pre-packaged and then full whole wheat that we grind ourselves. It's hard to mess up this recipe. What I love about it is minimal kneading. It seems that less is better. We now have people wanting to buy it each week and have sold it sporadically in the past. The time it takes to rise can vary a lot depending upon the temperature, so if it's going slowly, I'll put it on top of the stove next to something I'm cooking or out in the sunshine. I love that it doesn't use milk because we get our own milk fresh from the cow each morning and in the dry season there's not enough to go around...also like the honey rather than sugar.

This is the best bread recipe ever!  A few changes I have made, I use four cups bread flour and because of my sweet tooth, I use 1/2 cup honey instead of 1/3.  I also add 3 cups whole wheat flour instead of 3 1/2cups.  It comes out very moist and sweet and has become a family favorite.  Thank you very much for sharing.

the only thing I change when making this bread is I only use whole wheat flour. I love this bead so much that I don 't bother buying bread anymore! It makes 3 loafs and that lasts my family the whole month! Yummy!

This is a great recipe! The first time I made it I used a total of 3 cups of whole wheat flour and right away newt was too much. The 2nd time I made it added only 1/2 cup of whole wheat  flour  after the 2 cups, with a total of 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. It was perfect. I also added 3 T. Flax, and 3 T vital gluten powder. Wonderful results! Tis will be my "go to" bread !thanks for the great recipe!!

This is the second time I've made bread in my life, and I don't think it could have turned out better! It's delicious and super easy to make. I'll definitely be following some of the other reviewers tips like making one roll into cinnamon raisin bread and freezing some of the dough for later.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Since I only have two loaf pans, I made two loaves and divided the last section into twelve rolls. They are delicious!

Pretty Good.  Tastes just like the bread I buy from the store, but much healthier.  I did 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 wheat.  I made one loaf, froze one loaf, and made the rest into dinner rolls.

LOVE this recipe! I have made a commitment to bake all my bread to help reduce processed foods and this one is super easy and delicious! It is very forgiving and I have used all kinds of flours. If I do use all whole wheat, I add 1 TBSP of Vital Wheat Gluten ( a powder) to the dough for each cup of wheat. This adds more protein and helps the bread rise properly. I make 2 big loaves and my kids eat it up for sandwiches, morning toast, afternoon snack, whatever! We love this bread. BONUS: the house smells great when I bake it!

FANTASTIC! I've been baking and cooking since I was 8 years old. This recipe was easy and my family couldn't get enough. With a pot of 15 bean soup this was a hit. Instead of 3 loaves I made it into five 8 x 4 EZ foil pans. This makes a nice gift for family or friends and just perfect for a meal for 2. This one is a keeper.

I make this all the time. It is my go to recipe. I do leave out the second 1/3 cup of honey because I think it is too sweet. I definitly cook it for 30 minutes otherwise it is too gummy for my tastes. I also use a bocsh mixer so I don't take it out on a board to kneed it. I just add all the flour in the mixer until it doesn't stick any more. If you are not used to making bread keep reaplying olive oil to your hands when you are making each loaf, it is sticky. I don't brush the tops with butter because I like the crust better without. I think it makes it too soft. Great bread!

I am a bread maker, but I am not as thrilled with this recipe as others are.  It was a disappointment for sure.  I like to give recipes a second chance, so I will try it again.  However, something is just not right with this recipe.

Very good recipe. My youngest son has a dairy allergy, so I substituted canola oil for the butter in this recipe. I am very pleased with how they turned out and how easy they were to slice when they cooled. As they cooled on a rack, I wrapped them with plastic bags, leaving just a small opening to vent. This keeps most of the moisture in as they cool. Then I sliced two loaves for putting in the freezer, and kept one out for tomorrow.

This recipe is the best!!  I didn't change the recipe one bit and it was great!!!  Made this recipe for the first time today and sliced up the bread and put it on the table before dinner and one loaf was gone before we sat down to dinner.  Everyone LOVED this bread.  It is really great.  Thanks for this recipe!!!  I know I will be making this one at least once a week!!!  I experimented and rolled the dough out into a rectangle, ground up walnuts with cinnamon and sugar, buttered the flattened out dough and sprinkled nut mixture on it.  I rolled up the dough, sealed it and let rise and baked and, mmmm.... really nice  nut bread, too.   The original recipe is great by itself, but had to try my own spin on this about a one year ago...

This is an excellent recipe - but you can use one yeast packet and it will work just fine. I make a lot of bread for my family, so i tried one batch with the 2 packets of yeast and it was fine - but VERY yeasty tasting. Then i made another batch with only one packet of yeast. Those loaves actually had a better rise and tasted amazing.
So - this recipe is fantastic - but if you prefer a less yeasty tasting bread, use only one packet of yeast. 
:)
Thanks for posting this!

This bread was awesome, and I'm sure it would be even better prepared correctly. I was in a rush when making this bread and a misunderstanding caused it to miss the rising time and be cooked for only 12 minutes. I re-baked it later on for about 20 more minutes. The ending texture was kind of dense, which would be expected of un-risen bread, but still tasted great toasted. I'll try this again soon with white whole-wheat flour and the full rising time!
Also, why is 1/3 cup honey listed twice?

Awesome bread! So good that I had to join this site after using it for many years just so I could leave this review.  I didn't have any honey so I substitued sugar in the first step and 100 percent pure maple syrup in the second. Not too sweet! Perfect! Used the Kitchen Aid for the kneading. Worked great. I also used stone ground whole wheat and let it rise twice before shaping.  I got one large loaf and 20 rolls.  Rolls are also awesome!  Added a picture of the loaf with a braided top..so pretty! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've made this recipe for the past few years and it's an easy recipe to follow and the bread is fantastic!  I've reduced the honey in the second part of the recipe as I've found the full 1/3 cup of honey made the bread too sweet.  And I've also elimated the butter "topping" after the bread was baked, as I found it was perfect without the butter and why add additional calories if not needed.

I just made this recipe for the first time. It has immediately replaced all other bread recipes as my base to use. I've added a photo (not sure it came through) One loaf (on the right) is as given, the other (on the left) I rolled in pesto and asiago before baking and sprinkled parsley and Parmesan on top so I could easily tell the difference.

I have been making bread (or attempting to) for well over 10 years now. This is by far the best recipe I have ever used! I used all spelt flour and followed the rest to the letter and it turned out amazing. Between me and my 3 and 6 year old we devoured all three loaves in about 4 days! Just got done making it a second time and it turned out just as amazing.

This is the best recipe method I have found for making bread without any white flour. I make all of my bread with 100% whole wheat flour and have found that letting the flour set with the water and the yeast for 15-30 minutes (15 when I use instant yeast) prevents the loaf from becoming too dry and crumbly. I have also made this recipe exactly (accept for substituting whole wheat flour for the bread flour) and it was a great one; very light and moist!

I had major bread anxiety going into this (haven't tried to make bread for about 20 years, and never had any luck back then) but I'm so happy to say I have 3 not only edible but delicious loaves after the 1st try. I used 3 c white all-purpose flour and 2 c white whole wheat flour for the initial 5 cups, and white whole wheat for the remainder. No other changes - just watched the video to make sure I was on the right track! I can't wait to make another batch and try a cinnamon raisin loaf and maybe some dinner rolls.

Recipe worked perfectly the first try. I used all whole wheat flour from hard white wheat and the bread was heavy but still had a nice texture and great flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Wow...this came out PERFECT. The only thing I did different was to add a half-cup of vital wheat gluten along with the bread flour in the first step. Everything else, I did verbatim from the recipe. Soft, delicious, wonderful bread! Oh, and as some other reviewers pointed out, this recipe makes only TWO loaves of bread in standard loaf pans.

I made this for my first bread ever and it turned out wonderful!  It is a heavy bread but you can even eat it plain, it's that good!  I thought 3 loaves would be too many before it went bad but it was eaten up so fast that I didn't have to worry about it.  Very easy!

I am new to bread baking and very much enjoying not only the fruits of my labor but also the labor itself. You do not have to be an experienced baker or a chemist to make good bread.  All you have to do is follow a recipe and learn from whatever mistakes you make. I followed the recipe exactly with great results.

This bread is a good example of a bread that is simple to make and delicous to eat--a perfect loaf for a beginner like me. 

The bread is slightly sweet and a little yeasty with a good crumb. A bonus is the fact that this recipe makes not one or two but three loaves, so there is plenty to go around. I understand why it is so highly regarded.

Highly recomended!

Maybe it was my technique, but I didn't like how this bread turned out. Crumb was nice, but had an overly yeasty taste. :(

I used regular all-purpose white flour instead of bread flour (I didn't have any) and it was delicious! I borrowed my mother in law's Bosch mixer and let it knead on level 1 for about 8 minutes and ended up using about 3.5 cups whole wheat flour just as the recipe states. I let the dough rise in my oven with the light on and it took about an hour.  I used two glass 9 inch loaf pans instead of three pans (time to buy another!) and cooked them together at  350 degrees for about 28 minutes. I made sure to brush them with butter and let them cool before cutting. Oh my goodness they were so good and moist, of course they made two very large sandwich loaves.  Next time I will probably do three pans just so I can fit them in the freezer better if I want to freeze a loaf :)

This is a fantastic recipe!  I have made it several times this summer, and it has always turned out delicious.  It stays moist, and the crust remains soft.  I even made hamburger buns with it and they were just as delicious as the bread.

A few years ago when I decided to start baking my own bread, I tried this recipe first. It worked so well, I've never tried any others. This easy recipe makes a tasty bread that's sturdy enough for toast or sandwiches.

I do just a few things differently from the recipe: I proof the yeast in 1 cup of water before adding to the rest of the water and honey. I make sure the water is around 110 degrees. I replace one cup of the bread flour with whole wheat flour. I use about half the recommended salt. And I skip the step of brushing with oil while baking, since I like it to get a little crusty on the outside. If you don't like a crust, no worries, it gets soft again if you put it in an airtight bag. The kneading lasts about 15 minutes for me; I knead until the dough gets springy and round and difficult to fold, then I go a few more minutes. Keep adding whole wheat flour to the kneading surface so that it keeps getting worked in. I also line the bread pans with parchment paper.

This bread freezes well, and comes out of the freezer smelling like fresh-baked bread. You can also freeze the dough prior to the final rise. I just love having delicious bread that I've made myself -- it's SO much better than grocery store bread!

Very easy to make and tastes delicous. Turns out good every time. I substituting another cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose but it didn't taste as good as the original recipe and it was a bit crumbly that way.

Great recipe!!!! I make this all the time. I'm a bread dummy and this is so easy and tastes so good.
Edit: I make this recipe dairy free using Earths Balance and it comes out great. I also live in high altitude and find that I use about 3.5 cups whole wheat flour and cook for just about 32minutes. Comes out perfect every single time, even if I'm lazy and don't always shape the loaves well!
Edit again: just watched the video, and my bread comes out far prettier than the video. Anyone else?

I made this bread for 20 people, and used all whole wheat flour. I used my bread machine but still followed recipe. Mixed the first half in dough mode and let it sit for 30. Then started the kneading process again and added the rest of ingredients. dough seemed a little dry given all the whole wheat so I added warm water. After dough cycle finished, punched, rolled and put it in bread pan and let it sit in fridge overnight. Took out of fridge where it sat covered for 90 min to come to room temp on top of oven. Last 15 minutes sitting out I put it on top of stove while preheating oven. Bread came out perfectly and so easy. FINALLY I have found the perfect 100% whole wheat bread that I can make in my machine and so easy!! Homemade bread every week from now on!

This was my very first time making bread. I followed the recipe exactly and my bread turned out awesome!
I did put it on a wire rack to cool immediately out of the oven to prevent molding. I will definitely make this again!

Very yummy!  So satisfying to make a delicious bread for my family that has ingredients I can pronounce and recognize.  I used all whole wheat bread flour and it worked like a charm.  I am not an expert at bread making, but this recipe is very forgiving.  Thank you for posting.

Love this recipe. I add 1T of bran, wheat germ and Flax seed. I also add 1/4 c of sunflower seeds and pumkin seeds. I put the oven on to warm, then turn it off and let the dough rise.

Sweet and earthy...really nice wheat bread! I followed the recipe, needing less wheat flour than called for since the dough was so easy to manage. Next time, I'll change the ratio to have a bit more wheat than white. I ended up with two loaves and a bunch of rolls that I cooked 2/3 done and stuck in the freezer. Next time I make this, I'll not only just do two loaves so I have a sandwhich size bread, but I'll also dip the dough in rolled oats before cooking. I tried sprinkling them after brushing the butter on and they just flaked right off. Maybe someone has another solution?

You must try this recipe!  The bread is so full of flavor & light in texture (even using 100% whole wheat).  This is probably the best & easiest bread recipe I've ever tried.  And I've made a lot of bread.  

After a few times making the bread, I did make it   healthier by using all 100% whole wheat & 1 cup of old fashioned oats (in place of 1 C flour) & 3 tbsp of canola oil instead of butter. Yummy & healthy & the family loves it!  However, the recipe "amounts" & "directions are perfect!  I like a little bigger loaf, so I actually made only 2 loaves & they were perfect size for sandwiches.  Best tasting flour...Bob's Red Mills 100% Organic Stone Ground Whole Wheat (& no wheat gluten needed for this recipe...perfect rise, amazing texture, not too dense at all...beautiful looking loaves.

This recipe should take you right around 3 hours to complete.  I did all proofing/kneading/rising right in same big plastic bowl.  Very simple & easy.

Best recommendation I read to help bread rise...turn on oven light & oven for 1 minutes then turn off (leaving light on).  Works like a charm! 1 hr & your bread has easily doubled.  And to give your bread a little lighter texture, you can do a 2nd rise for 30 minutes.
 
Thanks for the great recipe & all the wonderful tips!

This bread is delicious!  It has a light, fluffy texture with just enough sweetness in the taste.  This is my favorite wheat bread recipe so far.  Will be making this again for sure!

This delicious bread was very easy to make. Usually if I make bread I make a Jewish bread that takes about six hours, but this took me less than three! I didn't let it rise as long as I was supposed to, so it didn't get as large as it should have, but it was still delicious! Also, when it said to use five cups of bread flour, I substituted it for 2 and 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups of white flour. I think it made it healthier and it still tasted great! The butter on top kept it from getting too dry and hard. It was so delicious and my family really liked it I think. The was (is) a great bread for Easter! It's wonderful because it is not very time-consuming and most of the time you just let it rise...you aren't doing anything with it. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a quick, easy, delicious bread! Thank you so much, allrecipes.com, for this recipe! I definitely plan on using it again in the future!!!(:

My kids cannot get enough of this bread! It's wonderfully tasteful and moist. It is not a very dense bread, so that makes it a bit more challenging for sandwiches. I added 4 tbsp of gluten to the recipe, and I punched down one portion of dough one extra time and then let it rise yet again, and that loaf came out a bit more dense.  This bread is fairly sweet but you could easliy cut back on the honey and increase the white/wheat flour ratio and it would still taste great.

This is the only bread I make its perfect. Most times I'm only able to get 3 cups of wheat flour in so its a very forgiving recipe. After they cool I slice them and put them in large ziplock bags into the freezer. Easily thawed in the microwave and if desired, toasted. Delicious!

I made this bread after my stand mixer and blender both died on the same weekend.  I was able to mix it by hand, even though I had to give up on the spoon and dive in with both hands (literally) for the final mixing step.  Baked one loaf immediately and froze the others.  The bread is light, soft, and makes the most amazing PB & Js I have ever had.  It takes a ton of time (approx. 4 hours or so), but this recipe is a keeper!

Truly outstanding, easy and, as a breadmaker, fantastic for sandwiches. The texture is fine yet has enough heft to be hearty without heavy, if that makes sense. Will make it again and again. Because of the quantity of dough, use only a larger mixer (6qt was just big enough) if you want to do the kneading by machine.

This was my first attempt at making homemade bread, and it turned out great, though I wasn't sure if I kneaded it enough (step two isn't very clear). Next time I think I'll use three smaller pans or two large ones, since the shape of the loaf wasn't as tall as I'd like.  Used half sugar/half honey and applesauce instead of butter.  Thought it might be too sweet, but it was fine.  GREAT for french toast!

Amazing. This recipe is wonderful, and it tastes like the kind of bread I pay 4 bucks (or more) a loaf for! I made this on Saturday, gave away two of the three loaves, and then when I had to visit a friend late Sunday afternoon, I brought her the 3/4 loaf I had, knowing I could easily whip up another batch. I subbed vegetable oil for the butter, and for the batch I made today, I used brown sugar instead of honey and Earth Balance to brush after they were done baking. 

I had two big slices as toast for breakfast Sunday, with homemade strawberry jam, and man! YUM! Soft, but firm, perfect!!! bread. 

This is an easy recipe (even easier if you have a kitchen aid mixer for kneading), and I'm excited to alter it the next time I make it, maybe a cinnamon raisin or nuts-and-seeds variation. (Since there are 3 loaves, you can do 3 different breads!) Thank you Nita for giving us your recipe, I will use it for years to come!

I can't seem to get my yeast to rise with just honey, so I mixed 1/2 honey and 1/2 sugar with the yeast and it was absolutely wonderful bread.  Not too heavy and not too light.  Held together well, although I did have to let it cool in the pan before taking out (I don't wait with other recipes, so that was kind of weird).  Also tried it using olive oil instead of butter and that worked out good, too.

Unbelievable!  This bread is really simple to make and the taste is superior to any store bought bread.  The texture is very good.  It is easy to slice and toast.  I have requests coming in from friends and family to make them loaves.

The loaves tasted great.  If you don't have "bread flour" just use all purpose.  I only gave it 4 stars because it does take a bit of practice to know how much extra flour it will need and how long to knead it.  I didn't have enough honey, so I added molasses to make up the difference.  I don't think the yeast cared.

AAA+++ Absoutely wonderful.  Light and fluffy - It's been a battle trying to get DH to give up his soft storebought bread, but this one will convince him.  New favorite.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I am not a very good baker, so bread was a bit intimidating.  However, I followed the recipe as is and the bread came out beautiful and delicious.  Very simple to make and the best part is my kids love it.

I just made this bread tonight and it is by far the best bread I have made! I've been making my own bread the past month instead of store bought bread and I have gone through 4 whole wheat recipes and none of them as very good but this made the perfect fluffy bread! My 3 year old is gonna love it!

I've been making the kids' sandwiches all week with this bread and they said it's great for PB & J but they'd rather a different bread for the meat/lettuce/mustard sandwiches. I think it's b/c this is a sweeter bread from the honey. It's a good toast w/ butter and jam bread, too :)

I am trying to go "waste free" at our house, which means saying no to packaged bread and the wasteful plastic wrapper. This is the best recipe I have tried for bread, so far.  It makes terrific sandwich bread for my kids' lunches. To make it close to true whole wheat, I use only 1/2-1C of white flour. Then, I use equal parts whole wheat and "white whole wheat" for the remaining flour. Also, a bit less salt, only 2.5 teaspoons. Also, if you don't want to use butter, vegetable oil works just as well. My bread pans are big, so I only get 2 loaves, but they are perfect! This recipe is terrific!

Yum...yum...yum....this bread is AMAZING.  This recipe makes three full size loaves and one loaf is usually gone within an hour after it comes out of the oven.  The house smells heavenly while it bakes and  makes sandwiches even tastier.

This is THE BEST bread recipe EVER! Thank you soooo much! I did make a couple alterations. I never had any bread flour so I used all purpose & whole wheat. I also added 1/4 cup milled flax seed and 1 cup of oats. It's a very straight forward recipe. I got two huge loafs and I used the rest for buns. AMAZING!! I suggest this for all of you out there who are looking for a super tasty, easy home-made bread recipe!!! MmmmmMM I will use this recipe ALWAYS!

I enjoyed making this bread. Was fluffier than most homemade wheat bread. It has a nice flavor. I added sunflower seeds to mine. Today I will add flax seed. This will be a bread recipe l will use alot.

This is my first attempt to make a bread by hand instead of using my bread machine and it was simply awesome! The recipe yielded 2 nice size loaves, one of which I gave to my mom. The best part was I got my 9 year old son involved in making this bread with me and he both enjoyed the process with excitement as well as delighted in the finish product and taste. Yummy! Thanks for making this my best first experience in making a bread from scratch.

This turned out WONDERFULLY!  I have a friend who shared rising bread in an electric blanket.  My bread turned out so light and tasty.  My whole family loved it.  I grind my own wheat, which cuts the cost.  I think I found my replacement to buying bread.

Absolutely phenomenal!  Second time I made this and turned out wonderful!  I really enjoy fresh baked bread so I froze two of the loaves after they rose the first time.  When I'm ready to bake the extra loaves I'll pull them out to defrost, let them rise and bake.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent! The only thing is, is that I didn't realize to put WHOLE WHEAT flour when neading, for some reason, it just completely slipped my mind and I continued using bread flour. Also, I put ALL of the honey and salt in the warm water and dissolved all of it together and did not wait 30 minutes. I mixed all the ingridients, then the flour last, kneaded the flour and let rise in a greased bowl. Then followed the recipe.....I'm not sure how much that changes the recipe, but done that way, it was excellent!!!!!! I made 18 servings (half) and baked for exactly 30 minutes. Nexzt time I will bae for 35 minutes. Perfection! Next time, I will make this exactly as the recipe says and re-rate. But I will also make it my way, the mistakes I made because it was still perfect bread.

Great bread recipe; everyone loved it! I mixed and kneaded with the dough hook in a stand mixer, and let rise in a warm oven (turned on for a minute then off) for an hour. I used all-purpose flour in place of bread flour because it was what I had, and subbed in vegetable oil for butter.  Next time I might add an extra 5 minutes to the bake time, but otherwise this was great! The dough is easy to work with and yields a tasty, incredibly moist bread.

This was my first loaf recipe (I've done rolls and shaped loaves, but only a few times) and I think i turned out well! Just a few comments for novices like me-- 

This does fill (generously) two 9x5 pans, rather than three.  It'll be large, though.  

If you're using salted butter, still don't be afraid to use the Tbs of salt.  I cut back on the added salt, so it wouldn't be too salty-- trust me, err on the side of too much salt rather than too little. 

Knead, knead, knead. Don't stop for about 12 minutes if you're doing it by hand- and that's if you're energetic. 

Overall, I had a great rise, and a beautiful color and flavor.  The texture could have been a bit better, because I didn't knead for long enough. Best of luck!

This is the first recipe I have used to make homeade bread by hand instead of using the bread machine.  It was easy to put together and turned out perfectly.   The texture was perfect - not too dense and not too light.  The flavor was really good - a nice yeast bread taste and not too sweet from the honey.  Definitely give it a try!

Yum!  This is such an easy and forgiving bread.  I cut the recipe in half, as hubby will only eat wheat under pressure and know I will eat the whole loaf myself.  As advised by MommyFromSeattle, used 3 tblsp gluten. Also used 2 cups all purpose and 2 cups white wheat; added 1/2 cup 8 grain cereal mix and some wheat germ.  Cooked for a total of 40 minutes and it could have used 5 more, but did not want to overcook.  Rose to great heights.  It truely looks store bought, but tastes and smells homemade.  Thanks for sharing.

Can't stop eating this bread! This is a very easy bread recipe. I used quick rise yeast but it still needed 20 mins for the first rise. Only have 2 pans so I cut it down to 24 servings and got two loaves that didn't rise up super high (probably too cool in my house with the a/c on). Instead of bread flour I used all whole wheat flour because I prefer the taste and am trying to use less white flour in my diet. Make sure to use a good quality honey..I used an imported Hungarian wildflower variety. I'm sure orange blossom honey would be really good too. Not too big on sweet bread so I reduced the amount. On the advice of another reviewer I mixed the whole thing in my Kitchen-Aide mixer with the dough hook. The final mix before going into the pans took about 5-10 mins. It would be fun to add oats or ground flax seed just to play with the texture. I think you could also do a rosemary parmesan cheese mix for a nice savory twist, or brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon for a sweet version. Definitely try this recipe..it was a 4 hour project for me but lots of fun because the results are delicious!

This is the best wheat bread I have made, and tried!  I have been making my families bread for quite some time now but have yet to find a wheat bread that I love...I have found it!  I did substitute brown sugar for honey because I was out and it still turned out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at making bread...ever!  I produced three beautiful loaves and my friends and family thought they were wonderful.  However, I am now on the hook for making more this Thanksgiving.  LOL  Excellent recipe btw.

I originally rated this recipe on 10/25/11.  Is it possible to give a recipe 6 stars?  I've been making this bread (with ingredients divided by 3) in my bread machine one to two times a week now since I discovered this recipe.  This week, someone asked me where I get my bread because she'd never seen a 3-year-old eat the crusts of a bread as happily as the rest of it.  That's how amazing this recipe is.

Tried this recipe today. Tasted great but was a little dense. I live in high altitude and this was my first time making bread so I am going to assume that was the problem. Check out FoodieBecomesHer.com to see a step-by-step of this recipe.

Very easy to follow recipe.  Didn't have honey and I use brown sugar as substitute.  I am a newbie in bread baking. I have a question if anyone can help. After the bread is done in the oven, do I have to immediately take it out from the pan or let it cool in the pan? Is the bread should be dense or light?  Appreciate your advises.  Thanks.

Super easy and forgiving, I could do other work around the houses forget about it and it was still okay.  I also mixed the three loaves up rowing out the doe and adding cinnamon and sugar to one, Cheese to the next, and lastly doing a buttery herbs for the last.  They we a huge hit to my family, even the picky ones, and our naughbors around us. :)

Ok I just made this and I never made bread before. All I can say is Thank You! This bread is soooooo yummy!!! And it's really pretty easy to make. When letting it rise, I turned the oven on when I was preparing the bread and then I turned it off and let it cool, then I put the bread in the warm turned off oven to rise. I did not change the recipe one bit!!! It was perfect as is. I think it has the perfect hint of honey. It's delish!

i love this recipe and make it all the time. i find that it still works if you don't have bread tins and just cook the entire loaf of dough in a baking dish. 

also, i add 1 beaten egg for a less crumbly bread and I usually add whatever seeds or oats I have lying around. I like adding some ground flax and chia seeds for extra flavour and goodness.

Wonderful bread!  The whole family loves it.  Because I prefer not to use much white flour, I switched up the white and wheat amounts.  Turned out perfect!

This bread recipe has become our staple bread for everyday.  I add a few things at the beginning - after adding 1 cup of whole wheat flower, I add 1/2 cup of white corn meal, 1/2 cup of flax seed, 2T gluten flour, 2T flax meal, and about 1/2 cup of rolled oats.  Then I add the remaining wheat flour until the consistency is right.  Great recipe (and good for you)!

Very good recipe.  This may seem silly, but my favorite part of making this bread was after you mix the honey, water, flour, and yeast and you let it rise until bubbly.  Then you add the butter and salt, and it falls right through the dough!  I have never made bread, but for some reason this part was neat to watch.  I made mini-loafs and reduce the time by 5 minutes and it ended up perfect.

I made this yesterday, and it was my first time making bread from scratch (without a bread machine). It was easy and turned out great! I cooked one loaf and froze the other two...I'm hoping the frozen ones come out well too. I'm planning to do this from now on rather than buying bread from the store - I love it!

The best recipe I have ever tried. 

I have been trying different whole wheat bread recipes on this website and most of them have difficulties rising. I asked couple of friends and one mentioned that it might be the organic flour I was using, since organic flour is more difficult to rise. 

Anyway, I tried this one and it is delicious and fluffy. I plan to increase the whole wheat flour portion gradually. Hopefully, the bread will still rise.

This bread was absolutely delicious! One of the best recipes I've tried so far. It's nice & wholesome without being too dense, as I find many whole wheat recipes to be. I reduced the recipe to make a single loaf (using 1 tsp. of yeast, and omitting the second amount of honey). My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again!

I had never made bread before I tried this recipe and I was really impressed. Because my kneading technique was lacking, the loaf wasn't perfect, but it was so much better than I had expected, especially considering it was made without a mixer! This is a really nice recipe to learn with and makes really lovely, soft and buttery bread. Great for new bakers.

very easy and tasty.  I followed the recipe but divided into 4 instead of 3.  It made a perfect size loaf or 4 hamburger size buns.

I'm on my 5th batch of this bread. With a little practice and tweaking, it makes 3 perfect sized loaves. We can't keep this bread around for more than 2 or 3 days before it's devoured!

Wonderful bread and easy to make.  Some reviewers said they made two loaves, which I tried.  However, next time I'll make three as the recipe says because the loaves were quite large.

I made 1 loaf with the 17 serving size version.  It made a perfect size loaf.  I proofed my yeist with the water and honey for 10 mins before adding flour.  My first rise was 45 mins and my second rise was 30 mins.  It cooked for 25 mins.  I used this for a cucumber sandwich recipe on this site.

This is a great recipe.  I made bread for the first time using this recipe and it was a hit with my family and friends.  The only draw back was the butter that is brushed on the top of the loaves at the end of the recipe ends up making the loaves soggy if you plan to store the bread.  But, if you eat the loaf right away, the butter tastes great.

This is an easy and delicious bread!  I wanted more healthy for my family, but not the overpowering taste that whole wheat can sometimes give.  I use my Kitchen Aid to mix it up and it makes wonderful buns as well.  Because it makes 3 loaves, I only have to make one batch each week.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe. My husband and kids completely gobbled it up. Very easy, freezes well, and serves well for sandwiches and more. Would recommend rising overnight.

Love love love this recipe.  I started the mix in my old Sunbeam stand mixer with the dough hooks.  After the big and puffy experience, I transferred to board and finished kneading in the flour.  I did add an egg in the beginning and 1/3 cup dark corn syrup because I didn't have enough honey.  It was DELICIOUS. The texture is perfect, 3 loaves very useful and the taste is great.  Will be baking this one all the time.

Prep Time is way more than the 20 minutes shown.

I don't consider myself a baker, I'm a much better chef.  But this bread come out perfect.  I followed everything except used less white flour and more wheat since one reviewer said her's was fine that way.

I have 4 mini loafs, one full-size loaf and some cinnamon cranberry roles baking in the oven.  It's a great easy no-fail recipe.

What a great recipe!  I made 2 loaves' worth, one which I refrigerated overnight to slow down the rising and the other which I turned into bread bowls for soup.  This was my first attempt making a loaf of bread and I was thrilled with the results!  Even with the overnight refrigerating it rose nicely and had a nice texture.  The bread bowls were also delicious and tender.  I will definitely be making this again, and I'm sure it will be even better if I bake it right away.  Thanks for showing me how simple baking your own bread can be, I'm thrilled!!

this was sooo good! even my 2 & 4 year olds loved it! the only thing i found was that when kneading the dough with the extra flour i used 2 cups, adding it slowly. i think i will cut it down to about 1 3/4 cups next time... a wonderful recipe i will definitely be making again!

This bread is wonderful and easy to make. I have already made it about 4 different times. It is a keeper and will be sold in my Baked Shop. I really didn't think Iwould like it, but its really good. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It is a 3 hr. process but its worth it.

LOVE THIS BREAD! I used to be a bread machine type of gal and now I love the art of making bread and getting my hands messy! Such a simple and easy bread to make! My 20 month old just helped me make a batch! And it is delicious! I always keep to loafs for my family and then give one away. I alway have someone asking if I've made any bread lately - everyone wants a loaf!

I've made this bread several times now. It is amazing. A couple things:
1) I ran into a time issue and couldn't bake the bread when I needed to. I stuck the lives in the fridge and let them finish their rise the next day. Still came out PERFECT! 
2) because it makes so many loaves and we werent likely to be able to eat it soon enough I added vital wheat gluten. The bread was really soft am lovely (softer than usual homemade bread) and it stayed fresh and soft for a week!  It made FABULOUS French toast, sandwiches (even for little kids), an regular toast.
Today my ten year old son made the recipe with only a little oversight by me. It's a really easy recipe and well worth making.

Very, VERY good, lovely flavor to it. I tweaked it a bit, but it was still delicious none-the-less, I also combined it all into one big loaf (which ,in turn, led the cooking time to be 77 minutes) But thats my fault. All in all great recipe, 5 stars.

Very simple to make. I added extra sugar (+1/3 cup) as my hubbie likes his bread sweet. I made it in 2 loaves.  I left it in 26 minutes and it was still slightly gummy inside. However, the flavor was great. I will definitely try making this again.

Until recently, I was afraid to make yeast breads. I've made pleanty sweet breads, but other then a few loaves made in a bread machine, I had never made real bread.   This recipe was easy to follow and tastes great! I am looking forward to adding in different grains and creating the perfect bread for our family. Thanks to Nita for posting this recipe!

I read alot  of the reviews here and decided I have to try this recipe! My house smells wonderful and I just tasted my first bite of this fantastic bread! Light, fluffy and healthy. I'll be making this bread often, as my husband and son are raving about it right now!  I make two loaves and followed the recipe but added 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I can't say enough about how much I love this recipe!

This recipe is perfect. The bread makes excellent, hearty breakfast toast and sandwiches. I followed one reviewer's advice and only made two loaves (okay, so I only have two loaf pans, which certainly contributed to that decision), and they came out great. The tops were big and rounded, so the slices were generous. My family has worked through the two loaves pretty quickly, and tomorrow I need to make another for my child's lunches for the week. This recipe is kid-tested and pronounced "good." Also, this tip bears repeating... a closed oven with the light on is a great place to let dough rise.

Yes this is a superior recipe.  I took a couple loaves to work with some butter and they disappeared fast!!  I kneaded my dough with my kitchenaid mixer and added a 1/4 cup more honey.

OMG this was fantastic. We ate all three loaves in record time.  Kept very nicely in a ziplock bag and my grandson loved any kind of lunch meat that we put on it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it had a wonderful soft texture.  I will make this over and over!

This is my all time favorite bread recipe...I make it using only whole wheat flour and it is delicious. Instead of using loaf pans, I shape it into balls, cut a criss cross across the top and bake it. It comes out crunchy on the outside and sweet and oh so soft on the inside. Oh and the leftovers make incredible croutons for soups or stews!

I was a little impatient on the rising time, so it ended up pretty dense, but the flavor was delicious! I used 1/3 c. honey and 1/3 c. sugar and it was still good!
 
Extended- made it a 2nd time and was delicious, but dry!  I just can't win with this one!

Awesome! Just took the first loaf out of the oven and can't wait to try it. I know this will taste as good as my place smells right now. I am a first-time bread baker and had no problems at all. The recipe was easy to follow and it rose and baked beautifully. I only had 2 cups of bread flower so for the remainder I used a 50:50 mix of rye flour and all-purpose white flour. I also threw in some Red River cereal for some added fibre and texture. MMMMM!

Really tasty & easy. This was the first bread I've ever made - I wanted to use my new kitchenaid mixer - turned out beautifully. I added a little too much honey, but it was really delicious! I may continue to add too much in the future!

I have made this bread every week for over a year and no longer buy bread. It is wonderful. Typically I throw in a cup or so of 10-grain and subtract some bread flour. This recipe is fantastic!

Who needs expensive and additive-filled supermarket bread when you can make this wonderful recipe? It's light, easy to make, and so tasty. I mixed flaxseed into it for a bit of texture. Thank you for posting!

Excellent recipe! I halved the recipe and only used 1/3c honey (I think it would have been too sweet with the second addition of honey). Also, instead of bread flour I used all-purpose and added 1 T of vital wheat gluten for each cup of AP flour. I baked 2 loaves as is and the third I made into a cinnamon raisin bread and all came out wonderfully. It's a great basic recipe that I will look forward to playing around with by adding different grain flours/seeds/dried fruits and nuts.

This may be one of the few breads that tastes better the next day.  I used four small loaf pans rather than larger ones, because that is what I had.  The bread was perfect when it reached the 180 degree mark; a helpful trick.  It is great for sandwiches, as mentioned and make excellent toast.  I used two loaves for cinnamon raisin bread, which was awesome and popular at my house.  Unfortunately, this bread makes store-purchased bread taste well, not as good.

Great, fluffy wheat bread similar to white bread in texture. This is sweeter (I would call it "honey wheat"), so if you don't want a sweeter bread, I wouldn't recommend it.  I halved the recipe and made one loaf. I used all wheat bread (wheat pastry bread), so I added gluten (4 tsp), since white flour contains gluten which helps bread rise, and yeast does not usually contain gluten on its own. I also used a bread machine for some of the work. The first "mixing" I did in the bread machine bowl by hand, after it rose for the half hour, I turned my bread maker on to "dough" to let it kneed and rise. I then took it out, put it in a greased pan, let it rise again, and baked it. Made an easy recipe even easier (and less messy).  Next time, I will try using half stone ground wheat (more texture) and maybe adding some seeds or oats for even more texture.

For the "2nd" 1/3 C Honey, I used dark molasses.  I tried to dissolve the salt into the butter too before adding and then brushed the top of the loaves before they went in the oven with egg whites to get a bit more crust.  My entire family loved this bread - it's amazing for sandwiches and doesn't collapse when you cut into it.  For added flavor, "grease" your pans with unsalted butter.  Let the bread cool all the way and then take them out.  The bottom and sides will feel damp, but the butter preserves the loaf.  Toast up a slice and there's a "brown butter" flavor effect that's incredibly rich without adding any toppings.  Winner winner winner!!!!

This bread was so simple to make, absolute the best ever!! This made 3 decent sized loaves. I left one plan and froze it. The other two I made one into a cinnamon rasin swirl loaf, the other I added whole grains and sunflower seeds to the loaf and it was SOOO good!! This is a keeper!

This was my first attempt ever at making bread. Other than maybe rushing the rise in the loaf pans a bit, which left the bread dense, this was excellent. My wife was very impressed at the bread. This will definitely be in my recipe book for years to come!

This bread is delicious!  Very yeasty tasting.  My husband loved it!  I think I under baked mine by about 3 or 4 minutes - the very center was kind of soft... so I just toasted the slices before using them and it was perfect.  Great for sandwiches or just eating with butter!

A bit sweet, yummy and slices well. I've been using it as a base to experiment from. Replacing the ww flour w/ other flours or grains I sprout then grind.

Really good wheat bread. I made half the dough exactly the way the recipe said, and the other half I mixed in oats and sunflower seeds. The kids love both, and I was able to use two longer loaf pans easily. This will be our weekly wheat bread recipe for sure.

OH MY!!  I have never baked bread before so this was a total experiment, but it came out perfect!  I had to use imitation honey (because I accidently bought it..) but you couldn't even tell the difference.  I can see a lot of bread baking in my future.

My whole family loved this bread.  Even my wife, who is not a whole wheat bread fan.  My boys eat it plain.  I would also recommend using the kitchenaid mixer for kneading the dough in the beginning.  It made the process easier and turned out excellent.  Thanks for a recipe I will use weekly to supply my family with healthy and tasty bread!

I've made this recipe three times now and my family absolutely loves it.  I've 'almost' completely stopped buying bread from the store because this is so easy, contains only natural preservatives (honey), and freezes easily.

This is our staple wheat bread recipe.  My family loves it!  I haven't bought bread from the store in about a year now.  I make bread once or twice a week and this is the bread recipe I use most of the time.  People are always glad to receive it as a gift, too!  I use white wheat that I grind myself.  King Arthur also has a white wheat flour that works great.

Great,Great Great- I have been cooking for almost 50 years and I love making home made bread and I think this is by far the best yet. It is so hard to find a really good bread recipe but to find one that is whole wheat- wow!!!! I use King Arthur white whole wheat, I buy it at Publix and it is a really soft flour. Love it. Thanks

I LOVE this recipe. I have now made it 3 times and it consistently comes out fabulous. I love that it makes 3 loaves. I follow the directions to a tee. It is delicious just how it is. Great texture and flavor. I have also added ground flaxseed to the dough with no problems. This is my go to recipe for bread. THANKS FOR SHARING IT!!!!!

This was my first attempt at making homemade whole wheat bread and I was so tickled at the results!  I only had 1 packet of yeast so I made half the recipe.  As suggested by another review, I sub'd sugar for honey (not enough of that either!), and 2 c bread flour, 2 c whole wheat flour, 1 tsp salt, and 3 TBSP wheat gluten.  I was not sure when to add the wheat gluten.  I ended up adding it w/the whole wheat flour (step 2).  Baked in a glass loaf pan at 350 for 25 mins, allowed it to cool slightly in the pan and then managed to get it out and cooled completely on a cooling rack.  My husband and I were both floored by the slightly sweet, chewy bread.  This is a winner!  I cannot wait to make a full batch so we can have 2 loaves!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

This bread tastes great!  I didn't let mine rise long enough.  I got impatient so mine weren't as tall and pretty as they should have been, but next time I will let them finish rising!  I froze two of the loaves for later use.  Thanks!

I've been making bread (by hand) for years and have tried many whole wheat recipes.  This is by far the best!  Most recipes add the whole wheat flour first and finish by adding the white flour.  Adding the white flour first in this recipe gives a wonderful texture and so easy to knead.  Alot of ww recipes dry out after a very short amount of time but this is a very moist, delicious bread!

My first ever homemade bread, and it turned out sooooo delicious, moist on the inside, chewy crust, slightly sweet and slightly salty.  Perfect.  Kids gobbled it up immediately.  Used my KitchenAid mixer, kneading hook, but I ended up kneading  more by hand because the recipe said so ;-)  Baked mini loaves, took them out after 20 minutes from my convection oven and some of the biggest ones were still a little raw looking: tasted cooked, but looked darker in a little spot in the very centre/bottom.  Made the dough rise in the buttered pans I would eventually bake them in, and sprinkled a little flour before tossing them back in after kneading.  Substituted all purpose enriched flour for the bread flour, but the loaves still turned out really wonderful and soft and chewy.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe.

I was so intimidated to make bread from scratch when my bread machine broke but this was quite easy. And most importantly, DELICIOUS! I'm going back to homemade bread from now on. Can't wait to play with this recipe some more by trying the cinn. raisin as a reviewer suggested and adding some flax etc. Made as the recipe suggested with the addition of vital gluten. Thanks so much for making me a bread maker again :)

In the middle of eating his first slice of this easy, delicious bread my husband paused and said, "This bread is awesome."  Score!  I also made mini loaves and cooked them for about 15 minutes each.  Very fun and very yummy.

Flavorful, light, slicing bread that is my primary bread for daily use.  Makes great sandwichs and is also good toasted.  Freezes well and will stay fresh for several days.

This is by far the best bread recipe I've ever made.  I didn't change a thing except to use potato water in it.  My family absolutely loves it. Great job Nina!!!  Wish I could give it 10 stars. :)

Delish!  Made exacely as recipe stated in my KitchenAid. I made two loaves of bread and 1 doz rolls, didn't have bread flour but used all-purpose flour.  Came out perfect.  My family loved it.  Will make it again and again.  Now my weekly ritual.  Great recipe Nita.

I have made this recipe two times now and they have both turned out GREAT! My daughter took one to back to college with her and her friends sent a text saying the bread was great. Mine do not quite look like the loafs in the picture but the taste is exceptional. This is only the 4th ot 5th time I have ever baked bread too.

This is by far the best bread I have ever made!  I had used Martha Stewart's recipe, but it always came out too dense and a little dry (no matter what I did with it).  This bread was easy to make and delicious.  By far the best bread I have tasted! Also, it can easily be modified with a little oats, sunflower seeds, and flax (if you want a variation in texture).

I made this earlier this week.  We have eaten 2 of the 3 loaves.  It is delicious!  I am not a bread maker, in fact, every bread or roll recipe I've tried, I have failed at.  So, I was nervous going into this.  But, I followed the instructions exactly, and the bread turned out perfect.  I want to try increasing the whole wheat flour next time, and maybe adding the flax seed, but my husband is content with it just like it is.  Delicious in the morning toasted with butter and jelly.  Thank you for  this recipe!!!

Good!  I halved the recipe and used one loaf pan.  Also used my bread machine to make the dough and finished in the oven.  I just add liquid, yeast, and honey to proof, and then added butter and lastly dry.  Came out great!  Next time might try 1/2 milk and 1/2 water.  Thanks!

I made this bread on Sunday and again today. On Sunday, I baked into 1 large 9X5 loaf in the Pampered Chef loaf pan, 2 cinnamon breads and 2 small loaves in the PC mini-loaf pans. Today I made 2 9X5 loaves and a slightly smaller cinnamon bread loaf.  We love this bread...as is...no changes necessary.  It did, however, take a little longer than the stated time to fully bake. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

I couldn't believe this recipe made 3 LARGE loaves like it did.  I too use the Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pans and they were filled out beautifully!  I used 4 cups combination of spelt flour, large flake oats, wheat germ, whole wheat, cracked wheat and oat bran.  The rest was white bread flour.  Wonderful!

Fool-proof and AWESOME! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and just added a touch of my own blend of grains and nuts for a little extra health :)  With this amount I made one full loaf, one braided loaf, and 12 dinner rolls (which I took out of the oven about 5 minutes sooner). SO DELICIOUS!

Best whole wheat bread I've made so far, and I've made a lot.  I followed the recipe closely, I only added 3 tbl of vital wheat gluten.  I did think it was a bit sweet, so next time I'm planning on cutting back on the honey.

Thank you, thank you!  My search for whole wheat bread recipe finally ended.  I used just a half of honey and it was just right.  The bread was so moist and light!  I ground up winter red berries and added a little bread flour.  I will experiment adding flax seeds and rolled oats like other reviewer mentioned.

Very tasty bread. Also this is a very forgiving recipe. Have stopped looking for a WW bread recipe as this is a keeper.

I absolutely love this this bread. I have made it countless times. The first time I made it it was too dense, basically because I did not let it rise enough. But once I got that it was easy peasy to make and I started adding, oats, using sugar instead of honey. I go back and forth. Putting in flax seed. This is versatile and a wonderful bread. If you don't get it the first time, try try try again.

Very good bread. I was approached to trade a loaf of home made bread for a dozen home grown fresh eggs. Such a deal! I ask what their taste was and all they wanted was whole wheat sandwich bread for left over turkey! I made this recipe and they loved it and said to be sure to let them know when I needed more eggs! This was a very easy bread to do and the size (3 loaves) fit my baking stone perfectly. This will go into my rotation for sure!

This is the most tastiest bread I have made.  Everyone loved it! the only change I made was to put whole wheat flour in the first part of the recipe instead of the white as another reviewer suggested.  Great recipe!

My husband and I really love the taste and texture of this super easy bread! Like other users, I use this recipe to make 2 loaves instead of 3 so that it's "sandwich-sized."  I bake it at the same temperature and time as in the recipe.  Since we only eat a loaf per week, I freeze half of the dough (wrapped in plastic wrap and then a ziploc bag) before the final rising time.  The next week I just set it in the bread pan, let it rise, and then bake it.  Yum!

I have now made this recipe half a dozen times, and every time it gets better (probably because my technique is improving!). I haven't had to add a thing to the recipe to make it come out great. I would recommend using a wheat flour made of  finely ground winter wheat, like Bob's Red Mill, if you can get it. The texture is much more chewy than if you use a coarsely ground flour. And don't bother freezing this bread, because your family is going to eat it so fast it won't have time to stale! It does freeze well, though.

This produced 4 medium (perfect size for us) loaves of bread.  Nice texture and good flavor.  I started off following this recipe to a tee but decided to use only one half cup of honey - I don't like a sweet loaf of bread.  I found there was too much flour for the quantity of liquid. I had a very stiff dough to work with and still had another cup of WW flour to go - which I had to leave out. In my experience, it's better to incorporate all the whole wheat flour first: it's easier to incorporate white flour at the end than WW. However, next time I'll start of with at least one half cup more liquid. I didn't put the butter on the outside of the loaves either.  We love the crisp crust of a freshly baked loaf and after storage, the crust softens anyway.

Excellent Fail proof recipe!!!! I failed 4 times at making bread and this was my 5th attempt. I decided to use this recipe because of all the good reviews it received on the recipe "as is", not with a million modifications that people make and then rate it 5 stars.

My family ususally doesn't like anything but white bread.  This has changed their minds!  I used hard white winter wheat whole wheat flour, and I always add about 1/3 cup of instant potato flakes to my bread recipes, it keeps the bread from drying out.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I had never made homemade bread before trying this recipe, and i've now been making it for several months, and we still love it!  Easy to make, freezes well after baking, taste great everytime.  I make this recipe as it is, and only divide it into two loafs.  Bake for closer to 30minutes, and you get a little bigger loaf.

I made this bread yesterday and we are 2/3 way through it already. I made 2 loaves and one pan of dinner rolls. They were delicious. Also, the loaves came out of the pan so easily. I usually bake on a baking stone because I hate scraping the bread out of the pans, but this was so easy. I had been looking for a great whole wheat recipe...I've found it!

This is a great recipe! I cut the recipe to 24 servings (2 loaves) and added 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds. Very flavorful base recipe. I plan on more experimentation using this basic recipe as a starting point.

I'm a novice bread baker and this recipe was simple and yielded delicious results! There's nothing as good as home made bread. Chewy, moist, flavorful. I liked this better than the "Amish White Bread" recipe that I tried a couple of months ago.

UGH, I am such a dunce with bread making.  I think I made my warm water TOO warm and killed the yeast because my bread would not rise.  The taste is amazing though, and I'm sure if I was a better bread maker, this would have been a beautiful fluffy loaf and a favorite bread recipe! ;)

Easy to make and 3 loaves were gone in less than 24 hours!  I had to make a second batch!  The only thing I did different was to use all whole wheat bread flour, no reagular flour.  Fantastic!

Very good whole wheat bread. I used all wheat flour - Prairie Gold flour makes a light loaf, not dense or strong tasting. I personally like bread recipes with milk instead of water, I think you get a more tender crumb and a better rise. But this does make delicious bread!

I really love this recipe.  It performed exactly as stated in the recipe and since it made three loaves, I was able to make enough bread at one time to last for three weeks.  We love it for breakfast.  Just slice very thin, butter both sides and fry in a sauce pan for a crispy addition to breakfast.

This recipe made the tastiest wheat bread I've ever baked!  The texture was perfect; crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  The flavor had a nice balance, not too grainy or sweet (though I did use less honey than the original recipe called for).  I used sesame oil to grease the bread pans before baking, and that added a subtle sesame flavor to the crust.

Made this for the first time last night and it was GREAT. I only got 2 large loaves instead of 3. I made the recipe exactly as written. After I kneaded the bread for about 15 minutes I let it rise in my oven for about an hour and it was ready to be punched down and made into loaves. I then put them in the microwave to rise the second time so it would be warm enough and I would still be able to preheat the oven. In another hr they were ready to bake. I baked them for 35 minutes with a bowl of warm water on the bottom shelf of the oven and they came out perfect. My hubby and 13 yr old son almost devoured a whole loaf and my hubby normally hates wheat bread.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe for whole wheat bread, and works well just as written or with many different modifications as other reviewers have mentioned.  The way I usually make it is to use only 2 cups bread flour, the rest whole wheat flour.  I add some vital wheat gluten because I have so much whole wheat flour.  I replace half of the honey with molasses.  I also add a couple tablespoons of flaxseed meal and a spoonful of flaxseeds.  After the second rise and right before baking I brush the loaves with a beaten egg and sprinkle sesame seeds, poppy seeds, coarse sea salt, flax seeds, or whatever else I feel like decorating with.  Thanks to the poster for this fantastic recipe!  My family and I love it!

I love this recipe - I make it weekly for my family. To make it healthier, I only use 1 C. white flour; adding a T of gluten helps the texture tremendously.

Great recipe!  I let a very moist dough sit out overnight to sour slightly before adding more flour and baking it.  Very nice flavor.  I think I'll put a little more salt in the dough next.

Great recipe!  I reversed the white and whole wheat flour so that it had a higher percentage of whole wheat, and it still turned out light and wonderful.  It's a little sweet for me, so I might reduce the honey next time.  But overall a great bread!

i've been making this recipe twice a month (2 loaves each time) for about 1.5 years now. tweaked it here and there. here are a few changes that i've made that have made the bread better (i think). i substitute the butter that goes into the dough for equal amounts of walnut oil. i still brush butter across the top when it comes out of the oven. also, i add 1/8th cup of flax seed meal to each loaf. i like the nuttiness of the oil and the meal instead of the buttery flavor.

I'm a novice bread maker so I didn't realize that while it IS easy, bread making DOES take time.  If making this in a Kitchen Aid mixer, you may want to reduce by 1/3 to make 2 loaves...when the inital dough rose, it was so high it oozed into the mixing tool attachment connection.  Also, I found it helpful to cover with a WET towel...the dough didn't stick to the towel.  Just some ideas from someone new to bread making.

Great recipe!  When I was a little kid I made bread with my mom occasionally, but that was very rare, and this was my first time making bread on my own.  Next time I think I'll want to let it rise for a little longer, as the loafs aren't quite as tall as I hoped.. but then again I opened the oven to look inside a few times, which certainly didn't help with that.   I only had two bread pans, so I rolled the third ball of dough out flat, cut it up into rectangles, and rolled them together with cheese and veggie sausage, then put a little garlic on the top and baked them on a cookie sheet.   I'll do this again!

One of the best honey wheat breads I have tasted--and I've been baking breads for a few years now!  I used in total 4 cups of wheat flour and the original amount of bread flour. As others have mentioned that three loaves makes for smaller breads, I made two loaves out of this. They were HUGE in my loaf pans. So I might make a few rolls out of it or something  (I do like big loaves, but I was afraid of it spilling over). They baked for about 35 minutes. Such GREAT flavor, soft and delicious. I think this will be my every day bread for now!

So far this is my favorite bread recipe.  I've only been baking homemade bread for about a month now and I'm finding my confidence. I was using a bread machine for the longest time but with a large family I was tired of using the machine all the time for just one lousey loaf of bread. Just a couple little tweeks that I got from other reviews like the qty of honey a little intense so I only used half and substituted applesauce for the butter in this last batch and did half wheat half white bread flour. All in all a very good recipe.

Very good, very easy. It's not an crusty type bread, more of an every day sandwich and toast sort of bread.. It's really soft and good tasting. I will use this every week to make bread instead of buying bread. Thanks for sharing.

Rises well, great flavor and texture. Three large loaves of w.w. bread would cost $10-12 at the market. These three great fresh preservative-free loaves cost about about $3 total. In these economic times we might all learn to be more thrifty by making our own tasty bread. This recipe is the perfect place to begin. Easy and yummy. My family loved it. Thanks Nita.

First time making homemade bread: Very good bread. I added gluten and it worked out wonderfully.  suggestions/confusions: For the second 1/3c honey, butter and salt, I mixed those well together before adding it into the premature dough mixture. It seemed like it was just watery dough... and that adding 2 more cups of whole wheat flour would be too much but it turned out fine.  I didn't think it'd turn out ok because it was lump and fell apart easily but kneading it really made it come together. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you! However, I'd add more whole wheat flour and less white flour for more whole wheat taste.

Don't forget the salt! But in case you do...  Wow- this bread is basically foolproof! I forgot the salt when I mixed the ingredients and then remembered after it was rising in the fridge. (I make the bread at night and let the 1st rise happen in the fridge. Then finish it in the morning.) So I went ahead and added the salt when I took the bread out in the morning, then kneaded it for a few minutes to incorporate the salt before putting into bread pans. It worked! Perfectly. I also divided up dough into thirds and did 2 loaves of bread and 1 big pan of cinnamon rolls. Yum! I used smaller bread pans (8x4) and the bread was still awesome. It just puffs up a bit more and puffs over the sides slightly, but was perfect! I think next time I will try what others suggested and change the proportions of wheat flour to white flour so that there's more wheat than white. I'll definitely be using this recipe for my day-to-day bread.(Btw- Don't be scared to bake bread! I'm new at it, too, and this recipe is hard to screw up! Well worth it and far better for you than the preservative-laden stuff at the store!!)

This is an amazing wheat bread recipe. I made it with all whole wheat flour. I thought it may have made it too dense, but it came out beautifully! I was surprised how much this actually made. I was able to make 3 loaves easily. I am attempting to cut grocery cost by baking/making alot of my own things at home. This is the bread I plan on using for my daily thing (kid sandwiches, toast, etc) Thank you so much!

To "Barb" who said her bread didn't rise enough in the pans...I believe it is suggested that instead of three loaves, make two, for sandwich sized bread.  I have done that and it works well.

Im new to bread making and this recipe was awesome, and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and my family loved this bread. I only wanted to make one loaf though so I did have to scale down the recipe to 12 servings instead of the 36. I used 1 tsp of instant yeast to make one loaf in case anyone is trying to figure that out. Will definitely be making this again!

Outstanding! Incredible bread. I chopped some walnuts and kneaded them in as I formed the loaves. Adds another dimension of texture and flavor. Definitely a keeper! Also makes delicious dinner rolls.

Perfect!  I let this rise three times.  I did not find 2/3 of a cup of honey to be too strong.  I also use half honey, half brown sugar.  The brown sugar helps give the bread a browner color.  I really think the honey helps soften the wheat flour's strong taste.  This is a great recipe because it uses both bread flour and whole wheat.  The bread flour keeps the dough from becoming too stiff and dense.  I will make this again!

I am an experienced bread maker. I make a lot of bread by hand and this is one of the best ones I have tried. The taste and texture are lovely -a hint of sweetness without being too sweet and light in texture. I was wary to begin with that it made so much but I have no regrets and I am glad I did, I will be making this bread again.

This is the easiest, best whole wheat bread recipe I've ever tried.  The texture is perfect, and it tastes great.  It slices beautifully.  I've recently stopped buying whole wheat bread from the supermarket because most brands contain high fructose corn syrup.  With this recipe, I now have an easy, healthy replacement.  THANK YOU so much for this great recipe!

OMG! Great recipe! Loved it! I've made it 4 times this week already! This last time I didn't have any honey left, so I used white sugar, and I subbed canola oil for the butter in first step.  It still came out delicious! Oh yea, i also added walnuts, for a little crunch! Sooo good!!!

I've made this twice; once when my parents were here and once after.  Very easy and good.  You can vary the ingredients for it to work well, and I like that it has the whole wheat.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I tried it for the first time today and it was surprisingly easy! And quick too.  It created a beautiful aroma throughout the house, and my husband could not wait until the bread was cooled to have some!

I ran out of honey, so I used a bit of golden syrup, and that gave an excellent flavour. I also used my bread/cake mixer (on speed 1) throughout, for exactly 10 minutes.

My only suggestion would be that the two tablespoons of butter on top, once finished is a bit too much.  One tablespoon is perfect!

I will definitely be using this recipe again.  THANKS!

This is a pretty easy bread to make, but was a little too sweet, to my taste, for a sandwich bread.

I've been making my own bread for years, using the Betty Crocker recipe for honey whole wheat bread.  I made the three loaves that this recipe yielded and I didn't even get a chance to freeze them before they were gobbled up.  Great recipe!

My first homemade bread. This was a good recipe to start with, but the bread itself didn't have that 'oomph' to it that I was expecting.  I found the bread to be lacking in flavor, but once buttered up, or laced with PB&J, it was nice.  My end goal is to make a 7-grain type of bread, so I will probably use this recipe as a base, and just fold in some seeds to add some depth to the bread.  Great starter though!

Fairly good.  The flavor wasn't great but I didn't add enough salt -- my own fault.  The texture and mixing method are a little weird and I wish it had more wheat flavor to it.  Overall pretty good though.

I never made bread from 'scratch' before.  I loved it. So easy to make.  My kids love it.   I did substitute the butter for unsweetened applesauce and cut back on the honey.  

I read the other reviews and the next time I make this bread I am going to put in less bread flour and more wheat flour.

Kudos to the recipe creator....it will be my bread recipe forever.

Thanks

I have never successfully made yeast bread from scratch before until I tried this recipe!  It came out perfect the first time and I made it again the next day so I could share it with my etended family.  The only change I made was to make it into 2 loaves instead of three and I was very happy with the slice size for toast, pbj's etc.  I think I'll use it for french toast soon!  I'm sure it will be awesome!  Another great recipe!!!

Delicious! I ran out of honey, so left the second 1/3 cup out. I also made two larger loaves rather than three. Will definitely make this one again; perfect sandwich bread, also good warm with butter and jam :)

Though I did eliminate the second 1/3 cup of honey, I followed the rest of this recipe just as written. We love the texture and flavor! It has become our "staple" bread, since I bake all of our breads and rolls at home.

Thanks for a terrific recipe!

So easy.  I didn't change anything about the recipe except that I didn't have enough honey - I was 1/3 cup short.  It still came out great.  I only had two loave pans and I used a circular cake pan to make dinner rolls, they came out so good.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will definitely make this again.

FANTABULOUS!!  That's what my 9 year old said about this bread.  What a great, easy recipe.  My whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of baking it in 2 regular size bread pans and 2 mini bread pans (I didn't have a 3rd regular one).  This ended up being a hit as my kids loved the mini size sandwiches it made.  My 2 year old was especially tickled to have kid size bread.  Thanks so much for the recipe...I will definitely be making this again and again!

Thank you so much for a simple and terrific recipe!!  I have never made my own bread before, but have been wanting to for a while now.  When I stumbled on this recipe, I knew I had to try it.  I was so sure my bread was going to be awful because in step 1 my bread sat for about an hour and a half because I got stuck at the store.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  My 5-year-old daughter gobbled it up and she will only eat regular white bread.  My husband even bragged to his mom about how good it was.  He is Portuguese and his mom makes bread all the time so I took it as quite a compliment.

Easy and tastes great!  I have stopped buying store sliced bread and just make this now. I am going to try what other reviewers have suggested and try adding some flax seed, or nuts and maybe some oatmeal on the top.

This is fabulous bread . Its the first time I made bread and I'm thrilled with it . I've made it many times since , my family can't get enough of it. 
The second time I added an extra 1/3 cup of water and I was able to get in all the flour . I substituted 1 cup of oatmeal and 1 cup of whole wheat for the white to make it healthier and it is great. I used the tip one person mentioned and kneaded it in the bowl and let it rise in my oven with the oven light for warmth ...speeds up rising!!

The short list of ingredients, simple directions, and the wonderful taste have made this bread a staple in our home.  I substitute Earth Balance for the butter due to kids allergy to dairy and it comes out wonderfully!!!!

I don't have much experience baking bread, so I was looking for a recipe that would turn out better than most of my other attempts.  I LOVE this bread, it tastes wonderful, freezes and slices easily and my toddler loves it!  I hope to make this bread often.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This bread is pretty good. I have made it 2 ways: with oil and with subbing applesauce. It tastes great either way. I only add the first 1/3 c honey, as I really don't like sweet bread. This always turns out soooo moist and freezes really well.

Wonderful recipe!  I subbed milk for the water for a "softer" crust, and kept all other measures the same.  This was easy, quick, and very tasty!  Will make again!

Very good and easy. I made a double batch and froze the extras. It freezes very well. The only thing is I would prefer it to have more wheat flavor.

WOW....Like it..Love it..Gotta have it...this is by far the best.  I have tried several times over the years to make wheat bread but had no success.  And I figured why waste my time when I have a great white bread recipe.  Well, my own white bread recipe takes second to this one now with my family.  This is now instantly a family favorite.  I love that you get 3 loaves.  It really bugs me to do all the steps only to get one loaf, but not this one.   You are rewarded in so many ways.  THANKS for sharing.

This bread is awesome!  Soft and yummy and yet still whole wheat.  I used all whole wheat bread flour and because of physical limitations I used a stand mixer with dough hooks for the first time.  It worked great.  I hope everyone has as much luck as I have with this recipe.  I will be making this again and again.

When I made this bread last week, it was my first time EVER making homemade yeast bread. SUPER easy and unbelievably good! Not too sweet and not at all bland. My whole family gobbled it up. I ended up making another batch 3 days later and it was gone just as quick. I followed the recipe to a "T". The only thing I did different was that I experimented with our new mill and ground my own hard red wheat flour. I know, pretty primative, but it was fun getting back to basics... if only for a little bit because I did however use my Kitchen Aid to mix and knead all the ingredients. :0) I also added 3 TBS of Gluten. After the second rise, I scored the loaves before putting the butter on top and I baked them with a pyrex of water on the bottom shelf of the oven as suggested by others.I will be making this again tomorrow to serve my in laws when they come over for dinner. Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty bread.  I replaced half of the bread flour with spelt flour to make it more nutritious.  I also added cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice as I as making these loaves to go with jars of apple butter for Christmas presents.

This Recipw is very tasty, easy, and, produces Three nice sized loaves!  The directions are perfect. It is very good for eating with a spread (like apple butter) or as a sandwich bread.

I made this recipe and my whole family loves the bread!  I replaced half of the whole wheat flour with wheat germ to put more nutrients in it.  It has the texture of bread from the store but it tastes better!  I'll definately make it again!

Good but not amazing. I replaced half the white flour with wheat and left out the second addition of honey to keep the bread from being very sweet. Brushing butter on the crust turned out great.

Great recipe!  I used all whole wheat flour (South Beach Diet) and the texture turned out great.  I  cut the recipe to 2 loaves because of the size of my mixer.  I used a yeast starter and made a few minor changes in order to use it.  For 2 loaves I put in 2 1/2 cups of starter and added 1/2 cup warm water to the first step.  It took a bit longer to raise because of the starter.  I put in 1 egg along with the salt, etc. trying to give it a good consistency.  I am very excited about this and the loaves turned out beautiful and they taste great.

I've made this recipe 10 times or more - a pleasure each time.  I actually like to vary the flour ratios and I like to add things like oat bran, oatmeal, and wheat germ to get some more healthy goodness out it.  The last time I made it, I split the honey with dark brown muscovado brown sugar and it tasted even better.  Great starting point!

This was a very easy recipe. I loved how the dough was so easy to work with and shape into loaves. I did not need the whole amount of whole wheat flour. However, I just found the recipe to be a bit sweet for me. I realize that is a personal preference. So, if you like a sweet bread, I am sure you will very happy with this recipe. For me, I am going to use less honey or skip it altogether next time. There will be a next time, since this recipe is so easy to work with.

I thought this bread was good.  The only thing is I wish the recipe gave more specific times on how long to do things.  I am not a very good baker so when it says to let the dough rest, it should really give an approximate time on how long you should do this for.

I've never been the bum review before and it bothers me to say this but I don't like kneading with wheat flour.  Most recipes add wheat flour first and knead in white flour. It didn't seem to act right during any step and I was surprised it came out at all. It does taste good (not spectacular) so all I can say is try it for yourself. It's interesting but not a waste of ingredients.

DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS...!!!!!!  I made this today, used rapid rise yeast, and followed the directions exactly.  In 4 hours time I had 3 large loaves of baked whole wheat bread.  This recipe is awesome, and I would not change it at all!  Thanks a lot for sharing this one.

I make this bread every weekend, such a fool-proof recipe.  I do add gluten (2 tblsp) for a higher rise, and I reduce the white flour by one cup, and increase the whole wheat by a cup.  The dough has to be sticky if you increase the whole wheat, otherwise the bread is dry and crumbly.  I also use only 1/3 cup honey as I find it too sweet and increase the water by 1/3 cup.
For variation I use other whole flours such as spelt.  I also never brush the tops with butter - not necessary.

Delicious! Easy recipe. Great texture. Not too “heavy”. I used my stand mixer with the dough attachment to knead my dough since I am never successful in doing it by hand, and it turned out great!

This recipe is amazing. The bread turned out fluffier than I was expecting for a wheat bread recipe. Really yummy too.

I used this recipe in my bread maker. Since the original makes 3 loves I changed the serving size to 12 or 1/3 of the recipe. This automatically converts the amounts for the ingredients, but its not cut and dry. So here's the things I adjusted and calculated to make it work. I added the water, butter and honey first then all the rest of the ingredients saving the yeast for last to go in (typically the best way for bread makers). The yeast was approximately one tablespoon after I weighed it out. I also only used 3 tablespoons of honey, because the honey I have is raw, unfiltered and very dark. I only used one tablesppon of butter and didn't to the part that required the extra butter. I used the large light setting on my bread maker and it came out perfect. My family loved it so much that they ate half the loaf within the first hour of it being done. It was light and fluffy and so delicious.

Great Recipe!

I just recently started teaching myself "breads"  so far I have mastered a cinnamon roll recipe, and now this honey wheat will be a staple I keep around as well.

Would like to see how this recipe turns out with 2 loaf pans instead of 3. OR rolled up into small balls, and baked in muffin tins, 3 balls per muffin cup to make cloverleaf rolls.

Nice soft bread that cuts well for sandwiches.  Also great toasted or simply buttered!

I bought a nice clear 6" x 6" x 12" tall container that I coat with oil, and put the dough in for the 1st rise.  I can mark the level of the dough on outside of container, and easily can see when dough has doubled in size (height) since the sides go straight up.  (Sometimes it can be hard to tell when doubling has been reached when using a curved bowl that is wider at top as dough rises out and up instead of just up.)

I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to start baking bread regularly go buy a similar tall, straight sided container.

A+ recipe.

thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe outlines. Turned out great.  I did turn one loaf into cinnamon raisin bread by adding about a 1/3 cup of cinnamon sugar and an equal amount of raisins. All three loaves are wonderful. Excellent recipe that is a keeper.

for some reason my bread isnt rising,  not a Baker by any means. I might have had the water to hot? or maybe I missed the hot water and honey first till it mixed well then added the yeast. not sure I'll try it again next weak.

I made this bread New Year's day. I forgot to add the salt, but it was still wonderful.

I used King Arthur flours. If you use these flours you may want to use either a little less flour or a bit more water. I used about 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour. I also used SAF instant active yeast. I didn't do the 30 minute autolase. I don't think it was necesssary.

I made this in two loaf pans. I like a taller loaf than those depicted in the video. 

The bread had excellent crumb and a delicious flavor. I wish there werre more whole wheat flour. I will probably play with the ratio of bread to wheat flour a bit.

I divided the dough into two rounds, baked in cake pans.
I brushed them with egg and baked them at 375 for 30 minutes with a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.

This is a great recipe! I am a relatively new bread baker and found this recipe to be reliable, accurate, and satisfying. The only thing I do differently from the original is that I halve the recipe and instead of dividing the dough into thirds, I bake it as one large loaf for about 45 minutes. Still get a really fluffy, hearty sandwich bread and a deliciously golden brown crust after brushing it with butter out of the oven. Never buying bread from the grocery store again tbh

I think this recipe is good, however I messed it up, or my yeast was not good. Did not raise enough so it was very dense and slightly under-cooked. That being said, the flavor was good.
Will try this again.

This recipe is pretty much foolproof and perfect! The ONLY thing I did was omit the other 1/3cup honey, as I found it too sweet. Otherwise, it’s perfect!

It was alright. I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread turned out fine. It's kinda bland on its own, but it would make a good sandwich bread. If I make it again, I might use more wheat flour to white flour instead to give it a more interesting flavor.

Sweet, soft, and hearty describes this easy to make bread! I opted to make burger buns instead of the third loaf. So glad I did! Topped with a homemade ground chuck bacon cheddar burger . . Mmmmm a five gold fork meal!

My first bread maybe ever, and I modified a few ingredients. It took 35-40 minutes (in my oven) and still tasted a little doughey (which is kinda good), so overall happy with it.

Followed the recipe and there was a serious lack of rise givent eh amount of yeast recommended here.  Frankly the amount of yeast seemed light to me but I went with it against my own instincts and ended up with 3 oversized rolls that might have made 2 smallish loaves of bread had I followed my own instincts at that point instead of deciding to stick with the instructions and see how it turned out.  

Pretty disappointing, particularly since I'd hoped to give a loaf to my ailing mother-in-law and the options from which I'm left to choose aren't great.

I have now made this about 6 times.  Superb recipe.  Only change I made after the first 3 tries was adding gluten wheat flour as recommended by another reviewer.  It helped in the bread proofing.  I found  that the original recipe made about 3-700 gram loaves.  They seemed to do better in my 9x5 bread pan when I increased the loaf weight to 850 grams. I reduced the ingredients to produce 2 loaves.  I also changed the ingredients to grams.  This made measurement much faster for me.  It came out to

I have made this recipe three times now. My family loves it, and so do the people with whom I've shared. I was low on honey the first time I made it and substituted molasses for the first 1/3 c of honey. I used mostly molasses/treacle the second time (forgot honey at the store), and all honey the third time. I think I like the half and half. The molasses adds a nice depth to the bread as well as a little color... not to mention it cuts the cost per loaf and adds iron and other nutrients.

Great and easy bread! First time making bread, and I didn’t change anything in the recipe. They  took an hour to cook but turned out amazing! I’ll definitely make this again!

Turned out perfect! Made 2 loaves rather than 3 so we can have larger slices. Can’t wait to make it again!

I have been making bread for 40 years, and this is by far the best I have ever made !  Excellent recipe exactly as written.  My modifications, use 1/2 the amount of honey, and add 3/4 cup Red River Cereal and 1/4 cup unsalted sunflower seeds to change it up once in a while.  You could probably throw in your own favourite nuts or seeds and it would still be amazing

My daughter made this for her 4-H project this year. We had tried a few recipes but came back to this one because not only was it easy for her, since she had never baked bread before, but the honey made it so sweet and the whole wheat was so tasty. She got Reserve Grand Champion with this bread! We make it weekly now!

It was easy to make. It came out nice, but a little too sweet for me although I used less honey than the recipe called.

I bake a lot of bread, and this one is so delicious and easy! I replace some of the flour with a grain/seed blend to make it a little heartier, and it's absolutely delicious. I bake 3 loaves in smaller tins and freeze two of them.

I made this recipe exactly the way the recipe said and I loved it.  Very easy to make and I have made a lot of bread.  Sent it to my son and he said the same thing.   My daughter in law found it too sweet.  I experimented with not using as much honey and changing to white sugar.  She liked it a lot better so now we use ½ the sweetness it calls for and still a terrific recipe.  My go to for bread.

What a wonderful surprise! I used half the recipe and let my bread maker do the kneading. After 45 minutes I took the dough out and made two freestyle loaves out of it. Dusted it with flour and scored some lines on it. Let it rise for 45 minutes and baked for 20. They looked amazing and tasted fantastic. I did put some seeds and course grains in it as well. Thank you for such a great recipe!

Absolutely perfect bread! I made four loaves on the weekend. Two regular, one a sweet nutty cinnamon, and one a savoury herb bread. All turned out fantastic and it was one of my first times making bread.

The slightest changes included blooming the yeast in 1 cup of warm water (100-105 degrees) with 2 tsp of sugar. Let sit for 3 min unstirred. Then sit until all is dissolved and let sit another 10 min before pouring into flour mixture. Also only used 2 tsp of salt rather than tablespoon because low salt diet of family member. Braided the dough into two loaves and baked as directed.

This bread was pretty tasty! I followed the instructions and, after a slight mishap with the flour, it baked up well.  However, I wouldn't suggest halving the recipe...  The amount of whole wheat flour just seemed too much for the dough and it made the texture a little off.

I absolutely love this receipe. I make all of our family's bread, preferring homemade foods that don't contain pesticides. I use organic flours for it. I also decrease the second amount of honey to 1T from 1/3 cup to give the bread a slightly more savory taste. It has turned out perfectly every time. People gobble it up and tell me how much they love it.

This bread is amazing but until you perfect the incorporation of ingredients don't toast it in the toaster. If you don't make it right it won't taste right when toasted.

I only had honey with Tumeric in it and used it for a great taste. I split one of the loaves into small pieces right before putting in the bread pan...and made Monkey Bread by rolling the small risen dough balls in sugar and cinnamon.

Amazing recipe! The bread is absolutely delicious. I made it just as the recipe says with the exception of using a stand mixer instead of kneading by hand. Incredible!

What fabulous bread! I ended up using a couple of cups of multigrain bread flour as well as the whole wheat, and it turned out exactly the way I wanted! Soft, chewy, tight crumb, flavourful bread. I don't find it too sweet at all, and the honey gives it a lovely flavour. I'm glad it makes a full three loaves, as I'm already half way through a loaf for "tasting purposes." One pointer; I'd watch your mixture carefully during the first proofing. It can overproof easily,  and then it won't rise as nicely in the oven.  Other than that, it's a very easy recipe, and I'll be using it regularly! Thank you!

This is my first time making this bread...or any bread for that matter, which I realized undervalues my opinion at this point, but I must share. 
First of all, my house smells absolutely amazing. You know how the really good pretzel places in the mall smell like? The ones where they make them right in front of you. It's like that, but BETTER!
With this recipe I made two 5x9 loaves, two 6 inch bread twists, four bagels and a lumpy blob my 5 year old son created. While they were cooking, I made some shells and cheese, not the good kind, but the kind you get at Aldi...which will do in a pinch. After I buttered one of the twists, I ate it warm with my huge bowl of shells and cheese. I quickly realized that I was committing a culinary offense by eating this sacred bread with the chemical cheese residing in the bowl before me. It won't happen again, trust me!
Another noteworthy item would be the flexibility of the recipe. With my complete lack of bread making experience, I had absolutely no idea how much dough to use for one bagel. Was I supposed to let it rise? Do I roll it out super thin like an ink pen with the expectation that it will grow to average bagel size in the oven? I've made Pillsbury crescent rolls before that sh** is magic!
The other option was to roll them about a tiny bit smaller than what I expected as the finished product and hope for the best. I chose the later option, but I admit, I didn't set foot out of that kitchen for fear of hearing the hiss of dripping do

Best bread ever! Followed the recipe exactly but did some efficient experimenting y making one third of the dough as a loaf, one third as 5 rolls and freezing the last third. Looking forward to seeing if the frozen dough will make just as awesome of a loaf next week :)

I made this bread this morning and it is amazing!  Such an easy recipe and it tastes delicious and is so soft!  I didn’t realize my daughter had used up the rest of my honey, so I subbed with sugar. Turned out perfect but can’t wait to make it again with honey. I don’t usually 5-star a recipe, but this one really deserves it!

This bread was FANTASTIC! It was so soft and perfect.  It was exactly what I needed for a sandwich bread.It rose up beautifully and made 3 perfect loaves.  I actually used 5 1/2 cups wheat (+3 tbs gluten) and 3 cups white flour, but the total of about 8 1/2 cups of flour is perfect. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tbs due to health concerns. I added 3 tbs flaxseed meal.  I will be making this again and again.

I was very disappointed with this bread.It smelled amazing when it was baking and looked perfect when it came out of the oven.Sadly when i tasted it  i didnt like it at all as it was cloyingly sweet! i followed the recipe exactly but there was way too much honey in there for a bread recipe.

This recipe looked so simple I didn’t think it would be as good as all the reviews said or as good as it turned out. For whole wheat bread it is very light and fluffy. Very delicious! Melt in your mouth good! And very easy!

Delicious, and has a great texture! My new favorite recipe, especially since I've started baking my own bread using un-genetically modified flour from Montana. I'll be making this again and again.

Made as per recipe except I substituted white sugar for the 2nd portion of honey. 
I made 2 loaves (I had to make free form loaves because my bread pans are packed) and a pan of cinnamon rolls. My loaves look a bit crazy and flat because they were free form, but they were fluffy and tender and delicious.
Family raved about all of it. Absolutely the best whole wheat bread I have ever made.

I followed the recipe exactly. I’ve made bread many times. These loaves flattened out on top. The taste is rather bland. The texture is nice, though.

I’ve been making this recipe 1-2 times a week for a few months now and I think I have the recipe how I like it. Here are the changes I’ve made:

First,  I use my KitchenAid mixer for the main kneading step. I did this step by hand the first dozen or so times I made it. I have noticed no difference in using the mixer, beyond saved energy.  

Next, I add 1 cup of oatmeal and decrease bread flour to 4 cups during the first step.

Third, I increase the wheat flour from 3 1/2 cups to 4 cups. This might vary depending on where you live, but it seems pretty consistent where I’m at.

Fourth, I add 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds & 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds to the dough at the end of the  kneading in the wheat flour.

Fifth, I slice the dough along the center before baking. It tends to rise a lot and this controls how it expands.

Finally, I vary up how I finish the loaf. If I’m looking to make it look pretty, I use an egg wash and sprinkle with seeds. If I’m looking to enhance the flavor, I brush it with butter after baking. However, out of laziness, I often do nothing beyond letting it cool. It may not look as good as it can, but it is still presentable and tasty.

Love this bread! I’m a bread baking novice, and this is darn near foolproof. I used a heavy duty bowl lift KA mixer and kneaded it on 2 for about 5 minutes. I added sunflower & pepitas to the tops of two of the loaves before the second rise. I had mixed results. Here’s the method I tried: Dampen a tea towel & spread seeds on the towel. Shape the loaf & sort of rock the top & sides of the loaf in the seeds. 1st loaf I did that with was less than satisfactory; most of the seeds failed to stick. Second loaf: I shaped the loaf and sprinkled water all over the top, then dumped it over into the seeds and rocked it back & forth. That worked!! Makes for a wonderful crunch on the crust.

This is the first time I've been happy with a loaf of wheat bread that I've baked. Note: another reviewer suggested you use two loaf pans instead of three, which I did, but duh, you have to cook it for longer :) The loaves turned out fluffy and tasty. Thank you!

This has to be one of the best wheat breads I have eaten.  I didn't add the butter at the end to 'keep the crust from getting hard' and it's still nice and soft. I will be keeping this in my recipe book. Thanks!

My favorite bread to make! It's so easy and everyone falls in love with it!  I like to heat the rising bowl a wee bit in the oven before I put it in to let it rise. It speeds the rise up. It's SO GOOOOD!

Was very easy to put together. No issue getting good rise. Definitely made 3 loaves which is a lot of dough to manage. My kitchenaid mixer was maxed out dough-wise so watch carefully if you have an older model like mine. We’ve enjoyed the bread, mostly toasted or as a sandwich melt. Would like more whole wheat and less white bread flour so still on the hunt for my weekly store-bought replacement. Recipe works as written. Will prob try again it was so easy.

I followed the recipe but cut it in 1/2 since I only wanted a single loaf of bread.  I put the extra dough in the freezer and I'll use it later to make rolls.  The instructions were easy and the bread turned out perfectly.  This is the best sandwich bread I've ever tasted.  The hardest part was waiting for the bread to rise 1 inch above the pan so I could pop it in the oven.

Everything went well until I took the pans out after the 2nd rise to heat the oven for baking.  They collapsed. Tasted good. I'll try it again.

I added more sugar and honey to the recipe to get the golden top that I didn’t get last time!

I have made this bread about a half-dozen times and it always turns out great. I love the simplicity of this recipe! I now make just a few modifications to it:

-I just made it using 5 cups of white whole wheat flour mixed with 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten instead of the bread flour. I just wanted to make the entire loaf whole wheat. The vital wheat gluten adds the extra protein that bread flour would have, giving it a good rise. 

-I use 1/4 cup of honey instead of 1/3 cup in both instances. Still tastes plenty sweet in the end but cuts back slightly on sugar. 

When I made it with these modifications, it only took about 2-3/4 cups regular whole wheat flour added in after the second rise to get the dough to the correct 'barely tacky' consistency.

Just made it the 3rd time and it's our favorite bread recipe.  Excellent texture and flavor, even when I kind of screwed it up a little... still came out beautifully.  It's quickly become our monthly bread recipe.  Making 3 loaves at a time, no need for store-bought bread.

This Recipe is AMAZING!!y first time making bread and it came out perrrfect. 
I did what some reviews recommended to divide in two loaf pans instead of 3 for sandwich type bread. I didn’t have honey so I used sugar (same quantity) and added 1/3 cup water. 
Will be baking my own bread from now on.

My grandmother was born in 1887 (I'm not a young man). 
 She cooked by texture, taste and smell.  Her bread was the best I've ever had until now.  This is a very simple, rock solid recipe.  I used bread flour, not all purpose flour, per the recipe.  Fairly certain that's important. Unlike the video I let the dough rise about 1/2" above the pan.  This did not diminish the old style denseness of the bread at all.  You will be glad you tried this one especially if you are new to making homemade bread.

This was my second attempt at making whole wheat bread the first time was a disaster. But this time SUCCESS! It turned out perfectly and most importantly my family loved it.

I didn’t change the original recipe - but in the future I’ll add a small pinch more of salt since this makes a lot of bread, I’d also recommend smaller batches - again since it’s so much, but if you do make the entire amount it freezes very well and reheats in the oven nicely.

I've made this recipe several times.  It needs at least 45 minutes in the oven.  Every time I've baked it for 30 minutes it comes out doughy in the middle.  Otherwise it's an awesome recipe.  Good bread.

Great recipe! - my go-to for a number of years. Three loaves makes this perfect for my big family.. leftovers or a loaf to share.  Like others, I have made slight changes. My favorite is simple.. reduce the whole wheat flour to 3 cups, and add 2 cups (more or less) of cooked steel cut oats (dough will be quite tacky.) It's the perfect way to use up leftover cereal, and we love the extra moist, textured loaf with crunchy crust. (How I cook my oats: 3c water, 1c steel cut oats.. brown slightly.. 7 minutes in electric pressure cooker, 20 minutes to release pressure.)

A solid wheat bread, and super beginner-friendly! This was my very first attempt at bread a few weeks ago (though luckily my mom was there to help - she used to make bread frequently, but a long time ago) and turned out well!

Loved it .. I didn't have to add any extra flour just the amount of white and wheat listed in the recipe and my bread came out light, fluffy and very tasty.
I rubbed the crust with butter immediately after taking them out of the oven and pans which made for a nice buttery crust. Will definitely make this again!

Kept ingredients all the same but did as suggested by others, and used two tins instead of three. I dropped the wife at work, the kids at school, then started to bake,  yet still had the loaves out of the oven by 1200. First time making bread - Who knew it would be so easy??  I kept things simple by using my Kenwood. For the second rise after all of the kneeding was done, I poured oil in then coated the outside of the dough. This only left the mixing bowl when it was time to be cut and placed in the bread tins. And blow me down, all three of my fussy kids eating the same food when the came home from school - my eight year old even insisted on taking a few slice to share with the kids next door!!

Great baseline whole wheat bread. I made it with some oats and pumpkin seeds added and it turned out beautifully. I would say you don't need quite as much honey as it calls for.

Great recipe.  I made this by hand.  I felt it had way to much sugar so I  cut the amount of honey in half and I am really glad I did.  I also halved the recipe and had enough for one 9x5 pan and a small round on the side.  The round puffed up nicely and did not lose it's shape.   I don't think this loaf is going to last very long in my house!

I followed this recipe exactly the way it was written.  It was not fit to eat.  It didn't raise, it didn't  make the big loaf shown here.  The yeast was good and foamed up when I started..  I do not know what went wrong.  I make white bread a lot, but not whole wheat bread.

This was awesome! It was great sandwich bread and amazing plain with butter. Maybe partly because I was patient enough to wait for it to rise enough this time. I ran out of honey, so I put in a little less and substituted a little sugar. I also ran out of refined white flour after 1 cup, and I used whole white flour for the rest, but it still turned out super light and fluffy.

Turned out great! I cut the honey and did half/half on my flour instead of 5/3 (4 cups bread/4 cups whole wheat) so that it was a regular whole wheat bread and it was delicious. I also added all of the flour at once instead of in segments. Mine took about 45 minutes to bake though, maybe because I added more whole wheat flour. Also just a tip to make bread rise faster, push it out flat on an oiled baking sheet and put it in the oven at about 100 degrees, the dough will rise for the first proof in half the time!

The kids love it and it turns out great ever time! 
I have successfully substituted sugar for the honey or used a mix of both.
I also cut the recipe in half (use 2 cups whole wheat flour) and baked the dough in a bread loaf pan for 25 minutes.

I gave 3 out of 5 because I ended up using reviewers recommendations for a mostly 100% whole wheat loaf.  I used 6 cups of whole wheat flour and 1  cup bread flour, and added 3 tablespoons of flax seed meal and 3table spoons of vital gluten.  I also decided to use olive oil instead of butter (I hate the taste of butter). 

The bread looked beautiful but was so dense and had an off flavor - there was a significant bitter aftertaste.  Unsure why since there was so much honey in the recipe.  

Next time I will try the recipe as is and will add an update.  Overall I'm disappointed with the other reviews.

My boyfriend is a meat n potatoes, stuck n a specific "bachelor healthy" diet. Me being a retired Vegetarian, i thought making bread for his (everymorning) breakfast PB n honey sandwich, i tried this recipe and he loved it! 
Ive made it once before and both times ive added some wheat germ and some random seeds i have (sesame, sunflower, and a trio flax/chia/hemp seed blend) this time i used 1/2 cup molasses when called for honey with bread flour then added some stevia to even out when calling for honey when adding whole wheat. I havent finished baking yet so we will see how it tastes!
Also, i seemed to goof the rising last time but i was trying to make it between work and night school so this time i took a FULL Sunday afternoon to allow it to rise as needed. today its a nice Arkansas hot n humid summer day so its rising alot faster ;) so make sure you give youself plenty of time, make it in-between cleaning house (aka folding clothes while catching up on netflix) Pip

This is my go-to recipe for whole wheat bread.  The more I make it the better I get at it.  This last time was very soft and tasty.  If you have not tried this yet, do so because it is fantastic.

This recipe worked well. I didn't use a bread machine, but I enjoyed kneading and it wasn't hard or very time consuming to knead it. This is also my first time making bread of any kind, but my whole family loved it and all three loaves were gone within four days.

This is a fantastic honey wheat bread! I made this using my bread machine to do all the mixing and kneading, but cooked it in loaf pans in the oven. I did halve the recipe. I still had 2 loaves with only half the recipe. Definitely replacing my previous honey wheat bread recipe with this gem.

Been baking bread for 45 years. Made this recipient twice and failed both times.  Bread tastes good but fails to rise properly and is a bit dense ( as well as flat). No, I didn’t overflour it, it just doesn’t seem to like me lol

Haven't made bread in almost 10'years, and that was with a bread machine, so I was encouraged by all the positive reviews. I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it turned out awesome. My husband and son both gave it a thumbs up (they aren't critical of my cooking but they don't sugar coat their reviews when they don't like something). I decided to try making my own bread since I'm never sure of all the ingredients listed on the label of commercial bread and the cost of "bakery" bread isn't budget friendly. They say practice makes perfect but this recipe makes even a non-accomplished cook/baker look amazingly accomplished.

I never write reviews, but this recipe deserves it! I reduced the recipe to 1/3, so I could have just 1 loaf. I first let the yeast hang out in the sugar water (I used sugar because I had no honey) for 10m, then added flour for 30m, per the directions. I used my KitchenAid to knead on 1 for 10m. My first rise was 40m, and my second rise in the loaf pan was only 30m. The size/ proofing was perfect. Just the right density and taste, with a perfect crust. I've never seen my own cooking look like something store-bought!

Wow what a great recipe! Probably one of the most satisfying I have ever made! I did all the mixing and kneading in my stand mixer and have had success with a few substitutions too! I was horrified by the way the Video showed shaping loaves and by the look of many of the pictures posted on here the baking time is a bit off... Mine came out great when I checked the internal temp with an instant read thermometer (190-210) I had to add like 20 minutes to the bake time

This was my first time baking bread. At first, I was a little worried I had messed up the initial steps as the dough didn't bubble or rise all that much. But I still went on and followed the recipe.

In the end, it worked out really well, the bread is extremely tasty compared to what you can buy off store shelves. I'm done with store-bought breads! Now I just have to refine my skills.

I made two loaves today and literally ate them both before the day was done. 
Sigh. I need to limit myself on delicious and addictive recipes.

I can't believe how easy it is to bake delicious bread! Why have I been buying it for so long?! I decided to bake bread for my family, because I noticed that the bread I was buying had preservatives in it, and the organic bread was too firm and quite costly. Baking this bread has been the perfect solution. This recipe makes 2.5 loaves, and I freeze 1.5 loaves after they are all baked. Love it!

My first attempt at making bread by hand.  After reading many recipes, I chose this for the straight forward instructions.  Turned out perfect!  I made 2 large loaves as I only had 2 loaf pans and baked for the same time.  Will be making more to come soon.  My kitchen aid did the work and only added minimal (maybe 1/2 cup) additional whole wheat flour.

Great recipe.  Did everything as recipe stated except I accidently left out the second 1/3 cup of honey and it still turned out great. I make a lot of bread and this one is going to be a favorite.  So pleased on how it turned out on all 3 loaves. Thank you for the recipe.  Such a perk that it is so versatile in the adding of seeds and such.

Not a bread baker but I had the urge to try. So glad I did. This was a great recipe and not complicated at all. Followed the directions and voila! Perfect!!

I've actually made this recipe 3 times. I'm doing it again today. My family loves it.  We cannot go back to store bought bread! I'm always iffy about adding an additional 2-4 cups of wheat flour while kneading. At most I've added 1 cup and my loaves have come out fantastic!

I used only whole wheat flour, and it came out great! I didn’t need much more than the initial 5 cups.  After the first rising that you punch down, it helped to gently roll out the dough into three rectangles with a rolling pin, roll the dough into loaf shapes, and seal the edges before the final rise in the loaf pans.   The loaves came out beautifully, and they taste terrific! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I followed the instructions and didn't make any changes... Yet. This is a wonderful recipe as it is but I think I may try some loaves with some add-ins such as stone ground oats, bulgur wheat, or oatmeal. Just to try it. It's a very easy recipe to make. I did follow one of the other poster's ideas and I froze two of the sections of dough and only baked one loaf. I'm now baking a second loaf from the frozen dough and it works wonderfully.

This is a near perfect recipe.  I did make changes to the amount of flour I used.  All recipes seem to call for too much.  I cut the first amount to 4 cups and the second to 2 1/2.  I also substitued molasses for part of the honey since I had run out of honey and liked the flavor so will continue to do this.  Otherwise, it looked just like it's picture and tasted delicious.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for wheat bread.

This is a great wheat bread recipe; the only change I made was only 1 tablespoon honey total as I don’t care for the sweetness . I used it to make hamburger type buns for pulled pork and they got rave reviews. Great recipe, nice texture.

The first time I made this, it was okay. After watching a few YouTube videos about proper kneading, dough-shaping, and flour-measuring techniques, my second batch of loaves was much, much better. I also tried substituting regular all-purpose flour for the bread flour and I liked this fluffier, less-dense outcome a bit better. Happy baking!

I have made this bread at least a dozen times and it comes out great. I do use a kitchen aide with a mixer and dough mixer attachment. which cuts down on the kneading for me and incorporates the flour nicely. I did cut back on the sweetener to 2 1/4 cups. We have a lot of maple syrup, so I use that instead of honey. other than that, I do the exact measurements the recipe calls for. Good luck . This is a great beginners recipe.

I do NOT know what happened, but my dough literally did not rise at all haha. Aren't you usually supposed to only let the yeast and water bubble up initially? Instead of all the ingredients together? Anyways I followed the instructions and nothing ever rose so now I have extremely dense, non fluffy bread. Maybe it was my yeast, can yeast go bad? I would also recommend creating a recipe for ONE loaf of bread because I only own one loaf pan and it was difficult to split this recipe in thirds lol. Ok that is all, hope everyone is having a nice day.

As soon as this loaf is, gone I will make this recipe again and again. 
My wife loves it and I may now be a whole wheat fan as well as a  
white bread fan. (after this whole wheat bread I'm not sure
which one  is in first place).
Thank you Allrecipes and Nita Crabb

I think if you divide the dough after the kneading process, the bread will be better.

Perfect recipe. The only thing that I did differently was to let in rise twice in the bowl before dividing it into loaf pans and then let it rise about an inch above the edge of the pans before baking. This will be my go-to bread recipe from now on.

While the bread may be fine, don't know, but the recipe is sure not fine.   Looks like it is a white bread recipe, then becomes a whole wheat recipe.   With all that flour, there has to be more than 3 loaves of bread.   At least 5 cups of white and at least that amount of whole wheat.   I don't think so.

Made two perfect, tall loaves. I only needed 2.5 cups whole wheat flour, probably because I skipped the second honey addition. I didn't want the sweetness in the loaves, but also ended up with less whole wheat flavor.  Next time I will reduce the bread flour and use more whole wheat.

The first time I made this, it turned out great.  The second and third time I could not get the dough to rise the second time (in pans).  After the second time, I cut down the first rise but it didn't make any difference.  Anyone know what I did wrong?

I made it exactly as the recipe states, except I cut it in half and made one large loaf.  I baked it for 30 minutes, but should probably have made it 35.  It's a delicious bread, slightly sweet, chewy, and the crust is wonderful!  I'll make it often, and adjust the bake time.

I have been making this bread for at least 2 years and I have never had a problem.  It has become our weekly bread!!  When my older sons came for Christmas they ate me out of bread and demanded I give them the recipe:-)  If I Ito give any tips I'd say that it usually doesn't take as much whole wheat flour as listed but I just knead in as much as I need.  Also, I can't seem to get three loaves out of it but two large loafs are fine for us.  Great recipe!!!

Super easy to make. I add the 1/4 of gluten that one of the other reviewers suggests ,1/2 bob's red mill 6-grain cereal, and sprinkle whole oats on top. Yummy

Followed recipe other than using 100% freshly milled whole wheat. Crust is perfect, great flavor. This was excellent for having no white flour in it! Fantastic both for sandwiches and making stellar toast. We like it significantly better than our old favorite- Great Harvest honey wheat bread. Easy recipe for this novice bread baker. Bosch mixer had no issues with the large heavy dough. Cannot recommend this enough, and try milling your own flour. It makes a huge difference!

Baking bread has become a weekly routine.
 This recipe  has become my favorite whole wheat one. 
Only difference --  use 2 cups water, 1 cup milk.

I only own two loaf pans so I kept everything (except salt) the same and added two cups of organic white flour to the yeast mixture and added enough whole wheat flour to make a beautiful wheat dough.  Everybody in my family loves this.  I've got two more loaves going today and I'm going to add about 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds to the dough while kneading in the whole wheat flour.  This is the easiest bread recipe I've ever made.  Also, I didn't knead it very long (only a minute or two) because I whisked the white flour & yeast mixture for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients, which brings out the gluten.  Kneaded dough is ready for first rising when you push down on the ball of dough and it kind of "bounces" back.

One of very few recipes I didn't feel the need to modify, and it turned out PERFECT. I almost always add a tablespoon of gluten per cup of flour and dry milk to soften the loaf, but amazingly this recipe doesn't need it...

I did cheat--Used the Kitchenaid....

I adapted this to make one loaf (why would I want to make fresh bread and then freeze it??). I increased the whole wheat flour to 3/4 of the total. I added an egg and used milk instead of water. I also added 1 T. vital wheat gluten. I let it rise over the evening and overnight to make about a 24-hour total prep time (the kitchen is cool this time of year); the result was wonderful. The long rise (plus egg, milk, and honey!) may help develop the delicious flavor. I'll definitely make this again, and work toward reducing the white flour still more.

I'm giving this a 4 even though by batch was completely ruined from using fresh-ground, sprouted wheat flour for the whole wheat portion. The center was very mushy. Next time I will use regular store bought whole wheat flour. The flavour was awesome even though the bread was gooey. I really liked the sweetness. . I sprinkled the egg-washed crust with onion powder and oregano before baking.

Made as written...except I let it rise twice before forming into loaves for final rise before baking. This is a great textured bread and tasty, too. My husband gave it the nod....liking it better than another honey wheat from this site. I froze two balls of dough to thaw in refrigerator the night before the next baking day.

I made a half recipe and made some of the add-in changes suggested (flax seed and sunflower seeds) . I also started with whole wheat and added in white. So it was mostly whole wheat. I used my stand KA mixer but had to hold onto it to keep the bowl in place while the dough hook was doing its thing (10 minutes as level 2). I would like to know if anyone has figured out to what internal  temperature of the bread should be to know when it is correctly baked. I usually use temperature as a test for doneness for bread...190-205 depending on the recipe (using an instant read thermometer)...more reliable then the "knocking method" for me. This is the lightest whole wheat bread I have ever made. thanks!

The search is over... I started baking all of our bread a little over a year ago and have tried so many wheat recipes.  Finally, I have found one that is soft and tasty like the one my kids used to love from a local bakery.  I halved the recipe and added 1.5 tsp. of vital wheat gluten (as instructed by MommyFromSeattle's review) but otherwise, followed the recipe.  I only use SAF Instant yeast (try it!), and measured .25 oz. by weight.  First rise was done in a little under an hour so I deflated it and shaped it for my 10x5 loaf pan, which I greased with PAM spray.  2nd rise was a little quicker and it domed beautifully.  Oven spring was also great and we ended up with a large, soft, beautiful wheat loaf.   I buttered it when it was done for a soft crust and it was hard to wait for it to cool so we could try a slice.  It is now the next day and it's still soft, tasty and made wonderful toast this morning.
  
I will say that, although I measure by weight, I was surprised that after adding the initial measurement of wheat flour the dough came together without adding any of the recommended additional wheat flour.  I know that dough hydration is dependent on so many factors, but if this continues to be the case in my kitchen, then I will decrease the amount of white flour so I can add more wheat!  All and all, we love how it turned out but my oldest child requested that I give it a little more wheat flavor next time.  YAY!

Made exactly as outlined and it turned out perfectly!!    Just recently found out the key to insure that it rises is to make sure the yeast is completely dissolved in the water, then add to flour, etc.  and mixed with my Kitchenaid mixer.  Really excited to have found this recipe - it is a keeper!!

I love this recipe. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 mths. After 30 years of never baking bread I got sick of the high-priced, poor quality breads available in the supermarket so decided to try this one. It was so easy! The honey adds just a little sweetness that I enjoy. I also made it in smaller loaf pans and gave them as holiday gifts. Also, this bread freezes well. Thanks for making it available.

I am sure this would have been 5 stars exactly as written.  The fact that it came out 5 stars even though I used 100% whole wheat is a real feat.  It came out with a very nice taste and texture.  I added 1/4c vital wheat gluten, which is usually necessary when using all whole wheat.

First time ever making bread. Was an easy enough recipe. I think I messed up somewhere along the lines. My dough didn't rise well when I put it in the loaf pans. I could of had in too cool of a spot or who knows what. However it did taste good!

It took a lot of flour to make the bread stop sticking to the counter at step 2, and it was very dense.

This worked out great. I did follow another reviewers notes to make 2 loaves instead of 3 and it made perfect sandwich sized loaves.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly. I will try to increase the wheat flour and lower the white bread flour, but the recipe is also great as is.

I can't believe I actually made this and it turned out wonderful!  We live in Colorado so I've had a difficult time find a good bread recipe because of the altitude.  This bread is moist with a touch of sweetness.  My house smells like heaven right now.  Thank you for this recipe.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It makes the best wheat bread ever.  I have made it several times.  I added soaked 7-grain cereal(whole and cracked grains)  the last time and it came out great also.  It is now my go-to recipe for wheat bread.  Thank you

I made this Bread and it was excellent, everyone commented how great it was. I used 6 1/2 Cups of Montana Praire Gold and 1 1/2 Cups all purpose flour. It made the best toast, really tasty. JEM

I haven't had much success making this type of bread before, but all the rave reviews convinced me to give it a try. I was so pleased with the result! The dough handled really well and rose nicely. I made 2 loaves and 12 rolls in a muffin tin; the rolls took almost as long to bake as the loaves, but they turned out well. I did make a change: I used 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup white sugar because I didn't have enough honey. I really want to try this with more whole wheat flour, as other reviewers have mentioned. I think I have found my go-to recipe!

I've made this recipe several times.  It is easy and delicious.  It truly is my "go to" recipe for wheat bread.  I have read the comments of others and have also substituted sugar for honey when not having the honey on hand.

Excellent and easy! The only changes I made were to add a little molasses, some ground flax for fiber, and I used coconut oil instead of butter. The bread turned out great!! I'll be making this bread regularly and adding more grains experimentally.

I am not a baker, but this bread is foolproof. I have had great results making it over and over. My family loves it and wants it all the time. It makes 3 loaves which is great, you can give it away or freeze it. Freezes great.
Make sure your yeast is fresh and don't use a mixer.

Great bread recipe! I tried so many and failed and this one is so easy and so yummy. I do not have a bread machine so I ended up splitting the dough into two half to make two larger loaves. I also add about a cup of ground flaxseed to the mix instead of some of the whole wheat flour. It gives it a nice texture and taste, IMO. I have found that I need to sometimes bake it a little longer, until the tops are golden, to make sure the inside is not too doughy.

Pretty good recipie for a beginner like myself! Only concern was the amount of fought to pans of bread. I divided this into three loaves like the directions call for but I think this dough would be better as two loaves. I also only used half the homes because that's all I had and it was still great!

This bread is amazing!  I have made many loaves of white breads but this is my first to have whole wheat. Absolutely delicious.

I did cut the last 1/3 cup of honey to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of molasses.  Otherwise, all the same.  

Now to just stay clear from eating it ALL by myself!

Taking up bread baking after a long hiatus. This bread rises nicely, has a good flavor. Good for sandwiches or wolfing down willy-nilly.

This is an awesome recipe! I've made this recipe several times and it makes 3 beautiful loaves of delicious wheat bread. My husband is on a low sodium diet so I make it with 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 tablespoon. The end result is a sweeter loaf of bread. This recipe is easy to make.

I've been making bread for a long time. 
Looking for a different recipe I happened upon this one. Wow! This bread is light, flavorful, easy to slice and delicious.
I wasn't exact on the honey, salt, nor the melted butter. I guessimated them all with the feeling that it wouldn't make much difference. I'll be using and sharing this recipe for a long time to come.

Recipe is fantastic - easy to make and results in nice, soft, tasty bread with a hint of honey, with a good blend of regular and whole-wheat flour that makes it not too whole-wheaty, if that makes sense. The loaves bake up extremely well in 9"x4" pullman loaf pans, perfect for sandwiches for kids' lunches. - just 1) make sure to butter the pan, including the lid, 2) put on the lid and bake just as the dough has nearly risen to the lip, and 3) take the lid off 10 minutes before baking is finished. I used King Arthur all-purpose flour rather than bread flour. This recipe's a keeper.

Nice and easy recipe, but bakers beware  that it's not 100% whole wheat bread.  I subbed all flour with white whole wheat and added a few tbs wheat gluten to make it lighter.  That's all I changed.
However, these loaves were kind of small for sandwiches.  I think I would use two loaf pans instead of three following the recipe.

This is an amazing recipe, turned out perfect and this is my first time making bread. I followed the directions exactly and used my kitchen aide with the dough hook for the kneading step (level 2 for about 8 minutes) like one of the reviews suggested. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow! Truly delicious and turned out soft in middle and crispy on crust. I halved the recipe and put all ingredients in my bread machine. I allowed the yeast, water and honey to rest until frothy, poured in melted butter before adding rest of ingredients that I had sifted together prior..the flours and salt . It turned out perfectly and this is my new go to wheat bread recipe! Thanks so much for sharing, this allows my family to have organic bread without all the high costs since I used only organic un-pesticide ridden grains. ??

Awesome recipe.  Anyway, made this bread with slight deviations for approximately 26 servings.  Raise times are important, so I cultured the Yeast in small cup of warm water before mixing it in.  Also, placing on top of stove while preheating oven helps raising by keeping wet dish towel warm.  I also added 1 tbsp of flaux seed.  Bread should have 3 basic ingredients: flour, water, and salt (yeast is not true ingredient).  
Next time in grocery store, count how many ingredients their bread has.  I bet you find more and plenty preservatives.

I had bread anxiety.  I loved the idea of homemade bread, but thought it would be difficult.  I decided to give it a go since I got a beautiful new stand mixer for xmas.  I'm so glad I started with this recipe!  It's awesome, tasty, and easy to follow.  I've made it several times and it's come out great every time.  Once I got busy and let the dough rise too much in the pan, and it fell.  I decided to bake anyway, and although it was a bit flat on top, it still tasted great!  I'll never be afraid to make bread again!

I sometimes use maple syrup(about 1/2 total) since we make maple syrup every year. This is a great and easy recipe and pretty much a no fail . I let the sponge become at least double in size and very bubbly which takes me about 45min. -1 hour when the house is cold. I have used this recipe about a dozen times so far, and making it right now.

We've never made bread before, and this recipe turned out great! Our kitchen smelled amazing while it was baking. We were pretty proud since we are a pair of bread baking novices! We substituted part agave nectar and part brown sugar for the honey. It took a little over an hour each way for the bread to rise. The bread held together well and also did well in the toaster. We will make this again.

This bread is amazing. I use coconut oil instead of butter/olive oil and it tastes incredible. I also split it into two pans instead of three.

i have found many recipes for wholewheat bread online over the years and the results have ranged from tasteless to brick-like. This always comes out really well and swapping types of flours and sweetening agents is easy to do as it always seems to come out perfectly. Rye (1-2 cups) and spelt (1 cup) and 100% wholewheat all work well. The main thing I love about this bread is that my kids love it. Lovely texture and great taste. I find this quantity makes two great sized loafs rather than the 3 smaller ones as the recipes says.

Made this wonderful bread with 100% whole wheat flour and it turned out perfectly!  It was my first time to EVER make bread. In addition to following the instructions, I used some tips from some of the other viewers and watched a quick youtube video on basic bread making tips (I didn't even know how to "punch down" the dough so I had to get a little help).  I used the microwave trick for proofing.  The first stage took about 30-45 minutes to double.  After punching down and splitting into three loaves I rolled the dough out into a rectangle with a rolling pin and then gently rolled the dough up and tucked under the ends to make it fit in the loaf pan.  The second proof in the loaf pan took about 45 minutes-1 hr. Baked exactly as directed and cooled immediately on wire rack but did not top with butter.  Rolling the dough out after punching really helped get rid of larger air bubbles. My finished product had no tunneling and very small uniform air pockets. It tastes AMAZING! My husband, who HATES wheat bread, LOVES it! I think most people have reported a 12-slice loaf but I will get 16 out of mine with a thinner slice. I used 7.5 C total of King Arthur's whole wheat flour, best choice active dry yeast (by  the way .25 oz = 1 packet yeast= 2 1/4 tsp roughly), butter and honey in amounts listed on recipe.  No matter how you slice it (pun intended), one loaf (1/3 recipe) has approximately 1328 kcals, 16.5 g total fat, 7.3 g saturated fat, 852 mg sodium, 242 g carbohydrates, 30 g f

This is, by far, my favorite bread recipe EVER! I've made this for my family on a regular basis, for the past four years or more.  Sometimes I add a couple tablespoons of millet, chia seeds, or flaxseed (or combo of all three!).  It turns out perfect every time.  I've searched around and tried some other recipes but I just keep coming back to this one.

This recipe is my go-to sandwich bread. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it turned out great. However, I don't care for the honey flavor and smell in all my sandwhiches, etc. (it's great in toast!) So I started using half molasses and half brown sugar, and you can't taste the molasses. I use maybe one cup more whole wheat than the recipe calls for also. To help the dough rise, I put it in the oven with the light on and a pan of hot water underneath, and so far I have had no issues. I also knead it briefly after the first rise, before shaping into loaves. It helps to get the air bubbles out.

I make about the same loaf. It is great. I add about 1/4 cup dry milk powder and switch the amounts of bread flour tow whole wheat flower. Finally, I add about 1/4 mixed seeds: millet, sunflower, pumpkin, caraway and fennel-or whatever combination I have on hand.  This is a good recipe. Make it about 1x per week using the no-knead recipe method. makes two loaves for us to use over the course of the week.  The second has a bit more of a sour dough tang and is really good for toasted cheese sandwiches.

Perfect! So, I have made a few different bread recipes now and this one is by far the best!!! I followed the recipe using about 3 cups of wheat flour to the 5 cups of white flour (all my flour was bread flour). I made TWO large loaves of bread in well greased glass pans, at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. The tops will be a dark golden brown when ready, and tapping on them should sound hollow. You can tap on the tops and on the bottoms once they are out of the dishes. Brush the tops with butter once baking is done and let sit in the dish for 10 minutes. Take out of dish place on bread rack and let cool. Remember you need 2/3 cup of honey in total. It uses 2/3 cup twice in the recipe. I used farmers market raw honey. Yum! (I posted pictures of the loaves done and inside the largest loaf exposing the center under the photos for this recipe) Good luck! It's delicious! I will be making this all the time!

I made a few mistakes but think I've got it now.. based on this recipe. 
I used 1 Tbsp yeast to 1 Tbsp sugar to 1 cup warm water. Mixed and let stand 10 minutes until bubbly & cloudy. Mixed in 1 tsp salt & 2.5 cups spelt ww flour in bowl then kneaded on counter surface 5-7 minutes. Put dough ball in greased bowl covered with cloth towel in slightly warm oven (turned on warmer for 2 minutes beforehand) to double in size, about 1 hour. Punched down, folded into log and set in greased baking pan to rise 1" above pan, about 3 hours. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes! Spread melted butter on top as it cools.

I've made this a few times and it always comes out wonderful. I have tried a couple times to bake in only two pans instead of three (as others have suggested), and for me this doesn't work well. The bread rises pretty high when made in the three pans, but way too high when baked in only two pans. The recipe is perfect exactly the way is is written.

Fairly simple to make.  However I am a little confused but just went with my instincts on a few parts....  Could just be the way I interpretted some bits at the time.
Going to attempt to make this again tomorrow, so let's see how it goes then.

FYI, I used a 13x5 pan and a 9x5 pan.  I would recommend still splitting th dough pretty close to in half if you're going to do the same.  I put more dough into the 13x5 and it did not cook all the way through I found out after the second day.  Essentially there was still enough heat retained in the middle of the loaf to keep the yeast activated and it created this HUGE hole right through the middle. lined with raw dough.  Was too late obviously to try and recook at this point, I believe.

Did a little math and changed the recipe to make two loaves instead of three.  I also substituted molasses for the honey.  Used my KitchenAid mixer to do the kneading, so it was really easy to make.  The loaves rose and baked beautifully and the texture of the bread was beautiful.  I will make this again and again!

This bread is delicious and simple to make! I only have 2 loaf pans, so I used the last 1/3 of my dough to make buns. Also, I used unbleached all purpose flour in lieu of white bread flour and used fine sea salt. Even with these small modifications, all items turned out wonderfully!

This was my first time making homemade bread.  My husband really liked it.  I was very unsure about how long to knead it, and I think I should have let it rise a little bit longer before baking but it still tastes great.  Since it makes three loaves can anyone tell me how they store it to keep it fresh?

This is my go-to bread recipe.  I make 4 loaves and freeze 3.  The only changes I make is that I do half honey and half brown sugar but only because honey is so super expensive.  I'm sure it is healthier with only honey but that doesn't always fit into our budget.  I also generally increase the amount of whole wheat flour.  Today I'm going to try throwing in some flax seeds for a little extra nutritional  boost.

I didn't make  any changes. The key with any bread is to create a warm environment!  I was concerned after adding the wheat four that it was too sticky and dense. It came out perfect. Great for butter and jam or a sandwich. My husband is a very happy camper for sure!

This bread is very moist with a nice crust.  I halved the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups semolina and 1 cup whole wheat flour in the beginning and whole wheat for the rest.  Used a bit more water to help with the rise.

Couldn't get the darn thing to rise. I made it once and got essentially thick breadsticks out. The second time I made sure to add extra yeast and I put on the mini heater to make sure it stayed warm to rise but it only got a little bit bigger. I ended up throwing it in only 1 bread pan to cook and it didn't even reach the sides.

I made it per the recipe except that I used my stand mixer with the dough hook rather than working the dough by hand.  It is indeed superb and I expect to make it many more times. The crumb is beautiful, it is moist, and not sweet as I feared.  Next time I will try a bit less white flour and a bit more whole wheat.  Stay tuned...

On 3/23/16 as I edit this review, I've made this recipe three times.  Because I only have two bread tins, I make the last third into cinnamon buns like my Grandma used to.  They are super yummy and freeze well.  

On a well floured surface, pat out the dough into a rectangle.  Don't worry if you can't get the dough to stay out as far as you'd like--I only got mine to perhaps 12" x 7".  Working with the long side toward you, generously butter (no margarine!) between the short edges leaving only about an inch on the top long edge unbuttered.  Generously sprinkle cinnamon on this same portion so you can't see the dough underneath well.  

Roll starting with the long edge near you, pulling a little as you go.  Seal the long edges when finished.  Place the sealed edge down.  If the ends are thicker than the center, pull them a bit, too.  Prepare a medium sized Pyrex rectangular dish by buttering it and pouring about 1/4" of real maple syrup in the bottom. Or, alternatively, use a combo of maple syrup and brown sugar, or even just brown sugar (and perhaps a little more butter).  

Take about a 14" length of sewing thread, slide it under the roll and back

This is a very easy recipe. I reduced the called for ingredients by 2/3  to make one loaf and it came out great. 
A few changes I made: I used a whole packet of yeast, used all whole wheat flour for a healthier bread, used only 1/8 - 1/4c of raw melted honey and it was plenty sweet enough for me, skipped the butter on top of the loaf before baking (the top crust wasn't too hard), and since was making one loaf, I let it rise the second time right in the greased bread pan before baking. 
I only wished I had tried this sooner! I will not be buying expensive, store bought bread again if I can help it.

OMG. This was my first time making homemade bread. I followed the recipe to the T, and it is SO AMAZING! The only thing I did differently was dividing the dough into 2 loaves, not 3. the bread is pretty dense, but my family loves it that way! No more buying bread for us!

I added a little sweetener to it and it made it even better. It tasted so good. Even my teenage daughter had eaten it. She loved it very much. She said she liked the sweet part best.

A very easy recipe. I now use equal parts wheat and white flour to give the bread more fiber. very delicious . I find that the key to a good loaf of bread it to start off with a very good sponge in the beginning step. I make sure it is very bubbly (about 30 min plus ) Also , because we make maple syrup, I use 1/4 cup with each step nstead of the honey.

Makes an absolutely perfect loaf of bread.  I've been looking for a good whole wheat bread, and haven't had a lot of success.  So I played with this recipe a bit - based on suggestions - and added 1 T gluten per cup of whole wheat flour, and replaced 1 cup of bread flour with rye (that's what I had on hand.) The bread was great out of the oven, but the next day it sliced perfectly and made a great sandwich. Will  be playing with this recipe for a while - adding different flours, seeds, etc.  Thanks - this is wonderful.

LOOOOVE THIS BREAD!!! Now, I've made this as-is, and it's fan-fricken'-tastic that way, but, if you want a more healthy bread: you can use ONLY WW flour, and cut the honey in half (I've even used only 1 1/2 tablespoons--added the first time it is called for--for one loaf and it's still wonderful). I do recommend keeping some honey in there, though (the baker who posted this knows what she's doing!). Also, for anyone who is watching their sodium intake, cutting the salt in half won't ruin it. One last thing: if you are only making one loaf and aren't very good at math like me, just use a whole packet (or 2 1/4 tsp) of yeast--the result is the same. Anyway...this bread is just the best with or without alterations. Thank you so, so much, Nita!!

This bread really is as good as the reviews make it seem. It's an excellent bread to start with if you aren't experienced with bread making, as it's  pretty much fool-proof.  If you've never worked with active yeast before then just remember, warm water (warm baby bottle temp) for the yeast - not hot!

Excellent recipe. I've been making bread for many years and this is by far the best whole wheat recipe I've come across. I love making small loaves of this recipe as gifts. It always receives rave reviews from recipients. Moist, dense, and delicious for sandwiches or toast.

I love this recipe, it's simple with a wonderful result.  This is my go to bread recipe now.  Instead of honey I used 1/3 cup apple sauce as I don't like sweeter breads, and it turned out perfect.

Really good simple semi-whole wheat or fully whole wheat bread, so far fool-proof for me, makes three nice loaves of perfect sandwich size.  30 minute bake time. ----------- Had no honey so I made it with sugar instead, 1:1. Did it all by hand, wasn't that hard to do the kneading which I mostly did in the bowl to keep things cleaner.  It didn't take too long to get it evenly textured and "full" of flour.  ----------- The butter brushed on top makes it a lot like a commercial whole wheat or whole grain bread. ----------- Made it for the fourth time.  Substituted in some Amaranth flour and some whole grains (about 1/2 cup each).   Didn't time the rising, but it's very forgiving.  Ran out to the store, took too long, and came back to a HUGE second rise climbing out of the bowl... no problem.  The loaves still rose nicely in the pans, for nice brown, round topped loaves.  -----------  I don't understand why the ones in the video are so flat and pale.  I wish there was some formatting available for these messages.

I'm new to bread making and this was my first attempt at this recipe. I made no changes,  did everything by hand and it turned out great! I love that it makes three good size loaves. This will definitely be my go-to wheat bread recipe.

This one gets full stars from me! I'm new to making homemade bread and haven't seen many recipes but I'm glad this was the first that I found! 
This bread is so delicious my family has been eating it plain. 
The first 5 cups I used whole wheat flour. The additional 2 cups I used 1 cup oat flour and 1 cup barley flour and then whole wheat flour again as needed. It turned out delicious and is incredibly healthy! This one will be used every week in my house!

Made this twice now, enjoyed both times. First time I made it as written except I didn't have bread flour so I used AP flour. It was tasty but a bit sweet for me. Second time I swapped bread flour and wheat flour amounts. (Used  bread flour this time :) ). Also used half of the honey (1/3 c total). It was awesome! Light texture with a hint of honey. Whole family loves it!!

I made this bread for the first time today.  It rose beautifully and the smell of it baking was wonderful.  Adding the butter on top after baking worked very well
Anyone that wants some GREAT whole wheat bread should use this recipe.

This bread is remarkable!  I was a little hesitant because I've never mixed flour in with my yeast before proofing so I was worried it wouldn't fluff nicely but after reading some of the other reviews where everyone said they followed the recipe exactly I decided to give it a go, and boy am I glad I did!  I am thoroughly pleased with the result of this recipe.  My loaves are perfectly browned on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside.  I will certainly be making this again!

This was a big hit in my family. The texture was tender but strong enough to hold up to sandwiches and toast. The flavor was just sweet enough and lacked the bitter aftertaste you sometimes get when there's too much whole wheat flour. I will definitely make this again. Be aware that the recipe is just a recipe and not lessons in how to bake bread. You have to already know how to knead, judge how much flour to add in, and so forth.

This bread is awesome!!! It was my first stab at bread-making, so my first attempt was less than perfect. Taste was great, but it came out very dense and was just not quite right all around. I figured it was my fault,  and it was. Did some reading on Epicurious about bread basics, and that helped A LOT. I had also tried to halve the recipe, and that screwed with the measurements.  So, second attempt! With a little more basic knowledge, and with the correct measurements, I was prepared and in control! The dough was perfectly workable, and behaved exactly as it should. I used a thermometer to achieve 190 degree centers in my three loaves, and they came out looking beautiful and tasting delicious! I used all wheat bread, but otherwise changed nothing. Thank you for this great recipe!

This has been my ultimate, favorite bread recipe that I have made at least 2 dozen times!  I do  use my mixer for the first steps including adding the first 2 cups of wheat flour; its easier on my arthritic hands.

Ok I was completely new to baking bread and this recipe is so good and easy that even I could make it and turned out wonderful! Just a couple of tips ( not changes). This makes a lot of dough and while the first rise it almost blew over the largest bowl I had so I started separating the badges. I make 2 good sized sandwich loafs out of that amount of dough so I just cut the recipe in half and make it in 2 bowls. Otherwise the loafs are a little to small for sandwiches! I also make enough for the whole week and freeze the dough. All you gotta do is punch it down after the second rise, wrap it loosely in plastic wrap and then put it in a large zip lock bag and off into the freezer. When needed I take it out at night and let it defrost in the fridge. The next morning I warm up the oven for a minute on lowest setting turn it off but leave the light on, and put the dough into the bread pan, cover it and put it in the nice and cozy warm oven. It will take an hour or two to rise but it will and then you bake it as usually. Just don't take the warm towel off when you take the loaf out of the oven to preheat because it happened to me that the dough completely flattened out because it was pretty chilly in my house! But again, this recipe is amazing and I am glad I found it! Please excuse any mis spelling because I am German so this is my second language. But I still hope that my tips will help!

Excellent. Made 3 good sized loaves. They won't last long. This bread is easy to make, and delicious. I only added 1 cup of wheat when kneading. It seemed like enough, and everything turned out ok.  Thanks for sharing.

This bread is spectacular!  I've made it twice, once using the original recipe and the second time using 100% whole wheat bread.  Both times the bread is very light & flavourful.  Will definitely try adding nuts, seeds, oats using this as the base recipe.  Proofing the bread 3x is the secret so do not skip this.

Great wheat bread recipe.  The first time I made it as is, and it was delicious.  I tweaked it a bit for my own personal taste (diabetic)  and my bread machine.  My kids say it is the best bread.  So, it has a kid's seal of approval, and we all know that speaks volumes.

Loved it! Light, fluffy and delicious. We have been perfecting our recipe over the years and I decided to try something new. So glad I did. One thing I will be changing up though next time is forgoing the bread flour for all whole wheat.

Excellent, soft wheat bread. I did half the recipe to make just one large loaf. Cooking time needed to be increased by no more than 5 minutes but I would NOT change a single thing about this recipe. This is the type of bread I like for sandwiches, toasted or grilled. Now, I have the perfect wheat bread recipe to go with my perfect white bread recipe.

Without a doubt, the best wheat bread recipe ever! Moist, light and flavorful. Not heavy or dense like other recipes I've tried. I always add flax and steel cut oats. This recipe is tried and true, very forgiving, and always yields a perfect loaf!

I "veganized" this recipe by using 1lb of finely shredded carrot instead of the honey and omitting the butter. Added some rosemary, sage and thyme and it turned out really, really deliciously. I've found this is a great base recipe for making herb-infused breads!

It was alarmingly sweet, and all that sugar is so unnecessary to make a good bread! I cut the sugar(honey) down to ONLY 1/4 cup. I added it in at the first step with the yeast and followed the directions as is. After it proofed, I added in the wheat flour with the salt mixed in, (omitting the second 1/3 of honey completely) and replaced melted butter with olive oil. After it was baked I brushed it with the tiniest amount of butter, maybe 1/4ts per loaf, and was more than enough (this step is only for crust texture, we are not buttering the bread for flavor!) This is my new favorite bread, and I will be making over and over again!

Excellent recipe.  Stays soft and wonderful.  I kneaded in 1/4C of rolled oats, 2 TB sesame seeds and 2 TB of chia seeds for a wonderful grainy seed bread.  Do this at the end of the 1st rising.

LOVE THIS BREAD!!! It makes 3 large loaves. Its sweet, but made with honey not white sugar so I'm ok with that. It is a bit time consuming, but TOTALLY worth it. We LOVE LOVE this bread. Will make again and again!

This is a great recipe! I followed MommyFromSeattle's advice and added 4 Tablespoons of Vital Wheat Gluten to the dough. I added it with the 5 cups bread flour. The bread had a great texture and brilliant rise. I used two 12"x4.5" loaf pans and it worked perfectly.

What I love about this bread recipe is that there are so many variations possible. I can make it savory, sweet, plain, anything I want. Sometimes, instead of baking 3 loaves, I'll bake 2 and use the remaining dough to make cinnamon rolls. I kneaded this by hand, which was kind of difficult, but it all worked out. If it's a cloudy day and there's no warm spot, I turn the oven to 350 for 45 seconds then put the dough in to rise.

This bread came out fantastic. I would make this over and over again!  I cut the recipe in half incase I didn like the bread and I ended up using whole wheat flour for the whole recipe.  Since wheat flour is a bit denser I ended up using less flour. Otherwise my measurements were 2.5 cups wheat flour at first mixed with 1/4 oz yeast, 1/6 cup of honey and 1 1/2 warm water.  The mixture will be sticky at first so I let it ride for a good 30 minutes.  I pressed it down and added about 1 1/4 cup wheat flour, 1/6 cup honey, sprinkle of salt, and 1 1/2 tablespoon honey.  I kneeded the dough and let it rise for a good hour.  I kneeded the dough one last time in my bread baker and let it rise for one hour in a warm area and baked it on 350 for approximately 25 mins.  Melted one tablespoon of butter I poured over and sprinkled with rolled oats. Yum!!!!

This bread is the BOMB.  I love it as is, but my DH is picky, and his complaint is that it's too crumbly for a sandwich.  It might just be the environment in my kitchen when I made it.  I tried adding a homemade dough enhancer - wheat gluten, potato flakes, and a very small amount of white vinegar - and it came out PERFECT.  It held together with very little crumb.  This is definitely now my go-to bread recipe.

Great recipe! It is first bread that turned out perfectly! On my taste it was too sweet for me, so next time I will reduce the amount of the honey. Otherwise, it is perfect!

I've made this recipe a few times now and it always comes out moist, delicious and perfect. I sub olive oil for the butter that goes in the dough and it still tastes great. Don't skip the butter on top. It seeps in and really boosts the flavor. I only use 2 bread pans to make sandwich size loaves. PERFECT for grilled cheese sandwiches!

This recipe tasted amazing and wasn't to difficult! My only problem was getting it to rise so my bread was a little bit flat, but I blame that on myself.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! My family eats one loaf as soon as it emerges from the oven. I make two regular loaves, then roll out the other and sprinkle cinnamon-sugar all over it before rolling it back up. Also, instead of melting butter, I rub the end of a stick of butter over the tops while hot, skipping the brush and the melting step, while not using any more butter than is necessary. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe as written and the bread turned out beautiful.  I froze two loaves and when I thawed them, they were as soft and moist as the fresh loaf.  My only suggestion is that you should always knead bread for at least 10 minutes, this helps immensely with the rising process.

I been on a bread tear all month long and I'm happy to report that this recipe is the winner. By far. Way better than that pesky Amish White Bread listed on the site. The idea of just a few hours of rising time is a absolute joke though. I admit, we keep the house pretty chilly, but, for me, this bread took almost 8 hours to rise all told. I usually just prepare it in the morning, put it covered in the sunny windowsill and then go about my day. I use one, refrigerate one, and freeze one and that usually last me and my boyfriend a month at least. Get some pepper jack and make yourself a grilled cheese sandwich that will blow your mind.

So yummy! This bread is fail-safe, for sure. My first attempt at sandwich bread and I sure picked a good one! My only complaint is that it is a little too sweet, so i'll cut back on the honey next time.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe. I like that the bread is good even after the first day. Most of the time homemade bread dries out to quickly but this does not. I will say the title is a little misleading however thats why you should always exam the ingredients before starting. I will keep using this recipe and maybe slowly add more whole wheat flour to the recipe to get it closer to an actually whole wheat bread.

The taste of this is great!  However, my bread was very dense and took a long time to cook.  I don't think it's the fault of the recipe, I may have decided to cook on a too rainy day or my oven (very old and cranky) may have decided it didn't like it very much.  I only divided this into two loves, which also may have had something to do with the denseness.  Next time I will add some vital wheat gluten and will divide into three and see if that takes care of the issue.

I absolutely love this bread recipe! I have been trying different recipes in an attempt to find an easy recipe that has wonderful flavor. Found it with this recipe! I used whole wheat floor for the entire recipe and it turned out fluffy and delicious! I will never go back to another bread recipe again!

I've been making this bread for years.  It always comes out fantastic!!  I used to just make 2 very fat loaves, but switched back to the 3 loaf model.  Comes out just as good, IF you are patient and let it rise long enough.  I'm going to try heating up my oven a tad to see if the rising time will decrease.  I have yet to find such a great bread recipe.  I doubt there is another one out there!!

Great recipe! I modified a little after I read other reviewers. I used more whole wheat than bread flour (2:1) and cut recipe in half and made one large loaf. As I usually do when I bake any bread, I dissolve sugar (honey) in warm water and mix dry yeast and wait until foaming, and mix all liquid ingredient, then add one cup of flour at a time in Kitchen Aid mixer. Once mixed, I turn up to level 2 for 3 min with dough hook, then take dough out, rest 15 min then knead with hand for 5-8 min. When you bake, I put baking dish with shallow water on the lowest oven rack. It came out perfect!

Great recipe! Very forgiving. I've been able to manipulate this into a 10 grain wheat bread and it still turns out great!

the bread turned out awesome! I usually prefer white, but this bread is soft and more flavorful than most white breads I've made.

This really is a wonderful recipe. I am very inexperienced with baking, and this was my first time ever making dough completely from scratch without a bread maker. And it turned out perfectly! And the bread is so delicious! I had been having trouble making whole wheat breads in my bread machine, and will never go back now that I know about this recipe.

Just made this recipe tonight and it was pretty simple, definitely time consuming but that was expected with a bread recipe. I love that its made with Honey instead of sugar. I think next time I am going to split this recipe into 2 instead of 3 in hopes of making larger loaves that can be used as sandwich bread, the loaves split into 3 make fairly small loaves. Overall I really like it and will definitely make this again! Oh, and I followed the recipe exactly, didn't change a thing! :)

I am a dunce at baking bread but this turned out great!  I did proof the yeast before combining it with the flour and I added a few tablespoons of vital gluten, as well as increasing the percentage of whole wheat flour and adding some 7-grain cereal to the mix.  My only difficulty with this bread was that I should have baked it longer.  I left it in the oven for 35 minutes but it was still a little doughy.  Wonderful taste though and it rose beautifully.  Thanks so much!

Amazing bread. Easy to make. I used this recipe to make bread for the first time and it came out just wonderful. It's slightly sweet,  but you can still toast it and have with eggs or just spread on some butter and enjoy plain.

This is the best loaf of wheat bread I have ever made.  I only made one loaf and froze the other two.  We'll see if they are as perfect as the one just made.  This is definitely a recipe to put in my recipe box.  Thank you!

It is very nice taste at the end. My impression is that it is sweet and although I like it, because of the family and more neutral flavor I use sesame pasta in step 2 instead of honey. Also, I have better results if I leave more time to grow. In step 3 I use 3-4 cups of wholegrain flour. My ideal time for baking is around 32 min.

My kids say this is the best bread they have ever had, and the 3 loaves rarely last longer than 4 days in my house (I have alot of kids though). The first time I made it I had never made bread in my life, and I wanted to use flax meal also.  I subbed 1/2 cup of the whole wheat for flax meal.  I don't think I had enough moisture because my loaves didn't rise well.  Regardless the bread was delicious and got eaten, was just very dense.  The second time I started with 3.5 cups of water and everything turned out perfectly.  I am going to try adding more whole wheat flour and less bread flour over my next several times of making this bread, however want to get bread making down as I have now only made it 2 time in my life!

Incredible, delicious! I did not have honey and used molasses instead. It was perfect, just a hint of sweetness but not cake-like.
Be patient with rising, everyone. It sometimes takes longer than the suggested time to rise, depending on your climate, elevation, etc.

This bread is delicious!  My husband isn't a huge wheat bread fan and he couldn't get enough of it.  The butter on top is a wonderful idea and the sweet and salty flavors balance nicely.  I got 2 loaves out of it, not 3, which is just fine by me.

Five stars even though it isn't truly whole wheat bread.  I followed directions exactly, and it is delicious!  I make bread in the bread machine weekly but this is the first time doing it all by hand and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again!

great recipe! There are only two of us so 3 loaves seemed like too much so I used 1/3 of the dough to make hamburger buns. I just formed balls and flattened on a cookie sheet, let rise like normal and baked for 15-20 minutes and they turned out great!

I have made this bread more than a dozen times now in all types of humidity/temperature conditions.  It is fabulous! Perfect for sandwiches ~ holds up for several days.  I omit the butter on top of the bread, instead opting for a nice crust. 

It is so easy to make ~ I have not purchased "store" sandwich bread in months.

First time bread maker ... and it turned out great :)
Used wholegrain bread flour, little less honey and yeast than called for. And used a dough hook in electric mixer to knead for about 10min before kneading for a minute by hand. Brilliant results, will make again.

This is a great whole wheat sandwich bread! It's pretty sweet, so I might cut down on the honey a little bit next time, but the kids won't leave it alone. The first time I made it, I made three loaves, but this time I made two large loaves, instead of three, because it's easier to eyeball breaking things into equal halves than thirds. These are the most beautiful loaves of sandwich bread I have made! They are a perfect color and shape. I baked them for 30 minutes.

This was simply an amazing bread, and I have made a lot of breads in twenty years. I did make a change---my honey was solidified so I added an egg to make up for lack of liquid  (I have found the solidified honey as a sweetener makes really good bread). I also halved the recipe and mixed in my bread machine because my machine couldn't handle that much flour. I ended up with two loaves (after mixing in machine and let rise for an hour and half I shaped the loaves and let rise for another hour). My boys loved the slices with butter and I made sandwiches with the extra loaf. Great sandwich bread, I have to say! I am thinking would make really good toast also. Will have to make again to try for breakfast toast (; Great texture, held up well slicing. Definitely going into my bread rotation.

This is a good recipe only if you want a sweet bread, otherwise decrease the honey.  I loved it.  Mine rose into lovely big loaves only to deflate when I put down on the counter.  Not sure if that was the fault of anything other than my being too rough.

I've never made REAL bread before today.  I've made sweet breads like pumpkin bread with chocolate chips and such, but never real bread.  I followed the directions to the letter, and it came out beautifully.  I felt so proud - and it was so simple!  A few things I loved:

- The smell of the house as it baked - amazing.
- The look of the golden brown bread when it came out of the oven to cool - amazing.
- The fact that all three of my kids ate more than one piece...the rarely eat anything I make - mostly because it didn't come from McD's, but all three of my kids (ages 2, 4, and 5) all loved this bread.  I know because they ate a lot and they actually said out loud "I love this bread so much!"  Amazing.

I'm a huge fan.

really liked this recipe, but using that much flour, the bread didn't rise correctly and was extremely dense.  using 1 cup less white flour helped the flour to rise properly. also I mixed the yeast into 1-2 cups of 110 degree water first until it was foamy before I added it to my mixer.

PERFECT!  I love love love this recipe.  I have tried several bread recipes, and this trumps them all.  Really easy, really forgiving, and tasty too! I've used sugar instead of honey (when I'm out of honey)and it turns out the same.  I also add 3 Tbl of wheat gluten to get that soft chewy store bought texture so my kids and husband will eat it and prefer it to store bought.  It freezes well, and doesn't dry out the next day like the others have.  Very happy with this recipe, it will be my "go to" homemade bread recipe.

I like more wheat in my bread so aside from making it half white and half wheat, followed this recipe and loved it. I made a whole loaf from half the recipe and monkey bread from the rest and my family loved it.

I have been making my own breads for over a year now. This is our regular everyday bread. It is wonderful! Great for toast,french toast,and pretty much fits the bill for the perfect sandwich bread. I am so grateful to have come across this recipe. I love the fact that it makes three loaves. I keep one on the counter ,and two in the freezer, until we need it.Thank you ,Nita Crabb, for posting this awesome recipe !

I really liked this recipe!  I have been looking for a handmade bread recipe (I like to knead dough!) that would yield a soft but yeasty tasting bread and this is it!  I made three minor adjustments, already recommended by many, adding some vital wheat gluten, about 5 tbsp, olive oil instead of butter and switched up the ratio of white to ww flour, 5 cups of ww and 3 cups of white.  Other than that I followed the directions of the original recipe.  It is very yummy, was an easy to work with dough, it cooperated with two good rises, even though my yeast had to have been not so fresh.

I can see modifying this recipe even further, quite easily, adding flax or chia seeds, etc.  This is a very easy to make, follow and enjoy bread recipe!

You can't just DO this to people, sharing recipes like this. Next thing you know,everyone will be neglecting all of their other responsibilities so they can bake this bread all day. 

I made two regular loaves and then rolled out the third ball of dough, cut it into 10 strips (pizza cutter), rolled each strip up and put them in a round pan. It made an absolutely BEAUTIFUL pan of rolls (and I am very much a bread-making novice).

Tomorrow, I will try this dough recipe with the awesome Clone of a Cinnabon recipe's cinnamon filling and icing ( http://allrecipes.com/recipe/clone-of-a-cinnabon/) and make whole wheat cinnamon rolls.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was fantastic. instead of honey I tried date Syrup and for the flavor I added 1 table spoon of honey. 
The result was awesome. I Brought some slices to work to share with my colleges. They all loved it. 
I advise you to try date syrup too.

This is the best whole wheat bread I've ever tasted.
The recipe looked to be a mistake and I was doubtful it would
even be edible... was I wrong ! 
This is truly additive it's that good. Came out perfect.

I'm a bread making newbie and this bread turned out so well!  I used only whole wheat flour and added vital wheat gluten as others had suggested.  I also used sugar instead of honey because I was running low on honey.  It was delicious and my picky kids went crazy over it!  I can't wait to make this again!

I have made this recipe four times now. My husband and I don't buy store bread anymore! We use agave instead of honey and replace half the water with whey from our homemade yogurt. This bread is delicious and worth the wait. We even use it to make our rolls and buns now.

I love this recipe!  It did not disappoint. The only changes I made were adding a little more salt (only because I am not crazy about sweet bread), and making it more healthy by adding more whole wheat with bran than white flour. It turned out perfectly!

Great recipe! Have made it 3 times. Very delicious, soft and light compared to most wheat breads. Even messed it up once, by forgetting to allow it to rise in the pan, and it still produced a tasty (though much denser) bread.  Love the fact that it makes 3 loaves, plenty to share with family and neighbors, or freeze for later. Delicious and simple. Can't go wrong, so long as your ingredients (such as yeast) are fresh. Have another batch in process right now.... Yum!

Easy and delicious! I made two loaves instead of three so they would be a bit larger. I have also served it with honey butter.

Made this with oil in place of the butter, ended up using  about 3c wheat flour, mixed by hand. This turned out delish! I did under bake mine just a little too much and so it was much better as toast, which was my fault not the recipe. Mine looked just like the picture. Moist, soft and delish!

This recipe made 3 loaves.  I made the bread over Christmas and had people asking me for the recipe!  I've never had homemade bread before and thought this was the best tasting bread.

This looks really good and easy, I was just wondering how well it freezes before making it? My husband and I won't go through three loaves of bread that fast but I hate buying bread! Would it be better to freeze when the dough has risen but not baked yet or freeze after baking? 
If anybody could help that'd be great! Thanks
Looking forward to trying this!

I tried it once so far and it turned out great my family loved it.I am in the process of making it again and am making it a double batch. I am going to change it a bit, I heated the water with a cinnamon stick to give it a bit of flavor, it how my dad likes his bread. I am also adding a little grated cinnamon. I will update later on how it came out.

My whole family loved this. We've been looking for a good bread to use for sandwiches, and I'm not buying commercially made bread any more if I can help it. I made two loaves instead of three, and they came out perfectly. I'm looking forward to trying some of the variations other people have suggested, like using molasses instead of honey.

I love this bread! Although I do  cut back on the honey! USUALLY, I make half the recipe in my bread maker on the dough setting, form into 18 rolls, let rise and then bake! YUMMY

This is my 3rd batch of bread I have made in the past week, and I never made bread before that, and I think I like this one the best so far.  When I went to buy the whole wheat flour, I wasn't sure if I needed WW BREAD flour, or just regular WW Flour.  To be on the safe side I bought the WW bread flour.  Once I got home and started to get all the ingredients together I realized that the WW bread flour was a mix of white and whole wheat.  So after adding 5 cups of bread flour, I think my bread is more white than brown.  Either way, it turned out fantastic and I ended up with 3 nice sized loaves.  After reading the reviews I was expecting to only make 2, but there way way too much dough to make just 2.  It turned out really moist with great flavour.  I'm looking for a bread recipe as a replacement for store bought, and so far the ones I have tried have turned out well and taste great, but have not been able to hold up to sandwich quality without falling apart.  I let my dough rise too long so it ended up a little 'holier', so I'm expecting it might not work well for sandwiches.  But I am looking forward to trying this one again, with WW flour and less rising time.

Biggest problem is I can't stop eating it!  I did 3 cups of regular flour and 2 wheat flour for the first part of the recipe and then the 3 1/2 cups of wheat that is called for in the 2nd part.  I made mine into 2 loaves as others suggested....my larger of the 2 loaves ended a bit doughy in the center (I actually LOVE the doughy-ness :)  )  But if I'd have followed directions and used 3 loaf pans I think the 25 mins baking time would have been perfect!

Used sugar instead of honey and divided into 2 loafs instead of 3 - worked out great, especially to make bigger bread that's great to make sandwiches with.  I put butter on top of the loaves after pulling it out of the oven and it has kept the crust soft like sandwich bread normally would be.  Yum~

Awesome recipe! Whole wheat bread has earned a reputation of being dry and bitter, but this one is moist and flavorful with a pleasant amount of sweetness. I bake large amounts of bread and this one works great every time.

I just tasted my first slice of this bread.  It's nice and soft--not dry at all.  But taste-wise, it is far too sweet.  In the future, I would omit the second dose of honey, or at least decrease the amount significantly.

This is the best bread I've ever baked!  Make sure to follow the instructions to a T and you'll be fine.  Although other people have tried other variations with success (i.e. more wheat to white flour ratio) so go ahead and experiment if you are more experienced at baking.

First time bread maker here and knocked this out last night. The family loves it, my DD and I both made lunch sandwiches with it and its the perfect texture. Holds together well. The whole process took longer than I expected being a rookie and being the "Grill Master" not the "Baker" in the house but so very worth it. I appreciate the review from @MommyFromSeattle as I used our new KitchenAid and it worked great (pretty sure the only reason I made bread was to use the new toy but i'm hooked now).

We have a little one here who can't have honey, so I switched out the honey for: 3tbls of brown rice syrup in yeast mixture while it proofs. Then 2.5tbs sugar into the bread mixture. The yeast still becomes wonderfully foamy, and the bread is delicious and sweet! (I make 2 loaves instead of 3. If you use the full recipe, you should sub in more rice syrup and sugar.)

First time making this and my family LOVES it!! I brushed mine with butter during the last 10 mintues and sprinkled with oats. I added less salt as suggested be others but next time I think I'll add the 1 tbls as in the recipe. Made 2 large loaves and 4 knot rolls. Me and my husband ate all the rolls when they came out of the oven, wonderful flavor!!

This is a great recipe for a first timer, but I still found that the yeast was a little too much. I changed it a bit and it came out great. One of these days I'll write it down. Otherwise, it's great!

Amazing. I've never had better bread. I used local honey, and it was extraordinary.  Easy, too- I hadn't made bread in decades and it was perfect!

Have made this recipe twice now and used my kitchen aid with it. Does great! I add 2tbsp of sunflower kernels and 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats to the mix. And I only make half the recipe at a time. We've decided to no longer buy store bread, we'd rather know what's in our food and how its made if we can. PLUS it tastes awesome, texture is great and the house smells wonderful when its baking!

A very easy recipe that produces great results! We've been making it for about three weeks now. We make two larger loaves instead of three and freeze the second for later in the week. We've started replacing some of the bread flour for other varieties to add a bit more depth of flavor. Great recipe.

Tastes great, and is a great sandwhich bread. I ended up using more whole wheat flour the 2nd time instead of more bread flour. It didn't rise as much, but cut beautifully and still tastes great. I ended up doing all the wet ingredients first, let it proof, then added all the flour, then let it rise for an hour.

I've made this recipe several times, it's always excellent. Even the time I accidentally set the oven to 100 degrees hotter than it was supposed to be and ended up with burnt crust and mushy inside, it still tasted delicious. I only have 1 loaf pan so I always cut it in thirds but it's still great!

This is the best wheat bread I have made to date. I have even made the sponge (step 1) the night before and refrigerated it until morning with good results. Very Soft and stays soft for many days. Thanks for the recipe.

I normally don't review recipes, but this one I have to.  It is SO good! I have been looking for a recipe for sandwich bread for my family and I think this is it! My kids won't eat most of the recipes I've tried and my husband and I are left with lots of bread to eat! My kids are begging me for more of this one! And I used all white whole wheat flour since we only use whole wheats.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggestions!  Thank you for sharing!!

This was my first time making bread. 

I accidentally put in five cups of whole wheat bread flour instead of the white bread flour. So instead of putting in more whole wheat flour where it asks for 3 1/2 cups, I used white all-purpose flour. I thought, oh well, another one bites the dust. I put it in the oven anyway. 

And guess what? It turned out! I'm actually kind of surprised. My food never turns out right the first time--ask my husband. So, I am writing a review to say thank you Nita Crabb. It worked for me.

I like the recipe, it's easier for a beginner (and poor bread maker) like me, lol. I would prefer a sweeter bread, but that's just me. I might double the honey next time and see what happens.

This makes a beautiful and lovely tasting bread with a very nice texture and consistency. I am a first time bread baker and this recipe was perfect. I did not sub anything out and followed the recipe precisely. I will probably not be buying store bought bread again. My husband and 5 children and I have eaten a loaf per day since I started making this bread. 7 thumbs up from my household.

Let me say this first that I am a newbie and this was my 2nd attempt to make bread. 

Wonderful bread. Made two loves and froze the third one. 
I followed the exact recipe but felt like the bread was a little moist inside the crust. Why is that?

this bread recipe does not need my review. It stands  alone in a sea of bread recipes. I used agave nectar, since I don't really get along well with honey, and added cinnamon and raisins to one loaf. The cinnamon raisin loaf didn't rise as much as the other two did, but it still looks remarkable! I will never buy store bought bread again.

Nita, you hit this one out of the park. Made exactly as directed. So so easy to make, and it came out perfectly. I made one loaf, eight sandwich rolls, and two batches of cinnamon rolls from this recipe. Now I can't stop eating or baking bread. Can't wait to try variations.
Second time I did try one reviewers quick rise technique of turning the oven on and then off, then putting the dough in. I was really pleased with the results.

Breadmaker from start to finish & absolutely beautiful & tasty. Hearty, yet light & fluffy with the following additions. 1/3 recipe made a 1-1/2# loaf. Added everything in order (water temp was hot tub warm, maybe 98F. Wasn't precise on measurements but used as a guide. Changes: added SALT before the flour, also added on top everything: 1T (1/3 recipe) vital wheat gluten, 1T ground flax seeds, 1T poppy seeds, 2T chia seeds after adding them to 1/2 C hot water & letting them set for 5 min which makes them turn into a gel. In the early part of the 2nd rise, I topped the unrisen loaf w/ more poppy seeds, some oats & some toasted white sesame seeds.

Made this exactly according to the recipe (except I let the dough rise extra long because I ran to the store) and it was SOOO good! I ate almost an entire loaf in one day! Will definitely make again and again and again!

I've never made bread before, but my bread turned out PERFECT. My family and I loved the flavour. Because I didn't have bread pans, I used old round pots that didn't have the normal thick bottom, so I only cooked them for 25mins. When I placed them in the thicker bottomed pots, it took longer to cook, but the top of the bread turned dark brown, so I switched to the thin bottom ones. Thank you Nita for this EASY and delicious recipe.

this was my first time making bread and this recipe saw me through! it came out fluffy, moist, and even the crust was soft and not crispy! i took the advice of some below and turned the oven to 350 deg. F for 1 min, turned it off, and placed the dough (already in the greased bread pan) to rise. it rose in about 1 hour = perfect because i'm impatient.

i added a scoop (1/4 cup) wheat germ and a scoop of soy lecithin (i would say about 1/8 cup).

aside from that small variation, i made it exactly like the recipe and it was PERFECT. everyone loved it! i'm going to give one of the three loaves to a neighbor!

Absolutely delicious! I used 3.5 cups of whole wheat flour (in addition to the white) and used a bread dough hook to knead for 10 minutes. Next time I will eliminate the butter brushed on top; it doesn't really need it.

I make the 3 loaves every other week (freezing 2 the dough loaves to bake later.) I found them a little to honey flavored for my family so instead of adding the second 1/3 cup of honey I add a table spoon of sugar. That works out well for me and my boys! But over all great recipe, great flavors and I will keep making it!

I follow the advice of another reviewer and switched the honey for sugar and on my second rise, the breads only rose halfway to the bread pans.
Will try the recipe as is and update my review in consequence.

This is only my third time working with yeast dough, and I have to say that this bread came out very well. 

My only complaint is that it's for three loaves, and the websites "servings" calculator makes for very awkward measuring. Three loaves is way too much bread for me to make at once and I'm not really into freezing things.

Yep! This is a great recipe. I proof the yeast in the water and honey for a few minutes before i add the flour. The only other change is I put olive oil on top instead of butter when it is done.

ok, so this was my first time making bread, and it tasted ok, but there were a few errors on my part that made this bread less than amazing.... i found myself out of honey and used sugar instead, not taking into account that honey would probably make it less dry, as it is a liquidy ingredient. i also bought the wrong size pans and so i only had 2 really big loaves that ended up being almost raw in the middle. i plan on trying this again in the near future because, like i said, the errors were entirely my fault and the bread that i tried tasted pretty good :)

This is recipe is wonderful and adaptable.  I reduce bread flour by 1 cup and add a cup of grains & nuts to the sponge.  Also add molasses instead of a second measure of honey.  Its a great addition to the freezer and keeps really well if well wrapped, and has the best flavor of any wheat bread I've made.  Thanks!

I've been making bread for some months now and a good whole wheat bread has always been a challenge. This is by far the best recipe for whole wheat bread. Thx a lot for the recipe!The texture and taste was excellent and my hubby loved it!:) I cut down the ingredients to make a loaf and made adjustments to the recipe to include more whole wheat.

If my anti-any-amount-of-whole-wheat-flour-in-my-bread hubby loves this recipe its a keeper!  Wonderful bread!  I swapped out 1/2 of the white flour for additional whole wheat and 1 cup of ground flax.

This is the first time I've ever made bread and it came out perfectly!  It made 3 beautiful loaves and it tastes great.  I'll definitely make this again.  I'm looking forward to trying out other bread recipes also.

first time making bread... and it TURNED OUT!!  turned out! heehee!  i now have three gorgeous loaves of wheat bread.  do you know how good that feels to give this to my kids!  can't wait to try the cinnamon rolls version!  the taste is really nice too.  i used a little less honey than called for simply because i don't like bread too sweet.  so good!

Excellent and easy. This bread makes GREAT toast! I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil/butter, and cut in half both of the honey additions. Perfect!

This bread is wonderful! I grind my own wheat and used it only, no white flour, the texture and taste were wonderful! I did cut down on the honey a bit. I don't like sweet bread.

So easy and tasty! This is the first bread I have made and it turned out perfect! I followed the first reviewers advice for the kitchen aide mixer. I also changed it by only using whole wheat all purpose flour and it still came out perfect! Will not be purchasing bread any longer because this is simple and easy!

This bread is easy and delicious! I am NOT a regular bread maker and I decided I wanted to give it a shot. With this recipe, I will probably be making my own bread from now on. Since I have pulled it out of the oven, I can't stop cutting off little pieces and nibbling. I only made half the recipe...I should have made the whole thing!

So far the bread turned out ok but I have been unable to get it to rise enough that it bakes correctly. The bread is always VERY dense and also very short.

Im so glad I found a whole wheat bread or any bread recipe for that matter,that is baked in an oven instead of a dang bread machine.I wanted a recipe so I could learn to make my bread the right way.
I love this recipe.I changed the bread flour to  Kamut flour.
I used agave nectar instead of honey(lower glycemic index)
I used just a pinch of sea salt.
added a little ground flax seed.
and some raw turbinado sugar.
tiny bit of lemon juice.
thank-you for the recipe!

This was a great, simple bread. I only gave it four stars because we left out the second helping of honey as others recommended, and it was plenty sweet. Plus, the second rising was VERY delicate. I felt like it was going to fall at any moment, and the top ended up "dented" because it did fall a bit when I placed in the oven. Good basic recipe. I froze 2 of the loaves (like another poster recommended) so we will see how that turns out.

This is easy to make and it tastes better than anything you buy in a store.  I like to substitute 1/4 c. whole wheat flour for 1/4 c. wheat germ for added nutrition.  My husband and kids love it!

This recipe was perfect, the only thing I changed was I used applesauce and agave syrup instead of honey (i'm vegan). It came out excellent! very light and moist. I am usually leary of wholewheat recipes as they tend to be "heavy" and grainy" this is my new go to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

WOW! By far the best bread I have ever made or ate. It has a great taste the whole family loves. I made it exactally like the recipe said to and it turned out great. can't wait to make it again in a few days. We can't get fresh bread at any store here so making bread is what I decided to do when I tried this recipe, a great recipe for a "newbie" easy, simple, and very yummy!

This was my 2nd try at making bread and my first success.  This is an easy recipe and very tasty.  I used 100% whole wheat flour (bobs red mill).  The package states "superb for bread baking".  I think this made it more dense than if I had used a mix of white and wheat. But, I wanted healthy and I love the texture - especially toasted.  It's a nice hearty sweet bread.

Yes...indeed the best! I'm not going to try any others for a very long time. I think I'll just stop at this one. Very forgiving recipe too. I didn't exactly measure the ingredients, just put them all into my bread machine and hit go! Perfect!!! Delicious!!!

Makes great sandwich rolls. I cut in half and used the 2 and 2 for the flour, as others suggested, but I'll probably use 1/3 cup less wheat and 1/3 cup more white flour next time, which will also be truer to the recipe.

this recipe for whole wheat bread is the best. I have made white bread and now wanted to upgrade to whole wheat...so, tried this recipe today. My whole wheat bread turned out better than white bread. However I found this bread a bit sweet...next time I might reduce the honey content. Overall this is the best recipe for bread baking beginners like me...I also liked this site so much that I have become a member today. Thanks all recipes for such a great website with great recipes.

This bread is amazing. As always I tweaked the recipe to fit the ingredients on hand (a mixture of 3 types of flour) and added more honey.  I've made loads of bread but this was the best recipe yet.  Adding the melted butter before the kneading and second rise, as well as brushing the loaves with butter out of the oven were perfect additions. As there was so much dough, I made a free form loaf for slicing, cinnamon rolls (delicious!) and burger buns. All were a hit!

I added two eggs, to give it a good fluff and added protein, and then I shaved in fresh nutmeg, and some pumpkin pie spice, just for a little character.  I also used less of the bread flour and more whole wheat flour.  However, I feel it does need some bread flour for smoothness.

I made this bread today and had trouble stop myself from eating it all up. I halved the recipe and used two loaf pans of size 8.5x4.5. My loafs are smaller than the regular sandwich bread, but who cares about the size and/or shape when the bread tastes so good! I made it by hand and didn't measure the exact amount of whole wheat flour I added. I was a little nervous about reaching the right 'stickiness', but I do believe the other review was right that this is a very forgiving recipe. Definitely a keeper and will be one of the recipes I keep using. BTW I just started to do homemade bread, by hand, not long ago and will consider myself novice-intermediate baker. So if I can do it, you can too!

Love this recipe!  Was able to make 2 loaves of pepperoni bread and 1 loaf of cinnamon swirl bread.  Very moist and soft with a chewy texture.  Everyone loved it!

I am never buying bread from the store ever again!  This bread is amazing!  The loaves freeze extremely well too (wrap in foil, then freezer bag)!  I only needed 3 cups of the whole wheat flour to get to the consistency described in the recipe.  So delicious!!

even though I accidently shorted one of the ingrediants (corrected it later in the process and just moved forward praying it would work out) the bread came out fabulous! My family loves it... thanks for sharing!

This was my first loaf bread recipe to try and it was easy and fun to make. My kids have since helped to make their own loaves. It makes the best toast in the world and smells so good baking. I have made 5 loaves so far without a problem. Very good!!!

Fantastic bread!  The whole family loved it.  I did not add salt at all and it was not missed.  The loaves turned out perfectly.  They did stick a little to 2 of my pans but that is not the fault of the recipe.  It is the fault of the baker!  Should have oiled the pans a little better.  I used all whole wheat flour and they were great!  Thank you!!!

I've been baking white bread for years and this was my first whole wheat bread. Purrrfect! I did take 2/3 of the water amount and replaced with milk leaving only a 1/3 for water instead of using all water. I also took all the liquids and mixed them together and both flours I blended together with salt. I will be using this recipe over and over again.

This was our first attempt at wheat bread, and the other reviews are right...this recipe is awesome.  We followed other's suggestions and reduced servings to 24 and only cut back a tad on the honey.  It would have been delicious either way, we just wanted something less sweet.  Great recipe; easy!

The was the first load of bread I ever made. It was so simple and came out perfect. Only places I had trouble was I couldn't get the load out very easy. I had to take a knife to the edge. I also kept watching for the part that the dough got big and bubbly. I think that that description was misleading because it didn't look bubbly and I thought I messed it up.  It became like mousse but there weren't clear bubbles. I guess and experienced baker would know that, but as a newby I was concerned.

this recipe tastes really good and is simple to put together.  However, the two times that I have made it, the loaves have stuck to the pans!  I'm not sure what I am doing wrong!  One pan is even a stoneware bread pan, and it still sticks!  Other than that, it is a good recipe.

My husband loves this bread!   The first time I made it, it took forever to rise, and still didn't rise all the way, but it still turned out delicious. The next time I made it though I just anticipated on a long rise time. I also used the hint of sticking it in the oven with the light on and it worked so much better!

This bread tastes SO good! I can't stop eating it warmed up with butter. I think I need to work on my rise times because the dough fell when I put it in the oven & it didn't end up rising very high. It didn't matter though, it was still ridiculously good. I'll definitely be making this again.

This bread is absolutely amazing!!!!  Soft, flavorful...oh man.  Good stuff!  I used my KitchenAid with dough hook to knead until it was still sticky but not sticking to the sides of the bowl, and it worked GREAT!  I can't make this too often or I'll really be putting on the pounds!

Excellent base recipe! I add sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, flax and oatmeal to make a yummy, hearty sandwich loaf. My only actual substitution is canola oil for the butter because of dairy allergies.

This turned out very well, even though I ran out of honey and had to substitute half of it for regular sugar.  I also used olive oil instead of melted butter (because melting butter is so messy.)  But it turned out quite tasty!

This was only the 7th loaf of bread I have attempted to make, ever.  They have all turned out okay, but this was the best, and so quick and easy.  Living at altitude(a mile high), I have always been hesitant to try.  However, I followed the directions given with no problems.  I did bake 2 9x5 glass loaf pans on convection at 350 for 30 min.  This is my go to recipe from now on.

This was the first time I ever made bread from scratch....and I was a little nervous before I began.  But this recipe put all my fears to rest.  The bread turned out wonderful.  It gave me the confidence to try other homemade bread recipes!  Thank you Nita!!!

I was always afraid to make bread - seemed like so much work and alot of time and then it never turned out... until I met this wonderful recipe!!! It is fool proof, even for me. And I can't forget to mention the lovely taste and texture. It came out of the oven golden on the top. It is a beautiful bread. I just love it! My husband and infant son lapped it up with some butter and jam. This is my new Bread recipe. Gonna try making it with cinnamon & raisins since I love it so much, why not try a variation? Thank you for posting this recipe and sharing it with all of us!

I found this recipe about a month ago, and it was the very first time I have ever made bread. I can't be thankful enough that I stumbled upon it! Not only was it easy, but a HUGE hit with my family and friends!! It was so tasty, even my white bread only father loves it. I substitute the second 1/3 cup of honey with about half the amount of white sugar, just to keep the sweetness subtle.  I currently have some loaves in the oven at this moment, and can't wait to nibble on them!

I am a novice bread maker. This recipie was my second attempt and it was wonderful. The recipie was easy to follow and yeilded 3 loafs. I love the idea of using honey in place of granulated sugar. This makes a wonderfu all purpose bread. It's great to snack on, use for sandwiches and even toasted. YUM!!!

Aaaah-mazing!!  I've made bread maybe 6 times, and this is by far the best one yet!  I made this recipe into two giant loaves, big enough for a hearty sandwich and baked them for exactly 25 minutes, brushed them with butter, and it's to die for.  The wheat adds just the perfect texture to it, a slight crunch that adds so much to it.  This will absolutely be my go-to recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and actually got 3 loaves from it (I think my bread pans are smaller).  It was devine!  My husband and all 3 kids loved it.  Our 2 year old was actually singing about how he loved his toast the next morning.  Definitely a "keeper" of a recipe.

I've never commented on a recipe. However, as a first time bread-tryer, I felt compelled. We were blown away by this bread! No need for a mixer, no eggs and just the softest bestest tastiest bread I've ever had!! I will do more whole wheat next time, I think for the health benefits... this is my favorite bread ever!!

I attempted to reduce this recipe for only two loves but my math sucks and my dough came out extremly dry.  I like the idea of freezing the extra, but I'm lazy and use my kitchen aid.  The problem is it is the small one and can not handle this much dough.

Best wheat bread I've made. Nice and fluffy. I actually use sugar instead of honey and a bit more white flour than wheat. This bread comes out nice and fluffy, not hard as a brick like all my other wheat breads.

I make this bread using my bread machine. Let me start by saying I converted the recipe to make only one loaf. I follow step 1 using my bread machine pan. After adding the ingredients listed in step 2 I turn on the machine using the dough cycle. After the dough has doubled I take it out of the machine and transfer it to a greased 9x5 baking pan. From then on I follow the recipe exactly as listed. This is my son's favorite bread. Thank you for a recipe that I can feel good about making and serving my family.

Great recipe!  This is my first ever time attempting to make bread and this turned out great!  I don't think I kneaded it long enough and let it rise too long in the pan and it still turned out yummy.  I will make it again.

I found this recipe in the search for a great whole wheat sandwich bread.  After reading the reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I was right!  This bread was a hit, the family and I loved it.  Perfect texture and taste.

My housemate made this bread, and I fell in love.  I decided to make it myself, to see if it would come out just as well, and it was flawless.  I do not usually like whole wheat bread.  The honey and mixture of the two flours makes this recipe a winner. I made this exactly as directed.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I was shocked about was that is yields three loaves? I have been baking bread for a long time and this one only made two loaves for me. I use the Pampered Chef Stoneware Loaf pans, and when I make bread I want the slices to be large enough to use for sandwiches. This made two nice sized loaves, but I couldn't ever see getting three out of it? Otherwise, it's wonderful!

Great recipe. Made a few adjustment for the bread machine but the recipe still worked well when I cut the ingredients by a third. Added a few tablespoons of wheat germ for added texture

This was my first attempt at bread making and even though my kneading was far from perfect, the bread came out wonderfully!  This is way better than any store-bought loaf!  Excellent recipe!

I make this in the bread maker on the dough cycle (cut the recipe in half for one big loaf),Use half whole wheat-half bread flour and the rest I add oats. After letting rise, I bake in oven as suggested. Everyone loves...actually getting ready to make another loaf now!!

Great bread. Very moist. Made this for a potluck and had spinach dip for topping. YUm. It was a hit. I made it with maple syrup instead of honey and it was GREAT! I will be making this again.

FINALLY! A homemade bread recipe that didn't turn out like a rock.  Living at a higher elevation I thought that was my problem with bread dough rising, however someone here suggested adding gluten so I did and it worked.  I made 4 loaves this weekend and will make this my regular bread recipe from here on out.

I've never made bread before, and thought I'd give ita soht this weekend. This bread was super easy, the instructions were clear and concise, and easy to scale. I only made one loaf thinking it would last a week, but it barely made it through the day. I'm definitley going to be making this again, and will make the full recipe next time.

This was my first attempt at baking bread (have always use my bread machine before) and I was very pleased with the results.  I followed the recipe exactly and the bread came out beautifully.  For my second batch I used just two, one-fourth cups of honey and it still turned out great.  I went to youtube to find a video on how to shape the bread dough and was surprised how easy it was.  Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was so incredibly yummy. I have never made bread before, so I was a little scared because I have heard making bread is hard. The instructions were so easy to follow and it turned out fantastic. I split my dough in two to make sandwich sized bread. I will definitely be making this bread all the time.

Finally - I made a soft bread. It came out perfectly! Definately a bread that should be eaten in 2-3 days. It gets dense and stale quickly. a good bread for those who like the doughy texture.  Two thumbs up!!

amazing bread!  I made the dough in my bread maker (cut down the recipe to 24 serving) and then let the bread rise for 40 mins in their respective pans.  I cooked the breads for 25 mins.  I can't believe how good they are.  This is now my go to bread!

Very good recipe, the bread stayed soft and the dough freezes well. I had to cook for 35 minutes rather than the recommended time.

There is nothing like home-made bread! This one turned out perfect, takes a LONG time to rise but it is worth the wait. I can't wait to make a sandwich with this bread for work tomorrow, this one's going in my recipe binder.

This is a great recipe. I have never baked bread before, and I have hard it is difficult, especially without the use of a bread machine. Since it was my first attempt, I wanted to make only one loaf. So I cut the recipe accordingly and followed it, except for subbing sugar for honey. I didn't have honey in my pantry. After reading some of the other reviews, I also decided to add some whole flaxseeds. It turned out perfect. Thank you. I can not go back to store bought bread now. Again, thank you for this wonderful and simple recipe.

I tried this bread and I didn't have any honey so I substituted regula sugar where it called for honey.  The bread turned out wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Also instead of two loaves I used this recipe and just made one very large loaf with my wilton loaf pan it is about 15 inches long.  It made a loaf like the loaves in the stores.  PERFECT

Very soft and flavorful with wholesome,healthy ingredients.  Mine came out a little too dense for a good sandwich, but great for eating fresh or toasting with butter or jam.  I am new to bread making, but the directions were perfect.  Thanks Nita!

This is delicious. I divide by 3 and make a single loaf by mixing, kneading and knocking down the dough in my bread machine. It turns out great!

I used white bread flour and whole wheat bread flour. Good texture, and rose very well. Too bad I overbaked it by 2mins... must watch more closely next time!

Wow. The absolute best bread I have ever made. I made two large loaves and we just ate one of them! Fantastic. Will make this over and over again. Followed recipe exactly but used Rapid Rise Yeast instead since that is all I had at home. Thanks for sharing!

My first real attempt at homemade bread and it was very good!  I subbed sugar for the first 1/3 cup of honey since I didn't have enough.  I split into 2 big loaves instead of 3 smaller ones.  Bread came out pretty dense, but I like it that way.  Perfect for French Toast tomorrow morning! :-)

This came out wonderfully.  I reduced the honey and about halved the second calling for honey.  I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and 3 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten.  I did use King Arthur bread flour (I originally was going to use plain all purpose flour, but decided not to).  I ended up added maybe 1.5 - 2 additional cups of whole wheat flour.  I think next time I will make three loaves, or remove some from the dough ball and do little buns or something.  I used two loaf pans and they got so huge, it looked like giant mushroom slices.  The rise got so big that once it was cooked and cooled down, the sides dragged down a little--it was probably four to five inches higher than the loaf pan.  I took the advice and heated up my oven, let it cool down a little and left the light on and then put the bowl in for the first rise covered with a damp paper towel.  About an hour later, I punched it down and put it in the loaf pans and since the oven was still warm, I didn't have to reheat it and put the loaves in there to rise again for about another hour.  I used olive oil to brush the tops and it is so so good with a subtle chewy texture and moist.  You don't even need to butter them up to make them taste good! Just eat them plain and you will be quite satisfied.  This is my fourth time making bread, the first three times came from a different recipe - 1 came out dense, 2nd I left too long to rise and it had a bad taste from the yeast, and third it was okay, but did not t

Followed the recipe, and my loaves weren't very tall, then I read a review that said if you expect the shape of store bread, then only use two loaf pans, so I think I will try again with only two - still, flavor was great!

I decided to make this recipe based on the one negative, one-star review I saw of it. The writer said it was too dense and chewy, which is exactly what I want in a homemade bread. Loved how this recipe turned out. I used different quantities of white vs whole wheat flour and added some ground flax seed because...well, I wanted to. I also had several long, unscheduled interruptions to the process thanks to my small children, but it proofed perfectly anyway, and the final product is delicious. It does have a somewhat dense, chewy texture, but not overly so. It's perfect for sandwiches and toast. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for bread from now on. If you want to make changes to the types of flour/dry indgr, go for it; just follow the directions for what the dough should be like (slightly sticky) and the end product should be fine.

Whenever I have made homemade bread in the past it never turned out. I wanted to try something again and this came out perfectly! I loved it and it has great flavor. I think next time though I might increase the amount of honey. I have a sweet tooth.

I've always wanted to bake my own bread, but was pretty intimidated. I choose this recipe as my first because it was to easy to follow. I am so glad I did! It really was simple to make, and it came out really well. I will absolutely make it again, and I have confidence to try other recipes.

No fail recipe!! I make this bread all the time for myself and family but I also have made it for friends (who LOVE it) and I made a few loafs for a bake sale and people came up to me days later and said it was some of the best whole wheat bread they have ever had. TRY IT, you'll be so glad you did.

Yummy, this is my first SUCCESSFUL whole wheat loaf! I made ONE loaf (12 servings) following the recipe closely but I substituted 2% milk for butter in step 2, used an 8"x4" loaf pan, and greased the pan with olive oil. About 5 minutes before baking, I sprayed inside of the oven with water to create steam. It tastes wonderful!

I made this bread today! It was so good and easy. I never thought I could actually make my own loaves of bread! I will definitely be making this every couple of weeks. I substituted sugar for the honey (that is what I had on hand) and took the tip from previous posters about turning on your oven for 1 minute, turning it off and then putting the dough to rise. It worked perfect! Thanks!

I love this recipe.  The bread came out moist and with great flavor.  The only change I made was in the flour ratio.  I made the first batch half bread flour and half whole wheat. I used my mixer and made rolls instead of loaves.  Next batch will be more whole wheat and added goodies like sunflower seeds and fruit.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent bread! This was my first time ever making bread. I do not have a kitchen aid or bread machine and felt like I had to be messing up the recipe, but it was delicious. I followed the directions to the letter (except I used mostly whole wheat flour). Definitely a great bread for a newbie like myself. Very moist! Thank you!

After looking at a few recipes this morning I decided to try this one. I AM SOLD!!!! Don't look any further - THIS IS THE BEST BREAD RECIPE! I used all whole wheat flour after reading some of the other reviews and it turned out so well. I made 2 loaves and 8 rolls. I sure won't be buying store bought bread anymore! Like other reviewers I sure wish I could give it more stars!!!! Perfect texture, flavor and SO easy to make!!!!

WONDERFUL! My family ate all four loaves in two days.  It has a slight sweet taste which can curb a craving for sweets.

I'm new at this bread making thing and this is by far the best Whole Wheat Bread recipe I have tried.  Very easy, and the whole family loves it.  In my son's words "DELISH".

I cut the recipe by 1/3 and wow, I must say this was awesome.  This is the first time I have tried cooking with whole wheat flour and the first time and every time since has turned out perfect.  Great taste, and texture, easy to make. My family loved it too!  Tastes way better than store bought wheat bread!

I'm a novice when it comes to bread baking.  The flavor of this bread is delicious without any modifications to the recipe.  I did end up with a flatter, denser loaf than your usual loaf of any kind of bread.  But I had no loaf pan, so that was probably it.  Great recipe!

This recipe was my first attempt ever to make a "real" bread. It was FANTASTIC!!!! Seriously, I followed the directions and came out with 3 beautiful and tasty loaves of wheat bread. I've read a lot of the reviews and will change the wheat to bread flour ratio in favor of wheat flour and probably add some sunflower seeds. Even without any changes, this was a beautiful, perfect and very flavorful bread and I'm SO happy I discovered this recipe.

I give this five stars because it tastes really good. However, this cannot be called  "Whole Wheat" because it is not when you use 5 cups of white bread flour. I added about 5 tsp of granulated lecithin and it gives it a wonderful texture. Next time I will dramatically reduce the amount of white flour and try to stick to more whole wheat flour. The whole family loved this.

Wonderful, and easy to make. It makes the most delightful toast, or just slice and eat with or without butter. With the second raising, I set the loafs in the microwave, and the raise quickly with a nice warm temp, and no drafts. Vicki

Great!  Was a little leary after hearing how hard it was to make a good, soft wheat bread, but this was excellent.  I even lowered the wheat to bread flour quite a bit, next time I think I will try it 100% wheat.  No fail recipe.

This was a very clear, straightforward recipe.  I enjoyed making the bread - even kneading it by hand.  I was short on ingredients (no bread flour and only 2 c wheat flour), but I really needed some bread, so I halved the recipe and made one single 9x5 loaf.  I substituted white sugar for the first round of honey.  It was perfectly baked in 25 minutes.  Husband and I enjoyed the bread with soup tonight.  It was fabulous.  I will definitely make this recipe again--with bread flour next time.

This was the first receipe I used to make bread and it was wonderful.  The texture and taste were great.  I started only with one loaf to test and now I always make more.  I also used the same recipe to make rolls and braided bread.  Thank you!

Admittedly, I did not follow the directions for this bread because I am already set in my breadmaking ways.  I proofed the yeast and honey and then added the ingredients with the flour being last. Everything worked out well :D. I added about 1/2 cup of a mixture of sesame seeds, golden flax seeds, and wheat germ before the flour also. I also scaled this recipe down for 2 loaves. I will definitely make this recipe again. The bread stayed soft in a bag for several days. I just used it for french toast  (Fluffy French Toast) and it turned out rather well :).

Oh my, this is GREAT! I have never made homemade bread before. I do NOT have a stand mixer so I did everything by hand and this bread was so EASY and PERFECT. The only thing I will change the next time I make this will be to replace some of the white bread flour with whole wheat flour. Thanks for this Simple Whole Wheat Bread recipe!!

Fantastic! I have tried many times to make sandwich bread and time and time again I end up with a dense, flavorless loaf. That is not the case with this recipe. This bread is slightly sweet,moist and airy. My kids, ages 4 and 2 love it! Thank you for the best whole wheat bread ever.

I cut this recipe in half to make one loaf just to try it out. Because the instructions aren't recalculated like the ingredients section is, I accidentally put *3* tablespoons of butter in the dough instead of 1, but it turned out fine. I also added gluten and substituted maple syrup for the honey. Absolutely gorgeous loaf of bread! This will be my weekly recipe.

This bread is SOOOOO good!  My husband compared it to Outback's bread they bring you before the meal!  (and he's really picky!)  Buttering the top gave it enough 'butter flavor' that we didn't even need to butter the individual pieces.

It does make a lot of dough!  I made 2 loaves of bread and cinnamon rolls out of what would have been the third loaf.  They were good, but almost too sweet.  (the dough itself is pretty sweet, then adding the 'smear' and then the icing-sweet tooth addicts' dream!)

I should mention that before this, I've only tried making bread two times- and neither time did it turn out.  So the fact that this turned out AND it tasted good...  It's gotta be a good recipe!  :)

This truly is a spectacular recipe! I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the "healthy" bread in the store ($3/loaf X 2 a week = this recipe is WAY cheaper!)... anyhow it is wonderful, healthy, easy and oh so delicious toasted with butter!

Very, very good. I found it too sweet for my taste, but it's a good enough recipe that I will continue to experiment with other grains and less sweeteners. I can recommend not to use an airbake pan for this, unless someone knows how to adjust the temp and time. It was easy; my kids helped and I used the Kitchenaid for kneading (speed 2 until it pulled away from the bowl but was still sticky).

Great bread. Nice texture -- I was in a hurry and didn't knead it much, and it still rose well and had a tight, but soft crumb. Golden soft crust (brushed top with the suggested butter).

The recipe covered all the topics I needed as an inexperienced baker except these:  - time the bread takes to rise - temperature at which the bread rises - how to shape a loaf Overall, the recipe is easy to follow, and the bread tastes great!

Like everyone else.  I found the recipe to be excellent.  I like my bread a bit more a on the sweet side so I added about 1/4 cup of white sugar.  However, the recipe is excellent just like it is.  It is a very easy recipe as well.  Very simple.

Easy to do and great taste. I have to do another batch due all my family ate them just after bringing them out of the oven. This is a recipe that my family will share for a long time.

Fácil de hornear y deliciosos al paladar. Mis failiares se los comieron tan pronto los saqué del horno.  Tuve que hacer más para los invitados.  Definitivamente es una receta quese quedará en nuestra famila  por mucho tiempo.

This recipe is GREAT!! OMG, I tried another recipe a few weeks ago and it was dry and hard.  BUT this one...moist, soft and delicious!!  I just finished baking my first loaf and  I am super excited for my husband to taste THIS bread. Because with the last recipe, I think he was just being nice by eating it.  That's it, I don't think that I will be buying bread EVER again!  Thank you Nita.  I did however sub the honey  with white sugar (for the first part) and brown sugar (for the second part) because I have a toddler, and I didn't want to risk with the honey.  It worked out just fine!!

This bread was so great! This being my first time baking bread at home, I had a little trouble with growing the yeast first. Otherwise..this bread was great, especially hot out of the oven with some butter and jam!

This recipe is GREAT! I make bread all the time but this is by far my favourite recipe to date. I used multigrain bread flour, scaled down the recipe just slightly and made 2 loaves instead of three. So sweet, and so soft! Will make this time and time again I'm sure

This is absolutely great bread and as breads go, fairly easy. This would be good for first-time bread makers. I added a bit more honey and I used a little milk with the water.

This recipe has become the new staple of our bread box at home. The recipe works just as well if you substitute sugar for honey (I tried it when I was out of honey). You can also bolster up the nutrition by making it with 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.

I added wheat gluten, 5T. I think, only half of the honey, and swapped an extra cup of the white flour for wheat. I don't think I kneaded long enough, even though it sprung back, it didn't raise well or even the last time. It's still chewy and delicious and even my son that hates wheat bread is begging for more. I've always had a horrible time making bread so thank you for a recipe that I can actually make work!!

This was a really great bread recipe!! It was my first attempt at whole wheat bread, and I'd only made white once before, but it turned out great! My family loves it. I used whole wheat bread flour as well as whole wheat flour and it still turned out fine. I will definitely be making this bread again!!

Simply wonderful!  This was my first attempt at any bread besides French Bread and it was great.  It wasn't that hard and the flavor is MUCH better than storebought.  The only change I made was 1 big loaf and 4 mini loaves (apparently I don't have 2 big loaf pans like I thought!) I just reduced the cooking time for the small loaves by 5 minutes.  Thanks so much for a keeper!

Great bread, I use naturally white flour and whole wheat.  Other than that I change nothing else.

I just found this recipe while searching for alternatives to the food-like substances offered in most markets.  It was easy and dellicious!!  My husband and friends all loved it.  I found the comments of others very helpful, with many suggestions for variations I am eager to try.  This is the only bread we will be serving at our house!  One variation not mentioned was using rye flour.  My husband loves rye bread but I am unsure of the proportions of white to wheat to rye flour to use.  Has anyone tried this successfully?

Yummy! So soft and chewy. It's hard to find a whole wheat recipe anyone will eat, this is definitely it! My husband and kids couldn't get enough!

this recipe is by far the best wheat bread recipe i've made (~4-5 different recipes many times).  it is soft, great texture, and just the right density.  works great for grilled cheese, french toast, and sandwich bread, not to mention fresh and hot with butter or EVOO on top.  i made it in my bread maker, but would do the first few steps in a bowl next time and start at the kneading process for the breadmaker.  also needed to cook a bit longer than the 27 min i gave it.  i'll probably try ~32-33 min next time for the bake.

Very good!  I think the best part for me was how easy it was to cut.  I usually destroy the bread while I'm cutting it, but this bread sliced with such ease!  This is my new bread recipe!

This is delicious bread.  I make this all of the time.  The only thing I do different is I add flax seed and sunflower seeds to it.  I freeze the extra loafs and they thaw out very nice.  I no longer by bread at the store. Is wonderful toasted.

This was a very good bread! I cut it down to only one loaf since I was low on ingredients, but I followed the recipe as written. It seemed a little low on liquids - I got in all the bread flour and about 2/3 of the wheat flour, and that soaked up all the moisture. My dough wasn't even tacky. The loaf came out rather short and dense, but it was quite tasty! I'll have to play with it and see if I can get it a little lighter, but it's well worth multiple tries.

I've never made bread by hand before and it turned out perfectly. My new husband says it's as good as his mom's (that's huge).  I use just less than 1/4 cup honey each time and all-purpose flour and we really like it. I will try using bread flour one day to see if it makes that big a difference. I do use a thermometer to bake it to the perfect temperature and it turns out great!

Amazing. I'll never ever make any other wheat bread again. My picky husband who never likes homemade bread liked it. I may just make this my standard bread recipe and forget about white bread altogether. It's that good!!!

This has become my most used bread recipe.  It makes 3 loaves which is a nice time saver.  I simply freeze the other 2.  The flavor is wonderful.  Nothing beats the smell of fresh baked bread, or the taste of hot homemade bread out of the oven!  Heaven!  Just make sure you follow the directions or you may end up with bread your not too happy with!

This is another OUTSTANDING recipe!!  I finally made the time to try this recipe today and it turned out fantastic...who ever  would have thought that whole wheat bread could be so tasty.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe; it will be a "standard" in this house.

So delicious!!!!!! I am not a bread eater but this recipe has won my heart.  I followed the directions exactly and what transpired was an incredible tasting bread.  The honey definitely makes this bread.  I would not change the quantity as suggested by others.  I made three loaves and gave two of them away for Mothers Day to close friends.  One friend asked me if I can make her and her family a loaf per week.  I highly recommend this recipe. So yummy and good!

This bread was excellent.  I accidentally took it out of the pan too early, so one of the loaves had ugly sides.  I will definitely make this again (exactly how the recipe says).

I made this bread at 1/2 the scale, and I got about 14 dinner rolls and one small loaf.  I used all wheat flour, but the bread was very soft and had a great texture, especially when spread with a little butter.  I didn't have any honey, so I used brown sugar. Fairly easy for not having a bread machine.

What a great recipe! I only made 2 loaves, but they were the perfect size for sandwich bread. If you choose to do this, you need to bake them for about 45 minutes.

This is so easy and delicious! I didn't brush the loaf with butter at the end because I like my bread a bit crusty. Still, it came out very soft and delicious! I most definitely will make this again.

This recipe is the best I have ever tasted. I had four people ask for this recipe the first time I made it. I don't bake often and was able to make this with a little effort but well worth it!

The recipe for Easy Whole Wheat bread was simple to follow and the results were great. I'm making this bread again soon.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a 50/50 white to wheat flour and next time I'll use even more of the wheat.  The dough was incredibly easy to work with, and the bread ended up so soft and delicious.  I accidentally added WAY less salt in my haste (1 tsp), and it was still wonderful.  My kids enjoyed it with soup last night, and this morning ate it with peanut butter, and with butter and honey.
