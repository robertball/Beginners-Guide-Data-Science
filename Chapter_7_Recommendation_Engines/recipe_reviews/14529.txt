HOT! HOT! HOT! When you use all 8 peppers this could take someones breath away.  Keep away from children.  I also made a batch with 1/2 of the peppers and everyone could enjoy these.  I love hot food so I liked it with 8 peppers, anyone else who is not a big fan of hot, hot heat add your peppers in slowly til you reach your desired heat. Then ENJOY!  We also liked this sauce on ribs.

Very good!  I only used three habanero's 'cause I was a bit nervous about the heat but the wings turned out great!  Next time I will use five habanero's.  (This recipe went well with Bill's Blue Cheese dressing found on this website.)

I think this was good. Ever since kolej, I have become an addict iof chicken wings and I like stuff hot. This is easy, spicy, and hot. It suits me just fine. Not so kid friendly, but that may be because a kid I once knew returned ketchup to his burger because it was too spicy. Price, in addition, is good too.

Good sauce!!! But we like hot, spicy food.I cooked them a little differently however.I took frozen wings and put a bit of sauce on top of them, then placed them in the micro for 3 minutes in batches of 6. I then put them in a ziplock bag and refrigerated for about 24 hrs turning occasionally.I cooked them in a 325 oven for 1 1/2 hrs basting with the sauce every 20 minutes. Yummy

This sauce is great! I used 5 habeneros and it was spicy, but not bad. It would be good on salmon or chicken breasts as well. Will make again and again.

Fantastic!!  I only used 4 habaneros since some of my guests didn't like really hot food as much as I do.  They went so fast I almost didn't get any myself.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again, but will use more peppers!!  AWESOME!!

We would like to give this a 4.5, if possible.  We made some changes to the recipe, but made the sauce as directed (with all 8 habeneros).  We used chicken breasts instead of wings, and deep fried them instead of grilling.  Then we dipped them in the sauce.  It was very hot, not for the faint of heart.  It's very good and unusual though, and we liked it a lot, which is good because we have tons of leftovers!

We Love these wings. We use this for our wing recipe. The only thing we do different is cook the wings on the grill first without the sauce because it tends to burn before the wings are cooked inside. Then we put the sauce on them in a baking dish and throw them in the oven for about 10 minutes. YUMMY!

It was hard to make because I didnt use gloves to cut the chiles and OMG it burned my hands for 2 days... overall the flavor is good.  I used only 5 habaneros because I got scared of all the other reviews but next time I will use all that the recipe asked for.  I also didnt grill them but baked them @ 350 for about an hr turning and basting them repeatedly.  I loved these wings! except for the burning hand issue.

nlike some other hot sauce this has flavor along with the heat. We used it as a sauce on fried and grilled chicken breast and thighs. It was perfect made just as the recipe was written.

These were delicious! Used all 8 habaneros. Grocery store didn't have green chiles that day, so I used one large red chile instead. Great recipe. Will make again.

I did these at a smoke-out / barbecue party and they were a huge hit.  I used 8 unseeded habanero peppers and nobody complained about the heat.  I marinated overnight and brushed extra sauce on them before serving.

I was only able to marinate them for 2 hours but basted them with extra sauce while grilling.  I also served them with extra sauce.  They were ok, I am not sure if I would make them again.

THESE WINGS HAD A GREAT FLAVOR UNLIKE ANY I HAVE HAD IN THE PAST.  I COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE KICK THOUGH.  I USED 10 HABANEROS AND STILL FOUND THEM A BIT MILD I MAY TRY NOT SEEDING THEM NEXT TIME AROUND.  WILL FOR SURE MAKE AGAIN!!

Absolutely wonderful! We did not marinate the chicken breasts (no wings this time) since we did not have enough time, but it was tasty!!

These were super!  I used all 8 peppers (in jar - no fresh ones available).  I also added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I cooked them in the oven on a broiler pan to save time but will grill them when possible.  My guests said these were the best yet!

I was trying to recreate some wings I had at a popular restaurant chain and these topped even those. Next to Eli Manning, Craigs Mystic Wings were the best part of my Super Bowl party.

These turned out pretty good. My store doesn't carry fresh habanero's but I found them jarred and pickled. I like heat but the thought of using 8 plus 4 green chile peppers scared me. I went with 5 and that was perfect for us. The only change I will make next time is to cut back on the ginger.

This sauce has a lot of dimensions of flavor. I gave it a go some years ago and am marinating some tonight again. It's hot! A nice change from the run of the mill wings.

After cooking hundreds of recipes on here I decided to leave my first review as I felt this recipe is a little under the radar.  We couldn't find fresh chiles, but substituted dry with a few red pepper flakes.  This recipe is perfect as-is!  A little sweet at first but a perfect heat that lingers a bit.  If you don't like spicy, perhaps not for you but this is delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.
