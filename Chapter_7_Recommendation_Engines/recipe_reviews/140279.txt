I made this Ham for Easter. I used the slow cooker instead of the oven. The type of ham was a fully cooked Spiral Ham and cooked 4 to 5 hours on low. This ham was moist and a wonderful flavor. My husband loves eating the left overs from the fridge. I will make this receipt again, and again.

To heyjude615, I bought a bottle of Welch's grape juice and used a cup of that.   Made this for Easter dinner and it was delicious. Best ham I've had in a long time. Before making it I though maybe the brown sugar, cola, pineapple juice, and grape juice would end up making the ham too sweet. I couldn't have been more wrong. The sweetness complimented the saltiness of the ham perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again in the future. Thanks for the great recipe.

My dh's grandmother made her ham very similiar and since I couldn't find her recipe I used this one.  It came out just as good, dare I say maybe better?!  So moist, flavorful...my picky kids loved it.  Even my sil who doesn't like ham loved it.

The only ingredients I had on hand were cola, brown sugar and pineapple. So here is my version. Marinate ham(8lbs) in cola overnite in oven bag but do not poke holes in bag until ready to bake. Turn bag a few times throughout the process to insure "even-ness". Drain cola and add pineapple with juice and rub ham with brown sugar. I only added 1/2 the sugar. The cola is used to tenderize the ham and Boy did it!!!Delicious!!! This was the best Easter ham ever....

Just had this tonight for your dinner club. Got rave reviews. I used the slow cooker method, cooked a 6.5 lb precooked boneless ham for 4.5 hrs. I skipped the pineapple. I thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry and it gave the sauce a little more body. I was very happy with the result. My guests could not believe the sauce was Coke and grape juice. After I put the brown sugar on the ham I wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator for about an hour. It seem to make the sugar "stay on the ham" longer.

This recipe is great. I served for Christmas this past year and everyone loved it. A week later my sister-in-law asked for the recipe. She couldn't stop thinking about it!

We used a pit ham as well as a butt ham with this recipe.  I have to say the pit ham was very decadent and delicious!  The butt ham was ok but that was not because of this topping, it was because a butt ham is definitely not as good as a pit ham! Made this for Christmas and EVERYONE loved it and said it was the best ham they had ever had.  If you concentrate on the flavors you will probably taste the grape juice but if you taste it without that in mind, the flavors meld very well and make this ham well worth the effort.  I made this in my Nesco at the same temp as the recipe states for the oven.  It was done in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.  Will definitely make again!

We thought this was ok.  I felt like I could taste the odd flavors of the grape juice and coke.  It really didn't do anything in terms of tenderizing my Cumberland Gap boneless ham, in fact the skin became a tough chewy rind.  Would bake another boneless hame but not necessarily this combo.  I did like the idea of serving a sauce alongside ham though.

My first time baking a ham for a tough crowd. It was a hit! before cooking, I scored the ham and added cloves. I used pomegranate instead of grape juice.

I made this ham for Easter dinner and it was fantastic! I used an 8 lb spiral sliced smoked ham that already had a brown sugar glaze on it (so I skipped the brown sugar step in this recipe). I poured the cola and grape juice around the meat and cooked on low for 4 hours in my slow cooker. The end result was moist, delicious ham that we will make again for sure.

Really an awesome recipe - I used a bone-in, spiral-sliced ham, and did not bake the pineapple slices w/it.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly...it turned out perfectly.  Very moist, flavorful...the kids loved how the sweet taste countered the ham's salty taste.  Will probably only make ham like this in the future.  Threw out the flavoring packet that came with the ham and glad I did!!!

This ham got rave reviews from everyone! Made this for our Easter dinner. I didn't baste it every 20 minutes as we were at church most of the time it was cooking, and it still came out fantastic! Will for sure make it again!

I made this for Easter this year and Everyone loved it. It came out so tender and juicy. Even my mother loved it and wanted the recipe. It was surprising considering she frown at what the recipe called for. I will make this a tradition for every Easter from now on.

I have found that using 'Dr. Pepper' and eliminating the grape juice makes a much more complex flavor to the ham due to the spices in the soda.   Note; Use ONLY Dr. Pepper, other like soda's don't work.

I made this on easter this year a little weary of it but decided to go with it anyway. This was the first ham I had ever made and I was a bit nervous when my family took the first bite. It was so good, and so moist it has to be the best ham I have ever eaten!! Best part is I made It lol. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

I made my ham this way for Easter. It came out good but nothing spectacular. It just tasted like ham once you got down into it. I baked this in my electric roaster. I normally cook my ham in a convection oven, it always comes out just as moist in there as it did with this recipe. This ham works great if you don't have the convection oven and are just baking it in the regular oven!

This was one great Ham. I cut off the bottom of the ham and placed it in a baking dish. I cut diagonal patterns all over the ham. Did not based every 20 min and was still very juicy. This ham is for those that enjoy sweeter things. Definetly will be my new special occasion Ham  THANKS AMANDA :)

I just made this for a Christmas party. The reviews were good. I did not have any grape juice in the house so I substituted grape soda pop. I had to leave for a while, so the sauce did not get added until about half of the done cookng.The juice was on the runny side and did not thicken much. When the ham was done cooking, I sliced it and placed in a cake pan and poured the sauce over the ham. Placed the whole pineapple rings on the ham, sprinkled with brown sugar and returned to the oven for the sugar to set. Everyone commented on how great it looked and tasted. Next time I will get the sauce in earlier or maybe reduce it on the stove a little to thicken it up like a glaze. Great recipe!

I cook my ham almost like this every time. I always get a bone in ham. Lay pineapple slices across the top put in cloves and just sprinkle on a little brown sugar and then pour a can of Coke over it, cover with foal and bake as directed depending on how big I get.
Everyone always raves on how good it is.  My father in law and I have high blood sugar and I was told the carbonation of the soda pulls out the salt and leaves the taste.  7 up or ginger ale also works.  I like cola the best.

This ham was a big hit for my Easter dinner.  It was the first time I've ever baked a ham and I was very pleased.  My guests enjoyed it too.  The brown sugar and Coke really made for a nice sort-of jerky layer on the outside that I'm still snacking on hours after dinner.  Yum!

I have made my ham this way for several years for one holiday or another.  I've used all different types of hams.  The recipe I originally used was titled Aunt Naomi's easter ham.  It is fantastic!  I don't use the grape juice and don't always use pineapple juice if I don't have it...even with only the brown sugar and cola it turns out great!

this is the best ham I ever made.  So juicy and tender.  I used sprial ham and used the package of spices that came with it and spread it across the top, I followed the rest of the directions exactly.

this was a great big hit this easter. We usually aren't big on easter but my husband is in the Air Force and many of his friends don't to be with family so I usually cook for the guys and they all loved this ham, I didn't make any changes except add a little bit of garlic because we love garlic on pretty much anything and it helped keep the ham tender.

Excellent! We made our ham this way for our Easter meal. The ham came out moist and yummy.  I used a spiral cut ham which worked nicely.  My husband loved it.  He has never been a big fan for tradtional hams made with cloves and spices. This is a great replacement recipe for any traditional ham recpies that use lots of spices, especially for people who are sensitive to them. Highly recommended.

Woah!  This recipe was incredible!  I made it with a spiral sliced ham, and we all wanted to have bigger tummies so that we could have slice after slice of this delicious and moist ham!

This was really good! I changed a little bit - I used orange juice since I didn't have any grape juice, and I added a bit of Penzey's Baking Spice to the top of the ham for a bit of kick. When the ham came out of the juices, I put the pan on the burners, let it boil, then added some cornstarch and water to thicken it into a gravy. It tasted delicious and will be my go-to recipe!

I am a few months shy of 50 years old and have been making ham this way since I was in 4-H at 10 years old. After scoring the ham, I stud the crosses with cloves.  I have never used the grape juice though, I always used some wine in its place, any kind except sherry which has too distinct of a falvor. I had my first dinner party at age 18 and used Concord Grape Wine and it made the gravy lavender colored!  I would think the grape juice would do the same.  Any soda works here, root beer is good and any ginger ale or white soda as well.

I always try out recipes before serving them at Holiday diners and I went ahead and took Brownie1's advice and marinated the ham in coke in an oven bag overnight turning it so it would tenderize evenly and i did use the grape, pineapple and even the one can of coke to cook it. It came out tender and was absolutely amazing. I poured the pineapple juice over it and the sugar coated well. Definitely will be serving on Thanksgiving!!!

First of all... DON'T TELL ANYONE WHAT THIS RECIPE CONSISTS OF BEFORE THEY DEVOUR IT.  Secondly, I was lazy and threw it in the crock pot and went for an internal temp of 160.   If you do it that way, the "sauce" is  thin rather than saucy.   But... I was too lazy to do it in the oven.   In the oven, I'm sure the sauce would have looked more like sauce.   Bottom line, the entire family went NUTS over the ham, and there were no leftovers for me the next day.  I SWEAR to God. IS THERE NO JUSTICE IN THE WORLD TODAY???  And after I told them the recipe, they said, "You're kidding me."   LOL.   Sometimes it's fun feeding these animals!    LOL.

Peace and Love, Happy Easter,

Dante

AHHHHHH-MAZING!!!!! I just made this today for Easter dinner. Everyone raved about it! My mom said it was the best ham she ever tasted! When I read the recipe I said "oh man, this sounds like it will be WAY too sweet!"...But it really wasn't at all! Absolutely DELISH! I made it exactly the way the recipe says....I used a spiral ham. Loved it! Thank you!!!!

I have used this reciepe with orange juice instead grape juice.  You can also use ginger ale instead of cola.  I usually use ginger ale as oppose to cola.  Itdoes give the hame a cook flavor and I found that the ham isn't salty.

this was my first attempt at ham, and this recipe helped me knock it out of the park.  It was very flavorful, my husband kept telling me how delicious it was. the only small change was, I needed to add more liquid (water) to the pan for the basting part, but other than that it was easy. I will absolutely make this again.

Extremely delicious!! After reading the ingredients I wasn't sure of the outcome. I was so surprised at how scrumptious this ham turned out!! Even people that normally don't care for ham had seconds and thirds and wanted more to take home! What a compliment!

I made this ham on Easter and it was THE best ham we have ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly except I bought a semi-boneless ham.  It came out tender, moist and just delicious.  My husband, who doesn't really care for ham, ate several servings.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is the first time I have ever tasted a ham that did NOT taste like ham...  It had a very strange taste and left a very bad after taste too.  We double checked the recipe and we did cook it correctly.

Used this recipe for our Easter lunch today. Delicious!  I used a spiral cut ham which had a sugar glaze so I did not put the additional sugar on the ham. I also cooked the ham in my crock pot on low for about 4 hrs. I think the cola and grape juice helped with the salt that you would normally have with a ham. This is my go to ham recipe from now on.

Yikes!  I tried this recipe yesterday and the mixture turned out to burn very easily.  I ended up with a black ham, and virtually none of the many ingredients affected the flavour.  Next time I'll try something simpler.  I believe the many ingredients were unnecessary.

This is one of the best ham recipes I've made.  I made if for Easter and the whole family loved it.  From other reviews - I decided to place my ham in a turkey bag (left from Thanksgiving) and marinate it in cola overnight.  I also used a bone-in ham.

Very tasty but ended up with more of a sauce than a glaze. Would make again.

This was a hit at Easter! Moist and delicious. Even left overs tasted great. Next time I will try in the slow cooker.

Tried this recipe for a family Easter  dinner. Didn't go over as big as I had hoped. The ham was really crispy and dried out even though I basted it every 20 minutes. Won't use this recipe again.

It came out so nice and juicy and seemed like alot of the salt taste that usually comes in a smoked ham was gone. Was a huge hit with my family will definately make this again

My Easter dinner was moved up several hours on short notice this year, so while I had planned to follow this recipe, I had to "hurry it up."  I increased the temperature, decreased the cooking time, used white wine instead of juice (thought we had apple juice at least but couldn't find it), and skipped the pineapple.  I did add ground cloves and ginger to the lovely sauce, meant to add mustard too but forgot.  Altogether totally delicious though!!

I made this for Easter dinner and the whole family couldn't get enough of it.  Everyone had seconds!  This will be an Easter staple from now on. I followed the recipe except for two things. 1. As another reviewer suggested, I marinated the ham in the cola overnight.  2. I baked the ham between 325-350 degrees in my Komado style BBQ.  The ham fell off the bone and was as sweet and juicy has can be.  Great recipe and I'm looking forward to my ham sandwich for lunch today.

I made this for Easter and it was a HUGE hit with the adults and kids.  I made it with a 5 lb. pre-cooked ham and just cut the cooking time (post-brown sugar) by 40 minutes.  My picky daughter who NEVER eats ham happily ate it, so I will call it a winner.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I could not pick out the cola or grape juice tastes.  I used Welch's white grape juice, which I thought might have a less obvious flavor, as a precaution.

This recipe was surprisingly good. I have to say, I was not sure about the grape juice, but the sauce was delicious! And it was pretty easy to make. I used a 9 pound fully cooked spiral ham, baked it at 325 degrees for 30 mins. to melt the brown sugar, then lowered the temp to 275 as suggested on the ham label and baked and basted for 2 hours. Everyone loved it!  Will definitely be doing this again!

Made this for Easter and it was a huge hit. I ended up with about a 4lb ham in order to fit it into my smaller slow cooker (3.5 qt) so halved all the other ingredients. Served it with homemade scalloped potatoes which I expected to be the hit and that was a mistake, I should have made more of the ham! I scored the ham and packed it with brown sugar the night before then cooked it on low for 2 hours before adding the sauce ingredients and cooking for another 3 hours. My family has already requested that I make it again (and again).

Like some others suggested, I studded the ham with cloves. Wasn't too sure about purple grape juice, so I used white grape.  Also used Mexican Coke, the kind that comes in a glass bottle (contains no high fructose corn syrup, real sugar instead) also used about 1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar. Yum!

Have done a ham for several yrs , all I do is add a can of coke, cook slow on low heat 300degrees, for several hrs. Ham will melt in your mouth! If you do not like your ham to fall apart then don't use this recipe! The trick to a good ham is the brand of ham you use. The only ham I ever use is a boneless Superior Ham ! I sometimes have to go as far as another town to find one, but it makes all the difference!They usually run about 12 to 20 pounds each, but you can always have it cut in two pieces and freeze half for another day. tmangirl

Been using it for years.  The wine version is less sweet, but a fantastic flavor. Coke has been used for many years to tenderize meats of different varieties.

I think it would be better with  Vernors ginger ale and no grape juice. And reduce the brown sugar to one cup or use honey. Also in crock pot for 4-5 hours.

This is my go to recipe for baked ham now. I have made it this way in the oven per instructions and also in my crockpot and both have been a success. I have also used grape jelly as referenced before when I did not have grape juice and it worked perfectly. This is a great way to make a no hassle ham, and I use the recipe year round for ham sandwiches.

I was hoping to use my slow cooker for the recipe but my Crockpot was too small! I used the oven and it came out fine. The flavor was not overpowering, which was good; everyone liked it. I think I was expecting it to be sweeter. The one thing I tried was to make a glaze with the sugar and cola. I would make it thicker if I make the glaze again.

I made this ham for my family on Easter and they absolutely loved it. Although I didn't do any basting, this ham still turned out to be super moist and flavorful. I took another reviewer’s tip and used pomegranate juice instead of grape juice…I was very pleased with the result. Next time I’d like to try another reviewer’s recommendation of adding corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up a little. Overall, I think this is a great ham recipe.

A wonderful ham - I've used cola before but not the other ingredients. Very tender, juicy and flavourful. I did add a bit of heat to it but that was all. Do try it.

Wonderful recipe!  I use this recipe every time I bake a ham.  There was a time or two when I didn't have coke or pineapple and I used root beer once and the last time I used cream soda and oranges and it's always great again and again.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.  Debbie

I will make this again. My cured ham (we got it in bulk and I hadn't tried it before) wasn't very salty on its own, so next time I will add salt to the sauce. The flavor was very good and it was easy.

My family enjoyed this ham on Easter Sunday. I used a bone-in smoked ham.  I omitted the grape juice and upped the soda.  I ended up pouring soda directly on the ham because the drippings were too thick and burning.  I put my pineapple rings on the bottom because I wanted them caramelized.  The skin was sweet and crispy, the ham was moist and salty.  Really good recipe.

This ham turned out delicious. I did not use the grape juice tho~ didn't want it that sweet.  My aunt has always baked a ham using CocaCola.!

I love ham but I always do the same brown sugar, pineapple, and honey glaze. I wanted to do something different. I tried to follow the recipe exact but somehow by the time I got to the grocery store I thought it was apple juice not grape juice. Still turned out great. Next time I will use the grape juice though. Not sure how I mixed that up. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe as a base, subbing ginger ale for the cola & orange juice for the grape juice because those are what I had on hand. Made a gravy with the liquid after ham was done. AMAZING!!  BEST HAM I'VE EVER BAKED OR EATEN!!! Came out juicy and delicious. Super easy and my husband loved it, so this is the only ham recipe I'll use from now on.

I just made this yesterday for pre Easter and it was wonderful. I followed exactly as written except I used a 8.25 lb. farmer john ham with bone in it. This will be my go to ham recipe!
