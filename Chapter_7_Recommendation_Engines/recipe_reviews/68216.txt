Sorry, this recipe ended up discarded.  I wondered if the 1 and 1/8 cup of vegetable oil with the 1 and 1/4 flour was the problem.  There was so much oil floating on the top, I had to spoon it out.  I could have added to the problem with the turkey stock which contributed to the oily base floating on top and the apple sausage which may of given it a funny taste.

I am pretty sure that the oil measurement is wrong as well as the flour one. I made a roux tonight to add turkey stock to & all it took was 1 stick of butter & about 3 tablespoons of flour.  I added about 6 cups of turkey stock, a little at a time, & ended up with about 5 cups of yummy gravy. I also added chic granules for clout & kitchen bouquet.  have to be careful with KB as it is potent. My Grandmother used it. It is in all grocery stores.

With less oil and flour to make the roux, it's a delicious meal. My family loves this. My mother made it when I was growing up. We like to use hot sausage rolled into balls and Bisquick fried, then drained to get rid of excess oil. Garlic added along with the parsely would make this a perfect reason to have Thanksgiving any time of the year.

After reading the reviews, I cut the flour and oil both down to 1/2 cup each - the recipe was delicious and a great way to use some left over turkey!  We also added a bag of frozen okra to the gumbo with 30 minutes left to cook.  We'll definitely make this again!

I enjoyed my gumbo but I couldn't give this recipe 5 stars because I modified it. My Cajun Grandmother (who was an AMAZING cook) always said the best rule of thumb for making a gumbo roux is 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup flour, 8 cups stock. So when I read this recipe I was shocked at the amount of oil, flour and stock that was called for. Goodness me...that would be some THICK, greasy stuff!!! So I followed the recipe except for those amounts. It was pretty good. Great way to use some of our leftover turkey. :-)

Tired this recipe last night and it was Wonderful!!! Everyone raved about what a great way to use left over turkey and wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this.  I did follow the recipe as close as I follow any recipe.  I did add 1/4 cup more of floor to balance out the roux and more stock while cooking to keep it the consistency we like.  The last 15 minutes of cooking, I added shrimp because at our house,  Gumbo, need shrimp.  Served it over rice.  Truly a keeper.

Taking others' advice, I cut the oil down to a half cup and used a half cup of flour.  The house still smells like a fry-up, but the end result gumbo was not too greasy.  I didn't have any file powder or sassafras (which is what file is made from) so I subsituted a combination of sage, thyme and oregano - a recipe I pulled from Wikipedia.  I used chorizo sausage I had on hand, leftover rice from an order of Chinese, and my leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  A good use of what was hanging around in the fridge after the holiday.

Wow....The roux is way off! Followed this recipe to a T...Tasted like veg oil. Not close to gumbo in any way. to correct recipe would be to use less oil & a little butter to make the roux. also need garlic & blk pepper. would not recomend waisting your time, money or leftover turkey. This recipe should be removed from this well trusted web site.

I make this recipe based on the previous measurements that were posted.  I believe it was recently edited to double everything.  Anyway, I gave it 4 stars because as written there is WAY too much roux.  I make this recipe as written several times a year, except for cutting down on the oil and flour for the roux.  It is absolutely delicious and easy to make.  You may need to add a little more stock if you find it is too thick or cook it down more if too thin for you.  You really can't mess it up.

Really good.  I used a stick of butter and about 1/4 cup flour for the roux instead of all that oil.  I thought it added more flavor.  Added a bag of okra at the last 2 hour simmer.  File powder really adds to the flavor.  Also added some garlic.   Thanks for a tasty way to use that leftover turkey.

I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out perfect. I used fat free chicken broth and hillshire farms andouille. I think if you made turkey broth from scratch and included turkey skin as well as kept the skin on it would definitely be too greasy. Use fat free broth and white skinless turkey meat and it is excellent.

The oil measurement must be off.  Also, a roux is so much better made with bacon fat--you only need a little bit (maybe a quarter cup to 1/2 cup flour) and it can get super hot (unlike butter), then mix in the flour, stir like crazy until it smells nutty, then add the vegetables.

Definitely use less oil and flour.  I followed another reviewer and used a bit less than a half cup of flour and 1/4 cup of oil.  Get it a nice deep brown color, also added okra.  It was delicious.

I followed everyone's advise and only used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour.  I didn't have any file powder  ( I've never even heard of it before) so I left it out. It came out wonderful. My husband and son loved it and want me to make it often.

I made this using the suggestion of 1 stick of butter and I used 3-1/2 Tbsp flour.  Also used a mixture of oregano, sage and thyme for the file powder (which I had no idea what it was).
Tasted great.  Will do again.

I loved that there was at least one Cajun on earth who wrote down a good turkey gumbo recipe.  I have tried for years to get one out of my dad, but he doesn't measure or write things down!  I used chef Paul Prudhomme's roux recipe and his poultry magic in place of file.  I have never seen file outside of Louisiana, but chef Paul's products are in Safeway stores and on his website, along with the roux recipe.  Bon apetit!
