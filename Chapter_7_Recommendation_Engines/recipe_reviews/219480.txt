to the previous reviewer, the 2 recipes are the same in that they are both "thanksgiving leftover" recipes that both use thanksgiving leftovers lol.  did you even make the recipe before you reviewed it???  not good for the community! i made this and it was amazing.  can't wait to make them again  next year, or maybe after christmas if we have the leftover ingredients!

the turkey part is not bad....the sauce is the key. It sounds odd and comes out awesome. I made a couple minor changes...I wanted more filling and less fried stuff so I made mine as eggrolls instead of wontons. In the salsa I tossed the whole (de ribbed/de seeded) jalepeno in and I did not drain the lemon juice off of the cranberries...I heated em up and they absorbed all of it as my quick plumper upper method.Added: these were such a hit the family wanted them again....but I was out of cranberries and only had dried cherries on hand/tried using them. Dried cherries worked well too!

I brought these to my monthly ladies night.  The ladies were hesitant to try it since it sounds so weird, but after they did, they couldn't stop eating them.  One lady even suggested to her sister that this is what they should have for Thanksgiving dinner.  I made recipe pretty much as is.  1/2 the recipe for the Cranberry Salsa seemed to be more than enough.

This was such a great way to enjoy leftovers and have a unique and beautiful presentation. I had large sized wrappers so rolled them up as egg rolls and deep fried in oil for 3 minutes. They were amazing. And the cranberry sauce was an improvisation since I used jalepeno jelly instead of onion, garlic & jalapenos but it was absolutely amazing. I brought leftovers to work and everyone raved.

I needed a festive recipe for an upcoming Christmas pot luck we are attending - something different.  I saw this recipe on here and thought it sounded interesting.  OMG!!!  What a terrific discovery it is!  It does take a little time, but the result is well worth it.  I plan to make a double or triple batch and freeze them for ease in future entertaining.  

The salsa is very tasty and suits the wontons extremely well.  A great accompaniment.  I believe that the salsa would be even better if made a day ahead so the flavours have a good chance to marry together.  Also, the next time I make these, I plan to spray the waxed paper with cooking spray so they don't stick before I fry them.  I cooked them in my electric non-stick wok and this worked very well.

This recipe was quite good, I will definitely make them again.  A couple tips though, chop up all your ingredients to small pieces so the flavors all blend nicely in each wonton.  The same goes for chopping up the dried cranberries in the salsa.  Also, if you have the forethought, let the salsa sit for a day, and it will really blend the flavors together.

Made these 2 days after Thanksgiving and they were fantastic! We skipped the salsa because neither my husband or myself are huge cranberry fans. While we were eating the won tons we agreed that if we had made the salsa they probably would have been even better, if that is possible. You don't need to cook anything ahead of time, just take it out of the fridge into a bowl, mix, stuff, fry.

Yesterday was the last day that my sister and good-for-nothing brother-in-law, James, were in town for the holiday. Since we had SOMEHOW still not managed to finish the leftovers from Thursday, James “suggested” that we do something “different” with the remaining turkey, stuffing, and potatoes. As if he hadn’t imposed enough this weekend...I’m sure some people can relate! Thankfully we found this recipe thanksgiving leftover solution. It was fun exploring cooking with a foreign vessel while staying comfortable with traditional thanksgiving ingredients for the innards. They tasted good enough to keep James from providing any snide commentary for the remainder of the night. For that, I’m truly thankful!

I made these the day after Thanksgiving and my kids loved them. they are easy to make. instead of the cranberry salsa, I used the cranberry sauce I made for Thanksgiving and it worked perfectly.

Big hit! I couldn't find won ton rappers, so I used philo dough (which worked!) I omitted the jalapenos & it was still really delicious.

Delicious! Made exactly as written. I did do a few in my actifryer and those were delicious also. They are the ones in my picture that don't have the same golden brown. The salsa makes them extra special !!
