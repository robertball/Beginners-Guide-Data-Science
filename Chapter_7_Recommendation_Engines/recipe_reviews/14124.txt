I've been a vegetarian for about 5 months and I'm not a very good cook since I'm only 13. I really love this recipe.. it was probably the easiest and I didn't start a kitchen on fire or anything. on of the things i added to the recipe was some fresh onion. You can add anything more and It'll still be great. Try this recipe if you are not the best cook in the world.

I don't really think this is a recipe, even. It's just adding vegetables to spaghetti, which is something I do on a regular basis. Stirring in your own seasonings (or just using a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce to make it easy) is definitely required, and I think more Mediterranean vegetables like zucchini, eggplant or peppers would be better. The corn and carrots just seem out of place.

This is a great "throw it together" meal.  It was a little bland though, since it does not call for any spices.  Throw in your favorite spices and this is great!

Not bad, but make sure to chop your veggies very fine if you want them to be tender!

Used this recipie as a guideline and threw in various other vegetables and seasonings according to what I had in the house. Used no salt added tomato sauce and made a lovely and filling low sodium sauce. You could modify this recipie for anyones taste or special diet and I bet it would still be quick and easy and filling and good!

This was good, I made a few changes by adding sauteed onion and garlic to the veggies and adding assorted Italian spices. Too bland without them.

I rather like this recipe, especially with a bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Not quite enough sauce for my preference though, I'll double it next time :)

I give this recipe three stars because it did have a bland taste to it, but it was fulfilling to eat. Just add some spices and that will add taste if you want taste.

This was a good recipe. I added more broc. and didn't add mushrooms because I don't care for them. My husband had it as leftovers the next day and said it was too dry and just didn't taste good. I will make this again but when we can all have it fresh.

This dish was okay, i did try to add a healthy kick to it and use whole wheat pasta which may have made it a little more bland. I'm not sure how i felt about the corn being thrown into the mix.

This recipe didn't read right without spices, so I just added what I usually do to sauce.  The corn/carrot combo didn't work for me - thought it was interesting and I'd try it, but should have known better. The mushrooms and broccoli were very good.  Nothing out of the ordinary here I'm afraid.

This dish is is good, easy, and quick. The sauce is good, but a little on the bland side for "pepper-bellys" like me. So if you like to spice things up, add about 1/2 tbsp of black pepper and a dash of cumin.

Suggestion: heat the veggies in sauce - while this is cooking, start the pasta - you'll both ready at about the same time and both will be fresh and hot.

I added powdered garlic - Tones Italian spaghetti spices plus Tones spicy spaghetti to "spice " it up a bit.  Needed lots of help in the spice area. Seemed a little bland until I goosed it up a bit. Both garlic and the two spaghetti additions made it pretty good test taste before it was done.

So many more things you could make if you have spaghetti, mushrooms and tomatoes.  Certainly no need to add corn or carrots.  To be honest this looks very unappetising.

Really good. I added green and yellow peppers. I love flavor so i seasoned with lemon pepper and weber's veggie grill seasoning. With cornbread on the side, it's become a family favorite.
