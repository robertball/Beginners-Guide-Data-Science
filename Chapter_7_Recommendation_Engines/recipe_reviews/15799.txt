Soups in general, and Italian soups in particular, traditionally were made in the frugal "peasant" style, using odds and ends of what home cooks had at hand so as not to waste anything. This soup also lends itself to that tradition. I used this recipe as a starting point and got creative as I went along, using what I had at hand in the pantry and freezer. I made my own stock, using beef and chicken bones with good bits of meat attached, that I had collected in the freezer. I also browned up some Italian sausage, casings removed, before sauteeing onions, celery, the red bell pepper and garlic - the sausage added great flavor! I used tomatoes I had frozen from my garden, a good glug of red wine and added some chopped zucchini with the pasta. Rather than fresh thyme I threw in a good Tuscan seasoning blend, along with salt and pepper to taste. I used canned cannelini beans (white kidney beans) for the beans called for, adding them at the last with the fresh, chopped spinach.  This soup was so delicious, so rich, hearty and satisfying, that I was sorry I was full because I wanted another bowl! The aroma alone is enough to make you salivate and after weeks of travel and eating restaurant food this was just the sort of home cooked comfort food I needed. In true Italian style, don't forget to serve with freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese!

This recipe has become a staple for my lunches.  I double the recipe and freeze individual portions to take to work for lunch everyday.  It freezes well and tastes just as good when reheated.
I ususally add alot more thyme then it calls for - usually 10-12 stripped sprigs.  I find it adds a really nice flavour to the soup base.  Also, I add the liquid from the canned tomatoes to thicken the broth and add some colour.  I usually add equal parts of both red and green pepper, alot of garlic, and I use canned kidney beans instead of uncooked.

Very much like a minestrone. Very nice color presentation. I simmered a lot longer and think this will be even better tomorrow. Make sure you add some shredded parmesan on top and serve with a big, crusty bread. Yum. Husband liked this so much, he wants me to make it again for friends tomorrow night.

I loved this soup.  I agree with the author that this soup is all one needs for a filling (and healthy) meal.  I did skip the spinach.  Along with other ingredients already listed, I actually added a few additional things to it to make it a little heartier.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes to make preparation easier, some green beans, 3 cups of shell pasta (instead of 1), green pepper and green onion, some diced chicken breast, and italian seasoning. Instead of using the suggested canned chicken broth, I used approximately 5 cups of chicken broth.  I followed others' suggestions and simmered it for about 30-45 minutes.  Even my husband who is not normally a big fan of soups thought this was a good recipe.  This is an easy to follow recipe with simple ingredients and preparation, and it's good for stretching the grocery budget a little farther.

I made this tonight, and the aroma - oh, my! Very flavourful and just the right amount of everything. I'm so impressed that there was only 3.1 gms of total fat, 29gms of carbs and 0 cholesterol. I'm a type 2 diabetic and making this was not only fun, but added another solid winner to my faves! Thank you Robyn, for another great recipe!

I cooked this yesterday and it turned out great. I doubled the vegetable stock (pasta absorbs a ton of liquid) and added 2 cans of cannellini beans, 1 can of kidney, chopped tomato and the rest of ingredients. Very filling and great flavor!

This was easy to prepared and wonderful to eat.  I added a whole can of diced tomatoes and doubled the amount of spinach.  Leftovers the next day were even better.

SO GOOD!! And cheap! I made a few changes. I didn't have any bell peppers and my husband's not a big fan anyway so I left those out. I used a can of cannellini beans for the beans, stewed whole tomatoes , a red onion, 2 cloves of elephant garlic and I wanted to up the protein so I cubed two chicken breasts and cooked them in the garlic and onions before adding the other ingredients. Then instead of broth I used 5 cups of water and 5 chicken bouillon cubes, I didn't have any fresh thyme so I used a heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I also doubled the spinach and I used multigrain penne instead of seashell pasta because it's what I had on hand. FANTASTIC!! I could seriously eat this every week. It would be amazing with some rosemary focaccia bread.

I have made this soup a few times and love it.  It is very filling and easy to control sodium content.  I have made it substituting the thyme with fresh basil and added mushrooms.  I will continue to make this soup!

All I can say is Yum! This dish has a very pleasing presentation and is so good. Not to mention it is on the healthier side of eating! Great recipe. A keeper that I will be making over and over. As someone else mentioned, this is a great lunch option for my busy schedule. I freeze small containers worth and take with me to reheat. Excellent.

This soup was WAY more delicious than I had anticipated!  I've been eating it for days and am not tired of it! I couldn't tell whether that pasta was supposed to be cooked before adding to soup mixture since they said to add it and serve in 5 minutes.  I used tubetti and did cook it first, then just let the soup simmer.  FABULOUS with shredded fresh parmesan and hot sauce!!  I will definitely make this one again...super easy, yummy and so healthy.  I used Trader Joe's frozen chopped spinach; just threw the whole bag in - how easy is that?

I made this recipe for the first time at work for my co-workers, 8 of us.  I made a double recipe and there were no leftovers.  I was a little nervous about trying it out like that, but they all agreed that it is a keeper!  I used low sodium chicken broth, so we could have plenty of grated cheese with it.  I also substituted cannelini beans for the kidney beans and escarole for the spinach.

Super tasty and healthy! I didn't have time to soak the beans so I used a can of kidney beans, so that (unfortunately) added some sodium. Also added extra pasta shells. Very hearty and flavorful!

Wonderful!  Taking "creative license", I added some chicken italian sausage, zucchini and a few hot pepper flakes. This created the need for more liquid so I doubled the broth. This has become a family favorite.

We really liked the soup, but it took longer than 15 minutes to make it.  I'd say more like 30 minutes.  I used 2 cans of broth and might use more next time.

I thought this tasted really bland. The only changes I made was using egg noodles and using dried thyme to taste. I was able to give it a little more flavor by adding a tad of garlic salt and some grated parmesan cheese to my bowl.

Very easy and tasty. I made a few substitutions: veggie broth for chicken broth, red beans for kidney beans, ground thyme for fresh, egg noodles for shell pasta. I also added a couple teaspoons of salt, a few shakes of italian seasoning, the liquid from my canned tomatoes and two cups of water because there was hardly any liquid left after I added the noodles. My husband and kids wouldn't eat it because they have something against beans, but I shared it with my dad and step-mom and they both said it was very good. Thanks!

Love this recipe for a hearty, filling soup on a cold day.  I used mushroom stock instead of chicken stock to make it veg & doubled the amount of chopped, fresh spinach.  I'll be making this again soon for sure.

We loved this soup!  I didn't use canned beans because cooking dry beans taste so much better, imo.  I also let it simmer for 40 minutes instead of 20.  Will be making it many more times.

Made this soup to freeze for when my sister-in-law who is a diabetic comes to visit.  My husband was the taster and he said this is great it is a keeper.  I added 1 cup clamato juice.  I brought the broth to a boil and cooked the pasta for 10 minutes, turned down and added the spinach.

This soup was SO very delicious, simple to make and it's so healthy as well.  After I added the pasta (I used tubetti) I thought it could use more liquid so I added some beef broth as well and it made it a little darker and heartier.  It's very satisfying without being too heavy.  I may try canellini beans next time and maybe use fresh rosemary instead of the thyme.  Lots of ways to tailor it to your own taste.  It would be really good with some crumbled sausage (turkey, of course!) and make an even heartier soup/stew.  I strongly recommend this recipe now that the weather is getting cooler and we need some comfort foods that are really good for us.

Delicious!!! My only changes were to use white beans instead of kidney beans which I don't like and added some zucchini.  I love it and make a double batch so we have plenty of leftovers.  I serve it with some crusty french bread and it's a filling meal which is a favorite in my house. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a good base soup to start with but was a little bland.  I used green pepper instead of red (didn't have) and ditalini instead of sea shell.  I added dash of cayenne pepper, crushed italian seasonings and some cooked sausage.  Next time I will try fresh spinach.

This was kind of blah. It looks absolutely fantastic and colorful, but I just found it a little bland for my taste. I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a litte, but, well, I was a little disappointed at how all these wonderful ingredients came together so uninterestingly. Maybe I like salt too much or something, but the addition of salt definitely helped the flavor.

Basic, good.  Is the person who put forth this recipe not aware that you can buy canned tomatoes that are diced?  why would you buy a can of whole tomatoes, then dice them?

I found that I had to add quite a bit more chicken broth as the soup was a little too thick. I used what I had in the frig; like a yellow pepper. It smelt great cooking.

I liked this, but as mentioned in the comments here, thought it was a little bland, it needed a little hot sauce and the shredded parmesan was a welcome touch. I had four chicken legs in the freezer to use up so I made my own chicken broth and added the roasted chicken from that to the pot. Added an extra 1/2 cup of pasta shells, and when I make it again I'll double the amount of spinach.

I was looking for a recipe that I could use a pint of kidney beans that didn't seal so they wouldn't be wasted.  I like to try recipes from this site without any changes first so if it's good i can give it an honest evaluation.  I will keep this one as one of my favorites as it DID NOT disappoint.  Next time I make it i will use it to clean out the fridge.  So many possibilities. Kale, Swiss chard or beet greens instead of spinach.  Or maybe some shredded carrots or something like zucchini that would add some great contrasting color.  I think next time I will also add some mushrooms, the possibilities are endless.   I did pre cook my pasta so it wouldn't pull any moisture away from the soup.  What a great soup.  Either the way it's published or using it to clean out the fridge.

I was afraid that this soup would be bland, after reading some of the reviews so I made a few changes: I tripled the garlic(!), used 1 can of red kidney beans and 1 can of cannelini beans, as well as 1 can of chopped tomatoes; added 1/4 cup of red wine; used 4 cups chicken broth (instead of 3); added 1 tsp garlic salt, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. It was not a bad soup, but still maybe a little on the bland side. I might try this again with some Italian sausage.

This is a good base soup but it lacks body and is bland, even with the addition of the fresh herb thyme.  In order to give it some heft, I also added garlic powder, a little salt (although I understand this is a low sodium dish) and plenty of pepper.  In the future, I would sauté this vegetables in tomato paste to add some flavor to the soup.

I decided to make this on the spur of the moment.   I didn't have the thyme, so I used dried savory instead, and I threw in a little dried basil, too.  No chicken broth, so I used a beef stock base, and 3 kidney bean cans of water.  I omitted the pepper because I was saving that for something else.  No shell or elbow pasta, so I used low cal, high fiber short cut fettucine. ( 2 cups)  I added half a bag of frozen organic leaf spinach ( the closest to fresh and much easier to use).  The result was a delicious lunch! It came out great. I packaged up the rest in individual plastic containers for a few fast and nutritious, low calorie, high fiber meals.  This soup will become one of my staples. It has plenty of things I love: spinach, beans, tomatoes, and pasta.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This soup was very pretty but was lacking in flavor on its own. I only made minor alterations (vegetable stock instead of chicken, since I'm veg, and ditalini instead of sea shell pasta.) If I make this again, it will have more garlic, more thyme (maybe dried would work better in this case?), more spinach and less pasta. Also, I had to add another cup of stock otherwise it would have been thick stew instead of soup.

Doubled the recipe except for the pasta.  Measured everything except the tomatoes (used two cans stewed) and the spinach (used one ten-ounce box).  Might be good without the pasta.  Had way too much for me.  I added one carton of beef broth and one fifteen-ounce can of tomato sauce.  OK, but I probably won't make again.  If I did, I would add carrots and not add pasta.

My toddler says this is yummy and the rest of the family seems to agree. I used green pepper instead of red and was out of onion. I also reduced the liquid content and served with cheese.

This recipe was so good and so easy. I used 1/2 tsp. thyme in place of the fresh that I didn't have, and it was just right. I will add a little less pasta next time, probably 1/2 cup as it just soaks up all the broth. But excellent flavor.
