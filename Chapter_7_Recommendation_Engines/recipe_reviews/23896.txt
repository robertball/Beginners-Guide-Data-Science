I made this for my husband who isn't really into pizza much, but he said this was THE BEST pizza I've made him to date. I made Jay's signature pizza crust for this (highly recemmended) and left off the breakfast sausage since I didn't have any pork thawed out and didn't feel like running to the store. I made italian style sausage by Lee Fogle for this. Used leftover jar pizza sauce. I only used about 6 oz of shredded mozarella as the 12 of MJ sure turned into a huge pile after I shredded it. I added some sliced fresh mushrooms to half of this. A winner here, Thanks, Sara!

I've eaten something similar to this as a breakfast pizza. Instead of pizza sauce it uses sausage gravy and adds scrambled eggs. Love the sausage and white cheese with the eggs!

The name deceived me at first as I quickly read White Pizza, not White Cheese Pizza. My wife and I have had a running competition the past 1.5 years to see who fails to concoct an original white(no pizza sauce) pizza. This recipe would be a great addition to the list, sans the sauce of course. A good sauce-less pizza lets ALL the flavors shine, not just the tomato base.
