I melted part of a dark chocolate bar and spooned some over the top of each cookie after they came out. I served them right out of the oven so they'd be warm. They were a nice hit with the roommates! 
I agree with Laura that these are sweet enough as they are, so use unsweetened coconut. I had to add a little more flour and coconut to mine since they were really wet when I tried to roll them together. They rose nicely and were really cute.

Delicious!  Fun and easy to make!  I added chocolate chips to one-third of the batch.  My tips are:  not to fret if the cookies fall apart a bit when rolling them in the coconut.  Just pat together and drop them  on the baking sheet.  Also, I suggest using unsweetened coconut flakes (Bob's Red Mill).  The cookies were truly  sweet enough.

I had to add more flour for the dough to hold together.  I think my egg whites made more liquid because they were from large eggs.  I also used unsweetened coconut.  The sugar in the dough makes them sweet enough.

These "Four-Ingredient Gluten-Free Italian Coconut Cookies" were quite good. They looked like "tiny snow balls," so they are perfect for the Christmas platter. I shaped mine with my meat-ball scoop. I accidentally added all the coconut to the batter (instead of saving some of it for rolling the cookies as per the instructions), and still thought the batter was too wet to hold together so I added a couple extra tablespoons of BOB'S RED MILL GLUTEN FREE flour as well (MY MISTAKE: I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. My cookies were very good; however, they were not as moist as the same variety of cookies from the supermarket owing to my own failure to follow the instructions.) Next time I will try to follow the instructions more closely. Thank you Melanie for sharing your recipe.

Delicious and easy to make. Best with dark chocolate drizzles! I've added this one to my favorites. I do agree with the other posts that adding a little extra flour helps with texture.

Really good! Nice cookie. Crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Will definately make again! Used brown sugar and worked perfectly! Would recommend baking. Better than most GF cookies.

This is a great use of left-over egg whites.  They are a smidgeon lighter than the regular macaroons but still have that great chew.  I topped them with a chocolate drizzle because I love the flavor combination.

Super easy and great flavor. A great alternative to macaroons that come form the store that typically have gluten. Very light, but sweet.

I put extra unsweetened shredded coconut to thicken the dough, and mixed in chocolate chips...perfection!!!  Even my husband who isn't a coconut fan loved it.

I used regular wheat flour. They were very sticky so I was concerned they wouldnâ€™t turn out very good. I took them to work and everyone loved them. Plan to make a double batch  for church.

Love these.  I broiled them the last 3 minutes to toast the top coconut layer.

Too chewy, used Carb Rite Flour and erythritol and extra flour also. Not great.
