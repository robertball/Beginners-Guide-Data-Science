This is one of our favorite salads.  We use romaine and just d'anjou pears.  Add your favorite style chicken and its a meal in itself.

this salad was delicious.  the pears and balsamic go together perfectly.  i added some sliced almonds for a little extra flavor.  some might find the balsamic vinegar a little overpowering so you may want to add a bit less than the recipe calls for, or put it on the side.  i'll definitely make this salad again!

Best salad yet!! Try adding slivered almonds and dried cranberries with it. These added ingredients are cheapest at Job Lot.

I replaced lettuce with baby spinach. It's yummy! I've tried it with walnuts, dried cranberries, dried cherries on top. It tastes great either way. Thanks!

I made this as called for, replacing the Japanese pear with a regular pear. Adults thought it was great, kids weren't crazy about the feta. I think next time I'll leave it off and sprinkle it on top for those who like it, and maybe add some celery or nuts for some added crunchies :)

It was alright.  Maybe pears and lettuce just isn't my thing.  Can't say anything bad about it, but nothing for me to rave about either.  Maybe I'll try it with a different kind of pear?
