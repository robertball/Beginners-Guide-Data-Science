I used two canisters of reduced fat crescent rolls that I baked and cooled. I used ground turkey that I spiced up with Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (which is also from this site), made my own spicy secret sauce, half of a chopped red onion, omitted the seasoning salt (it didn't really need it--we try not to use a lot of extra salt), shredded sharp cheddar and I doubled the tomatoes. (We like a lot of tomatoes.) I think this recipes success depends on the quality of ingredients you use. It helped that I made a lot of the ingredients and spiced up my ground meat before layering it on my own homemade secret sauce. We all enjoyed this quite a bit, even the littlest. He thought this was better than a real cheeseburger!

What do you make when you're short on time and need to make dinner in a hurry? This would be it! It's basically a hybrid of two all time favorites pizza and cheeseburgers- what could be easier or better, right? I added a little garlic to the ground beef and onion and used "Thousand Island Dressing III" from this site. I used shredded cheddar cheese and definitely added the optional chopped tomato and dill pickle slices. And, while I have to admit that while I love pizza and I love cheeseburgers I think I'll stick to them separately. (Even though my husband loved it) This a really good recipe for a quick meal.

This is a great recipe!!! I never have thousand island dressing on hand, so I just mix mayonnaise and ketchup together in roughly equal parts and use only 1/2 the amount of dressing for this recipe.

I thought this was pretty good.  A few of my finiky kids didn't like it- but the others did.  It's not something we make all the time, but it's really interesting for a change of pace.  If you don't have thousand island dressing, mix up mayo, ketchup, a bit of sweet relish and a bit of chili sauce.  Over all, this is yummy!

Wow. What an easy and tasty dinner. I was impressed. I just seasoned my beef with minced onion and seasoned salt. I also used cheddar in place of American and topped with pickles. With this recipe, you can definitely have your Big Mac your way (oops, wrong slogan, that's BK). This was devoured. Thanks, I'll use again.

Excellent!  I used the 'Authentic Thousand Island Dressing' from this website and it was PERFECT.  Loved it - wouldn't change a thing!

Back in my hometown, there's a pizza chain, Valentino's, who makes a bacon cheeseburger pizza, which is my ultimate favorite pizza ever. My aim was to copycat that pizza, using this recipe as a guide. I had some turkey bacon to use up, so I diced it up and fried it using the drippings to sautee half a diced yellow onion. To the hamburger, I added a couple dashes of worchestershire sauce as well garlic/onion powders to taste and a little seasoning salt. I then mixed the bacon and onion right into the hamburger. I made the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site too, which was wonderful. Instead of the Thousand Island dressing, I used a mix of ketchup and mustard and added a little mayo for good measure. Valentino's bakes the pickles right into their pizza, and so did I. I diced up a couple sandwich-sliced Claussens and added it directly to the ketchup-mustard mixture. I also added a thin layer of lettuce over the sauce and finally added the hamburger/bacon/onion mix. Covered with a mix of shredded cheddar, mozzarella, and an Italian blend and baked for about 10 minutes at 450. Husband devoured half the pizza by himself! This will be a repeat....I'd like to try again using the Thousand Island dressing now.

Great recipe and really easy to make!  I'm not really into american cheese so, I used mild cheddar and mozzarella instead.  I used fresh pizza dough and added garlic powder, a bit of salt, and cracked black pepper.  Next time I think I might add bacon.  I wasn't sure about the dressing but, it really added a great flavor in the long run!

This was liked by all.  Instead of Thousand Island dressing I whipped up a batch of my "Secret Burger Sauce" (recipe on this site), I don't care for the sweetness of Thousand Island dressing which is why I used my own.  I made two pizzas for my family and did a little experiment with them - one pizza had no dressing and we put the dressing on when it was done baking and the other pizza had the dressing baked as the "sauce", both were equally good BUT I didn't care for the sauced baked in the pizza when the pizza started cooling down.  We omitted the tomatoes since no one here cares for them unless it's in salsa, bruschetta, ketchup or spaghetti sauce.  We'll probably have this again.

This was ok. We liked it well enough. We omitted the pickles. I don't think we will make it again. I would want it to taste a little different. Update: I couldn't stomach the leftover and threw it away!

I didn't have thousand island so I mixed mayo & ketchup equally (about 1/4 cup each.  Should have made more - a lot of the sauce dried up during baking, & should have adjusted ratio to more ketchup than mayo.  Used some American & some mild cheddar.  I put some of the onions on raw (which I highly recommend). Definitely top with lettuce if you want it to taste like a cheeseburger, I'm not big on lettuce on pizza but in this case I think it improved it.

I used a frozen 4 cheese pizza and just added the hamburger, onions, garlic, yellow pepper and some olives, then put the lettuce and cheese on after it was done. Really was good this way. I don't like thousand Island all that much so using the regular pizza was better..

I'm surprised at how good this tasted!  I used cheddar instead of American and added thousand island to taste.  Very easy to make, and a nice change from traditional pizzas.  Will make again.  Thanks.

We loved this! I cut the pickle sices into fourths and put them on before baking, and instead of cooking the onions w/ the meat, I just chopped some up small and put them on the pizza raw. Also, I didn't measure anything, just did it all to taste, using shredded cheddar in place of the American cheese. While this didn't taste just like the 'famous burger', it was very tasty and super fun for something different. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love the concept of this, but I can't stress how IMPORTANT the right thousand island dressing is. Because the kind we got wasn't it...so it turned out slightly mediocre when it could have been phenomenal. Oh, and when it says drain your beef, really drain it. Blot with paper towels if you need to. The grease off that and the cheese really adds up.

This was fun. I was too scared to try the thousand island dressing as the tomato sauce. I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I just used standard tomato sauce. The hubby really liked it but kept wanting me to hand him a piece without lettuce! LOL

This is awesome. My family and I really enjoyed this. At first bite I wasn't really sure what I thought but half way through I was hooked. It really did taste like a cheeseburger. I used a Boboli pizza crust and that worked out great. I didn't measure out the 1000 Island dressing. I just spread out enought to cover the crust because I was afraid of it being soggy but I think it actually could have used a little more. So so good. I you like the Big Mac you probably like this pizza.

I really really like this recipe, no it's not going to impress anyone at a dinner party but you can have a tasty dinner on the table in about 25 minutes that the kids will actually eat that's worth 5 stars in my book!! I used a boboli crust, which worked very well; it was quick and the thickness gave it a "bun" feel, I would't do a thin crust with this recipe. I hate pickles so i didn't use any but other than that I did the recipe as is. Next time I would: Make individual size pizzas, there's a lot of stuff on there and cutting the slices was not the easiest thing to do, I'd probably add some crumbled bacon and lastly I'd chop the onion a lot smaller since my toddler can spot it from a mile away but that was user  error not the recipes fault. Oh and by the way I actually LOVED the thousand island dressing on there!!

This was great. I baked my crust for a bit before adding everything. Don't be afraid of adding the thousand island during the baking ;) This is a great pizza!!

This was pretty tasty.  I wasn't too fond of the dressing used though, I think it would be better with mayo.

Great recipe, easy enough for a college student learning to cook such as myself.  Takes a little longer than normal pizza but worth it.  I also made my own thousand island for the pizza using a recipe I found on this site.  I also used about 80% american and 20% cheddar.   I pre-cooked the crust (only meant to defrost it--but left it in too long, whoops) and then once all the stuff was on top, baked it at 300 until the cheese melted. came out perfect.
Definately top with lettuce if you can, it adds a lot.

Would have loved this with regular pizza sauce--the Thousand Islands dressing (which we love on salad) ruined the pizza for us.  As my husband says, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".  Thanks anyway

It was okay.  I think it depends on what type of Thousand Island brand dressing you use (can't remember what I used, but, I didn't care for it--plus there was too much dressing for my tastes) and what type of pizza crust you use (I used a store brand, since it was all they had left--again didn't care for taste of crust with rest of ingred.).  I may try again.

This was pretty good! I wasn't sure about the pickles but I think it really added something to the pizza.  I added bacon too and next time will make my own crust instead.  Thanks!

I really liked this. I changed a few things. I did a pound of meat and used chedder cheese. Also I put the onions on top with the lettuce and tomatoes. I gave 4 stars because my 6 year old daughter did not like.

Very different and tastey.  Simple and quick to make.  I only used enough Thousand Island dressing to cover the crust.  I think a cup would be way too much.  It was a nice twist on trasitional pizza though.

Awesome!  I added a dash of garlic powder and onion salt to the beef as others suggested, but otherwise made it as described.  Since I wasn't planning on finishing the whole pizza in one go I put the lettuce, tomato and pickles only on the slices eaten that day.  This way the leftovers tasted just as good when reheated.  I also drizzled extra thousand island dressing over the top since I always do the same with burgers.  Definitely making this again!

We thought this was great!  Made as directed, but I added the pickles before baking under the cheese. Blotted sliced pickles with paper towels before adding to pizza to get excess moisture out.  Didn't measure ingredients... just eyeballed it. Once it was out of the oven I put on the lettuce and lightly drizzled with a bit more thousand island dressing.... yummy 
Will make again for sure... next time will try with homemade crust!

I made this for lunch while watching Sunday football. It is a perfect tailgate or homegate food. Everyone loved it and could not believe how much it tasted like a cheeseburger. I used buffalo style Ranch dressing instead of Thousand Island. Just because I know everyone likes ranch. Also left the lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side so you could make it your own. Definitely will make this again!

Kind of like a big mac on a crust. My crust never really got crispy though which made the whole pizza greasy and limp. I will try again with a different crust and probably cut back on the dressing as it was a bit over powering

I used this recipe as a starting point for my own cheeseburger pizza. I made my own home made pizza crust and thousand island dressing and used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage in place of the ground beef. Also used can diced tomatoes and cooked them with the pizza. 
The group of friends I made this for said the hot sausage "MADE" the pizza great, and that ground beef wouldn't have been as good. It was recommended that instead of slicing the pickles, dicing them would have been better. Very interesting to have a cheeseburger pizza!!!

This recipe was easy to make and delivered the taste of a big mac as promised! I used pre-made dough from TJs and I baked it for about 5 minutes before I put the dressing on - I was worried that the dough would be soggy with the dressing, meat, onions, and cheese. Also, I used mozza because we prefer that. But other than this, followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted great. Not the healthiest, not the most gourmet, but definitely a fun change from regular pepperoni pizza!!

i used ground turkey instead of beef, baked the pickles with the pizza, instead of adding them after baking, and i omitted the tomatos. i didnt have quite enough american cheese, so i used 1/2 a cup of american, and 1/2 a cup of colby jack cheese instead. i also made my own dough (i used jays signature pizza crust from this site).... storebought just doesnt taste as good once you've made your own! my husband really liked this & i thought it was a nice change from the 'normal' pizza. next time i'll use maybe 1/4 a cup of american and a full cup of cheddar or colby. the runny-ness of the american cheese mixed with the dressing made it a little hard to slice and pick up wthout all the toppings falling off the crust. it was was good either way, but i would have liked it better if everything stayed in place :) my husband ate his pizza without lettus, and i ate mine with a ton of lettus. either way, i'll make this pizza again w/ just a few minor adjustments to suit our tastes. thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for something different to do with ground beef.  This recipe had it all!  It was quick and easy to prepare and my family loved it.  We just had it a couple of nights ago for dinner, and it has already been requested again! Next time I will use less than the full cup of thousand island dressing (just a matter of personal preference, as it was delicious with the full cup). I didn't have an onion on hand, so I used dehydrated.  Also, I had no American cheese so I used Colby Jack.  I think I will cut it before adding the lettuce, as cutting even slices through the lettuce was hard to do.  Other than that, it was perfect, and yes, we all thought it tasted just like a Big Mac!

The key to this pizza is use 1/2 cup of the dressing and bake the pickles on the pizza. You will have no problem eating the leftovers if you make it this way.

I loved this!!  Was first introduced by a friend, and now make it quite a bit.  My family didn't love it as much as I did, as they are not fans of thousand island dressing.  Keep that in mind when making this, and maybe try a different dressing like ranch.

I thought this recipe was OK.  I changed a few things.  I put catsup and sliced tomatoes to be the sauce, used sliced american cheese (I had it on hand) and made my own crust from one of the recipes found on this site.  It did taste like a cheeseburger, but the toppings all fell off when you tried to eat it. I don't know if shredded cheese would make a difference or not.  I might try it again and put cheese on top of the tomato sauce as well as on top of the meat.  My husband said he liked it, my daughter only ate one piece and said it tasted funny.

We really loved this, but I did change it a bit.  I did not use the thousdand island dressing because I just didn't need the calories and fat.  Instead, I made it more like a Quarter Pounder with Cheese instead of a Big Mac.  I used 28 oz. of diced tomatoes directly on the crust and topped with the beef (mixed with dried onions and a little BBQ sauce), cheese and pickle relish.  I will definately make it again!

My family can't wait until I fix this again. The best thing about it is you can actually fix it with lots of variance and still have the best end results. Yummy!!

I thought it was really nice-looking & good.  I don't like dressing either.  My husband hated it but he is SO picky!

Easy, but not very good. Didn't really taste like a big mac either.

Wasn't horrible, but no one really thought it was amazing either.  Neither of the kids liked it, but both were able to finish it.  Used store brand thousand island dressing, which probably hurt the end result, as the "sauce" was way too sweet.  Probably won't make again, but just out of personal preference, and not because the recipe was bad.

This was really good!  We had a pizza party, where I made five different pizzas, and this one went first!  My grandson Cody begs me to make this 'Big Mac Pizza' every time he comes over!  Thanks so much, we love it!

This was so easy to make and everybody loved it.  I have made it twice in 2 weeks and 2 people have asked for a copy.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.

I thought this was very bland.  Hubbie didn't care for it either even though it combined two of his favorite meals.  I won't be making this again.
