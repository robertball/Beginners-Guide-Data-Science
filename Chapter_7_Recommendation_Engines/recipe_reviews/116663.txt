Wow! This quiche was great!
I omitted the butter and bacon and used mushrooms as others suggested .
Used shallots instead of onion, added garlic and doubled the gouda which really made the flavor come out.
What an amazing quiche though...the best I have made yet.
Thank you.

Made this recipe for today's New Year's Day breakfast.  Didn't have Gouda, so I used Asiago.  Made a savory cracker crumb from the leftover boxes of crackers from last night's New Year's eve bash!  (Easy and GOOD!  Spread softened butter on sides and bottom of pie plate.  Crush up crackers, season to taste.  Press crumbs into butter on sides and bottom of dish - so simple!)  Sauteed a bit of garlic with the onions, and seasoned with various herbs - recipe as-is would have been to bland for our tastes.  Used 8 cups of fresh baby spinach, wilted in the sautee pan on top of the onions and garlic.  Next time will snip the spinach into smaller pieces before cooking, as the larger pieces were difficult to cut when serving/eating the quiche.  Cut the fat a bit by using 1/2 cup half-and-half, and 1/2 cup lowfat milk, with great results.  All in all, this is a good base recipe to use with your own creative additions.  I will add baby shrimp and marinated artichokes to the mix next time!

I was looking for a quiche recipe that was different than what I was used to making and I found it in this one.  I've never tasted gouda cheese let alone use it in a recipe so I thought I would try this.  I liked the recipe a lot but I did make some modifications to it.  I could tell that there was no way I was going to use 8 cups of fresh spinich so I eyeballed the amount I used.  I could also tell that 4 eggs and 2 cups of half and half were not going to fit in the pie crust so I halfed the amount.  I did season the cream/egg mixture with garlic and some cayanne pepper because we like a little kick to our food.  This was a great change and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe is by far the best quiche I have ever had! And I rarely give rave reviews. Here's what I do different... I use a whole package of bacon, cut it up and sautee it first so it's cooked perfectly. Then I cook the oinion in the same pan and throw the spinach in the last minute or so - it really adds to the flavor. If you can't find gouda or don't want to spend ten bucks on it, swiss is excellent in its place. Also, no need to bake the shell first. It gets done perfectly without this. For some reason I always have to cook this for an hour and 20 minutes - maybe my oven is off. In any case, it's easy to see once you cut into the center whether or not its done. I don't want mine juicy at all- the eggs need to be completely solidified. I LOVE THIS! My boyfriend loves it also - what man can resist a pound of bacon?

This was my first quiche and I was impressed. It even had my "Real men don't eat quiche" husband raving.
I spilled some of the cream/egg mixture on the outside of the crust, but, it still turned out just fine...so don't freak if you oops too!
I added garlic to the onions and used half gouda and half smoked gouda b/c I had some on hand. I also used frozen chopped spinach and onion. Next time, I think I'll leave the bacon out and maybe use ham instead and maybe swiss instead of gouda. Great hot or cold! Thanks!

This was my first quiche and it came out lovely. I made a few modifications to reduce the calories. I used a frozen whole-wheat pie crust, soy veggie bacon, and reduced-calorie smoked gouda. The smoked gouda gave it a lovely flavour but next time I'll omit the salt as I think with the smokiness of the cheese and the soy bacon, it was a little too salty. I also used just two eggs and 1 cup of half-and-half as I couldn't fit any more liquid in the pie crust. It still came out perfect. I had it warm for dinner and cold for lunch the next day. Will definitely make this one for company, it's a keeper!

Good and easy! Very versatile, too! I used some diced ham instead of bacon, one can of evaporated milk instead of half and half, feta instead of gouda, and made it crustless. I added some italian seasoning to the spinach mixture.  Keeper!  Thanks!

This is a great quiche!  The spinach should really be pressed, to get the excess moisture out...but even without doing that the flavor was awesome!  It is definitely enough to make 2 quiches.  I used 2c. of the gouda cheese and ham instead of the bacon.  Had enough egg mixture left over to make a second quiche.  YUMMY!

Delicious!  I used a smoked gouda, which complimented the bacon wonderfully.  Also didn't have half and half, so used one more egg, then a cup of 1% milk.  I made 3 of these for a Thanksgiving breakfast, and had no leftovers!

Oh my goodness this was the best spinach quiche I have ever made!  Everyone loved it (even the men).  I made a few changes though, I omitted the bacon and added a cup of smoked gouda (half on the bottom and half sprinkled on top), and I also added crushed garlic with the onions.  The recipe is a keeper and I think will soon be a family favorite!

This was my first quiche I used smoked gouda because it is the only one I have tried.  I added cayenne pepper, used skim milk instead of the half and half.  Added some Monterrey Jack cheese (1/4) and mushrooms.  This was delicious and will be added to my recipes.

I made this just like the recipe asked, but I had a lot of cream that I could not fit into the pan.  Something is missing in this recipe.

I just made this for Christmas brunch. It was delicious... perfect for the occasion. It took a lot of time, but was worth it in the end. I had to bake it a little longer than 50 min.

This was the first quiche I have ever eaten or made, so I wanted to make sure I'd like it by loading it with cheese and bacon: I used 6 oz fresh spinach (coarsely chopped to make the pieces smaller), 2 cups smoked Gouda, about 10 oz of bacon, 3 eggs, and 1 cup of soy milk vice 2 cups half and half.  I skipped the first step because I used a frozen pie crust -- I preheated the baking sheet and put the prepared quiche on that.  It came out great, and my friends asked for the recipe!

This dish was delish! I did make some changes: I don't know what it means to trim and flute the edge, so I didn't.  I did use Pillsbury deep dish pie crust, so maybe the trip and flute part wasn't needed. Idk. My husband thinks he doesn't like onions, so I pureed them first.  I also added extra spinach, which meant that I wasn't able to add all of the cream/egg mixture.  Since I didn't have any bacon on hand, I used smoked chicken sausage.  My guess is that this dish would go well with any meat you have in your fridge. It turned out great!

Delicious!  Slightly modified the recipe.  Omitted the bacon, added 1/2 t. chopped garlic, used 1c. shredded Gouda and 1 c. mozzarella and reduced the cream to 1 cup.  This recipe is a keeper!

We really loved the flavours in this recipe.  Had to make a few adjustments in the recipe as mentioned by others.  What was important for me is that the smoked gouda I used was a really nice change from the more traditional cheddar/swiss combo I normally use, and the spinach was a good addition too.  The flavours together ensure that I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I grabbed smoked Gouda by accident and used it anyway. It was wonderful! I left out the bacon, added sliced fresh mushrooms and used a bag of fresh "baby" spinach. I made a whole wheat "ice water" crust. Only needed three jumbo eggs. The man who hates spinach ate it happily AND finished off the left overs the next day!

I made this for my daughter home from school and it was delicious. I added Asiago along with the Gouda and it turned out splendid. Rich Creamy Texture. Great blend of flavors... I also substituted the bacon with turkey bacon... YUMMY and DELICIOUS...

Wonderful flavor combinations...definitely too much liquid for the pie shell.  Reducing the eggs to 2 and half&half to 1 C. would work, but cutting down on the other toppings might help too.  It had a smaller egg to filling ratio than other similar dishes.

We love this quiche! This time I used half smoked and half regular Gouda. Also doubled the recipe and it made three quiches right on the money. Comes out delicious every single time.

Made it twice and didn't quite get the great flavors I was expecting. Not bad at all though, just not great. I won't be making it again, but don't regret trying it.

Just made this for a shower and it was great! A couple of recommendations when shopping. If you are buying the bags of spinach(11oz.), you will only need 1-1.5 bags. Also, buy the deep dish pie pans in the freezer section for ease. I think the shallow pans are no where near deep enough. I also added mushrooms for an extra ingredient. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy.  Cooked it for guests and they requested the recipe since they liked it so much.  Cooking time took more than recipe stated.  I would probably add less cream the next time I make it.

recipe is awesome!!  Modified slightly as others suggested - little less half & half - more cheese.  I added ham chunks and sauteed the spinach in the shallots/garlic a little.  Has anyone frozen it??

I made this for a Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  I did add fresh mushrooms to mine and cooked them with the onions and spinach before putting it in the pie crust.  It was delicious and very easy to make.
