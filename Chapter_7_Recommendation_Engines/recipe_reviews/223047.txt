Delicious!! I made this in the slow cooker and it came out so tender and yummy!! The only thing different I did was omit the haba√±ero pepper. Those are way too spicy for us. Perfect combo of sweet and spice. Thank you for the new recipe!!

Loved it - I doubled the recipe since I had two pork loins.  I probably didn't need to though but the extra sauce was wonderful!   I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The habaneros made it perfectly spicy and they are a sweet hot pepper so meshed well.  Even my 11 year old loved it!  I love the idea of doing this sauce with boneless loin chops so will try that next!  Oh - don't even THINK of skipping the fresh thyme.   Wonderful!

Pro-tip: Instead of all of the chopping and dicing I quartered the onions, peeled the garlic and ginger, hollowed out the habaneros without touching the insides and tossed everything into my food processor.   Since you're blending into smooth anyways much easier to just let it blend that spend the extra time chopping and mincing.

If you love the jerk sauce at Buffalo Wild Wings, you will love this recipe.  The jerk flavor profile is very similar.  I thought this recipe was fantastic.  The seasoning was as good as anything I have had in a restaurant.  I used a jalepano instead of habenero. I also seared the pork on the stove at medium-high heat for 10 min then threw it in the oven for 20-25 min.  Dont overcook.  Pork is done at 160 degrees.  When I pulled it out of the oven I cut up the meat and left it in the sauce to absorb the remaining juices.  So nice!  Thanks Chef John.

This was good, and close to authentic jerk flavor. I used habaneros, as written, but think it would be better with scotch bonnet peppers. Served with simple baked sweet potatoes topped with butter, salt and pepper, and a classic carrot-pineapple raisin salad with a pineapple-maple vinaigrette. Our pork cooked up just a tiny bit dry (we normally grill the tenderloin whole) so I spooned a bit of the vinaigrette over it. Nice!

this was very tasty.. we used double the habanero but did not find it to be too spicy.. i felt like it could have been a little saltier, but then again we didn't marinate for the full amount of time.. probably closer to 3 hours b/c i was starving.. overall it was very flavorful and would love to try again or maybe also on chicken.. we enjoyed this with Green Banana Fries (on this site) and some black beans with sauteed onion/garlic/bell pepper.. ty for the recipe

I made this recipe last summer and everyone loved it however, hubby wanted it to have more flavor.  So last weekend when whole pork loins were on sale I bought one and put it in my slow cooker with the marinade. The house smelled so good.  When I was ready to serve I pulled it apart some but not completely.  Served with beans and rice and everyone raved how good it was.  Best of all it looked and tasted just like the jerk pork hubby gets at his favorite restaurant.  Thank you!!!

Unbelievably delicious! I've been wanting to try this for a while now, and am sorry I waited. Made it exactly as written with 2 habaneros and an 18 hour marinade. Perfect amount of heat and a wonderful spicy flavor. Also, it's so important that you NOT OVERCOOK YOUR PORK! Pulled mine off the grill at about 140 and let them coast to 145 on the rest. Tender, juicy, incredible. Can't wait to try this marinade on chicken! Once again, thanks Chef John.

this was very good! I used boneless pork tenderloin chops instead of a tenderloin roast. I only marinated for 2 hours, but the chops still had great flavor and were very moist and tender. Be sure to wear gloves before handling the habaneros, or EVERYTHING you handle and touch afterwards will BURN!

These were so very good! I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic. Since I was only cooking for two people I used 2 pork chops in place of the tenderloin I also halved the marinade since I was only making a small batch. I omitted the onion, but replaced it with onion powder instead ( just a personal preference). The habanero adds just the right the amount of heat without being too overpowering. When it came time to serve these I whipped up some more marinade mixed with a bit of cornstarch to thicken and used that as a sauce for my chops. This recipe will be going into regular rotation!

Absolutely delicious! Prepared the marinade just as written, except for substituting dried thyme for fresh. Browned the meat on each side, brought marinade to a boil, then placed it all in the pressure cooker. The meat was so tender and flavorful! Served with rice & beans, mango peach salsa, and warm corn tortillas. Yum!

Made this as written except to substitute jalapenos for the habaneros (because that's what I had on hand) and I also added a little salt to the marinade...I will make it again.  I'd also like to try the marinade with chicken.

Delicious is probably an understatement! I marinaded for 4 hours and grilled the tenderloins. Also, I used a large jalapeno I had on hand instead of the habanero/scotch bonnet pepper. The pork was a little spicy, but not overwhelmingly spicy. Be sure to watch Chef John's video before making this dish. I've used a slow cooker for pork tenderloin and did not care for the end result. I vote for marinading and then grilling, even if it means a longer marinade time--you won't be disappointed!

I loved this marinade for pork, I used it for bone-in chops on the grill.  Just a couple of tweaks....no habaneros so I just added a few shakes of Tabasco.  After making I found the marinade a little vinegary, so I added a little more brown sugar, and it definitely needs a little salt, I added about a teaspoon if kosher.  Definitely marinate overnight, I might even go two days next time, for max flavor.  Easy and delicious, I'll make this again.  Thanks, CJ.

Excellent! I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to spice, so I used jalapenos instead of habaneros. Juicy, tangy, and just spicy enough!

Made this as written - really liked having a little bit of cinnamon in the jerk marinade without it overpowering the other flavours (which happens often in jerk recipes). Also, make sure to listen to Chef John when he warns about how he cannot specify specific grill times. If you decide to grill the tenderloin, make sure you are able to monitor its temperature and not overcook or undercook.

I marinated both chicken breast and pork tenderloin. The chicken seemed to pick up more flavor. I used jalapeno instead of habanero. I also seared, then oven baked, rather than grilling.

Excellent marinade. Use a thermometer and make sure to pull at 145 degrees to avoid dry meat.

This is really delicious! I have never made my own jerk rub before and it was over the moon good - so much better than store bought! I also have never cooked pork on the grill before and was a bit wary, but it came out perfect (following Chef John's instructions). I didn't change a single thing and I'm glad I didn't. I can't imagine this being any more perfect or delicious.

There are no words to describe how incredibly delicious, tender and juicy this pork tenderloin turned out. (ok, maybe there are a few words)  And the trick of breaking down the tenderloin into 3 pieces...genius.  Mine was quite large and made 4 equal portions.  You are truly amazing Chef John.

Oh boy did we love this recipe! Ever since we vacationed in Jamaica we have been dreaming of the Jerk Chicken we would each on the beach. This comes close! I doubled the marinade and used 2 1/2 peppers. We marinaded pork tenderloins and chicken thighs. We all agreed the thighs took the marinade better. I can't wait to make this again and I think I will marinade the pork overnight and do the chicken for 6 hours. I will also save some of the marinade to pour over the grilled meat right before we serve it. I made sweet potatoes and rice as sides with a bit of cut up watermelon. This recipe made me soooo happy! It's a true keeper. Thanks Chef John!

We love this marinade, and you can use it on other meats as well. Delicious flavor with a great amount of heat.

Sooooooo good. I used only 1 habanero, but next time I will use 2. I also used pork chops. Will make again and again!
