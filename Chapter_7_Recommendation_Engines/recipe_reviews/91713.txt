Delicious - I like the fact that the apple flavor is inside the main body of the cake.  Crust is very unusual and makes for a great change from the traditional graham cracker crusts.  The apples on top make for a nice texture contrast.  

Batter is VERY runny, much more than most cheesecakes, but bakes up firm.  Make sure there are no holes or cracks in the crust when putting together.  Also, I recommend wrapping the base of your springform in aluminum foil to prevent any grease from seeping out into the oven.  

I probably should have given mine an extra 10 minutes in the oven, but my oven tends to run cool.

Overall a great fall cheesecake.

I have been making this cheesecake for a few years and it is always a hit.  its light, tastes great and is easy to make.  Arranging the apple slices to make it look like a flower is also worth the extra effort.

Made this for a pre-christmas dinner party and it was a huuge hit! When i cooked the apples i tossed in a little bit of cinnamon just for good measure, and you should definately double the glaze! What a great recipe- so delicious.

Good, for sure, but I'm not so into the apples combined with cheesecake idea. It was definitely tasty and I'd certainly eat it again, but with so many other delicious cheesecakes in the world, this doesn't make it to the top of the list!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was superb! The best thing is the crust.......no graham crackers. I will only make this crust now for all my different cheesecake recipes. It's the best! MG

Was beautiful and delicious! A big hit at the part I brought it to. I had to cook it slightly longer than suggested, around 50ish minutes.

I added a little vanilla extract to the body of the cake and graham crackers to the crust.  I made this for Valentine's day for my boyfriend and his mom. I don't bake often - but this was easy to follow and it tasted amazing. I am _ at this very moment making one for myself because i loved it so much. As a NYer cheesecake has GOT to be good and this is amazing

I wasn't sure if I should review this recipe as I had to make a few changes..but since it turned out so beautifully, I decided to anyway. Already into assembling the recipe, I discovered the apple juice I had was gone, so I decided to substitute with some home made apple butter. In addition, sweetened condensed milk isn't sold in cans larger than 300 ml where I come from, so I simply used that amount, no more. I did not compensate for these changes by changing anything further. For the glaze, I simply spread the apple butter over the cake and then placed the apples on top, with a light sprinkle of extra cinnamon on top of the apples. The cheesecake was very flavorful, creamy in texture and not too sweet, but quite rich. The shortbread-like crust is unique and adds a lot to the recipe. It makes a beautiful presentation and I almost hated to cut into it! I look forward to making this cheesecake again.

I made this desert for a Christmas dinner party last year, it is now the item I am always asked to bring. It was super easy to make and looks like an expensive bakery desert and tastes just as good. I have a friend who hated cheese cake but loves this.

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever made/eaten!  Everything about it is great, I've made 3 so far and all have been excellent!  I do recommend that you peel the apples you put on the top and use a good sweet apple like Braeburn or Honey Crisp.

I was worried that this would be disgusting, but it wasn't! It's a very unique flavor. I felt like it should've had more cinnamon flavor, maybe a touch of nutmeg or cloves too. Perhaps a caramel sauce? Instead of oats, I used this Quaker granola oat cluster with almonds cereal that I wasn't a fan of (too hard on my teeth even after drenched in milk for a while). Didn't have any sweet condensed milk, so I used Cinnabon flavored coffee creamer. I also put in a few shakes of cardamom, because cardamom should go in everything. I don't keep frozen apple juice in the house, so I used apple sauce. The apple sauce worked great right up until I got to the glazing part (next time I think I'll use a caramel apple butter drizzle). Cooking the apple slices in the skillet took awhile; I sprinkled some white sugar and cinnamon on them while they cooked to help soften them up faster. I also had to cook it at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. Oh, and I mixed some water and powdered sugar for another glaze to make it sweeter.

This was a very good cheesecake! I did tweak it a little bit.  For the crust I did 1/2 c. oatmeal, 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 c. cinnamon grahm crackers along with 1/4 c. chopped walnuts. Then I cooked my apples on the stove with cinnamon and brown sugar just a T. of each.  Just for a few short minutes to get them tender.  I then drained the sauce from them (but kept in a dish).  After baking the crust I added the apples to the bottom.  For the cheesecake I did add an extra cream cheese as other reviews had mentioned. Then added my extra sauce from the fried apples. I did double the sauce for the topping.  I also added caramel for a little something different!!  This was by far the best tasting EVER!! Loads of compliments...some people even thought it was a store bought cake..haha  Fooled 'em!

This was an excellent cheesecake. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I was not crazy about the crust though. I would have liked it to be more oatmeal-y. Next time I will probably add more oatmeal and less flour to the crust, maybe more like an oatmeal cookie crust. I did double the glaze which I would definitly reccomend. Overall it was a big success.

This came out awesome. I doubled the glaze and put about a third of the apple slices on the crust before pouring in the filling. But other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was delicious. Also, the crust came out perfect.

Loved this recipe!  The crust was a nice change from the typical graham crust and the filling was fluffy and light.  This may become our new dessert for the holidays!

This is an easy cake to make, however, it took way longer than 45 minutes, and I had to up the temp to 325. I also have a gas oven...so maybe that's why. Hope it turns out well (the taste I mean).

This was absolutely delicious! I did double the sauce as was suggested. My whole family said this was the best cheesecake I ever made.
