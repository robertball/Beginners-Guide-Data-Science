Good stuff. I used bottled lime juice and frozen melon balls. As a result, my smoothie was slushy and thick. Yum.

Yum Yum Yum!! Do to lack of ingredients though, I used double the cantoluope (no honeydew) and frozen limeade (no limes). Still great though!! Will make again

This was very good and refreshing.  I only had cantaloupe so I omitted the honeydew and doubled the cantaloupe.  I also used bottled lime juice (1/4 cup).  I froze half of the cantaloupe and it was wonderful.  Next time I will try adding the honeydew and using fresh lime juice, but this way worked well too.

Great summer breakfast or snack Penny! No need for the sugar; nature provided just enough in the fruit. Thank you!

Great Summer Snack.  Approx 1 melon makes 1 large glass so you may want to keep that in mind if you are entertaining.   I only used honeydew melon.  I subbed out the sugar for organic honey.  I also added fresh mint leaves.  Next time I will freeze the melon cubes before blending to make it a bit more slushy.  Excellent!

I made this with honeydew only and found it to be good and refreshing but nothing spectacular.  It's like an agua fresca without the work of de-pulping.

A perfect way to use my over-ripe, but still good, cantaloup. I didn't have honeydew, so I used frozen watermelon instead.  I also used lemon rather than lime juice, since that what I had. I added water to get it to an easy-to-drink consistency and added sugar until it was just right. Thanks for a winner! UPDATE: I'm rating this 4 stars, because although I really liked this, my kids wouldn't drink it.

Pretty good. The lime decreased the sweetness. It wasn't necessary nor did it make the smoothie taste bad.

My goodness, this had so much flavor for so few ingredients. This is a wonderful go-to recipe whenever guest come over... or not. I think I will also try to freeze this as popcicles for my dear children.

This is more of a melon slurry than a smoothie....there's nothing smooth about it.  I made this with honey instead of the sugar and slightly less as honey is sweeter. However it was still too sweet, and the lime gave it a weird sour taste. I tried adding water, which turned it into a cooler/agua fresca but it still had a strange puckery taste. I used the other half of my melons to make a "milky melon" smoothie by simply adding a cup of coconut milk and it tasted much better...creamy like a real smoothie!

Pretty good!  This would be even better if the melon was frozen (I like the suggestion of frozen melon balls).  Or, you could add a few ice cubes.  Other than that, I like it!

This was really refreshing! I used a melon ballet and then froze them. The finished product was way too thick to drink, so I added some water. It was wonderful and my kids liked it too. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I halved the sugar because my fruit was pretty ripe and used a splash of lime juice because I didn't have a fresh lime on hand. Will make this one over and over.
