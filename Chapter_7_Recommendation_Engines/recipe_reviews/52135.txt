Have done this recipe for years, and it *IS* a good one!  My variation...to make ahead of time, the night before; I very lightly butter the bread slices first, use miracle whip, NOT mayo. and I use seasoning salt instead of lemon pepper. I will for sure be trying the lemon pepper though!

Quick, easy, light appetizers. We enjoyed the lemon pepper and cucumber combination. I'd recommend leaving the bread out to soften if you purchase the refrigerated cocktail bread. We used light mayo to make the sandwiches even lighter. I'd even enjoy them open faced, as I didn't  teven see the need for the top slice of bread if you wanted to furhter lighten these up!

I don't even like cucumbers, but they came in the produce box, so I experimented with this recipe for our sunday school brunch. They were so easy and delicious and everyone LOVED them. I didn't change a thing, but I used the WASA rye crackers. I don't know if that's what the original recipe was supposed to use, but that's all my grocery store had. Yummy. I'm taking them for a baby shower this week!

I was trying to figure out something to do with some left over cucumber that I had.  I just straight up made this into a sandwich on wheat bread.  It was surprisingly good!
