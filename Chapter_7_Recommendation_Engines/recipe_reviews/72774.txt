I make these into popsicles during the summer with dixie cups and popsicle sticks. I make it a little different, I  omit the sugar and add a drained can of mandarin oranges and combine everything in my blender. Not only do my kids love them, but so do my husband and I. And all the neighborhood kids. And their friends. :) This also makes a good summer pie. Fold the whipped topping in carefully, pour into a graham cracker crust and stud the top with mandarin oranges. TIP: When making the pops, pour them into dixie cups and freeze them until sturdy, then stick the popsicle sticks in. This way they'll stay put and won't fall over or come out wonky. EDITED AGAIN: I should clarify. You need 20 oz. of orange soda. Not a whole two liter. A whole two liter is excessive. And you know, you don't need a ice cream maker. You can just use your blender. An option you can use as well is fat free condensed milk and whipped topping.

I brought this to an office potluck and every loved the flavor.  I do not have an icecream maker so I used my Kitchen Aid.  I also ised diet soda with fat free cool whip and fat free condensed milk.  I think the texture was a little icy because of this, but it tasted really creamy and delicious.  I had to give the recipe to everyone.  We also discussed that you could modify it and use grape soda or strawberry soda for some variety.  Great recipe.

I tried this recipe and everyone loved it.  I also tried it using diet soda, and the fat free cool whip.  It was good and less calories.  Very easy dessert to make.

I used to make this years ago, but without the Cool Whip. Just used the soda and sweetened condensed milk. My favorite soda to use was A&W Root Beer. Just wonderful and everyone loved it. Sooo easy.

This a very easy recipe - a nice take on orange sherbet. There seems to be no limit to this recipe. The one thing I would not change is the sweetened condensed milk - you definitely need a little richness to avoid an icy result. Thank you Terri!

Good, but very sweet, and I didn't add the 1/4 cup of sugar to the mix.  They taste like creamsicles to us.  I didn't use the 2 liters of Sunkist; I just used about 2 cans and even then my ice cream maker was full to almost overflowing.  I made into popsicles but I'm sure you could make into scoop ice cream and it would work just as well.  Next time I think I will follow tat2whttrash's recommendation to make this in the blender--I don't have a blender, but could use it in my food processor.  Once frozen, these melt pretty quickly so if you need to repackage them, work fast.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only problem I had with this recipe was i didn't have a ice cream maker so I put it in my mixer and and mixed it for awhile but i didn't thicken so I just put them in the cups and let them freeze for a little bit and then added the sticks. They turned out good. I would make them again. And they do taste like a push-up.

It was really good, except I didn't freeze them... I just put them in the freezer for a bit and it was like a slush. I love it! Thanks.

I was skeptical about the orange soda but these were delicious.  I used sweetened and whipped heavy cream in place of the frozen whipped topping because I would rather swap chmicals for calories and quality.

Followed the recipe.  Not a fan.  I thought it tasted nothing like the old push ups.
I used push up molds from Williams Sonoma, it did slide through the molds really well.

BF ate every last drop of this.  Very refreshing on a hot California day.
