Was very salty. If you make this recipe cut down on the beef broth.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe, especially since I thought it sounded good for a quick dinner. Too much tomato in this one.  I like my beef stew in brown gravy.

Quick, easy and wonderfully flexible recipe!  I followed advice of previous reviewers and cut amounts on both broth and beer, and the consistency came out just right.  Also added flour (cut out salt, plenty in broth and tomato sauce/paste) and spice (added curry, my favorite-- See spicy slow-cooker beef stew w/ curry...Mmmm!!) all together in plastic bag and shook to coat. Might leave out the cabbage next time, but it was fine.  Thanks for a cold weather keeper!!

I tried several of the suggestions to this recipe and found it very, very good. I used about 3/8 c flour, 1/2 tbs kosher salt, 1 tbs of freshly ground black pepper & pepper medley. Used two bottles (24 ozs total) of lager beer to give more malty taste. Sub'd 1 10oz can of diced tomatoes with chopped jalapenos for the can of tomato sauce, but kept the paste in. Added 1 tbs of Vindaloo curry, 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, 2 cloves garlic, 2 small chopped vidalia onions, 1 cup of shredded red cabbage, 1 16 oz package of frozen Italian blend veggies, 2 bay leaves, maybe 1 1/2 c diced potatoes, used olive oil for the oil called for. I would call the result a thickened soup; not quite a stew, but without adding any cornstarch or flour roux (beyond the floured meat to start), I thought it thickened up nicely. Thanks to the originator of this recipe and all who contributed other ideas.

Too much tomato for us but otherwise a nice thick stew! Next time I'll have less tomato and add more salt. I also added some garlic and all purpose seasoning. That helped add some flavor to it! :)

I read previous reviews, and NO, it is NOT too salty!!  In fact, I needed to add a ton.  I substituted frozen veg for canned and I added 1/2 a minced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  It was really missing a lot of flavor until I also added a little worshtershire and soy.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. This has got to be one of the best stews we've ever ate (and I'm not a stew person). It was very easy to make and although I added a little bit more spice, it turned out to be great. A huge hit within the family and all our friends!

This tasted so good!  It did come out a bit runny though.. Next time I won't add so much liquid.

I liked this recipe, although it was more like a soup than a stew...there was so much liquid and it was runny, not thick like a stew should be. But, it had great flavor and the whole family liked it! I've made it two or three times now, and there's so much it lasts for at least 2 days!

I'm giving the recipe as written three stars, because it was alright but nothing fantastic. It would actually only be a two-star for me, but I increased it because I omitted all vegetables except potatoes, because I have a picky eater in the house, so some of the just-alrightness could be due to that. Instead of salt in the flour coating, I used garlic powder for a bit of additional flavour. I used about half of the recommended amounts of broth and beer, and omitted the tomato sauce altogether, but it was still quite liquidy. I did increase the tomato paste to about one and two-thirds cans, to try to thicken it and make up for the omitted tomato sauce, but if I make again, I won't do that. It was a tad too tomato-y for my taste. I used Red Stripe beer, which I thought added great flavour (though I wanted to use Guinness, but didn't have any). If I make again, I would definitely add fresh garlic and onion, at the beef-browning stage.

I like this recipe because it is quick, easy and tastes very good. For a quick stew, this is the recipe I would use. And I always bake some cornbread to go with it.

I made several changes due to diet restrictions.  I started with EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) and added chopped onion & garlic when "browning" the beef.  I used a thick Luncheon Steak (the part just above the sirloin cut -- cheaper & just as lean.)  I did not add salt and only used carrots rather than mixed veggies.  (Hubby's preference.)  Since I didn't use flour, I thickened it with a corn starch roux.  Husband loved it!!  Next time I might try No Yolk frozen noodles instead of potatoes or serve it over brown rice.  I can think of several variations for future meals.  But this is a great basic recipe for winter comfort meals.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Whenever I make it the family and the neighbors show up at the door with their bowls.    I usually cook for a crowd so I use 2 lbs. of stew meat, another 12 oz of beer and more tomato sauce to taste.  I like to serve it with warm sourdough bread and real butter.

We liked this.  It was a little on the bland side though - and that was even after I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  (I did use the tomato paste but not the tomato sauce, based on previous reviews, and there was plenty of liquid - tomato sauce would have added too much.)  I think if I had braised the meat for a little longer with some onions, it might have had a better flavor.  But overall it was good and had a nice, warm, "beery" scent (we used Samuel Adams Black Lager).

Definitely a simple recipe and perfect for a chilly Sunday afternoon. We didn't think it was too salty, but it could use some jazzing up with a few herbs/spices and more black pepper. Very tasty with warm beer bread.

This is the recipe for stew I've been looking for! A stick to your bones, warming,comfort food.  I had to add my own variation like I always do.  Added more salt and pepper to taste. Instead of frozen mixed veggies, I added fresh baby carrots, celery, and onions. I also added 2 T corn starch just because I like it thick.  My husband came home from a very hard day and loved it!  I will definitely file this recipe away and make it again often!

This is a great recipe so easy to make and taste wonderful.  Such a great simple recipe that gives you room to add many more great ingredients to your liking.
