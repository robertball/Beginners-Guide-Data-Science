I also halved this recipe and made it in the bread machine...although I accidentally added an extra 2 T. of water...I think it turned out ok.  Anyway, this is a fantastic bread with a small, dense crumb.  It kind of tastes like squaw bread but it definitely doesn't look like it (not as dark as I'm used to).  Still gets 5 stars b/c it's good.  I made it in the bread machine on the wheat setting, medium crust, 2# setting and it was a little dark.  Next time I'll try the 1.5# setting and light crust.

I found this bread to be one of the best I have ever made. It makes wonderful toast and mine sliced beautifully for sandwiches, contrary to what another rater said (she probably did not knead the dough enough, which will make it crumbly).  I like to leave the raisins a little speckled in the bread - too much processing and they disappear.  The sweetness causes the top to become a bit dark, but otherwise I love this bread! It slices well and makes wonderful toast.

YUM!! I made this recipe in my bread machine by cutting the ingredients in 1/2 and changing the order around slightly... now it's just about the only one that I make!

A dense, hearty grain bread.  Don't skimp on the kneading time, it is vital for the texture of the finshed loaf.  I kneaded mine longer than the directions called for (about 20min), since the dough was so sticky at the start.  I didn't add any extra flour, just coated my hands a few times, and kneaded some more!  Next time I make this, I will add more raisins, their flavor was very subtle.

Not a "sandwich bread" as such. Definitely a bread to be served with a meal or savoured warmed, by itself, brushed with just a touch of butter, and served with a cup of steaming hot chocolate. My kids first thought it was cake (though it is defintely not a traditional cake texture). We had to make second batch just have some left for ourselves. Marvelous bread. One of our family favorites & we make lots of different kinds of breads.

This is a pretty good bread.  Next time I would bake at 350...the top got a bit too brown before the bread was done.  The crumb wasn't as dark as I wanted.  I might increase the raisins next time.  You don't need 3 T of butter, just a tad brushed over the surface is fine.

Compact, dense bread with plenty of grain flavor. Can be sliced thin!  This is a "keeper" recipe!

I made half the recipe into 3 mini loaves (in tinfoil loaf pans). I used 1/4 c. ground flax + 1/2 c. whole wheat flour in place of 3/4 c. of all purpose flour (using just 1/2 c. of all purpose). I let the dough rise for well over 2 hours on the first rise and about 2 hours in the loaf pans for the second rise. The loaves rose well, and they taste terrific. I can taste the sweetness of the raisins and the honey, and the bread is really soft (but pretty dense). I really like this recipe, but I think it should be noted that the name is pretty offensive and should probably be changed.

This bread turned out beautifully!  As with any type of yeast bread, it took much of the day to make, but it was worth it!  The only problem that I ran into was that I had to keep adding flour and the dough never really pulled away from the sides of the bowl. I just floured my hands when handling it so that they wouldn't stick and it turned out fine.  I would definately make it again!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! The time it takes is definitely worth it. I always make a double batch so that I actually have some left for the next day.   Add a little extra yeast to make it a bit fluffier - 1 tsp. (1 pkg yeast = about 1 tbsp active dry yeast).  I make this into 4 round loaves (so 8 from a double batch) and cut crosses in the top. I also top them with oatmeal, steel cut or old fashioned, after I butter the top, before baking.

Made 1/2 the recipe and made one large round. I didn't use my bread maker. Just used my stand mixer. This is a bread that we used to make in the bakery.  Very good taste.  If you don't like the taste of raisins, soak the raisins before you grind them.  Awesome bread.

Just ho-hum.  There was not enough salt for the amount of bread that was made.  It did not raise very much for me.  I'll try other recipes.

Very dense, and a bit sweet.  I made 1/2  a recipe and baked it in a loaf pan instead of making a round loaf.  It does make decent toast, but it is pretty dense so it's a bit chewy.  Nice and flavorful though.  I love whole grain breads, so this gets a thumbs up from me.  Bf probably not so much, but his opinion will have to wait since I tried this one for breakfast (he wasn't up) and froze the remainder of the loaf for later.  thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good, heavy bread.  It makes great toast.  We love it.  I substituted 1 1/2 c of a flax/oatmeal mix for the rye flour.  Very good, fiber rich.

Pretty good bread. I don't like rye so I used more wheat flour in place of the rye flour and it turned out good...just a little different from the breads I usually make.

A good bread, worked fine in my bread machine (I always bake in oven though), But it wasn't the dark hearty bread like the ones served in restaurants or the squaw bread I buy at the market.

While this tastes really good toasted with a bit of applebutter or jelly on it, it's a really REALLY heavy, dense bread. If you're looking for something lighter, skip this one. But if you're looking for a sweet and tasty whole wheat type bread, give this a try.

While this bread has wonderful flavor, I have made it twice with good and active yeast, but neither time has it risen properly.  Since other reviewers don't seem to have had this problem, I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.

I've been looking for this type of bread since experiencing the Squaw Bread from St. Augustine's Whole Earth Bakery. This recipe comes very close to their bread. I'll be tweaking this recipe - the secret is in the pureed raisin mixture and molasses. Very much worth making!

I was first given this bread as a gift basket item.  My son who does not like dark or whole wheat breads just loved it and my friend used to make it for him. When we moved across country she gave the recipe to me.  I have mad this recipe since then and everyone who tastes it just loves it.  I don't think it is intended to rise to quite double since it is a slightly denser type bread. We just love it!!

My husband just loves this bread.  He requests it all the time.  actually had to buy a long slot toaster so he could fit a whole slice off the round loaf in at once.  (cutting it in half didn't do it for him must be)

Most successful rye recipe I've used. Only changes I made was to let rise twice as long and knead twice as long as instructed, very pleased with result! Thanks!

Really great recipe.  I also halved the recipe and did it on my bread machine, wheat setting, light crust.  Very dense heavy loaf, but yummy.
