I am sceptical of trying new recipes, but I thought I would give it a chance so my husband and I could have something new and different. I can't tell you enough how wonderful this recipe was. I made a few minor changes though. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper, and used the 98% fat free low sodium cream of chicken soup. It was so good my husband said to make sure to add that recipe to our recipe box.... WE LOVED IT......

I altered the recipe quite a bit. After sprinkling garlic powder and black pepper on each chicken breast, I spooned about 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce on them, then sprinkled a combo of mozzerella and Parmesan cheeses, topped it with a box of stove top chicken stuffing and then used the butter. I baked it for 1 hour at 325 and it was delicious!

What a great, EASY recipe! I did alter it a little. I sprinkled the chicken with cajun spices and used Cream of Mushroom soup (didn't have cream of chicken). Used a few more slices of chees and added chicken broth to the stuffing mixture. My EXTREMELY picky eaters ate every last bite and wanted more! This will be a regular in our house. Cheap, quick, easy and DELICIOUS!
Thanks for posting this!

This was pretty good, but I think I would change some things next time. I had planned on seasoning the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, but I forgot... it was fine, but I would definitely do it next time. I checked on the casserole halfway through cooking and didn't like how the half of stuffing on top was totally crisp (read: hard as a rock). So, I poured a can of chicken broth over the top and covered it with foil for the rest of the baking time. This worked well, but I probably shouldn't have used the whole can as I ended up with some mushy stuffing at the bottom. I think this would also be good with a layer of green beans on the bottom. The best part of this was that the chicken was EXTREMELY moist and cut with a fork. I don't know if the chicken broth did that or not, but either way, it was very nicely cooked. I had to cook mine for 50 minutes (25 minutes w/ foil on top). Thanks for the recipe, I'll be trying it again soon. :)

omg I love Allrecipes! Rush home from work, still in high heels throw frozen chicken into microwave and rice into cooker,  type "chicken" and "cheddar cheese" into Ingredients finder, find this recipe - yup - basic pantry ingredients - throw it together according to recipe using slices of cheddar and mozzarella. Toss melted butter and stuffing mix (Stove Top for Turkey, already crushed) and spread over top. Throw it into oven, drive daughter to Dance, return and cook frozen veggies, and voila! Dinner is ready! Serve two hungry boys, watch them wolf it down, listen to their rave reviews, pick daughter up from Dance, kick off heels, pour a glass of wine and dig in- cheers! Thanks for a tasty, easy, simple recipe!

I loved it and my family including my 18 month old ate it and loved it.  I think it might be better to cook the stuffing that you sprinkle on top first but either way it is very good!

I thought this recipe was awesome!  I followed the advice of others on here and I mixed the bread crumbs with both butter and chicken broth.  It turned out great and the whole family enjoyed it.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This meal could be cooked in 1/2 the time. Cut your chicken into smaller chunks, fry in pan with butter and all your favorite seasonings. Add mushroom soup and stuffing. Cheese on top and cover until melted. We like to add extras for change like mushrooms, snap peas, peppers or anything in the fridge.

I made this pretty much as written.  The only changes I made was to season the chicken with salt and pepper, and I made my own stuffing using fresh breadcrumbs that I dried overnight.  They came out with the perfect amount of crunch.  I didn't add broth as others did but I think if I ever made this recipe using boxed stuffing the broth would be a good addition as the bread in boxed stuffing is much drier than the bread was in my own homemade stuffing.  I look forward to making this again!

We really loved this!  I used a circular dish instead.  I poured the soup all over the chicken and then topped it with grated cheddar cheese, then the stuffing. As others reviewed I used about half a can of chicken broth and the melted butter. Then covered with foil for the first half of the baking.  It was crunchy on top and sooo moist.  I served it over egg noodles.  Thanks for this it's a keeper!!

Very very salty. I'd use low sodium cream of chicken soup next time and see if it cuts down on the salt. We also like Swiss cheese with chicken better than Cheddar.

This recipe was great!  It's nice to find a new take on chicken and stuffing.  I did add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to chicken breast before adding toppings.  I also used provolone cheese instead of cheddar.  The chicken was moist, and the cheesy, yet crunchy texture was wonderful.  I would suggest that you make sure to crush most of the stuffing as the recipe says.  Thanks for this recipe.

Looking for something different to do with chicken, I came across this recipe.  My husband is a VERY picky eater, especially when it comes to chicken.  I gave this a try and he loved it!  Actually made me put the leftovers away so he could have it for lunch next day.  Will definately be a repeater in this household!!

This really was fine but not fantastic. Great way to use boxed stuffing mix and if you're in a hurry not a bad option.

This was delicious and so easy! Like many others, I seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper, garlic and onion powder. I also added a little bit of chicken stock to the bottom and used shredded monterey jack (all I had) and also used italian bread crumbs on top instead of stuffing mix. Moist, yummy and my three year old daughter ate it all up!

My family LOVED this recipe but I tweaked it quite a bit. I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, cayenne and black pepper (to taste) to the chicken soup (heated to blend thoroughly). Over the chicken I added no-salt seasoning and garlic powder. I shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese over the chicken and crushed French's Fried Onions over the cheese (my family dislikes stuffing). This was a major hit and my husband was happy with the spices I used! Crowd pleaser and SUPER simple recipe for ingredients most families have in their pantry.

I knew this was going to be a quick and easy meal, not a gourmet one, but i was still pretty dissappointed in the flavor of this. I used cream of celery soup, which really added to it.  I took anothers suggestion to add some broth to the mix, and it think it was overkill.  It was a mushy stuffing rather than partly crispy.

I made this tonight for the first time, and it definitely lives up to it's name. The only change I made was to use sliced provolone cheese because that is what I had on hand. My husband thought it was delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes, baby carrots, and crusty french bread. Wonderful!

Delicious! Seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, pepper, and paprika. Also substitued fat free or reduced fat ingredients and eliminated the butter. Poured chicken broth over the stuffing. Everyone loved it! Will def make again.

Very very good. I didn't vary the recipe by choice, just didn't have cheddar slices on hand, so I used 4-cheese Mexican mix cheese. Even my 3-yr old (not a picky eater, admittedly) was "fighting" for the extra "toppings" that had spilled off the chicken into the pan. We will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Looks can be decieving-even cooked, and this didn't look pretty.  But close your eyes and take a bite, it is suprisingly tasty.  I used shredded cheese.

Scrumptious indeed! I've made this same recipe with Swiss cheese and actually prefer it.  But it just goes to show, you can make this recipe with whatever cheese or soup you happen to have in the pantry, and it will turn out just fine.

We really like it and it's easy to prepare.  It isn't quick as some people stated because it takes an hour to bake.  However, it's great for a thrown together meal when you have other things to do around the house.  I would love to try a crock pot version!

This was pretty good, I'd make it again.  I used shredded cheddar instead of slices and I added a little chicken broth to the stuffing that was surrounding the chicken.  I baked the chicken for 50 minutes and it came out just right.  Not a meal for company, but tasty and easy.

I loved this recipe so much, I had to make it for my family when I went home to visit! I made it in a smaller dish so that the chicken was completely covered by the soup and the cheese.

This was really simple and still had big flavors. Only change I made was using shredded cheddar instead of a slice, mostly cause it was what I had on hand. I think I will add a bit more butter to the top next time or mix the stuff with a bit first as some parts were still very crumbly and hard

This was really very good. I did put the chicken in the dish and then just spread the soup all over the top. Used shredded cheese like some others. Also used spray butter to make sure stuffing evenly covered. Couldn't have been easier. Will definitely make this again.

Very tasty and very easy. I made it with stove top stuffing and margarine, and first seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder and paprika. The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I wasn't crazy about the crispy/crunchy topping although my husband loved it. Plus, I found the whole taste very rich, so next time I will use chicken stock and not margarine over the stuffing and I will not pre-season the chicken. But still a very good recipe.

We really liked this one. I altered it a bit -- I didn't have cream of chicken so used cream of mushroom and crushed potato chips instead of stuffing mix. You could probably fore go the melted butter if you wanted to keep the fat grams down, but we didn't and it was delicious. We served it over rice with peas. Very good.

This was astonishingly simple and tasty. The only suggestion I would have is to use the family size soup (26 oz). It seemed to be the right proportion to keep the stuffing moist.

I used sliced Cheddar cheese, and Cream of Mushroom soup instead. It was surprisingly good! I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because the chix breats really need some seasoning before cooking, and the topping slid off mine when they were cut into, but , what can you do!! Will definitely make this again!

This was a very good and easy recipe!  I used fat free cream of chicken soup, tasted fine.  I also used bread crumbs and then seasoned them myself (that's what I had in the cupboard).  I'm making this one again.

A huge thumbs up, here's the changes I made. I used cream of cheddar, and fried up some celery and onion to stir in with the stuffing mix to slightly soften. Garlic powder to taste with the fried mixture, salt and pepper (or whatever spices you desire, really) in the soup. Baked until done, then added the cheese on top and flipped the oven off to let melt. Might sound like a lot of cheddar taste, but trust me, SO GOOD. Served it with some asparagus, no leftovers

This was easy, yummy, and I would make it again. I added a few extra things, including sliced mushrooms. Added pineapple chunks, and wished I hadn't! Made this for a big event serving 100 people. set up recipe to feed 125. It was ALL gone! Great, thanks. AllRecipe.com is my go-to site for  great food ideas and recipies for all size events. Great that you can just ask for the quantity of people and the recipe adjusts. Saves me a ton of time, when I do my monthly large events.

This dish was not a favorite at our house. Two voted yes and three voted no. I loved the ease of making it and thought it was good myself. I think if I tried it again I would use chicken gravy instead of soup and moisten up the stuffing a little before baking.

Hardly any prep time and soooooo easy. My wife loved the sauce. It's a very good recipe. My changes: I used pepper jack cheese and Panko bread crumbs and turned on the broiler at the end to brown the bread crumbs. Yum.

I'm not sure if it was the stuffing mix I used or what, but I found this dish to be very salty.  I didn't notice the cheese as doing anything for the dish.  The chicken and the cream of chicken part were very tasty though.   I may try this again at some point with a different brand and type of stuffing .  As of now, I unfortunately can't really say it was that wonderful of a recipe.

I made a couple variations out of convenience. I couldn't find bl/sl chicken breasts at the Save-A-Lot so I opted for 8 chicken tenderloin cuts and topped them with cream of mushroom soup (CoC also unavailable) and topped with a can of drained french-cut green beans to make it "healthier". I shredded a block of sharp cheddar over the top and followed the recipe as written from that point on, with a little bit of extra water for the stuffing. I was concerned that the chicken was too smothered and wouldn't cook all the way in the recommended time, but it came out perfect! I will keep this recipe around.

i really enjoyed this recipe. i changed it only very slightly. i sprinkled pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. i used shredded cheddar cheese and put that on before the soup rather than after. i also two full boxes of Stovetop brand chicken stuffing to make a thick layer at the top. make sure not to moisten the stuffing too much with the butter, the first time i made this it was nowhere near as crunchy as i would have liked because i moistened the stuffing too much.

This was delicious!  My husband, who does not like chicken that much, loved it! I took the suggestions in the comments and made sure I seasoned the chicken before I added the rest of the ingredients: Cream of Mushroom/Roasted Garlic, American cheese (all I had), Savory Herb Stove Top stuffing. I poured chicken broth (before the melted butter) on the stuffing which made it more moist. The casserole cooked uncovered for 45 minutes and the chicken was nicely cooked- & moist!

The only changes I made were I used shredded cheese and regular bread crumbs. I have to say, this was one of the best tasting meals I have ever had. It tasted like chicken casserole, only better. My family was in the mood for something simple and easy to eat, and man, did it hit the spot. I can't wait to make it again. During cooking all the toppings slid off, but it was no big deal - I just selected a piece of chicken, then scooped up some topping and laid it on top. SO SO GOOD!!!

Loved this!  I just made a tiny change of using shredded cheddar cheese.  This is a house favorite.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yuck!  Found it very dry (due to 6oz pkg of stuffing mix).  I would recommend preparing stuffing with bells & whistles (celery, onion, etc) and possibly pouring some chicken broth over stuffing mixture.  Reminds me of one of those new "one bake" meals.  Might even consider more than one can of "cream of chix soup."  Didn't finish eating and leftovers straight to trash.  Sorry Ginny!
