it was ok. I think it would have been better with a little milk instead of the broth. It wasnt creamy at all. I liked the spices in it though.

I made these for dinner with some roast chicken and garlic rosemary green beans and they were such a hit I had to double the recipe so we could all eat a mountain of them. My husbands eyes lit up when he tried them and he said they were the best mashed potatoes he had ever eaten. Also I only had about half the spices and they were still delish.

Too many spices! I suggest cutting the spices in half even if you are using more potatoes (I used 8). I would also add some cream and butter along with the broth.

These had a lttle too much flavor! I used small potatos, which could have been the issue. I would suggest cutting the spices in half or using medium to large potatoes. I served it with cheesy meatloaf and italian green beans.

I will omit the vegetable broth and use milk instead when I try this again.

I am very lactose intolerant and this was a great option to avoid milk or cream. The spices added a lot of great flavor and you could easily alter the spices you use to suit your meal or your family’s tastes. I did add a little bit of lactose free margarine (Blue Bonnet makes a lactose free stick form) to lend some creaminess to the final product. I melted the margarine, stirred in the spices, and then added it to the potatoes with the veggie broth while I was mashing them. I normally make my mashers with lactose free milk, however, I liked these better and you could easily use chicken or turkey broth if you don’t have veggie broth available.

I used HEATED chicken broth, cut back on the rosemary, thyme and sage to a pinch (rosemary and thyme can tend to overpower dishes, I didn't want them to be the primary flavor) and increased the garlic. Paired well with my Kicky Barbeque Meatballs.

Made these for my husband and they were good he said! i even snuck a taste even though i dont eat potatoes anymore. I cut recipe in half and followed as written omitting the rosemary and sage based on husbands preference and used chicken broth instead because i had some in fridge i had to use up. I heated up my broth as well so i wasn't adding it in cold. It was a nice change from a regular mash. Also chose to keep mine on the chunky side. I was told adding some butter to this would make it a 5 star.

Disappointed. I think it was just an overkill on the herbs. I'm going to try my own variety & see how that goes.

Far too many spices. I like that the recipe doesn't use any dairy, but definitely would cut down on the spices. Should have read the other comments first...
