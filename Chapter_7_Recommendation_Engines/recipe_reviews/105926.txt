This was absolutely delicious! The mint added such a wonderful flavor. The dressing is way too much for the amount of veggies, though, so I used two very large cucumbers, doubled the rest of the veggies and the herbs, and added a green bell pepper (or you could just halve the dressing, but I was making this as a main dish, and I wanted leftovers to take to work for lunch). The dressing is more like a paste after you mix it up, but don't worry--it thins as you toss it with the veggies, but it takes a few minutes of stirring (I would recommend not seeding the cukes, so you'll have more liquid). This is a new favorite!

Loved the vegetable combination, but the tahini dressing was a thick lump of paste.  I added additional olive oil and lemon juice but it still remained thick and difficult to combine with the salad.  Flavor just so-so.  I think I'll make the vegetable combination again but use a different dressing.

I loved the veggie combination!  The tahini, if fresh is a really nice consistancy and the flavours meld nicely with the lemon and olive oil.   I did add a dollop of balkan style yogurt to the dressing which i then spooned over falafels.  YUM

I like the combination of flavors, but the tahini "dressing" really is too think to be a dressing (it's more like a paste).  I was frustrated by the tahini dressing when I made this, but I liked the flavor in it so I did what another reviewer suggested and added yogurt hoping that would help with the consistency. For my single portion I added 3/4 tbsp. of low fat yogurt and that really helped. This has nice flavors so it's definitely worth a try and I ended up enjoying the whole salad very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

It came out perfectly for me.
I cut the recipes in half and instead of draining my can of tahini, I used the liquid as a base for the salad dressing. I have other uses for tahini, so the thick paste that was left over in the can is no problem for me. 
Very interesting taste! I gotten sick of bland salads and wanted to try something new.
Great recipe!
