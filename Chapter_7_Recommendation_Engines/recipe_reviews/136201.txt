Everyone loved it!  I bake a lot from scratch and it was nice to be done in about 10 min and get such rave reviews.. and be ready to hand out the recipe.

Wow, these are super simple but so delicious! I like that they can be put together so quickly and storing them in the freezer for a quick snack, even better! Will be using this recipe often. Thanks!

Good, not exceptional. On the plus side it's very easy to put together and I think it would be a fun and safe (no oven) treat for kids to help make.
