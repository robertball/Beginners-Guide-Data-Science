After reading the wonderful reviews, I was anxious to try this recipe.  I prepared it exactly as described, and marinated it for 3 1/2 hours- ample time for the flavors to delevop, according to the recipe guidelines.  I LOVE garlic & I LOVE beer, so this sounded terrific!  I was actually rather disappointed. The beer flavor was very subtle, and I used a fairly robust brew.  The garlic was nice, but I'd have increased it a bit if I'd known how flat (no pun intended!) the overall dish would be.  It was alright, certainly edible. We were planning to eat these as an appetizer.   I also prepared an old standby recipe that evening (shrimp skewered with bacon & marinated in teriyaki sauce, then grilled) and those were a HUGE hit!  The beer shrimp sadly languished on the plate...

They might be better as part of a dish, like in shrimp tacos with other zippy ingredients.  I really wanted to like these!  So simple, and two of my favorite flavors. Just not anything remarkable, according to the friends we served them to.

Followed exact.  Used the outdoor grill.  Best grilled shrimp I've ever had.  Sometimes less is more.  Simple ingredients.  You can't go wrong with beer and garlic.

This simple marinade is wonderful...don't need another thing! Skewer together 6 or 8 to add to a steak BBQ. Cooked and peeled shrimp do equally as well, just cook til hot!

SO EASY! Followed the recipe exactly! Just used a regular lite beer and put a heaping tablespoon of jarred garlic and they came out perfect. Squeeze a little lemon on before serving if you like lemon! I did skewer the shrimp and put directly on the grill, which I think gives a little more smoky flavor but you need to stand there and watch them They don't take long to cook!

I have to admit I knew I would like this- but I didn't expect to love it as much as I did! Even my husband who doesn't care for shrimp ate two whole skewers of them! So delicious and so simple! The only thing I did different was sprinkle them with a little garlic salt right before they went on the grill as I hadn't marinated quite two hours and was afraid the garlic flavor hadn't infused. Make sure you use a beer you like cause the beer flavor is really prevalent. This recipe has me wondering what else I can marinate in beer and garlic cause the flavor combo is amazing!! Thanks so much Gale!

These were great and simple. We added a touch of tabasco sauce to the marinade to give it a little kick.

Sorry to rate poorly, but this really needed more flavour but specifically something sweet to counter the bitterness of the beer. All my shrimp tasted bitter...so I ended up dipping in a sweet thai chili sauce and this is coming from a girl who doesn't really have a sweet tooth. It just needs that to counter balance.

Very bland by themselves.  Followed recipe exactly, using Sam Adams Boston Lager and 1/2 of a small bulb of garlic.  The kids and I enjoyed it greatly with Heinz spicy cocktail sauce.  Husband preferred sprinkling on Old Bay.  These would have been very good served cold, but there weren't any leftovers.

This was the BEST grilled shrimp we have had yet!!!  I used TECATE for the beer and doubled the recipe as I used the jumbo shrimp.  I also added 1 cup of lemom juice to it.  It was delicious!!!

I thought this would be really good, but there flavor did not develop enough for me after an hour of marinating. I will try this again and marinade longer and use peeled shrimp

I wasn't sure what the results would be with this recipe but I was pleasantly surprised. I used what I consider to be a low-medium quality light beer and a bit more garlic than the recipe called for. I marinated the garlic for several hours. I salt and peppered them before putting on the grill and gave them a squeeze of fresh lemon, the results were yummy. Next time I will use a higher quality summer ale because you can really taste the beer, which is a good thing. Thanks, Gale!

Delicious!  Didn't change a thing. Used Guinness beer and it was fantastic.  I agree with another reviewer that sometimes less it more.  Great recipe, Gale.  Thanks for sharing!

Simple, yes, but not spectacular.  Grilling with the shells on cements the shells to the shrimp in some cases.  Also very messy to peal and eat because of the debris from grilling.

Shrimp is always good and this is a simple and easy recipe.  I only marinated it for two hours so that may be why the flavor the beer/garlic imparted was very slight, so perhaps if I marinated it longer it would have not been so bland.

I used this recipe to marinate Publix 5 each 5 shrimp skewers in a Ziploc and then cooked them on a Traeger gill at about 400F for six minutes and turned about half way. Sprinkled Old Bay on right after putting on the grill. Served with grilled zuc spears (EVOO and Grillmate started skin side down, 15 minutes ahead of the shrimp) and yellow Uncle Ben's microwave rice made a great meal for the two of us. So easy I didn't even feel like it was my night to cook
