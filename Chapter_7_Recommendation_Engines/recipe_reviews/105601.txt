I'm eating this right now, and it's quite good.  I did make a few changes however.  I didn't add any salt, because the soy sauce made it salty enough.  I didn't have white wine vinegar, but used brown rice vinegar.  I think this made it taste very good.  I also added a very small amount of garlic powder to the sauce.

This was very good, easy and healthy. It was a bit salty but I think it was because I doubled the vinegar and soy sauce to account for the extra crab meat I had. Also I dipped Wheat Thins into the salad which also had salt on them. I added a little bit of ground ginger. I will make this regularly especially in the summer. I think it would be good as a dip with cream cheese and avocado (there goes the healthy part). I am looking for suggestions of how other people served this salad.

Update: I have made this a couple times now and each time I reduce the soy sauce and vinegar. The crab and cuke at the bottom of the dish get very strong soy sauce/vinegar taste from soaking up the juices. It becomes too strong to eat if it has sat for 1 to 2 days or so. So watch out how much you use.

This is actually pretty good. I think I will add some garlic powder and green onion next time, but a good place to start. Not the "prettiest" dish, since the soy makes the crab and cukes brown, but still tasty!

This is a nice alternative to the mayo-based crab salad and it is very easy to make.  I added an avocado and toasted sesame seeds to the mix, served them in lettuce leaves as wraps and some people chose to add wasabi for a little kick.  It was pretty and yummy!

Light, delicious, and healthy.  I left out the soy sauce completely.  Good with shrimp but better with crab.

Didn't particularly care for this recipe. I think it would have been better with just rice wine vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar and soy sauce combination.

Made this up and wasn't really impressed. Not really sure on what I would change to make it better but I just wouldn't give this one a try unless you like the very simple flavors.

This wasn't bad, but it should be eaten the day you make it. I felt by day two and three it wasn't that great.

I added some wasabi and it was much improved.  Very simple and quick, a great appetizer.
