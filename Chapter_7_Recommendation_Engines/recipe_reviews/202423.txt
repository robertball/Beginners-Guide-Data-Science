These were really good. I didn't make them vegetarian, I used real ground hamburger. I didn't have pepper jack cheese so I just used a colby-mont. jack blend. I will be making these again!! I wanted more after they were gone.

Wow these were perfect. I was looking for a light, summer, vegetarian lunch. I sauteed some onion and 1 clove of garlic in EVOO and chili powder. Then I added red and yellow bell pepper. I put 2 vegan Boca burger patties in the micro for a few seconds to thaw and added them to the veggie mixture in the cast iron skillet. I added 1/6 of a packet of McCormick's Taco Seasoning & a few dashes of Red Devil Hot Sauce. I stuffed my peppers with this mixture and topped with cheddar cheese. This was an amazing lunch, it had so much flavor. Next time I will add mexican rice and I bet it will be even better. I'm still licking my lips, it was that good.

Great! My husband (vegetarian) and I (meat eater) loved this recipe. I served it with rice and beans and it was a complete, filling and tasty meal. I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I sauted chopped onion, chopped jalepenos, some chopped garlic, 1/2 a chopped red bell pepper - added all this to the vege crumbles and threw in some fresh cilantro at the end - excellent and fresh~

Quick, easy and delicious recipe. I sauteed a chopped onion with the vegetarian crumbles and I used taco seasoning and Hot Chili Powder to season it. I did some with cheese and some without cheese. My family topped them with salsa. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yet another example of how simple, healthy cooking can be delicious, satisfying, and downright elegant. Along with the packaged seasoning, I added a splash of cayenne, oregano, and basil to the TVP. I through in some spinach and zucchini as well. I can't wait to serve this at a party!

To get the most out of the poblano, cut in half, seed, bake cut side down in 400 oven til the skin starts to char, or hold over gas flame on stove til it starts  to blacken and char.   Let cool and add your filling.   The peppers will be softer to work with, but I find that the flavour is superior to boiling away the goodness!    Really yummy,..ole!!!

Excellent!!! And easy too! Made this for my family tonight some vegetarians and some meat eaters, all loved it.  I did add some things though, sauteed some onions with the crumbles, added black beans, salsa and chili powder to the mixture then topped it all with the pepper jack.

YUMMY... We do Meatless Mondays in our house and this was a nice dish to prepare for the tradition. I bought the Boca soy meat and with the chili packaging it was just as good as using ground turkey or beef! I did add jalapenos, red peppers and onions to the mix for some extra flavoring and I like the way it turned out. This is a pretty easy dish!!

I was skeptical but this dish was flavorful and easy to make.  I'll probably make it again.  I roasted the peppers before stuffing them and baking them and I topped them with some shredded cheddar.

I did add steak fajita strips, oinions, spanish rice, for the filling and quesadilla cheese to the top....I broiled the last few minutes to melt the quesa cheese.  I need to cube the strips next time since it would help when eating.  I like the simplicity of cooking the peppers.

Luckily I added a little more seasoning to the stuffing before I stuffed them. The final product was pretty good, but I tasted the "meat" before I gave it some extra seasoning and didn't care for it.

These were pretty good. The soy crumbles were pretty good to. I use the sargento low fat pepper jack cheese to make them a little healthier

This recipe was excellent, but a little bit on the spicy side for my kids.  For the filling, I started by sauteing onions for 3 minutes, added in the burger crumbles with 2 10 ounce cans of mild Rotel.  Once this mixture was hot, I stirred in a cup or two of cooked rice.  This filling was enough to fill 5 or 6  poblano peppers.  I then topped with cheddar cheese.  The only additional change I will make next time is to halve the amount of chili seasoning I add to the mix.  Overall though, really enjoyed this recipe.

I served these with Spicy Slow Cooker Black Bean Soup for a vegetarian meal.  They were the right sort of dish, but were just so-so.  If I made them again, I'd make a more substantial filling with rice, onions, etc.

Fast, easy, and great tasting.  Thanks for this healthy veggie meal.  I made some additions and changes, only because I only had 1 poblano.  I used green and red bell peppers.  In the crumble I added one whole onion, added plenty of salt and pepper, garlic, and cajun spice.  The cheese makes this dish perfect.

This was the first time I used the veggie "meat" and it turned out great! It's a little hard to get to the "crumbly" stage, but the texture with the spices really made it difficult to distinguish from real hamburger. I also steamed brown rice to add to the filling mixture, to make it more filling, and that takes an hour, so get that started FIRST. I had to boil the peppers for about 10 minutes to get them to soften. I shared this meal with a pregnant, vegetarian neighbor....and it was enjoyed by all! :) I will definitely try more vegetarian recipes, since this one was so tasty! THANKS!

This was really good! My husband eats meat and I'm a vegetarian so I'm always trying to make things that we'll both enjoy. He loves stuffed peppers and I'd never had them before so I decided to give this a shot. Instead of using a chili seasoning pack I used our nacho seasoning which is chili powder, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne. I also use more pepper jack than called for and mix it in with the morning star vegetarian crumbles. My husband says he can barely tell that it's not real meat! Delicious and easy, thanks!

Great recipe. I altered it a bit though. First, I didn't use the vege crumbles and instead doubled-up the rice and added sliced green peppers. Topped with feta cheese instead of pepperjack, and doused a little hot sauce on top of each one. Delicious!

The hardest part of this recipe was finding poblano peppers. Ended up finding and using a pasilla pepper - worked great. I was curious to try the veg crumbles too, and was surprised at their flavor. Will definitely make this recipe again as a break from our regular protein diet. Next will serve with a dollop of sour cream on the side - would go perfect with this!

For the most part, complete as it is if you like mild. I kicked it up a bit by adding 1/2 jar Monterey Jack Queso dip and three seeded and chopped Serrano peppers at the end of cooking the crumbles. Also added 5m to the oven time.

Your stuffed poblanos will be vastly improved if you char the outsides first over a gas range until fully blistered, then placed in a sealed plastic bag to peel.  Skip the boiling.  Then stuff and bake.  Recommend taco seasoning mix rather than chili.  I freeze at this point and pop them out to take for lunch with a slice of low-fat cheese to broil at work, then top with chopped cilantro

I liked these alot. I don't think I pre-cooked the poblanos long enough, though because the skin was a bit tough. The flavor was amazing, so will definitely make these again.

I love this. It's easy and delicious and still tastes good reheated the next day. Sometimes I add some sauteed onions and corn to the crumbles for some extra flavor.

So we like meat and we changed this up a bit/lot. we did hamburger and taco seasoning and mixed that with brown rice and added chopped tomatoes. stuffed the peppers and topped with colby/jack cheese... YUM!!!
