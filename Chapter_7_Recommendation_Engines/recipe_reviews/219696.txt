These are tasty little cookies with just the right amount of spice.  I love crunchy cookies so I baked them the full 12 minutes and they came out perfect.  I’ll be making these again.

Kids and I were super excited to shop then prepare this cookie. It turned out the consistancy of sand and didn't bind at all. Rolling it was out of the question. Best bet was making small patties then using a cookie cutter- we followed directions exactly!!!- after the baking was done we had a super hard, super sweet, super sweet smelling biscuit that actually was good for dipping in tea and not much else. Very disappointing. Wonder where we went wrong?

Fantastic spiced sugar cookie!  Just what I've been looking for!!!  Tip: use real butter and make sure both egg and butter are room temp to prevent separating.  Roll out between parchment paper with a little powdered sugar to keep from sticking.  Lastly, freeze cut-out cookies for ~15 mins before baking to help retain the shape.  I really, really like this recipe and the versatility it seems to provide, as seen in the other comments.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Fun recipe, very easy to make, and perfect for cookie cutters.  The only thing I would change is adding a little bit more spice but thats just a personal preference as the cookies are delicious as per the recipe.

Super easy, great tasting cookie! This is the nice, simple Christmas cut out recipe I have been looking for. I rolled them out 1/4 inch thickness because we like our cookies chewy, but other than that I stayed to the recipe! Will be a holiday staple from now on.

Normally, the sugar cookies would be the last cookies consumed, so thought it would be ok to change the old recipe with this one.  This Christmas, these cookies where one of the first to run out!!  I don't have any tips for these cookies, they came out perfect.

I made this as it said with real butter, those of you who had trouble with it binding may be used margarine and sometimes it will come out like sand if it's mainly a butter and sugar ingredient cookie like this one is and shortbread.   It's the vegetable oil in the margarine and water that's the culprit.   I had it come out perfect and love the nutmeg. Super quick and easy cookie to whip up and dough can be made a few days ahead which for Christmas baking is a time saver.   Love the cookie. Thanks for submitting. It's my new favourite for the holidays.

Great flavor!  I made these with a Mickey Mouse cutter for a surprise snack on our recent visit to Disney World.  They went very quickly.  I will definitely make them again -- though I will make them thicker next time.  The 1/8" recommended in the directions made the cookie too thin and crisp for me.

very yummy, I used a gluten free flour, which is naturally dryer, so you don't have to refridgerate, you just flour your surface and roll and cut.  I also used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. Love love love this recipe!! thanks :)

Great recipe! I rolled the dough out thin to make very crispy cookies, and added ground ginger since I didn't have nutmeg or cloves. It made a truly sweet and spice cookie.

These cookies were really good. They were a nice switch form a 'traditional' sugar cookie. That is they were different then I expected in a better way.

these were really tasty and worked well for x-mas roll out cookies.  timing in oven depends on how thin you roll your cookie- so watch closely.  will use this recipe again for sure.

These cookies are amazing!! Not too sweet, but not a cardboard icing delivery receptacle. They are perfect! They cook up with a golden, crunchy bottom while still maintaining a soft, chewy inside. Ridiculously good!

It was pretty good, but I should have read through it. I didn’t know that I was to form it to a ball and keep in fridge for a couple hours. I was super busy, so I ended up not making it till the next day. Other than that, I used Christmas cookie cutters and iced it.

Great cut-out cookie. I added fresh grated ginger to it and used it for a gingerbread house. Make sure you chill it for at least an hour, otherwise the dough can be sticky and hard to work with. Once chilled, you may have to work it a bit to get it to a consistency that is easy to roll. In the past, I've also rolled it out between two pieces of plastic wrap, then chilled. When we were ready to make the cut-outs, we simply took off the plastic wrap and a perfectly flat piece of dough ready for the cookie cutters.

Didn't make any changes. This recipe didn't work well for cutouts for me. I chilled the dough several hours and rolled it in a cool kitchen. The cookies spread out so much and don't have a very strong flavor. I'd add additional flour and spices were I to make these again.

Delicious cookie & easy to make.  I let my little helpers read the recipe to me, which lead to accidentally quadrupling the amount of nutmeg.  The end result was great, though, so I think those who are saying there could be more spice are on the right track. Alone, they are good, but lacking some sweetness (fine for me, but not for little ones).  I sprinkled coarse sugar on some before baking, which made them pretty, added the extra sweetness, and was much easier than frosting them.

fantastic!  they didn't cut out very easily but were DELICIOUS.  People ate them up!  I'll definitely make these again.  I added almond extract instead of vanilla and it came out very nicely.

I preferred these with a bit more spice than the recipe allots, but that's to taste. They cooked perfectly with cookie cutters and will be making them again.

I was out of cloves, but I added a little ginger. I rolled the cookies to 1/4 inch thickness because I like them soft. These were so delicious! Still soft the next day, too. Really yummy with a cream-cheese icing. These were a great twist on the traditional sugar cookie.

Flavour was great but we couldn't roll out the dough! And we followed instructions.... The dough was sticky and impossible to roll out.

Good texture and great unique flavor.  I rolled then a little too thin though and the ones that weren't burnt still had good texture.

Super easy and super delicious. They roll flat and cut perfectly, great for Christmas. I added whiskey instead of vanilla, still wonderful.

Delicious cookies. In my gas oven I had to bake them for 9 mins. Any longer and they got too hard. But the flavor is fantastic!

Taste was good but I was not a fan of the consistency.
