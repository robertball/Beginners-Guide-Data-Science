This recipe- as it stands- works very well. It's almost professional, in fact- something that I could see served as a restaurant appetizer. A couple of suggestions, here- do make fresh pizza dough and _do_- fry it, as suggested. Do not deep fry, but pan fry. The dough takes on a completely different texture and flavor that really supports the flavors. I would suggest, also, sauteeing the apples until just done- and if they are not very sweet, adding a little sugar to bump that up. The apples should be _just_ on the sweet side. Finally, I would strongly consider blending the feta with a little bit of oil and spooning it on_top_ of the apples before baking. Feta cheese doesn't always melt very well. Making a sort of spread out of it will help enormously.

Not a fan of frying anything, I opted to bake the dough.  I put the apples and thyme on before baking, and then sprinkled the feta after baking. The cheese melted good and nice, and the flavors complemented each other beautifully!

Interesting and good.  I used a refridgerated crust instead of the mix.  Next time I will also add fresh mozarella.

i could not find powdered pizza crust, so i used focacia bread mix... they turned out ok... i would use a tart apple like granny smiths, i used red delicious and the result was too sweet for my taste.. i used more feta than called for because i love feta cheese... the focacia would not make good crust, it plumped up too much and everything just wanted to fall off...  i did, however, love the sweet apple taste contrast with the tart feta and the thyme was a wonderful accent... i would definitely try it again with a tarter apple and the right crust...  a moderately quick and different from the mainstream meal when you are sick of pasta again.. ;)~

Very good ideas, I made a few modifications. We used a Boboli crust with a barbeque sauce base.  I fried up 4 slices of bacon and then sauteed onions, apples, 1 Tbs brown sugar and thyme in same pan.  Has become a favorite in our home.

Definitly would follow another users advice about preping the feta so it spreads better...

Really, really nice. I used a cornmeal dough, and russet apples. I don't think a sweet apple will work as well with this recipe. An apple that will remain firm after baking will work best texture wise.

I didn't do the pan-frying the dough part - just used frozen pizza dough and topped it as directed in the recipe. Delicious - great flavor combinations!

These were good. Served at a girls night.  I ended up making them with pears instead of apples.  I also made a basalmic vinegar reduction and drizzled it over the finished pizzas.  Added a little acidity which was nice.

I thought these were quite nice.  I only gave it a 4 as written though because they are absolutely AMAZING with pear instead of apple.  I tried both, and my tasters and I all agreed that the apple version pales in comparison.  Good as written, but do try it with pear also.  I used a red pear, don't know what variety that is, and a golden delicious apple.  Also, I really don't think you need that much cheese and onion.  I used half of what the recipe calls for, and had just the right amount.

I made the pizza dough myself and they puffed up nicely when pan fried in olive oil, and had the wonderful aroma of gyros.  But it's not very flavorful, and the feta-onion combo is a little on the dry side.  Maybe next time I'll use half ricotta.

Great flavor combo!  I made the dough from scratch (bread machine) and pan fried it.  Frying it does make a difference in the texture.  Also, I didn't use nearly as much goat cheese as in the recipe.  I just eyed the amount when I sprinkled it on top.  I bet this would be good on top of a pita if you're short on time.

Pretty good. The taste improved with a tiny bit of barbeque sauce on a couple of them. Next time I'll add more apples.

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  The fresh thyme sprigs made all the difference.  Don't sub the thyme.  My guests loved it too and thought it was absolutely gourmet.

this recipe was simple, and delicious, and my family loved it. i never would've thought about trying a combonation like that, but it's a wonderful dish. i would definitly reccomend it to anyone with a big family. however, i doubled it, because the dough wasn't enough to make even four pizzas.

I loved this! All the flavors work so well together...from the sharpness of the red onions to the salty feta with the sweet apples and herby thyme ontop of the hearty fried dough! I made it as written except I added 1 tsp. of sugar to apples as I sauteed them. And I used store bought pizza dough. Frying the dough is a must because it gives a totally different flavor to the dough. This is a nice light lunch or snack.
