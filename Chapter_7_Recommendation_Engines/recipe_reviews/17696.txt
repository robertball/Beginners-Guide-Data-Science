I received lots of compliments for this dish.  Tip: I added lots of cayenne pepper to the veggies to spice it up.

This meal was delicious.  I didn't have any zucchini so I didn't put any in.  My husband thought it would be good with okra added. I will definately prepare this again.

Cutting up all the veggies did take some time, but it was worth it.  Lots of flavor and everyone enjoyed it.

very easy to prepare; however, i did not find the flavor to be Creole, more of a goulash taste.

Just made it and I added green onions salt pepper red bell peppers cajun seasoning black pepper cayenne pepper for more flavor. I didn't think chili powder was enough since I like spicy food. Turned out ok. Kid didn't like it so won't be making this again. But I would recommend going it a shot.

This is definitely not a creole.  If you're looking for the strong flavors of that dish, this recipe will disappoint you.  The most flavor you will get out of this is the tomato and chili powder.  I would recommend this dish for those people who don't like spicy dishes.  This is for you.  Also, the directions are a little off.  For a beginner, I would not recommend this recipe.  It's vague on when you need to cover the ingredients, the veggie proportions seem to be off, it would be best if they used more volume measurements rather than say 5 carrots.  Carrots can vary in size drastically.

This dish was very easy to prepare, I appreciated that. On the other hand This was my first time having Shrimp Creole Bake and I didn't know what to expect, I personally thought the recipe itself was bland. I added salt pepper cayenne, I also added andouille chicken sausage to compliment the shrimp. Definitely a recipe that you can easily put your one spin on.
