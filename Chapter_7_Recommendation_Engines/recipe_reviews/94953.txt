Delicious, nutritious and quick dinner. I added a cup of cubed ham, and served with corn bread. My whole family enjoyed it. Tastes even better the next day. A keeper!

this was easy and very good. however, i think next time i'll only puree half of it - it was just too much on the liquid side for our tastes. I paired it with black olive and mushroom quesadillas and added avocado slices on top of the soup - the first meatless dinner that my husband hasn't asked "where's the meat?"

This recipe is awesome. I added some red bell peppers and a couple serrano chili's and topped it with some mexican cojita cheese. YUM! It is perfect for leftovers for the entire week. Great Recipe

The second time I made this, I used "D's Famous Salsa" (also on allrecipes.com) in it, along with a little extra cilantro and a squeeze of lime on the soup and it was AMAZING!

Even without these additions, it is a delicious soup.

This soup is delicious and easy to make. I put a little bit of rice and 1/2 a slice of swiss cheese in my bowl.  I recommend eating it with natural tortilla chips.

This was excellent.  I only pureed about 3/4 of the soup, because I like my soup a little bit lumpy.
