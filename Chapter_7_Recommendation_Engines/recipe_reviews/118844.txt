These were excellent.  Even my husband, who doesn't usually like biscuits said they were great and asked me to make them again.  Here's what I did:  I put the dry ingredients in my food processor and pulsed just until combined.  Then I added the butter, nice and cold, and cut into slices.  I pulsed just a few times until crumbly.  You don't want to over-mix, otherwise your biscuits will not come out flaky.  Then I added the buttermilk and cheese and just pulsed until the dough came together, but only slightly.  I dumped out onto my countertop, and only kneaded like once or twice, just to bring it all together.  I formed it into a circle, and then used a glass to cut out the biscuits.  While they were baking, I put 1/4 cup butter in the microwave to melt.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/8 tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 tsp of parsley flakes to the melted butter.  Brush on biscuits when they are hot.  Yumm-O

I've been meaning to make some biscuits from scratch and I came across this recipe. I omitted the cayenne, and they turned out wonderfully. I added a little more cheddar then what was written, and I think I'll actually add more next time as well. Thanks for sharing :)

I was short on time so I melted the butter and folded it with the buttermilk into the dry ingredients. I did use a wisk through the dry ingredients as sort of a sifter, then added the cheese before adding in the wet. I dropped them into greased biscuit cups. Turned out great. Fluffy, rich and oh, so good. Nom.

These came out pretty good.  The only thing I added was a bit of garlic powder.  I was trying to find a cheddar biscuit recipe that was actually from "scratch", i.e. no baking mix, and was glad to find this one.  I did have to knead in some extra flour because the mixture was a bit gooey.  Otherwise everything else worked out perfect.  Will make again.

These biscuits are sooo good! I have been experimenting with biscuit recipes a LOT this past month. I have tried at least 20 different biscuit recipes and most of them looked great but did not have much flavor. But, these were really good. I mainly followed the recipe but added 1tsp of garlic powder and an extra 1/4 sharp cheddar cheese. After cutting the (salted)butter in with my fingers, so that there were dime size slivers of butter, I put in the freezer and let it rest about 7-8 minutes. I kneaded just like the recipe suggested. Do not use a insulated pan, it will not get hot fast enough to bake biscuits.

This recipe is a winner!  I have tried tons of "scratch" recipes for buttermilk biscuits, but this one is THE BEST!  I used my food processor to mix the dry ingredients, then the ice cold butter pieces.  I then turned the ingredients out into a bowl, tossed in the cheddar and then added the buttermilk.  I baked them in a well buttered iron skillet, and golly, the bottoms turned out so beautifully, with a golden, crispness.  The biscuit itself was light, flakey and flavorful.  My family couldn't get enough.

These biscuits are fantastic! This will be the recipe I use from now on. Thank you! 
 I substituted parmesan cheese for the cheddar and added 2 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dried thyme. I also added a dot of butter on top each biscuit before baking.

I was looking for a moist and flaky recipe.  This one is great!  The biscuits are very tasty and light.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and added a little extra buttermilk while I was mixing (about a tablespoon).  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Oh my Goodness these were good! Made these to go along with beef stew and they were a hit with the entire family.  I made 12 and hubby, who doesn't really care for breads/biscuits literally ate all but 4.  I made a few minor changes based on other reviews and based on what I had/didn't have on hand.  First, I had absolutely no milk or buttermilk so I ended up thinning out some sourcream and using that instead. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but like I said, these biscuits were sooo fabulous.  I also upped the cheddar cheese to about 3/4 cup  and added a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and parsley right into the dough - maybe about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp each.  I would have liked to have brushed additional butter with those same spices after they came out of the oven, but I ran out of butter so I'll try that next time. Also, I always grate my butter when making any sort of biscuits, scones etc.  It's extremely easy and it does what needs to be done without a big fuss.  I'd liken these biscuits to Cheddar Bay Biscuits from Red Lobster - at least with my changes that is how it turned out. I'll keep these in my biscuit file for good.

My boyfriend and I LOVED these. The were flaky, fluffy and very flavorful. I'm not very experienced with cutting butter into flour mixtures (I live in a tiny apartment and don't even own a food processor pastry cutter), but I got these to turn out by grating frozen butter and then adding it to the flour mixture. I have made these several times, sometimes with butter and sometimes with margarine, and they have turned out lovely either way. I find the cayenne taste to be very prominent (and I like that), but I have made them without the cayenne when baking for family members that don't like things spicy. Thanks for this great recipe!

Yum! I topped a chicken pot pie with these biscuits Sunday and it was to die for. I left out the cayenne and went a bit heavier on the salt (about 3/4 tsp) and the sharp cheddar (I grated about 4 ounces). Rolled out to 3/4 inch thick, cut them, then laid them on the bubbling chicken, veggies, and sauce. 15 minutes at 400 degrees baked them a gorgeous golden brown and cooked their bottoms all the way through.   My new "go to" biscuit recipe. Thanks for a winner. :)

These were very good. Not dry like some cheddar biscuits. I added some Italian spices and garlic powder in place of the pepper. Went well with homemade clam chowder.

Excellent. I followed the recipe but added about 1-1.5 cups of finely shredded cheese (mixture of cheddar and gruyere), 1/2tsp garlic powder, a couple tablespoons of finely chopped fresh chives, tablespoon of finely chopped Fesh sage. I only put in a dash of cayenne, and a few grinds from the peppermill. Excellent. 

I actually used this recipe for my sausage & gravy biscuit casserole and it was unbelievably good.

Kids and I liked this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I added 1 pound crumbled bacon to the batch then put 1 TB orange juice in the 3/4  measuring cup then filled with the buttermilk. YUM YUM.

Delicious! I made these with half whole wheat flour, and they were still light and fluffy and tasty! I also added about 2T chopped sage and increased the cayenne to 1/2 t. I served these with the "All-Natural Chicken Pot Pie" from this site (I made the biscuits instead of making a crust for the pie), and they went together perfectly!

Fantastic biscuits!  I was looking for a simple recipe, but I found most of them weren't from scratch, but from some kind of biscuit mix.  These are perfectly moist on the inside, and just crispy enough on the outside.  I made them in a muffin pan instead of cutting them from a roll.  I definitely will be making these again!!

Like the other reviewer, I was looking for a "scratch" cheese biscuit and this fit the bill.  For the sake of my kids, I only added the slightest pinch of cayenne.

Cut the recipe back to just 2 servings, but made exactly as written, thought they were great.  Couldn't believe hw much flavor such a tiny bit of cayenne pepper give them.  I was probably a littl e heavy on the cheddar cheese, but I love cheese!!

Fabulous recipe. So easy if you use a stand mixer to mix--but not overmix--the ingredients. Save time by dropping dough into muffin pan sprayed with Pam. Super quick, super delish.

These were really wonderful! I omitted the cayenne pepper but added the cheddar cheese. Used buttermilk. I mixed with my hands to make sure not to overwork the dough. Didn't roll out but spread out with my hands until the dough was about 1" thick and used a large biscuit cutter. Had to cook a little longer than stated but that could have been because of my stove.

I thought these were dry and bland, even with 1 cup of cheese instead of 1/2 a cup. Did not care for them.

These are very good- I like the addition of the cayenne(maybe will even add a little garlic next time). I followed the recipe but replaced half the all-purpose flour with whole grain white flour. They were delicious and I definately will use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh!  These biscuits are to die for!  Doubled the recipe, left out cayenne by mistake,  but other than that followed it exactly.  Oh so good- my daughter ate 3!  Probably cooked for 18 minutes in my 400 degree convection oven.  Want to try without the cheese so I can have them with jam or honey!!!  Will definitely make again and again!

i made these last night to accompany homemade chicken noodle soup, and they came out perfectly!  i omitted the cayenne, and dusted the cheese with a little flour and popped it in the freezer for 10 minutes so it would blend in nicely.  Restaurant quality for both taste and presentation - this will definitely be a keeper.

These were delicious. They rose nice and tall and were a nice combo of fluffy and flakey. used an old cheddar and added more then called for. used more buttermilk then called for as well. omitted the cayenne, kids won't eat anything spicy. very easy to customize. some crumbled crispy bacon might be nice. maybe some green onions and cracked black pepper.

very easy recipe.  I followed another reviewers advise and made the whole thing in my food processer, just pulsing until the butter was in small pieces.  I pulses several more times once the buttermilk was added and then dumped it all on the counter for a quick pat.  Very easy even for a non-biscuit maker.  The family loved these with beef stew!

This is now my standard biscuit recipe.  For cheese biscuits, increase the cheese to 3/4 cup.  This recipe works great without the cheese, too.  Feel free to substitute other herbs like thyme, dill, basil, chives, tarragon for the cayenne.  I use 2 heaping tablespoons of sugar, but I like things on the sweeter side.  If I don't have buttermilk, a 50/50 mix of milk and yogurt (plain or vanilla), or milk and sour cream is a substitute.  Doubling the recipe is a good idea.

Awesome and cheesey.  I added scallions to mine and they came out great. The biscuits rose so high, it was a good thing I had them in the middle of the oven.  Definately, I will make these again.

These are the BEST!!  My husband doesn't like biscuits and he loves these.  I add more cheese and about 1 tsp of garlic powder, freeze the dry mix before adding the buttermilk for about `10 mins ( I do sour milk- 1 T vinegar + milk to = 1 c and let it sit 5 minutes), and bake on a preheated baking stone.  They are awesome!!  Try them with a little more sugar and no cheese or savory seasoning for a great all around biscuit, too.

great recipe, the second time around I mixed the melted butter with the buttermilk in stead of cutting the butter in, it saved alot of time. Also if you dont have buttermilk, just use milk and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes.

Great biscuits and easy and quick,  although next time I will bake at about 375 instead of 425. Not 14 minutes and the bottoms were burning, although the top of the biscuits were good (I just cut off the very bottom). Very light and fluffy. Don't overmix!!! I made them without the cheese and cayenne, as just regular buttermilk biscuits. I will definitely make them again both with and without the cheese.

These were really great; my cousin said they were better than Popeye's biscuits! I didn't have cheddar or cayenne pepper so I simply made them plain, and they still turned out soft and flaky.  I used only one tablespoon of sugar, and had to add about 1/3 cup extra buttermilk, and then some extra flour.  I can't wait to try these with cheddar :D

I rarely, if ever, do this but I have been making biscuits from scratch for years and I have to say that even with the additon of fresh garlic and 1 cup of cheese it still came out very bland, non-flavorful. I will be losing this recipe for sure. Sorry.

My husband said these were the best biscuits he'd ever had.  I have to agree.  I left out the cayenne due to my small kids, but still delicious.  I would like to try adding some garlic next time.  Great recipe!

Came out amazingly well!  Used extra sharp cheddar, a bit of cracked pepper, and folded some extra cheddar into the tops of the biscuits.  Also brushed melted butter on the biscuit tops.

I put in about an entire cup of cheddar - I think 1/2 cup would be too little. And I left out the cayenne. These disappeared within the first five minutes of Thanksgiving Day dinner!

These turned out perfectly!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were awesome!  Love the cayenne pepper...adds just a perfect little kick.  We had it with potato soup...yummy!  I did melt butter and added garlic powder and brushed them right when they came out of the oven.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to use these to go with a chicken stew I made (Kind of like a chicken & biscuits type dish) so I left out the cayenne and cheese. THEY WERE AWESOME! Perfectly flaky, tasty, and crispy on the edges. YUM We split them open, put them in the bottom of the bowl, and then dished the soup over top. It was a hit!

these are wonderful, tender, flavorful cheddar bisquits. I have to admit I did add extra cheddar cheese, more like 3/4 cup. Will be making these many more times! Went wonderful with beef barley soup. yummmmmy.

These are the best biscuits I have ever made!  They were fluffy, tastey everything you would want in a homemade buiscuit!  I will never buy biscuits again...The only thing  I did different was I didn't have shredded cheese so I just omitted it and they were still delicious!

My son and I made these biscuits tonight and they were fantastic! We used 1C of extra sharp cheddar and had to add just a little more buttermilk... maybe a tablespoon. I added some dried parsley for a little extra character. When they were done I spread the top with garlic and herb butter. I will definately make these again.

I wanted something other than crackers to go with chili, so I made these. They are so soft and came out very nicely! I didnt add the cayenne pepper and they were still great!

Good recipe that I will make again(and again). The salt is probably unnecessary because the recipe seems to provide enough in the cheese and butter.

These are amazing.  I've made them with and without the pepper, and both ways are delicious.  I don't roll out the dough, just shape each one with my hands (it saves a clean-up step).  I will make these often and never change the recipe. Thanks!!!

Made these for Southern Fried Sunday at my church.  I doubled it - made 26 large biscuits.  I had to try out my new ice cream scoop (#16).  These were flavorful and flaky - yum.  I think I'd use a smaller scoop next time - to get more biscuits.

Kick up the buttermilk + sub extra cheddar for some of the butter to bump up moisture & flavor.  I also added a liberal 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and a dash of black pepper.  Brush on melted butter for extra awesomeness if you like.

These were sooooo delicious!  I did sift the 2 cups of flour, used reduced-fat sharp cheddar, omitted the cayenne and used 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  After baking I brushed the tops with melted butter and an additional sprinkling of garlic and salt to the top.  Light, fluffy-my first success at homemade biscuits.  TO DIE FOR!!

Made these to go with dinner tonight...my family loved them! I added garlic granules, sea salt & basil. I also reduced the sugar to 2 tsp. I made as drop biscuits. Very nice accompaniment to dinner. Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

These were amazing!  I made the recipe as is, except I substituted 4 tsp of dried oregano in place of the cayenne and doubled the cheddar.  The dough was a bit crumbly and a little hard to work with ( - could maybe have used a bit more buttermilk -), but the biscuits turned out fabulous.  The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe put a pat of butter on top of each biscuit before baking to make them a little less crispy on top.

I made this exactly as directed (except for more cayenne and some black pepper) and they were perfect! Thank you so much for this. I made them with sausage gravy and it was a divine breakfast! We will be making them for out of town guests too.

I hate using superlatives, but these truly were the best biscuits I've ever made. I went for about 1/8 tsp of cayenne instead (my wife can't tolerate spicy foods) and I also rolled to about 3/4 inch thickness to make wider, shorter biscuits. Next time, I might add a little more cheese than what it calls for to give the cheddar a greater presence. Needless to say, this recipe will become a staple in my kitchen.

These biscuits are so flaky and savory, my family LOVED them!! I cut up the butter and froze it, pulsed the dry ing. in the food processor then added the frozen butter pieces (makes them extra flakey)and pulsed only twice then added the buttermilk and cheese(we used 1/2 cup grated mozarella and 1/4 cup grated hard goats cheese) and rosemary(instead of c. pepper). and pulsed only 3 short times. dumped it all on a floured counter needed it only enough to shape it into a 1 inch thick circle, floured a cup and cut out the biscuits. Baked as directed and served warm with sunny side up eggs. My husband is a vegetarian, but, next time I am going to add chopped up crispy bacon!  Yum! Enjoy!

THIS recipe earned a "print out and keep" in my old brass recipe box. Provided you remember to handle the dough as little as possible, you get a delicious and flaky biscuit with rich flavour. A little old Southern trick... melt some butter and as you finish cutting each one, a brief dip of the top in the melted butter before setting it on the baking pan, adds a certain something special to your finished biscuit.

I have never made biscuits from scratch before because I thought it would be so much work.  These biscuits are not only very easy and quick to make, but they are the best that I have ever had! I would give them 10 stars if I could.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These are pretty goood. I would recommend turning the heat on the oven down to 350 degrees after you put the biscuits in, because my first batch was perfect on the top and burnt on the bottom.

Very good cheddar biscuits!  The only change I made was to use shortening rather than butter or margarine, because it gives biscuits that light, flaky texture that makes them great, which these were!

I made these for a Sunday dinner. They came out OK but I can't rave about them like so many have. Since flours vary with moisture I believe I could have added a full cup of buttermilk. They came out a bit dry but they were not heavy. Flavor was good but I've made better with a box mix. As I said just OK.

Wow!  Great buscuits!  I did add some garlic salt to this, but it was so easy to make.  My husband and kids ask for this over and over.  I didn't even roll them out and cut them.  I just formed little patties and put them on a pan.  Perfect buscuits every time!

These biscuits are very light and flavorful, I used  one cup Cabot Pepperjack and added 3 cloves minced garlic. The flavor was excellent. I will make this my standard biscuit recipe

Mine did not turn out light and flaky like the picture. They barely rose at all! They were very dense and flour tasting. If they had fluffed up they might have been good. I'll give it another try, but for now all I can give it is 2 stars.

These are good.  I only used a pinch of cayenne. (personal preference).  Not particularly flakey, but I might of cooked them a bit too long.  Will make them again, for sure.

Good stuff! We had buttermilk on-hand that I was trying to use up, and this was a great recipe! As others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1T and used whole wheat for half of the flour. Will make again!

Made these biscuits to use up some buttermilk.  They were nice and flakey; and we really enjoyed the little bit of heat the cayenne brought to them.

I have made these even without the cheddar cheese added and they are still great!

I used a cheddar cheese flavored with herbs and onion - very tasty.  I omitted the cayenne pepper. I rolled out the dough a little too thin - I recommend making sure the biscuits are fairly thick to have a flakier (and tastier) biscuit.  Good recipe!

Made buttermilk out of milk and lemon juice. placed in fridge after mixed until time for dinner...we wanted hot biscuits and they were a huge hit!! We cut them out in stars and made 12 biscuits about 1 1/2 inch tall. My son ate 3! Yummy!

What to do with leftover buttermilk and shredded cheese? Here I found my answer. Deliciously buttery with the faintest kick of cayenne. Mmmm.  I could definitely go for more cheesiness though.

It's a keeper! My 9yo daughter made these tonight. They were easy for her to prepare, and oh-so-flaky! We added 1Tbsp of Vinegar to 2% Milk since we had no buttermilk on hand. Let sit for 5 minutes then added to recipe. Yum! We'll make these again and again.

These are delicious!  I've tried them adding 3 or 4 minced scalllions to the batter and also with a tablespoon of dill onion spice mix and both variations were also delicious.  Definitely a new family favorite!  Thanks so much for sharing!

These were absolutely delicious. I added a little bit of extra cheese- I used some pepperjack and omitted the cayenne. I only gave it 4 stars because they are a little too sticky to roll out. I just put them into little patties to bake but they flattened out a little too much.

I had a cup of buttermilk to use up so I thought I would give these a try. Easy to throw together. Good flavor and nice flakiness. Cayenne didn't come through for me. I would suggest a little garlic powder. I finely diced my cheese instead of shredded because I wanted the little chunks of cheese to show. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour. I got twelve biscuits out of this recipe.

These are good, but they are in desperate need of salt.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and they were just a bit bland.  I would decrease the sugar by a quarter to half and add salt.  Or maybe with the salt, the sugar amount would be okay.  As written, they are too sweet and a bit bland.  Can't really taste the red pepper, either.  I would probably add more of that and add some onion salt or garlic salt.  Quick and easy and a good foundation recipe, but it needs some tweaks to be a 5 star recipe

Pretty good but not worthy of five stars, unfortunately. I had high hopes for this recipe. The cayenne is barely noticeable and these did not rise very much at all. Followed the recipe completely. The cheese was a good amount, I liked that part. And they were moist. Just didn't rise very much.

I was looking for a simple buttermilk biscuit recipe when I came across this one. It had the most positive reviews so I decided to try it. Since I only wanted plain buttermilk biscuits I omitted the cheese and cayenne. They came out perfect. My most successful attempt at making light, buttery biscuits! I mixed all of my ingredients in the food processor, first blendi9ng the dry ingredients, then cutting in the butter, then adding the buttermilk until a soft dough formed. Just perfect.

I've never made biscuits before but these were so easy to make.  They came out delicious and flaky.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used about 1 tablespoon of sugar and about 1 cup of buttermilk because i felt that the dough was not sticking together.  I also added 3 teaspoons of italian seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper and baked at 400 degrees for 20 mins for a crispier biscuit.

WOW - these were excellent!  I omitted the cheese and cayenne because I was hoping to find a good basic recipe to serve with butter and honey and this is it!  I can imagine how wonderful they will be with cheese, hame, herbs, etc.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'll be using it again and again!

I made them tonight and they were a big hit with my family! I just used a pinch of the cayenne, but barely tasted it, so maybe I'll use a bit more next time. I also added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. dried parsley. I also used 1 cup of cheese. Very good! :)

These were wonderful.  I just need to remember next time to roll the dough out much thicker.  Mine were very thin biscuits.  That was my fault though.

I added some garlic powder and didn't use as much c. pepper and put 1/2 again as much cheese. Did everything in the blender as one reviewer suggested and then just kneaded a couple times grabbed a chunk and put in muffin tin with butter on top. These are a HUGE hit! Thanks for the awesome recipe

I followed the recipe to the letter, but my biscuits did not rise much if at all.  The flavor is fine and they're not dense, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I will try it again sometime.

Oh my heck, these were the best biscuits I've ever made and I make alot of biscuits.  I omitted the cayenne and probably came closer to undercooking these than overcooking them so they were just light golden brown and I made them really big.  Oh man soooo good I think I'll write this one down and replace my Betty Crocker recipe with it!

Great recipe!  I did omit the cayenne and sugar, used garlic salt in place of cayenne.  But regardless of the minor changes, the biscuits were light and fluffy - awesome!  I also brushed the tops before and after baking with melted butter.  I will definately make these again!

This is a great biscuit recipe!! Very easy to make. I use my food processor, then kneed just a few times and pop in the oven.  I will never again use canned biscuits.

Really good homemade biscuit recipe.  I skipped the cayenne pepper to appeal to the little one but they still turned out great.

These biscuits are so yummy!  Normally I don't like biscuits because the ones I've had are dry and crumbly.  These are so melt in your mouth delicious... I could eat them every day.  I'll be making these again for sure!

Made 3 servings to equal about 12 oz of dough. Used this recipe for "Bacon and Tomato Cups." Tasty and was easy to work with.

I doubled the recipe (we have a crew)but the only change I made was to use 2.5 Tbs. of sugar instead of doubling it.  You can adjust the cayenne pepper up or down to suit your tastes, but I thought the amount called for was perfect.  The key to flakey biscuits is to handle the dough as little as possible once you've stirred in the buttermilk.  Work in smaller batches when turning the dough out onto the lightly floured surface, forming a loose ball with each batch.  Flatten into  a 1 inch thick disk big enough to cut circles with the rim of a glass twice, then add remnants to the next loose ball.  This recipe provides a flakey, moist biscuit that doesn't even need butter when they're done.  Perfect as is. Definitely a keeper, going in my recipe box!

Very good recipe! Biscuits came out delicious! Only thing though is that the biscuits didn't rise enough, but that's okay with me, I could just make a few alterations. Overall, really easy to make & will definitely use this recipe again! =]

Delicious! Easy to make. I made them in the convection oven in half the time. I will use this recipe again. I have made these using the 2 Tbsp of sugar and I have made them using only 1 Tbsp of sugar. I think they taste much better using half the sugar. I also rub some butter on the tops as soon as they get out of the oven. Yummy!

These were very good - moist and buttery and tangy! I whipped everything up in my food processor and that made things much easier and faster. I didn't use all the buttermilk, and even added some flour to make the dough less sticky. I may stick to about a half cup of buttermilk next time - and there will be a next time! Excellent!!

I made this and it turned out great.  I added a bit extra buttermilk so that the mix was tacky and then turned it into 12 drop biscuits.  Easier and quicker 15 minutes at 400

Wow, so many things went wrong, and they were still a success. I didn't have enough butter, so I supplemented with the last little bit of shortening I had and a little spreadable margarine. Had to estimate the amounts because I'm in Ireland, and butter here doesn't come in sticks marked with tablespoon and cup measurements. I also estimated the buttermilk and didn't flour my hands properly when kneading so ended up a bit of a sticky mess. My biscuits did not rise really, but they were still light, fluffy, and the taste was lovely. This was my first time baking biscuits, but I've had loads of experience eating them, and I enjoyed these, as did my Irish boyfriend who accidentally sabotaged my first attempt by closing down this website so I couldn't refer to the recipe anymore. I forgave him. Hopefully my handling and my estimations will improve with experience.

I can't believe I made these! They are PERFECT. I used chili powder instead of the cayenne. SO good. I found I needed the full 18 minutes of baking. What a delicious addition to the cabbage soup I made tonight!

These biscuits were delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used reduced fat buttermilk.  I also used my food processor to combine ingredients which I found easier to blend the butter with dry ingredients.  Then added the cheese and buttermilk and pulsed one or two times.  This recipe is a keeper!

Terrific - light and flaky. Didn't have cayenne pepper so I put a little garlic in. Kids loved them! Thanks.
