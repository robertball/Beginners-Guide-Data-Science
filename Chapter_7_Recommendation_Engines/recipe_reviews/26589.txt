Good and pretty quick, but I changed several things when I made it. I added a packet of taco seasoning while sauting the beef. As I cooked the beef, I make up a box of Meican rice. I like the flavor of meat, rice and cheese all mixed together. I like using a can of enchilada sauce instead of the powder stuff.

Not all of us are Mexican. Corn tortillas tend to overpower the whole dish and not all of us care for the flavor. I prefer flour tortillas also and don't think people should judge on authenticity only. Use what you prefer but don't criticize because it's something you don't prefer due to your heritage. There is such a thing as modifying a recipe to suit your needs.

A very delicious meal! The best thing about this recipe is that it is wonderfully simple and easy. It being such a basic recipe means that you can make it as directed or add on to the ingredients to get even more satisfying results. My changes were mostly in the meat, which I doctored up like so: besides the onion, I added a generous amount of garlic (I'm a garlic freak), a can of mild green chile peppers, and half a pack of basic taco seasoning. Yum Yum. After that bit it is as easy as pie. You just roll everything up and bake and you've got dinner! This is also a wonderful meal to eat while on a budget. The last two times I've made this for my family, I served it with cornbread, Spanish rice, and extra enchilada sauce.

Made exactly as written and everyone (including picky little ones) enjoyed and had seconds. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe! And to those criticizing flour tortillas vs corn tortillas...not all of us are experts on Mexican foods and really don't care. We just like a great tasting dish and this was delicious.

Hmmm....I was surprised to see so many recipes called "Enchilidas" made with FLOUR tortillas.  True enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas not flour; however I do make this all the time using flour tortillas; but I dont call them "Enchiladas" I call them "Enchi-ritos" cus they contain a combination of enchilada/burrito ingredients.

a quick easy Mexican fiesta. I used the canned El Paso enchilada sauce, placed 1/2 in pan and 1/2 over the enchilada's and quite a bit more shredded mexican cheeses. Great recipe. Thank you.

For such a quick and easy recipe, these were quite good!  I added a can of refried beans to the beef mixture but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Great for a quick weeknight meal!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe! I usually add a little cumin and red pepper flakes to the meat and onion mixure before rolling the tortillas to add a little more heat. These are great with either red or green enchilada sauce! Thanks!

This is so easy to make and tastes good. I used ground turkey - cooked it with onion,then simmered it in taco seasoning with water.I used a can of enchilada sauce and extra cheese. I had mine with sour cream and my husband had his with sour cream and taco sauce.

If you add a packet of taco seasoning instead of dry enchilada sauce mix and then drench them in a can of red enchilada sauce, these are absolutely DELICIOUS.

As recommended by others, I used taco seasoning in the meat and added Rotel tomatoes with green chillis along with the chopped onion.

I used corn rather than flour tortillas.  I fried each tortilla in shortening for about 3-5 seconds each to make them easier to roll, then dipped them in red enchilada sauce (canned) before filling them with the meat mix and cheese.

I substituted prepackaged Mexican cheese for the cheddar as well.  

The dish turned out very well.  I will definately make this again soon.

This is the first time I have made enchiladas.  I used venison instead of ground beef and 1 small can of enchilada sauce as mentioned in previous reviews and they turned out great!  I also used the Mexican blend of cheese that Kraft makes instead of just cheddar.  Next time, I might try making the sauce from scratch.

I like this recipe. I don't mind that its made with Flour Tortillas instead of corn. I live in Texas and have tons of Hispanic friends. They eat BOTH. The only thing I did different with this recipe is added cumin and some onion powder when sauteing the beef. I also use black beans inside with the meat for some fiber and vitamins. Otherwise, wonderful recipe! Thank you!

very delicious and easy.  I used a can of enchilada sauce, but followed everything else.  I loved the simple, yet wonderful flavor these had.  I used my own homemade tortillas.

Don't believe a word of anyone else about this recipe not having any flavor!  Quite the opposite, there is a lot of flavor that should please everyone in a big family.  The only change I made was to add a just a bit of taco sauce (Pace brand) to the meat to give it a boost.  I am also able to buy canned enchilada sauce, making it easier as well.  I live in Texas, where Mexican food reigns, and in authentic enchildas you can actually taste the beef and cheese, as I think you can with this recipe.  Taco seasoning, in my opinion, would ruin this recipe. If you need extra spice, try to buy "hot" enchilada sauce, or make the Red Sauce offered here (which is wonderful).  My husband came back for seconds, and all three sons gave it an "A" rating, very rare indeed in my house!  Thanks for sharing this easy, inexpensive, yummy recipe!  Going into my permanent rotation!  :)

My husband and I loved this recipe! The only changes - used homemade red enchilada sauce (Sara's from this site), added taco seasoning package to the meat for flavor and sprinkled green onions on top with the black olives. This recipe as is only filled six large tortillas for me so you might want to use more ground beef for a larger crowd.

For a quick meal these are really good and very easy to add your own little touches. I come from California and in answer to a few of the detractors I will say that I learned to love enchiladas made with flour tortillas from a Mexican lady! I now prefer them made with flour rather than corn tortillas. You also should not review a recipe until you have actually made it and eaten it.

This is a really fast way to make Enchiladas.  I used two cans of enchilada sauce.  I also dipped my tortillas in sauce before rolling.  I little more messy, but it keeps them from drying out so bad and makes easier to work with.  I have made with both chicken and ground beef and both work very well.  It is a great fast meal.

We added lots of fajita seasoning to the beef to give it more flavor. I added the cheese to the beef and mixed it together before putting it in the tortillas rather then sprinkling cheese on top of the beef. I only had corn tortillas and they were a little stiff and broke as I rolled them so I dipped both sides of each one in some of the enchilada sauce to soften them up before I put the meat in. That worked really well. I put a lot of the filling in each one because we like a lot of meat in them and ended up making 8 6" tortillas. I would recommend eating these with sour cream on the side.

I used the Red Enchildada Sauce recipe from this site and ditched the olives since I hate them.  Making the sauce was more hassle, but using canned (which I probably will next time) makes these super duper easy.  I thought they were very good and only have two comments on the basic recipe.  Yes, the beef is bland.  And I also don't think it's enough to fill 10 (10") tortillas.  I got 6 out of it though I do like mine stuffed good.  But I can't see more than 7-8.  The bland beef did not make the entire recipe bland -- many forkfuls which included the sauce and cheese still tasted fine to me.  It was just the forkfuls which were mostly just beef that ended up bland cause that's all I could taste.  I think the simpliest solution (which I'll try next time) is just putting some of the sauce into the beef, without the need to add a million other things.  I liked them fine with flour tortillas and was actually surprised over the number of comments about it.  I'm curious how many know what so-called "authentic" Mexican is.  Most of what we make (at least in the U.S.) isn't authentic anyway, so why pick on this recipe in particular?

SO GOOD!!!  I really loved these but did do a few things differently.  I added Taco Seasoning I (from this site. I NEVER buy the package stuff anymore, this stuff is fab!) to the ground beef...as well as half a can of black beans (drained, rinsed and chopped up a bit).  Then I used a homemade enchilada sauce (Enchilada Sauce, from this site).  The result was a new, SPICY family favorite...who cares about authenticity when it tastes awesome!!

These were pretty good (born & raised in Arizona, a few miles from the Mexican border, however, I have had better!!!) & my boyfriend thought they were GREAT!...I used 96% lean ground beef, fat free cheddar, and corn instead of flour tortillas.  I doubled the sauce & chopped some green onions to put on top.  Usually when people make corn tortilla enchiladas they will dip the torts in heated vegetable oil for a minute or so until they are soft and flexible, but to cut out that fat as well, I dipped them in heated enchilada sauce. Yummy!  The meat was a bit bland even after I mixed some enchilada sauce in w/them.  Next time I will defintiley add some spices like garlic, chili powder, & cumin.

While this recipe is not bad, it is not good either.  Enchiladas are time consuming, so it is best to just buy some frozen ones because these taste just like those.  Also, enchiladas are really supposed to be made with corn tortillas, using flour tortillas technically makes them enchurittos.

This recipe was pretty good. My boyfriend loved it. I did add a small can of green chilis to the meat mixture and rolled five good sized enchiladas. I also used the canned enchilada sauce. Poured sauce to cover bottom of pan and put a little in the meat mixture too. I used alot more cheese too, I think. I put alot of cheese inside each tortilla. After I rolled them all up, I covered them with remaining sauce, remaining cheese and alot of sliced black olives. Served with Rice-A-Roni Mexican rice. Added sliced avocado and sour cream on the side to cool down the heat. Very easy and delicious meal.Thanks!

Disclosure: I am also a full blown Mexican. But also disclosure: I’m open minded and not condescending. Ok sometimes I am. Anyway, yes authentic enchiladas are made with corn tortillas but 1. Why are you on here if you already know how you want your enchiladas 2. If you know how to make authentic enchiladas you’ll know that it’s a little more time consuming and you have more steps to take 3. This is allrecipes (not your grandmas cookbook from Mexico). Just because it’s not the “real” thing doesn’t mean it’s bad. I did like them btw. Thanks OP for sharing and sorry some people are so rude. As a Mexican, you other Hispanics should also know that part of the culture of our cooking is sharing recipes and adapting them to suit your families tastes.

I love this recipe, its no fuss, simple and leaves room to stretch your culinary imagination..as for the comment on making Enchiladas with flour tortillas as opposed to corn tortillas..they aren't available to buy at many places and a lot of folks simply don't like the taste!! You gotta have an open mind when it comes to cooking, lol..a lot of the recipes that been given to me by my german grandmother have been modified, simply because of the availability of some of the ingredients..that made some of them even better, than the way she made them.

Fabulous & easy!!! I used dry taco seasoning in the meat (you shouldn't use the whole packet otherwise it's a little too salty), also added about 1/2 cup sour cream to the meat mixture for a creamier texture, & taco sauce on the top & bottom of the enchilada's. Next time I'll try enchilada sauce to see which I prefer. Everyone loved them. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made these enchiladas three times for dinner guests and multiple times for my hubby, and always get rave reviews.  I have found that Lawry's enchilada mix is the best.  I tried a generic brand one time and I couldn't believe how different they tasted- and not for the better.  (Don't forget to add 6 oz. tomato paste to your shopping list- the sauce packet will call for it!)  We like an extra cup of cheese over top and serve with a big dollop of sour cream.  I always make homemade creamed corn and a fresh salad to go with this meal.

Fairly quick and easy.  After cooking up the beef, I decided that it was a little bland, so I added about 1/2 a chopped green pepper, cumin, chili powder and a few daps of hot sauce.  I used 2 small bottles of El Paso enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix.  And I added about a cup of rice to the beef mixture to "beef" them up.

This was delicious! I'm not much of a cook, but when I read this recipe it looked easy enough so I gave it a try. Boy, was I glad I did! I used a combination of dry taco seasoning and canned enchilada sauce and left out the olives. definitely going to be making this again! a quick, inexpensive, very tasty meal.

I made this a couple years ago and did not care for it at all.  It was very bland!  I attempted it again recently, & added some modifications and it turned out really good.  I would give it 2 stars the way it is written, but 4-5 stars with the modifications.  I sauteed onion, garlic, & chopped jalepenos in with the ground beef, and sprinkled the mixture with some chili powder & cumin.  I also made fresh enchilada sauce from another recipe on this site (10 minute enchilada sauce).  I topped it with freshly shredded monteray jack cheese & sliced jalepenos, and served it with mexican rice.  Very good!

This is a great recipe if you are looking for something quick and filling. Easy to make and fills your home with a great mexican aroma. My hubby added some cumin and chili powder for an extra "Kick". We enjoyed this recipe and will definately use it again! Thanks Becky!

So good and easy!! My kids love this as does my firefighter husband and his buddies. So it's child and fireman approved!! I like to add a can of Rotel to the meat and I use already made enchilada sauce in a can. And I could care less if enchiladas are supposed to be made with corn tortillas- these are GOOD. putting them in the oven makes them all soft and gooey. QUICK, EASY AND DELICIOUS MEAL!!

i thought it was yummy, even though i completly altered the recipe. this is what i did, and it was good.
#1- i seasoned the beef with some cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and just a little chili powder. to give it that meixcany taste.
#2- i just bought enchilada mild sauce in the can, put some of that down in the casserole dish. took flour tortillas, filled them with beef and cheese, wrapped em up enchilada style, poured more sauce and put cheddar cheese all over it...
#3- baked it, and when it came out, put some sour cream, cilantro, and a few chopped jalapenos on top! very good! and cheap it was like 7 dollars to make it!

Great base recipe! I add about 1 TB of taco seasoning to the mix. Plain chili powder and salt taste ok too. I also add a wee bit of garlic (we like garlic!). We use a large can of green enchilada sauce (preference). Using pepper jack or monterey jack cheese along with the cheddar kicks up the flavor, but tastes good with just cheddar. My husband never liked enchiladas before this recipe. He is not a big fan of corn tortillas made all soggy by sauce, plus he dislikes red enchilada sauce. This recipe is so quick and easy and I have even put it into a glass 9x11 pan and microwaved it and it was just as good (quicker too). Chop some green onions and add to the top when it's done baking. Looks nice and adds a little something to flavor.

This was a huge hit!!  I did make a few changes, thanks to some of the other reviewers.  I added taco seasoning to the meat and made 2 packets of enchilada sauce (1 would definetly not have been enough).  The only changes I think I might make next time are more black olives (we love black olives), either on top or in the meat mixture.  This is an absolute keeper!

I made lots of changes to this recipe.  I used ground turkey and added a green pepper to the meat and onion.  I also added chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to meat mixture.  I used jarred enchilada sauce instead of the mix.  With my alterations I give this 3 stars.  If I hadn't altered it, I don't think it would have been more than a 2.

As written it is really more like a 3 1/2 only because it is pretty bland.  I changed a few things obviously.  first there were no seasonings so I added salt pepper and garlic powder.  I used corn tortillas because I couldnt have flour.  I mixed a carton of sour cream with a small can of green chilis and spooned it into the enchiladas with a scoop of the beef mixture.  i also put a jar of picante sauce on top for added flavor.  They were wonderful!

This was a great start to a delicious dinner. I made some revisions to make it even better. As someone else suggested, I added chili peppers and taco seasoning in the beef. I also used the canned sauce as someone recommended. Just make sure that you get the large can. The smaller one isn't enough. In addition, I would also double the amount of cheese. I actually added pepper jack cheese on top of the cheddar and it was fantastic! I served it with Spanish rice and refried beans. Delish!

I just signed up to this site yesterday, and I already tried my first recipe, the enchiladas was great, although I did add some taco seasoning to the meat along with green chiles, next time I want to try them with sour cream on top and garnished with diced tomatoes and jalapenos, will make again.

I am giving this recipe a 4 only because it doesnt call for any salt or seasoning  in the meat. I put salt and pepper and taco seasoning. I used corn tortillas because that is the only way I eat enchiladas. I liked it that it said to put 1/4 c. of sauce on bottum of pan, but honestly, i wouldn't use packaged sause or canned. I think homemade is the best. For this recipe I used Red Enchillada Sauce, submitted by Sara. My enchilladas smelled so good my neighbor asked what I cooked that smelled so good, and these were a lot of fun to make for me!

We thought this was good.  We omit the olives, used canned enchilada sauce and extra ground beef.  I may next time add taco seasoning (or make my own) to the meat to give it some extra oomph but overall, it was tasty.  Very easy too, perfect for a week night dinner.

Didn't like at all. I did use corn torilla instead of flour. I won't make it again and still looking for a good enchiladas recipe.

A KEEPER!  I love this recipe!  My fiance and I skip the black olives, though.  We usually eat this dish with chopped lettuce and sour cream.  I love it!

Very, very good recipe!
I took other reviewers' advice and added a can of Rotel and taco seasoning to the ground beef. 
I didn't have tomato sauce, so I added speghetti sauch to the enchilada sauce, and it was still good.
Very spicey with the Rotel. 
I served this with a side of yellow rice-- very filling dinner!

My husband who dislikes enchiladas loved these! Because I was using what I had on hand, I had to change a few things. I ran out of onion and used dried minced instead. I didn't have dry sauce, so I used a large can of green enchilada sauce. My last change was to use both chedder and jack cheeses. Delish! My husband dislikes the red sauce, so I will keep making it with green..but as is this is a great quick recipe! Thanks Becky!

These were excellent.  I did mix about 2 tbsp of FRESH cilantro into the sauce.  It added a little more flavor.

These were great! I loved the change from corn tortillas. I did as several suggested and used taco seasoning on the meat and canned enchilada sauce (2 cans). My husband said "These are better than restaurant enchiladas!"

Very good. I actually ate this meal smiling the whole way. It was so delicious. I mixed some of the enchilada sauce into the ground beef and also added some taco beef mix into it. After cooking up the ground beef and onions, it was all downhill from there. Very simple and so delicious. This is probably the best meal I have ever made. I'm an 18 yr old guy, errr...still living with my parents, but I think this is one that I will make constantly after I move out and become a single bachelor. Great meal to impress people! 2 Thumbs up!

I added a can of beans kidney or pinto,drained and rinsed and about 1/2 cup of sauce to browned meat before rolling them up. The beans stretches out your meal and the sauce kept them from being so dry.

very good!  My husband and I loved them, but would add some seasoning to the meat next time.

Tried with chicken -- fantastic!  Also added refried beans, and that was very good.  I like a recipe you can work with!

Fast and easy,  I used the green enchilada sause in a can (large) added green chilies to the meat with some chili pepper and then sprinkled habanero sauce in with the meat and cheese before rolling up.   Definately a little spicier but very good.

I used ground turkey and scallions in lieu of onion. I also added a half of a can of refried beans to the turkey mixture along with a can of Bean and Bacon soup and a half of a can of enchilada sauce. Yum!

This is an excellent starter recipe, it's the exact "starter" I use when fixing enchiladas or enchiritos, sometimes I use flour tortillas, sometimes corn, if it's corn I always make my own...so easy! I usually add cumin and a small can of chopped jalapeños , a pinch of red pepper flakes to my meat and onions.  I also vary the sauce, sometime red or green and even a white.  Enchiladas is a dish that is so versatile and will adapt itself so easily to what is in your refrigerator and pantry, even the cheese can be varied.

These were really good, and really easy! They aren't very authentic, but I love them! You can spice them up easily too, by adding chopped jalapenos and cilantro!

I used corn tortillas as I'm gluten free and they fell apart a bit but was still tasty. I used prepared enchilada sauce too. Didn't have shredded cheese so I used sliced colby and it was great. Very tasty. Served with my black beans and rice.

Wonderful recipe!  Easy to tweek and add flavor to your liking. We had some leftover grilled steak that was a little tough to eat as steak.  We cut the steak into small pieces and added it to the 1 lb. cooked ground beef.  I did add garlic and adobe spices to the meat for more flavor. I used canned enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix.  I added about a 1/4 cup of enchilada sauce to the meat mixture before I wrapped the meat in the flour tortilla. I will make these again doing what I did the first time.  Thx!

I followed the recipe as stated, except I took the advice of others and added a packet of taco seasoning to the beef after it had been browned and drained. Also, added alittle extra cheese on top, and added some sliced fresh jalepeno peppers on top, as well. DELICIOUS!! I thought this would taste pretty good, but it actually tasted better than I expected. So simple to make, too. Will be making this one on a regular basis. Try it, you'll like it!!

Okay, my first attempt at enchilada's and this was a great recipe! I didn't have the packaged enchilada sauce, so I used "Red Enchilada Sauce Recipe" by Sal on this site, and it was perfect. Also, after reading some reviews, I decided to add some taco beef seasoning (didn't have the prepackaged, so I found a recipe from this site). Also, I added some wolf-chili to the red sauce before pouring over the enchiladas to give it the chili-cheese style. MMMMM... was a hit all around, thanks for the recipe!

this is yummy!  My 20 month old loves it! 
 I cooked the beef with the onion, 2 garlic cloves and I added dash salt and pepper and come cumin. I love cheese so I added cheese extra cheese inside : )
 I also make my own sauce (red enchiladas sauce- found on the site) and I  tweaked to my taste.

Good simple recipe.  I followed other reviews and added half a pkg of mild taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I think it needs a little more flare though its a little plain.  Next time I make it I will add some green peppers.  Overall its a great starter recipe just a few tweaks its awesome!  Thanks for the recipe Becky.

I love this recipe!  I, like everyone else, made my own tweeks.  I cooked the hamburger with only salt and pepper.  Then I added a can of green chili's, 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce, a couple dashes of cumin, cilantro, garlic powder, half of a packet of taco seasoning, some green onion, and about a cup of cheese.  Then I wrapped it up in (flour) tortillas, poured on the enchilada sauce, and topped it off with cheese.  I usually prefer corn tortillas but the flour worked great.  This was super quick and easy.  I think next time I will add a second can of green chili's.  YUM and thanks.

We liked it. I put taco seasoning in the Beef. I used canned sauce, & of course I used corn tortillas. Fry the tortillas in oil on both sides just for a few seconds, then dip them in the enchilada sauce then put in the meat & cheese. :)

Made this for friends to celebrate Cinco De Mayo!  Huge hit and wonderful!!!  A little worried about the flour tortillas, but still great!  i did change a few things though - used ground turkey meat, added a can of rotel to the meat and onion, and used a big can of enchilada sauce!!!  Still think it would be just as great following recipe as is.  Served with Spanish rice and refried beans (i know not too healthy) and it was a perfect dinner!!!

I love this recipe.  With other enchilada recipes, I always cooked the corn tortillas in oil before putting the meat mixture in.  In this recipe, the flour tortillas are soft pillows of deliciousness!  I made my own enchilada sauce with the packet (much better than canned).  I also added cumin, garlic salt and chipotle seasoning to the ground beef.

I made a couple changes to the recipe that we liked a lot. After I strained the hamburger and onions I added about half a can of green chile enchilada sauce to it and mixed it. Then put it into the tortilla shells. I thought it gave them more flavor. I also used canned enchilada sauce instead of the packaged.

Yummy!  I only gave it 4 stars because I had to add some things to it to give it some zing.  First time I made it, I followed directions exactly.  Second time I made it, I added a few dashes of garlic powder, chili powder, and red pepper flakes.  Only a very small amount of the hot stuff as I have little kids who wouldn't like it too hot.  Also, the second time I made it, I used a combo of cheddar and monteray jack cheese to both the insides and the top.  With my additions it was delish!  Make sure there's enough sauce, though, it needs quite a bit to make the insides saturated enough-I used 3 cans of enchilada sauce and that was perfect.

My very picky husband's first word after the first bite was "Wow!"  He loved it!  I followed the advice of others and added a packet of taco seasoning while the meat and onions were cooking.  I aslo used the enchilada sauce in a can and added an 8oz. can of tomatoe sauce.  I used corn tortillas and flour; flour was the best!  My husband topped his off with sour cream and picante sauce, he said that's what made it great.  This is a keeper for sure!

This recipe definitely has potential and mine turned out really well after some tweaking. After nibbling on a bite of the browned ground beef (I added 2 cloves of minced garlic), I knew it was just way too bland for how we like our enchiladas. I added a healthy dose of diced green chilis and a packet of taco seasoning. Much better! I used canned enchilada sauce instead of the powder because that's what I had on hand. I also didn't realize until the last minute that I was out of black olives, so I just spooned some diced green chilis on top. Thanks for the recipe :)

Very good and easy to make.  I did follow the other reviewers suggestions by adding taco seasoning and refried beans to the browned beef.  Turned out great and will make again.

This recipe was great.  Very easy to make and the entire family loves it.

I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce (one green, one red) and added taco seasoning & a can of green chilies to the ground deer/beef.  I also spread refried beans on tortillas before putting meat mixture on.  Very tasty!

Husband loved it. I added whole canned green chilies and uses corn tortillas.  I thought that it was good...but nothing spectacular. (Considering everything added was "premade").

Loved this. Was really craving enchiladas and these were so rich I could barely finish 2! I love them. This recipe does clearly state 'quick and easy' not 'authentic Mexican'! So I guess if you're 'offended' by enchiladas being made with flour tortillas then this recipe is obviously not for you.

I made these last night and they are so good. I used the taco seasoning in the meat like suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and three young boys loved them. We're adding these to our dinner list. Thanks for a great and easy meal.

I couldn't find a packet of enchilada sauce mix so I had to use canned.  But it was actually very good and easier than making the sauce. I made this recipe for a family get together and it was very popular. Would make again.

Followed a suggestion to season ground beef with taco seasoning as it cooked; really helped boost the flavor.  Also served with chopped cilantro, diced tomato, and sour cream.  Very tasty.

I thought this was a great recipe, especially for how easy it is to make.  I couldn't find dry enchilada sauce so I just substituted it with a can of enchilada sauce.  I skipped the olives and used 8 flour tortillas instead of 10.  Very good.  I made with Mexican III which is an awesome recipe!

My husband & I love this recipe! I added a can of refried beans to the beef mixture, and instead of putting the sauce in the bottom of the baking dish I put it in with the beef & bean mixture.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes on top. Great for a quick weeknight meal! Thanks!

I made this two nights ago, very good!  I added jalepeno to the meat and onions.  I used a can of mild red enchilada sauce, somewhat sparingly (my boyfriend wasn't a huge fan of enchiladas prior to my making this, because of the sauce).  I dipped the tortillas in some vegetable oil that I heated in a skillet to facilitate rolling (I patted off the excess oil with a paper towel first).  I just used a light layer of shredded medium cheddar cheese on top, baked until it was golden and bubbling.  I served the enchiladas with shredded lettuce, diced tomato, sour cream, and beans and rice.  Fantastic!

Sooo good!  But I'll give it four stars since I made several changes.  I used a full packet of taco seasoning for the meat (followed directions on packet), added rotel with green chiles to the cooked beef, and used lots of Mexican blend shredded cheese.  I also used Lawry's enchilada sauce packet as suggested by someone else.

What I really love about this recipe is the delicious simplicity of it!  Not too many ingredients, but very tasty.  The only personal adjustments I made was to roughly chop 3 cloves of garlic to saute with the meat and onions, and to use 2 cans of Old El Paso enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix.  Also after sauteeing the meat, I added a 1.48 oz. pack of Lowry's dry chili seasoning mix and a little of the enchilada sauce and sauteed this to give the meat a little more flavor.  And I went with a 4 oz. can of chopped olives (because I really like olives) to top the enchiladas along with colby/monterrey jack cheese.  We really enjoyed this dish, and will definitely do it again.

My only comment was this seemed like a strangely large quantity of onion.  It's almost as much onion as meat.  However, I think it is very easy to adjust the amount of onion to one's preference.  This was an exceptional and easy weeknight meal; a big hit!

Making these for the second time tonight. These are really good.   I like white corn tortillas for tacos, but not for my enchiladas. I much prefer the flour so was delighted to find this recipe. For those of you so rude to say you must use CORN instead of flour. It's easy. Use corn or don't make this recipe. No need to put your arrogant, rude comments here. Especially those that commented with a poor rating and didn't even try it. That is wrong. Thanks so much for the recipe . We love it at our house.

Very good and easily prepared. I followed directions from another reader and added taco seasoning to my meat, and used canned enchilada sauce. Also added chopped green onions upon serving. Served with sour cream and quacamole and a side of rice. Wonderful! I'll be making this again. (And again!)

Great recipe. Use the McCormick dry enchilada mix and pick up an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce while you are at the store... You will need it to make the sauce. Instead of putting 1/4 cup sauce in bottom of dish, add it to the meat and dip each CORN tortilla in the sauce before filling. I also add cilantro, chopped olives and chopped jalapeño before rolling it up. Then top with remaining sauce, cheese and olives. Serve with diced avocado and sour cream.

I'm Mexican and although we use corn tortillas, i was desperately looking for a recipe with flour tortillas. I changed a couple of things, but they turned out great. Flour tortillas best when making baked enchiladas!

The meat was flavored well but I did not like the flour tortilla once it was cooked. It was soggy and had a weird texture to it  so I think it would have been better with corn tortillas.

I added cumin, chili powder, garlic, oregano, and a little salt. Still too bland. Then I added one tablespoon taco seasoning mix (from recipe on this site), 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and 1 cup El Pato Enchilada sauce to the meat and heated it. That finally gave the meat enough zing to be edible. As I added the meat mixture to the tortilla I also included a spoonful of black beans rinsed and drained well. Also a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese and rolled the tortillas. When done I poured the rest of the can (28 oz El Pato enchilada sauce) over the tortillas and added more shredded cheddar cheese. Baked for 40 minutes. 4 stars with my reworked recipe.

Yum!  This is an easy recipe that our family really liked.  After reading other reviews I also added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I will be making this dish again soon.

I followed recipe. It's a good start but missing a lot of flavor. I would add taco seasoning to the meat and maybe use like 2 lbs of meat. Too plain.

This is very similar to the recipe I have used for years. Like a lot of other people, I use taco seasoning in my meat with the onion and a little bit of cayenne pepper for heat. I add sour cream at the end as a topping, along with some more sauce and cheese. I also use flour tortillas because I feel corn tortillas put in oil just adds too much extra fat. The flour tortillas taste wonderful.

Great and simple recipe. Turned out great. I did use the canned enchilada sauce not the dry. Also more cheese. I love the flour tortilla much better than corn. I am not a fan of the corn and neither is my husband. Corn may be more authentic as some have said but in most restaurants in this country they use the flour.

5 stars if and only if you add a packet of your favorite taco seasoning to meat.  I also added green onion, cayenne pepper, and more cheese.  Makes 6 10 inch enchiladas with a half cup of mixture in each (not counting cheese).

This is simple and good.  I have to agree with the comment about the corn tortillas - they are the "real deal".  Also you would need to use white cheese and white onions to be authentic.  That said, make them however you like!  Corn tortillas are a little grittier of a texture, but I love them that way and flour is a bit softer and in my opinion, less absorptive.  I also would season that beef up, and yum-bo...

I thought they were good, but not wow. My son felt the same way. My teenage daughter love them.I used canned sauce which works just as well and it's one less step. I suprisingly enjoyed the flour tortillas, I now prefer it to corn. I think this is a wonderful starter recipie. I will make it again, but maybe try some taco seasoning in the meat.

Yum!!! I followed the recipe, but used the Best Red Enchilada Sauce and Homemade Flour Tortilla recipes from this site.  It's a bit more effort but worth it!  I love mexican and these were the best enchiladas I've had.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was okay. There was nothing wonderful about it. There wasn't a lot of flavor to it considering the insides consisted of meat, cheese and onions. The only thing that added flavor was the sauce. I'll be looking for a different recipe.

Great recipe!  I also use a package of Taco Seasoning in the ground beef, and I prefer the canned Enchilada sauce.  This recipe is so simple and SO YUMMY!  This is definitely going into the rotation at my house!

Good base recipe & would give 4.5 stars but, I knew I had to kick this up a couple notches for my pref. Used grnd sirloin that I seasoned with chili powder/cumin/garlic/diced onions/salt/pepper, etc. Didn't use dry enchilada stuff, made my own E sauce (from this site). Used 7 smaller flour tortillas that I lightly steamed to make pliable b4 rolling up. Added 1/4 C Sour cream to seasoned beef mixture as well as a bit more cheese inside and on top. Baked covered with foil for 30 minutes then uncovered for add't 10 mins. Let rest for 10 minutes b4 serving. This recipe can be built on to suit your own tastes and I've decided I prefer flour torts to the corn ones. I know, I know...not as authentic but corn tortillas always fall apart when I've used them. Thanks for this basic recipe you can alter.

Great recipe with some minor adjustments/enhancements. I added fresh garlic, green chiles and taco seasoning to the beef, and I used canned enchilada sauce. Next time I'll try to make my own enchilada sauce, and perhaps even some corn tortillas for a more authentic flavour. I served them with black beans sauteed with onion and garlic and a fresh salad topped with corn. Delicious!

First, while some people groused about this not being authentic, the flour tortilla tasted great!! I used 1.5 pounds ground sirloin. I had (2) 10oz cans enchillada sauce so used 1/2 can in the meat and the rest over them instead of the dry mix. I also added about 2 tablespoons diced jalapenos to meat. We loved them and will make them again soon!! Thank you!

They weren't that great. They kind of tasted like the enchiladas you get out of the freezer section.

This recipe is very easy and very nummy! I did make a few changes though... After I browned the ground beef I added a packet of Ortega jalapeno & onion taco seasoning mix and left out the chopped onion the recipe calls for. This gives it that extra flavor with a little bit of a kick, but not too much. I also use a can of the mild green enchilada sauce, it has a little more spice than the red. Wonderful! I make this at least once a month. It's a great quick and easy dinner when you dont have alot of time. Thanks for sharing it.

I make Mexican food all the time. These to me would be only good if 1. you fried the tortillas first before filling them and the 2. you dipped the fried (not-yet-filled) tortillas in enchilada sauce front and back, then after that lay them in the casserole dish and begin to fill w/ the meat, cheese, and onions

Didn't have enchilada packet but it was so easy to make with the TEN MINUTE ENCHILADA SAUCE (On AR) so it made it all the better with homemade sauce! I used venison burger and what a great way to disguise it! Added some mild green chilies cuz I had them....this is really a cheap and quick dinner!I used corn tortillas and dipped them in the enchilda sauce to soften...a little messy but worked great, since I had the homemade sauce on the stove anyhow! Another Keeper!

These are very good! We use canned enchilada sauce rather than the dry. Sometimes we also add refried beans to the tortilla as well.

UPDATE: Brought left-overs to work this week. I generally "snub" my nose to warmed up foods, but WOW! were these good. Every bit as delicious as fresh (which is a HUGE plus). Good enchilada recipe. I actually prefer Whit's chicken enchiladas by WMONROE (also on this site), but for the beef / red sauce variety, these were pretty good. Made these for my bf and I. As is, this recipe seemed bland to me, so I made a few modifications. To the beef, I added about 2 cloves worth of jarred minced garlic, 1/2 a package of taco seasoning and a 4 oz. can of (drained) diced green chilies (the seasoning and chilis AFTER I drained the meat). Dipped my corn tortillas (flour just didn't seem right...) in some warmed (canned) enchilada sauce. Topped with plenty of cheddar and sliced green onion (we both HATE olives!!!). Baked as directed, these turn out very well. My only suggestion (in addition to my changes above) would be to use an entire packet of taco seasoning and taco flavored cheese to add more flavor. Served with Mexican rice and tortilla chips (for scooping!). All in all, a good dish, but I actually prefer my homemade enchilada caserole over these (sorry!). Thanks for sharing!

Really easy to make :-) I added one clove of chopped garlic, a small can of green chilis (I like spicy, but even the green chilis barely added any heat), and a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef :-)  An easy family pleaser.

I make these easy enchiladas all the time... the key word is easy. Instead of the sauce mix, I buy a can of enchilada sauce. I pour some in with the ground beef to give it a nice flavor. They re-heat well the next day. Also, I don't see the problem with flour tortilla shells. This recipe never promised to be 100% authentic. For personal taste, my boyfriend and I prefer the flour shells in this recipe... he requested them for his birthday dinner! For a cheap meal that can be done in about 30 minutes, this is a keeper.

I made this recipe for 4 army guys and they all loved it.  They were very filling. They were also pretty easy to make.  I added about 1/4 a cup of the enchilada sauce in with the beef before putting them in the enchiladas because some of the reviews said the meat was a little bland.  They turned out really well and I got a lot of compliments on them.  I will definitely be making them again.

Easy to make these. Fairly quick too. I used minced dried onion and some onion powder. I've also used fresh onion, and I prefer the powder because I am picky, but it's the same taste wise. I made Mrs Espy's enchilada sauce for these the first time, the second time I made the ten minute sauce and it was just as good. I used corn tortillas the second time and liked it better that way although I should have fried them before filing them as they tended to disintegrate upon trying to remove an enchilada from the casserole dish. I used cheddar/monteray jack blend for the filling and some cheddar/american blend for the top. I used more than 2 cups though. My only addition was a sprinkle of garlic powder in the meat. The filling was so-so, the sauce really made these stand out so use a good sauce for best results. You might want to use some non stick spray first though as the bottoms of these stuck in a couple of places. This made 8 enchiladas which I fit into a 9x13 baking dish. I'll make this again, we liked it.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used a sauce rather than the dry enchilada mix and added an extra can.  I also added chili seasoning to the meat and onions.  This definitely added to the overall taste.  A quick recipe that definitely made my family asking for seconds.

I've used this sauce mix for years with rave reviews.  However to TEX-Mex it for the chain restaurant effect, I add a small can of Wolf chili to the sauce.
Also, I use the Cheddar/Monterey Jack mixed cheese for better melting.

Delicious!!! Would season the meat next time, and maybe use chicken or shredded beef instead.  Flour Tortillas were fine, I'd try  it with corn, but hubby doesn't like corn.  We doubled the amount of cheese, we like em' cheesy!  Had lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream on top!  Oh, and we don't like onions, so we used a tad bit of garlic when browning the meat, but still will need more flavor next time!  And there definitely will be a next time!

Like many other raters, I added taco mix to the ground beef.  The results were delicious!   Even my picky four year old loved them.  This is already a family favorite.

Very quick, easy, and tasty! I also used canned enchilada sauce (about one and a half cans actually), and that worked great. Seasoned the meat with a little taco seasoning, added some green chiles too. this will go into weeknight rotation.

I made this for for my fiancee, who doesn't really care for mexican food and he loved it!  I used canned enchilada sauce instead of dry, because I couldn't find the dry and it was fine.  I grew up eating mexican food and it is my favorite.  I am glad I found a recipe that we can both enjoy!

This was the first time I have ever made enchiladas and came out pretty good, but it was not what i was expecting. I did what some other people did and added taco seasoning to the meat. Next time I would probably try using a different type of enchilada seasoning mix, but overall it was pretty good

I just finished making this wonderful recipe for my daughter, my niece and myself. We devoured it! I did add taco seasoning to the meat and also added Lawry's taco seasoning and the dry McCormick enchilada sauce together. I used 8" tortillas and used the kraft mexican cheese and also I added mild cheese that I shredded. It was cheesy and delicious. It was my very first time making enchiladas and it wont be my last.. at least not with this recipe handy!

Great enchiladas- except I followed other reviewers and added taco seasoning to my beef.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and they turned out great.

I'm not a big enchilada fan, but my husband and his friends though these were great.  I used "Red Enchilada Sauce" from this site instead of a mix.

This was delicious. I had to use American cheese because I was out of cheddar, and I added taco seasoning as was suggested by someone else. I also used ground turkey. My husband had four helpings! Super super yummy. I will definately make this again and again.

These were excellent! I too added taco seasoning to the ground beef. I also used the canned enchilada sauce. It was still a little bland but i think that could be fixed with some sour cream. I want to make some sauce from this site and try it with that. I will definately make again since my 5 yr old ate a whole enchilada to herself. Thanks for the great recipe Becky!!

VERY easy and good. I added sour cream drizzled on top before the cheese and my family loved it. I used half corn tortillas & half flour, my husband & I preferred the corn but the kids liked the flour. Only other thing I added was some salsa when we had the left-overs because by then it was a bit dry. Great recipe, will make again!

I made this for my boyfriends family one night and they absoultly LOVED this dish.  It was so easy.  I did add 1/2 a dry package of taco seasoning to the beef, not to over power the enchilada sauce.  I also used the enchilada sauce in the jar, not the dry stuff.  It was just the right ammount of sauce. i also topped it with the olives AND green onion. With these i served refried beans and all the taco condments (sour cream, tomato, letuce, and hot peppers.) I'm keeping this recipe for sure!

This was one of the easiest recipes I have tried in a long time!  It was very yummy and gone quickly!  I do suggest that you make 2 packets of sauce (whenever you bake it it kind of dries up).  And also use the smaller tortillas.  Everyone at my house loved this recipe!  We will be eating this very frequently!

This is pretty darn good!  I did kind of think it was going to be a little easier (not that it is hard, it's just that I am REALLY lazy, and this did take a little effort).  Also, I imagine that it can realy very in taste depending on the enchilada sauce mix that you use.  I noticed one review said to beware that you also need a can of tomatoe paste to mix with the enchilada sauce mix, and mine didn't take that, so obviously there are different varieties.  Very good recipe though!  My husband loved it, and he rarely loves anything.  Will make again, that is for sure!  Thanks!

I doctored this up just a bit and it was awesome....
I added 1 small chopped green bell pepper, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to the beef mix.  

I also added some taco sauce to the enchilada sauce.  I love flavor, and can't get enough!!  

Also, I often find that cheese can come out dry and rubbery when baked on top, so I baked the dish for 15 minutes, then put the cheese on top and baked for the additional 5 minutes.  Delicious!

I loved them and my husband rates it in the top 5 of every meal I've ever made! Then we both went back for seconds! I followed some other users advice and added taco seasoning to the ground beef mix. I also used the canned version of Enchilada sauce rather than the dry and ground turkey was a great healthy substitute for beef.

I thought this was a little too easy, and I guess I was right.  It wasn't bad, it was just kind of boring.  This would be just fine if the filling was a little spicier or more interesting.

Great recipe!  I had never made Enchilads before and this was so easy. I too spiced up the meat with s&p, cumin, crushed red peppers and garlic powder.  I severd it with refried beans and Spanish rice (white rice with green onion and salsa added).  It was a great Mexican feast!

Delish. I just copied a suggestion here and there from the reviews. I especially liked the comment from a review that she added the olives because her family didn't like them. More for us!  And flour vs corn tortillas. Folks let's not bicker. I have in my family that don't like the flour so I make half and half. What's the point of a f dish if not everyone likes the same thing.? I prefer flour my family likes the corn.

This is a very easy recipe to follow. I didn't have flour tortillas so I used corn tortillas and fried them in oil for a few seconds to make them soft and easier to roll up. I put them on paper towels to soak up the oil. I used mild enchilada sauce in a can and put a package of dry taco mix in the meat mixture. Fast way to make dinner with staples found at home. Will make it again!

I will make this again. I think I will use a little more ground beef as I fell short and only made 7 enchiladas. I will lightly fry them next time as they came out a bit chewy.

This is the most basic enchilada recipe out there and is a great quick dinner recipe. I make my own enchilada sauce per a recipe on this site and I also like to add cheese and about a 1/4 cup of the sauce to the meat. This gives the inside a little more flavor. Sometimes I add mushrooms as well. Good share. Thanks!

You don't have to be mexican to prefer the taste of corn tortillas,it's just better than flour for enchiladas.

Very good, my family loved it!  I couldn't find enchilada sauce at the market I was at, but I used taco sauce instead.  Still turned out great.  I hate olives so I used black beans instead. I'm making it again tonight (about a month later) and I was able to find the enchilada sauce at a bigger grocery store.  I'm looking forward to it for dinner!

Very tasty.  Definitely add the taco packet mix to the meat (ground turkey).  Also, add chopped olives along with the cheese before you roll the tortillas.

I usually make with chicken but I had ground beef on hand. These were so good! I used canned enchilada sauce and omitted the black olives.  I see many people commenting on the fact that flour tortillas were used instead of corn but I don't like corn so I would use flour anyway!  The corn tortillas fall apart and I like the soft texture of the flour.  I doubled the recipe because I knew these would be delicious and I knew my family would want seconds and they did!

So what if this recipe isn't "authentic Mexican"? It's good, it's simple and it's nourishing. Add a little side dish, a salad and it's one perfect meal that can be a blessing to working moms or dads with little time to fuss around with exotic ingredients.

Great recipe!  My husband and son loved it; which says a lot because they are true critics!  I took the advise of others and added taco seasoning (El Paso) and used a can of Enchilada sauce (also El Paso) instead of the mix.  Plus, I used more cheese (mixed a bag of Mexican blend with the cheddar). Added a salad and dinner was done.  I will definitely make this again!

Follow this - Corn tortillas, season the beef, add refried beans and roll up. Garnish with fresh jalapenos and sour cream.  I also added guacamole...

I have to say these had great flavor. I used Carlitta's enchilada sauce mix, added black olives, green onions, and added sour cream once cooked. They were a big hit with my family of six. I, myself would have rated it a 4 star, not because it lacked flavor, but because the tortillas were a bit soggy. Maybe the corn tortillas would work better for this reason alone. I like both types, but I'm thinking the corn are a bit more coarse and would cook better with sauce. Oh pretty easy too.

This is a great recipe! I'm not the best chef but occasionally I can whip up something pretty good when I use recipes. I found this when looking for quick, easy dinners that were also delicious. I did some tinkering with the recipe though. I used 75% of a 10 oz can of enchilada sauce instead of a packet, corn tortillas lightly fried (it gives it a more authentic taste), taco seasoning and minced onions while browning the meat, and I also threw in corn, olives, sliced green onions, chopped green chiles and jalapenos to the meat before putting it in the tortillas. Top off the enchiladas with a lot of cheese, more sauce, and your leftover olives, chiles, onions, and jalapenos and then pop it in the oven. I cooked it in the oven for 17 minutes and it was perfect! Served it with guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and cheesy refried beans and it was one of the best meals I've made! My boyfriend loves spicier food so he ATE IT UP. I definitely suggest this recipe...just tinker with it until you find the perfect combination of ingredients.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  After reading the reviews, I used yellow corn tortillas which I prepared by briefly frying them in hot oil - just a few seconds per side.  It worked out well and made the tortillas easy to handle.  I used a pre-made enchilada sauce and I added a small can of sliced jalapenos. I put some of the jalapenos in the enchiladas and sprinkled the remaining ones over the top.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Simple recipe and it's delicious. I serve it with rice and refried beans. Restaurant quality meal. No need to order beef enchiladas out. To make the rice I sauté onion and garlic in olive oil add the seasoning pepper, salt, cumin and turmeric saute for  couple of minutes then add the rice and sauté with the seasoning add the liquid chicken broth or water. For each cup of rice 2 cups of liquid. Enjoy!

Nice and easy to make. I made some adjustments based on what I had and what my family likes. I only had 6 tortillas so I stuffed them and used toothpicks to hold them together while they cooked. I didn't have olives or onions so I omitted them. I had a jar of Old El Paso Taco sauce so I used that for the bottom coating and on top of them as well. I used taco seasoning in my meat and liberally coated the top with Cheese.

Easy & quick enough for a weeknight family meal.  I used a can of mild & medium prepared enchilada sauce instead of packet.  Left off black olives.  Whole family enjoyed it...4 yr old even asked if we could have it again tomorrow night.

I really liked that this didn't take long to make!! I also added garlic and pepper to the ground meat. I cooked all of it using a packet of taco seasoning. I used corn tortillas that I pre-heated in a skillet. I used way more cheese than I probably should have, but it turned out great! Wonderful base recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was gorgeous! I changed it a bit, because I don't like olives, added extra garlic and a carrot, some extra chili and dried herbs also didn't have rosemary so I used basil. So I sort of changed it a fair bit really! But it was lovely and I will be doing it again for sure!

I changed it a little. I had left over steak/roast from the BBQ, I cut meat into strips, I added extra white onion in base of flour tortilla, added some black beans on top of that, then beef with a small can of green chile (mild) added, a dash of cumin, shredded Mexican style cheese, placed in pan and used red chile enchilada sauce on top. Turned out wonderful and not too spicey
Rave reviews, try it, fairly easy great for make ahead dinners..

I really liked these & I've never had a beef enchilada before.  I followed another reviewer and put taco seasoning in my beef and used a can of enchilada sauce rather than the package. My boyfriend, who was the reason I was making these, said they were so spicy he was getting heartburn after just one!  So...beware.  Definitely would recommend for others, but not sure I'll make again just b/c of the spicy factor and my boyfriend's heartburn.

I used corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas.  Using flour tortillas makes it wet burritos rather than enchiladas.  While I do like wet burritos, I was in the mood for enchiladas.

This was good but I didn't use canned Enchilada sauce because I think it smell's like upchuck. But to add dry taco or Enchilada powder to 16oz of tomato sauce and a half cup of beef or chicken broth has a very much better taste. But the rest I  did as said and it was easy and quick. Thanks again

Such positive results!  Recipe, as is, is the secret.  Too many of us change the recipes and screw them up.    My theory is, it isn't the tried and true recipe from a family/individual once it's messed with.

I will be honest...it's a good recipe, but it's not the BEST enchilada I've ever had. I added a couple ingredients as others suggested. I used a taco seasoning mix on the meat while it was cooking and I also added green chilis as a topper along with the cheese and the black olives. I did not use the powdered enchilada mix, I just used the sauce that comes in a can. I would suggest using around 16 oz of the sauce. It was pretty darn good and I will definitely use this again, but I will tweak it to my tastes a little bit more. Thanks for the recipe!

I did try this...but used corn tortillas instead. Flour tortillas get kind of gluey when wet. I heat the enchilada sauce and dip the tortillas in it to make them more pliable, after everything is rolled and put in the pan I pour the heated sauce over it. I also add chopped green onions on top of the cheese along with the sliced olive. For less fat use chopped or ground chicken. My sides were Mexican rice and re-fried beans.

This was easy and delicious!  I didn't need 10 servings, so I cut recipe in half - it yielded 4 enchiladas; 1 filled me up for dinner, and I took one to work the next day.  TASTES GREAT next day!  All my coworkers were asking me what it was and how I made it.  This is going into regular rotation. =)  Next time I'll get creative and try adding other fillers like green peppers, chiles or chicken.

These were very good! Of course I changed a few things as always :) I added black beans, garlic salt and cumin to the meat and onion and I used canned enchilada sauce. I also used WAY more cheese than it called for.

I have to say I doubted this recipes as-is, thinking it would be to bland, but I am happy to say I was very wrong.  It was so easy and got the seal of approval from my husband who doesn't like anything "too saucy", but he loved this!

My husband loved this!  The kids would have too if I had used a milder sauce, I will try this again soon.  I used a can of sauce and I may try making it myself next time.  I also added 1/2 a can of refried black beans to the hamburger mixture, as well as salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

Such a great and easy way to create a wonderful meal!  Like other reviewers, instead of the dry sauce mix I used enchilada sauce-- the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" recipe from this site, I highly recommend it!  My family loved it (although, we will probably be using corn tortillas next time) and we decided Sunday will be our regular Enchilada Day!

Yummy!! I also used taco seasoning and spread a little refried beans before adding the beef and cheese. Topped with canned enchilada sauce and more cheese. Mine were a little big and got 5 in a 9x13 dish (probably could have gotten another one in there as I had a little meat left over). Thought 5 was plenty. I was really glad i sampled 1/4 of one because that was all I got before it was gone! I don't care for corn tortillas much so I have never tried enchiladas. Will be making often!

Normally I'm not a big fan of enchiladas, but this tasted great. The taste was similar to a taco bell mexican pizza - yum! I like that there's no rice and there's just enough sauce so it's not overpoweringly tomato-ish. This was super easy to make and a big hit with my husband. Would be a perfect crowd-pleaser to take to a potluck!

Very tasty recipe that's easy to adapt.  I browned the ground beef and added taco seasoning.  I filled the flour tortillas with the meat and a mexican cheese blend and a drizzle of canned enchilada sauce.  In the baking dish I covered the bottom with sauce, then the enchiladas and poured a whole can of enchilada sauce over top.  I sprinkled with about 1 c. shredded cheddar and baked in a 400 degree oven for 20 min.  Served with sour cream . . Yummy!

I tweaked the recipe a bit..and it was pretty good. For the filling I used 96% fat free ground beef, 1 large onion, 1 clove of garlic, 1 can green chiles, 1 can black beans, and some cumin. I used a jar of Trader Joe's salsa authentico, low fat Mexican blend cheese, and whole wheat tortillas. They were quite tasty, and healthy as well! I will definitely make these again.

I didn't pay attention and made this with corn tortillas. I suggest dipping the corn tortillas in the enchilada sauce to keep them from breaking. I am trying to get my family to eat more fiber so the only intentional change I made was adding some vegetarian refried beans to the inside. Everything else was exact and yummy.

Super simple and fast to prepare.  I didn't put the black olives on top as I did not have them.  Served with spanish-style rice, it was fantastic.

I used this recipie as a guide.  I used corn tortillas, taco seasoning mix, canned enchilada sauce that I seasoned with onion, garlic and cumin powders and cayanne pepper (for a little heat).  I also seasoned the beef with garlic powder and cumin.  I usually have refried beans, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and Pace picante on the side for optional toppings.  My family & friends loves em!

I use ground turkey instead and added garlic.  Very yummy and easy to make.

Good basic recipe.  I used canned sauce instead of a packet, and instead of ground beef, I got two packages of the carnitas at Trader Joe's (goes it the microwave!) and seasoned them.  I also chopped up some avocados and cilantro and tossed them on top after baking.  Improved it significantly!

Need to put seasoning in ground beef, maybe a little taco seasoning.

I think this recipe is quite bland as written.  I made the following changes: Added a packet of cheesy taco seasoning and 2 Tbs. milk to the beef/onion mixture.  Then transferred the mixture to a large mixing bowl and mixed in 2 small cans of chopped green chiles, chile powder, salt, and pepper (all to taste).  I also ended up using more cheese, and used mont. jack.  Also, I used canned enchilada sauce instead of dry.

Yum! This was delicious. I did make some alterations. I used taco seasoning in the meat, corn tortillas instead of flour, and canned enchilada sauce instead of dry. This was cheesy, saucy, and delicious! I look forward to eating the leftovers.

Great Enchiritto recipe, could have used about 15 more min in the oven though. Was very good overall though and pretty quick and easy also, would be easier if you used canned enchilada sauce.

I tripled this recipe (3 teenage boys/husband to feed!) and used chicken breast. I let the chicken cook in the crockpot all day with a little chicken broth, a sm. can of tomato paste and spices. When done, shredded it and added enchilada sauce, some sauteed onion & garlic and more spice, couple shots of hot sauce, salt & pepper.  I filled flour tortillas with the mixture and some cheese, rolled & placed on top of some enchilada sauce in pans, then poured more sauce on top. Add cheese, sliced olives and bake (unfortunately the 1 store I went to did not have green onion).  My husband raved, this is a delicious recipe and easily tweaked to our tastes. This will be added to the regular rotation---THANKS!!

The only reason i couldn't give this five stars is because the meat was bland prior to me making modificaitons.  I spiced it up with the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site as well as two jars of enchilada sauce in the place of the dry mix.  These are the best beef enchiladas i have made.

My family and I loved these!  I did add taco seasoning to the meat once it was cooked.  This added lots of flavor!  Used enchilada sauce from a can to save time.  Will definitely make this again!

I added some powdered garlic and cumin to the beef mixture so it would have more flavor.  Used canned enchilada sauce.  Recommend using whole wheat tortillas.  They don't get soggy like flour ones and taste better and easy to use than corn.

Exactly the kind of recipe I'm looking for these days - quick, easy, flavorful and with built in clean up time (20 mins in the oven). I prepared the meat with taco seasoning, garlic and onion powders and green chilis. My husband loves this dish and I love that not only do we get leftovers but it calls for flour tortillas. Yes, I would rather go the traditional route with corn tortillas but I can't eat corn. This one goes on the list!

Very yummy!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, though.  I added taco seasoning and also used Colby cheese & canned enchilada sauce.  My husband said, "These are the best enchiladas I've ever had."

This was pretty good, but I made it more basic.  I used taco seasoning instead of enchilada seasoning.  I used Old El Paso medium red enchilada sauce and it gave it enough kick for us.  I omitted the black olives because my husband doesn't like them.  Good easy recipe to do.  Thanks!

Very good.  Will definitely make again. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that the beef mixture lacked flavor.  Next time I will add a packet of taco seasoning to the beef.

Yummy thanks! My tip is to add fresh garlic when cooking the beef, and to sprinkle the top with chopped green onions and parsley. I also salt+peppered the beef. I used canned enchilada sauce instead of a packet, and plenty more cheese, I also added a small amount of refried beans to each tortilla. And drank plenty of wine! A keeper fo rth esimplicity, quickness and variety you can change this one up a lot!

These were yummy, but the recipe itself was very basic, so I made several changes.  I cooked the ground beef with a homemade taco seasoning from this site.  I also had made homemade red sauce from this site.  I used colby and pepper jack cheeses, and I also put some corn in the enchiladas.  I skipped the olives because I didn't have any.

I completely modified this to the point that it probably was another recipe! Did chicken instead of beef, canned enchilada sauce vs. packet, and whole wheat tortillas. Plus I left off the olives (husband doesn't care for them). It was great. I'm sure the beef w/onions would be great, too.

This was really good! I too made a few changed, I was out of taco seasoning, so I added in some of the enchilada sauce into the meat when I cooked it.  I also added some ceyene pepper and cumin.  It was super easy and my picky husband and 3 year old loved it! :)

This is a good basic recipe, but could use some improvements to add more flavor.  I would use shredded beef (leftover pot roast is perfect to use for this) and add salsa to it before putting it in the tortillas.

Good and easy.  Used an enchilada sauce.  Added some garlic powder and cumin to the meat mixture, as well as a bit of the sauce.  I think this would be better with shredded beef instead of ground beef.

These were quite tasty.  I added 1/2 an envelope of taco seasoning to the meat as other people suggested.  They were easy to make and my husband who doesn't like Mexican food enjoyed them as did my 10 year old daughter.  I'd make them again.

These were very good and super easy to make.  I used the 10 minute enchilada sauce also found on this site rather than a packet (my grocery store doesn't carry a huge selection).  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was alright. Next time I think that I will make the enchilada sauce by hand. But if you need something quick, this is good

This meal was very easy and very delicious. I did what others suggested and used can enchilada sauce and added taco seasoning to the meat. I also ground my meat in my chopper.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good for a quick and easy meal.  I added some chopped onion and bell pepper to the beef (needed to use them).  Not what you would make if you wanted "real" enchiladas...but good for a quick weeknight meal.

I am a vegetarian so I used this recipe with veggie ground round instead of ground beef...and they were so good! My bf is a carnivore and even he liked them. I did leave out the black olives due to taste preferences. I was going to use green onion instead but I did not have any on hand. I used low-fat cheddar cheese and the end result was a delicious meal that wasn't quite as bad for you as Mexican food can be.

We really liked this recipe with a few of the suggestions from other reviewers. We added rice, used canned enchilada sauce (Hatch Tex-Mex), and taco seasoning while browning the lean ground sirloin.  I skipped the olives, but we ate all of the leftovers, which is very unusual for us.  We'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was a good springboard. I added the garlic and taco seasoning that others suggested. I also added a can of refried beans. I added fresh mushrooms and most of the cheese to the meat/bean mixture. Once the tortillas were filled, I topped with the olives and more mushrooms. I also used canned sauce. The end result was really good. Thanks both for the recipes and reviewer suggestions!

Hubby made these tonight and they were yummy! But..he seasoned the meat with the Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols from this site. He used 1.5lbs of
meat, added 1/2 the cheese and 1/2 can of refried beans to the meat mixture.
Pretty much did the the rest the same except
for the olives, didn't have any and really didn't miss them.
Easy quick and yummy we will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Used burrito seasoning when browning the beef & added in some green chilies (about 1 chili in a small can for 2 servings). Served with Spanish rice. This recipe was easy and good. Thanks for the recipe!

I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef, which cuts down on the sodium and fat content.

These were very good.I added green bell peppers to the hamburger mixture, and that was even better. I might try it with some refried beans or potatoes or something else in the filling. I really liked the black olives in it, also.

Ok - better than the supermarket 'boxed' enchilada meals. Not enough sauce - will double in future. Kind of plain with just beef, onion and cheese - might add something to it in future.

I used some taco seasoning in the meat mixture which added a bit more spice to the dish. I also used canned enchilada sauce because I couldn't find a mix. Then I served with sour cream and a side dish of Red Beans and Rice.

These are so good and so easy to make. I did make my own enchilada sauce using the recipe from Sara that's posted on here and is called Red Enchilada Sauce (tastes much better than anything that is purchased in the store). Also added a can of red beans and several very large spoonfuls of the prepared enchilada sauce to the meat mixture. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was bland too. I don't know what Enchilada sauce from a packet supposed to taste like, but it wasn't good. My husband wasn't to thrilled with it either, so I will be taking this recipe out of my box.

This is really good, so long as you do it right.  The first time I didn't realize I needed tomato sauce for the enchilada sauce, so I had to make do with ketchup...this made it way too salty.  The second time we made this, we used ground turkey, and it turned out really nice.  I also add green and red pepper to the meat mix because we like that.

These were very good and quite easy to prepare.  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey and canned enchilada sauce (Old El Paso)- hubby thought the sauce tasted "canned", but loved the recipe anyway.  Served with rice and refried beans.

This recipe was pretty good. I used canned enchilada sauce (to save some time), and I omitted the olives. The only thing I would change would be to use corn tortillas in place of the flour ones. I personally like the taste of the corn ones better.

Served this for two boys - of course they loved it! Easy, fast, cheap, however just didn't feel like it was that healthy, perhaps I'll add some veggies to it next time or something.

quick and delicious!  I used green pepper instead of onion.  Don't add taco seasoning-much too salty. I also used two cans of enchilada sauce instead of dry mix. Yum!

These are good, but they are very simple. Personally I like things with a little more flavor so I added some spices and green chiles to the meat mixture.  Very easy to prepare.

Very good. I use canned ortega enchalada sauce and I also add some sourcream to my meat mixture. I like my meat really fine so I put in the food processer before I roll it. I am the only one in my family that likes onions so I add green onions only on top of mine.

Great recipe ! I did however take a previous reviewer's advice that the recipe was a bit bland so I added a pack of taco seasoning mix along with 1/2 a cup of water to the cooked and drained meat and simmered it a few minutes before placing the meat on the tortillas. I also used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix pack. I also omitted the black olives since my family doesn't care for these, but the recipe still turned out great !

This recipe is GREAT!!! Fun to play around with too. 
I used a jar of enchilada sauce instead of the packet, added some spices, like chili powder, to the meat and used jalapenos slices instead of olives (my fiance doesn't like olives) and they were awesome! I even added some beans to a few to try and that also made a great addition. No need for all the sauce on the bottom, just a little bit spread over the bottom will do it.

This was a very fast and easy recipe! I used canned enchilada sauce and cooked my meat in taco seasoning for more flavor! The second time making it I used chicken instead and it was just as good. My husband raved about it and he doesn't usually like Mexican dishes!

This was very good.  Even my very picky son loved it! I did use suggestions by others and seasoned the beef with taco seasoning and I doubled the sauce. Served sour cream on the side, refried beans and yellow rice...YUMMY!

This dish was just ok.  Not working with enchilada sauce before, I didn't realize it can be so bland.  I think next time I will saute some peppers with the hamburger and onion along with adding some spices such as cumin, cayenne pepper, and maybe even some garlic salt or powder.  Might give it another shot, but definately needs some taste.

YUM! This recipe was wonderful. I changed a few items due to personal preference. In place of the onion I used a green pepper and I stirred in taco seasoning when cooking the beef to add more flavor. I also opted for the canned enchilada sauce instead of the dry sauce. It was very tasty!

AWESOME! I also added a packet of taco seasoning and a green bell pepper to the beef/onion mixture, as well as a can of enchilada sauce. I poured 3 cans of enchilada sauce (2 hot, 1 mild) over the enchiladas once in the baking dish, and MMMMMMM, MM!!! They were amazing! Not dry in the least.

Good and Easy enchilada recipe. Only thing is it should say 8oz. tomato sauce in the list of ingredients..I got everything together and did not have that on hand. So I used pizza sauce..only thing close to tomato sauce I had in the pantry. Sounds weird but it actually was good. Next time we will get the tomato sauce though.

Great!! Used 2 cans of enchilada sauce and added taco seasoning like several others and it turned out delicious.  I used wheat tortillas and my husband could not tell the difference from flour.  Very yummy and easy to put together.  I will definitely make again!

This is good for a quick enchilada recipe.  I have another recipe that is more time consuming and the sauce is made from scratch.  I prefer my own sauce to the canned.

This recipe is SO incredibly good, and really could not be easier!  Just watch out - if you use the dry enchilada sauce mix, you're going to need a can of tomato paste too (it's not in the ingredients list, but it says so on the back of the packet).  I like to tuck in some refried beans and corn with the beef and cheese.

This is basicly a good recipe.  The first time I made it I followed to the letter.  I did not like the use of flour tortillas and the beef needed a little more kick.  So the next time I made it I used corn tortillas, added some chopped green chili's to the beef and I also dipped the tortillas in the enchilada sauce after I softed them in a lot bit of hot oil.  I will be using this recipe again with the modifications.

We found these to be average. Not all that flavorful, kinda plain actually. I should have known better and added the stuff we like but I followed the recipe as written. I wont make them the way the recipe says to next time.

Excellent!  Easy to prepare and the entire family enjoyed it, even the 2 and 3 year old.  I did add taco seasoning to the hamburger as well.  Nice touch, but a bit salty.

I did change the recipe slightly.  I read a few of the other comments and decided to add some cumin and red pepper flakes to the gr beef/onion and fried that down with a small can of green chilies, then added  a can of re fried beans and heated till all mixed and hot.  Also made 2 cups of white rice (plain). Put a lttle of the canned enchilada  sauce on the bottom-assembled the flour tort )sm amount of sauce  to coat bottom/beef mix/rice and cheese then rolled them up and put in sauced pan, repeated till all ing were gone, poured all the remaining sauce on top then cheese baked 350 for 30 min....absolutely loved it!  Will make again and so easy!

Great basic recipe!  Fun to augment with yummy stuff.  I added Rotel and taco seasoning to the meat then sprinkled in some fresh diced jalapeños while rolling the tortillas.  It turned out fantastic.  (reminder to self: McCormick dry enchilada packet is way better than canned)

I felt it was a little dry.  Don't like olives to left those out.  Served them on shredded lettuce with salsa and sour cream.  Seems it needed more in the filling - rice and cheese? Also had refried beans with cheese.  Probably will use a different recipe next time.

I was agnostic on the tortilla debate, but after making the dish I would definitely recommend corn tortillas if you like a lot of enchilada sauce...   The flour ones were a bit gummy.  I'm from NM, so I think I'll try white or blue corn tortillas as they have a milder flavor...

Very good.  I had no olives but none the less the 10 I made was gone in no time between 3 of us.  I used 2lbs of ground beef for 10.  I also had to make my own enchilada sauces mix.

This is my favorite!! It's a staple in my family menu. The only thing I changed (as per personal taste) was adding a pack of taco seasoning and lots of garlic. Simple and yet flavorful.

So very good.  Husband couldn't stop raving about it.  So easy too.  All I did was sprinkle a little chili powder on the beef and onion after browning.   Other reviewers mentioned taco seasoning, but husband said that would have been too much, the little chili powder was all I needed.

Couldn't find the dry enchilada sauce, so I just used canned. Tasty, but not exceptional.

Kinda follow the recipe.  I added three hard boiled eggs to the meat mixture, and yes I did use corn tortillas!  Layered enchiladas sauce on bottom of pan, placed meat mixture and heap of cheese to tortilla, put a can of tomatoes and green chilies, topped with rest of enchiladas sauce, lots of cheese and black olives.  Placed casserole in refrigerator for about 4 hours.  Baked 370 for 30 minutes.  Topped with cilantro, sour cream and sliced green onions.  Delish,

I used green sauce as I was looking to get rid of it.  I think I used too much sauce as the tortillas got soggy.  However, it tasted good, and my company liked it.  I would add taco seasoning next time to give it some spice.

This is an easy and good recipe.  I used canned enchiladas sauce.  I will not use black olives next time because it doesn't really add anything to the dish.

I preheated my oven to 375 and cooked for 20mins instead of 30. I used corn tortillas instead of flour, cooked up some Mexican rice and add that to my beef mixture along with a cup of cheese, however, not for any reason other than I love Mexican rice and wanted to stuff it into my enchiladas and of corse extra cheese is always awesome.

It was a long time since I made enchiladas and these brought me back. They are easy to make and had great flavor! I put cheese inside the tortillas too. Also had too double the sauce because we like them saucy. Will make again!

Was a good basic recipe. Nothing special. It needs more spice though. Next time adding a can of chilies to the meat mix, and cayenne or hot sauce . The meat mixture does not fill 10 tortillas, more like 8. Unless you want them super thin. All in all, I think it's definitely a versatile recipe. I can see using with shredded chicken or shredded beef (like left over pot roast or short ribs). And next time using corn tortillas as I normally would.

This was a super easy to make dish. I used flour tortillas because it is what we had in the house. I also added jalepeno's to the meat because we like a little bit of spice. It was not overpowering at all. I used tooth picks to hold the tortillas together when baking them. I also used the canned enchilada sauce & Mexican cheese. It was absolutely delicious with a side of sour cream.

This was absolutely delicious, and my picky boyfriend raved on and on about how amazing it tasted.  I will make it again!!!!
I followed the recipe with these two tweaks (not really deviating from recipe), which turned out excellently. We like our food a little on the saltier side, so beware of following my tweaks. 
I used one packet of El Paso taco seasoning when browning the beef. This made it extra tasty, but again, we like our food on the more flavorful side. 
The tortillas I bought from Whole Foods horribly broke apart as I was following directions and trying to roll the enchiladas. I then decided to deconstruct it and layered enchilada sauce, the tortillas next on the bottom , then meat mixture, then tortilla, then sauce, then cheese, and finally a can of black olives. No rolling!!! 
If you’re not great at rolling or don’t want to roll, just layer like a casserole or lasagna type dish. It works wonders.

All of us do not eat corn tortillas,  and some of us really do not like the taste of them.  We all eat flour tortillas, and really liked this recipe.  Very good, don't care about authenticity.

Made this a few weeks ago and the kids loved it.  I doubled up the recipe and made two pans (one with jalapenos and one without).  However,  my youngest complained it was a little bland.  Not sure why.  I think the second time around, I may add some garlic and green chilis.

I made this with left over steak. I cut the cooked steak into small pieces and fried a medium onion then at he last minute I added the cooked beef. I made my own enchilada sauce. My family devoured it. There were not any left overs.

I made this and thought it was so plain. It lacks flavor. I would rather have taco bell than these. :/

I added taco seasoning packet to the meat. Other than that I kept to the original recipe. It was amazing ! We had no left overs.  I will be making this again !

Super easy on any weeknight, and the family eats the whole pan.  Is it authentic?  No, but that doesn't make it less tasty.  I just use a can of enchilada sauce instead of making the packet stuff, and I also add taco seasoning to the beef.  Top with a dollop of sour cream and green onions when serving, and you've got a tasty weeknight staple.

Made these for Cinco de Mayo last night.  Never made them before.  I thought they were pretty tasty and I will definitely make them again.  I did make a couple of changes tho.  I know. Shame on me.  lol   I couldn't find dry enchilada sauce in an envelope, so I had to use canned sauce.  I also spread a small amount of refried beans in with the hamburger mixture and cheese.  Other than that, I followed the directions as they were.

These were very easy to make, but lacked flavor.   Adding spices to the meat (i.e. cumin or chili powder) and possibly adding canned chili peppers or picante sauce either to the meat or on top would have been helpful.  The flour tortillas turned out to be "gummy".  Corn tortillas would have been a better choice.

I will make these again!  I added a packet of taco seasoning to the hamburger and onions, and I had a green pepper to use up, so I chopped that and added that too. I added a fresh sliced jalapeno to the top along with the cheese and sliced black olives. I used a can of enchilada sauce rather than a packet.  I topped mine with sour cream. Really good!

Thank you to those who pointed out that flour tortillas are not the ones usually used for enchiladas.  I was looking for an "enchilada" recipe, because we have had them at restaurants and wanted to recreate that taste.  Without the HELPFUL reviewers who pointed out that corn tortillas is what is usually used, I would have purchased and used the wrong thing, and then been disapppointed.  More info is always better.

Did anyone else also have a hard time finding dry enchilada mix?  Made this tonight, used enchilada sauce in a pouch.  I always follow a new recipe exactly the first time and I agree with other reviewers, it is a good base but definitely needs tweaking.  Next time will try adding seasoning to the meat and some green chilies and will try making the enchilada sauce recipe on this site.

I changed things up a little. I put a packet of mild taco seasoning in while browning the hamburger meat. I also substituted canned red enchilada sauce and corn tortillas.

Yum! Added refried beans and rice to filling. I made it with guacamole, remaining beans and sour cream on the side. Just used a leftover packet of sauce from taco kit so it was a little light on sauce. 10/10 would make again!!!

In a rush for dinner tonight. Used leftover chicken from last night, added tablespoon + sour cream, Mexican cheese blend and assembled everything, tossed it in the oven and voila! Dinner in 30 minutes. Big thumbs up from husband and daughter (10). Will definitely make this again.

I was in Laredo (boarder of Mexico and Texas) this weekend at the deer lease, with my husband. For dinner one of the evening the Cooks made beef enchiladas. I was seriously  disappointed  .... SoOo... I decided to satisfy my craving, and This was definitely the recipe! ! !
 I liked that the  video mentions using a bottled sauce or the packet. I used bottled, "Sprounts brand original enchilada sauce."  Highly HIGHLY recommend! I Bought super soft tortillas. I Used Sharp cheddar cheese,  sautéed the ground beef with onions, garlic, and added a small can of GREEN CHILIES !! This blew those lacking enchiladas out of the water. my husband gave it rave reviews, even asking me to pack the leftovers in his lunch!

My family enjoyed this recipe so much.. I had to fight for the leftovers, ( lunch the next day ) ! I did use the canned sauce, as I had some on hand and it cuts the time,,  and added taco seasoning , garlic and onions to the meat.

I made this recipe just as is.  It was nicely quick and easy.  However, I thought the flavor was just okay.  I also definitely prefer corn tortillas for enchiladas to flour.  I might try it again using corn tortillas and a tweak or two.

Made with the 10 minute enchilada sauce allrecipe.com recipe.  Added green peppers, black beans and the black olives to the ground beef.  Very good meal, will add to the rotation.

My husband wanted enchiladas, so I looked for a recipe that looked good and found this one. Although, I only had one small can of enchilada sauce which wasn't enough, so I added 1/2 bottle of salsa to the mixture on top of the enchiladas and then the cheese. Also, I saute' the onions in the beef and added some tex mex chili seasoning to give it flavor. It turned out delicious ... a little sweetness to the spice ;)

This is the second time I have made this. I added black beans and seasoning to the meat and onions. I also used canned enchilada sauce and it was even better this time.

I love the taste and it was easy to make. 
The enchiladas stuck to the dish so I'm going to spray it with Pam next time.
Once I had some on my plate I added sour cream and it made it perfect

I made the original and it was wholly unremarkable.  The second time I added taco seasoning, diced tomatoes, and green chiles to the beef.  I didn't put the enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan, but I use it to top off the enchiladas. I also omitted the olives.

This turned out much better for my family's taste. :-)

It was pretty good, especially for my first time making enchiladas. I made half of them with just beans because that's what my husband wanted and I added rotel tomatoes and used some shredded queso cheese on top. Next time I'm trying pork. This was very filling and my husband loved it so I will be making it again!

I wasn't sold on such a simple recipe, but these turned out great! Without adding anything, we got very mild, but tasty enchiladas. Lots of good suggestions in the reviews for additions to make this a hearty, single-dish meal.

I made the recipe exactly as is and it was very easy and tasty.  My picky 7 year old loved it.  It's more helpful to try a recipe before you review it than to rate it low because you don't like the idea of it.  You're missing out.

Excellent! I browned the beef, added the diced onions and cooked until soft then added a can of tomato paste and 2 tablespoons of flour,  continued cooking until paste was roasted then added a can of beef broth, 1/2 tablespoon each of cumin and garlic powder and cooked until slightly thickened. No need for  enchilada sauce. Assemble  per recipe and bake    :)

I used corn also because they are gluten free.  I sautéed each one to give them a little more moisture and put a little sauce in each one.

For as easy as it was, it was great.  My picky eaters liked it surprisingly.  I used corn instead of flour tortillas and Hatch Red Enchilada sauce in the can instead of dry package.

I did make a couple of changes to the recipe, i added minced garlic and taco seasoning to the meat, and I used corn tortillas instead. Corn tortillas taste soo much better and extra cheese on top with the black olives.Anne Collins

This was pretty good,  but even after adding cumin, salt , and garlic it was still a little bland.  I made them with corn tortillas, which in my opinion have more flavor than flour ones.  Maybe it was the sauce I used....I will use this recipe and build on it, experiment with it.

I'm hispanic and prefer corn tortillas, my boyfriend is Caucasian and prefers flour. I think it's an awesome thing that people change recipes to their own liking, and to the available ingredients in their area. I don't think any hispanic should criticize this recipe based on the flour tortillas. After all, everyone's recipes are different and pretty sure they started out different then what they are now. great recipe! Added a change, as many people do,  added plenty of garlic :D

My husband loves these. I use canned sauce in lieu of the powdered. If you want a little more spice add taco seasoning to the beef. I make up a double batch or more of the beef mixture & freeze the prepared tortillas in freezer bags. Just thaw them in the refrigerator & then bake as directed.

I doubled this recipe for my ever-growing family of five adult children, their spouses and my six grandchildren and they devoured every single bite! I especially want to thank other reviewers for their extra hints which made this dish even BETTER! I added green chilies, refried beans, taco seasoning and used lots of El Paso enchilada sauce! Yum - will definitely make this again and again!

Recipe needs more seasoning. A half-package of taco seasoning would help. I used a dry enchilada seasoning packet that called for adding 8-oz. of tomato sauce, and the finished sauce tasted too much like tomato soup. I give the recipe a C-.

I made a few changes. I used turkey meat instead of hamburger meat. Taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce(we were out) and one clove of garlic and a jalapeno pepper instead of black olives. My family and I loved it.

This is a keeper! The enchiladas were delicious! I followed some of the suggestions of using corn tortillas and seasoning the meat with garlic and taco seasoning as it browned. My picky eaters went back for seconds!

Easy to make. Need to season meet well while cooking with the onions and I used taco seasoning by directions. I should have dipped the tortillas in the enchilada sauce first but all in all they came out good. I used can sauce but it was watery I will try the mix next time. Made Mexican rice on the side. I'd make this again.

Not a fan of corn tortilla flavor so I have always made enchiladas with flour tortillas. My family loved this recipe and it was also a favorite at my daughter's Volleyball Team Dinner. I also added taco seasoning mix to my beef and refried beans and used canned sauce along with the dry sauce mix. Yummy

As for the debate on corn or flour tortillas in this recipe, if you go to any Mexican restaurant and order an enchilada, it will be made with a corn tortilla. The thing to remember is this is just a recipe, not a statement against or for any ethnicity. I for one favor the corn tortilla when I make my enchiladas. I found this version to be very good with my own addition of spices to Mex it up a little bit. I also added the sliced tomato on top as per the picture provided. It did make this recipe unique and flavorful.

This recipe is simple and quick. If I made them again, I'd add seasoning or spices to the beef-something to enhance the flavor because they're slightly bland without. Nonetheless, this is a great basic recipe to build off of!

This was a quick and easy meal to prepare, but not spectacular.  I used Lowry's enchilada mix, and didn't care for the flavor - it was nothing like the canned enchilada mix I am used to.  I'll make this again, but with the canned enchilada mix.

I agree with the lady who mentioned flour tortillas. Also, I added some packaged taco seasoning to the meat and some scallions! The added texture was just fine. I also used medium white cheddar by the truckload, great!

A very easy way to liven up the menu lineup.  We all know by now that genuine enchiladas are made with corn tortillas; not everyone likes corn tortillas.  That doesn't sound the death knell for this recipe.  I found this to be a refreshing change of pace without being overly time consuming, expensive or stunningly spicey.  Good stuff!

We liked it!  Last night I made Sloppy Joes and I used the leftover sloppy joe mix as the base for this tonight.  It was just ground beef with chili sauce (and a few other ingredients) but it was perfect.

Next time I'll try another type of enchilada sauce.  I tried Trader Joe's tonight and it was okay.  My daughter complained it was too spicy and wouldn't eat it after that.  Regardless, my husband and I liked it but I'll probably try a Mexican brand instead (Goya or another - Sofrito sauce might be good in this).

Quick, easy, done and delicious! I served with a dollop of light sour cream on top.  Wondering if anyone has tried freezing half recipe, just ready for the oven?

I love this recipe for its good flavor, simplicity and adaptation.  I use to roll the tortilla's and for years now, I just layer this recipe like lasagna.  I also use flour tortilla's.  My kids love it!  Served with refried beans and a salad.  Very simple!!

I made it and my kids loved it!!! I was skeptical about using too much sauce, and the first time they came a little dry. However, the second time a used more sauce and they are awesome. I used turkey instead of beef, added garlic and adobo for more flavor. I used fresh corn tortillas(my preference).

I dont think anyone has a problem with substituting ingredients to suit their own taste. It's still a good recipe and many people prefer their "enchiladas" this way.

Really quick, good base recipe; I added red pepper flakes and garnished with sour cream, guac, cilantro and green onions. For the purists that want corn tortillas, give it a try with the flour ones- I only had flour on hand and didn't have a choice (nearest grocery store is 45 minutes away), but glad I tried this!

I make this all the time but add beans to mine.  I use corn/flour tortillas whatever i have time to make.  both are good.  I serve with sour cream/tomatoes/lettuce on side depending on how the family wants to dress it up.

The  meat is very bland.  It needs something to give it some flavor.  I added some Adobo seasoning and cumin and that didn't even help.  The only thing adding flavor is the cheese and sauce.  I was very disappointed.

Nice easy meal ... although more of a burrito than an enchilada (due to the flour tortillas).  I got the idea (from a restaurant I like) of adding a finely diced potato and a 1/2 bell pepper to the frying meat -- I can see myself creating a few different varieties with this recipe.
Thanks.

Only gave 3 stars because u do need to add taco seasoning to the meat for flavor, and corn tortillas would be much better, which I intend to try next. I also added chopped green chiles to the meat, along with the onion. I also used canned enchilada sauce instead of powder mix. Very good though with some tweaks!

Downright delicious! I followed the other reviews' advice on spices though- Adding salt, pepper, garlic powder, and green chili. And since I forgot the enchilada sauce, tomato sauce with a little salsa worked deliciously. Adding some extra cheese and fresh tomato: this dinner was one of my favorites. Thank you so much for sharing!

This was a good base recipe to tweak to your personnal tastes. I added taco seasoning to beef mixture. Thought it could use more cheese on the inside of enchiladas.I can never have too much cheese! Next time I make this I will try using a homemade enchilada sauce instead. We used canned sauce which was easier and O.K. but homemade would make this recipe alot better.

We loved these enchiladas, and will definitely make again. Even my two year old ate these so we consider this a great success. I didn't change anything about this recipe and thought it was wonderful exactly the way the recipe stated.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tasted great but was very messy! I used 2 small cans of enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix, 1 tsp. of onion powder instead of a chopped onion, no olives, corn tortillas in place of four tortillas and I mixed 1 tbsp. of chopped jalapenos in with the meat I cooked in taco seasoning. I lightly fried the corn tortillas in oil which made them not break when rolled up. I also used toothpicks to keep them together. After they cooled I used fat-free sour cream as a topping. I ended up with 13 mini enchiladas so I had to use a 9x13 and another pan.

This recipes is tasty. I made my own enchildas sauce which i think makes a big difference and takes no time at all. There is one on this site that is great. (Red Enchiladas sauce) My husband hates olives so i left them off but i'm sure they would be great. Next time i will add some enchiladas sauce to the filling to give it a tad more flavor. I will make again.

The tortillas got a little soggy during baking. Gotta think of a way to fix that. Also, make sure to season the beef with all your favorite chili powders, garlic salts, seasoned salts, etc. and taste the beef before rolling it up in the tortillas.   Hey, it was a really tasty and simple recipe if you ask me. Thank you for posting it!

The meat in the middle was a little too bland for my taste.  I tried adding taco seasoning, but it overshadowed the taste of the enchilada sauce.

Great option! I used Ground Turkey instead of beef for a healthier choice!

These were really good.  I added a packet of taco seasoning and red & green pepper to the ground beef with onion.  I had a can of enchilada sauce, so I used that  and added a can of rotel.  I kept with the recipe and used the flour tortillas (and it was good), but will use corn tortillas next time.  This was quick and easy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

If you don't like FLOUR tortillas find another recipe.  You can use whatever YOU WANT, it's a matter of preference, yes even in Mexico... I found this to be a perfect base recipe. I followed the directions and loved it. My family loves it. Thanks so much

This recipe uses simple ingredients to make simple enchiladas.  I served the black olives on the side because most people in my house don't like them.  I also used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the mix.  Almost the entire pan was eaten.  In addition to the beans and rice served with them.  Thank you.

These turned out great! I pretty much followed the recipe, but bought pre-made enchilada sauce and used corn tortillas instead. I also used chipotle taco bell seasoning with the meat while it was being cooked. My roommate and my girlfriend loved it, as well as myself.

These were quite good. Not authentic by any means, but good. I added some chunky salsa and half package of taco seasoning to meat after cooked and drained. I boiled the dry enchilada mix and about a cup and a half of water and also added a small can of tomatoe sauce to that. I did not add the olives but added chopped chives after baking. Will do again!

I made these for my husband as I am a vegetarian.  He grew up eating authentic Mexican but has not had much since we have been married.  :)  Anyway, he said he definitely enjoyed the meal, but said that I should still try other enchilada recipes...he thought there should be more inside the tortillas than just the plain meat and cheese.  I think next time I will try a recipe that has cream cheese or sour cream in the mixture.

These are wonderful! OK so they are not made with the "authentic" corn tortillas, but it doesn't say anywhere in the title or recipe that they are authentic. Some people prefer flour over corn, I used whole wheat flour tortillas (nothing traditional or authentic about that!) and they were still really good. Atleast this recipe doesn't have cream of something or other soup in it. I did go the more traditional way and fried the tortillas then dipped them in the enchilada sauce before filling them with the meat mixture. This method is very measy and not sure if it is really neccesary. I did use a canned enchilada sauce that I mixed with one can of jalapeno salsa. I didn't use the black olives didn't have any! Great recipe and will make again. Thank you.

These were wonderful!!   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I believe, like others, that TRUE enchiladas should be made with corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas!  My family loved these including my 6 yr old who is pretty picky!

These were great!! The only thing I changed about them was after buying the dry enchilada mix I realized that I didn't have tomato sauce to mix it with like the package said so I used some leftover stewed tomatoes, and they made these incredible!!!! And of course a little extra cheese before baking and sour cream before serving, yummy!!!

Good recipe but it needs something more. Maybe rice in the enchiladas and more sauce? I just found it a little lacking.

Loved this quick and easy recipe.  Doubled it and added geen chilies and garlic along with the ground beef.  You can add hot sauce to the mix if you want. It is so easy you can add whatever you like.  Thanks for an easy great recipe.

Very good with taco seasoning added to ground beef. Also used bottled enchilada sauce.  Served with Spanish rice and muffins.  Hearty meal : )
Edited 10/28
Still use this recipe, but I now make "Ten Minute Enchilada  Sauce" from this site.  I do reduce the amount of chili powder  called for in the sauce!
Also have used chicken in place of  the ground beef.  Still a great recipe.

Mexican is mine and my hubbys favorite. I was really nervous to try to make a mexican meal but this one was a hit! He loved them and I loved them and the picky kids even ate them with no fuss! Kudos to this recipe I will be making this again! I made these and paired it with spanish rice and some Churros and vanilla bean ice cream with a little chocolate syrup drizzled over the top and woo hoo I have made a complete mexican meal everyone enjoyed! Thanks for this one i will use it often!

This was good.  I didn't use as much cheese on the top because it wasn't necessary.  You can modify to your own taste.  I also used corn tortillas and the flour tortillas were tastier.  Very simple and fast so we will make this one again.  Thanks!

Tasty!  I used one large can and one smaller can of enchilada sauce because I do not like dry enchiladas.  I did add taco seasoning, but next time I think I'm going to try to up the flavor a little more with some green chiles.

This was delicious! I will double the sauce next time and I recommend serving with extra cheese, extra extra sour cream and lettuce. I made with flour and corn tortillas and my family enjoyed the flour much better. This recipe was not meant to be authentic so I don't understand the bad reviews for that reason.

This recipe is great.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using whole wheat flour tortillas.  Very delicious, easily assembled and looks good too.  Presentation is important in my house.

This is a really nice quick way to make enchiladas. The only thing I changed was adding taco seasoning to the beef as it was browning to give it a little more flavor.

Easy, inexpensive and delicious. A perfect combination these days!.  Like others, I added taco seasoning and garlic to the beef and onion mixture and I used a can of ready made enchilada sauce rather than making one up from a powder.   My husband has asked that I make them again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

We make this all the time but we make a few changes....first, we eliminate the onions (for the kids) and add a package of taco seasoning to the meat. Then we use corn tortillas instead of flour. It's super easy and the kids love it (so does my husband)!!

An excellent recipe. I also took the advice of others and added some spanish rice to the ground beef mixture. It was a definite hit!

I made it this evening and we all love it. I changed it a little bit though. I sauted ground beef & onion with taco powder. Instead of using olives, we used Mexican rice. It's so yummy when we had it with sour cream. I'll definitely make it again. :) Thank for the recipe.

I've definitely made better.  I added rice to stretch the recipe and added taco seasoning mix to give it some flavor, otherwise it would have been bland.

These turned out pretty good - my boyfriend said to add it to the "must make again" list. I did change some things... I added 2 t. garlic and some taco seasoning to the beef and used canned enchilada sauce. I used flour tortillas because I couldn't find corn tortilla, and they turned out a little soggy - next time will definately use corn. Good recipe!

This recipe was wonderful! My husband loved it so much he told me not to cook the next night so he could eat leftovers! I added fresh chopped cilantro and green chilis. Turned out great! I will be making this again.

No they aren't tradional enchiladas but they are very good.  Next time I am may double the enchilada sauce.. the packet I bought was Mcormicks and I don't know what happened but after baking them in the oven the sauce was absorbed & they turned out a little dry.  I would also add some more seasoning to the meat.  This recipe would be good using chicken too.  I would also add some jalepenos for a little kick!  But for a inexpensive and easy meal this is fantastic!

It's okay, but the tortillas really need to be corn.  It also didn't have much taste.  I've had better.

I ate these two nights in a row, but I won't make them again.  There was something missing.  I don't know if it was because of the flour tortillas, but I think I can definitely find a better recipe.

We thought these were good. I used canned enchilada sauce to make them and did as some other reviewers did and put some sauce in with the hamburger,and also some cumin and chili powder in with the meat. We also put a bit of the cheese in to. 
Then folded them up. Topped with more enchilada sauce. A good recipe for a quick meal!!

this was very easy, a nice change from corn tortillas. i did use ground turkey, a homemade enchilada seasoning substitute, and shredded mexican cheese blend. forgot the black olives, but they didnt need them. made with brazilian white rice(from this site)and tortilla chips with homemade salsa. will make again. Update made these again with half lb ground beef and 1/2 can drained black beans. I liked them even better with the black beans. I saved with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and green onions.

Not a bad idea, just substitute corn for flour, maybe mix filling w cream cheese.

Not bad. An easy dinner that will please the family. I did add the taco seasoning to the burger though, I think it would've been really bland without it. I also used turkey burger to make it a little more healthy.

This is a really great recipe and simple. As suggested by other reviewers, I used a sauce rather than the dry enchilada mix (the ten minute enchiladas sauce recipe was really easy to make). My whole family including my seven-year-old who never eats anything loved it.

Very easy to make! I made it for a charity group I'm a part of and this meal received rave reviews.  I added a couple of gloves of minced garlic to the ground beef.  Yum!

These were GREAT!  Even my super-picky 3-year old ate every bite.  I definitely prefer the soft taco tortillas to the corn tortillas.  The texture is soft.

I made these according to R&R's changes & the dish turned out wonderfully.
Also used flour tortillas as it a family preference in making all Mexican dishes that call for tortillas. 
Great recipe.

I made these because I had some extra tortillas I wanted to use up. They were simple and good. I used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the mix, and I used 1 and 1/2 cans because otherwise it seemed too dry. I also added about 1/4 cup more cheese. Overall, very moist and tasty.

I think these taste great.  I used 2 lbs of ground chuck and added 2 teaspoons of Sofrito to the meat after it was browned, along with a packet of Sazon.  I also made some Arroz con Gandules along with the enchiladas for a complete meal.

This is an excellent recipe.  As stated by previous reviews if you are from Mexico I guess this isn't the recipe for you.  Use your Mom's recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter and we were all very happy including my 4 year old.

I've been making this dish with several modifications for over a year, and it's definitely a favorite at our house.  I use the Italian seasoned ground turkey from Jennie-O to make it healthier.  While the turkey is browning, I make a batch of Red Enchilada Sauce from this site--it's better than the mixed stuff, and isn't much harder to do.  (Note:  you'll probably have a little leftover sauce.)  Finally, I make super-sized enchiladas and stuff them into a 9x9 pan for the big eaters in my house.

This was great I followed the comments and used taco seasoning for the meat and enchilada sauce in a can.  I also also some more onion, garlic, and green chiles.  My husband loved it and he is hispanic.  It was really fast and easy too!

This was a really quick and easy meal for during the week and it tasted great. I used a large can of sauce instead of the dry mix. Next time I think I will add taco seasoning to the meat.

I was NOT looking for "authentic", just a quick, easy and tasty meal for 2. This turned out GREAT! I did add some canned green chilis and about a teaspoon of chopped garlic to the ground beef while browning (the kind of chopped garlic you can just buy in a big jar). I also used a jar of enchilada sauce instead of the powdered sauce mix. We garnished with sour cream. My husband loves it. It's become a regular meal in our house. Thanks for sharing! =)

This was a really good dish.  I only had enough ground beef to make 9 enchiladas, but they were definitely a hit.  I knew the meal was good when my 16 month old cleaned her plate and my picky 3 year old ate about half his meal (that says a lot, considering he doesn't eat anything).  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I also took the suggestion to add taco seasoning, and I used a whole can (1#) of enchilada sauce.  I also added chunky mild salsa which added a tangy flavor to it.  I had enough meat to fill 6 of the 10 tortillas, but that was ok because that was all I could fit in the 9X13 pan.  With 3 of us eating, we had 1 left over.  I also served Spanish rice on the side.  Yummy!!

This was the first time I'd ever made enchiladas, and they came out great!!! I barely touched the mexican rice I made it with because I couldnt keep my fork out of them. My boyfriend drizzled hot sauce over the top and loved it. These really hit the spot, I just couldnt get enough. Only slightly negative parts were that I couldn't fit 10 (10 inch) tortillas in my 9x13 pan, but didn't have enough meat to fill more anyway (one other downside...). I also added taco seasoning mix to the meat as many recommended and canned enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix. Also, barely used half an onion in the meat and it was plenty. Overall a very tasty meal, I will deffinately make them again with a few adjustments, maybe smaller tortillas. They even warmed up pretty well the next day!

Really liked this for a basic enchilada recipe.  I cooked up the hamburger and then added about a cup of salsa to it, then follow the rest of the recipe as directed except for the black olives.  My children and I do not like them.  I have made this twice and the kids love it.

Instead of ground beef I used leftover herbed chicken.  If you like Tex-Mex, you'll like these!  I added cilantro.  Next time, I'll use a bit of extra sauce because there wasn't quite enough.  These make a good and quick family-pleasing sort of meal.

The preparation was easy in this recipe, but I wasn't thrilled.  It was a little too bland for me.  Still looking for a enchilada recipe.

This filling need something more maybe some spices or some refried beans. Easy recipe though. I used the red enchiladas sauce recipe from this site.

I give it for stars since it was so easy.  It was pretty good for not being authentic, but it was bland in my opinion.  It was better heated up the next day.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Very good for as easy a recipe as this is! I like to use meat seasoned with taco seasoning. Can adjust the total # of servings if you have left-over taco meat to use up.

This was great!  Hubby even liked it though he said it's weird w/flour tortillas instead of corn.  Will definitely make this again!!! I use the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site. My children devour this dish every time! thanks

This recipe was easy and pretty good. I added green chiles, cilantro,garlic, & some cumin. I also used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the packaged kind as other reviewers suggested. I think it would be even better with shredded beef instead of ground beef.

Very good!! I did tweak it a bit, using a can of enchilada sauce instead of the packet. I added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef and also a small can of sweet corn. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was really tasty and incredibley easy to make!  I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because my kids wouldn't touch it, which is no big surprise and doesn't really mean anything.  I'll definitely make it again anyway.  Someone suggested chicken; that should be good.

This was easy and very tasty! My teenager who NEVER eats leftovers ate the remainder the very next day for lunch.  Definitely an A+.  Next time though I'll use the package of burrito wraps that have 8 per package.

Aside from possibly adding more heat, to taste (and not necessarily taco seasoning, because of the sodium content)we enjoyed this recipe.  Maybe, I am really missing something really important, but I can't imagine what a previous reviewer meant when she said that it was not a "complete" recipe.  I thought the list of ingredients and the directions were pretty conscise and straight-forward!

I'm only giving this 4 stars b/c its not a complete recipe; however, its a start. I made these with some changes and they were incredible... def restaurant quality. Changes included: adding taco seasoning (use the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site -- better than buying the packets) to the meat while cooking and combining one can of red spicy enchilada sauce and one can of green mild enchilada sauce rather than using the dry mix. I also used less cheese (on top) and more olives, plus be sure to crumble the beef as much as possible. Serve with a basic salad, refried beans, and sour cream. This is an excellent combination.

These were so easy and good! I added some sauce to the beef mixture so it wouldn't be dry and jalapeno for a little kick. I also added canned chili beans that had been rinsed and drained. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!  I took other people's advice and added about a third of a packet of taco seasoning in the beef.  I also used canned enchilada sauce to save time.  The only other substituion I made was to use fat free tortillas and fat free cheese to cut down on calories.  My husband raved about them and even ate the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The amount of sauce, meat, and cheese is more appropriate for 8 (8") tortillas, not 10.  Other than that, these were VERY delicious and SUPER easy.  To make the sauce I used a 1.5 oz. package of Schilling dry enchilada sauce mix.  (Subbed a can of Hunt's no-salt added tomato sauce for the regular, and I thought that the sauce was rather low in sodium and quite zippy.)  Added a small amount of coarsely chopped fresh mushrooms and about 3/8 cup of sauce to the meat mixture before filling the tortillas.  Used "Marble Jack" by Crystal Farms (a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses) instead of cheddar.  These turned out REALLY GOOD, and I will make them very often.  Thank you, Becky.

It's going to be a keeper in my dorm.  I left out the black olives, but added 8 oz. of sour cream, a half can of enchilada sauce, and liberal amounts of chili powder and garlic powder (I forgot taco seasoning) to the beef and sauteed onions before wrapping it up.  Used 2 cans of enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas before baking them.  Also, I used 5-in. torillas instead of 10-in.; I think the whole thing baked better that way.  Oh, and I used about 6 cups, not just 2, of cheese.

Very good recipe.  I mixed some extra enchilada sauce in with the meat and it turned out great.

YUMMM!!!! This was so quick and easy and very tasty. I went ahead and added some chili powder and garlic powder to the meat and onions while cooking (forgot to buy taco seasoning mix, and I knew I would want some more seasoning). Also used canned enchalada sauce bec that is all my store had, and used extra cheese. Also I used corn tortillas instead of flour. Served with refried beans and mexican rice. Definately a keeper and will be making again.

This was real good!  Even my two year old liked it.  Usually it would be too spicy for him but this was perfect. Oh and very very easy to make.

Tasted fine... but not much different than the recipe on my enchilada sauce packet!  I think it needs more experimentation...

Oh my god these were awesome!! And rediculously easy. GREAT idea using flour tortillas! I added taco seasoning to the meat which really helped but next time I will only use half of the packet. I also left off the olives and used LOTS of onion and garlic. Oh and I used a lot more cheese. YUM!

This was fast and delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the beef and onion with a package of taco seasoning. I also used canned enchilada sauce, as that is what my store had. Served with sour cream on the side and whole family gave it an A!

I really enjoyed these enchiladas. Next time however I might try a home made enchilada sauce or some other variation as I found the dry sauce mix I used a bit salty. I added some sour cream to the top of the enchiladas in the last 2 minutes and found to be a nice addition.

Tasty !  I did alter the recipe by using taco seasoning on the meat.  I didn't use the olives because my family doesn't care for them.  My 8 year old daughter wolfed these down.  My husband said he would give it 3 stars, but I'm giving 5.  It was easy to make, easy to alter, fast & GOOD.  Thank you so much for this recipe

Very good! I would only make a couple changes. I only had 8 tortillas and that was enough for the one pound of ground beef. I would probably put more ground beef in them. I also put some of the sauce on the beef before I rolled them up. These were very good, though.

Since we like things a little spicy, I added 1/2 a packet of burrito seasoning to the beef and onion mixture while cooking, as well as Konriko's Jalapeno seasoning.(Konriko is a Louisiana-based rice company.) Other than that, I followed the recipe, and it came out awesome!  We are a family of three- two adults and a 2-year old, and there was only 1 enchilada left!!  I would use more enchilada sauce next time- there wasn't enough for our tastes.  I was looking for a quick, easy recipe that I could use again, and I found it! Thanks!

I liked this recipe.  My sauce came out a little on the sweet side, but a lot of them are I guess.  I added a half can of diced tom. and green chilis to the hamburger mixture.  Pretty good and easy to prepare.

These were pretty bland -- we like our mexican food spicier.  After baking, I topped them with chopped tomato and lettuce (the first from our garden), sour cream and spicy salsa.  This made them better, but I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe.

This is a much easier way of making enchilladas and tastes just as good. With this recipe, you don't burn your fingers on the corn tortilla after dipping it in hot oil.

Delicious!!  I have never made enchiladas before so we really enjoyed these. I took advice from other reviews and made 2 packs of enchilada sauce and I added some taco seasoning to the meat for flavor, but I actually could have just added some enchilada sauce. I also put enchilada sauce on the tortillas before adding meat or cheese.(ok it sounds like tons of sauce, but It kept them from being dry and they came out wonderful) This really is one dish I will make for years to come. My husband was very impressed.

These are quick and easy, and my family always enjoys them. I used canned enchilada sauce, instead of the powdered, that the recipe calls for.

I made this tonight because all I had was hamburger cheese and tortillas.  I made the red enchilada sauce from this site to use with it. After I rolled I dumped the remaining cheese on top and ladeled on enchilada sauce over each of them.  These were fast and easy and really, really, good.  I wish I would of made more.  Thank you.  I can't wait to try with Corn tortillas.

This is really yummy!  I added my own spices to the beef along with a can of rotel tomatoes.  Also placed shredded cheese inside the enchiladas in addition to the top.  Will definately make again! :)

This was a big hit in my family. It was easy to make and delicious. Will definitely make it again. Added cheese topping 10 min. into baking.

These were wonderful!  I used canned enchilada sauce because I had one sitting in my cabinet.  I also added some spices to the meat mixture (cumin, garlic salt, pepper, and taco seasoning)  I only used one can of enchilada sauce, but could see where you might want to use two.  These were quick, easy, and a nice change of pace from chicken enchiladas.  Raves!!

These probably would've been good if I didn't screw it all up with my beginner non-cooking skills! I rolled mine way too big and ended up using three pans! LOL! I used canned enchilada sauce and you may need two cans. The beef was also a bit plain and I even added green peppers, onions and garlic powder. Next time I will definitely use a taco packet like others suggested.

Easy recipe, sounds too simple to be this good but it is.  I used ground turkey and mixed diced jalapenos into the meat mixture.  Delicious!

I was unable to find Enchilada sauce mix here in canada, so I made mine from scratch. Also using different flavours of tortilla shells, gives it a different appeal. Very good though!!..
