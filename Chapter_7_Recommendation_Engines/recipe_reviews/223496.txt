This is my favorite summer dessert recipe.  I use a graham crust and raspberries for the filling.  Sometimes add a little raspberry jello powder to the cornstarch mix.

We really enjoyed this.  A great way to use the bounty of summer fruit and berries.  Fresh peaches would be a great addition.  I used the short bread crust recipe from this site and used a tart pan with a removable bottom instead of a pie pan.  Very nice presentation.  Thanks!

This recipe was very easy to make and delicious.  I made it for an outdoor concert /potluck in mini graham cracker crusts.  Guests topped the pies with whipped cream on the side.  Delicious!

My whole family loved this!  I did make a chocolate shortbread crust, and I cooked the berry syrup in the microwave but it was exactly like you wrote it other than that.  It is delicious with the chocolate crust.  Itâ€™s delicious just to eat the fruit by itself.  I thank you so much for this.

This is so delicious with a graham cracker crust blueberries & raspberries were so expensive at the store I decided to use frozen wild Maine blueberries from Kroger and raspberries and added a container of fresh strawberries. It's a little runny with the frozen fruit but it was so good who cares making it again for a second time tonight
