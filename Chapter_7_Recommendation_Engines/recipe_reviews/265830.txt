Made as written and we enjoyed these. One note I will say is that the peppers and onion need to go in at first (if not sauteed beforehand) if you want them soft. As written they are both still very crunchy. I like them that way but I know a lot of people don't so I thought I'd mention it.

I made it for 2 and used separate bowls to mix the eggs salsa and milk.  Next time Iâ€™ll add Moreno cheese, other than that, it was wonderful and easy!
