The ease of preparation and elegant simplicity make this dessert spectacular.  That little bit of sugar and cream bakes into a lovely light caramel sauce which is just delectable when spooned over the baked pears.   This is divine, and I would definitely serve this as a finish to an elegant dinner (heck, any dinner, even beans and franks!). ***UPDATE 11.5.18***  This recipe ceases to amaze me.  How can anything taste this good with so little effort?  Pears are inexpensive right now, so today I knew it was time to make this again.  We enjoy these pears warm or chilled,

Do not cover after adding the cream or you will have a curdled pudding. And if you are using a different type of pear, add at least another 1/2 hour to baking depending on ripeness. Stay the course until the pears are tender...they release their full sugar potential. Truly amazing and simple recipe.

Simply divine! I used plain old green pears, peeled off the skin and followed the instructions. It took much longer in the oven, probably because of the type of pear. Covered for half an hour and then uncovered and baked another 15 minutes. It looks so elegant too!

FANTASTICALLY SIMPLE and unbelievably delicious. We had a dinner guest at short notice, so this became my quick desert. The previous reviewers were right on target. Delicious! I used the d'Anjou pears sitting on our counter (left the peel on) and the half and half in the fridge. I'm sure it would be even more decadent with cream, but beggars can't be choosers! I was so excited with the outcome: silky caramel sauce, tender and sweet pears, mmmmmmmm. Our guest was thrilled with this simply elegant dessert for his birthday away from home. I will share this with SO many people and make it many times again. Thanks Kaboom!

Delicious. Mine didn't turn out looking like they had caramel sauce on them like the photo, but they tasted great. I doubled the recipe for the number of people I was serving and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a lightly spiced flavor.

After reading all of the reviews and seeing how simple this was to make - I had to try it - it was amazing!  agreed for any other pear you must bake a little longer I also added a teaspoon of good vanilla to the cream when I put it in. I told my boyfriend we were going to have this for dessert - after serving him a pear, he told me he had not thought the dessert would be that good - but he was pleasantly surprised and asked for a second one - to that one we added some roasted salted pecans for salty caramel and texture - a great addition!

This is wonderful!  It took all of 3 minutes to wash and core my pears.  I used red pears and left the skin on, rubbing it with butter made it very tender. I can't remember ever making such a simple dessert that presented so well and tasted as good.  I will use a larger pan next time so get here is more contact with the cream, the caramel custard will get browner.  Thanks, kaboom!

This was a delicious dessert.  Although it was covered in heavy cream, it still felt very light.  I followed the recipe except I didn't quite use 1 tbsp of butter on the bottom of the pan, I just made sure it was coated very well.  I ended up baking mine for an additional 10 minutes to get them tender.

I made this only once. I modified it. I sliced pears that were quite ripe so I had to cut around the brown spots. I filled the buttered pie pan with the pairs. I then drizzled them with melted butter, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, a shot of bourbon and walnuts. I baked this for 10 minutes at 375. I then smothered the pears with a cup of cream. I baked for an additional 20 minutes. I let cool to room temperature. It was delicious. Next time I will cut the cream in half. Will make this again and maybe add raisins.

Very good, altho my cream didn't carmelize much. Maybe I should have baked longer? My pears were tender in the time specified. Used Bosc pears and half and half. Also added a half teaspoon of vanilla to the cream. Baked two pears in a 7 x 11 dish. I will make this again. We almost always have fruit after dinner, and altho this dish has more calories than plain fruit, was a nice treat.

Let me start by saying I do not like pears, but when reading this recipe I felt compelled to try it. Am I glad I did!  Didn't change a thing other than to sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top along with the sugar, but just a personal taste preference. Once they came out of the oven, I took one to my hubby and walked back to the kitchen to get mine. All I heard in the other room was "Wow!"  Once I took a bite I knew what he meant!  2 weeks later I made these for dinner guests and they loved them as well.  Great dessert that is light and elegant.

I loved the simplicity of this.  I used Red Anjou, they were a little more then ripe, so they were extra tender.  To make it again I will probably use a touch of salt to bring out the flavor, and maybe vanilla extract like someone else did. Otherwise mine was pretty bland

All I can say is Delicious!!!  This was wonderful, I made it last night and everyone went nuts over it.  I am making it again tonight for dessert.  I have a ton of pears to use up so I will probably make it several times this week.

Fall perfection! I used Swerve brand brown sugar substitute to cut the carbs a bit and added fall spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice to the bottom of the pan with the butter and Swerve. Honestly, one of the best things I've ever made. This will definitely be making an appearance as a Thanksgiving dessert!

This recipe is not only simple but truly delicious!
I added a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the cream and turned the pears up after 10 min. Basting them several times during the final 20 min baking. Pictures look like others have done the same. I plan to try this recipe with sliced apples and add a sprinkling of cinnamon on top before adding cream.

Last minute dinner for friends. Had pears on hand, found this recipe, followed without measuring, in a rush!  Baked until all were ready for dessert.  Didn’t time.  Results, perefect!  One more raw pear, will make again for tomorrow dessert for two.  Oh, one change..half n half was less than half price for whipped cream so saved money, no regrets!

This was very good but the picture that accompanies the recipe is not a reflection of the actual recipe.  The finished dish, as per the instructions, is very blah looking.  I would strongly recommend cooking the pears cut side up, as per the picture, so that the butter, brown sugar and cream can caramelize in the pear half.

This was very good. My pears were still a little green and hard. I halved and cored them, placed cut side down in a dish with small amount of water and microwaved them until they were soft. Then followed the directions as written. Baked for 10 minutes, added cream and then baked until the sauce was thick. will certainly make again

Easy recipe with phenomenal, gourmet results and taste. I had d'anjou pears on hand and I followed the recipe and followed other reviewers' suggestions to add vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I melted the butter to help spread around the pan and cover the pears. Served with french vanilla ice cream, topped with creamy sauce from this recipe.

Flavor was great, but I was hoping the sauce would caramelize more.  Guess I'll look for another recipe that produces a thicker sauce.

This was absolutely delicious and so simple to make.  It would also be very good with just a dab of vanilla ice cream on top but the recipe is excellent just as written.
