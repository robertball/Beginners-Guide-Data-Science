Ohhhhhh my goodness this is good! I made up a batch tonight so I'd have some to take for lunch this week. I had to force myself not to eat it tonight! And the crazy part is, it's SO amazingly easy with only a few ingredients. Very impressive flavor. I haven't made a recipe this good with so few ingredients in quite a while. The only thing I might suggest is using less chicken bouillon because I found it slightly salty.  I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I used the equivalent of 7 cubes in Better Than Bouillon chicken base (7 teaspoons), which may be the culprit, although from what I've heard, the cubes are more salty anyway. Next time I will try 5. And there will definitely be a next time. Oh, and one more thing....this makes a lot of soup, like 4 gigantic servings or 6 "normal" size servings. Thanks for the amazing recipe Jilly Bean!

I have changed this recipe only in amounts used.  It works very well with squash the size of baseball bats [which I used to grate and freeze or give to the chickens] but you do have to adjust the amounts.  I have already frozen enough to get us through the winter for easy dinner go-withs.  Thank you, thank you for this recipe.  GranB

Do not be fooled by the few ingredients and simplicity of the preparation:  This recipe is far greater than the sum of its parts.  It flew well under the radar of the avowed zucchini loathers in my house, who had multiple servings.  Outstanding!

So simple, so GOOD.  Didn't change anything and didn't use any garnish.  My husband and I ate it hot; I shared some with a friend who said it was delicious cold!  Will definitely make this over and over.

I wish there was a better measurement for the size of the zucchini.  In my garden I have small to large.  Cup measurement would of been helpful.. I did add 1/2 of a sweet onion and a sprig of lemon thyme from the herb garden.  Will make it again and freeze for the winter

Wow this is a great recipe! It was all the rave at a baby shower I took it to. Many ladies wanted the recipe. I did  use only use5 bullion cubes & added crab to one pot I took, and one just plain.  Everyone loved it. Had some left over and my family loves it too.

Excellent! I did change it just to lighten it up a little, I used 4 oz. reduced fat cream cheese and added a little cayenne pepper.  Great recipe!
