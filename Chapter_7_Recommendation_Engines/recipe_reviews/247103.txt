This was so delicious. I love the combo of coconut milk and tamarind. Absolutely amazing. I subbed a couple things based on what I had spice wise, but it really needs nothing. Will definitely make again.

My husband really enjoyed this "Brinjal (Eggplant) in Coconut Milk," which makes it a winner in my book.  The next time I make it I will use smaller Indian eggplants for a firmer texture. I reduced the chile powder to 1 teaspoon because that is about as much heat as I can handle. Thank you Aysha Shifna for sharing your recipe.
