The best congee that I've made ever. I managed to find the char siu at my favorite asian market. They have it delivered once a week and saved some for me. The owner said it goes out fast and he kindly saved a package for me. I made the recipe just as it is given and will make this often. The preserved duck eggs make it even better. This is a recipe for those who are familiar with asian ingredients and enjoy them. For those new to the duck eggs a small cup served with other favorite asian dishes would be a nice way to introduce them to this delicious congee. Thank you for this recipe.

Delicious! But the oil is unecessary. Still a very good recipe and will definitely make again!
