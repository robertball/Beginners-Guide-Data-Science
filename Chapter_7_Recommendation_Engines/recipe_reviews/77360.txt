This makes the best gluten-free muffin I have tasted--light, crunchy, sweet.  I made the following changes to make it gluten-free:  I used 1 cup of millet flour, then 1/2 cup each of the following: rice flour, white bean or fava bean flour, and amaranth or quinoa flour.  Feel free to make other substitutions for these flours if you have other favorites.  I also used soy milk instead of buttermilk, adding 1 Tbsp. of vinegar to the soy milk and letting it sit for five minutes.  Great recipe--everyone loves it!  The honey makes it irresistable to my sweet tooth.

Yum!  I AM guilty of changes - half applesauce for the oil, ground oatmeal and seven grains for the millet and part of the flour, and I also added walnuts, raisins, and cranberries.  But - excellent whole-grain taste and very moist, tender, and just a little bit of chew; a great base.  I'll definitely make again!  Thanks :)

i am the baker for a whole foods co-op in northern minnesota and i have to make muffins every morning. just on a whim, i tried these this morning and i was so pleased!  they are delicious and i am certain they will fly off the shelves.  i make muffins in the big tins, so for this recipe i doubled it and ended up with 8 muffins.  i also added more millet...a good choice.  i am now enjoying one of the extras with a cup of coffee.

I really love this recipe.  I add extra millet for the crunch.  It works perfectly as is, and also doubles very well.  My kids eat these faster than I can make them, and it's so healthy for them, I don't mind at all!  No white sugar and white flour, plus the extra nutrition of the millet make these great, but the really great thing is that they are very delicious!

Yummy.  I made 4 dozen mini-muffins, baked for 10 minutes.  I manufactured "buttermilk" by adding a T of lemon juice to a cup of milk.  I subbed 1/4 c non-fat vanilla yogurt for half the oil. Thanks for the recipe, Himeesgirl!

I'm a novice when it comes to millet, and when people talked about the 'crunch' in the muffin, I almost got scared off.  That didn't sound good.  But it is!  It's delicious!  I didn't have quite all the ingredients so, following other reviewer's suggestions, I left out the egg and I mashed up an overripe pear to replace most of the oil.  It was moist and tender, but still held together nicely.  Because of the whole wheat flour, I was very surprised how much this muffin rose, and how light it was.  It's not a sweet muffin, but it's great with honey butter, very nutritious, and the way I made it, completely guilt free.  This is totally a keeper.
EDIT: Having made these about a dozen times, I thought I'd mention a good variation we found - mashed pear as listed above, with 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of grated nutmeg.  Just gives it a little depth, and makes the house smell good.

One question - is it millet flour or millet seeds that are used?   Just confused by the ingredient list and the instructions.  The picture looks like seeds, and some members mention crunch, but the instructions and others mention millet flour. Thanks

These were so good!  I may never make cornbread muffins with a meal again - I'll make these!  The millet was such a yummy crunchy addition.  I subbed some wheat bran and flaxseed meal for about 1/3 of the flour, just to up the nutrition even more; mine only took 13 minutes in my oven.  Tasty and easy!

WOW! I loved this recipe! Very healthy due to the 100% whole wheat and the millet, but still light and fluffy enough to entice my taste-centric family. I had already eaten breakfast this morning, but after sampling one I suddenky found myself polishing off another! They were but 15 seconds out of the oven, and elevated me to a state of Nirvana. The millet adds a pleasant crunch, and though I was afraid that the flavor would be bland and lacking, it was absolutely perfect.
I might experiment around with substituting applesauce for the oil, to reduce fat, but if it changes the texture and flavor too badly, I think that I can cope with the slight guilt of indulging in such a yummy treat. Thank you for sharing!

I ground my own wheat for these.  They turned out wonderfully well - not dense like many whole wheat recipes.  I also added chocolate chips to a few as an experiment.  It wasn't so great.  But what was great was adding a teaspoon of apricot or blackberry jam to the middle of the muffins before baking.  They were yummy!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  It's healthy and delicious and is very versatile.

I am in LOVE with this recipe!  I cannot review it based on its original ingredients, however, because I veganized it.  The veganized version is stellar and is going to be one of my new favorite recipes!  To veganize this recipe, use 1 cup non-dairy milk mixed with 1 tablespoon vinegar (I used almond milk with apple cider vinegar; it curdled very nicely).  Replace the honey with the same amount of agave nectar.  I also removed the egg and did not replace it with anything (which makes my version of this recipe even easier, eh?).  As for the oil, I did what others suggested and replaced 1/2 of the oil with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  Thanks, HIMEESGIRL, for a great base recipe.  You should try 'em vegan, too; I think you'll be impressed!  Enjoy!

Delicious and pretty darn healthy!  I made a boatload of changes, in good allrecipes style.  :)  Used half honey and half agave, added a couple handfuls of toasted walnuts, added nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and ginger, as well as raisins, dried cherries and dried cranberries.  I was confused about whether to use whole millet or millet flour (the recipe refers to both), so I ground up 1/3 cup millet in my coffee grinder, then also threw in a handful of whole millet as well as a 1/3 cup oatmeal (decreased the whole wheat by 1/3).  Also tossed in 2 tsp. ground flax as well as the same amount of chia seeds (they're even better for you than flax, have a longer shelf life, don't need grinding/opening of the seed like flax does, and they don't require refrigeration!).  My muffins were a little darkish on the bottom so I'd recommend decreasing the bake time by a few minutes.

Absolutely the most fantastic muffins!  I have used both sour milk and buttermilk and prefer the sour milk method.  Every time I make these for dinner guests I get rave reviews and a request for the recipe!  We don't even bother making corn bread anymore.  These are too wonderful!  The bonus is they are yummy as breakfast muffins too!  Thank you!

Great muffins!  My picky eater of a husband complained only that that the millet made them too crunchy (he doesn't like it when I use medium milled corn meal for corn bread either).  I plan to soak the millet for a few hours when I make these again.  Thank you for a great and healthy recipe.

The ingrediant list calls for millet, I assumed whole.  As I started making it, the directions clarify millet flour.  I didn't feel like pulling out my grinder, so I just added whole millet instead.  We really liked it.  It added a little crunch and whole grain millet is more fiber.  It was like eating corn stirred into cornbread batter.  My kids loved it.

I made this recipe as written the first time, and the muffins were a big hit.  The second time, I added some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, and my husband literally danced across the kitchen floor.  This is definitely a keeper!  One note:  I thought it was better to make 12 muffins instead of 16.

We really like these muffins. In an attempt to make them even healthier I replaced 1/4c of wheat flour with millet flour, buttermilk with unsweetened coconut milk and vinegar, honey with 1/2c applesauce and 3 packets of stevia. Yum!

my muffins burned! I subbed cornstarch and soymilk/vinegar for the egg and buttermilk to make it vegan, but that may have made the issue with temp. I set the timer for 10 min, and they were all black on the bottom. The tops and middle were delicious and moist, so I think I will try paper cups next time and 375 temp. I won't be stepping away from the oven either.

I was impressed with how light and moist these muffins were for having so much whole wheat flour in them. I felt so healthy while eating a muffin! The millet really does add a nice crunch. Great breakfast muffin, or even a helpful and healthy midday snack.

A very good healthy versatile muffin all around. These are very tasty and very easily adapted to whatever mood you might be in. I think it should be mentioned that if you are accustomed to a fair amount of sugar in your diet then these would not be qualified as sweet at all. I don't eat that much sugar and they were as mentioned very lightly sweet to me...to my husband...he said he couldn't taste sweetness at all. I very much enjoyed the different use of millet with this recipe, I'm always looking for ways to sneak in whole grains. I will def. be making these again thanks for a great base recipe!

Very tasty and healthy.  I accidentally forgot to add the oil and, if eaten fresh, you won't miss it.  Makes a bit sturdier muffin, but works great for those who love a heartier, less cake-like texture.  I used low fat buttermilk and add raisins, and the result was a low cal, low fat, tasty muffin - 160 calories and 1 g. of fat for 12 muffins.

Awesome muffins!! I love the crunch of the millet. These are definitally a keeper! They are hard to stop eating!! Thanks for this recipe. I tried to make it healthier so I exchanged the oil for fruit. Didn't have any applesauce, so I mashed a ripe pear. It was yummy! Also, used 1 cup oat flour and 1 1/4 c. whole wheat flour.

Utterly tasteless. Unusually bland even for healthy muffins.  I had to make subs, but no different than anyone else.  I subbed barley malt syrup for honey, almond milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk and yogurt for the oil.  I can't imagine how to salvage them unless I bury them in peanut butter.

These muffins were delicious! Light and fluffy, not dense the way whole wheat muffins often are, with the perfect amount of sweetness. I ate one with dinner dipping it in soup (had no bread on hand), then later spread some jam in the middle and ate another as dessert! I second guessed the recipe and added a few more shakes of flour b/c I thought it looked too liquidy, but it actually would have been fine--I actually wish mine were a tad more moist. Instead of buttermilk, I used 1 c. soy milk + 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar (you let it sit and curdle for a few mins). Egg replacer works great as well, so these are easily made vegan. I also used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. of oil to make it healthier. Next time I'm gonna up the millet content, but these were awesome--thanks for the great recipe!

Made recipe as listed. I really liked these muffins. The added crunch from the millet was nice. Whole family loved them.
I got 12 muffins that were a little over the top of muffin pan.

I'm genuinely confused by this recipe.  The photos all look like they used whole millet instead of millet flour.  Many people speak of the crunchiness of the recipe, which again makes me assume they used whole millet instead of the ground flour that the instructions call for.  They turned out okay with the millet being ground into flour, kind'a like a cross between cornbread and honey biscuits baked into a muffin.  I will try this again and leave the millet whole to see if I like it better.  They weren't amazing, but I wouldn't be against making them again.

Great as a wheat free muffin too!  I replaced the wheat flour for rice, oat, and garbonzo flour and coconut oil for vegetable oil and added 1/4 tsp of xanthan too - - REALLY TASTY!!!

Great recipe - lightly sweetened as promised - which is something that I like for a morning muffin.  Used olive oil and the flavor came through along with the honey.  The muffins were really fluffy, almost pancake like - but this maybe because I used a mixed white and bran flour - I imagine that a wheat flour would give it a more "muffin" texture.  Really moist and light.  If you're looking for a dense (cake-like) muffin - you may want to skip this one.

These muffins are great!  I made them non-dairy by substituting soured soy milk (juice of one lime plus soy milk to measure one cup) for the buttermilk.  My only complaint is that the bottoms ended up a little oily.  I think I will substitute applesauce for half the oil next time.  I will also make a double batch!

Very good muffin.  I used white wheat that I ground at home.  I think that helps make a lighter muffin.  The millet adds nice variety.    I made 12 instead of 16 muffins.  You can fill the cups pretty full and not worry about them cooking over, then you don't have to cook 2 separate batches.

These definitely had a different taste, but they were good.  The slight crunch from the millet was nice.  Only problem we had is that the flavor changed significantly overnight, so the leftovers weren't very appetizing.  Definitely one to serve immediately.

Very yummy!  I was surprised how light these were with the whole grain.  I made the following substitutions: generous with the millet, substituted half the whole wheat flour with millet flour, used powdered buttermilk, substituted half the oil with applesauce, and for extra flavor added a splash of vanilla and mini chocolate chips.

I LOVE these muffins! I‘ve made them dozens of times as written as well as with substitutions, and they always turn out fantastic! For older babies still under the age of one I substitute agave nectar for the honey, and I generally use plain yogurt rather than buttermilk simply because I always have it on hand, whereas I almost never habe buttermilk.

These were really good!  I noticed that the ingredients list said "millet" but the directions said "millet flour."  I chose not to grind my millet, because I soaked my batter for about 8 hours to break down phytates and figured the millet would be soft enough to eat that way.  It still added a nice crunch, somewhat reminiscent of a cornbread muffin.  In fact these tasted a lot like corn muffins to me.  But since I love corn muffins, it didn't bother me a bit!  Will definitely make again - a good way to use millet!  My only change was using coconut oil instead of canola.

Great muffins.  I want to try the millet, but didn't have any so replaced with golden flaxmeal, oatbran and soy flour.  Used half honey half brown sugar.  Also dusted the top with brown sugar. (I have a bit of a sweet tooth :) ) Delicious!!

This recipe is a keeper. We cut the oil in half and added 1/4 of applesauce and found the batter was fine for 12 muffins and was moist. The taste was like sweet wheat bread, with the benefit of a little crunchiness from the millet. The kids gobbled them up with dinner, but they'd be equally good for a snack or breakfast with a little jam. Thanks for this great recipe!

LOVE THESE!! I did make a few substitutions, but the end result was fantastic. I used raw kefir in place of buttermilk, brown rice flour instead of whole wheat, 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup coconut oil in place of oil. DE-LICIOUS! They taste like buttered corn bread.

I made these gluten free for my family by substituting Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Flour for the whole wheat flour (don't forget to add guar gum if substituting gluten free). My son was recently diagnosed with celiac and is very picky loved these. They are light and fluffy and muffin-like. I added an apple, ground cinnamon and vanilla extract. I will be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

These have been made twice in as many days, here.  They're delicious as written, but the second time around I added a cup of raisins I had soaked for 30 minutes in hot water to these muffins, as well as about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  The raisins made these even better.  Thanks for this great recipe!

These are great!! Super healthy too!! I will need to decrease my baking time a bit - the bottoms just got burnt - but that is probably my oven's fault ;)

These were really good...the baking soda flavor was detectable but not a huge distraction. I used half applesauce, half butter for the oil and added nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. I like how theyre not too sweet. impossible to eat just one!

These were very good for a completely healthy muffin...be careful not to overcook because they don't taste good when you do.  I'm not sure how much I like the crunch of the millet, but I love how good they are for me and my family.

These are so good!  I did make a few adjustments based on what I had on hand and my quest for a super-fiberous muffin.  I used 1/2 applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil (I used canola to save on saturated fat).  In place of the buttermilk (since I didn't have any on hand) I used almond milk with a few squirts of lime juice.  I added 1 cup of cranberries and doubled the millet. In place of 1/3 of the whole wheat flour, I used flax meal and wheat bran.  I also used agave nectar (b/c I didn't have honey on hand). They turned out very moist and delicious.  Everyone loved them at work and I had to hide them from my husband!  Now that's a good muffin!  I will DEFINITELY make these again!  Weekly!!

Great Recipe! I made these Gluten Free by substituting Bob's Red Mill GF mix and they were so light and fluffy. The millet was a nice crunchy surprise. A very different but pleasant muffin. Also, I had to sub yogurt for buttermilk since it was all I had on hand and it was great! Delicious with a little jam!

I made these muffins today and added some dried fruits and walnuts.  I also used applesauce fr the oil.  These muffins are really yummy and the millet gives a great crunch.

These muffins are very tasty. I made them once at the servings provided. I ate them so fast, the next time I made them, I tripled the batch and froze the extras. They're my favorite muffin to make so far!

These were only good when you consider how good they are for you.  And while I suppose anyone looking at a sugarfree millet muffin recipe really values nutritional density in their food, I think that at least one review here should acknowledge that.  They're great for you and taste ok too...  I also tried making them with only 1/4 c oil, 1 apple grated, some cinnamon, nutmeg and dried cranberries, and they were better.

I signed up as a member just so I could review this recipe! I don't generally like muffins as I find them too sweet/oily. I was impressed by the ingredients in these and thought I would try them out for breakfast. Not only are they healthy - they are SOO tasty! Even my husband, who has a big sweet tooth, was raving about them. I followed the recipe exactly, using coconut oil (for added health benefits). They had just the right about of sweetness and were light and fluffy, with the millet adding just the right about of crunch. We will definitely make these again! Thanks!

This was wonderful, and tasted just as good when I replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, decreasing the fat and calories a lot (even though they're already pretty light!).  I also did a little more than 1/2 cup of millet.  Great recipe!

I made the muffins as is, but added chocolate chips and made my own buttermilk with lemon juice.  The muffin is somewhat bland.  I would make them again, but would add cinnamon and maybe nutmeg.  Thanks!

Sort of boring.  They would be good for a quick breakfast with a pat of peanut butter or raspberry preserves, but sort of plain on their own.

I wanted to like these more than I did.  They were very rich I thought and you could certainly taste  all the honey.  It was either the salt, baking powder or baking soda that stood out to me.

Soooo good! My picky young children and husband love these! These are definitely going in my son's school lunch. They have just the right amount of crunch (that don't hurt your teeth like those tiny sprinkles) and the sweetness was fabulous. I'm not a fan of straight honey and I couldn't tell there was honey in these- just sweetness.

It will be easy to manipulate to make even healthier: applesauce instead of oil, sprouted wheat flour instead of regular wheat flour, etc. Enjoy!!
Thank you for such a healthy recipe!

Updated 5/2/16: I have changed this recipe (after making it as written the first time) to make it even healthier. I use sprouted whole wheat flour in place of the regular whole wheat, applesauce in place of the oil, am using only 1/2 honey and adding 1/4 cup sucanat, and have increased the millet to 1/2 cup. The flavor is not even affected. Amazing recipe!

Finding that I didn't have buttermilk (or milk to make the buttermilk, I used almond milk. I also had to use coconut oil mixed with a bit of grape seed oil for the 1/2c vegetable oil. Because I was trying to use all of the millet, I used  a heating 1/3 cup.

I used millet flour instead of whole millet and I think next time I'll try these with the whole millet instead.  The texture was sort of dry and crumbly so I think it was too much flour.  I also added in some raisins and pecans and  for me they would have been a little too bland without them.  I cut the honey in half because of adding the raisins and that worked out great - they were not very sweet which is what I prefer.  I think this is a really great base recipe for a healthy muffin.  I'll definitely make them again and will play around with additions (blueberries, coconut, walnuts, cinnamon, dried cherries.....).

Wonderful recipe.  I was very impressed by the lightly sweet taste of the muffin.  I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  I also added dried cranberries and apricots (about a 2/3 cup total)and it was delicious with the muffin base.  My husband was very suspicious of the millet at first, but loved the muffins as well.  I will certainly make these again.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the review to substitute yogurt for half of the oil and I used coconut oil for the other half.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added a dash of lime juice to 1/2 c. milk. For the other 1/2 c. liquid I used Naked berry juice just to give a little more sweetness.  I also used a full cup of dry millet because I really like the crunch!  The texture turned out great.  They are not overly sweet (I did use the 1/2 c. honey), but I like them that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great muffins. Made as written except had no honey so used sugar. I also used coconut oil instead just for fun and it was great. Subbed 1/4c flour for 1/4c ground flax seed to add some omega 3s. Different but delicious muffins.

Great recipe! I increased the amount of millet and really love the little crunch! I feel so good about not having sugar in it. Super yummy and just lightly sweet. 15 minutes was too long in my oven and they were slightly overdone. I will be making these for a late mother's day breakfast!

I thought they were a little bland, I added 8 medjool dates. Tasted fruity and sweet. 
My 15 month old loves it!

GREAT recipe!  So easy!  I made this just as instructed and the muffins were good.  I was looking for a little more of a sweet muffin so I adjusted the salt to 1/8 tsp. and added 2 tbsp. of Splenda for baking.  I also used 1 cup of whole wheat baking flour and 1 cup of millet flour and made up the additional 1/4 cup required with flax meal and wheat germ.  In addition I used 1/2 the oil and 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  YUMMY!

I adapted this recipe to make a non-gluten version as another reviewer has done.  I substituted the flour with equal parts white rice flour, tapioca flour, and oat flour.  Instead of buttermilk, I used sour cream and added a few tablespoons of regular milk to thin the mixture a bit.  I also added about a cup of fresh blueberries and did not add millet.
The muffins turned out very light and airy with a bit of a grainy texture (perhaps from the tapioca flour?).  The only thing was that they were a tad dry even though I used sour cream.  I would also add more honey/sweetener next time and fill the cups two thirds instead of halfway.

very nice for afternoon & evening snacks.  i add a little more millet than stated, b/c i love the little crunchies.
the only disappointment was that they're very crumbly & make a mess (which my dog appreciates!)

Made these this morning, these are more of a cornbread type muffin. The millet was crunchy (I added 3/4 cup based on other reviews). I found them rather bland and thought they would be better with jam. I will make them again but will add more flavoring ingredients such as cranberries/walnuts or an extract.  They would however be absolutely excellent with chili just as they are.

This recipe is really easy.  Even my husband--who usually hates whole grains--loves these muffins.  The next day they are best served with butter and jelly.

These were great! When I noticed the recipe had no sugar I was concerned, but my daughter and I loved these.  I made them in mini-muffin tins and they're a wonderful snack for my daughter (& me) - yummy yet healthy!  My boyfriend ate them with chili and said they remind him of cornbread muffins but (I don't like cornbread) I really liked these... I couldn't find a small jug of buttermilk so I found another recipe with buttermilk to use up the rest of the buttermilk with.

These Muffins were very good.  I did do a few things differently.  I did not have whole wheat flour on hand, but I did have whole spelt. So I used that.  I also used regular milk since I didn't have buttermilk on hand.  I bought some buttermilk yesterday and I am eager to try it with buttermilk.  Thanks for the great recipe!
