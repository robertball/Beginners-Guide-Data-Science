I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful. I omitted the crust and just served the squares. Thank you so much!

This was very disappointing.  I tried this for a New Year Party and no one cared for it.  Not something I would make again.

This is a very good adult taste and is a challenging food-stuff.  I wouldn't make it again, though, because it was a bit thick (especially the pastry).

I made this for a party and was asked for the recipe by several people. They loved it. It is a bit rich but perfect in little squares.

I Love this recipe.  It was very elegant for my New Years Eve Party.  Just a tip: I used a Tupperware tumbler to roll the crust into the baking dish.  I think for such simple ingredients the outcome is very sophisticated.

Good, but definitely very rich.  The flavor turned out really good though, because I'm too stingy to buy sun-dried tomatoes so I used fresh tomatoes, chopped red bell pepper (key ingredient), and lots of garlic, as well as other seasonings to my own taste.  Cut into SMALL squares to serve.  Everyone liked them...I was actually surprised how fast they disappeared.

This would be a better spread/dip recipe.  I baked it for a party and the "cheesecake" part completely separated from the crust.  Everyone agreed that it would have been great on a bagel, but was a little sad as a cheesecake.

I made this for my book club meeting with a few modifications and everyone loved it.  First, I used a mixture of bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese with butter and olive oil as a binder for the crust, which I did not pre-bake.  Second, I made it in a traditional spring form pan.  Third, I replaced the oregano with basil as I love basil with tomato and I have a huge basil plant in my back yard.  Next time I will double my basil because it was not a strong flavor in the cheesecake.  Also, my husband suggested whipping the mixture next time to put some air in it, rather than just blending in the food processor.  I served it with multi-grain baguette bread, sliced on a bias and toasted with olive oil.  I do not believe this recipe needs sugar.  Savory cheesecake is an appetizer and should not be sweet.  Cheesecake's origin is actually savory, not sweet.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a new favourite! My family absolutely loved it. The texture was creamy and light and it was very easy to cut and serve. I cut it into squares just a bit smaller than an inch wide, and served each one with a little dollop of sour cream on top and a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley. The sour cream sets it off really nicely.    It was definitely not too bland. I wonder if those who thought it was, might have had plain sun dried tomatoes? It happened that the ones I got were seasoned and had capers, herbs and spices in with them. Either way, it's a good idea to taste as you go and adjust seasonings. I pretty much knew how it was going to taste before I put it in the oven.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I needed something that could be served at room temperature to take to my monthly card club, and I thought this sounded interesting. It came out of the oven an unappealing color and it was all cracked on top.  I had trouble cutting it into squares without it falling apart and the crust was so thin, it might as well not have been there. I didn't care for the taste or the texture. Sorry, this was definitely not for me.

I found this to be a really easy and great tasting recipe.  I didn't have enough eggs so instead of the egg in the crust I used ricotta cheese strangely enough and it turned out great.  I look forward to making it with the egg though next time!!

Very good but too rich to eat as a whole slice. We made it in a springform cheescake pan and served it to be spread on crackers.  Always a hit.

This makes a wonderful and different party appetizer, you can easily make in advance and have them chilled in the fridge ready to go. Friends raved about them and thought the flavors of tomato and onion were great, and no one could identify exactly what went in to the recipe -- but they kept guessing!

SOOOOOOOO.....GOOD! I found this recipe in 2003 before I was a member, and I loved it. Fate was cruel and I lost the printed recipe in a drawer and then the recipe was out of sight and mind. I found it when cleaning in 2010 and the 'palate-memory' was so strong I LITERALLY started to salivate! Yum-E boys and girls. :)

Insanely delicious! I was leary to try this because some of the comments that the dish was too bland.  I followed it exactly. It was absolutely fantastic.  Restaurant quality! I can't wait to serve it at my party tomorrow

The flavor was awesome, but very, very rich. I made a test batch before I decided to make it for an event. It was a small pan (8x8), and even at that, it stayed in my fridge for a week. No one could eat more than a bite or two at a time. I decided to go with something else for the event. 

That being said, these really do taste good, and I think it's a very original idea to make a savory cheesecake type thing. My sister thought it tasted like Rondole.

This was just OK....I agree with other reviewers in that it was very rich.  It was very heavy but didn't seem to have much flavor.  Next time I think I will not use so many tomatoes...they were very overpowering.  I may also try to add some other flavors like onion or parsley to liven it up.  This one needs some work.

I thought the recipe had potential - next time I make it I will use basil instead of oregano, and more of it.  I also felt that it wasn't very "pretty" for entertaining so next time I may add a dab of savory whipped cream with a parsley sprig (or something similar).

Tasty, but I like better warm than room temp, which was disappointing. I need more room temp appetizers. Also added diced red peppers.

I really liked these. I am surprised that other people called them bland, because they are quite the opposite. They have a very deep, rounded flavour. I like the idea of a savoury cheesecake and it hits the spot when you need an indulgent snack. I made them gluten free simply by replacing equal measurements of gluten free all purpose flour (a homemade Cup4Cup knock off). The only issue is the cooking time stated. Mine took 15 minutes for the crust and almost 40 minutes for the cheesecake.

This is a wonderful recipe!  The crust balances the filling/sun dried tomatoes tastes. I cut them in small appetizer size squares - about 40 pieces and plan on serving them at our July 4th party..I know they will be a hit.  

Teri - thanks for submitting the recipe.  It's a keeper!
