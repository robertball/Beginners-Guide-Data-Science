I LOVE deviled eggs and have started making them regularly so it was time to add a kick and this recipe was it. 

Follow Martha Stewart's method for perfect hard-boiled eggs where you cover eggs with cool water by 1 inch in a saucepan and slowly bring water to a boil over medium heat. When the water has reached a boil, cover and remove from heat. Let sit 12 minutes. Transfer eggs to a colander; place under cool running water to stop the cooking. Eggs can be peeled immediately.

Follow this recipe once and then use it as a launching board to make up your own deviled egg combinations.

Big hit at the party!  I added more Frank's hot sauce and more Cajun seasoning to the recipe, otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as directed.  These eggs were gobbled up so fast.  Everyone who tried one, ate at least 1 more along with a recommendation for others to try.  It's the heat that makes them so special; it's so unexpected.  Delicious!

These were a bit hit at our Cindo De Mayo party.  I upped the eggs to 10 and lowered the cream cheese to 2 T, used regular mayo until it was the right consistency and a sprinkle of salt.  I was afraid that the cream cheese would be very noticeable but it wasn't at all. It made for a very creamy flavorful egg.  I will be adding it to my regular recipe from now on.

I substituted blue cheese dressing & dill relish, and added in Thai chili paste instead of hot sauce. Nice Kick. Delicious.

Delicious! I didn't measure the Cajun seasoning, I just sprinkled it on top and it turned out delicious.  Taste even better once cold.

Turned out pretty good, and got eaten pretty quickly at a recent get together.  I did use a little bit more miracle whip as I thought it was originally a little too dry.  I also didn't put as much of the hot sauce in because I wanted my LO to try one.

I put all the ingredients in a blender and it made for a delicious, creamy egg.  They were gobbled up in no time at all!  I will definitely make these often, but will add extra hot sauce and spice as they were only mildly spicey.

I am not fond of cajun food, but this is very good. I like the creaminess of the center. I am sure it will be a hit at Thanksgiving

Mine came out a little dry so I added 2 more tablespoons of Miracle Whip, another tablespoon of sweet relish, and a lot more Crystal hot sauce and Slap Ya Mama seasoning. Garnished with a little more Slap Ya Mama on top. Yummy!

I made this by following the recipe exactly. It was very creamy and I liked that consistency so I would follow this as a basic recipe. There was no bite from any heat. Next time I plan to triple the hot sauce and increase the Cajun. Their seems like a nice place to swap in a multitude of seasonings to pair with grilled meat.

I like a little more heat, so I added chopped peppers to the mixture. Using cream cheese kicked these above the top. Will be making again soon.

I made a triple batch for Fat Tuesday for my hubby to take to his company.  I'm famous for my deviled eggs and at least 4 people said they were the best deviled eggs they had ever had in their life! I did add cajun seanoning to the yolk mixture as well as sprinkling it on top.

These were good but not our favorite.  I think the filling needed some additional zip to it and more flavor.  The cajun flavor just wasn't there, but I did like the addition of cream cheese in it.  I think if upping the cajun seasoning and hot sauce, along with adding in some pimentos or diced red bell pepper, would give it that additional cajun feel that it needed for us.  Thanks for the recipe to try out!
