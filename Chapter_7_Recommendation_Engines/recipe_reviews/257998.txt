My husband enjoyed this and my daughter LOVED it!  We all felt the rice was fine but nothing spectacular- the chicken however really made this dish something special!  This is definitely one I'll be making again.

Very tasty. I found that cooking it at 425 for 15 minutes, then turning down to 350 for another 15- 20 minutes cooked it without drying the chicken out. The onions may have carmelized more with another 15 minutes but I didn’t want the chicken ruined. Could be my oven but I think it cooks true to temperature. Also if you like cilantro fresh makes a big difference!

Outstanding. Beautifully fragrant. I made jasmine rice seasoned only with salt and pepper to not take away any of the flavor of the chicken. I sliced the breasts into large hunks. I opted to add about a tap of olive oil and cooked the chicken in a covered skillet over med low instead of the oven. I also added sliced carrots. The chicken ended up super tender and full of flavor.

I loved this one!  It was delicious straight out of the oven and as leftovers for lunch over the next few days.  Quick and easy to make, a perfect weeknight meal.

I followed the recipe.  Everyone liked it.  I think I should have cooked it for 40 minutes instead of 45.  The chicken was a little dry but still good.   I drizzled a little olive oil on top of mine.  Others liked it the way it was.   Next time I'll try chicken thighs instead.  It's a keeper!

Made this using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. It was delicious! Just the right amount of warm spices, full of flavour. We made saffron-infused brown basmati rice to accompany it, a really nice flavour combination.

This dish is flavorful, without being too spicy. It was easy to make, and I had almost all the ingredients on hand.I did not have dried cilantro, so I substituted fresh, and I used smoked paprika. I am sure I will be making this again!

Very nice. Subtle heat. Simple. "Normal" ingredients most will have on hand. I think if I make it again, I will up the spice a bit (more chili or paprika and maybe a smokey paprika to deepen the flavour)

I love it!  It's going to be a dinner staple for us.  I usually find that recipes don't call for enough garlic but this one hits the mark.  I was a bit worried that it would be to spicy but I find it has just the right level.  I also really enjoyed the rice and will be trying it with other dishes as well.

I used one teaspoon of soy sauce instead of salt.
Husband loved it and said it's a keeper.

Followed the recipie as stated.  Like others, I don’t think it needs 45 mins especially if cooking by convection.  I cooked it for 30 mins and it was perfect.   Saved this one to my favourites.

I also made the Peruvian Green Chile sauce. Warmed and cut a baguette to dip.

I used less chicken. cooked it in a cast iron covered pan in the oven, the flavors were perfect.  The rice was also perfect, used frozen carrots and peas mix.  Picky eaters loved this recipe. Thank you so much.

I cut the chicken part of the recipe in half for just the two of us and there was still some chicken left. I made the full recipe for rice because I knew we'd eat that up as leftovers. The only change I made was I cooked the chicken in a covered casserole to keep the moisture in at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes.

Very good.  The chicken was very good and even seemed better when I had leftovers.  The lemon flavor came put better in the leftovers.  The rice was OK but I am not convinced that basmati rice is needed.  I think brown rice would have been better.

Delicious recipe! I doubled the sauce as my husband is picky about rice so it gives him something to put on it. Nice to have something with rich flavor.

Really good so good I marinated and inserted the mixture into a 15 pound Turkey. I didn’t get a photo of the Turkey but just a wing and the chicken. I cut the chicken smaller so it would cook faster.

Very delicious. Just didn't have Whit wine vinegar, I replaced it with Balsamic vinegar.  No cumin in hand so I just neglect it. Also no chicken broth so replaced it with chicken extract powder dissolved in once cup of boiled water and added Saffron to it. When cooking rices, when the water completely finished, I added butter and peas (which next time I add to its quantity about half cup) and turn down to the lowest heat and let rice to be on heat for about 20 mins (Iranian way of cooking rice). For sure it is part of my every month lunch.  For cooking the chicken I used one of reviewer's offer here, for first 20 min in 425 F (220 C) and for next twenty mins in 350 F (180 C), this  is to avoid the chicken being dried.

This dish was very flavorful. The only changes I made was using fresh cilantro, about 2 chopped tbs, and I also only used 1 chopped onion. It made the chicken dish a little crunchy so maybe I’ll mince the onion next time or sauté them. The rice was perfection!

Family all liked it.  Cooking time/temp for chicken was off for my oven I suppose and it turned out a little tough even with reducing the heat half way through.  Next time I’ll add a little more spicy heat and less cumin, and mix butter in with the rice when adding the peas for more flavor.  I had one onion and a shallot so, I used those and that was nice. Great dish and I will try to make this again.

This was easy to make and the family loved it. I used fresh cilantro in the rice

Very easy and quite tasty. I cut back on the garlic a little just personal preference. I used deboned breasts I found it dried out a bit so next time I would either double the sauce or cook it a a lower temperature. Definitely will make it again
