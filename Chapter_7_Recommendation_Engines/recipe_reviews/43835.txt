I cut the sugar back by half and I used mini chocolate chips. Right after serving, I floated a little milk on the top. The kids thought this was awesome. My oldest asked me next time if we could try this with mashed strawberries.

Nice change from plain 'ol oatmeal. And the additional of chocolate for breakfast - yummy! This not only tastes delicious, but happens to be good for you too! I cut back on the sugar a bit (personal preference). I added a little cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. I topped this with some toasted walnuts - so good I almost didn't think it was breakfast!

Obviously if you add chocolate and brown sugar to something, it's going to be delicious. :)  I'm enjoying a bowl as I type this and it is very good.  I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and even with a pretty green banana it's plenty sweet. I sprinkled some cinnamon on top, and it was great!
It does crack me up that all the reviews for this recipe call for omitting the sugar and the chocolate: "try this, it's amazing!" That's not a recipe, that's just regular oatmeal, people. 
Enjoy!

Both my boys (3 and 1) clean their bowls whenever I serve this.  And my 3 year old is VERY picky.

I cut down the sugar to about 1/4 cup or less.  I also plan to use peanut butter, maybe omit the banana.  but each time I think to do it, I don't want to mess with a good thing!

I love the idea of adding in mashed banana in a porridge. Definitely a different way to serve plain old oatmeal. I love the fact that oatmeal makes a nutritious breakfast and I was looking for a new way to prepare it, rather than eating pre-favored, packaged instant oatmeal which is not that healthy. Finally, I found one. However, I made mine low-fat. I opt out the chocolate chips and used 1 tsp brown sugar for one serving (I scaled down to one serving) only. It is sweet enough for me, as banana has its natural sweetness added to it already. And I used half water, half fat-free milk. It turned out fabulous! All you health conscious people out there, if you want a low-fat, low-cal, delicious oatmeal porridge without compromising the good taste, do it this way!!! I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Thank you so much for the recipe idea.

I really liked this - my three boys however were not crazy about it.  It was pretty sweet - so next time I will decrease the sugar a bit and probably not use as many chocolate chips.  The banana is a great touch.  Mmmmmmmmm Good.

I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips and added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. It was awesome! Next time I will definitely have to try it with the chocolate.

This was really tasty and a nice change from the oatmeal we normally eat. I omitted the brown sugar as my banana was pretty ripe, and it was perfect. Just a touch sweet. Nice way to sneak fruit into my kids.

This was pretty good. I was mindful of the other reviews saying it was overly sweet, so we added the sugar a little at a time until it was sweet enough - probably only a couple of spoonfuls. This was a nice change from the usual porridge, but not something we want too regularly. Thanks, Glitzystar!

Today is Halloween and my husband associates oatmeal with Halloween (for some reason) so I made this oatmeal for brunch.  I left out the banana, but added 1/2 cup milk as it cooked because it was getting too thick.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It turned out really tasty!  I'd always wanted to try chocolate oatmeal and it will be a new Halloween tradition.  To make it seem more Halloweeny, I made sweetened whipped cream, put it in a Ziploc bag, cut about an inch of one of the corners, piped ghosts onto the oatmeal, and stuck in chocolate chips for eyes.  I posted a picture.  If you want to try this, don't put on the ghosts until right before serving because they melt!  For Christmas you could make whipped cream snowmen or marshmallow snowmen :)  Or you could even just scoop the hot oatmeal into bowls, sprinkle with mini marshmallows, and stir them in like hot chocolate oatmeal.

Only 4 stars because I know it would have been too sweet with all that sugar.  I left it out and used a few drops of maple syrup instead.  I stirred in an egg before adding the banana and chocolate chips. It was sooo creamy and good, sort of like having chocolate rice pudding for breakfast.

Way too sweet. I would leave out the brown sugar, and just sprinkle a few chips on top instead of using 1/4 cup.

Way too sweet! I usually make chocolate oatmeal for my daughters w/ just milk and chocolate chips and that is already plenty sweet. So definitely either completely eliminate the brown sugar or just sprinkle to taste.  I did like the addition of the mashed banana, though!

Soooo yummy!!!  This is my chocolate fix, and I absolutely love the flavours that the chocolate and banana give to the oatmeal!  I omit the brown sugar as I find it's sweet enough with the banana and chocolate, but yum, yum, yum :)  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I have to say this is darn near the perfect breakfast.  I have made this almost every other day all winter and spring long. like other reviewers, I have cut the brown sugar down to a large "heaping" spoonful.  I have also added ground flax seed to mine. I always top with fresh fruite like blueberries or strawberries and either a dollop of yogurt or whipped cream. The taste and consistency of this oatmeal is great.  It is a nice hearty breakfast with a nice twise. I have been using 60% Ghirardelli(sp?) chocolate chips for mine.

Like with most things, I made my own modifications to suit my tastes, but this is great as a base.  Let me start out by saying that I hate oatmeal because of the texture and bland taste.  I've had this oatmeal for the past three days!  I kept the oat/water/banana part the same.  I tasted it from there and decided that peanut butter would taste good in there, so I put in 1/2 c creamy peanut butter.  After that addition, I tasted it and practically screamed "Yum!". Lol the bf thought I was crazy, but agreed that it was awesome after tasting it.  He wanted to see how it would be with the chocolate, so I added that in too.  It wasn't as good, but still yummy.  The next morning (I couldn't eat 1/2 of a recipe because of how filling it was), I heated up part of my leftovers and added 1/8 c sliced almonds and half a banana. Sooooo good!!!!  Im also calorie counting, so if you're curious, 1/8 of this recipe with my modifications and toppings is 271 calories or 161 for just the oatmeal with my modifications.  Very satisfying Bfast!  Made me rethink how I felt about oatmeal :)

It tasted ok but I suggest making that 1cup of oats the way you normal do but add the banana, chocolate chips and sugar last and to taste. If I make this again I will make the oatmeal with milk not water (that is what I normally do) to give it more substance and add more salt. 1 tblspoon of brown sugar seemed good enough for me and my little girl and we love sweet things.

Quick and easy to prepare!  I used quick cooking oats and cooked them with water in the microwave for 2.5 mins, then added the mashed banana and brown sugar and cooked for another 2 mins.  Loved the sweetness of the banana and brown sugar.  Just eyeballed the amt of sugar added.  I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top but will probably omit next time...didn't really need them.

I was looking for something different to serve my children for breakfast. We had everything the recipe required, so we tried it. I could barely keep a straight face when I got all of these great comments from each one of them. You can spice it up to you own acquired taste. But it was good.

I actually cheated a bit and just went with the general idea of this recipe rather than the recipe itself. I made one packet of plain oatmeal, added the mashed banana and maybe 1.5 teaspoons of brown sugar, then sprinkled with chocolate chips. I must say, it was quite tasty for breakfast or for a snack. I've already made this several times. Thanks!

Super sweet! I think I will have to try same as some of the previous reviewers and cut back the sugar.

Holy smokes this recipe is so sweet. I doubled the recipe and added less than a 1/4 the amount of sugar. I mean, I can see why people like this recipe...its a good combo of ingredients. But you need to go really easy on the sugar to make this breakfast appropriate or pair it with a cup of black coffee to cut the sweetness. I don't think I'll make this again. Hope this helps.

I have substituted the 1/2 cup of sugar with 3 tablespoons of raw honey and it tasted fabulous! :D

Hi everyone. So grateful for the reviews. I now make this with a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar rather than the original 1/4 cup and swirl in a bit of cream on top before serving.  Oatmeal is a soothing and nutritious food no matter how you enjoy it. Love reading the different versions and tastes, will try with dried fruit next time! :)

I also cut the sugar by half, and it was still plenty sweet. My daughters love this oatmeal and think it's a real treat.

I couldn't finish my bowl. I love(!) chocolate porridge, and banana with nutella, so I was expecting to love this. But this combination was just not to my taste.

I went by the recipe the first time, and it was to sweet. Used less sugar and less chocolate chips and it is great. 3 stars before my change

Just made it this morning.  Actually, it's pretty darn good.  This is the first time I ever finished an entire bowl of oatmeal!  I cut back on the brown sugar and chocolate (I usually don't like my food that sweet.)

First, this oatmeal is sweet, but when you add chocolate and sugar to something that is going to be the end result.  However, I make the good old fashion oatmeal on the stove maybe three times a week and let my six year old son add his own toppings which is usually natural sugar or pure maple syrup and raisins and when he gives me a bit I must say it is much sweeter than the chocolate oatmeal.  We've also tried those prepackaged flavored oatmeal’s and those are just as sweet as this and not nearly as healthy in my opinion.  That being said, next time I make this I will probably omit sugar and set it on the table so everyone can add their own.  FYI- we didn't use chocolate or brown sugar, we used carob chips and natural sugar.

YUM!   I cooked the oatmeal with soy milk instead of water in the microwave and cut out the sugar. W/o the sugar and less chocalate chips its a very tasty healthy new breakfast. Thanks for a great idea!

This was way to sweet! I even took suggestions, and put less b. sugar in it. I will make it again, but probably skip the chocolate chips. We thought the mashed banana was good in it though!

Quite good oatmeal, definitely a change from the blah regular stuff.  I also did a half milk/half water mixture, left out chocolate chips and actually didn't add any sugar, and it still tasted fine(my banana was quite ripe so I think the natural sweetness was good enough!).  I did feel a bit sick afterwards, but I think that's just from the density of the oatmeal and the rate at which I gobbled it up!

This was ok but my kids didn't like it.  I think prefavored instant oatmeal is better.

Great recipe, but we used 1/4 cup sugar and it was still too sweet, also we used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water.

I tried this recipe after reading the other reviews. I only added about a tablespoon of chocolate chips, if that, but even with that little I found it much too sweet. Drop the chocolate chips, add a little milk and it should be very yummy.

This is good if you like SWEET but don't even think about calling this oatmeal healthy!  Hey at least it has banana and oats in it though!
