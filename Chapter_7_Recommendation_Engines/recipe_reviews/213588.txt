Grew up eating this as a child (not in Canada).  Absolutely delicious!  Only difference I did is my crust is 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of flour, and 1 cup chopped pecans.  350 and bake for 25.  I also added some powdered sugar to the whipped cream.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I love it and encourage others to try.

My family has been making this recipe for years. The only change we make is to add butter to the crust, instead of margarine, and add finely chopped, toasted pecans to the crust as well. Definitely 5 stars!

My first 'experience ;) with this was in the late 1970's.  It blew us all away!  Amazing, refreshing, and leaves everyone wanting more and the recipie, which no one wanted to share... eventually I got this exact recipie.  Made it umpteen times, but lost it when moving, other's helping pack thought recipies were unnecessary to due internet recipie... I couldn't find it till I saw it on here.  Thank you SO much for posting it.  I'm from Canada also, I wonder if other countries have had this wonder of this recipie? Thanks Biancal!!!

I made this Treat quite a few times since finding a recipe similar to this. Add 1 cup of toasted & cooled, chopped Pecans to the base ingredients & bake in a 9 x 11" pan as directed. Use 2 c of heavy whipping cream (whip previously) rather than cool whip. World of difference in the taste! I use more than 1 c of heavy whipping cream for the top as more is needed to spread in that size pan! Top with shaved chocolate curls, chocolate wafers as suggested or just shake some Hot Chocolate through a strainer for even spreading. The topping choices are up to you! You will not be disappointed & this will disappear fast! Delicious Treat & not too sweet!

I fixed this according to directions & 3 cups of milk mixed with both puddings makes for too thick of pudding layer & 2 packages of cream cheese layer was over powering.   Other versions of this recipe call for 1 pkg of cream cheese and 3 cups of milk mixed with vanilla pudding and 3 cups milk mixed with chocolate pudding & they are layered, not mixed together. Needs to be some clarification in directions.

mmmmmmm!  I've made other variations of the "sex in a pan" or "better than sex cake" recipes, but this one is now my favorite by far!  I double the crust since I was going to use an 11x14 pan and it was a little bit too thick.  I think next time I'd do 1+1/2 the amount for the crust.  I also ended up using more whipping cream to cover the whole dessert and added a little bit of powdered sugar to sweeten it slightly.  I didn't have wafer cookies so I chopped some Reeses peanut butter cups and sprinkled those on top - to die for!!!  Very rich, but I WILL be making it again - you can count on it!

I was a bit nervous to try this recipe just because it seemed like it would be too sweet. I made it and it was wonderful! Not too sweet, a perfect balance I think and everyone at worked loved it. I ened up using a 13 by 9 in pan and just doubled the ingredients for the crust. This treat leaves you wanting more. So good!!!!!

My Aunt Sue brought this "pie" to Christmas 15 years ago or so.  We didn't have a name for it, so we called it "Sue Pie"....I like your name for it better, lol.  Since then we have to have this at every holiday feast, it's tradition now.  I highly recommend anyone with a major sweet tooth try this recipe.  It's the BEST and my personal all time favorite!

Great recipe.. My changes, I used butter for the crust and added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts and cut it in... Used the whole tub of Cool Whip because I found it too heavy with only two cups.. also added some powdered sugar to the whipping cream as another reviewer suggested.

Made this as-is, and it just seemed like fancy pudding with whipped cream. It all over-powered the cream cheese layer.

I found this recipe when I was looking for a sinful dessert. My family LOVES it. I double the crust but make the rest as the directed on the recipe. I added chopped cooking chocolate to the top with the chocolate wafers. I will make this many times more. Thank you for putting it one allrecipes.

The proportions of the dish seemed a little off, especially the cream cheese layer, and while it tasted fine it wasn't anything memorable. Probably won't make it again.

The best version of Sex-in-a-Pan I have ever tasted. It was a huge hit with the entire family, and it was really fun to make!

Love this recipe and it is one of the few I make (almost) exactly as the recipe states. I do use low-fat cream cheese, fat-free whipped topping, sugar-free pudding and more fat-free whipped topping instead of the whipping cream. However, it still tastes rich and delicious, just a bit healthier! :) All my friends and co-workers love it and one friend even requested this as payment for something we "bought" from her instead of money!

I used or so graham cracker, 2 chocolate puddings instead of 1 chocolate and 1 vanilla.  I didn't put whipped cream on top, but did put chocolate chips and crushed peppermint.  I make it for Christmas every year.

After reading the reviews I thought this was going to be a winner!  But it didn't go over very well with my son's hockey team and my hubby/kids basically said, "eh"...as in, it's fine but don't make it again!

Used 1/2 cup of butter not margarine and 1 cup of crushed pecans in the base. Also used fresh whipping cream rather than cool whip. Crushed Skor Bar and Peanut Butter Cups on the top instead of wafer cookies.
