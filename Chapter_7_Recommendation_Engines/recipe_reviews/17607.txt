If I would have made this recipe exactly as stated, I'm sure it wouldn't have turned out so great, like other reviewers have commented.  

However - I made a couple modifications and it turned out absolutely EXCELLENT!  I made the base recipe following the original instructions, except I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  I sliced up a white onion, (not chopped) placed half the onion slices in the bottom of the crockpot, placed the chicken on top, then put the rest of the onions on top of the chicken.  I mixed low fat crm of mush. soup & crm of chicken soup in a bowl, added a little milk until it was smooth, and then mixed in a can of diced tomatos & a can of sliced mushrooms.   I poured that over the chicken and onions, and sprinkled garlic salt, pepper and paprika on the top of everything.  Since it was just for me and my husband, I only use 3 pieces of boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I turned the crockpot on high, it only took 2 1/2 to cook.  I served over egg noodles.  

I'm not kidding.  This is one of the BEST dinners I have ever made!  The sauce was excellent and the chicken was really really moist and tender.  My husband basically licked his plate, and as I'm writing this review, he's over there eating another helping!

This was a nice change of pace during our busy week. I threw in frozen chicken breasts, a sliced onion in the beginning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some minced garlic. Set on high for 6 hours and added 1 bunch of fresh broccoli during the last 30 minutes of cooking. The broccoli was a very nice complement to this! Served over hot rice; no leftovers and loved by all!

This was really tastey!  I made it for my husband, the 8 year old boy I care for and his mother and everyone LOVED it!  I did make a few changes though.  I preseasoned the chicken with pepper, season salt and garlic (mixed the seasonings together and rubbed on the chicken)Then I added sliced fresh mushrooms (about 1/2 lb?) and sprinkled a bit more garlic on them.  Then I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the celery and mixed it with the cream of chicken.  I poured the soup mixture on top and them mixed a bit (next tim I'll probably just add mushrooms and garlic to the soup mixture and pour over the chicken).  Then near the end of cooking I added the sour cream.  I served some of the gravy mixture over mashed potatoes and a side of green beans (added some color other than browns).  The chicken was REALLY tender and all the breasts but 1 fell apart when I stired in the sour cream.  Next time I'll cook a bit less and I may use 6 breasts instead of 4.  There was A LOT of gravy left over.
Thanks for posting the recipe.:-)

This has been on my list to make all week and I finally dared try it out today.  I followed the recipe except for adding garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I think it added a lot to the flavor which probably otherwise would have been bland.  Also, I saved time by preparing everything in the slow cooker removable dish and put it in the fridge last night and just popped it in the actual unit this morning on my way out the door--it worked perfectly.  My husband and I both licked our plates (civilized, I know) and he said "Definitely make this again."  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this tonight and we liked it very much.. Since it was just for my husband and I, I only used 3 breasts, I also added garlic powder and a couple splashes of worchestire to the chicken.. In a bowl I mixed 1 can of Cream of Mushroom (lower fat) and 1 can Cream of Chicken (lower fat), 1 can of drained mushrooms, and 1 can of the french fried onions.. I then poured it all over the chicken.. I added the sour cream the last 30 minutes..I served my husbands over mashed potatoes and mine over whole wheat rotini.. Really Really good!..

This was great.  I really appreciated another reviewer mentioning that he/she put this recipe on high for 6 hours, because I didn't have as much time as the recipe called for.  Mine ended up being done by 5.5 hours on high, so this is good to know for the future.  I substituted the cream of celery for cream of broccoli, which was delicious, and cut up some fresh mushrooms.  Anticipating the extra gravy (which wasn't really all that much)I made some buttermilk biscuits, roasted potatoes and plain steamed veggies, all great for dipping.  Will make again 0 thanks!!

This was a really easy dish to prepare.  I took the advice of some of the others and seasoned chicken w/ salt, pepper, celery salt, poultry seasoning and some crushed red pepper.  I also added a small amount of water to the soups as they seemed a little too thick, and served over egg noodles with a touch of butter and salt.  As my TV idol Rachael Ray would say, "YUM-O!!!"

This came out perfect, it was in the crock pot for approximately 10 hours due to work schedule, and it fell apart.  My boyfriend never compliments my cooking, but he has for everything I have made from All Receipes.  This chicken will be made again and again in my house.

This was a recipe! I changed it a little though.  I added an onion soup mix and put garlic powder, salt and pepper, and paprika.  I also put a little milk and water into the chicken mixture.  We served it over noodles...It was definatly wonderful and my little one year old just loved it too.  Thanks!

Average recipe-but I couldn't give an average rating--erred on the side of being kind, but this is honestly one of those recipes we all find on here that makes us wonder who reviews them for publication. Really should kick myself for thinking some kind of magic was going to happen by mixing 3 (I count condensed soup as 1) average things together. Must have forgot my magic words...try it if you're desperate, but it's not amazing.

Awesome over rice or noodles.  It's become some of my favorite easy comfort food. I sometimes add some frozen vegs to make it a balanced meal.

This was really good! I made some changes, but stuck with the basic idea. I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic mixed with 1 cup of sour cream, about 1 cup of water, 2 tablespoons of worstershire sauce, and a tablespoon of paprika. Before placing the chicken breasts in the bottom of my crock pot, I rubbed them with freshly ground black peppercorns, garlic, and sea salt. After pouring the sauce mixture over the chicken, I cooked it on high for about 4 hours, and the chicken was moist and very flavorful. The sauce/gravy was awesome, and we put it over mashed potatoes. My family (me, my husband, and our 4 boys) loved it!

My husband made this tonight and it was divine!  I know- it is a canned soup meal but it was SO good!  We made it into rice bowls here's how.  Placed yummy, chicken broth, sticky rice into bowls layered with frozen broccoli that I microwaved with garlic salt (totally try it) and the NO TIME TO COOK CHICKEN AND GRAVY on top! AWESOME!!!

This was pretty good, I followed another reviewers advice and used cream of mushroom in place of cream of celery.  I used frozen chicken breasts and diced onions on top before adding the soup.  After adding the sour cream my sauce was a little on the runny side.  Next time I make it I will use fresh chicken breasts and add more seasoning.

As it turns out, I got the chance to use up a lot of canned foods I had lying around for this recipe - what a hit!! I used cream of mushroom and a can of turkey gravy. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, and two small onions (as recommended by other users) sliced thick on the bottom and on top of the chicken. I added a bit of milk to the liquid mixture, and a strained can of diced tomatoes. I didn't add the sour cream at the end (I forgot :/) and then I served it with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes! Everyone loved it! Very filling! I cooked it on high, and it was perfect right around 4 1/2, 5 hours. I will definitely make it again!

I have made this as written, tasted great but last night I played around and it was superb! I used a can of Campbells Chicken/Mushroom condensed soup ( a new product I just discovered, both in one can) and then a can of Cream of Broccoli.  Also added an italian dressing seasoning package as my only spices.  One hour before serving, I added a bag of mixed frozen vegetables.  Fantastic!  Made homemade biscuits and served the biscuits openfaced with a little cornbread stuffing and then this recipe over it, DIVINE!

I've made this about 4 times.  Outcome is always tasty.  I season chicken and add a bag of baby carrots to cook with whatever flavor condensed soups I had on hand (cream of celery and mushroom was a good combo).  Seriously good with rice pilaf or egg noodles.  I do use low fat sour cream and low sodium soups.

I am not sure what exactly what I was expecting with an entirely canned soup base, but this was inedible.  Imagine dipping chicken strips into a can of condensed soup, and that is what this tasted like. We ended up ordering take out. A total waste of money and the time that DID go into preparation. My husband, who will eat almost anything, wouldn't even touch it. I'm sorry but you may want to pass on this one. BTW, after reading other reviews, if you have to entirely modify the recipe, you aren't really rating it based on the recipe's own merits. As written this dish was horrible.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I forgot to add the sour cream, but it was great without it!  It required little prep time, and it was ready in about 6 hours.  When I tested it, the chicken literally fell apart.  It was so tender and moist.  I have never made chicken this tender, and my husband loved it.  My 7 year-old son didn't care for it because he does not like "gravy."  I will definitely make it again!

This was delicious and easy! I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder. and italian seasoning.  Followed the directions.  I added the sour cream at 6hrs 30mins.  Cooked on high last 30 mins (7 hrs total).  Next time I am going to try without sour cream. It was very tasty but the sauce become runny after adding it (looked perfect before).  If anyone has suggestions to prevent this, let me know!

Put breasts in frozen and cooked with a bit of garlic , onion and Montreal chicken spice - found it to be very bland and meat stringy.  Won't make again.

This has been one of my "go to" recipes for several years now!  I love the convenience of being able to prepare everything the night before and put the crock in the refrigerator and simply start it in the slower cooker in the morning.  No fuss and we all love it!  I do add 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1/4 tsp pepper as was advised by other reviewers.  We love this over egg noodles!  YUM!!

This came out GREAT. Very tasty, very creamy, and very easy. I served it over noodles and brought leftovers to my sister's for exchange... a hit in both homes!!! I did add veggies in the last 30 minutes (fresh broccoli carrots, and muschrooms)

Very easy preparation with a very good taste.  The only change I made was I added 2 tsp of minced garlic.  Will surely make again!

My husband and I really liked this.  I used one can each of crm of mush and crm of celery.  Added about(all measurments other than soup are approximate) a half tsp of pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp celery salt and 1/2 tsp regular salt.  Also added a couple of TBSPs of Tastefully Simple's "Onion Onion" which really added alot of flavor.  Threw it all in the crock pot at 10am and cooked it on low til about 6, added a cup of sour cream and served over egg noodles - perfect.  It's sort of like a chicken strohganoff.  DH told me he loved it 4 times.  We'll absulutely throw this one into the rotation. Thanks.

The Kids loved this!  Even the picky ones!  Thank goodeness for ONE MORE THING I can add to the list of "At least she'll eat this!"  I thought the gravy might come out a little bland, so I chopped a small onion and a few cloves of garlic ver fine and added them to the gravy mixture in the beginning.  It had a great flavor and was even better over mashed potatoes.

Too good to be true--I added 1/2 tsp paprika, garlic powder, onion flakes, and 1/4 tsp pepper. This is a recipe that will make my life with kids, work, and a husband who can't cook much easier.

IMO, without any added seasoning this tastes like chicken with cream of chicken poured over it. I took suggestions and added certain things. I did add a can of French fried onions, salt and pepper and a shake of garlic powder. I would add another can of French fried onions or some chopped onions, maybe more garlic powder/salt, celery seed/salt and red pepper. You can add anthing to your liking. The only real suggestion is to add some milk or cream to thin out the soup mixture. It was simple, good and will make it again.

My family loved this. I used chicken thighs instead of breast. I also added 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix, seasoned the chicken before adding the soup and added a small can of mushrooms because I like them. Served with rice and salad. I poured a little sauce on the rice. Very easy and good.

Tasty!

This was very good. I will use to serve when company comes as it is that tasty and easy to put together. I never change the recipe the first time, UNLESS, literally every reviewer says to. I didn't change this one and don't feel it needs changing.

I read the previous reviews and had really added spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion flakes, paprika, italian seasonings), however, it didn't come near to being enough. This recipe is a start to a good recipe, just be sure to add onion, TONS of spices, garlic(?), etc. We served over egg noodles with green beans and crescent rolls. This was a nice Sunday evening meal. Thank you.

My husband loved this!  The color is not the most appealing, but it tastes great.  I served over mashed potatoes.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery as recommeded by another reviewer.  I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces about half way through cooking to finish cooking faster.  I have a large crock pot and with the chicken cut in to small pieces it only took about 2 1/2 hours to cook.  It was so simple and fast.  I do agree with other reviewers that this recipe could benefit from more seasonings and some chopped veggies, but it's still great as is.

LOVE this recipe!  Like the others, I made a few modifications... I seasoned the chicken breasts with seasoned pepper, garlic, and onion powder.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms, chopped celery, diced onion, and then paprika for color.  I used 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken (to cut down on the sodium) and 1 regular can of cream of mushroom soup.  Served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli!  It was wonderful, will definately make it again!

LOVED IT!  This was the easiest recipe ever!  Just toss in the crockpot and go!  My husband loves anything with sourcream so he really liked it.  I made edd noodles and poured the sour cream sauce over the noodles and served the chicken on the side.  It was a wonderful dish.  I personally do not like mushrooms so I just made it with cream of chicken soups and it turned out incredible!  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful.  Fast, easy, and most of all tastes great.  Chicken came out so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I served it with buttered noodles but next time, I'll try mashed potatoes so I can take better advantage of the sauce.

I am giving this 5 stars because I believe it deserves it. This is not a fancy, elaborate, show stopping dinner. This is a I-need-to-feed-my-family-dinner. I literally spent 6 minutes on dinner tonight and had a lovely meal. I was running late to work, dumped some semi-frozen chicken in the crock pot, sprinkled it with garlic powder, added 2 cans condensed soup, and ran out the door. I didn't even stir it. When I got home I chopped up some broccoli, added it to the pot and set the rice cooker. 30 minutes later I ate dinner. I literally could not have spent more time making dinner if I tried. This was a good chicken, veggie, rice dinner. Nothing fancy-crazy, just a good dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, but I followed other's suggestions and used cream of mushroom soup in place of cream of celery.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes,  fresh mushrooms and onions.  It turned out delicious.  The one thing that I would do differently is shred the chicken about an hour before serving in order to let the flavors seep into the chicken more effectively.

I had recently wanted a crock pot and wanted a quick and easy recipe to try, and settled on this one.  My skeptical boyfriend declared it a hit!  The sauce was creamy thanks to the sour cream.  I did make it was drumsticks since we prefer dark meat.  I served it over rice, which was perfect for all the gravy.

This recipe gets 5 stars because it is so easy and tastes great! You don't usually get both ease and flavor in a main dish (in my opinion). My boneless chicken breasts were still mostly frozen, so I cut them in half. I used a large chafing dish and cooked them in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 hours and 350 degrees for the last hour. The chicken was falling a part and very moist. I doubled the recipe (which is why I didn't use my crock pot) and made the following modifications/additions: sliced an onion and laid on the bottom of my baking pan; put chicken on top of onions; sprinkled paprika, garlic salt, onion powder and fresh ground black pepper; covered with sauce (2 cans light cream of chicken, 1 light cream of mushroom, 1 reg cream of celery, 1 cup light mayo). Served over egg noodles. Family raved it was delicious! (Note: wished I had added at least 1 can of milk to make the sauce go farther). This one's a keeper!

Very good--my hubby came back for seconds pretty quickly.  I followed the advice of a few others--I used frozen chicken breasts.  I seasoned the chicken w/ garlic-pepper seasoning, used cream of chicken & cream of mushroom soups (had no cream of celery), a can of mushrooms & a little bit of french-fried onions.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours, added the sour cream & turned it to low for about 30 mins.  Served over angel hair pasta w/ a side of green beans.  Will definitely make again.

I made this due to necessity, the lady I work for (watching her kids) is in seriously need of a trip to the grocery store, but pretty much had everything to make this. For me, this was just ok as I'm not a fan of condensed soups, but, the kids loved it! My son had seconds and that rarely happens. I did make a couple of changes...used cream of chicken for both of the soups, added a packet of turkey gravy mix, and added some frozen peas in when I mixed in the sour cream. Like I said, the kids devoured it!

This was a pretty good recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery and added some garlic powder and some onions. Very easy!!!

I did season the chicken first with garlic powder, minced cloves of garlic,spritz of oregano, paprika, poultry seasoning, salt & pepper and i mixed the soup mix with minced onions(ran out of regular onions)1/2 cup of plain yogurt and a little bit of water and milk. I mixed it in the crockpot then covered the mix over the chicken. Cooked on low setting. Turned out great! It was even better as leftovers.

My whole family loved this, especially me.  I cooked pasta and poured this over top.  When I put the sour cream in, I put fresh broccoli in too and it steams it just perfect.  Wonderful recipe.

Okay, just not alot of flavor for my liking.  My hubby really likes it, not me so much.  I did like that it really was QUICK! to put together.  I served over white rice with corn.  It was a very filling meal, but will add lots of spices next time around.

This was pretty good. I even did everything wrong and it still turned out good! I used frozen chicken breasts, put in the sour cream at the beginning instead of at the end and used cream of chicken and mushroom instead of celery. I put it over rice and no one complained.

Great no fuss recipe. Very quick and easy. I used cream of mushroom since I didn't have the celery. Seasoned with pepper and garlic powder and used a low-fat sour cream. I served over rice and the kids had it with noodles.

This was great!  I used Cream of Chicken, Cream of Mushroom and Cream of potato, added oregano, italian seasonings, howlin horseradish mix, minced onions and some garlic powder.  I let it cook overnight and then added a bag of mixed vegetables and the sour cream.  Served it over rice and it was delicious!  Will definitely make this again!  Amazing what you can throw together with things in the house!  Great recipe!

I only had chicken soup in the house.  Wanted more spice so added Italian seasoning, oregeno & garlic powder.  I forgot to add the sour cream.  It came out great anyway.  Chicken was very tender and we served it over noodles.  Will make it again.

Very easy to prepare in the morning.  Smelled yummy when I got home from work 10.5 hours after starting it.  Chicken wasn't dry and was really tender.  I realized too late that I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used 1/4 c sour cream and 1/4 c fat free plain yogurt.  Tasted fine and with less fat.

I used 1/2 the cream cheese for the broth I used 1/2 the left over sauce from the chcken and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth.  Tasted great but something has to be done about the color.  It is unappetizing to look at.  Any suggestions for visual presentation?

I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery. I also added a chopped onion, a can of mushrooms and some spices. This dish was very good and very easy. The extra spices and sour cream made the dish taste fabulous. I will make this again and again!!

After completely outfitting my kithen with gourmet motif....I still opt for the "No Time To Cook Chicken" when appropriate. I did add sun dried tomatoes & fresh basil then served over a warm bed of linguine. Fabulous-oh!

This is a keeper at our house! Throw it in the Crockpot in the morning, & come home to a great dinner! I added a few dashes of Worchestershire when mixing the soups- Thanks for a great recipe, Sue Ann!! P.S.- One day later- another great meal, with pasta! My advice- make double the sauce, and use the remainder the next night. Simply cook egg noodles 'till a la dente, drain, & add to remaining gravy in slow cooker. Season to taste, and, Voila!! Another great meal, for pennies!

This sounds like a simple base recipe... So I assume you could go in many different directions from here. Thank you for giving me a place to start. I just threw in three boneless chicken breasts seasoned with garlic powder, Onion powder, smoked paprika, and a dash of kosher salt. Next I mixed the cream of celery and cream of chicken with a splash of 2% milk and set it aside while I chopped my vegetables. Fresh white button mushroom, green pepper, red pepper, and garden fresh tomatoes all look beautiful together... I hope it will taste as good as it looks! Guess I'll have to run to the store for some sour cream though, huh?

This is a great recipe for busy moms who don't feel like cooking when they get home. I substitute the cream of celery for cream of mushroom and serve over egg noodles to make it more like a stroganoff.

This smelled wonderful when we walked in the door and was very easy to assemble before work.  However, I didn't care for the taste of the gravy. I even tried to doctor it up with onion, garlic and spices. Too bad.  I really wanted to like this recipe.

We thought it was bland, even after adding half a sliced onion beneath and half a sliced onion atop the chicken, in addition to salt, fresh cracked pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.  I would not make this again.

I would have given this a 3, but the fiance loved it so I'll give it a 4.  I added seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to the mix but still found it pretty unexciting.  I'll put it in the rotation, but probably way at the back.

this dish was good...it did taste like a homemade version of a tuna-helper dish with chicken. which we liked, but i could see not being good for others. made exactly to the directions (added some carrots, other veggies) and everyone liked it..but agreed it was very tuna-helper in flavor but tasted just a little healthier

I read a review that said "not sure what I was expecting"...I guess that sums it up for me....I thought this was going to be delicious....and I really seasoned it up like suggestions....and it wasn't....wasn't bad...wasn't good....just wasn't!  My husband, who eats EVERYTHING, compared it to a meal you would eat in prison....a good prison meal....lol....since he has never been to prison...I assume he is guessing its what a good prison meal would taste like....I wouldn't make this again...

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  It is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  We used cream of mushroom soup like others suggested, and added 1 onion and mushrooms.  The chicken was soooo tender.  Will definitely make again and again.....

Excellent!.  I added in some brocolli at the last hour and then added some cooked egg noodles when done and everyone LOVED it.  Very kid friendly too.  I have never had the kids eat anything that fast!Will absolutely use again!

Very easy, delicious recipe.  I took the advice of others and added different seasonings.  I started with frozen chicken breasts and then added minced garlic, minced onion, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper.  I also used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and the chicken is very tender.  Very tasty served over mashed potatoes with fresh homemade biscuits.

This could have been 5 stars, but it definitely needs some seasonings...I added salt/pepper, chopped garlic and rosemary.  The recipe is very creamy! I put this in the crockpot on HI for 1 hour and then on LO for another 3 hours and it was done (I used frozen chicken too)!!! Thanks for the recipe...it was so good!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and kids LOVED it!  They wanted it for a snack before bed and my husband wanted to know if I could make it again tomorrow!  The only changes I made were I used one can of cream of mushroom soup & one can of cream of chicken soup.  I seasoned the chicken (I used 7 breasts) w/garlic salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper.  I also put sliced onions under & on top of the chicken and added some chopped garlic.  I added the 1/2 cup of sour cream 30 minutes before it was done.  I served it with mashed potatoes & corn on the cob.  It was scrumptious and it will be put in the rotation of regular meals--and the bonus is that it's SUPER easy to make!

This recipe works well! I did follow the advice of the other cooks and added my own seasonings before adding the soups. I used 6 chicken breasts, put them in the crock pot mostly frozen, sprayed them with Pam, sprinkled them with sea salt, freshly ground pepper, minced onion and garlic. Then I added the soups and let it cook. Turned out yummy. My whole family liked it. I served it over rice. There was plenty of "gravy," even just using two cans of soup with 6 breasts.

This is a good base recipe then add what you like. I added fresh mushrooms and frozen veggies about 1/2 hr before it was done & served with rice. The taste was ok nothing exciting. As someone else stated it tasted like chiken w/ cream of mushroom soup poured over it. It gets 5 stars for easiness but I can only give it a 3 on taste. The leftovers were never eaten. Will not make again.

This was a great recipe, I did take the advice of a previous review and used Healty Request Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup.  Also added a package of fresh mushrooms cut into quarters.  My kids loved it!!

With the right additions, this dish is GREAT (and then rates 5 stars).  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup(it was whatwas on hand), 2 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 envelope onion soup mix, 2 tsp. seasoned salt, 1 tsp Montreal chicken spice, 1 tsp garlic and herb spice, 2-3 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp. parsley.  I cooked it up and added teh sour cream, and then served it over mashed potatoes. And then a miracle happened - My WHOLE family liked it! GOD bless!!!! :-)

I thought this was a great recipe for chicken breasts in the crock pot.  I haven't had much luck cooking chic breasts in the crock pot before.  I made a couple modifications.... I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, some ground pepper and used cream of mushroom instead of celery.  I served it with brown rice and peas.  I consider it yummy comfort food.  My husband said it 'needed something' so he put grated cheddar cheese on it.

WOW!!  This recipe was sooooo GOOD!  I only changed a few things, i didnt have cream of celery so i used cream of mushroom, also added a can of mushrooms and added some spices, like garlic, sea salt and a few other of my favorites.  I then made mashed potatoes on the side and the gravy from the chicken was excellent on the potatoes!  Definately a 5!!

Flavor of sauce was good, added garlic and lots of black pepper.  Chicken shredded and was dry.  Does not need to cook as long as stated.

My family and I really liked this. I browned my chicken tenderloins (mostly for looks) then used 1/2 cup of milk to get the leavings out of the pot and added it to my cream soups with 2 TBSP of french onion soup mix. I also added an extra can of cream of chicken and put my cooked egg noodles into the crockpot before turning it off.  Simple and great!

Pretty fair, but not awesome.  I had a small chicken that would have spoiled if I didn't do something, so I was looking for a recipe I could set and forget.  This recipe is as easy as it gets, and is more than edible.  Just don't let the chicken cook for too long.

I was not so crazy about this but my husband and kids all enjoyed it.  The chicken was moist and flavorful but the gravy tasted like what it is - condensed soup.

I used frozen chicken tenders and added onion salt, onions, mushrooms, and garlic salt and garlic powder and cooked it for 9 hours on low and served it over rice.  It turned out great except I forgot the sour cream, which probably would have made it even better.  It was so easy!  Will make again.

This was great! I used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 10 hours. The chicken was so moist! This is a definite keeper - great for those days when you don't feel like cooking, but want a home-cooked meal.

This was ok, but not great.  It was like every other cream soup/chicken crockpot recipe.  The consistancy got to me after about 1/2 a chicken breast, although my very picky husband said he really liked it. Not a keeper for me.

Unbelievably easy & delicious! I did this as a last minute dinner, and only had fat free cream of chicken, and fat free cream of mushroom.   I added pepper, garlic powder, and some italian seasoning for color.  I also only had frozen chicken breasts.  So, I threw everything in, put it on high, and the chicken was tender & scrumptious in 2 1/2 hours!  Great over rice! Wow!  Thank you!

My husband thought this was excellent.  I added onion flakes, pepper and a dash of worstershire to the soup mixture.  The chicken was delightfully tender and moist and I shredded it into the gravy before serving.  The only drawback is I think it's a bit salty but I can correct that in the future...my compliments!

Outstanding!!  I used a whole, 6 lb chicken, and cooked it on high for 6 hrs and it was falling off the bones!  I , too, added pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to taste, and Wow!, the gravy was fabulous..we put it on homemade stuffing...

I LOVE this recipe! I used the low-fat version of the soups and non-fat sour cream. It tasted wonderful! It made a yummy gravy to serve over rice. I threw in some frozen peas and carrots with the rice, easy meal! Thanks!

Not bad. Only had cream of mushroom soup on hand so used 2 cans of that plus some garlic, paprika, and pepper. Left it to cook for bout 6 hours and chicken was nicely shreddable. Used a bit less sour cream than called for but came out pretty well. Not a recipe I'd absolutely rave about but make nice meal without much effort. Served with couscous tossed with toasted cumin seeds and garlic chives.

I made this yesterday. I forgot to use the sour cream that I made a special trip to the store to get. 
Even with no sour cream, this turned out so yummy. The chicken was so moist. And, super easy to make.

after reading the reviews i added instant rice to it garlic powder, onion powder,use 2 cans of both soups instead of one, poultry seasoning and i added 2 tablespoon of butter which helped the taste tremendously.if it was just as is i would of given it 3 stars this didn't have any seasoning it was bland without adding stuff to it.

Thank you for sharing this especially for those who are too busy. However I do think that this kind of easy cooking requires a bit of extra fat (sour cream and such) and we end up compromising on the health of our family. :(. But great dish and I added my own variation-spiced it up a bit with garlic and seasoning and instead of the sour cream added milk/cream of mushroom.

Awesome!  I made it just the way Michelle McCormick did, added a can of tomatoes, a can of mushrooms, some sliced onion and seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic salt.  Served over egg noodles, IT WAS AWESOME!! A great go-to recipe, quick, cheap, and you have everything in the house already.  I will definitely make this again.

This was quite good and I too made some additions and subtractions like some of the others here. I'm mainly reviewing this so I can remember what I did for the next time I cook this. I used cream of celery and cream of mushroom, added sliced onion and chopped one rib of celery since I had it. I also added two carrots, chopped as well. Forgot the sour cream. Added a drained can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, and added more minced garlic. Added maybe a tsp of oregano, and a liberal amount of black pepper. Shredded the chicken about 2 hours prior to serving, and added a can of cut up white potatoes to it about 1 hour before. Served with Zatarans Yellow Rice. Giving 4 stars due to all my changes, but my version was DELICIOUS.

Chicken always turns out perfect. I have actually made this with just 2 cans cream of chicken soup versus the cream of celery...my kids just like it better that way. Use this one a lot.

This wasn't a big hit. The chicken fell apart and the whole mess was very soupy with no flavor. Won't make it again.

Great basic recipe.  You can make it your own or prepare as is.  I added chopped onion and a can of green chiles and dash of red pepper. Serve over crisp fried tortilla with grated cheese on top with a side salad or guacamole or crush a few tortilla chips and add the last hour or torn flour tortilla....sprinkle with cheese and serve. Crock pot version of King Ranch casserole. Yummy

This is great when you don't know what else to make or have the time.It always comes out with plenty of flavor and I have tried many varieations with different kinds of soup.It's also great for getting rid of older soups in the pantry.

As previous reviews mentioned I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  I added 8oz of sliced fresh mushrooms and seasoned chicken breasts with garlic, salt and pepper.  I used fresh chicken and cooked it on high for 6 hours.  The chicken was a little dry, next time I will use frozen or less time.  Or maybe on low??  We served it over egg noodles and everyone loved it.  I didn't add the sour cream because it was creamy enough.  I will definitely use this again!

i would absolutely make this recipe again!  it was easy and very little clean up, because it was in the slow cooker.  i took the suggestions of a few other users, and added celery salt, pepper, and poulry seasoning and it was great!  i even shared this recipe with my mother!

This was good, will make again. But I agree with most everyone else that more seasoning is needed.  I served with mashed potatoes, the gravy/sauce was a nice touch. Can see the same going over rice.

SO EASY! Because of my work day, the chicken was cooking in the slow cooker for 10 hours... I slightly seasoned the chicken the night nefore with salt and pepper. Since I was cooking 6 breast halves, instead of 4, i added a little milk to the soup. Also at the end, I added a full cup of sour cream.   This chicken tasted GREAT!!!! We ate it over rice and steamed asparagus. The sauce is definitely a good accent for vegetables, so I will be tryin this recipe will a variety of sides.

I swapped out the cream of celery with cream of mushroom, and added some smoked paprika.  Yummy.  I served it with mashed potatoes, but I would love it with rice.  Easy as can be.

Yum! This was really tender & versatile and a big hit in the house. We ate it over whole grain pasta. My only complaint is that it was a little on the bland side (for me). Next time I make it, I will add some additional seasonings. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good and I liked it. Super easy and I will most likely make it again.   Couple of things though. It was a little bland. Definitely needs more seasoning. At the end of the cooking time I removed the chicken and kept it warm in the oven. Then I threw in some milk, parmesan cheese, black pepper, granulated garlic powder, egg noodles and turned it up to high. When I make it again I will also add some veggies like a can of peas or green beans plus onions and mushrooms. Thanks.

A little bland as is. The second time around, I added seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, a little pepper, and 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. Served over rice with peas and biscuits. Very easy to make and pretty good with the added spices. I'll definitely make it again.

This was good with a few changes.  I did add seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I used a can of cream of chicken instead of the cream of celery.  Also, I added a bag of frozen broccoli florets at the end.  Served over rice.

We just finished eating this recipe for lunch.  It was very good.  I made some changes because of the reviews I read but it is a great base recipe.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery and added a can of mushrooms.  I added a little milk to thin the sauce a bit.  I also added some poultry seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder.  The last half hour I added the sour cream and some frozen peas (broccoli would be good too but I didn't have any).  I served it over egg noodles.  I am already planning to make this again and use a can of Veg-all for the veggies and serve it over biscuits.

So easy and so tasty! Like the other reviewers suggested, I added seasonings--thyme, sage, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder--to the soups, then poured it over the 3# of frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Cooked on HIGH for 5 or so hours, then turned to LOW. Added light sour cream and shredded the now-tender meat. Served over brown rice. You definitely need side dishes with bright colors to complement this meal. I served peas/carrots and cranberry sauce to add visual interest and round out the meal.

We really liked this recipe. Although, I did alter some things. After reading many of the reviews it sounded like it might be a bit bland. So, I added half a white onion (chopped), garlic powder, seasoned salt, paprika, & black pepper. I added a bag of frozen California blend veggies. However, forgot to add the sour cream until I had everyone's plate made. No worries, we just added a small dollop on top & mixed it in. Served it over cooked egg noodles. Very tasty & filling!

This is one of those great jumping off point recipes. I used both the creme soups and added s&p (of course) some garlic powder, smoked paprika, and dried thyme. I needed this to be an all in one meal so I added some diced onions , mushrooms, and some spinach that needed to be used up. Tasted great served over egg noodles and was something easy for the DH to serve everyone for dinner.

This was awesome and easy!  My children loved it.  I shredded the chicken towards the end while in the crock pot so it would be easier to eat for the kids.  I only had one can of soup so I added Italian salad dressing in place of the second can.  I also added lots of parmesan cheese and served over spaghetti.  Next time I'll definitely have to make more!  BTW, it only took 3 1/2 hours to cook on high and the chicken was still tender.

Way too bland for my taste, especially as written. Even adding half an onion, salt, and pepper was still bland. HOWEVER, my husband really liked it. Go figure!

Having read all reviews from this site; I had anticipated a rather bland taste of this recipe but was adamant to try out anyway.  I made the following adjustments:- I sliced 1/2 big onion, sliced a small carrot and added 1/2 cup of sliced green pepper before putting my 3 pcs. of frozen chicken halves into the slow cooker to cook for 2 hrs on HIGH with another hour on LOW. The chicken halves were rotated on every hour interval to avoid hardened chicken but the taste was indeed somewhat bland towards the last 1/2 hour of cooking. So, I added additional seasoning such as cracked black pepper, paprika, and pinch of sea salt and 1 tbsp. of Italian Dressing to help salvage the taste. I served the chicken with bowtie pasta and topped with some freshly chopped parsley and some parmesan cheese. Tough it is a simple recipe but tasted just like some chicken cooked with cream of______ soup and just far from "WOW" factor. Lots of leftover! Had tough time cleaning up my cooker due to burnt edges all over and this is out of my recipe box for now!

I was looking for something different for dinner. I found this recipe and read all the reviews and decided to try it. I substituted cream of mushroom for the celery and added minced garlic, like so many others said. It was REALLY good!  The chicken just fell apart. My boyfriend said that it would be good on an open face sandwich... so that's what we will do with the left overs tomorrow. I'd recomend this recipe.  Play with it to get the desired taste that your family will love. We will surely have this again and again!!!

Great, Fast recipe. I love it, but I modified it a bit to suit our tastes. I added minced garlic and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I didnt have cream of celery soup as well, so i used a can each of the cream of chicken and golden mushroom soup. I added fresh carrots, onions & celery to it as well. I then cut the 4 chicken breasts into long strips then cut them in half (kids love it that way)... sprayed the crock with olive oil, lined the bottom of the crock with the chicken chunks and seasoned them with s&p, added veggies on top then the sauce. Served it over Bastmati Rice and It is now a family favorite.

AWESOME recipe!!!  So simple and delicious!!  We did follow other reviewers' suggestions and add some fresh garlic and a bit of pepper to enhance the flavor.  I put in 6 frozen breasts and cooked on high for 5.5 hours.  I shredded the chicken when I added the sour cream, and served it over rice.  My husband could not stop raving about it!  Even my ultra picky 4yr old dd ate her whole helping. I would give this 10 stars if possible.

I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup instead of cream of celery soup as others recommended.  I seasoned the chicken before placing it in the crockpot and then shredded it before serving.  I wasn't that impressed with the recipe and probably won't make it again.

The title of this recipe isn't kidding - so easy! I cooked mine on high for 5 hrs per another user's suggestion. I also threw in a chopped onion, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and added fresh broccoli in the last half hour to make it an all-in-one meal! Served over rice. So tasty. Will definitely make again!

This was 5 stars b/c of the combination of yumminess and easyness. It was great! We both liked it alot. I was also liking my plate clean. Shred up the chicken in the sauce next time to make it more moist next time. Served over Egg noodles, added a can of mushrooms.

What an easy way to get a start on a comfort food dinner. I seasoned the chicken with salt and a good amount of fresh ground black pepper. I cooked at low for a little less than 8 hrs. The chicken was moist and very tender. I served with dressing, cranberry sauce,and the green and gold veggies from this site. A very comfort food type dinner without the investment of time or effor. I am going to try this method to prepare chicken to be used in enchiladas. I think I'll just use chicken broth and a little tomatillo sauce for flavor and let it cook all day - it should make the shredding much faster!

not crazy about this one.  tasted pretty blah to me.  used 4 frozen breasts, 1 can crm of chick, 1 can crm of mushroom, some minced garlic.  cooked on low for 6.5 hrs then shredded & added sour cream.  needed flavor so added black/red pepper mix & parm. to give it more texture i mixed it with spaghetti & put it in a little casserole dish, crumbled up club crackers on top and baked for a little bit - the crunch helped. the chicken actually tasted kind of like canned chicken for some reason & that really turned me off.  it wasn't bad, i just don't think i'll make it again.

I really liked this recipe. It's easy, it only uses a few ingredients, and it's good. I was a little concerned that the chicken would be dry (usually boneless breasts in the crockpot come out dry for me), but the sauce made up for any dryness. I will definitely make this one again.

I loved this, hubby thought it was just ok but he still practically licked his plate.  I served the chicken over a bed of mashed patatoes and smothered with the "gravy".  I added a handful of diced onions, salt & peppered the chicken, and used only 2 chicken breasts with one can of cream of celery.

Without a crock pot? I also modified this recipe slightly as suggested by others, using fresh boneless chicken breast, mushroom soup and celery soup, and added some garlic and a tbsp of fresh mixed herbs from my garden (oregano, sage, thyme and chives). But the big difference is that I did not cook it in a crock pot as I do not own one. I put it all together as soon as I got home after work, putting all except the sour cream in a deep frying pan with a lid. Then cooked it covered for 20 minutes or so on medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning. I added the source cream at the end.  I checked that the internal temp of the meat was 160 degrees… and voila, a great dish in less than 30 minutes…I read that chicken breast is great poached, so this in effect was poached in the soup mixture. I served it with rice and green peas.

This was a good recipe.  It did create a lot of gravy, so I accompanied the chicken with rice.  When I make it again I will add some texture like bell peppers or onions..if you add carrots it could be a great soup!

This came out great.  I followed the recipe exactly except for sprinkling the chicken breasts with black pepper and garlic powder before adding them to the crock pot.

I really enjoyed this.  I used 4-5 frozen chicken breasts, garlic salt, italian seasoning, 1/2 can milk, and added more sour cream.  Served over noodles or rice.

This was so-o easy & yummy!  I saved this recipe over a year ago & finally got around to make it. The only thing different I did was used the 98% fat free soups, I added a little milk, parsley, garlic, pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper (would be good w/out).  I served it with mashed potatoes & corn.  Everyone was happy with this recipe, even my picky eaters.  Not too many recipes can pass that test. This is moving over to one of our family favorites.

I have only reviewed a few recipes, but this was worth sharing. My whole family- including4 and 5 year olds loved this and my mom and mom-in-law. I didn't have sour cream-left it out. Added fresh onions, 3 garlic cloves, celery and an 8 oz. pkg of mushrooms, along with a packet of onion soup mix as someone suggested. Cooked on low for 8 hours- perfect everytime. My husband ate it as is. I put it over brown rice- sooo good with the gravy.

I did not like this at all. It was very bland, and although I added salt, pepper, onions, garlic, garlic powder and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery, there just wasn't much taste or color. Since I didn't use the cream of celery and that might have affected it and my husband found it okay, you might want to try it if these ingredients usually add up to tasty food in your book.

This recipe was so good and super easy!! I was looking for a recipe to try and use what I had at home and this was it!! I didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of mushroom.  I also added a drained jar of sliced mushrooms, a little minced onion, and some garlic powder.  I served it over hot egg noodles with some steamed broccoli and it was a hit!! I'm a re-born crockpot user now!!!!

I added a can of mixed veggies, and used water instead of sour cream because I wanted it lower fat.  I also added seasonings to give it more flavor.  I will make this again.

I had 2 cans cream mushroom soup on hand and that is what I used. I added 1 packet onion soup mix and salt,pepper. Served over instant garlic mashed potatoes. My husband enjoyed it even though he doesn't like mushrooms which he didn't know I used until his plate was empty!  We had leftovers the next day- served the chicken and "gravy" mixture over toast.  Even better the second day.

This was a very easy dinner to make, and my husband LOVED it. I got the thumbs-up inbetween bites.  I didnt think it was AS good, but not bad. I added an envelope of onion soup mix to the soup mixture, which added some taste. I also added fresh asparagus when I added the sour cream, and served it with rotini noodles.

I thought this was kind of plain.  It lacked a lot of depth of flavor.  It was VERY simple.  If you are looking for an easy to make dish this one will suit your needs wonderfully but I wouldn't make it if you are trying to impress guests.

I made some changes after reading some reviews.  I cooked on low for 5.5 hours. I used one large chicken breast cut into cubes and 5 chicken thighs cut in into cubes. I used cream of mushroom & garlic and cream of chicken soups b/c that's what I had and I added 2 garlic cloves and one medium onion.  I think next time I make it I would add tin mushrooms and maybe some potato cut up.  I thought it was good, I plan on making it again and playing with the recipe a little.

This was so easy and very good.  Mu husband doesn't really care for chicken dishes but he really liked this one.  I did add garlic powder and salt and pepper for a little extra taste.  I also shredded the chicken halfway through cooking and served over white rice.

I feel let down.  
After all of the wonderful reviews, I made this meal for my boyfriend thinking that I would wow him with my culinary skills.  Maybe it was the ingredients I used (fat free cream of mushroom and cream of celery, and fresh mushrooms) or perhaps I used used too much season salt.  Either way, it was just okay.  I won't make this again.  Thank you anyway, b/c it was SUPER easy and I hate meals that require tons of prep work.

I actually used reduced fat cream of chicken soup, and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup (instead of the celery).  It was absolutely wonderful.  I served it over mushroom risotto and I can't believe how easy and wonderful it tasted.  I will definitely make this again, and again!

This was an excellent, no fuss recipe!  I thought the lack of spices in the recipe was a little concerning, so I made sure to add salt and pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning to the chicken before placing in the crock pot.  Would definitely do that again, as it came out delicious and so tender!  Now that I'm writing this review, I think I will have to make this again this week!  Yum!

After tasting this dish, I have to admit that I am quite surprised that it is rated so high.  While it didn't taste bad - it was incredibly bland and the chicken was rather dry.  As a side note - I also find that it smells of cat food (the canned variety) - but I'm pregnant, so it could just be me!  I may try this dish again - but I would add some things - like a package of onion soup mix for some flavour - and some veggies.

Like most other reviewers I find it's a little bland unless you add some spices.  I added garlic, italian seasoning, pepper, and paprika.  I also used mushroom and celery soups because I had no chicken soup on hand.  Good idea for a recipe though.  Will definately make again just because its so easy!

My husband ate this, but said "don't make it again". The chicken was moist and tender but the flavor of the sauce was not appealing to our taste.

This was a simple, tasty recipe!  I added a chopped onion to it, as well as herb chicken seasoning and lots of garlic powder and black pepper.  Like other reviewers, I cooked this on high for 4 hours.  It was delicious!  Will make this one again and again!

This was the perfect comfort food while my husband & I had bad colds. The sour cream really added a nice flavor.  We served it over warm whole wheat bicuits.  Thanks!

This recipe was good.  I would recommend reducing the cooking time however because the chicken was a little dry (and I used pretty thick chicken breasts).  It did really fall apart though.  I served with yellow rice and mixed vegetables.  My toddler liked it and she doesn't eat much meat (I had to rinse the sauce off of it for her though).

I thought this recipe needed a little something else.  Though the soups made a nice sauce, the chicken was a little bland.  I probably won't make this again.

This was absolutely the BEST chicken I have had in ages. I did just like the recipe said but added a little black pepper. I made mashed potatoes and seasoned green beans and it was a great "down home" kinda meal.

This chicken is great!! Very flavorful and SOOO easy to make.  I will be cooking this one often.  Children loved it also which is a great plus.  I cooked it a little to long and the chicken was a little dry , but the sauce made it taste so good and it was very tender.

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  We all like to add our personal touch to a recipe, but for my 1st time I decided to cook the recipe as stated.  It was very good.  I served it over rice.  I found that it was a little bit too salty.  I had seasoned the chicken breast with seasoning salt.  Next time I will use just herbs and substitute one of the soups with a low-salt version.  I am cooking this recipe again this weekend for a large group because it's easy and tasty.  I too reduced the cooking time to 4 hours.

This was pretty good!  I used frozen chicken breasts, cooked on high for 1 hour, then down to low for another 6 hours.  We served it over noodles.  VERY good.  I was impressed, it's so simple!

This is so good!  My whole family loves it.  Even my picky 4 year old niece.  My sister-in-law used the leftovers for quesadillas.  She added a little bit of oil to a pan, added a tortilla, scooped the chicken mixture (she shredded the chicken) on one side and folded over the tortilla.  Flipped it to cook on both sides and then served with lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream.  I'm going to try this next

I used a cut up fryer and it cooked in 3 hours on high. I thought it was easy, but pretty bland. It needs something, perhaps some instant onion soup mix added in for flavor. Not bad, but not particularly great. Probably won't make this again as is.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!!  I also cooked it in half the time (4 hours on high).  The chicken was very moist and tender.  I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika.  Next time I will try using one low sodium soup, it was just a tad salty.  I will be making this easy and delicious recipe once a week and will defintitely pass it on to family and friends!  Thanks!  :)

I really liked this recipe. It makes a lot of nice gravy which I enjoyed over mashed potatoes. I did add some seasonings as some of the other reviewers did. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder, seasoned salt and a little black pepper. I stirred in a few good splashes of worcestershire sauce into the soups. I will make this again as everyone enjoyed it. Yummy!

My husband and my kids love this.  I served it over very broad noodles, and there was only enough left for my husband to take for his lunch.  I did add just a little bit of salt, pepper and paprika before I added the soups, and it was wonderful!

Made as directed along with some suggestions from reviewers.  1) Sprinkled onion powder, paprika, and pepper on chicken before putting in crock pot. Put chopped onions and minced garlic under the chicken.  Only used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts so cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours.  Used cream of celery, cream of mushroom (since I was out of cream of chicken) and added about a tablespoon of powdered chicken bouillon).  Served over mashed potatoes w/sides of corn and peas. I don't eat meat but my husband does.  He LOVED it.  I loved the gravy on the mashed potatoes!  Will definitely add to my rotation!

Great for little kids because it isn’t spicy.  The next day I added leftover noodles, chicken, Carrot chips, and lots of chicken stock to the sauce and turned it into chicken noodle soup. They loved it.

I have had this recipe saved for a long time. And this was awesome I used way more chicken then the recommendation and will probably double the soups for more gravy. Served it over rice and veggies and it was a hit. Only change was I used thinner breast put it on for 6 hours and my husband shredded the chicken lightly mid way thru delicious!!!

This turned out ok. I ended up seasoning my chicken quite heavily with pepper, garlic powder and seasoning salt. Sliced up an onion and placed thick slices under the chicken. I used cream of mushroom soup and cream of broccoli as that’s what I had. I added milk and at the end added sour cream but I wish I hadn’t as it made it look kind of yucky. Served it with mashed cauliflower and corn. Ok for a quick meal but don’t think I will make this again.

I doubled the recipe since we have 4 teenage boys, using about 6 big chicken breasts , 1 cup of sour cream,  2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup.  Everyone loved it!

I'm giving five stars but made some modifications. I added onions, garlic and a couple of spices (Basil and thyme). I also added a 10 oz package of broccoli and cheese. The broccoli and cheese really improves the taste.

Like other reviewers, I did feel the need to season the chicken breasts prior to cooking. Just used a little bit of salt, pepper, and onion powder to make sure there would be some flavor. Really loved the use of sour cream, I even added a little extra as both myself and my boyfriend love it. Lots of extra sauce left over, which was great even the next day.

This was a great receipt when you don't want to cook up a meal in the evening but want something tasty. This was taste and quick to prepare. Followed the 8 hours on low and added sour cream 1/2 hour before done. My wife and I enjoyed it over some rice. Easy, and it was good tasting. I added frozen veggies but it created a little thinner gravy. Could prepare them separately. Added them into the crock pot already defrosted and less water. Thanks Sue Ann!

Very good basic recipe. I followed other review suggestions and pre-seasoned a little but the chicken still turned out bland. The star of the dish for me was the leftover gravy, which I served over roasted potatoes. Good simple recipe for somebody new to slow cooking

Yes I followed the original recipe but added some steamed broccoli at the end and just left out the sour cream. peppered it up and it was mouthwatering and delist. The crowd went WILD over it . I don't think there will be any left by morning. Have to make this again. But Double the batch for next time.

I made this using chicken pieces (breast, thigh, and legs) instead of boneless/skinless breasts. Aside from that, I followed the recipe but was disappointed to see that the sauce cooked into a broth rather than a gravy. Could it be because I used chicken pieces instead of boneless/skinless breasts?

The name of this recipe says it all. I'm going to be completely honest. I had about 2 minutes to throw a bunch of stuff in the crock pot between picking my kid up from school and taking him back to school for band practice. I read the ingredients and pretty much just chucked it all in there. The chicken was frozen and I added the sour cream from the start. I cooked it on high (because I didn't take the time to read the directions through) and ran out the door. The smell when we came home was fantastic. I added a bit of salt and pepper at the end and also scooped some of the soup out to add cornstarch to in order to thicken the soup into more of a gravy. It was simple and not the most elegant or extravagant meal but delicious and hearty and perfect for a day when there's no time and I don't want to subject my family to fast food. Or pb&j. You get the picture.

This recipe is so bland. And adding the sour cream in the last 30 minutes with the cooker on low does not allow enough time for it to melt so you end up with bland chicken and chunks of sour cream floating around. I will never make this again.

Overall it was good.  Next time I won't add the sour cream.  I also added a bag of chopped broccoli along with salt, pepper, garlic salt and seasoning salt to taste.  I put it over noodles as well.  Easy meal!

I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts; mushroom soup instead of celery soup.
I ladeled it over mashed potatoes & some broccoli heads and sprinkled grated cheese on top.
DELICIOUS!!!

I made exactly as the recipe called for. It was just okay. Extremely easy though and my two boys loved it. I will make it again for them. We had it over rice and broccoli. Next time I will add more seasoning and maybe some mushrooms and onions.

Kids LOVED it! And it was super easy to make! However, it was bland. I had to add some garlic powder and a few other seasonings to bring it to taste.

This was so easy and tasted great. I did make some small changes that were posted by others. Still every one ate it even my picky 4 year old.

This is edible but that's about it, it fills the gut. I took other reviewers' advice and seasoned the chicken first, added onions, mushrooms but it still was pretty bland for our tastes. If you're looking for something that's quick and filling, go for it.

I made some changes and this was great! Only used one can of mushroom soup-1 cup milk, fresh mushrooms, cilantro, onion flakes,and cooked 
bacon on top. Over sticky rice this was so good!

This recipe actually surprised me, it was better than I expected. I was looking for something easy with the ingredients I had on hand. I served it over white rice. The kids loved this - I did not have to nag anyone to finish their plates. It is what it is, easy and tasty enough. I knew right off the bat this was going to be simple - I added various seasonings to my liking, otherwise it would have been really bland.

Not awesome, I even added some of the ingredients suggested by another member and it was still bland and runny. I gave it two stars because I didn't  throw it away. I won't be making this again.

Surprisingly good considering so few ingredients. Made exactly as stated. Pretty basic tasting so I am only giving it 4 stars. Good for a quick throw together crock pot meal.

Used 4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves and no sour cream at all. Did add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours but could've gone a little less next time or on a lower setting. Was really good. Makes a lot of 'gravy' for rice or potatoes.

So easy and delicious.  Great comfort food on a cold day.  Took the advise of other reviewers and seasoned chicken breast with garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.  Great over mashed potatoes.

This recipe is great as a base recipe.  I made this recipe with cream of mushroom instead of celery and forgot to add the sour cream.  I was great, but I can see where adding some broccoli or mixed veggies to it would give it an extra kick.  I served mine on whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  So Good!!

This was really easy and REALLY good.  Cooked on high for 4 hours but it looked done when I checked it after 3 1/2 hours.  30 minutes before serving, I microwaved a bag of broccoli in cheese sauce (Steam Fresh) and then threw it in w/ the chicken.  Served over brown rice - my boyfriend was caught licking his plate! Thumbs up!

This was pretty good, but I added an onion thinly sliced and minced garlic clove, 1 tsp of olive oil and some balsamic vinegar.  At the end I added a packet of Lipton French onion mix with the sour creme. It was very soupy, but the chicken was delicious and the soup mixture tasted really good over the noodles.

I literally make this when I have no time to cook. Made it once for my neighbor who just had a baby - they LOVED it. Recently made it for the boys when they came home from a long trip. Left a note by the crock pot with instructions for adding the sour cream at the end. :) They figured it out. Comfort food at its easiest!

Very simple and flexible recipe - I used cream of mushroom soup (didn't have cream of celery), and instead of the additional chicken breast, I tossed in diced potatoes and chopped carrots. Perfect. To season, I added celery seed, dill seed, cracked black pepper and sage about 30 minutes before serving.

Made this as written but added garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, and a small sliced onion. It was fairly bland with these additions, so all alone it would have been reeeeaaaaalllllly bland. FYI -- Adding an onion made my house reek! Regardless, it was quite easy. Might make again adding more spices.

This was an excellent basic recipe!  I made it per the instructions the 1st time it was good.  The great thing about it is that once you have made the basic recipe you can add things that suit your families tastes.  We add green chiles, onions and mushrooms.  We also make sure to season the chickens 1st -- this also works great with pork chops.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have Celery soup, so I used Mushroom!  I put frozen chicken tenders in - seasoned with the Essence of Emeril.  Apparently, it wasn't seasoned enough.  Needed something.  Next time I'll try maybe a little curry!  Served over rice, DH cleaned his plate!

This was so good! I also sprinkled them with poultry seasoning and garlic powder. After it was all assembled in the crock pot I poured a drained can of mushrooms over the top. We are going to add this to our regular rotation! Thanks!

My family all liked this.  It's basically chicken and gravy.  I whipped up a box of Stove Top and served the chicken and gravy over it with peas.  Great summer recipe.  While out at the pool, it can cook, your kitchen stays cool and you don't have a big mess to clean up.

Very good and simple to prepare. Chicken just fell apart. I served it over rice.

This tasted really good, considering it ending up cooking 10 hours.  I am just not 100% sold on the fall-apart texture of the chicken.  The sauce is delicious.  I am going to try this again, cooking just until the chicken is done.  Added a large onion at the beginning.  Served over egg noodles.

Really easy and tasty! I let it cook for probably 9 hours since I got stuck at work, and it was wonderful. I served it over egg noodles..yum!

I must have done something wrong...the chicken was dry.  However, the sauce was fantastic served over rice.  Chicken-3 stars, sauce-5 stars, entire meal averaged to 4 stars.

Wow! I have to say, I'm quite impressed. I wasn't sure how this would taste but it was just wonderful. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, other then that followed the recipe to a T. It was super good. I served it with mashed potatoes and the sauce was super yummy over the potatoes!!

This is one of the best recipes on this website. We make it often and when I don't have cream of celery on hand, cream of mushroom is just as good. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Just made this one this evening.  Great basic recipe..I made some changes.  I used "ready to serve" organic cream of chicken soup and condensed cream of mushroom soup. Added one clove of minced garlic and two stalks of sliced celery.  Added diced carrot and one cup of frozen peas when I added the sour cream.  Also used a few turns on the pepper grind.  
Served over rice and with garlic bread. This was delicious...my VERY picky 6 year old loved it.

This was not good for us at all. I made it according to the recipe, adding the extra flavorings suggested by the other reviewers. Even though I used only 3 breasts, the gravy was too thick AND we did not care for the taste. We are getting take out tonight.

This is great and easy to change up a little, I have used cream of onion and cream of chicken with herbs in this and they were both great.  I always double the sauce so I can use it with noodles or rice.

I tried to lean it out by using the lite versions of the soups. Perhaps that was the reason it tasted so bland.

The end result deserves a 5 star even though I did not follow the recipe. My end result came out like shredded chicken (not sure if that is how it is suppose to be), but it was perfect for sandwiches. I think this is due to over cooking the chicken (12 hours). I did not add the sour cream at the end & initially added 1 tablesoon of pepper. I will definitely make this again...I will just follow the recipe more closely next time.

I tried it last night & we all thought it was ok. It is a great base to jazz up to your taste. I added a poblano, garlic salt & pepper. It gave it a little more dimension. It does make a lot of gravy so I'll try 6 pieces of chicken next time.

Good! I used (low sodium) cream of mushroom/cream of chicken cuz that's what I had and chicken thighs for some delicious dark meat (don't eat the skin, and the dark meat is much more nutritious than the white). Added brocoli at the end (only for 15 minutes cuz we don't like soggy vegetables). Next time though, I won't add the veggies - defeats the purpose if they are drowned in cream sauce! Overall, super easy, tasty and almost healthy! will make again cuz it's so darn easy!

YUMMY!! I really liked this dish! It was easy and tasty. I put frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with the other stuff and cooked on high for 4.5 hours. Also, I only had Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup so I used that...I think it added some nice flavor. When I got home from work I threw in some frozen broccoli florets and shredded the chicken (which was practically falling apart on it's own anyway). Then I cooked on low for an additional 30 minutes while I prepared the rice. I served the shredded chicken, veggies, and sauce over the rice with a little garlic salt sprinkled on top. It was so comforting and easy!!

Super-easy, and surprisingly good considering how simple the recipe is. I added onion flakes (no fresh onion today), canadian chicken seasoning, garlic, canned mushrooms (ran out of fresh) and salt/pepper in addition to the ingredients listed.

Turned out great! I took others' advice and added some Monterey Chicken spice, salt, and pepper. I did add water to it + a can of mushrooms which made it really tasty! At the end I added broccoli and non-fat sour cream. The chicken fell apart and was very tender - but that only made the dish easier to serve.

So easy! I did add some spices to the chicken. I also chopped 2 cloves of garlic and a small onion and added it to the soup mix before pouring. Next time I will add a little water to the soup. Otherwise I thought it turned out great! When it was time to eat I cut the chicken in chunks while in the crock pot and then spooned the mixture over egg noodles. This will definitely be added to the rotation.

This gets five stars because it so EASY and really tasty as well.  I used chicken breast on the bone because its cheaper and then shredded the meat just before serving.  I took the advise from others and used garlic to season the breasts and also added a packet of onion soup mix.  I served it over eggnoodles but really feel it work well with rice or biscuits or even toast.  My four year old who is pretty picky LOVED it which is a huge bonus!

Good - but a little bland.  I added an onion and celery and thought it could still use a little spice.

I thought the flavor was pretty good for crock pot chicken, and I'm not to fond of chicken in the crock pot, it was also easy (which is very important to me). I added seasonings to it that I like and served it with mashed potatoes like the other reviewers had suggested. Good idea. It went well with the potatoes.

This recipe is excellent, although my family loves our food HOT, so I used fresh jalepenos that have been boiled in water and garlic salt instead of canned chilis. Very easy, great for potlucks!

I agree with other reviews....this was very bland..addded Old Bay seasoning for flavor so we could eat it. Even thought the chicken was very moist there was something missing.

Good basic recipe, but much added to it to give it some flavor, salt, pepper, seasonings and such...a cup of chopped celery and some potatoes to round it out to a meal.

This recipe was so simple and really tasty!  My husband and I just loved it!  I made a packet of the Lipton Butter and Herb Fettucini and served the chicken over it.  This would also be great served over mashed potatoes.  The gravy that is created by the soups and sour cream is really great!

This reminds me of the creamy chicken my grandma used to serve to us over a bed of hot rice.  It was quite tasty, I broke up the chicken when I added the sour cream and added one cup of mushrooms to the recipe.  I will probably make this again...

I think 7-8 hours was a little too long to cook the chicken. Once the pot was stirred, it all become mush.  Flavor was okay (I seasoned chicken with garlic salt, pepper and paprika), but texture was not appetizing. Maybe I would try again for a shorter amount of time.

Simple and tasty. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning first. I also sprinkled paprika on top of the soup mixture. Served with rice and veggie. I love slow cooker meals during the work week. Will make again!

this was great but instead of cream of celery soup I used Cream of mushroom soup.  The soup mixture also tastes wonderful served over mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe as it was similar to some others on here and sounded good.  It was certainly not bad.  A little bland.  The chicken was very tender.  I did add a little garlic powder as suggested, but it still needed some more spice of some sort.  Certainly simple and easy with few ingredients...  Maybe just spice it up a tad more or something...

This was wonderful. I only had a whole roasting chicken and no cream of celery soup, so I added cream of mushroom instead and added a little celery seed seasoning to it. The whole roasting chicken made it greasy, but I just poured the grease off, mixed in the sour cream and it was delicious. My kids asked me to definitely make it again-they LOVED the gravy it made and put it over mashed spuds.

This was an absolutely great meal for my family of 4! It was extremely easy and quick! The chicken always ends up extremely tender and juicy. I added some extra seasonings to the chicken and it tasted great! Even my 6 year old and my 1 year old loved it! We will be making this again many times in the future!

I'd highly recommend a starch to go with this recipe. It's good, and I wanted to try it as written. It definitely needs a boost here and there, but it was good. Super easy to put in the slow cooker and return to. Literally, the prep time was no more than 3 minutes, tops.

My husband doesn't like celery, so we didn't have cream of celery soup.  I used cream of mushroom instead and added a can of sliced mushrooms and a generous splash of worcestershire sauce.  Very good.  I recommend serving the gravy over homemade mashed taters.
