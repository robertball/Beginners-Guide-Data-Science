This was tasty, easy and cute.  I admit the first few cookies didn't look so great, but after trying a few different ways of twisting them together, I found one that worked well and I got into a groove.  I just picked up the two rolls and started twisting them with my right hand while holding the left side in place.  After a few twists the whole thing was twisted together and I put it down on the cookie sheet, curved one end and made any necessary adjustments to the twist so they looked nice.
However, I think you'll need more than 2 drops of red food coloring to get the red color in the picture.

These tasted good but it was hard to shape them. I ended up getting frustrated and only made half the batch.

The cookies tasted good but it ended up being a sticky mess.  You must form a small candy cane and spread them apart at least 2 inches for baking.  Mine were formed too big and just blended together in the oven.  I also cut the dough in half, made one red with food coloring and one green.  The made really neat cookies!

These where fun to do with the kids and they were the best tasting cany can cookies I have had.  The only problem I had is they break real easy.

After completing the recipe, I searched for some solutions as my dough did not come out firm enough to twist. After search, I found the original recipe on Betty Crocker's homepage which stated to Soften butter, rather than Melting the butter. They are still delicious, but I found them to be close to impossible to twist like candy canes. Add some crushed up candy canes to the mix though...delicious!
