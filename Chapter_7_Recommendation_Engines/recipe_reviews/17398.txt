Really Good!
I didn't have self-rising flour so I looked up how to convert All Purpose and I found that for each cup of all-purpose flour, you are supposed to decrease the amount by 2 teaspoons and then add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
I sifted the flour first (a good tip to make a lighter cake), and once the mixture was the pans I dropped each pan onto the counter a few times to get out the air, and to prevent the dreaded dome shape.
These took 25 minutes to finish baking in my oven.
They are light and delicious, and a good basic yellow cake recipe for decorating.

I must disagree with some of the other reviewers: this cake came out incredibly moist, and perfect!  I'm a lousy baker(who tries hard)who tends to get dry cakes even with so-called 'foolproof' boxed mixes; I'm not sure why this worked so well, but it's certainly simple, and it was so delicious one of the layers didn't last long enough to be iced--it was devoured by us right out of the oven. I used 2 9" round pans, and that was a perfect fit, too.  We have a 55 year old, tempramental, uneven stove and it took 25 minutes; if I'd used a box or another recipe I'm sure the layers would have been fried-but these were light and fluffy.  Thanks for posting it!

Very rich, moist, and buttery. I beat the butter and sugar together for a good 5 minutes and whipped the egg whites separately  before folding them in. I also added a dash of salt and baking powder to the flour.  The resulting cake was wonderful with or without frosting. A good, basic recipe. I'm by no means an experienced baker, but I was very pleased with the results. I'm keeping this one!
One note of caution - the cake comes out on the heavy side. It is not light and fluffy like the boxed mixes. If you appreciate a thicker, more pound-cake like texture, then you will love it.

This recipe was awesome!  When I made the cake it tasted great, I got nothing but compliments from the 12 people who tasted it.  I served it with buttercream icing.  The cake didn't live to see three days.  I used regular flour instead of self rising, but I just took out 5 teaspoons of flour out and replaced it with 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  It came out great.

Hubs and I agree - this is excellent.  It's quick and simple to mix up but that isn't even its strongest selling point.  It's beautiful, rises nicely, not too sweet, and refreshingly moist for a yellow cake. Supports a rich, sweet frosting well. I made this as cupcakes, baking about 20 minutes, and frosted them with White Cake Frosting II, also from this site. This will, for sure, be one to go back to.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I used it to make cupcakes for my daughter, and the cupcakes all shrunk up after being taken out of the oven.  Beside for that, the flavor was quite bland.
I would much rather use a boxed cake mix (and yes, I used self-rising flour).

I won't be making this again.

DELECTABLE!  This cake was moist, fluffy, and delicious.  I frosted it with chocolate fudge buttercream frosting, and everyone loved it (including me).  It was completely demolished in less than two days!  I am so happy I found this recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I was very enthusiastic about this cake because of the excellent ratings it received.  Since my cakes are always coarse and grainy, I figured even I couldn't ruin this recipe. Initally, it was dry and coarse.  My 2nd try produced a slightly better texture.  On the 3rd try, I switched to the "One bowl, quick method."  I put all my dry ingredients in the bowl first then added the butter and a little liquid;throughly mixed the batter.  Then added the eggs, flavoring and remaining liquid.  That did the trick.  I acheived the texture that I wanted, moist and velvety.  As for the flavor, my family raved over it, even on the 1st two tries when it was coarse and dry.  I thought the flavor was just okay.  It is a good basic cake recipe and I will use it again, though I agree with Susan, it is not the perfect cake recipe.  I will continue my search.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is a keeper.

It was light moist and you can definetely taste the butter. the cake had a nice rich taste and would go well with fresh unsweeteened cream.  it is good enough without any icing.  i added slices of fresh nectarines and buried them through the cake before putting it in the oven.  you can use apricots, plums, peaches or apples.  yum !!!!will be using this cake for a base for  bithday cakes in the future !!!!

Yea!  Finally a cake recipe I can't ruin.  This was so easy and very good.  A tad crumbly but other than that I love it.  The first words out of my husband's mouth was "mmmmmm."  I made a cream cheese chocolate frosting to go on the layers.  So good!  I'll definitately make this again!

A great cake!  It was quite easy to make.  I think that this is probably the recipe to use for beginning bakers, or those who are graduating from cake mixes.  I never use cake mixes, so I'm glad to have a simple recipe like this.

WOW!!! Best yellow cake ever! The key to this recipe is to take your time. It will come out perfect and spongy. I had to bake mine 25 minutes and it took about 35 mins to prepare. The perfection is in following the directions exactly. Be sure to cream your butter and sugar together completely before adding eggs; and as the recipe asks, make sure you fully beat each egg into the mix one at a time. Then I added my milk and vanilla and again beat until completely integrated and smooth. I mixed the flour in by parts and the batter was as smooth as silk. I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they were awesome! Goes great with a simple cream cheese butter cream icing. Warm the icing to a smooth ribbon finish and you can dip the cupcakes in, twirl and remove quickly to create a smooth glaze instead of a thick frosting. It was delicious!!!

If you want to make this cake with two 9" round pans, like I did, just use 3/4ths of the amounts listed and follow the exact same steps of the recipe. I did, and it worked out perfectly.  I was surprised to read so many people tried to make it work with these quantities in two 9" round pans when the recipe states it's for three 8" pans. Sorry for those who had batter overflows making a mess in their ovens!

For convenience, here are the measurements I used:

- 3/4 cup butter
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Although the vanilla wasn't reduced proportionately, the cake still turned out great...very moist and very tasty.  Also notice, I used baking powder and salt in proportions above because I didn't have any self-rising flour. 

In my oven, the cake took 23 minutes to bake.  At 20 minutes, the center wasn't done yet.

I have been using this recipe for over 10 years now and have never had any problems with it. I've used it now on 3 different continents for many different groups of people - it's a little sweet for some non-American tastes, but all in all a wonderful and simple recipe! Thanks!

Yummy cake, although I wouldn't call it a yellow cake.  I'm not sure what I would call it, though.  I was out of regular milk, so I used buttermilk - oh my!  This was a very light, tender moist cake.  The flavor is marvelous - my co-workers raved, and that was without any frosting!  Several people said it was just like their grandma used to make.  We're in the South, so you kow that's a compliment!  This would be perfect with fresh berries, icecream or custard.  I think any frosting other than a glaze might overpower the delicate nature of the cake.

I did some experimental baking with this yesterday in preparation for creation of a wedding cake.   This is a wonderfully moist creation, and it couldn't be simpler.  I can't eat it due to a food intolerance, but my husband, who is NOT a cake person, couldn't stay away from it, even without frosting.  It had a perfect crumb and smelled heavenly.

The recipe, as written, is perfect for on 6" and one 8" layer.  When doubled, it will create one each of a 6", 8" and 10" pan.  When tripled, it will create one each of a 6", 8", 10" and 12" pan.  This will definitely be my wedding cake for the coming weekend.

This cake batter turned into a very moist, rich, buttery and delicious cake. It did turn out a little more like a pound cake but was perfect like that. I added apples and cinnamon to the batter before baking and it did not even need any icing...very, very good cake!!

very moist- but also very crumbly! When i tried to take it out of the pans, one cracked in half, one cracked in quarters, and one had a big hole in the middle! Will make again, but with my own adjustments.

I've made this recipe a few times, using all purpose flour and following the suggestion to use 2 less teaspoon flour and adding 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt for each cup of flour. It was pretty good. Then the other day, I decided to try doing the same thing using cake flour, and it was the best cake I've ever made. I don't think I'm ever going to look for another yellow cake recipe again. Thanks!

This was a great and easy-to-make cake--I frosted it with Strawberry frosting and cut strawberries between the layers and got many compliments.  For the one reviewer who didn't like the cake, did you make sure to use self-rising flour?  I almost missed this point, but caught it in time to add the baking powder and salt to regular flour--this is definitely a keeper recipe.

Okay, it really is impossible to mess this cake up. 
I promised to make a cake for my boyfriend's father for his birthday. If that isn't pressure i don't know what is. 
I made a french vanilla layer cake with french vanilla frosting. I used this cake, and added McCormick french vanilla blend in place of vanilla extract. 
I added vanilla pudding mix to keep it moist, and accidentally added a whole extra cup of milk. 
I didn't realize my mistake until I was wondering why, after 30 full minutes, the stupid cake was still not firm! 
It took a whole 50 minutes to cook, but finally it did cook and it was still perfectly delicious! 
The vanilla pudding mix and french vanilla blend complimented this cake perfectly, and was delicious.

I was very disappointed in this cake.  It seemed to have a texture that reminded me of cornbread.  I believe the problem is the excess baking powder used in self-rising flour.  Using cake flour with the same amount of baking powder yields similiar results.  I'll stick with my own recipe which uses only 1 tsp baking soda and has a higher moisture to flour ratio.  I am giving it two stars because some of my co-workers seemed to like it despite the texture.

This is a really yummy yellow cake!  I've been looking for a homemade yellow cake recipe and after trying a recipe from one of my favorite TV cooks, and I was extremely disappointed.  This is moist, just like it says. I made this with crushed up Reese's Pieces (as per my boyfriend's request) and it is just delicious.  I'm coming back to this one.

Tried this last night came out very well but I wanted a lemon cake. I substituted vanilla extract for lemon. And if I had thought about lemon zest should have gone in too.  But all in all the cake baked beautifully and yes smacking the pans before putting them in the oven will prevent the domes of doom. And I'd have to disagree with everyone about the two 9" cake pans I used them and it didn't overflow came close but my pans held It I'm thinking I must have deeper pans.

Thank you for this recipe. This is the first homemade cake I've made in I-don't-know-how-long. It was almost as quick, and much more economical than a box mix. I just took it out of the oven, and it's so good and moist. 

No more mixes for me. I'm going to use this recipe again, and proudly say I made it from SCRATCH!

4.16.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17398/grandmas-moist-cake/ ... 'Still in the oven ... 'Has to be 1 tsp vanilla, right?  Maybe 1.5 tsp. Uncooked batter looked "normal." In the oven, not - bumpy around the pan edges, small bubbles in the middle  I hope I haven't dirtied three cake pans, mixing bowl & beaters for nothing.  This is an odd little cake!  It doesn't brown like a regular cake.  It looks underdone, but it isn't.  'Has a little sugar edge that sticks to the pan, which means too much sugar.  This is not a typical cake.  It's too lightcolored & textured.  'Still haven't tried it, it's cooling; but it's reminding me of a mix - too fluffy, too sweet - by appearance anyway.  Tried it & this is a sponge cake.  That's why it doesn't brown too much more than the inside.  It made pretty layers (with there being little variation in color & size).  The dry "thing": It will be dry if you bake it waiting for it to brown & yes, it could use more butter/shortening/oil considering there are 3 layers (or extralarge eggs will dry, too). 'Made this to use up a large amount of frosting.  It did, but the cake wasn't anything special - except to look at. One more note:  K said she liked it - except that it had too much frosting.  :/

Ok...this was not at all moist. This was extremely dry. I was hoping that because it was so simple to make that it would've tasted yummy. But it didn't. Won't be making this again. :\

Absolutely delicious cake!  Warning:  I followed a recommendation that two 9" cake pans would work just as well...batter all over the oven; I don't recommend it.

This is the second time I've used this recipe and the cake has turned out great both times.  It's pretty easy to make and tastes much better than the box mixes.

This cake was PERFECT!  So light and fluffy, moist and not too sweet.  I made cupcakes with this recipe, and they turned out wonderfully!  I did sift the flour, so maybe that helped my results.  SO much better than a box cake!  Everyone raved!

Do not use 2 9" pans!  I did that and they overflowed - huge mess in the oven!  Otherwise, the cake was very good.

I just made this cake.  I thought the recipe looked very familiar to me so I compared it to a family recipe that I have had for over 45 years. I was so curious, I just had to bake it to compare the two. I totally agree with the reviewer who said she would not call this a "Yellow" cake.  It is definitely "NOT" your typical "Yellow" cake. It is actually a "Sponge" cake. It is very similiar to the recipe I have had for 45 years: "Lou Ella's 150+ Year Old Sponge Cake", and my recipe is truly over 150 years old too! There are just very minor differences between the two recipes. However, the texture and the tastes are very similar.  "Lou Ella's 150+ Year Old Sponge Cake" does have this one beat a bit as far as taste is concerned (I have had strangers call me up and beg me for the recipe once they have tasted it at a gathering or so). But the two are very similar. This is one you could share with others (if you are one that likes to keep your special recipes to yourself)in place of let's say "Lou Ella's 150+ Year Old Sponge Cake. The thing to remember is this is a "Sponge" cake and not a regular "Yellow" cake - the texture will be more coarse then a regular "Yellow" cake - but the taste is exceptional.  One can eat it alone, like cornbread, one doesn't even need to ice the cake.  I use "Lou Ella's Cake" as a Strawberry Shortcake in the summers - this one can be used for that too.  Just put the batter in a 9" x 13" pan.  Put your strawberries in their juices on top of the cake after

I baked it in 2 - 9" pans.  Big mistake - it rose a lot (and spilled onto my oven floor!)  Mine turned out a tad crumbly and not as moist as I'd expected.  I didn't like the taste enough to make it again according to the directions.  (I think it was just too buttery-tasting for me.)

This cake was so delicious. Rich, moist, homemade flavor and texture. This mixed up quickly in 1 bowl. I made a sheet cake with this. I used egg beaters instead of whole eggs. This is a great recipe, I'm so glad you shared Grandma's cake with us. Thanks!

delicious!  This was my first time making a cake from scratch.  The taste was AMAZING.  **HOWEVER**, I wish I had known just how much it would rise.  It overflowed and got all over the oven.

This is a very easy cake but what a good flavor! I had to bake it longer than 20 mins-more like 27-30 in order for it to set in the center. I added a buttercream frosting and mmmmm-even better the next day with a glass of milk. Also, I made it with egg substitute and skim milk and it was still delicious!

Finally!  The yellow cake recipe I've been searching (and searching) for!  It's moist, light, and buttery tasting.  I used two 9" pans instead of three 8".  Don't overbake and make sure to use the self-rising flour.  I'll be making this one again and again!

I was hesitant to try this recipe.  With the short list of ingredients how could it taste like a made from scratch cake that I wanted to serve to at the office to celebrate a co-worker's birthday?  The coworker requested yellow cake with chocolate frosting.  It seemed like such a simple and plain request and I was hoping to make something a little more elaborate.  I am very glad I tried this recipe.  The flavor was wonderful although I think it tasted more like a vanilla cake than the normal yellow cake.  It was moist and delicious and I received many compliments.  I will definitely make this recipe again and will experiment using other icing flavors with it in the future.

I was nervous about using self rising flour as a leavener for the cake, but it came out surprisingly well. The cake was moist and fluffy and had a nice vanilla flavor. I definitely recommend it.

So moist and good. I added a baked beet that I had. I blended the beet with the milk and added it to the cake. It came out soooo good. Looked like a red velvet cake with natural food coloring. And the beet added a special taaste. LOVE IT!

I was looking for a yellow cake to go with a great chocolate frosting that I got from this site and I didn't have self-rising flour so I took a review from (Jessica) for self-rising flour and me and my family feel that it was to much salt. So I have to make again using the correct measurement for self-rising flour...looking for 5 stars.

Moist, yes.  Good, NO.  This cake taste similar to cornbread or something to that effect. It also stuck to the pan. Easy but I did not like this at all. It was crumbly and too buttery unlike a butter pound cake.

I made this cake yesterday and it was terrific! Everyone loved it. The texture and flavor were great. I made this with lemon creme cheese frosting, which was good but much too sweet. The cake itself was divine:-)  I will definitely make this again, but will use a lighter fluffy whip creamish type of frosting.

I like this cake because it is a fool proof cake; its easy, always moist and always fluffy.  I find the taste a little lacking but everyone else loves it, even my finicky teenage daughter.  It's is also very versitile I have used it with buttercream frosting, lemon frosting, and chocolate frosting.  

It is a must have in a baker's arsenal.

This is a great recipe for a yellow cake!  This is similar to my recipe, but I add yellow food coloring and buttermilk.  I cream butter/sugar a little longer and I also add 1 tsp of baking powder. You can iced the cake with your choice of icing.

This was alright. I made it in a bundt pan. I was too busy to frost it, which made the kids mad. It was a little too sweet and much more like a pound cake as someone else mentioned. I am looking for something lighter. Don't think I will make this again.

This cake was really goood and pretty easy; I added a teaspoon of butter flavoring and I sprinkled my cake pans with sugar instead of flour after greasing them.  I had to bake the cake longer than the 15 - 20 minutes recommended in the recipe, but I loved it!!  I've been looking for a basic yellow cake receipe that's easy and good, I found it!!  I mixed a container of chocolate frosting with whipped cream for my frosting, the consistency was just a little runny, just a little, but it tasted great.
Delicious!

This cake turned out pretty good.  It was not as moist as I had hoped, but I baked it in a 9 by 13 pan instead of making layers, so it had to bake a lot longer than the recipe called for.  I will use this reciped again.  Really good flavor.

I've been making this recipe for many years now.  I've had a few blunders (all my fault, thinking the batter was too thick and adding more milk).  But when I follow the recipe properly, we usually get a great cake.  We keep coming back to this recipe for the buttery taste.  We've made strawberry shortcake, Boston cream pie, and many chocolate buttercream versions.  Love that it's almost as simple as  making a cake mix without the ingredients I don't want.

The cake is amazing!!!  Used it to make mini cupcakes and they were perfect! Made approximately 120 mini cupcakes.  In an electric oven bake at 325 degrees for 13 minutes. Did not change a thing!

I did 2 1/2 sticks of butter and 1 1/4 cup of milk and it made it have more moisture. Other than that, it is a good recipe.

I have a bakery and always look for new recipes just for fun. Made this for a dinner party i was having one night and it was very nice. Light and fluffy texture and great flavor. i doubled the vanilla just because i always do. my cupcakes didn't get that nice little rise in the middle but they didn't sink. might add a little more rising agent for cupcakes but would love it if the cakes stay level and don't rise in the middle! overall this is a GREAT easy recipe!

Great recipe. It is rich and moist. I didn't have enough white sugar so I used three fourths brown sugar as a substitute. I baked it in one "9" springform pan for about 70 minutes, lowered the temp to 340 for the last half hour and it turned out great. The brown sugar made it taste like toffee. Yum!

Tried this recipe. Mixed it all by hand as don't have an electric mixer at the moment and it still came out light and moist.  I reduced the sugar a little but could have made it a whole half cup less. I thought the mixture was rather runny when I used all the milk mixture but resisted the temptation to add more flour (thank goodness). Will definitely return to this recipe again. Thank you.

I try to follow a new recipe by the directions to at least see how it turns out. I did add a pinch of salt to the recipe, as I was taught by my grandmother to do this since I was a Child.  This cake is extremely moist and easy to frost and decorate-it is a keeper in my recipe box now!

I don't eat cake a lot, but really, this is likely the best base cake I've had taste wise.  It's a little dense...but I think I need to sift the flour next time.  I used a 15x11" glass pan with success, but had to extend the baking time to almost 40min.  It's a forgiving recipe.  I used it with a pudding poke cake recipe on this site.  I will continue using this recipe anytime it calls for yellow or white prepared cake (no idea what the difference is).

The cake recipe was fairly good. I would recommend using 3 eggs instead of 4, however, because it comes out veeeeeery spongy in the too-much-egg-makes-the-cake-rubbery sort of way. The flavor was a little lacking, but an extra bit of vanilla extract helped that by a long shot.

I am not sure what went wrong. I chose this recipe do to the positive reviews. I followed everything to the T but the middle of my cake sank?

I live in CA so high altitude is not he issue. My self rising flour was new. The only thing I can think of is perhaps I could have over beaten the eggs and sugar? I used a small hand held mixer. 

Can one of you bakers shed some light on what the heck went wrong? Thanks in advanced.

I would like to bake a cake like the box method. That would be ideal!

This cake tasted fine, and it was not crumbly, however it fell in the center as soon as I opened the oven at 20 minutes, and wasn't nearly done.  I had to use all 3 layers just to equal the height of 1, and there was a lot of waste from trimming off the edges to make them level. I may try it again, leaving it to bake for 25 minutes without checking on it, but it is not one of my favorites.

I am NOT a cake person.  I usually eat the frosting and discard the cake!  But I decorate cakes for birthdays/showers etc, so I have looked for and tried countless basic cake recipes.  This cake is so good that even I like the taste!  Super recipe.  (Note: I used shortening instead of butter without any problems.)

Good tasting cake, but not moist at all. It is more dry and crumbly than I expected.  The problem is that the recipe calls for all butter, not a butter/oil combo.

I followed the directions as given except that I used all purpose flour (plus salt and baking soda) and I used a bundt pan.  The cake baked for about 33 minutes, it had started to pull away from the side of the pan just a tiny bit. I cooled it on a cooling rack for 5-10 min and then flipped it out, only a tiny section stuck.   Overall, the cake tastes good! I feel it is more of a sponge cake than a yellow cake. It is very moist, so moist it breaks apart when cutting the cake. The cake does not need frosting, but we covered it in chocolate ganache anyway, which was a very yummy :-)   Overall, nice cake recipe! I would make it again, the kids really liked it.

This cake was really simple to make and I keep all of this on hand.  I actually had said this wasnt the best cake, but after it being in the kitchen, it is the only cake that has been completely eaten in our house.

Ok.  I had to adjust this just a bit for high altitude.  I added 1 T of milk and raised the temp to 375.  Otherwise, I made it per the recipe.  This was very good, but SOOO sweet!  Too sweet, I think.  The next time I make it, I will cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 C.

My daughter made this by herself for dad's b-day. Fantastic cake. She used cake flour and added a bit of salt and baking powder. Seemed a bit sweet might cut down on sugar a little. Excellent with Chcoolate Fudge Buttercream recipe. Neighbors loved it will use again and make it a choclate cake or banana cake!! THANKS!!!!

I made this cake and I didn't change anything. I used it for a strawberry shortcake, it turned out great and did not dry out in the fridge. My sister called me a cake genius. It does remind me more of a sponge cake though. It's very light and tastes great.

I just made this cake, and I like it... mostly.  I didn't have an self-rising flour, so I used the substitute, however, the cake still rose very little.  The two layers I made were very flat (I used 9" pans), which is a shame because so many ingredients went into the cake.  However, the scraps that I've tasted are yummy and it smells good, so I hope that the flatness is my only problem.  I am disappointed by the height, though.

I'm a teenager and even I (a novice baker!) can bake this cake PERFECTLY! The only thing is wrong about this recipe is the timing. I'm baking using a conventional oven and I have to bake the cake for 45 minutes before the cake was baked nicely. This is the second cake I managed to bake perfectly.

I made this recipe today and will definitely make again.  It is a bit on the sweet side, so next time I will add less sugar.  I did as Eva said, since I had no self rising flour and it did work.

I really thought this was really good. I made cupcakes with it for my 1 year old's birthday and then put the leftover batter in a pan that was too small for that much batter but thankfully even that came out fantastic (it was a very tall pan). The cupcakes didn't rise on top (they flattened out) but the taste of both the cake and cupcakes was really really good!

This cake was fantastic served warm out of the oven. I topped it with a chocolate glaze made out of sugar, cocoa, and butter. We ate over half of the cake before it even had a chance to cool. The cake was still good the next day, but it was not as moist. I will make this again because it was good and simple. Perfect for those last minute dinner parties. You always have the ingredients on hand and it is best hot out of the stove.

This was OK. Not great. The boxed is better. I follwed it exactly.  I did slightly overcook it as at 25 minutes it still seemed wet. Might try again and cook for less time. The taste is just OK.

I really love this recipe and everyone else does too, even others who say they don't usually like cake. I made just as is and it doesn't fill three 8 inch pans for me; I fill 2. I have 8x2 pans so I am thinking she uses 8x1 pans.

Great cake if your looking for a simple vanilla flavor! I did only use 1 1/2 cups sugar, and substituted a mixture of all-purpose flour/baking powder/salt for the self-rising flour. I made this into a 3 tier, 6-inch "pony/unicorn" style cake for a friend's daughter's b-day, and they loved it! It stayed moist and has great vanilla flavor! Thanks for the recipe, I will use it again!

This is the best yellow cake I've ever been able to make. I followed the recipe to a tee and the cake didn't come out too dense at all. It was moist and as light as an egg yolk cake can be. I cut the recipe in half and it made 12 heaping cupcakes.

This recipe is easy and amazing and actually make me feel like I might be able to successfully bake finally! I made this recipe into cupcakes and the only issue I had was that they came out a bit dry. I don't think it was due to the recipe in itself, but instead was due to my not watching them bake closely enough and accidentally over baking just a tad bit. They were still amazing and I will try another batch tonight with better oversight.

I used this cake to make my own wedding cake. It is absolutely delicious! So moist, perfectly dense to stack three cakes on top of each other. Definitely a keeper. I made no changes to the recipe.

This was really good! I managed to make it more dense and moist by using a loaf pan (in which case I had to cook  5-10 minutes longer than 20 minutes to thoroughly cook the wet middle (which I pricked with a fork halfway through). The only complaint was that it was a tad bit too sweet, so I'll have to use less sugar next time. Other than that, this is an excellent and easy cake!

Very nice moist cake. I almost didn't make it because of some negative comments. Will definitely be making it again.i added an extra egg yolk because some people found it to be dry but seems it wasn't necessary. Brushed syrup on top as soon as I removed it from the oven

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He wanted a yellow cake with peanut butter frosting. I though the cake was very dry. He said it was good that it reminded him of pound cake. I followed the directions completely. I bake alot. The cake took alot  longer than 20 minutes to cook. I will not make this cake again.

love this cake.  The first time I made it with peanut butter frosting between the layers and chocolate fudge on the outside.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I looked up the substitution, and I also routinely replace some of the flour with whole wheat white flour (maybe 3/4 cup) just to feel slightly less guilty.  Everyone was fighting over the last few bites.  It was that good.

The family loves it! It's really soft, moist and easy & fast to prepare.

I've to bake it for about 24 mins at 170 deg C. I've used a little less butter. I googled that 1 cup butter is 227g and I used close to 200g, not more, instead just to play safe. Perhaps next time will use a little less sugar cos family finds it a little sweet.

Will bake again for sure... Thanks for the recipe : )

This cake turned out beautifully! It almost tasted like a classic sugar cookie but with a fluffy cake texture - yum! I didn't have self-rising flour so I made the necessary substitutions like some other reviewers did. I also followed the advice to bang the cake pans before putting them into the oven to avoid the dome shape. My daughter's ballerina birthday cake was a hit! (Reviewer suggestions referred to: Eva Amber)

I used the previous commenters tip for subbing all-purpose flour, salt and baking powder. Came out great...now to decide which frosting will go best with it!

I did not have self -rising flour so I converted my All Purpose flour.  The cake did end up falling a little.  The cake was very delicious and moist, everyone thought that it was good!! I will make this cake again, but with self-rising flour.

Love this recipe!!  I left an 8" pan of this cake on my counter without icing, my husband has been creeping through the house eating it all by himself, keeping it covered so no one else will eat any.  Very moist and fluffy.  I will add this recipe to my collection.

Delicious!  Made this recipe as is, except I used all purpose flour instead.  It is moist, buttery, and dense.  In total, it made 24 mini cupcakes and 8 medium cupcakes.  This recipe does not rise so fill the cupcakes up to the top of the liner.  Baking time was correct as well.  I wouldn't change anything.

Followed the directions as written--very moist and delicious. I did not understand the comments about not needing frosting until I tasted it--they are right. I made cupcakes but ran out of liners; the cupcakes without liners were hard to remove even though I sprayed the pans liberally with Pam. The cupcakes that rose too much also stuck to the top of the pan--make sure to only fill around 2/3. If I were to make the cakes in bigger pans I would use parchment.

I used dark coffee and walnut extract instead of milk and vanilla. The cake was moist,and buttery. we used fleishmens (spelling?) 70% less cholesterol butter sticks. I also used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup stevia instead of 2 cups sugar.We blend our regular sugar with stevia in equal parts. It still tastes like sugar but we are cutting our sugar intake in half! The cake was tender,I think because of creaming the butter and sugar well and adding eggs slowly.We are picky eaters and we loved it! I will make this same cake in many different flavors in the years to come.

My cake turned out OK. The batter tasted SOOO GOOD, I was expecting the baked version to taste better than it did. My cake was a little grainy (?) and just didn't taste like much. Very light, fluffy, and crumbly.  I wonder if adding a box of pudding mix would help make it more flavorful and just a bit more dense.

I absolutely love this cake!!!! I got this tip from a navy cook to add Greek yogurt to get it even more moist (I added a small $1 cup from Wal-Mart). I was so surprised because I struggle in the kitchen.

Very tasty and moist cake.  I used regular flour and just added the baking powder and salt.  I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar since I don't like my cakes super sweet and I added orange zest to the mix. I have dozens of tried cake recipes in my files and I will be adding this one for sure!

Absolutely love this recipe!  It's simple but produces a lovely,  buttery, VERY moist & delicious cake. I'm a cake designer and I have tried lots of recipes and this is my new "go to" yellow cake recipe. Not only is it delicious but it is nice and sturdy and will hold up to fondant nicely.  I paired it with a small amount of my whipped buttercream icing and fresh strawberry filling. (But great without icing as well)  Perfect! My Thanks to Grandma!

I tried this recipe as a cupcake and unfortunately with it being in my oven for about 5 to 7 minutes they ended up burning on the outside of the cupcake. Wish I could give this recipe a zero but there is no option for that. I followed the directions to the exact and the burning was the end result.

I loved how simple it was to put together the ingredients. However, for some odd reason my butter melted and it was barely softened and the batter became watery. Maybe it's my location not sure or my kitchen aid. However the taste was there and they ended up coming out okay and will try again.

It was ok. Reminded me of cornbread more than cake. The Batter's consistency was more like cookies than a cake. I probably won't make again.

I used regular flour and forgot to add the salt and baking powder. The result was a delicious cake with a sponge like texture. It wasn't as moist as I was expecting, but I baked it in cupcake pans and for longer than the recipe stated because they just didn't seem done. I'm sure this is because they were denser than they were supposed to be due to my lack of leavening. They were a huge hit. I am about to make them again, this time adding baking powder and salt. I'm expecting a delicious result!

This is an excellent cake recipe! It mixes weird but cooks up great! I did notice that in my 6" rounds there was a weird divot, about the size of a half dollar, in the bottom of all of them. I don't know if this was a baker issue or a recipe issue but nothing I can't work with.  Plus it taste fantastic!

Mine turned out as sort of a cornbread/cake concoction in taste. Other than that, it was fluffy and fairly moist (though, it is quite delicate, so careful when handling)

If you follow the instructions carefully this is an amazing cake.  It is moist, easy to make and very tasty.  My "icing" consisted of 2 packets frozen coconut, 2 cups sour cream and 2 cups sugar.  Mix together and keep in fridge at least for four hours and put in between layers and on top of cake and let it stand in fridge for about 3 days and enjoy.  I made four separate layers of cake.  When my daughter tasted the cake she said:  ' Mom, I cannot believe that anyone would not like this cake.  I am sure they did not follow the instructions'.

This cake was great I was a little worried after some of the reviews, but we loved it. I will be making this again...i did have to cook a little longer since I used my bundt pan and it was enough batter to do the bundt pan and a 8 inch pan which was great I just sent one to my parents. great recipe!

This was a good, basic yellow cake mix.  I halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes.  I served with a chocolate cream cheese frosting which overpowered the cake.  I think a plain chocolate frosting would go better with this cake.

This was an incredibly moist cake, I substituted lactose free milk and Mexican vanilla. I made one 10 inch cake and about 9 cupcakes. This cake does not rise alot, it stays pretty flat, so it didn't work for cupcakes, but I would definitely recommend this cake for layered cakes. It has a high sugar/fat ratio therefore it kinda formed a crust, it browns quickly.

Can't think of a better yellow cake recipe. The only change I made was to make my own self-rising flour using Eva Amber's recipe (found above in her review).

This cake is fantastic!  My kids and I made it and they loved it.  I did do a few things differently that was recommended by a viewer (Mandy W) in another yellow cake recipe.  She recommended using cake flour and when you measure it, sift the flour into the measuring cup and then level it off (this makes the cake more dense).  She then also suggested creaming the butter, sugar & flour together then pour in the milk/egg mixture.  Also the cold ingredients should be at room temp when using.  I din't have cake flour so I looked up how to substitute it, and it says to every 1 cup of cake flour, use 1 cup of unbleached plain (all purpose) flour and then take 2 tablespoons out.  I also ended up baking the cake in 2 round tins and freezing one. I also had a little trouble with timing too, I think because I only used 2 cake tins, so it took longer than the 15-20mins stated.  I also left it plain as it didn't need icing.  It came out moist and dense, just as I was hoping. I may try it using self raising flour next time to compare the difference.  Will definitely bake again and am even thinking of using this for my sons birthday cake.  Thank you for a great recipe :)

This is an excellent recipe. Cake mixes can't produce the texture and flavor of a made-from-scratch cake, and when I find a recipe I love, I hang on to it. It was easily made, a boon for a busy homemaker, and it can be made as festive as desired. I used it as a base for a trifle-like dessert, but the parts that didn't go into the trifle were quickly snapped up. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this cake with cake flour and added baking soda and salt to make it self rising.  I didn't have three 8 inch pans, so I used three 9 inch pans.  The cake was very moist, but kind of coarse, which I hear is normal for cake from scratch instead of from a box.  Maybe it just takes a while to get used to that texture.

This cake was ok. No need to add baking powder or salt when a recipe calls for self rising flour.. It already has it in the flour, and too much can ruin a cake.

I was looking for a yellow cake like Duncan Hines and I found this one.  Though this cake is not yellow, it is an excellent pound cake!  I have made this cake four times already and it was a success everytime.  I served two ways: 1.)pounnd cake and 2.)layered with chocolate buttercream frosting

The flavor was a little less sweet than I prefer, but ok. It took much longer to set in the middle and cook thoroughly so I was a little disappointed, but overall it was ok... not great. Maybe it's my oven?

This was good, though it turned out more like a pound cake than a moist yellow layer cake.  I made one 9 inch round and we ate it plain and with fruit.

Was heavy and basically tasteless. My 3 year old, 1 year old and husband wouldn't eat it. Was moist though. Needed baking soda or powder...I get the two mixed up, and more butter or something. I followed recipe to a tee and the cake is inedible.

I was looking for a simple yellow cake...to use with my grandmothers chocolate syrup cake. I came across this one. After making the cake....we never got to the syrup...This is the best tasting cake ever. As far as making it in a 13x9 pan...it turned out just as good. Just have to watch the top but other than that....EXCELLANT

Wonderful recipe! This has totally helped me regain my baking confidence after the 
disasterous "strawberry cream cake" recipe at epicurious.com! I suggest subtracting about
a tablespoonor two of sugar it calls for but other then that..this is simply heavenly!
Easy buttery fluffy delicate texture and fun to make too! dont wait for the tops of this cake
to brown if u are making cupcakes or else u will burn it!
