This recipe was passed down from my grandmother to my mother, then to me. It does never fail. One thing you should know is that you can over mix the dough at the end. So just mix just until incorporated. This dough is also very good in pot pies. You can cut out large sized cookie rounds, bake them, and top off a stew or soup of your choice. I make these ahead of time and freeze them. It keeps the calories down and you don't have soggy dough in the bottom of the bowl.

Never Fail is the only recipe I use. However I use 5 cups flour, 2tsps. salt, 2 cups butter flavor Crisco. Mix. In a cup measure 1 beaten egg, 1 TBLS white vinegar and fill with water to one cup. Makes enough for 6 crusts. Divide and freeze. I always roll between plastic wrap. Using extra flour when rolling is not a problem.

I always use this recipe now. I like to refrigerate it for a little while before rolling it out because it's so much easier to handle. Thanks!

This is the Holy Grail of pie crust!!  I have been trying for years to make a pie crust and always end up with a patch work of dough.  This was easy, I have made 4 pies and each turned out perfect.  The crust is flaky.  Who would have ever thought-wax paper!  No mess no fuss. If you have given up on making pie, try this,I am sending this recipe to everyone I can think of.  Thank you Susan

I had a terrible time with this crust. Based on the other reviews, it looked like the answer to my pie crust prayers. It mixed well and rolled out beautifully but stuck to the waxed paper and fell apart as I tried to get it into the pie plate. I had to patch it together. When it baked, it had an odd texture and appearance. Sorry, but I'll just keep looking for that "never fail" recipe. And there's always Pillsbury for a stand-by.

This recipe is very similar to the one my mother-in-law gave me.  I will never use any other.  This is so easy and delicious.  I have used this for Apple pies to Lemon Meringue pies.  This is a can't kill crust.

This pie crust was very easy to make.  However, I didn't feel it had enough flavor.  I'm going to try a little more salt next time.

I gave this recipe every benefit of the doubt. Made it three times and all three times it fell apart-the dough was sticky and wet and never came together. I made it with very cold shortening-the second time I made it with very cold butter, I left it in the fridge over night, I left it in the fridge for a few hours, I tried everything-but this is an all fail pie recipe to me.

I was looking for a pie dough recipe with vinegar.  I did not like the flavor of this crust at all.  After comparing it to several other recipes (after I tried the pie), it seems to have about 1/2 cup too much shortening.

Maybe it's just me, but doesn't anyone else have a problem with the wet ingredients curdling? I've been baking for 35 years but can't get this one to work.

This is almost exactly the recipe my mother uses!  Everyone always loves her pies.  The only difference is that she uses 1 1/4 cups shortening instead of 1 1/2 cups.

Yep, this is one I have used a lot over the years.  The only thing I do differently is I roll it out on a well-floured flour-sack towel and dust my rolling pin a little.  Works great!

Handed down from my mother in law.   Old family recipe... Have used this since 1971.   This is fail proof.  Be sure to use a pastry blender (wooden handle on top... With half round blades below)  to cut crisco and flour mixture together. ( they are inexpensive and can be bought at Walmart / K mart etc)  
After mixing in the remaining ingredients, I lightly flour the bottom piece of waxed paper (dampen countertop,  and then lay down the first piece of wax paper. This keeps the wax paper from sliding around). I then take 1/2  of the round ball of dough and flour lightly.   Flatten slightly by hand and lay on the wax paper. Top with second piece of wax paper. The next trick if you will is to invest in a rolling pin that has ball bearings, which allows the rolling pin to flow freely. (again this is a great investment you won't regret). Roll out dough from the center in all four directions to the size you need.   When done I peel the top layer of wax paper off, while it is still on the counter. Again flour the crust very slightly. You should be able to pick up the crust, with the bottom layer of wax paper still attached. It is very soft, pliable and easy to handle. Then I flip it over on top of the pie plate and center. Gently peel the wax paper and push down Into the pie plate. Repeat for the top crust as well.  You will have adequate pastry to work with and can use the trimmings leftover to

There was something about using the vinegar and then allowing the dough to refrigerate overnight that it rolled out easier than any other crust I have tried.  I believe the acidity improves the dough's ease of rolling out.

I found this recipe to be a bit tender to work with, even after chilling it in the fridge for 24 hours.  The pie I was making called for the crust to be double in thickness, so I used the whole recipe for one pie shell.  I think that if I'd tried to roll the dough any thinner I would have had a mess on my hands.  That being said, it did bake up to be very flaky and the flavor was not bad.  I took a cue from one of the other reviews and used butter flavored shortening and I think that was a good idea.  I can't say that I will use this recipe again.

My mother's recipe was similar but only had 1 c. shortening which would lower the fat content. I keep back about 1 T. water to add (if needed) to the crumbs left in the bottom of the bowl. This recipe makes 3 crusts with scraps left to bake topped with a little cinnamon & sugar for a snack right away.

This is a good flaky pie crust but too greasy, and there wasn't really enough dough for two double crust pies. Next time I will add an additional cup of flour and maybe a little more water as needed. I like a little butter in my pie crust so I used 1 cup of shortening plus 1/2 cup of butter.

I love this recipe...It is my go to pie crust recipe.... I refrigerated my shortening before cutting it into my flour mixture...depending on humidity levels I either used or omitted the 1/2 tbsp water. Other than that this is a keeper...

I've made lots of pie crusts but I have to say that I will always use this one. It's perfect. The pie crust is always flaky and  I've yet to be disappointed. Definitely 5 stars.

Flaky, great taste and does not crumble.  I used parchment paper with my rolling pin.  Butter flavored Crisco gave it an added taste.  Loved it.

I’ve never made a crust until yesterday when I tried this recipe.  I’ve always heard how difficult crusts are, and that I should just buy a crust. Well, I’m glad I didn’t listen in this case (although I have many times before). I made a lemon meringue pie with this crust, using butter flavored Crisco for the shortening.  It turned out beautifully, people raved about the pie.  To make sure they weren’t just being polite, I tried it myself.  It was wonderful.  Great crust, the only one I’ll ever use.

Whipped this up to use for a chicken pot pie ...came out flaky and delicious! Makes enough for top and bottom crust.

Oh my goodness, I should have listened to the other reviewers about how bad this tasted. They were right, the flavor was terrible. I think it has to do with putting an entire tablespoon of vinegar in.

My mother made this recipe for years and when she shared this recipe some people would say it did not turn out as nice as hers. She always said the trick was using lard not shortening.

Delicious and so flakey!  I did use a gluten free flour blend so it was a little bit tricky to work with....but that isn't the recipe's fault...just the nature of the beast with gfree baking. My husband, who doesn't like any pie crust LOVED this one. Will use this recipe again for sure!

It was fine until I tried rolling it between the wax paper. It stuck to the wax paper and was difficult to maneuver. Next time I'll add flour to the wax paper. When I flipped it the crust got mangled. Despite all of this it tastes GREAT!!

Used 1 cup Criso shortening and added 1/2 cup solid coconut oil, mixed in food processor. After adding water, vinegar, and egg it was consistency of pudding, added additional 1 cup flour , but didn't help.

My 9-year old stepdaughter attended a pie making workshop for 4-H and this was the recipe they used.  Her pie crust came out flaky and tender.  It was really good!  If a 9-year old can make this, anybody can, right?  :)  I've since made it and found it to be not elastic AT ALL and tears easily.  I divided the dough in half (instead of thirds) because I wouldn't have been able to roll it out big enough for the bottom crust.

I am one big chicken when it comes to pie crust--had to throw too many away.  This had nice texture, easy to work with.  I dont think I cut shortening/butter into flour long enough;could see white when puttin dough into pie plate, but, was too afraid I would turn dough into rock if I overworked it.  Hope it tastes good--I'm just thrilled I did it.  This recipe makes 2 pie crusts--didnt mention it in instructions.

This recipe was given to me over 30 years ago  by my grandma.  She used lard as the shortening and I do too.  It makes the flakiest pie crust ever.

Have been using this recipe for years. The only changes I made is using half whole wheat flour and replacing 1/2 cup of shortening with one stick of frozen butter. Makes a nutty flavor and a tender, flakey crust

I added another cup of flour, only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and also added 1 teaspoon of sugar.  Much better!

I have never cooked a pie from scratch. I used this my first time and it turned out great. I don't know if there is better one but, this one was easy for me. I smoothed it out with wet hands when I put it in the pie pan.

Terific recipe! Have used it for years, the only difference being that I use 6 T. water instead of 5 1/2. It really makes three generous crusts. I chill the three balls in sandwich bags, then roll between wax papers or freeze. Never fails!!!

The pastry came out nice and flaky.  I prefer to add the liquid a little at a time so I mixed in the egg and vinegar before adding the water.  I thought it had enough liquid and didn't add any water, I should have as it didn't roll out very well.  I will make it again because I liked the texture and flavor.  This is also the same recipe as Grandma's Secret pie crust.
