Actually baked instead of broiling, added red pepper and onion strips in addition to carrots. Used boneless chicken breast pieces instead of and substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder. Also added a little lemon juice as suggested in a review. Baked at 400 covered for 40 minutes, then added the carrots, red peppers, and onions; reduced heat to 350 and finished cooking (20 minutes) uncovered. Was delicious!! I am definitely going to make this again!

The ingredients are simple, the time to prepare and cook it is minimal and the taste is above average. 5 stars in my book. I did give it an extra five or so minutes through to ensure the potatoes we cooked through and browned up.

I loved the veggies in this-they were delicious-since they're cut up to 1" pieces, they do cook in time.  My chicken was a bit dry...the breasts were thick so I butterflied them, but it still took a while to get them cooked-maybe an extra 3 minutes, but then it was too much. Next time I'll try to get actual 4 oz chicken breasts and maybe pound them a little first.  Overall, easy, fast and good.

This was FANTASTIC!  Normally I don't keep cloves in the house, or sage.  Asked my husband to pick them up on the way home.  So glad I did!  Everyone raved about this.  Added yellow and red pepper strips to the carrots.  Used leftover small cooked red and white potatoes, just added them in at the first turning.  Based on comments, I was worried about it drying out.  But, without lemon juice in the house, I put a small glob of margarine atop each breast and everything turned out perfect!  Fabulous!  Will definitely make again, and sooo pleased to have chicken done so quickly!!!

We are chicken lovers and this went over well with my husband and 3 kids. I used Italian Seasoning instead of the fresh rosemary, thyme and sage because I didn't have it on hand. I sprinkled it over the breasts and veggies (of which I added sliced bell pepper and onions) while in the pan. Drizzled EVOO over all and sprinkled garlic salt and ground pepper. This is instead of inserting garlic into the chicken. Squeezed half a lemon over  chicken.  Placed pan about 8 inches from heat source, cooked 10 min and then flipped chicken and seasoned the other side in same manner as the first side. Cooked an additional 12-16 minutes. They were thick breasts and I kept checking them with the instant therm. so I didn't overcook them. As soon as all four breasts read 165 I declared them done. My husband didn't even use any salt or pepper to season what he dipped up. Said it had great flavor already. A previous review said the seasoning slide off and left a bland flavorless chicken. That didn't happen to my dish in the slightest and the chicken was very moist, not dry. Love Love how quick and easy this dish was to fix and cook.

Fabulous recipe, but I baked instead of broiling.  I baked under tinfoil at 400 for 40 minutes and then without for 20.  I added the veggies for the last 20 minutes.  The chicken was a little dry, and I think next time I'll cook it for less time.

Really Really Good.  I followed the advice of some of these reviews & baked it instead.  Also, I didn't have fresh herbs so I rolled the chicken in poultry seasoning & dry herbs - turned out heavenly.  I also used 2 boneless skinless organic & free-range thighs in addition to 2 boneless & skinless breasts...I assure you, the thighs were by leaps & bounds more delicious.

Veggies were awesome, but the chicken was a bit dry, next time I will try basting the chicken half way thru to see if that helps, but it was all still very delicious!

turned out try and the flavor remained on the outside of the chicken without really soaking in...when the herbs sloughed off we were only left with a dry relatively flavorless chicken.

Fast, easy, and delicious!  I added onions in addition to the potatoes and carrots.  After reading the reviews, I checked the chicken frequently -- ended up cooking it for 30 minutes.

The vegetables were awesome.  I will marinate the breasts in something else next time.  They were dry and did not have alot of flavor.

This recipe is Ill-conceived.  The chicken dries out and the veggies are undercooked.  My partner (for whom I do the cooking) commented “Well, at leas t you didn’t poison us”.  Next time, I’ll bake it in some chicken stock to ensure flavor absorption and even doneness.

I liked the simplicity and especially the one pan cleanup.  I modified slightly, added sliced mushrooms, 2T chopped green onions and 2T chopped celery.  

I made this for dinner to accommodate someone that needed to eat something not full of spices, something on the bland side.  This was perfect, however, it was far from bland.  The fresh herbs gives a great taste and paired with the vegetables, it was a earthy meal.  We both liked it a lot and will make it again.

Phenomenal! Love it! So quick and so easy! I didn't have carrots or garlic, so I used extra red potatoes, and I coated the breasts with garlic powder before I added the other spices. So good!! So quick and easy for an after work, midweek meal! ??????

Great chicken but the vegetable needed more time. I was afraid if i left to cook any longer the chicken would come out dry.

This was a great meal, easy to make and tasted great.
