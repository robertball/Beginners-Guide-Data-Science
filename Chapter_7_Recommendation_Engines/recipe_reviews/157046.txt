It's bland as is, so I  added garlic powder, onion powder,salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and I used  old cheddar cheese. These muffins baked a nice dome for their tops and they look so pretty and tasted great with the additions I added. It makes a great 'sandwich' the next day when you put a slice of turkey or ham in it. We enjoyed these muffins. THX

Making some revisions based on people's reviews, these are fabulous!!!  For the dryness that everyone spoke of, I added two extra tablespoons of butter, extra cheese, and cooked for ten minutes less than suggested.  For the blandness that was mentioned, I added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt and 1/4 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 cup of freshly grated dubliner cheese (like a sweet, bold paremsian cheese).  Pair with a nice fruit salad and it would be a perfect brunch, will definately make again. Thanks for the new recipe!

I'm sorry, but as written, these are just not to our taste. I made it just as the recipe states in order to give it a fair review, but IF I were to make them, again, I'd add a lot more seasonings, and for sure I wouldn't use frozen spinach.  I doubt I'll try them, again, though. N*R

I liked these. My husband liked them a *lot* (he's on his 4th now - in less than an hour). Its a great idea and they are very pretty, which counts for me. I think they are a just a little bland, but could easily be spiced up with some chili flakes and/or onion. Also, make sure to use sharp cheddar! Thanks for the recipe Breezer! N*R

These look great, but we do not care for the taste.  I would have to doctor them quite a bit into something we would really enjoy.  I have a feeling this would be a fun recipe to play with, but I don't like them as written.

I just made them last night... uhh...they were okay. I thought the flavor was good, but my muffins came out SO dry. They were like pretty little rocks :(. I might attempt this again if i combine it with another recipe.. maybe the spinach brownies on this site. I bet it will be good. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked these! I followed some reviewers' advice and added an extra 2 Tbsp. butter.  I also added 1/4 tsp. each of garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper. Went wonderfully with a bowl of soup.

This is what i did: I used 3/4 cup wheat flour, 3/4 cup all purpose.  I chopped up bacon and cooked till crisp, drained off grease, added the chopped drained spinach to the pan, added pepper, pinch of nutmeg, and smallest pinch of crushed red peppers.  drained well on papertowel.  Mixed all ingredients as directed, but added garlic powder and salt.  Scooped heaping tbs to greased muffin pans, and baked. They made 9 muffins.  I added the bacon to balance the spinach and give the recipe more flavor as well as the wheat flour for texture.  the nutmeg added wonders since it goes so well with spinach! MMMM they smelled heavenly in the oven, and looked marvelous.  The only critisism i have is i didnt really like the "stringy" texture the spinich gave them, but the flavor was ok.  Maybe next time i will use green onion or chives. Oh yeah, 35 mins was way too long, they were done in about 20 mins. They were a little dry too, but they were ok. Not sure if i would make again, maybe try fresh spinach. N*R

ok as written these are awful, I am thinking to much baking powder or flour.  They baked up nicely but the taste was not good.  I baked only two to see this way.  Then I added garlic, minced onion and pepper, these are still bland... wow... I would not make these again.

Very nice recipe. 
I added a bit of crushed garlic, chopped Spanish olives, black pepper and cayenne pepper. The taste was unforgettable!

I read the reviews about blandness so I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp thyme, and 1/4 cup parmesan ... but still bland. Texture was great, though, so I think I'll try adding sauteed onions next time to see if I can kick the flavor up a notch.

I am NOT a baker! Yet, these were so reassuring in taste and texture, that I am making them again, today! I add minced green chillies: my Indian pallet needs the fire! Love, love, love it, thank you!

I rated a 3 star only because I made the adjustments mentioned by previous reviewers.  I'm certain without them, that the recipe would've been quite bland as others had mentioned.  With that said, my family loved the recipe with the extra teaspoons of spices (garlic powder, onion salt, & pepper) added in.  My 5 year old asked me if I could make them again after he ate the last one.

I added many of the suggested extra ingredients to add more flavor and they were OK.  Very moist.  Something is off with the flavor--almost bitter.  I am going to try it again with more adjustments.  Maybe more salt and a little sugar.

These are yum!  I made them using colby as I didn't have any cheddar but they are still very tasty!  Definately worth making again.

Saw the N*R gang giving this a try a while back and knew I wanted to try it. Anything with Spinach and Cheese in it is a must try for me! I used old cheese and added onion powder and garlic powder. Very good. Next time might just try medium cheddar and see how it is.

I added some onion powder and garlic powder to the batter as they seemed like they would be a little bland.  Towards the end of baking I added a little cheese to the top of the muffin.  They received mixed reviews around my house.  Hubby and one son stated they reminded them of cornbread.  Would probably make them again but not often.

These were okay.  They were kind of bland.  Not bad, but not great.  I think maybe some garlic would perk them up?  Also, the cheese caused them to stick to my muffin tin a bit.  I had to use a knife and run around the edges to get the muffins to come out.  I'm going to dry out the leftover muffins and use them in a dressing recipe I have that normally calls for cornbread and baking powder biscuits.  N * R

I liked these, but they could use a little something else - maybe garlic or some cayenne, maybe even some shredded pepperjack cheese.  Still, they were tastier than I thought.  Best served relatively quickly - when they cool off was when I felt something was missing.  The only change I made was to use fresh baby spinach - lightly steamed, squeezed dry and chopped - instead of frozen, as frozen spinach always seems stringy and overcooked to me.   I think the fresh spinach was very flavorful in these.  Thanks for sharing! N*R

Unfortunately, our household didn't like these too much.  Hubby and I are both indfifferent to spinach so didn't know what to expect...but they were pretty bland and the taste of the spinach did over power even the cheese (we let them cool completely as the recipe seems to suggest).  I gave it two stars, one because they are REALLY pretty, and one for the benefit of the doubt (maybe it was just our tastes and not the recipe).  It was an interesting N*R (not reviewed) selection to try though!  N*R

Loved these (with some modifications, of course :)). Can't speak to the original recipe's results but with added ground pepper, garlic powder, extra cheese (including some smoked cheddar and some parmesan), 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour substituted, and some extra milk (all 1% though since that's what I have), I am in love. Mine didn't rise a *ton* and were certainly not the lightest things, but a bit more spinach than originally called for and some whole wheat flour will do that- delicious nonetheless!

These muffins were great right out of the oven. But don't make too many, they are not very good the next day. I used fresh spinach and these turned out well.

As written, these muffins need a lot of help.  After being very unhappy with the first batch (made exactly as recipe states) I added minced onion, a couple cloves garlic a 1/2 teas fresh nutmeg and more cheese.  I also made a separate batch with dried mustard powder and liberal dashes of hot sauce.  My family appreciated the changes.

I used 1 cup of white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of dried crushed thyme also to the batter.

I tried this recipe but I think it needed garlic butter with dried red pepper flakes, so I melted a 1/2 stick of butter with fresh garlic cloves and some red pepper flakes sprinkled in with a pinch of salt since the muffins needed more salt. I brushed this on top of the baked muffins and they tasted way better.

Making some revisions based on people's reviews, these are fabulous!!! For the dryness that everyone spoke of, I added two extra tablespoons of butter, extra cheese, and cooked for ten minutes less than suggested. For the blandness that was mentioned, I added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt and 1/4 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 cup of freshly grated dubliner cheese (like a sweet, bold paremsian cheese).

I tweaked these muffins a bit.... used 1/2 cup blue cheese and 1/2 cup cheddar.  I had self raising flour so used that instead of flour and baking power and I wanted to use the spinach I grow in my garden so I cut fresh spinach, soaked it in boiling water for 30seconds, squeezed out the moisture and chopped.  They turned out divine!!! Thank you

This is a wonderful idea, but the recipe has some problems.  As others advised, I added garlic and onion powders.  I doubled the recipe, so it was 3 c flour, 4 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 12 T butter, 2 eggs, 2 c milk, 1 c spinach, 2 c of cheese (I used Cabot's "seriously sharp cheddar").  I thought the taste was great, had zip.  I only baked them for 25 minutes, not dry at all.  But very, very greasy!  Also they stuck to the muffin cups like nobody's business.  I used a spike pan and put a yellow grape tomato in each muffin on the spike.  If less greasy and pulled from the paper liners more easily, would be perfect.

I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the flavour components of this recipe. And it made a delicious muffin! I added 2 eggs instead of one, doubled the cheese and also added 1/8 cup of powdered parmesan. I added 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 large diced onion and 2 tsp dried mixed herbs. The muffin was moist (almost like a quiche) and delicious. Good base recipe, but would be bland without extra ingredients.

Tried it out for a brunch and the muffins turned out nice and moist and went very well with the soup and salad menu I had prepared. They were a hit with my guests. Thanks!

Following the advice of other reviews I added 1/4t of garlic powder and 1/4t of onion powder and a dash of nutmeg.  I also sauteed one jalapeno in 1 T of bacon grease, before adding the thawed spinach.  I only used 4T of butter in addition to the bacon grease.  

I think these are delicious and will make again and again.  Great snack food!

These muffins remind me a lot of Red Lobster's biscuits.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added bacon.  I probably won't do that again.  With a little bit of garlic and onion powder, these are very good.  Be sure to use Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  N*R

I made 2 batches ... the first with more cheddar; the second with more cheddar, pepper, onion powder and garlic salt.  The second batch were definitely more flavorful, but both were good. They were a bit spongey - I'm not sure how to fix that.

Completely bland and with an odd texture.  Waste of ingredients, I don't  know why  but I think it would make a good dumpling with some pepper added.

These were OK.  Good if you're a fan of savory treats.  I was skeptical to try it as listed since lots of reviews complained about blandness, so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and sriracha to give it some flavor.  They also turned out a little dry.  Maybe more butter is needed.

The recipe looked like it might be bland and reviews said it was as written. I really wanted a spinach and cheddar muffin. I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion salt. I melted 8 tbsps  butter. I added a pinch of salt and pepper. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. 
We really enjoyed these Cheddar Spinach muffins with these changes.

I added some freshly ground black pepper to the batter. When there was only 15 minutes left, I have sprinkled on small pieces of thinly sliced smoked ham. For the last 4 minutes I have turned on the fan for some color. Yumm :)

I just made these. I should have read the reviews. I would have added chopped garlic and pepper. Overall, they were good they just need the extra seasoning. I sprinkled the tops with more cheese garlic powder, pepper and Parmesan cheese. The crust was wonderful.

I did this recipe yesterday and it turned out delicious! They remind me of pesto muffins. I will definitely remake this, and it was so easy! I did changed though some details according to others' reviews, and I'm sure that these tips improved a lot the recipe. I used fresh spinach that were quickly sauteed before incorporating them. Also I put 8 tbsp of butter instead of 6, added garlic powder and put 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 2. For the baking time, I baked them 15 minutes, and added another 5 minutes, and they were perfect! Not dry at all, super moist. I put them in the freezer later and today they still tasted great and soft after being heated. Only thing that I will do next time is instead of putting 1/2 tsp garlic powder I'll put only 1/8 tsp!

WONDERFUL CONCEPT! Had to make changes to make this in our home: 1) Sub'd whole wheat flour for all 1 1/2 C's. Still very light! 2) Used 2 packed cups fresh spinach, cutting spinach into strips using a chef's knife; used so much spinach that the final mixture seemed like a little bit of goo on a lot spinach; so much so that I almost threw it out. Good thing I didn't, as these muffins rose up into beautiful muffins. 3) Added seasonings per others' reviews, & decided to add most of the seasonings which I keep in my bean-seasoning-box: oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, garlic, chili powder & onion flakes. I eye-balled all of those: the results were great. 4) The one oops:  adding just a touch of salt, which I added because of the claim of blandness. I'm one to lean towards using way too much salt due to my thyroid. But these were little bit salty (I was bothered by the salt more than my family!? Go figure!) Not sure if I'll leave out the baking soda or just the extra salt in the future. I might need to play w/that over time. My family won't mind. They love these muffins. 5) Last modifications: I didn't have enough cheddar or any butter, so I used oil and I put in somewhere between 1/4 & 1/3 cup of parmesan. Had a slightly rounded cup of cheese overall in the end. Yum! Gonna figure out that salt thing yet. We usually have an overabundance of spinach at least once each month, which should provide plenty of practice! Yummy practice!  Thanks, Breezer!  These are fun nutrition!

I didn't have an egg, so I substituted 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead.  I cooked them for 25 minutes which was perfect.  My 4 and 2 year old (and myself) loved them.  They are a little plain, which is good, because my kids are partial to foods that are a little plain.

These turned out savory and soft. I made 24 mini muffins and backed for 28 minutes. I used PAM butter spray to give extra butter flavor when lining the pan.  I also used wheat flour instead of white flour. They are good when served with OJ to add sweetness. Otherwise they need a bit of sweet butter on top.  Overall, if you don't have a high sugar diet then these will taste good. But, if you eat a lot of sugar (like I used to) then these will taste bleh and yuck.  I love how they have no sugar!

These aren't bad.  Bf liked them as is.  I think that they do need a bit of spicing up, as they are bland, but other than that they were fine.  My spinach wasn't stringy like others--maybe mine was more finely chopped?  I made them last night and served them cold at dinner tonight.  Then I heated one just to see . . . the spinach flavor is more pronounced when they are warm.  I prefer them cold.  N*R  Go to Recipe Exchange for info on N*Rs.
