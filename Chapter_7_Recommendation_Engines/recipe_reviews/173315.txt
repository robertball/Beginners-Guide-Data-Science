Ok, I made my first pecan pie ever about 6 weeks ago at Thanksgiving. I loved it...but being my first time, I felt I should try out other recipes. Comparatively, this recipe is nearly identical to my first one, with just a few variations to the measurements and also using entirely light Karo (mine used half dark) and also using gran sugar instead of brown. Flavor and texturally speaking it was about the same. BUT!!!!! The simplest step ever was missing from this recipe -- IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS PIE...*please*, I implore you, toast the pecans first!! Nothing to it, put them all into a non-stick skillet over med heat...about 6 minutes total, and tossing if necessary to prevent burning. This is such a critical, flavor-enhancing step and it makes all the difference in the world. I promise. Happy cooking....

I absolutely love this pie! This was my uncle's "secret" recipe for the longest time. When he finally told us it's the recipe from the Karo syrup bottle, I was floored! Now I can make it myself! :P

Here's a hint to keep the edges of the pie crust from over-browning.  Spray the underside of a crust protector ring with non-stick spray and place it on the unbaked pie before putting the pie in the oven.  Do not remove the ring  until the pie is finished baking.  The crust will still brown nicely while covered.  I do this for all of my quiches and two crust pies.  I make my own rings out of heavy duty foil and they work like a charm.

There are lots of variations on this pie, but this is the classic that our family loves the best.  I do add a pinch (1/4 t) Kosher salt to the syrup mixture.  I think it brings out the flavor of the nuts better!

I've been making this recipe for years. Last year I added 1/4 cup of bourbon instead of the vanilla. It was delicious.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pie! I have been making this ever since I began hosting Thanksgiving, which is about 9 years ago. This really could not be simplier to mix up, and the flavor is wonderful (yes, it's supposed to be sweet)! Pecan pie is also VERY rich, so this goes a long way...This is the only pecan pie recipe that I have ever tried, and it's the only one that I will ever use~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My whole family loved this pie. Turned out a little darker than I'd have liked (I was unsure when to quit baking it) but I will definitely cook it again!

This pie was extremely sweet. I recommend reducing the sugar by half. I plan to do so, if I make it again using this recipe.

My mom showed me this recipe years ago. It is the only one I have ever used, though I often add more pecans. Covering the crust edge when baking is a must so it doesn't get too browned. The filling can be sticky when baking. I used to cover the crust edge with tinfoil, until I found a flexible silicone crust ring. One year, after starting to make the pie, I discovered I was out of vanilla so I used almond extract instead. That was the best pie ever! Now, I always skip the vanilla and use almond extract.

This recipe is perfect as is - it's a classic! Pecan pie is my husband's favorite and I have to make this version every year at Thanksgiving. He's now started requesting it at Christmas and he's not even a "dessert person".

I decreased the amount of sugar to 2/3 cup and added 1/2 tsp. salt. I used about 1-1/3 cup chopped pecans for the filling and a few pecan halves for garnish, which I placed on the pie halfway through baking so that they wouldn't burn. The pie came out great and set up nicely, but I think it might have tasted even better if I had used dark corn syrup instead of light.

The only change I make to this traditional classic family favorite is that I use 1/2 cup light corn syrup and 1/2 cup dark corn syrup.  Otherwise, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

This is a classic, easy to make pie. There are variations out there but none make any real improvements. I make this one along with pumpkin pie  for our annual dinner for our cancer patients - about 350 people now - and get rave reviews everytime. Don't over bake. It sets up as it cools. Yummy

Delicious, no-fail, and easy to make! I have been making this recipe for years and it never lets me down. I do put a ring of tin-foil around the crust edge for the entire baking time (for me its an hour) so the crust doesn't burn.

I think that this was a really good recipe despite the fact that it was slightly burned. It turned out crispy, though, so it tasted really good. My family called it professional.

I changed a lot and in this recipe based on the comments of others and it was very good but I obviously can't give it 5 stars because I varied  too much from the recipe. I honestly couldn't even rate the original recipe.

I toasted the pecans. I used brown sugar and cut the amount in half. I substituted the vanilla for 1/4 cup bourbon. Next time I will add more pecans as my husband said it was still a bit sweet and I thought the filling was a bit loose.

easy to make and good to eat.  good recipe for first timers.  I used finely  chopped  pecans because  they  are easier for my father-in-law to eat, for a prettier pie definitely  go with pecan halfs.  rather  than mixing  them in try arranging  them in bottom  of  crust and pour filling over them.  they will rise to the top.

I have been making this exact same recipe for nearly 50 years. I add just a little extra (Mexican) vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Sometimes I add a cup of chocolate chips, but my Alabama-born husband likes it better without them.

Right from the Karo syrup jar!  I will try using Splenda this year to cut down on the sugar and buy lite Karo syrup (dark) if I can find it.  This pie is a 5 star as it is.  Only reason I'm trying to cut down on the sugar is because I'm having sugar problems

I've used this recipe every thanksgiving since 1987.  My family and friends keep coming back for more.  And so easy!  My son just hosted his first Thanksgiving party on his own, and this is the recipe he wanted from Mom.  So I told him to use the recipe on the Karo syrup bottle.  It was a hit!  I do add 1/2 cup (or so) more pecans.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I've tried many pecan pie recipes and so many times the filling is runny but this one was just perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness, and absolutely delicious.

This is my go to recipe for great pecan pie. Traditionally I bake it for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law looks forward to it every year and always raves about how good my pecan pie is. You really don't have to mess with this recipe. Yes it's sweet, that's what pecan pie is like and it is good just as is.

I used this recipie to make my pecan pies for Thanksgiving here in Louisiana. I doubled the recipie ingredients for two pies. The filling and crust for both are from scratch. I also added three teaspoons of bourbon whiskey to the filling mix. The pies are cooling now. They should get me lots of compliments!

The only thing I added was a pinch of salt. My mother made this recipe and always told me to remember the pinch.  I cooked my pie crust for 10 minutes before adding the recipe and I covered the edges with foil for all but the last 15 minutes. It was fabulous and everyone raved about it.

Made it just as the recipe stated except for first toasting the pecans in a frypan for 6 min. This pie is so easy, with outstanding flavor. It was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner!

Wow! Very easy to make, simple ingredients and perfect taste! I got a lot of compliments and when asked for the recipe all I had to do was tell people where and how to find it! Served it at my 2017 Thanksgiving gathering!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and found it to be too sweet. I think the corn syrup has a rather artificial/chemical sweetness to it. One had to have whipped cream or vanilla ice cream with the pie to mellow it out. I pre-roasted the pecans and they turned out wonderfully.

I messed my other review up so I will try this again... made this yesterday. My first time attempting pecan pie. It was awesome. I did do a few adjustments, not on the original recipe but a few enhancements I guess. I toasted the pecans which I think was a great thing for the flavor. I whipped the eggs until foamy which I think helped give it a lighter texture. I also made a thick dark chocolate ganache and spread that on the bottom of the pie shell and then added the pecan pie filling. The dark chocolate I think really enhanced the flavors of this pie, and made the super sweetness of it come together. My husband said I can no longer make his favorite cake for his birthday, he only wants this pie.

For Thanksgiving my husband asked me to make a pecan pie. Just thinking about a pecan made me feel sick inside. I thought the idea of a pecan pie was simply disgusting. However, I found this recipe, IT WAS VERY QUICK & EASY TO MAKE!! I made my husband taste it first then I ate a slice AND I COULDNT STOP EATING THE PIE!! I ate the entire pecan pie!! It was sooooooooo delicious. I am now a pecan pie lover! Thank you for this recipe.

The flavor was supreme, but somehow it would not stay together when I cut slices. I must not have let it cool enough.

Everyone loved it. Will be my go to Pecan Pie from now on. I used a store bought pie crust dough and I could not find the specific brand of vanilla called out, but use pure extract. Turned out great!

My husband had two pieces and was just talking about having a third and he is a HUGE fan of pecan pies so I guess I did good on my first ever attempt to make one. 

However, I'm not a fan and even though this was my first attempt at making one, this is what I'd do different: I'd chop up at least half of the pecans next time so they're easier to eat (I did toast the pecans as one of the reviewers recommended and I'm not sure it made much difference) and I would cut the sugar in half. It turned out much too sweet. 

Covering the edges of the crust, as another reviewer mentioned, is a must. I did and the crust turned out perfectly.

Pecan pie is one if my favorites and this pie was really good.  My family really liked it.  The only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white.  My only advice would be to cover the edge of the crust with foil...my crust was darker then the pie filling.  :(

Cut the sugar in half and added pecans.  Not as sickly sweet as most pecan pies.

I made this 3 times this year, and here is what I learned.  You can increase the heat to 400 for the first 15 minutes and that helps it set up.  Also adding a tablespoon of flour helps with that too.  I left the pecans whole for two of the pies and chopped them for the third.  My family liked the whole pecan ones better. The difference was the whole ones floated to the top and got kind of roasted there. They liked that flavor. The chopped ones stayed more suspended in the mixture, but the pie was easier to cut and eat. I thought the flavor was still very nice on the chopped pecan one.  I also reduced the sugar by a 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.

If you're looking for a easy and yummy pecan pie - this is your recipe!  
I baked the pie a little longer (approx 20 minutes) at 325 degrees farenheit instead of 350 and the crust was perfect! 
This recipe is so delicious...even the kids loved it!   Everyone wants the recipe!

I have been making this pie for 20 years, every time I host Thanksgiving dinner. I've tried a couple of variations on this (especially chocolate), but I always come back to the classic. I agree with previous posters that a crust ring is key; aluminum foil is easy to do so the crust doesn't burn. It still gets plenty brown. I often use dark corn syrup, too, with good results.
