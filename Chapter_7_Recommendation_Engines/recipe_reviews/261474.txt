I followed  the recipe as written and it turned out great, everyone enjoyed it.  It didn't seem like much sauce before baking, I was nervous it would be too dry but it turned out perfect.

I made half the recipe. Honestly, this recipe is excellent as is. The only thing I had to adjust was the liquids because it needed a bit more so the sauce was enough. I didn't have Monterrey jack cheese so I used Gouda cheese I had on hand. This was excellent. Other than those two things which don't alter the recipe by much, I recommend to follow the recipe as is.

Partially boiled potatoes for less bake time and used cheese like velveeta to make it creamier.
Everyone had seconds. Will make again!

Amazing recipe. do yourself a favor and place potatoes in a bowl with kosher salt and microwave (potato setting 3) to par-cook potatoes. This lets the flavors get in better and shortens oven time.

It tasted good albeit a bit bland.  The potatoes were tender and cheesy.   The sauce was extremely thick when made as is so I added a bit more milk to thin it a touch.  I think next time, I will add more ham and not dice it as small as I did.  I was using this as a meal and not a side dish so I think it needed more ham.  I would definitely try it again with more ham and a bit more spice.

Used leftover spiral ham. Added cayenne pepper for a kick. Didn't have half and half so I increased the butter by a tablespoon, added 2 additional tablespoons of flour. Used 1 1/2 cup of milk. 
This was so, so good. I'll make it when ever I have leftover ham.

I love this recipe.  I found that you need more than one dish for this recipe.  So be prepared that you might want to have a back-up.  Also, with the amount of ingredients I had, I could've doubled the sauce recipe easily and still would want more.  The flavor is awesome.  I will totally make this again.

i was looking for a skillet recipe but this worked and was amazing. a little oil in the bottom of the pan, I sliced onion next, sliced potato layer with Salt & pepper and half the ham. another layer of potato salt & pepper and ham. poured a couple of Tbl. of water in covered with a lid and steamed for 15 min. while i made the sauce. Poured it over and cooked 10 more minutes and potatoes were soft and cheesy yummy.

Followed recipe exactly, as I usually do the first time making something new.  It was delicious but then I checked the nutritional info and was horrified! Yikes...this was supposed to make 8 servings but hubby and I enjoyed what equated to 2 servings each.  Close to 800 calories.  Will make again but will make sure we don’t over indulge.

I love loaded scalloped potatoes and have tried a few recipes, and this is the best so far.  I still found the sauce pretty bland.
