These are awesome!  Though I changed a couple things.  My applesauce is homemade, cortland apples.  I didn't have canola oil, used vegetable.  Did not have orange zest, used orange peel.  These are all minor, though this last one is a biggie.  I did not have a can of cranberry sauce, could not tell you if I ever have or will.  So I used a half a cup or so of honey, added enough water to make it the consistency of what I think cranberry sauce would be and then added some  Craisin's.  The whole thing measured 1 cup.  I did add cinnamon and sugar to the first batch though forgot it on the second.  Loved it both ways!

I did not have canola oil, I used vegetable oil instead. I also used a homemade unsweetened applesauce and whole berry cranberry sauce. Right before baking, I sprinkled a little granulated sugar over each muffin mound. I did get 12 really big muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, they were done in just over 22 minutes. Though my husband did not care for these, the kids and I thought it was great. It had just enough sweetness from the cranberry sauce and the little bit of sugar that was added and these were VERY moist and flavorful. What a wonderful muffin recipe!

I made 2 small changes.  I upped the applesauce to 3/8 cup and omitted the oil all together.  Second I used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar.  These muffins are amazing, OMGoodness, I wanted to eat  them all at once.  It took will power, but I made them last...now...I can make more.  Next batch, I will try using a touch of orange juice; see if it makes a difference.  LOVE THIS RECIPE  I was trying different recipes to see what new recipe I might try for Thanksgiving, but I'm keeping this for myself!
I have made these so many times, experimenting with what tastes best to me.  I found the coconut oil worked well when I ran out of applesauce.  I definitely love orange juice instead of water & by using only whole wheat flour creates a smoother batter and a very hearty (not too sweet) breakfast muffin.  I did dial back the oven temperature when I use the whole wheat flour only as it is less dense.


**I made this recipe again, but realized I miss-read the cranberry sauce label.  After all the other ingredients were mixed and ready is when I realized it was cranberry concentrate.  So, I improvised Elderberry jelly.  I'm sure other jellies would work (depending on your flavor preference).   They turned out pretty good.  Very sweet (to me, because I don't eat sweet things)  But an overall success.

Followed the recipe exactly, including bake time, and the muffins turned out perfect. They did taste healthy. You can interpret that any way you wish. Liked the orange notes. Maybe cut back on the amount of cranberry sauce to 3/4 cup. Any more and I think the muffins would be too dry. These would be perfect for a winter brunch.

I changed the recipe to make them high protein and high fibre. I added 3 scoops vanilla protein powder, only used 1 tablespoon of flour, dubbing in 1/2 cup large flake oats and ground up another 1/2 cup of oats, used 1 cup egg whites and didnâ€™t use cranberry sauce. Instead I used dried cranberries. Cut the sugar down to 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/4 maple syrup

When making a recipe the first time I try to follow it exactly and make changes on the next bake if I want to.  This time I made a few changes right out of the gate.  First off, I doubled the recipe and made 3-loaves (using disposable 8" foil pans), I substituted egg beaters for egg whites (basically same thing), I didn't have oranges for zest but had orange juice so substituted the OJ for water, and I had one can of whole cranberry sauce (which probably works out to be  1 1/4 - 1 1/2 cup) for the doubled recipe, and lastly,  I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of the loaves before baking.  Since I never made the original recipe it's hard to know if my changes made any difference, but this bread was a HUGE hit with my coworkers...."moist", "great flavors", "not overly sweet", and "where can I get the recipe" were a few comments....and since I work in a cardiology department the healthy substitutions were also appreciated!

Delicious!   I used whole berry cranberry sauce.  I'd recommend sprinkling sugar or cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

I added pecans. If I make them again I will add cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. They are pretty bland and heavy.

These came out great. I didn't have applesauce or canola oil, so I used 3 tbs of vegetable oil instead. I also used 1 egg instead of the egg whites. I used homemade whole berry cranberry sauce, not canned. I would love to make these again.

Made these a few days ago. Really liked them. I used canned cranberry sauce, pretty much followed the recipe, added about a tbsp of fresh squeezed orange juice. Did sprinkle with a mix of cinnamon and sugar on top before baking I saw as a suggestion in other reviews. My husband really liked them and I did as well. Will be baking another batch tomorrow and I am going to add coconut this time.

Good muffins. I had to substitute all purpose flour, had no wheat flour, and olive oil instead of canola, used jellied cranberry sauce as it was all I had and used a dash of orange extract as I had no zest. I added 3/4 cup of soaked dried cranberries to batter before baking also. My kids loved these!

Turned out delicious! I added a bit extra orange zest and used fresh boiled cranberries which tasted great in these muffins. Also sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar which I'll do again.

I used coconut palm sugar, half the quantity in the recipe.   And I did not add cranberry sauce because I didn't have any.  Even so,  we loved these muffins because they weren't too sweet, and we are trying to cut back on added sugar.   Very healthy!

I thought these were very good!  They are certainly very moist and full-flavored.

I didn't have cranberry sauce or applesauce, so in place of the cranberry sauce and applesauce and water I substituted about 1 c mashed banana and ~1/3 c orange juice concentrate, diluted 50%, and cut back on the sugar a bit (using 3/8 c instead of 1/2 cup).  I used a whole egg in place of the egg whites.  I used 1 c all-purpose flour and 1 c whole wheat flour instead of what was recommended.  And I also threw in some dried (sweetened) cranberries, chopped pecans, and shredded coconut.  

I had to bake them a little more than 30 minutes, but I loved how they turned out!  The combination of orange, cranberry, banana, and sweet potato was delightful!

Absolutely delicious!   I am on a diet, so substituted the sugar for splenda, but the taste was just the same.  I froze some, and even after a couple of weeks, they were wonderful.  Just pop them in the microwave for a few seconds and ...yum!!

I used orange peel and whole homemade cranberry sauce.  I evened up the flour measurements to 1 C each for simplicity.  I also placed a small dollop of cranberry on each muffin top for a little extra 'zing'.

Followed the directions almost completely but didn't have oranges handy for the zest so I just left it out. This recipe is delicious and I will be making it again.
