This chicken turned out delicious, however, it needed some tweeking so I only gave the original recipe four stars. Thanks to other reviewers I increased the recipe for the sauce quite a bit. This is necessary as having extra for a dipping sauce is a MUST! I did add a little water (tried olive oil too, but didn't work as well). It is too thick if you don't. You have to really watch this on the grill so the sauce doesn't get burnt. Also, as one reviewer suggested, I added some brown sugar just to the dipping sauce. This makes a huge difference also. I probably increased the sauce by 4xs, but I was cooking 8 breasts.
We will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I've make this minus the curry, (can't seem to acquire a taste for that) Make double (or triple) sauce, warm it up and serve it over some kind of asian noodles pad tai style... or linguini or angel hair.  A sprinkling of finely chopped green onions is a good add in.  Thinning out the sauce with a little chicken stock if it's too thick.  I prefer using the crunchy peanut butter or I've also topped it with chopoped peanuts.  My peanut butter lovin' 4 year old eats it up.

The sauce is VERY thick.  I added another tbsp of soy sauce plus some water to thin it out enough to baste the chicken.  What a different cooking method makes!  The first time I made this, I baked it and it came out pretty good.  Recently, I followed the recipe and grilled it.  The grill roasts the peanut butter and gives it a carmelized flavor that baking just cannot replicate.  While the chicken was grilling, I made a douple recipe of the sauce, added 1 1/2 tsp sugar and more water, and brought it to a boil in a sauce pan.  I served the chicken over whole wheat pasta and topped with the extra sauce.

I really liked this recipe.  I don't usually care much for boneless, skinless breasts; I find them dry and tasteless, but this recipe made them moist and flavorful.  I only cooked 2 breasts; there are only 2 of us, and I didn't want to heat up the grill for just 2 breasts, so I broiled them in my toaster oven.  I always have to play with recipes, so I added about a tablespoon of rice vinegar and about 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to the sauce.  I used all the sauce on the 2 breasts and they came out great; rich and delicious, and the sauce carmelized beautifully.  I served them with Sesame Noodles from this site, and braised bok choy.  Excellent meal.

I thought this was quick, easy and really good.  Following another reviewers advice, I doubled the recipe (and actually added some ground ginger) and after brushing chicken thighs with teh mixture (it was thicker than I expected), I added some chicken broth to thin it out and then used that as a sauce to pour onto the chicken and some rice.  It was really good, I will use it again (maybe on shrimp), and my husband really liked it as well, although it could have been spicier for him (and me as well).  Thanks for a great new recipe!

A nice recipe.  I cubed the chicken then rolled in the sauce before making kabobs with onions.  You can taste the hint of curry which gives the chicken an interesting flavor.  I really enjoyed it, however my husband says he prefers the Pork Satay recipe also from this site.  They are equally simple to make, and have similar flavors I think, this one is a little more complex with the curry.

This is so wonderful, the next day even better.  We've made it with both boneless/skinless chicken breast and thigh.  Thighs are the best.

Both my husband and I thought the flavor combination in this dish was wonderful.  I made the sauce, but then added about 1 T. of water to thin out a bit.  I let the chicken marinate in the sauce for several hours before grilling.  It was excellent, and we will definitely make it again.

I had never had peanut chicken before, and looking at the ingredients I just couldn't picture the taste, but was so curious, I just had to try it.  Both my husband and I LOVED it!!!  Will definately make many more times!!!

Delicious, savoury fusion of flavours that tickled the exotic taste buds. At first I was skeptical about using cayenne and curry with peanut buter and lime juice but it turned out excellent and had a fantastic overall flavour. My family loved it.

Tasty, but very thick sauce.  I used Jif Extra Crunchy peanut butter because it was what I had on hand the first time I made this & I don't suggest using it to anyone else.  I also made it on a George Foreman non-stick grill & it stuck thoroughly.  Definitely spray with cooking spray if you're trying it on a George Foreman grill!

First of all, I cubed the chicken breasts instead of halving them.  I doubled the recipe for the marinade, but next time I would triple it.  I omitted the cayenne pepper from the recipe because I didn't have any, and instead used crushed red pepper flakes.  I also added a little sprinkle of brown sugar to the marinade.  Once everything was together, I let the chicken marinade in the sauce for about an hour or so.  I cooked the chicken on the stove top in a pan.  Before putting the chicken in, I drizzled some sesame oil into the pan and heated it.  The chicken cooked for about 15-20 minutes, and it was perfect.  I served it over rice (with soy sauce, butter, pepper, and salt mixed in) and I used the Asian Salad Recipe also on this website.  It was delicious!  If you're looking for it to make a sauce for your rice to soak up, then you would definitely need to at the very least triple the marinade recipe.  With doubling the marinade, it coats the chicken very nicely, but there's no left over gravy to go with it.  It's still very good, but I think it could be improved with making more of the sauce.  I think some crushed peanuts and chopped green onions would be add a nice garnish on top.  This is a delicious, simple, and fast Asian meal.  I would recommend trying it!

Great, easy recipe! I'm giving a 4 though, bcz the concept is great but I did have to make several changes (as another user stated). I used my skillet to cook the chicken and sauce instead of the grill, omitted the lemon juice, an extra punch of curry, and added some finely chopped waterchestnuts. It added a really lovely crunch...otherwise, I loved it!! I served with basmati rice, excellent flavour! Thanks for sharing!

My family and I loved this dinner! I switched it up a bit after reading other reviews and decided to add low-fat coconut milk in to the sauce and marinated it overnight. I broiled the chicken for about 7-10 minutes on each side. This made the peanut sauce more crunchy and delicious. I made some extra sauce to use on top of basmati rice for a side. I didn't use as much garlic for the additional sauce, but it was equally as delicious. All in all, I'll definitely be making this again.

this was really delicious!  I agree that the sauce needs to be tripled and to have some left over as a dip too.  other than that it's a perfect combination of salty and sweet.  I just popped mine in the oven and then broiled for about 5 minuted to caramelize the sauce.

We loved this recipe!  I already made it twice - I doubled the sauce, used a quarter of it to marinate the chicken then added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to thin out the sauce.  We warmed the sauce and served it over the grilled chicken, brown rice and suger snap peas.

I was looking for low-carb recipes and found this one. When I was preparing the sauce, I was also preparing myself to be disapointed because it was very thick, and I wasn't too impressed with the pre-cooked taste of the spread. I put it on an outdoor grill, and I was shocked to find that I LOVED the chicken once it was done. SO moist. I was also surprised that it wasn't as peanut tasting as I expected, which is good! It just made the chicken taste flavorful, spicy, garlicy, and wonderful. I'll make again, perhaps as a kabob and brush on that way.

Not that great - but I think it has potential. The sauce was very thick, like a paste. So I thinned it with coconut milk, you could also use chicken broth. I used my grill pan on the stove, it smelled like I was baking peanut butter cookies. I would cut way back on the peanut butter and add more curry and other spices as all I could really taste was the peanut butter.

This was sooo good with a few alterations: I used regualr peanut butter vs. low fat because reduced-fat peanut butter doesn't taste like real food to me, and regualr peanut butter is a good source of healthy fat, which we all need. I added a little chicken stock and a little light coconut milk to thin the sauce and make it more easy to spead. I also added just a wee bit of sesame oil (about 1/4 tsp) because it tastes so good and helps to anchor all the different flavors. Yum.

This was a good recipe but needs some extra touches.  Since it was pouring rain, I made it on the stovetop instead of the grill.  Used a teflon griddle on medium head with a TOUCH of peanut oil since a lot of reviewers complained of burning/sticking sauce. I thought the sauce was WAY too thick also so I added about 1/2 cup sesame oil. Flavor was good - I love anything with curry, my husband is so-so on it but loves peanuts so he was very happy. I served it on a bed of pad thai noodles (recipe on this site - I think it's "Asian noodles" but I tweaked that too) and garnished with thin biased cut scallions and chopped peanuts. I will make this again since my hubby loved it but will probably turn up the heat on the spices. Thanks for a different recipe!!

Way To Go Girl!  what a great and authentic-ly asian taste.  i especially like that fact that it is low in fat and low in sodium.  next time i will try this like mentioned in another review and make it satay style (strips on a skewer) this one is a keeper.

Not impressed at all.  We ate it, but had to force it down. :( This is the first time ever, after using allrecipes for many years, that we've run into a favored recipe that we've actually not liked.  I guess there's always a first.

This was a nice change in my grilled chicken rotation.  I doubled the sauce, so I could used some for marinating, and some for basting when it was just about to come off the grill.  I also left out the curry, my BF isn't a fan, and added honey, because it seemed a bit salty.  The honey made it perfect in my opinion.  Served w/ a bagged Asian salad, and baked potatoes.  Very good!

This was pretty good, but I almost added some minced fresh ginger and I really wish I had,  It would have been wonderful in this!  I used regular natural style peanut butter, and probably doubled the lime as the sauce was very thick, and after grilling the chicken it actually had a sweet taste to it.  I still felt like it was missing a little something, so I think I will add the fresh ginger next time, and maybe even some Thai chili sauce or something else to give it some heat.  Still, it was pretty tasty and a nice change from the norm for me!

i'm giving this five stars because it was a base recipe for one of the best meals i've cooked in a while.  i followed tips of other reviewers and used a Forman grill as well as double the sauce and serve it over whole wheat pasta.  it was SOOOO good.  i added some ginger powder, crushed red peppers, and an extra clove of garlic as well as some water and extra soy sauce to thin the sauce.  MMMMMM!

Great recipe.... My mother hates peanut butter (can't even bear the smell of it)  and even SHE was asking for seconds!

I dilute the mixture with garlic liquid as well

I used this sauce to jazz up some frozen turkey burger patties.  I used the leftover spread onto the bun for a bit of extra kick.  Also, a few dashes of hot sauce can easily be substituted for the cayenne pepper.

the peanut sauce is really tasty, and although better suited as a marinade for the chicken, it is also really good to mix in with plain cooked pasta!

I own a chicken shop so have tried everything. I used chicken drumsticks for this. Slash the legs a few times around the bone. I put latex gloves on and mixed the legs with the mix until all was coated. Place on a baking tray and bake for 45-60 mins. Very tasty.

I have made this recipe as written, but I have also marinated pork loin cubes in the peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, garlic, curry powder and cayenne pepper mixture. I grill the pork on skewers. Both versions please us.

I used the crunchy PB as suggested but ended up the losing the peanuts on our GF grill. Then, even after thinning out the marinade sauce with olive oil, we thought it was a little too dry. So my hubby melted some smooth PB and drizzled it as a sauce once the chicken was served and it was GREAT! I also marinated green/red pepper pieces along with the chicken and added green onion to the marinade. Thanks for the recipe!

I added about a TBSP of olive oil to the marinade to make it a little less stiff.  I also grilled the sauce side down first so that the sauce got cooked on the chicken.  Make sure you keep an eye on it while grilling if you do it this way.  I will try what another rater suggested and marinate next time.  This was delicious.

Oh my goodness!!  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  The peanut sauce is DELICIOUS!!  I did make a double batch to use during the grilling process, and then I made a batch of sauce for eating.  As some other reviewers suggested, I added a bit of brown sugar to the dipping sauce, but I don't think it was necessary.  Some suggested that the sauce was too thick, but I really liked that consistence of it.  I will probably make a double batch dipping sauce next time too.  It reminded me of a pad thai sauce.  Soooo good!!  Thank you for this recipe.  We will definitely be making it again!

This was okay, at best.  Definitely worth eating, but not worth making again.  The sauce was just missing something.  And I even added a little chile pepper sauce to it.  I used regular crunchy peanut butter, but the peanut butter flavor didn't come out too much.  I think the soy overpowered the other flavors.  I didn't taste the lime at all.  If I made again, I would definitely scale back the soy.

WOW!!!!!!!!! I seriously have a new favorite chicken recipe! This was beyond delicious! I was out of cayanne pepper so I used chili powder instead. I also don't have a grill so i doubled the recipe then mixed water in and simmered it on the stove. Then poared the extra sauce over the chicken and rice that I made. PERFECT!!! Thank you CHANDRA6 for an amazingly delicious and easy meal!

Followed the recipe exactly - flavor was good (nother keeper).  The best recommendation I can give is use minimal sauce on the chicken while grilling - save a majority of it for dipping.  Glazing the chicken makes for a messy grill.

This was excellent!  However after reading the other reviews, I did add water and more soy sauce to make the sauce thinner and easier to spread.  I doubled the sauce recipe as well and I will use it for other items in the future!

Really really good. I had never really cooked on the grill before, besides basic hamburgers, so I tried with this recipe. I really liked it. The sauce was really thick so I wasn't sure how to spread it on, but I figured it out. I really like peanuts so I think next time I will use more peanut butter and thin the sauce down some.

Very yummy- I cooked it on a grill pan, and we did get the delicious caramelization. It is pretty thick- we did not thin it down, but it probably would have been messy if we tried to do this on a regular grill. But, it was delicious and I think it's a new favorite!

I liked this recipe. My husband didn't rave about it but he ate it. I would rather it not have such a thick peanut taste. I think next time I will add a little bit of chicken broth to the sauce so it thins out a bit. Loved the lime and curry flavor.

My family who had this as it was made said this was just 'ok'. My mother thought it tasted like she had just spread peanut butter on chicken. The other flavours, she thought, did not come through at all.
I had this a couple of hours later, reheated. It was awfully dry and hard to eat. But at this stage the crust was lovely, and the flavours had spread quite a bit.
So my hints would be to leave the peanut sauce to meld a little in the fridge before you cook the chicken. And it definately needs more liquid to stop the chicken drying out. 
Will maybe try again just to see if it does work.

I just made this recipe tonight, and I thought it was ok.  I will try it again because the smell of the sauce was actually VERY good, but it didn't seem to give much flavor to the chicken by just having brushed it.  I would double the sauce to pour over the chicken, when done.  I added about a teaspoon of water and then a teaspoon of coconut milk to dilute the thickness of the sauce.  Good mix of flavors, but not enough to make a difference in the chicken, for me.

This was great. I didn't feel like messing with the grill so I cooked in in a skillet and it was still great. However, next time I will add the peanut sauce after cooking the chicken on each side and then continue to cook each side one more time. This way I don't have to worry about the sauce burning.

Made this for dinner tonight.very tasty..I added some vegetable oil to make it a little more spreadable,also a little brown sugar as it tasted a little bitter. Marinated the chicken a few hours. after grilling the meat was very moist, but not much of the flavor was there. my teenager suggested to save a little to use as a dipping sauce, next time I will..definitely will make this again.

My husband and I loved this chicken.  I used boneless skinless chicken and marinated it in soy sauce and fresh lime juice before grilling.  I added a bit more lime juice and soy sauce to my peanut butter mixture to thin it to a consistency easy to brush on the chicken.  We will make this again!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I baked mine instead of grilling-- delicious! 45 minutes on 350°. I actually added a little more PB and soy since I knew baking it would cause the sauce to thin out and it was perfect. I baked in an 8x8 baking dish (3 breasts cut in half so 6 pieces) to keep the sauce from thinning over a bigger pan. My husband and I loved it and can't wait to make it again!

Tastes very good, not over "peanutty" and great with some sweet potato on the side.

For grilling I would recommend placing some tin foil down first on the grate otherwise you WILL have a fiery mess as the drippings are somewhat combustible and will burn your chicken.  Luckily I learned this separately and the meal turned out great.

Be careful  (especially if cooking in a skillet indoors) peanut butter burns easily!!!!!  I had to make a second batch of sauce because the sauce slid off when I turned the chicken over.  And the sauce was more like a paste.

The peanut butter flavor was to overwhelming on the chicken for our taste. I gave this a three only because our 2 year old really enjoyed it but he would also live on peanut butter if we let him!

After reading the great reviews and seeing the simplicity of the recipe, I was SO disappointed when my grilled peanut chicken experience was so disastrous! I knew I'd have to thin out the sauce, per reviews, but I was afraid to thin it out TOO much and straying too far from the intended recipe. The sauce burned easily, had a cakey texture (even after I tried to thin it out with extra lime juice and soy sauce), was spicier than expected an the overall texture was... strange... in the end. I was so disappointed in the end that my boyfriend and I read the recipe over and over again to see if we had done something wrong, but we hadn't. I'd love to have someone who rated it 5-stars make this for me because I am still convinced that something went wrong, although I can't really point point WHAT, and I'd love to see what it's supposed to taste like... I gave it two stars because it was edible, but I would never make it again! So bummed! :(

This is a very good recipe and the sauce is delicious.  I wish I had listened to other reviewers and made enough sauce to go over my noodles.  Will certainly do that next time.

My husband and I really liked this.  I made the recipe exactly as written and would double the sauce next time.  I had made some brown rice to go with it and there was no sauce left for the rice.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

Strictly following recipe instructions gives this dish a restaurant quality taste: two thumbs up for Chandra6!!  Don't let not owning a grill stop you from making this tasty dish!! Make the sauce and simmer it on stovetop for about 30 minutes; adding just enough soy, garlic or water to get that right taste / texture.  Make enough to baste chicken, pour over fetticiune noodles AND spare some for dipping.  If you are out of curry--try "atom smashing" some red pepper flakes in the food processor and use enough for your tastes. Definitely am going to try crunchy peanut butter the NEXT time I make this dish!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any chicken breast but I did have precooked plain chicken strips.  I sauteed them with this sauce and it was absolutely delicious!  Next time I will try it with the grill though :-)

I loved this. Made up a batch of basamati rice while I was thinking about things. Put together the baste...ended up slathering it on the pounded out chicken breasts...I liked that it was thick, then I didn't have to bother with basting.

As I was waiting for it to finish cooking I thought that sliced green onion would go well. Boy, oh boy! did it! Sliced up a green onion...put it on top on the basamati rice...dashed some teriyaki sauce over all. Cut up one of the cooked chicken breasts and mixed w/ the rice.

Good eatin' from a single girl. I am looking forward to my lunch tomorrow!!!

So first I must explain, I did not grill these, cause I live in NYC and grilling isnt really something we can do easily off the tiny balcony, so i baked the chicken and otherwise followed the recipe exactly, I would not recommend this. I am not sure if it is the recipe or me baking, but I am going to assume its the baking. I had cooked this for friends, and it smelled wonderful, but the texture of the chicken got a little off, but my friends like it anyway.

Like others have noted, I found that I had to thin out the sauce quite a bit (using soy sauce, lime juice and a bit of water). I made 2x the recipe for 3 full chicken breasts. I don't eat meat, but my meat-eating dinner guests loved it, so I would make this recipe again. Thanks for a flavourful recipe that doesn't require marinating (good for a last-minute dinner plan!).

I actually added a bit more curry than the recipe called for as I do love curry.  I also put in a couple dashes/squirts of sriracha sauce, which is a sweet and spicy Thai hot sauce you can find in the Asian foods aisle at most major supermarkets.  It gave the peanut sauce an extra kick as well as a hint of sweetness to it that complimented the dish well.  Easy, delicious for its simplicity, would make this again.

I am only giving this 3 stars because, though this was VERY yummy, the measurements are way off.  We definately doubled/tripled the sauce to put over pasta, and put more soy sauce, water, and some brown sugar in the sauce.  The brown sugar is what made the biggest difference and made this delicious!

It was great perfect if you cook on outdoor grill.  I also added a little chicken broth to loosen the paste and it was great.  Family enjoyed - just another variation to cook the all so common chicken breast.  good luck!

As is, I found this recipe just so-so. Instead,I used the sauce as a marinade after adding additional peanut butter, then dredged the chicken breasts in chopped peanuts and unsweetened, flaked coconut and grilled on the Forman grill. Served with sesame noodles and a mandarin/almond salad, it was a great meal I served to company.

This was horrible!!!  I finally added 1 cup of hot water to thin the sauce.  Otherwise, it would have just been a clump of peanut butter, soy and lime juice on the chicken.  You might want to go back to the drawing board on this one.  Once I added the water, it was good.  Served with rice and sprinkled cilantro over all.

I think this tasted pretty good, but would have liked a strong peanut taste. I marianted the chicken over night in the lime juice, soy and  sesaonings and then basted the chicken with the peanut sauce mixture when grilling. next time, I'll just grill after marinating and serve the peanut sauce on the side.

It was just OK. The sauce was too thick and didn't have enough flavor. I doubled the amount of the sauce and still wish I had more. Soy sauce is almost non-existent and the curry flavor was very mild. Sorry, not a keeper for us. Will try the Chicken Satay recipe next time.

This has a good taste but would have been a better marinade than a sauce that you rub on while grilling. It was too thick (I even added a tbsp of olive oil) and all of the sauce stuck to my grill and not the chicken. And yes, I greased my grill. I'd be willing to try it again, but use it as a marinade instead.

Not quite grilling season here tonight, so I brushed on the sauce (I tripled the sauce amount) and baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and served extra sauce on the side. Very good, will be making again!

This sauce was so good! I was going to leave out the curry, but so glad I put it in. As soon as I addd it the sauce smelled so good. I will make more to use as a dipping sauce.

So, so, so good!!! I doubled the sauce and then sauteed the chicken with about half of it. I put the rest in a small saucepan and added more soy sauce and some water and then heated it to a thinner consistency.  Served it with rice and broccoli.  What a win!!

Turned out great! Sauce was thick, but worked well on the grill since it stuck to the chicken! Tastes just like a nice chicken satay.

This recipe was pretty great, but I did have to dilute the mixture with more soy sauce as other reviewers stated. We put some of the sauce aside so that we had extra sauce to pour over our rice and veggies!

This dish turned out better than I expected. I did not have a grill so I used the frying pan instead. Although it was hard not to burn the peanut sauce like other reviewers said, it did not burn the chicken fortunately. I did use thin cuts of chicken to reduce the searing time. I also doubled the sauce so to reserve some when serving and I was generous with the cayenne pepper to my liking. The lime juice really popped out and complimented the overall sauce. My husband loved it. I followed the advice of another reviewer and served this chicken with the Sesame Noodles recipe by scoopnana. It was just perfect!

Loved the sauce - so flavorful! We did ours in the oven since it wasn't really grilling weather, and they turned out moist and amazing. Wouldn't change a thing.

Quick and easy! I made a few changes.. I made 2 batches of the sauce, one for basting and one for dipping. The basting one I made as the directions said (except I didn't have curry powder so I used turmeric and I also thinned the sauce with about 2 tbsp of water). The dipping sauce I also made exactly like the directions (again using turmeric instead of curry) and I also added some local honey for a bit of sweetness. I would say I added about a tsp to a tsp and a half.  I also thinned this with 2-3 tbsp of water. 

the chicken came out great! Next time I think I would triple or quadruple the sauce, I found I didn't have enough for basting (4 lg chicken breasts) and we didn't have enough to dip the leftovers in. It's really tasty sauce !

I used this sauce idea over some meatless chicken and it turned out great! I agree with the others with how thick the sauce was. I added some Greek yogurt to the peanutbutter.Sauteed some Asian veggie mix over whole grain pasta. It was very good!

This is sooo good. I cooked the chicken in a pan, not a grill, followed the recipe as is, but I make extra sauce because it's too good to not add a little more! Green onions are a great garnish, and next time I think I'll serve this dish over pad thai noodles with extra sauce and veggies (: So good!

I fried 1 lb chicken in 1 tbs olive oil over the stove top.  It was just enough sauce.  Thanks, this was easy and it was made with ingredients I had on hand.

Definitely double or, better yet, triple the sauce.  I did like it better for dipping with a little brown sugar added.

This is a good recipe, but sometimes the sauce is a little thick and thus slightly hard to handle; would recommend thinning.

This is a quick and easy meal. I made two chicken breast but still made the sauce for four servings, using crunchy peanut butter.  I pounded the chicken down until it was about a 1/4" thick then salted and peppered both sides.  I cooked it in a skillet with olive oil, instead of grilling.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I LOVE peanut butter so decided to try this even though I don't love sweeter sauces.  This is a easy recipe and very different.  I didn't love it but will prob make it again just because its nice to have a chicken recipe that tastes totally different

Wow!  This was outstanding!  I added a bit more than a dash of cayenne, and had to add quite a bit of grapeseed (or olive) oil to make it more of sauce consistency for basting, but it was fantastic!  Rave reviews from dinner guests.  SO easy and quick too!  Careful when grilling the chicken so you don't burn it - I think its better to wait until the end to baste it.

I should have read the directions more carefully - I put the sauce on both sides before grilling, and the first side was more burnt than carmelized.  Still good, though!  I left out the curry powder and cayenne because my family doesn't like spicy food.

With some adjustments this was perfect. Adding brown sugar and chicken broth is absolutely necessary for the sauce . I kept the skin on the breast and put sauce both under and on the skin and broiled it in the oven. Flipped it once and brushed more sauce and flipped one more time to carmelize and look pretty for the plate . It was super tender and flavorful! Served with a small spring salad it presented wonderfully

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made it, we didn't have any curry.  The chicken came out pretty good.  The second time I made this, I followed the recipe to the T and WOW it was fabulous.  I don't see a need like some reviewers to double the sauce but adding a little water or extra lime juice helps thin it out to make it easier to brush on to the chicken.  This is a great, VERY EASY and fast chicken recipe that is a nice change from our usual plain grilled chicken.  I like to serve it with fresh green beans, snow peas or broccoli.

Absolutely delicious! I did thin out the sauce with water and extra soy and lime juice. You're definitely going to want more of the sauce!

This was pretty good, but the sauce was way too dry. It might have been a little drier then usual since I only use natural peanut butter. This was easily fixed by adding a liberal amount of low sodium chicken broth to the mixture. I also added some ginger and ground corriander seed. I would definitely double the sauce and save some for dipping.

I made this chicken tonight for the first time and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the consistancy of the peanut sauce and how it adhered to the chicken while grilling.  I will make this again.  It was big hit at our house!!

My husband is a HUGE peanutbutter guy. He loved this recipe. Thought it should be in a restaurant! I broiled the chicken @ 400 for 12 min, but think I'll grill it next time. Made sauce for chix & applied as is. Served with angel hair & made an additional double sauce which I thinned out with chicken stock & I added green onions. Tossed the pasta with sauce & served chix over top. Yummy. Thank you!

I thought this was ok but not great.  I love peanut butter and thought the flavors worked well together but for some reason was not wowed by it.  I am giving this four stars because it wasn't bad, just not my kind of thing.

who needs fat free peanutbutter?... work it off with after dinner activities =)  good stuff, add liquids to the sauce (more soy) also needs more citrus somewhere...  extra lime ontop, we had a "kim crawford" blanc with a touch of grapefruit... worked well.  serve over the sesame noodles.

This recipe really surprised me. It had great taste and the proof of that was that my husband Loved It.  I thinned down the sauce significantly and thought I should do it some more but was afraid to lose the great taste.  This one is in my recipe box and I will definitely use it again.

I thinned the marinade with 2 tblspoon water and was pretty liberal with the curry and cayenne. Prepared as kabobs with thigh meat, red and green bell peppers, onion, and hot peppers - these were the best kababs i've ever made!!

I was really excited to try this chicken, but I wasn't too impressed. Something was off. It was really rich, and had a strange taste. Can't pinpoint what was wrong, but I won't try this one again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband LOVED this dish!  He's still talking about it!  He said the sauce was so good he would eat it on a sandwich!  Like others stated, the sauce is VERY thick so I did add some extra liquid to thin it a little.  I will put this in the dinner rotation.

Both my husband and I absolutely loved it!!  Exceptionally quick, easy, and tasty.  I made this as is, except to use water to thin out the sauce. Will try next time adding some peanuts maybe. Used other reviews and served with thai noodles and slaw.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!

Pretty fast, pretty healthy, and definitely something different.  I heated the peanut butter for about 45 seconds in the microwave and then mixed it in with the rest of the sauce ingredients, and I didn't have any of the spreadability problems others reported.  I might marinate the chicken in the sauce for a bit before it's grilled next time, and make some extra sauce for dipping.  Overall, good flavor, good prep time, and definitely different.

This was really good.  I've made twice now. The first time I thought it was a bit too salty, so I left out some of the soy sauce the 2nd time around.  It was perfect.  I too found that the sauce was very thick, but I just used some chicken broth to thin it down a little.  by doing so, it gives you extra sauce for dipping after cooking.  Excellent flavor, extremely easy and really good.

This was fantastic!  I made it per the recipe, but added a little red wine vinegar and water to thin it out, and I marinaded chicken strips for around 2 hours, and threaded them on skewers, and baked for arounnd 10 mins, then finished in the broiler.  Fabulous!

This chicken recipe was great. The flavor was delicious! Like others have said, the sauce is very thick so I added more soy sauce and lemon juice to thin it out. Don't let that stop you from trying it, it is very good.

Eh.  I didn't read the reviews, so didn't think to thin the sauce... it made more of a paste - difficult to spread and just came off as soon as the chicken hit the grill.  Good concept... needs lots of adjustments.

This was excellent and my husband wanted more.  It's not often that he loves something like he did this.  I don't have a grill and made it in the skillet with a little olive oil.  It probably would have been better grilled because the outside got real done before the center was done, but it was great and we loved the flavor.  My 5 year old daughter says she would not like it and then was surprised when she loved her first bite!

This made for a superb little sauce cooked on top of the chicken. I don't care for unmarinated chicken, but I didn't know what to marinate it with. I would suggest trying it with the Asian Salad on this site.

Excellent recipe. Not too spicy, either. I followed it exactly...I do recommend grilling as the sauce is really thick. All 4 of my children ate it. The flavors come together nicely. I served  it w/ "Asian coconut rice", which my husband & I loved but the kids passed on.

I found this very mediocre. I love peanut sauce and curry and all the ingredients and thought that this would have real potential. Unfortunately, I found this extremely bland.  I followed the recipe to a T, but, as others have noted, I had to thin the sauce with an extra tablespoon each of soy sauce and water in order to make it spreadable. On the plus side, the chicken was very moist. I don't think I'll bother with this again though.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe was pretty good. I agree, the sauce is much to thick if you follow the recipe exactly. I used the suggested ingredients, but not the suggested amounts. I added way more soy sauce, some olive oil to make smoother, and more garlic. Keep adding olive oil and stir until your sauce is smooth. Nice flavor--i was worried about it being too sweet, but the sweetness of the peanut butter is knocked right out by the soy sauce. This would go great with some asian noodles. You will need to experiment with the sauce, but overall, i'd recommend it.

I was hoping for a little more from this recipe.  I marinated the chicken in a watered down version of the sauce for several hours, then grilled with the sauce as directed.  I made extra as several reviewers suggested, which was good.  The chicken turned out dry and a little to crisp on the outside, but the sauce helped.  My boyfriend who is a grill expert was in charge of grilling it, so I was surprised it didn't turn out wonderfully.  We'll try this one again, because we liked the flavor, and maybe cook it over lower heat for longer.

I served this with a variation of Dad's Pad Thai of this site. They went well together and we enjoyed it, but the chicken really didn't have a ton of flavor by itself. It cooked moist, but the flavor was just ok.

This was really good and such different flavors for the normal old chicken breasts. I served over egg noodles with extra peanut sauce and added sliced scallions.

The sauce is very thick, but flavorful.  I doubled it and added a little honey.  It's good that the sauce it thick--the sauce clings to the chicken when you flip it on the grill and carmalizes nicely.  I didn't gill it for the amount of time listed on the recipe--more time on side one than on side two.  Nowhere near six-eight minutes on either side.  I'll make this again.  I served it with coconut rice from this site as well as a cold asian noodle salad from this site.  Good for a weeknight summer meal.

This dish is FANTASTIC!!  My 11 year old daughter makes this for dinner, following the recipe exactly, and it comes out beautifully.  Rave reviews!   The only reason I can think of why some reviewers found it dry is perhaps they are grilling the chicken too long.

I thought this recipe was excellent. Just use boneless, skinless so that less can 'peel' off on the grill. I also added 1-1/2 tbs of veg oil into the mix, and let it marinade about two hours before grilling. The sauce stuck well to the meat. A little fish sauce also adds a nice touch.

I used breast strips and marinated for several hours in a double batch of the marinade. I did add 1/2 a small can of chicken broth to the mixture to thin it out as other readers suggested.  Instead of grilling, I pan fryed the strips until almost done (in a dry pan) and placed them in an oil sprayed baking dish when finished.  I brought the remaining marinade plus the remaining can of chicken broth to a boil and added 2 handfuls of frozen green peas and 1 red bell pepper chopped (from a jar) into the marinade.  I topped the chicken strips with 2 cups of cooked bow pasta and poured the heated marinade mixture over the pasta.  Covered with foil and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Delicious.  Even better the next day for lunch.

Really Great and so easy!  I will use this again real soon.  However, the sauce does not make much so I would double and then put some on the chicken after.  Yummy!

I let the chicken breast marinade for about three hours after I vacuum sealed.  Smelled wonderful on the grill.  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  We did not think there was a lot of flavor.  Would probably not make again.

This is good BUT... I am going to stick with the Chicken Satay from this site.  There are very similar but I like it better. This recipe I followed like tha other and cut the chicken into strips and that put them on kabobs. I broiled 5 minutes per side.

Unfortunately it is Winter and I didn't want to go to and grill. So we made it inside. Instead of the grill I used a griddle , and let it cook on there for a while then I switched it to cookie sheets covered with foil and baked at 400 til temp reached 165. It was very moist, and the family liked it but I thought it could have used a little more flavor.

It was easy and yummy, but I made double the sauce so we could have some on the plate w/ the cooked chicken.  Also, I'd probably cook it on the stove top next time so the peanut sauce stays on the chicken instead of falling through the bbq grate.

I doubled the recipe, omitted the garlic due to dietary restrictions, used regular peanut butter instead of low fat and used thighs instead of breasts.  We liked it! I added more soy sauce to thin it out a bit to make it easier to brush on the chicken.  Will make this again.

This chicken and sauce was delicious!  As recommended by other reviewers, I tripled the sauce recipe using 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to give the sauce a bit of a “kick”, and 2 tablespoons of grated palm sugar for a little sweetness.  It was perfect.  I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/2” thick so it would cook more evenly on the bbq, and I marinated the breasts in about half of the sauce for an hour, then used the remaining sauce as a dip with dinner.  This is a super quick and easy recipe and, the best past, it uses ingredients that I always have on hand.  I’m definitely adding this one to my weeknight repertoire.  Yum!

This is awesome. I’ve made it twice now – once baked in the oven, and once on the BBQ; both times it was great.  I used a curry paste (not powder) and added a bit more lime juice. The kids liked it too!

I did this on a stove top, I cooked the chicken a little then threw the sauce on. I added water periodically to keep the peanut sauce from burning. I did double the sauce like almost everybody else made note of.
 despite detouring from a huge components (grilling), it was delicious!

Made this one with thighs (chicken on the grill needs bones!), the sauce was tasty but 3 stars because I had to double it and tweak a bit. Used crunchy peanut butter for texture, doubled the garlic, had to thin it out with a couple more tsp of soy to make it spreadable.

Be careful the peanut sauce will burn quickly on the grill. I had trouble with the sauce not sticking to the chicken breast and flaking off.

Moist chicken with wonderful flavour. Made on stove top using boneless chicken thighs.  Seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and doubled the cayenne and curry, then smeared on peanut  butter.  Warming the peanut butter in the microwave makes it easier to handle.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I thought the chicken lacked flavor and was too dry.  The sauce burned and didn't flavor the inside of the chicken at all.  I think this could be improved if the sauce were more like a marinade.

Although it did taste good,  unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before making it.  The sauce is way to thick, next time I'll add more liquid as others suggested.

Very unusual, delicious flavor! I never would have thought to combine lime and peanut butter and curry. I rated this on the sauce, because I don't have a grill, and had to improvise another method of cooking.  I cubed the chicken and lightly sauteed it, and added the peanut combination, which sort of melted into a thick sauce. I added a couple of extra  squirts of Joe and Nellie's Key Lime juice (the best!) and a bit of Mirin and water until it was more of a sauce. Also only one tsp. of soy sauce. Crunchy peanut butter worked well, too. Cooking for one, I only used one small chicken breast. I served it with rice, not my usual lemon-y rice, but lime-y rice, maintaining the theme - zest and  lime juice. I usually add broccoli or white corn or peas to to the rice to make a protein, starch and vegetable, two-pot meal.  I have enough sauce for a second day, and I love it!

This was a nice change from all the other grilled chicken recipes, and it was very quick and easy. It was good, but really lacked  flavor, in spite of the ingredients. I made the sauce as written, but it was way too thick to be applied, so I added additional soy. I'll consider making this again, but with changes.

This was delish, my husband and I loved it! I followed others' advice and make extra sauce for dipping afterwards, which is a must. I had to add a little water to thin out the sauce, which could've been because I used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy. I also marinated the chicken in the sauce for several hours beforehand. We'll definitely be making this again and again!

used 8 thighs , and added the extra soy as recommended, even the ginger  and suger for the noodle sauce , I made 5x's the sauce and it was not enough  for  noodles and dipping.  I'm not so sure the flavor was worth the trouble , certainly not a highly flavorfull dish . BF liked it  though .

I cut the chicken in strips and cooked in Smart Balance margarine in a frying pan until browned. I used Siracha instead of pepper and added sauce mixture  to the chicken and coated the chicken. It was wonderful. Even my husband liked it.

What a delicious recipe! For four chicken breasts we doubled the sauce and it was just enough. Make sure you increase the sauce for this recipe.  Ps. If you have leftovers of this dish you'll be happy to eat some more of this goodness the next day.

I definitely agree with the others who have reviewed this recipe, in that it is ~very~ thick.
The flavours are quite nice however, so I will use this recipe as a base, and add to it according to how and what I'm cooking in the future.

My family really liked this!  I added a touch more curry (just because we like curry) and cooked in the over under the broiler because it is too cold here to grill out!  I did microwave the sauce slightly to thin it out to ease basting.  Good good good!

My family loved this recipe served with a cold Vietnamese noodles. I did alter the recipe a bit. 1. I did not have curry powder so I omitted it; 2. I thinned out the sauce a bit with water; 3. I have a hatred of peanut butter with added salt/sugar (I won't get on my soapbox about that!) so had to add in about 1.5 tsp of brown sugar to the sauce.  I marinaded the chicken breast in the sauce for 30-45 minutes before grilling.  I will definitely be adding this into the meal rotation

Very tasty. Definitely use smooth peanut butter though. The sauce is very thick. I ended up rubbing it in with my fingers. Don't have a traditional grill, so burnt mine slightly, however the taste was still amazing. The lime juice and the curry powder make for a great compliment of flavors.

What a fantastic recipe idea. Ingredients were basic and easy to make. I also increased the recipe for the sauce quite a bit and chilled it in the fridge for an hour. Then I seared the chicken thighs for a few minutes and then simmered for another 30 mins. What a hit!  Will be trying this recipe again no doubt!

I made extra and marinated the chicken in it.  I quadrupled the recipe for the sauce and used some to baste the chicken as I barbecued it and used the rest on spaghetti noodles with some Asian style vegetables.  We like spicy food so I added sriracha sauce until I found it spicy enough.  Great recipe, thanks.

Loved it. Did not have curry, but it turned out great without! I agree that the sauce was too thick so I added water and I also doubled that part of the recipe. 
I also took another reviewer's advice and used the extra sauce as a dip. Just added some brown sugar and heated it on the range for a few minutes. 
Awesome over rice.

I increased the sauce by 4 then thinned it out with a little chicken stock to make a really thick paste. I put 1/2 a tablespoon of mix on each side of 8 chicken thighs. I then put 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock and 4 tablespoons of soy in a baking dish, placed chicken on a rack over the stock and baked for 40 minutes. I then used the pan juices to make a sauce with the remaining paste mix. It was outstanding!!! Adults and children all licked their plates.

The sauce was very think. I added a little more soy sauce but when I put it under the broiler it melted and the flavor absorbed into the chicken so it was fine. I'll make this again:)

All 5 family members approved this chicken recipe. 3 are picky kids. This chicken came out very moist. Grilled it and it turned out awesome! I did water it down with some extra water and soy sauce. I didn't have lime juice, so I used 2 drops of lime essential oil that I had on hand. Easy to throw together this sauce!!! Will try it again when we go camping next time.

Delicious! I used quick oats and only soaked them in skim milk for long enough for me to mix up the rest of the ingredients. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I plan on making a lot of these!!

This was delicious, although I did tweak it just a bit and will tweak it a bit more the next time I make it.  I doubled the soy sauce and lime and added 2 cloves of garlic, omitted the curry, replaced the cayenne pepper for black pepper and I thinned the sauce of with some water.  I really enjoyed it as well as hubby and my 3 year old.  Next time I think I will add even more lime and spice it up just a bit more.  This is going to be a regular dish served in my house!!

I doubled the recipe and spread it on thick on some lean cut boneless pork chops and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes and it was super yummy! My fiance loved it too! (use low sodium soy sauce or it will be to salty)

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly and added 1/2 a teaspoon of chicken stock to the mixture to easily spread it on the chicken. Then I made a separate double batch of the mixture and mixed it in with some thin spaghetti (as a previous follower suggested) grilled veggie and fresh parsley. Again, I added in about a table spoon of chicken stock and a table spoon and a half of lime juice into the spaghetti (also added about 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water). Delicious!!

Wow!  This was really fantastic!  What a perfect antidote for the same old boring chicken recipes. This is definitely going into "the rotation"! Thanks to other reviewers, I tripled the recipe for the sauce and it was just exactly enough. I did an assortment of thighs, legs, and breasts (10 pieces total). The only changes I made were for cooking method. I parboiled the chicken then moved them to a greased broiler pan. Brushed with sauce, broiled 7 minutes, turned, brushed with remaining sauce and broiled an additional 7 minutes. The sauce caramelized beautifully. Nothing burned. Served with grilled Bok Choy and carrot-coconut soup both from this site.

When you have had the real peanut sauce that goes with satay, this was an incredible disappointment.  At least to me, this tastes nothing like that.  I'm glad I tried the sauce before applying it to the chicken.

This was a very easy dish to prepare and the taste was very good.  It was a little less "peanutbuttery" tasting than I would have thought, but still very tasty.

I doubled the glaze recipe, as suggested by others.  I also heated the glaze.

I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe. I was going to follow this recipe exactly as it calls for, but when I saw for myself what reviewers were talking about the sauce thickness, I added more soy sauce and chicken broth to thin it out. I only had cubed chicken breast instead of breast halves, so that's what I used. All in all, this meal was just 'ok,' but not what I was looking for. I don't know, this may very well be an authentic Thai (or some other) dish, but it just wasn't for my taste buds.

The sauce has a very strong lime flavor but I love lime so I did not mind it, I omitted the curry powder and decided to add a teaspoon of Splenda and it turned out great. I didn't have any charcoal for the grill so I decided to just broil the chicken and it still came out great. I recommend making this recipe with crunchy peanut butter instead.

Recipe was mighty good, BUT, it could use a little extra oomph!  We added broccoli (would like to also try sugar snap peas), crushed peanuts, and some chopped green onion.  Yum!  Will def make again!!

I really wanted to like this....but even with all of the strong/flavorful ingredients, I found this to be so tasteless.  It just seemed like I spread some peanut butter on a peice of chicken and called it a day.  I may try this again but not without some serious tweaking.  Thanks anyway :)

I was a little hesitant because of other reviews. I did add some water to thin out the sauce. We did make extra sauce to use while it was grilling. It turned out wonderful, and did not have a strong peanut butter taste. I will make this again for sure. YUMMY!

Pretty good flavor.  It does have a strong peanut butter, but does well with the chicken.  I doubled the sauce and then split it to use half to brush the chicken and the other half to use for dipping the chicken after it was prepared.  The sauce during preparation starts out thick, but stir it a little and let the peanut butter sit in the liquid for a few minutes then stir some more.  It will thin out and become more manageable while still following the recipe.

I made quite a few changes based on other reviewers. I added brown sugar and water to the peanut sauce and that made it taste better and made it a better consistency. Also, since people said that the peanut sauce burnt or dripped off during grilling, I just seasonded the chicken with garlic, salt, pepper, and curry. I used the peanut sauce as a dipping sauce after the chicken was grilled, which worked well. I paired this with the Thai Cucumber Salad - nice match.

I baked my chicken in the oven, made extra sauce and served it over pasta. I thinned the extra sauce with water, and I used full-fat peanut butter so it was very rich, but I'll definitely be making it again!

This was good, but had a little bit TOO much of the peanut butter flavor. It seemed to need some sesame oil or something to make it less sweet. I'll still make it again, though.

I'm giving this four stars because my husband loved it -- for me, it was just so-so.  I like my own peanut chicken recipe better, however we didn't do this on a grill because we don't have one, and I think the recipe could be delicious grilled!  Like everyone else, I wanted more sauce to serve it over rice, so I ended up adding a lot of water to the pan to try and make some sauce.  Next time, I will try grilling the chicken, andtweak the sauce recipe to be more similar to my own (which uses coconut milk).  To me the lime-y flavor was a little strong, and I love lemon/lime!  Also adding just a touch of brown sugar is a must for this Thai-type recipe!  I also added just about a tsp. of red curry paste (go easy on that if you don't like hot!).  I think I might add just a Tblsp of fish sauce next time to add a little flavor.

Suprisingly lovely! I was nervous cooking this, but it came out great. It also makes a great flavoring for the pasta! I think I might even make the peanut sauce jsut to eat on pasta!

Definitely make extra sauce as a lot of people are suggesting.  I used chicken broth to thin the sauce slightly.  After brushing the chicken I thinned the remaining sauce with coconut milk.  My guests were really impressed!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have always loved peanut sauce on grilled chicken, so I was anticipating something really great.  This recipe wasn't the one I'll keep using, mainly because the peanut sauce turned into kind of a dried-out "paste" rather than a true peanut sauce.  The flavor was pretty good, but not great, and I really didn't like the texture.  I won't be making this one again.

Very easy, very tasty. Definitely a keeper. I made it with regular instead of low-fat peanut butter, because that's what I keep on hand. I made it as kebabs but next time will try it with thinly-pounded chicken breasts and will serve over fresh spinach like they do in Thai restaurants.

I'll have to try this again following some of the other review suggestions... Making extra sauce for dipping (thinned by adding some water) and adding the brown sugar only to the dipping sauce portion to prevent burning of the sauce on the grill. 

The sauce tasted good though!

It was interesting. We cleaned our plates, but I probably won't make it again. There were just too many flavors going on at once-- peanut, lime, spiciness from the cayenne, curry . . . it was an overload. (And the sauce wasn't too aesthetically pleasing.  Looked like the inside of a diaper!)

EDIT:  The next day the flavors mellowed out a lot, and it tasted much better!

I read the reviews before I made this but I did not care for this recipe.  The sauce was extremely thick and hard to spread and ended up sticking to the grill so when the chicken breasts came off, there was no sauce left.  I'm sure there are better recipes like this out there.  Glad others had better luck than me.  Maybe on the stove it would be better.

This is a tasty recipe - I used regular peanut butter (it's all I had) so added 1 tbsp of water to thin it out. I pounded the chicken breasts, which meant the cooking time was as indicated. I used all the sauce on 3 chicken breasts, so will double next time so there is some for dipping.

This was ok. I thinned the sauce as well, as it just didn't come together well without some liquid. I didn't put any curry in, but I don't think that would have changed my opinion. Will probably keep looking for good grilled chicken recipes.

The sauce smelled great, but was a little thick to spread on the chicken. I didn't dilute it too much, because I didn't want to 'mess up' the recipe. 

But, I ended up baking it instead of grilling it, maybe that's why this didn't work out for me.

I was so disappointed with this recipe. The marinade lacked flavor, and I didn't taste the peanut butter at all. I had to add salt. Today I'm using the rest of this chicken cut up on a salad.

I tried marinating the chicken in a batch of the peanut sauce and then making another batch to baste it in while grilling but for some reason I could hardly taste the sauce after it was done cooking. The sauce had great flavor so I thought it would turn out. I did use reduced fat peanut butter. Maybe that was the problem.

It is hard for me to rate this recipe because I really adapted it.  After grilling the chicken I wrapped it up with tomato, lettuce, provolone, and a soy may combination.  Was a good party appatizer with an interesting twist.  I think I would have prefered the chicken had I stuck to it the way the recipe says

This was wonderful!  My husband loved it, and he doesn't like chicken!  It has a wonderful flavor, so don't let the peanut butter freak you out!  It has just the right amount to be perfect.  I think the next time I make this I will prepare it just like the recipe says, but afterwards I'm going to use a breading on it to make it more crunchy.  But the recipe as is is great!

I loved the blend of peanut and curry with some other stuff thrown in.

Although I didn't grill the chicken,the 
sauce/paste didn't stay on the chicken.
I could barely taste it. This recipe didn't work for me.

this was great, I modified it by using Worcestershire instead of soy sauce. Came out great.
