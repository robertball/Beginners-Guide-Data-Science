Made as written except that I cut back to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon because a little goes a long way in this house and I grilled instead of baked. Not really sure how to rate this because I did not care for it but my husband loved it. The espresso beans did give it a deep rich flavor but just overpowered it for me. Again, he thought they were excellent. If you are a coffee lover then you should give this a try and see what you think.

Delish...made it with a roast. The coffee and chilly flavour was perfect.

It wasn't too great. Tasted like cinnamon coffee and nothing else. Also, my steaks we're undercooked and not crusty, and I cooked them for an extra few minutes, including some time under the broiler. Didn't live up to expectation.
