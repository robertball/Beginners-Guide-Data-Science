I have used this dressing for a few years now and my family raves about it.  I use it on macaroni salad, spinach salad, and cole slaw.  It is just the right amount of sweet/tart and is always a hit!

I am a weight watcher so I used light Mayo and 1% milk and it was still very good.  This is a keeper in my opinion!

I have been looking for the perfect dressing for a chicken and strawberry salad and this is it. Finally! I have purchased every poppy seed dressing or dry mix for years only to be disappointed by the overpowering flavour of raw onions and the presence of odd ingredients like dried flowers or Worcestershire sauce. I made this recipe with skim milk and substituted two tablespoons of the sugar for honey because I love the honey and mayo combo in dressings. Thanks for posting paralee; I know this will become a regular in my house. Yummy!

Yummy dressing and at a fraction of the cost of the bottled stuff.  So easy to make!  Thanks for the great recipe, paralee!!  

I substituted Splenda for the sugar (two diabetics in the house)and rice vinegar for the wine vinegar and served it with a spinach and strawberry salad.

Delicious!  I am tired of store bought bottled dressings and I was looking for a simple poppy seed dressing to make with things on hand- this was it!  I scaled back the recipe to only 4 servings.  I used lowfat/light mayo, 1% milk, and cider vinegar (no white wine vinegar).  I used the dressing on a mixed spinach, lettuce salad with strawberries, left over roaster chicken, feta cheese, and almonds- I kept telling my husband this is the best salad I ever ate...Definitely I will make this one again.

Great dressing and easy, too!  My favorite quick and easy use:  A pre-bagged coleslaw (or broccoli slaw) with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds mixed in.  Yum!

Fast and fab. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, which may have made it a little thinner, but love it.

I was looking for a poppy seed dressing to replace the high cal/high fat dressing that comes pre-packaged in the Costco "Sweet Kale Salad" bag mix. To make it low fat, I subbed Greek yogurt for mayo and cut back a bit on the sugar (@ 1/2 cup instead of 2/3). I also added a few shakes of onion powder and onion flakes. But this recipe has good proportions and would be delicious in its original full fat version as well, I am sure.

Used this on a fall Apple salad for a community fall festival.  Huge hit , brought home an empty 3 gallon bowl    The salad was made from red and green apples, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries and finely chopped pecans.   The dressing had just enough sweetness to cut the tart of the fruit. Sent out a mass email to 182 people for the recipes for both the salad and the dressing.  Thanks so much for sharing.

The recipe was delicious.  The women couldn't stop eating.  They licked the bowl clean, manners aside.  I thought the dressing was delicious and could easily be made in smaller quantities.  I will cut back on the sugar, especially for a salad with sweet fruit.

I made this recipe and have used it for a green salad and also for coleslaw.  It is the best poppy seed dressing that I have tried. It's a keeper.

This recipe was great! I cut back on the sugar and poppy seeds, but it had a nice texture and was perfect on a fruit spinach salad!

Love this on greens with fruit & nuts (just had it on spinach with fresh picked raspberries & toasted almond slivers).  To make it a little healthier, I use low fat mayo & skim milk.  Also add a little more milk to thin it out a little.

Great dressing!   I cut it in half as there are only 2 of us.  Got some good ideas from other reviewers as to what you can use it with. Easy to make, never will I buy the bottled stuff again. I used light mayo and 2% milk. Still excellent and saved a few calories.

Went to Aldi's for the Poppy Seed Dressing and grapes to complete a Suddenly Salad add on recipe. No dressing, so decided to make my own. I cut the milk out to make it thicker and it turned out perfectly. Great recipe.

Based on previous reviews, I used half the sugar, thinking I could always add more if needed.  We still found it to be too sweet, but the snap of the vinegar was perfect.  If I make it again, even less sugar . . .

I didn't have white wine vinegar, but I did have some red wine vinegar. I was a little concerned that it would turn pink, but it really didn't. I used just a few more drops of vinegar for the taste, because it was just a bit too sweet. I will be using this again for sure!

Only used 2 T of vinegar instead of 1/4 C because I don't care for too much vinegar.  Used half and half in place of milk. Used Truvia in lieue of sugar. Deelish!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it almost just as written but used fat free half and half instead of whole milk (didn't have whole milk.)  I will make this anytime I need a similar dressing.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I absolutely loved loved loved this recipe, and is better than any I have bought in the store. I have been searching for a delicious dressing and finally found one with this recipe and thank you paralee for posting it. I hate when people make changes to someone recipes and now here I am, one of them, sorry, but also am happy that people do sometimes because it gives me ideas of how to maybe improve the recipe, so hope I do not offend you, because it is very delicious.  But instead of the sugar I added 1/3 Cup of Agave and only 1 TBSP of poppy seeds and that seemed at least to me sweet enough and enough of the poppy seeds. Maybe next time I make it I will use some Greek yogurt to maybe make it thicker and add some protein, but over all it was delicious! Thank you for posting.

Good, used 1/2 the sugar, and substituted half and half, used canola based mayonnaise.  Love it.
