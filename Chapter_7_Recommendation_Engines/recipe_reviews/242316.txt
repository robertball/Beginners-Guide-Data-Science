Mine turned out more than soupy. It didn't thicken up at all. Wish I didn't waste my time or money on this one.

Made as written and the taste is good but it still turned out a little soupy even though my cauliflower was dry. Next time I will either increase the flour or add less milk.

The ingredients proportions are totally off! Don't waste your money with this recipe like I did.
