I was a little bit skeptical about this recipe after reading the reviews, but this loaf turned out great for me!  I thought it was one of the best bread machine recipes I have made so far.  I did substitute 4 tablespoons of sugar for the honey and I also used 1/2 a teaspoon more of Cinnamon.  I loved the texture of the bread and enjoyed the taste as well.

This recipe is really good, its only problem is that it needs more than 3 cups of flour. I added about 1/2 to 1 cup extra, and it turned out great!

This is a fantastic cinnamon raisin bread recipe.   I've had my breadmaker for a few years now and after using it a few times, I put it away because the bread it made was always too dry. Canadian all purpose flour is much different from US all purpose so it wasn't the type of flour~ I finally figured out it was the amount. Anything over 3 cups for a 2lb loaf is too much!   Anyway, this bread turned out to be moist and delicious! It wasn't too moist, it turned out like the SunMaid Raisin Bread I buy from the grocery at $4.99 a loaf. So...sorry SunMaid, I no longer need you anymore. The only things I did differently with this recipe was added an extra tsp of cinnamon and soaked my raisins for about half an hour before adding them to the cycle. Everyone LOVED this bread and I make it weekly now. Our favorite way of eating it is to slice a very thick piece, (we have a wide-slice toaster) cutting the piece in half and popping it into the toaster. YUM!   Thank you for this recipe, it's the best cinnamon raisin one I've found :)

I would run as far as you can from this recipe, not only did it taste awful, but the recipe is way off from where it should be. I wasted time making this one

This is a good base recipe but I found I have had to make a lot of changes to make the perfect loaf.  First off, CUT BACK on the yeast, both times I have made this the bread has risen to the steam vent. I stuck a knife in it it so it would settle back down, which makes a dense loaf (ok - just heavy).  

I also didnt have honey on hand either time and substituted brown sugar for the honey. I also add 2 additional tblsp of cinnamon and another 1/2 cup of flour.

My kids love this bread, but only if spread with butter and a sprinkle of sugar.  It is not a real sweet bread but it is flavorful and good toasted with sugar and butter.

This is an ok recipe but I think I will keep searching for the perfect one without all the changes/additions/deletions.

Excellent recipe but I also added more cinnamon - a total of about 2 tsp. It looks batter like but turned out great! I took it to work and it has been very popular. I'm making a loaf right now! Very light and airy.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  But, as a previous poster noted, I also had to add an additional 1/4-1/2 cup of flour.  Using the original recipe measurements made more of a batter than a dough.

I love the honey in this recipe - it really adds a great flavor!

Makes a HUGE 2 lb loaf.

I used 2 cups white flower and one wheat (all a little heaping) and it turned out great.  I  also used milk and the egg right out of the fridge and it didnt seem to matter.  Could use more cinnamon though.

I did this on the delay timer so the kids would have fresh bread in the morning.  I put the raisins in on top, careful not to let any touch the yeast so the fruit sugar wouldn't activate it.  The raisins were fine and it was good bread, even better toasted.  I would like to add more cinnamon, but it too much could cause the yeast not to rise correctly, and rather than throw the ingredients away, we'll just sprinkle some on the the butter after it's toasted.

Great recipe. I made a few changes I flattened it down after and put a butter, brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and rolled it jelly roll style. Then let it rise for 30 - 40 minutes and baked it at 350 for 35 minutes. With these changes definitely 5 stars!

I tried the recipie and it was wonderful. I took the advice of other members and I added a little more cinnamon, raisins, and flour and worked really good. The bread was tasty and really soft and moist.
For other users: don't pay attention to the bad reviews of the recipie. People who did it probably did not follow the instructions properly. I don't see how you could go wrong if you follow the recipie.

I just purchased a bread machine recently & couldn't wait to try cinnamon raisin bread.  This recipe was perfect!!  I set my machine on light crust, sweet bread & a 1.5 pound loaf.  I didn't have any bread flour so I used all purpose flour & added an extra 1/4 tsp yeast.  The loaf turned out to be about 2 pounds but it was so moist & light, it could't have turned out any better.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This is one of my favorite bread recipes!  I doubled the cinnamon.  I've had bad experiences in the past with honey in breads so I followed another user's suggestion to use 4 TBSP sugar instead of the honey.  The dough was sticky but I didn't add extra flour and the bread was very moist.  I used half of the bread for french toast, YUM!!

This came out great - I was a bit worried, as the dough was quite wet/gummy, but it baked up perfectly.  Next time I think I will add a bit more cinnamon.

Great recipe, have made it maybe 6 times now since I bought my first bread machine 2 months ago. 
I make it with organic 1/2 white bread flour or sometimes all white organic bread flour and it's lovely both ways! 
Tip take the dough out when it beeps (the hook will prob come out too, that's ok, do NOT turn off the machine, let it keep kneading with nothing inside) and quickly flatten it out on the counter, sprinkle your raisins all over and press in, then roll the whole thing up and give it a few kneads, put the hook and dough back in the machine and let it finish. That way the raisins are perfectly distributed. They do NOT mix in well enough by sprinkling them in. 
Another tip, if your bread does not brown on top like mine, rub a little butter all over the top when it's done, and broil it for 2/3 mins, it'll be lovely and brown and a lot more appetising!
Also! I make mine on the express setting (only 1 hour!!) on my Oster machine. Turns out perfectly :)

although its NOT horrible, its still not GREAT. Its more like wheat bread with a dash of cinnamon. If the brown sugar was upped and there was a boat load more raisins this would be spectacular. Ill try some modifications.

Made this bread to use for french toast (Fluffy French Toast recipe from this site).  Used 2-1/2 cups bread flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, & 1/4 cup quick oats.  Doubled cinnamon.  Big rise with  a nice texture & flavor.  Was perfect for french toast!

We loved this recipe! I even went so far as to make some cinnamon honey butter to go with the bread. My boyfriend, who is the pickiest eater you might ever find, loved this bread. I'm making some today for my family to try. Definitely one to put in the recipe box. Yum!

I had a few problems with it mixing (flour just sat on top undisturbed), so it didn't really rise either. I'm not sure whether it was a bread machine error or I did something wrong (not sure about that since all I did was dump it in the order listed). In the end, I guess it worked, but the flavor wasn't dynamic enough for me to attempt a second time. Good, but not great.

I actually don't have a bread machine so I used my Kitchen Aid to make this bread. I used evaporated milk in this recipe. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the sugar, honey and warm milk for ten minutes. I then added the rest of the wet ingredients, then the dry and the raisins. I didn't have enough raisins to make a full cup so I used half dried cranberries. I needed another 1/2 c. of flour to get the dough to pull together into a solid ball. Once it did, I kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. I set the dough to rise in a greased, covered bowl on a warm heating pad until it doubled. Instead of adding the cinnamon to the bread, I made this into cinnamon swirl bread with 1 tbsp. melted butter spread on the dough and sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the butter before rolling up. I then buttered a large loaf pan, set the bread in and drizzled a little melted butter over the top and set it to rise again on the heating pad. Once it doubled, I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes. It seperated a little where the layers met but I think it was due to me not sealing the layers well enough. (I have a heck of a time getting the rolled bread to stick together once it's rolled!) Good tasting bread, fun to make into a cinnamon swirl loaf. I think next time I might take another reviewer's suggestion and soak the raisins before adding them to the dough and maybe adding a little vanilla.

Excellent!  I was very pleased with the texture and crust of this bread.  It was the first time I used my bread machine for a sweet bread.  Taking a tip from another review, I also soaked my raisins in a little vanilla but other than that I followed the recipe.  A keeper!

I make this bread every week and eat it for breakfast.  It's very good, however, I doubled the amount of cinnamon as I love a lot of cinnamon!  Great recipe!

This recipe turned out absolutely PERFECT in my Oster bread machine! I used the same ingredients/amounts as given in the recipe, no more, no less, all liquids at room temp - it rised perfectly & the color, texture, & moisture were all perfect, too. The only thing I did differently was while the first knead & rise cycles were going I added about a tsp of water to the raisins to help break them apart (the water was absorbed by the time they were to be added during the 2nd knead cycle). I set my machine on the 1 1/2 lb "sweet" bread setting. I used "Better for Bread" flour, bread machine yeast, clover honey, & Vietnamese cinnamon. It's not a super-sweet bread dessert-like bread, the sweetness was perfect for my taste, yummy toasted with butter, & also can't resist nibbling on it absolutely plain. When I make this again (and I WILL!) I might or might not add more raisins depending on if I'm in the mood for "raisin bread" or "bread with raisins." This bread would make delicious French toast, though that'll have to wait for the next loaf as this on won't last until breakfast tomorrow. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Making this raisin bread strained and overheated my breadmaker. Much too dense a dough. Too much flour and not enough liquid. Had to remove from my breadmaker and knead by hand(something I hate doing) . More liquid(water) fixed the issue. Taste was good. Next time I would increase the liquid content  by 1/2 cup which should solve the problem.

This is an excellent recipe.  We love it.  I have been experimenting to make this healthier and find I can add 1/4 cup each of flaxseed meal & wheatgerm in place of flour.  (I'm going to try 1/2 cup of wheat flour this time) Also I use 1/8 tsp nutmeg & ginger.  Set machine on medium color setting.

This bread was very yummy...I put all the ingredients in the bread machine the night before so I could wake up and serve fresh made bread to my family,  It tasted good, except because I did not add the raisins when my bread machine signaled me to the raisins where not plump in the bread.  All in all very good and I will make it again, and try to add raisins when the bread machine beeps.

Good recipe, though I made a few changes to my bread. I put twice the amount of brown sugar and two cups of raisins rather than 1. I also added about 3 teaspoons of cinnamon rather than 1.

I have made lots of cinnamon raisin bread, but I do think this is by far one of the best. The only thing I altered was plumping the raisins in the microwave for a few minutes with a little water and about a tsp. of cinnamon. Let cool before adding to dough. I also added a little extra cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I prefer to do my breads on the dough cycle and then form and put in pan to raise the second time before baking in oven.

I followed the recipe except increasing the cinnamon to 2tsp., and substituting 1 c. of wheat flour for white, and it turned out great -- light, airy, moist, and delicious.  It did not raise too high, and was not too much flour, as other reviewers have suggested.  I should add that I live in a very dry area, so I usually have to add extra liquid to bread recipes, but in this case I didn't.

Followed the recipe as written except that I substituted 2c AP flour and 1c whole wheat flour for the 3c bread flour.  The bread turned out pillow soft and subtly sweet.  Next time I might bump up the cinnamon and raisins to really punch those flavors.  I think I have definitely found my new go-to bread recipe!

Delicious! I used 3 1/2 c. of bread flour per the recommendations of others; it was a perfectly sized loaf and had a nice "bready" taste and texture. This will be a staple in my bread machine rotation.

Fantastic cinnamon raisin bread! I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had to make any changes. I took the suggestion of marinating my raisins (in vanilla and a little dark rum), which made them taste great! I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and an extra 1/3 of a cup of raisins. As well, I cut down the yeast to 2 teaspoons, which was I was thankful for later, because it still made a huge loaf, rising past the top of the bread pan. It made great french toast this morning, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. A big hit with everyone, and I will be making another loaf today, as a gift to my parents for the bread machine :)

The was the first recipe for a sweet bread that I tried and I really like how it turned out.  I didn't add any extra flour like others, but I like moist bread, and I wanted to see how it turned out the first time.  I did add 2tsp of cinnamon and 1 1/2 cups of raisins, though.  I also added ~1tsp of vanilla to my raisins and let them marinate for about 15 minutes until I added them to the dough.  Turned out delicious!  My dog ate about 1/2 the loaf after we had a couple slices, so I had to make it again...same great results!

I thought that this bread was great. It is a nice raisin bread.  Great for toast or just with butter for a treat.  My family loved it!  I am already making again for a friend.  The only thing I did the 2nd time is to add an extra Tablespoon of honey and brown sugar and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Otherwise we just love it!

Perfect, tender texture, and nice flavor! Came together and rose perfectly. I was able to swap out 1/2 C of the flour with whole wheat flour instead, and it turned out great.  I did increase cinnamon to 2 tsp. Thanks!

Just made a loaf of this yummy bread!  As others suggested, I used 2 t. cinnamon; substituted 4 T. white sugar for the honey, used unsalted butter, 3/4 t. salt (trying to cut back on sodium!), the egg was a large and soaked the raisins for 10 minutes. I needed no extra flour.  I've been "proofing" my bread machine yeast for 10 minutes with the liquid and sugar - my new bread machine seems to turn out better results this way.  This bread is soft, lightly sweet, with a nice hint of cinnamon and simply DELISH!

I added more cinnamon, just for personal taste as we love this spice, but otherwise followed pretty much all other ingredients. I start the yeast with a cup of warm water and 2 tbsp. of white sugar in the bread machine for 10 minutes first to allow it to bubble up, then added all the other ingredients and let it go, was fabulous, thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I followed the directions, except to add about 50% more raisins.  It  was just like the SunMaid bread.  I also made another loaf using dried cherries.  It was awesome!

I have tried several bread machine recipes and this is the best one so far.  I made it exactly as written except for the raisins.  It rose beautifully, had a nice crust and tasted really good.  I didn't have dark raisins so used golden raisins and it worked.  If you like a really distinct cinnamon taste, use a little more cinnamon.  I did not have to add more flour than stated in the recipe.  I will make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was great, it was super moist and my family loved it.  I did add a bit extra cinnamon but we like more cinnamon.  Very good recipe and so easy to do in the bread maker.

Tried this recipe this morning using a bread machine that makes a 1-pound loaf and for which I have no manual. I halved the recipe with the following exceptions: I used a whole egg (lightly beaten), not knowing how to use a half an egg; 1 TBSP of honey and 1 TBSP of dark brown sugar; 2 TBSP butter, softened; 1 tsp McCormick pumpkin pie spice (because I didn't have any cinnamon in the house); 1 3/4 cup bread flour; 1 tsp and a smidge of bread machine yeast; four lunchbox-size boxes of raisins that I soaked in warm water as the milk and egg came up to room temperature. Since my machine is a very basic one, I added all the ingredients at once (including the raisins, drained from the water) in the order given in the recipe. Also, as I buy bread machine yeast by the jar and keep it in the refrigerator, I measured it out and let it warm with the milk and egg (each in their separate measuring bowls until needed, of course). The end result was wonderful. However, I will make the following tweaks next time: I will make sure I have cinnamon and use a full teaspoon and maybe add a little nutmeg for depth. Also, I may go to two cups of flour; I noted the previous comments about how moist the dough was (more batter-like was the frequent comment), so I boosted it from 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of flour on this attempt. I may go to two full cups next time as this loaf was almost too moist.

I made this bread with my food processor and as with all my food processor breads, I added the liquid, milk, lastly and stopped adding when it started to form a ball.  This was less than the 1 cup in the recipe.  Which probably explains why so many people had to add more flour.  I increase the cinnamon as many do, and the bread is wonderful, quite sweet, in fact my friends call it my "cookie" bread.  It makes great toast in the morning!

I love cinnamon raisin bread and have been on a bread machine recipe kick. I think this recipe is great but I have spent the past week playing with it to get it just to my taste, specifically with regards to the raisins. First, definitely soak your raisins in cold water for about 20 minutes and before adding them, drain the raisins and toss them in a little flour. Secondly, I found that if I waited until the fruit alarm beeped at me just wasn't enough time to mix in the raisins and they would just end up with some mixed throughout but most were on the bottom of the bread. So, I started adding them about 10 minutes into the kneading cycle or 5 minutes before the 5 minute fruit alarm. It made a world of difference in how the raisins were dispersed throughout the bread.  I also have played with the white to wheat flour ratio but I found the more wheat flour made the bread a little more dense.  I also left my milk and eggs cold and melted my butter. I tried it just like the recipe states but when I did it made a smaller loaf.
Contrary to my review, this is a great loaf the way it is stated but like I said, I was just trying to adapt it to more of my tastes. Enjoy!

I would have given 5 stars but I altered it a little.  I used the 1 cup milk (cold), 3T butter, 4T sugar, 1T brown sugar, 1 egg (cold), 1t salt, 2t cinnamon, dash of Vanilla extract, 3C King Author bread flour, 1C raisins that I soaked in cold water.  I ran it on my machine on the 1.5 lb setting by mistake.  It was a tad chewy in the middle, but still SO SO good!  I immediately threw another batch in the machine.  This is such a great recipe!!!  I removed the honey only because my 8 month old is eating this too and they can't have honey this early.

My bread maker settings I used was (accidentally) 1.5lbs, sweet bread, light crust.  I added the raisins at the fruit and nut beep on my machine.

Bread turned out with a very nice texture and is extremely light and fluffy. Only thing that would have made it better is if had been a little sweeter. Its great for someone who doesn't really want a sweet bread, but I did.

This is the best recipe for cinnamon raisin bread that I've found! I didn't have any honey, so I ended up doing 2 tbsp brown sugar and 2 tbsp of maple syrup, and it's great. I was a little concerned after reading other reviews that it needs more flour, but I think it's perfect with just the 3 cups--the bread came out so moist and delicious and was easy to cut. Everyone loves it!

No sweet bread setting? I have a Panasonic YD250 and used the "Bake-Raisin" setting on light. Turned out perfect! I read the reviews and made 2 adjustments. I used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 and I also used 2 cups white flour with 1 cup wheat flour (all a little heaping). The bread turned out super!

Great Bread, although I made some modifications.

I increased the Cinnamon to 1 Tbsp and the Honey to 4 Tbsps and Brown sugar to 2 Tbsps.

My husband LOVES IT! and he's a super picky eater.

Pretty good, I will try a different recipe next time. I followed all the directions but it looked nothing like the picture and tasted like bread with a hint of cinnamon with some raisins scatter about.... I would add a little more cinnamon, raisins, and brown sugar... and next time won't bake it in the bread machine..

This bread is wonderful!! It makes me wonder if the people who gave poor reviews used quality ingredients? I teach adult ESOL in the evenings and I made a loaf of this yesterday afternoon, sliced it up, and left it sitting on the counter when I left to go teach. When I came home, my husband and 8 year old son had devoured 2/3 of the loaf! At least they left some for Mama. :) I followed the recipe as written except for two minor changes: I subbed 1 c whole wheat flour and, because of the reviews saying it was really wet, I added another scant 1/3 c wheat flour. I also increased the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp., but I may put more next time.

This bread is delish!  Like it states, not too sweet, so next time I may add a glaze.  The changes I made were minimal.  Since I didn't have bread machine yeast & only regular, for a 1.5lb loaf I added 2 1/4 tsp of yeast.  I also upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.

I'm not sure what some people did wrong but mine turned out perfect! I followed the original recipe but I did add an extra tsp of cinnamon. Mine didn't need extra flour but I did watch for it...it looked sticky and that it needed it but if you leave it alone and let it do it's thing it forms a ball and get's less sticky looking. The only problem I had was that it rose a little too much so next time I'll only put in just the 2 tsp's of yeast. But I think it's a great recipe and I'm definately going to make this one over and over again.

Although edible, this was the worst bread machine recipe I've ever tried.  It made a dense, fruitcake-like bread that was not nearly sweet enough.  We will use it for sandwich bread since it's not sweet.  I will upload my tried and true cinnamon raisin bread if I can find it.

Very yummy! Added a little more cinnamon, a little less yeast, a little more flour, and less raisins. Could use a few minutes less on the baking cycle - mine was a little brown around the edges. Will definitely make it again!

This was a pretty good raisin bread! I'm still looking for The Best Raisin Bread In The Machine recipe, but this one will definitely do in a pinch. I like cinnamon so I boosted that a bit, but aside from that, I stuck to the recipe, and what was left by the weekend was turned into marvelous french toast which my boys gobbled up.

This was the first non-box mix bread I ever made in my bread machine. The first loaf was a little dense so on the second I didn't add as much flour and it turned out perfect. 

I mixed the flour, salt, cinnamon and sugar in a bowl first. Then I put the butter, milk, egg and honey into the bread pan, added the flour mixture on top of that, then the yeast. At the beep I out in the raisins. 

Even my picky eater likes this bread. It goes great with cinnamon roll icing to dip it in.

I also felt the need to add a bit more flour and also more raisins and cinnamon as a personal preference. This turned out wonderfully, very moist and flavorful. I'm making extras to have on hand in the freezer.

I add a few more raisins just cause we're crazy about them.  Also no need to pull bread out immediately. I found it slightly doughy if I did.

This turned out really well. Moist and very attractive. I added extra raisins and a little more brown sugar.  The sides and bottom of the load were a bit too brown, but it seemed to make no difference in the taste - no burned taste.  I have a Breville Custom Loaf bread machine and I will see if I can alter the baking time just a little. This one is a keeper, especially for gifts to friends.

The texture and taste were great!  Can't wait to bake it again! I followed suggestions and used 1 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon.  Rather than using all sugar, I kept the honey and just added 1 T granulated sugar to the brown sugar.  Next time I will try raw sugar.  However, there was a problem.  When it finished cooking, the bread had a soft spot in the middle of the top and when cool it  sank in the middle.  I  fear more flour would affect the texture and moistness.  Rather, I think cooking time is the culprit.  I didn't  see any reference in the recipe to loaf size so I had to guess. I picked the 750 gram or 1.65 Lb. setting on my machine. Next time, I will bake it longer by choosing the bake option on my machine, rather than adding more flour or choosing the 2.2 Lb. size.

This recipe is delicious! My dough was busting out of maker so I chose to knead manually and then added the soaked raisins and then placed back in maker for remainder. Like others, I added much more cinnamon and may add more yet next time. Very moist and produced a large loaf.

Based on other reviews, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour plus more during kneading.  I also added 3 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of the 1 tsp shown in the recipe.  The second time I made this loaf, I added 4 cups of flour from the beginning, filling the measuring cup using a spoon rather than scooping the flour with the measuring cup to avoid compacting the flour.  There was no need to add more flour during the kneading process.  I also added 1 cup of craisins instead of raisins and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds when the bread maker beeped to indicate the time to add these final items.

We loved this bread. I have an old machine that makes a smaller loaf so I put it on the dough only cycle and kneaded it for a few minutes before putting it in a greased loaf pan. I also let it rise in the pan for about 20 minutes before baking it in a 350' convection oven for 35 minutes. I was worried because I ran out of bread flour so used all purpose. I turned out great, lovely texture. I will definitely make it again.

Loved this! Wonderful for toast as well. Only changes I made was I used almond milk as I didn’t have any dairy milk, used about 3 tsp of cinnamon, and 2-3 TBSP of brown sugar. Very nice, so soft and fresh! Will make again!

The bread was great, but I doubled the Cinnamon and added more raisins! We ate half the loaf as soon as it came out.

It didn't rise as much as we had hoped.

I did make some changes I soaked the raisins in dark rum for several hours. I used 4 TBSP brown sugar no honey and I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. All my ingredients were room temp. I did set it up on delay so it would be done baking in the morning. I made sure the yeast (1/4 packet of active dry ) was covered with a small amount of flour and placed the raisins along the outer edges of the pan, making sure no raisins were in the center where the yeast is.  This bread was very moist and flavorful.  I can’t comment on how well it stays as we ate pretty much the whole loaf in one day, however I don’t think it will last much longer than a few days even in the refrigerator. This does make a smaller size loaf, seems to be just the right amount for a family of 5 for a nice breakfast.

Made this recipe using suggestions from other reviews.   I doubled the Cinnamon and raisins.   I also soaked the raisins in water, and kneaded them into dough by hand when machine beeped. Then returned dough to machine for remaining kneading/ rise and baking cycles.  My husband said this bread was dangerous to have around since he liked it so much!

Following this recipe to the letter yeilds a somewhat bland result, but a moist and soft bread that is good for toasting and topping. Afterwards I added more raisins and cinnamon for a better taste that is great by itself. Note: I have a 2lb bread machine and this recipe overrises to touch the top of the machine, but still cooks all the way through (as is and with my personal adjustments)

I didn't have honey so I used molasses and I had set my machine to medium crust. I actually got a loaf that had risen really well. It was light and moist and excellent warm with some butter spread on it. The cinnamon in my opinion was the right amount and I don't think I will deviate from recipe next time I make it.

Sweet and soft and delicious. I make this recipe weekly it is so good.  Followed a few suggestions in reviews: I double cinnamon and soak the raisins for about 20 minutes or so. Super yummy.

This was delicious! I made it with the kids and it was very simple to make. On another reviewer's suggestion, I plumped the raisins in boiling water for 5 minutes, then strained them before adding them. The added moisture from the wet raisins required another couple tablespoons of flour to get the dough to continue mixing as a ball. Otherwise I made the recipe as specified, using the dough cycle on my bread machine. Then I formed the loaf, placed in a greased loaf pan, and let rise for another 40 minutes or so until doubled. Baked about 40 minutes at 350. The loaf is LARGE - it rose way above the top of my large-ish loaf pan. You could probably get two smaller loaves out of it as well. It's delicious, we are enjoying it toasted with cream cheese or butter!

I have been using a bread machine since the '90's and have been using the same cookbook since then too. I decided to try a new recipe and found this one. It is so much better than the old one, moister and tastier. I have made it twice; the first time I used 2 tsp of cinnamon, since my husband said it needed more cinnamon I used a Tablespoon like in the old recipe. The second loaf was much better. For a while this will be my go to recipe.

The texture of this bread is awesome it comes out the bread maker in great shape. From a personal taste perspective I think it could use a touch more sugar and a little more cinnamon . Some tweeking of the recipie to fit my tastes and my bread machine are needed but this a a real good bread machine recipe and the bread makes for a great snack.

This was a hit with the family. I added a little extra cinnamon, because I like it spicy, and I set my bread machine to dough because I wanted it shaped by a loaf pan. I rolled out the dough and added raisins and craisins, rolled up the dough and cut it in half, put in 2 loaf pans and  baked at 350 F for 45 minutes. Next time will be 40 minutes. Great dough recipe.

Changes: 
* Egg replacer instead of egg (food allergy concern) 
* 2 3/4 tsp of active dry yeast instead of bread machine yeast
* Raisins soaked in rum overnight instead of raisins

I thought that the 1 cup of raisins may be too much and would all collect at the bottom, but they were somewhat nicely incorporated into the bread. Cinnanon taste could be stronger, recommend 1/2 tsp more.

Overall I'm happy with the result but will continue looking.

Bread was easy to make nice and moist held together vey well.
I was surprised that someone said it was crumbly.
It did seem to need something.  I bought whipped cream cheese in a Mixed Berry flavor, it was perfect.
Bread disappeared.

OMG is it moist and just the right amount of sweet. It was pretty easy to make. I soaked my raisins in rum then after I added them the liquid content was up so I added a couple tablespoons of flour. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon after that to finish it.

Fantastic - this recipe produced a fluffy, delicious loaf of cinnamon raisin bread (in my 1.5 pound bread maker), on the very first try. The flavor is wonderful.  This is the first recipe ever to inspire me to write an online review. I will be using it again!

This is the 4th time I've made this delicious cinnamon raisin bread. It is great toasted for breakfast. I did make two changes: doubled the cinnamon and used only brown sugar, just because I love brown sugar.  I will probably be making this bread weekly til my bread maker gives out. 
Oops, almost forgot . . . I soaked the raisins in some really good Jamaican rum before adding. ??

I've actually made this 4 times, just lost the page and needed a new copy.  The only change I made was to add some cranberries with the raisins, or dried cherries, dates, or other dried fruit each time.  Love this recipe, and will make more tonight or tomorrow morning.  This time will soak fruit in wine and add immediately so it can all go in at the same time.

It's a good recipe. I took regular flour and add 4 tbsp of white sugar and 2 tbsp brown sugar and I found that it wasn't sweet enough to my taste so next time I will definitly add more of both sugars. As for the cinnamon I put 1 tbsp and I could barely taste it so next time I'll double and I put the raisins right at the start.

I have been using this recipe for years, and now am finally rating it. This bread is great for French toast, which is what I use it for. I put it in the bread machine before I go to bed, and wake up with great bread. I'm not a big fan of bread machine bread (I much prefer regular homemade bread), but for French toast this can't be beat. I do what other reviewers say and put in about 1 3/4- 2 teaspoons yeast and 3 1/2 cups flour. Yum!

I don't have an auto bread maker, I make all mine in a Bosch mixer and put in into loaf pans.  Because  I wanted 3  one lb . loaves (approx) I added a little extra.  I also always use a sourdough started (1/2 cup in this recipe) and add 1/2 cup oatmeal  with 1/2 cup water and microwave for 2 minutes and 50 % power and add to my mix.  I also use 2 whole eggs.  I increased the yeast and salt both to 2 tsp. and add 1/4 tsp soda to my wheat flour when mixing it in.  My wife is lactose intolerant so I used almond milk for the milk and I add 2 tbl ground flax seed for nutrition.  I always add 1 tbsp of wheat gluten to each cup of whole wheat flour.  So in total I used 2 1/2 cups wheat flour and 2 cups white flour and got my 3 loaves.  It turn out beautifully , really great flavor.  I cook my bread at 375 for 29 minutes (ovens vary).  Perfect.

My daughter and I made this last night and it turned out perfectly. I was a little scared after reading some of the negative reviews. I wonder if other people's issues were due to either 1)not putting the ingredients into their bread machine in the right order and/or 2)not setting the loaf size properly. Either way, it worked for us. I think next time, I might add more cinnamon b/c it wasn't quite as noticeable as I would like. Otherwise, very yummy and not too sweet.

Absolutely wonderful dessert bread. I and my family enjoyed it immensely.

Only thing that bears changing is adding a 1/4 tsp of salt and toning down the yeast.

Added a little more cinnamon and didn't have bread maker flour, so I used regular all-purpose. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Turned out great! My family loved it!

Recipe is great!  I have made it twice.  The first time I didn't bring the egg or milk to room temp and only added 1 cup of raisins (after soaking them in water for 1/2 hr) and bread was fairly dense.  2nd time I brought milk and eggs to room temp, increased raisins to 1 1/2 cups, 2 tsps of cinnamon...was much more moist and significantly less dense.  Easy recipe and tastes great.... Especially toasted with butter!

This bread is very delicious. I took the recommendation of others and  added 1/2 t cinnamon and also had to add 1/4 flour during the first kneed. I also soaked the raisin in hot water for about 10 min before adding. The  bread turned out perfect with great tast and texture.

Very good raisin bread.  I soaked the raisins over night in the milk.  I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoon.  Will make it again.

Great recipe!  I like to try a recipe EXACTLY as written before rating it.  Seems only fair that I rate the actual recipe not rate what I think it should be.  That said, in this case, I had all ingredients on hand except the egg.  I decided to go for it with the standard 1/4 cup applesauce substitute.  I am very happy with the outcome.  This bread is moist and has a great consistency.  It's not very sweet at all which is what I was hoping for.  This will be great for my kids to eat as a snack.  As a sweet snack, I think it would be really good with some butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon/sugar.  I can't say that I understand the reviews that say it's too much or too little flour.  The 3 cups made a perfectly textured bread.  Again, I followed exactly as written with the exception of having to sub applesauce for the egg.  I used my Emeril bread machine and loaded the ingredients in the order based on my bread machine directions ( which were a different order than listed).

Great, easy, simple recipe.  I added all the ingredients (including raisins; cause I used the timer in my bread machine) at the same time.  I also used more cinnamon because I love cinnamon. Turned out great.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I prefer to bake in the over so I allowed dough to rise in my bread pan then baked @ 350 for 35min....I also include a shallow pan of water under to steam  inside over. I used 2t cinnamon and soaked my raisins while the machine worked the dough then added raisins w an T of flour so the machine would grab it & work in. My family gobbled almost the whole loaf before school! Thanks for sharing!

Probably best bread recipe I've ever used. Followed advise and added another tsp +  of Cinnamon because I like it.  Also added more flour about 1/2 cup. I prefer to cook my breads in the oven so I cooked this large loaf @325 for 35 minutes-40 minutes might have been wiser. Even still, it was a HUGE hit.

Despite there being more raisins on the outside of the bread and bottom of my pan then in the bread loaf, it's really delicious!! I was skeptical at first due to the negative comments, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out and I didn't have to change a thing. Great recipe

I really loved it.  I don't own a bread maker so I did it the old fashion way of kneading, but it turned out fabulous and was gone in a day.  After punching it down I stretched out the dough and dusted a light layer of cinnamon on it before rolling the dough up to put in a bread pan which left a cinnamon swirl in the center and I used 1/4 cup less flour than required since I don't think hand kneading works it like a bread maker, but it turned out great and I will definitely make it again.  Maybe even today, nothing smells nicer than baking cinnamon.  Thanks

One of the first bread machine recipes I ever made. I would say, add half a tsp of cinnamon. It's also delicious if you use nuts instead of raisins if you feel like it!

Oh my gosh don't change a thing! So good and moist, this bread about drove me crazy waiting for it to be done! I did add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and I never use bread flour, just add 4 tsp wheat gluten to regular all purpose flour and voila, bread flour! I ate 2 pieces while still warm, slightly toasted with a couple slices of Colby Jack cheese. Can't wait to eat some with honey cinnamon butter later! Thanks for the recipe!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but wanted to mention that  I feel like the instructions are incomplete. What is to be done with the dough after the machine is done mixing it? I would like to try this recipe sometime.

This is an awesome recipe!  This was my first bread machine attempt and chose this yummy loaf.  Super moist and semi sweet.  Perfect for morning toast!  I did take the advise of one of the others on this post an added 1/4 cup additional flour.  I am at 4,700 feet so it worked out nicely!!

I made the changes that others had suggested. Putting in 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Adding 1/2 cup more flour.  It came out really good.  I made the dough in the bread machine then put it into a loaf pan, let it rise and then baked it.

yummy..straight from the bread machine.  I added 1 tbsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp, soaked the raisins in warm water then dried them, and had to add a little more flour. Wow it is good thanks for sharing.

Super easy, super soft and moist.  I followed some of the other users tips and doubled up on the cinnamon (2tsp) and also substituted the honey for 4 tbs sugar and it came out awesome.  The sweetness is perfect for a cinnamon raisin bread, I used my mom's homemade raisins which were huge so the one cup was enough to give the bread that yummy raisin oomph.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, I'm making another loaf tomorrow.

This made great bread! I often have trouble with raisin bread not rising enough in the bread machine, but this turned out perfect! The only change I made was adding an extra tsp of cinnamon.

I put everything in the bread machine with no fuss and this came out wonderful.  A good lite crust a fluffy top and a taste of a good bakery.  It makes a big loaf and it was just two of us so I made french toast with it a few days later.

This recipe is great! I have tried numerous raisin bread recipes and this turned out to be the best. I figure out that using honey in the bread ingredients makes quite some difference in the taste. Thx!

Very good but came out HUGE. I think it's due to the yeast, next time i will reduce it to just 2 teaspoons. I also soaked the raisins in a teaspoon vanilla extract and a drop of water and i doubled the cinnamon. Its a Very tasty bread. But I was looking for more of a moist dense bread, this is not it.

Awesome Bread Recipe! I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews too, but after making it it turned out perfect! It rose perfect and nice and soft easy as heck to cut thin slices and moist. I added a tablespoon of rye whiskey to the raisins while soaking them! Next time I will add more cinnamon though!

Used this recipe adding an extra tsp of cinnamon (love cinnamon!) and a bit more flour than called for--probably close to half a cup extra. Smelled so good I could hardly wait til it cooled enough to slice off a little chunk. When I did, I covered it with a tablespoon of cajeta and took a bite out of heaven.

This was pretty good. I added a little water when I added the raisins because they were just sticking to the outside of the dough. I used 4 tbs brown sugar instead of the honey. I added 3 heaping teaspoons of gluten and it came out really spongy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I might add more cinnamon next time.

I minded the advice and added an extra cup of flour and made it about two tablespoons of cinnamon. I also prefer to soak the raisins, which was not mentioned here you can soak them in water (I prefer rum). I also did not have a room temprature egg, so I warmed up the milk a bit in the microwave and hoped they balanced the temprature out... turned out great, bit hit with the fans.

I changed this up a little in the fact that I did not add an egg. I did about a half of this though, turned out great! It was gone faster than anything I have ever made. My boyfriend went crazy! Will do again SOON

I really liked this recipe, and would give the bread I made 5 stars!  I did however make a few changes.  I used 3 cups bread flour and 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I used 2 T. brown sugar, 1 T. white sugar and 1 T. honey, 2 T. cinnamon, and 1 1/2 cups of raisins.  Turned out great, sweet enough, but not too sweet.  Kids even love it!  Will be my breakfast all week!

I made this recipe mostly as written-I used unbleached whole wheat flour and added a little more cinnamon and raisins. Came out lovely! The entire family-especially my little girl-like it so much this will be the recipe I use from now on.

My family loves this recipe.  I tried a recipe for raisin bread that was in the bread machine manual and it was nasty.  I added more cinnamon, and also added about a tsp of sugar as well as the honey and it came out tasting REALLY good.  I'm actually getting ready to make another batch, but this time I'm going to bake it in my oven and see if it comes out a little softer.

This is the absolute best raisin bread that I have ever made. I let the bread machine do the dough and I bake it in a long loaf pan. It tastes wonderful and is very light and fluffy. What a wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing.

Really good bread. It was my first time makeing a sweet bread and I added the raises too early and they got all chopped up, but it was still yummy.  I will definately add more raisens next time and try applesauce instead of butter.

great!  I didn't have milk on hand, but 1 cup of warm water worked out fine.  No honey either so I put in a total of 3 tblsp of brown sugar.  And I doubled the cinnamon.  Out came a lovely loaf, not too sweet.  thank you!

The first time I tried this, it didn't work. After some research I figured out the reason why was because you have to use warm milk (110 degrees) and not room temperature! So the second time I made it had better results. Not bad for my first 
(really second) bread that I made with my new machine.
