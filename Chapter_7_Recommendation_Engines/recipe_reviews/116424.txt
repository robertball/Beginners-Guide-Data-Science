This was good, but I ended up adding 2 cups of powdered sugar rather than 6 T.  The mixture was just to runny to set up without the extra sugar, but at the end the taste is excellent. I think the amounts just need adjusted.

I thought this was going to be much more "putsy" than it was.  Going by previous reviews, I made sure the yolks were cool enough, and only used the recommended amount of powdered sugar and it worked great!  It's so silky and just the right sweetness.  I've found a new family favorite that I'll be using again and again!  Thank you for sharing!!

I've never made buttercream icing before buti checked out a few recipes before I settled on this one. I figured with the egg yolk custard and only one cup of suger it wouldn't be so sweet. I despise overly sweet frosting. I was right. It was perfectly sweet and so smooth. The taste was so light I loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. I had no lumpy eggs or runniness. If you constantly stir while its cooking it wont clump also keep stirring at least until its warm while you cool it.it'll get thicker when it cools. Beat the butter until its creamy then add half the egg mixture and beat, then ad the remaining mixture and beat till fluffy. I used 7 tblsp of powdered sugar just because it was for my lil brother's birthday cake and I wanted it just a Tad bit sweeter for him. I will be using this recipe for all my special birthday cakes. Thank you!

While this recipe is okay, it just isn't right. First, the minor problem of the color being very yellow. It is the color of butter, maybe a little more yellow than that even (from the yolks). Second, and most important, the consistency is that of whipped butter. It is so smooth and not super sweet and it really seems like mildly sweet butter more than frosting. The texture is so butter-like, that even if it was sweeter, it'd be hard to overcome the texture. It is not what I hoped for. An Italian Meringue Buttercream is a similar texture, but is white, and if you like this frosting, would be a good, colorless alternative. For what it's worth, the recipe makes roughly 4 cups.

although the only downfall is how long it takes for the sugar mixture to cool down, this is the best frosting I have made and it is always a hit when I make it for the family!

I didn't constantly stir the egg mixture while cooking, so I did get cooked bits of yolk. My bad. Other than that, the frosting was light and fluffy, but not quite as sweet as I expected, and you could taste the butter. But maybe that's how it's supposed to be with homemade butter cream. Everyone said they liked it, but they could have been being polite.

This was very good. Had a vanilla-custard-butter taste, must be from all the egg yolks.  You do need to refrigerate the frosting so the butter has time to solidify, so don't add extra sugar until you give it a chance to set! After I took it out of the fridge , I whipped it again for a couple more minutes, so buttery!  Yumo!

This was excellent!  I have never made icing like this before and I'm glad I gave it a try.  I used it on top of a chocolate cake and they went really well together.  I used vanilla paste instead of the extract which gave it the look of homemade vanilla bean ice-cream.  Will make again, thanks for the great recipe. :)

Could use more flavor. This frosting also turned out a little soft, but overall pretty good.

I almost gave a low review: I had problems with the egg whites lumping and for a moment thought about tossing the batter. But, I decided to stick to it and salvage the ingredients by straining the egg/sugar mixture. I also found mysef adding more confectioner's sugar because it just wasn't sweet enough for my taste (and I'm not too much of a sugar fan). Also, I didn't care for the slight egg smell that the frosting had prior to cooling in the fridge.  At any rate, I ended up loving he recipe. In fact, I wish I would have added a little less confectioner's sugar. It spreads well, refrigerates great and makes your cake taste so yummy! I made it for a white cake. I will use this over and over again. Ps: I cut the butter by 1/4 c. and increased the vanilla by 1/4 teaspoon.

This recipe is very buttery, tastes like sweet whipped butter. I would add more sugar or less butter if I made it again. Following the recipe to a T left it light and fluffy if you're looking for a frosting like that.

This is, hands down, the best buttercream frosting/icing I've ever made. Tastes great, smooth consistancy, Ices cake beautifully. May need to refrigerate a bit if you're going to pipe icing out of a pastry bag to decorate, though.

This did NOT work. Way too runny and it overall tasted nothing like buttercream. Way too much work for the end result.

I made this for my daughter and niece to frost their v-day cupcakes with. Followed the recipe to a T. Refridgerated the mixture for over an hour and while it did set a bit, it is still nowhere NEAR a frosting consistancy. It was a total waste of 6 eggs.

This is delicious and great for white cake.  We ended up adding about 12 tablespoons of confectioners sugar to make it less runny.  Also, we put it in the fridge for a little to let it set and that gave the frosting a better consistency.

I am a male in my 50's and never made frosting before that I can recall.  This is great stuff.  As I heated the egg yolk and sugar water I was concerned I would have fried egg.  I used a low heat and "voila".  I usually don't follow recipes closely either.  I did moreso here.  It's great!  It tastes and feels like I always wished frosting would.  You rock, baby!

This was a unappealing, unappetizing icing. I made it following the recipe to a T. I then began the Wilton buttercream recipe I know and love....don't think I will be trying something new for a little while now....

Let's start by saying that I am a college student that is in a tiny apartment kitchen on campus. This recipe was amazing. We did not get it to become fluffy but two reasons are behind it. We melted the butter by accident and we had no electric mixer. So the mixing that was supposed to be ten minutes long ended up being around 45 minutes of arm cramping whisking intermixed with periods of it being in the freezer.

All in all, great recipe, even if you have to hand mix it!

My eggs cooked up a bit, maybe lack of stirring "constantly"...I'm not sure.  Though it really didn't inhibit the flavor at all.  You could just see speckles of egg in my frosting.  I used on top of a one bowl chocolate cake from this site and shared with my mother for her birthday...she said thanks!

I used this frosting along with the Black Walnut Cake (from this site).  The frosting taste great, a bit runny, most likely it was something I did wrong. I have never made icing like this before, but I will make this again.  The next time, I will not use as much butter as the recipe states.

Maybe I did something wrong?  I think I followed the recipe, but it came out as yellow goo.  Tasty yellow goo to be sure, but goo nonetheless.  I have trouble calling this icing, even after refrigerating, therefore it gets a 2 star rating.
