I loved this dish especially the slaw! Very easy to whip up and it makes a lot of slaw. I plan on using my leftover slaw for some pulled pork sliders. I added some extra Cajun seasoning to the fish breading, but other than than I followed the recipe pretty close.

These turned out great as written and the chipotle and cilantro in the slaw was a nice change. Bonus is that the leftover piece of fish I had stayed crispy in the fridge overnight which is something you will not get with a deep fry.
