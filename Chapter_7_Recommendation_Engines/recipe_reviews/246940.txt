It was very easy  and quick.  I didn't have instant coffee so I used  2 tablespoons of strong black coffee instead of water. It tasted very good and had a cake like texture. All I was missing was a big scoop of coffee flavored ice cream and some Hershey's syrup (next time).  I will make this again, it hit the spot.

Update - Second  time I used 2 tablespoons of caramel flavored (strong) black coffee. It was excellent, the flavors complimented each other.

This is a delicious snack. You can make variations of it by changing what kind of sugar you use! For example I tried powdered sugar and came up with a crunchy brownie.

I had a craving for a chocolate treat, but I’m the only one in the house that likes chocolate, so I thought the cake in a mug idea sounded perfect! I made this recipe as written today, but subbed brewed coffee for the water. After mixing, I thought it was still too dry, so added an additional Tablespoon of the brewed coffee. It took 1 minute + 15 seconds to “look dry on top” in my microwave.  After letting it sit a couple of minutes, I topped my cake with canned whipped cream. The result: YUM!!!  Thank you for this easy yet decadent recipe!! This will be my new indulgent chocolate treat.  I think crushed pecans might make a good topping, also - I might try that next time.

I had left over egg yolks from another recipe and saw other versions of this that used them. I wanted a recipe that used the cacao powder so I blended the 2 together. I used one egg yolk and just a little oil and water. Perfect!!!

This is a great basic recipe made of things I typically have on hand; additionally, try adding things like chocolate chips or chunks, marshmallows, etc.

I loved it!!! I’d put a little more sugar in because the bottom was less sweet, but that could be my mixing too.

Came out great. One of the best recipes out there. Before I would just be baking brownies of 16 servings just to get 1 serving for myself.

I made this to fit a 6 muffin baking pan. 
Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1 cup Cocoa Powder (I used Hershey's Semi-sweet Dark)
3/4 cup brown sugar (dark, I might try agave syrup for extra moistness)
3/4 tspn baking powder
1/4 tspn salt
3/4 cup vegetable oil
I started with 1/2 cup water then added more until the consistency was like muffin batter or pudding. The smooth with glossy finish.
1 tspn vanilla extract
(I cut out the coffee as I am not allowed to have that with my seizure medicine)

I baked the batter on 350F (175C) for 35 minutes in a large toaster convection oven. Until a dry clean knife poked into one of the brownies came out clean.

The only problem I had was I might have cut the time baking back a bit to leave the center a little gooier. While it was moist it was very "dry" crumbly. A few ideas on also making it sweeter is adding honey, either as an ingredient or as a glaze. Maybe milk instead of water, not sure how that will change the batter.

The benefit of this is that using the water, it is vegan friendly. If milk is used, find a source that is organic and does not use machinery if you are animal health conscience, or try a vanilla soy or rice milk. 

Was very delicious even with the crumbliness. This would do well used as a "volcano" type of batter once the outer edges and top were fully cooked and only a little of the knife came out with cooked batter on it. The brownies were gone before I thought of taking a picture of them.

When I first made it, it came out stodgy. When I made it again using self-raising flour, it tasted a lot better.

This brownie definitely exploded in my microwave. But as a plus it did still taste reallyyy good. I'm not sure what went wrong but I think I'll try again with a bigger mug or adding a lid.

It was a little dry although the batter was really watery, and it didn't rise fully into the bowl, forming a flat brownie, but otherwise I liked it. It's a good recipe for needing fast brownies.

It was great!
But make sure not to microwave more than 1 minute.

This was quick and easy of course! I would cut back on the amount of oil just a touch next time. Would make it again!

I thought this came out perfectly just as written, 60 seconds in my microwave! It is slightly cakey,  rich, chocolatey and moist. I wasn't expecting much, but this was good. It wasn't pudding-like as the submitter described, but that was better for me! :)  My 3 year-old helped, and after I put a scoop of ice cream on top, we devoured the whole thing in less than a minute!

I tried this on a whim, way too cake- like for me. I like my brownies fudgey, I did put a dollop of peanut butter on top for fun.
