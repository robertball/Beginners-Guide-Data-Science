I made these rolls twice.  The first time I did the recipe by the letter and was very disappointed.  Though they smelled divine while baking, the taste left much to be desired.  After all the word of chopping fresh chives and parsley, you couldn't even taste them! Besides that, the rolls were flat and just looked sad.  The second time I made the recipe I tripled the herbs and made only 15 rolls.  I also added some butter and fresh garlic to the egg white brush on.  The results were steller.  The rolls tasted slightly herby and were big and fluffy.  I whipped some of the leftover chives into butter, making chive butter, and served it alongside the rolls.  They were a big hit this way.

Delicious, have made it twice now.  I found that I needed to add about 2 cups of water to the dough when mixing it to get it to pull together properly.

These were nice, big, tender rolls.  I only put 15 in a 13x9 inch baking dish and 3 in a pie plate.  They took about 30 minutes to bake, and were very good.  I added parmesan cheese.  Thanks!

What a great recipe.  This was my first time ever making bread, and it came out so good.
I was a bit nervous about the bread rising, but everything came out fine.
I used basil and parsley and substituted milk for Soy milk.
Thank you so much  :)

This was the first time I have made bread, and the recipe turned out wonderful!  I added about a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and it gave the rolls great flavor along with the fresh herbs.

Very good bread to accompany dinner.  I used them with a cajun shrimp stew and the flavors mixed well.  Just makes a lot, next time I think I'll halve the recipe.

Increased herb amount to 1/2 cup chives (amount in grocery store package) & 3/4 cup parsley. Did not use egg white wash because I forgot but without it the rolls have a nice rustic appearance. Dough was very WET & STICKY, but turned out well.

These were excellent but with the title they have, I expected them to have a more herby taste.  I doubled the chives and parsley, and I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, yet I could still not taste the herbs.  The rolls were delicious and I will definitely make them again, but quadruple the herbs.  I sprinkled them with kosher salt after the egg wash which provided a nice little burst of flavor.

I love this recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone was impressed.  There were no leftovers whatsoever.  I doubled the amount of herbs listed on the recipe.  I also have made it with whole wheat flour, and it came out great (although they were not as fluffy as with white flour).  I've even made this recipe as two braided loaves instead of rolls.  I gave one to a neighbor, and they raved about the taste and texture- and demanded the recipe.  This recipe will remain in my cooking repertoire!

I used the fresh herbs from my garden: parsley and basil and they were fantastic, despite the minor setback of forgetting to add yeast at first.  oops!  I expect them to be even better when I make them properly the next time.

I used this as a base recipe and the results were fabulous!  I used green onion because I didn't have chives, I used a shake or two of dried oregano because I didn't have fresh parsley.  I added 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  Yummy!  I will be making these again!

This was an excellent recipe. I had to add to it by using the dehydrated onions I did with my dehydrator. It added a lot of flavor and I also rolled them up differently. I did Crescents rolls. They were baked at 375 for 16 minutes in a convection oven.

This was quick, easy and had excellent texture. The bread was a little bland unless you put a lot of butter on it, so I think I'll grind some sea salt on top of the egg white glaze next time or increase the amount of sugar I use.

These were absolutely wonderful. I was a little intimidated making them since I am more of "out of the can" kind of cooker. But I tried them out for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. I love bread and these are great. I am going to make them again soon just for me to munch on!

I followed the recipe exactly and my rolls were flat, tasteless and hard as a rock!  Just a disappointment.  I have made rolls before so it is not lack of experience.  I even bought new flour and yeast, don't know what did it.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. The rolls are medium crunchy on the outside and very fluffy and soft on the inside. I added fresh sunflower seeds to the top by first brushing the egg white on the risen rolls and dipping the top of them into a pan of sunflower seeds. After I dipped all of them I brushed them again with the egg white. These are very beautiful rolls too so they make a fabulous display. I also used 1 cup of wheat flour to 2 cups of white. I also added my own seasoning to the chives...I added in bruchetta seasoning which was delicious. Yum Yum! ;o)

These were not good at all!! I had a couple of surprise guest come over for Sunday dinner- these taste so bad that I couldn't serve these to my guest- thank goodness I had a few pop open cans of Pillsbury cressent rolls in the fridge. These rolls smell wonderful coming out of the oven- so for that I guess they deserve 1 star- but they taste horrible. I will not be making these EVER again.  Don't waste your time and money.

It took a lot longer to rise than the recipe called for and I ended up with somewhat hard rolls.  This is only the second time I've worked with yeast so I'm not sure if it's the recipe or me but I won't try this one again.  I like softer rolls.

I made these for Thanksgiving 06. They were a hit. A little overpowering if you are looking for a plain bread, but great for leftover turkey mini-sandwiches.

Tasty, but I was expecting more flavor.  These rolls were much better reheated the next day.

These rolls were more work chopping the herbs and were very pretty, but I was disappointed in the plain flavor.  They also did not rise very well.

Based on many reviewers comments I changed the herbs to fresh rosemary, simmered it in the water for a short period of time and then finely chopped it (used 3 sprigs) also used egg wash on the top and added kosher salt, then brushed with melted butter when they were removed from the oven.

These rolls didn't turn out as great as I thought they'd be, they were okay.  Thank you for letting me see your recipe.

They were a bit hard and more like scones then soft rolls. However, they had great flavor.

I'd never made bread before, but this recipe turned out GREAT!  They're a perfect compliment to any meal, with only soup or a grand holiday dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and they look, smell, and taste delicious.

A little dry and bland. However, I used whole wheat flour so this may explain that. If I were to make these again with whole wheat flour, I would brush on butter after they come out of the oven to improve the moistness and flavor.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year. They take a lot of time, so be forewarned! It took me longer than the two hours noted on the recipe. The rolls turned out very well, but like some other reviews, I couldn't pick up a lot of the herb flavor. Next time I make these I think I will try to use some stronger herbs.

Really good recipe for simple white dinner rolls. I used minced fresh rosemary instead of the chives and parsley. Because previous reviews said the flavor wasn't anything special, I tried to intensify the herb flavor--so I laid rosemary branches between the rolls in the baking pan. Seems to have worked pretty well.

These were delicious for Thanksgiving.  I did as others suggested and quadrupled the herbs, also added some parm and they came out great.  Even better was having them for leftovers - straight out of the fridge: turkey, roll, and some shredded mozzerella, microwave for 45 seconds or so... mmmmmmm.

I could have used less flour. They are quite heavy. The directions would have baked them too long. I reduced the time and they were still kind of dry. The leftovers are great for stuffing or breading.

I thought these were "just ok" but my guests seemed to enjoy more than I.  Maybe they were just being polite?

good, but the only flavor found for us, was the chives and parsley? otherwise, tasted like regular bread rolls, but more bland.

I followed the directions and they came out perfect.  The flavor, however, was kind of meh.  I didn't really wind up tasting the fresh chives I used, and the parsley added to them visually, but not really to the flavor.  If I were to make herb dinner rolls again, I'd try to find a bolder recipe.

These didn't turn out for me. They were tough and dense, not light and fluffy, but tasted ok if they had risen and baked properly. Most likely it was due to an error on my part or the yeast.

They seemed kind of dry and unremarkable.  I bet adding butter would have helped
