just okay.. The cinnamon is overpowering and seems out of place--I'd omit it altogether if I were to ever make this again.   And we prefer the usual bread crumbs vs cornflakes in our meatballs.  1 Tb of sugar for 1 1/4 lb meat is too much--they were too sweet and the cornflakes gave a strange taste and texture.

I used fire-roasted tomatoes, organic tomato sauce and paste, homemade italian seasoning (I like a little more spice in my sauce) and I added half a pound of chopped mushrooms, one diced red pepper and one chopped onion to the sauce, that I sauteed in with the garlic in the olive oil before adding everything else. I used brown sugar instead of white in the sauce. Because I don't keep cornflakes on hand, I used a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I didn't need the full amount, a half cup was plenty. I did not add sugar to the meatballs because there was sugar in the sauce. I also used homemade italian seasoning in the meatballs. The meatballs held up well but weren't my favorite. The sauce was pretty good and complimented the meatballs well. I liked that recipe baked the meatballs seperately so I could pour the grease off before adding them to the sauce. I think from now on, I'll use a mixture of the beef, pork and veal because that made for a great meatball. I liked the nutmeg, too. It was different in a meat sauce but tasty. I don't think I'd add as much next time, I think 1/4 of a teaspoon would be just right.

The sauce was okay used it on spaghetti (added a big more sugar and italian seasoning). Didn't make the meatballs.
