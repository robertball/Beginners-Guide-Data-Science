Made this recipe and the sauce is delicious! I doubled the recipe and left out the zucchini. I added fresh sliced mushrooms and meatballs.  I used honey instead of sucanat.  I also add one chopped green bellpepper and one can of diced tomatoes.  I cook the bellpepper and onion with my ground meat to be sure they are soft when the sauce is done.  I cooked the sauce in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and low for another hour adding in the fresh sliced mushrooms for that last hour.  It was better than any store bought sauce I have ever tasted.  Froze the leftovers and had it for another meal.  Absolutely wonderful!

This was hugely satisfying over spaghetti squash. I subbed 1/2 T of honey for the called-for sucanat.

This is especially great if you use tomatoes imported from Italy!

Made this the other night for dinner and have 2 more meals worth in the freezer.  Easy to make and delicious.  The only change I made was using Italian seasoning instead of the separate herbs.  I think I ended up using about 2 tablespoons of it.  Adding the zucchini makes the sauce feel like a good hearty sauce but with just the small amount of meat it keeps it on the healthier side.  Will make many many more times, that's for sure!

This was very good! The only change i made was adding some fresh mushrooms. I will definitely make this again, but will decrease the amount of sea salt next time - a little too salty for me as written. My husband loves it though, thanks!

Very good! Left out the meat (vegetarian daughter), and used gluten free pasta. Excellent.

This was awesome!  I substituted honey as well and also used a pound of 96/4 lean ground beef.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1lb turkey sausage, simmered for about an hour, and added mushrooms halfway through. Turned out great!

As a buys college student, this was an awesome way to get my daily veggies without having to cook them fresh every day. I ate it every day for a week and never got sick of it. So delicious! The best part was that the sauce was so hearty I didn't need to add a ton of pasta to fill me up.

Wonderful! I made it for my wife, as her previous favorite restaurant changed hands and the new management failed to maintain their quality.  We have a new favorite spaghetti sauce.

Made with 2 hot Italian sausage links, browned them first, sliced them and added to the sauce. Skipped the hamburger. Also diced up 1/2 a green pepper and a handful of mushrooms to add while simmering.
