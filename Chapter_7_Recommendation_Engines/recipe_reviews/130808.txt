Oh, yum, yum, yum!  How delicious was this stew?  Hubby had three servings, that good!  I did an "experimental" slow cooker version, I used a huge sweet potato, cubed, and two idaho cubed for the botom layer of the crock, added fresh cut green beans, and added all of the other veggies raw and large diced on top.  I browned the beef with that wonderful garlic and some Montreal seasoning, added to the crock, and added ground celery seed (my secret ingredient for all veggie based soups and stews!), ground pepper to the mix.  I added two cups beef broth (instead of one cup water)  and a cup of white wine to the mix, since I was slow cooking and a little concerned about drying out.  This stew was savory and delicious after 9 hours on low, and very brothy, plenty of liquid.  Sincere thanks to you and your family & mom for sharing this recipe, dolcevita, you have a winner here!

Delicious stew!  Even better the next day.  I'll be making this regularly!  Followed the directions and ingredients exactly, wouldn't change a thing.  I might try it in the slow cooker though, after the browning.

Probably the best Beef stew I have ever made. I did not have any wine but used canned diced tomatoes in juice instead of the wine and 1/2 tomatoe, worked great!!

Browned beef then threw it all in the slow cooker on high for about 3-1/2 hours (6-8 hrs on low).  Love this recipe - I doubled the spices, left out the green pepper (don't care for it much) and used a can of diced tomatoes - instead of the water, next time I plan to use beef broth instead to make it even richer.  Excellent dish, easy to make - will also add peas next time.  Thanks so much for this new dish in our dinner rotation!

This stew is delicious! I added 1/2 cup chicken broth for extra savoriness. This was my first time cooking with wine, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor it added to the stew. I used frozen green beans instead of canned, and chopped a whole tomato instead of a 1/2 of one. This is a perfect comfort meal for the Fall. We will definitely make this again!

I used half cup beef broth and half cup of a pink wine (red & white mix, because I didn't have white) and fresh green beans instead of canned.  The sweet potato/yams added an underlying sweetness that I didn't expect but was pleasantly surprised.  Delicious!!!

Fabulous Recipe, especially for a base recipe!  I added the sweet potatoes too soon and they had disintegrated by the time it was ready to serve, though flavor amazing.  Next time I will add half of them early like this time and half at the end so to have chunks.  I also added a can of kernal corn!!!  And a few more spices to taste!  WOW this was a killer stew!  The white wine AMAZING!

This was delicious.  I made it in the pressure cooker to save time.  I used all sweet potatoes instead of some red and fresh green beans instead of a can, otherwise everything was the same. Wonderful flavors.

Probably more like 4.5 for me.  I made as-written, which is what this rating is based on.  Good flavor, good combination of veggies, but lacked a liitle something for me @ the end.  Perhaps red wine instead of white?  White wine seemed like an odd ingredient for beef stew.  Just one T. of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning did the trick, though, it turned out just fantastic, and I will be making this all winter long.

I loved this stew.  I did use red wine instead of white and added rosemary, it was a nice fit.

Very good for a nice cold winter dinner you need something to warm you up. Served with garlic buttered club crackers really ties all the flavors together. You can add a tablespoon of jalape√±o salt if you prefer some spice to it like my family does.

I give this a 4.5 .... It was really tasty.  Next time I want to season the potatoes by themseleves to give it more flavor.  I seasoned the chicken with some goya adobo before flouring.  Instead of using a regular tomatoe i used a can diced....def will make again =D

Added Linguica, dark kidney beans and used Portuguese All Spice!!! Was the most flavorful robust stew. . We made a garlic and cheese crusty bread to accompany this delish stew. Will be making many a more times!

super good!  i used beef broth instead of just water, red wine instead of white, and omitted onions and tomatoes (food allergies).  It was delicious!  My family loved it.  will be my go-to beef stew recipe from now on!  
I only had carrots, canned green beans and sweet potatoes on hand but it still tasted great!

We thought this recipe was great and will make it again on a cold Sunday afternoon!  I made a few small adjustments...I did not initially use water, and substituted beef broth.  I did 1.5 pounds of meat and extra potatoes, which may have contributed to why I had to add more liquid.  So, instead of 2 cups liquid, I needed 4 cups.  I just added another cup of broth and another cup of water.   My only other note is that I was confused as to why the recipe had you peeling the skin off the red potatoes.  Why use them then?  I left mine on with no ill effects.

Getting ready for a trip to Portugal so I tried some new dishes. The taste of this stew is bland. The color is an unappetizing grey. I added a couple teaspoons of beef broth powder and it fixed both. The color pictured is actually an improvement. Taste is greener than a traditional stew and satisfies a taste for something different.

Made this with beef and beef broth for a friend and then made myself a vegetarian version (seitan instead of beef and Better Than Bouillon no beef cube). I LOVE this stew. It's so flavorful and easy! I didn't have regular potatoes so I just did an extra sweet potato. I ran out of garlic when I made it for myself so I used garlic powder the second time. Not quite as good but still freaking delicious. I'll just always make sure to have real garlic for this recipe. I'll be making this over and over. Everyone liked it a lot (including my 3 year old). Thank you!!

Wow. I made this exactly as written and it was just delicious. I wasn't expecting much just by reading the ingredients. It seemed similar to my classic stew, a little more involved, some unusual ingredients but I'm  so glad I tried this! My husband and Brother in law both took second helpings even though they both hate sweet potatoes and green pepper. I was worried it might be too sweet, but it was just right. I served this in a bowl with bow tie pasta  for the men and I had just the stew without the pasta. No one in the house cares for rice, but however you serve it you can't go wrong. I wouldn't change a thing. The recipe is perfect.

This smelled so good as it simmered and was delicious!  I followed the recipe as close as I could but in my rush I messed up a few things.  I added about double the paprika and forgot tomatoes so I added about a cup of canned tomatoes and also forgot the red potatoes.  I did have sweet potatoes though and they added such a nice flavor.  Despite my mistakes it was wonderful.

I made this in a slow cooker and used beef broth instead of wine and water. I added creole seasoning to the flour before browning the beef, and even with that it was very bland. The meat was tender because of the crockpot, but there was really nothing much to this dish. Way more work than it was worth, too. Was looking for a different type of beef stew, but I'll stick with the classic.

Good as written but much better if you use red wine instead of white and add chicken stock in addition to the water mainly because I use fresh green beans. with those changes this is five star all the way.

Wonderful stew - I'm so glad I found this. I substituted stew beef with a cubed boneless chuck roast, beef broth for water, and red wine for white. This has a delicious flavor and aroma - the sweet potato... outstanding!! I doubled the recipe which is going to give us plenty of happy leftovers. Very highly recommended.

I was nervous, but it came out good! I mixed both white and red wine, and I used beef broth with a half cup of water. I think the sweet potatoes take it to another level... This is a nice staple added to my recipes!

I made this stew with rosemary instead of parsley, because I had fresh rosemary and no fresh parsley! Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter; super delicious - no leftowvers! My family love stew, and the addition of sweet potato and wine make this stew really yummy! Putting it in my recipe box!
