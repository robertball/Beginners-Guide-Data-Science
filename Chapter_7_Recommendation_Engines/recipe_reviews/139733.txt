As this was so easy, I give it 5 starts compared to the recipe I usually use!  Really good and really simple and fast to make.  I used tequila lime salsa, so left out the lime and used about 1/2 tbs of chipotle seasoning instead of the adobo sauce.  Excellent!  Thanks!

This is good. Unless you have super-sensitive taste buds, you will want to increase the adobo sauce. As written, there is a little heat, but not enough of the smoky flavor. I ended up using about a teaspoon, which may be a little hot for some, but was perfectly flavored for us. Thanks for the recipe!

The best guacamole i've ever had (and I just got back from Mexico). The adobo sauce is key and should be doubled if you like it with a little kick.

We didn't exactly make this recipe, as part way in we realized we did not have sour cream, salsa, or lime. But what we ended up with was amazing! We used lemon instead of lime and added a half can of peppers and adobo sauce. I'm not a fan of really spicy food, and this was perfect for me. The peppers added a great flavor with out too much heat!

Excellent flavour, the adobo sauce added a great taste to the dip.  I used some homemade hot salsa and I enjoyed the chunky testure of the sauce compared to just a plain guacamole dip

I made this guacamole recipe along with homemade fried corn & flour tortilla chips for Father's Day. The flavor was very yummy and everyone loved them.

I thought this was great!  I did mash the avocado before mixing everything in.  Mine isn't the pretty green like the other pictures, it's almost is an unappetizing color actually, but that could be because I added extra adobo sauce.  I served mine on lettuce and tomatoes as a type of "dressing".  Worked well!

I followed it as written except I halved it and used dried chipotle powder instead of adobo sauce. I thought it was very good.

Super easy- was in a hurry so proceeded without measuring. Proof that you can't mess this up! Used medium pace picante, a real old lime and an over ripe avocado! Leaving out of town and this was a great way to use up what we had.
