I made this once for a friend who can't have dairy, now it is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  I use regular flour in place of cake flour and I have never had it come out "gummy".  It is VERY moist and delicious and sturdy enough to frost,fondant, and decorate for occasions.  Plus it is the most simple choc. cake recipe I have ever made!  Thanks!

It works great. I took out the cocoa powder and it turned out awesome as my Nephew's first birthday cake.

The reviewer who said 'gummy' was right; too bad she expected something else.  When we cook other people's recipes, we should be more open to what comes out.  Pretty sure the cake was supposed to be 'gummy'- it is similar to a fruitcake filling, and reminiscent of Little Deb brownies as far as texture.   Quite nice dipped in coffee, and I feel would accept additions about as well as a fruitcake.  This cooks up firm and can be immediately removed from the pan, though I'd wait the typical 5-10 then remove it to a rack.  Throw  nuts on top before the bake, just like LD- only thicker in the the 8x9 I used.
