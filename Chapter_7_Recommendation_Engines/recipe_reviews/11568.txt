This is a great holiday cookie.  I made them for the first time this year and will definitely make them again.  Lot of flavor with orange zest, cherries, and pistachios.  MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION would be to not freeze for 2 hours, but rather refrigerate.  I froze my dough for only an hour and a half and it was too frozen to cut.  Other than that, I think the cookies are great!

These cookies are great!  Everyone has been missing out by not making these.  I only used a little bit more than 1 cup of cherries and cranberries mixed, because that was all I had. It seemed to be plenty.  I didn't freeze the dough, but used parchment paper to shape into a log and refrigerated it for 2 hours.  It was plenty firm enough to slice. The cookies were HUGE. When I make these again, I will make 2 logs, smaller in diameter.  It did make 23 cookies, but could have made many more if the logs weren't so big. They sort of had a shortbread airy texture.  I had 3 cookies that didn't fit on the first cookie sheet, so I put them on a second sheet on the bottom rack.  DON'T do that!  They got too dark on the bottom and not browned on top.   The baking time was MUCH longer than stated (8 to 10 minutes longer), so I had to keep setting the timer for 2 more minutes (I get distracted) and checking them again.  Try these cookies!  BTW...it only got 4 stars because the baking time was so off and the directions to freeze were unnecessary.  I didn't use the white confectionary coating. It would look pretty, but I don't think it needs it.

I didn't like the fact that there was no pic. I like to see it before I try it. But I'm sure it's a fine recipe.
