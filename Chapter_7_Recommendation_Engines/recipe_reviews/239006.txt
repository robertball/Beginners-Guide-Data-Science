This was good!  It was easy to prep (I even prepped the marinade the day before so I could just douse the salmon when I got home to let it marinate while I worked out) and the 2-3 minutes per side cook time was spot on for me.  I found myself preferring the heavily glazed bites, so I think I'd marinate longer and use even more whole cooking next time.  THANKS for the recipe!

The recipe has typo errors for sure. I don’t know if the poster comes and reads reviews or not, but if you do, you will need to fix that sugar measurement to stop the nasty, 1-star reviews. Who would fuss over 2/3 of a TEASPOON  in a sweet marinade with almost no other sweetener? It surely must be 1/3 cup. I did more of it than 1/3 cup, and a bit more honey, but I usually like things such as a maple or sweet and sour-type salmon to be more on the sweet side.

I added more honey and brown sugar. It needed a lot more sweetness to balance out the salty soy and tart lemon. I used a whole lemon because mine was really small. The ingredients are all very good, just needed more honey and brown sugar. I probably used 2-3Tbsp honey and 1Tbsp brown sugar (I eyeballed it though) Served over sautéed broccoli and carrots and with white rice (forgot I had brown). I made another batch of  the sauce recipe so I could toss the veggies with it before spooning over the rice. Yum!

Wasn't what I was expecting. I've had delicious honey-glazed salmon at restaurants and was hoping to get the same effect with this recipe. 
The glaze is actually a very tasty marinade that I would use again - maybe it had too much soy sauce because it was very wet. I added extra honey to thicken it and it helped a little. 
Overall, this is a very tasty dish, and I'm happy that I have a new marinade to use on other meats and possibly even use as a salad dressing. It's that yummy! 
But this is not sweet glazed salmon, it's more of a savory dish so I'm looking forward to trying out other recipes here.

I added a little more honey since I prefer the sweeter flavor.  I would also not add the 3 Tbsp. of marinade until the salmon is almost done because my liquid burned.  Otherwise it was delicious and I'm happy to have a go to recipe for salmon glaze.

It wasn't sweet at all to me. The sweetness of the brown sugar and honey were canceled out by the lemon juice and soy sauce. I ended up reducing the leftover marinade separately on the stove and added more brown sugar and honey.

The only change was that I did not saute the garlic.  I minced it and threw it in the marinade.  Mom and I both liked this one.  It's a keeper.

I made this recipe, I used Worchestershire in place of soy sauce just bcs it's my usual preference and I used limes instead of lemon, but otherwise folowed it as says and it was very good! I used a but too much lime so it had a strong citrus flavor but it was still a good flavor. I didn't measure the Yout just need to really stir the sauce til all sugar and ho  but added tons of honey and tons of brown sugar. Along with the Chile flakes... It had great flavor and cooked perfectly. Just as she said in the recipe great combo of flavors.

Huge hit for dinner and the marinade was so good I wanted to drink it.  I kept true to the measurements  and the only modifications I made were out of necessity due to supply shortages, so they were butter infused olive oil, RealLemon juice (yellow container) and Jalapeno Honey (C&J Farms in Corsicana TX - it's delicious!). Since there was spice in the honey, I omitted red pepper flakes. I shortened the marinade time to just 15 minutes by using the marinade feature on my FoodSaver.   When cooking,  I used all of the marinade in the skillet and since I used an electric skillet, no sticking or burning occurred.

This is the FIRST Recipe on Alrecipes.com that I found absolutely HORRIBLE! I was expecting the marinade (which I had planned to use on a Pork Loin instead of Salmon) to have a sweet, yet salty flavor. Instead, upon first taste-testing the marinade BEFORE letting my Pork Loin Marinade, it tasted as if I was eating an ENTIRE JAR OF SALT; AND THIS WAS AFTER I REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SEA SALT CALLED FOR BY 1/3 AND USING SOY SAUCE LIGHT (less sodium). In order to *save* the marinade and not waste the products I used, I had to add at least an additional cup of brown sugar in addition to an additional 1/8 - 1/4 cup of honey. I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend this recipe to ANYONE! Those who are on a reduced sodium diet for health reasons DEFINITELY should NOT make and consume this. It tastes more like a salt lick than an appealing marinade for either the salmon that it calls for, or the Pork Loin Roast I had planned to use it on!
