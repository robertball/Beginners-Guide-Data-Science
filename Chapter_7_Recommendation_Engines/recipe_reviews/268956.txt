This was an ok way to use up some beet greens I had. I felt this could use a bit more seasoning--some garlic and herbs, perhaps--and was missing a bit of the signature creaminess you get with traditional risotto. Overall, it wasn't bad, but I'm not sure that I'd make risotto in the slow cooker again. It was fun to try, but it didn't turn out like I hoped it would. Thanks for the recipe, though!
