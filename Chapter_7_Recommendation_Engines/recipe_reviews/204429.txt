I have made this twice in a week. I did not bother with boiling the noodles. I made extra sauce for the home made bbq pork and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I baked it off the next day and the noodles were perfect. The Lunch Ladies Loved it!! Really different.  This is a keeper &  Great for a crowd.

I LOVED this recipe.  The only change I made was in the amount of cheese.  I only had an 8 oz. bag of the cheddar and 8 oz. bag of mozzarella.  I also cooked the entire box of lasagna noodles and literally used 8 of them (4 for each layer).  There was only enough ricotta and meat for two layers, but it was perfect.  Next time I make a boston butt, this will be made with the leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!!!  I was looking for something creative to do with slow cooked pork BBQ leftovers (I added Bull's Eye since the meat wasn't too saucy) and this couldn't have been more perfect!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but was pretty absent-minded/lazy about following the dirsctions (got the layers out of order, didn't spread things evenly, put the cheese on top in the beginning instead of the last 5 minutes) but it turned out amazing!  My husband and I were blown away.  This would be perfect to take over to someone's house to be re-heated if you wanted to drop off dinner or for a pot-luck, tailgate, etc. where it could sit out a while.  It was fairly quick to make, and you could probably use any kind of slow cooked meat.  Imagine the possibilities...leftover pot roast and mashed potatoes, BBQ chicken, mexican beef, etc.  Delicious and creative,  I'll certainly be adding this recipe to my regular rotation!

My family didn't really care for it, it tasted more like a sloppy joe. On the other hand, my neighbors loved it. So, it's a matter of taste. It is NOT horrible, I will make it again for my neighbors!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that there is an abundance of noodles left over.  I also, added some onions.  I think it needs something with a different texture also.  Maybe some colored peppers.

Over-the-moon about this!!!  I used "Southern Yank Pulled Pork BBQ" recipe in the crock pot and then assembled this lasagna the following day with the leftovers!  FABULOUS!  A great new take on a traditional dish.  THANKS!

I had my family over for dinner and made this.  I also made regular lasagna just in case it wasn't a hit.  The Barbeque Lasagna went over well it was delicious and needless to say everybody wanted to take the leftovers home of that which left me with a lot of regular lasagna left.  It was a great dish and I will definitely be making it again.

This is total comfort food. I made the pork following the Southern Yank Pulled Pork BBQ recipe from this site (which was AWESOME.)  I agree that it's kind of a one-note dish that relies heavily on the quality of your bbq -- so make sure it's good!  My picky 5 yr old loved it.

Thsi is so delicious and could not be easier!  I remember eating this when I used to go to Memphis on business and I was so delighted to find this recipe!  It makes quite a bit, so it's great for company.

This was a big hit with my family.  I used leftover homemade spicy bbq pulled pork that I had on hand, and added the veggies i would to any lasagna (grated carrot, peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms) and omitted the ricotta cheese, and used only cheddar and mozza cheeses instead. My family liked it so much that i've now made this three times and it's always all gone!  Thank you for sharing!

I did not use purchased pork barbeque, but used some freshly smoked with our favorite bbq sauce. For our family the ricotta simply did not work well with the bbq sauce when I tried it on the day I made it. I then tried it the following day hoping that the flavors would have melded better, but for me it simply wasn't a good combination.

This was alright. I thought the combination would be too odd but I was lured in by how quick and easy it was. To my amusement, it actually turned out to be pretty tasty. For the dish I used, the proportions were off  (I didn't use nearly all of the shredded cheese and could have used more ricotta). I added a hearty dash of onion powder to the ricotta mixture because I couldn't comprehend this dish without at least a little bit of seasoning of some sort. Overall, this was edible, but weird. I think I'll only make it again if I have a lot of pulled pork to get rid of, but it was an interesting dinner.

I had left over pulled pork from a lunch my mom had made so I found this recipe. I have to admit I did not follow it too closely but just the idea alone is 4 star. Thanks for helping me and my wallet by inspiring fun left overs.

I had some leftover BBQ pulled beef and needed to use it up. We host a chapel for a local junior A hockey team every 2 weeks and so I thought I would make one normal lasagna and this one. The only change I made (only cause I didn't read the instructions fully) was that I combined all the cheeses together. I think that worked just fine and probably wouldn't separate them next time anyway. I added more BBQ sauce to the meat and layered it with noodles and the cheese mixture. Only problem I had was the bottom layer of BBQ sauce and noodles really stuck to the bottom of my pan. I would spray oil next time to try to prevent that. I told the guys they might not like it. They loved it and ate the whole pan- minus the crusty bottom layer!  One guy said it was his favourite chapel meal this year so I'd say it was a hit!

One of my favorite recipes.  A big hit here at home and with friends that have tried it.
