Could call this "Turkey Pot Pie" with the crust inside. Since it was so simple and quick, wasn't expecting this to be yummy. Hubby loved it too. Made as written but added 1/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning. Was concerned the expired chopped Crescents roll dough wouldn't cook fully so added 5 minutes and they tasted great, like tiny biscuits/dumplings. The bread crumbs made a very brown crust. Next time will add 1/4 to 1/2 cup each of the turkey and veggies plus double Italian Seasoning.
