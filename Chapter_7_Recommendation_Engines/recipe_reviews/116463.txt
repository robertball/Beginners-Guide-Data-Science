I made these following the recipe exactly but they were just way too buttery/icing sugary as is.  I left them out at room temp to soften them    added another 1 1/2c of chopped pecans 1/4 of maple syrup beating well, then rolled into tiny balls and then dipped in the darkest chocolate I could find (73%) then rolled them into more crushed pecans.  I liked them this way better.  But thank you for the recipe-without it I would never think to do anything like this.

These really sweet little treats are quite addicting! They are very sweet, so I made miniature balls. A little goes along way, but they are a great sweet snack.

Wow! I had a hard time mixing the full 3 1/2 cups of sugar in... but I kept at it and finally prevailed :) I LOVE these little maple balls. Smaller IS better, because they are so rich and sweet. I made mine about 3/4 inch.  Pecans were SO expensive this year that I used a package of pecan/peanut mixture and it was still delish! I felt as though I'd made something really special for gifts.
