Ugly looking, but very tasty! I used homemade chunky applesauce that had been simmered with cinnamon sticks (more flavor), and I also added about 3 or Tbls of chopped candied ginger. Nice and moist.

when I copied this recipe, I didn't realize there was only pumpkin pie spice and no pumpkin, so I was bummed b/c I found it under pumpkin recipes.... But it was soooo good. A little dry, maybe b/c I used reduced fat busquick?  Also wasn't firm enough to knead, maybe for the same reason.  However, I put it in my cool scone pan, baked it, then sliced them in half and filled with....NUTELLA! Fantastic! thank you!

Not sweet enough for my taste, and a bit dry.  I didn't serve it with ice cream--but I think that would help balance it more.

These scones are easy to prepare and great with whipped cream.  I doubled the spice and my family found them just sweet enough.

Love, love, love these!  I'm not a big Bisquick fan, but I happened to have some (reduced fat version) in my pantry when I stumbled upon this recipe.  Super quick, super easy.  I like them because they're not sickeningly sweet and low fat.  They have just a hint of sweetness.  Served with whipped cream they're perfect!  I agree, though, with the previous reviewer - it's not a pretty presentation by itself.  They'd be really good with a drizzle of caramel, too.  Yum!
