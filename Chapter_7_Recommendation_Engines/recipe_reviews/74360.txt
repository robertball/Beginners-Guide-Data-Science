Awesome recipe...I only made a few little changes, first I added diced cubanelle peppers to the garlic and onions, I didn't have sour cream so I used a little bit of mayo (I was sorprised that work out very very well) I used italian breadcrumbs and to the sauce I added a little bit of steak sauce and some maple syrup...Delicioso!! uh, I almost forgot, I placed two slices of regular bread at the bottom of the pan before put it in the oven, that way the bread suck all the grease from the meat...when it is done, just discard the bread..Thanks for sharing!!!

ooh my goooooodness, this truly is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted in my life. My husband and two little children loved it. My daughter is a really picky eater especially when it comes to meat, but she ate it all down to the last drop. I absolutely recommend this recipe to every one. I will most definitely be making this again. I can not wait to have a get together so that I can share it with others. I gave this recipe 5 stars only because that was the highest option available. It was greeeaaaattttt!!!!!!!

This recipie was great, I did change it around alittle. I used italian bread crumbs instead of the bread and crackers,and I used garlic powder and onion salt instead of cooking garlic and onion in butter. I also forgot to use the milk. The meat was pretty moist I didn't need it anyway. This was great will use it again. Thanks

This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and the only real change I made was to use Italian Breadcrumbs and a dash of Italian Seasoning and it was phenomenal!  I didn't have a meat thermometer, but the timing was perfect!  I was so impressed with myself!!  ;o)  My husband took one bite and said it tasted like his mom's!  I take that as a compliment!  I think next time I will use 1/2 ground sirloin and 1/2 ground pork as another suggested--it sounds good, but otherwise, it was incredible!

I made this tonight for my family and it was great meatloaf!!  The only thing I changed on this recipe was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (huge beef recall happening right now...don't want to chance the Mad Cow thing!).  Anyway...this turkey meatloaf was absolutely fantastic!!  Oh yeah...one other thing I did was use a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread.  My whole family said this was "the best meatloaf I have ever made."  So I'm thinking you titled this recipe perfectly! :)  Will make this again!!  
Buon Appetite!

My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe. It was painfully simple and simply delicious. It's not too ketchupy, which I really like. I might add some seasonings (perhaps an Italian blend) the next time around just to experiment with the taste a little. It was very moist and a certain keeper in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing it!

Having been on the hunt for a good meatloaf recipe for some time now, I am thrilled to have found this one. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added maple syrup rather then milk, Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, and mayo instead of sour cream (we never keep sour cream stocked in our house). Although moist, it held together beautifully. I topped it off with a glaze (1/2 cup ketchup, 4 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp whit vinegar) when I turned the oven temperature up for the remaining 15 minutes. Perfect. Will stop the hunt with this one!!

I followed the baking instructions exactly, but not the ingredient list. I added onion powder, garlic powder, left out the bread, and added something I learned from an old roomate: horseradish! While there is no accounting for taste (no such thing as 'too'spicy or 'too' many onions), the baking process seemed to be spot on, especially  in regard to turning it up to 400.... thanks.

This was the first time I ever made meatloaf and I was very pleased with how it came out.  It was moist and flavorful and just delicious.  Even my picky 2 year old liked it.  I froze some of the leftovers for later and it worked quite well.  I will definitely be making this one again.

Update: I used ground sirloin the last time I made this and it was to die for!

Sorry, we tried this exactly and we did not care for it at all - too mushy with all of the different kinds bread crumbs and we did not care for the taste that the tomato sauce gave it.  We will stick with our original Meatloaf recipe.

Best meatloaf recipe ever!  Very moist and delicious.  I did add double the onions, and a little more butter and Worcester sauce.  Also, I used 1 cup garlic/herb bread crumbs.

This turned out great! I did make quite a few changes, although the actual recipe for the meatloaf itself was nearly same (I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers, and eliminated milk, because it was perfectly moist without). I cooked mine in a slow cooker. Meatloaf in a slow cooker is quite easy. Line the slow cooker with 2 sheets of foil, so they cross at the base and there is extra foil hanging over the sides (you will use the foil to pull out the loaf when finished). Then you shape your meat into a loaf, place inside the slow cooker, cover with sauce and cook on high for 4 to 6 hours. The sauce I used included the other half can of tomato sauce, 1/2 cup water, about 1 T of worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp prepared mustard, and a bit of brown sugar.

Search No More.!!!! This is simply the best meatloaf I've ever made....hands down.  Increased onion to 1 cup; added 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper diced; did NOT add the milk (it didnt need it); to the fiinishing sauce I added 2 tablespoons worcestershire 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon mustard.  Cookings times were spot on.  Covered with foil and let sit for 10mins before cutting.  WOW.!!!!  It was perfect and definitely earned its title.

This really was the best meatloaf I've ever eaten, and I never cared for meatloaf before. I did make a few alterations. I omitted the milk and used Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs instead of bread. For the topping, I added parmesan cheese and a little brown sugar. Mouthwatering!

This recipe was fabulous. The first time I made it for my family and they loved it. Then I made it for my sister's husband for his pre-surgery special meal...he said it was better than his Mom's, who was a fantastic cook. Wow! A definite keeper! The only addition I made was a little bit of Worchester sauce in the tomato sauce/ketchup topping. Next time I may use some ground pork as a portion of the meat. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!
5/14/17--Still using this recipe! Special request by daughter home from college. It won't last long around here?? I ha e continued to add worchestershire to tomato sauce topping, sometimes w/ onion and garlic powder. It is ALWAYS delicious! Try it---I do w/ 1lb ground round and 1 lb ground pork, the rest is as written and yummy it is! Thx again, it's a classic in our house??

This really is the best meatloaf recipe out there that I have found so far. I added some different seasonings and finely grated some carrots to the mix for a little extra nutrition (neither my husband or son noticed). Son shoveled it down so fast you'd think he was starving. I will add this recipe to my regular dinner recipe rotation.

This is one of the best meatloafs ever.  I've made thousands of them before so this recipe looked pretty much like any other one.   So, what makes this one so special? Outside of adding sour cream,  I think it was baking at 2 temperatures. in this one, you increase the oven temp from 350 to 400 after 40 minutes and continue baking for 15 minutes, then adding the tomato & ketchup topping and baking at 400 for another 10 minutes.  A famous chef once told me that people think he leaves an ingredient out of a recipe, but he does not. It's the heat he says. That makes all the difference. perhaps this is the secret to making this recipe so special. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipie!! I missed a really great meatloaf we used to get at a restaurant that closed.  This is even better.  I did exactly what you suggested.  I only added a few finely diced green, red, and yellow peppers.  WHen it came out you coudn't really see them but it gave the meatloaf a slightly spicier taste.  For the tomato sauce, I used an organic sauce from a market that had basil and other lovely subtle ingredients.  It gave the meatloaf more complexity and sophistication than simple tomato sauce.  Its a keeper!!

I loved this recipe; I think it's aptly named!  I used panko bread crumbs instead of the sliced/toasted bread, used numerous cloves of chopped garlic (instead of just two cloves), and added a little more sour cream than the recipe called for.  I didn't need to add any milk to moisten the meat (probably due to the extra sour cream), so I omitted it.  I was skeptical that the tomato sauce/ketchup topping would be flavorful enough, but it was.  The whole meatloaf was really, really good, and I look forward to making it again.

GREAT recipe! Very moist and overall great flavor. The only change I made was I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar and a cider vinegar to the glaze but that's just personal preference. Thanks!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. The only thing I do different is use canned bread crumbs instead of the toasted, crumbled bread. Follow the recipe exactly and it is perfect every time. It's a staple in my house now. Highly recommended!!!

My husband and I were not big meatloaf fans growing up, but it was really cold one night and I craved meatloaf.  Man!  This is fabulous meatloaf!!  No changes at all.  I make it just like the recipe says and it's great!  My middle school kids absolutely love it.  My son devours it!  I serve with mashed potatoes and peas and it can't be beat.

I did not add the full amount of salt, just a pinch. I used whole wheat bread and I did add about a tablespoon of my homemade italian seasoning to the actual meatloaf and a teaspoon of the italian seasoning to the tomato sauce. It was an easy enough meatloaf to make and it stayed in one piece (which I always struggle with), but it wasn't anything to write home about. I'm sorry. If I hadn't added the spices, it would have been really bland. NOTE: I did not add the milk.

I've been making meatloaf for years and this is by far my favorite recipe!  It was tender, baked to perfection and tasted great!  My husband loved it, too and he knows his meatloaf.  I've already added this to my recipe box.

This recipe was one of the best I've made and believe me I'm old enough to assure you that I've made plenty. I debated whether or not to try it but I certainly am glad I did. If your looking for that one good keeper of a meatloaf recipe believe me give this one a shot. I really don't like when everyone gets on there horses and say oh by the way I changed this and that and then it was wonderful but I did change the toast and crackers to crushed seasoned croutons simply because i didn't want to make toast and did not have buttery crackers but this recipe is definately wonderful.... thanks for sharing...

I'll be very honest and say that this was definitely not the best meatloaf I have ever had or made. I was so bummed!! Followed the recipe very closely and thought nothing much of it either way. Sorry!

Not the best I've ever had. Too runny, even without the milk. If I had not checked the temperature I'd have thought it wasn't done.

I used to hate meatloaf because I’ve never tasted any good meat loaf in my life. My hubby found this recipe and I made it. I only substituted the sour cream with cream cheese because we did not have the sour cream. The meatloaf smelled good, tasted tender and delicious. This is the best meatloaf I have ever had!!! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

The only thing I changed was reduce the black pepper based on what others said.  Otherwise exactly as written.  I have never liked meat loaf.  I only took a tiny piece as would be usual for me.  I went back for SECONDS!!!  Thank You for a great new recipe.  My husband has always loved meat loaf and I have looked the world over for a great receipe.  You gave it to me.  Thanks VERY MUCH.

Okay, but not the best. I toasted three slices of the large rectangular wheat bread. (Probably too much) and seven crackers. It came out tasting bland. My husband liked it though.

Delicious! This was my boyfriend and I's first attempt at meatloaf and it turned out well. Skip waiting for the meatloaf to be 160 degrees, that wasn't happening for us. If we would have left it in the oven any longer it may have been burnt. Next time we'll add a bit more seasoning to make it that much better. Delicious but a tad bit bland

A very tasty meatloaf thoroughly enjoyed by all the family.  I baked for 40 mins then removed loaf from tin onto foil tray.  Mixed 1/2tsp dry mustard, 1 tbs brown sugar, 1/4 cup tomato sauce and 1/2 tsp curry powder - glazed the loaf and baked at 180deg C for another 30 mins. Thanks for sharing it tracy, is in the 'keeper' file.

This is really good. I cooked mine on a sheet pan instead of in a loaf pan - I think it helps to keep it from getting too greasy or mushy. I followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely, except for doing a bbq/ketchup/horseradish sauce on the top - the guys like the sauce sweet & spicy and I didn't know how the plain tomato & ketchup would go over. Thanks for the recipe! :D

This is the first meatloaf recipe I've tried in a while and my family loved it!  I made one minor modification by adding about 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley to the recipe.

My sons fought over the leftovers so they could take sandwiches to school the next day.

I wasn't a fan of this meatloaf but my kids sure were.  I found it tasted somewhat off, maybe it was just me.  The meatloaf itself was moist & the texture was great as well.  I will be making this again for the kids since they loved it so much.

Oh wow, this was awesome!  I had to improvise slightly with what I had on hand, but just two small changes: Used plain stuffing cubes I had in the freezer in place of the toasted bread and used condensed tomato bisque soup in place of the tomato sauce (added a little less water to the soup than usual to keep it saucy and then used the 15 oz called for in the recipe; also used the soup to coat the top the last 15 mins of cooking).  Pressed some whole stuffing cubes into the bottom of the loaf to help soak up some of the juices.  This tasted soooo good!  Thank you for the recipe!

So good! I didn't have crackers or tomato sauce, so I just used enough bread to look good to me and squirted some ketchup both into the meatloaf then on top at the end.

Threw it straight on the trash.
Soggy meat soup is what it turned out to be. Followed recipe to the letter.

Other meatloaf recipe was better. That's what I get for trying something new. Need to learn to stick to what works!

This meatloaf was really awesome.  I did make a few changes.  First, I added a chopped pasilla pepper to the onion and garlic mixture, replaced the crumbled bread with 1C of stovetop stuffing mix (I used the turkey flavor), 3 table spoons of ketchup to the meat mixture, two table spoons of my favorite BBQ sauce (honey sweet) to the meat mixture, and two table spoons of my favorite BBQ sauce to the ketchup and tomato sauce mixture for the top.  I also baked this an additional 15mins longer at 450.  

Also, adding a couple of slices of bead to the bottom of the pan is ingenuous!  Plus, this meatloaf is even better the next day!  Really yummy melting a slice of American cheese on top the next day.

I found that this meatloaf was very tasty in flavor but it did not hold together well. I don't think there was enough bread or crackers to hold it together. If I make this again I might try adding more of that or maybe even some rolled oats. Thanks for the variation though :)

I won't ever need another recipe for meatloaf again. This one is fantastic! I toasted the bread in the toaster and chopped it up. I didn't use any milk but put in 3/4 of the tomato sauce. For the sauce on top I used the 1/4 tomato sauce plus 1/4 cup ketchup mixed with 1/4 cup brown sugar and a teaspoon of ground mustard.

Sorry, but I thought this was not remarkable in any way.  Just kind of bland.  Didn't even care for the leftovers.  Just not enough of a flavor punch.  I wouldn't make it again.

A bit on the bland side but not bad if you are not looking for an overpowering dish. My meatloaf kind of feel apart.  I used crumbled italian bread and probably would of had a denser meatloaf if I used a denser breadcrumb such as a country style bread or dinner roll.  I will try it this way next time to see if I am more successful.  Also, don't add any milk, it will work against you.

super duper meatloaf.  my husband is saying '4 and a quarter stars' and he is hard to please!  i thought it was very tasty, especially with the topping.  moist and yummy and i didnt mind doing the work.  recipe says 'serves 12' and that makes for VERY small portions, so if you are watching what you eat, watch the size of your slice if your aim is to stay true to the nutritional content provided.  will make again!

I thought this was a good base recipe. I adjusted the recipe slightly to make it 5 star. I used 1.5 lbs ground beef and the other half pound I used ground pork. A little extra cracker crumbs and a squirt of BBQ sauce in the meat mixture...and it's meatloaf heaven!

Absolutely fantastic..my husband and I and my 89 year mom, are soooo picky about meatloaf and for years.. no matter how I made it the way I was taught by my grandmother and mom.. it NEVER was great and then I tried countless other recipes, too no avail!! This recipe blows everything out of the water!!!! I added some bell peppers  to the saute of onion and garlic,  added a tad bit of pepper flakes and a little bit of Mrs Dash to the meat.  For the topping, I added..some brown sugar, 2 or 3 drops of tobacco hot sauce, worchestershire to taste.   Lots of that topping, THAT'S FOR SURE! otherwise..it was just like the recipe. albeit I didn't think I needed the milk.

**My review was hijacked by my auto correct so i am posting again in order to fix it! ** 
I used mayo instead of sour cream, omitted  the crackers altogether, added seasoning salt to taste, also added bbq sauce and a little Catalina salad dressing to the ketchup “mix” because the tomato sauce was a bit strong for me and adding just bbq sauce made it too bbq-y for me. I used the milk that the recipie called for too. As far as the mushiness mentioned in a previous review, I can see how that could happen but for me, I just added the mix little by little to the meatloaf, until I had the consistency that I wanted. The only thing I had a problem with was the cook time. I have a gas stove and things cook super fast so my meatloaf actually over cooked slightly on the edges due to the turn up temp at 400* but it still turned out fabulous and much better than any other meatloaf I’ve ever made...and I’m 40 years old ;)

Sorry, in my opinion, this was bland and mushy and I didn't use any of the milk. The mush could be related to the cut and moisture of the meat, but there really aren't enough spices to make it flavorful for my family's taste.

I love this recipe! I was able to use a non-dairy sour cream and skipped the milk. I also used 1 cup of plain bread crumbs in lieu of the 3 pieces of bread and crackers. I didn't have any thyme, but I used 1 TBS of Italian seasoning and it turned out great! I will make this again!

I've tried many meatloaves and this one is great, simple. Only thing I changed was instead of the bread/crackers hassle, I used 1 cup of Italian bradcrumbs and did not needed the milk, the sour cream was enough. Will make again, thanks!

great base recipe with perfect cook times. the recipe is pretty flexible to alter to your tastes- i used half 80/20 ground beef and half 80/20 ground pork, and omitted the canned tomato sauce and milk from the meat mix because of the extra moisture the fat would add.  i then made my own glaze with ketchup/brown sugar/worcestershire sauce/apple cider vinegar/a splash of balsamic vinegar. it was the perfect meatloaf and made delicious sandwiches.

I've never reviewed a recipe, so let that say something in itself. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes were I used Italian breadcrumbs( I didn't have any bread believe it or not) and I omitted the milk. This meatloaf is wonderful! Moist, well seasoned, and delicious.   I will always use this recipe.  Highly recommend

Awesome recipe! Everyone loved it and I will definitely be using the recipe from here on. I added a little less than half a green bell pepper to the onions on the stove, and it gave a lot of flavor to the meatloaf.  Only had an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, used about 7 in the mix and added about 4 tbsp of ketchup to the remaining oz. Still made a great topping.

I hate to post one of the few negative reviews but this was most definitely not one of my best meat loaves.  It was not as moist as I like meatloaf to be and I really didn't like the effect the garlic had on the flavor.  It didn't taste savory to me. The garlic gave it a somewhat bitter flavor.  My search for the perfect meatloaf continues.

Oh my goodness!!!! Thank you somuch for submitting this recipe and sharing it with us- it was absolutely delicious -my search is truly over- I decided to change my lifestyle by eating right and exercising and I made this recipe as lean as I could possibly get it - so I was skeptical about how it would taste after my makeover - it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! - I will throw away every other recipe I've collected - Thank you! Thank you!

Exceptionally tasty!  My husband and two young children really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I did not add the "optional" 1/4 cup of milk since everything already seemed too moist.  I may have had a bit less than 2 lbs of ground beef.  It was the best meatloaf we've all had, and it was requested that it remain on our "regular" list of dinner meals from now on.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

This meatloaf was good, the consistency was great, good sandwiches the next day, definitely satisfied the meatloaf craving I had.  However, I have managed to make it better in previous meatloaf renditions.  I did like the toasted crumbled bread, and will use in the future, usually I use breadcrumbs or crackers.

I followed the recipe exactly, however in the last 10 min. of cooking I merely coated the top of the loaf with ketchup.  It was already swimming in juice and if I had added as much tomato sauce as the recipe called for I would have had meatloaf soup.   Upon first taste I thought this was fine, but certainly not the best I'd ever had.  The real beauty of this recipe is in the leftovers.  Because is is SO moist, leftovers are delicious - even 3 days after the fact.  In fact, I'd say the longer you let it sit in your fridge the better it gets.  If you like a nice crust on your meatloaf this is *not* the recipe for you but if you are looking for many days of yummy meatloaf sandwiches, try this one.

Simply perfect - followed it exactly except a little less milk.  My family loved it, and my husband, who grew up on meatloaf and therfore hates it, LOVED it.  Thanks for the great keeper recipe!

I enjoyed the final product but the original recipe could use a little tweaking.  I used less tomato sauce and ketchup on the top of the loaf so it would get dried and crunchy.  Also, I like to bake the loaf in a broil pan as to keep it from sitting in its own fat.  The recipe is great if you tweak it to your taste.

I really like the flavor of this meatloaf.  Next time I will replace 1/4 of the hamburger with ground pork to help it hold together better.  Great meatloaf JustinandTracy - thanks!

Last night was the second time I've made this.  The first time I made a mistake and didn't add enough breadcrumbs and it fell apart.  This time though, I made it with ground turkey (it still turns out excellent) and added enough Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and it was absolutely amazing!  Not a single bit left in the pan.

I made this recipe exactly as printed, and am giving it 4 stars mainly because of it's incredible moistness. It tasted good too, but I thought it was rather bland; next time I think I'll add mushrooms and diced bell peppers, maybe adding a little more sour cream to keep the 'solids to liquids' ratio. I also thought it was too salty, with the crackers and added salt. Now,my personal preference remarks aside, this is a great recipe, which I will make often, with adjustments to suit my own taste!

The base recipe for this is absolutely excellent.  In lieu of the homemade breadcrumbs, I used 1/4 cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (Progresso).  

The sauce as written is a little bland as well, so I spiced it up with a mixture of ketchup, 1/2 teaspoon each of red pepper flakes and garlic, and 2 T Worcestershire sauce.  

All around, however, this really was the best meatloaf I've ever had or made.  Superb.

I finally found a meatload receipe that my son will eat. The only changes I made was that I removed the minced onion and added onion powder to the mixture since my son dislikes onions. I also increased the toasted bread since I used Pepperidge Farm sandwich bread. I had to double the bread to 6 slices.  I did not have to use the whole 1/4 cup of milk, only a few teaspoons did the trick. It worked perfectly. I served it with McCain's Mashed Potato Tater Tots for a quick side dish. It worked perfectly! Thanks Justin and Tracy. You should check out my receipe at Allrecipes.com, it's called Sweet Potato Pudding. I used it as a side dish for Thanksgiving but Allrecipes.com lists it under desserts.

This is THE BEST meatloaf that I ever made HANDS-DOWN! The only thing that I did differently was to omit the tomato sauce on the top (I did put it into the mix) because we like to add beef gravy on the serving along with mashed potatoes. As mentioned it is moist and flavorful. Make it yourself... you will be glad you did.

Tasted fantastic. Maybe add a more tomato sauce and ketchup. There was not much sauce especially if you want it with every bite.

This recipe is so good. The balance for dry to wet is great.  The only change I will make when I mak it again is to cook it a few minutes less at the end. You can really just follow the directions or customize with veggies (I added red bell peppers with the onions) but I can see adding mushrooms the next time.  Thank you for this recipe!

Tonight’s dinner for me was supposed to be Honey Nut Cheerios. I made this meatloaf recipe for my family, but I absolutely no intentions of eating it. I never liked it... at all.  My family raved about it, so I reluctantly tried a bite of my son’s.  Needless to say, it’s 11:30 at night and I’m eating my second helping.   I can’t believe how much I love this!

Very tasty!  I made this almost exactly as the recipe is written, except that I did not use any tomato sauce, only the ketchup.  

The only way that someone could rate this recipe poorly, is if they used 1 pound of ground meat instead of 2 pounds required in the recipe.  So, unless you adjust the serving size to 6 instead of the original 12, you will end up with sloppy meat soup.

Easy and delicious. My younger daughter said, “I don’t like meatloaf, but I like *your* meatloaf.” Followed the recipe but did use the cup of breadcrumbs (Italian seasoned) instead of the toast and crackers.

Really enjoy this recipe. It is very similar to the meatloaf my mom made. Love the flavor from the butter crackers and the sautéed onion and garlic. Mom only used raw onion and cubes of dried bread. Did sub Panko crumbs.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever used! Directions were simple and easy to follow, I didn't change anything on the recipe, and it turned out great! My entire family, including a very picky husband when it comes to meatloaf, devoured it and asked for seconds.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't like it at all! Very mushy consistency, and didn't taste like much. I will not make again.

Wow! The only thing I changed was to omit the bread crumbs and crackers, and add 2 cups crushed pork rinds (paleo-friendly). Everything else was exact to the recipe. The family loved it and are already requesting it again. Thank you for such an easy, delicious recipe!

This is an easy and delicious meatloaf recipe. I made it just as written the first time and found it to be a bit salty and the tomato sauce just seemed flat. Still, it was tasty. I made it again with a few changes and it was a big hit. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and used 1/2 cup bottled chili sauce (Heinz) instead of tomato sauce and used more chili sauce on top. A nice change for those who don't want a meatloaf that is too "ketchupy" but much more flavor than plain tomato sauce. I'll make this again!

I didn't alter the recipe and really enjoyed the flavour of this meatloaf. My Mom made many different recipes for this when we were young and so I have had lots of variety along the way. I would definitely make it again.

This was the best meatloaf I've ever made as well!  The entire family ate it, even my little ones (ages 3, 5, 7), without a complaint.  It was very moist and flavorful!  I did not add any milk to the mix.  The only change I made was to slightly decrease the amount of tomato sauce that was called for on top of the meatloaf.  (Personally I just don't love the flavor of tomato sauce and thought that amount would be too strong as a glaze.)   Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  It will definitely be my go-to from now on.

I made this as per the directions and was looking forward to a great meatloaf.  I was quite disappointed. The tomato sauce totally took over the loaf and buried the flavors of all the other ingredients  I won't be making it again.

Great recipe! I followed everything and it turned out perfect! BTW, I also used Ms Ilonka's suggestion to put 2 slices of bread at the bottom of the pan (to absorb excess juices). I gave those slices to my dachshund and he thanks Ms Ilonka too ;-)

This was definitely missing something. I think another egg may help since it is 2 lbs. Surprisingly very little flavor and the texture was...strange- I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think the sour cream was a good addition and really love sour cream. I try to find interesting but safe recipes that my fiancé and I may like, to try something different, but I'm going back to the classic back of the beefy onion soup mix box. Never fails me!

made it with a couple alterations...chopped onions fine with a ninja and put in raw...you cant see them but pow! what favor. no fresh garlic so used 1 1/2 tsp garlic granules. Did not have sour cream so substituted 1c of mozzarella. And i left out the tomato sauce, used the milk, and kept every thing else. IT WAS AWESOME! We will make this again. Hubby wants to renew our vows over this one!

I made some small  changes to the recipe. 
I added a small amount of bread crumbs and poured some of the tomato sauce on the top to keep the loaf moist  and it was honestly the Best meatloaf I've ever served my family

It was great...I just didn't have any bread in the house so I used bread crumbs!  Family loved it.  Oh, and I didn't add any milk.  Very Good.  Much better than the one I have been making for 30 yrs!

I used 3 lbs. of ground beef so I had to tweek my amounts accordingly. I  added chopped fresh garlic  to taste. I also  used ketchup instead of tomato sauce.  I used 1/2 cup  ketchup, 1 tsp. dry mustard and 1 tbsp. honey for the topping.  I put it on right away before baking.  This recipe is very easy to play with. We love this recipe. 2nd time I made it I put salsa sauce (1/2c) instead of tomato sauce.  I also used garlic powder since I didn't have fresh garlic. Always turns out.

Just below a packaged mix meatloaf, in my opinion. After all the ingredients I was very disappointed with it. I didn't need the milk since I used freshly ground chuck. 7 crackers... well I think grandma must have ran out of bread to compensate with the crumb. Still had to add more salt to bring out the flavor. Why cook the onion and garlic? Lost the flavor with that. It's better cold than hot. Won't be making this again.

This was a nice meatloaf.  I did add green pepper  to the onion/garlic sauté and I wish I had used more of the onion as I like a lot of veggies in my meatloaf.  It had a very nice flavor and I will be making it again with my adjustments.  I thought the sauce was a nice compliment and helped keep the meat moist.

Nice meatloaf - tastes like what I'd expect from Mom  I used 85/15 ground beef; I knew there would be grease to drain so I formed a loaf and used an 11 x 9 pan instead of a loaf pan.

Meatloaf is one of the best "all in one" meals, with addition of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. But THE ONLY "meat" I use in my meatloaf if Ground BISON, the taste SO different and much more enjoyable. Try and YOU will Love it! And that goes for Chili too!!

Tried it according to recipe.  It was okay.  The texture was good, but  I like my meatloaf with much more seasoning.

My kids (7, 5, 1), my husband, and I loved this and asked for seconds!!  They are already asking me to make it again. The only thing I changed is I did about 60% ground beef and 40% ground pork. It was super yummy!!!

Awesome recipe!  Though I did cheat and used garlic powder.  (Only because I didn't have fresh garlic).  Needless to say, this recipe was saved to my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I will definitely make again. I always use a muffin pan for my meatloaf just because it saves time on the bake time. This recipe made 24 meatloaf muffins so I froze 12 of them for another meal! :) Love that! My daughter that typically does not like meatloaf said she liked it and had seconds. The only thing I will change next time, though, is to add more garlic and onion. That's just a personal taste thing, though. The recipe as written is fantastic!

Was perfect! Did not change a thing! Definitely get the extra lean meat. I picked up 75 percent lean and needed to drain before adding the end sauce. Even my picky, takes forever to eat, 4 year old ate it in like 5 minutes and asked for seconds!

This was a really good recipe.  I did not have any tomato sauce so I took a can of diced tomatoes with green chili's (mild) and pureed it, substituted it one for one; I also substituted Whataburger Spicy Ketchup and this turned out GREAT.  I will be making this again.  P.S. my kids hate "spicy" and they ate this up.

This was good!  I didn't need to add milk at all, it was already wet.  I did use a pound of spicy sausage and 1.5 lbs of ground beef.  Yumm.  I didn't have crackers so did 4 slices of toasted bread.  Really notice that it was better the next day as it set so well.  Excellent out of the oven too, it was just not as molded together then.  I also dont like red sauce on my meatloaf, so I would skip that next time.

I liked this recipe, my family liked it too, but it didn't have the "wow" factor that I was expecting, based on the many reviews.  It was very flavorful, and if you are looking for a nice standard meatloaf, this would be a good choice.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my only reservation was at the very last step because it seemed so soupy that pouring milk into the mixture didn't seem practical.  I double and triple checked the proportions to make sure that I didn't make a mistake, but everything I did looked correct.  I ended up putting a bunch more bread crumbs in to make it thicker, and ended up not using the milk after all (which I don't think would have affected the taste anyway). The cooking times were perfect for this recipe. Overall, I think it is a nicely flavored meatloaf, but I may continue looking for others that give me that "wow" factor.

I've made this three times now, and have tweaked it very little. I use the crushed crackers, and enough bread crumbs to bring it up to 1 cup. And for the topping, I used spicy ketchup instead of plain. Next time I'm going to use half ground venison and top with some bacon slices. I've always loved meatloaf, but never really had a good recipe to use. This is my go-to, and I suspect it will be delicious no matter how I tweak it!

I did half ground beef and half Italian sausage I then added some prepared mustard, some horseradish as another reviewer suggested (glad I did) and some shredded cheddar cheese....Yummo, this is a really good recipe. The worstershire sauce really makes it.

Very good! It had a nice spin to it and both my husband and I enjoyed it very much. I am a "create as you go" cook and tend to use a recipe as a "guide".  Never measure but instead follow my own "more of this or less of that" philosophy and tend to improvise on what I have on hand. Thank you for your spin on meatloaf! Your recipe is in my file.

Something tasted not quite right here, although I believe this is simply my palate and not the recipe.  I ordinarily use ketchup instead of tomato sauce in my meatloaf and believe that is what I didn't like here.

This is the bewst I've ever made too.  The whole family loved it (even the pickiest ones).  I followed the recipe pretty close, only making some minor modifications for personal preference that really didn't have much impact.  I did follow the one reviewer's recommendation regarding the bread at the bottom to soak up the grease (one of my pet peeves of meat loaf) it worked well.

This is the best meatloaf recipe.  Changes were minor: used ground chuck, no milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons Lawry's seasoning salt with pepper.  Followed others advice and let the loaf sit about 10 minutes before slicing.  Very moist, good texture and not typical "bland" tasting.  A keeper!

My sister always said I made the best meatloaf, but she hasn't tried this recipe yet! I'm not usually a "recipe follower", I look through my cookbooks for inspiration, then do what will be to our taste. I decided to follow this recipe (except for the glaze). I don't like ketchup and usually just pour quite a bit of tomato sauce over my meatloaf, which I bake in a glass baking dish. We like to put the sauce over our mashed potatoes. Anyway, I followed the recipe, doubling it, for the meatloaf itself and it was DELICIOUS!!! I made one with tomato and one without. My sons, their cousin, and a friend didn't have any trouble finishing it ALL off! I mixed up a double batch to pop in the oven for dinner tomorrow...I'm hungry already!

I have never made meatloaf before either! What a great recipe, it was very yummy! Thank you. I added a few chillis into my tomato ketchup topping, just to give it a kick - we love chilli! Also didn't add as much milk, the meatloaf was already very moist.

I have been looking for years for the "right" meatloaf recipe...... here it is.  the only changes I made were accidental but it was  still the best meatloaf I have had in years.  I put the whole can of tomato sauce in(that was the accident), so I skipped the milk.  This worked out fine.  I also use that low cal. bread so instead of  toast bread crumbs I used some panko bread crumbs I already had in the pantry.  I cant wait to try it again.  I will keep the panko bread crumbs though that is the only change I will make, the flavor of this meatloaf is excellent!  I am writing this recipes in my cookbook where I pass on all my "family" recipes.

This was so good!!  It was easy and the best meatloaf Iv'e ever tried. The first time I made it I tried to cut it too soon to serve it and it hadn't firmed up enough and I mangled it. So be patient and let it rest when it comes out of the oven. I just couldn't wait but it gets better with time. The day after it tastes even more wonderful... hot or cold it's incredible so give it a try!

My family liked it, but it was way to salty for me and i only put a tsp of salt. No need for it with the salt in all the other ingredients.  I wouldn't put it up to 400 either. I have made more versions of meat loaf then I care to  remember. The tomato sauce is a preference of choice.  I usually put brown sugar, ketchup and mustard  but I wanted to follow the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I made a couple of changes.  I used ground buffalo (I live in South Dakota so it is easy to find here) and added diced roasted green chili peppers and as others suggested Italian bread crumbs.  I also added a dash or two of Tony Chachere's Croele Seasoning to give it a little zest.  It was very delicious.  Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe resulted in an OK meatloaf, but definitely not the best I've ever made.  I could probably made changes, but then it's not this recipe.  I won't be making this again.

Just got up from the table.  YUM.  Good flavor, good texture.  Not a lot of salt (like with soup mix).  Hubby loves meatloaf.  THIS IS a keeper!

Very good, very delicious, very moist.  If you like a little "kick" to your food, I would use arrabiata sauce in place of the regular tomato sauce :)

This is not the best meatloaf I've ever made.  I made it as it's written and I found it to be just blah.  I also did not like the sauce, way too tomato-y.  Would be better with plain ketchup, bbq sauce or even honey mustard.  I will not make this again.

The meatloaf was very flavorful but it was a bit too wet - I mixed the 2 pieces of toast with bread crumbs but I think I needed to add more.  Next time!  :)  I also used the suggestion of putting 2 pieces of bread on the bottom and it really did soak up a lot of the run off!

2 time making this meat loaf. Only one modification, I added Italian bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers.. the first time i mad it i had alot of juice in the pan so i drain it then put back in the oven.. wish i didnt do that cause it was tasty but dry. the second time around i plan to leave the juice in the pan. My bf really liked the meatloaf, great thing about it is the recipe calls for all house hold ingredients.. didnt have to run to the store for this meal, had everything right at my fingertips.  this was indeed a last minute, what to cook meal which is perfect. thank you for the recipe :)

I made a half a recipe of this to try it and now I wish I had made a whole recipe it was so good! It tasted even better for lunch the next day. I didn't need the milk as I do not live in a high altitude area. I felt the amount of pepper was too much, so I added one third less and still felt it was too much pepper but still it was very delicious. This will be my meatloaf recipe from now on, and I have copied it out to give to my friend tomorrow!

Everyone love it!!!  My 6 and 2 year old both asked for seconds.  I made a few changes, I didn't have everything the recipe called for and I was being lazy;)  I didn't sautee the onions, I just threw them in raw and I also used italian bread crumbs instead of toast and crackers(like others suggested).  No fresh garlic, substitute with garlic powder and I topped it with cheddar cheese instead of ketchup.  Sooooooo good, I will be making again!

This recipe was great!  I lightened it up a bit by cooking the onions in spray butter, using whole grain bread, and a 1/4 cup egg beaters.  It came out tasty and moist.  My husband, myself, and my 2 year old daughter loved it.  It also makes great left overs...still moist the next day.  Thanks so much for my new meatloaf recipe.

This is the only meatloaf I have ever made so I hope it's not the best.  My husband who is normally not a huge meatloaf fan thought it was great.  Me on the other hand, I like meatloaf & thought it could be better.  Our kids, indifferent.  :)  I can't pinpoint what I didn't care for but there was something.  I'll try it again but might try to figure out what it needs next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! It is the best meatloaf ever. Thank you for sharing this!  Even my picky eating kids love this!  (and that's saying something since my daughter hates hamburger meat!) Serve with mashed potatoes and everyone is happy! not to mention the meatloaf sandwiches the next day. Try this, you won't regret it.

sorry but I just didn't think this meatloaf was all that.  I made it following exact directions.  It needs more of something, maybe more salt or a kick to it.  Don't think I'll try it again.

This is a VERY good meatloaf recipe - stayed very moist and was not too dense  - I was a little concerned about that with all of the ingredients, but very well balanced.  This one is definitely one to try.   EDIT:  Wow - you know how dry and icky meatloaf gets when you reheat the leftovers - NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ONE!  After having it for lunch, it almost makes me want to make it, then throw it in the fridge just for the leftovers!  Even better than just cooked!!!

What did I do wrong ? After following the recipe & adding 1 Tbl dry steak seasoning, it ended up a sloppy mess.When I turned it out of pan,it fell apart, just hunks of gr beef. The taste was ok, but I reviewed the recipe & found I'd followed it exactly as posted. Quie an expensive mess.

I just tried this tonight and my only complaint is that I got full too fast, because I just wanted to keep stuffing my face with it.  As my husband put it, the reason this is so amazingly good is because with most people's meatloaves the only really great part is the top with the sauce and the rest just tastes like old hamburgers- this one is great all the way through and the part with the sauce is so good it's better than dessert.    I didn't have enough tomato sauce to put half for the loaf and the other half for the sauce- so I just used what I had (8oz) in the loaf and used plain ketchup on the top.  I also didn't use the milk and didn't use any salt (cutting back) and about half the pepper (my husband doesn't like a lot of pepper).  Anyway- super recipe and I will DEFINITELY be making this again and probably making double batches next time!

These were great. I didnt follow the original recipe though...I didnt have butter crackers so I smashed up some homemade garlic croutons. I also didnt use tomato sauce. I mixed bbq with liquid smoke, honey,  Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and formed them into meatballs. Came out great.

This recipe was too moist, to the point it was mushy. I did not like it, and neither did my family. Maybe we just like our meatloaf firm and NOT the same texture as raw hamburger meat.

Amazing! I cook varied styles of meatloaf (Italian, BBQ, etc) once a month, but after tasting this, my family voted to up it to once a week... in place of the all-time favorite spaghetti!  Only variation:  I use 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground pork in everything that normally would call for beef to cut $$.  I did so here as well, and that works fine. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this recipe.  We all thought it was the best meatloaf we'd ever had.  I did make a couple changes though.  Like a few others, I used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh ingredients, but then I also used Dale's Steak seasoning instead of the worcestershire and threw in some chopped roasted red peppers I got out of a jar from the grocery store.  The roasted red peppers added a tangy sweetness that complimented the recipe really well.

This was so good. ***Attention those of you that cook wild game!!**I seldom cook with ground beef, I use ground elk and this recipe was perfect for the lean, sometimes dry, elk.  The sour cream did amazing things to the texture of the meat.  I will make this again and share it with my elk-cooking friends!  Thanks for the recipe!

This meatloaf truly is delicious. Plus, it can be tweaked to fit your own tastes. In my family, we love garlic, so I add an extra clove or two. I also leave out the crackers and add just a little more tomato sauce. 
You really can't mess this one up! We make it alot in my house :)

It was really good and super moist! I have never had a meat loaf that was moist and did not fall apart before so that was a plus. I did a few things differently, i add about a cup of bread crumbs (probably a little less) And only added a half of a clove of garlic, i am pregnant right now and garlic tends to make me sick, it would have been really good with the full amount but was good without. i only used 3 teaspoons of milk and i ran out of sour cream so only added about 3 tablespoons. all in all it was a great dish! and the cooking times were right on it came out perfect!

I made this last night. For the most part, it was very yummy, but I felt like it just missing something in the middle. I think next time I will add a spice, oregano or thyme or maybe a different kind of cheese. Very good recipe though - hubby loved it.

This was the first meal I made in my new house!  I'm just getting into cooking so figured this was the perfect thing to try and boy was I right!  I used 2 slices of bread on the bottom before putting mixture into the loaf pan, to soak the excess liquid up, and it came out great.  Only thing I plan on trying next time is BBQ sauce instead of ketchup/tomato sauce.  That's how I normally like my meatloafs and I think this will be great with it!

Very very good. I left out the sour cream and added breadcrumbs instead of crackers and it was so amazing I am trying the recipe as is even though I dont like sour cream.

Also added a little bit of brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. I plan to add diced peppers and hot sauce next time. 

I used 85% lean chop meat and let the meatloaf cook in its own juices, I highly recommend it. The meat was so tender its unbelievable.

OK, maybe I shouldnt do a review, as I changed this quite a bit to suit or healthier way of eating. I used 90/10 hamburger, fresh minced garlic & onion (so I didnt use the butter), I used 1/8 c of fiber and 1 tbsp flax seed, ground together and used in place of crackers. Used 2 pieces of toasted diet wheat bread, sugar free ketchup in place of tomato sauce, FF sour cream, FF milk, egg beater in place of egg. I left recipe pretty much in tact I guess, I just used low cal and lowfat versions of the ingredients. We really enjoyed this, BTW, too!  :)
very moist and flavorful

Very good recipe (I would rate 4 1/2 stars if I could).  It is actually the "best I've ever made", but you have to understand my other meatloaf recipes would receive three stars.  My family enjoyed this meatloaf and there were no leftovers.  The butter crackers and sour cream were unexpected additions but made a difference.   Use only LEAN ground beef, otherwise I would think it would be swimming in grease.  Thanks for sharing.

This really IS the best meatloaf ever, but it was a wee bit bland. I've since adjusted the recipe by adding more onion, more garlic, a little more black pepper, and some red pepper flakes. I also give the glaze a dash of tabasco. The milk is overkill, as well -- the loaf is plenty moist without it.

I didn't use all of the milk recommended, but it was very juicy as a finished product. Followed the rest of the recipe exaclty and it turned out to be very tasty. I will make this meatloaf again very soon!

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have any crackers, so I used 1/4 breadcrumbs instead of the 3 slices of bread and crushed a handful of cheddar goldfish instead of the buttery round crackers.  Also, I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I used A1 sauce.  It was a fabulous meatloaf!  It was even better as leftovers the next day.  Very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have a lot of meatloaf recipes and I really think this will be the one I use from now on!  It's easy, uses basic ingredients, and delicious.  My whole family loved it!

Good but a little too "moist." I will definitely not use milk next time.

This was-- in a word-- AWESOME!!!  The only things I changed were 1) used Garlic-Herb bread crumbs instead of bread/ crackers, and 2) decreased the amount of tomato sauce on top a bit.  We LOVED it!  It was moist and sooo flavorful, and held together perfectly.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  We had company for dinner, and every single person at the table gave this a "10"!

This was delicious.  We halved the recipe because there are only 2 of us, but I wish we hadn't!  The only change we made was to use "meatloaf mix" rather than ground beef-yummm!

Well, this was pretty good. Hubby and I went back and forth between a 3 and a 4, but I thought it was a bit much effort for the result hence the 3. This was somewhat average, especially considering all of the steps and ingredients. Thanks anyway.

Way too mushy, the consistancy was like fancy feast pate cat food! I like my meatloaf very firm and savory.
I would not make meatloaf this way ever again.

I rated this excellent even though it was far more involved than any meatloaf than I've ever made before!  Since I had some Cabbage Steaks in the oven, I put the meatloaf in the microwave for 10 minutes at 70%.  When the oven was available, I cooked it in there for 10 more minutes, then added the topping, cooked it another 10 minutes.  Next time I won't use the milk as it made too much liquid.  It was delicious, but there was twice as much topping as I needed, so I put it in a cream pitcher and we poured it on our slices.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had! I love meatloaf anyway, but this one is juicy and bursting with much more flavor than I've experienced with other recipes! I realized after I started preparing that I had no sour cream :( so I substituted with plain, whole greek yogurt. Seems to have worked. I also used plain unseasoned bread crumbs instead of actual bread slices. Winner winner meatloaf dinner!

We loved it! I changed the bread and crackers for Panko crumbs (you can use gluten free as well), half and half for the milk and added cheese. I added a little sharp and some grated Parmesan.

Delish!!! oh and for the topping, I used balsamic ketchup, a little salsa and chili sauce.

I followed the recipe but I left out the milk, added dijon mustard and a tsp of cumin. It came out amazing, lots of flavors, softer then I'm used too but it didn't fall apart and I periodically drained the fat during the baking pro ess. I also used brioche toast and club crackers.

I am not a big meatloaf lover but I made it for my grandson birthday .  It was delicious.  I will make this again.  I am going to try ground turkey next time.   The changes I made was that I used 1 cup of italian bread crumbs instead of the bread & crackers.  I also used light sour cream.

Very good recipe, however i made some modifications: used half pork and half ground beef. Used dried French bread about 4 slice es, therefore needed to add more milk like half a cup. For the sauce at the end i added to the tomato sauce and ketchup, a can of condensed tomato soup, teaspoon dijon mustard, and half a cup of water. I poured half of it on the meatloaf at the end to bake for another 10 to 12 minutes on 425F.  It was soooooo good. But i needed this recipe to get me started and i usually end up changing things a due to availability of ingredients.

A complete disaster. I followed to recipe to the letter and it came out a soggy, loose mess. Inedible. What a waste of time and money. I'd like to know how others arrived at a successful dish with this recipe as written. They must have made some adjustments.

I DID grow up on Meatloaf, but my mom, bless her heart, made dry meatloaf.  Your recipe was excellent!!  Only thing I did a little differently was to put a litte Sweet Baby Rays Barbeque sauce in the meatloaf itself and in the glaze topping and a little Sweet Chili Sauce.  It came out beautiful!!  Moist, but firm and its got so much flavor.  My husband loved it, too!!  Thanks so much!

I didn’t have meatloaf growing up so I don’t really know what to compare this to. But I loved it. It was tasty and my family liked it as well.  Very easy to make! I’ll be making it again.

So I made it. And I really have a pet peeve with people who make a recipe and change it and then try to critique it, so… I made it EXACTLY according to the recipe. I don’t know why but it did not want to stay together- the more I sliced towards the middle the more it crumbled and fell apart. I am 52 years old and have made many many meatloaves. This is only happened to me one other time. ?Actually it was another recipe from this website. I Don’t know what is going on but I’m going to stick with my “what do I have in the refrigerator “recipes. Also expected more flavor punch considering all the extra effort I had to go through to make this recipe exact.?

Great recipe, simple.  The baking temps are a real asset.  I never thought of increasing to 400 degrees.  I always add 1 hot Italian sausage (stripped out of the casing) to the beef.  It doesn't add a lot of heat, but offers a pleasant flavor.

This meatloaf is fantastic.  I followed the directions except I accidentally used Mexican hot tomato sauce.  (Only half of a 7oz-ish can) it gave it a nice flavor and no one minded.  I will be making this dish often!

I added more crackers and bread crumbs instead of bread.  I added more onion and garlic then called for.  it turned out amazing.  I also added brown sugar to the top sauce.  That gave it a little more sweet zest, instead of tasting just like tomato sauce.....

Absolutely loved this meatloaf.  One of the best I've ever made.  The only thing I did different, was I did not add milk.

I did like this and will try again. I think I will add a little tomatoes paste to the meatloaf to add a little different taste. I remember my mother made a very good meatloaf and believe she probably added ketchup or tomatoe paste to give it a little sweeter flavor.

Excellent!  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and bread.  It was just easier.  I also put bread beneath the meatloaf to absorb grease, which worked well.  This is great for leftovers too.

I'm a good cook. Usually. Meatloaf has never made my list of cooking accomplishments. But this one is great!  I finally passed the meatloaf test with my boyfriend, who is a huge meatloaf fan (much to my personal dismay). Thank you, Sillyliltracy!

Simple to make, plus I had everything on hand.  I didn't have ketchup so I just added a Tbsp. brown sugar to the tomato sauce on top.  I halved the recipe -  my husband gets two meals out of it.

The first time that I made this dish, it was good but, yes it was a bit bland. I made it ag as in last night (12/11/2018) and I changed up the ingrediants just a little. Instead of tomato sauce,    I used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste diluted with 1/4 cup of water, and the same amount of ketchup. As well I added one tablespoon of red pepper flakes to add some spice. about ten minutes before done I topped the meatloaf with a few good squirts of ketchup. These few small changes gave the meatloaf a much more robust flavor.????

I love this meatloaf the crackers and Worcestershire sauce is what makes it so good I add 1 bunch of chopped green onion and to keep the meatloaf from splitting I put a glass casserole dish half filled with water on the very bottom rack works like a charm and for the topping I always add tomato paste ketchup and brownsurgar.

Will definitely make it again. I made half of the recipe and used some oatmeal in place of the crumbled toast. Did not put the topping on because we do not like too much tomato sauce. Both my husband & I decided this recipe is a keeper.

Not the biggest meatloaf fan...but sometimes you just need some hamburger variety.  This is one of the better recipes I have tried.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Didn't have enough tomato sauce for the topping, so just used a mix of ketchup and HP steak sauce.  It turned out great.

Tastes amazing and very easy to make. I added about 2 tablespoons of sriracha to the ketchup sauce added on top towards the end of cooking. I sliced the meatloaf and put it in the oven for an additional 15 min to further brown some edges.

This recipe was great. I skipped the sour cream. But I added everything else. My meatloaf was juicy, and flavorful. It was the best I have ever made. It was the I have ever tasted. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

I have to laugh at the people who say this was good and then tell us  they changed some of the ingredients.  If you changed the recipe, you didn't make THIS meatloaf.  You made your own version.

Four generations approved, even my 91 yo grandma who says she can’t taste anything anymore. Gobbled down by her and my teenager too. Changes made to this recipe: seasoned bread crumbs for the toast and crackers and 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef. Oh and no milk, I may have used more sour cream than what was called for. Cooking times were spot on.

Yummy! I used Green Onions in the place of the onion. I sautéed the Gr. Onion in Olive Oil (instead of butter), and then added the diced Gr. Pepper to the pan for short time.  I used a homemade steak sauce of : 3TBSP ketchup, 1 TBSP Worchestershire Sauce, & couple dashes of Tabasco Sauce. I used 1 C. of Rolled Oats for the filler (instead of bread crumbs).

Have made this 4 times now. Tried to cheat last time by using the food processor for the toast and crackers and that did NOT work - final product was just not as tender; seemed overworked. This is a really great meatloaf and has the  superior rating of 'not disgusting' by my kids. Win!

This recipe brought compliments from my husband, which is rare...he never complains, but also rarely gives a compliment. This was perfect comfort food.  I used Horseradish Aioli instead of sour cream, and used partial Seasoned salt with the salt, and partial Penzey’s Mural of Flavor with the pepper.  I also used Seasoned bread crumbs instead of the toast and crackers.  I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in the sauce.  This is a definite keeper!

I made this last night.  My picky 8 year old even asked for a second piece.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I added more ketchup. Since I used dehydrated onion and garlic powder I didn't need to use butter.  I also didn't add the milk. The only negative was that it didn't slice nicely, it fell apart but the flavor was great.  Next time I will use more toasted bread or Panko crumbs.  I reduced the recipe to made 6 servings which changed the egg to use 1/2 of an egg.  Next time I will use the entire egg.  I will make this my meatloaf recipe from now on.

Excellent. I used store-bought Italian bread crumbs instead of crumbled bread, but everything else as suggested. The best thing is the use of tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Less sugar and better taste. I'll use this recipe as my standard

My new go to meatloaf recipe!   I’ve tried many new meatloaf recipes this last year or two  and this one is my winner.  It’s great just as written.
I did end up adding dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar to the topping on my third go round for a little more zip but the basic recipe is very good.

I added some basil essential oil to the topping and it was so aromatic and delicious! My hubby said he might would have liked some bell peppers in it to make it a little better! I will try that next!

Very very tasty, nice and moist and popular with my family.  The ONLY change I made was for presentation and was to add a sprinkle of oregano on the top during the last 10 minutes of baking.   Great recipe!

Lots of tweaks.  Mix of ground meats, 73% beef, elk, pork and a little ground sausage.  All spice and ketchup instead of tomato sauce.

This turned out to be the base for the best meatloaf I"VE ever made!!  I added one packet of onion soup mix and used 80/20 beef.  There was a little fat to drain off, but made for a great tasting loaf.  I also added two gatorade type scoops of oatmeal instead of the bread.  Delish and will become a staple at our house.  I have tried to make good meatloaf my entire life, and only now have I been successful.

I enjoyed it and so did my family. It is first time since I took up cooking I cooked something I would refer to as family comfort food and not spicy like most of what I cook these days. I did not add the milk as I am no anywhere where it is that dry I would need to. I also put the tomato paste in half with BBQ sauce and did not use ketchup as it is one of the things I prefer not to eat. My wife still makes the best meatloaf I have ever had this good but not the best.

I used Italian bread crumbs because I didn't have any crackers, and it really was The Best Meatloaf I've Ever Made. It was moist and delicious the evening I made it for dinner. I froze most of it in individual portions, and it was still The Best when thawed and reheated for sandwiches. This is a new family favorite :)

This is great. I use breadcrumbs instead too but one day I'll try the bread just to see the difference. I only did breadcrumbs for convenience purposes. my dad is a picky eater and he loves it. I'm about to make it for the 4th time so thought I'd write a review while at it

Wow!  I thought no other meatloaf recipe could top my moms but this one did.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I added some tomato juice and then didn't add milk. Came out perfect.  Oh,  I also didn't add the tomato stuff on top just because I've never liked it.

It had a good taste but unfortunately I may have added too much sauce to the meat. The sauce made the meat too moist. I had to drain off the liquid after it had cooked for the first 40 minutes.

I used 1lb 85% Lean Ground Turkey and 1lb Ground Sausage.  I excluded the Milk, When I added the Ketchup I topped it off with 2 squirts of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.  It tasted great!  When I made it the other way it was good, but my updates made it excellent.

I will never use another recipe again-absolutely delicious! I've made meatloaf w/ turkey, lean ground beef, fatty ground beef, beef mixed w/ sausage & veal, & this was the most flavorful, moist I've ever had! I followed the recipe using Ritz crackers & Hunts tomato sauce, but it doesn't need sauce on top if you don't want to. If you want to add some veggies for those who don't like them, ground up 3/4 cup of raw broccoli and toss that in-they won't even know it's in there!

I’ve made this several times and it is my go-to meatloaf for a traditional dish. It takes everything I hated about meatloaf growing up and fixes it. I haaaaated crunchy, raw onions in meatloaf as a kid so never added them as an adult. These sautéed onions cannot be overlooked though!  The cracker/bread options aren’t fussy which is helpful. Ive used white, whet, or whole grain bread, buttery crackers, wheat thins or triscuits without any issue. The only change I make is that I sometimes add a splash of Buffalo sauce o the glaze. Also, this recipe can be halved with no issue at all. It’s delish!

I made it pretty much like the recipe with a few exceptions, the meat I use 1lb ground chuck and 1 lb ground pork and for the bread I used whatever salad croutons I had in the house.  I am not a fan of meatloaf have it once a week growing turned me off but  I really liked this one.  Hubby likes meatloaf and leftover for sandwiches so I tried several others.  He said through the others out  keep this one

This is the worst meatloaf I have ever had. I followed the recipe to a "T", but it turned out mushy (probably because of all the bread and Ritz crackers). Thoroughly disgusting, and totally inedible. Don't waste your time and money on this unpalatable recipe.

This is the BEST meatloaf recipe I’ve ever made!!! To make it even better, make a sauce with 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar,  2-4 tablespoons of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of ketchup. I top the meatloaf with the ketchup in this recipe and serve this sauce as I plate each piece of meatloaf. THe combo is amazing!

Have made this several times exactly as written. Today, I misread the recipe and used 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of the 15. Well. I’ll never use the 15 again. Did not need the milk. It was fine with 4 oz of tomato sauce. My only meatloaf recipe and it’s a winner. With mashed potatoes and creamed corn, nothing better

I have tried making meatloaf from other recipes and it was either too bland or dry. When I decided to use this recipe I was very pleased with the results. I have actually made it several times and finally decided to write a review. I like how the cooked onions give the meatloaf moistness and flavor.  This has become a favorite at our house. I followed the recipe as it is and think it is delicious!

I added fresh thyme to the onions and garlic. In addition, I used a can of tomato paste, 1 tablespoon dijon mustard, 7 additional crackers, 2 tables heavy whipping cream vs. milk, 1 teaspoon dried cumin, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika. It was moist and very tasty :)

It’s true, the best I have ever made. I did tweak it :  added 1 C chopped celery, doubled the garlic and used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce ( I was out of it), skipped the Ketchup. I will make it again and again. Thank you sillyliltracy.

Great meatloaf, mine came out perfect.  Followed the recipe except the milk.  Whole family enjoyed it , and the leftover meat loaf sandwiches were awesome.  I’ve used V8 instead of tomatoes juice in other meatloaf, very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't use milk and it still turned out quite watery when using extra lean ground beef. Next time I will strain that excess water before putting the ketchup and tomato sauce. I also added bell peppers to the onion mix and sauteed them and it was delish. Used half ketchup and half bbq sauce as well.  Good recipe with some changes!

I love this meatloaf, but my hubby said it was too juicy. He wants one that's "drier and more well done." So if you don't like a juicy and flavorful meatloaf, don't use this recipe. Geesh!!

Great recipe as written. My only change was that I added a few shakes of worcesterchire sauce to the topping and next time I will add the topping a 1/2 hour the meatloaf is done to give it a more cooked taste. Very moist and delicious. Loved the toated bread idea. Thanks for a yummy meatloaf recipe.

I left out the sour cream, and my husband didn't care for the tomato sauce topping, but all in all, it was easy and great , and you will be proud of yourself for making something that tastes like you spent hours and hours making! Made this for a friend to take to his wife for her birthday, and they all loved it!!

Really good and will definitely make again. Only ended up using 1/8 c. milk. Cooking timing was perfect. Used 1 c. breadcrumbs instead of bread. Added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning. May cut back on the salt and pepper to 1 tsp. next time.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made! I've made others claiming to be 'the best', but found this title a little different, so gave it a try, and it was awesome! As I have to cook gluten free, I skipped the crackers which I didn't have, and threw in a fourth piece of GF toast.  I used Greek yogurt as I had no sour cream on hand.  Thank you for this delicious and slightly different meatloaf! Very flavourful.

I’m giving it 3 stars here because although it tasted pretty good, it came out like mush. I had to microwave it several times to get it to where it was the consistency that my family would eat. I’m not sure if it was the breadcrumbs or  all the liquid, but we followed the recipe exactly, and it didn’t have that nice solid consistency. Now, I have to say, I didn’t do the crushed crackers and dried bread but use breadcrumbs, and since there wasn’t a measurement for that, I estimated around a quarter of a cup per pound of meat. Whatever it was, it definitely didn’t have the consistency I was expecting.

I bet I've made 15 different meatloaf  recipes over the years. I have not changed since I found this recipe.   This is definitely the best meatloaf I've ever made.

Pros: moist
Cons: bland meatloaf with super-sweet sauce on top

This meatloaf is completely bland.  I followed the recipe as written, except substituted Italian breadcrumbs for the bread and crackers.  One would think that would have added flavor, but it did not add nearly enough!  While this meatloaf did come out very moist, it lacked flavor and the ketchup/tomato sauce topping was a one-note super sweet addition.  I'm not impressed.

I made this exactly as directed and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans for Sunday dinner to my husband and son tonight. Husband raved about it, said flavor and texture were great and he's looking forward to the leftovers. Son liked it but prefers a "dryer" meat loaf. Unfortunately I'm on a strict diet so I didn't get to have any myself, but I could tell that it was very moist and did not fall apart coming out of the pan. It also smelled great while it was cooking. This is a definite repeat - I look forward to tasting it myself one day when I am about 90 pounds lighter!

I added red bell peppers, I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce instead. I also only used the crushed ritz crackers and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. My family said this was the best ever!

Excellent and very easy to make with things you have on hand.  Very moist and delicious.  I did not top with the ketchup and tomato sauce, but used ketchup, mustard and maple syrup that I 've used on other meat loaf.

I loved this recipe, the only thing I'd do differently is cook longer, cook for 2hr30-45min but other than that this is an amazing recipe, very easy and very tasty.

Good flavors and perfect cooking time.   I added just a dash of oregano, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was good and a keeper.  I would probably add a few more spices the next time I make it, just to take it from four stars to five.

Just put it in the oven smells GREAT! I substituted onions for fresh green bell peppers, and the Worcester sauce with some of my own homemade barbecue sauce.

Lots of flavor & very moist.  It is very good but not your typical meatloaf.  Flavor is very different than the usual meatloaf recipes.  So if you're looking for something different, give it a try

I don't understand people who give a recipe 5 stars then note an abundance of changes they made to the recipe. Makes no sense to me. Anyway, I made this according to the instructions with no deviation.  The completed meatloaf was mushy on the outside & much to dense on the inside.  Then I made it using Panko crumbs rather than soft bread and omitted the milk. Much better! It had the right texture for a meatloaf & decent flavor. However I still like my recipe with chopped bell pepper, chopped onion, cherry tomatoes cut in half with a crusty Parmesan cheese topping better.

Every time I make this for company, I am always asked for the recipe.   I add some fresh parsley, and leave out some of the salt.  But other wise the recipe is perfect the way it is.

This was a pretty good meatloaf.  We have 3 favorite recipes that are in our normal rotation for meatloaves.  This one didn't quite make it to add to our regular rotation, but will still be a nice addition to make on occasion, when we are in the mood for a more classic style meatloaf.  I went by the recipe except halving it, since it was only 2 of us, and also added in some additional seasonings like parsley and italian seasoning.  It did need some additional bread crumbs and crushed crackers to make it bind together better.  Also we like our topping a little sweeter, so I had to add in a little brown sugar and a dash of worchestershire sauce, to zip it up for our liking.  The meatloaf came out extremely moist and made a great dinner.  Thank you for the recipe!

This will now be my standard for meat loaf. Given that I had a skillet with bacon grease left over from breakfast, I fried the garlic and onions in that rather than butter and will continue to do so! Adds a tang, as does the use of a bit of smoked chipotle pepper sauce.

Accidentally added the ketchup to the meat mixture so I left out the milk. Added seasoning salt and mixed 1/2 can condensed tomato soup with the remaining half of sauce for topping. Didn't have bread so used unseasoned stuffing cubes. Only had garlic butter Ritz so I left out the sautéed garlic. I also shredded some mild cheddar into the meat mix. Baked exactly as directed. BEST meatloaf I have ever tasted. I woke up thinking about it and ate it for breakfast...I'm not even a meatloaf fan!

Excellent flavor - I subbed mayo for sour cream. Would leave out the milk next time as it was plenty moist. Will make again :-)

My husband who normally does not like meatloaf loved this one!  Even though I completely forgot to sauté the onions and garlic and put them in meat mixture raw!  I did change up a few things for my taste...  Used 1 cup of italian bread crumbs in place of bread and crackers,  added 1 tbs of A1 sauce and a pack of McCormick meatloaf seasoning.   And for the glaze I added 2 TBS of brown sugar, 1/4 ketchup, 1/4 tomato sauce, 1/4 c of sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce and a tsp of dried mustard..  Served with homemade mashed potatoes and peas!  YUM  Next time I will NOT forget to sauté the onions and garlic!  :)

I made this recipe using a lil over 2 lbs of lean ground beef I had in my freezer that I had to use b4 the month was gone.  We had company coming from out of state &, since I hadn't been feeling so well, I wanted to make something I didn't have to fuss over by adding things after baking or stir or marinate, etc.  The only thing(s) I did differently (from suggestions) was use tomato soup as I didn't have ANY catsup (never w/o catsup in fridge, but...it was gone!) & added 2 lil packets of horsey sauce from Arby's I had in fridge w/all the lil packets of soy sauce, hot sauce, etc. from take out restaurants that I keep on hand, just in case)

I used 8 oz can tomato sauce to mix in meatloaf. I used 1 6 oz can tomato paste plus 1 cup water and added 4 T catsup instead of 3 for the sauce on top of meatloaf.. I stuffed 4 large poblano peppers, which I cut in half and baked with sauce on top. It was delicious.

Instead of tomato sauce or ketchup on top of loaf,  try a table spoon of ketchup, table spoon of mustard and table spoon of brown sugar mixed together ...it is awesome

I always make it a point to follow a recipe the first time as is but I did leave the milk out this time. And I'm glad I did because it was just fine and very moist without it. Really enjoyed it! Thank you for sharing (-:

Made it again this week and it is just as wonderful the second time around.      

'The only dish I have ever given a five to.  I made it a couple of weeks ago and will be repeating it tonight.  We love it.

Very flavorful meatloaf.  Like many others I used 1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the bread, and no milk.  I also use more onion than what is called for.  Best if very lean beef or sirloin is used.

I grew up on meat loaf and think this sounds wonderful.  However, I have a Gluten Free daughter. Has anyone tried to change adapt this recipe to GF? If so, I would love to hear from them, as her family will be here this weekend.

This was really good! Like others, I did not need the milk and added a bit of Italian seasoning. It was really moist and tasty. My family does not eat meatloaf- I make it about once every few years!! I think it's great comfort food. I insisted they try this and they liked it. Thank you!

Unfit for human consumption.  I am the easiest person in the world to feed but this was really bad.  Slimy, tasteless and I don't get sour cream on anything but buffalo wings.  Worst meat loaf I have ever had.  I don't cook too often but maybe I will quit after this.

Such a delicious meatloaf.  .  I added more ketchup to the topping as I love the sweet vs. savory compliment.  This meatloaf is very tender and rich.  I live alone so it lasted me a few days but I enjoyed every bite!

This meatloaf was super moist and quite dense.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and placed two slices of bread at the bottom to "catch the grease".   The bread sort of melded into the bottom of the loaf, so next time I'll just use a little rack.  My sour cream was out of date so I was glad to see other's substituted mayo.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Next time I might try another reviewer's advice to add cubanelle peppers.  Really nice recipe!

Used panko bread crumbs and cooked in turbo cooker. 5 minutes high then turn down to medium for 10 minutes until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees. Kind of band so try other spices. Very moist!

My family of 5 was not impressed.  I did not add any milk and the meatloaf was mushy.  I thought the bread and crackers would take up all the moisture, but even with 3% fat meat it was standing in  juice.  I will have to keep looking.

Next time I make it I will use less salt and pepper.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the toasted bread.  It was delicious.

This was so good! I used ground chicken instead of ground beef, and did what another reviewer said by putting some bread under the meatloaf to soak up the grease. My housemate was actually baking something at 385 degrees celsius, so I just put it in there for 20 minutes then added the sauce and baked for another 15 minutes. I also used shallots instead of onions because that is what I had on hand, and replaced the sour cream with mayo. I also used wheat bread. Additionally, I added seasoned salt and garlic powder to the mixture. Ready to make this again!

I have made many recipes on this site (and others) and am an experienced cook. I followed the recipe and used high quality ingredients. This was ho-hum. Not bad but so many of the other recipes are much better. This will be removed from my recipe box. My recommendation - move on to another recipe.

Only one comment: PLEASE do not cook the garlic for five minutes! add the garlic to the pan 1 minute before onions are  done. The garlic oils  and flavors will be obliterated at 2 minutes and the garlic will be dark brown yuk after five minute!

Myself, husband, and son just enjoyed this meal (I paired it with mashed potatoes and garlic-lemon brussel sprouts). Realizing every individual has there own "pleasing palate", this recipe was on point for it's flavor AND the title. It's a keeper and  it'll be shared with family and friends. Mahalo!

It was OK, but nothing special.  Followed the recipe and could tell it was too moist.  I added some more bread to soak up the moisture, but it still failed to fully firm up the loaf.  I will not use this recipe again.

This recipe gives new meaning to meatloaf!! I have never made a new recipe that hands down everybody loved and can't wait till the next time I make it. My picky daughter asked me the next day when I'm making it again and her boyfriend ate 3 huge slices!! I made it exactly the way it said other than using lean beef. Fantastic!!! That's all I can say!

Nice flavors and consistency. This recipe was well-received at home. While I didn't need the tomato sauce and ketchup topping, my family (who usually tops meatloaf with ketchup) liked the top tomato layer.

We did not care for this recipe at all.  While the flavor was okay (pretty average meatloaf flavor) it didn't crisp up on the outside at all and the inside was mushy (despite being cooked through). We threw it away. :(

I'm sorry I did not care for this at all.  It was mushy, not tasty at all.  

I made this for company, ended up freezing it and making my old recipe in a hurry!

Delicious, This recipe took me a lot longer to make because I mad my own tomato sauce. I don't like the can tomato sauce at all. Plus I can control the salt, I have high blood pressure so i have to watch my salt intake. My next time making this recipe I'll be using less of the tomato sauce as it was a little moist. It still held together though.

The meatloaf was a success indeed.  I substituted the butter with olive oil as well as used crispy Italian seasoned panko crumbs in place of the crackers and toasted bread.

This meatloaf was delicious and very flavorful. I have to admit, I'm quite surprised it stayed in the loaf form. I expected it to fall apart. It was a savory recipe and was a huge hit with my children.  I'll definitely make this again. It's so nice putting something in the slow cooker and not having to think about it until it's ready.

My family said this was the best meatloaf ever!!! Instead of sour cream I used miracle whip, and instead of beef, I used ground turkey, instead of 7 buttery round crackers I used 5 saltines, instead of three slices of bread toasted and crumbled I used a frozen poptart. I seasoned with cumin and red pepper flakes to give it some KICK!! Hubs LOVED it!!! Even my daughter, who has always been a very picky eater when it comes to meatloaf, LOVED this!!!!!! It was a BIG HIT!!!!!!

Gotta try it!!! Of course, I added a bit to the recipe...I didn't have tomato sauce! EEK! But I did have Tomato Basil Bisque soup! I didn't have butter!! "What!" Kourtney without butter!!! I used olive oil instead. I only had panko bread crumbs and toasted rosemary sourdough. I doubled up on the yellow onions - used 3 eggs - 2.43lbs of ground meat - added Worcestershire and A1 - toasted my spices and used a mortar and pesil to grind it up - used Half and Half instead of milk - added mayo - my glaze on the top was ketchup, brown sugar, tomato basil bisque soup, salt, pepper, toasted spices, lemon juice...yummmmy. I served it with sauteed spinach and a potato galette!

I almost followed recipe exactly. The changes I made were 2 slices of bread toasted instead of 3, and added 1/4 C seasoned breadcrumbs in place of the third slice.  I cut the toast up really small because I didn't want big chunks of bread in the loaf.  The tomato sauce didn't appeal to me, so instead, I added 1/2 C of Heinz chili sauce to the meat mixture.  For the topping, I also replaced the tomato sauce with 1/4 C of the chili sauce, and spread it on the top of the meatloaf once about half way through cooking, and again the last 15 mins.  My son said it was the best meatloaf I'd ever made!

I do not like to ever give negativity to anyone, but I didn't like this at all.  Won't make again. Going back to my regular recipe.

There are a hundred ways to make meatloaf, and for me, simple but delicious is the way to go. I didn't see the point in adding sour cream to a meatloaf recipe, or putting crackers crumbs AND bread crumbs in it. And then milk. I thought this was a waste of time, sorry.

It was a hit with the family.  Made it with scalloped potatoes and green beans.   It is in the keeper file for sure.

Loved this recipe, but I used Italian breadcrumbs in place of the toasted bread, and tomato ?? soup in place of the tomato sauce.
My family LOVED it and I will be making it again.

I made this and it is very good. I always try to make any new dish by using the exact recipe the first time I make it, but in this case I don't eat bread or crackers so I subbed for those ingredients by using an extra egg and 1/2 c of grated Parmesan cheese .  That worked perfectly as far as texture goes, so that might help others who eat low carb or gluten free. It had a very good flavor and was very tender and tasty. If I could, I would rate it 4.5 stars. With a little tweaking this could be a five star recipe for me. It needed a  little more zip in my opinion and I will add some finely diced green pepper and possibly a tablespoon of horseradish or mustard.  Finely chopped mushrooms might also be a good  addition. As it is, it is still quite worth making and I really enjoyed eating it.

It was delicious, moist, and nutritious.   My family wants me to make it every week.  I served it with garlic mash and asparagus on the side.  It made get sandwiches the next couple of days.  Great recipe!

I used all the changes on the most helpful review plus added one or two of my own....didnt have any buttery crackers, so crumbled butter and garlic croutons instead.  I also added some sweet chili garlic A1 steak sauce.  This was absolutely an explosion of flavor...my whole family loved it!

I made this for dinner last night but only had 1 1/4 lbs of lean ground beef so I adjusted the amount of the other ingredients accordingly.  I did not have to add any milk.  Also, I did not put this in a loaf pan but used the sturdy oval pan with handles that I always use for meat loaf.  This was a delicious version and it came out nice and moist.  I will definitely be making this again!

Sooooo freakin good! Followed it really close, added more crackers and less bread, and for the glaze I didn't use tomato sauce, but ketchup, Worcester sauce, brown sugar, sirracha, and tobasco. It was perfect. I'm a hugs fan of meatloaf, and this just took over as my favorite. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and French green beans. Amazing

Everyone loved this dish - even my kids (which is amazing)!  I didn't add the full 1/4 cup of milk due to living in FL and we have a humid climate, but I did add some milk by "eye-balling" the amount because of the crackers & bread, I did not want the loaf to get too dry.  

The only thing I will do differently next time, is to add 1/4 tsp of yellow mustard and some brown sugar to ketchup/tomato sauce topping (whisked well)  because it will give the loaf a sweet/tart glaze which I've used on my meatloaf recipe prior & it tastes excellent.  With the spices in this recipe, I believe it would be a great combination.

Besides that, it was fabulous!!

This is a wonderful meatloaf recipe.  I used a cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs in place of the bread.  Delish!

Tasty, but a little mushy for my families liking. I'll try combining this recipe with my normal recipe next time.

The meat loaf had a very good taste to tie and the family really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately,  the meat loaf fell apart when I was taking it out of the roasting pan even after I let it rest for about 5 minutes.  I'm going to try using less liquid the next time I make it and there will be a next time.

I found this recipe  and read all the reviews.  Made it the same day, and I have to say, it was the most delicious meatloaf.  Easy to make, and my husband loved it and he said it did not repeat on him.   It gets Five stars from me!

I upped the spices, so it wasn't bland.  I made it with turkey because that's what I had on hand, and the sour cream really helped with the Turkey's moisture which tends to be dry.  We'll make this again.  By the way, this is great leftover for meatloaf sandwich.

This recipe is excellent! I've been making meatloaf for 50+ years, very similar to this recipe. It was great to find a recipe so close to an old family traditional meatloaf. The only thing I did extra was to add a little mustard and sugar to the topping. I do believe the sour cream gives this meatloaf that little extra boost that earns it the word "Best" in the title. Thank you for sharing, sillyliltracy. :)

Overpowering Worcestershire  flavor.  Next time I will use half the amount of it and only 1 small garlic clove.  I covered with ketchup only and served with brown gravy and mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was okay - definitely not the best I've had.  I feel like it had the consistency of a regular hamburger.  I usually make mine w/o a recipe and use at least 2 eggs, double the crackers, and use oatmeal rather than breadcrumbs.  I think I'll stick to my old tried and true  meatloaf from now on.

I'm a meatloaf skeptic in a house of meatloaf lovers. I tried this one a few years ago. It lives up to its name and then some. This is only only meatloaf I ever make now.  Only thing I changed was using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the sliced bread.

Meatloaf must have chopped onions or what I love the most is a package of dry onion soup mix . Italian bread crumbs will also work as well as toasted bread or crackers.

I had to make changes... I didn't have worcestershire or the time to saute the onions and I had three pounds of meat, 1 part veal, 1 part beef and 1 part lamb. I subbed whole wheat bread crumbs for the white, and  2 jumbo eggs... had to add a bit more of everything because the recipe only calls for 2 pounds of meat and I had three. Had parmesan, a bit of sharp cheddar and a bit of three cheddar... so I ended up with a three cheese meat loaf. Also I subbed thawed frozen garlic cubes (3) and onion powder (2 tsp) for the sauteed onions and garlic. However, I felt that a 15 oz can of tomato sauce would be too much for even the 3 pound loaf  I was making, so I only used an 8 oz can. And made my own catsup blend to go on top with mostly catsup, a dollop of mustard and a bit of brown sugar. Very flexible recipe that let me do all that and it still turned out lovely.

This turned out really tasty and moist.  I did make a few changes however.  Only used about 3/4 cup of dried bread crumbs, left out the tomato sauce and added about 2 tablespoons ketchup instead, added a tablespoon of steak sauce.  Didn't really top off with the tomato sauce and ketchup.  Husband loved it and he is a picky meatloaf person.

Tasted fantastic, but I was not able to get it to hold its form. It crumbled when i tried to cut it. I will definitely make it again to see if I can figure out where my error was.

Painless and simple recipe. First time making meatloaf and it came out delicious. Of course I seasoned the meat to my liking, but I did not really have to change anything. I did however use breadcrumbs instead of the crackers and did not need the milk. My bf enjoyed it who is not a meatloaf fan :) .. the meat makes a ton of grease, so you have to be sure to drain it all. Overall, great recipe.

Hubby gave it 5 stars, saying it smelled fantastic when he walked in and paired with mashed potatoes, it delivered your title of 'best I've ever tasted' all the way.  I used a sweet BBQ on top and had to substitute crumbed dressing from Pepperidge Farm for the bread and crackers due to the grandkids' recent visit and pillage of the carbs on hand, but otherwise I stayed true to your ingredient list.

This is by far my favorite recipe for meatloaf. The toasted bread is the secret flavor as well as the sour cream. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and wanted this for dinner over the Thanksgiving meal. The only thing I didn't do was put the sauce on top of it but I will this time. Can't imagine it tasting any better. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I'm a "Meatloaf Hunter" - lol ... always on the hunt for a great, new meatloaf recipe & this one delivers as per title!!  Meatloaf is served weekly at our house...cause I absolutely LOVE it!  But I do change it up each week - Italian style, glazed, Mexican-style, my list goes on & on - but this recipe now has a permanent place in my collection. 

I appreciate the creativity that went into your recipe.

This was a simple and quick recipe to pull together. Easy cleanup. Although the taste was good I couldn't say it was the best  meatloaf I've ever eaten. I have to say that Mom's still ranks the highest. When I get a moment I will post the recipe.

I took a chance and made this meatloaf for my guest. We all enjoyed it. I followed the instructions but made only one addition. I added finely chopped green peppers and cooked it along with the onions and garlic. Five stars!

It was good, but not great. Used 1/2 ground beef & half pork, go with leaner ground beef, it was super greasy. Also very salty.

In addition to each of the steps:
2. Soften vegetables (Saute or boil): Onions, Green Peppers, Celery, Garlic, Carrots, etc.

3. Mix meat and egg last to allow for tasting. Add vegetables and 1 can of tomatoes, drained. Add BBQ sauce to taste.

5. Add BBQ sauce to taste.

Moist and scrumptious! Best meatloaf I've had!
I omitted the bread and crackers, substituted with 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I took tips from other reviewers and added 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar to the glaze- came out tangy, sweet, and not too 'ketchupy'. Definitely will make again, hubby loved it! :)

I made this yesterday for my husband and kids.  Normally, meatloaf is nobody's favorite dish at my house, but this time everyone just loved it.  Even my 8 year old ate it and liked it!  The only thing I skipped was the sour cream, but only because I didn't have it.  
It is a very tender, juicy and flavorful meatloaf.  Loved it!

This meatloaf is awesome.  But....it's even better the second day when leftovers are used as a pizza topping!!  Just break it up into small meatball sized pieces and sprinkle it on your pie before baking.  Now THAT's some serious comfort food right there!

I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more onion and garlic and an extra egg for 3lbs of meat. It was absolutely delish, and my 3 year old cleaned his plate, which is even better! :)

Made this tonight and it was a hit with my finicky teenaged son, so I KNOW it's a winner. Lol! I took some suggestions from other reviewers:  I put two pieces of bread down on the bottom of the loaf pan (I use a glass one) before putting in the loaf, and it works like a charm to sop up the extra grease, while baking. I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of toasted bread and crackers, and I skipped the onions and garlic part entirely; with the Italian breadcrumbs, it just wasn't needed. I also put just a splash of whole milk in (it states that it is optional) and  I also added a few teaspoons of ketchup. Last but not least, I used a mixture of Italian  sweet spiced pork and 90% fat free ground sirloin. The flavors in this meat loaf are out of this world and it came out very moist (but not mushy like some others do). I will definitely be making this again!

I've tried many different meatloaf recipes over the years, and this is my new favorite. Even my husband loved it, and he's not generally a meatloaf fan. The only change I made would be one pound ground beef and one pound meatloaf mix, but I think it would be just as good with straight ground beef.

Omg!!! The BEST Meatloaf I have ever made or eaten!! Only thing I changed was I added garlic powder to the onions cause I didn't have garlic cloves. And I didn't need milk. I used gluetin free bread, toasted. Added some gf crackers instead of Ritz crackers and I didn't have tomatoe sauce so I used a can of petite tomatoe pieces In a can. I had peas and mashed potatoes with it!! To Die For!!!

I didn't have tomato sauce so had to use ketchup.  Didn't need to use any milk. Best meatloaf I've ever had, and I usually don't like meatloaf. I'll definitely make it again, probably next week.

Very delicious and the best I have ever made.  The only thing I would change is I would  use a larger loaf pan.

It was great! Used approximate amounts of everything and it turned out fantastic. Used seasoned Panko. Added a dash of steak sause, liberal italian seasoning, bell pepper to onions, and I used tomato paste instead of sause, so I needed the milk, but it was yummy!

I made some changes. I used 2 eggs, 3/4 cup milk (no butter) 1/2 cup plus a little more Progresso Seasoned Breadcrumbs instead of the crackers , 1/2 teaspoon sage, and 2 chopped shallots. I  topped it with 1 cup catsup, 1 teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Also, I used 1-1/2 pound of meatloaf mix meat which I can get at my local butcher. This looked pretty mushy when I put it in the pan. Cooked it to 160 degrees, which only took 45 minutes. Oh wow, this was so moist! My husband loved it and ate the leftovers all week. I served this with sweet frozen corn grilled with diced walnuts and lime juice, and mashed potatoes. Heated up some mini cheese muffins I had made for a club meeting that were too good to take. Sliced fresh fruit and ice cream for dessert. Yum. So yum!

We Made this meatloaf last night exactly as stated and cooked it in a 13x 9 pan instead of a loaf pan. It was wonderful! The loaf was moist but not soggy, and it was so full of flavor! I especially liked the tomato sauce topping. The sauce cooked on top, but stayed semi moist because you add it on at the end of baking. The sauce was not dried out at all, and really added a lot to the taste. It's kind of like a built in topping! This was very Simple to make, and the kids enjoyed it too! I am truly not a meatloaf lover, so you can imagine the looks I got when I went back for a second helping!  I am thinking of making a sandwich of this for lunch (if there is any left) because I would bet it's even better on the second day! I already know that I will be making this meatloaf recipe  agin and again. Thank you!

I was trying to find a good recipe to use with venison...and this recipe hit the mark.  I did skip the bread ingredient, because I was afraid it would make the loaf to dry. I did use the crackers, though. And, because I like cheese, I added a cup of fresh shredded cheddar cheese. The meatloaf came out delicious, moist, and full of flavor. I did add a steak spice (Mr. P's or Tricky Dix Mojo) to the mix to remove the gaminess of the venison. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe as meatloaf cupcakes. I  stuffed each with a little shredded mozzarella and cheddar. After they were done I added the creamy mash potato topping with a little more shredded cheese and bits of bacon. My entire family loved you it,  but complained that I didn't make more.

Made many different meatloaf recipes and I think I have finally found THE ONE! Super simple but big on taste. Definitely going to be my go to from now on. The only change I made to the recipe as written is I added about 1/2 cup (maybe a bit more) onion instead of the 1/4 cup called for.  I was afraid the salt and pepper would be too much but didn't want to change anything until I tried it. As it turns out, everything was perfect. Not sure why some rated this as bland-four adults and we all thought it was wonderful. Other than the additional onions, I won't change a thing. :)

Awesome  recipe, I added some shredded  carrot, zucchini and diced green pepper  just to beef up the veg content. I didnt have the butter crackers so I used the snack crackers I had on hand (vinta). I substituted  the sour cream with tzatziki. I also omitted the tomatoe  sauce for the topping and used 1/4 cup ketchup and brown sugar and a tblsp of spicy yellow mustard. Everyone loved it, it is the best recipe I have come across thankyou!

This is indeed the "best meatloaf ever" the texture was "smooth" & I liked the flavor of the onions being cooked first. I used half ground turkey & half ground beef, panko instead of the toasted bread & crackers, & only 1/2 of an 8oz can of tomato sauce. (I didn't use the tomato sauce & ketchup on the top of the meatloaf either) In step # 3, it was helpful to read "the mixture should be moist, but not soggy".  I did need to cook it for 10 minutes longer for it to reach 160 degrees internally. Every one liked it & commented it was the best meatloaf they had tasted - I served it with mashed potatoes & gravy.

Loved this recipe. Made it pretty much according to the instructions except that I used A1 sauce instead of ketchup only because I discovered that I didn't have any ketchup when it came time to finish up the meatloaf. I used 92% ground beef. The meatloaf was really tasty and really moist. I didn't need the milk. Definitely will become a regular in our house. I divided it into 7 portions. Each has 316 calories, 15.8 grams of fat, 15.8 grams carbs and 27.4 grams of protein.

This was really good and very similar to the way I make meatloaf. I use 2 slices of white bread (not toasted) and I put it in a bowl with the milk over it while I prepare the meat. Then i add the soaked bread and milk to the mix. I usually use saltine crackers but ritz are good too. I don't care for the tomato sauce. It's perfect! Makes a great sandwich the next day! Great recipe. I think I will try the cubanele peppers and horseradish next time :)

This meatloaf is delicious. I pretty much folkiwed the durectiins except I had 2.35lbs of meat so I increased all of the other ingredients a little but. My one suggestion is to put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan. The grease spilled over and the whole house filled with smoke. Of course if I used a second loaf pan this probably woukdnt have happened. I did need to cook the meatloaf longer but that was expected. Family of picky eaters lived it except my princess eater who barely tried it.

By far this is the best and simplest meatloaf recipe I've made. Since I was out of minced onion I used a little fresh onion chopped finely and it turned out terrific. The real test however was my wife and kids.....They LOVED IT!!!!

This is the BEST meatloaf I have ever made! Seriously! I've tried many recipes from this site, but none compares to this. It is so tasty, moist and just plain delicious! No tweaking done. I followed the revipe exactly. The amount of milk I added was 2 tblsp.

Very good meatloaf, I would highly recommend! Made on a snowy day and couldn't get to the store so substituted bread and crackers for Panko bread crumbs. Worked perfectly!

Very easy to make.  I will add double the onion and maybe another garlic clove next time.  It was deeeeeelish.  Checked the temp and it was at 145°  came back soon after and it was nearly 180°.  Yikes !  It was still moist and tasty.  My mom said it was the best she ever had.  I think 1/2 lb of ground pork would enhance as well.  There were 3 of us.  We all loved it.  Had 3 slices left for the next night and no one complained.  Then my daughter was gone the second night and my mom opted to eat her piece (now 3 nights aged) and she loved it all over again.  Oh....instead of ketchup and half the can of sauce I added some bbq with the sauce.

I'll definitely make this dish again.  Thanks for sharing!

I am going to try this tonight but with gluten free pancake mix instead of bread...wish me luck!! I usually make meatloaf in the slow cooker, but went skiing today instead of prepping (...it happens in Colorado). :) Sitting here on the mountain googling meatloaf recipes and going crazy about this one! Will post back later, thank you so much for sharing!
Lindsay, Dillon CO
..... Meatloaf came out amazing and my son said "mom, you HAVE to make this all the time!!! PLEASE!" Success is say. Thank you again!

Followed as indicated, but used Ketchup vs. tomato sauce, and didn't pre-fry the onions.  Came out incredibly moist; and the onions perfect (not to soggy, just a little crunch).  Loved it and will make it again.  Perfect addition with our regular Sunday pasta.

Absolutely sensational. I rarely eat beef and since this was an indulgence, I purchased organic beef from Costco.
If you crave meatloaf this is by far the one to make.
Thank you for the recipe.

I made this last night and OMG!! So good! I used Italian bread crumbs as some other reviewers did (instead of the bread and crackers), but that's the only change I made. I typically make meat loaf with ground turkey, just to stay away from red meat, but I went ahead and used ground beef this first time. WE will be having the leftovers tonight, and this will be a frequent dish. Thanks sillyliltracy, for this recipe!!

Made it last night and it was really good. I didn't add the milk, because it was pretty moist already, but then again we live in Florida (wet air). I mixed all ingredients and cooked like it said, but after the extra 15 minutes it wasn't at the internal temp of 160 degree mark, so I cooked it until it did and then put the last two ingredients on and cooked for the extra 10 minutes and then Bon appetit. Family loved it.

It was great!!!! One reviewer stated that they did not like the tomato Paste on top, but the recipe does not call for tomato paste, it calls for tomato sauce with ketchup.

I made just as instructed. My first thoughts after trying this "Not as good as the recipe off the Quaker Oats box", but I have to remind myself that that this is a different type of meatloaf. It has good flavor and makes a great cold meatloaf sandwich:) Next time I'll cut back the WOR sauce just a bit, and increase the tomato sauce that you put into the meat mixture by 1/8c. leaving the remaining sauce for topping oz.(the topping sauce is too much as instructed).)

My family loved this meatloaf and I enjoyed making it! I've made other meatloaf recipes in the past but my boys wouldn't touch it. It's been years since I've made meatloaf and reintroduced it to them. As they watched it cook in the oven they became anxious and when I served it they ate it all. My oldest son and husband even had seconds. It gave us a whole new outlook on having meatloaf. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans, this made a perfect meal.

I made this meatloaf for my boyfriend. He loved it. My son told me it was a 9 out of 10. (kids) lol. It was very moist. (I omitted the milk) It had lots of flavor. I also used bread crumbs in place of the bread. Very Very Good!

Too salty and I think it was due to the worcestershire sauce plus the salt.  Next time I will use less of each.

It was okay...a little mushier than my regular meatloaf recipe. I give it a firm not bad.  The great thing about this is everyone would most likely have all the ingredients on hand at any time so it's not without its merits.

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe and it really was THE BEST meatloaf I've ever made!  Or had, for that matter!  I did not need to add the milk, as the mixture was plenty moist as it was with the addition of the sour cream.  Who would think about putting sour cream in meatloaf?  But it really works here.  I didn't notice any distinct flavor of the sour cream, but it sure made the loaf moist.  My entire family loved this and I will be making it again.  This would be a nice "company" meal too.  I served this with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed asparagus.

Oh yes, everyone who praised this recipe is correct. I usually alter recipes to my own liking but I followed it exactly. I didn't really care for the idea or process of crumbling up toasted bread, but I did it and it came out fabulous!  I did pour off the fat right before covering it with the tomato sauce.

The name says it all. It truly is worth the little bit of work it takes. I had actually stopped making meatloaf because I'd never found a recipe that came close to the meatloaf my mom used to make but voila', this recipe is the greatest. I wouldn't change a thing!

I made this with 1/4 C uncooked oatmeal...and 7 Saltine crackers instead of the breadcrumbs and  buttery crackers as specified in the recipe.  Makes enough for 8 servings (I made in two portions and froze one).

I made this recipe tonite and altered it somewhat. It was absolutely incredible. I substituted and used sliced italian bread (toasted & chopped), I also used 6 slices of bacon chopped (cooked)in the mixture and placed 3 slices (uncooked) on top. Everyone was thoroughly impressed with my 1st meatloaf. Thank You sillyliltracy!!!!

I love this with slight changes. I lay bacon over the top of the loaf before it goes in the oven. I also add brown sugar to the mixture of sauce that gets poured over the loaf the last 10 minutes.

Everyone loved this! I made mine out of pork, because my daughter doesn't eat beef. I covered it with bacon to make it more moist and left off the milk. Then I topped it at the end with homemade bbq sauce, same daughter doesn't like tomatoes/ketchup. My substitutions aside, I'm sure this would've been great as written.

I have never liked meatloaf! When my mother made it for me growing up it tasted like a giant hamburger patty. My husband asked me to make a meatloaf for him one Sunday and I found this recipe. Wow this was delicious full of flavor and now it ha become a staple in my meal plan! LOVE IT!

I made a few small adjustments.  I did half beef and sweet sausage, a few shakes of hot pepper flakes and 1/2 C of Parmesan cheese.

When internal temp hit 155 I took it out of oven, drained the fat and served.

Simply delicious!  Looking forward to sandwiches for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe! The only thing I did different was add a 1/2 a pack of meat loaf seasoning. Also, instead of ketchup and tomato sauce on top I mix together ketchup and some Worcestershire sauce for the top.  My kids were fighting over the last piece, will double recipe next time.

This came out absolutely amazing. I did not add milk and I used 1.25 cups of Italian bread crumbs instead of the bread and crackers. I also used a "for meatloaf" can of tomato sauce that just had a bit of seasoning in it. I have to say this is one of the most moist, delicious meatloaf recipes that I've ever had. Thank you so much! I will be making this again

With a couple of changes, this will be my go-to meatloaf recipe from now on.  My whole family loved it.  I omitted the bread and tripled the crackers.  Added some bbq sauce to the mix and omitted the tomato sauce all together.  Mixed up a topping of brown sugar, mustard and ketchup for it.  Also, I won't bump the temp up to 400 next time.  The temp of the meat got over 180 doing that so I'll just leave it at 350 next time.  Delicious!!!

My husband and two boys are picky eaters.  My boys snubbed their noses at the thought of "meatloaf".  But I got three thumbs up after they tasted it.  The only change I made was substituted BBQ Sauce for the ketchup just to suit our tastes.  This will be my go to recipe for meatloaf from now on.  Thanks!

Absolute perfection. I added brown sugar to sauce which was nice. I used whole grain bread and crackers and it still was the moistest meatloaf ever. HUGE hit with the family.

This was VERY good.  When I was making it, I thought it was a lot of pepper, and it is peppery, but I really liked it.  It's very moist, but still holds together well, has a great texture.

Really liked this meatloaf!  I almost always use ground venison in place of ground beef, so the sour cream added some much needed moisture to mine as venison is a very lean, drier meat.  Will make this recipe again and again!

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made!  It was very simple and quick and tasty.  The only alteration I made was the sauce, I added half and half of the tomato sauce and ketchup because I prefer ketchup more than tomato sauce.   I would make this again in the future.

This was not a bad meat loaf.  It tasted good, but wasn't what I expected after reading all of the reviews.  I thought it was rather bland and had it in my mind that the garlic and onion flavors would really pop out a little more.  I will compliment that the directions were very clear and easy to understand.  The times on cooking were also spot on!

I have made this MULTIPLE times.  Usually my meatloaf is improvised by what is leftover in refrigerator.  This recipe is delicious and always moist.  I double the recipe and use the rest of the sour cream in my mashed potatoes with some cheddar or taco cheese.  Add a side of sauteed spinach or escarole with garlic and pine nuts and the meal is great for additional or unexpected guests.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty, easy to make.  I made it in a small roasting pan instead of a loaf pan, put the ground beef on top of some bread (I read some where that the bread absorbs the grease).  The meatloaf had a great flavor.  I'll definitely make it again.

This IS the best meatloaf I've ever had. The only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of italian bread crumbs for the toast and crackers. It is excellent!

This recipe was just o.k. I've had a meatloaf recipe from the back of a box of Quaker Oatmeal for 40 yrs. & I guess I'll just stick with that. Do enjoy trying all the different recipes though.

This meatloaf recipe was ok. I have had much better...followed the recipe to a tee, and it turned out mushy, not firm. Maybe add more bread or a package of stovetop stuffing to it? Hopefully it makes better leftovers than a first-serving meal.

It was very good and moist.  Not sure I would say it's the best meatloaf I've ever had but very good and would make again.

Good meatloaf not the best I've ever had though. I guess nothing can compare with mom's meatloaf, which I can't duplicate:(

This is really good!  I will be making this again very soon.  I skipped the bread and added breadcrumbs instead.  And used half the tomato sauce and a few tbsp of ketchup in the meat.  I did not put any sauce or ketchup on top, since I don't like ketchup in my gravy!  Superb!

Great meatloaf, very moist! I think 1/4 milk is too much though. But overall I think it is the best meatloaf I've ever made too!!

Delicious!  I changed the meat to half beef and half pork and uses V8 instead of tomato sauce.  Will definitely make again.

It is true - it is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  It is so moist and tasty!  My husband normally doesn't like meatloaf, but he requests this at least once a week!  Great recipe!

just for the heck of it I tried this recipe,and it was right on the money. Thank you so much for the idea. I didn't have the canned tomatoes,I used a can of italian stewed tomatoes with oregano instead. Man was that tasty.
