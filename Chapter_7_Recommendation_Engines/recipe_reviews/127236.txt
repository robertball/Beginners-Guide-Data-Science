This is really nice. The cheesecake layer baked perfectly, no cracks. But I only baked for 45 minutes and let the cake sit in the oven for 15 minutes more.

Oh man...this is delicious!  This is one of those recipes that people have already asked me to make again.  It was sooo good.  I baked the brownie layer for about 5-10 minutes less than the recipe called for and I also baked the cheesecake layer for less time as well.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese (neufchatel...sp?) and it was still super rich.  Will definitely make this again!

I've seen this recipe before, except instead of making the brownies from scratch it called for using a mix.  It turns out so good, and is much less time consuming!  You just have to bake the brownie layer for the time of a 9x9 pan on the box.  I always decorate it with a ring of sliced kiwi around the edge and cherry pie filling in the middle.  Perfect for Christmas.

Very delicious cheesecake! I didn't have baking chocolate, so I used semisweet chocolate chips and reduced the sugar a bit. Everyone loved the chewy brownie layer and creamy cheesecake layer.

This was excellent!!  I used a boxed brownie mix and baked it in a 9x13 pan for easier cutting.  I added fresh orange zest to the cheesecake - it was so good with the chocolate!  Easy and impressive :)

I found it simple to make and the flavor is lovely.  The brownie bottom was quite hard - difficult to cut hard.  I stuck to the recipe and if I try it again I'll try baking it less.

This cheesecake was AMAZING!!!!!!! My husband doesnt EVER much care for cheesecake OR brownies, but I cut this cake it 8 pieces, and he ate ALL of his piece, and then took some of mine!!!! I only had 2 boxes of cream cheese, so I substituted the last box for 8 oz of ricotta. Also I used fat free egg substitute instead of eggs, and I didnt have unsweetened chocolate, so I used Ghirardelli's Gourmet 72% Extra Bittersweet Chocolate. It was so Fantastic!!!! REALLY!!! I followed another users idea, and only cooked it for 45 mins, and then let it set in the oven for the remainder of the time. I also made a caramel sauce and drizzled it on top when I served it, alongside nonfat chocolate frozen yogurt! Superbly DIVINE!!!

This rich dessert is one of my new favorites! The brownie is moist and fudgy. The cheesecake is soft and airy. A delicious combo!

Wonderful.  The second time I made this I put cherry pie filling on top.  We just couldn't get enough of this.  Took it to a meeting and it was the only dessert that was completely gone.

Yummy! Followed ingredients to a tee (aside from using store brand!) Did decrease brownie layer bake time by 10 minutes...I do hate hard brownies! Result was scrumptious...this was my trial run for Easter...the only change I will make next time is some chocolate chips in my brownie batter...trying to replicate my fave boxed ones! This is a keeper!

Not bad, I don't know what I did, baked for the stated time and temp, but crust got a little hard. Topping pretty good, really rich.

We have made this recipe a couple times -- well, my sis has once and my boyfriend has, too.  It is devine!  Very rich.  We used economy brand cream cheese and sour cream and it was still scrumptious.  Highly recommended.

I really enjoyed making this cheese cake! It comes out just like the picture, and the working time is less than an hour. I just followed the recipe, and the brownie bottom got all moist. After baking it in the oven, I left it inside the oven while it cooled down. The I put it into the frigde and left it there for about 24 hours. Even the guests that wasn't really into cake liked this one! They even requested the recipe. It's a hit!

Outstanding for a formal dinner, or holiday. I add a chocolate glaze drizzled over the top. My best dessert yet....and I love desserts.

I made this according to the directions, it turned out perfect. The only advice I would add is to drizzle carmel on top of this and serve with vanilla ice cream.
