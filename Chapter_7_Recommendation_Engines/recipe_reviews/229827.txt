Not our favorite.  There is nothing really wrong with this salad except that is so plain.  If you need a very basic potato salad recipe, this one is for you.

Followed the recipe as written. Whole family liked it a lot. The only complaint was that it was a little sweet. I'll definitely make again but use less sugar.

The dressing is really creamy but not heavy. Yet given Baking Nana's warnings, I did add a bit of Goya Adobo to the salad's parts before adding the dressing. Good stuff!!
