Excellent! So much better than I thought it would be! I added a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning instead of the Seasoned Salt and also added a 4oz. can of chopped olives. A food chopper is a must to get the surami, celery and onions chopped in small pieces- a great time saver too.

Keeper!  So easy and so delicious.  This is one of those go to recipes when you need something delicious, quick and impressive. My celery stalks were not very big so I used more than 2 stalks.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Delicious.  Guests raved about it.  I put too much mustard in so I tried to dilute with sour cream.  Used some Frank's Hot Wing Sauce for an extra kick.  Turned out FANTASTIC!

It was pretty good. I used 1 package of imitation lobster, and then a can of pink crab and a can of white crab. I really liked it - but barely any of my guests even tried it! I think it is good for "taste-specific" people. A lot of people would rather have the mindless cream cheese and meat fatty dip. I think this is a fresh, tasty dip - just know not everyone might be interested...

Great dip! It was thick and hearty and could easily be served with crackers, bread, pita chips or bagel chips! It was a great hit and super easy to make.

This made a delicious dip, and plan to serve tomorrow for a super bowl party if any is left. Used leftover lump crabmeat rather than imitation & 1/2 cup roughly equal parts of mayo & sour cream; substituted green onion for onion; omitted mustard; added optional diced black olives & Frankâ€™s Hot Wing Sauce. Expect to use imitation crabmeat next time. Thank you Arizona Desert Flower for sharing your recipe.

Very good.  I chopped the imitation crab very finely so this was more of a dip than a salad.  I added a tiny bit of sour cream.  Next time I think I would switch out green onion for regular onion and I would DEFINITELY add those chopped black olives!  I didn't have any on hand but I think they would have really been wonderful in this dish!

Made this for a party.  Didn't change anything except had to use dried parsley instead of fresh.  Everyone loved it.  Didn't add the optional olives.

Very good! I scaled it down to 3 servings, enough to generously stuff a small pita bread. I liked the 'zip' this had to it; a nice change from other crab salads. I actually used the dried minced onions (was a little leery about it), but they worked out perfectly (no crunch etc).
