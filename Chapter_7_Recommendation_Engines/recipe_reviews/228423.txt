This is my 1st ever review, so bear with me.  I made this yesterday.  I already had my little hand mixer out, so I used that on LOW, in a tall glass measuring cup, to mix and incorperate the butter. Worked like a charm.  Crust was very easy to press into the pan without the usual "slick" sliding around of melted butter.  Since I was in a dire emergency situation, (if I didn't get something cheesecakey in my mouth soon, my head was going to explode!) instead of the fridge, I put it in the freezer for about 30 min instead.  Pie sliced cleanly and without any crumbling.  I'll use this one again.

This was quick and easy to make.  I was too lazy to measure crumbs, so simply followed another reviewer's suggestion to crush one sleeve of graham crackers.  I crushed the crackers in a sealable plastic storage bag, added the sugar, then the butter and mushed it together.  After shaping and chilling the crust for an hour, I filled it with this site's recipe for "Key Lime Pie VII".  My guests could not stop talking about how wonderful it was.

This is how I usually make my graham cracker crust, though I do add a little less sugar---about 3 tablespoons.  I do not like the box of already crushed crumbs but rather the more uneven type that you get when you use the rolling pin with the crackers in a baggie.  If I'm using Honey Maid brand, I use a packet and sometimes even add just a few more crackers so I have a thicker crust.  I do put it in a 350 degree oven for about five minutes to let the butter and crumbs come together.  Love this crust!

The use of softened instead of melted butter absolutely was a great call. I very much enjoyed the consistency of this crust; smooth and crumbly at the same time. It didn't have the overly greasy/buttery, too saturated crust that I got with pouring melted butter over crumbs. Using softened butter makes the butter spread more evenly among the crumbs. I got another tip on this site to place the graham crackers in a large ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to crush them, which yields smaller crumbs than doing it by hand. This makes for an even better texture. My brother specifically requested a sweet potato pie with graham cracker crust for Christmas and as he was eating this said "I could eat the crust all by itself!" Absolute winner!

I found this had way too much sugar. I don't even think I would want to use this much sugar in a cheesecake recipe. But I like the simplicity of the recipe. I did notice on the graham crackers box that there was a crust recipe which just added butter.   I feel compelled to try that one instead.

I usually buy premade store bought crust. I was going to pick one up however, they were all broken. So I decided to try making it instead. I bought graham crackers (16 crackers, 2.5" squares = 1.5 cups) and pulverized it in a blender then mixed in the other ingredients. Used a measuring cup bottom to press down the crumbs. I only refrigerate for 30 minutes and used the key lime VII recipe. After refrigerating overnight, the crust was firm and didn't crumble as bad as the store bought ones and tastes fresher and way better. Thanks for the recipe.

One wax paper package makes enough for one pie. (There are three packages in a box of graham crackers.) This crust was quick and easy to make and it baked nicely. Will use this recipe again!

Make sure you use graham crackers with no added fructose corn syrup or "Surgar Tops". Any added "sugars" will change the recipe.  I have made so many graham cracker crust and they are always too sweet and/or fall apart. I made this recipe just as written with no changes. This is the perfect graham cracker crust! My search is over! This will be what I make from now on. The softened butter is the key to this crust. Let it soften on the counter NOT in the microwave. After you have made your pie and chilled it, you should put a little hot water in the sink and hold the bottom of the pie for about 20 or 30 seconds in the hot water. It will be easy to cut and not stick to the bottom of the pie plate. Glass pie plate is best.

The taste and texture of this was wonderful!  I had a little trouble getting the pie out of the pan, so I might butter the pan next time.  (I have a glass pan, so it might not be a problem if you have a non-stick pan.)

A simple recipe for one of the simplest pie crusts.  Made my own crumbs with mostly graham crackers and a handful of shortbread cookies we had on hand.  Refrigerated overnight before filling with key lime pie ingredients - which cooked for 30 minutes at 375 and made the crust even more delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty, and easy, especially since I mixed it all up in the same ziplock I crushed the crackers in. The only problem I had with it was in the baking of my cheesecake, it kinda went all hard and rubbery...I'm not sure what happened, but otherwise I'm sure it'd be find for something you didn't need to bake. Also next time I'll probably increase the crackers and butter just a bit, I couldn't quite get it all the way up the sides of the pan without leaving holes in it.

Tastes great! I softened the butter in the microwave for about 10 seconds and mixed it into the graham cracker crumbs and sugar with a pastry cutter. Very easy. I also put the crackers in a large ziploc bag and crushed with a rolling pin - easy and no mess.

My daughter and I just made this crust (for our chocolate and banana swirl cream pie) and I LOVED it! I find some crusts too crumbly for my taste and this one has a great texture. I can't wait for it to cool completely so we can eat it up!

I really like the flavor of this compared to the ones that are baked. It is more like a sugar cookie crust flavor. I also used less sugar-a scant 1/4 cup..
I made it all in a plastic baggie.  Started with a package of graham crackers and crushed them, added the sugar and shook it around, then added the softened butter and squished it until mixed. Put the mixture in the pie pan and used the inside out bag as a glove and pressed the mixture into place. No mess! 
Chilled it for an hour and filled it with the Chilled Lemonade Dessert.  What a scrumptious Independence "Day dessert!

Used a tablespoon more butter, but it was great! Easy to press into cupcake papers. It was very simple and gave me a 30 minute break before i had to start on the cheesecake.

I have made this with both regular and chocolate graham crackers. it worked equally well both ways.  The only change I made was to use less sugar with the chocolate crust.  It makes the perfect amount for my 9 inch springform pan.

Great recipe!  I found that a more gentle tapping with either spoon or hand works much better than pushing hard, to shape the crust in the pan.

I made this graham cracker crust yesterday to go with a pumpkin chiffon pie. My husband loved it  and keeps on telling me how much he loves it. Your idea to use softened butter is pure genius! Totally easy to put together and press into a pie plate. I did use less sugar as suggested by other reviewers. In fairness to the author, the level of sweetness of the crust depends on how sweet your filling is. One should be less sweet than other so that the flavors are in contrast. Thank you for this recipe!

I used this crust for a cheesecake. The person I was baking with had never used a recipe that you don't bake first and that you use softened rather than melted butter. She has made a lot of cheesecakes and I had never made one before. She was VERY skeptical of the crust recipe, however, I convinced her to try it, and now, it is the only recipe she will use!

I made this for the double layer pumpkin cheesecake. I used shortbread cookies instead of graham crackers & I like that it was a little more savory. Using softened butter definitely helps make if easier to press in the pan.

This crust was great!  I used a Jell-O Sugar Free Fat Free Instant Lemon packet  for the filling.  For the crust, I used softened Smart Balance instead of butter and under 1/3 cup of Splenda instead of a full 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also used a box of graham cracker crumbs instead of making my own. I sprayed my glass pan before putting the crust in it, and I think that helped a lot when removing it.

My adaptations:
-- Reduced sugar to 1/4c and did 75% coconut sugar + 25% white cane sugar
-- depending on filling: add cinnamon

Prep Notes:
-- Since I was in a hurry, I put the dishes into the freezer while preparing the crust. Then put filled dishes back into the freezer. 15 minutes later was good enough for me to fill them with yogurt and serve.
-- 6 tbs butter = 3/4 of 1 cube; simply set out of frig for 15 min to soften while getting other parts of recipe/toppings together.
-- 1.5c of graham crackers = 10-12 whole crakers; the crush job & cleanup is quick inside a gallon ziplock using a rolling pin.

Serving/Filling Notes:
-- Filled 6 small dishes instead of 1 large pie crust.
>> The small dishes fill well with 4oz flavored dessert yogurt each (most indiv yogurt containers are 6oz, BUT Noosa brand sells a slightly larger 8oz tub that's perfect to fill 2 of the dishes for just hubby & I while leaving the other 4 empty for two more evenings of desserts--storing in frig until fill before serving (or earlier in the day if want to try freezing the yogurt).
     ++ Noosa's Key Lime flavored yogurt is outstanding as a fill! Pretty clean 7 main ingredients.

And, yes, definitely making this again. Thanks!

No-bake was key...I used this as the base for a trifle recipe I concocted. I pressed down for the bottom layer and used crumbles for the middle layer. Plenty left to sprinkle on top for appearance. A big hit!

I made this for the fruit and cream pie that has strawberries.  I wanted to use up some ingredients I had on hand and this way the only thing I needed to buy was fresh strawberries. 

Anyway, I found softened better worked very well and unlike melted butter I didn't feel like there wasn't enough to go around....  I would rather suggest to have the butter as softened as possible....  that would make it even easier.  I also used my hand pastry blender and it was easy for me.  I hardly ever agree with prep time on a recipe.  I'm sure it was at least 10 minutes.  I refrigerated the crust for at least 2 hours prior to putting in the filling.

The flavor overall was very good, but likely too much sugar.  I may decrease it next time, but I do recommend the recipe.

This pie crust is easy, simple and delicious, perfect for beginners and advanced chefs as well! I had some leftover graham cracker mixture, which I tasted and already was my favorite pie crust! This is definitely my go-to crust recipe!!

Great.. and easy. following so of the other suggestions, I cut the sugar to 4 Tbls. and used brown sugar since I was making Pumpkin pie with them also baked at 350 for 5 minutes before refrigerating. Will definitively use this again.

I doubled this recipe and I used honey graham crackers so I only put 1/2 cup of sugar. That was sweet enough. I made a large deep 9" pie and I wanted the crust thick enough to hold up to the delicious lemon cream cheese pie. It was perfect! It did take me about an hour to do the crust and I think it was because of using softened butter instead of melted.  It took some finger and fork work to get the thickness even across the bottom. Keep  in mind that I doubled the recipe. This is my go-to recipe for this type of crust from now on.

Needs at least 2 tablespoons more butter for a no bake cheesecake pie crust. I initially wanted to save the 2 additional tablespoons of butter calories so I tried this recipe since it called for 2 tablespoons less than mist8. I couldn't get it to set up without constantly crumbling off the sides of the pan . This recipe calls for less sugar than most (1/3 c vs 1/2 c) but I think that's fine. This recipe could be ok for a baked cheesecake as the mixtures would help adhere to the base. It  al depends on what your end product will be, for some it could be perfect as is.

I used 1 sleeve of graham crackers and softened butter. I did end up putting mixture in microwave for 15 seconds. That made it a lot easier to spread.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I am madly in love with this crust. I made it with a pumpkin cheesecake, and it was amazing. You could make this in a flat-bottom tin and people would tell you it was the best short bread they'd ever had. (Made exactly as directed, except that I was in a rush and couldn't refrigerate it long enough. I stuck it in the freezer for fifteen minutes instead.)

I was looking for a no-bake crust for a Banana Cream Pie. This was great- perfectly proportioned. Both my son & husband were licking the spoon lol. I suggest using a large bowl and mix it with your fingers. It patted into the pan easily, no sliding. I used 40 crushed Nilla Wafers instead. Thanks for a great reciepe.

The Cinnamon added a wonderful touch for a chocolate pudding pie crust. But it was GREAT  for chocolate pudding pie. Best one I had ever used. HOWEVER, do not try it for cheesecake.  at least....pumpkin cheesecake. I don't know if I did something wrong, or what, but it ended up paper thin, and soggy....no bueno!

This was EXTREMELY easy and super delicious. Not too sweet and not too crumbly graham tasking. Sometimes crust overpowers the taste of the pie itself It should compliment it, not be the focus. 

This is perfect.

This is the best graham cracker pie crust and very easy.  I love how you don't have to bake it.  This is a keeper!

this recipe is amazing for pies! But i still prefer melted butter, i even add a little bit more the taste compliments the filling
