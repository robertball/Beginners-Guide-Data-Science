i love honey mustard dressing but wanted a healthier version so i used plain fat free yogurt instead of mayo. Also it was a little sweet for me so i just added more mustard to taste and added a dash of pepper for some kick. It was great, Couldn't tell it wasn't made with mayo even DH liked it and he hates anything low-fat.

This was very a very good (and simple!) dressing to make. The only thing I did differently was to use honey dijon stone ground mustard. I have also previously tried the dressing with the regualar mustard, but my family and I prefer the dijon. Thanks!

I told my husband I had been experimenting with new salad dressing recipes. I made a new honey mustard dressing. He warned me he was not a "honey mustard" kind of guy. I served it on a main dish salad with lettuce greens, chopped bell pepper, carrot, celery, and sauteed turkey breast, all topped with toasted almonds. It was fantastic. After he licked the bowl, I asked him how he liked the honey mustard dressing. He asked, "That was honey mustard?" He loved it. This incredibly easy recipe will be a staple in our house. I used dijon mustard and low fat mayo from Trader Joes.

I have looked all over for a recipe that tastes like the honey mustard in restaurants.  This is it!  I thoroughly enjoy it as a salad dressing and as a dipping sauce for chicken.

A keeper for the Recipe hall of fame!  I served this with baby spinach, red onion, chopped boiled eggs and real bacon bits and it was a shame I didn't double the recipe... great recipe! Thanks!

I am not a fan of Honey Mustard dressing, but I even liked this recipe.  It is perfect for dipping chicken fingers.  I did decrease the mayo a little because I do not care for dressings with a strong mayo taste.

I can't believe 4 simple ingredients created something so wonderful. This is the best honey mustard. I like it better than Denny's and that use to be my favorite. Thank you for sharing the 4 simple ingredients with us.

Made this New Year's Day for Beef/Chicken Fondue dinner...it is WONDERFUL!  Much like Wendy's for Chicken BLT salad.  We quadrupled the dressing, put it on salad and used it as a dip for fondue.  Didn't change a thing...it's a keeper and everyone, even our picky eater, loved it!  It will now become our favorite over homemade Ranch, which has been our standard for the past couple years.

I hate to be the voice of dissent in such an overwhelming chorus of praise, but I really didn't care for this dressing - I found the flavour of the mayonnaise to be VERY overpowering.  I was able to salvage it with a few additions, and my husband, none the wiser about its original form, thought it quite pleasant - hence, the 3 stars.  I'm terribly sorry; I had such high hopes for this recipe.

Love this dressing.  Honey mustard is my favorite salad dressing, and this is better than any from the store.  We're doing the low-carb thing right now, so I subbed splenda for the honey and upped the lemon juice a bit and I can't tell the difference from the original recipe.  Yay, Splenda!

Awesome dressing! The only change I made was to sub 1/2 tsp. white vinegar for the lemon juice (didn't have lemons). This is excellent! and I usually do not care for honey mustard dressing but made it for a spinach salad because my husband does.

It's Stone Crab Claw season in SW Florida and we are really taking advantage of it!  These delights demand a classic honey mustard dipping sauce and I was in the mood to try something different than what I usually make, "Honey Mustard Sauce," also from this site.  This recipe, "Honey Mustard Dressing II,"  calls for yellow mustard rather than the Dijon in the other recipe, and this recipe calls for a little lemon juice, where the other does not.  I loved this!  It's neither too sweet, mustard-y nor mayonnaise-y.  Just perfect.  Hubs, however, wasn't quite as enthusiastic.  He said this wasn't bad, but he prefers the other.  In the final analysis, both are very good.

Simple, easy, and delicious! what more can you ask for! My kids loved it. I had to double the recipes to have enough sauce for everyone (There are 7 people in the family). I was out of lemon juice and I reduced the honey just a tad, it was still fabulous. Thanks for the great recipe!

this is the best honey mustard dressing I have had yet. I have been searching for a recipe just like this one. it is just as good as the dressing I have ordered in steak houses. and the best part is how easy it is to make. my teen-agers only ask for this dressing for their salad now. I can't make enough for them!

DELICIOUS!!!! I used nonfat greek plain yogurt and did have to add more honey because it was too tart. Turned out great though...my husband couldn't tell it wasn't store bought until I told him and then he was SUPER impressed. I will definitely use this as my go-to. I made this to accompany the Alice Springs Chicken recipe from this website.

Loved this. I did use light mayo & dijon mustard, but it was delish! I am excited to try this using plain nonfat yogurt as well. Thanks for a simple, tasty recipe. We'll definitely be using this often.

Nice to find a super quick honey mustard dressing. I don't think I will be spending a bunch of money on the bottle stuff anymore. I did use FF yogurt  instead of Mayo cause I had some on hand that needed to be used up. I also used Djon mustard, added a dash of black pepper and dried parsely just for color. It was great, I think the orginial would be just as good, but sticking with the yogurt just to make it healthier since no one thought it tasted bad. TY Mary!

I don't like this honey mustard as a dipping sauce but it makes an amazing sandwich dressing! Get some toasted wheat bread, turkey, ham, bacon, cheese, lettuce, salt and pepper...drizzle this honey mustard over it...AMAZING! Thanks for sharing!

I used this with some Sunchip crusted chicken bites at a cookout.  I loved it and it went in a flash when I put it out.  I was asked to make more but I didn't have time so next time I will make A LOT:)

Perfect dressing!  Be sure not to eye ingredients, if you are a little off on one thing it tastes funny - but measure exactly and it is wonderful!  Try this on a fried chicken salad with mushrooms, cheese, and avocado - nothing better than that :)

Excellent recipe! If it's a bit too tangy for you, just skip the lemon juice.

I'd give this six stars if I could! It's sooooo easy, and really does taste like the honey mustard in restaurants! I prepared it exactly as described in the recipe, didn't make any changes.

This is a great starting off point but I felt like there was something missing. I added a bit of cajun seasoning, paprika, and onion powder... gave it that "something extra" that was missing!! Used light mayo and tasted delicious...next time I'll use yogurt and see how that goes!

Excellent, easy recipe! Was looking for something good and quick and this was it. I was out of regular mustard so I used dijon instead.  A definite keeper- VERY tasty!

this sauce is awesome! I have used it for salad, and as a spread on sandwiches (very good!).. but I usually make it to go with the 'Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings' recipe n this site .. I make the buffalo sauce and dredge the wings in that, Leave a few un-sauced for the kids, just deep-fried, and on the side I make this sauce for them... the sauce (and wings) are gobbled up instantly... also very good with fries topped with cheese, fresh cooked bacon chunks, and green onion! just drizzle it on or do the dipping thing....

Made this yesterday and was very pleased, even though I added a tad more mayo and honey.  Delicious!!!  Thank you for sharing.  Tastes like the one at Chili's.

Simple and tasty.  Anything the kids love gets 5 stars.  The lemon juice gives a zing.  Will try with yogurt as suggested in another recipe.  Could be spiced up and altered in many ways, good base.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been looking for a good homemade salad dressing recipe forever. When I saw this one had so many rave reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I am so glad I did. It is exactly the recipe I've been looking for. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, but other than that, I made it exactly as directed. It is the perfect balance of sweet creaminess and tangy zip!

I'm sorry, I didn't care for this. I'm not a honey mustard aficionado, but this just didn't taste very good. I thought it was way too mayonaisey and I'm in love with mayo. I have made many better recipes than this for honey mustard.

I don't like sweet and sour (but I wish I did) so I made the recipe exactly as submitted for others. Not your traditional dressing for raw veggies, but the 5 adults and 2 kids thought this was great. The whole recipe would have been gone if there had been 2 or 3 more adults. My family thanks you Mary!

This recipe is great. We lived in Switzerland for over 2 years and I could not buy Honey Mustard salad dressing in the store. This recipe was used at least once a week. Thanks to the person who put this recipe on this site. It was a blessing to our family.

This is so terrific! I have been searching in stores for the perfect "restaraunt-style" Honey Mustard dressing recipe to no avail--but this dressing is exactly what I've been after. :o) I played around with it a bit and found that using fat free mayo is just as yummy! Thanks for sharing!

Tried this dressing last night and it was absolutely fabulous.  Because we are all watching our weight at our house, I used low-cal, low-fat mayo and the recipe held up like a champ.  I'll be serving it again this weekend at a dinner party for 8.  Thanks for this one!

This was a simple & great honey mustard dressing. My modifications:  DIJON mustard makes all the difference, also for a thinner dressing, I substituted half of the mayo for a few tablespoons of olive oil!

I make a honey mustard chicken salad using store-bought, low-fat honey mustard dressing. I couldn't find any, so I decided to make my own. I used this recipe, but substituted plain yogurt for the mayonnaise. It was fantastic! The best part is the yogurt I bought was nonfat (I didn't realize that when I bought it) and it still tasted better than any bottled dressing I've ever used. I think I'll start making my own dressing for all my salads from now on.

Perfect dip for my crispy fried chicken "balls" - tenders cut into 3 or 4 pieces coated in egg wash and seasoned flour. I used dijon mustard. Really tasty.

When I tasted this dressing after making it, it tasted too tangy. I had made a double batch and only used 1 and a half tablespoons of dijon mustard. We served it with a coleslaw type salad (capsicum, carrot, spinach, shallots, red cabbage and wombok cabbage shredded finely). Well, it was an amazing dressing for the salad. Perfectly easy to prepare and the taste was perfect when eaten with the salad. I used home made mayo (Whole Egg Mayonnaise recipe from All Recipes) as we are trying to be careful about chemicals and preservatives in processed foods these days.

I made this as a dip for homemade pretzels. So easy, and so delicious...just like the honey mustard you get at a restaurant. The only change I made was to add a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper at the end.

Probably the best honey mustard I have ever tasted!!! I used low fat mayo and spicy brown mustard...the measurements for all four ingredients were spot on. Perfect...couldnt be any better...just delicious...Served on top of salad last night with sliced leftover grilled London Broil. Excellent and Thanks!

Ok, this seriously took me a minute to prepare, and was SOOOO good on our tossed salads!  Even my kids, who normally only do ranch, loved it!

This Honey Mustard Dressing ony requires 4 ingredients and is absolutely delicious.  I made a spinach salad, added some chicken breast and this dressing, and can honestly say I went back for seconds.

Good simple recipe, I did use honey dijon mustard and instead of lemon juice I used apple cider vinegar which seemed to work pretty well.

FINALLY!  My kids are honey mustard experts and very particular about the kind they like.  When I put this on the table for dinner they flipped out!  This is IT!  Where did you get this!  Said "I made it that's where!"  :)  The family loves this so much I have to make in large batches.  I increased the servings till it filled a ketchup bottle we finished up.  We used spicy brown mustard and it is hands down the favored variety.

Perfect! Didn't change a thing; except doubled suggested serving, added a pinch of salt and let dressing sit overnight in the fridge as I planned to make this a dressing for my Apple Carrot Salad.   The dressing really turned our normally-bland-taste veggie salad consists of 3 shredded carrots, a shredded apple, a sliced red tomato, a sliced onion, a diced hard boiled egg and some raisins into heaven! I also added some freshly-cracked black pepper to give an extra kick…   My husband (a salad critic) loved it so much and we are enjoying this as vitamin-packed super-healthy breakfast and lunch today!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARY ANN...FOR BRINGING SO MUCH JOY TO US :))

Perfect dipping sauce!  Used Dijon mustard.  After tasting sauce, I added 3/4 t. olive oil, 1/2 t. white wine vinegar, 1 T water, and salt & pepper to make dressing.  Delicious!!!

I used this as a marinade for grilled chicken, and reserved some to use as a dipping sauce. It was pretty good as a dipping sauce, but I think it would have been best over a spinach salad. I used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard.

So easy, fast, and good.  I like it equally with plain yogurt or mayonnaise.  

And I didn't really like honey mustard dressing that much before I found this recipe.  I love it now.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  I prepared this as written and found it was a little thick for a salad dressing (which is what I wanted it for), perfect for dipping.  So to thin I added about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, and a drizzle of water.  I also added a pinch of garlic powder, and S & P to taste.  So easy and good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very Good.  I don't know why people would
buy dressings from the store when they can
whip up something like this that is so much
better than anything you can buy. Thank you
for a simple and wonderful recipe.

Made this with fat free Greek plain yogurt, dijon mustrd, honey and lemon juice.  This was a bit on the tangy/bitter side.  I can't wait to try it with light "real" mayo.  This is going to be an everyday dressing/sandwich spread/chicken nugget dipping sauce in our home.

Wow! It IS amazing how four basic pantry staples can taste SOOOO good together!!! Both my hubs and I LOVED this yummy dressing. I must admit, I like the honey mustard sauce from the Aussie chicken recipe on this site a teeny bit better, but even so, I prefer Mary Ann's recipe because it calls for little sugar (the other uses high fructose corn syrup to sweeten) and tastes *almost* the same. The biggest advantage this has is that I feel less guilt when eating it lol! My only suggestion is to add fresh cracked black pepper to taste. I felt this was missing a "little something," and adding pepper was my answer. :) I can't WAIT to try this as a dipping sauce for chicken tenders! Thanks for sharing your easy, AWESOME recipe, Mary Ann! :-)

Mixed up the dressing (used light Miracle Whip), and added more honey and lemon juice to suit our taste.  Very nice.  This now will be my go-to recipe for honey mustard dressing.  No more bottled stuff, this is just fresh and EASY.

Very good. The taste of the mayo was strong, next time I will add more mustard. Makes a nice thick dressing. I used Grey Poupon Dijon mustard since I like the hearty mustard. This is a great easy quick recipe.

I also used low fat mayo, used fresh squeezed lime juice instead of lemon and probably at least doubled the amount, also sprinkled some thyme and a splash of white wine for good measure!

So yummy.  I did also try it using plain yogurt, to lighten it up a bit, and it tastes almost the same.  If you are using this for a salad or something where there are a lot of other flavors, use the yogurt.  If you are using this for dipping chicken fingers or something else where it plays a major role in the taste, use the mayo.

I made this sauce to try to duplicate the chicken sandwich from Chili's or Outback...with chicken, swiss cheese, bacon, and honey mustard dressing. 

It was excellent..we doubled the recipe so we would have leftover for dipping.

We LOVED this!  I was looking for a recipe to duplicate the Honey Mustard you can get at Quizno's, and this is it!  In fact, I think it's even better.  I made this with Herbed Chicken Nuggets from this site and oven fries.  I doubled the recipe, used light mayo and spicy brown mustard.  It is already almost gone, so I suggest at least doubling this!

Dijon, schmijon, use Creole brown mustard or plain ol' cheap yellow. I loathed yellow mustard all my life til I learned how great it can be in dressings like this.

This was very easy-- I already had all of the ingredients; I used fresh lime juice because I didn't have lemon. Next time I'll use less mayo. (to me it was too mayonnaise-y.) This dressing tasted great on salad with some grapes and mushrooms!

This is a great recipe.  If only people knew how simple it was to make your own dressings, no one would ever buy bottled again.  Also, I want to say this is a great site for recipes, I have looked at it many times before, but just registered today.  Thanks.

Thanks for the recipe. The proportions are helpful. However, for a more sophisticated taste, this recipe should be submitted again substituting dijon mustard for prepared mustard! The blend of honey and dijon has a more complex flavor than the yellow stuff. Even if you don't normally use dijon it is great in the dressing.

Great recipe! Very easy... i made mine super low calorie by using fat free mayo and by adding extra mustard, 2 T. fat free miracle whip, and a little bit of pepper. that reduced it to about 30 cals per 2 Tbls. and it still tastes great! thanks!!!

Really good and easy.  A classic taste that would also go well with chicken strips.  May be a little strong for kids taste.

Excellent! Better than the bottled. My hubby wanted Honey Mustard dressing for his salad. I checked my fridge and panty and found I was out so I did a search and found this. Had all of the ingredients. Oh My! I will not be buying the bottled anymore.

YUM! I used dijon just because I love the spice and low fat mayo. I may try plain yogurt next time just to cut down on the fat even more. I am kind of picky about the honey mustard I like and this one is going to be my new favorite! Thanks for sharing!

Great, easy dressing made with ingredients you usually have on hand. I am looking forward to also trying it with plain greek yogurt instead of mayo.

Easy and tasty but found this definitely more dip-like than salad dressing due to it's  consistency w/ the mayo base. Served it with popcorn chicken.  Thx for sharing.

This is the best dressing ever. I changed it a bit by adding 1-2 cloves of fresh garlic, dijon mustard (instead of the regular prepared mustard) and salt and pepper to the mix. I find that little change adds a little more depth and some zing to the dressing.

Thanks for this recipe! I used it to make dressing for the first time! I only used half of the lemon juice, though, as the first sample was too tart for my tastes. Wife loved it!

The only thing I changed was to use dijon instead prepared mustard. For the salad, I used a prepared blend of baby lettuces, topped with garlic baked chicken (the crushed garlic browned to the point of being crispy). I will definitely make this again.

I've never commented before, and I've been on this site a LONG time. I used fat free Greek yogurt, and you can't even tell it's low fat. THIS IS THE PERFECT honey mustard recipe! I'd give more stars if I could. :)

Needed to add more mustard and honey and a touch of apple cider vinegar to get it to taste right for me, but in the end it turned out great! I've learned that to taste salad dressings, it's better to dip in a piece of lettuce and taste it on that so you know how it will actually work in the salad. Definitely play with this recipe - it will liven up even the simplest salad.

My husband used to love a bottled Maple Djon dressing that is no longer available. I modified this recipe by using yogurt in place of the mayo and maple syrup for the honey. Served it with side salads for his birthday dinner and he thought I had found that bottled dressing somewhere!

Very tasty!  I followed the instructions, added paprika for a kick (careful, a little goes a long way!), and then because it was such a small amount, I followed someone else's advice and added a tablespoon of (Greek) yogurt as fluffer.  It doesn't add much to flavor, but it's great to simply increase the amount of the dip.  After that, adjust flavor for taste!  Simply delicious and I can't wait to try it with some lime juice next time too.

Really great base recipe with room to customize/tweak to individual tastes.  After making it as directed, (with the exception of using lime juice in place of lemon, since that was what I had on hand and I also used low-fat mayo) I realized, for MY taste, I needed to increase both the mustard and honey (approximately doubling each.  Perhaps a bit less on the mustard).  My girlfriend and I are pretty picky when it comes to 'honey mustard' and THIS was pretty darn good!...even using lime juice.  The next time I make it, I would like to make it using 'Dijon' as others have...just for the sake of experimenting, NOT because it wasn't wonderful the first time.  GREAT recipe!

To cut down on fat I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of the mayo.  Since the yogurt has its own tang I didn't add lemon juice.  Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.

Excellent!  I made this with Dijon and it was perfect.  This made my hubby very happy!  So from one Marianne to another Mary Ann, thanks!  UPDATE:  We like this even better when it's made with half Dijon and half yellow mustard.  It really is very tasty!

Yummy!! Very good dressing. Substituted yogurt (vanilla actually because that is all I had) for the mayo. It was so good! I will use vanilla yogurt the next time I make it too!

This is perfect as is.  I needed a mustard sauce for dipping chicken and this was perfect.  The only that I did different was used Miracle Whip instead of mayo because I use Miracle Whip in place of mayo all the time.

I have tried this recipe and it is incredible. I made it in bulk for a teachers luncheon once and I know 12 people asked me for the recipe. I did add some baclk pepper to mine. I am sure white pepper would be great. This is a real keeper and I always come back to this recipe.

Delicious, **beyond** easy, and with ingredients on hand... almost too good to be true!  I used dijon & regular mustard, but felt absolutely zero need to "tinker" w/the recipe - that's HIGH praise.  (This would also make a great slaw dressing with a bit of vinegar added.)

Pretty lowbrow. Nothing zesty or unusual about this one. Tastes like commerical dressings that come out of a bucket at chain restaurants. If you like that sort of thing, this is perfect. Should please kids or simple palates.

Wonderful recipe.  I added some dill to mine.  honey mustard with dill is my husbands favorite dip.  Also added some hot mustard to it so it had some kick.  Give it a try it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.

My husband never eats anything but Italian Dressing!! This dressing is so easy I had to give it a try. I've tried other honey mustard recipes and they don't hold a candle to this one. I love it and hubby is a huge fan. We're eating it right now atop a fresh greens salad. Thanks for a great EASY dressing. Can't wait to try it as a dip for chicken!

I have made this recipe using fat free and light mayonnaise.  Really it's the mustard and honey that give it flavor anyhow.  I have had marvelous results every time.  I use it as a salad dressing, dip, preparing potato salad, and in sandwiches.  I make about one cup at a time and I usually finish it up by the 4th day!  It is a nice and thick dressing that can easily be thinned out with extra lemon juice, honey, and mustard.

This awesome dressing was made as a spur of the moment compliment to a salad I made with a treasure I found while shopping this afternoon, a "no name" pecan crusted chicken breast. I had a great compliment of salad fixings to go along with the chicken, but no appropriate bottled dressing.
Wow,such simplicity of ingredients, and easy prep, this dressing was so perfectly complimentary to the chicken I am delighted to highly recommend this delicious, and extremely easy honey mustard dressing.

I've never made Honey Mustard Dressing before, so when I saw that the recipe called for more mayo than mustard, I was leary.  However, this dressing is absolutely wonderful!  I'll never buy Honey Mustard Dressing again!

This was exactly what I have been looking for! I have tried sooo many bottle varieties trying to get a match for honey mustard dressings I have had in a restaurant, but they were all gross! This is THE honey mustard dressing recipe! I tasted it and found it tasted a bit too mayo so I added a tad more honey and mustard.  Love it.

I couldn't find Dijon mustard, so had to settle for Prepared mustard, which I think made the dressing look too yellow and had a very strong mustard taste. Should try to halve the mustard next time I use prepared mustard till I can find Dijon at the supermarket.

Wow! Our family really enjoyed this recipe. I have made this a couple of times trying it out in a couple of different recipe uses. It was wonderful as a salad dressing. I have also used it to cook chicken in for the Aussie Chicken Recipe on here. It was exceptional. I actually preferred it instead of the recipe's honey mustard sauce. Preparation is quite simple and anyone can make it there own if they prefer more or less in tastes. Will definitely be making this again, and again, and AGAIN!

WOW! This was excellent! Restaurant quality for sure! I'll NEVER buy this as a bottled dressing again! So simple and easy! I scaled it to 24 tablespoons (appx 1.75 cups) and stored the leftover in a tightly closed jar for dinner the next night.  This made plenty of dressing for 6 medium-sized bowls of salad. I also topped the salad with freshly made crumbled bacon (Mmmm) and sprinkled some "Salad Supreme" on the top, which gave it the perfect touch! This dressing received raves all around the table!

I loved this dressing- I made a salad with lettuce, almonds, mandarine oranges, red onion,  shredded cheese, and sliced breaded chicken and tossed it with this dressing and it was a hit!

This is so good and so easy.  Our younger daughter's college roommate asked me to make Honey Mustard to keep in her dorm fridge for late night snacks.  I used 1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard and 1/2 Tbsp yellow prepared mustard.  This is a definite keeper!

I loved this dressing.  Be careful how much you put on your salad!  I would definitely use this as a dip for chicken.  Every time I go to Applebee's, I get chicken fingers just for the honey mustard sauce and this recipe is very similar!  Wonderful recipe!

For me, this is the classic steak house honey mustard dressing.  I make this recipe exactly as written and then add a dash of cayenne pepper for a tiny kick (which everyone can handle).    I always serve this with a spinach salad that consists of baby spinach, thin slices of red onion, chopped hearts of palm, tomato, small handful of alfalfa sprouts (they look pretty sitting on top), roasted sunflower seeds, a sprinkle of shredded cheese (usually mozz), and a few croutons for crunch.

I just mixed some of this dressing up and it's SO good!  I'm excited for dinner thanks to this dressing now.  I added a little more honey because as it was it didn't have quite enough sweetness for me.  I just added a few more squirts until I got the right hint of sweetness.  I really like that this doesn't make a huge batch since I'm the only one in my house who eats honey mustard anything.  This definitely tastes like honey mustard dressing you would be served in a restaurant.

This is the best honey mustard dressing! Really quick and easy and just as good (if not better) than anything at the store.  I always use dijon mustard and sometimes I use lowfat mayo to make it lighter.

Pretty good but not the best I have made.  I added more honey--I did not think the balance was quite right as written.  Very easy and love that there are just four ingredients.

Awesome dressing.  Only had about 1/8 cup of mayo left, so subbed non-fat plain Greek yogurt instead.  Very tasty!  Used 1/2 regular yellow mustard and 1/2 Dijon.  Thanks for a quick delicious dressing!

Very good. I used my own homeade mayo, and used djion mustard.  It was a bit too much mustard flavor so I added about 1/2 T extra honey to it. Yummy!

It IS unbelievable what so few ingredients can make!  Very, very tasty.  My finicky six-year-old LOVED it as did the rest of the family.  Will double recipe next time.

Holy cow! This stuff is phenomenal!! I copied another review in substituting nonfat yogurt (homemade) for the mayo, and I didn't have lemon or lime juice, but white vinegar worked perfectly. Thanks for a wonderful keeper!!

I'm not a big fan of honey mustard but I made this for a salad with romaine and left over garlic pork loin and it was excellent!  Definitely a do-over!

This is a great recipe. I added twice the honey some garlic powder, cayenne pepper and a little jalapeño juice and it was superb! Next time I'm gonna mince few minced pickled jalapeño slices just to give it a little more spice. Turned out to be a GREAT dipping sauce for my party!

Great Recipe! I did adjust the mayo to a mix, 1/2 and 1/2 of both reduced fat mayo and buttermilk - I wanted my dressing to pour from a bottle! This is so good! I increased this by 4 times so I didn't have to make more again tomorrow- it goes fast around here! A tip for bottling the sauce, I used my frosting bag with a wide mouthed tip, scooped the dressing into the frosting bag and topped up the bottle-No spills :)

Made this tonight to go with some fried chicken strips and it is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It's definitely (homemade) restaurant quality.  From now on, I will use this as my standard HM recipe.  It's great!   Thanks!

I was surprised at how well this turned out. I ended up adding about a teaspoon more of mustard and honey because to me the mayo taste was a little stong. but, it was very yummy just the way that it was! very easy and had everything on hand (i used bottled lemon juice and it still came out great)

Good stuff! The mayonnaise base is the key. Most store bought dressings have too much of a mustard base.  You have to start with mayo.  This one's a keeper!

Super fast and easy and tastes SO good.  The only change I might make is to use a little less lemon juice to make the dressing a little thicker. But it's such a great, simple recipe. We made chicken with mushrooms, carmelized onions, and canadian bacon, with swiss cheese melted over the top and used this for dipping.  It was awesome.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Okay, I had to leave my laptop and try this recipe NOW!.  Plus, I was ono (craving) salad.  But I didn't have fresh lemons so I used the stuff in the plastic "lemon", French's yellow mustard, B.F. mayo and honey.  It was pretty good. I'm gonna try with fresh lemon next time, i'm sure it'll make a difference somewhat, but I can taste the potential for changing it up with different herbs and/or using the Dijon.  Thank U Mary Ann!!!

I loved it, and, more importantly, so did my kids! It reminded me of the great honey mustard dressing I'd get at Applebees to eat on their fries. I had to make a second batch before the end of dinnertime. I'll be doubling this from now on. I made it with the lime juice, as suggested. Yum!!

LOVED THIS!! Mixed up perfectly in my Vitamix mixer! I used lo-fat mayo instead of regular mayo and added a bit of Agave natural sweetner (liquid) as well as the honey......I wont buy bottled honey mustard again!!

I'm on Weight Watchers and wanted a good honey mustard dressing.  This recipe tastes great when made with lite mayo.  I wasn't sure what kind of mustard to use, so I used yellow and it came out wonderful - thanks!

I can't rave enough about this dressing.  It is fabulous and sooo easy! I didn't even like honey-mustard dressing but now I can't get enough of it.  We use it on salads (of course) and as a spread for sandwiches.  Just wonderful!

This was very good.  I did kinda change it up a bit.  I used coarse ground mustard and lime juice. But it still was excellent.

I was out of mayo, but I did have Miracle Whip, so I used that. It gave it a 'tang' - so if you like that, I'd suggest using Miracle Whip.

I didn't use the amounts, just checked which ingredients were used and made it to taste. I used regular yellow mustard but it  needed something so I added brown mustard and it was perfect! Thank you!

WOW!  This is really good!  I made it last night and served with chicken tenders.  Kiddo loved it and he hates mayo.  :oP  I doubled the recipe and used Miracle Whip for the mayo, plus a tad more honey than what is called for.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks so much!

First round was too mayo-ey for me, so I double the honey, mustard & lemon juice.  It was much better then.  I didn't care for it too much on the salad I made though (romaine, spinach, peppers, olives, tomatoes, mozzarella, carrots, celery), I will need to try it again on other salad varieties to see if the taste will improve.

Excellent! I used Dijon for the mustard, but wound up adding a squirt of regular bright yellow mustard to add a little more color. You really do need to use a whisk or fork to beat, though. I tried shaking it in a jar, and the honey just didn't incorporate. But a few turns with a fork, and !Voila!

I make this with the same ingredients other than the lemon juice. I worked at Elvis Presley's Memphis restaurant and we made it with honey, mustard, hellman's, and a dash of cayenne. It wasn't hot at all (and I don't like hot dishes), but the cayenne is nice.

Great recipe.  Really flavorful without all the additives and sodium of store bought dressing.  Good with low fat mayo too!  I'm sorry but I have to say, who uses a blender at any speed without the top on?  That's why there's a small removable piece in the center of the cover.

This is so good and so easy!  I wondered if it needed to sit first to let the flavors blend but it is good right away as the recipe states!  We dipped onion rings in it and it was fab, would also be good with chicken.  I have used Miracle Whip in a pinch and that also works but real mayo is the best.  Very low risk to try also as there are only 4 ingredients and low amounts of each!  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!  I won't be buying store bought again, that's for sure.

This was very good.  Although it does taste good on salad, it really is more of a chicken dipping sauce, not a dressing.  However, I would reccommend it.

I used the recipe for a dipping sauce for my homemade Auntie Anne's Preztel kit and boy oh boy what a disaster I unfolded!  Be forwarned, DO NOT use the blender on the highest setting without a lid. I don't know why that wasn't mentioned in the recipe. I've had to hire a professional cleaning crew to scrape the delicious sauce off of my ceiling and walls. (one star deducted for cleaning crew) All in all it was delicious but I think in the future I'll stick to a recipe less dangerous.

I always have these ingredients on hand, so making this recipe is inexpensive and fast. This dressing even makes prefrozen, microwaved chicken nuggets taste good!

How simple? I made this in under 5 minutes which is just as well as dinner was on the table when I realised I was out of salad dressing. Reduced the honey to about half a tablespoonful and used Dijon mustard. We all absolutely loved this. No more store bought dressing for us. Thanks.

I made this with grainy Dijon mustard. It turned out excellent.  We Used it gor a grilled chicken salad with mixed greens.  It was awesome!

Love it!  I added a few extra drops of honey and mustard, along with some parsley flakes and it tastes JUST like the honey mustard dressing at Cheesecake Factory that I love so much.  Thank you SO MUCH for this simple recipe!

I tried really hard to follow the recipe... but I just love dijon (so that's what I used).  What a huge hit at my baby's first birthday party - all of the adults loved it.  My MIL asked me to make the dressing for Christmas.

This dressing was great!  I did as others had suggested and reduced the mayo to about 2 Tbsp.  I also added a pinch of dijon mustard.  I served over lettuce only - we don't normally eat salad because we generally don't enjoy it but this dressing makes me want to have salad every night!

This recipe was great! I am living in Europe for a while and frankly, they don't have dressing worth putting on my salad here.  I was in search of something like back home... this was it! It was easy to make (and find the ingredients for), cheap, and good (especially for a picky girlfriend).  I even used it on a recipe from this site that required honey mustard sauce... worked great! I did add just a little bit more honey than required, but I do have a bit of a sweet-tooth.

Ok but nothing sensational, good if you don't feel like going to the store to buy a bottle.  I prefer Ken's over this.

This recipe was so easy and so good.  I used fat free mayo instead of regular mayo for a no-fat, low cal dressing and veggie dip.  Its now my favorite!

I have to admit I was very skeptical, but this was EXCELLENT!  I haven't been able to find a honey mustard dressing that I liked nearly as well as what you can get in a restaurant, and this was just as good and even better -- plus I used light mayo!  And you can't beat four ingredients!

Excellent!  I forgot to buy lemon at the store so had to use lime instead, it was still fantastic!  I made a "salad" fo chow mein noodles, cole slaw style cabbage, chicken, bacon, and green onion.  It was great with this dressing!!

This dressing is awesome. Perfect as is or add a little pepper. We live in Japan where a good dressing is hard to find. I served it as a dip with some chicken fingers and my husband loved it, just like we remember from our favorite restaurant back home.

This was an excellent starter recipe. I had to tweak it a bit, as it tasted a little "mayonnaisey" to me. In addition to the required ingredients, I added one teaspoon of dijon mustard, a few extra drops of lemon juice, and an extra tablespoon of honey. Perfection! Play with this recipe a bit, until it suits your own tastes.

Not bad.  Very easy to make.  I used a hearty stone ground mustard.  It is a very sublime flavor.  But not one of those "oh my god" kind of things.

YES Mary Ann! Much better, super easy, and WAY cheaper. Just spent $3.99 on a bottled version and it tasted gross. Jumped on the computer, pulled up my fav site (Allrecipes), and whipped up this dressing using plain yellow mustard. Very tasty! Next time I'll try it with the dijon type mustard. Thanx so much!

I have bought almost every honey mustard dressing on the market and they always seem to taste like they were made with miracle whip.  This was so easy and delicious, much better then anything you can buy and what's great is all the ingredients are already in the fridge.  It reminds me of the Outback Steakhouse honey mustard dressing.  This is also a big hit with kids!

I accidently bought fat free dressing and I didn't feel like running back to the store, so I searched and ran into this one.  Lets say, I'm not a big fan of honey mustard dressing, but after reading all the wonderful reviews, decided to give this one a try.  Followed the recipe with the exception of lime, and it was excellent!  It wasn't heavy at all (like I had suspected).  Very nice, subtle flavor.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks a lot!  This is definitely a keeper.

The best honey mustard dressing that I have had.  I rated it right up there with Outback's dressing.  Now if I could make their salad at home, I would be good to go.

This was very good. It seemed a little thin and had too much mustard taste at first, so I added a bit more mayonaise. I will definitely make this again. How wonderful to have a way to make my own honey mustard exactly to our family's tastes. :-)

What a simple but delicious dressing recipe. I've been looking for a dairy-free and egg-free dressing so this was perfect when I made it with Just Mayo instead of regular mayo. It was great on spinach, arugula, and mushroom and as a dip for the Trader Joe's Masala veggie burger. So glad to have a creamy dressing option w/o milk or eggs. I'll definitely make this again with Just Mayo. Try it!

I loved this stuff!  Next time, I will probably cut back on the lemon juice just a little and add slightly more honey to fit more for my sweet tooth.

Easy & breezy - done in 5 minutes or less.  I made this last night to marinate my homemade chicken fingers in replacement for egg wash and flour before I breaded them in panko.  I also made a separate dish of this for dipping.  This was awesome.  My picky 19 month old son shook his head (from the zing) and then began devouring it.  I will definitely be making a bigger batch to keep on hand.  Thank you Mary Ann for submitting this recipe.

Great dressing. I am using it for ham biscuits. I gave it a little more flavor by adding some black and cayenne pepper, and light brown sugar.

This is honestly the best honey mustard dressing I've ever tasted. I used to go to a  favorite restaurant just for their chicken fingers &  their honey mustard dipping sauce.  This is better & only 4 ingredients!

Oh my goodness!!! This is amazing! I am on the fence when it comes to honey mustard. I'm a mustard fan, yet not so much a honey "lover". I usually steer clear, but tonight I made this for my family to go along with chicken strips. I ended up trying some and I have to say, this was FANTASTIC! I started dipping everything from my plate it. Broccoli, pasta, my fingers..you name it. Awesome recipe. Its a must try. Promise you won't be disappointed. Oh, btw..followed exactly EXCEPT no lemon juice (whomp whomp). I just sub'd white vinegar. Still fabulous.

This recipe was really good! Made chicken/bacon/swiss/lettuce wraps and this made a fabulous topping. Great flavor. I might try it with yogurt next time like another user suggested to see if I can cut down on calories, but I wouldnt change a thing. A Keeper!

Love!!! Very basic, but pleasant. Just like the honey mustard you'll find at most all-American restaurants. So if you prefer the Dijon-style honey mustard, this is not the one for you.

Wonderful! Perfect taste. I love that I was able to use what was already on-hand in the fridge to make this dressing. Like some of the other reviewers, I used stone ground dijon mustard, which gave this dressing a nice zip.

Per other users suggestions, I use 1/2 yellow mustard and 1/2 Dijon mustard for the "prepared mustard," otherwise, I prepare as indicated. This is very easy to make and very versatile.  I've used it on salads (goes great with hard boiled eggs and ham), sandwiches and as a sauce for chicken tenders.

I love me some honey mustard dressing.  I realized I was out, and had made myself a salad with some panko-baked chicken, so I took this recipe and made it. I do like my sauces a bit more sweet, so I added more honey after tasting the initial (which was a bit more mustardy than sweet--which I know my mom and roommates would like, but they weren't here!), but dear god, this was DELICIOUS. Perfect for what I was looking for. I'll definitely make it again!

Made it to the letter and tasted.  It was a decent near four star dressing.  Eldest and I added some pepper, parsley and cayenne for a nice bite.  That kicked it up and made a great dip for the veggie platter I made for dinner tonight.  I'd definitely make it again, with our additions.

Delicious!  I added a pinch of ground black pepper, and used both prepared mustard and 'old style prepared' mustard (50/50).

I used brown mustard instead of reg mustard. Only had a lime so used that. Everyone loved it as a veggie dip. And was very good on salads.

This Honey Mustard Dip/Dressing is a tried and true recipe I've made for my family many times over. Even my finicky eaters devour it so I make a double batch now! Tastes as good if not better than any HM dressing in restaurants AND it's fresh! We use local grown honey!

Excellent. I sub'd for a healthier dressing and was blown away by the result! I used coarse grain dijon mustard & nonfat plain greek yogurt. I've served the dressing on the side with herb crusted chicken & fish on separate occasions. So good!

This is fabulous!  As recommended by other reviewers, I used Dijon, rather than plain mustard.  Sooooo good.  FYI....used fresh honey from a local Virginia hive, rather than grocery store bought honey.  Most excellent!

I have been using this recipe for years. It is so good! I always add a just a little bit of fresh ground pepper to it and a little pinch of salt. This is a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I liked but didn't love this. I was the only one who would even try it and wasn't that impressed. I love honey mustard sauce, but didn't really like this. I probably won't make it again.

This is REALLY good !!!  I quadruple the recipe every time I make it and keep it in a mason jar in the fridge.   If I needed to stress anything, it would be not to use your ordinary, cheap yellow mustard.  Amp it up a bit and use an artisan mustard...it makes a HUGE difference.   Fabulous on a salad, but really good as a dip with fried chicken strips, etc.  I used a smidge more lemon juice to 'brighten' up the flavor a bit, too.  This recipe is a keeper !

The basis of this recipe is great but for me but it was a little too sweet so I subracted 1 star for that and 1 star because I had to adjust. I like a spicer honey mustard so I added spicy brown mustard, pepper and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar. I scaled this down to fit 1 serving. It was pretty good with the "Breaded Chicken Fingers" from this website but I found myself dipping them more in ketchup or bbq.

Good and super quick.  My only change was to use light mayo.  Next time, I'm going to try this with dijon mustard (or maybe half dijon, half yellow), as I wasn't entirely sold on the yellow mustard.

This is a great recipe.  Quick and easy to put together.  My mom is a huge honey-mustard fan and she liked it better than anything we've tried from the stores.  I did double the mustard (I used dijon) but only because I really like mustard;)

This is my favorite type of Allrecipes winner - something that's easy to make, tastes great (kids love it), uses ingredients you already have in the kitchen, and replaces a more expensive packaged product.  I mixed a double batch up in a pyrex measuring cup and poured it into a clean empty honey squeeze bottle that I had saved for convenient dispensing.  I'll never have to *buy* Honey Mustard dressing again - thanks Mary Ann!

Excellent and easy.  Tried it with no-fat mayo.  Then tried it with regular.  Of course, the regular was superior.  Better consistency and better taste in my opinion.  Like most dressings this is so easy to whip up- I am determined not to buy any type of bottled dressing in the future.

OK, I must be missing the boat here... this tasted like creamy mayo to me - so then I added more lemon & mustard... and then added more of a different kind of mustard and I still felt like I was eating a creamy-lemon-mayo dressing. Maybe I should have never made this with knowing that it takes 1/4 mayo but with so many great reviews I had to try it.... I will not make this again.

Wow, so simple and delicious!  If you don't like mayo you can also use sour cream or yogurt.  If you don't have lemon juice you can use vinegar instead.  My husband and I like it spicy so I added pepper on crushed red peppers.  If I had wasabi on hand I probably would have used that.  I didn't even follow the measurements, I just added the ingredients to taste.

Cha Ching!!!! This is it - so simple and so fantastic.  I've made several honey mustard dressings and this is the winner.  A bonus for it's simplicity.  I doubled the recipe - it does not make much.  Mary Ann...woman you nailed this one - thanks!

A little thick and added water to thin it out. Otherwise, great.

Tried quite a few recipes from Allrecipes, but my kids (the judges) gave this one the thumbs up. Thanks for a great recipe; the judges say its the closest to their all time favourite, (TGIF).

This was a bit too sweet for our taste. I would cut back the honey next time and use a spicy mustard instead of regular mustard. But, overall, good.

Excellent.  My kids loved it, and my husband too.  (He is not a fan of honey mustard dressing in general)  But he had seconds of this one! Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I had to try it...everyone was telling the truth. This is just perfect...simple to make with what you already have in the house.  As everyone said, why would you buy it?  Used it to dip sliced grilled chicken breast strips in for quick lunch. Also sliced grilled chicken breast horizontally for sandwich with this sauce. YUM on both counts.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful! So easy and only four ingredients that just about anyone is going to have on hand.  I used spicy brown mustard and light mayo, and it came out really really  well.  I can't say I was surprised, since the average on this recipe is 5 stars. Well done, I suggest everyone use this for a picky eater or someone who doesn't like a lot of salad dressings.

This tastes just like the restaurant honey mustard dressing.  It's quick and easy to throw together.  I made this for dipping chicken.  My finicky son LOVED it and actually ate all his chicken which NEVER happens!

Quick and easy and good!  I used light mayo and it was still good - could vary the types of mustards to change it up.  I added some fresh ground black pepper also.  Much better than store bought salad dressing.

Wow, that's delicous.  I used Dijon mustard for most of the mustard, but added a little stone ground for a bit of texture and kick.

I like this wonderfully mild and sweet dressing with any salad combination - but my favorite is a salad of mixed greens, mandarin oranges, and garlic croutons.

My daughter and I love honey mustard on just about everything, we always ask for extra at fast food to keep in fridge, as  we dont like ANY of the ones in the grocery store.  We can now have it anytime we want! Only personal adjustment: I add a little squeeze more honey and use dijon mustard. We us it as a dip or spread,  and for salad I add a few drops of red wine vinegar to the mix (Awesome!)

We've been looking for a honey mustard dressing similar to what you get in restaurants, and it never occurred to me to look here for a recipe until my husband suggested it last night! I've just made this, it tastes awesome, but am still waiting for him to get off work for his seal of approval, and I think I'll get it!! This is good!

Love this dressing - very easy and sooo good. Great on salads and with chicken fingers.  Used light mayo with great results!

Better than most restaurants!  The only change I made was the mustard.  I used Dijon instead.  Great with Panko Chicken Tenders!

I used this recipe for a green bean/corn/pea salad dressing - and yum!  The only thing I changed was to add rice wine vinegar, to make a honey mustard "viniagrette".  It is excellent, and I received a lot of raves on it. :-)  Thank you!

This recipe is great! I substituted a good quality ranch dressing for the mayo, as I don't care for mayo. I served it with a fried chicken salad, tasted just like what you'd get at a restaurant! We  loved it!

An easy to prepare, and tasty salad dressing. I did use Dijon mustard in the recipe as another reviewer suggested, and added a few grains of black pepper. I put the dressing on top of baby romaine greens and toasted pine nuts which was a great combination. Thanks for the recipe, Mary Ann.

This is wonderful!  The only change I made was to use Dijon instead of regular mustard.  I have gotten to where I hate bottled dressings; they all taste like the chemicals they are made with!  This one is simple and refreshing.  I especially like the consistancy; it isn't runny but not so thick that you can't pour it.  Best part:  DH loved it; I made only 4 servings and he asked if I could make more next time!  I know olive oil and vinegar types are the most healthful for you, but they are his least favorite kind. (sigh).  I served this dressing on Chicken, Apple, and Smoked Gouda Salad.  Perfect!!!  Definetely a keeper!

I'll just add my stellar review to the rest.  I made it with half mayo, and half yoghurt, and it was fabulous.  Got rave reviews, even from a husband who never eats honey mustard dressing and a four year old, who was requesting vegetables to dip in it before we put it on the salad!

AH-HAAA!!! this is how the restaurants do it!!!!
CLASSIC recipe-- just a few ingredents, with a wonderfully gourmet taste!
i am having this with one of my fave Applebee's makeover salads (i think it was called Country Fried chicken Salad): breaded chicken tenderloins (sliced), sliced hard boiled egg, 1/4 cup black beans, 1/4 cup sweet corn (from a can), chopped red peppers, and a bed of chopped Romaine lettuce-- YUM!

Used light mayo and omitted lemon juice because we didn't have any at the time.  We couldn't believe how good it was!  Had with chicken fingers - and the bowl was spotless when we were done.  The next time we made it with the lemon juice, and it was a bit overpowering - we'll be leaving that out in the future.

So few ingredients make for a fantastic dressing.
I use fat free mayo in this dressing every once in awhile and the texture isn't as great but the taste isn't sacrificed at all.

Mmmm. . . yum! This dressing tastes great on a spinach salad. Another good variation is to use dijon mustard instead. Gives the dressing awesome flavor. Thanks!

This was easy to make and really good. Adjust the honey/mustard to your liking -more honey for a sweeter dressing or more mustard for a tangier one.

So good. I used low fat mayo and dijon mustard for a little kick. I also added a tiny bit of water to thin it out and mixed it with spinach salad, avacado, yellow pepper, hard boiled eggs, bacon, and carrots (what I had on hand).

My husband loved it.

Simple and Great! I did some alteration though.

I added more lemon juice, honey and mustard to cover the overwhelming mayo taste. It won't go wrong with dressings because u can adjust them to your own liking. Serve this as a dip with some celery and carrot sticks or spread it over your sandwich. Love this one!

Wonderful!!  Who knew that honey mustard dressing could be so easy and taste so wonderful.  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, because we prefer Miracle Whip.

Delicious! Tastes identical to honey mustard in restaurants. I decrease the mayo and add a little more honey and dijon mustard. But this is excellent and incredibly easy to make.

Just what I was looking for; I did, however, used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. Update: I prefer making this with mayonnaise.

This is a great and easy to make dressing.  I used lower fat mayonnaise and tried it with stone ground mustard.  I also made it with regular mustard. It taste great with either mustard!

this is a good recipe.  Im more of a ocharleys honey mustard person.  But I didnt have any on hand so I decided to make this recipe to eat with some left over chicken strips.  It was very quick, easy, and has common ingredients.  This is a keeper for the next time I run out of my regular honey mustard.

This is a great foundation!! Left out the lemon juice because I didn't have it, but tasted great without it! Also used miracle whip not mayo, both Dijon & regular yellow mustard. Kept adding mayo, must & honey til it tasted "right". Delicious and I recommend it :) We paired with HEB's chicken breast nuggets and seasoned curly fries.

Very good dressing.  Definately rich and flavorful.  Could tell it was homemade.  Was a little thick-still trying to figure out how to adjust to made it more pourable and not globable.  That is my only reason for giving it four stars-little thick.  Great recipe though and well worth trying to fix that to fit my own personal tastes.

so quick and easy.  my husband couldn't BELIEVE i made it myself.  i served it with a fried chicken tortilla wrap and ended up dipping the rest of the leftover chicken in it a few hours later for a midnight snack!

i didn't have fresh lemon juice on hand, so i used concentrate, and i added double what the recipe called for...it needed the kick to round off the sweetness.  add a pinch of salt, as well.

double it for leftovers!!!

this is EXCELLENT, and goes perfectly with the breaded chicken finger recipe on this site. AWESOME!!!  Hubby and kids loved it, and raved more about the sauce than they did the chicken (chicken was fabulous).

I could not locate any Honey Mustard dressing at all in any store in Hawaii. Since I am not much of a cook this simple recipe caught my eye. I made it for my husband and he said it's the best!

I used Sierra Nevada Honey Spice mustard for this and it was sooo good. Also I just did 1/2 TBSP of honey and I added 1/2 TBSP of Olive Oil. Excellent!

This was a great base for honey mustard dressing.  Here are the changes I made.  First I doubled the recipe, using white wine vinegar instead of lemon juice.  I then added an additional tbs each of mustard, honey and vinegar.  I then added about 1/4 tsp each of mustard powder, cayenne pepper and paprika.  With these additions, this dressing was exactly what I was looking for to go with the homemade chicken tenders I made.  Thanks!

I've avoided buying this stuff from the store because it's SOOO expensive, but making this recipe is much cheaper and it tastes just as good!  I used low-fat mayo to save calories and it was AWESOME!!!!!  I'll definitely make this again.

I doubled the honey, mustard and lemon juice amounts and added 1/2 tsp chili chipotle powder for some kick. Didn't have any on hand when I made this, but think I would prefer someone's suggestion of using plain yogurt in place of the mayo. Quite Good!

Wow! This is great! And since it's homemade, I can make it with lowfat mayo. This will be GREAT on a spinach salad with chicken, bacon, and pine nuts! Mmmm.... My kids ate it on everything on their plate tonight - chicken, lima beans, and noodles.

Great dressing. And it couldn't get any easier. I whipped this up really quick tonight and put in on my spinach salad. Very tangy. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and it was excellent.

Great stuff, I needed some honey mustard to use a spread to put on some mini Ham and Swiss cheese croissants for a potluck and it was perfect. I used low-cal "whipped dressing" (Miracle Whip), instead of mayo and it tastes just right!

Hallelujah!  FINALLY, an antidote to my way too gloppy honey mustard dressing, which I used soy sauce in instead of lemon juice.  The mayonnaise that I currently have is on the eggy side, so I would need to add more honey or mustard to overcome it, but even so, I really like this dressing.  Thank you!

Excellent! I made it two ways: one with the yellow ballpark mustard, and the other with dijon mustard and they were both really good but we were having it with Captain Crunch chicken strips and it went better with the one made with the yellow mustard.  Yum!

tasted just like normal honey/mustard, but I have never made good honey/mustard so this is great! I am horrible at measuring so I just estimated the amounts and probably added a little too much mustard so I added extra honey to balance it out. turned out great!

Fantastic!  Perfect amounts of ingredients.  I used fat-free mayonnaise and it was just fine.  I didn't have lemons on hand, so I used bottled lemon juice, and that, too, was just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Every restaurant I visit, I get extra honey mustard (to take home) because I never knew how to make it.  This is the PERFECT honey mustard, for all of you honey mustard lovers out there.  TGIF couldn't have done it better!  Thanks!

This is so good.  Better than some store brands I have bought.  I was very skeptical at first, but was very suprised.  Recommended!!!

Awsome - super simple, super good.  I agree, a little less mayo, but everything else is perfect.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!  Hubby doesn't care for Honey Mustard but LOVED this recipe!  We had it with the Breaded Chicken Fingers recipe from this site and it was great!  Used for dipping last night and as a salad dressing today.  YUM!!  Doesn't make a whole lot, so you may want to double or triple if you are using it for salad or for more than two as a dipping sauce.  Oh, I added a little more mustard and honey because it was a little mayo-y for me, but that is just my taste.  Thanks so much for this keeper of a recipe!!

Awesome.  I've made this several times and it's great as is...but I also use 1/2 prepared mustared and 1/2 dijon mustard to give it a little kick.  It's great with lime juice as well.

I have been avoiding salads lately because I am so sick of most salad dressings. I like oil based dressings but find they don't have powerful flavour so I end up using a lot which results in a high calorie, high fat salad. And bottled dressings I'm just plain sick of. When I read the reviews for this recipe I had to try it right away and I'm so glad I did. Now that head of lettuce in my fridge won't go bad.
The only modification I made was that I used low cal, low fat mayo. It is just delicious. Thanks for the recipe Mary Ann!

I had to write as soon as I tried this dressing. It is absolutely the best honey mustard dressing recipe there is. I made this dressing, along with a recipe for croutons from allrecipes and it was the best salad I have ever had. From now on, only homemade honey mustard and croutons for my salad. Thanks

This is the best honey mustard dressing. I used more mayo, mustard and honey to make it thicker for a dip. It is definately restaurant quality. My husband doesn't even like mustard, but he loves this.

WOW. I really wasn't counting on this being so good! I love honey mustard, and am very picky about which kind I like. I used less than 1/4 cup mayo (because I despise it), Grey Poupon dijon mustard in a jar, and no lemon because I had none. This was very good!

The dressing is good. I used it for sandwiches. I am in Germany and I had the spicy mustard at home. So I tried with that and ended up with something like homemade wasabi. Very refreshing. I also added some salt and pepper to it.

you wont believe this. i change it up by adding 12 teaspoon of wine wine vinegar, and apple cider vinegar, and a 14 teaspoon of blueberry preserves because i was using it over a salad of lettuce, whole blueberries and shaved almonds. it was slightly acidic to cut the sweet. it was really good

I made this in hopes of making a salmon salad similar to the wonderful one they offer at Lone Star & Long Horn restaurants. I love their dressing, and this is very close. Be sure to use a good dijon mustard--this is a great recipe. If you need more than a few servings, make sure to at least double or triple this. You can use fat free mayo too!!!

Very good honey mustard dressing.  My husband prefers honey mustard on his salads but it has gotten hard to find in groceries stores, or has too much of a dijon bite to it.  This one works well and I'll make it often.

This is very good. I tweaked mine by adding a little more honey because I like it a little sweeter. I will never buy store bought again. This is my go to recipe. Honey mustard sauce is my favorite sauce and this one is restaurant quality.

I've tried to find the right recipe for honey mustard  dressing for years, but none were ever anything worth making, and it always seemed like something  was missing but I couldn't put my finger on it--turns out it was lemon juice missing.  I made two batches of this version today, one using spicy brown and the other dijon. They are both delicious!

I was apprehensive, but stand corrected! Simple and delicious! I used Dijon mustard but that was my only adjustment. Perfect on our salad and only took 3 minutes.

I love this. I actually had to increase the proportions on the fly becuase i mistakenly picked up 1/3 instead of 1/4 cup for the mayonnaise. I increased the mustard and honey both to 1-1/2 tbsp.  Also added a finely chopped garlic clove and about half a tablespoon of some finely chopped onion. It lasted about a week in the fridge and tasted better each time i took a couple spoons full for my spinach salad.

Very good! It was more tangy than sweet, so I added extra honey in increments (1/2tsp +1/8tsp extra) for a sweeter taste without being too sweet. Thank you for the recipe!

This dressing is a winner!  I omitted the lemon juice because I didn’t have any and used spicy brown mustard. Very good. We used it on our chicken filet sandwiches with a brioche bun.

Excellent recipe Mary Ann.  PERFECT for what everyone has in their fridge.  I added fresh ground black pepper and a PINCH of salt.  I used this recipe on one pound of pasta (I used shell pasta) which included 1/4 cup fresh peas, 1/4 cup diced red bell pepper, sundried tomatoes to taste, and 2 TBSP finely diced shallot.  YUUUUUUUM!!!  There may be some marinade possibilities to Mary Ann's original formula.  Give this recipe a shot AS PRESENTED to start, then modify to your taste.  Cheers everyone.

This was a good recipe. I used two tablespoons of honey because I found that it balanced the sour taste of the mustard better. It was a hit. Tastes great with coconut chicken and green beans.

I've been looking for a copycat recipe of O'Charley's honey mustard dressing and this recipe is the closest I've come.

I used Mr. Kensington's mayo that is made with sunflower oil rather than soybean oil. I used Dijon mustard and the honey and lemon juice as stated in the recipe. The end result was heavy on the mayonnaise flavor, so I added a bit of yellow mustard and a little bit more honey.  It was very good, definitely much better than what I had been using. I will keep this recipe as my go to recipe. Its so simple and yummy, you cant beat it!)

This dressing is so delicious  that during dinner I got up and made more.  In fact, I ended up tripling the recipe and there were no leftovers.  I recommend doubling the recipe if you're cooking for two.  My friend was amazed.  She say's she payed more than four dollars for a small bottle of honey mustard mayo and it wasn't nearly as good as this.   
I made it again to serve with fillet of sole.  This time I added a tsp of curry powder.  OMG!!  It was sooooo good!

Really good!  I made it exactly as written this time and look forward to experimenting with other mustard options in the future.

Made almost exactly as written. I didn't have Dijon mustard so used regular. Still really good. Will make again for sure.

Great flavor. I cannot always find this in the stores. So I de cided to learn and make it. I picked this one because if all the great reviews. I know you will enjoy this. AND. I know what ingredients are in this, have you ever looked at all the ingredients on salad dressings?  Also, some reviewers mentioned too much mayo. I used what the recipe said. I did not taste mayo!  But creamy goodness and mustard and honey.  The video did say one member said to try plain yogurt. I might do that neit time. I doubled up the recipe twice. Put the dressing in a cute mason jar with label. I really do hope you try this. It’s a keeper.  Enjoy

Very tasty.  Was making a salad tonight & realized I didn’t have any salad dressing.  This goes together really fast & it was great.  Really like this-no junk in it like the store brands.

This is a good recipe and I'm happy to have the measurements.  I would give it 5 stars, but I had to tweak it.  I added about 1 teaspoon of ground mustard to cut down on the mayo flavor.  Then my mother said it was too mustardy, so I added about a tablespoon more honey. We compromised on the taste and it is pretty darn close to the store brand!

Not a fan of the mayo in this.  Saw the great reviews but not what I wanted.  Olive oil, mustard, honey, lemon salt & pepper is the way to go. Threw out and started again.

Like other reviewers, I changed the ratio of Mayo to honey, and mustard.  I used 1/4 cup mayo, 4 tbs honey, 4 tbs horseradish mustard (like a grainy mustard), and 2 tbs lemon. Holy Moses! Turns out just like a restaurant version! Yummo!

I wasn't sure if "prepared mustard" meant regular yellow mustard, Dijon mustard, or what. I used generic spicy brown mustard, and it was excellent! Exactly like the dip you might get with your chicken tenders at a take-out place.

Honey Mustard and Vidalia Onion are my two favorite dressings.  For this Honey Mustard recipe, I tweaked it to suit my own tastes.  8 oz. Mustard to 16 oz. Lite Mayo,  3 Tbl Apple Cider Vinegar,  4 packs of no-calorie sweetener.  Fewer calories than I would normally buy in the store, and the mustard flavor is more prominent.

Didn't change a thing and I love it. Made a fresh garden salad, topped it with a sliced New York steak, and spread the mustard  on top. My new favorite way to eat steak.

I made this  for a women's workshop where we had people with  gluten and dairy allergies . Everyone asked for the recipe and one asked for some to take home. The only change I made was to add a dash of salt  to make the sweet and tart pop a bit more. So easy with ingredients you always have. I served it on a spinach salad with dried cranberries, toasted almonds & sesame seeds, diced chicken, poppy seeds, and served Gorgonzola cheese on the side.

When I first made the dressing and tasted it, I wasn't too keen on the flavors. I poured it over a garden salad and it magically changed. This is one of the better dressings I've ever had and I've made numerous homemade ones. My wife felt there was was a flavor difference once mixed with veggies as well.

Excellent! I followed the recommendation of others and used Dijon mustard. I only added a little black pepper. Had it over a salad, and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe so I'd have some for a few more salads, or even chicken nuggets. Homemade dressings are so much better and healthier than the store-bought one! Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!

I never knew it is so easy to make honey mustard dressing.  It is so easy and it tastes so good.  I use olive oil (low fat) mayo, still tastes great!

I make this as part of our regular "yummy dressings" rotation.  It's great with regular mustard but we prefer dijon.  It's simply the best honey mustard/honey dijon I've ever had!

I made this as a dipping sauce for my wings for Super Bowl. It was alright, but I like my sauce a little more sweet so I added a half teaspoon more of honey. It was very good after this addition!

I wanted a salad and I didn't have much to work with-baby spinach, green onions, red and green peppers, olives. Pretty sad, really. I didn't even have chickpeas for protein. I decided that the solution would be a really great dressing, so I found this one. I didn't even precisely measure everything. I just eyeballed it and it made my skimpy little salad taste amazing!  Thanks for this recipe!

This is exactly what I was looking for.  To me, it tastes very similar to what a lot of restaurants use.  I cut back on the mayo just a little bit but that was about it.  I loved it.

I have buying store brand dressings. Decided  to give the recipe a try. Real easy to make.  Just the right amount of sweetness and not too tart. After this, I will not buy store brand Honey Mustard Dressing again.

I too thought with so many raving comments it was worth a try. Like others said, it tasted like mayonnaise flavored with mustard. I used Dijon mustard too which should have given it even more zest. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. I had to throw it away because there was no way to save it.

I am with those that love this. This is my third time. It is now my go to for mustard dressing. Easy, ingredients are usually on hand so no running to the grocery. Love it, making it for some friends that are coming for lunch today. Update: I first tried this almost a year ago and I am STILL using it often! It is so easy to make I remember it by heart now.

I've never really cared for honey mustard dressing/sauce because it's just too sweet. But this one was fantastic! It's more tart (I use regular yellow mustard) and less sweet than store-bought honey mustards. We also added fresh-ground black pepper to the mix, which gives it  a bit of depth when it comes to flavor.
We use this every time we make a batch of chicken tenders and I really can't get enough.

8.13.16 ~ Made this delicious salad dressing as part of a salad bar for a birthday dinner with friends. Of course, when I asked the other couples what their favorite dressing was, all four of them had a different 'favorite'. No problem, I just made everyone's favorite. This honey mustard was very well received and we liked the finished taste. It serves well as a salad dressing and also a dipping sauce.

Perfect as written! For an Indian-style twist, add 1.5 tbsp cumin and 1 tbsp curry powder per cup of dressing.

We were out of store bought honey mustard salad dressing so I thought I would see how this recipe stacked up.......oh my goodness this is SO good and remarkably similar but only 4 ingredients that I always have on hand!  Instead of store bought mayo, I used my own homemade mayo, which btw is easy peasy to make too.  This is definitely a keeper recipe ??

This honey mustard dressing is really really good.  I made it 2x's now with dijon mustard...love it.   I used it on baked chicken breast as well as on salads.  I also used it as a spread on a turkey sandwich.   There are many ways to use this dressing.  I even think it could make great potato salad.

My father in law loves the store bought type for his brats and I like using honey mustard in my special homemade baked beans. I got into a position where there was too much month left at the end of the money and the bottle was nearly empty. I realize that I had Kraft Miracle Whip, 4packets of KFC Honey Sauce left from our last dinner out, and Apple Cider Vinegar in my cabinet. So I followed this recipe  daddy in law didn't notice the difference and the baked beans tasted just the same if not better.

I made the recipe as is and it was just a tad tart for me but I enjoyed it otherwise.  I will use slightly less lemon juice next time.

My first attempt I made it exactly as described: tasty.
My 2nd attempt I halved the mayo and added Greek yogurt: still tasty!
My 3rd attempt will strive towards making it more mustard-y with a bite of some kind: that one I predict will be perfection.

Amazing.... and so simple.  This is a thick dressing and can be used to dip as well as for salads etc..  Sometimes I add 1 tbsp. of smokey barbecue for a Southwestern dressing... Love it.. Thank you for posting.

Excellent as written. The mustard taste is subtle but noticeable and we enjoyed the sweetness and creaminess of this.  Then again, we add cranberries, apples, and candied pecans to our salads often, so this just complements that.  You should adjust the sweetness according to what you are making it for.  I decided to make a honey mustard coleslaw with this . I made the dressing and then added onion juice (blitzing onions with a drizzle of water in my blender) to the finished slaw after the honey mustard dressing had been mixed in.   This is a keeper for our family.  ----- Note: do NOT use salad dressing / miracle whip.  Not the same and the flavor difference is night and day.  Be sure that you use plain mayo like the recipe is referring to otherwise the flavor of it will simply obliterate the rest of the flavors.

4.5 - Great dip recipe for things like chicken tenders.  I added an additional tablespoon of mustard (yellow) and it was perfect for our taste preference!

This recipe is fantastic! I went a little over from using exact measurements, put it in a mason jar with a lid and shook.  It was all gobbeled up, so next time I am going to triple the recipe just to have some leftovers for later in the week.  I use Just Mayo insead of the other stuff and it was awesome!

I have been searching for YEARS in stores buying dressings to find what I'd been getting in restaurants.  Had so many bottles that I threw away.  Finally dawned on me to search for recipe and found this.  Knew it was right as soon as I saw the picture.  It is delicious and so easy to make.   Will never buy another bottle.  I even make the mayo--it's so simple.   Now, I need to make it low-fat.

A simple yet excellent  recipe and easily adaptable to differing tastes.  My first taste made me want to add a hint of tarragon, which I will do next time, and serve it over some gently poached chicken breasts.  As a Salad Dressing  I may spice it up with some Cayenne .... it's marvelous !

I ended up tripling the amount of mustard after the initial tasting, just to cancel out the sweet mayo flavor.

This is the perfect quintessential Honey Mustard salad dressing.  It's also so easy to make that once you have this recipe there is no need to ever buy bottled Honey Mustard dressing again.

Good and very easy!  Perfect for dipping chicken fingers.  I used Dijon mustard.  I thought the mayo would be too over powering, so I used a little less mayo and ended up adding about an extra 1/2 TBSP of mustard.

I like reading the negative reviews & I wonder what kind of mayo people are using that they complain so much.  I used Kraft Mayo w/Olive Oil & followed the recipe exactly. Next time, maybe a little less mustard, a little more honey, but it was really good.

Made several times- subbed Agave/grade B maple syrup for honey (vegan) and used Just Mayo or Vegenaise.  Turns out fabulous every time.

This was very good!!!  I took this to a progressive dinner where we were to bring a salad dressing and a few toppings. It was a hit .  I made 4x's the recipe and as people were torn as to regular or Dijon mustard I used 2Tb regular and 2Tb Dijon.  While super tasty, next time I will use 3 to 1 regular to Dijon and I think it will be perfect. My kids were comming up with all kinds of stuff to dip into it, and they usually stick to boring Ranch.

Not only is it a good salad dressing,  it's great for brushing on grilled chicken when just about finished on the grill.  I usually sub vinegar for lemon.

I used lime juice and Dijon mustard cause that's what I had on hand.  Drizzled this dressing over cold leftover vegetables (potatoes, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, squash, brussel sprouts, etc.) and ate for a quick snack.  Absolutely delicious.  This recipe is a really fast and easy keeper!

I used Low Fat mayo, honey mustard (mustard), and honey. I didn't have lemon juice and it is a little thick as a result, but I'm using it for my 5 year old's sandwiches. He was my taste tester and he liked it and I like that I don't have to buy the corn syrupy honey mustard in a bottle!

Really, really good.  I made it with non-fat yogurt to save on calories and it was still very good.  It's a little thin but i think that's because of the non-fat yogurt. Overall, very, very good.

I loved it. Didn't change a thing. Although I should have used a real mayonnaise rather then miracle whip. It was still tasty. I used it on chicken sandwiches and they were great.

I can not find a good honey mustard dressing in the store, and this recipe is exactly what I have been looking for!  As with all recipes, I make a few adjustments here and there.  I use a mix of ground mustard and regular mustard and add a bit of garlic powder.  It never quite tastes the same twice, but it's always excellent!

I know it's something so "simple" as dressing, but this was awesome!  I have been searching for years for honey mustard dressing that tastes like what I get in restaurants with no luck.  I now know why:  they make it fresh!  I am finally getting into cooking and am making almost everything from scratch so I really was pleasantly suprised that it was so easy to make delicious dressing (and know all the ingredients).  Will never buy store bought again.  Thank you!

I tried this recipe and my family LOVED it. They all thought it was better than the restaurant honey mustard from Ruby Tuesdays. I have to make a lot of it when I make it!

We all loved it! I doubled it as I was using it to make honey mustard chicken. For one of the portions I used Mayo, the other one was Greek yogurt. A bit of salt and pepper finished it perfectly!

I'm not a honey mustard person but, I really liked this dressing.  I made kielbasa's and used this a dipping sauce along with a nice salad. The only thing I changed was the honey.  I didn't have any honey on hand but I did have honey mustard so I used that with the mayo and lemon juice.

Was very tasty!  I liked it a lot, although next time I will make it with Dijon to see what that does to the flavor- I felt it was yummy, but will look for whatever it is that I want to give it a bit more depth- will try adding some spices as other reviewers have tried to see if that beefs up the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm not a sweet dressing lover tho the bf is- he loved it and you may have converted me!

I love honey mustard, and this recipe reminds me of some I have had from a restaurant, but I can't pinpoint which one. I did not have any lemon juice, but it's great without it! Very good, I will make this again. :D

Love it! My husband really likes the store bought honey mustard but I found them lacking in flavor, just sweet. We went out to a local restaurant and they had a house version and I decided to try to make my own. This recipe is great, easy to make and last really well in the 'frig.

Simple and delicious!  I'll never buy bottled honey mustard dressing again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it needed a little bit more sweetness for me.  I just squirted a little more honey in and it was perfect.

So simple and easy to make! I used spicy brown mustard and half the amount of vinegar, since we're out of lemon, and it still came out like my favorite fast food honey mustard dip. Yum!

I'd dip almost anything in this. I've made variations of this many times and usually just eye the amounts, but never considered the lemon juice. It made a nice difference.

I love this dressing. I sauté fresh sliced mushrooms and put them on lettuce. Butter lettuce is my favourite for this salad but any lettuce works. Then just before serving pour this dressing on and mix. It disappears everytime.

Too thick. Just a touch thicker than dip. Certainly not salad dressing worthy.

This is our new favorite!  Excellent!  I used low fat mayo and dijon mustard with Chardonnay instead of regular mustard.  My husband said it was better than any restaurant dressing he's had.  A keeper!

I made this exactly as written and it is so good! I've tried every store bought brand and nothing worked for me but this is delicious! I would recommend making exact recipe then adjust and experiment to your taste. Great flavor as is and a great base for many different tastes. Yum....

This was super easy and great! I added more honey because I like mine to be sweet, and I didn't have lime juice so I just left that out.

So easy to make and great flavor even though I don't like mayo.  Will try with yogurt next time for a healthier version.

My husband is a real honey-mustard fan, and I tried this when his bottle ran out.  He really liked it.  this would serve 3 individuals, I think. It's so easy, don't think I'd need to make more to store - just make it fresh every time.  Thanks for a terrific find!

This recipe is super easy and tastes great! Tastes just as good, if not better, than the bottled dressing.  I tried it with regular mustard and dijon mustard and both tasted great.

I made baked chicken tenders tonight and when the youngest asked for honey mustard, I didn't have any on hand.  So I decided to find a recipe online and found this one first.  It came out great!  I did have to add a bit more honey, but that may be because I used local grown honey and it was not too strong.  Everyone loved it, including me.  Will be a stable from now on.  No more store bought.

I made this as written, tasted it, and immediately tripled the batch!  It is creamy and yummy, a perfect balance of flavors.  I served it alongside the Alice Chicken recipe in place of store bought, and it could not have been better.  I am so glad I made extra- I can't wait to try it on my salad tomorrow!

Good and simple - exactly as advertised. The lemon juice brightens it up nicely. Made far more than three servings for me - used one tablespoon for a spinach salad for two.

Quick and Easy. My husband and daughter love it with ham. I personally don't care for mustard but I think it tastes good too. I add cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt. Also, I use creamed honey rather than the regular variety.

This was extremely helpful when I had no honey mustard on hand for a recipie. I did use spicy brown mustard in stead of regular prepared mustard; which takes a little of the sweetness away (which I wanted) for cooking. As a dip, I would use regular prepared mustard for  more sweetness (or on a sandwich).

Overall good consistency, nice and simple flavor...but boring. To spice it up I doubled the honey and mustard, added 2 pieces freshly grated garlic and sprinkled salt and pepper. You can add a few tbs oil if it is too thick for you.

WOW, this is REALLY good. I am a big fan of honey mustard dippers and this one wowed me!  For such simple ingredients, it is SO tasty - just like in a restaurant!  I used Hellman's Real Mayo and store brand Dijon mustard. 

I might experiment by adding fresh garlic to use as a marinade and I'm curious about other reviews using nonfat plain yogurt. Will try next!

Very simple and very tasty recipe that is made with ingredients that I always have on hand. Wish I would've found this sooner! Didn't change a thing except I used half real and half fat free mayo. Next time I will make more and store in an empty container in the fridge. Tastes amazing with homemade chicken fingers and french fries.

Great.  Easy.  Quick.  Delicious.  My go to salad dressing.  I always add a healthy dose of extra virgin olive oil.  It thins out the dressing so it's not so concentrated and makes it a bit easier to coat the vegetables.  I find it too strong otherwise.    We also use honey mustard instead of mustard, and don't use mayonaisse, but a whipped dressing.  (Since that's what's on hand.)  Very good!

This is a very good honey mustard dressing.  Like others, I used fat free plain yogurt instead of mayo.

I made this the other day with the correct measurements for 9 servings and it tasted like I had just made a bowl of mustard tinted mayonnaise. I had to add a lot more mustard (approx. 1/3 cup or more total) and several tablespoons more of honey before it even tasted like normal honey mustard. After all the hard work and refrigerating overnight it tasted delicious! I would highly recommend this recipe, just be prepared to add more honey and mustard.

Simple and delicious! I used fat free plain yogurt instead of mayo (never liked mayo) and I thought it tasted great. I think the proportions are spot-on, but they can be easily adjusted to suit individual tastes (another bonus).  Thanks for sharing this one, I'll be using it often :)

I really hate saying this, but I didn't really care for the taste!  I felt like it had too much mayo and I even substituted some of it with plain yogurt!  The mayo taste was really strong, and I love mayo!  Hmm...might try it again but not sure.

I used plain no-fat yogurt and then followed the directions exactly.  This was really, really good!  Use a good quality mustard (I used 1/2 deli mustard and 1/2 yellow mustard) and honey.

I was looking for a lower calorie dip for baked chicken tenders.  I tried this using Dijon mustard because we love the taste, this was excellent.  I made it again and doubled the recipe.  This time I did half low fat mayo and fat-free sour cream.  Again very good--it did not taste lowfat.

I did not want to set my fork down for a second because this was so tasty!  I had tried to find the perfect honey mustard dressing/dip at various stores for years!  Who knew it was this easy to make!  It literally took less than five minutes.  I read a few reviews before making it and decided to quadruple the recipe and I'm so glad I did!  It set over night and I'm having it with a grilled chicken salad.  Heavenly!  You'll love it!!!

WOW WHAT A TRIP!!  I HAD NO IDEA THE FLAVOR WOULD BE SO GREAT WITH JUST FOUR INGREDIENTS.  I used dijon mustard and light mayo and it was just fab.  I will never buy the store stuff ever again!  I put this on a wedge of lettace with carrots, mushrooms, cucumber and green peppers for my hubbys lunch.  I will see what he thinks when he eats it tomorrow.  My kids tried and they really liked it ***EDIT** I MADE THIS WITH THE PREPARED MUSTARD AND DID NOT THINK IT WAS NEAR AS GOOD AS WITH DIJON MUSTARD

I just made this for a family dinner and it was a huge hit.  I did the recipe X4 because there were alot of people.  I used 1/2 yellow mustard and 1/2 whole grain Dijon and followed everything else as written.  It will be a staple in our house for sure.

I just made this dressing, unfortunately the only lemon I had left was too old to use. I only noticed after I had everything else mixed together. It didn't need it, was delicious without it. I imagine it would have made it a little thinner and gave a a little zing. Since I made 4x the original recipe I'll add some lemon juice tomorrow. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was tasty. I accidentally used dijon instead of regular mustard and low fat mayo and it still came out good. I used creamed honey, which is thicker than regular honey so I had to add some water to get the right consistency. Yummy!

This was delicious! Much better than any bottled version I've ever tried. I used Grey Poupon dijon mustard, which was delicious. I ended up having to add just a smidge extra mustard, at first it was a little too mayo-y for me; I doubled the recipe & added maybe a teaspoon extra. I will never buy bottled honey mustard ever again!

SOOOO good! Tastes like store bought...it's still pretty high calorie, but if you're going to indulge-this is the way to go!

My kind of recipe -- quick, easy, and delicious.  I used the mayo, but after reading on the the reviews I think I'll try it with the plain yogurt sometime.

This was a really simple recipe.  My favorite honey mustard dressing is at Ruby Tuesdays and this was very close!  I didn't have lemon juice, but it was very good!  I like mine a little sweeter, so I just added more honey to my taste.

Wonderful! I used it as a dipping sauce with some baked chicken. My boyfriend (who hates the store-bought brand I use) ate about a gallon.

A great recipe, as-is.  However, it turns out pretty thick-- more like a dip-consistency.  For a true "salad dressing" consistency, I added a bit more honey (I like mine super-sweet!) and a little more lemon juice, and it was perfect.  Will definitely keep this one in my "go-to" list!  :-)

Where have you been all my life? Rather than spend several dollars for a bottle of honey mustard dressing, you can make this for pennies and it tastes fantastic! I made this exactly as written and it will be a staple in my home forever. I dipped Mini Crescent Dogs from his site and got rave reviews from my friends. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

I have been trying to steer away from store bought dressings and found this looking for a mayonnaise based one.  It is fantastic!  The honey takes away the sharp tang of the mustard, but not completely so you can definitely tell it's in there.  I made a double recipe to have with salad and my kids used it as a dip for homemade chicken fingers.  This is a dressing I will make a lot!

I made this recipe last night to drizzle over some asparagus.  Wow!  This tastes every bite as good as any of the best honey mustard dressings I've ever tasted!  I added a pinch of salt and course pepper to it, that's it!  Thanks so much for this!

This was fantastic.  I didn't even bother adding mayonnaise.  Just dijon mustard, honey, and lemon or lime juice or even red wine vinegar.  It was delicious.  I will make this many times!

I liked the flavor a lot, but ended up adding double amounts of honey & mustard.  Then just a touch of pepper & horseradish. Otherwise it was excellent!

I substituted Agave since I didn't have any honey. I also used a stone ground mustard, and reduced the amount of lemon juice to half a teaspoon. It came out superbly.

I have just started to make my own salad dressings in an effort to stop eating so much processed  with ingredients I can't pronounce and this recipe did not disappoint. I added a little more water to the recipe but otherwise was good as it's written. I imagine using dijon or other mustards would be good too.

WOW! I love this recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added maybe a teaspoon extra of mustard and honey, but that was it. This dressing is amazing! I have a hard time judging mayonnaise in recipes for some reason lol and I found that the proportions in this dressing are perfect!! Thank you so much for sharing this. I'm going to make this from now on! Very easy and simple.

I wanted to make this low fat, so I took another reviewer's advice and used low fat yogurt instead. Only I didn't have plain yogurt so I used lemon and omitted the lemon juice. It is pretty good, I'm sure mayo would be better (but isn't everything that's fattening?) I added a little salt, pepper, parsley and white vinegar to cut the sweetness a little. I think this would be best with dijon or a spicy mustard, but that's just my preference. Overall, great recipe. I love when I can make something with ingredients on hand vs store-bought dressings.

Loved it!  I was looking for a recipe similar to Ken's Steakhouse Honey Mustard (because it's gotten awfully expensive!); this one is mighty close...Thanks for sharing!  Mmm...may take Marianne's idea & make it with Dijon next time; sounds wonderful!

This was really really good. I doubled the recipe and used fat free plain yogurt instead of mayo and dijon mustard from trader joes. Also added a little bit of black pepper. Fantastic!

I took this on a salad to a baby shower, and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe and used a deli mustard as the mustard in the recipe.   I later added 1 T yellow mustard to give it more mustard flavor, but every one loved it!

So fresh & delicious...and EASY too!  I will never buy honey mustard dressing again!  I served it at a dinner party over fresh greens with homegrown tomatoes and onions, and my guests couldn't get enough.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks!

Surprisingly yummy.  I didn't feel like going to the store for dressing so I whipped it up with ingredients I already had and was pleasantly surprised.  I used it as a salad dressing on top of 50/50 mix of baby spinach/baby mixed greens, sunflower seeds, crumbled white cheddar, croutons, and bacon bits.  Very versatile. I can see how people say it would be good for dipping.  And, it had a great consistency--- not too runny, not too thick.  I suggest doubling the recipe.  It will be used fast.

We really loved this dressing. As written, it is perfect as a dipping sauce. I added a little extra lemon juice to give it a runnier texture for our salad. Divided in half, it made just enough for a large salad for two of us. Used low fat mayo to cut the fat a little. Very, very yummy! Thanks, Mary Ann :)

This came out very well! I made the honey mustard as suggested. The only thing that was changed was the lemon juice. I didnt have any on hand, so I substituted lemon juice for apple vinegar. Still turned out wonderful.

I had never tried honey mustard dressing before  and I have to say what a wonderful treat it was.  We had a tossed salad with chicken chunks one of those super hot days we had recently.  This dressing was so good and so easy to make, I think it will be my regular for a while.  It is an excellent recipe!

What a wonderful dressing! The flavours are well balanced and the ingredients don't overpower one another. This is definitely a keeper. UPDATE: I made this dressing several hours before serving and left it at room temperature. The taste was slightly different. I would recommend making the dressing either just before serving (since it's so easy) or refrigerating as soon as it's made until ready for use. This is a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

This was so good! I took the advice of using fat-free yogurt. I then used some actual honey mustard (2tbls). Will use again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! I made a few additions and it was awesome. I doubled the original recipe, added 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp rice vinegar and a dash of black pepper. I served it over a spinach salad with garlic croutons.

When I added a lot more mustard, and a lot more honey, it actually tasted like honey mustard. All in all it's a good recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! It tastes just like the stuff you buy but its even better since its homemade. I have always tried to make honey mustard in the past but all I ever did was mix the two together & got gross results. I am soooo glad that I found this recipe. The kids were wanting to eat this with a spoon they liked it so much! Thanks!

This recipe is good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because after the first time I made this I decreased the mayo to my liking. The dressing just had a little to much of a mayo taste.I would suggest adding mayo and then tasting the mixture, and keep adding more to your taste. This is a great dressing for a salad for just a sandwich!

I don't even like mustard, but when i tried this my taste buds screamed for more!
i loved this because it was so rich and tangy. 
although, i added more lemon juice to bring down the mayo taste, and i added a pinch of garlic pepper. 
Now, i keep a jar of this sweet sauce in my refrigerator for whenever i need it!

I am bonkers for this dressing!  Wow, if you haven't tried it, do so TODAY!!  It has the right balance of ingredients; I always stick to the recipe as written.  Thank you so much for making my salads a little bit 'sweeter'!

Pretty good.  I added a little water to mine because the dressing came out thicker than I wanted.

Okay - so yummy.  I tried this because I wanted to have a creamy dressing on hand and we were out of ranch.  I don't like honey mustard dressing but found myself dipping everything in it.  I used a stone ground mustard and it was wonderful, will make again soon.

Absolutely fabulous!  I swapped lime juice for the lemon juice and added just a spoonful for light mayo becasue I wanted to save a few calories.  Actually, I eyeballed all the measurements and it was fantastic!  Definitely a keeper ... and SO easy!!!

This was very good.  I liked it and I don't like mustard.  My husband likes mustard and also loved it.  It's very sweet and pungent.  We have also done it with spicy brown mustard and it is also very good and not too spicy at all.

Excellent!  I always use plain fat-free yogurt in place of the mayo (you'd never know).  I usually add black pepper, cayenne pepper and some chopped scallions all to taste.  I'll never buy store bought honey mustard again!

Like another reviewer, I am not a big fan of honey mustard combinations.  But this tastes light and fresh.  I substituted low-fat honey-flavored greek yogurt for the mayo and omitted the honey.  I also added a tad more lemon juice than called for.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good recipe. I tweaked it just a little though due to my southern taste buds. I decreased the mayo and increased the dijon mustard to taste. I also added about a 1 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce and used about a 1/2 tsp of pepper. Very good!

Simple recipe with nice flavor, but something is missing, not quite sure what.  If I make it again, I may try to play with the ratio of lemon juice, honey, and mustard or maybe I'll try a spicy mustard.

We made this tonight to dip homemade fries and chicken nuggets (Baked Chicken Nuggets from this site) and I really liked it.  It was super easy and not overpowering like bottled honey mustard.  Really good for dipping.  I'm excited to try it with the Alice Chicken from this site.

tasty, quick and easy--not life changing or anything, but exactly what I wanted from the recipe.

I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I substituted apple cider vinegar and it worked well.

Once I doubled the mustard, honey and lemon juice called for to cover the mayo that I could taste, it was a great dressing.  I used low fat mayo and brown mustard.  I plan on trying again w/ dijon.

This dressing is excellent! I have actually been making honey mustard like this for years but my version did not include lemon.  The lemon must be the secret ingredient that mine was missing. I doubled this recipe and used low fat mayo and it came out great. You can experiment with all types of mustard to make this a bit more sharp.

It really is amazing that these four ingredients can be SO GOOD! I'm not a big mayonaise fan - but I didn't even taste the mayo. I used dijon mustard - and it's perfect!!

Great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I used it with salad, but I'm sure it would be great with chicken too.

Pretty yummy - especially when used to did Baked Chicken Nuggets from this site.  I used dijon which combined with the lemon juice the recipe called for, gave it a nice kick.  Will use again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never been a fan of mustard but recently was adventurous and tried some honey mustard at a restaurant.  I liked it so much and came home and found this recipe.  I made it with Breaded Chicken Fingers from this site and LOVED IT!

This is sensational--we had it with fried chicken strips and on grilled burgers this weekend and it was equally good on both. The mayo provides creaminess for the perfect ratio of honey & mustard. I might try it with fat-free mayo to make it more healthy. Excellent recipe!

Simple and delicious. I like to use a really grainy Frech mustard. Makes a perfect spread for sandwiches instead of regular mayo.

This was a great recipe! Although I added less than a tsp of regular yellow mustard for more of a tangy taste than of a sweeter flavor. Keeper :)

I;m not a honey mustard eater, my husband is.  However, I made the Baked Chicken Nuggets from this site (as I regularly do) and this dip.  I have to say it was just the right amount of ingredients.  Didn't change a thing.  Doubled it, in fact, to the same proportions as stated.  Very, very good.

I have never found a honey mustard dressing close to the ones I like at restaurants, but this one was great. It really does taste great as a dipping sauce and a salad dressing. It's so much better than anything I have found at the grocery store. Thanks so much!

I really thought this was a pretty good recipe.  It was tasty and my 5 year old loved this dressing and wanted to eat it as a soup!  I am not really sure it was exactly what I was looking for but it is something that I will make again!  would be great with some chicken fingers!

I don't, as a rule, like honey mustard.  But I got some chicken crispers from chilis and they didn't add sauce.  So I made this.  OMG.  IT'S SOOOO GOOD!!!!  Do *not* make this unless you want a new addiction.  It's absolutely yummy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

So perfect!  I was craving a salad from a local deli with their honey mustard dressing and this definitely hit the spot.  I used 1/2 Tb. stone ground mustard and 1/2 Tb. yellow mustard.  Yummy!

This was great. DH loved it, and was skepical at first when I told him I was going to make it homemade. He said he expected it to just taste ok, but it ended up being his favorite. Thanks for submitting.

I make this for my grandsons chicken tenders.  He says it's so much better than what my Mommy buys!!! Really a nice blend, a special request for when I am frying up chicken.

This Honey Mustard was great! I whipped it up in a flash, like 2 minutes for a salad dressing!
Tastes just like the name brands!
WOW

A-ha!  Now I know what was lacking in all of the other honey mustard dressings I've tried... lemon juice.  Really perks up the flavor, yet cuts the sweetness of the honey.  Made mine with f/f mayo then drizzled on a spring mix salad with red bell pepper, sweet onion and purple grapes.  Delicious... thanks!

We were at our vacation home and found all our dressings were out of date.  I quickly went to allrecipes.com and found this recipe.  I whipped it up with the ingredients I had on hand. Including the lemon juice. We have a lemon tree by the front door.  So I was able to add fresh lemon juice.  The dressing filled the bill.

Good.  I added some white wine vinegar & wish I would have added less of it... My fault.  It was quite yummy before my heavy handed addition...
