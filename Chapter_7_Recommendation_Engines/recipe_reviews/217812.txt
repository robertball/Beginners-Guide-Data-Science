This is a nice change from the usual. It's quick, easy and very, very tasty. I followed the recipe to a T, tasting as I went along. I was a little wary of using the whole amount of dijon but it didn't overpower at all. The only change I would make is to use tomato paste instead of the ketchup, as I thought the sweetish tang of the ketchup was a bit much and add a bouillon cube. That's just personal preference, though. All in all, a great meal, thanks :)

I have friends demanding that I make this recipe for them! I did change it up a bit. I don't include the mustard, just because I didn't have mustard the first time I made it. The tomato juice I sub for pasta sauce. For veggies I put in a can of peaches and cream kernel corn and then I top it off with some parmesan cheese sprinkled over the potatoes.
So good!

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, as did my wife. I followed the recipe almost to the letter, only substituting frozen corn for the mixed veggies. Also, I didn't mix the corn with the meat, but simply layered it on top before I spooned on the potatoes. Very flavorful mixture!

Just made this for my family and it was DELICIOUS!!!  Oh and did I mention easy!!  I did use two packets of instant potatoes thought since I am a mother of 2 having to cook fast.  Also, I substitued a bay leaf for the rosemary.  My little boy keeps saying "Momma good" if that says anything at all.  Will definetly pass this recipe on!

I am not a big fan of ketchup but thought I'd give this a try. My husband thought it was tasty, but I had problems with the taste at mealtime and beyond. I think I'll go back to a real classic Shepherd's Pie.

Delicious! Very different from the regular pub style Shepherd's Pie, but still great! I didn't add thyme or rosemary, but I did add Epicure's Roasted Garlic and Epicure's Beef and Pork seasoning. I also decided to opt out on the ketchup and tomato juice but I used 1 and a half cans of tomato paste instead. I would suggest adding the salt and pepper according to taste as I ended up using much less salt and a lot more pepper (personal preference).

The best!  MUCH better when you make this homemade version.  I added the Horseradish and Cayenne Pepper which gave it the perfect, yet not overbearingm zip....Oh, & I used instant pototoes which I didn't think made any difference, they browned up real nice.

Great recipe! For those "non-Brits", the history behind Shepherd's Pie is that it is a left-over meal prepared from Sunday's Roast Dinner. Combining chunks of the left-over roast, the veggies, and then using the left-over mashed potatoes on top. English food, on the whole, tends to be bland so the spices in this recipe are great! I serve it with beef gravy and yorkshire puddings...

Way too much Dijon - it overpowered the dish.  I tried to compensate by adding more ketchup & Worcestershire.  There are much better shepherds pie recipes out there.  Keep looking.

Amazing. This was the first recipe I attempted, and the reviews were smashing! I replaced the ground beef with Boca Crumbles. Awesome vegetarian option.

This was my first time making Sheperd's Pie.

I didn't have the rosemary seasoning so used marjoram, I'm not a big fan of thyme so will definitely not use so much the next time. I also used onion soup mix to give it more flavor.  I would recommend tasting your the meat mixture to add more salt and pepper to your suite your taste buds.

Other than that it was easy to make and a great comfort food that will keep the the belly full and satisfied.

This was great! My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so this was perfect. He loved it. Neither of us had ever tried shepherd's pie before. It's  nothing fancy, but was a nice warm, comforting and tasty meal.  For dessert: Country Apple Dumplings

My family really enjoyed this one. I didn't have tomato juice so I used 8 oz. of tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of water instead. I made it in the morning and it was all ready to put in the oven for dinner. Will make this recipe again and again.

Fantastic! My changes: I omitted rosemary (my husband hates it) but it probably would have been good :) . I did not have white potatoes so I used sweet potatoes. I used a can of tomato sauce instead of tomato juice and omitted the flour. I borrowed another reviewers idea and added cheddar to the top. It was amazing! Thanks for this great recipe!

I wanted to take a picture to add but it went so fast there wasn't enough time. I took it to my grandparents and they loved it! Two thumbs up! Even my three year old's gobbled it up! I will definitely make this again. Next time I may go a little lighter on the rosemary and thyme though. Other than that this recipe is A+.

This was great!  Two fussy little boys ate it up.  I used  Alexia frozen mashed potatoes cooked in the microwave to save time.  I didn't have rosemary so I substituted the same amount of dried basil.  Delicious.

If it uses beef it is cottage pie, NOT shepherd's pie.
Shepherd's pie is ONLY made with lamb.

It was good, but there was too much tomato for me.  But that's personal preference, so I can't fault the recipe entirely.  Everything else was fine; I did use dry mustard in place of the Dijon, and I always use corn or peas as the vegetable.  Oh, I also like a small amount of cheese in the potato crust, but that's how I grew up eating shepherd's pie

This was good for a base recipe which I tweeked based on ingredients I did/ didn't have. I used v8 juice instead of tomato juice and didn't have the needed herbs so just used parsley instead. My veggies were corn, peas, and carrots. Fiancé said it was better than his grandma's cottage pie!

The flavours are great! My husband and I Loved it! For our personal preference, I used mashed cauliflower instead of the mashed potatoes, almond milk instead of milk and some diced tomatoes w/the sauce since I did't have the tomatoe juice. The amount of dijon was a bit strong for me I'd use less next time. Other then that I would make this again, original recipe or to my preferences!

I tried this several months ago, and absolutely loved it! I love spicy, so when I make it either tonight or tomorrow, I plan on trying the horseradish, cayenne pepper and the Dijon mustard. I looking forward to it! Thanks!

Classic Shepherd's Pie Haiku: "(It's really 'cottage.') Shepherd's pie is made with lamb, but this was still great!" Followed the recipe as written, but as I didn't have dried rosemary, I just used 1 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning in place of both it, and the thyme. Swapped out beef broth for the tomato juice, and used a packet of instant mashed potatoes to make this easy recipe even easier.

I made a few small changes based on what I had on hand. I had no thyme or rosemary, so I used a basil/oregano packet I had. I used about half balsamic vinegar ketchup to give it an extra kick. I have often found that tomato soup in recipes can be too runny, so I used tomato sauce. I also did not have regular Dijon, so I used chipotle mustard. I think I will try it again, sticking to the ingredients to a T, and see how it turns out. I also preferred my veggies, peas and corn, layered on top of the meat mixture. When first done, it was a little runny, not really sticking together like a pie.. but after it sat overnight, it was more solid. The meat mixture itself was great, and I think could be a stand alone recipe for a home made sloppy joe mix...

Very good.  I changed it a little for what we had on hand and our food allergies.  I used beef broth instead of tomato juice, and added a couple of tablespoons of mayo.  I also cooked down carrots, celery, onion, and garlic as my veggies and added black eyed peas and corn to make it go further.  (LARGE FAMILY!!)  We topped ours with cornbread, and it was lovely!

I made this for my husband's birthday celebration and my family loved it.  I substituted half and half for the milk and added extra garlic to the potatoes.  I sprinkled sharp cheddar shreds on top of the potatoes after the casserole finished cooking (about 1/4 cup).  Will definitely make this again.

My boyfriend orders this dish pretty often from the neighborhood Irish Pub and since he had a tooth pulled earlier today, I thought I'd treat him by making it myself. This is the recipe I chose to follow.

The *only* change I made was substituting the ground beef for meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork and veal); everything else was true to the recipe.

He loved it! He said it's BETTER than the dish at the pub! And that's saying a lot -- he's one HECK of a picky eater! I thought he'd get a bit anxious seeing the ketchup and mustard as ingredients (something he'd define as "weird" in a Shepherd's Pie) but once the dish came out of the oven, he could not stop marveling over how great it smelled. And that was only a prelude to the great taste!

I myself had two servings. Great recipe! 10/10, will make again! Thank you!

The second time I made this, I layered the corn on top of the meat rather than mixed it in (I used ground pork both times) which was better in my opinion. Also, rather than using tomato juice, which I found a strange ingredient, I used canned tomato sauce and It turned out pretty delicious, my family really enjoyed it.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I had to double for our family size though and so the prep time took me a long time (peeling, cutting/mashing all those potatoes! and onion) and made it not the best choice for a week night meal for us. Also, the mustard taste was really strong. I will do less next time. Will make again though!

100% recommended! 

I added additional veggies; green beans, mushrooms (baby bella), diced tomatoes (canned, Italian seasoned), and frozen/shelled edamame. Red/orange/yellow and/or green peppers would be phenomenal as well (next time!). Tomato paste works great to thicken it up a little instead of adding extra flour. If you want to save some time: use instant mashed potatoes (make according to the package instructions) and layer 'em on top and/or generic, frozen "mixed veggies," usually some combo of peas, carrots, corn, and beans is perfect; just throw the whole bag in. Also for next time, I will replace the potatoes with mashed cauliflower and broccoli. I made this once substituting ground beef with ground chicken/turkey (you can use any ground meat or leftover. Actually leftover beef roast, cubed or thinly sliced/chopped would be awesome). When I made this for my vegan brother, I substituted ground beef with mushrooms (chopped portobello, white, and shiitake was the combo I used). I have also just used generic "Italian seasoning" (marjoram, basil, thyme, savory, rosemary, and oregano) if I am out of the fresh stuff and it worked just fine 

This is a GREAT, EASY, PERFECT fall/winter comfort food!...and plenty of ways to make it even more healthy and get all those veggies into ya! 

I think I have made this 5-6 times and love to play around with the recipe...its super flexible and if you don't have 1-2 things, there's easily something you can replace it with.

Thanks!
J

Boil the garlic with the potatoes and mash altogether. Used beef broth instead of tomato juice; didn’t  want that much tomato flavour. Also used a mixture of pork and beef.

Similar to my own recipe where I use a package of onion soup mix and for the topping half potatos/half yams. I put  old cheddar cheese in between the layer of beef mixture and potatoes and then on top too!!

One of the things I loved about this recipe, before I even made it, was that it offered variations on it, depending on your preferences. My husband loves anything spicy so I chose the zesty option. After reading other recipes and variations on them, I decided on four changes...to use a crust on the bottom (Pillsbury Pie Crust), substitute mixed veggies with frozen corn, layer the corn on top of the meat mixture but below the mashed potatoes, and to replace ketchup with tomato paste. I also used an extra 1/2 lb of ground beef and cut the Worcester sauce in half.  I first put the crust in a hot 350° oven for about 7 minutes while I cooked the meat mixture. Assembly was a snap, and I added another 10 minutes to the cooking time.. This dish was indeed zesty and very tasty, and my husband and I both loved it. I definitely will make it again, but here’s what I plan to do next time...I will eliminate the oil altogether and cook the ground beef first, then cook the onion in the juices with the ground beef, drain, and then add the spices. I’m not a big fan of Worcester sauce and may cut it even further, if not altogether. I think the mustard alone would provide just the right amount of tang. Now that I’m done talking about it, I can’t wait to make it again.

I topped it with duchess mashed potatoes and made a brown gravy with the minced beef drippings.

This was baked this in an aluminum pan for easy cleanup. I doubled the recipe. Added shredded parmesan cheese  after the meat mixture and before the potato layer. 5 min before it was done added shredded sharp cheese on top. It was loved by all.

Made with ground deer (husbands a hunter), extra garlic, and cut up my own veggies (3 cups of carrots, celery - forgot peas) recommend cooking veggies until very soft before placing in oven. Very generous with spices, and did “twist 1.” Got husbands families dish of major approval and are internally  calling this dish “hunters pie.” 100% would make again.

1. Shepherds Pie is made with Lamb not Beef (the clue is in the name a shepherd is a sheep herder)- you make Cottage Pie with Beef.

2. Sweetcorn - REALLY!!

I doubled this recipe in order to fill my large lasagna pan.  The family loved it.  The only thing I would change would be to use less tomato juice as the casserole was very liquidy.  The leftovers however were perfect after it thickened some.

Did not like the worcestershire sauce flavor. Maybe 1 teaspoon instead of 2 Tablespooons.  Also, less rosemary.

Yummy and easy. Ketchup is a strong flavor in this. I think the rosemary could have been grounded to make sure there wasn't any large stick - like leaves.

I made a Paleo version of this by using cauliflower mash instead of mashed potatoes. I also loaded it with veggies. I roasted broccoli, corn, carrots, and green onion, but the broccoli wasn't the best texture for the dish. Next time I'll use peas instead :) Super tasty overall.

This pie was delicious. I made the meat a mixture of beef and ground turkey and added cheddar cheese to the potatoes. This was made for company who never ate anything similar. Everyone enjoyed.

This was a tasty dish for St. Patty's Day!  I cheated and used prepared Bob Evans mashed potatoes, which made this a breeze to put together.  Hubs loved this.  Next time I might use less (or skip) the dijon, thought it came though a bit too much.  Enjoyed this.

Great recipe! Easy to substitute various veggies (I don't care for cooked carrots). I used peas and corn. Also made a pie with ground spicy pork- the potato softens the bite. Although, I did have to play around with the potato amounts, but that doesn't change the rating. Recommended.

Yummy!  I set aside onion and garlic mix, adding after browning meat to avoid over cooking.  Added some browned chicken and apple sausage.  Used tomato paste, not ketchup.

This recipe, resized for 36 servings, was a great crowd-pleaser at a church supper.  Five- and six-year-olds came up to tell me how much they liked it, and it had visible corn and butterbeans!  I personally prefer to substitute tomato sauce for ketchup as the sweet taste puts me off.
