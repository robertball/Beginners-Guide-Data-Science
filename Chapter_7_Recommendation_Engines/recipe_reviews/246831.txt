Basic Cream Cheese Flan. Have been making flan like this for as long as I can remember.  Depending how I feel, I will make it without the cream cheese using 1 cup heavy whipping cream in place. Easy to make, easy to eat and easy to like.

Couldn't get my sugar to brown. It just hardened at the bottom of my  mini Bundy pans. SUPER EASY to make!!!! Tastes just like cheese cake not flan though. Too heavy
Didn't have evaporated milk substitute 3/4 cup on milk , 1/4 cup of half and half. 
Can't wait to make it again!!!YUM

adding water to  the sugar is unecessary. Not sure if I put that in the original recipe.
