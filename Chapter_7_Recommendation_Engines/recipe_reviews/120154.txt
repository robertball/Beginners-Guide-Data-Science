I am astonished that anyone would rate this fabulous recipe low!  I used a wild turkey breast (and few things are harder to make tender and juicy...) and followed the directions with two minor changes.  I deleted the tarragon and added 4 slices of provolone cheese before spreading the spinach mixture on the breast.  The end result was probably the best wild turkey my husband and I have ever had!!!  The presentation was incredible and even the leftovers were great!!!  Kudos, Shirley, for a first class recipe!!!  The wild turkeys (and domestic ones as well...) around here may become endangered if this recipe gets out!!!

I only had turkey tenderloins so I couldn't really make the rollup. I ended up spreading the mixture on top of the turkey, sprinkled on bread crumbs, grated cheese and added some butter. It was fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good! I added some chicken broth to the roasting pan to help keep the turkey moist. I also used thickly cut onions instead of a roasting rack, which added some nice flavor.

I had the most difficult time wrapping this thing up and then had to cook it at a lower temp for longer because of time issues....was DRY.  Could've been my fault and will attempt it one more time, exactly, and see how it goes.

Amazing! even my picky 5 and 6 year old like it and asked for more! we made it with turkey breast tenderloins so it was like several mini ones it cut the cooking time significantly as well.

I enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I added was a bit of garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes plus swiss cheese in the sauce.  Mine was not so pretty - but still tasty.  This is a good value meal when the local stores carry turkey breasts at a good price.  I usually thaw it, bone it and use half for a marinated turkey breast on the grill (see this site) and freeze the other half.  This is a good recipe for the second half.  Lots of good meals for little money!

I must admit, I only used the idea, not the recipe. I used my homemade stuffing in place of the spinach mixture and served it for Thanksgiving. It turned out perfect - and so pretty as well! Thanks for the great idea!

Rolling or wrapping the turkey was very challenging but worked out in the end. The family enjoyed the flavor so the extra effort was worth it.

This recipe is excellent.  I followed it exactly except I purchased 4 small turkey breasts that totalled roughly the 3 lbs. and butterflied them and pounded them thin.  This way I didn't have to mess with the deboning.  This worked out well and I'm sure this would be just as good with chicken breasts.  Everyone loved this dish.  Next time I would use fresh mushrooms and saute with the onion.  I have to admit that I felt weird putting velveeta cheese in the serving sauce for a dish that looked so elegant but it worked and tasted good - I might try it with different cheese next time.  I also think these would be just fine without the finishing sauce.

5 stars for a great idea! I tweak this to our own tastes. I make a savory stuffing with breadcrumbs and dried cranberries to stuff the roll. I like this even better than a traditional stuffed turkey at holiday time! Also, in a pinch, I have also used two large whole chicken breasts. Just make sure you butterfly and pound them if necessary. Hope you enjoy this like we do!

I used 2 turkey breast tenderloins (24 oz total.) and a few toothpicks to keep it together. Could have cut filling in half because there was a lot left over. No mushrooms added some shredded cheese to spinach mixture about 1/4 cup.

We really liked this recipe. I may choose to have the butcher butterfly the turkey breast next time to get a more uniform thickness. I did need help tying the roll, but would definitely make it again.

I had been having a hard time finding something EVERYBODY liked, and this turned out to be a HUGE favorite. Everyone was amazed, the only disappointment was the lack of leftovers!!
