Ohhhhh....... this soup is wonderful!! I was looking for a way to use up a rotisserie chicken, and hit on this recipe.  The only changes I made were to add mushrooms, because you can never have too many mushrooms in anything.  The other change I made was that I use the product called "Better than Bouillon" instead of canned chicken broth, and I added some extra to make the soup a bit chicken-y-er; I thought it tasted a bit flour-y. Oh yes, and I used skim milk in place of the ff half and half.  Wonderful soup! I served it with the bread called "steakhouse bread" from this site--warm from the bread machine. A perfect meal!!!!

If you want to get a good meal on the table with minimal time, effort and dishes, this is a great choice.  Doing your prep work ahead of time makes it even easier.  This is rich and satisfying, but still nutritious given all the good meat and vegetables - even more so if you skip the flour, which I did.  I’s not necessary.  I added mushrooms to the mix which was a good and compatible addition. Loved the zucchini in this for substance, but loved the addition of the red bell pepper even more – it gave the soup a great boost of flavor.  I used full fat half-and-half, and chose to use a little more chicken broth than the equal parts broth and half-and-half called for.  We like very simple, fresh flavors, so omitting the nutmeg and thyme was a good choice for our taste preference.

This is better than the gnocchi and chicken soup at a major restaurant chain known for it's 'garden' if you get my drift. This is the best recipe I have tried on this site so far and considering I have tried approximately two hundred, this is saying a lot!  I don't buy rotisserie chicken but I own an electric pressure cooker that takes fifteen minutes to cook several leg quarters to fall off the bone tenderness so I used that instead.  I also reduced the half & half by one cup and used milk instead.  The only other change I made was to omit the red bell pepper since I don't like it.  This was the perfect way to use gnocchi in a different vehicle than just covering it in sauce.  It is my favorite pasta and I love it cooked past the point of just done and more on the 'fluffy' end so allowing it to cook in this savory mixture created the perfect texture to my taste. My family raved about this soup and the recipe is going in my rotation to be made regularly.  Thanks Kristin for sharing this awesome recipe!

I thought this was absolutely wonderful.  The roasted chicken really made a difference.  My husband in really not into veggies so I was able to hide most of then by using an emersion blender on everything but the chicken and the gnocchi (left out the red pepper and the spinach..that would be hard to hide, and put that in my half).  Snuck the rest right by him and he really liked it too.
Thanks Kristin for getting veggies into my husband!

Oh my - YUM! Made as recipe as stated - except used 1.5 cups of half-n-half and 1.5 cups of fat free milk and added sliced mushrooms.  After tasting, added more black pepper, thyme, nutmeg and added some rosemary and grated parmesan cheese.  It got pretty thick, so added 1 cup of water to thin it out a bit.  Really delicious.  Will make again and will also try with leftover holiday turkey!

This was excellent! Even better than Olive Garden if you ask me. I added mushrooms since we love them. Seasoned it to our taste because it tasted a little bland following the recipe. Everything else I kept the same! My husband isn't a big soup lover and he had 2 bowls ;)

Everyone loved it! I added mushrooms just because I had some. I think this would also be good with tortellini instead of gnocchi.

This soup is awesome!  I read a lot of the reviews and made the following minor changes:  3 cans of chicken broth, approximately two tablespoons of Better than Bouillon chicken base, 1 pint half and half, 1 cup skim milk, 5 cloves garlic, about 1/4 yellow onion, and 4 ounces fresh sliced mushrooms.  Oh, and a little less flour.  My husband said I have got to make this next time we have company, it is that good!  I added more chicken stock the next day when I warmed it up.  Thanks for a totally fantastic recipe!

I really enjoyed this soup, but it had a sweet flavor that I was not expecting. I guess it was all the carrots and the nutmeg it had in it, but it is a nice flavor for fall. Here are a few of the changes I made to this soup:  I thought I would try cutting down on the fat and used evaporated milk instead of the half and half suggested. I also added some chicken seasoning which I had on hand, after feeling like the end product was slightly bland. Oh and I didn't have gnocchi, so I found a great gnocchi recipe on this site and it turned out to be fairly easy to make.

I used one pint regular half&half and one cup sour cream, left out the red bell pepper (I hate peppers) and the spinach (whoops, I forgot). Also I made the Gnocchi I recipe and used that instead of getting ready made. When it was almost done I took the chicken and veggies out, brought the soup to a boil and used that to cook the gnocchi instead of cooking it seperately in water and adding it in. It made enough to feed three adults and one child with lots left over and it was even better the second day.

It was delicious. I did this pretty close to how the recipe was written except I did not have any red bell peppers. I also did not use fat free half and half, I just used half and half and whole milk. I also used kale rather than spinach because that is what I had on hand. However, I doubt these adjustments made much difference in flavor and it was simply fantastic. Not difficult at all.

Family loves this rich filling soup.  Have made twice and find it too thick even after adding extra broth.  Next time will omit flour.

Awesome recipe! I added mushrooms and 2 cups of additional chicken stock. Next time I would boil the gnocchi before putting it in the soup. Very good recipe all around.

I followed this recipe and it was delicious! The only thing I changed was that I added an extra 1/2 tsp ground thyme, and the chicken wasn't shredded rotisserie. I just cooked 2 pieces of chicken and added it to the soup. Cutting all the vegetables took a lot of time so this is a dish that takes quite a bit of prep time, however it was worth it!

What a great dish!   I have made this twice, once as the recipe stated.  The second time I used a smoked chicken sausage!  I browned it first in a skillet, then while the pan was still hot poured some chicken stock into the pan to save the renderings and then to the pot!  Very tasty!  Gave it a new texture.  Originally I used nutmeg and no thyme, the second time, realizing I was out of nutmeg, I improvised and used pumpkin spice that contained cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice...the cinnamon was awesome!!  It tasted like fall.  I will make this again!!

The best, and easiest, homemade soup I,ve ever made. I  was able to tailor the recipe to 3 different diets within my family of 6 fairly easily.  I also added extra chicken stock for a flavor boost and used a rotisserie chicken for added speed.  Made everyone that came by try it:)

This was delicious! Even better the next day as the gnocchi soaked up all the flavors of the soup. I did make a few modifications though since I didn't have zucchini or rotisserie chicken. Instead, I boiled some chicken breasts and used the water that they were boiled in for the chicken stock. I also added some mushrooms, garlic powder and basil and used 2% milk instead of fat free half & half. I took Kristin's suggestion and served with pesto bread sticks and it was a big hit! Definitely will be making this one again!

This recipe is delicious!!!  I always put more veggies and chicken because I love a hearty soup or stew.  Change out the veggies with the ones you enjoy, but the key is to make sure to follow the recipe about sautéing veggies in olive oil and then adding the flour/gluten free flour because it is what makes the difference and the half and half or cream.  SO Yummy!!!

Wow! Delicious! Beyond delicious. So, so, so good. Made it as directed, with the only change being that I used unsweetened original almond milk instead of fat free half and half. I’m not a fan of anything fat free. It’s amazing!! We will definitely be eating this again!

This was EXCELLENT!!  Next time, I will not use the flour though, as I don' t believe the soup needs it.  With the flour included I had to add an addt'l cup of broth and 1/2 c. of Half n' Half.  The gnocchi will automatically thicken the soup.  Again, omit the flour!  Added a bit more thyme and pepper, but did not add any salt.  PERFECT!

This was soooo good.  During my lunch break yesterday, the Dr. I work with looked in my bowl and asked what I was eating and where did I get it!  I brought her a bowl today and she loved it!  My husband even liked it.  I did do just a couple of things differently.  I added the zucchini about a minute before adding flour, didn't want to overcook it.  I used 2 percent milk to make it a little lighter, but it didn't affect creaminess at all.  I also used chopped kale instead of spinach.  It was very flavorful.  I'll be making this again...and again...and again...

Excellent soup - one of the best we ever had!  We didn't have nutmeg, so we put a dash of cayenne pepper instead.  We also put only regular half and half in the soup.  I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen instead.  Soup was creamy, colorful, and tasty.  Will definitely make it again!

This really is a fabulous recipe.   I almost feel it tastes better than Olive Garden’s.   Absolutely will make it again.  Very nutritious with all the fresh vegetables.   I also added a tablespoon or so of “Better Than Bouillon- roasted chicken base”.

It was a nice warm meal on a cold night.

Awesome!  I believe its better than Olive Gardens. My whole family loved it. Its a great Winter comfort dish. I added a little more vegetables, just cause I love vegetables. Only thing I would change is adding 1/2 of a yellow onion instead of whole one. I prefer to know its there not taste it. My onion was about the size of a baseball. I also put almost the whole chicken in it. Can never have enough. I think I will be making this again this week since I turned some family and co-workers on to it.

Easy & delish soup. Hearty and good flavors, except we decided the thyme was not a compatible addition.  It reheats beautifully, if much more chicken broth is added.

Very delicious! Husband loved this! I used poultry seasoning rather than the thyme and nutmeg, although a sprinkle of nutmeg would be delicious. Also, rather than nutmeg, a light sprinkle of ground allspice on top of each serving would be yummy, too.

Excellent soup! I followed the instructions exactly only leaving out thyme because I didn’t have it on hand.  The gnouchi was a delightful exchange for cut potatoes.

I personally didn't care for the bell pepper (felt it was too strong a flavor compared to the other more mild ingredients) but did overall enjoy the recipe.  Very easy to make and the rest of the family enjoyed it as well.  I try it again without the pepper.

The whole family enjoyed this soup.  For personal preference I opted not to thicken the soup.  With this recipe having gnocchi in it I opted to give it more of an Italian flavour to it by adding Italian seasoning and parley in lieu of the thyme and nutmeg. I also added some mushrooms which complemented the soup nicely.  Added only 1 1/2 c of the full fat half and half cream and the rest was extra chicken stock.  This was a very flavourful soup and we enjoyed the combination of the vegetables in the soup.   Made the gnocchi from scratch for the first time and they turned out great!   Served this soup with homemade no knead bread.

Wound up making this..cutting the recipe in half for two of us.. I suddenly realized I had smoked chicken sausage on hand  and not the rotisserie chicken, so, I used it chipped up into tiny pieces..I used just one kind of half and half, and chipped up the spinach.  Two of us ate all of it..It was heavenly..and I have more snocchi frozen and waiting for another cold day here in Florida..

WOW !  I never had  gnocchi, wasn't sure  if I'd like it. This soup is amazing, I had to change slightly  to work with what's on hand. I skipped the  half n half, used  a can of evaporated milk with equal amount of water. Had no zucchini, used a 10 ounce jar  of mushrooms, likewise  a 10 ounce jar of roasted red peppers for the fresh, and had  8 ounces of  frozen chopped spinach. I will absolutely make this  again. When  I can , will use the  fresh vegggies  called for. But  it's  so unusual, and I just love it  for a dreary, rainy  Fall day.Thanks.

This is a great creamy, flavorful soup. I did make a few changes using what I had on hand. I used left over turkey meat I had in the freezer and turkey stock. I also substituted diced roasted butternut squash for the zucchini. I will be making this again, it was amazing.

This was good. I left out the olive oil and used only butter. I also added Cremini mushrooms, which definitely was a good addition and added shredded Parmesan to each bowl. I left out the celery and red pepper, but would probably add the red pepper back in next time for flavor. Overall, this was flavorful and I followed the spices set out in the recipe. I also only had fat free creamer and heavy cream and added about two cups of the creamer and 1/2 cup of cream; I also used a full box of chicken broth (4 cups). Yummy!  I love gnocchi and this was a great dish. Husband and mom loved it!

What a nice change from chicken noodle.  My whole family, including the picky, likes everything the same, child, enjoyed it.  Asked me to make it again.  And i WILL!  Only changes I made were kale in place of spinach ( didn't have any).  Mighty tasty.

This soup was delicious. I added shredded carrots and a pinch of rosemary. Hubby rated it a 4.5 out of 5!

Left out celery because my daughter doesn't like it; used only fat-free half and half; added a bit of chicken base for a bit more flavor. Will make this again.

My family and I thought it was great!  I didn't do the fat free half and half instead I did 2 cups of milk  and I didn't put the red bell pepper or the onion cause my kids hate onions but it turned out great!

Thank you for such a delicious recipe.  I previously tried a recipe that was supposed to be a copy of the Italian chain restaurant and could not taste the similarity.  This however, is BETTER than the restaurant one!

I was really looking forward to making this soup as I had just had it at Olive Garden and loved it. I was a little disappointed because it tasted like straight up cream. Maybe I used the wrong kind but I had to keep adding more stock and spices to change the taste.  I'll make it again but instead maybe use less cream or whole milk. Someone mentioned sour cream. That may change the taste a little.

This came out sooooo good!! I opted to go with another reviewers suggestion of the 'better than bouillon' instead of the chicken broth as well as skipping the spices and flour. It came out perfect. I added extra water for the soup and more veggies and chicken. There's no way to mess this up! The kids loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

This soup was REALLY good! I made it for my boyfriend, son and I and all of us had 2 helpings. I didn't give it 5 starts because I didn't have the nutmeg to add in it, and I want to make it again before I give the final rating.  I was trying to follow the recipe exactly, but I had to change a few things based on what was available. I didn't have zucchini, so I added another celery stalk and about 1/4 more onion. Next time I won't do that onion wise because it was a bit strong. I LOVE onions, but it could have overpowered it if I hadn't made enough broth. I also used all half and half, because that's what I had, and a little extra spinach. No nutmeg  but it was  still WONDERFUL.  Can't wait to make it again with all the ingredients!

I usually make this with lots of veggies, vegetable stock and no chicken for a yummy vegetarian soup. I don't add the flour but use a combination of milk and cream instead of the half and half to make it thick enough.

Made this 3x and it's so AWSOME, the only change I did,is adding chicken breast with veggies when sautéing and I use Italian seasoning.  Comes out perfect every time, my whole family loves it.

It is soooo good!! Lots of colorful and delicious veggies! I accidentally bought the fat free half and half only and just used that. You can make it as thick as you want or add more water to thin it out. This will be a keeper it my kitchen!

A lot of work but well worth it. My husband always says "it's good". This time he says it's the best soup I've ever made. He is planning company to show off too. It is extremely delicious. I'm 60 years old so this ain't my first rodeo. Fabulous!

I was looking for a recipe close to the Olive Garden version of this soup...This was even better!  Instead of half and half (which I didn't have on hand), I used a can of evaporated milk.  I also used Mrs. Dash instead of the thyme and nutmeg.  This soup was a hit with the family!

So easy and soooo good! Followed the recipe exactly, did add some extra broth. I made a double batch because I was giving some to neighbors. Wouldn't change a thing.

This soup is pretty good. I love creamy soup and this is definitely that.
