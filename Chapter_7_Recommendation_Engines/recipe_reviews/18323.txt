Very tasty.  Lots of flavors I like.  However, it was too sticky.  I hadn't rinsed the rice but will make sure I do next time to take that extra starch away.

I used to make "risi a bisi" when my girls were young.  They loved it.  I had forgotten about it until recently, my eldest called me for the recipe and low and behold, you had this featured.  I have sent it on to them. after making it to check it out.  Wonderful!!

Cook time varied with my crock pot.  The rice turned our very tender almost gummy.  This was my first experience with rice in the crock pot.

I didnt use the crock pot. Instead I used a skillet. I used a whole onion (purple, but yellow would do) and a few shitaki mushrooms. I fried the garlic, onion, and mushrooms in a little grape seed oil (better for you than olive oil, check it out) until softened, dumped in the rice and covered with chicken broth. Didnt have Italian seasoning so I substituted with oregano, rosemary, and a little parsley and ceyenne pepper. When most of the liquid was out of the pan, I stired in the peas, just to warm them up. Instead of parmesan cheese I grated asiago over top. I will make it this way again.

I made this and wasn't impressed - the flavor was very good but the texture was that of playdoh - not light and fluffy.

I'll try again.  Seemed to taste good but I had a big pot of mush.

I consider myself to be a fairly good cook and this recipe bombed for me.  It was complete mush.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but I think I'll stick with my rice cooker.

This recipe turned out kind of bland.  Also, don't try to cook it on the stove instead of a crock pot.  For most things it works, not this one.

I don't have a crock pot so I cooked this in the microwave oven. It is good, and I would serve it again.

Very bland! I had to add lots of cheddar cheese to this after cooking it so that it would have flavor.  Cream of chicken soup might give it more flavor than chicken broth.

The only change I made is to put diced ham (1 cup)  into the recipe.  It is the first time I have made it in a slow cooker.  Much easier than standing over the stove making it rissoto style.

I looked up the recipe to get the basic ingredients for a dish I remember loving. I wanted to make it with caluliflower rice, so I didn’t slow cook it. I just cooked it on the stove top until the liquid was absorbed. I also started by sautéing the cauliflower in butter for a minute, then I stirred in more butter at the end.
