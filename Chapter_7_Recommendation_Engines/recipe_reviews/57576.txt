Supurb flavor!! I used a 7 lb roast and added 2 Tbsp garlic powder to chili powder and blackened seasoning. Also, I added a cup of wine to the 2 cups of water in bottom of pan, which enhanced the flavor of the au jus. Will probably use chili powder with a little more "zip" next time for added spice (used mild this time). Final note: Pull your roast just before you think you should, then let it sit as recommended. Meat keeps cooking even after it's removed from oven, and you can always cook longer if it's too rare, but you can never uncook it. Overall, this is a must-try if you enjoy flavorful, delectible prime rib!!

This is an excellent recipe,but at what point do the seasonings become redundant? I mean 3/4 cup of chili powder? I added all the ingredients together and by the time I got too the soy sauce I'm wondering why do I need another 1/2 cup of chili powder. So I added the blackened seasoning to the bowl and added 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/4. Then I splashed enough water in it to desolve the sugar and wet the seasonings. I also did't separate the meat from the bone. I poured the mixture over the meat. It was very thick and clung nicely.I let it sit in the fridge for an hour then I cooked it as directed to 145` and was quite pleased with the result. I will definitly use it again and I will try it on pork spare ribs.

I love the blackened taste but there's a fair bit of waste with the bones in this cut.  I wonder if you could get more value for your money by using the same spice mixture with a boneless cut.

this is one of my favorite meat entrees to make but a prime rib is often too expensive for my budget so I replace with a cheaper boneless cut like shoulder or butt most of the time. cooking time is about the same. it's less decadent but you get similar flavors. since it's cheaper I can stretch the meal a bit farther and have leftovers for roast beef sandwiches the next day!

I cooked this for my staff today for our Christmas "lunch". I was a little worried that it would be too spicy for some, but everyone raved about the taste. Great recipe....won't be the last time I prepare prime rib this way!

I dont make it this way every time but it has become our favorite and most requested for Christmas! I followed directions and the spices formed a crust which we peeled off before carving. Such a great flavor all the way through to the middle hardly anyone used Au Jeus {spell} or horseradish! You know its great when all you hear is MMMMMMMM, Chewing and clancking silverware! Read one review that said it wasnt flavorful enough, she must have really messed up because I have had Prime Rib from everywhere, its my favorite, and this is definately the most flavorable recipe I have had! It was hard the first time to put that much chili powder on a $150 roast but am I ever glad I did! I recomend following recipe exactly at least the first time, chill overnight and remove from fridge 1 hour before cooking. Cook to your liking! ENJOY- 6 Stars

My family agreed that we really didn't taste any difference in the meat.  To prepare this was time consuming and to no advantage. Sorry, Bill, but the 'old classic' is easier and faster for working mothers pressed for time.

This made way too much.  It did not flavor the roast except on the outside--which was too spicy/salty for me.  Ended up scraping off the seasonings and not eating the outside of the roast.    Next time I roast it as is, in a 250 degree oven with oven thermometer.

I have made this many times over the past 10 years... The key is to mix up enough of the rubs  both wet and dry to get that perfect crust on the meat. And, don't be afraid to let it blacken in the oven for an extra minute or two.....Succulent!

I will definitely make it again - it is our new Christmas meal!  We have been making this recipe for several years now.  My mom doesn't really like spicy food, so she just scrapes off the outside crust and eats the rest - she really enjoys it, also!  Very easy to make - hint - the 1st time I made it, I used a glass pan...  don't do that!
