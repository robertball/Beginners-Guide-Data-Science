Definitely a good starting point for this dish. I substituted veggie broth for the water. Also, I'm not a fan of the packaged sazon mixes because they typically include too much MSG. Instead, I make my own sazon with  a teaspoon of turmeric, a teaspoon of paprika, a half teaspoon of Portuguese assafroa (safflower powder), a quarter teaspoon on saffron (crushed). Add some turmeric and paprika to the white rice while it's cooking for a delicate orange/yellow color.

This was excellent! The sazon turns everything into a beautiful color that pops. It made my chopped onions look like chopped red bell peppers. I made another Mozambique recipe from this site last night as well and this one was my favorite. The other one called for a full beer and the rice added in. The half a beer in this one was spot on and served over rice was a much prettier presentation.

Use a Portuguese hot sauce, such as Gonsalves.

Use A LOT MORE than 2 Tablespoons!

Very good!!!  My wife and I just returned from the south coast of Massachusetts where this dish is hugely popular and we fell in love with it while we were there.  I made it exactly as described with the exception that I used "Piri Piri" hot sauce I picked up at a Portuguese market in Fall River, MA in place of the Tabasco.  Very good, savory, and wonderfully flavorful!  Definitely on our list of regular dishes to make.
