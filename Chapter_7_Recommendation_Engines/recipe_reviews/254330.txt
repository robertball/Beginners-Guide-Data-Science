A good version of Vietnamese coffee. I used a stainless steel filter for the coffee. The addition of chocolate is nice. Thank you for the recipe.

I really like this coffee. I found that I had some left-over sweetened condensed milk and searched for ways to use it. This recipe popped up. I used 8 oz. strong brewed coffee instead of 2/3 cup, and I used 1 tsp. cocoa powder because I didn't have the hot cocoa mix. It turned out delicious!
