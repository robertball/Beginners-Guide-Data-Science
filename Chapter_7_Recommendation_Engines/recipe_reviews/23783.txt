Nice salad!  Although the description mentioned walnuts, they were not listed in the ingredients section nor the directions section, so you may want to write them in when you print out the recipe. To save time, you could substitute bottled Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing for the dressing listed here.  They don't taste exactly the same, but close enough and certainly a time-saver for busy cooks.  Very attractive salad!

Oh my! This is one fabulous salad! Not only is it pretty to look at, but it's chock full of wonderful flavors and textures.  I added a little cooked crumbled bacon and for the dressing I subbed olive oil for the walnut oil.  This was a nice mix of sweet and salty!

I made this salad for a potluck style dinner party and it was a hit! 
The only changes I made from the recipe was that I used mixed greens - with some nice bitter leaves (argula) - to contrast with the sweeter dressing. I didn't use dried cranberries and I prefer shallot to red onion. A favorite in regular rotation now!

This is a very good salad.  I like it because you can change ingredients around.  I use apples instead of cranberries.  I would also use rasp. jam WITHOUT the seeds.  They get in the way when your eating.  If the dressing seems to thick you can add more vinegar.  I also switch the vinegar and oil depending on what is in my cupboard.  I use a mix of sesame and olive oil, and regular vinegar if you are in a rush.  Bleu Cheese is not very kid friendly, but I do serve with Carmelized walnuts.  I have made this recipe at least 10 x now.  Two Thumbs Up!

I recently made this salad for a work potluck and it was a huge hit! The blue cheese I used was quite strong, which gave it quite a kick.  However, after being refrigerated for a couple of hours after it was tossed together it became quite overpowering.  I would suggest using a milder blue cheese, or only tossing it together when you know it will be eaten right away.  Thank you for this excellent recipe.

This is one terrific salad!  I love the home-made dressing, I did sub balsamic for the red wine vinegar and used veg oil.  Only thing, I really don't care for the tomatoes with the craisins, so I left the fruit out this time.  I also used toasted pine nuts in place of walnuts.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! Didn't have time to brown the walnuts so used raw. I suggest waiting until moments before serving to toss with vinaigrette, otherwise spinach gets that heavy, wilted look. The bleu cheese and cranberries are an excellent combination. The gang loved this. Thanks!

Wonderful salad.  I normally don't make changes to recipes but I decided to use what I had on hand.  Instead of walnuts I candied some pecans = 1/2 cup pecans to a 1/2 cup sugar which were candied in a skillet.  Didn't have avocado, but will add this next time.  Very beautiful presentation too.  Thanks Tiffany!

This salad is fabulous!  I like to add candied pecans instead of the walnuts.  It is wonderful for holidays, but I spruce up a boring dinner with it as well.

5 stars for the dressing alone...easy and delicious.  I used ED Smith Jam which is a nice quality jam, which I think definitely makes a difference.  The salad itself was great and I followed the recipe exactly.  The only hesitation I had was with the tomatoes, I wasn't sure they would go with the other ingredients.  I put them in and they were ok but next time I am going to try sliced pears or apples instead.  I think either of those will be a much better match with the other ingredients.  Definitely a must try, you will like it!

We enjoyed this salad combination.  I used store bought raspberry vinaigrette as I had some on hand and it saved time.  My husband thought the tomatoes didn't belong but still enjoyed the salad.  Thanks!

This recipe came to my email today and what perfect timing!!!  Hubby was making dinner tonight as I shoveled the snow in the frreezzing cold. It is a nice trade off we have with each other...LOL!  Came in to check my e-mails while dinner cooked and found this salad recipe.  Just so happens I had most of the ingredients so thought I would make this salad to go with the baked salmon and roasted vegetables dear hubby was cooking. Substituted balsamic vinegar and olive oil (only 2 tbsp) as did not have the ones called for. Was low on the raspberry jam so added some bumbleberry jam I made in the summer. Substituted Asiago cheese in lieu of the blue cheese and added celery and apples as did not have any tomatoes. Had everything else called for. OMG was this ever good and paired very well with dinner. The dressing was to die for! Will not buy store bought again after making this!!! Served dressing on the side instead of on the whole salad.  What a versatile recipe when you do not have all the ingredients. Can`t wait to try it with the walnut oil...its on the grocery list! This harvest salad recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making it again and again! Thank you for submitting this awesome recipe!

Made this for Easter....WOW....so good!  I had to sub a few things in the dressing (used white wine vinegar and a different oil because that is what I had) and it still was really good!  Will be making this again for sure.  I'm going to buy the walnut oil because I'm sure it will even taste that much better with the right oil.

Classic staple in my home.  My mom loves this recipe - it helped shift her from cookbooks to allrecipes.  Alterations:
1.  I use feta cheese instead of blue cheese.
2. Omit the walnuts.
3.  Sub olive oil for walnut oil.

This was so good ,even my picky husband who hates vegetables loved it. I made a few adjustments I added 1/2 baby spinach and half spring mix. I used a no sugar strawberry jam (that's all I had) and a red wine vinaigrette. It was really good,  I'll definitely make this again and again.

Absolutely five star! My family LOVES this recipe. We exchanged the walnuts for salted sunflower seeds to balance the sweetness of the dressing and my husband likes a little bacon in it (for the same reason) but it is also perfect just as-is. We'll keep this recipe forever!

Outstanding salad Tiffany! I omitted the tomatoes because I was afraid they would overpower all the other ingredients. The vinigrette was out of this world. Next time I make this, I think I may add some cooked diced bacon.

Love this recipe.  We make it all the time now and the kids eat it (while picking out what they don't like :).  Every time I make this for guests, they rave about it and ask for the recipe.

I have to agree!  Fabulous!  I'm trying to find new and wonderful salad ideas, and this one is hard to move on from because it is SO good.  I'm not a blue cheese fan so I used reduced fat feta, and it is still wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

I was looking for something just a little different and came across this recipe.  I made it minus the avocado, only because I didn't have one.  The flavor is wonderful.  I took a short cut on the walnuts -- browned them in just a few minutes on top of the stove (instead of the oven) to release the oils.  Just watch them, they can burn quickly.  I used a bottled Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette dressing and we were all pleased with the results.  I also added croutons to this for our taste.  Will definitely make again and again.

I did not make the entire salad from this recipe, just the dressing. It was super easy and fast to make, and it tastes great! Way, way better than the raspberry walnut vinaigrettes available at the store. I will definitely make this again, often! I served it over a romaine salad with fresh raspberries and sweet/salty toasted almonds. It was great...thanks for sharing the recipe!

My new favorite salad!  The only things I did differently were to omit the tomatoes and I did not use all the oil called for in the dressing. I also used olive oil.  I used maybe 2 Tbsp.  I served bleu cheese and mozzarella on the side since not everyone in my family likes bleu cheese.  As per advice on the RE here, I sliced my avocado up 10 minutes before dinner and tossed them with a little lemon juice.  It worked perfectly as my avocados stayed nice and green.  I will be making this again and again!

Sounds very interesting but I thought it was supposed to have walnuts in it.  There is walnut oil listed but no walnuts in the recipe. Also, how does one carmelize walnuts as one reviewer suggested?

I made this recipe for potluck and it bacame one of the most popular salads. I took the suggestions of few of the previous reviewers and made the following changes: - substituted olive oil in place if walnut oil - carmalized onions: added some balsamic vinegar to sliced onions and roasted it in owen for 5-7 minutes - chilled all ingredients separately in refrigerator and mixed them all just before serving I know some people didn't roast the walnuts, but roasting it really added some crunch to the salad.

This salad is a great combination of color, flavor and healthy ingredients.  I love the "good fats" from the walnuts, avocado and (olive) oil; the antioxidants from the spinach; the flavors of the blue cheese, onion and raspberry; and the chewiness of the cranberries.  I highly recommend this salad!

Great!  I left the leaves aside till serving time.  I put the leaves in each dish, then the rest  (mixed with some leaves)in the middle of each plate. It's pretty like that, If not the mix will make the leaves look soggy after being in the salad bowl for a few hours.

this salad is wounderful, but i did make a few changes like every great chef. insttead of using walnut oil i used almond oil, not only is this a more affordiable way to go, to me it tastes better. the walnut oil is a little over powering to the other flavors in the salad and with the toasted almonds there is no need to have such a strong nut flavor.:) i hope that i helped and i hope you have a blessed day.

I made this salad yesterday for a neighborhood get together.  Followed recipe exactly, and with rave reviews here on allrecipes...  I thought it would be better.  (don't like to usually give low marks)  Maybe I wasn't crazy about the walnut oil in the dressing and should try making again with olive oil.  Otherwise I won't make again.

This is a staple salad at my house, although I use goat or feta cheese because I don't like blue cheese. I interchange the nuts and fruits to change the taste depending on the meal, but definitely a favorite salad.

Delicious Salad. I used olive oil instead of walnut oil because I didn't have any, and also used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar. It turned out very well anyway. Everyone loved it!

This salad looked and tasted very good. It was quite flavorful, but only in moderation. I enjoyed the first bowl so much I went back for seconds. Half way through the second bowl it became a bit much. Will def make again, and limit myself to one bowl. Thanks!

pretty good.  the red onions should be soaked in cold water before adding to the salad...or roasted w/ balsamic vinaigrette in the oven to carmelize...otherwise, they're too harsh for this salad.

Great combination of flavors and textures! Very rich, though--we had it as a meal in itself and were stuffed afterward. The dressing reminded me just a little bit of Catalina or French dressing, with a slight yogurt tang. The walnut oil has a mildly sweet flavor that complements it perfectly. I didn't toast the walnuts, and I used minced shallot instead of red onion because I prefer the milder flavor; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I'd change is to add just a few more nuts for extra crunch. Thanks for another great salad to add to my huge collection!

Great salad! I made some changes (only because I didn't have some of the items on hand). I didn't have dried cranberries, so I added a chopped granny smith apple, and a always have Lite Raspberry Walnut dressing in the fridge (either Ken's or Publix brand), so I used it. The combination of flavors was very good. I made a big bowl for my fiance and I to nibble on here and there, and I ended up eating the whole thing. :)

This was a terrific summer dinner, light and easy. On personal preference, we skipped the cranberries, bleu cheese and onions. Instead, we added a chopped apple as one reviewer suggested, plus mandarin oranges and pea pods. 

The dressing was terrific. We used blackberry preserves (I don't care for raspberry), red wine vinegar and sesame oil because I could not find walnut oil. I also used the sesame oil to pan-fry some Tyson's frozen breaded chicken breasts, then sliced and tossed them in the salad with the dressing.

This turned out very well - I think next time I'll skip the tomatoes and pea pods as they just got in the way.

Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box Tiffany!!

The flavors complement each other perfectly! I made it an hour ahead and let the ingredients mingle. Don't change a thing!

Too many strong, distinctive flavors in one salad.  Mild flavor of the avacodo totally lost, and cranberries don't taste good with blue cheese.  I'd suggest separating the ingredients into 2 salads...though the raspberry dressing was good!

Quite unique, the ingredients worked VERY well together.  The only thing I would change would be the choice of cheese, possibly Feta.  Otherwise...WONDERFULLY TASTY!!

I brought this salad to a barbecue party, and everybody including 4 teenagers loved it. Fruity, colorful, flavorful! I substituted the cranberries with fresh raspberries and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Great recipe.

We loved this salad and made a meal out of it the whole thing.  The only thing I changed was to not use spinach leaves it does disastrous things to me, so I used one head of torn Bibb (Boston) lettuce for tenderness, a handful of chopped Romane for crispiness, and a handful of arugula for spiciness. Everything else was the same.

Really good salad.  I made some changes just based on the items I had.  I used olive oil instead of buying walnut oil.  Also, I had a mixed berry jam on hand that worked perfectly.  The dressing was outstanding!  The tomatoes sounded weird with the other items so didn't used.  I love avacados but I thought they tasted a little strange with the dressing, so next time I will not include them.  I liked some other suggestions of adding some different fruits (berries or apples).  I also like the idea of throwing in some bacon.  I will definitely play around with this recipe.  It's worth it for the dressing alone!

This was delicious. I used organic spring mix and olive oil in place of the walnut oil. Some others had said that the dressing was too sweet. I found that to be opposite. I had a hard time getting the jam to blend with the oil & vinegar and to add that little bit of sweetness, I used 1 and 1/2 packets of splenda. Next time I'll try to use a hand held blender to get it to mix better. Either way, this is a fabulous recipe.

A family favorite.  Just made it for a large group (a birthday party at my house) and everyone was raving about the salad.  A few went home with the recipe.  I am only recently a fan of avocados but usually as guacamole.  Was a little hesitant about fresh avocado on salad.  Wow!  I loved it!  I had to triple the dressing because I didn't add it to the salad itself.  I put it in a dressing bottle for guests to add what they wanted.  I still may make more dressing next time.

A really easy salad that delivers on flavor. I made it for company and it was certainly a hit. I like spinach based salads for the nutritional value, and this one will be a keeper. I liked the dressing as well and would certainly use that for a quick fix for other salads in the future.

Yum!  I changed the salad dressing a little to omit the jam and instead added some balsamic vinegar and fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Brought this to a potluck and it was devoured in no time.

This was so delicious. Omit the onion, tomato, and avocado, and it's a perfect small sweet starter salad to kick off a nice spicy soup. Good with diced green apple too.

Amazing salad.  I added celery, omitted the tomatoes and added bacon.  Everyone raved about it.  Also, the dressing is better with less EVOO and more red wine vinegar.

Delicious!!! I took this to dinner with friends and it was a hit. My changes: left out the tomatoes (we don't care for them); used a bag of Spring Mix salad instead of the spinach, I didn't toast the walnuts (didn't notice anything amiss). I also used seedless jam (all I had onhand) and olive oil instead of walnut oil. THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!!

Thanksgiving morning my husband and I needed a recipe to bring to the family Thanksgiving meal. We found this one--we've never cut up ingredients so fast in our life! The salad was a hit--the avocado amazing. We're making it for Christmas dinner but we'll put the avocado and dressing on the side so the avocado doesn't get lost and people can choose the amount of dressing.

I loved this.  I brought it to a friends house this summer.  We are going back for Thanksgiving and they asked me to bring this salad again for the meal.  Pretty memorable I guess.  I did serve the blue cheese on the side as not everyone likes it.  They don't know what they are missing!

I think this recipe is GREAT! I served it at a party with rave reviews.  I agree with one reviewer that the seeds in the raspberry jam detract. I used seedless.

A wonderful salad!  The cranberries, blue cheese and dressing make it delicious.  Only change I would make would be less onion; unless you're making it for onion-lovers.

I absolutely LOVE this salad.  Any dried fruit you prefer can be substituted for or added to this salad.  I like to candy my nuts instead of toast them.  The dressing is the best raspberry vinagrette I have ever tasted.  Simply perfect.  It is my salad of choice during the holiday meals because of its sheer beauty of color.  I usually put many of the items on the side so that people can add what they like and omit what they don't care for.  Thanks for this truly wonderful salad :-)

I made this salad for a dinner I went to, and it was a BIG hit. The salad has
a wonderful sweetness to it. I too, could not find Walnut Oil, so I substituted
Sesame Oil. I will definately make this again. Thank you Tiffany for the wonderful
recipe!

I looked all over for the perfect salad to bring to a party and this one was right at the top of the page!  Anyway, this was a wonderful salad that everyone loved.  I added yellow and orange peppers for even more color and it was so beautiful.  It really is a meal in it self too.  Great!

Thank you for this unusual salad recipe.  I made it for company and everyone loved it.  Since then I have experimented by using romaine instead of spinach, and slices of granny smith apples or slices of pears instead of the cranberries.  Equally delicious!  Thanks, Fritzie

This salad is just delicious.  It was a big hit at our last dinner party.  I added a bit more jam because it seemed too oily, and it was just excellent.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made the salad for a 4th of July block party and it was one of the few foods wiped out by the crowd.  My family loved it so much, I'm making it again tonite. (July 5th!!!)

I modified the recipe a bit by adding Gorgonzola cheese instead of blue, carmelized the walnuts awesome if you have the extra time), and skipped the avocado.

Thanks again...jjcorney

Yummy, and so colorful!  I subbed olive oil for the walnut oil, because that's what I had.  While the dressing was very good, I'll just use our regular raspberry vinaigrette next time.  I'll probably add some chopped apple to give it some more crunch, also.  Thanks for a great recipe, Tiffany!

All I have to say is "WOW! Wow! WOWW!" So good! I followed the recipe almost exactly as stated, though I did use olive oil instead of walnut oil, and used feta cheese instead of bleu cheese (it was all I had in the fridge). Incredible combination of flavors, and the dressing was simple to make, but delicious. The hubby had 3 helpings, and plans to take the leftovers with him for lunch tomorrow. :) Can't wait to make this again!

Made this today to go with Christmas dinner.  Loved it.  Used feta instead of blue cheese, and candied walnuts instead of roasted walnuts.  Dressing was perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

I used a mesclun mix instead of the spinach; did not put in avacado as it gets slimy for a potluck. and did use Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing as I like the sweetness of it. LOVE the red onion in this salad! Great recipe to play with!

Awesome salad!  Here are my substitutions: pistachio nuts (instead of walnuts, and no need to toast!), gorgonzola cheese (instead of bleu), no tomatoes or ovacado (weird), shallots (instead of red onion), and DEFINITELY add either fresh sliced strawberries or fresh raspberries!  Yummmmmmmmm!  Be sure to add the dressing just before serving though, as it goes soggy fairly quickly.  This is NOT a good leftover salad if the dressing has been poured onto it!  Of course, we tend to not have too much of this left over!

Delicious and loved wherever I bring it. I don't like walnuts but pecans (especially if you want to candy them), pine nuts or toasted almonds work well. Green onions are also good if you don't have a red one on hand.  I only use half the dressing because I don't like too much and use the other half next salad (or make 1/2 recipe).

I used romaine lettuce, added some granny smith apple, substituted shallot, added chopped chicken and served with naan bread for a complete delicious dinner. I added 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tspn Dijon mustard and a dash or two of dried oregano to the dressing.  Wow!

Great recipe that's easy to customize for personal tastes. I've made this several times now, and it feels fancy but it's easy to make. My only word of caution is that the walnut oil is fairly expensive. Good thing you only need a little bit each time.

This was so delicious.  So many wonderful flavors blending together.  I did not have the walnut oil but substituted canola and still extremely tasty!!  My mother said it was the best salad she had ever had.  High praise!

This recipe is really good! It called for a lot of bleu cheese, so I cut the amount in half.

Was not crazy about this salad.  Liked all the ingredients; in fact, thought they went well together.  However, the dressing was entirely too sweet.

Excellent salad and so pretty too! I didn't have time to brown the walnuts so I skipped that step and I didn't have walnut oil so I used olive oil instead.  Other than those two changes, I stuck with the recipe.  I normally don't care for blue cheese but it is excellent in this dish.  I enjoyed every bite of this. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I used mixed greens instead of spinach and pecans instead of walnuts since I am not a walnut person.  I did substitute olive oil instead of the walnut oil also.  I don't like blue cheese too much because of how strong it is, so I used a milder gorgonzola which was perfect.  I also added capers.  The salad was a hit!

I picked this salad after my mom asked me to make one for her Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! I used mixed greens and olive oil instead of spinach and walnut oil. I also added 1-2 tbsp red wine vinegar for a more vinegar taste. I made this two hours before the dinner so the salad was a little wet. Next time, I will use cherry tomatoes (cut in half) instead of chopped tomatoes.

This was good, but I've had many spinach salads that I've liked better, so I've just given this a three-star rating. I like a more flavorful dressing and a higher proportion of blue cheese.

This salad is uber tasty! I didn't have walnut oil, so used EVOO instead and still turned out great! It was a huge hit at the party we attended. The dressing is perfect. I did wait til the last minute to add all of the ingredients together. I will definitely be making this one again and again!

This salad was the star of my dinner, and the other items were good too.    I used feta instead of blue cheese and sprinkled with mixed cheeses but otherwise followed the recipe.  The dressing is AMAZING - simple and DELICIOUS!    Have already had requests to make this again.

Made this for a big family barbecue - the salad bowl was empty by the time dinner was over.  I too, used olive oil and balsamic vinegar but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. A definite keeper! Thanks!

Really a nice fresh, crisp salad...only thing I changed was the cheese,...used a sharp cheddar instead of the bleu (don't care for) ,I also added 1 Med-size red apple (like Courtland) and cut that into chunks...goes real well with the rest of the salad

I was expecting great things from this salad with all the positive reviews, but it really didn't do anything for me. I didn't have avocado and my husband hates cranberries so I left those out, and also added some cucumber. The salad itself was fine, especially the roasted walnuts, but I did not like the dressing at all. Maybe it was the jam I used. My husband said he liked it but I think he just didn't want to make me feel bad :)

Just what I was needed. This salad is exquisite. I wish I had more spinach so I could make it again! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy salad.  Can use these ingredients with most any greens.  I've used the dressing often.

Amazing, healthy recipe!  I read some of the other reviews to get ideas on how this salad could be improved.  Avacados were not really in season, so I used one avacado (small), and 1/2 of a Granny Smith apple.  I also was fortunate to have Trader Joe's Sweet & Spicy Pecans kicking around, which took out the 'toasting' aspect of the walnuts.  The red onion can be a bit overpowering, even though the recipe calls for only using 1/2.  I'll do 1/3 of a red onion next time.  Finally, I didn't end up using all the dressing as I don't like an overly-dressed salad, and I added the blue cheese on top of the salad instead of mixing it in with the rest of the ingredients for fear of the cheese getting really sticky.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Fabulous salad.  The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of walnut oil, but I used much less.  Add 1 T at a time.  It is just too oily with 1/3 C of olive oil.

My husband loves this salad.  I leave out the avacado because they don't really go and they are hard to come by here.  I gave it a 3 star because I find this to be sooooo sweet, too sweet.  I eat it but I have to say I don't really like it but my as I said my husband loves it.

wonderful dressing. i had to make it w/ strawbery jelly (all i had at the time) and it was really good. i know it would be fabulous w/ the jam called for. i add about 1/4 tsp. of salt which makes it both sweet and savory.

This is great! I used canided walnuts and pecans the second time.  I make those with a egg beaten then placed in a zip lock then I add 1 1/2 cup of nuts coat with egg then mix sugar and cinnimon 3/4 sugar cinnimon use as desired.  bake at 200 for 1.5 hours and the best for this salad.  I also used avocados and omitted the tomato...

My guests liked it. Next time I will skip the avocado, use cherry tomatoes, and use less berries. There was too much going on. It was good and different, but there are better out there- for us anyway.

I have become addicted to this salad.  I don't use the avocado and I often use just Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette but the other flavors are something special. I keep a supply of walnuts and dried cranberry on hand now.

This is the one of BEST salads I have ever had. I have passed this on to so many friends (since they all begged for the recipe)and everyone agreed just a wonderful mix of textures, flavors, combined into such of tasty, yummy salad. I have served alone many times as a light lunch or dinner salad. The best!

Pretty good. i thought this was very tasty, but the avocado added nothing, and the tomato seemed to get in the way. i would probably leave those out the next time. i did leave out onions, since i am not a big fan, but perhaps i will try that next time. i loved the combination of blue cheese, spinach, walnuts, and cranberries, with the raspberry vinagrette---i used "CRAISINS". the vinaigrette was very good.

I made this for 32 people and served one bleu cheese version and one without it.  They were both gone in a flash and got rave reviews.  Great flavors and quick to make.  I subbed romaine and field mix for the spinach and used grape tomatoes for ease.

I thought this was a great salad to serve for company. I thought the dressing was a little tart for our taste so I added some sugar. Used olive oil in place of walnut and this makes the dressing a little on the thick side.

Everyone loved it!  Used dried cherries instead of cranberries and feta instead of blue cheese.. Olive oil and apple cider vinegar instead of red wine.  Will make often!!  (Someone else mentioned adding bacon- I definetly will have to try that!)

This was a huge hit at the party I served it at, I should have made double the amount that I did. I'm not a huge fan of raw onions so I wilted them a bit before adding them and used pecans and gorgonzola instead of walnuts and blue cheese. But either way this would be fantastic. The dressing is perfect, just the right balance of acidity and sweetness. Will surely make this again.

Enjoyed the salad, but used 1/2 romaine and 1/2 spinach, added mini fall colored tomatoes instead of sliced tomatoes, a thinly sliced Granny Smith apple, candied pecans instead of the walnuts and used 1/2 goat and 1/2 blue cheeses. This was beautiful and wonderful. The dressing was absolutely TERRIBLE.  It had so much oil, that we had to drain off as much as we could. Then, DOUBLED all other ingredients. Still not great, so stirred in 2 T of fig preserves I had on hand. MUCH better, but still glad I'd also made my favorite balsamic dressing and served both on the side.no drizzling.

This is a lovely, wonderful salad.  The ingredients are extremely flexible (pecans vs. walnuts, feta vs. blue cheese, etc.).  The flavor of any one ingredient is not overpowering.  It's the textures that make it divine.  Fantastic recipe.  Thank you!

I didn't make the dressing; used a store bought dressing, added the avocado last with some lemon over it so it wouldn't turn brown and used a package of dried cranberries, blueberries and cherries! Very good for a dinner meal when it's so hot outside!

My new favorite salad hands down!  I used blue brie and chose to use whole grape tomatoes because I was making it to have over the next few days,  I think the sweetness was a bonus. The dressing was simple and yet so delicious with these ingredients. Will make again!!!

This is our favorite salad. The walnut oil really makes a difference in the flavor of the dressing. The only thing in don't put in is the cranberries. And I mix some spring mix greens with the spinach. Yummy!!

SOOO good!!! Even my salad hating bro-in-laws loved this!!! I can't believe I almost forgot to review this wonderful salad (tisk, tisk). I made this for both Christmas Eve and Christmas day dinner. Everyone who tried this couldn't believe how tasty it was. Admittedly, I did make one significant change that I believe MADE this. I added a 1/2 lb. of crumbled bacon to each salad. Because I was making this for a special occasion, I splurged for walnut oil. A local store sells flavored balsamics and EVOO's and their roasted walnut oil is TO DIE FOR!!! Other than adding bacon, my only other (minor) changes were tossing my avocado with a little lemon juice (to prevent browning), slicing my onion VERY thin (with a mandoline) and toasting my walnuts on the stovetop rather than in the oven (personal preference). If you are looking for a delicious, company worthy salad to serve at your next gathering, look no farther. This fits the bill perfectly! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tiffany! :-)

Very filling. I added some Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic Chicken, and used feta instead of bleu cheese, and dried sour cherries instead of cranberries. Yum! A meal on its own.

Awesome salad!  I was looking for a way to use up a big Costco container of blue cheese, and this fit the bill.  I used spring mix instead of baby spinach, and the result was delicious.

I found this through the ingredient search because I had half an avocado to use up and happened to have some blue cheese as well. Delicious. Subbed olive oil for walnut oil and apricot jam for raspberry. Also had to leave out the craisins because I was out. Still turned out great. Served with balsamic chicken, roasted potatoes, and steamed asparagus.

EXCELLENT, AMAZING!!! Wow, this is one of the best salads I have ever tasted. I substituted pecans for almonds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We brought this salad to my in-laws for Easter dinner. My father-in-law called it "excellent," which is something that rarely comes out of his mouth. This is the tastiest new recipe I've made in a really long time.

Soooo good. It gets requested for every family gathering. Left out the onions, halved the dressing (but used extra jam), and used feta instead of blue cheese. It's pretty darn good if you add in green apples. Heaven!

Very tasty salad. I used sweetened pecans as well, and store-bought raspberry vinaigrette because I got lazy, although I'd like to make the handmade type in the recipe. I plan to make many more spinach salads because of this recipe, and will try other ingredients with it too.

This was okay- I was looking for a way to use a ripe avocado (because I love them so much) and decided to give this a whirl- my complaint is that the dressing completely kills the avocado flavor. I think I would have preferred a creamier dressing with this.  Not bad, just not a 5 star for me. Sorry! :(

Fantastic!  Used entire 7oz box of baby spinach, upped the blue cheese to 5 oz (whole container), left out the walnuts and subbed EVOO for walnut oil (due to allergy), upped raspberry preserves and vinegar because dressing seemed a bit oily.  Very filling.  Dinner for 2 hungry adults with leftovers for lunch.

Love this dressing, everyone we've served it to loves it & can't believe what's in it. I substitute feta for the blue cheese, and skip the tomato, as it becomes too wet. A definate keeper.

Didn't have avocado, but it was still very very good! I already have ingredients to make it again.

I made it according to directions. The dressing was wonderful. I did find the onion to be a bit overpowering. I might omit it or put less in next time. My husband loved it!

This was so good and so easy! I added sliced fresh strawberries and since I can't get my kids to touch anything that contains bleu cheese, I omitted that, but had gorgonzola crumbles on the side. This salad is delicious, and totally upstaged my main course! I'll be making this often! Thanks for sharing!

I love this salad.  I used olive oil instead of buying walnut and it was still fantastic!

this was awesome!  a friend gave me some walnut oil, i had no idea what to do with it.  so i searched by ingredient and found this.  i will definitely make again, so pretty and healthy!  a lot of GOOD fats!  i like the idea of adding some chicken to make it a main dish salad.  it is very hearty.  thanks for posting this.

Love it! I made this salad on our Thanksgiving and Chrismas days. Everyone said it was so good; my husband loves the dressing...yummy and refreshing.  I will make it again on our Baby First Birthday.

amazing salad!  it's not usually the case that the salad goes quicker than the lasagne in my house.  i used 2/3 bag of salad-ready spinach but there was certainly enough dressing for the entire bag.  delish!  in a pinch, a bottled raspberry vinagrette would certainly be just as good - it is the combo of all the other nuggets that make it so great.  and yes, the avocado definitely has its place in this salad!

I used jam without seeds (I'm not sure what the seeds would have added) and used feta cheese.  I also skipped the walnuts because I like them best in salads when they have been toasted, and I had no time for that.  I will add them next time.  This was a great salad; both tasty and attractive!

This recipe is perfect! ^-^ 
You have to use walnut oil though, don't try to substitute.  I had to use baby greens because of an outbreak of ecoli in spinach but it turned out delicious!

I made this for my family and they fell in love with it. In fact I've made it twice in the last three days! I did sub pecans for the walnuts and olive oil for walnut oil. It was WONDERFUL!! It reminds me of a salad I make which we add smoked turkey breast from the deli, then it becomes and entree. Thank you Tiffany

Absolutely fantastic!  I used olive oil.  I used reduced fat feta cheese instead of bleu cheese.  Also I didn't have any raspberry jam, so I used strawberry instead, it was SO good. I used mixed greens instead of spinach, because that's what I had.  The dressing, the walnuts, onions, cheese, cranberries, it all mixed so well together with wonderful flavors and textures, I made one salad for myself and I could have eaten two!

Excellent green salad for a holiday meal.  I subbed garlic-herb feta for the blue cheese and pinenuts for the walnuts - just personal.  Will serve this often!

This was a huge hit! The dressing came out AMAZING! Instead of walnut oil i used sesame oil because it was all I had. For the salad, I forgot the bleu cheese and I doubled the avocado. My boyfriend and I finished ALL the leftovers THAT NIGHT while watching TV. I will make this as often as possible!

This salad tastes great, even without the avocado. The best part about this dish is the mixture and range of textures. Be careful not to add too much red onion, though.

Delicious. I thought this would be like any other spinach, fruit and nut salad but NO! Left out the avocado. Used mixed berry preserves and walnut oil for the dressing. I think the walnut oil adds something to the salad. Will make this many times.

This was an amazing recipe.  Made it for Thanksgiving and could barely get to the turkey!  I used Girard's Raspberry Dressing instead of making the dressing from scratch.  Rave reviews from everyone on this salad.  Thanks!

This was really delicious.  I also used olive oil, rather than walnut oil, and it was very tasty.  My husband said that the cranberries were too sweet for him, so I'll probably leave them out next time.  I look forward to making this in the summer!

This was a huge hit for our Thanksgiving dinner - it even sidelined the turkey!  I know it will become a tradition in our family.  Thanks so much for submitting and sharing it Tiffany.

Everyone loved this!  My husband doesn't like raw onions so I skipped those.  I also didn't have the raspberry jam or walnut oil so I skipped those, along with the red wine vinegar, and used a homestyle vinaigrette dressing I had instead.  I halved cherry tomatoes and used those instead of 2 larger tomatoes.

Love this salad and like another reviewer mentioned, you can substitute things (and I did.)  I used spring mix instead of spinach, pecans instead of walnuts, olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead of walnut oil and red wine vinegar.  Also, left out the tomatoes and added a sliced bosc  pear.  Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  The dressing is amazing! This one is definitely a keeper.

I followed the salad recipe and added pomegranate seeds, cucumber and orange bell pepper.  I did not make the dressing called for in the recipe.  I made a maple balsamic instead as I'm partial to that.  I brought it for a Thanksgiving pot luck at work and it was a hit.  I will definitely be making this again.

A nice salad, but the picture obviously has apples and cherry tomatoes in it, which aren't in the recipe.  I'd prefer a bit more accuracy.

Very good recipe as is, but I have found some substitutions that work if I don't have all the ingredients on hand: olive oil instead of walnut oil, pecans instead of walnuts and gorgonzola instead of blue cheese. I also prefer seedless raspberry jam.

Honestly I was just looking for a salad that contained spinach and avocado. So I used this as inspiration. I omited the blue cheese and walnuts and tomatoes. I used mozza cheese and grated carrot and salted sunflower seeds and toasted sesame seeds. For the dressing I didn't have walnut oil so or red wine vinegar or even red wine so I used olive oil and sesame seed oil. Then I used balsamic and white vinegar. I found it strong tasting so  possibly I used too much sesame seed oil as it was not the balsamic so I just added a TBs of honey and in the end it was very delicious! 3 stars because I changed it so much. Thanks for the inspiration though!

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was a winner! The avocado gave the salad a nice creamy texture ,  the cranberries the sweetness  while the walnuts gave it the crunch it needed. Everyone loved it! I will be adding this recipe to my favorites.

I just found this salad again - I made this for my family many times last year, but didn't save it.  It's one of the best salads I've ever had, and everyone loved it.  It's fancy enough to feel special but still very easy to make.  Highly recommended!

It turned out fine. I liked it even better the next day. I used some cranberry almond  packaged topping that I found on the produce aisle and it went over well at the Thanksgiving party. I also used olive oil. I mixed bib lettuce with spinach . I really liked the dressing so I am glad some is leftover for my next salad-for-lunch!

OMG... this was AMAZING!!! Trying to be a bit more "Paleo" friendly, I substituted the dried cranberries for chopped apples and I used goat cheese instead of the blue cheese. (I know goat cheese really isn't any more paleo than blue cheese, but I'm also lactose intolerant.)
Best salad I ever made. This is absolutely going in the regular lunch rotation.

Made this today for a dinner tonight and wanted to try it out first.  I read reviews and made some of those changes like no tomatoes, though I'm wondering about that now and may try them the next time.  What I did try was apple and pear in place of tomatoes and candied walnuts and pecans.  I found I liked apple better than pear and I didn't like the candied nuts, they made the salad too sweet.  I went back and toasted some walnuts and I found the apple, toasted walnuts, and dried cranberries (plus the other salad ingredients) were the best combination with the wonderful dressing which has it's own sweetness..  great salad.. a keeper!

I couldn’t find walnut oil so I used flaxseed oil. Bad choice. The dressing was blah but the salad was so delicious and with the avocado and blue cheese it really didn’t need dressing. Everyone went back for seconds. I remade it again with the leftover ingredients the next day. Soooo goood!

SO Yummy!  Bursting with flavor in every bite. I used EVOO instead of the Walnut oil just because it's what I already had in my pantry but will definitely try it with walnut oil another time.

I’ve made this salad a few times and seems each time I make it someone asks for the recipe.  I will make it again.

I used white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and roasted pine nuts instead of walnuts.

Took this "new" salad to a family gathering and everyone loved it. I left out the tomatoes, added chopped apple instead, and used seedless jam otherwise made the recipe just as written. I didn't have any blue cheese or walnut oil on hand so I  used feta and light tasting olive oil instead. I left the dressing separate because I had a ways to travel before the event and also so individuals could add for themselves. It's a lovely looking and tasting salad and my husband's and my new favorite!

Actually, I didn't exactly make it , but used it as a basis for the ingredients I had on hand.  I had green leaf lettuce, tomato,  feta cheese that needed to be used, apple, walnuts, boysenberry jam (seedless), vinegar and olive oil.  Love how it all came together...toasted walnuts fresh outta the freezer were delicious!

Healthy salad and very good. It made sense to add apple and a raspberry vinaigrette is ideal over salad. I can't see changing a thing about the recipe.

One of the very best things I've ever had.   Whoever came up with this recipe is not just a cook or a chef, but a real artist.  This salad is as fortifying and solid as many a meat dish, but carries a savory sweetness along with the vegetable rush that you might crave  in the last months of winter.  A real stunner.  Have it with red wine.

Very good.  I took to a potluck and everyone raved about it.  Left out the tomatoes as I thought tomatoes and cranberries were an odd combo.  Everything else exactly as written, though.  This is a keeper!

I made the salad with mixed greens, dried cranberries, toasted walnuts, feta and apples.  It was very good and the dressing was delicious. I added a little more jam than it called for as I thought it was a little too tart. I will make again.

I made no changes. Everyone loves this salad. But occasionally you find someone who doesn't like bleu cheese. Leave it out or substitute feta, gorgonzola, or something similar. With all the different flavors and textures in this dish it is a treat.

Delicious and healthy salad! It's our favourite. I use seedless jam and hazelnut oil because I love the flavour, but that's the only changes I make. We eat this almost every week with some bbq'd chicken.

This salad was so good! I only left out cranberries bc I don't like them. It was quickly prepped and we ate far more than we intended.   I would double up on avocado next time.

Delicious! One of my recent dinner guests  is allergic to walnuts so I substituted olive for walnut oil and didn't add the walnuts into the salad before serving. Instead, I placed honey roasted pecans in one small dish and the toasted walnuts in another small dish  for my guests to add to their salad as they liked. I tried some of each and both were delicious in the salad!

A perfect fall salad. I had a spicy raspberry jam on hand. I doubled the raspberry and the dressing was wonderful.  I also toasted the walnuts.  Thanks for a fabulous salad recipe.

This is so delicious! I had to use lingonberry jam, but it didn't matter. It's really worth buying good walnut oil and toasting those walnuts.  I could add an extra avocado, but that's it. This is my new favorite salad. Love, love, love!

I give this recipe 4 stars because I did change it.  I was lucky to find some beautiful fresh butter lettuce at the farmers market so used that.  I omitted the red onion as I'm not a raw onion fan.  I didn't toast the nuts as we enjoy the fresh taste during the summer.  The dressing is absolutely delicious!  It made too much for the salad but does keep well in the fridge.

This was great!  I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  I couldn't find walnuts.  I used apricot reserves instead of raspberry jam because I wasn't going to spend the money on that.  I'd rather use something I already had.  I also used Kale instead of Spinach. I love Kale!

Salad is delicious. I halved it and ate the whole thing for lunch - Yum! I didn't have walnut oil or walnuts and subbed lemon infused olive oil and toasted almonds.  Next time I'll also cut the blue cheese in half it was a little strong on the cheese -just my taste. Thanks for the great recipe Tiffany.

My favorite salad. Only because I'm on a diet,
I reduced the oil amount and used vegetable stock. 
Still delicious! I could have this every day.

This was delicious. I'm not an avocado or tomato fan so I eliminated those and I used olive oil instead of walnut oil. Otherwise, prepared as written. It's become a lunch time staple for me. Quick and easy to make and very, very tasty.

I made this for my Christmas buffet table and it was attractive and very good as written. I couldn't find walnut oil so I substituted with olive oil and it was very good. I switched the blue cheese (which we dislike) for cubed feta (served on the side) because sadly our new daughter-in-law hates cheese. I was hoping for a Christmas miracle that the leftovers would be edible but of course they weren't but this is to be expected of a dressed salad.

Not sure why I haven't reviewed this salad before now because I have been making it for years.  I leave out the blue cheese and use olive oil instead of walnut oil, but it is my all time favorite salad.  I am addicted to spinach and this is my favorite way to eat it.  Every time I make it for a crowd, I get tons of compliments.  I also just make the dressing and keep in in my fridge for other uses.  So yummy!

I used what I had on hand: feta instead of blue cheese and mixed pecans and hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and mixed garden greens instead of spinach and it still came out fantastic. Also, as mentioned by another rater, I used the vinaigrette recipe for the strawberry and feta salad listed on here. I think this also added something.

This recipe was a winner at my Thanksgiving dinner, and I was asked for the recipe from a few guests. I did replace the walnut oil with olive oil, as I forgot to buy it.  Perhaps even better with walnut oil? I don't see how though.  five stars in my book.

Proportions are perfect! I prefer to use olive oil over walnut and feta cheese instead of blue. Always receives rave reviews.

This was the perfect blend of ingredients.  I think crumbled bacon would be a nice extra in this salad and may try that next time. I found out Walnut Oil is expensive! I paid about $10 for a bottle and hope to find more ways to use it up.    The dressing is awesome!

This was really good. I love blue cheese but  I had to finish up some feta. Next time I will use the blue cheese because I'm sure that would be even better. The dressing was so good and I love to make my own. I will definitely be making this again!

I used gorgonzola blue cheese and was out of walnuts so used pecans that I sugar-glazed, and the orange-flavored cranberries from Trader Joe's.  Very nice salad, Tiffany.  Thank you!

I love this salad. I have made it for many parties and have had requests for it. I toss it together right before serving. If you leave it set for too long, it will get a little soggy. I don't always add all the dressing at first, If I serve this on a buffet I will save some of the dressing back to add later.

excellent! Great texture and mix of flavors! The walnut oil wasn't readily available, I used a mixture of balsamic and rosmary infused olive oil. I used a bag of dried cranberries mixed with dried cherries. The onion gave it more of a kick. I also omitted the avocado

This salad is excellent. I forgot to put the blue cheese on it and it was still great. I remembered the cheese the next time I made it; still great.

this salad was the best.  I am not a vetern chef...just starting cooking for my family when we purchased a house...well even my mother-in-law raved over the salad...thanks!  (Could not fine walnut oil, so instead I reduced the amount of oil to 1/4 cup and used olive oil.)  My 2 year old loved the dried cranberries!

I rated this low for kids, as knives are required for preparation.  This salad is fabulous!  We didn't use any dressing, but liked the salad as it was.  I think the avacado added enough to the salad.  Lots of flavors and textures.

This salad was a huge hit at two different parties.  At both occasions, I was asked by numerous people to supply them with the recipe.  I did as some others had suggested and used a pre-prepared raspberry dressing instead of making it from scratch.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I had it at a luncheon and had to get the recipe.  Then I made it for Thanksgiving, and my mom had to have the recipe.  I bet I've made this salad at least 6 times and plan on having it again at a dinner party I'm hosting this weekend.  Great and different!

Easy ingredients and easy to put together with GREAT results.  Ingredients in dressing seemed "weird" when putting together, but if prepared ahead of time and left to chill, it is a perfect compliment to the salad.  Thanks!

Everyone at my party loved the salad! They've  never had anything like it before. I'd definitely make this again. (Although I'm not sure if the guys liked it, but all the women did!)

My guests all claimed this is one of the best salads they ever tasted!  I loved it.  I carmalized some walnuts then placed them on top of the salad once it was on each plate.  This extra step was well worth the effort.  This salad is time-consuming, but it's impressive and fabulous tasting.
