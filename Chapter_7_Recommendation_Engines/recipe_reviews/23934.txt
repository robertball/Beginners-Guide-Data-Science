This dip was wonderful. Based on other reviews I changed the following; sauteed my onions first, added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and used a 5 cheese blend (parmesean, asiago, romano, mozzarella and provolone..kraft makes this already shredded). I halved the recipe as I only had a few people over. They raved about it and of course wanted the recipe. I served the dip with vegetables and crackers. I also thought it would be fun to put the dip in a bread bowl. Will probably do that next time. Thanks for a fast,easy recipe!

PHENOMENAL! I cut the recipe to 1/3 (it was served as a late-night snack) and followed the measurements exactly. I put my chopped onion in the food processor and basically pulverized it. I then sauteed it in 1T of melted butter, and lightly salted the onion as it sauteed. Then, since this was a last-minute idea, I ADDED COLD CREAM CHEESE to the onions in the warm pan, and stirred in all the remaining ingredients (the parm was last) over medium low heat until it was smooth. I then baked it, and garnished it with chives. It was served with Sea Salt Bagel Chips from Trader Joe's, and was a hit! This recipe was so, so easy, and so, so delicious. Five stars, any day. This is being added to my personal recipes tonight! Thanks for sharing this one.  :)

This is a really great dip.  I used 2 pkgs of plain cream cheese and 1 pkg of onion & chives. Easy to make and almost any cracker works with this! My ONLY minor complaint, it looks somewhat greasy.  Next time, I'll serve in a hollow bread bowl to soak that up so no one gets turned off by it.  Still, the taste is great!

I changed the recipe a little.  I used 1 8oz brick cream cheese, 1/2 cup mayo, 1 large onion, and 1 cup parmesan cheese.  I served it for Book club and we ate the whole thing!  It was delicious!

The other night, I had an "onion souffle" dip that a friend made.  I emailed her to get the recipe but didn't hear back from her and wanted to make it tonight.  I was sure it had onions, cream cheese, and mayonnaise in it along with parmesan or romano cheese.  I looked for recipes with those ingredients, and this looked perfect.  I reduced the ingredients (only 4 of us eating it) and was very happy with it.  I think I would prefer to saute the onions before baking it next time.  I'll have to try and see.  But it was a hit, even with my son, who HATES onions! (I didn't tell him onions were in it, either.)  

This was fast, easy, and very good.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the best dip on the planet.  I am asked to make this everywhere I go..Thanksgiving, Christmas for sure.  One tip that is very important and makes a HUGE difference, make it a few days before, or at least one day.  It helps soften the onions and dramatically helps the flavor.  Refrig after making and then sit it out about 30 min. before baking.   This is a keeper! OH...and I add a dash or two of tabasco...

Wow!  This was delicious.  I served as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Everyone was raving about it.  I'll be making this again and again and again.  Used 2 blocks of cream cheese, and 1 medium sweet onion.  I sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs and paprika for a pretty presentation.  Outstanding!

Thanks for a great recipe! I baked it in individual ramekins (I had to broil it a minute at the end to brown it), and it was a great hit! Great with melba toast.

This was good and several people at the party said so.  I won't give it "5 stars" because I reserve that for fantastic recipes.  I will make this again, though, because it seemed to appeal to a large number of people.  To my taste, it is a bit on the plain side.  Also, it tastes best when warm and seems to cool off fast once out of the oven.  Maybe try a mini crockpot next time?

Like some reviewers, I thought that 3 blocks of cream cheese was a bit much, so I resolved this dilemma with the addition of a purple onion. Also added 6 garlic cloves and carmelized both onions and garlic with pepper flakes, lemon pepper and garlic powder.  This gave the dish a sweet/savory quality. For more of a kick, I susbstituted, Kraft's Creamy Horseradish Sauce for the mayo.  Also added more pepper flakes.  The dip was a huge hit with guests and many asked for the recipe.  I'm so popular!

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it numerous times before I ran across it on "allrecipes", but I usually use a 16 oz. bag of frozen chopped onions that are thawed and drained in place of the raw onion. Works well with corn chips!

This has become my signature recipe at parties.  Everyone loves it -- even those who don't like onion.  Make sure to use FRESHLY grated parm.  The canned (even the stuff in the bag) has an anti-caking product that makes the final product kind of mealy.  
Can't say that I've ever had leftovers either.  We usually serve it with sliced baguette and fresh veggies.  YUM!

Took this to a tailgate party (kept warm in a fondue pot) and it was a BIG hit, even with the anti-onion people.  Good with Ritz crackers, bread, etc.

Easily modified this recipe to be a little lower in fat.  The best part – it didn’t effect the taste AT ALL.  We used low-fat cream cheese & reduced fat mayo.  We also sauteed the onions (in cooking spray) prior to baking.  Huge hit!

This is always a hit at work functions!  I made a few changes, though.  First, I sauteed the onions with some garlic before baking this.  Secondly, I add in about 8 ounces of shredded Swiss cheese.  I should also note that I used fresh Parmesan cheese, not the non-refrigerated kind that comes on the shelf. My chip of choice is Frito Scoops!  Definitely a keeper!

I use this dip as an "old stand by" when ever we have people over or when asked to bring something to a pot luck. I have made it many many times and I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe.  When I first found this recipe I was a bit leary of the onions (my dh hates them) but he loves this dip.  I usually ad 1/2 cup swiss cheese - it just gives it that extra something that seems to be missing.

A friend of mine gave me this recipe a few years ago, and it is STILL a family favorite, and an excellent dish for a party or any social gathering. The recipe I was given calls for pre-packaged frozen onions (thawed and well drained) as others here have menitioned, and I have never ever known this recipe to be greasy or oily as some have described. Perhaps that's an "after-affect" when the onions are precooked? In any event, this has always been a no-fail favorite of ours, (and even a few over the years who claim they don't like onions!) I'd give this recipe more than five starts if I could!

I was given this recipe by an old friend a few years ago, and I've had to pass the recipe on to many other friends.  Mine has a couple of very minor changes that might make a difference to those who didn't love the one posted here.  My recipe calls for shredded parmesan which melts nicely.  Mine also calls for 12-16 ounces of frozen chopped onions.  I give my onions a couple of extra spins in the food processor before mixing in with the other ingredients.  I also use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light mayo.  I always serve with a bag of Frito scoops --the really big Fritos for dipping.  It's fantastic!

This was a big Christmas hit...the men in my family loved it.  My sister hid a portion of it for herself.  

I sautéed  2 onions, used 1 block of cream cheese, ½ cup of mayo and one cup of cheese.

I actually found this to be bland.  I prefer the version of this dip with the Knorr's veggie soup mix.  I usually agree with the high rated recipes but not quite this time. :(

Always a hit.  I forgot to grease the pan and it really doesn"t need it.  I think this would make a great artichoke dip too.  i would leave it the same and just add artichokss.

I've been making this recipe for years and am often asked for the recipe.  The only difference in how I've made mine is that I use a bag of frozen onions instead of the fresh onion.  Another tip is to lightly microwave the cream cheese for easier mixing before stirring in the other ingredients.

i follow this recipe to the t...although sometimes i do use an italian cheese blend. I get RAVE reviews everytime I make it. I bake it in the pampered chef mini baker stoneware...its great because it keeps it warm longer! This dip is soooooooooooooo good and so easy to make!  everyone ate this with chips and veggies and I even saw some people putting it on their tacos...very versatile!

Excellent! Easy to make and everyone loved it. I halved the recipe, since we weren't that many and added some garlic cloves, as suggested by others. I also used light cream cheese.
I served with crackers and some vegetables and it was gobbled up quickly. I will definitely keep this one on hand and make it again soon.

This is the best dip to serve for a large number of people!  I have tasted it using frozen onions and is not nearly as good as a fresh onion.

I've made this many times because it's always a winner. I prefer sour cream instead of the mayo. One time I had Vidalia onions and it was the best, but can't always get those. I also love to serve this in a sourdough bread bowl. Great, easy recipe.

I too sauteed my onions first, sprinkling on some salt and cayenne.  Instead of the full amount of parmesan cheese I did a parm/mozza mix.  A nice dip that went well with crackers and chips.

Excellent, simple, so tasty!
I would bake this in a thin layer because the top gets crispy in the oven and thats the best part!
I also think you could substitute the onions with many different things to change this up a bit.

As it is, its an excellent dip! I will make this again.

Was struggling w/what to bring for snack day at work, wanted something different, this was simple to make, few ingredients and tasted good. Sauted the onions in a little margarine first with minced garlic, used an italian 5 cheese blend instead of all Parmesan. Baked then transferred to a crock pot. I did have to skim the oil off, it was pretty greasy, probably a combination of the mayo and margarine.  Will be making again, thanks for the recipe!

Yumm! I just made this for the superbowl and can't stop "tasting" it. I made a few slight changes. I cooked the whole thing in a large skillet. I pulverized the onion in the food processor and cooked it over 1 tbsp of olive oil. I added some smoked sweet pepper flakes and cajun seasoning. Then added the cream cheese, and 1.5 cups parmesan and 1/2 cup of shredded mozz, then mayo. I also threw in some chives to give some color. I topped with shredded mozz and will bake right before the game. I already know everyone will love this. Great recipe, thanks!!

I made this for something different today for my husband and I. I added a couple handfuls of sharp cheddar, a little Frank's, and a little garlic powder. Super good. I'd make this again, for sure. We ate it with Stacy's Pita Chips.

I served it for super bowl, and it was definitely a crowd pleaser. I used 2 cream cheeses, kept all other ingredients the same, baked it in a bread bowl, and sprinkled some cheesy crunchy onions on the top toward the end of the bake time.

I've been making this dish for about two years now and I keep meaning to add my comments!  YUMMM! This is always a hit and is a regular request with family and friends.  The only thing I add is some minced garlic to give the dip a little more depth, but it is fantastic!! Thanks Tracie!

I think next time I'll try frying the onions first. That way they are softer. I didn't really like the way they came out.

This was just great.  And it makes A LOT!!!!  But that's okay, because it freezes fine and re-heats fine.  I've gotten nothing but compliments the 3 times I've served it and see no reason to change anything about it.  Well, I did sprinkle some garlic powder in there, but otherwise, it's good to go.

Of all the appetizers and dips I made for my daughters' birthday party, this was my favorite! Because I had so many appetizers, I only used one package of cream cheese, almost a whole large onion and a heaping tablespoon of a dried garlic and herb seasoning. We love onion and garlic and thought this was super. Good job Tracie!

I needed something easy to make for a party and decided to try this recipe.  However I added 1 packet of Onion Soup Mix and used sour cream instead of mayo.  Everyone at the party liked it and were asking how I made it.  Will definitely add to my party-recipe arsenal!

Delicious! The only thing I did was added a pack of Lipton Onion and a packet of Herb Garlic. It was good even even after it got cold.  Can't wait to make another batch.

Made this for New Year's 2012!  Very similar to a recipe that we used to toast on party sized rye breads.  This goes very well with dark, dense breads to spread on...  We used a sweet wheat & oat bread from a local bakery.  Love, Love, Love!
Update:  Also good with crackers, veggies to dip with, and homemade baguettes sliced thin!

This is a great dip. I added a package of real bacon bits to it and it was even better.  Also great served with thick potato chips.

Very easy and very good. Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, gone in a matter of minutes. I only used 2 packages of cream cheese and that was plenty in my opinion. Great recipe, thanks!!

i thought this was pretty good, I made a large batch for a wedding, and people kept taking big sccops because they thought it was a potato dish! I served it with toasted mini baguette rounds and crackers. I will make this again.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit.  I wasn't a big fan of it though, I thought it was a little too oniony.  It was definatly easy to make though!

My family really enjoyed this and it will be my signature dish for sharing from now on. I used 2 onions and 1 pkg of 8 oz cream cheese, so it was more of an onion dip and it was delicious!!!!

This was nothing special.  I followed the recipe exactly and used lite mayo to help with the greasiness.  It was still VERY greasy.  It's not very appetizing to serve a dip that has grease floating around in it.  It became a joke at my gathering.  The flavor was okay, but after a couple tries, I threw it out.  There are much better dip recipes out there! Sorry.

Wow! Everyone went crazy over this and I had person after person asking me for this recipe. I reduced the amount of cream cheese down to 2 8oz. packages, I used 2 cups of shredded Italian cheese mixture, I also sprinkled in 1 tsp. of onion powder. The most important thing is to saute the onion in 2-3 tablespoons of butte for 10-15 minutes. So delicious. I serve with a toasted french bagette bread.

We loved this.  I went with 2 packages of cream cheese and one medium onion.  I also added a handful of fresh parsley.  I stuck the whole thing in the food processor and it worked great.  The rest was the same.  We even added leftovers to our mashed potatoes at dinner.

This recipe is my favorite hot dip ever!  It is always the first thing gone at parties. I made it at least six times already. I also use 2 cream cheeses & 1 onion&chive cream cheese spread which gives it more onion flavor.  I bake it in the oven then transfer it to a crockpot to keep it hot all night.

This is just OK.  Very greasy after being baked.  Very bland.  No real flavor except onion.  Almost needs some red pepper flakes, green onion tops, something.  I dont know.  Just OK.  Decent tasting with pita chips.

Fabulous -- as others have noted, the first dip to go at the super bowl party!.  The only changes I made, reduced the amount by a third (though I still used a whole onion and added two shallots and 2 cloves of garlic) and I sauted the onions, shallots and garlic in olive oil for about 5 minutes before I mixed everything together.  Super simple and delicious!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  It's simple and the ingredients are those you probably have on hand so it's great for when you need something at the last minute.  I followed earlier suggestions and added about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  I took it to a party and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for a great recipe!  PS - Half the recipe works perfect in a pie plate.  Cut down on cooking time.

After reading all the great reviews, I was really excited about trying this!  I don't know what happened.  I followed the instructions to a tee, but when I took the dip out of the oven, all of this oil was sitting on top.  I'm not sure if it was from the mayo but I used light mayo.  Very oily & greasy.  Yuck.

Not bad, but not great.  A little on the bland side.  It's a great start to somthing that would be really good if you tweak the recipe right.  If I make again I will add some minced garlic and some black pepper...I think it would do this justice.

This dip was excellent as written, but for a subsequent batch I added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts I found in the pantry.  It made this dip!!!  My guests could not stop raving.  Thanks, Tracie!!

This was absolutely fantastic! For a twist, I added a pinch of salt and one clove of garlic. That really set it off very nicely and counterbalanced against the sweetness of the onion. This is such a beautiful and versatile snack!

Amazing DIP & huge hit at a recent party we attended! Simple to prepare, home smelled so good while it was baking and had to “promise” to give other party go-ers the recipe A keeper for sure!!!

This is delicious. I cut the recipe in half and instead of using cream cheese, I used 2% cottage cheese that I put in the food processor , processing until smooth. Everything else remained the same. It's a great dip but can also be used on pasta.

This onion dip was good. It turned out flavorful, and it browned nicely. I did add artichoke hearts, which I think made it yummier. Next time I think I would saute the onions to develop the flavor a little differently.

This is the best thing ever!! So easy to make and everyone is obsessed with it! I do add some minced garlic because who doesn’t love garlic. I have also made it in my crockpot. Low for a few hours and it’s perfect! Not as great as when baked in the oven but when I bring it to functions where no oven is available it’s still just as good!

Made it as the recipe detailed but cut the servings down for 2 people. It ended up separating. Had decent flavor. Likely will try it again.

Will definitely make again!!! 
Only did 1/3 of the recipe as it was huge and I was already making 2 other dips, but added: 
1/2 cup sourcream 
1/4 Cup green onion (for colour and because I had some on hand from another recipe) 
1 jalapeño chopped (removed pith) 
It was lovely

Disappointed since it had pretty good reviews.  Luckily, I cut it down to 16 servings.  It was much to "solid" of a dip.  It needed to be thinned out with something.  Though the onion flavor was good.  Will definitely not make again..

Really liked this, but I did modify it into a French Onion Soup Dip.

Instead of one onion, I used 4 onions and caramelized them beforehand. While caramelizing, I used half a can of beef broth(poured over time while they were cooking down).

Gave it that something extra.

It was good because it was hot, but it was kind of boring. Next time I make it, I’ll jazz it up with hot sauce.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  The only changes I made was using 1.5 cups of parmesan-romano instead of 2 cups parmesan. I also sprinkled in some garlic powder. I did NOT sauce the onions ahead of time.  It just seemed like one extra step and I was short on time.  Fortunately, the onions cooked pretty well in the oven and were soft.  This recipe was good.  Everyone at the party enjoyed it and there were barely any leftovers.  I plan on making this again next week for a Christmas party.  That being said, I do not feel that this dish was all that memorable or special.

Delish!   I must confess I caramelize the onions first and it was amazing.  I only gave it four stars because it did tend to congeal a bit too much for my liking.  I think that the next time I make it I will try to thin it out.

This has been one of my go-to recipes to bring to parties for years. I've never come across anyone who didn't instantly love it and want the recipe! This includes people who swear they won't eat anything with onions. 
Recently I've been substituting 2 cups of shredded 5 cheese packages (mozzarella, Parmesan, etc) I enjoy it even more than the original which I didn't think was possible! I serve it with Town House Tuscan Cheese Focaccia crackers. AMAZING!

Fabulous! Hubs & I had friends over. Cocktail hour came and I had this dip ready -- popped it in the oven.  Everyone raved about it -- even my picky guys. I cut down the proportions (small crowd) to 1 package Cream Cheese, 1 C Parmesan cheese, 1/4 Cup Mayo and 1/2 onion. I did not precook the onion, nor did I add anything else. For a different presentation, I served it with toasted bread rounds (coat lightly with EVOO, and sprinkle with garlic powder -- bake til crispy).

I love this dip,  it's usually something a little different, that a lot of people haven't heard of yet, usually liked by most, so it's a good dish to bring along to a potluck finger food kind of party.The Parmesan cheese, since it's a harder cheese doesn't completely melt away so it provides it another texture. I've also used fresh or the frozen diced onions and both are good, I just put the frozen onions between a couple of layers of paper towel to soak the water out from being frozen (I don't like chopping but have purchased a food chopper since last time I made it). I eat and serve mine with Frito Scoops, YUM!!! :-)

Enjoy and let everyone tell you what a great cook you are! One more idea I'd like to share that friends and family seem to like, whether I'm taking one  dish to a party or hosting the shin dig, I'll write my recipe(s) on an index card, provide blank cards and have a few pens laying around so if someone wants the recipe they can jot it down on a blank card to put in their own recipe box when they get home!!

This was a well-received snack at Christmas. We liked it because it was different than the typical warm dips that are served for our afternoon snack. I changed the servings to 16 and followed the measurements exactly, but used an Italian cheese blend and stirred the cream cheese into the warm onions I sautéed. I was pleasantly surprised that the onions weren't a stronger flavor. Will be making it again!

I made this as written.  I used a sweet onion (not strong) and I served with salted tortilla chips.  I could have eaten this all myself!!  and so easy to make!!  Make sure the cream cheese is softened so the ingredients  mix together well.

I have been making this for years and everyone loves it!  There is absolutely no need to saute the onion first.  I think I add twice the cream cheese and twice the mayonnaise that what this recipe calls for.  You won't be disappointed!!

Delicious, easy to make, very flavorful dip!  I used Vidalia onion and parmesan reggianno for extra bold flavor.  I also added cut chives on top after cooking.  Served with whole grain baguette and Ritz crackers.  Would definitely make again!

Ummmmm, yum!  I did make a couple of mods though: I first cooked the onions in some olive oil with garlic powder until they started to carmelize and used half sour cream and half mayo. I also used Pecorino Romano cheese.  Really decadent appetizer and a hit!

Everyone really enjoyed this. I made it as is but felt it was capable of more flavor. Second time I saute the onions and added some garlic. I also exchanged only parm cheese for 2 cups  Italian blend cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really easy to make and just as easily modified to suit individual tastes. I caramelized the onions first because we prefer the flavor, but left everything else the same. One would have to try really hard to mess this up...it's so incredibly easy and tasty!

Not as wonderful as I thought it would be....kinda bland.  Made a ton of dip also.  Did work out nice mixed in with casseroles and potatoes though.  Would probably not make again.

Everyone at the football party loved this recipe!  I followed another reviewers advice and sautéed the onions and added red pepper flakes.  I also did a who,e package of 5 white cheese Kraft blend instead of parmesan.  I melted everything together, and put it in a bread bowl, and baked it until browned.  We tried it with different crackers, and oven cooked bread, everyone preferred the oven crisped bread.  Next time I might try adding green and/or red peppers for color.

Really good...simple ingredients always on hand....sauteed the onions with some garlic; used lite cream cheese, a bit of mayo and a bit of sour cream.  Love to try it with some other cheeses next time...Fritos were a bit too strong a flavor to dip with...a milder cracker or pita chip would better let the flavor shine thru.

I have made this dip for numerous parties and get togethers.  It is always praised and I am always asked for the recipe.  It has become my signature pot luck dish and most requested appetizer for family dinners.  So easy to make and serve. I serve it with Townhouse Crackers and within 10 minutes on the table it is completely gone.

I cut the recipe down to 16 servings (basically in 1/3), sauteed the onion until brown before adding, and added 1/2 tsp of jarred minced garlic. Very good. Baked only 20 minutes because of the smaller size.

This recipe is a favorite for my family and any party or get together I bring it to.  My son ate about half of the dip last time I made it.  Yes my son who hates onions.  I originally got this recipe from a dear friend. after reading the reviews I am going to try to saute the onions first before I make it again.  That sounds really good.

This is so YUMMY.  Everyone likes it, and my friends ask me to make it for events.  I have decided to re-name it when I tell people what it is.  The onions scare them, so I'm calling Hot Parmesan Cheese Dip - or something a little less scary! :)

This is such an amazing recipe!!  Everyone who tries it LOVES it.  the only thing I do different is I grate my onion instead of chopping it.  I grate it right into the bowl...it creates such an amazing taste, but not too "oniony".

Glad you've all enjoyed this recipe. It is often called Onion Souffle and served with Corn Chips (Scoops work great.) It is very popular here in the South. Does work best when served very hot or in a mini crockpot.

I have made this dip twice now and both times everyone at my party raved about it.  The recipie posted does make A LOT of dip, but to my surprise almost all of it was gone with just about 10 people!  I made it exactly to the recipie and it turned out great!

Disappointed in this recipe, I don't feel it had great flavor at all as written. The onions should probably be carmelized beforehand, and I think adding garlic and other seasonings would help. It's a lot of cream cheese and parmasean cheese to use up for disappointing results.

Super yummy....Since this is what I had on hand, these are the amounts I used: 1-8oz. cream cheese, 1 sm. onion, 1-2 cup parm cheese, 1/2 c. mayo.  As many suggested, I sauted my finely chopped onion in a tad of butter before adding to rest of ingred.  Was the first thing to go at the buffet table.

i followed clieb's advice for scaling this down and used an 8x8 & mine was done in 25 mins. i also used light cream cheese and light mayo as some of the reviewers complained it was greasy. the hubs and i agreed that it was very good but had almost too mild a flavor. next time i will add 1Tb dry ranch seasoning or garlic powder. i WILL be making this again. so easy and inexpensive to make w/ every day ingredients. i cant believe i have never had this before. great w/ triscuits.

SO easy and SO delicious!  I did alter the recipe by adding only two packages of cream cheese and it tasted great to me.  Three seemed like it would be too much.  I served with Ritz crackers and it was a HIT!

Made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I was going to add some garlic, but forgot and it was great, but I'll try it with some garlic next time.  Great recipe!

Took this to work on night shift, everyone raved. There were some leftovers so I left it in fridge for am shift. Well, sitting in fridge, it got stiff, so they probably didn't know what to do with it so they didn't eat it. I came in the next night, added a little water, heated, stirred till smooth, and the night shift crew raved! LOL Only thing I did different was sauted the onions. We are nurses, so we had to break out the gum, but we loved it!

I have made this receipe several times for parties.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I get got tons of people asking me for the recipe..it is absolutely fabulous and easy to make.  It is always the first appetizer to disappear!  You can make with low fat cream cheese and mayo and it is just as good!

Made 1/3 of the recipe. Sauteed the onions ahead of time, but otherwise made as per the recipe. It was great. My daughter, especially loved it and couldn't stop eating it. Served with bagel and pita chips and baby carrots. Thanks!

I followed this recipe as listed other the adding a cheese blend.  To much onion for my taste.  Not everyone really cared for it either.  Its a good base for something maybe some garlic and some artichoke.  I wont do the onion thing again

This recipe was recommended on teh recipe exchange section of this site.  I sauted the onions as others mentioned and baked it in a bread bowl.  I enjoyed this recipe although I felt it was lacking something.  I'm not sure what though.

This was very good and practically gone at the end of the party.  Next time I will make a few changes.  I think it needs more onion & some garlic.  I will make again with my changes.  We at the dip with crackers and it was perfect.

This is the best hot dip we have ever had.  We make it exactly as it is written.  No changes at all.  We serve it with Frito's scoops.  Our friends rave about it and always request it for parties. No one can keep their hands out of the serving dish...It's addictive.

This was nothing special.  I didn't like it but my company did, although barely any of it was eaten.
I made it exactly as directed except I added a litte bit of garlic.  I topped with paprika and some bread crumbs as was suggested.
This dip was dry, not creamy, and really just tasted like cream cheese and parm.  I couldn't taste any onion.
My company did not care for the Frito scoops - they said it was too heavy for the dip (takes away from the dip itself) and suggest tostitos instead.  
If I had to make any suggestions I'd toss in some sour cream and more mayo, and caramelize the onions first.

This is a REAL crowd pleaser! However, I use 2 bags of frozen onions (thawed and dried), and one 8 ounce can of parm cheese. It's so good! Also, I serve it with Frito Scoops - the big corn chips - fantastic!!

I baked it at 325 convection, but otherwise it works just 'as is' no problems with grease or anything of that nature, the high temp may have caused it to break down in other reviews.

Worked and tasted excellent 'as is'.

I tried a number of highly-rated recipes from this site for my Thanksgiving meal. This is the one that most lived up to the high rating. It's easy, good as-is (no modifications necessary), and works for both casual and elegant gatherings. I will definitely make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I personally thought it needed a stronger onion taste, but I used a sweet onion and if I had used a stronger onion, I think it would have had the taste I was looking for.  The rest of my gang loved it and asked for the recipe, therefore I've rated it 5 stars.

This makes a good amount of dip.  I have to say that it didn't go over well at first, so I had tons leftover.  So I starved my family to force it down and they loved it more the second day after I reheated a little in the microwave.  They said the flavors blended better together this way.

This is incredible! I bring this to parties all of the time and am always asked for the recipe. I would agree that the onion is not overpowering. Delicious!

I took others advice and browned the onion first, also added white pepper. My mom loved it and that's why i'm giving this 4*, but in my opinion it was a little bit bland. Maybe next time i will not brown the onion and will add some garlic and green olives.

The flavor was pretty good because I like onions, cream cheese and parmesan, but it just felt like you were looking for something else in it.  I also didn't care for the mushy consistency of onions-it was okay, but no one raved about it. It just seemed to be there.

I used 1- 8 oz container of cream cheese, 3 oz of shredded romano, 1/4 of a finely diced vidalia onion, and added some pepper and cayenne pepper.  It made about 4 hearty servings worth of dip and was really tasty.  The biggest plus was that it only took about 25 minutes from start to finish.

I have made this recipe for years, but to save on the eyes a little I use a bag of frozen, chopped onions (found in frozen veggie section) thawed and drained.  The onions are much more tender than using a fresh onion.

This dip was great! Only changes I made was that I used low-fat cream cheese (couldn't tell) and added 3 cloves of garlic. Made it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. However, it makes a ton of dip. Next time I will half it.

This has been the most demanded thing I have made. Every party they insist I bring this dip. It is wonderful. I add a little sour cream to mine to make it a little smoother.

This recipe was terrific!  It was a big hit at work, and went quickly.  I also changed the recipe a bit...16 oz cream cheese, 1/3 C mayo, 1 clove finely chopped garlic, and some pepper to taste.  It's easy, and reheats nicely.

Very simple, very quick and very adaptable.  Thanks for a quick one.  Everyone loved it.  I served with the new soy crackers. Great!  I read reviews and made with 2 pkg. cream cheese (1/3 less fat, by accident), 1 very lg. onion, 1/3 c. mayo and 1 c. Parmesan cheese (good ol' Kraft).

This was wonderful. Though, I only used 2 packages of cream cheese. I preferred it warm, my husband preferred it room temperature, but, it's also good cold as a spread. My 18 month old licked it off the cracker. It kind of tastes like French onion dip, but, more cheesy and less oniony. I also don't like mayonnaise, but I still used it in the recipe, and you couldn't even taste it.

This was a big hit at the party! I had to write the recipe down for several people. I served it with butter crackers but it would be heavenly on baked french bread!   Hot Parmesan Dip would be a more descriptive name.  Very easy and very tasty.  Will definitely serve this again.  Thanks.
