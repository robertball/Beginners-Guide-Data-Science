Husband loved it.  I used  2 lb ground round and 1 lb ground turkey.  Did not use the glaze, but will try next time.

I love meatloaf and my husband and kids did not care for it.  So I decided to give another try.  when dinner was served they were all coming to the table "wow what smells so Good"?   I  dished out the meal and they were all in heaven.

Easy and yummy.  I didnt have the full amount of the beef so mine was half beef and half turkey... still came out great. Not greasy and tastes wonderful cold in meatloaf sandwiches.
