I made and brought this to a family Chistmas  gathering a few weeks ago, it was amazing! Their dog got ahold of the leftovers and I was so dissappointed (the dog is okay). The coffee makes the chocolate flavor so much richer and darker. I am remaking another one tonight.  I had to use an egg replacer for my daughters allergies which has me very nervous as it didn't really set up as well as egg whites, so we'll see, fingers crossed.

I made this cake to take to a Labor Day get together at our friend's house. I made it the day before, baking it in a bundt pan. I had a can of cherry-chocolate frosting in the pantry, so I popped that in the microwave for 45 seconds and drizzled that over the cooled cake, sprinkled it with chopped pecans and added a few maraschino cherries on top for decoration. It turned out really pretty, and everyone like it. I also used half espresso, half water for he coffee portion, which really came through in the flavor. The cake alone is not overly sweet, which was nice.

Very time intensive process. While I personally liked  the molasses taste, my family did not care much for this cake. It was very moist. I frosted with chocolate frosting, fresh raspberries, and roasted chopped pecans. When I asked, as I do with all recipes I try, "Keep, and make again, or toss," all voted to toss. Sorry : (

I made this cake when we were low on sugar and it definitely was tasty. Even my husband who is not a sweets person enjoyed it.
