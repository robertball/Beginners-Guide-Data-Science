I made these eggs tonight with my 4 year old son.  We had a great time with the dough.  The end product was Heavenly.  I will makes these again and again. I used Hershey Dark Chocolate chips.  Hubby and Daughter don't like dark ch., but the shortening makes it more like a milk chocolate. I did not add any coconut, yucky!
These eggs are fabulous.  The dough is very easy to work with.  I have to say, I cannot stand it when people give a recipe a bad review, then go on to say how they 'altered' the recipe... That drives me nuts!  If you're going to review a recipe, be honest and make it EXACTLY as written first,  then review it, then make your own changes.  Anyway, this recipe is the best and EASIEST peanut butter egg recipe I've tried.  
Thanks to the person who posted this.

**side note, I just came looking for this recipe to make them again.  My sister wants a copy as well.  I just realized it's one almost one year to the day that I wrote the first review!  These are really the easiest, yummiest peanut butter eggs.  The dough is perfect for kids to handle.

Egg-cellent!  Very easy recipe.  I omitted the coconut (I didn't have any).  TIP:  When adding the sugar save yourself some time and just knead it in w. your hands.  Nearly impossible to stir.

This recipe is amazing! So good. I omitted the coconut of course, but it was just great. I do have to say that 6 cups of melted chips makes A LOT of melted chocolate. I had so much left-over I dipped strawberries and nuts as well. If you dont want to waste so much chocolate just reduce to 5 or even 4 cups of chips and that should be plenty.

This is a good, easy peanut butter egg recipe.  We left out the coconut and used Reeses brand peanut butter.  They tested just like a reeses cup!  Thanks!

This are quite good - could be a little more "peanutty" tasting and I even used chunky peanut butter!  The dough is super easy to work with and a good one to let your 3 yr old help you out with.  The only changes I would make is halve the recipe next time - I had about 8 dozen small eggs, which eventually turned into small balls about 1" in diameter because I just wanted to get done!  In order to get the 66 pieces that the recipe indicates you would have to make pretty large egg shapes which I think  would be way too rich.  Also, I made 3/4 of the amount of melted chocolate for dipping and still had some leftover.  Oh, and like other reviewers we omitted the coconut - didn't sound like it would go well with the peanut butter filling.

Made these for my husband. Added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and only 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar (30 count) and added a little salt. Tasted just like a peanut butter melt-away egg. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I whipped up a batch of these and used chunky peanut butter. I used a few packages of milk chocolate Ghardelli chocolate chips, melted with some vegetable oil.  These are incredibly simple to make and are quite good.  I dipped them twice to make the chocolate cover extra thick. 

I am so pleased with how they turned out.  I am making  the easter eggs this year as a switch from store bought. An excellent recipe I will use again and again.

I doubled the recipe and made 13 eggs, each as big as my fist, to give to family members for Easter. I changed it a bit based on reviews, reduced the sugar by about a cup and added about a tablespoon more of peanut butter per batch. They're creamy but hold shape well as I always refrigerate my peanut butter eggs anyway.  The large size presented challenges when it came to dipping them in the chocolate. I was damaging the eggs using a spoon so I soon learned to use my spatula like a paint brush and apply the chocolate from the bottom up. The bottoms didn't get chocolate but you can't tell it and who looks UNDER a large egg?  I then used white chocolate chips, melted them in a ziplock bag and added some food color. I snipped the end of the bag and piped violet chocolate squiggles back and forth across the egg. They look fantastic and I know will taste great as I was nibbling!

I made these for my husband and co-workers. I'm from PA and this is an Easter staple back home. These tasted JUST like I remember! Everyone in TX who had never had one, fell in love! They were amazing, the only thing I would change is next time I would not use the amount of sugar called for. I might halve it. I also didn't use the shortening. I just melted semi-sweet chips in a microwave safe bowl and dipped the eggs in that.

I get requests for these every Easter.  I don't add the coconut and use dark chocolate to ease (very slightly) how incredibly sweet they are.  I also make them very small and use tempered chocolate instead of adding shortening to chocolate.

These are very much like the ones my mom used to make for Easter.  She coated them in a very thin coating of bitter chocolate though.  These were easy to make, although the peanut butter mixture was a challenge for my little hand mixer!  Easy to roll into balls.  I recommend making these way smaller than called for though.  They are VERY rich!  I could have easily gotten twice as many from this recipe and will do so next time.  I usede Ghiradelli bittersweet chips for coating.  Decorated with a couple of handfuls of white chips melted and piped on top.  Very pretty.  I'll definitely make again!

Ok.  Second batch a week later. Used half bitter chocolate and half semi sweet, added about a half tsp salt to the peanut butter mixture and made them rounded measuring teaspoon size.  Got 166 eggs from this recipe!!! Tinted some white chocolate pink for decorating.  This is eggscellent!  HAPPY EASTER!

I make these for parties/holidays and they are always a big hit.  I'm always asked for the recipe so I know they are well liked.  I freeze them too if I don't need them all at once.

These turned out really pretty and taste delicious! I forgot to buy shortening but just dipping in the melted chocolate turned out fine. I took some other reviewers suggestions and mixed the powdered sugar in with my hands and then after the eggs were dipped in chocolate I let them sit in the fridge for a few minutes then melted white chocolate added a little milk and food dye and put that into a bag with the corner snipped to drizzle over the eggs. I also left out the coconut. As I was making them I thought I probably wouldn't do it again because it did take a while but the next day they tasted and looked even better so I'm now thinking I might do this every year for Easter!

These were really good. I added Rice Crispies to the peanut butter mixture, but that didn't really turn out because the cereal got kind of chewy. Next time, if I want crunch, I'll use crunchy peanut butter instead. Great for Easter baskets!

Wonderful recipe for PB eggs... The way I like them (with the cream cheese).  Typically, I do not add the coconut.  Also, I do not think they need anywhere near the 10x sugar so I typically add the sugar until I think they are the perfect flavor of PB/cream cheese/sugar mix!!

Made these with my grandchildren. Little Riley and I had a great time making the dough. Then the rest of them pitched in to shape and dip into the chocolate. A great family activity. By the way, I forgot to say they were absolutely delicious. Much better than the store made product!

I only used the filling part of this recipe since I buy chocolate to make Easter candy.  I left out the coconut as we are not big fans, but the filling was wonderful.  Highly recommend!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I've used this as my "go to" receipe  when im (we're) craving peanut butter eggs!!  I do adjust the receipe... I omit the coconut (don't like) and add sea salt to the batter just before I add the powder sugar!  Tastes better than the real ones!!! Thanks for sharing this fantastic receipe!!

This is my go to recipe for peanut butter eggs! Love it! I don't use coconut in the peanut butter eggs, but this recipe will work for making coconut eggs INSTEAD of peanut butter. I've made both. Just substitute the coconut for the peanut butter and use a little coconut extract.

Very good recipe. I followed exactly and the dough was very easy to work with and not sticky. Next time I think I will try using half the cream cheese and and adding more peanut butter to give a little more PB taste. I dipped in confectioners coating and they looked awesome. Very rich though, so next time I will make half the size. Made about 60 eggs and they are in the freezer. Great when we need that sugar fix, lol.

These are absolutely wonderful! Made them tonight, went together very quickly. I was surprised by how much it made, I made mine into 3 large eggs instead of the small ones. I plan on decorating them tomorrow for gift giving. Teriffic cost savings between these and the store bought prepared eggs. These are so much better, even my picky teenage son loved it.
