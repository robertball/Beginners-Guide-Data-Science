I made this vegetarian so left off the Worcestershire sauce. Without a green pepper in the house I left that out too. These are wonderful plain or between 2 slices of bread! I'll be making these again!

I had red and yellow bell that needed used up and used those in place of the green bell. This is the only change I made which was really no change at all. These were excellent! I really think these could be baked on a cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick with the same if not better results. Frying makes such a mess and as written these patties hold their shape SO well that I think it is worth a try. Better for you that way with half the hassle. I am far from being a vegetarian but if I were I'd lose the Worcestershire and make these at least once a week. Great and unexpected flavor and a recipe I will make often.

Nice and simple. Made as written with the exception of mushroom and hot sauce. Even my meat- loving family enjoyed it and my youngest simply devoured it. Great recipe which can be easily modified depending on taste and what ingredients are available.

This has a very good flavor. We rolled them like hot dogs and made burritos. My son who is not vegan put cheese on his and went back for seconds. This will be my go to meal!

I'm cutting down meat too but I still need a lot of protein since I go to the gym often so I changed the bean-potato ratio still incredibly tasty and fulfilling.
