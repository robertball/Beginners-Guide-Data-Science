This was my first time cooking cabbage and I had no idea what I was doing.  I had a hard time having so much cabbage in the pan.  I put a lid on it so that the steam would make it cook a little more even. It came out really good and my boyfriend loved it too.  Next time I might add garlic cloves.

I had hopes for this, but I will have to agree with the last review.  I will just stick with my fried cabbage with bacon, onion, garlic salt, and black pepper, fried in bacon drippings and butter.

I thought this was very good.  I made it as a side dish on St. Patty's Day and it got great reviews.  I did find that the sauce was a little runny so I made a rou with butter and flour and added it to the sauce.  It was a great improvement.

This is a really delicious recipe and so easy to make!  A great way to use up leftover cabbage.  I agree with some others that "creamy" may give the wrong impression, but don't let that throw you off this is still a great dish.  I add a little flour before the brown sugar to make the sauce a little thicker, though.

I'm sorry but this recipe was really awful. The "cream suace" looked like watered down milk and it tasted bad. ;(

This tasted ok.  If I make it again I will use a small onion,a tig less brown sugar and add a touch of thichening to the milk as it was not what one might call creamy.

Tried this because it had basic ingredients that I already had..It was really good and easy! I love that it called for white pepper but because my 4yr old finds it" too spicy " I went light on the pepper and added just a little cumin. Everyone love it, when the kids will eat it it's a keeper-Thx!

This is a recipe that you either like it or you don't. I say that because half my family liked it when I made it the first time, and the other half did not, we are ALL cabbage lovers. MY personal opinion is that I prefer the fried style of cabbage. I tweaked this recipe the second and third time making it. I added caraway seeds (1tbs) along with BLACK pepper instead of white. I also added some crispy fried bacon. Reduced the milk to half a cup. So that  is why I gave only three stars. I for my taste had to make several adjustments.

This was surprisingly delicious!  As suggested by another, I added 2 tablespoons of flour to the milk mixture and the sauce was nice and creamy.  I also added lots of salt and pepper.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is very good.  I did have a little trouble thickening the sauce once I put the cabbage and onion in the pan, as they both shed water as they cooked.  I simply turned up the heat to evaporate the water, and it thickened nicely.  I should have added more salt and pepper, though.  At first my husband and I thought it tasted like warm cole slaw, but one bite led to another...and another.  I halved the recipe and we completely finished it.  This will be a do-over, and next time I'll watch my seasonings a little more.  It's not a comparison to a fried cabbage side, but it's a creamy, delicious side all the same.  Paired well with my meat loaf.  Thanks!

I cooked this recipe successfully, hoping for a recipe with more healthy vegetables in it, and it has become an easy frequent side dish for dinner for my boyfriend and I! Thank you! The ingredients are easy to find and simple to follow :O)

This was really tasty, a little sweet but in a good way that complimented the cabbage and onion.  I added garlic pepper seasoning and simmered on low with the lid on for 30 minutes.  this is a keeper!

This was really yummy! I didn't have whole milk so I used 1%. I am pretty sure it probably tasted the same only didn't thicken. Also, I forgot it simmering on the stove and when I came back it was a little curtled(no one said anything to me though).
