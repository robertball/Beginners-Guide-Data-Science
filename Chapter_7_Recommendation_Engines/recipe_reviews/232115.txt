Wonderful! My mom made this and we had to have her make it again because we ate it so fast. Now I am making it.  I think it beats cherry pie, hands down. The perfect amount of tartness.

This was very much like the recipe my Late mother-in-law used and my Hubby has been asking for one like it since rhubarb came into season..The meringue recipe turned out perfect, which says a lot since I am meringue challenged.

The meringue was easy and turned out beautifully. The rhubarb part turned out a little creamer than what I was looking for, but it tasted great!

Added ten minutes to the Cook time as I used 4 cups of rhubarb.  Also added 1/2 cup additional sugar and a bit more flour.

My first meringue pie effort.  We have a ton of rhubarb right now.  I followed the recipe exactly (for a change) and it came out great - just like in the picture.  Next time I might back off a tad on the sugar as I like a little more tart to come through.

This pie was just fabulous. I made no changes to the recipe, didn't need to. Tasted just how I remember Mom's rhubarb pie.  The custard is smooth and creamy. And it wasn't too sweet or too tart. Just perfect.  I used three large rhubarb stalks, each stalk was about 1 cup.  So easy to make.  We have decided that this is our favorite pie and that's saying something.  We will make this again and again, or at least until the rhubarb is gone for the season.
