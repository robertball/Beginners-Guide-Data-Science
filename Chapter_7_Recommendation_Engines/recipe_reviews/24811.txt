Excellent salad! We have enjoyed this salad a number of times. Its very good using the dressing that Lisa B provides. But everyone is WOWED when I use the Hot Bacon Dressing provided by Vera on this site. Thanks Vera and LisaB. This is a keeper.

Very tasty!!  I was asked for the recipe both times I brought it to pot-lucks.  I didn't add all of the dressing (I didn't end up with as much spinach after trimming) and saved it for my own salads at home - mmm!  (The dressing is especially good.  It's good on a plain old lettuce salad as well!)  Great flavor combinations.  Thank you.

Excellent salad.  I used goat cheese (chevre) instead of blue cheese and it was fabulous!  The vinaigrette is wonderful....

This dressing is awesome!!!  I had to go back & make more during dinner because it was soooo good!  I did increase the molasses & decrease the vinegar some.  Used bacon, onion & feta cheese with this dressing.  Maybe next time I will get a hold of bleu cheese & pecans.

The flavor on this was wonderful, but there was too much dressing for the amount of salad. I would cut it down by half if I made it again.

Being one of my favorite salads in general, I am pleased to find this recipe taste very close to what I often order. I didnt follow the exact quantity for the dressing. I found myself using more molasses than recipe recommended. Maybe this was because I used dark powdered molasses. In the end, the salad looked smelled and tasted delicious.

The basic ingredients were great, but I would experiment with the dressing...It seemed a little bitter for the tastes of my family. It also makes alot of salad for just a first course.

I have been using this recipe for over a year now.  The dressing has become one of my favorites, to use on almost any salad (and I don't find it "bland", as some others did, in any way.

I wasn't even going to give this recipe any stars due to how horrible the dressing was.  We took one bite and threw the rest away.  However, I will make this salad again minus the the dressing given and use the dressing from this site for strawberry spinach salad.

very good, used goat cheese instead of blue cheese (because we don't care for blue cheese) and only 1 tsp molasses.

I absolutely love this recipe!!  It's a fabulous combination of flavors.  However, I think using half of the recipe makes a large enough salad unless you plan on using this as the entree.

I had really high hopes for this recipe since I love every ingrediant in the salad. However, they do not go together. The dressing was incredibly bland and I couldn't even taste it. Frankly, it wasn't terrible, it wasn't anything - it was just really, really boring. 
I was trying it out for a bridal shower - and thank goodness I did because it would have gone over like a lead pipe. I made the strawberry spinach salad from this site instead and that was a hit.

We found the dressing too bland, so we sprinkled balsamic vinegar over the salad after we had tossed it in the salad bowl, and WOW what a difference it made.  Try it.

This was sooo good!  The creamy blue cheese paired with the crunch of the red onion and the sweetness of the balsamic was just perfect.  We left out the pecans due to a family nut allergy, but we didn't miss them at all.  Absolutely delicious!

This was excellent. I have made it now 4 times and it has been a hit each time. You can cut the dressing ingredients in half and it will still make enough.  Try adding a bit more molasses and slightly less balsamic vnagrette.

I liked the recipe quite a bit. I used chard though cause thats what I had on hand and omitted the bleu cheese. Substituted brown sugar for molasses and the result was great!

It is a real head scratcher to me when someone absolutely HATES an ingredient, i.e., bleu cheese, and then gives the recipe a poor rating????!!!!  For bleu cheese lovers, this is a good salad.

What a marvelous salad. The bleu cheese is perfectly offset with the Balsamic Vinagrette recipe from this site. I also added seasoned chicken breasts (seasoned with onion soup mix and cajun seasoning) and it became a complete meal not only from a consumption standpoint but from a nutritional one as well. O'Charly's Chicken Pecan Salad can now take a back seat to a new champion and I can make it in my kitchen.

I really only used this recipe as a base, but since I liked what I ended up with, I'm rating it anyway. Instead of bleu cheese, pecans, and red onion, I used avocado, red pepper, and shallot (which I minced and mixed in with the dressing). I didn't cook the dressing, and I only  made half--and I ended up using about 3/4 of that, which was still a bit too much. It was a touch too vinegary, but that may have changed if I'd cooked and reduced it. All in all, an enjoyable salad.

We weren't huge fans, mainly because we don't like blue cheese. The pecans were a nice taste in  the salad but overall the salad didn't match up to many others we've tried, and wasn't as healthy either. We will probably use the pecans again as an ingrediant with future salads, but as a whole this salad wasn't super.

Ingredients are great and go together well.  I agree with other reviews, too much dressing and too bland.  I will look for a better dressing.

My husband says this is a keeper, and I agree! I added avocado and flank steak to make it "black and bleu." I did use the Danish bleu cheese as suggested, and it was very good. I'd never tried that kind before.

Followed this recipe as written.  I don't know what went wrong, it made way too much dressing, it drenched the entire salad and i had nearly a quarter inch of it at the bottom of the bowl.  It was extremely bitter, Again I have no idea what went wrong, i love all the ingredients, it just didn't pan out.

I loved it! I thought it was a very elegant salad and the warm dressing topped it off! I did use feta because I love feta and loathe bleu cheese. Nice change from my regular mixed green salad.

I only had good, syrup-like balsamic vinegar that would have overpower the dish. I used a combo of that and apple cider vinegar.
