I love this recipe, but I roasted my eggplant the way my Greek mother-in-law showed me...I place the whole eggplant, skin and all on the stove burner and charred each side over medium-high heat until it is soft and black all over. Then, i wrap it tightly in foil and placed in on the burner at low heat for about 30 min, turning once.  By this time it should be very soft. Let it sit until it cools enough to handle and unwrap the foil over a bowl to collect all of the juices that leak (the juices add so much flavor) and carefully remove the blackened outer skin and discard that.  Then you are left with a perfectly smoky eggplant pulp to add to the other ingredients.  I keep the seeds in it and don't have any complaints of bitterness.

I think when you grade a recipe you should follow the recipe all the way through. This allways makes me smile when I see people saying "I substituted this for that and I also fried it instead of baking and then I used different amount of ingredients and it tuned out to be yacky, so do not bother."
I like to follow recipes and find out what makes the taste. So here it is:
1. This is very important to have a good tahini. Buy one made from roasted sesame seeds. No mayo can substitute tahini. If you like you can use mayo in addition, but that alternates the taste.
2. Choose big eggplant or 2 medium. One of the comments here was very helpful.
3. Bake it - do not fry. Do not cut and do not peel before baking. The catch here is not only to make it soft. It is important that skin and some eggplant meat burn. The best method to use described by TYEBUG in comments. 
4. I did not have to deal with bitterness. Eggplants here in California are not bitter at all. I tried Chinese eggplants for this recipe as well, the regular eggplants are better, they taste different. Chinese eggplants might be a great alternative to bitter once in your area.

Do not forget to salt it at the end!

here's a hint to get rid of the "bitterness" some are unhappy about:
after cutting the eggplant rub salt on it and let it set for about 20-30 minutes (makes prep time longer, but worth it. the salt draws out the bitterness)rinse, pat dry and continue with the rest of the steps. ;)

This recipe calls for way too much fresh lemon juice.  I added about 3 extra tablespoons of garlic, more salt and sesame seeds and it still was distasteful with the strong lemon flavor.  This was quite an expensive recipe to toss ($6.00 just for a jar of tahini).  Afterwards I checked one of my cookbooks for Baba Ghanoush and that recipe called for SIX eggplants to be used with 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice!

Very, very good recipe. I didn't think I liked Baba Ghanoush until I had it as part of an appetizer platter at a local Lebanese restaurant recently. I had only ever bought the store brand pre-made stuff which was just awful. So I was inspired to try some of my own. This recipe was very good. I agree with another reviewer who suggested roasting the eggplant. Just place it directly on your burner for a few minutes until the skin is sufficiently burned (yes, it will smell like something is burning). Then wrap it in foil and cook it directly on the burner for another 30 minutes (depending on size), turning it over halfway. Then I put a plastic baggy over it for a few minutes to let it sweat, and the peel will come right off. I made the rest of it using the exact recipe, and it's in the fridge now. Delicious!!

This was great addition to a Mediterranean themed buffet. My friends are still talking about it! I thought the amount of lemon juice was just right. To avoid bitterness, I drained the eggplant pulp really well after roasting and before mixing with the other ingredients (put the pulp in a colander; place a plate and a little weight like a bottle of olive oil on it; let sit for 15 minutes). Great recipe!

I had great success with this recipie.  Excellent with toasted French bread and good quality cheese.  From my many years of trial and error in cooking, I would strongly suggest using a food processor with the ‘mashing’ blade rather than a blender (as is noted).  Blenders are very difficult to use for relatively thick mixes like this.  They do work, but they take a lot of patience.  I suspect that those who gave this recipe a low rating, may have started with bitter or less than desireable eggplant.  Just as a precaution, I took a small taste of all my eggplant after the baking process and before placing them in the food processor.

Very yummy! I made it twice and both times it turned out wonderfully. My preparation time was longer than the one specified by the author because I let the eggplant sit in a colander for half an hour after I baked it. It allowed the bitterness and some extra liquid disappear. Plus I squeezed out as much liquid from the eggplant as possible before putting it in the food processor. If the length of preparation time is a concern to you and you do not need to have the dish ready the same day, I suggest splitting the cooking time in two batches: broil and drain the eggplant during the first batch, the evening before, and mix it with all remaining ingredients in the second batch, the next day. Good luck!

Great!  Next time, I will add less lemon juice though - maybe cut it in half. I used 2 tablespoons of the tahini, and it was just fine. I used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper, and mixed in 1 tbl olive oil while still in the blender.  Wonderful! Very authentic recipe - just like the Lebanese restaurants!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a quintessential Baba Ghanoush recipe. Exactly what it is supposed to taste like. I made this according to the author without any changes or substitutions. I will say a few additional things for preparing this again. Tahini tastes so similiar to peanut butter I might substitute and see if the dish tastes the same since tahini is rather expensive. I also might toast the sesame seeds for a nuttier flavor. Then again, I might just make it exactly the same without any changes. I loved this, it's healthy, full of potassium, easy to make and delicious. I scooped this up with warm whole wheat pita bread but any bread or chips would be great. Outstanding recipe, thank you for submitting this.

Great recipe except for one thing - ROAST the garlic instead of adding raw minced garlic, which can completely overpower the eggplant. Roast the garlic along with the eggplant. The roasted garlic will be milder and sweeter, so you can add more - I add about 5-7 cloves of the roasted garlic.  I also add chopped parsley to the dip for more color and flavor.  Use a hand-held immersion blender if you have one.  This dip taste best after it sits overnight for the flavors to meld and will keep for a good 3 days.  Serve with pita chip!

This is great and super easy to make. I make this every couple of months. My grocery store will sell old eggplants for $1. It's perfect. The best part is stirring the olive oil in at thend. It adds a new layer of flavor. I cut the eggplants in half an dplace them face side down w/ a little olive oil brushed on. then roast at 375 for 30 minutes. At the end, I place htem in the broiler face side up for 5-10 minutes. This brings out a unique smokiness.

I am really surprised that so few people, even Chefs, don't know how to pick non-bitter eggplant. Here's a little know fact. When selecting an eggplant be sure it is firm and check the bottom end (not the stem end). If it is indented then it is a female eggplant and is NOT bitter. I was told this many years ago by an organic farmer. To this day, at least a hundred eggplants later I have NEVER had a bitter eggplant.I never salt and press them anymore. My sweet Italian grandmothers would die if they knew how much time they wasted preparing eggplant in the past.
I even told the Chef from the Ritz about it during a cooking class and he thanked me the next time I saw him.

The problem with this recipe is that there is no measurement for the amount of roasted eggplant pulp. Think about what would happen if recipes said use 10 carrots instead of 6 cups grated carrot, or 4 tomatoes versus 3 cups diced tomato.  Too imprecise for reliability. 

I looked up Baba Ghanoush here because my grocery store had a sale, eggplants for $1 each. This recipe only calls for 1 eggplant and I'd bought 2, but I figured if the final product needed more tahini or lemon juice it would be easy enough to add it in.  What I didn't expect was that there would be FAR TOO MUCH tahini in the recipe.  The overwhelming flavor was tahini - so much so as to make it inedible.  Anyway, in order to salvage my dish, I bought 2 more eggplant - at nearly 3 times the price as the originals.  

I strongly feel there should have been a measurement given for the amount of roasted eggplant to the tahini and lemon juice. The amount, apparently, the recipe submitter obtained from 1 eggplant has taken 4 medium sized eggplants for me to get.  Not a good way to write a recipe, IMO.  Barring a measurement for the amount of eggplant, which I feel is optimal so that if the user wound up with a different amount, they would know to alter the proportions of the remaining ingredients, at least instruction could have been given to add tahini and lemon juice "to taste" as opposed to 1/4 c each.  

I'm giving this 3 stars because I should have thought about this before making the recipe as written.

Amazing. But I would agree with other users that for that much lemon juice, you would really have to up the amount of eggplants to atleast four.

I found that just halving the eggplant and scooping the insides into the blender was easier than skinning the thing.

Wonderful recipe for Baba Ghanoush!  I roasted the eggplant at 400 degrees for about an hour, until it collapsed.  Wrapped in plastic for easy peeling, then cut up the eggplant flesh before mashing.  I think the problem some folks are having with bitterness is linked to the size and age of the eggplant used, the length of time roasted, and how long they let the mixture sit before eating.  The eggplant that I chose was very firm to the touch, and ended up being sweet right after roasting.  (It was almost TOO sweet; I ended up adding a little extra lemon juice and a little more salt to compensate.)  The garlic amount was just right for me.  I added liquid smoke, then was sorry I had, as it felt like it sweetened the mix even more.  I like the addition of toasted sesame seeds; they look much like the eggplant's own seeds.  While I would also enjoy this recipe "jazzed up" with cumin and a little cayenne, it was delicious just as it is, and much more palatable to my toddler grandson.

In addition to salting, draining the eggplant to avoid bitterness, I came upon some sites that say there are "male" and "female" eggplants and that the "male" tend to have less seeds and are less bitter.
Quotes I have found: Male eggplants have fewer seeds (which are often bitter) than the female; they have a rounder, smoother blossom end or base. The blossom end of a female eggplant is generally indented.   AND  Eggplants have a dimple at the blossom end. The dimple can be very round or oval in shape. The round ones seem to have more seeds and tend to be less meaty, so select the oval dimpled eggplant.   AND LASTLY  There are both male and female eggplants, identifiable by the shape of the scar in the depression at the blossom end. If it has a round dot that looks like a dimple, it's a male; if it has a dash, it's a female. At one time the male eggplant was more desirable because it had fewer seeds than the female eggplant. However, today's newer varieties, male or female, have very few seeds.

So folk-wisdom or not, maybe worth trying.

I'm a Middle Easterner and grew up eating baba ghanoush for various cooks and this was one of the best I've ever eaten. The only difference is that I put the eggplants in a smoker for a few hours then followed the recipe as written. I also garnished it with mint leaves. My Arab and Persian friends ate it all and asked for more.

Great recipe...it was very quick and had a nice result.  This baba ghanoush was a little thicker than other recipes I've had, but it had a wonderful multi-dimensional flavor! The only thing I changed was after roasting the eggplant, I covered it will plastic wrap until cooled and pulled the skin off this way (the skin will separate itself and stick to the plastic wrap).  I also pulled as many of the seeds of the eggplant out before processing...it makes the result less bitter.

Amazing!  The key is broiling the eggplant in the oven 30-40 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, until cooked well and the skin is charred all over.  Scoop out the eggplant, put in a bowl and let the water drain out.  Dispose of water.  I used 1 small-medium sized eggplant, 1 clove garlic, 1 1/2 tsp tehina and 1 1/2 tspn lemon, salt and pepper to taste.  I'll be making this again soon!

Everyone who tried this recipe told me that it was the very best they'd ever had.
Took other's advice and charred the eggplant over the stove flame for a bit b4 wrapping in foil and baking for 30 minutes. Made sure to include any juices into the mix. FANTASTIC!

For those of you who like myself, who DON'T HAVE A GAS STOVE, but still want to follow TYEBUG's recipe here's what I did:  Instead of baking the eggplant in an electric oven, BROIL it.  I set my stove to between 400-450.  Don't use parchment paper because it will burn, instead line a sheet with tin foil and cooking spray.  You'll probably still set off the smoke alarm, so be prepared.  After about half an hour it was totally charred and squishy, so I let it cool and followed the recipe exactly.  ***garlic and lemon juice are always to taste no matter what the recipe says!!!***  There was no bitterness and the smokey eggplant melted in my mouth like butter (without the fat)!!!!

This was very good.  However, I wish I had continued reading the reviews about the 'bitterness' subject before making it.  Mine wasn't too, too bitter, but there was that funny tang I would have liked to avoid.  A little extra sea salt (the only kind I use) in the mix helped.  I recommend adding the lemon juice a little at a time; I found 1/4 cup to be too much for the medium-sized eggplant I used.  Fortunately I realized it before dumping the whole thing in.  Ditto for the tehina.  (That could be why others found it too runny or mushy.)For added flavor, I roasted the eggplant over lump charcoal, with garlic slices in the slits.  Gave it a nice smokiness.  So, it's definitely a keeper, but with some minor modifications.  Finally, the measurements seem to be geared to a large eggplant or two medium ones - it would have been nice to know that before making it.

This is a very good recipe for Baba Ghanoush!  I changed things according to my personal tastes:  a little more garlic, a little less lemon juice ... and I also didn't use sesame seeds, as I didn't have them on hand.  When I first mixed everything together, I took a taste and almost reeled from the bitter quality.  I thought I had done something horribly wrong.  But after a few hours in the fridge, that had all cleared up.  Baba Ghanoush is delicious with crudites or flatbread (of course), but I found another good accompaniment:  Morningstar Farm's "Chik'n Strips" (faux chicken strips that you brown in a skillet).  Yum!

Easy tasty recipe.  I would add more lemon next time I make it but it was a big hit served with toasted pita.  I think adding roasted garlic would be nice to mellow it out a bit and add more flavor.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I had to make the tahini homemade which was a pain, but it turned out well.  When I tried the baba ghanoush right after it was done, the lemon flavor was overwhelming so I added tomato paste.  After waiting three hours like the recipe calls for, the eggplant absorbed some of that flavor and it was a hit.  Next time I would add a little less lemon juice and put more tomato paste in it.

That's a good recipe. We always do it in the middle east. Some other ways to do this is: 
1. Boil eggplant if you want a lighter taste.
2. Blend everything together.
3. Add a roasted red chili to the blender if you can handle a chili flavor
4. To garnish, I always use pomegranate seeds. Gives an amazing kick.
5. I use it as an appetizer or a dip with celery or carrot sticks or with pita bread.

To prevent having your baba ghannouj (real Lebanese name) from having a dark color, just add two tablespoons of plain yogurt to the ingredients :) As I am Lebanese, I don't add any sesame seeds to this recipe! I just reduce the amount of lemon juice mentioned above and follow the same steps of baking. I just grill it inside the oven directly under fire and turn it every now and then, then place it under running cold water, to make peeling it easier. Then I place it in a colander to get rid of all the access liquid! ENJOY

Great! When I'm roasting the egg plant I also roast a whole head of garlic rubbed in oil and put this into the food processor with the eggplant at the end.  I don't peel the eggplant either.  I let them cook in oven til skin is mushy, turning once, and burnt.

Tahini is a paste made from ground up sesame seeds... so it's seems sort of redundant and superfluous to add sesame seeds and and grind them up in the blender with the tahini already in use.  Other than that, this is an okay recipe.  I would probably add some chopped parsley.

This recipe is basically perfect (with a few minor tweaks)---the closest I have come to the baba ganoush at the chain restaurant in NC called Baba Ganoush. I followed suggestions of others (why re-event the wheel?), such as: lemon juice to taste, 2 or 3 eggplants rather than one, charring eggplants on stovetop method, saving the charred juice to add later, and allowing peeled eggplant pulp to rest in collander in order to get out most liquid.  btw, there is NO substitute for tahini that will do any baba ganoush justice.

I switched up the recipe a little bit. I wrapped the eggplant in foil after puncturing it all around. I also used fresh squeezed lime juice in place of lemon juice.  Lastly, I completely omitted the oil, used more garlic, and added cumin and some olives while processing in a blender.  I garnished with cayenne pepper for a spicy bite. It went over fairly well.

This is delicious. I used the juice of 1 lemon, 3 T tahini, and 3 cloves of garlic. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika to add to the smoky flavor and garnished with chopped flat leaf parsley on top.  Thanks!

Pretty good but mine came out too garlicky. In the future I may either use less or maybe saute or roast it first. I used freshly ground sesame seeds instead of tahini because my middle-eastern friend said it was better that way. Hers still tastes better than mine did :(  but I believe that her secret may be a really good olive oil, which I am always too cheap to invest in.  Maybe it's time!

I've been in the food business from a very young age (9-at the dishwashing station working my way up from there to chef). I continue to learn new ideas and dishes from others every day of my life and will keep it up till I'm no longer able to hold a fork in one hand and eat with the other:-) This was a good recipe. Enjoyed it. It is important to give it at least 3 hours in frig so flavors have time to meld. Thanks for posting.

I didnt make this recipe, but we make this all the time and its very similar to how we make it. We started studding our eggplant with the garlic cloves (cut slits in the flesh and push the cloves in) and it makes the dish less bitter with the garlic cooked. Also we like the eggplant done on the bbq. This is a delicious dish, you should try it. You will be hooked.

It tastes fresh.  I'm not sure whether this is good or bad.  Regardless, I'm just not that excited about the dip and I'm not sure why.  Baba ghanoush I've had in restaurants tend to have both more lemon juice and more garlic, though I don't think that's the core of what's bothering me (though next time I will use more than two large cloves).  Perhaps the problem could be that the eggplants didn't end up blackened.  (Although the recipe doesn't mention it, some reviews claim blackening helps.)  I roasted the eggplants--I used two medium, regular eggplants, as suggested by some reviewers--for 45 minutes because they weren't soft by the 30-40 minutes the recipe calls for.  Incidentally, the eggplants seemed to have lots of seeds; I left them in.  Also incidentally, the smell and taste pre-chilling reminded me of some sort of nut butter like peanut butter.  I guess that's the tahini and sesame seeds.

It turned out great!  I roasted the eggplants cut in half (open faced, with olive oil, salt, pepper and then faced down until it was slightly charred on both sides).  I didn't add the extra sesame seeds and I left the peel on for color.

I had a little trouble with this recipe - probably because I tried to double it.  I ended up mixing this with what I already know about hummus and ending up with a wonderful roasted eggplant hummus (affectionately dubbed baba gahummus) It was still really good and I can't wait to try and REALLY make baba ganouhj!

This recipe was way too bitter.  If I could figure out how to change that then I'd try it again, along with cutting the seeds out of the eggplant.  They were not appetizing.

I thought this recipe was awful.  The taste was very bitter and the preperation took way too long.

I really disliked Baba Ganoush until I found this recipe. Now I make it often and it doesn't last long. Thank You!

I think it is great, I added two touches to your recipe. I cooked the eggplant on my Weber charcoal grill and I added 1 more tsp of sesame seeds and roasted them before using.

THIS IS SUCH A GOOD RECIPE!!!  Seriously, prepared it exactly as called for, probably went a little overboard on the salt... but it's awesome.  I used Thai White Ribbed eggplant from my very own garden, and there is not even a little bitterness.  I think that bitterness comes when you choose eggplant that is too ripe, they get kinda gross.  Fresh, young picked eggplant is best.

I actually used half a jar of fire roasted eggplant (from the ethnic food store) instead of doing it myself, and followed everything else exactly. It was yummy!

What a great recipe!  I used a small eggplant, so used only 2 Tbsp lemon juice and 2 Tbsp tahini.  The recipe indicates that the baba ghanoush should chill in the fridge for several hours before serving, but mine never made it!  It tasted so good, we ate it on the spot.

This recipe did not work for me  It was easy enough to make but it just did not turn out.  Maybe this was because we picked a bad eggplant?  We weren't really sure what to look for.  Even with tweaking this recipe could not be salvaged.

This was great!  It is a little labor intensive, but very tasty.  I used three small eggplants.  I thought they would be easy to peel once roasted, like a pepper is, but the skin is much more difficult to get off.  I was not exact in my measurements - a few spoonfuls of tahini, 3 cloves of garlic, a little more than half a lemon, juiced.  I threw everything but the olive oil in the food processor, processed it until it was a consistent texture, then drizzled in olive oil with the processor running until it seemed like a good, creamy consistent. I think the recipe is pretty forgiving on measurements.  Great consistency, good with pita chips.

I follow the  recipe's oven roasting directions and it always turns out delicious.  But I am curious about one reviewer's stovetop technique and will try that next time.

Made this recipe twice following directions EXACTLY the first time.  Delicious.  The second time I only used ONE clove of garlic and at the end I stirred in a drop or two of liquid smoke as another user suggested and it was even MORE DELICIOUS - this is amazing... best Baba Ghanoush EVER!

I thought this was waaaaay too lemony for me.  I'd cut that lemon juice down by half.  Otherwise, an interesting recipe and would be a great dip for pita chips.  I'll try it again for sure.

Okay...I followed the recipe exactly, except to roast the garlic while roasting the eggplant.  In the end, it was a little bitter and had WAY too much of a lemon juice taste. It took a lot of salt and some cumin and cayenne to make it something I could eat.

A word of warning for the weak: this recipe is garlic heavy.  This is a boon for us garlic lovers.  Great taste and lasts a few days.  Great on salads for a low-fat, low-calorie dressing!

Pretty good!  I prefer mine with a smoked flavor and since I couldnt get that taste from my attempt to grill it, I added about 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon of Liquid Smoke.  MMMMM!

I just reviewed this and added a star.  I still added the liquid smoke but the base recipe was still great.

I tweaked this recipe a little according to personal preference. The outcome was terrific! 

I prepared the eggplant for roasting by poking it with a fork and then wrapping it in foil. I used 4 cloves of roasted garlic, omited the oil entirely, and used a little less lemon juice than recommended in the original recipe. The garlic was fully cooked only a short time after I removed the eggplant from the oven.

Thanks to Winky for posting such a great recipe!

Winky, this is wonderful! I baked my eggplants for a little less time than the recipes indicates.  Then, I turned on the broiler and charred them for about 5 minutes each side. I still put them into the cold water, like you suggested, and then peeled them.  I then put the insides into a strainer to get rid of the extra liquid. Other reviewers suggested this to get rid of the bitterness. I didn't use as much tahini, only 2 TBS. We wanted to eat it right away so even though we didn't wait the 3 hours, it was still divine...and not bitter! PERFECT! EASY! And to top it all off, my SUPER picky 3-year-old son ate it!

I found it to be somewhat bitter so I added a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of Hoisin Sauce which improved the overall flavor.

This was pretty darned good. It might have come out a bit watery, but the flavor was very nice. My friend who had never tried baba ganoush before and doesn't like many exotic foods couldn't quit munching on it. Definitely something I will make again.

I wanted to try this recipe to use up some of the eggplant from my garden.  I love eggplant any way I have tried it.  It was hard not to eat it all while I was making it.  I only used the juice of 1/2 lemon.  That was plenty.  This will be enjoyed with my homemade pita bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Winky.

I loved it as I made minor changes to suit my taste. Less lemon. A lot less lemon. (As others have noted) I learned that from making hummus too. I like a lot less lemon in both. You can add more if you need to. I doubled the garlic and added a tad more tahini because I love the stuff. The sesame seeds are important! You can also make your own tahini if you have extra sesame seeds.

Yummy! I baked my eggplant and then added a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke to give it that smoky flavor and used white pepper to not ruin the color.

I followed the recipe to a T and IMO it has way to much lemon juice.  I've had this dish many times before but this was the first time I made it.  None of the ones I've had before had that much lemon in it.  I thought it was suppose to be a brightening note not an overpowering flavor.  The concept was good but the miscalcutaion on the lemon juice ruined the dish.  I will now have to figure a way to thin the flavor out because this was a rather expensive learning experience.

This is an excellent recipe. The only change that I made was to cook the eggplant on the gas grill. Make sure to turn frequently. The slight charred flavor of the eggplant is delicious.

I followed the directions exactly but used Japanese eggplant. It came out great. The kids are devouring it on flat bread.

I cooked the eggplant as tyebug explained.   No problem with the recommened 1/4 cup lemon juice.   Of course, I love lemon.  Bits of blackened skin are unavoidable, but also give a great smokey flavor.   I didnt notice any unpleasant bitterness leaving in all the seeds.   But isnt it supposed to have a  little bitterness anyways? Hardest part of the recipe is letting it cool off.   It tastes so good warm.  I have to wait 3 hours before I can eat?!

Very happy with this recipe. I think the blackening of the eggplant does give it that smoky flavour that our household enjoys. This is a lovely low calorie, healthy dip and spread, we use it on falafel sometimes for a different taste. I would recommend this as a great base recipe that you can tweak according to your own taste. Some like more garlic, some less, some like lemon, some less...

Fantastic Recipe! I used 1 ½ tbsp lemon juice. 2 tbsp of sesame oil were substituted for the tahini and sesame seeds. After poking several holes, I applied a salt rub to the skin for 30 mins. The eggplant, sweated of all trace of bitterness, was rinsed to remove the salt and sweat, then baked.            Everyone at the table loved this baba ghanoush, young and old!

I served this delicacy on "substitute" flat bread:
Sprinkle a few slices of white bread with a dash paprika and seasoned salt.
Use a rolling pin to flatten the bread slices.
Add one tablespoon of olive oil to a heated skillet.
Toast the flattened bread on both sides.
 OPTIONAL:
Slice each slice of toast diagonally twice to yield four fine-looking triangles for your presentation.
Place a dollop of baba ghanoush on each  & Bon Apetit!

The taste is worthy of 5 stars particularly if the eggplant are burnt on an open flame to cook. I stopped at just 4 stars because making this from just a single eggplant is a tease. I could easily eat it all myself. I need AT LEAST 3 medium to large eggplants in order to share or serve. Excellent! Adjust the seasonings to your own taste if needed but perfect as is.

very good...I would cut back on the tahini a little bit next time.  FYI, there is a middle-eastern (?) seasoning called Sumac.  I get it at a specialty middle eastern store...it's not expensive.  Anyway, that is good sprinkled on top.  (Sumac tastes kind of like a salty-sour mix...it's subtle, but really a flavor surprise).  This is very good served with whole wheat pita bread (brush the pita halves with olive oil and sprinkle with sumac...bake the pita halves for 15minutes at 350).

My family complained that it was bitter. I added a little sugar in an effort to cut the bitterness (I know, I know, it doesn't belong!) and I liked it. But my family still thought it was too bitter. I'll try the tips to let the eggplant sit after baking to get rid of the bitterness if I should try this again...

Very good recipe that is simple and easy to follow.  It was a tad too lemony and garlicky for my taste, so next time I would use a bigger eggplant (or even 2 eggplants) as some other reviewers have suggested.

Wow! What a delicious, easy and healthy way to prepare eggplant.  I have made this recipe several times now and my whole family loves it. I prefer to go a little easy on the tahini and lemon juice, you can always add more. Also, for this recipe, I think it is especially important to use fresh squeezed lemon and fresh garlic as opposed to out of a jar.  I’ve done it both ways and fresh really makes a difference here. I had some trouble pealing the eggplant and resorted to cutting it in half and scooping.  This method works well for me. To cut down on calories I serve it on cucumber rounds instead of pita bread.  Better still, if I have some humas, I spread a little humas on each cucumber round first and then top with the baba ganoush. I hold back a few of the sesame seeds to sprinkle on as a garnish. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I LOVED this recipe! I doubled it by using 2 medium egg plants. Otherwise I followed it to a tee + the addition of some parsley at the end for color!

Don't rate this recipe until you let the dip sit over night! It is very very good after a few good hours in the fridge - i wasn't that impressed as soon as i finished making this last night. i could really only taste the tahini, i thought it was blend and that the flavors didn't mesh well. this morning - well, i had to really hold myself back from eating half the bowl. it was really good, the flavors really came together and the consistency was just right. really tasty - it didn't have as much of a smokey flavor as some baba ghanoush recipes but i was okay with that - delicious!

I love this and so do my children.  I never seem to have sesame seeds handy but I follow the rest of the instructions and have no problems.  Also, I didn't pierce my eggplant but I found that it does NOT explode (as someone else had said).

This was soooo yummy!!!  I'd heard about this stuff but never tried it.  I'm a hummus regular but from now on, I think she will be my hummus.  The only thing I changed was I roasted my garlics along with my eggplant because raw garlic is a bit intense on the breath.  Also, I ate it immediately instead of waiting.  The next day the garlic flavor had def. intensified so maybe that is what the fridge time would do?  Either way, loved it and thanks.

It's a really good recipe. I followed Tyebug's method of grilling since it really does give a nice smokey flavor to the end product! I would add the lemon juice slowly as well instead of the whole 1/4 cup. Sometimes, 1/4 cup is just too much...

This turned out pretty darn good!  My eggplants were a bit watery after they came out of the oven so I tried to squeeze out as much as I could, so my baba turned out a little thinner than I get at resturants.  I doubled the recipe, but next time I will cut down a bit on the garlic.  I love garlic but 4 cloves for a double batch is a bit much.  thank you for the recipe!

WAY too much lemon!  It completely overwhelmed the other flavors.  Next time I think I'll start with one tablespoon and mix, taste and add until I get what I want.

I did everything the same as the recipe except I left out the sesame seeds, I think it has enough sesame taste with the tahini.  This is so good the next day, I made Peppy's Pitas to got with it and am thinking about eating this again soon!

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly; the only thing I'd change is to add more garlic.  I served it with tomatoes and grilled garlic chicken in pita.

Hmmm...after a day in the fridge, mine turned the most unappetizing deep grey color!

Otherwise, it's good...different, but it'd make a great sandwich filling...not as crazy about it as a dip, as I'm used to, but not a total loss...it's similar to all other recipes I have, so it's probably just me!

Quite Yummy.  I used 2 small italian eggplants which I sliced in 1 inch pieces, salted and let drain in a colander to release the bitterness before cooking; I cooked the garlic (to make it more "sociable") and added the lemon juice as needed. It was my first attempt at baba ghanoush and it certainly won't be my last.  This one's going in my recipe book!!!

This recipe turned out very nice, although not quite what I expected. I added a little cayenne pepper to give a bit more depth of flavor.  Very nice with toasted pita chips.  Will make this again next time eggplant is on sale.

This is pretty good! It was a little too lemony for me . So, I added more garlic , olive oil, and tahini. Was good with pita crisps.

I made it with Ichiban eggplant from my garden and it got rave reviews at a party.   I used 5 of the eggplant because they are smaller.  I added a little more garlic because that is the way we roll here.  Teenage daughter and her friends liked it.  Just saying.

I followed half of "TYEBUG"'s instructions, charring in on my gar burners, but when i wrapped it in foil,  i finished it in the BROILER... want to try it on the grill, but it's been too hot out! Also, i roasted a whole head of garlic, added that in it, and used one (not 2) clove of fresh garlic.. And instead of S&P to taste, I Adobo to taste, but thats just how I season at my house! Also I use whatever eggplant i can get my hands on, and at the garden i've got Japanese eggplant (long skinny) and Black beauty (short squatty), With either variety, at least the size in my garden, I need 3 or 4 eggplant per batch... Most recently I made a double batch With 9 Japanese Eggplant... (Had to figure out how to use it and fast! I have more on the plants still growing!) came out really good! But with store bought, i'd stick to one big one.

Excellent! Made it per the recipe except I sliced the eggplant in half, brushed each half with olive oil and salt, and grilled it because it was 90 out and didn't want to heat up the house. The grilled smokey flavor was wonderful. Next time I will take the trouble to roast a bulb of garlic too. That will remove the bite from the raw garlic and make this dish superb.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I did it exactly as posted here, however I'm sure that roasting the eggplant differently could add more flavour (like on a charcoal grill, aw yeah). This recipe was simple and worked great. 

As a side note, to people who find this recipe expensive - tahini is very simple to make! You can spend anywhere from $6-$12 on a jar, or you can spend $2 on a bag of sesame seeds; as long as you have olive oil, an oven and a food processor, you're good to go. 

Spread hulled sesame seeds out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake them for about 6 minutes, then take them out and mix them around a bit. Put them back in the oven for another 6 or so minutes. You'll know they're done because they turn a golden brown colour and they are nicely fragrant. Transfer them off the baking sheet (easily done with the parchment paper) into your food processor bowl - sesame seeds are super easy to burn, so you want to avoid continuing to cook them by leaving them on the hot pan. At this point, I turn on the food processor for a bit and break them down, then it's a matter of adding olive oil until you hit the consistency you like. I let mine get a little soupy, but still thick. Salt/pepper to taste. 

Voila - tahini. 

It'll keep in the fridge for about a month and if it does go bad before then, trust me you'll know. It'll smell rancid. Also, you can use it for all kinds of recipes - not just baba and hummus, there are so many on this site - check it out!

This was very good. I would have liked a more garlic flavor and added some garlic powder after making it and I just wasn't getting the garlic flavor I wanted. I thought this was an easy recipe to make which pleased me very much. I will definitely make this again but add more garlic at the beginning. I may even roast garlic while roasting the eggplant.

Perfect!  The only thing I changed is I made my own tahini rather than paying the price to buy it.  (toast 2c sesame seeds on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for 4-5 minutes.  DO NOT brown.  When time is up, remove from oven and put them into a food processor or VitaMix with 1/4c canola or other MILD vegetable oil.  If you want the paste, stop here.  Store in fridge up to 3 months or freeze up to 6 months.  If you want the tahini sauce, measure out 1/2 c paste, add 1 clove garlic and salt to taste. Blend till smooth. If it is too thick you can add water, a tablespoon at a time until it is the right consistency.  If you are making this recipe, do not add lemon but for most recipes I add additional lemon juice to the tahini.  After it is smooth you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or serve immediately.

I just made this recipe today as part of my taste test for a new restaurant that I work. I made a little bit of adjustments and added some ingredients. The restaurant's owner was impressed and we are definitely including Ghanoush in our line of appetizers.

This was a good recipe although my family found it a bit lemony. I added another eggplant and a heaping spoonful of tahini. My Moroccan husband and his middle eastern friends loved it! To make it easier and quicker I microwave the eggplant. This is going to be the second time making this in two weeks. Very good recipe!

Followed recipe verbatim. Calls for an excessive amount of tahini, Recommend cutting by half or to 1/3rd, possibly less, slightly too much lemon (per other comments), recommend dropping 25%.  It just isn't authentic and tastes like burnt sesame and bitterness per recipe specs.  With adjustments on second batch seems to taste more oloi-friendly

Fabulous! I seared the skin over flame as one reviewer recommended, wrapped in foil & continued to cook over low flame, but I second-guessed myself when I smelled what I thought was the eggplant burning, so I didn't go the whole 30 min., result: eggplant didn't cook all the way through. I omitted the olive oil to save on calories, and still loved the taste. Thought the lemon juice just right. Not sure I'll add sesame seeds next time, tahini was enough. Thanks for this new favorite!

Very good recipe!  A friend suggested roasting the eggplant on the barbecue, this adds a really nice smokiness to it.  I cut slits in the eggplant and then shoved whole garlic cloves in them before roasting.  You can also roast a whole tomato and add it to the recipe.  Just keep the heat fairly low, or the eggplant won't cook enough.

This was exactly what I was looking for. Good balance of flavors, good texture, and very nice spread on celery sticks. Decent snack if you're doing the low carb thing. I wish I wasn't but if you must, this makes it a bit easier. :o)

This is fantastic!!  
We add at least 3 cloves of garlic.  We serve this with pita chips.  I absolutely hate hummus but this is awesome!  First had it in the Cayman Islands and fell in love with it.  I like it slightly warm.

This was gray-grossness. Even my I'll-eat-anything-husband said I could pitch it in the trash. I have so much tahini left from a 15 oz can. I hope I can find another use for it. Maybe I'll make some hummus. Sorry, Winky.

I doubled this recipe and added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and started with 1/4 of lemon, adding more to taste. I didn't have any sesame seeds, but it didn't matter - this recipe was absolutely outstanding. It was my first time making it and I'll never buy baba ghanoush again.

I used a 1.25 lb eggplant (when picking it should give a little when you apply pressure with your finger but it should never feel spongy) which I roasted at 425 for 25-30 minute. I put it in the oven along with dinner. I let it sit in the pan for 30 minute before peeling. I sprinkled my crushed garlic cloves and mashed them into a paste. I 3/4 of a medium lemon (1/4 was used for tzatziki). I used the recipe's measurement of tahini and olive oil. I added salt and pepper and blended everything in my food processor until smooth and creamy. Almost as good as my favorite Mediterranean place - I don't have the touch of someone who has made this for years. All in all an excellent recipe that I intend to use.

Amazing!!! Who knew so few ingredients could create such a flavorful treat? I followed the recipe to the T except for adding more garlic, because I always add more garlic, just as a personal preference. Delish!! Highly recommended :)

I made quite a few adjustments to this, but it is yummy.  First it took almost 1.5 hours to cook the eggplant in the oven, maybe my eggplant had a particularly large end but you may have to cook a lot longer than suggested to make sure it's really cooked well all the way through.  Second, I don't like heavily tahini tasting things (I always cut the amount when I make hummus) so I put 2 T. of lemon juice and 2 T tahini.  This was about right, but I might cut the tahini even more next time.  The tahini still jumped out at me when I tasted it, but the lemon juice didn't so that seems a good amount.  Can't imagine what it would be like with the full amounts listed.  I used 2 medium sized eggplants.

Very good but next time I will roast the garlic in tinfoil while eggplant is roasting.  I cut the lemon juice to about 3 TBS and topped with a little grated fresh parmesean cheese before serving with crackers.

My Friend is a Nutritionist and she always makes Baba Ganoush and serves it with Pita Chips.  I found this recipe and make it all the time.    I dno't put as much lemon juice (1/8th instead of the 1/4), and add a lot more garlic.  While roasting the eggplant I make bigger holes and push peeled garlic cloves. into the eggplant (about 4-5), they roast really well with the eggplant and taste really good when purreed into the baba ganoush

This recipe is great!  The only thing that took the last star and that I will adjust next time was that I found it slightly to acidic (too much lemon).  So, next time I will probably only do 1/8 cup lemon juice instead of 1/4 (which equals out to about the juice of one lemon).  Thanks for the great recipe!   Oh...and I also followed a youtube.com instructional video by chef Kamal on how to smoke the eggplant for the baba ghanoush  It was really easy and gave the dip that awesome smokey flavor!

Yummy!  I used a million of those slender, white Japanese eggplants that I grew in my garden this year, and it was great.  Perfectly seasonsed.  I did everything in my food processor and it came out nice and smooth, rich and creamy.  Seriously, I used about 18 of the white eggplants that were about 6 inches long on average and only about the diameter of a large cigar.  I roasted them in the oven as directed, but you could just as easily roast them on a grill or grill pan.  I liked this so much that I am roasting some additional eggplant to freeze for later to use in this recipe.

This is SO good!  I cooked my eggplant on the gas grill, charring the skin on high heat (rotating the eggplant every now and then) and then wrapping in foil to cook 30 min or so on medium. I saved all the juice in the foil, for the blender.  This stuff gets better as it ages a few days in the refrigerator, in my opinion.

This was fantastic! I made a few minor changes: 1. I wanted the real charred flavour found in some baba ghanoushes, so I cut 2 medium eggplants in half, and roasted them cut-side down at 500* for 45 minutes. 2. I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I left them out. 3. Since my eggplant was so roasted, it wasn't as watery, so it wouldn't have worked in a blender. I put everything in a bowl and used an immersion blender to mix. I just served this for dinner: Cooked rotini, sauteed diced red pepper, onion, mushroom and chicken breast, and toasted almonds, all tossed with the room-temperature baba ghanoush. Everyone thought it was great!

The recipe neglects to include CUMIN, an integral ingredient in Baba Ghanoush! Add at least 1 tsp for an authentic Middle Eastern flavor.  Otherwise, this is a good and easy recipe.

I found the recipe to be too lemony and perhaps heavy on the tahini.  With so few ingredients, it unforunate that it wasn't better.  It makes me wonder if the chef is using freakishly large eggplant.  For those looking for more flavor, grill the eggplant and add a cap-full of hickory-flavored liquid smoke for each eggplant mashed.  I believe the latter is the "secret" ingredient of restaurants.

This recipe turned out delish.  I must admit I prepared my eggplant differently. I washed two medium eggplant. Then I peeled them  long ways into thin stripes (not all the way peeled).  Then cut in half long ways, took the seeds out and drizzled with olive oil then roasted them.

This baba ghanoush was fantastic!  I`m so happy to be able to make this homemade now and will never go back to buying store bought.  I followed the directions exactly and was not disappointed.  It has a great smoky and garlicky flavour.  I used a blender instead of a food processor and it worked out great.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I used less tahini and lemon juice (about 2 T of each) after reading the other reviews and because I wanted to really taste the roasted eggplant flavor. It came out wonderfully! This is also a perfect base recipe for other add-ins like scallions or red pepper flakes or roasted bell peppers.

Delicious! So easy, only thing is that I would use slightly less garlic - granted the cloves I used were rather larger than normal.

I loved this recipe!  I will cut back to 1 clove of garlic when I make it again because the 2 cloves seemed to overpower the delicate eggplant.  I love a garlicy hummus, but baba is different.  It was wonderful, and even my 1-year-old enjoyed it!

Very good recipe with only one addition. I got this tip from a middle eastern cook book...I guess they don't have thgose special california egg plants either. But they recommended mashing the egg plant after u get it out of the oven and peel it. Which also means u want to use a little more eggplant to make up for juice loss and more olive oil to taste.

Awesome! I followed the advice of another reviewer and blackened the skin of the eggplant directly on my stovetop for a few minutes on each side. (I have a gas stovetop.) I then baked it for about 30 minutes. I also wasn't sure if my eggplant was thoroughly "done" after baking it, but even with it being slighty tough, it blended up for a great texture.  I will definitely be making this again - it wasn't that hard and SO delicious!  Only changes I'd make are to add more garlic (I love it so much...)

here is my favorite dip. If I have small eggplant I`ll bake hem according  the recipe , but for large size eggplant , I wrap it with foil coz if I did`t wrap them the result well be burned from the outside and raw inside, then 10 min before turn the oven off I remove the foil. the baking time depends on the size of the eggplant. some times if I don`t want to turn the oven on ,I put the whole egg plant in my farber ware steam pot it really saves my time and the flavor is almost the same (baked egg plat is just alittle better) . I like to sprinkle it with dried mint.

I love baba ganoush and will only add that I used one clove of garlic and it still stung my tongue.  I guess if my clove is bigger than normal it would function as two or even three small cloves.  That is the unfortunate thing about saying a clove, but there is no good measure for garlic.  I don't like the canned/jarred type, it does not taste fresh to me.  And garlic powder is not going to be better.  So maybe just start with one clove of gahlic and see how it tastes to you.

Excellent. I cut the eggplant in half and grilled it on the barbecue because it was too hot out to turn on the oven. I didn't measure anything, just did it to taste. It worked fine for everything except the garlic, which got much stronger after sitting in the fridge.

This recipe was almost perfect. I took another reviewers advice and squeezed out some of the liquid before I peeled it.  I also added extra lemon juice for a tangier flavor.

Great and simple. I did use two eggplants because what we had in the store was rather small and I didn't want to end up with a giant bitter one anyway. I followed every other instruction exactly ... except that I got busy doing some other stuff and ended up with the eggplants in the oven for an hour. 
I couldn't resist trying it as soon as it was done - still warm, even - and it was yummy yummy. Can't wait to take it to work tomorrow with the hummus and falafel I made today too!

I think it must be me, but this did not turn out at all the way I had hoped...It was just so bland.  I'm going to try again, next time I'm going to remove the seeds after roasting, up the amount of tahini, maybe add some paprika for some kick, and possibly some cumin, or Cavendar's Greek seasoning...

i was very underwhelmed by this recipe. it was watery, and too garlicy. i added some liquid smoke as suggested, which certainly helped. i think i will keep looking, although when paired with falafel, it wasn't too bad.

Overall not a bad recipe... mine came out slightly bitter but this is probably due more to my selection and handling of the eggplant than the recipe itself. It has a mighty garlic kick... garlic lovers like myself, be warned: I pressed two extra large cloves and it's plenty garlicky for me! I grilled my eggplant on high for 25 minutes, rotating  about every five as suggested by another reviewer, but this did not roast my eggplant all the way through and I ended up putting it in foil in the oven for another 20 minutes. Next time I would choose a smaller and hopefully sweeter eggplant and try to remove more of the seeds, which can contribute to the bitterness in these veggies. Good luck!

I thought this recipe was great!  Of course, I love foods that are heavy on the garlic.  I wondered why sesame seeds were added to a recipe with tahini (also sesame seeds), but it was a nice accent.  This is definitely a keeper.  I'm a lazy cook so I added the olive oil to the food processor.  :-)

This recipe was really quite gross.  I don't know if store bought Baba Ghanoush is some sort of hybrid dip, and THIS was supposed to be the real thing... but if this is what Baba is supposed to be... I will never eat it again.

Another alternative to putting the eggplan t over an open fire is to broil or grill the eggplant to get the smoky flavor for about 20 minutes or so, turning every 5 minutes (less if you are using japanese or asian long eggplants).

I looked at the reviews and decided to take different advice (knowing a little about the bitterness of eggplant). I decide to slice and salt the eggplant (rub salt on the slices) for a half hour- to remove the water. then I sliced the eggplant into french fry slices and sauteed it in olive oil until golden and soft. I added a little more salt and about a 1/4 teasoon of sugar to get rid of the bitterness. then I added the from a half of a large lemon, three tablespoons fresh olive oil, 1/5 cup of tahini, and another 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. and two cloves of fresh srushed garlic. I sort of tasted the salt and sugar as I was mixing, b/c I didn't want to add too much. It came out great!! 

BTW I left the skins on and mixed everything in the food processor- the skins added a little texture. The mixture thickened in the fridge.

Wow!  This was wonderful!  As good as or better than a fine Middle East restaurant, and much better than a deli tub.  The texture was very creamy, the taste--delicious.  The only change I made was to add the juice of one fresh lemon rather than measuring out lemon juice.  It was perfect.

Easy and delicious comfort food! I've made this twice now, and scoop it straight from the container onto pieces of wheat pita bread. Yum!!!

I thought this was a really yummy & easy recipe! I made it so I would have something healthy to eat at a Superbowl party - turned out quite nicely.  I roasted the garlic along with the eggplant and then doubled the amount of garlic - gave it a very nice flavor.  Next time, I will char the eggplant (as is done traditionally) to give it a more smokey flavor - or add just a little bit of Liquid Smoke.  Overall, a very nice recipe -- Thanks for sharing it!

Perfect simple recipe. Restaurant quality baba! I did not have sesame seeds but did not notice their absence. However, I could not wait three hours to eat it!

This recipe contains all of the basics of baba ghanoush.  If you are new to this dish, start with half the lemon juice and add to suit your taste.  Personally, I peel my eggplant before roasting.  To each their own.

I tend to be direct and too the point. Brilliant! I have never like supermarket or restaurant Baba Ghanoush. I make lots of vegi dishes for friends of mine and on this occasion decided to make Baba G. Brilliant, I ate more than they did. For a Baba G novice this was BRILLIANT. Thank you.

This was so bland! It had absolutely no taste. I added more lemon juice, several more garlic cloves and some cilantro which made it much better. I definitely won't be making this again!

This is absolutely delicious! I took the advice of TYEBUG and grilled the eggplant over my stove burner before roasting it in the oven. (I just stuck two skewers through the eggplant and held it over the burners until it was a bit charred.) It made a huge different, and added a lot of lovely, smokey flavor.

Very good, a little lemony but I am wondering if my eggplant was small? I added a good bloop of some vegan mayo and that smoothed the flavors together very nicely. Thanks!

To those of you who aren't sure you want to try this recipe because of the comments about "too much lemon juice", my advice to you is: try it!  Just add a little at a time until you get to where you like it. (Turns out I like it pretty close to what is called for. Also turns out that I'm fond of salt...)  Use a big eggplant, and if you can't char it over an open flame, just roast it, and then cheat by adding a drop of liquid smoke.  (Hey, it'll do!)  I'll be making this again!

I have prepared this recipes many times with a twist . . . to start, and after seasoning it with olive oil, salt and pepper, and garlic powder, I grill/fry the eggplant.  NOTE: When I want to add a bit of a kick, I also season the eggplant with dried chili pepper flakes.

I grill the eggplant until it starts to get a nice brown look to it and I can start to separate it with a fork.  I also leave the skin on which adds a great flavor and texture.

This has become a family favorite!

Great recipe! I roasted the eggplant on the stove top like some of the other reviewers recommended and used lime juice instead of lemon and added it to taste instead of putting in the whole 1/4 cup. I like it with a bit more texture, so I minced the eggplant with a chef's knife to keep it chunkier than a food processor then hand mixed everything together.

Mmm delicious! The taste of tahini, lemon juice, and garlic are already amazing. Now add smokey, roasted eggplant and it's to die for.

This particular recipe is good except it has a little too much lemon juice.

OMG!  I live in a part of Japan where garbanzo beans are scarce, so making hummus has been a real drag.  After making this on a whim I went out and stocked up on eggplants because this has become an instant favorite.  Try adding chili pepper or other herbs to change up the flavor!

This recipe has become a staple in my diet.  It's easy and delicious.  I use it as a topping for multigrain crackers for lunch.  It has helped wean me off my addiction to cheese, being a much healthier and yet very satisfying alternative.  I made it in large quantities while eggplants were in season and froze it: worked fine.

I must have done something wrong because this was so sour and bitter that I just ended up throwing it away.  Word of caution, add the lemon juice a little at a time until you've got it how you want it.  I guess my eggplant was a little on the small side, as there was WAY too much lemon juice, even though I followed the recipe to a T.

Found the lemon juice a bit too much. I will try 2 TBSP next time.  Also added 1/2 c sour cream and 2 TBSP light Miracle Whip and 1/2 TBSP sugar.  Next time I will omit the Miracle Whip and try plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I am used to a particular store brand and noticed that it had mayo and sour cream in the ingredient list.  May not be authentic Baba Ghanoush, but it is what I am used to!

I like this. I do always end up changing things to taste (more or less lemon/tahini/salt as I blend it all. My biggest suggestion would be to oil a cookie sheet with olive oil and then cut X hash marks all around the eggplant (I use 2). They should be relatively deep slits,almost like tic-tac-to...only closer (but not so that it falls apart). I always bake it for a longer period, rotating them as I go...I have had the best results when they look shriveled/brown on the outside, on all sides (and that takes longer than 40 min in my oven at 400). It is a good recipe though! I am just particular and want to mimic the grilled/charred flavor..

Wonderful recipe! I followed TYEBUG's directions for roasting the eggplant, everything else I did as written. The tartness from the lemon juice fades after refrigeration, and by day 2 it tasted even better. I tried eating it with a fresh red bell pepper - it was to die for- Amazing!

AMAZING!!! Thank you so much Winky for this recipe, it had been years since I had had good baba ganoush!!! I followed the recipe as written and was worried about ending up with bitterness problems as some other reviewers. I put the eggplant on a colander and collected the eggplant juices in bowl. At the end, I mixed the juices in and it gives it some extra eggplant flavor! My baba ganoush was not bitter at all, I thought it might be too sweet but with a bit of salt and the lemon juice, it was perfect!!!!

I grew up in a household where women would burn their fingertips peeling hot eggplants.   Fortunately, nowadays you can buy roasted, peeled eggplant in a jar from any of the Turkish food sites. A whole jar (over 1 lbs) of grilled, peeled, lightly salted eggplant (kozlenmis patlican) is $5.99 plus shipping.  I like the taste of the Sera brand best - but Tamek will do too. It is a good solution for those too busy to do the whole grilling, but love the taste of a good homemade appetizer (meze).

Eggplant has to be chopped with a knife one way first and then 90 degrees to make very small pieces.

Nothing wrong here except the portion size for the eggplant. Unless you are getting a massive eggplant, I highly suggest you double the number of eggplants you are getting. It should taste much more smokey and much less like hommous. Still not bad though.

This turned out amazing! What I also added was diced green peppers, white onion and tomatoes, as you would find it in the Middle East, it adds a nice crunch to it, without over powering it. Lastly, I topped it with a bit of olive oil and pomegranate molasses.

I recently had BabaGanoush and it is so delicious. Actually, I disliked eggplant until I ate this dish. One thing I want to suggest is to change the photo for this recipe. Ganoush is really almost white and the photo above takes away from it appeal.

Following the recipe exactly makes a good template for baba ghanoush, but I had to jazz this up with extra lemon juice, smoked paprika, and a bit of cumin. Not bad, but I know I can find better recipes for this dip.

Easy basic recipe. A good place to start. I know there is much discussion of eggplant roasting/skinning techniques. Alton Brown has a method where you just squeeze the eggplant out of the skin which seems to work ok.

Delicious and easy recipe...I used it as a dip w/ baby carrots and sliced cucumber.  For those who don't have tahini: I didn't want to make a run to the store, so I ground sesame seeds into a powder in my coffee grinder and then mixed in olive oil until it was a syrupy texture. I substituted this for tahini...came out great!

This recipe was great!  I also followed TYEBUG's instructions and cooked the whole egg plant directly over the heat--except for that I put mine on the BBQ until blackened, and then wrapped it in foil and put it back on the grill for another 15-20min.  It turned out great! And had a great smoky flavor.  I also saved the juice from the eggplant, and I think it made all the difference.

We enjoyed this, but thought it was a tad bland. We prefer something a little more zippy like Spiced Sweet Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. I made both for a dinner get-together. It is a nice option for those who do not prefer spicy food. With the leftovers, I mixed the two together and that was good, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was too tart.  The AMOUNT OF EGGPLANT is imperative for a good result.  Use a huge eggplant or two smaller ones.  Be cautious adding the lemon juice and tahini.  Taste before adding the full measure of lemon juice & tahini.  Be sure to STIR THE TAHINI in the jar before measuring out the amount needed.  I added mashed potatoes to counteract the sourness, but it didn't help much.

I agree with a previous review, great tahini is key. Otherwise you get a bitter burnt sesame taste. Other than that, a great recipe.

Great recipe!  I used an entire bulb of roasted garlic rather than 2 cloves of raw.  Roasting it gives you a really nice caramelized flavor, but it's much milder than when raw, so that's why I used so much more.  I also roasted the eggplant and garlic on a gas grill rather than the oven, but either would be great.  I never need to go to a Greek restaurant for good baba ganoush again!  Thank you so much!

I should have added a lot more garlic, but instead followed the instructions by the letter. The result was pretty bland. I'm sure with more garlic it would have been much better.

My family loves hummus and I've been making my own for many years but I wanted to try something new for a change. I read through all the tips for this recipe...Many thanks to Tyebug for the roasting technique. Before roasting, I pushed the garlic cloves into the eggplant (you pierce the eggplant with a paring knife and then push the garlic cloves in-depending on the size of the garlic you may have to cut them in half length-wise). Also, I used some of the juice that was collected after roasting, but not all of it because I was afraid it would make the dip too runny. We just had a lunch with this dip, tzatziki & hummus served with breads, pita and veggies...fantastic! Although the baba ghanoush was the mildest of the three dips, so it was somewhat overpowered by the others. Still enjoyable, though.

WoW!  We grilled an eggplant but didn't have a plan for it so I made this!  Fresh lemon juice, grilled eggplant, lots of salt and pepper, and the other ingredients as listed thrown in a food processor!  Perfect!

I really liked this dish. I took advice from others and let my eggplant drip in the coliandar for an hour. I scraped out the seeds and continued as the recipe stated. It was really yummy on flatbread.

Absolutely delicious! I used two medium sized organic eggplants because that's all that was available. I probably should have cooked the eggplant longer but I was eager to get going. After I removed the peel, I cut it up and covered it in salt for 30 minutes to avoid the bitterness so many people encounter. It must have worked because it came out wonderfully and none of the flavors seemed overwhelming.

This was good. Very watery.  It was a lot of time and ingredients were expensive.  I will buy my baba ghanoush next time.  The one in the container is much better.  Maybe with garlic or roasted red peppers added it would be better.  Needed something...

I have never had Baba Ghanoush before so I can't compare it to anyone elses, but this stuff is great!  I made it just like it was written, using the directions of other reviewers to roast it over my gas range.  I guess I should have removed the leave like things at the stem end...picture "flames" shooting out of my eggplant! LOL  Oh, well, it blackened just fine and then I roasted it in foil in the oven for 40 min. or so.  I used one med. lemon, so not sure if it was 1/4 cup or not, but it was just the right amount of tang.  I cant wait to have some for lunch tomorrow when it is chilled!

I make baba ghanoush often but I grill the eggplant on the stove-top with a small grill trap ( sorry don't know what you call it technically). It cooks in minutes and it has a very rich taste to it. Let it cool a bit before taking off the skin as you can burn your hands.

I added a little more garlic, and a little more olive oil while it was pureeing in the Cuisinart. That made it creamier. It was very yummy!

Did not add red pepper flakes as I don’t like them. The taste was ok but wasn’t Smokey enough. Oven roasted as don’t have grill. 
The  weird thing was that after carefully choosing Male eggplant  it was loaded with seeds!
Might make again

This was good. I served it with fresh bread as an appetizer alongside hummus and taziki. My guests loved it!
I was a little too heavy handed with the tahini (three heaping tablespoons), and even though I bought the "roasted" kind, it lent a slight bitterness to the overall flavor. In the future, I would put less.  My foods processor is broken, so I tried a blender, which made it slightly smoother than I was going for.

I always use this recipe but I follow the Greek Grandmother's method now that I have a gas stove again! Roasting the eggplant over an open flame just smells so good and tastes great in the end. I love the lemon, tahini and garlic as is. 
Thank you for this recipe.

I will make this again! ...but only because I added curry powder and just a bit of cayenne .  I never did end up adding the olive oil either, it was a great consistency with out it. I made this in my mini food processor on the 'chop' setting and it was supper easy.  I think you have to use a good tahini... I like the classic by the Mighty Sesame company, purchased thru Amazon...

The first time I made it I followed the directions and it was good however, I wasn't crazy about the sesame seeds. I've made it many times since and I omit the sesame seeds. Just personal preference. Excellent and easy recipe.

I roasted the eggplants in the oven like one of the reviewer mentionned. Once the eggplant is roasted, the inner flesh simply falls off and you are left with the outer skin, put everything in the blender!  Oh my god, best stuff ever!

This is my go-to eggplant dip recipe. It has nice texture, rich flavor and it is simple to make. The only change is I roast the garlic in the oven for about 5 minutes.

Too much lemon juice in this one and not enough char flavor.  You might want to grill or fire roast the egg plant on this to get a more authentic flavor.  Cut that lemon juice way down or it comes out watery and tastes like lemons only.

I used to work at a Lebanese restaurant and I loved the baba, but was always hesitant to make it myself, for fear that it would disappoint. This was my first time making it and this recipe was SPOT ON! It tasted even better than I was hoping for! I did toast my sesame seeds. But that was the only thing I tweeted. Excellent! I will be making this regularly now!

Amazing! I used Tyebug’s fire roasted idea below and I think this might be the BEST Baba I have ever had!

the recipe you gave is good, but we as Lebanese we do it on a weekly basis, i do it on direct fire in a roasting pan without any oil nor spraying oil, your pan will tan but keep one only for Baba Ghanouj(the name means daddy is kind of cuddly) we squeeze the eggplant after cooking by hand, this way it doesn't have to sit for a long time. We do not put any sesame seeds since the Tahini is sesame cream itself. we usually eat it to accompany any barbecue meat!! Enjoy our Lebanese Traditions!

Delicious! I scaled up for three aubergines/eggplants, but kept the tahini at just over 1/3 cup for our taste.

With these proportions it's very "sesame-y" as for my taste, might use less Tahini  next time. And it didn't come out that fluffy as it looks in the picture, it's more of a "hummus-y" type of texture. Any suggestions how to make it fluffier? 
Overall, it's good, the taste I was looking for.

I too made this and it turned out great however I too found a lack of quantity a problem.  The size of the eggplant and garlic cloves are arbitrary.  I had 2 eggplants and I could see the other ingredients would be too much so I adjusted by taste.  I did roast the eggplant on the gas range like another viewer suggested and would recommend it. I made it a second time and measured. 3 medium eggplants weighing 1073 grams (38 oz) in the store netted 398 grams (13.85 oz) of cooked eggplant flesh without the chard skin. I then seasoned to taste. I cut the sesame seeds to 1.5 TBSP, Tahini 1/8 to 3/16 cup. I used 1/4 to 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice and just shy of 1 TBSP of garlic pulverized with salt in a mortar.  Also the blender or food processor purred it so instead I cut the eggplant up and mashed it with a fork. This improved the texture.  I topped it all off with 1.5 TBSP olive oil partially mixed in and garnished with fresh parsley.  This made about 2 cups.  At first you taste the roasted eggplant with a hint of Tahini, then you get the slightest sense of garlic followed by the lemon juice, perfect!  I hope by giving someone quantities for the eggplant and garlic you will have a better idea on quantity. I suggest adding the Tahini, garlic and lemon juice slowly to your tastes.  Don't roast the garlic it should be raw, just be careful how much you use. Make sure to get Tahini and not Trader Joe's Tahini sauce because it is already seasoned. I had no problem with the seeds and bit

Perfect recipe. I held back in the lemon juice at first because another reviewer thought it was too lemony. Not true. In the end I used the full amount after trying less and tasting it. Needs a good amount of salt.

Very good recipe. I did not find the ice bath to be  useful. Let it cool before  handling and be careful. It's essential to drain (squeeze out)  all the free, "juices" before blending. I find an immersion blender works well for this recipe. Much less clean up than a typical blender.

After I cooked a 9" eggplant and peeled it (salvaging every drop of non-peel) I had so little eggplant that I cut way back on all the other ingredients.  I ended up with less than a cup of finished product.  I was delicious, but  it was barely enough for two people to share.

My favorite baba ghanoush was at the Happy Greek restaurant, so after looking over these recipes, I looked up there menu and saw that they add in roasted red peppers, kalamata olives,  feta cheese, and roasted garlic, so I blended this all up along with some fresh parsley, and the ingredients listed above, and drizzled olive oil to top- SO good!  I liked it better than the restaurants!  :)

I have never been a fan of baba ghanoush, but I thought I would give this a try. It is delicious! I can not stop eating it.  I love garlic, so I doubled the amount. And I just dumped in what was left in my tahini jar which I am pretty sure was more than the recipe called for. It turned out great. And was so incredibly easy to make.

It was terribly bitter, and bland. I had to add quite a bit more lemon juice and salt to make it even remotely palatable. Maybe I had eggplants that were too bitter, but mine turned out awful.

After reading the reviews I made this with half the amount of lemon juice and tahini and it was very good. I have since made it with the stated amount of lemon and tahini but using 3 eggplants. I roast them as directed along with the garlic which is definitely better cooked. The result is delicious. But the recipe as given is way too heavy on lemon and tahini so I can only give it 3 stars.

Loved this!  followed almost exactly.  Added lemon juice slowly and tasted several times (because it seemed like it 1/4 cup might be too much)  I ended up using a little less lemon juice.  At the end, I added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke to get more of a smoky flavor.

I am not an eggplant lover, but I made this for my teenage son who was convinced he'd tried it at a friend's and liked it. He doesn't like eggplant either so I didn't tell him what was in it and he loved it! Great after-school snack. I must admit, I like it too! Now if I could just figure out to do with the rest of this big container of tahini! Thanks for the recipe Winky

I don't think there is neccessarily anything really wrong with this recipe. Might just be, I don't think tahini can be masked in hummus or eggplant dip and it is really just a flavor I don't care for. This recipe was no exception. I cut the eggplant in half and roasted in my NuWave oven. That was super easy. It only needed 18 minutes total and the water peel method was very quick too. I tried to blend the other ingredients by themselves to grind the sesame seed, while the eggplant roasted. However, once I tasted the final dip, I realized the crunchiness of the sesame seeds or eggplant seeds was still there. So, I dumped the dip back into the blender with the olive oil already stirred in. At this point everything was completely blended, but now it looked and tasted very much like tahini. Going to search for recipes to use this stuff in, now, because it made over 2 full cups of dip.

First, I followed the recipe, but after trying the end product, I decided to add more lemon juice. It definitely made a difference and added the necessary tartness.

My eggplant turned to mush according to the above directions. The cooking time is too long, also there is no specifics as to how long to soak the eggplant once it's done.

This is so simple and delicious! It's perfect with a toasty pita, veggies, and a tall drink. The recipe calls for olive oil, but actually I've tried it with and without, and it does not effect the flavor or consistency to leave it out.

This was good, but I wish I had seeded the eggplant first. I found it to be a little bitter and not creamy enough (next time I'll leave it in the food processor a little longer).

This looked good on paper, but didn't go over well once I made it. I cut the lemon so it wouldn't be terribly sour but the flavor was still disappointing. My family was a lot happier when I roasted an eggplant and blended it with a bit of mayo, a little sugar (I know that sounds strange, but it took off the bitter edge), and a dash of salt and pepper.

I tried this recipe today, and it is a good recipe. I would probably recommend maybe 1/8 cup of lemon juice for those who don't like the lemony taste. But even with 1/4 cup, it still tastes very good. I also added parsley to the mix, and it was INCREDIBLE!!!

I made this as directed, except made sure to drain the roasted eggplant really well. It still came out with a bitter taste, and too lemony. It was edible though, and healthy. For all the effort, I don't think I'll be making it again.

I hesitate to review this as I've only eaten baba ganoush once prior to making this recipe, but for me there was too much lemon.  I'm sure the amount of lemon juice should be adjusted based on the size of the eggplant, but having never made this before I trusted the amount stated.  We offset the tang with some cumin and red pepper flakes for a spicier dip.

This recipe is pretty good. I like that it was easy. I find tahini has a very strong flavor so next time I won't put as much as the recipe calls for. I added and a dash of cumin and cayenne which amped it up a bit.

This recipe is fantastic! It was my first attempt at making baba ghanoush and I was really pleased with the results. Everyone at work loved it too. Since I like a textured baba ghanoush, next time I would probably reserve some of the eggplant, mash it, then mix it in with the puree.

This recipe is very good, I made it several times and each time it was a hit. I recently changed up the recipe and used char grilled and blackened eggplant slices that had been salted and rinsed, this added a very good flavor to the dish.

I did not care for this recipe!! I followed the directions perfectly and.... I didn't use a traditional large eggplant, instead I used small stripped purple ones, that could be what was wrong. The baba lacked that traditional, yummy, smoky taste I'm accustomed to.

I used two of the thin long eggplants for this recipe, needed like a teaspoon of salt!!, and only about one tablespoon of store-bought lemon juice.  I usually like a tablespoon more tahini than what recipes say...  FAMILY LOVED IT!!

I love Baba Ghanoush and have made it numerous times.  You can put the eggplant in a toaster oven and roast...so easy to char it that way.  I would also recommend using toasted sesame oil instead of the sesame seeds.  A much better flavor and easier to find.  Don't be afraid of the lemon juice...it is wonderful.

So Great!! My first time making baba ghanoush and I love it. I didn't poke enough holes in the eggplant and it split in half. Also, be aware that the juices are slippery so make sure you have a good grip on it when transferring from baking sheet. I almost dropped mine on the floor. I will be making this again...but I'll double it next time! =)

Great recipe! I did not have any tahini - so I substituted some homemade almond butter. Tasted pretty good. I will make sure to ave some tahini on hand the next time.

This is tricky to rate.  I thought it was too bitter, but I don't think the eggplant was to blame.  I'm fairly sure that the flavor I disliked came from the tahini.  I'm not very familiar with how baba ghanoush should taste, so it's possible that this is a very good recipe and that I just happen not to like baba ghanoush.

I'm not sure what happened, but this didn't turn out for me at all.  It tasted like bland eggplant pablum and not at all like restaurant baba ghanoush.  I may try the alternate roasting methods posted by other reviewers for a deeper flavor. It was edible but not great.

Excellent and so simple.  I used two medium sized eggplants and roasted them on my gas grill outside for about 30 mins to give them a nice smokey flavor.

Good recipe but could still be simpler! I cut the peeled eggplant in big chunks and microwave it until it's very soft (add a bit of water first). Allow it to cool, then pour off the water and put all the ingredients in the food processor and proceed as the recipe directs. This skips all the charring, which I don't like anyway. The ingredients are fine as listed, but you should taste as you go along to see how lemony you want it. I don't add any olive oil. You can skip the sesame seeds.

This was just ok.  Probably wouldn't make it again.

Not great.  I made it as directed and found the tahini to be really over-powering in it.

This was very good. I don't like the flavor of tahini and substitute white beans when making hummus. I did the same here and it was very good. I also added a little extra garlic and some fresh basil.
