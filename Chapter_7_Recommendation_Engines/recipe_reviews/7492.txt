I have made a similar recipe for years, but I combine the cake mix with 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter and one egg.  To the softened cream cheese, I add 1/2 cup of melted unsalted butter, 2 eggs, and only 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  I also top it with 1/2 cup of chopped pecans before baking 35-45 minutes.  Everyone begs for this recipe!

I made this in 1999, when V. Monte originally had it posted on "AllRecipes.com presents Cakerecipe.com." (Does Cakerecipe.com still exist?) It goes by many names, and has many variations --chocolate, pumpkin, etc.(see Paula Deen's recipes on FoodNetwork). Don't overbake this! The word "cake" is deceiving, so when you bake this don't think something's wrong when it stays gooey--that's exactly how it's supposed to be. It is a soft, gooey, bar-like dessert that, while tasty, was much too sweet for my liking. It was okay, but after making this in '99, I didn't consider it a "keeper," and I never made it again.

I turned this cake into a Thanksgiving Day dessert by adding a can of pumpkin to the cream cheese mixture, along with a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg and used vanilla in lieu of the almond extract. I suspect you could let your imatination run wild with this delicious base. Although there were several other desserts on the table, this one was "gobbled" (sorry, dumb joke) up by everyone! Thanks so much V.Monte!!!!

This was fantastic.  I baked it for a little less than the recipe called for, maybe 5-10 minutes less.   Next time I will make sure that I don't forget to hit the sides of the pan with the cooking spray, I wasn't paying attention and only sprayed the bottom, and the cake really stuck to the sides.  Besides that, it was a wonderful dessert.

I have made this dessert several times recently for large groups of people, and everyone has loved it.  I also think 4 cups of sugar is too much, so I used 3. Next time I will only use 2.5.

I made this for my inlaws over the weekend. I reserved some of the crust mix and spinkled it on top of the cream cheese mixture to add a little more visual appeal. Everyone loved it and said "it was a keeper".

A simple recipe with great results! It was easy and quick. I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand, so I substituted a white cake mix. It turned out great!

Yum!  Turned out more like a thick bar cookie than a cake, but it's delish!  I baked mine about 5-7 minutes less than recipe said - it was browned by then.  Thanks!

Wonderful treat with coffee! This turns out more like a desert bar than a cake and a perfect passing dish for a breakfast buffet/luncheon.I whipped this up in my kitchen aid mixer in litterally minutes. I made two changes because the cake mix is plenty sweet itself. I cut back on the powdered sugar and used only 2 1/2 cups and used 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of almond. Turned out beautiful!! I only baked for 40 minutes as it was ready, start checking at 30 minutes. Should come out of the oven still a bit soft on top. I would avoid baking this in a glass or pyrex pan, the bottom could easily burn.

This is an awesome recipe that is more like cookie bars than cake. I got this recipe from my grandma with the following changes, make it this way and it will be 'to die for'. Line your pan with foil. Make the crust as directed. Add another stick of butter and 2 cups of chopped pecans to the filling, skip the vanilla extract, use about 3 cups powdered sugar. Cook for 45 min to 1 hour, just until browned, and let cool, wrap in the foil and refrigerate overnight. Next day slice into bars and enjoy.

Fantastic!!  I am 9 months pregnant, and boy did this recipe hit the spot for my sweet craving.  I also cut down the sugar (2 cups) as recommended by some others and added 1/4 c lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture.  Gave a lovely tang to offset the sweetness.  Couldn't quite wait for the cake to cool, have never had gooey butter cake before and was dying of curiosity, and was amazed at the scrumptios chewy crust- hope this remains the same even when cool. Baby and I thank you again!!

Made this recipe for my youngest sons birthday.  I read many reviews before making it. This recipe was beyond easy & quick. After reading many reviews before hand I decided to pretty much stick to the recipe with the exception of using vanilla extract instead of almond, simply because vanilla is what I had on hand. I braced myself for the warnings about it being too sweet....well, the cake turned out fantastic! My cooking time was pretty close to 45 min in a 9x13  pan. As far as sweetness, I think it boils down to personal preference, it was quite sweet but ice cream or milk helped to balance it out. However,  I could easily imagine using less sugar & it still tasting scrumtious. Also mixing the bowl that contains the cream cheese for @ least 3 min as it states (it should thicken) is important to the layers cooking more separately & not all coming together during the cooking process. This is a very tasty dessert, my husband & kids loved it & so did I!! The bottom layer more like a bar, top is more of a moist cake texture. Now that I have followed the recipe almost by the book, I now feel more confident to be more creative with it next time:). Thanks V. Monte!

My husband says to give it 5 stars...but I do find it too sweet even though I cut the sugar amount in half.  I will definitely make this again and look forward to trying it with lemon flavoring.

The best thing about this recipe is how easy and quick it is to make.  It is good but very sweet, as others already warned.  I used a 1-lb. box of powdered sugar which, according to the box, is 1/4 cup shy of the 4 cups the recipe calls for, but I don't think I would have wanted any more powdered sugar in it.  I think I will try it again but with some of the flavor variations that other reviewers have suggested.  Who knows, with some tweaking, I may come back with a 5-star rating.  I sprayed the bottom and sides of the pan very liberally with PAM and there was absolutely no problem with it sticking.  I baked it for only 40 minutes and even that was almost too long. Overall, I'm very pleased with this recipe and it's a keeper for me.

A friend and I made this dessert for the first time at Thanksgiving.  We have one word for it... FABULOUS!!  Next time I'll shave 5-10 minutes off the baking time.  It got a little too brown on top.

This is more of a bar cookie than a cake. I thought it was very good and definitely SWEET! Which is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5. I almost never cut a 9x13 pan into 24 small pieces, but I did this time, any bigger would be too much. I used egg substitute and fat free cream cheese, if I made it again I would probably try to cut the powdered sugar down a bit.

The cake itself was good but way to sweet for our taste.  I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar down to 3 cups but that was still way too sweet.  I still have half the cake left from 3 days ago, and with two growing boys, that is not a good sign.  It was nice and gooey and if I make again, I will cut the sugar way down.  Thanks for letting us try.

I actually had to throw this cake out. I used land o lakes butter and the crust was excellent, but the topping tasted like pure sugar crystals and was unedible.

Followed the recipe to the 'T', but for some reason it got overdone (baked for 45 minutes at 350). It still tastes DELICIOUS, but next time I'll try decreasing my baking time to 40 minutes.

Excellent!  It brought back memories fo growing up in St. Louis and having Gooey Butter cake on weekend mornings.  I served it at a gathering for some of my east coast friends who had never heard of it, and I think they are now hooked!

I just made this and oooohhhh how very good!  It reminds me of the one Paula Dean makes.  This is pretty simple and so classic!  Love it!

this turned out really well. I too baked it for about 7 minutes less then the time suggested. It was perfect. I also put only 3 cups of sugar instead of 4. I think the 4th cup would have made it too sweet. My son said it was "too rich" The almond taste is so pronounced, I think this would be great with pears baked on top of it....next time.

An easy and people pleasing receipe.  The almond extract really makes the difference.  It is impossible to only eat one piece!

Gooey Butter Cake was invented here in my home town of St. Louis, MO. With all the specialty  bakeries you don't dare bring one to a party that isn't stellar. With that said, I would put this recipe up against any of the bakeries. You do need to keep a close eye on the crust, in my oven about 30 to 35 min was plenty. In fact maybe just a touch too much as the crust got a little darker, not burnt, just darker than I would have liked. I am going to try one with browned butter, pumpkin, lemon and candied ginger. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like this recipe.

Cook time on this is way too long.  I checked it 10 minutes early, and it was already overdone.  Ruined the cake.  Will use another recipe next time.

HUGE hit at a BBQ this weekend. I omitted the almond but it still turned out stellar. Next time I'll try it with Butter cake mix. I'd like to do a pumpkin version in the fall.

I just discovered gooey cake at a church luncheon about 6 months ago. It was a great dessert and I meant to look it up, but kept forgetting. I found this recipe last week randomly and was very surprised at how easy it was and how few ingredients it required. I have made it a few times...once using a plain yellow cake mix (very good) and every other time using a golden butter cake mix (this is preferred by my family). My family and I found this to be a heavenly dessert and just like we remembered from church. I will be making this for family functions and cookouts from now on!

This is not "Paula Deen's Recipe!" Yes, she makes them, but these have been around for years. My sister first made these 25 years ago & they were called St. Louis Ooey-Gooey Cake. My family just calls them Gooey Bars. I love Paula, but she can't claim the recipe. :)

Sorry, Gooey Butter Cake was not invented by Paula Deen. Reviewer Yummy has the correct information. This was invented in St. Louis in the late 1930's or early 1940's, depending on which story you go with. It's a staple in most local St. Louis bakeries, as well as the in-store bakeries of the local grocery chains. It IS a coffee cake, not a dessert cake, and in the store-bought versions the bottom is a little on the dry or chewy side, often more like a stollen base. The top is definitely for those with a sweet tooth. Thanks for posting this, V. Monte!

Gooey Butter Cake originated in St. Louis in the 1930's when a baker made a mistake in making a coffee cake.  Everyone loved it and it took off from there.  Yummmmy!

YUM! This was very tasty, very rich and sweet, so you can't eat too much at a time. I didn't have almond extract so I just used vanilla instead and it turned out delicious. I would love to try it with different cake mixes, chocolate would probably be SO good.

i overcooked this a bit, so it wasn't all that gooey, but it was still ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. i forgot the extract, and only used 3 3/4 cups of sugar because i didn't want to open another box. still yummy.

this is the best cake i've ever made supposedly.  i use vanilla extract, pillsbury yellow cake mix, philly cream cheese, and exactly one box of powdered sugar and it turns out perfectly.  make sure you push the dough up on the sides a bit to tell when it's done more easily.

This was really good...definately satisfied my sweet tooth!  Very rich too.  For the topping, I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of almond extract, added 1/2 cup of melted butter and cut the powdered sugar down to 2 cups. Baked for 35 minutes and it was VERY gooey!   Thanks for the recipe!  The whole family enjoyed this.

I made a pumpkin version of this for the holidays - to the filling I added 1 15 oz can pumpkin, another 1/2 c butter, 1 tsp cinnamon & nutmeg.  It was outstanding!  Like so many have said, it is a very rich recipe - had the consistency of pumpkin fudge, really - but it is a crowd pleaser, indeed!

First time making this. I did change a couple things. I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the filling cuz I am a chocoholic, I only had 1 egg for the filling so I added about 1/4 cup of whole milk to add a bit of moisture since I omitted an egg and added the cocoa powder.

It IS very sweet so I will decrease the powdered sugar next time by a cup but OMG it is delicious!

This was way too sweet for me.  If I were to make it again I'd cut out some of the confectioners sugar.  Also, I only had an 8x11 pan and it was too thick and didn't set up well.  Definitely use a 9x13.

I am a dessert snob.  Just want to give you a point of reference.  I made this today, following the crust directions exactly.  When I got to the part about 4 cups of confectioner's sugar,  "oh no"  I had one cup. I used one cup with the package of cream cheese and then added just one egg to the topping instead of two. Baked it for 30 minutes in a 325 convection oven.   "heaven".

This is addictive.  i live alone and I hardly go three or four days without one in the house.  My grandchildren and my daughter love it.  My co-workers and my church members and neighbors love it.  Its easy to make, its fun to make.  I tried it with yellow mix first.  Then devil's food, then triple fudge.  Then I tried a store brand devil's food mix that seems to be more moist and easier to press in the pan.  O yea, I swap out and combine vanilla/almond flavorings.  Grease the bottom of the pan with a softened stick of butter and then put about a half-a-cup of grated coconut in the topping.  Again, addictive and in demand.

I don't normally bake so I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was amazing!   Since he's on a bit of a diet I thought I would half all the ingredients for the cream cheese topping. (I only ended up using two eggs for the entire cake). It turned out great this way, I think it would have been too sweet with all of the second layer.   Also topped it with freshly cut up strawberries! I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

I should have listened to the reviews that said 2-3 cups powdered sugar were plenty!  I used 4 cups - and while it was good and people ate it, it was just too sweet....and I never say that!  I would make again, but next time, I'll probably only use 2 cups!

This is a great, easy cake that's super sweet and creamy. As another reviewer mentioned, this is actually a Paula Dean recipe. I add about one teaspoon of vanilla to my bottom crust and follow the rest of the recipe exactly, baking for approx. 45 minutes. The cake tastes buttery and rich; a small piece is enough, so it goes a long way. Very easy to make.

This is quite good, though very, very sweet. You really can't eat more than a small piece each time, but wow is that piece good while you're eating it. The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is that as good as this is, my family and I were just unable to finish off the pan (even though we've been working at it for awhile) because they're just that sweet and rich. If I could give it four and a half I would, since that fact doesn't really deserve a full star off. I'm tempted to try a bit less sugar next time because of this, though I don't think I would cut it in half as some have. Mine was baked to perfection at 35 minutes. This is also more like a bar cookie than a cake, despite the name. I do think this would also be quite good with other cake mixes and even other extracts to change the flavor slightly, and would definitely make this again. Just keep in mind that this is an extremely sweet, rich dessert!

Was told it was like “crack” – I am assuming that was a COMPLIMENT!?! 

I did what others suggested: DOUBLED the recipe and added some milk to cake mix part to make more moist, also used a Chocolate Mix.  Added a little more Almond extract, and LESS Powdered sugar, and put crushed pecans on top. Used a smaller, deeper glass dish and then I got the rave reviews “can’t get enough” when I sent it to the fire station with my husband! They said out of all of the desserts I send, this one tops them ALL !

This was not as gooey or buttery as the title suggests.  It has a cheesecake topping and the "cake" part was actually crust like.  It tasted alright, but just wasn't what I thought the title suggested.

Was very disappointed with this cake for all of the time,calories, etc, It did not do it for us. My husband who really loves his cake, had one piece and told me to dump the rest. Will not try this cake again.

I have been making this recipe for years. My 20 year old son doesn't like any cakes except for this one. He has asked for this cake for every one of his birthdays since he was 17 years old. Every time I have a party or am invited to a party, I have to make this cake--love it!!!

this cake is too sweet. i will try making this cake again, with half the sugar. i might have overbaked it a little- the top became a hard crust, but it tasted good and added extra texture to the cake. the cake is rather plain beyond the sweetness, though.
I poked holes and drizzled strong coffee over it, then chilled the cake. It tasted good, not as sweet and had more flavour.

This is the most common Gooey Butter Cake recipe. In St. Louis and the St. Louis area this is a favorite! The name of cake may be misleading; it is not a dessert cake but more of a coffee cake and can be served for all meals and is even good with ice cream.

This is a huge hit with everyone! It's also easy to make. Top it with vanilla ice cream to balance out the richness. I've heard of adding a banana to the secondary mixture but I haven't tried it yet.

Great recipe!  We just loved this treat!  It was more like bars than cake - I could make it every week.  The changes I made were I used Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix & 1 tsp almond extract, also I think softening the margarine would be enough.

Tastes pretty good (very sweet). I baked it for 45 min.  Turned out pretty well but there is a hard crust on the top.  Might make again.

I have made this cake twice now and it's a big hit. I used vanilla extract instead of almond and added crushed pecans to the top. Delicious!

Everyone loves this dessert!  I cut into small squares and placed in paper cup cake lines.  It made for a nice presentation and easy to eat on the go at parties.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sugar a little!

This is a wonderful recipe as is, but I made several altercations and it turned out even more fabulous than this original version.  Perhaps cinnamon would be a nice addition?

This is an amazing recipe. I followed some of the others advice and cut the powdered sugar down to 3 cups and its awesome. Also, used a fork to poke lots of holes in the cake pressed on bottom to keep the cake moist. It worked like a charm. I also chose not to sprinkle confectioners sugar on top as it is already super sweet. Just a small piece is a good sugar rush. A glass of cold milk with this is awesome.

I have been making this desert off this website for about 10 years using this exact recipe however, when I originally made it revery guest I had complained it was too sweet and no one finished their piece. by cutting the sugar to two cups and baking for 30 minutes you will have an astounding dessert that will leave people begging for more

I have made this twice since I found the recipe.  I am no baker, but this was so easy I couldn't mess it up.  This is a delicious cake and I will continue to make it.  If you cant stand sweets, leave this recipe alone.  It is very sweet and will satisfy any sugar craving that you may have.

I rarely make it because it's so sweet but I do get cravings for it all the time! I've made this about 4 times and my tip is to not overtake this! It's supposed to be gooey on the inside and a warm brown color on the outside. I have received many compliments on it every time I make it  I made it for a dessert auction and it sold for $120 :)

I made this and followed some reviews while doing so. I cut the powdered sugar in half and added some pecans on top. I liked it, it has a better flavor the second day but my family didn't care for it. My son actually said it was too sweet.

Actually, this recipe has been around a very long time. In the late 60s and 70s, my mother made this fairly regularly. I have to give it 5 stars to honor my mom and all the mothers of baby boomers who baked this delight!

The filling was terribly...'eggy' and I followed the direction. It didn't taste bad, it just had a very unpalatable texture. The cake crust was fantastic, though. I was able to scoop out the cream cheese and replace it with ice cream and it was great!

Easy and delish. I omitted the almond, as I had none and used lemon extract. It was great. Today I am going to make it, but use a choc cake mix instead. We will see. I bet it's delicious though.

I've been making, using the same ingredients, minus about half of the sugar. However, ya'll  work WAY too hard at this. If you go ahead and mix all of the ingredients, it still comes out just like you'd made the crust and filling separate. That's why I only gave it 4 stars....you're working too hard.

All I gotta say is...amazingly delicious! Not that huge of a sweets fan, but this was yummy, yummy and did I mention Yummy?  It is so NOT good for you, but dang it, lets be honest..we all love butter and no matter how you rationalize it to yourself...you gotta love this cake!  Thanks for sharing!  It is a keeper in our house!

Excellent recipe.  The only substitution I did was used Vanilla extract as I do not like Almond, personal preference only.  Fantastic recipe, easy to assemble and bake.  This is a great recipe for a large gathering.

I thought this was good (but nothing exceptional) - my husband thought it was excellent.  I'm glad I read the reviews, because 4 cups of sugar would have been waaaayyy too much!  I used 2 cups, and will probably cut it down to 1.5 cups next time.  It's very easy and quick to make - and I think you can probably use any flavor cake mix you have on hand - as a matter of fact, I might try it with spice or carrot cake mix next time, just to change it up a bit.  I used the almond extract the recipe calls for, and it was a very nice touch.  When I make it with a different cake mix, I will probably substitute vanilla instead.  I will keep this recipe to have on hand when I need a quick brunch dish or when we have overnight guests.

Made almost sugar free by using 1/2 C stevia powder and 3/4 C coconut sugar. I also added some cinnamon & used vanilla instead. Came out very sweet but not too sweet. Just right. Might make completely sugar free by using a sugar free box cake mix. Was done in 30 mins. Oh I also added 1/4 C extra melted butter to the Cream cheese mixture before baking. Very addicting!

This recipe is one of the best and easiest desserts I have ever made. I do bake  it for less time than the recipe calls for.  Baking it for about 30 minutes is just right for a 9 x 13 pan.

Great recipe...very simple.  I had read the review prior to making this and someone had mentioned the listed cooking time was too long.  I am very glad I took note of this because 45-50 minutes is way too long.  I pulled mine at 30 minutes and depending on how chewy you like the crust I would start checking it at 25 minutes. I also only used 1/2 the amount of almond extract but added 1/8 tsp of vanilla extract.  My co-workers are enjoying it as we speak!!!

Oh yes, this is delicious!  The only change I made was to use 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4.  I can't wait to try it again with pumpkin.  We devoured this!

I made this for the first time yesterday and it was DELICIOUS! The only thing is make sure you do not put too much almond extract, it is very sweet and very good.... YUM

This is a sweet, yummy dessert. I should have spread the cake mix mixture up the sides of the pan because my cakes ended up having more crust than goo. I only used 3 cups of sugar per other reviews, which could also account for the goo shortage. Had to use vanilla in place of almond extract. Only baked about 40min and probably could have gone 5min less and still have been okay. Will make this again and again!

Awesome cake.  Does not look as good as it tastes.  Believe it or not, the longer it sits (3 days) the better it tastes.  This must have been caused by using a high quality butter.

My daughter's mother-in-law here in Chattanooga makes this recipe, although she uses four eggs rather than three. Local grocery stores sell it from their delis.Old-timers refer to it as "Chess Squares."

This is the first recipe I have tried from Allrecipes and although the concept sounded delicious, it was very easy to make, and even easier to clean up after.. it turned out EXTREMELY sweet!!  I wish I would have read the previous reviews on lightening up on the sugar. The cake is cooling right now so hopefully that will help.  Otherwise, it is almost too sweet to be eaten.  I would try to make it again with half of the sugar.

I made this and took it to work. I do alter recipes to kind of create my own thing... but I had several people beg for the recipe.  Before I took it into work, my husband ate 3 pieces and told me to get it out of the house before it killed both of our diets!!  It lasted less than 2 hours at work!!  Wonderful. Thank you!

This is very simple and good.  If I were to make a Gooey Butter Cake again it would be a variation of this for example Paula Deen's Elvis Gooey Butter Cake which has peanut butter and bananas.

This was very good, and I brought it in for the guys at work, and they all loved it, although they did say it was very very rich and very sweet. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did cut the sugar to 3 cups, and think next time I will cut it back to 2 cups. It was very gooey!

Cut the sugar in half and it's perfect. Maybe a fresh lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I have always loved Gooey Butter Cake.  I didn't realize it was a St. Louis specialty, as I am from that town!  I did cut the sugar back to 3 Cups even though I have a huge sweet tooth.  But, so many other reviewers were recommending that, so I caved into the peer pressure.  I also only needed to cook it for 30 minutes, and it was absolutely perfect.  I did add a bit of powdered sugar to the top to make it pretty.  Yummy!  Perfection!

As the other reviewers stated ...this is more of a cookie bar then cake. I read some of the negative reviews about too much sugar, so I decided to use only one cup of sugar in the topping. That seemed to work well. A unique desert.

Cake was really gooey and sweet as promised.  I wish I had read a few more of the reviews before I made it myself...I agree, it was overly sweet and would have cut down on the sugar by probably half.  I didn't have any almond extract and used a full tsp of vanillla.  Next time I think I'll add shaved coconut, too- maybe to add a little more texture.

I made the following changes:  used white cake mix instead of yellow, no extract at all in the egg/sugar mixture (used a dab of milk), and only about 3 cups sugar.  Only baked for 30 minutes and mine was lightly browned on top.  These taste very rich and go great with a cup of milk.  I think this would be very good served chilled as well.

I debated between this recipe and one with chocolate chips, so I sprinkled 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over half of the cake.  I also used pure almond extract which gave it a wonderful flavor! It was delicious!  Everyone loved it for breakfast!

Just be warned, these are not like cake; rather more like a bad cookie.  That being said, these are SOOO good and easy.  I make them every year at Christmas time, and every year I get rants and raves.  My only suggestion is to be sure to use pure almond extract, as they aren't the same with the imitation stuff.  I've also seen this recipe tailored to regular cookies and I've been itching to try them as well.

Excellent. This was a hit with my family and our dinner guests. I would like to try it with vanilla or maybe lemon extract next time.
