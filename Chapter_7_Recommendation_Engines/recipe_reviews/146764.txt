If you like this kind of salad you'll like this. I liked the crunch of the peas and celery in this. It was easy to put together. I don't like Splenda so I used a Tbsp of sugar, a teaspoon at a time, and taste testing as I added it. I also used a 12 oz bag of pasta instead of the 8 oz. Thanks for the post!

Very quickly and easy to make. The kids gobbled it down. A little sweet for my taste, next time add the Splenda a little at a time. I also added some olives to it and it sold out!!. Mahalo

My husband and I enjoyed this for lunch today.  It was very good and I didn't even have the crab meat. I forgot to put the milk in it too! Thanks for the recipe.  :) This one goes in my cookbook!

I love this recipe. The only adjustment I made was I used old bay instead of salt and pepper
