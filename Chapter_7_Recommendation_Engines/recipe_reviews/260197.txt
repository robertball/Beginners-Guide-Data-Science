I was surprised at how good this rice pudding turned out with almond milk. Also, this Instant Pot method is easier than standing over the stove or baking. This recipe isn't very sweet, which is great as I like to eat rice pudding for breakfast. I'm not sure that I like the orange flavor in rice pudding; I liked it better chilled. But, I would prefer just using all almond milk and maybe coconut extract next time. I screwed up and, without thinking, cracked the egg in with the rice and milk. I cooked it anyway. It looked very eggy when I opened the lid, but I kept stirring and was surprised at how well it all blended smoothly together. I'll be sure to follow the instructions next time! *I just wanted to make an update that I added some dried cranberries to the leftovers, and I liked the orange-cranberry combo.

I enjoyed this more than expected as I am not normally a rice pudding fan.

I was happy that it didn't stick/burn to my pan and the consistency was perfect for me at the 2 minute mark of stirring during the final saute step. I also liked the texture of the rice.

I liked the level of sweetness and taste although I made it without orange zest or orange extract as I didn't have these. I will make this again.
