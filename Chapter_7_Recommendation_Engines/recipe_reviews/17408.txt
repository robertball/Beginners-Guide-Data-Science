These are so easy and very tasty.  The rice crispies become spongy though, next time I make them I will use more peanuts and less rice crispies to make them a little more crunchy.  I highly recommend using salted roasted peanuts, the salty sweet combo is fantastic.

Wonderful! Easy! Yummy! I often add 2/3 cup of rasins as well and it tastes similar to a Chunky or a Fruit & Nut Bar.  Many Thanks!

I am not usually much of a peanut cluster fan, but my hubby requested them, so I tried this recipe. I have been using this recipe now for 2-3 years and it is YUMMY! And soooo easy! I whipped out a double batch this morning in less than 30min! I definitely recommend adding these to your must-have recipe box!

Really good Basic recipe to start with. I did make a few mods to my taste. I added a 1 TBS of vanilla. Then instead of semi sweet I used milk cholate chips the whole bag and a whole bag of peanut butter chips. 3 cups of rice cereal and 2 cups of nuts ! My Kids and neighbors went nuts for these so I must of did a good job !

I stumbled across this recipe when looking for a way to use up a 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk.  The flavor is great, but the consistency is different.  The rice krispies dissolve almost, you can't tell they are there.  The consistency is almost marshmallow-like.  Not sure if I would make them for a treat tray, but tasty for at home eating.

This was fun to make!  I used Oats and Almond cereal because that was what I had on hand.  It worked out very well.  This is a fun snack to have on hand!  Next time I'd like to try it with white chocolate.  Good recipe to make for the holidays.
