This is a very good dessert.  I did as most others and made 1.5 times the dough and used 3- 4 very large apples.  I baked it in an 8x8 disposable pan for 50 minutes. I actually made 3 of these to give away, but couldn't get enough matzah cake meal, so ended up grinding matzah meal in the blender until it was very fine.  The cakes came out absolutely beautiful and tasted great.

This cake was very good. It actually may have been too gooey from the apples inside which is why next time I make this cake, I will definitely use 2-3 apples and 1.5 times the batter. I didn't want to stick such big chunks of apples in the middle of my cake, so I sliced them about 1/4 inch thick. Instead of sprinkling all of the cinn. sugar on top of them I laid down a layer and then sprinkled some and then laid down another layer of apples and then more cinn. sugar on top of that (dividing the 1/2 cup of the mixture btwn the 2 layers). I will also use less than what remained of the mixture on top of my cake as I felt it was too much and didn't brown but rather came out of the oven as a pile of dry sand on top of my cake (although you can easily wipe some off). I also made this the day before my sedar and I cut it into squares while warm as directed, but very much regret doing so. It looks crumbly and not nice and I would rather have re-warmed it right before serving and put it on the table as whole cake, for presentation purposes (and then cut it into squares). Since I did already cut it into squares, I will put the pieces in pretty cupcake holders and serve them on a tray to make them look nicer. All in all, great flavor, but I recommend less apples, more batter, and thinner sliced apples layered with the cinn. sugar mixture...This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I made 1.5 times the batter and added 1 tsp. vanilla to it.  For the apples, I cut them in smaller pieces.  I also did not use 3/4 cup of sugar on them, just about a tablespoon.  Finally, I sprinkled extra cinnamon in between layers and on top.

This recipe is incredible. I've made it for 3 seders already and it is even rabbi-approved. :) I used 3 apples and 3/4 of the egg white mixture, otherwise it gets too fluffy.  I also sliced the apples much thinner.
