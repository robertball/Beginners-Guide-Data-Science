I think this recipe has a lot of potential.  Two things I loved was A) SO EASY and B)how the marinade stuck to the chicken and turned it a deep colour.  The drumsticks were really lovely to look at once they were cooked (I made them in the oven... didn't broil, but did baste once or twice).  I found the molasses taste a bit overpowering.  I think next time I will cut that measurement down a bit so the apple and ginger can have a bit more of the stage.  This marinade can stretch further then the recipe gives it credit for.  I did 5 drumsticks and could have done a couple more.  I will make again.

Super easy to make and SUPER delicious! My sister cans applebutter and always sends me a bunch, so I used some for this recipe. It turned out fantastic! My 2 and 4 year olds gobbled it up and asked for more. It's my new "go-to" recipe

Noticed that this marinade recipe doesn't have an acid, so I added apple cider vinegar.

This was very good and different, but 20 min. did not cook my chicken. I cooked mine at least an hour I had 6 drumsticks instead of 4 and the sauce was more than enough. I will make again.
