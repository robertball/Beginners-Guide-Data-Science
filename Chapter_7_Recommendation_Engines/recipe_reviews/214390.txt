This was an easy and absolutely delicious dish!  Very bold flavors!  The only deviation I made from the recipe was to bake the salmon and some of the marinade (350F for 13 minutes) in aluminum foil rather than grill it.  I will add all of the marinade for the salmon to bake in the next time.  My daughter thought the sauce had a great kick and wanted more.

This recipe was great! I cut back a little on all of the spicy ingredients since I do not usually enjoy spicy food; however, I will definitely add the full amount next time. This recipe is full of flavor and was a hit with my boyfriend who isn't a fish lover. We sealed the salmon in non-stick tin foil and grilled it with some of the marinade inside.

This is a pretty good marinade. I'm not giving it a full 5 stars because I thought it could be thicker to create a nicer glaze on the salmon. Next time I'll add more honey to achieve that. I only marinated my salmon for 30 minutes and it came out pretty flavorful. Before putting the salmon in the marinade I reserved some for glazing while I grilled the salmon. I grilled it over medium heat without turning it, skin side down. It turned out really great. A keeper for sure! My husband said a couple of times that this was the best salmon I've made, and I have tried quite a few recipes over the years.

This was a big hit with my husband and older kids. I served it with Black Bean and Rice Salad. I made a few modifications: I used 1/4 c. cider vinegar, no sugar and 1/4 t. salt. It reminded me of the island food we've had in the Caribbean--very fresh-flavored and light. My friend is having a bumper crop of apricots, so we had a few of those on the side. DELICIOUS!

I made a few adjustments to this but the family loved it.  I substituted balsamic vinegar for the apple cider & used agave nectar to replace the honey.  Also after I cooked the fish I reduced the remaining marinade on the stove top for about 15 minutes & it made a great glaze to add with the ginger & spice flavors becoming much more pronounced.

I only used half a cup of the vinegar, even that was a little much. next time I think i'll only use  1/4 cup. I didn't have orange zest so I used a tbs. of orange juice instead. good but not great.

Loved, loved, loved it!  Did not necessarily find it spicy, but loved how the marinade glazed on the salmon.   I subbed balsamic vinegar into the recipe as I didn't have any cider vinegar. I did marinate for 3 hrs. Will definitely make it again!

This was so yummy! It looked to be a lot of marinade so I just scaled down the amount of ingredients. I also felt that much sugar was unnecessary after the honey so I just sprinkled a little on. Roasted at 400 in the oven, boiled the marinade and used as a sauce. Next time I might try baking it in the marinade. Sprinkled fresh cilantro on at the end. Delicious!

FABULOUS recipe!  My husband and I LOVE flavor ... the more the better.  This marinade had tonnes of flavor.  Our family loved it.  Our BBQ wasn't working so I actually baked it in the oven and it turned out great.  It will definitely make our family recipe book!

I thought this was a fabulous marinade - I also baked it rather than grilling, but followed everything exactly.  I made a sauce out of some of the marinade to top the fish and we loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  The only thing I would do differently would be to marinate the salmon longer.  It was excellent!

The marinade was perfect.  It still allowed the flavor of the salmon to shine, yet added just a touch of heat and surprise.  Yummy!

this was very flavorful!  I marinated the salmon for 2 and a half hours.  Then i baked the salmon in the oven (at 350 degrees) with all the marinade in a baking dish because other reviewers said they wished they had used all the marinade.  This is the first time i've ever cooked salmon and it was a great hit with the boyfriend as well!  I served the salmon with a side of asian stir fry.

Really yummy and has a nice Kick to it! I could only marinate it for about 1/2 hour and it still came out well.  I can only imagine how great it would taste if I marinated it for a couple of hours!

This was okay, but I don't think I will be making it again.  The vinegar taste was pretty strong to me, if I were to make a change I would reduce the amount of vinegar used.

Oh my gosh you have to try this! I used on white fish instead of salmon. And didn't use any sugar since the honey was sweetener enough. The flavors are out-freakin-standing! Will definitely be making this again and again. Probably one of the best ways to make fish.

Kept some of the marinade separate and thickened it to make a sauce. The salmon turned out good, but I think I'd use more ginger next time.

I like spicy food and this salmon is spicy.  I used sun dried tomatoes and omitted salt. In the oven at 350 takes longer than grilling but it was still great!  Per suggestions, I reserved some of the marinade, heated it and drizzled on top before serving.

This is so easy to make. Plus it's a great way to flavor up salmon.  My  two young children love it also. Not to hot and not to sweet it's just right. I have done this both on the grill by wrapping each piece in non-stick foil and also baking it and I normally only let it marinate for a hour and a half.

Used agave instead of honey and omitted the sugar as suggested by another reviewer.  I reduced the marinate while the salmon was cooking. I was rather alarmed by the vinegary smell of the marinade, so added about 1/4 cup orange juice to the reduction.  It still smelled rather vinegary, but I need not have worried. This was by far the most flavorful grilled salmon we have ever had!  Just the right amount of heat from the red pepper flakes. I think that if the salmon had been the least bit fishy beforehand, this would have taken care of the problem. This will be our new favorite grilled salmon recipe! Thanks!

Salmon has a very citrus flavor, but good overall.  Tried baking the salmon in some of the marinade and would try baking without the marinade in the future. Also maybe cut back on the sugar and up the red pepper to make more spicy than sweet.
