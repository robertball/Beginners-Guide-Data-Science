This was pretty good after I made some changes. I cooked the chicken 20 minutes which was way too much. It was very dry. If I make it again I'll only cook it 10-12 minutes. I substituted minced green olives for capers, because I had no capers. I used three chopped tomatoes plus a can of diced tomatoes with juice. It covered the dryness of the chicken enough that it made very good soft tacos with taco sauce and sour cream. I may make it again but with the changes to make it moist.

It is a colorful dish that was pretty tasty. I had to add more tomato because it was quite dry without it. Creation was easy.
I had to cut the recipe down to two servings and even that made plenty. I froze one portion.
Because of diet constraints I didn't add any salt, hoping the capers would do the trick. I ended up adding some lime juice which added the salt flavor and another layer of flavor. It was quite good. Served it in a pita pocket.

This was great.  I used can chicken and added cumin and put them on arepas.  The sherry really gives it an awesome flavor.

I made this recipe as directed less the cilantro (not a fan), it was easy and tasty!  We used the shredded chicken in quesadillas adding some cheddar and frank's hot sauce, yum. Next time I will add a pinch of red pepper prior to adding the chicken to give it a little more kick.  This recipe will be a staple for all things Mexican food. thank you for sharing!

Delicious, I used can chicken, substituted some relish for the capers since i didn't have any and chopped the ingredients on the smaller side. The texture/mixture and taste was great and a really easy recipe. I just wish i knew what the white sauce in the picture is.. looks good.

Nice and easy recipe! I didn't have any cooking sherry so I added some tomato sauce instead. I served it in a bread roll with avocado, lettuce, tomato & chipotle creama. Yum!
