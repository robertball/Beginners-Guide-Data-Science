A wonderful receipe! i made a few changes based on my comfort food likings,
instead of light cream, I used a cup of pet milk,(gives an amazing tang and much more depth to the cheese) also used gruyere rather than swiss. the results were perfect. i could have easily finished the entire batch myself! everyone LOVED IT!

Delicious! I cooked a bit of garlic in with the butter then added a splash of white wine. I recommend using at least half Evaporated Milk in place of the milk (ie half evap and half milk) it heps to prevent curdling. I also used dijon rather than dry mustard.  So good with shrimp or white fish in place of lobster too!

Lobster is so darned expensive here in southern Ontario I couldn't bring myself to use it in a casserole.  Instead I substituted with only slightly less expensive crab.  Here's a hint: stay away from Philipps brand crab meat (product of Indonesia) - unless you like tiny pieces of shell in every bite.  Other than that this is a great seafood casserole.  Might try it using mixed seafoods (scallops, calamari, etc.).

The entire family loved this dish.  Lobster is hard to find here so I used 5 frozen lobster tails, cooked (yielded about 3 1/2 cups meat).  Expensive but it was a special event and worth the costs.

Delicious.  I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner today.  Rave reviews.  Next time I might add garlic though.

Followed the recipe - it was very dry and bland.  Something was missing, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  It definitely needs more sauce and should be served over rice or pasta.  Too bland for my taste.

My husband and I loved this and one of our picky 5 year old twins didn't think it was half bad either! My husband liked it so much that I was going to make a dip with the rest of the lobster we had but he has decided he wants more of this! Here is what I did differently: I used heavy cream (but only because they had no light cream at the store we went to) - I would use light the next time just because of the dense factor! We did not add mushrooms because of the kids and did not use bread cubes because I just thought it was too much! I think I was right because it turned out to be awesome without it! I used a four blend cheese in the saucepan and then actually laid slices of swiss over the casserole before the bread crumbs! I also added some Old Bay and will add more next time! A great recipe - it's printed and in my recipe book!!! Loved it!

This was very good!  I added some finely chopped onion and garlic to the cream mixture along with some Old Bay seasoning.  I also substituted evaporated milk for the cream (which I didn't have) and it worked out fine.  I think you could make this with any type of seafood and it would be delicious.

I would rate this recipe 10 stars if I could!  What a wonderful dish.  Next time, I am going to use a mixture of seafood because the lobster is just too pricey.

Just put down my plate to quickly write a review - this is unbelievable!!!  We had extra lobster meat & my husband was leary I was putting it into a casserole but he is already on his third serving - thank you!!  The mushrooms I had were a little close to their end so I sauteed them in butter/garlic & a splash of red wine before adding to the mix.  Great recipe - will add this to my go-to section :)

We learn from our mistakes.  After following the recipe, I decided that Lobster is never left over. It should never be drowned in a mushroom sauce, after purchasing it at $$ per pound.  I prefer food simply cooked.   Next time I'll buy lobster and steam it. This wasn't right for me

This I made with fresh Atlantic lobster I brought back from New Brunswick.  The neighbours we fed had never eaten lobster before and they absolutely loved it. Excellent recipe!

This was REALLY GOOD!  I had 2 cooked lobster tails, so I halved the recipe.  The only changes I made were to saute the mushrooms with some garlic before adding to the casserole and using 1% milk plus heavy cream (what I had on hand).  I put in a splash of chardonnay too and  baked it in my convection oven for half the time called for since the volume was so low.  If I had air conditioning or it had been cooler I would have popped it under the broiler to brown the top, but the flavor was awesome.  It's such a rich dish, it was perfect for hubby & me.  We occasionally have left over cooked lobster from clam bakes, so I'm thrilled to find a recipe to utilize the left overs!

Love the basics this recipe. I use imitation Crab meat instead of lobster, use the whole can of Evaporated milk instead of Light Cream, Regular mustard instead of Powdered, and I add minced garlic.

Family and relatives love it.

My moms favorite seafood is Lobster so as a surprise I made her this casserole for Christmas Dinner and she loved it.  Its absolutely amazing.  I left out the mushrooms (she isn't fond of them) and it was still a wonderful tasting dish.

Adapted this recipe to use meat from lobsters tails and it worked just fine. Must be nice to live in a place where you can get 10 - 20lbs of lobster at a time.- Barbara
