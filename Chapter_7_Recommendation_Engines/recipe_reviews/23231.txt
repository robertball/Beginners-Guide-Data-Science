I have made this wonderful appetizer 3 times now.  It is VERY easy to make, it looks beautiful and tastes WONDERFUL..... I have a friend who cannot eat nuts, so twice I have left them out and it still tastes fantastic.

The pastry for this recipe was remarkably easy, and the combination of the chunky cranberry sauce with the brie on a buttery cracker was delicious!

I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner since I was to bring an appetizer.  I really looked forward to it!  I took time to decorate the crust. It looked great.  My only mistake was that when I arrived I told someone to put it in the microwave for 2 minutes. It was still warm since I had made it before we left but I wanted it to tasted like "right out of the oven". Big mistake! 
It almost exploded and the cheese was melting out all over the place.  But wonder of wonders, it still tasted great and was a hit!! Highly recommend.

Sorry, we didn't like this at all.  The dough was easy to make, but it tasted raw and I let it get golden brown.  The Brie was good, but you can't really mess that up.  The cranberry and almond didn't really add that much to it.

I thought this was awesome with alterations. I doubled the recipe and used a 13oz wheel of brie. Instead of the cranberry almond mixture, I used a cranberry chutney with pecans, pears, apples, orange and dried fruit. I baked it for 25 minutes and it still was not long enough. Also, next time I will grease the baking sheet because mine stuck to the pan. I have already recommended this recipe to friends! This'll be a new Thanksgiving tradition.

This was very good.  The dough had great flavor.  I omitted the nuts and still was great.

This recipe sounds great but they did not put the flour amount in the pastry.  I would love to make this if I had the complete recipe.

I love this recipe.  I usually don't remember to get cranberry sauce, so I use raspberry jelly instead and sometimes leave out the nuts.  It is always a hit at my holiday functions and so easy even though it looks so fancy.

I love the concept but directions were too confusing and I didn't like the brie. Will try other cheese ingredient if I choose to try this again.
