Nothing signals the start of summer like grilled corn on the cob at a BBQ! I soaked my corn first in cold water with a bit of sugar and salt for about an hour inside the husks (peeling back the husk a bit and removing a bit of the silk then putting the husk back). I put the corn in husks on the grill for 30 minutes rotating it around the coals. The corn cooks by steaming inside the husks. I softened the butter and added the rest of the ingredients. I cut the amount of pepper in half and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper vs. adding the hot pepper sauce as I thought it might be a little too hot for us. All that was left to do was break out the napkins and eat. These definitely are a garlic lover's dream - sweet, spicy and delicious!

I made this tonight and it was PERFECT! It is tender, smokey, sweet and spicy...very much a Tex Mex flavor, which I love! I tweaked it similar to what Jill did by soaking the corn and grilling it with the husks! Instead of using the seasoned butter on the corn AFTER it was cooked, I peeled back the husks and brushed it on and then I relpaced the husks and grilled on low flame for 30 minutes...turning constantly! The husks will flame up while grilling, but thats what gives the corn that great smokey flavor! I didn't use the lime juice because I didn't have any. I will use this recipe for grilled corn from now on!

So very good! I soaked the corn first without the silk for an hour. I'm not a huge fan of cumin so I replaced with chili powder and used Franks Hot Sauce. Wowza! The butter combination was outstanding. I didn't even have the lime. Cooked on the grill then brushed with the rest of the butter.  Great recipe!

Don't think I could ever eat grilled corn any other way again...This was awesome!  I too brushed the butter concoction on the corn & kept the husks on while grilling.  Wonderful smokey flavor!  The black kernels aren't burnt...they're delish!!  You won't be sorry!

I creamed the ingrediants, omitting the garlic since we don't care for it.  I didn't grill the corn, just cooked on the stove and used the creamed butter at the table.  It was great!  I also used the butter the next day on some warm tortillas.

This is the best corn recipe I've ever tried.  The portions are perfect.  Even though I'm not the best cook, it comes out great every time I grill it.  This corn flies off the table at potlucks.

This was amazing! I removed the silk and soaked the corn before putting it on the fire. I grilled the corn and then put the butter mixture on after the corn was cooked as I was cooking on an open camping fire and didnt want any errors. This was so tasty that we ate all the corn and then put the remaining butter on some potatoes we also had - I will 100% keep making this recipe!

Amazing Flavor! I followed the recipe exactly except I used Sriracha chili sauce in place of Tapatio. This makes a great dipping sauce for grilled chicken too!

This was delicious! My husband only wanted to try it on 3 ears of corn so I put the remainder on a potato that I sliced and wrapped in foil...this was fingerlicking good.  The only change I made was I halved the cumin and added 1/2a teaspoon of chili powder based on others suggestions. We are hooked!!!

I love this recipe! It goes over very well with our family and friends alike! I use it without cumin and it doesn't make a difference. Also, I use Hot peppers in vinegar sauce as the hot sauce. The corn is juicy and sweet! First rate!!

Our first attempt at bbq corn.  Could not ask for a better flavour.   For hot sauce, we used tabasco.  A little heat, garlic, lots of butter left this corn juicy and very tasty

My family loved this corn. I followed the recipe exactly, and all it needed at serving was a sprinkle of salt. It's a great way to get some variety when eating corn on the cob.

I also removed the silk and then soaked the corn in husks in water for one hour.  It turned out great and I am making this for the second time this week!

I shucked the corn, brushed on the butter mixture and cooked it directly on the grill basting occasionally.  I did make one change - I too used chili powder rather than the cumin, only because I'm not a big cumin fan.  So simple, but this was very good!

This was absolutely amazing, prepared exactly like the recipe.  My wife and I eat a lot of corn, and we don't think we will ever have plain boiled corn again.  As I was preparing the marinade my wife was not sure she would like it.  After she took her first bite, she wished there were 4 more ears, just for her.  The marinade is also amazing on zucchini.

We grilled the corn last night in the husk after soaking them and it was fabulous.  Didn't have the lime but did everything else the same.  My 88 yr old mother who has dementia couldn't stop talking about how good it was and she never comments on food.  Great recipe will definitely do it again and again.

I haven't had corn since I had braces when I was 14.  I'm 30 now and don't eat corn anymore, but made this recipe for my wife.  Smelled so good I had to try it and my wife and I ate all four ears and didn't even share them with the kids. I feel bad but it's soo good.  If you haven't tried this recipe you definitely need to try it. It's sweet and juicy with just the right amount of sweet heat!!!

Soaked the corn in its husk for an hour, basted the corn with the butter mixture, then grilled it on medium for 15-20 minutes. Husks started to catch on fire halfway through the grilling process, so I removed them from the husks. Naked corn seemed to grill better, was also much easier to baste with the butter mixture as they finished cooking. Excellent taste!

By far, the best corn recipe ever! We made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. We soaked the corn in a pot with 1/2 cup sugar for 45 minutes before grilling, used smoked paprika instead of cumin, and half of the hot sauce. This is going to become a new staple for years to come.

This is awesome!! I use Texas Pete as my hot sauce because I am a wimp. I also use this over oven roasted frozen corn kernels that I bake at 450 for 10 minutes. I use 1 lb of frozen corn, partially thawed, then just pour on the sauce and turn it on broil for 1-2 minutes. Thanks!!!

FINGER LICK'N GREAT recipe AS IS!! The blend of spices and heat from the hot sauce is out of this world, delicious! Our family loved them!You can adjust the "heat" to your families liking by decreasing the hot pepper sauce. I used this recipe as stated, but rather grilled them with husks on as it adds another hint of scrumptious flavor that our family loves. I snipped off the silk ends of the corn and soaked them (in husk!) in cold water for an hour. I put ALL of the sauce inside all of the ears of corn with husks on. You may wrap them in tin foil if the husks are not holding to the cob well enough. Once you have tried this version of "corn on the cob" you MAY not ever want it any other way! Thanks for sharing Chef Howe, GREAT recipe!!

This was pretty good, except we felt the cumin overpowered the flavor of the other ingredients.  Next time I'm going to try cutting the cumin in half.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Chef Howe!

Really good corn even with my mistakes!!! Didn't have lime juice, thought I did. Didn't have enough hot sauce (not sure how that happened since we ALWAYS have hot sauce) so I added a little cayane pepper, and the grill ran out of propane so I tossed them under the broiler to cook. Since I couldn't brush them while cookig I tossed the butter mixture in the fridge and put more on the cooked corn after it came out of the oven.

soaked the corn for about 15 minutes in water to make sure they were nice and moist. then peeled off extra husks so there was just enough to cover the corn. Removed all the silk and brushed with seasonings, re-wrapped with husks and grilled. Very juicy and tasty. We added parmesan and tapatio hot sauce after cooking. This is the way I like my corn, my hubby still preferred traditional corn on the cobb without all the seasoning.

The corn is delicious. The only problem I had was when I put it on the grill it immediately started flaring up. I ended up moving it to the small upper rack in my grill. It finished there and was perfect.

Our entire family loved this.  We skipped the hot sauce and substituted olive oil for butter.  It was a major hit!  

We cooked the husked corn on non-stick foil (poke holes in the foil) for 10 minutes on the bottom rack and 10 minutes on the top rack using medium heat and keeping the grill lid open.  The corn came out perfect.  No pre-soaking required.

This corn was amazing!!  We loved the butter sauce so much that we wiped the pot clean with a crusty bread about an hour after it was made.  The lime taste came out and was so amazing.  This is definatly a keeper!!!

Love this recipe. I now always put cumin on my corn. I do not use the hot pepper sauce though; too spicy for my family. I use this recipes all the time for BBQ's in the summer. Love it.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't baste the corn with it before grilling though.  I mixed it up and put it on the corn before serving. My husband thought it was too much garlic but was just perfect for me!  Yummy!!!

We grill this corn all the time.  Is is always a winner.  I don't use all the garlic called for, just a clove or two.  Otherwise I use the recipe as written.

First off, I didn't grill my corn but rather cooked it in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit wrapped in tinfoil. I cooked for about 20 minutes and cut the recipe into 1/3 since I was only cooking 2 ears of corn. I used lemon juice instead of lime since we didn't have lime, but did have a lemon. I thought it was fantastic, but I think next time I will omit the sugar. I thought the sugar took too much away from the cumin, citrus, and buttery hot sauce flavor.

Also, I almost never eat my corn off the cob because it just gets stuck in my teeth. I saved some of the butter mixture and after cutting off corn kernels from top to bottom with a knife, I mixed the remaining hot buttery spread into the corn kernels. It's not quite the same as grilled corn, but the flavor is wonderful nonetheless!

It was awesome! I really liked my corn with this seasoning. I recommen though to brush the sauce on the corn, I kept pouring it and it almost tasted too salty. I bet if I had been brushing it the way the recipe says, it would have kept the corn juicy and with just the right amount of flavor, especially because on my grill it took longer to cook.

As other posters suggested, I soaked my corn then grilled and used the butter mixture after it was done.  I wouldn't use it everytime, but I really liked it.  I used Tabasco and that was no joke,  it definitely added heat.  I would definitely make again.

THIS is the only recipe I'll ever use for grilled corn. It's so good, the corn steals the show at every cookout. Toasting the cumin makes a big difference, too. (Toast whole cumin in a dry skillet over med. heat, stirring constantly- only takes a few minutes. Grind in coffee grinder.) Amazing! Thank you, Chef Howe!

This was great flavored corn in the cob. Best flavor I’ve ever had. Used the butter mixture to put on hamburger buns before I grilled them. Really added great flavor.

It was excellent.  Made no modifications to the recipe and cooked on the grill at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, rotating and basting the corn every 5 minutes.  I have made 5 times this summer and everyone has raved about the corn

WOW! I cut the recipe in half, followed the recipe but just eyeballed the ingredients. I shucked the corn and wrapped them in foil and threw them on the grill, turning occasionally. Poured the butter mixture over the cooked corn before serving and then men were elated! Will have to do again!

Omigosh! So easy and delicious! I didn’t have any lime, but it turned out fine without. Used a little extra garlic and my hot sauce of choice was Sriracha. (A personal favorite!) Sweet, spicy and yummy! I may give the soaking that others here have suggested a try next time, as I needed up having to cook them for way longer than suggested, but they were perfect otherwise!

Great! I don’t prepare grilled corn often but I thought I would give this a try. The flavor was awesome. The butter sauce really made this an excellent fresh side. My wife and I loved it and plan to add it many more times this Summer. Thanks for recipe!

Over and over my mom and fiancé said "best corn ever" , like they couldn't believe how good it was! I followed the recipe and added the review that suggested to remove silk, and soak for 1hr with husk and after brushing sauce on corn and covering back with husk, wrapped in aluminum foil to grill. Salty but that made it good.

This really takes corn to the next level! I do a lot of potlucks and this has been the most requested item. i have a few friends that use it like a salsa and put it on their stake and fish. I don't change a thing. Franks is my favorite hot sauce because I like a vinegar taste. I like to chill and whip with a spoon before serving because when hot the butter and spices separate.

Fabulous!  I made it exactly as written.  Used Sriracha for hot sauce.  Shucked it and grilled it slathered in the butter.
UNBELIEVABLE!  I think the sauce might be great on a steak, too.  Can't wait to try it.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I cheated. I didn't use corn on the cob but instead canned niblet corn and did it on the stovetop in a skillet.

I followed the ingredients and sauteed until the corn started to brown. I added a dash of liquid smoke to give it that BBQ over the coals taste. 

Not 100% same as on the grill, but a darn good second place.

I don't usually post on here but........ wow!! 
Not a big corn eater. But this was the best corn I've ever had. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Only changed 2 things. One I didn't use hot sauce. And 2 I shucked the corn and wrapped it in foil. Was very delicious!! I will definitely be cooking this again.

I soaked my corn in sugar water before grilling.  To baste I pulled back the husk, basted, then replaced the husk, I did it about 4 time during grilling.  I thought this was good, but not as much flavor as I'd hoped came through into the corn.  A neat new way to have corn, considering we usually just throw it into a pot of boiling water.  Thanks!

Soaked the corn in sugar water for an hour. Substituted chili powder for the cumin. Used the husks (de-silked) but next time I'm going to remove the husk altogether and grill and baste till it gets the right color and then wrap in foil. It keeps the husk fire from happening, lol. But it was freaking awesome.

Loved the taste, and easy. We soaked the cobs in water for a good 2 hours before we placed them on the grill, no tinfoil necessary. Turned every 5 min or so. A bit different taste than normal boiled corn. A summer must

These were delicious!  Made them exactly per the recipe. I was worried they might be too spicy, but they're perfect and a great side dish with our tacos al pastor that we were grilling as well. Very flavorful and not too spicy at all.

Very good, even though I didn't have any limes.  The hardest part was removing the silk and replacing the husk - I ended up having to wrap the ears and what husks I could in foil for the grilling. It was definitely worth the work.

Very tasty, new way to experience grilled corn. We all loved the grilled corn, but especially the butter mixture; very flavourful and paired so well with the grilled flavour from the BBQ.  As some reviewers commented, we chose to remove the silk, soaked the husks with corn in water, and then grill. That was a lot of work, next time, we will grill straight on the the grill.

I cooked part with husks and part without.  Took the rest of the husks off half way through.  I didn't add hot sauce, my wife doesn't like it sometimes!  This turned our excellent.   My wife can't wait till we make it again....me too!  :-)

Thanks Chef Howe for this recipe. I've used it multiple times for my grilled corn and my family LOVES it! The only thing I did different is I removed the husks and the silk and wrapped the corn in foil, grilled it for about fifteen minutes, removed the foil and placed back on the grill for another 10 minutes just to get the grill marks. I did not change the recipe and used it as is. This will always be my go to butter for my grilled corn.

FABULOUS! The teens and tweens were hesitant to eat corn that was presented the way it was : husks, charred spots, etc. but they were so hungry they tried it. They ate it and liked it! Soaked the husks minus silk for about an hour until I was ready to go. Brushed a bit of the butter on kernels b4 it hit the grill. Turned and rotated every few minutes. Forgot the lime - delish even so. Used only one tbsp of Tapatio and it was perfecto for our palates. Wish I took a pic cuz I pulled back the husks and brushed more of the butter heaven while they were still hot. Served with the husks pulled back and it was striking! Thanks for the diversion of my usual boiled corn on the cob! :)

This is an amazing recipe, thank you! Instead of the hot sauce I use hot chili flakes (we add about 4 Tbsp for real spicy). To speed up cook time, I remove the husks and boil the corn in water for about 30 minutes. Then I put on the grill and brush the sauce on. You still get the BBQ flavour and grill marks as well as all the flavour from all that sauce. This is part of our regular rotation of things to make and everyone that has tried has said that they have loved it!

Have made this alot. It is amazing. I found I preferred to wrap them in foil otherwise the butter just drips off onto the grill, causing flame to shoot up. I did not brush while the corn was cooking because 1. I covered them in foil and 2. brushing them with more butter causes more of the flame to shoot upand it just drips right off. After they cooked I remove foil and place in dish with remaining butter mixture. Spin them around to coat with more butter mixture and serve. Works beter if you squeeze a little fresh lime juice after they are cooked in my opinion.

I really did love it. Yum.  I whipped up the ingredients minus the hot sauce and poured it on the 2 ears I had marked for my kids, then I added 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne and about 5 shakes of Tabasco.  I did not use any cumin.  I do not like that flavor on anything.  I soaked my corn shucked and cleaned in cold water for 1 hour with 1/2 c sugar and 1T salt.  Patted dry and placed one ear on an 8" piece of aluminum foil.  I poured about 1 T of the butter mixture on each ear and rotated it to coat it. I closed the foil and then I grilled for 15 min turning every 3 minutes.  They were perfectly done.  The ears with the hot mixture really were not hot.  I'll definitely add more spice the next time.  The flavor is great.  My husband thought it was too "limey" tasting but he ate 2 ears. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I saved the leftover mixture and put it on baked chiken.

Absolutely delicious! We followed the recipe except we did not add the sugar, and it turned out perfectly. We grilled on a medium-hot gas grill. Delicious flavor, just barely browned and roasted. We'll used this recipe regularly.

This was fantastic! I've never grilled corn before (i know..start the shaming lol) but I saw this recipe and just had to try it.  I followed almost to the "t"  but didnt have any cumin, so substituted double chili powder and put it on the grill.  Now I'm not sure if the recipe used gas or charcoal, but i have gas, set it at a comfy 400 and kept the lid closed during cooking, rotating as needed.  Everyone in the house loved it and even went back for the 2 extra ears.  Will absolutely make this again!

I despise corn, whether it's on the cob or off, except when it's made like this. I love it, my 5 and 7 year old daughters love it - everyone loves it. My husband makes it frequently during the summer and our guests always ask for the recipe before they leave. There is no need to change one thing about this recipe; it's perfect as is!

Our new favorite way to eat corn on the cob! Have made this twice now. The first time I made it just as written, using fresh corn. The second time I did not have fresh corn so I parboiled some frozen ears and then grilled them as written. Both were fantastic. The sauce is the true star of this recipe! I even brushed some of the remaining sauce on some chicken pieces that were grilling beside the corn. It too was delicious. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

I halved the pepper and didn't add hot sauce and this was AMAZING!! I shucked the corn, then put it on aluminum foil. Brushed the butter/garlic/spice mix over the top, drizzled a little more on and folded the aluminum foil to make a packet. Put it on the grill and it was super tasty. I wasn't sure about the sugar, I'll admit, but this was the best grilled corn I've ever had! I don't think I'll be able to go back...this has ruined me for plain corn! Even my picky-eater husband loved this!

This corn is incredibly good. I was worried about the spiciness of it but, while it does have a little bite, it was really good!

This was really good! I made it exactly as written and the only thing I would change is to halve the cumin next time; I thought the cumin taste overwhelmed the other flavors a bit.  Otherwise, delicious!

Excellent! We subbed out cumin for chili powder, and we LOVED them. Thanks for the super flavorful concoction!

Super yummy recipe.  I will probably make again, but not often, just because of the high calories in it!

This was amazing.  My husband, who does not care for corn on the cob, couldn't stop talking about how great it was.  We will be making this often!

If you're looking for something different to do with your grilled corn, this is your recipe. Easy and tasted great. Even my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it. Will definitely have it again!

We really enjoyed this.  I thought the garlic might be too strong, but it wasn't at all.  Super easy too!

This recipe is Good! Make it every time I need something to impress while grilling. I keep the husk on, only pulling back enough to put the butter on.
