Sounds delicious. Where do I get a recipe for the salad dressing, or what brand do you use? I have never seen this. Thanks!

Thought I should post a review, since I've made this so many times - well, my version anyway. I've never seen sun-dried tomato and oregano salad dressing in the markets where I shop, so I took a guess at some ingredients. For the marinade and dressing I blend 2 Tbsp. chopped sun dried tomatoes (from a jar), 3 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar, 1 tsp. Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and few shakes each of salt, pepper, and white sugar in my small food processor. Wow-incredibly yummy!! I have no idea if this ended up anything like the intended dressing, but it was the best dressing I've ever made from scratch. I make this salad at least every couple of weeks.

This is an incredibly tasty meal!  My Greek-Bahamian husband requests it often, it is easy healthy and a great light dinner or hearty lunch.  I use the Marzetti Sun Dried Tomato Dressing and add oregano to it.

this is a very nice summer's eve salad. like other reviewers, i was unable to find sundried tomato & oregano dressing so i added a teaspoon of dried oregano to each of two 8 oz. bottles of ken's sundried tomato vinaigrette (next time i'll make them rounded teaspoons). i also used one red & one yellow bell pepper. my boyfriend did the grilling end & was amazed by how beautiful this salad looked on our plates. thank you for the great recipe marjory!

This was super!  I left the olives out, and don't feel like we missed anything.  We used the Kraft Sun Dried Tomato dressing, and a lot less than the recipe called for, which makes it much healther than the nutrition info here suggests.

Used previous suggestion of Ken's Lite Sundried Tomato dressing with one rounded  TSP oregano added.  It's 90 degreeswith 100%  humidity and a perfect dinner.  Thank you

We liked this.  I've used sundried tomato dressing on chicken before and it always turns out incredibly moist.  I skipped the feta and opted for other cheese - I'm not a fan, though I know it is more mediterranean.  Also, at the end, I ended using a creamy dressing for the salad.  Having more sun-dried tomato was too much for me.  It was good though!

4 minus - great flavours, especially when sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and balsamic vinegar are used in a self concocted recipe for the salad dressing. Not bad for a first run through, though we expect to make some improvements...might work well with calamari, stronger feta flavour.

Excellent main dish salad.   The only change I made was that I made my own salad dressing.   I recommend this highly.

This is definitely a keeper.   Absolutely delicious and pretty easy to make.   I, too, was not able to find "sun-dried tomato and oregano dressing" in the stores, but bought some Kraft Sun-dried Tomato dressing and just added some dried oregano leaves (fresh probably would have been better).   Also substituted Kalamata olives for a little more Mediterranean spice.  A couple of croissants on the side (toasted on the Grill for a minute, a nice Chardonnay and you've got a wonderful meal!

instead of bottled dressing I made my own. I buy sundried toms packed in oil and save the oil in the fridge. Just make a basic dressing using the oil with some nice vinegar and lots of oregano. It's great on this and many other salads
