I didn't stuff the shells just threw everything together and into the oven for almost an hour. Added shredded cheese on top to give that melted cheese flavor.. came out great

On my second attempt I made it different I added mozzarella cheese and without the egg and instead of cheese on top I did homemade Alfredo sauce and mozzarella cheese. Parsley for finished touch.
