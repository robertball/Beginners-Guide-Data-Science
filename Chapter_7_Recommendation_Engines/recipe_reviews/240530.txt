The dressing is a perfect Cobb Salad dressing.  I pretty much followed the recipe although I tend to eye ball the measurements.  I added additional water to thin.  My husband and teenage son were effusive in their praise.  I omitted the blue cheese and onion for the son.  I added some chopped cucumber and some fresh corn leftover from corn-on-the-cobb the previous night.

I made it as directed.   I added extra avocado cubes on top and it was most delicious.   A new favorite.

The only thing "mini" about this  salad is the amount of calories ! It made a delicious and satisfying meal that both children and grown ups enjoyed. And the avocado dressing was so light and refreshing, I will be make it for other salads this Summer. I omitted the onions because of the kids and added some diced avocados. thanks a lot for sharing this recipe.

I'm not a salad person but I gave this a try. This is the best dressing I've ever had! Never ate this much salad in one sitting before.

Pretty good dressing.  I used the avocado I had on hand which was probably not considered a “small” avocado, and ended up having to double the amounts of all of the other ingredients (except the olive oil) to compensate.  I gave 4 stars because I prefer weight, or even volume, measures over size terms like “small.”

We ate every last bit. I thought the avocado dressing might be too much, but I was wrong.

Delicious and easy. I used green onions instead of red, because I had it on hand.
