Instead of grilling this (my Grillmaster and I are separated by about 1500 miles right now, he in Wisconsin, me in Naples),  I prepared this quickly in a sauté pan with the chicken cut into strips for quick cooking.   I eliminated the mustard, and added some white wine.  In my mind, this recipe is way too heavy  on the  lemon, so  I eliminated the lemon zest completely  and just gave the chicken  a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice once it had browned.  With flavors I'm accustomed to and love, there was no way this dish could go wrong  (as long as you hold back on the lemon).  I served this with "Summer Penne Pasta," another AR recipe.

Very tasty and just as the sumbitter states this is easy and light with exceptional flavor! Lemon and rosemary pair well together and this was no exception. I pounded the chicken down thin and poked it with a fork. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for about 6 hours turning it a few times during marinating. Wow - not only was this simple but very tender and bursting with fresh flavor! Thanks for a great recipe Semigourmet!

This recipe is a definite keeper. It was the best bbq chicken breasts I've ever done! The only thing I changed was using dried rosemary and I butterfly cut the breasts.  Will make again and again. UPDATE: Made this again, and still loved the flavour. Forgot to reserve some of the marinade for basting, but still came out juicy and flavourful.

My husband is a picky eater. He claims he does't like spices all that much. Well I made this and he loved it. I pretty much stuck to the recipe as it is but instead of grilling I cooked the chicken in the oven at 400 fro 25 minutes.

We loved the blend of rosemary and lemon and garlic for this chicken.. The best part for me was the mustard which I wouldn't have come up with on my own.. Nice juicy chicken breasts on the grill were the result and we paired them with a greek salad…. Excellent!  Thanks Semigourmet.

Didn't think it had much flavor, but usually we marinate our chicken for hours or even overnight. I'll try this again & put in fridge for maybe 4 hrs next time. Leaving chicken sit out at room temperature in the summer months isn't a good idea.

Really tasty, and made the fresh chicken breast extremely tender. Was just cooking for one, so reduced amounts to do one breast, sliced into four tenders. Used garlic powder and dried rosemary, because that's what I had. Also used rosemary infused olive oil, which helped increase the rosemary flavor.

This is a great recipe: quick, easy and tasty.  I cut the chicken breasts into medallions, gently pounded them to a uniformed thickness, and then lightly brined them before adding the marinade.  Because I brined them, I didn’t add any salt to the marinade.  These were juicy with great flavor and took only minutes to grill.

This recipe makes a fantastic tasting grilled chicken. I cubed my chicken and grilled them kabob style and served over a wild rice blend. I cut back the garlic and used only 4 cloves because 8 would have been too much for DH. If I was making it for me I would have used what was called for. We both love rosemary and I used twice the amount called for. Love what the Dijon mustard does for the marinade. Delicious! Thanks for sharing! It's our new favorite recipe for chicken on the grill and the leftovers are great cold the next day.

Followed the recipe other than did not add salt.  Used Trader Joe's whole grain dijon mustard.   Delicious!   The flavor of the fresh rosemary from my herb garden was excellent.

The whole family was here and all of us loved this chicken, so tender, juicy with a nice fresh summer flavoring. I used all fresh ingredients and did marinate most the day. A very simple summer grilling recipe that we will repeat again.

Only change was that I marinated the chicken in the fridge all day before letting it sit 1/2 hour at room temp.  Got raves from my family and company.

Great recipe!!! I only had honey Dijon mustard in the fridge but, other than that, I made the recipe as it's written. The mustard, lemon and Rosemary created a wonderful contrast of flavors. I will certainly be making this again.

Made it as noted except I only had spicy brown mustard and not Dijon.  It was a fabulous main dish.  I recommend it!  Hard to enjoy grilling in the rain...but that's Washington state.

Excellent!  Especially if you find yourself with an abundance of rosemary.  I enjoy marinating chicken breast cutlets,  cooking on a grill pan indoors and then making yummy sandwiches for the kids school lunches.

Amazing!!! Followed the recipe exactly and this came out great. The one addition I made was adding goat cheese , which complemented all of the other flavors in the recipe perfectly. Paired with a fresh loaf of  three cheese ciabatta bread from jewel. Delicious and super easy.

I made this last night for dinner and it was so good. I used an indoor grill pan since I don't have a gril. I used champagne dill mustard since it was the fancy stuff I had in my house anw, and dried rosemary because the fresh stuff at the store didn't look too good. I'm adding this to my rotation and might try the marinade on pork chops next time.
I pared it with corn on the cob that I roasted and grilled to finish and steamed garlic broccoli.

This is a wonderful recipe! I use rosemary quite a bit but never thought to pair it with mustard. I found all of the flavors balanced and delicious. Thanks,Semigourmet. :o)

First ever marinade that actually enhances the flavor of the meat and not simply sit on the outside like a sticky BBQ sauce does. Each bite was tasty snd delicious. 
Used 1 T of dried rosemary instead of two T fresh.  Only change to the recipe made. Definite keeper

Excellent! A lovely combo of flavors, very Mediterranean. I used a course grind Dijon mustard and had to pan fry, but I cannot wait to make this on the grill! Served it on top of fettuccine noodles.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I was a little nervous about the dijon and lemon lending a bitter flavor, but low and behold there was a perfect balance. None of the marinade ingredients were overpowering. It wasn't bland, but we wished more of the marinade flavors came through. We also enjoyed the low sodium content and didn't think the chicken needed more salt. Will make this again, but will likely marinate the chicken longer or make extra to baste with (we ran out of it pretty fast). I think this would go well with pork too. If you don't have a grill, try making this in a deep skillet and use a little broth or white wine to deglaze the pan to have a little sauce to top the chicken with.

It was amazing, so tender. I marinated about 5 hrs as other reviewers suggested. My husband wants it on a regular basis. Was very easy to prepare.

Moist, delicious and so flavorful. I made this in a pinch and it turned out to be one of our new favorites. I've made it on the grill with boneless breasts as the recipe calls but I've also made it in the oven with chicken thighs. The marinade is so simple yet delicious. We will be making this again and again!

Made it for company the first time and it was an amazing hit.
Because they are skinless,  I watched the chicken breasts carefully so they wouldn't get burned or dry out.
I used fresh rosemary from our garden - serving tip: put 2-3 sprigs of the herb on top when served and it'll really have that gourmet touch!

Easy and quick. Marinated for 3 hours. Used dried rosemary and honey mustard (didn't have Dijon mustard). I will make again and use fresh rosemary and Dijon mustard.

This was very good. I was skeptical when I tasted  the marinade by itself. It seemed very strong and had a heavy mustard taste. But I used chicken thighs, instead of boneless chicken. I basted the chicken with the marinade, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then put it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. It came out wonderful. The skin was crispy and flavorful and the chicken was moist and very tender. It was a winner in our house. I want to try it on the grill,but I don't know how it could be any better.

Breasts remained very juicy, but not a lot of flavor. My son added sirracha sauce to his. I had to add BBQ sauce to mine.

I have lots of fresh Rosemary growing outside and this recipe was fantastic.  I even had a vegetarian rave about it after just a taste.  i used the base recipe for fish substituting dill weed for rosemary.

I made this exactly as called for. It was delicious! I pounded the thicker end of the breast with my palm just to help it cook evenly. I let it marinate for 30 min since the acidity of the lemon juice would start to cook the chicken beyond that. Basting the chicken after turning helped add more flavor. This was easy and we will definitely be enjoying this throughout the summer!

This was a very easy recipe. The   marinade had great flavor. I used fresh lemon juice but only had dried rosemary. Next time I will remember to buy fresh herbs I think it will have a brighter flavor. We grilled the chicken on our outdoor grill, the chicken remained juicy and had nice grill marks. This one stays in the recipe box!

I made this exactly as written other than marinating the chicken for about 4 hours instead of 30 minutes and adding 1/2 tsp salt.   It was delicious!  I served it on a salad dressed with a lemon/mustard/garlic dressing and everyone raved!  Thanks for submitting!

Hubby liked it so will make it again. We don't have an outdoor grill so I cooked this on my kitchen's JennAire grill set to about 9.5-10. It required more than double the time described, at least 20 minutes total even with the breast cut in half. But the chicken breast was thicker than most found in a grocery store.

I have made these...saw a review that said not enough flavor.  Make in the morning, marinate in the refrigerator ALL DAY.  Take out last 1/2-1 hour at room temp., and then grill.  Simply delicious!  (From someone who finds chicken breasts usually dry as shoe leather!)

Loved it, very tasty.
Instead of boneless skinless breasts, we used bone-in thighs.  Let them marinate overnight. Had to grill them for 40 minutes or so with indirect heat waiting for the internal temp to reach 160.

This was excellent.  The only thing I did different was to pound the chicken breasts out so they were a little thinner.  So juicy and great flavor. Will definitely cook these again!

It was excellent, but I think I'll cut back a little on the Rosemary.  I know this is Rosemary chicken, but it was just a little too much.  Other than that the chicken was succulent and delicious.  Another hit with my family.

Delicious, I was worried when I smelled the marinade since it smelled so strong of Dijon mustard but everyone loved it.

I baked it instead of grilling it. I used mustard powder instead of Dijon. I added sliced green onions and chayanne pepper. I used real lemons and wala it was great.

A great recipe, flavorful and juicy my mouth wanted more long after it was finished! I did  substitute a honey mustard as I was low on Dijon and I grilled this on my George Foreman grill as it was 28 degrees outside, I look forward to using an actual grill when the weather permits

I cut the chicken up before cooking it in a pan because I don’t have a grill. It turned out great! I served it up with some green beans I tossed into the pan for the last few minutes and it was delicious. I also eyeballed all of the ingredients and it still turned out great! Super pleased with this recipe;

I cut my breasts into fourths. My rosemary was devoured by something so I used Italian seasoning. Marinated for about 45 min. It was delicious and will go into my chicken rotation!

I made this the other night looking for a quick new idea to BBQ. I used lemon zest in addition to the lemon juice. They were very tender and not dried out at all. Family members all liked it.

Easy, light and quick chicken breast recipe that's a keeper.  I followed the recipe with the following changes: I made two not four chicken breasts so I cut the recipe in half.  The 4 and 5 minute cooking time was too short. The grill preheated to 450 and a total of 17 minutes was perfect. My breasts were  regular size and had a 1" height on one end so because of the thickness, it needed more cooking time.  Thanks Semigourmet for a wonderful tasting chicken that light and fresh and great for summer eating!

This is a recipe I make again and again. If I have time, I let it marinate, but I’m not a griller so I usually I just cook it in the sauce in a pan in the oven. My tip for cooking chicken breast in the oven- do it at 425 degrees and check with a meat thermometer at 20 minutes. I won’t be dry this way.

Delicious and easy!  I loved the heavy lemon and mustard taste.  I didn’t change a thing except I cooked it on my cast iron grill pan on the stove instead of outside.

I added way more garlic as we are that family.    It was amazing and will be making it again!    I also sliced the breast into 2 horizontally  to spread the meat a bit further.

I made this exactly by the recipe except to bake. I found the flavor disappointing. It really sounded like a winner but the flavors of the ingredients which would have shined on their own, just seemed very bland together.

I might have use too much rosemary. Next time some lemon zest and fresh instead of frozen chicken breasts. And add some thighs.

Terrific chicken!  Couldn't get to the grill, so roasted it in the oven for 45 minutes at 425 degrees.  The gravy/sauce leftovers were great on rice the next evening too!

I make this often as my boys really like it. I put all ingredients in a gallon plastic sealable bag then add chicken. When i have time I'll let it marinate for a while otherwise it only marinates maybe 15 minutes. 

Marinating it longer really intensifies and changes the flavor. Both ways produce tasty chicken though.

I dunno if it was me adding more than enough spoons of minced garlic or it is the recipe. sadly, it tasted so garlic . It would be more helpful if you tell number of cloves equate how many spoons or gm of minced garlic.

I made this, marinated overnight and then cooked first in the Sous vide (new toy) then grilled some marks into them. So moist and tasty, no dry chicken breast here.

Absolutely one of the most flavorful chicken recipes I’ve ever had. I cut the breasts up into smaller chunks to make grilling easier. Fresh rosemary just gave this wonderful flavorful. I’m on a rather strict diet and this was such a welcome change from otherwise bland options I’ve been having. I will definitely make this again!

This is a fabulously easy and delicious recipe to make for a different take on chicken. I used skinless, deboned thighs and they were juicy and tasty. I also used fresh rosemary. I think using the skinless breasts called for in the recipe would have resulted in meat that was too dry. I would serve this to guests or everyday. Make plenty and keep for leftovers or sandwiches.

We really enjoyed this chicken. I added 1.5 teaspoons of Kosher salt versus the amount in the original recipe and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. I used a meat thermometer to verify 160 degrees temperature on the grill and it took quite a bit longer than stated in the recipe, but I used very thick chicken breasts. Roughly 8 minutes per side at 475°. I did not have fresh sage so used dried which worked OK. I also put the meat in the olive oil/mustard marinade for six hours prior to putting on the grill.

Delicious recipe. I’ve made this using breast and thigh meat with great results. When necessary, I’ve cooked it in a cast iron skillet and used dried rosemary. Consistently flavorful dish.

Outstanding chicken recipe.  Stuck to the original recipe except used only 1 tbsp. Of fresh Rosemary from my garden as it is very pungent. Also used my Pampered Chef Close n Cut (must have tool) to butterfly the thick chicken breast rather than pounding the meat as other reviewers had to do. This recipe is a keeper

Trying a lot more marinades this summer and this one was pretty good!  I love rosemary.  I let it marinade in fridge for like 5 hours or so, and didn't reserve any for basting (just forgot).  Will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe! I used a thick, stone-ground mustard instead.

It was great! Will make again.

No changes to the ingredients, but I marinated it for several hours. Great garlic-lemon flavor.

I grow my own lemons and rosemary, so this seemed like a perfect recipe to try. So glad I did!! I made the recipe pretty much as written, however I did increase the kosher salt to probably a 1/2 teaspoon. Chicken can be so bland, so I wanted to bump that up. I also forgot to hold back an 1/8th cup of the marinade for a baste, but the chicken could not have been more flavorful or moist. This is a keeper for sure, and even one I'd be proud to serve to guests. I served it with a homemade rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Perfection!

This chicken was amazing and pleased me with every bite.  It was easy to make and it was very healthy.  My whole family loved it!!!  The marinade made the chicken juicy and alive with flavor.

Only change I wade was marinading it about an hour. Was very moist and great flavor. Also good the next day on a chicken sandwich. I did grill it over apple wood.

Marinated this for a few hours  in the fridge before cooking.Added a tablespoon more Dijon and the juice of a full lemon, about 3 tablespoons worth,  and 1 additional tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade. The chicken came out moist and super tasty!

This recipe turned out really well.  Easy to make, cooks quickly.  I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used honey mustard, but followed the rest of the recipe.  Nice blend of flavors.  I will definitely make this again

Made exactly as written except that grilling time took a little longer.  Came out good and very moist, but mustard was a little strong.  I might reduce the amount of mustard next time.

It was tasty! I marinated it over night and it was a bit strong on the mustard taste but it may have been due to the marinating time and I used horseradish mustard. I would make it again!

Made the recipe exactly as written, to include marinating time. The flavor was very good, but didn't seem to penetrate into the actual chicken, just remain on top. I would recommend this recipe, but I would recommend it be marinated for at least four hours. That being said, if you forget to marinade ahead of time and only have a half hour it will work and still taste good. To be amazing - marinate it for at least 4 hours.

It smelled great cooking! The marinade was easy and tasty. The only substitution made was the chicken was cooked using a grill pan on the stove. Very tasty, but I would like to try marinating it longer. But for a fast easy meal, this works great. Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe.  I took out three big chicken breasts from the freezer in the morning.  Followed the recipe. Grilled the breasts along with some zucchini, corn and fresh bread.  Great dinner.  Easy to scale to larger groups too.

I always triple the marinade recipe and baste often when on the grill.  This marinade is the REAL DEAL; I have a six people with VERY different palettes; they all love this recipe.  I've also used this marinade on chicken wings.

I used dried rosemary and added juice from a lime and orange, then marinated over night. It had that citrus flavor that is nice but I think would have been better with fresh rosemary. Chicken thighs marinate well and you can bake and finish off under broiler.

This chicken recipe is AMAZING! It was easy, fun, and extremely delicious. I will definitely be making this many more times. Thanks for posting it.

Side notes: I did double up on the some of the ingredients (based off of some of the other reviews) and I also pounded out the chicken, marinated for several hours, and cooked in a pan (I don't have an outdoor grill).

Good Rosemary flavor. The garlic didn't dominate until I boiled the marinade and added it to pasta. Chicken was really good, not bland. I too added a little white wine for flavor and added bulk to the marinade to add to the pasta I fixed with the chicken. Added mushrooms to the sauce before adding the pasta.

I intended to make this exactly as written the first time, but accidentally bought boneless skinless whole breasts, so I had double the amount of chicken and not the marinade.  However, even with these wonky proportions, it was STELLAR.  We grill chicken every week time, so I needed something new, and this hit the spot.  I can't wait to try it with basil or dill from my garden instead of the rosemary as a change, but I don't imagine it could get any better.  Thanks, SemiGourmet, for a great recipe.  A KEEPER!

Excellent ! Easy to make. 
I would reduce the lemon a bit.
I marinated for several hours as that suited my schedule but am sure shorter marination will also be great!
I used regular mustard instead of Dijon. It was still great.

Followed recipe exactly with 5 chicken breasts, halved and marinated for 4 hours.  Delicious, light and has a nice presentation!  I did have to cook in the oven, as a storm was looming.  Everyone enjoyed this!

WOW this was so moist and tender, even Bob made that comment,  the combination of seasonings is perfect.  The only thing different  I used a fresh sprig of rosemary on the chicken when I grilled it in addition to dried rosemary in the marinade.
Definitely a keeper.

Enjoyed the flavor, unfortunately, we overlooked it a bit on the grill. But the combination of the mustard, garlic and lie on juice was very good. Might increase the lemon a little next time. But I would recommend this recipe

THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
... added the juice of a whole lemon (small) and extra E.V.O.O.----the mustard was omitted;  it was allowed to sit marinating for two hours. 
I cooked the chicken on the stove top instead of grilling-----it was pouring outside; I began by searing each side of the meat then slowly cooking on a medium heat until done. 

It was so moist & tender... and the rosemary sauce was AMAZING! I wanted to lick the plates clean! LOL

This is a pretty clean recipe, which is a bonus.  You can fine tune the garlic if you are not a fan, we LOVE garlic – so I used all 8 cloves and fresh rosemary off my plant.  I marinated the chicken for over an hour, I used 4T of olive oil instead of 3T, I use fresh lemon juice and freshly ground black pepper. I grilled it outside – it was fantastico!!!  Great grill marks and fantastic left over, too. Definite do-over at our house!

I don't have a grille so I cooked it for about 15 minutes at 350 and then the last 10 at 450 and it came out perfectly cooked. I also didn't reserve any for marinade, I just dumped whatever was left on top of the chicken when I put it in the oven. It was so so good. I just made it on Friday and I'm going to make it again tomorrow (Wednesday), just because it was that good.

As everyone indicated, this was an easily prepped dish.  I marinated for close to 2 hours (mostly in fridge).  I followed recipe exactly otherwise, except used 3 large chicken breasts instead of 4.  I love garlic, but in this case it was overly intense and tended to overpower the dijon and rosemary.  Will make again, but probably cut back the garlic to 4-5 cloves instead of 8.  Chicken was juicy and tasty (other than being too heavy on the garlic).

Other than using chicken thighs rather than chicken breast, I made this as written.  It is very good, and will probably become a regular "go-to" for grilled chicken.

This is fantastic. I baked in the oven (no grill), but I imagine it is even better on the grill or in my cast iron skillet. Leftovers are going to be great on a salad! I'll make this often.

Some of the best grilled chicken we've ever made!  I used juice from a fresh orange instead of lemon juice because I didn't have any lemon and it came out just as great. let marinate in the bag for about 2 hours.

EASY EXCELLENT. This was very good. I used all ingredients and we enjoyed lemon flavour.  I watched carefully not to dry out and it was very nice. I did use bone in pork however.
Would certainly do again, but will also try chicken.

I made it per recipe but the pieces were much thicker. I simply increased grilling time. The chicken was juicy and flavorful.

Used dried rosemary and did not marinade for 30 minutes because we were in a time crunch.  It turned out delicious and was very flavorful.   My whole family  loved it.   Super easy and chicken was moist.

It's great the first time you cook it. I didn't have a grill, so I used a George Forman, which probably didn't keep some of the juices or flavor in. Next time, I will use a real grill.

Very delicious.  We didn't have a BBQ at the time so I used my George Foreman Grill and it worked great.  It was juicy.

this was super tasty.. i doubled the recipe for a little over 2 lbs of boneless/skinless breasts and thighs.. i subbed garlic powder (2 tsp) and dried rosemary for the fresh and added an extra T of lemon (bottled).. i upped the salt to 1 T and yes it was a little salty, but in a good way.. this marinated for a little over 24 hours and i'm sure that helped with the flavor.. me and bf really enjoyed this dish and are looking forward to making it again.. ty for the recipe!

Yes!  I'd make a little extra sauce though - so I'd have more for basting the chicken.  I'd also lengthen the marinade time to one hour - at room temperature.

Very tasty! 

I doubled the recipe so it covered all of the chicken and let it marinade for a little over 1 hour. My dinner guests thought is was awesome and couldn't believe that is was so simple to make and healthy.

It was very bland. Made it just as written. I don't think it marinates long enough at 30 minutes.

I was looking for something different to do with chicken breasts and I'm very glad I found this recipe! The flavor was exceptional, the chicken was moist and tender. I used garlic salt and left out the additional salt. Even with regular mustard, it was perfect!!

Excellent. Believe it or not, I am a vegetarian. But I do cook meat for friends, now and then. I used this with a group of meat eaters and they LOVED it. I have no idea how it tasted, but the meat eaters could not stop telling me how good it was! They said it was moist and the flavors were delicious. I only had two chicken breasts; I also had thighs and drumsticks - and it still worked. I did not have access to an outdoor grill, so I baked it at 500 degrees, for about 10 minutes, and then broiled it and basted it a LOT, turning it over several times. I used the reserve rosemary/mustard mixture for basting, and noticed that the chicken had a lot of juice that I could baste with, too. It was also beautiful on the platter. I laid it out with rosemary (fresh) and lemon wedges all around the edges of the platter. I served it with spaghettini con arugula and fresh plum tomatoes. Almost makes a gal want to go back to eating carne :D

This recipe had mixed reviews in my house.  I personally thought it was wonderful and had great flavor.  My husband thought the rosemary was overwhelming and detracted from the overall taste.  I think if you are a fan of rosemary you will love this.   Rosemary does have a strong taste, so, if you don't love it - just reduce the amount of rosemary you add to the marinade.  The only thing I did different was to broil it instead of grill it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I used chicken leg/backs. Really good on the bbq.
