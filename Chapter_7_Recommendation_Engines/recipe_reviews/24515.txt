We have made these three times now and will many times again.  No kids in our house, he's grown and on his own, but we adults LOVE these!  We have done them in hot dog buns and without the olives as I do not like them at all.  We have tried different cheese as toppers and trust me when I say EXPERIMENT with the cheese!  Thank you so much for this recipe Karen!

I love this! So did my family. I did a little variation - I used 2 boiled eggs instead of 3. I didn't have processed cheese, so I used 3 slices of cheddar and diced them. Cut down a little on the mayo. Added some cracked pepper into the mixture. I omitted the olives (because I'm not into them) but kept the sweet relish and onions, but cut down to half an onion, coz I thought the one I had was too big. I put the mixture on 4 hotdog buns (there is a lot of mixture, but maybe I have small hotdog buns) then I sprinkled paprika and a bit more pepper on top before wrapping in aluminium foil and into the oven. Love it!!! Going to make this again soon.

This is very similar to the recipe I make except I use only 2 eggs, mayo, and 4 slices wrapped Kraft American cheese torn into pieces and mixed in. I don't use onion or relish. I do use the olives though. I spread my hot dog or hamburg roll with margarine and put tuna mixture on top. I bake in a 350 oven around 20 min. My kids have grown up on these and love them. So with these changes is why I gave it 5*. Thanks Karen!

This was more like egg salad than tuna, and way too cheesy. It was OK, but I probably won't make it again. It's worth a shot if you like lots of cheese. It doesn't reheat well at all.

I really liked this method of fixing these sandwiches.  I used my own leftover tuna salad and put it on a wheat bun.

Good flavor and easy to prepare. This had enough variety of flavor that a non-fish eater, as I am, had no trouble eating three of these sandwiches.

Normally I don't like sweet relish but used it anyway and I'm glad I did!  These were wonderful!  Oh, didn't have an onion but used green onion, and only had american cheese on hand.

Hubby and I loved this gormet tasting sandwich!  My 4 year old didn't.  It might have been a bit cheesy, but we love cheese.  Will make again.

Loved this!!! I made a few changes based on what I had on and and to keep it low cal. I cut the cheese in half, used light mayonnaise, and no relish. My husband loved it! They were also great to make up extra of, wrap in foil and keep in the fridge for a quick warm up meal. Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe creates mouth watering tuna bun. Chilly tuna was used as filling. On top of the original canned tuna, I added in some well browned onion and cracked black pepper. This additional ingredients will enhance savoury flavour in this bun. I baked the bun with  insulated cookie sheet , therefore it create less browning at the bottom the bun.

This was good, but didn't go over as well as "Simple Tuna Melts." It also seemed to make a lot more than the recipe indicated, and I filled those buns! If I make this again, I'll swap out the processed cheese (too globby, yuck!) for a slice of cheddar or pepper jack.

This is a fabulous recipe. However, when I changed the number of servings from 4 to 8, it came up with 37 cups of olives! I think that would be a 'tad' overpowering!

I used 2 eggs, 2 cans of tuna, the sweet relish, the onion, not even half a cup of mayo{not salad dressing}and probably about 1/4 pound of Velveeta, I omitted the olives. I did add a small rib of celery finely diced for a bit of crunch. This was enough for 8 buns. I baked for about 25 minutes at 350. Eeveryone loved them except my oldest and she thought I was trying to serve her a tuna melt which she had proclaimed great distaste for a couple of days before I had these. All in all, a really nice change of pace both at the dinner table and on the tastebuds. Who doesn't like tuna salad? We'll have this one again, thanx!

I want to give this a 5 but have to settle on 4 so let me explain. I kept all of the measurements the same but felt the need to sub 2 of the ingredients due to personal preference. I used real mayo versus the Miracle Whip and dill relish in place of the sweet (This is how we like our tuna for cold sammies). This was excellent! I must admit that I think it tasted better room temp than it did heated and  that says a lot because I prefer warm food over cold/room temp. The tuna gets more fishy heated. With that being said,  go hot or cold (whichever floats your boat) and you won't be disappointed. I am not a tuna lover and this impressed me!
