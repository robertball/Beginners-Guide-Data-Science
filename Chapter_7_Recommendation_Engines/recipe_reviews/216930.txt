I am never buying granola bars from the store again.  I used only the quick cooking oats, added sunflower seeds and omitted the mixed nuts.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. Baked these suckers for 10 minutes.  And now I'm stuffing my face with one.  Delicious.

my husband does not like nuts so i just omitted  them altogether. substituted 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup craisins (dried cranberries) and used 3 cups old-fashioned oats.  i added about 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 tsp cinnamon mixed it up really good before adding the sweetened condensed milk.  after pressing into the pan i drizzled some honey on the top along with a cinnamon sugar blend.  ooohhhhhh it was so good.  my husband and my 5 year old beg me to make this.  making it at least twice a week.

AWESOME recipe! I make these for snacks for my kids (and hubby) to take to school. My daughter has a peanut allergy, and many store bought granola bars have peanut flour. So, I tried these, and we fell in love with the taste and simplicity! I make a double batch,  individually cut and bag them, and stick them in the freezer. I do not use the parchment paper as a liner, but do use it to push them down firmly into the pan. I also have used a super-easy, no cook recipe on here for Sweetened Condensed milk, which works fabulously if you don't have it on hand. I only had old-fashioned oats, and did not miss the quick-cooking oats. I have tried all sorts of variations, such as chocolate chip and cinnamon raisin. Thanks for a fabulous recipe, that has become a staple in our house!

Terrific granola bar! To make it non-dairy, I used one can of coconut milk and 3 tbsp honey. I also used flax seed, millet and sunflower seeds in place of the mixed nuts. Good for the whole family!

The condensed milk is a great way to keep the granola together. They turned out perfectly the first time. These are so easy to make, and fun to create bars to our own personal taste. I use dried apricots and sliced almonds for one batch and peanut butter chips for another. I took these to a group function and was given many compliments. My husband has requested we have them with breakfast every day. I omitted the condensed milk for one batch and tried using peanut butter and honey. I think it cooked too long because they were really crunchy. I wound up making granola with that batch...which is perfect in the yogurt I'm eating now!

Very easy - I used dried cherries (should have cut them up but didn't) and turned out great.  I also used pecans in place of almonds.  I'll be making this one again and again and again.

This is one of the best granola bar recipes I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  It doesn't fall apart when you cut it like so many do.  Our school division is nut-free, so I subbed out all the nuts and seeds for a combination of coconut, Rice Krispies, chocolate chips and ground flax seed.  I look forward to trying new combinations and adding nuts in over the summer holidays.

Love this recipe! It is so flexible. I have been making every week, and change up the nuts and dried fruit. One week I added coconut and macadamia nuts, another some cashews. It's a perfect, healthy snack!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for - a simple way to cook ahead of time my usual morning oatmeal + dried fruit + nuts, without having to add a bunch of other ingredients. For me the parchment made a huge difference, without that the bars fell apart when I removed them from the pan. Also I like to mix up the dry ingredients before putting in the condensed milk, I find it easier to get an even distribution that way.

This was a great base for granola bars!  I have used several different combinations of nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, fruit, etc. and they have all turned out wonderful!  I would suggest adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp honey with the sweetened condensed milk, as it seems to help them stick together a little more.  My husband can't get enough of these, and they are much more economical than buying 4-5 boxes a week! :)

No. 1 = I never rate recipes (this is about my 3rd rating in the last 6 years) No. 2 = I hate sweetened condensed milk. That being said, I had a can of that stuff to get rid of, and I had tried countless granola bar recipes that turned out OK, but definitely more cookie or cake like and not comparable to the chewy kind you get at the store. Wow was I surprised, perfect! Once cooled, they cut into perfect bars and held together. And the taste was, by everyones measure.....far far far superior than all brands. I used all rolled oats, craisins, walnuts, coconut, and sunflower seeds. Next time, its crunchy peanuts and chocolate chips.

I can't even tell you how much we love this recipe. It is now a staple in our house! One tip, line your pan with parchment paper - this is sticky!
We have modified this so many ways, that I now use a basic ratio of 3 C rolled oats (I don't seem to ever have quick-cook)+ 1 can sweetened condensed milk + 1 C dried cranberries + 2 C assorted etc. The etc. has included 1/2 c. almonds, 1 c. mini chocolate chips (everyone's favorite!), 1 c. raisins, 1/2 c. cinnamon chips, 1/2 c. flax seeds, 1/2 c. dried coconut, crushed walnuts... mix anything you have on hand that sounds good, as long as the total doesn't exceed 2 cups. When I don't use cinnamon chips I always add a dash of cinnamon to the oats before mixing. Such an easy recipe, and all the kids (and adults, too!)love it! Thank you.

This is a great base recipe.  I used all old fashioned oats, 1 full cup slivered almonds, 1/3 c chia seed, 2/3 c hemp seed and 1 c dried cranberries and mixed it all with homemade sweetened condensed milk.  I baked them about 30 minutes and my kids loved them!

I made this with my kids and it turned out great! It is a wonderful snack for them that is pretty healthy. We ground up in a nut crusher: Walnuts, almonds and sunflower seeds. We also chopped up an entire bag of dried cherries. I only had the bars in for 17 min and they were perfect. My kids LOVE them. I will be making again with other nuts and dried fruit :o) I have only seen granola bars that use corn syrup - I love that this does not have it.

So simple. Mix and match nuts/fruit for your favorites (don't be afraid to experiment). I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to dry ingredients; MIX DRY INGREDIENTS WELL BEFORE ADDING CONDENSED MILK. I opened the condensed milk can and added 1 tablespoon of unpasteurized honey and 1 tsp. vanilla right into to the can; stir well. Pour condensed milk over dry ingredients and mix for several minutes to ensure dry ingredients are well coated. LINE PAN WITH PARCHMENT PAPER for even browning and easy cleanup! The best and easiest granola bar ever!

Just took them out of the oven, fantastic!  Didn't have sw. condensed milk, & my substitution chart used evaporated milk+1 c. sugar+3 T. butter = sw. cond. milk.  I added the can of evaporated milk, about 1/2 c. sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 egg, no butter.  Also added a handful of coconut, some chopped dates, ground almonds & walnuts, whole mixed nuts, plus a couple tablespoons of pepitas, sunflower kernels, rice flour, sesame seeds, flax meal.  Sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger on top, then drizzled with molasses.....  baked for 30 min in shallow jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper.  Amazing results!

I used 1 3/4 cups of different kinds of nuts mixed and 1/4 cup of flax seed - I put all of these in my blender and chopped them so there wouldn't be large chunks of nuts in the bars. I liked using the sweetened condensed milk instead of oil or honey or brown sugar. I did also add a half teaspoon of vanilla. I added 2 big spoonfuls of peanut butter too. They came out very tasty!

AMAZING.  I have eight children and they love granola bars.  I have tried to make some before but they were crumbly and dry.  I didn't like the "glue" being honey and oil.....this "glue" is awesome.  I used sweetened condensed milk from this site, simply calculating it for 14 oz.  AMAZING taste.

I was leary of the sweetened condensed milk, because I thought it might be too sweet.  NOT at all.  It added just enough sweetness.  Swaped out a couple of the fruit/nut suggestions, but made sure I kept it to the right amounts.  I also added a dash of salt.  Only baked 17 minutes for another review.  They baked up perfectly chewy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW!  My 4 year old daughter and I made these today.  Super easy for young ones to help make and DELICIOUS!  We used slivered almonds, craisins, mini chocolate chips and coconut.  Can't wait to try other combinations.

The Quaker Oats guy has lost my business!  This was easy to make and allows for some fun creativity.  I added cinnamon, vanilla, and honey to the mixture and it came out just great.  Can't wait to make these again!  :)

This is a fantastic recipe. Definitely my favorite granola bar recipe. I know it's not quite as healthy as the ones with less sugars, but I don't care -- this is the GOOD stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews I knew I had to make this recipe. I did add 1/4 cup of honey, 2 tsp cinnamon,  2 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of sea salt all for flavor. The bars turned great at 17 mins cooking time so I removed them from oven and let them cool completely before cutting.  The star of this recipe is the sweetened condensed milk....it keeps the bar chewy and it won't crumble.

I keep making these over and over again!  The most recent incarnation was 1 3/4 cups of old fashioned oats, 1 cup roasted sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup almonds, 1/2 cup craisins, and 1 1/2 cup rice crispies.  I also line the parchment paper with rice crispies to make the bottoms even less sticky.  I've been making different versions of these bars for almost 6 months and have had nothing but positive reviews from people who have tried them.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe is super easy and can be customized to your liking.  The condensed milk added just the right amount of sweetness to the recipe.  The only problem that I had was keeping the bars together.  They seem to crumble everywhere.  Not sure If I did something wrong.  I think next time that I will try adding a bit honey to help them keep there shape.

I love starting my day with a granola bar and I can't foresee myself ever buying them from the store again. This recipe is so easy and so delicious, and it is a lot of fun experimenting with different mixtures. I make a new batch every week!

Wow!!!  I made these last night, and am now enjoying for breakfast, so good!  I make my own granola cereal, so I always have a variety of nuts and dried fruits on hand.  For these bars I used toasted almonds, walnuts, cashews, crasins, rasins, apricots, plums and flax seed.  I also added 1 tsp. of almond extract and 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  I am so excited to play with other variations, thank you so much this is a really great recipe!

Such a great base recipe! I used 3c quick oats, because I didn't have any old-fashioned. I also used 1c salted mixed nuts, 1c mixed raisins/craisins, and 1c bittersweet chocolate. Baked for 15 minutes, but could have used about 5 more for the right chewiness. Delicious, and I will use this again and again!

Not really impressed by these.  They were very dry and crumbly and I only baked them 25 minutes for chewy per the recipe.  I did use homemade condensed milk from a recipe on this site and I made that sugar-free so I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.  I'll try this recipe maybe one more time and add more condensed milk.

Fantastic!!!  I have tried other granola bar recipes and they were not making again.  These are very moist, a good base to go by.  I used quick oats and  sunflower seeds in place of pumpkin seeds.  Also added white chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips, and pine nuts.  I will definately make these again.  My husband said it wasn't sweet enough for him, I found they were just right.

Made these tonight for the first time - adjusted the recipe a little to add some chocolate chips and coconut, and a bit of honey because the cans of sweetened condensed milk are smaller here.  They turned out wonderfully and I"ll definitely be making these again!  The taste and texture were just wonderful.

These are terrific!  I didn't have pumpkin seeds, so I added flax seeds instead.  They were great in there.  I also used mixed dried fruits in place of the cranberries.  We will be making these again.  As good as these are, there is no reason to buy granola bars ever again!

I made these last night in order to use up a bag of Trader Joes Trail Mix and some extra sweetened, shredded coconut. WOW these went over well at the office! I bring in items at least twice a week, and nothing has ever disappeared so fast! I would recommend refrigerating these for about 20 minutes before cutting to ensure clean cut lines. I can't wait to experiment with lots of different add-ins! The sweetened condensed milk makes these granola bars incredible!

The second time making this recipe I toasted the nuts and the pumpkin seeds, which seemed to enhance the flavor. I also baked them for 25 to 30 minutes, instead of 20 as I did the first time, which made them more crunchy which I liked better.

I don't often leave reviews, good or bad; but this one definitely deserves a five star rating. It's great as it is and is a perfect place to begin exploring new flavor combinations. Spread them out thin on a jelly roll pan for more crunchy texture, or in the 13 x 9" dish for thicker and chewier. Very easy! Like brownies, the crisp, chewy  edges are the best. I bet anyone with one of those goofy "all edges" brownie pans would get great results!

This recipe is fantastic!  Already made it three times.  I omitted the pumpkin seeds, added flax seed, and also added in some dried cherries. For one of the batches I spread a little honey on the top before baking and was yummy. Very adaptable recipe to experiment with.  As long as you have approx. 3 cups of add-ins, it works out great.  The last batch I used dried cherries, raisins, and chocolate chips and completely omitted the nuts and cranberries. Received rave reviews. The sweetened condensed milk works out perfectly.

I made this just as written and am very pleased.  Yet this recipe is very easy to change to your own taste or to what nut/dried fruit is on hand.  I was concerned it would be too sweet but it isn't.  I can see this becoming my favorite "base" recipe for granola bars.
It is now 2019 and I’m still making this.  Sometimes as bars and sometimes stirred to make granola to top yogurt.

Making this recipe was my first attempt at any sort of home made granola.  Wow!  This was so easy and so yummy!  I used mixed nuts and craisins.  I didn't measure them after I chopped them so my mixture was a little too dry.  I added a little honey to give it some more sticking power and it turned out perfectly.  Wondering if you could sub the honey for the condensed milk entirely and eliminate some of the sugar calories?

This is the best granola bar recipe.  It is easy to make.  Everyone in my family liked the bars.  I adapted the recipe to be dairy free.  I substituted sweetened coconut milk and honey for the condensed milk using the same amount of ounces.  This made the mixture too wet, so next time I will use less coconut milk.  I used all old-fashioned oats.  I used pumpkin seeds, walnuts chopped and sunflower seeds for the nuts.  Because the bars were too wet I cut them and flipped them and had to cook them extra long to get them to brown for a crunchy bar.

Excellent! I made these on Monday and by Saturday I am still getting requests for the recipe. I am gonna try it tonight with coconut milk because I want them to be a little healthier. Fingers crossed.
*note: do not use coconut milk.  They just get mushy.

These are wonderfully easy to make and even better to eat! I did make one very small addition ~ just before going in the oven, I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar. The texture is what we call in our house, "crunchewy" - Perfect!

Great recipe! Love the use of condensed milk, it is really easy.
I used 3 cups of quick cooking oats, added some roasted almonds, ground flax seeds and sunflower kernels, to replace the pumpkin seeds and mixed nuts that I didn't have. It turned out so delicious! 
Definitely one of my favorite recipes

A bit bland.  I will use it as a base for granola bars, but it needs some spicying up a bit.

Pretty good.  I used homemade  sweetened condensed milk from this site.  Also used chocolate chips, soy nuts, sunflower seeds, and raisens.(its all I had) Also added ground flax seed and wheat germ.  I liked it.  Mainly only used this recipe as a base.  Never tried condensed milk before in granola bars.  Turned out quite nice.  Next time Ill used just regular rolled oats.  I'm not a fan of the quick cooking oats.  Good recipe.

I used 5 packets of Sugar Free Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal, 1/4 cup of wheat germ, 1 cup old fashioned oats, 2 cups Walmart's Indulgent Trail mix and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  Turned out pretty good.  Should have been taken out of the oven at around 17 or 18 min and forgot to buy parchment paper so I had to use tin foil.  Bad idea!  I had to flip the whole thing over and carefully peel the foil off a little at a time.  Now that they're all cut up and in the container my husband and I are having trouble stopping!

great recipe but I made the mistake of adding honey before I realized how sweet sweetened condensed milk is.  Definitely doesn't need any additional sweeteners.

My kids and I made these today.  We added chocolate chips, some shredded coconut, craisins, and peanut butter to the condensed milk.  The flavor is amazing, but in a 9x13 pan they came out very thin.  I used 3 cups of rolled oats and the fillings equalling 3 cups.  Next time I will make these in a smaller pan.

This is just so mind-blowingly easy that once you have the basic ratio of oatmeal to sweetened condensed milk down, you can customize at will according to what you and your family like best. I just use all old-fashioned oats to make things easier.

Really wish I could give this recipe a better rating but it was just OK. I made them with dried cherries, almonds and semi sweet chocolate chips and the end product was lacking something. Not sure if it needed salt or sweet or vanilla but the flavor was not as good as it could be. I even added about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  to the condensed milk. I think I may try to tweak the recipe to develop the flavor a bit.  Maybe a bit more vanilla mixed in and a dash of salt on top just before popping into the oven.

This recipe is delicious! I substituted the pumpkin seeds, almonds, and cranberries with 2 cups of organic trail mix. I can't wait to try different, seasonal variations of this recipe. Perfect texture and taste!

This is my new favorite go-to recipe for a relatively healthy snack. I used only quick cooking oats and 3 cups of trail mix (or whatever I have) and they turned out great. Another tip for getting them pressed into the pan - place a separate sheet of parchment paper over the top and press down. No sticking!
Great recipe!

This is perfect just the way written. I measure (except the condensed milk - to be added later) into a baggie for a second batch which cuts the prepare time to nothing...tried it with several of the substitutions and its still perfect.

This was really easy. Mix all the dry ingredients and then add the sweetened condensed milk, bake, and presto! Yummy granola bars. I used all old-fashioned oats, sunflower seeds instead of pumpkin, added some chocolate chips, and followed the recipe for everything else. Really, I added whatever was in my pantry. I cooked for 17 minutes and they have the perfect consistency. Soft and not too sweet! Excited to make these again. SO EASY and great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy to make and so delicious, I couldn't stop eating them.  And yes, the kids loved them, too.  They did stick to the wax paper though and I ended up having to scrape them off the paper.  Will use a non-stick pan next time.  But other than that, great, easy recipe.

So easy and delicious!  I love how you can tailor this to your own personal taste.  I added about 1/2 C of Rice Krispies to add a little crunch.  I like my bars a little on the chewy side so I only baked for about 18 minutes and they were perfect.  I will definitely be making these now instead of buying the store bought ones.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My husband loved it!  They are great and so much more filling than the bars you get in the store.  Also, very adaptable, just put in whatever you have in the house or what you like to eat.  Make sure your dry ingredients equal the equivalent of the ingredients listed here and you are good to go.

We LOVE these bars! We put raisins & dried apricots (cut up) in ours for the fruit. And we put shredded coconut, sunflower seed & either chocolate chips, mini m&m's or peanut butter chips & chocolate chips. The first time I made them they didn't stick together so the next time I didn't pack the cups when I measured. I left just a smidge of room and they where amazing! I cook them for 23 minutes and they are amazing every time. I have to spray the paper really really well though, esp the sides or the bars stick to it. Best bar recipe I have ever made!!! Thank you so much for sharing!

A very versatile recipe, perfect for accommodating extra ingredients. I used it as a base and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg, a generous tablespoon of natural peanut butter, flaked unsweetened coconut, sesame seeds, and chocolate chips. I also used entirely rolled (old fashioned) oats, no quick oats. They turned out delicious. Keep an eye on them in the oven though, if you have an apartment sized (and hot) oven like mine, the edges browned to perfection in 18 minutes. Once cooled they were firm yet chewy. If you want more of a crunchy bar, let them cook for longer. Would definitely make again!

Whatever I have in the cupboard works well in these granola bars; I have used pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, added some flaxseed, choc chips, and whatever mix of nuts is available. Delicious every time!

I liked this recipe a lot and I will make it again.The only trouble that I had was in cutting them. I laid down to take a nap and when I got up, I cut them, but they fell a bit apart. Not sure why? Maybe more of the sweetened condensed milk is needed to keep them together? I added cut up dark chocolate to mine. Will definitely try again!

I followed the recipe featured in dec/Jan 2019 issue of allrecipes magazine. As suggested in a sidebar, I used coconut milk and honey in place of sweetened condensed milk. At no point did this mixture become a bar. I increased the cooking time which did not help and it ended up being soggy with softened nuts. It was an expensive failure.

There are no words to describe how freakin' delicious these are!!! My entire family devoured them. The only change up was that I added chocolate chips on top prior to baking. I also baked them exactly 20 minutes as to not burn; they came out golden brown. Will definitely make again and again and again. Enjoy!

Hard to cut after 5 minutes. Cut into rows. Let cool. Then cut into squares, used 3 cups old fashioned oats following recipe in the magazine

Great recipe.  I did make some changes, but only to suit the taste preferences of my family not because there was anything lacking with this recipe.  
I used 2 cups of peanuts instead of seeds.  I also added 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of cranberries.  (These bars are VERY chocolatey.)  Cooking times and temp were perfect with this recipe.  It's a good, simple base to use and add what you and your family likes.  
Also, I used a pizza cutter to cut the slab of granola into bars.  It worked better than using a knife.  :)

So easy to make, these high protein bars are delicious and nutritious, without added preservatives, colors or flavors. I put some in the freezer, not just to preserve them in good condition, but to stop them being eaten too quickly. They are so popular!

As someone else did, I added cinnamon, brown sugar and honey.  When your fitness crazed finicky teenager gives you a thumbs up, you know it's good.  Just bought a bunch of supplies to make more.  First batch lasted a week.  Definitely make again.

I liked the taste of these, but they did not hold together very well for me. Maybe because I used low-fat sweetened condensed milk?

Tastes very good.  Sweetened condensed milk comes in a 300 ml size here.   I just kept throwing dry ingredients into a large measure until I had 4.5 cups. That worked great.

Ridiculously gooey and sticky, and that's not a good thing for something you might want to eat on the fly. You definitely need a water source to wash off after eating one of these.

They taste mostly of raw oatmeal, so I'd toast the oatmeal in advance. The condensed milk all runs to the bottom of the pan, making an almost frosted, goopy mess at the bottom and a dry, raw oatmeal mess at the top. I've cut them into bars and am storing them upside down in the hope of some of that condensed milk working its way back down through the bar.

Not making this one again.

Yummmmm! I made these bars with coconut, macadamia nuts, slivered almonds and mini chocolate chips and they were amazing! My husband raved about them and prefers these over any store bought bars. I guess I'll be making these weekly-- I can't wait to try another variation. The possibilities are endless!

Made these for my husband and boys as they wanted a sweet treat in the house.  I only had a small bite (due to dietary reasons), but my guys love them.!!! This is one of those great recipes that you can adjust to your taste buds. Thank you for your submission.

I added the egg, as many commenters suggested and it held together nicely. Next time I'll cut the sweetened condensed milk down cause they were a little too chewy for me.

Terrific recipe!  I used all quick oats and  a combination of dried blueberries, chopped pecans, and coconut.  I can't wait to make them again with another fruit and nut combination.  I'm also going to use fat free sweetened condensed milk the next time.

Wow! The easiest and best tasting granola bars we've ever eaten! Just as others have mentioned, you can use all sorts of ingredients and they'll be delicious every time . I've used walnuts, cacao chocolate chips, flax meal, almonds, dried fruits.... anything and everything you can find in granola or trail mix and it comes out awesome every time. I've always kept the oats and condensed milk consistent while changing up the nuts and dried fruit. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

More please!! That was the comment I got from my first batch. My counter top is full of possibilities for more. Pepitas, soy nuts, sunflower seeds, coconut, mixed nuts (chopped). flax seed and every sort of dried fruit I can find. I too, used only quick oats.  I lined a jelly roll pan with parchment (cookie sheet with sides) and used more parchment paper on top to flatten with a rolling pin. Smoosh the sides up to square it up. I baked it for 15 minutes, cooled it for 5 then cut the bars with a pizza cutter when removed from the cookie sheet.  Good chance to get the kids interested in cooking by picking out their own concoctions! Love this!

These are absolutely wonderful! I will be making these once a week!  I used what I had on hand:  3c instant oats, chopped almonds, sunflower seeds, craisins, and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg. I only baked for 18 min and I think even 15min would be good for a chewy bar. At 18min they are chewy in the middle with crispy edges which I really like.

I love these! Great for a quick breakfast. I made them pretty much exactly as is, except I used less quick cooking oats because I didn't have enough. I think I will cook for 30 minutes next time for more crunch.

To my family I'm the Seattle Granola Queen, now I also wear the crown of Granola Bar Queen.  Thank you SeattleFarmersMarketGirl for letting me share your monarchy! I'm allergic to almonds and my teenagers don't like seeds in their granola, so keeping the nut/fruit ratios the same as your recipe, I used three cups rolled oats (only kind I had), one cup each chopped pecans and walnuts, 3/4 cup chopped dates and 1/4 cup chopped unsweetened, dried coconut. Because I like a touch of salt in my granola, I added 1/2 tsp. sea salt. The sweetened condensed milk was key! I've never liked store-bought granola bars, so do 't buy them. I'm sure this will fast become a family favorite.  I look forward to trying more fruit/nut combinations going forward!

I make these all the time and my boyfriend loves em.  I usually will add a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon.  I dont think I have ever stuck to the ingredients called for with the exception of the oats.  I have added all diff. dried fruits and nuts and every batch is great.

This is a great recipe because of how versatile it is. These turn out wonderfully with the ingredients the recipe calls for but you can really throw whatever you have in your cabinets into the mix and they still come out great! I like to melt peanut butter - just a couple of table spoons - in the microwave and drizzle it on top before baking. Taking into consideration how much a box of granola bars costs in the grocery vs. how much it costs if you buy everything bulk and make these, this is a winner every time. This has become one of my favorite recipes!

Despite what one commenter said, these ARE the best granola bars in the world.  So easy, healthy, addicting and delicious.  Instead of using mixed nuts I add pecans and walnuts and I use unsweetened condensed milk.  I also add flax seed meal and add chopped dates.  I cook them a little longer (crispier) and sprinkle a little salt over them before I cut them into bite size pieces so I can snack on them while sitting at my desk.

Tried both original recipe and made lactose free with 1.5 cups of coconut milk and 4 tbsp of honey and both were delicious! I personally liked the lactose free ones even though they were a little less "substantial" (meaning a little less solid or heavy) more nutty flavor less sweet! I will make both again& share recipe!

Outstanding....quick, easy, cost effective (use whatever you have on hand.   Family loved them.  I used chocolate chips in place of the mixed nuts and walnuts in place of the pumpkin seeds.  Mom loves them for breakfast with a cup of coffee.

Excellent 'foundation' on this recipe.  Very easy to personalize with the add ins.  I added extra oats, dried blueberries, dried cherries, dates, flax, sunflower seeds, apricots, and honey.  Made about 3.5 pounds of bars.  I cooked mine a half hour, then reduced the heat to 325 and did another 14 minutes because I wanted the bars more crunch.  The sweetness of the bars seems to mostly be determined by the amount of fruit added.  It was excellent!!  Way to hit a homerun SeattleFarmersMarketGirl!!

We have made the granola bars twice from this recipe.  The first time I didn't have parchment paper and used aluminum foil in its place and it actually worked great.  The second time I used parchment paper and it stuck to it ruining some of the granola bars. Besides that minor problem it really is an easy recipe and almost no fail.  The kids really love helping make this (and eating it) and it is fun replacing the ingredients with whatever you like( dark chocolate chips, various dried fruit, various nuts, coconut, etc)

This was a fantastic way to get rid of the extras I had in my cupboard.  I subbed the evaporated milk for almond milk, added some protein powder and a banana to hold the bars together a bit more. Turned out great!

THE best granola bar recipe!! I doubled the recipe and used 8 c. quick oats, 12 oz. pkg. chocolate chips chopped in my processor, 6 TBLS peanut butter and 2 cans condensed milk. Baked for around 30 min. SOOO easy and delicious. My family eats a lot of granola bars and these are great tasting and save me $$$.

Used shredded coconut, craisins, chocolate chips, and pecans as the flavoring.  So good!  Could make a candy bar by using a lot of chocolate ...

This granola bars recipe is incredibly good and easy to make. I've stopped buying them at the store, because these are so much better and healthier for us.  My girls love to help make them with their favorite ingredients.  Dried strawberries and sunflower seeds are great replacements for cranberries and nuts.  We also like sprinkling cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Try these and you'll be hooked too!

Great snack! My husband rated this 4 stars, but I think more than 4, so rounded up and gave it a 5. I bought Craisons for this recipe, but all but 1/3 c. was left by the time I made this; substituting raisins works just fine. Used peanuts instead of mixed nuts, since I'm not fond of some of the nuts in mixed nuts. Used fat-free condensed milk and it tastes great.

Great recipe that can easily be made to your liking as long as you stick to the measurements.  Adding too much affects the binding and the bars don't stay together well.  I add 1.5tsp of cinnamon for personal taste.

The mother of all granola bars. You can add whatever you want to them. Make them sweet, salty, or both! Mine came out heavy so they are an awesome healthy filling snack. Highly suggested this recipe!

This recipe is awesome!!  I made them for the first time recently and fell in love.  I've already passed this on to several other people.  I'm making them again and using different dried fruits and nuts for some variety.  The recipe is quick and easy.  Love it!

Best granola bar recipe I've found so far.  I used cranberries, cherries, coconut, mixed nuts & vanilla chips.  Baked for 22 minutes and they came out soft & chewy.  Might go a little longer next time as we like crunch.  All in all, though, definate keeper :)  TYSM for recipe!  UPDATE:  After speaking with family, they confirmed what I had already suspected (insofar as no one was eating them).  Too sweet.  I love the consistency, but they're just too too sweet.  Will go back and see what others have done to adjust.
