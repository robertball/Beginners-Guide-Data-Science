My fiance and I made this together and we loved how it turned out. Gouda is not a traditional for cheese steak (American or provolone would be), but it's my favorite cheese in general, so I went with it. The cheese sauce turned out thick and gorgeous. My fiance isn't a fan of peppers, but we agreed that mushrooms would make sense as a substitute. Steak is, of course, always fabulous. Overall things came together really well and we look forward to making it again.

I wanted to like this so much.. but it is such a fail! My only reason for a three star.. was the meat! If you follow the meat portion of this recipe.. it's a great start for fajitas.

I thought this was pretty great. The only thing missing was seasoning. A good hit of salt and pepper, or steak seasoning, would go a long way. Next time I would also add some mushrooms.

I always try making recipes as they are written.  I made this with muenster instead of gouda cause that's what I had and since they are both mild cheeses, I thought it was a good substitute.  My only issue was that it needed salt and pepper. It's also good the next day which is always a bonus!
