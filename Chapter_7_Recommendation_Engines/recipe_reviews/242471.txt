I make this regularly now as I have to eat on an anti-inflammatory and gluten free diet.  I use coconut sugar instead of refined sugar and I add 1 whole mashed banana to the cake to make it even more moist!

The batter was rather bitter (probably because I used dark cocoa) so I added about 1/3 c more sugar.  The cake is incredibly moist and delicious.  I decided to top it with coconut pecan frosting.  OMG!  I struck the perfect combination!  It's a good thing I have a college boy on hand to sop up the extra calories. I'd be far too tempted to finish this off all by myself, if it hung around too long.

I made this yesterday for a dinner party where there were strict dietary restrictions.  The comments were very useful and so I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar, one teaspoon of espresso powder and a pinch of baking soda because I had organic cocoa (not Dutch process).  It's really delicious. I baked it 42 mins per the comments but it could probably be a little less like 35 or so.  It's not too sweet and is really chocolaty. Big recommend.  Only thing I don't know is how to make the powder sugar stay on top as it sinks into the cake.

This is a good, healthy, and tasty cake.  However, there are a few changes that would further enhance and compliment this treat.  As some of the reviews said, it needs some extra sugar.  The outside burns a little, but the inside is fairly good.  I would recommend adding a little extra sugar and oil ... maybe 1/3 cup of oil and make it 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4.  Other than these few things, it  is a great cake, especially for being gluten free, and I will probably make this again! :)

No fail. Just don't over bake. Best if slightly underbaked. I can always count on this as a "healthier" treat for office parties and they all love it

A great portion/size recipe (I did 8x8 square pan), but it definitely needs more moisture (maybe some more oil? and would be better slightly underbaked).
I made it with stevia (sugar substitute, bad decision; use Swerve instead).  I made a great keto-friendly coconut+pecan frosting, treating it like a German's chocolate cake.

I recent;y made the conversion to a gluten free, grain free and  reduced dairy diet for health reasons and I've been experimenting with quite a few recipes. This is one of the first one's I've tried that actually satisfied my sweet tooth and craving for "cake/bread" like taste and texture. I made these as mini cupcakes by halving the entire recipe and baking for 12 minutes. It yielded about 24 mini cupcakes that were dense and chocolaty! I'm making this recipe again as regular sized cupcakes and will dust a little powdered sugar over them. I'll also add either a splash of almond milk or 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce and see how that goes.  I'm hoping the those changes will produce a mildly less dry and sweeter result. I suggest making it exactly as written once and then adjusting to your specific tastes. Great base for an awesome recipe. I also think a berry preserve type topping would really set this off. :)

I used 1/3 cup of cocoa powder & as 1/4 cup sugar + 1/2 cup erythritol for sweetening. Baked perfectly and was very tasty. Based on some comments on the King Arthur website, if you use 1/2 cup of cocoa powder that the recipe calls for, you may want to increase the sugar content to offset the bitterness from the cocoa.

I bought coconut flour for a few months and didn't get really good recipe. I almost gave up then I saw this and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad because the result is awesome. My husband and my mom in-law all enjoy this cake. Dense, moist and really deep chocolate flavor. Will make again and send to my son. Thank you for this recipe

Turned out so good! The first recipe that I've made with coconut flour that didn't turn out oddly textured. A very spongy, moist cake. Will definitely be making this again, everyone loved it!

I made this in an 8x8 pan.  I followed the recipe  but used Splenda in lieu of sugar and unsweetened baking cocoa.  I thought it  was dry so it definitely needs more liquid to make it moist.  I will make it again but in a loaf pan

Followed recipes exactly up to putting in baking dish, I poured it into 4 ramkin bowls about 3 inches in diameter, put 5 chocolate morsel chips in the middles, baked and they came out perfectly

Quick, easy,  moist, not overly sweet  and delicious.   I could barely taste the coconut.   I cut it up and used it in a trifle and it was fantastic.   The low carb was a bonus.    This will be my go to chocolate cake.

I couldn't find the coconut flour so I subbed a GF mix.  This cake came out really good.   I baked it in an 8in square pan.  Topped with fluffy p-nut butter icing from here.   It was  a hit.

based on comments, up the sugar to 1 C. don't overbake.
