Yummie.  When I tasted this before pouring it into the shells it tasted too sweet to me.  I found another nearly identical recipe for this pie that called for 3 T of lemon juice.  That addition made it PERFECT.  Also, don't just drain - strain your pineapple a bit.  Those that complained about this not setting up likely got pineapple juice into the pie.

This is very good and I would definitely make it again.  Although, it simply has to be made with a HOMEMADE graham cracker crust.  Store bought just does not even compare!

Thank you so much for the recipe! I followed it exactly and the pies came out great. Be sure to FOLD in the whipped topping - if you put it in a mixer, it will turn to goo (as I have found in the past). That's probably why others have had trouble with it being runny. I will make these again & again!

Great recipe..I combined the two Millionaire pie recipes to get something closer to what the local bakery sells under this name. Meaning I added 1/4C lemon juice blended in in step one and 1/2C chopped maraschino cherries added with pineapple.  It was good, but next time I will leave out the cool whip--it iz only to make it creamier and it seemed to really tone down the flavor which was awesome before I added that.  And, I admit, I've never been much of a cool whip person anyway!  Will save calories, as if that matters at that point LOL, by cutting it altogether--will make for a firmer end product too.

A delicious recipe that has been served several times since we found it. This would be a wonderful way to get the children involved in the kitchen without worry of the stove. Let them decorate the top of it according to the season. It's great all year round but especially easy on the cook in the summer!

I made this one Christmas Eve and my family now asks for it every time.  It is a light dessert - perfect for balancing out all those heavy holiday dishes.  My only suggestions are to make sure you don't over-mix the whip cream and, if you are making this for a party, try using individual-sized graham cracker crusts (sold in pckgs of 6 at WalMart).  Doing so keeps the presentation looking so much better.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving, it was the first to go because everyone loved it!  Even my judgmental mother-in-law and her sister asked me for the recipe.  My brother in law asked me to make it for his birthday, which is 2 whole months away.

Very easy and pretty tasty. Could use a little something zippy in the mix, but I'm not sure what. A lady at work makes hers with crushed mandarin oranges but I didn't want to stray from the original recipe yet. 

I do like that I get 2 pies from the recipe. I threw one in the freezer and took it to a New Year's lunch two weeks after I made them and it tasted great!

This is a really good pie. I used pie crust rather than graham cracker crust and it was a hit.

I needed a quickie recipe for dessert and had all the ingredients for these pies.   I did follow the recipe though. Except I also added about 1/4 cup of shredded coconut and followed a reviewer's suggestion of adding 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I also would make sure to drain/strain the pineapple, then drying it completely on a kitchen towel or paper towel before putting in the cream cheese mixture. It makes a huge difference! It didn't set fast enough for me, so I put the pies in the freezer for a couple of hours. I do suggest, however, to take it out and put in fridge before serving. It was a good pie. I liked the pie, but I will keep looking for another recipe like this.

Sharing this receipe is as neat as sharing the pie! This is simple and delicious. I did have one batch that was running. Can't figure out why.  I've been making this version of Millionaire Pie since 1998. I add one small can of mandarin oranges use walnuts instead of pecans.

This recipe is ok but it's missing the lemon juice. Add 1/4 cup lemon juice. Gives it a little tang and cuts down the sweetness. My mom has made these for years.

Instead of a 20 ounce can of pineapple, I add an 8 ounce can of crushed pineapple, small can of mandarin oranges, and small can of sliced peaches, chopped. Drain all before adding.

Last year as an after-christmas treat, I made this pie for my mom and me. It is delicious. I didn't use graham crust because of personal preference, but baked a ready-made pie shell. Then my mom suggested making another one and use the strawberry topping I made for cheesecake that we all forgot was there, in place of the pineapple. That was delicious as well! So do not be afraid to change the fruit in the pie for something a little different.

This recipe will replace my old millionaire pie recipe which does not contain cream cheese.  I like the addition and it gives the pie more body and a much creamier texture.  My old recipe calls for 3T of lime juice which I like to add to this one also to cut the sweetness just a little.  One of our favorite summer desserts!

I tried this hoping to duplicate the wonderful Millionaire pie at Furr's (Luby's in some states) cafeteria. This is nothing like it. It was a little watery and just an OK pie. Will keep looking for another recipe.

For me, it was too sweet and it didn't set up properly.  I do not think I will make this again.
