This was very good for a 'light' soup and a quick, shortcut one at that. I would recommend not adding the full amount of salt though. Canned tomatoes are already high in sodium. This only needed a generous 1/4 tsp. I used honey in place of the sugar and added a tsp of Italian seasoning along with only a pinch of cloves. Be sure to temper the milk before adding all to the pot, and don't overheat the soup, to keep it from curdling. Really quite smooth and rich considering the lack of cream. It was the perfect pair for veggie & cheese quesadillas. Made a light, but filling, meal. Thanks so much for the recipe. I'll be making this again, especially as it calls for ingredients that are always on hand.

Great soup!  Perhaps I shouldn't rate this because of the changes I made, but we loved what we had!  I used a bit of extra onion, changed the sugar to honey, used Spike instead of salt, chipotle chile powder instead of pepper, and soy milk instead of evaporated milk.  I left it a little chunky instead of blending it smooth.  This is a quick, delicious lunch!

I liked this easy-to-make soup.  I used FF half and half because it's what I had, but I just couldn't bring myself to add the cloves.  It just seemed too weird. 2 tsp. salt is way too much. Start with 1 tsp. and go from there. This easy-to-make soup definitely has potential with a good bit of tweaking.

This is soooo good!  I even make it in the microwave at work, after browning the onions at home.  The cloves are what MAKES it!!  Delicious!

It can be dangerous to put hot liquid in a blender.  I blend mine first and then put it on the stove to heat.

I thought this tasted okay. I was looking for a low fat recipe for cream of tomato soup that didn't have cream or half and half in it. The soup is low fat, but seems quite high in sodium between the canned diced tomatoes and added 2 tsp. of salt. I followed the recipe exactly except left out the black pepper, because I don't care for it, and subbed nutmeg for the cloves. I didn't have ff evaporated milk but had 2% evaporated milk, which worked fine. Make sure that onion is softened beyond the 10 minutes. I assumed mine was, but still had some uncooked onion bits. I did use a hand emulsion blender to make it easy. This went fine with grilled cheese for dinner tonight.

This was so tasty. My whole family enjoyed it including my 2 year old who normally doesn't like soup. I substituted low fat cream for the evaporated cream since i made it while traveling in Switzerland and i couldnt find it. I'll have to make double next time!

I had high hopes for this one.  I used 1 can no salt diced tomatoes and 1 can Rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  I did not add any salt called for.  All we could taste was the ground cloves, yuck.  I will try this one again with it.

Delicious - I like the spice of the pepper.  But I agree with some of the other reviews.  Skip the cloves, a little too strong.

Worked out great!  Omitted the cloves (not a fan in soup) and used 20 fl oz milk and 4 tbs sour cream as I didn't have any evaporated milk.

I thought this was really good.  I added fresh basil before putting it in the blender.

This soup was fantastic!  However, next time I make it I will not add as much pepper because it was very spicy.  Still a hit though and I would definitely make it again!

I did make some changes to the recipe based on other reviews.  I switched 1 can out for no salt diced tomatoes, and added about half the recommended salt.  Also, I used just a dash of the ground cloves instead of the 1/8 tsp.  I blended it in the pot with a hand blender because I do like my tomato soups a little chunky, plus it was easy clean up.  I only had a can of 2% evaporated milk.  Overall, for how quick and simple it was, it turned out pretty good, but I'm not sure if it would have tasted better with the ff evaporated milk?..  I will have to try it that way next time, or maybe with regular ff milk.
