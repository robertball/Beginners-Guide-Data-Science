I worked at Cracker Barrel all the way through college, and during my time there made massive amounts of hashbrown casserole.  I will only say that this recipe is VERY close to the recipe we used at work.  Some tips I learned from making it every day for six years:  -- Mix all the ingredients (with the potatoes straight from the freezer) the day before, cover and refrigerate.  Then bake it in a well greased pan right before serving.  Makes dinner prep a whole lot easier, and the mixture will be more likely to stick together than to the pan.  -- Don't "smush" it into the pan -- it'll turn out greasier and also stick to the pan.  Instead, use a big spoon or spatula to fling dollops of the mixture into the pan.  -- Colby cheese gives an extra Something over cheddar cheese.  Highly recommend subbing.

I made this today and with some changes and it was excellent. I thawed the hash browns in a bowl in the microwave for about three minutes ( as mine were frozen when I wanted this and they seem to cook better as well), I used one whole stick of margerine melted, one whole container of sour cream( 16oz), omitted the onion ( overpowering) and the salt (soup and cheese both have enough). I mixed the soup, sour cream, shredded cheese, potatoes, margerine, pepper and a little bit of milk together until mixed. The milk makes it more creamy and less dry. I baked at 400 degrees in a very well greased pan ( grease grease grease the pan as this will stick bad--trust me on this) covered with foil for 30 minutes. I then melted a couple of tablespoons of margerine and mixed in a couple of handfuls of crushed corn flakes ( don't really need the  extra margerine but I like it so I use it :)) remove foil from pan and sprinkle on top. Bake 10 more minutes or until cornflakes are well browned. This was delicious with the changes I made and next time I think I will use a can of cheddar cheese soup ( or southwestern cheddar soup) instead of the cream of chicken the recipe calls for. Granted these aren't the healthiest changes but I would rather eat a small amount of good rich food than a lot of  so-so tasting stuff!

I have been making this for yrs. and reviewed it in the past. I have lightened it up for lifestyle changes that we have made in our family. I now use fat free cream of chicken soup and omit the butter, replacing it with fat free sour cream. I don't add any salt, use extra freshly ground pepper and about 1/2 the cheese, mixing some in the casserole and sprinkling the rest on the top! It is still delicious! MY 14 yr old daughter wouldn't touch it in the past,now she loves it.Do use a good sweet onion if possible!

Excellent recipe !! very good flavor - I did change 2 things - I used 2 cans of cream of chicken & mushroom soup because that is what I had on hand and I also added extra shredded cheese. This was even better the second time. I reheated what was left over in the oven at 350 uncovered. The top was nicely browned  and slightly crunchy, potatoes moist, and the flavor was oh so awesome. Love this recipe - Thank you for sharing !!!

This is very good! I like it better than Cracker Barrel's version because their's is usually too greasy from sitting all day in a greasy pan. The only thing I did differently was cut the onion down to only 2T (I'm pregnant and am having a slight aversion to onions!). I also added one can of Campell's condensed cheddar cheese soup in addition to the cream of chicken soup because I love cheesy potatoes. My husband ate about 3/4 of the pan in one sitting! This is easy to prepare and very filling. Nice recipe that I recommend!

This is an excellent recipe, a perfect sidedish for baked chicken! The changes I made are : I added 8 oz of sour cream and took the butter down to 2 tbsps because of the grease. Everyone should try this!

As is, this recipe is very greasy and too salty. I cut the butter in half and left out the salt. Added a little sour cream and green onions over the top, then sprinkled with crushed cornflakes to add texture. Very good! My guests at brunch loved it!

All right ladies...
I been making this for Crackle Barrel  for the past 12 years.
First thing...
This has to sit in the walk in for 18 to 24 hours... We always prepare this for the next day..

This recipe is real close.
The people saying it's to greasy from the butter.. It's not the butter rookies... We use Colby shredded cheese ... When you add cheddar cheese and you cook it in the oven it melts mixing with the butter causing the oil from the cheddar and the butter to combine making it seem like the butter is making it greasy.....

So here the trick .... Mix your potatoes and the melted butter with... you ready.... Its not cream of chicken sweetheart.. We use cream of celery but with a twist.. Trade secret...
Mix all together put in oven at 475 for 12 minutes. take out and put back in container with lid and put in refrigerator for 18 hours... What happens is the potatoes starts absorbing the butter and the cream of _____  from 12 minutes at 475.... causing fast absorption and fast cool down in the refrigerator giving 18 hours of basically potatoes being marinade...
Put back in oven at 450 for 30 minutes uncovered. Then after 
30 minutes take out and cover the top with a layer of colby cheese 500 for 10 minutes. Take out let cool until we start serving  Believe it or not that casserole when u order it is put in microwave for 40 sec before we server it..... That is exactly how we make it..... You want to have fun with the cooks next time you go to the barrel  say this,, " I'll

This is very similar to an old family favorite, except that we add a crunchy topping.  Before baking, crush 4 cups of corn flakes (cereal) and mix it with 3/4 stick of melted butter.  Spread this topping on the casserole mixture that you have already put in the pan and bake!  So easy and it will be extra yummy!  (I bake it for 45 mins. at 350.)

Yummy comfort food! I omit the butter altogether, add one pint of sour cream and sprinkle crushed potato chips on top before baking.

Everyone LOVES this recipe and ALWAYS asks for it so they can make it too! 

I did make some changes:  I reduced the butter to 2-3 tablespoons (almost melted), 1/2 cup chopped onion, changed soup to 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cheddar cheese, changed to 2 cups shredded colby cheese (cheddar is too greasy when it cooks)
One additional change made is to bake for 40-45 mins then cool (and chill overnight, if possible) then top with cheese and bake again @ 350 -375 for an additional 45 minutes or until bubbly.  The extra baking makes this dish better than the restaurant's version!

This recipe is great.  I'm a potato fanatic.  I changed the recipe a bit.  I thought the potatoes were a little undercooked at only 35 minutes so I cooked them for 40-45 minutes and to give a little bit of a golden color and a bit more crunch I turned the temp up to 500 for the last 3-5 minutes to give a crunchy top layer.  My husband loved it.  Thanks!

The husband, and I really enjoyed this recipe. I changed the recipe a bit to suit us. I used shredded hashbrowns, and thawed them in microwave for quicker preparation. I used Fat Free butter instead of real butter. That little change made the recipe not greasy at all, like other reviews I read. I also sprayed some Fat Free butter on top of dish before cooking. I added some Canadian bacon, and a couple slices of crumbled bacon I cooked on the George Foreman grill just too add a breakfast touch to the recipe. I end up baking it 50 minutes at 350 degree. If don't want all the fat, and grease. Try the Kraft Fat Free butter, it will make a difference. I will be making this recipe again. Best Hashbrown recipe of the 3 different one's I've made.

I made this for church today and it was a huge hit!  I doubled the recipe and used the hashbrowns from the dairy case rather than the frozen kind.  I sauteed the onions before adding them to the casserole, and I used the cream of chicken soup with herbs.  I'll definitely be making it again!

So I have made this a few times and to be honest, I think that the recipe on the side of the hashbrowns I buy is better.  I won't be making it again, its not bad at all but its just not the best.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as written, except that I cooked it for 45 minutes, used a little less than 2 pounds of hashbrowns, and cut the onions down a little because I'm not a huge fan of them. I'd suggest doing the same unless you really love onions because their taste is definitely prevalent in this dish. I was tempted to cut the butter down and exchange the cream of chicken for cream of celery, but I'm glad I didn't. I thought cream of chicken sounded a bit odd, but if I didn't know the cream of chicken was used, I never would have been able to tell it was in this casserole. I also personally didn't think the butter was too much. I noticed several reviewers commented that it was too salty, but I didn't think so. I added the salt into the casserole, and my boyfriend and I still added more salt to our pieces during dinner. We are salt lovers, though :) This dish is definitely on the greasy side, which seemed to mostly come from the cheese and not the butter. It was still tasty, though, and there are ways (like blotting with a paper towel) to get rid of most of the grease. I'm wondering if the casserole was allowed to sit for 10 minutes or so after being taken out of the oven, if it might be less greasy looking. I had some of this heated up in the microwave the next day, and it tasted even better. For some reason, the heated up leftover was much less greasy looking than when it was fresh out of the oven.

I LOVE Cracker Barrel's hashbrown casserole.  I don't usually buy prepackaged hash brown potatoes but had the chance to pick up a 1 pound package of fresh O'Brien style hash browns yesterday and really wasn't sure what I'd do with them.  Then this recipe appeared and voila!  I halved the recipe including the half can of cream of chicken soup.  It is wonderful.  It's not exactly health food but awfully delicious!  Thanks.

This was okay but I expected better from a 5 star rating. Maybe I just expected it to taste more like what I'm used to getting at a restaurant when I order hashbrown casserole. 
I will probably try this again, altering the ingredients to try and come somewhat closer.

I make this recipe, with a few variations.  I use southern style hashbrowns, cream of mushroom or cream of celery, add 2/3 C water to dilute, omit the butter, add 8 oz sour cream instead, and use 8 oz. Velveeta cheese, rather than Cheddar.  This is simple to mix together the night before & then bake the next day.  A great side for a family get-together, or my favorite to take to church funeral luncheons or meals for the hungry.  It always goes fast - never any leftovers!

OK - I must start by saying that we love Cracker Barrels hash brown potatoes so I just had to try this. I did make some substitutions but that was based on ingredients I had on hand. I shredded potatoes instead of the frozen hash browns and used a can of cream of mushroom soup. My husband had the leftovers for breakfast! I will try this again..following the exact recipe this time as I'm sure it will be a hit. Thanks Holly!!

Love this stuff.  This version is undoubtedly tasty.  But I have to say that I prefer the recipe the times I've made it with a slight modification.  I substitute half the amount of butter with sour cream.  TRY IT!  Also, this may seem like a minor thing but if you're not a good onion dicer, I'd suggest giving them a very quick sauté before adding them.  Especially if you have an eater who nitpicks about onions in recipes.  FINELY diced raw onions are a must with this version b/c the cooking time is just basically heating things up, not really cooking the onions.

I love Cracker Barrel hashbrown casserole and this is better. I did make some changes, such as omitting the onion and adding about 1/2 cup of plain, Greek yogurt (for the tang of sour cream without the fat)and used Colby-Jack cheese instead of cheddar. 
I mixed it all the night before, with the potatoes frozen, straight from the bag. Sprayed a 13x9 stoneware dish and spooned it in. Pressed it down, very lightly, covered with foil and refrigerated overnight. The next morning I took it out and set it at room temp for about 2 hours. Then baked uncovered, as directed, adding about 10 min to the bake time. It was sooo good and SO gone, quickly!

I have tried on so many levels to like this but I just can't.  I first made it for my parents with an eggs benedict breakfast.  Tho the potatos were thawed the were still crunchy and the onion was still crunchy.  Anticipating this, I cooked at 375 for 45 min.  Thinking I did something wrong, I tried it again at a later date, but first nuking the hashbrowns.  Still, crunchy and not in a good way.  I highly suggest sauteing the onions and upping the temp and time for this recipe, or find another one.  I'm having it as leftovers as I type and it's been nuked AGAIN, and it's all still crunchy.  This dish should be creamy, smooth, and comforting.  As written, isn't.

In my first attempt of this recipe my guilt over the richness of this meal over powered any enjoyment I got out of this absolutely delicious meal;)  In subsequent attempts, I used lowfat( not fat free, gross!) just about everything and I'm pleased to announce that no flavor loss was discernable to my palette. My family loved this recipe too, and dh couldn't tell the fat reduction the second time around either. Def. a keeper!

I modified the recipe slightly. I added sour cream and I used Colby/Jack cheese. I also seen an employee from cracker barrel suggest mixing all the ingredients the night before(the hash browns still frozen) and let it sit in the fridge over night then bake in the morning. I baked it covered for 45 min and then uncovered it topped it with more cheese and baked it until the cheese melted completely. It turned out great!

This is NOT Cracker Barrels Hashbrown Casserole IT'S BETTER!!!! My husband loves Cracker Barrels Hashbrown Casserole, and in his words "This is A LOT Better than Cracker Barrel's HB Casserole" As for myself I have never liked CB's Hashbrown Casserole, BUT I really liked this and will make it again especially around the holidays. As mentioned by one reviewer, next time I will not use as much onion, but other than that a SIMPLY GREAT RECIPE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.

Great basic recipe for one of my favorite comfort-food sides!  I will use this again!
Here's what I did different:
*Did not add additional salt - the condensed soup has plenty.
*Cut the butter by about 1/5, or 3 Tbsp - possibly could've cut it more, but was concerned it wouldn't be buttery or creamy enough.
*Added about 1 tsp of garlic powder - last minute decision, and I'm not sure how much difference it made, so it was probably just right - Not garlicy. 
*Thawed, individually, 2 bags of Ore-Ida cubed hashbrown potatoes in the microwave - they weren't completely thawed when I started (note to self: Plan ahead next time!)
*Put the butter near the warm oven to soften - didn't soften properly like it would if I planned this several hours in advance ;), and it was more difficult to mix in w/ the other ingredients.
*I doubled the cooking time, let it cool a bit, refrigerated, and then reheated for another 45 minutes the following day before taking it over to my Mom's. I had some nice crispy cheese around the edges - who doesn't love that??
*I doubled this recipe for 8 guests, and had well over half leftover.  Maybe it says more about my cooking, but I think the number of servings for a single recipe could be changed to 6-8.

WOW!  I made this recipe for an Easter brunch for my extended family and friends, and I was even asked to give the recipe to a friend!  Turned out great.  Very easy to combine ingredients in bowl.  Make sure you watch out for the soup and potatoes, though; they liked to fall out of the bowl in chunks, thus splashing the soup that was already in it.  Also, I sprinkled more cheese onto the top of the casserole just after I took it out of the oven.  Very cheesy and good!

Great recipe! We tripled this and made it for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit!
I used 2 cans cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, the cornflakes on the top were an absolute MUST. Everyone raved about how delish it was! I also threw in a little sour cream I had left in a container, maybe 1/2 c. I feel that I should mention that the butter content in this recipe is ridiculous and unnecessary. A little butter is fine, but HALF A CUP of butter is kind of overkill. Other than that, this recipe is delicous! I just decided to make it again this morning!

This is so good. I omit the butter completely and just use two cups of sour cream. I also you cheddar-jack cheese instead of just cheddar. I slice the onion really thin so it just blends right in with the hashbrowns. Delish!!

I loved this! At first I thought it wasn't going to be too good because of the cream of chicken, but you really can't even taste it. I'm a huge fan of hash brown casserole and this was great.

The butter made it a little greasy for me.  I think I'll leave it out next time and use sour cream.  Overall, a great side dish (we served with a roast chicken on a rain day).

My husband and I loved this recipe! We are not big onion fans, so I cut that out and added a tablespoon of granulated onion and a couple of tables spoons of fresh garlic. The cheese and soup are salty enough, so I did not add any salt. I also used light margerine and reduced fat cream of chicken to make this heavy dish a little lighter on calories! I also used half of the hashbrowns since others said the recipe was "dry" and using 1 pound was perfect. The only thing that confuses me is that it says it yields 4-6 servings...we found that it was around 16 servings (if you don't gorge yourself) and that is way to much for me and my husband. I will be cutting it down to half pound of potatoes next time, along with cutting everything else in half!

This is a really good recipe, but I wish I would have listened to the reviews when people were cutting back on butter, it does make it pretty greasy, but this is a definite keeper, but next time, will only use half the butter called for (if that much!).  Thanks for sharing, we will be enjoyin this again soon!

This was very tasty! Like other people I also changed a few things, I added 2 cans of soup and some chopped roasted red pepper. Next time I would omit the butter (I found it unnecessary.)If you don't like crunchy onions, I suggest sauteing them first.

Love this casserole to serve for brunch!  I do find it a little greasy so I'll cut back on the butter next time.  We prefer a crunchy topping and decided to crush corn flakes in a Ziploc bag (approx. 2 cups) and added 1/2 cup of melted butter.  Spread that on top before baking. YUMMY!!!!

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is requested at our neighborhood 4th of July party, and also for my family gathering for Christmas at my mother-in-law's house every year (and just about every BBQ I am invited to).
  The only thing that I do differently is, I leave the hashbrowns frozen while mixing all the ingredients together.  I think it makes it easier to get everything mixed without breaking the hashbrowns up (that way they dont get mushy).  Either way, this is a wonderful recipe, just be prepared to make it a lot because everyone will ask you to make it! :)

I think it needs the salt/butter that it calls for (tried without and it was too bland).. also I wouldnt add the sour cream like a few others suggested on the next go around. No raw onions.. they dont cook well in the casserole. I also had a hard time getting the top to crust. FYI, do not add fresh garlic..

This was a good recipe, but it yields alot of casserole. Be prepared to feed an army. I cut it down and it was still alot.

Wow............is this good. I used the ore-ida hash browns with onions and peppers, red and green, already mixed in. I also baked it for 45 min as suggested by others.

Good base recipe. To "enhance" though, use thawed shredded hashbrowns, 1 can cream of chicken, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 Tbsp chopped onion, 2 1/3 cups cheddar cheese, follow baking instructions but at the last 5 minutes cover top with more cheese and place back in oven til melted.

LOVE THIS RECIPE.  Easy, quick and a family favorite.  I never have left overs!  One of my family members said it reminded them of the Cracker Barrel hashbrowns.

Just like our favorite southern family restaurant (rhymes with slacker darrel). It's great since we don't live particularly close to one. Thanks!

I have a copy cat recipe for Cracker Barrel's hashbrown casserole and the only difference is to use colby cheese instead of cheddar. I used a little more cheese than called for and stirred in some milk to keep it from drying out about half way through baking time. Very good and does taste just like theirs.

Very good! Everyone loved this dish. I'm not much on changing recipes, but I did not have the cream of chicken soup on hand so I used cream of onion. Believe me ~ it was quite good. Thank you so much for sharing. This is a keeper!

I loved this.  Only used 1 1/2 pkgs. of the potatoes.  As others have said, 2 lbs. = too much.  Didn't use the butter, and it was not missed.  The flavor was wonderful, and not dry at all.

I've tried several hashbrown casserole recipes, and this is the best. I like to add a little milk or sour cream just to keep it from being too dry, but it is an awesome recipe just the way it's posted here.

Completely yummy!  Be careful not to add too many onions or process them to much!  My husband was in charge of chopping and the onions overpowered the dish.  Also, I used diced potatoes and they turned out great!  Will totally make again and SOON!

This dish was ok...  I think the cream of chicken soup gave it a weird flavor.  I might try this again, but by using a different type of soup.  Also, 1/2 cup of butter was way too much.

Wow is this ever good! I find that it should be eaten right away, as it isn't as good after it is reheated. Perfect for overnight guests. I serve it with the "Brunch Enchiladas". Afterwards, everyone is so full they head back to bed for a nap.

Absolutely love this recipe!!  Have made it at least 50 times, family and friends love it.  I do sautee the onions in the recommended butter first, I like my onions a little carmelized and soft...I also cook for more around 50-60 minutes...but everything else stays the same, delicious!!!!

I have made this recipe a staple when it comes to our work get-togethers.  Everyone just loves it - including me. Like lots of others, I cut the butter by 1/2, but the rest stays the same. Fantastic!!  I always get requests for this and it disappears in no time. Thank You!

Something similar to what my family's fave is; and we use almost thawed hash browns - broken up, and chicken mushroom soup . But this recipe here is a wee bit salty and greasy, so no butter but 1 cup sour cream. No salt, as we use up to 3 cups cheese. 1/4 cup onions. And never forget the crushed cornflakes topping mixed with a bit of melted butter, (like maggie macguire's and mrs mc's), adds a lovely crunch to it, mmmmm. Has possibilities. NOT for the diet conscious.

had i made this recipe exactly as directed, it would've been a disaster!   i expected much more from it (as i L-O-V-E  Cracker Barrel's version!).     2lbs of hashbrowns are WAY too much for one can of soup!   i added two cans of soup and then still only used 1  1/2 lbs of the hashbrowns.   also, i halved the butter and that was just right.  you DEFINITLY do not need all that butter!
hopefully you'll have better luck with this one than i did!

Very versatile and standard recipe. Maybe a little too salty I usually leave it out.  This dish never fails my husband and kids always eat it up!  As a variation I sometimes add a cup of sour cream and top it with the french fried onions and serve with chicken or pork chops. Yummy!

I loved this....made a few minor changes though.  I used both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups.  I also didn't use all the cheese that it called for.  I didn't really measure it, but only used what looked good.  This the closest recipe I have ever seen to mimicking Cracker Barrell's hashbrown casserole....highly recommended.  I love theirs!!  And mine was close!!

Very good - but I added a little bit more cheese and used Cream of Mushroom as I had that on hand.  Leftovers are not all that great, as the oils seperate.  So, I suggest make only what you know you'll need.  Even better with salsa served on top.

FINALLY! This is the perfect recipe. I've been searching for this for years. Always tried the ones with sour cream- I think the trick to the true taste is NO sour cream. It's perfect! My husband is very happy to eat this any day!

This tastes even better than Cracker Barrel! Try baking it a little longer than called for. Maybe 5 minutes extra. Colby cheese does give it a little something.

Not quite Cracker Barrel quality, but tasty. I used 3 Tbsp. of butter and 8 oz. of sour cream.

I have never liked Hashbrown Casserole, not even Cracker Barrels, I won't eat it. My husband on the other hand loves it. So I wanted to try my hand at making one of his favorite side dishes, and I came across this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe directed. My husband LOVED it. I tried it, and well... I loved it too, now this HB Casserole I will eat. No changes needed for this keeper!

This came out a little dry & bland.  I think it needs some sour cream to make it a little richer.

Quite bland.  Didn't even taste the soup that was added to it.  Quite dry.  To make this recipe work - more liquid (soup/milk) and seasonings should be added.

As is, I give this four stars. After reading reviews and using 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth, and cutting the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, my family gives this five stars. I had to bake it for close to an hour though, covering the baking dish with foil the last 15 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

I cut the recipe in half which was plenty for our family of 5.  With the 1 pound of hashbrowns, I ended up using 3/4 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Followed directions, it was great.

One word.... DELICIOUS!  The only thing I did differently was that I made mine in my crock pot. It only took 3 hours or so.  This is also the easiest thing to make next to mac n' cheese...

Next time, I will cook the onions a little before adding them to the casserole.  I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup (it's what I had) and I really liked the flavor that added.

I halved the recipe and defrosted the hashbrowns in the microwave. This was delicious except the onions were still a bit crunchy and didn't taste cooked. I think they should be sauteed first so they don't taste as raw.

Excellent recipe.  I follow the recipe as written except that I do add a 16oz carton of sour cream and a splash of milk to the mixture before cooking.  It is so cheesy, creamy, and yummy!

Anything with potatoes, onions and cream soups I love!  I thought it was a little thick so next time I will add some milk just to make it a little more moist.

I just made this and in fact, it's now back in the oven with hopefully changes that will save it for our brunch today.   A 1/2 cup of butter is the culprit of this disaster. It left a grease pool swimming on top of the potatoes. I just used 10 paper towels to soak it off the top. I could literally move the potatoes out of one corner at a time and see the pool of grease to soak up. Next time, I will completely omit the butter. It isn't needed with 2 cups of cheddar cheese.   Right now, my tentative fix? A whole package of broccoli florets to soak up the remaining butter and soften them in the oven. I hope it works.

Awesome!  I halved the butter and added light sour cream for the other half just to lighten it up a bit.  My family raved over it. It tasted very similar to Cracker Barrel.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I just decided that I wanted to make this to go with my leftover chicken tenders, so I came home and looked it up. I, like many other reviewers omit the salt since the cream of chicken soup has enough of its own salt and add the cornflake topping. I also replace the onion with a bit of onion powder because I hate onions

WOOT WOOT!!!  I add bacon to this recipe and have never had anybody tell me that this is nothing short of amazing!!!...I also use about 8 cups of cheese, the more cheese the better!!...I cook the bacon in the microwave until very crispy and add to the ingreditents, Have to make sure the bacon is extra crispy because it will soften while baking, and the consistency is weird if the bacon is too soft... ALSO HOT SAUCE FANATICS --TEXAS PETE TASTES AMAZING ON THIS CASSEROLE!!!

This recipe is definitely delicious with a few alterations.. Don't forget to thaw the potatoes.. I couldn't find the shredded hashbrown kind, so I went with the chunks of hashbrown potatoes. They worked great!  Like many others who reviewed this, I cut half the butter and added sour cream. Couldn't tell you how much, I just sort of threw some in and mixed it. One can of soup is fine. But I also added some milk to make it creamier.  I put half the mixture into the freezer for another day. I could have stopped there and I know it would have been great, but my husband tends to prefer casseroles like this with a meat of some kind, instead of just as a side dish. So I diced up a large chicken breast (if cooking the whole mixture, you'd need two pieces obviously) and cooked it in a skillet with about 1/4 c. onions. Drained out the juices and threw it in with the mix. I added some extra cheese over the top. Baked for about 30 min. and then added some french fried onions for the last few minutes. It came out perfect!

I'm going to give this 4 stars as because it has TOO MUCH BUTTER. We wound up with a pool of butter at the bottom. Next time I might just cut the soup with a little sour cream &  leave the butter out all together. Either way it was super tasty!

These were great.  The only things I changed were to leave out of the onions (because we don't like onions) plus I added some taco/Mexican flavored cheese on top.  Doesn't hurt to put it under the broiler for a minute or two and get the top cheese nice and crispy :)

I never buy frozen hash brown potatoes. SO i shredded up my own, rinsed them, added some water and salt to the potatoes and cooked in the microwave for 2 minutes. Then I squeezed the potatoes dry and followed the recipe as is, but I did add a spoonful of sour cream.  I know the potato thing sounds difficult, but its better than running out to the store buying something when you already have a 5 pound bag of potatoes at home. Just my opinion.

Love this recipe!  I am not a fan of onions so I omitted them all together.  I did add about 3/4 of a container of sour cream, some garlic powder and Italian Seasoning.  Oh - and SHARP Cheddar cheese.  Save some cheese for the top - you will love it... We will make this all the time!!

Made this SO EASY recipe for Christmas brunch and all the women wanted the recipe! You've got to make this - you won't regret it, except when it's gone and you want just one more forkful!

This was awesome, but I am leaving a star off because I think you do need to follow some reviewer's advice! I did cut down on the butter and replaced with sour cream- just eyeballed it. I made this with cream of chicken soup one time and cream of mushroom another- both great! I also cooked a bunch of sweet onion down in butter and olive oil. My family loved it- this one is my staple!

I added 1/2 cup sour cream and had to bake it longer than 35 minutes as I used southern style hash browns not the shredded.  My guests loved this dish.

I took this casserole to a pot luck Thanksgiving dinner at work and there was nothing left when it was over.  I used 2 cans of soup instead of 1 but other than that I didn't change a thing.  Thanks MARBALET..this is a keeper.

LOVE IT!!!!!! I have made this many times over the past year, since finding this recipe. There is never any left when I take it to a potluck:) I do a couple things different. I make mine the day before & then cook it the day I need it. I think it gives all the ingredients time to mesh together. I use unsalted butter whenever I cook. Not a big fan of cream of chicken soup unless it is in a chicken dish. So, I use 1 & 1/2 cans of mushroom soup. I like mine creamier. This is defiantly comfort food at it's finest:0)

This is a DEFINITE keeper.  I made this for a brunch I hosted and it was ate up FAST!!  I made 2 casseroles.  1 I added extra cheese and the other I made regular.  I suggest NOT adding the extra cheese.  It took away from the casserole.  I also took the suggestion of using French fried onions.  Can you say....YUM-MEE?????!!!!!

Very Good!  I followed the recipe except I changed the hashbrowns to Potatos Obrian.  This was VERY GREASY!!  I will make again, however I will definitely leave out the butter and maybe change the cheese from cheddar to Colby or Colby Jack, since cheddar is so greasy naturally.  I had to pour off half the cheese, because so much grease was sitting on top.  I will make again though, everyone thought these were great...including myself!

awesome!! i make this all the time! It is a must have for holidays and at my friends whenever we all get together!!! i do not add onion at all ( if i do i make sure they are cooked all the way down with butter). I also add more cheese on top for extra goodness. Sometimes i use cream of mushroom too if im out of cream of chicken.. Just as good!!

5 stars with adding a cup sour cream and only 1/4 cup butter.  I used sharp cheddar cheese.  Left overs are good too.

I added a can of whole kernel corn and used homemade chicken stock in place of the butter, as I'm low on butter until payday. I also added a little Frank's. I'm planning on pairing this with five-spice chicken. This is a great, cheap recipe to make with most ingredients you have on hand.

Delicious! I cut the butter in half and broiled it for a few minutes to make it a little crispy on top. It was a big hit...I'll definitely make this one again!

I did not feel there was enough flavor and it was too greasy.  Next time, I will only use 1/3 of the butter and will use fresh potatoes or simply potatoes instead.  We did fry up the left over the next day and had hashbrown pancakes - they get nice and crispy and we sprinkled garlic salt on them - tasted much better.

I used a mixture of Monterey Jack, Cheddar and Asadero Cheese instead of just the Cheddar for a slight "South of the Border" kick.  I also used Tony's Seasoned Salt instead of the typical table salt.

I crumbled up tater tots since I didn't have any hashbrowns in the freezer.

This recipe called for WAY too much butter.  Next time, I will cut down by half.

This was a great side dish and the only reason I am giving it a 4 is because it was a little too greasey.  I will make this again, I think that I may just omit the butter and use reduced fat cream of chicken or cream of mushroom and maybe some fat-free sour cream to make it creamier.  I originally made it with cream of mushroom and it was really good and I didn't add any salt at all because there is enough salt in the soup and cheese.

This is a great recipe! I made some changes based on other reviews. Use 1/4 cup chopped onion instead of 1/2 cup. Add 2/3 cup sour cream. After the casserole has baked for 35 minutes, add some shredded cheese on top and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

I've made this recipe several times.  I don't cook a lot - I'm a guy who is lucky to have an excellent cook for a wife - but this is an easy one and everyone in the family likes it.  

When I make this strictly by the recipe, I think there's too much butter - it pools in the bottom of the pan.  So I adjust the recipe thusly:

1 package (1lb) frozen hashbrowns; 2 cans Cream of Chicken soup, 3tbsp butter, 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Sometimes I add some onion, sometimes not.  

I think it's much better this way.  Hey, look: my first allrecipes review!

I have used this recipe for years now, and it's always a hit. I like to make two thin layers in two 9X11 pans, because my family loves the extra crispiness!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great flavor!  I topped my casserole with crushed Corn Flakes to give it a nice finish.  You can also use Ritz Crackers which are just as good

This is one of those recipes I think will be better tomorrow. Right now, it tastes good, but not great. Way too greasy. I think the butter needs to absorb into the potatoes overnight. If that doesn't work, I would definately reduce the amount of butter. I recently made another recipe off of this site that was similar and my husband and I really like that one much better. Really liked the french fried onions though.

Great recipe!  I didn't have time to let the hashbrowns thaw completely before mixing with other ingredients but it turned out fine.  Like some of the other reviewers, I mixed some of the cheese in with other ingredients as well as sprinkled some on top.  I also mixed cheeses (cheddar & jack).  It was a hit!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it 3 times and I usually don't have any left overs.  My wife isn't as fond of onion as I am (she doesn't like the size I dice them I guess), so I used onion powder instead of fresh onion.  Also I add garlic powder.  For the cream of chicken soup I used cream of chicken with herbs the last two times I made it and it gave a nice flavor to it.  All in all a great and easy recipe to make (just don't forget to thaw the potatoes).

While we were visiting my mother in TX, she prepared these potatoes for us.  Rather than using chicken soup, she substituted 1 cup half and half and left out the onions. She used Ore Ida Southern Style Hashbrowns, which are little squares rather than shredded potatoes. They had to bake a little longer than instructed since some of the potatoes were more tender than others, but the out-come was delicious.  We did have to add a bit more salt since we didn't use the soup.  I bet these would be good with leftover chopped ham or turkey.  Good recipe Holly.

This was so yummy!  However, tt was really greasy so next time I will use 1/2 the butter or none at all.  I did not use any salt like the other reviewers suggested since the cream of chicken is already salted.  I also eyed how much cheese I put in.  Garlic powder and dried basil give it a nice kick.  Next time I might use double the potatoes.

This is really good, and I thought it was quite similar to Cracker Barrel's Casserole. I added some chopped green peppers to mine as well as a pond of lean ground beef to make it a main meal. Next time I would saute the onions in the butter, and then add it to the rest of the ingredients (they were a little crunchy). Also, 30 minutes was not enough time for this to cook if you use frozen hash browns. 45 minutes works better, everything is done by then. Overall, delicious. My 2 year old and husband ate it all, no leftovers, but it does make a lot.

This recipe is delicious. I added chopped green chile to it to give it a kick and used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead. 
Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is ok.  I don't think the butter is necessary. It kind of pooled around, so I had to soak it up with a napkin. Also, I never use salt for anything, so I thought it was way too salty. I used the O' brien potatoes instead, and it was good that way.  My husband and his friends scarfed it up! If you don't like salty stuff, don't add the salt. Also, maybe cut the butter in half. Otherwise, pretty good!

Used ingredients as called for in original recipe except used one can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup milk. No salt or onion (My fellas don’t like either). Once mixed, I covered it and put the bowl in the refrigerator for several hours.? Spray Pam on my glass 9X 13 pan.?Cooked at 400 for 45 minutes, covered. Then uncovered and added a layer of cheddar cheese. Continued to cook for about 10 minutes. Then switched to broil for the final 5 minutes. I did not have any issues with it being greasy and I did use the full amount of butter.? Absolutely delicious!

We love this recipe. The only thing we do differently is add 1 cup of cheese, and add 1/2 can of water to the soup. Next time I’ll follow Rebecca lee Brazier’s recipe. It sounds amazing!!

I loved it. I used a stick of butter and some tonies for seasoning. Also I cooked some hot jimmy dean sausage seasoned it with a little cayenne and added it to the mix before baking.

I made a smaller version of this casserole in a non-stick glass loaf pan, and it was terrific. I used half a bag of potatoes O'Brien (eliminating the need for extra onion), half a can of cream of chicken with mushrooms, 2T of melted butter, white pepper and a handful of cheddar cheese since that is what I had on-hand. Colby would have been great, but this is what I had on hand. Per the advice of one of the reviews I did not bother to thaw the potatoes.  I actually stirred everything up in my dish since I cook with it often and know it will not stick.

Made it for Company Pot Luck Thanksgiving '18. Big hit! Only thing I changed up:
- I sauteed the onions in the butter first to, a) make sure they were good and soft. b) get that onion flavor mixed in through out as best as possible
- I used a Mexican cheese blend that included colby and cheddar. Might have been a little more than 2 cups ;)

This is sooooo yummy! Honestly though, it's a little bit heavy on the butter.  With 2 cups of cheese, I'm pretty sure 1/4 c would be fine. I use the dried hashbrowns that you rehydrate in the cartons from Costco. One box appears to be about one pound frozen, so use two boxes for this. I haven't been to Cracker Barrel in a long time, but I'm totally full and I still want to eat more, so I'd say these rank right up there!

This was easy and a good side.  I put it in the crock pot on low for three hours.  Not as gooey as some of the others which use twice as much soup and sour cream.  I will make it again.

The third time I made it was the charm.  I omitted the onion because my family don't like the texture.  However, I added a tablespoon of onion powder instead.  The first time I followed the instructions to a tee, mixing the ingredients together.  I tried not to over combine, but it still came out as a glutenous mass.  The second time I tried again, mixing even less, and had very similar results.  The third time I just placed the shredded potatoes in the bottom of a sprayed casserole dish, sprinkled with salt and pepper, dotted it with the butter, layered on half of the cheese, mixed the onion powder with the soup and put that on, and topped it with the remaining cheese.  It came out perfectly.  The potatoes remained shredded and the edges were crispy. Delicious.

I let it bake an additional 10 mins and broiled for another five to get some color on it. Flavor was OK and the texture improved as it cooled off a bit. Was alarmed at how muchy it was when pulling out of the oven initially. I still prefer CB but this is a good place to start.

This recipe is awesome as it is. If I have two suggestions to make: Sautee the onions if you find raw too strong and use an additional cream of something soup. my husband ate more than 3/4 of a 9×13 pan of this heavenly casserole. ;)Thank you, it is dreamy!

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the butter. There is absolutely no need for the butter made it much to greasy. Otherwise next time I'll leave it out. A keeper.

Really good recipe, very much like the one from the famous national restaurant chain. I like a good sharp cheddar for myself and sprinkle a little extra on the top. Also, I like to use green onions, tops included, and lots of them. Also, I've seen a variation that replaces part of the cream of chicken soup with sour cream which I may try sometime. 
When you put it in the pan it looks like an awful big pile but it cooks down and condenses so you end up with about a third less by volume than it starts out.

This was alright. I subbed a cream of soup sub, added some sauerkraut and caraway seeds. I think those additions bumped the flavour up and made this a good pairing with pork chops. All our favourites, but it wasn't something we'd make again. It was a little too greasy as well.

Wow!! Delicious. Read the other reviews, but being the first time I tried it, I didn't want to mess with perfection. I will be making it again and again. Patty

For those of you who don't like the onion taste ~ problem solved by melting the butter in a small pan and saute the onion for a few minutes to remove the raw taste, also works with green onions.  I usually cut back on the butter and my recipe calls for adding one cup of sour cream.  It's always a hit and the leftovers are good warmed in a frying pan for breakfast and top each serving with a fried egg!

This was delicious! Made a few small tweaks because I had a smaller, unfrozen bag of shredded potatoes. Half the salt and 1/3 cup of butter instead of a 1/2. I used dried chopped onion instead of fresh because it is what I had on hand. I melted the remaining butter, mixed in 1/2 a row of Ritz crackers and used that to top the casserole. The whole family loved it.

Very yummy! You must saute the onion in the butter before combining with the rest of the ingredients though to mellow them out but this is much better than the original and no driving to the restaurant-Even easier if you combine all the ingredients the night before and keep in the fridge until ready to cook

This is a tasty recipe and very worth making. I used heavy cream in place of the soup because I don't use canned soups and I didn't have any of my own on hand. There was still plenty of flavor and it was nice and creamy. Now I don't have to wait in line at cracker Barrel when I want hash brown casserole.

This recipe is excellent. I made one small change because I refuse to eat canned soup. Instead of cream of chicken soup I used plain Fage greek yogurt. Treat out excellent and has the tangy taste of sour cream with out all the calories.

Try this recipe!  You won't regret it.  My family loves it when I make this casserole.  I get many requests to make this again.  The only thing I do differently is I add 8oz of sour cream to the recipe.  YUM!!!!

Only thing I did different is use left over baked potatoes instead of frozen hashbrowns.  I peele them, put them through the salad shooter, and fried them up a bit. It was excellent!

Great dish, I did however make a few modifications based on other reviews.  Used only 1/4 cup butter, one can cream of chicken and mushroom soup (although I doubt it matters which you use) and added 8oz of sour cream to the mixture.  Added some cheese to the mix and then some on top.  Tasted good, everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Next time I make it I will try adding cornflake mixture to the top for crunch.  Also want to try adding sausage crumbles.

I have been making this dish for more than 20 years now, and it is a favorite in our household. During potlucks I'm always asked to make this as well. I too have lightened this dish with less cheese,lower salt content, and at times have added vegetables to change it up.

Skipped the onion and used Cream of Mushroom soup, since we are vegetarian.  Also added some Colby Jack cheese with the cheddar, along with some sour cream. Delicious!!

Do not add corn flakes! That's just weird! We are a vegetarian family(not vegan!!) and we exchange the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom, add a cup of sour cream, cut the butter in half and cut the salt all together. Delicious! I'm sure it's just as wonderful as is, but we exchange all animal flesh for veggies per personal preference.

I had never made hashbrown casserole before and this was a great starter recipe! I added two eggs and a teaspoon of garlic powder to the recipe and baked this for 30 mins covered and then another 20 minutes uncovered. I brought this to a cookout and it was a huge hit! I've also tried the same version of this and added breakfast sausage for a hearty brunch and hamburger meat for a tasty dinner with leftovers I look forward to eating!

Very delicious!  When I am making this for guests I prepare as is, if its for myself and my spouse I usually swap the butter for fat free sour cream instead, and use light cheddar cheese and fat free cream of mushroom soup.  I also use only half the onion.  Great recipe!

LOW FAT Edition....I found this to be the least offensive to the waist line with some changes.  I used 25% less sodium cream of mushroom soup, no salt, only 1 brick (1 cup) of cheddar cheese and only 1/2 the butter (4 Tsp).  Sure it wasn't that gooey cheesy goodness but it was still tasty and without the guilt.  :)

I halved the recipe and kept the suggested pan size. I also cooked it at 425 which made the whole thing extra crispy and nice. I also added two giant spoonfuls of sour cream and I think that gave the whole dish a winning zing.

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy to make and did not call for sour cream or lots of other strange ingredients for no reason.  Tasted exactly like the restaurant version!  After 35 minutes I turned off the stove and just let it set there to keep warm until the rest of the breakfast was finished. Served with coffee, thick sliced bacon, and bakery toasted bread.  Made a nice breakfast I had not had in awhile. Will make again.  Thanks for submitting!

This was ok, not as good as I was hoping.  I would make it again but I would cut back on the onion. Way too much for me. I think I would also add another can of soup as it seemed a little dry. My husband really liked it though. He fried some the next morning for his breakfast and said that was even better!  I think adding some ham, bacon or sausage would make it awesome!

Very good! I didn't use any butter and used a half container of fat free sour cream.  I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. I crumbled up bacon in too. It was yummy!

This casserole was great.   I highly recommend sauteing the onion in the butter for several minutes before adding to the rest of the mixture.  This takes away the overpowering flavor of the onion and makes it more sweet.  Delicious!

This was good stuff. I omitted the butter (I didn't want it to be greasy) and added a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup because it was so hard to mix with only one can of soup. We really enjoyed this one at it will be a semi regular as its kinda high in cholesterol and I have one in the house that needs to bring down his cholesterol. Thx for the wonderful comfort dish!!

Made the recipe this morning and it came out well.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  Then put it in a 400 degree oven for about 20 more minutes and it crisped out pretty nicely on top.  I think the next time though I might try adding one more can of cream of chicken.  Overall though it is a good dish and I would make it again.

I made it according to the recipe only I sprinkled the top with about half a pound of crispy bacon crumbles. It was delish and was all gone! I had several people ask me for the recipe. Will totally make this again!

I have been making this dish for a few years now. But decided to follow this recipe to see what happened. I always love the end product. It is a a great side dish, especially for potlucks. But I don't think that 35 minutes @ 350 works. You need to up the temp or the time. I think 45-60 minutes at 350 works best.

Excellent.  Made enough for the week- reheats well fried up again for leftover breakfast.  Loved not having to fry it.  Did cut back on the butter- doesn't need as much as it says.  Added onions as well.  Oh- and since I live where frozen hash browns aren't an option, I just diced up potatoes into tiny cubes.

Just add 8 ounces of sour cream and you have the best hash brown casserole around.  You can also add potato chips in place of corn flakes for the top or no topping at all.

This was very good. I didn't use the onions because I don't like them but I followed the recipe exactly, a bit more S&P though. I took this to a pot luck brunch and everyone enjoyed it.

I have made this for many years, with just a couple of differences.  I saute the onions in the 1/2 c. butter until tender, then mix everything together.  I bake 45 mins. covered, then use 2 c. crushed potato chips and 1/4 c. butter(mixed together), to top the potatoes and put back in the oven for 15 mins. longer(uncovered).  We LOVE this casserole!

Excellent and easy -- perfect side for breakfast.  In an attempt to make it healthier, I omitted the butter and added 1/2 cup fat free sour cream instead. I also used 98% reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  It still tasted very rich and I will continue to use these fat savers when I make it again!  Great recipe!

This was fantastic! Though knowing me, I made some small changes ... omited the butter except a light spread on the bottom of the glass dish, I used cream of mushroom rather than chicken and added 3/4 cup of sour cream. Very nice indeed. Thanks!

Made this for a brunch, and my guests really enjoyed this. Didn't really have time to read the reviews so I made as written. Used a Jack-Colby cheese blend. Both hubby and I agree that it was a little bland, and that it might taste better with cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I also didn't care for the onions. I made this the night before the brunch, and it was very easy to make. Thanks for sharing.

This is a good Pot-Luck dish.  Its very easy to make and is yummy. I made the following changes.

In addition to the Cream of Chicken soup, I added Campbell's soup Chedder Cheese.  I also added 8oz (1cup) of Sour Cream.  I use unsalted butter so the dish wasn't too salty.  I also only added 1/3 cup of chopped onion.

This is how I made mine... I used 2 - 1 pound 4 oz pkg of refrigerated hash browns (found in the dairy department), 1/2 med. yellow onion chopped, dash of salt, few dashes of pepper, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 - 8 oz container of sour cream (I used low fat)and 10 broken up pieces of cooked bacon. Mixed it all together in a bowl. I did NOT add any cheese at all to this mixture. Spread mixture in a 9 x 13 pan, added shredded cheese over top of half the mix (my hubby does not like cheese, so I have to keep it off of his. That's the reason for me not adding to the mix), Added a crushed corn flake topping by mixing flakes with 1/4 TBS of melted butter and sprinkling over top. Baked for 45 min's at 350. Yummy! Tasted just like a baked potato.

This is really good! I'm looking for a recipe that is like the Cracker Barrel hashbrown casserole. This isn't really it, but it's still really good. I think I may add some breakfast sausage in the mix and maybe some bell peppers next time I make it. Good stuff.

We thought this had too much cheese. I will keep looking for a great hashbrown casserole.

This recipe is great.   I added cubed ham to the recipe and used velveeta cheese instead of cheddar.  My whole family loved it. I will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe! Super easy to make.  I made it for supper and added 2 cups of cooked ham, cubed and served with brocolli.  It made a great meal and the ham was great in it.  A new family favorite!  Thanks a lot for the recipe.

My family did not like the wetness of this dish.  After baking for the recommended amt of time, it was still wet.  I will not make this again.  I think I will stick to breakfast casseroles with sausage, eggs, grits, and cheese.  I guess it depends on each person's tastes buds, b/c most of the reviews said this was great.

I make these for my boyfriend and it is one of his favorites.  He used to love the Cracker Barrel ones and now loves this recipe.  I do add corn flakes to the top layer for a crunchy effect and it works great.

This was okay.. I made two batches of this. In the first batch, I used slightly less potato than was called for, but it was really dry. In the second batch I added about 1.5 cups sour cream, which helped a little. It wasn't the best I've had. I used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular salt and topped it with crushed potato chips.

This was easy and pretty good.  I did as a couple reviewers suggested, used less salt (about 3/4 tsp, was still a bit salty), cut butter down to 2 tbsp.  and used fat free canned soup.  I like my hash browns crunchy so maybe next time I will put it under the broiler for a couple of mins.

Very tasty, although a little salty.  They are also terrible for you (look at the fat content!), so I would only save them for special occasions, i.e. Easter and Christmas brunch.

I shredded some potatoes and since I had all the ingredients on hand, made this for breakfast this morning. I agree with others, and have made a hashbrown casserole that I liked a bit better made with sour cream. But this one was good also, and a nice change. The chicken soup added a different sort of flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe...I made it exactly like the recipe called for and my husband and 3 sons just loved these hashbrowns.  They even ask when we are having them again. However, I did feel that they needed a little more cook time then the recipe called for.  I leave them in for an extra 5-10 minutes and they turn out perfect.

This is a great quick and easy rescipie. The first time a had it was at my aunties house (who is a great cook) she made it as a side dish and my husband came home raving about it! The best thing about it is that you can throw in what ever kinda meat you want.

After reading the reviews, I decided to change the recipe a little. I added 8 oz of sour cream, chopped and sauted green pepper with the onion,garlic and a dash of ground mustard. I also added about 1/2 a can of cream of celery soup. It was a five star dish this way. I feel it was a 4 that justs needs a little more.

Wonderful even if it is a heart attack on a plate!  I got a can of cream of potato by mistake-but it worked.  Also added a little Ranch salad dressing for some of the sour cream, and some garlic powder.  Mixed extra cheese into the sauce as well as sprinkling on top.  Great with ham!

Good but a little on the salty side. I used some Italian sausage which might have made it more salty but I was surprised by how much.

This is a winner in my home!  I substitute sour cream for the butter always.  Sometimes I add a jar of Hormel real bacon bits (or leftover bacon chopped up) for variety.

I have made this dish many times and everyone loves it!  The changes I made were no onions, place potatoes in pan first, and in a 4 cup measure, add soup, butter, and some of the cheese, mix the ingredients into the potatoes, and then sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top of the potatoes, then bake. Let set for few minutes before serving.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe and liked how simple and fast it was to prepare.  It ended up greasy tasting and didn't hold it's form very well.  I pan-fried it the next morning for breakfast in the hopes it might get crispy but it didn't work.  I will use this recipe again to serve casually to my family (they loved the flavor) but wouldn't consider serving it to guests.

This recipe is great for a Sunday brunch.  But it seems to be a little bland.  Seems as thought it is missing something to punch up the flavor. I made my salsa recipe the same weekend (Jen's Fresh and Spicy Salsa) and poured a little over each bite.  Thought it was a great combo.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I used pepper jack cheese because I didn't have any Cheddar, so it had a little kick to it.  And I added some ham, too.  I think it doesn't need the extra salt.  I also had to bake it for about 45 minutes so the potatoes got done.  My coworker and I really enjoyed it.  Thank you.

Just what we were looking for - like the recipe from a popular restaurant we love.  I did make two changes which we feel improved the recipe. I added 2 cans of soup instead of one - and 3 cups of cheese instead of 2.
thanks!

Very good and easy.  Like other reviewers, I cut the butter in half, and will use only 1/3 the next time.  Perfect with meatloaf as comfort-food!

This receipe is being requested for every holiday by my family. No more mashed potatoes and gravy to go with the ham. It's always hashbrown casserole now. It's wonderful with all meats. I'd say for sure there are no fewer calories in this, but it's soooo much more delicious!

This was very good.  I used 1 lb. of frozen hashbrowns, 3/4 can of cream of chicken soup, and melted about 1/3 cup butter and once it was in the pan, I put a few dabs of butter on top- I kept everything else the same. FABULOUS!

I had heard of this casserole for many years and thought I would give it a try. Never again ! It is far too salty ( i would omit the added salt all together ) and far far too greasy ( I would substitute milk for the softened butter)for my taste. Looked good and smelled great but just dident do a thing for me.

I threw a baby shower brunch for my sister, and needed a recipe for a hashbrown casserole.  I decided to try this one because it had simple ingredients and directions.  It turned out GREAT! I got so many compliments that I will use it again for sure.

Awesome! The kiddos loved it (1 1/2 and 2 1/2) and I thought it was a super easy sidedish to prepare with grilled chicken and veggies. I used 1/2 the potatoes, 3/4 stick butter, a full can of cream of chicken soup, and 1 1/2 cup cheese. I omitted the onion because I didn't have one on hand, but added onion powder and garlic powder. Delish!!! Will certainly make it again!

My family loves this recipe! I've made it "as is", substituted Cheddar Cheese soup and even topped it with crumbled tortilla chips, all producing great results.  If you're onion-sensitive, onion powder works just fine.

PERFECT!!!!!! Would not change much about this recipe -- it is great as is.  If you don't like as much onion, putting less in doesn't change the quality.  I usually add more pepper.

This has great flavor..however, I can't seem to get it to brown on the top! It always gets hard around the edges, and never browns! What am I doing wrong! Maybe I should just accept that it doesn't "LOOK" as good as that restaurants! Thanks its yummy by all means.

Very oily with the butter and the cheddar cheese.  Had to 'mop' it up with a napkin.  The flavor was good and the guests complimented it favorably.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  My son really liked it until he tasted an onion, I guess we won't include onion the next time.  My daughter wouldn't even try it but she is the picky one.  Very flavorful and super easy.  Thanks.

I just love these. Coudn't believe it when I first tried it. My son didn't like the sour cream taste, but that was ok, more for me and my husband. I could barely taste the sour cream myself.

This potato casserole is delicious!!My family loved it especially my 2yr old picky eater.I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to it and some crushed cornflakes as a topping then baked it..
the results were great!!Next time i'll omitt the onion completely my 9yr old didn't want to taste it with onions in it. Great recipe though.

The recipe turned like I expected the next day as a leftover.  The day it was cooked it seemed bland.
This recipe needs a rest period.  Perhaps let the uncooked dish sit in the fridge overnight.

Like in other reviews, I mixed everything together the night before. And then lightly (not packing it) put it in a 13x9 pan in the morning to cook. I followed the directions except I used approximately 3/4 can  of cream of chicken and condensed cheese soup.  Next time a review suggested using colby jack cheese. It was a hit at our brunch.

This was a hit for Christmas! I dropped the amount of onion to 1/4 cup & sauteed first in a bit of butter. Also used 8 ounces of Colby cheese, shredded it myself. Did not use pre-shredded cheese due to the junk that is added to it. Baked for one hour at  350. Had a very nice crispness to it around the edges. Not one morsel was left! Family wiped the dish clean! This is a keeper recipe!

I'm a lover of all things potato and this was pretty good, but too salty for my taste.  I would omit the salt entirely since there's enough salt in the cheese as well as the soup.  I used Cream of Celery soup and Colby Cheese.

This is the legit recipe!  One minor change I'll make next time: lightly sauté the onions. They don't cook down too much and while I didn't mind the pop of flavor my wife preferred them cooked down a little. Otherwise, super easy and so good.

I made this dish as written with no changes. These hashbrowns are a Christmas morning staple at our house. This dish is a star-of-the-show and a family favorite!  We serve this during our annual Christmas Day Brunch in Christmas Pajamas and there are never any leftovers. Enjoy!!

use frozen onion to remove the onion texture but still give flavor. use colby cheese instead of cheddar. Works well in oven or with crock pot.

Yum!  Added diced ham so we could eat it as a main dish.  Substituted cream of celery for cream of chicken because it is what I had on hand.  It turned out great.

Tastes great but next time I will probably cut down on some of the butter. Fresh from oven was great but the leftovers seemed a bit too oily.

A few tweaks to make this good recipe great :
-Grease your baking dish with Crisco, not spray. ??
-Sautee the white onion for a couple minutes before adding it in. 
-Use Colby Jack cheese instead of Cheddar. It's creamier and a little smoky, which gives it more of a robust flavor. 
-Crumbled hickory smoked bacon added into this is PURE HEAVEN! 
-Keep the potatoes frozen until just ready to use; do not thaw them out first. This increases your cook time about 15 minutes, but it'll be worth it! 
-Cream your butter, then mix all of the other ingredients together in a separate bowl, then add them into the potatoes last.
-Adding chives or chopped broccoli into this converts it to a magnificent dinner option.

I made this for our family New Year's brunch.   It was VERY greasy.  I think a half a cup of butter was overkill.  Next time, I'll use pam spray or somesuch and half the butter.

Everyone loved it!  I made it for Christmas...only change I subbed cream of mushroom for cream of chicken... we had a vegetarian over for dinner.  It was a hit... and now I am making it again for New Year's.  This time I will try with cream of chicken soup.

Made this today for Christmas brunch and it’s now a family favorite. However I did a couple of things different.  First thing is: I used Southwest style Hash Browns instead of the regular which added so much flavor. Omg! Then I added a few diced onions to mine, not a lot. I also did half Mild Cheddar and Colby cheese. I used more of the Colby since there was a lot of reviews saying it was really greasy when they used Cheddar. I didn’t add any butter. I mixed up my potatoes the night before and let the sit overnight in the refrigerator. Cooked them on 350-400 not sure how long. I just waited until the onions disintegrated into the Hashbrown Casserole and wasn’t crunchy any longer. I did use Cream of Chicken soup but I think I’ll use Cream Of Celery next time and I might add some Chicken Stock so it doesn’t dry out. All in all the family loved it. Not a bite left! I’ll definitely make this again.

I like this very much. However, there is an error in baking time. The video says 60 minutes. The instructions in type say 35 minutes. It is 60 minutes, not 35. Adjust the prep time please.

Made it as is, but added a little thyme. Served with grilled rib eye steaks and paired with a cabernet sauvignon.

I first made this recipe 7 years ago for our family Thanksgiving brunch. It was a hit and I have made it every year since. I have to make 2 batches of it and there are no leftovers. 

I follow the recipe exactly as it is. My family loves it and looks forward to it every year.  I highly recommend it.

I get asked to make these over and over when we go to potluck-style get togethers.   It's a simple but tasty recipe and it hits the taste buds of the picky eaters as well as the ones who will try anything.

Great as written, and also with cooked & crumbled sausage or diced ham added.  I like Jimmy Dean hot sausage.  I cook the onion with the butter in the microwave before adding it to be sure it gets done.

This is a very good recipe, but very rich. I will make it again using less butter and low fat sour cream for comparison. Taste wise it's a 5 star! Calorie wise not...

I accidentally posted an unfinished review so here I go again: this recipes it delicious! I gave it 4 stars because I did change some things 1) I only used 1lb of frozen potatoes, if you’re feeding more than 8 people then you might want 2lbs like the recipe says. 2) I only used 1/4cup of butter. All the bother measurements I left the same. 3) I sautéed the onions in the butter before adding them to the mixture because I hate undercooked onions in HBR 4) I used cream of onion soup instead of chicken because I didn’t want little chicken bits in my casserole. 5) Then I baked it for closer to an hour (I eyeballed it instead of timing it) to get a crispy top. I served this at Easter brunch and got multiple compliments on it. I will definitely repeat.

I like to use the Alexia hasbrowns when I make this, because they come already seasoned with garlic, onion and white pepper.  I add one can of cheddar cheese soup,  about 1 1/2 cups of fine shredded cheddar,  2 Tablespoons of softened butter and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I mix it together the night before with the frozen hashbrowns as another reviewer suggested.  The next day I cook it for 35 mins. on 350.  I added a cornflake crumb topping (1 cup cornflake crumbs mixed with 2 T of melted butter) and put it under the broiler on low for a few minutes to brown the top.  So good!

The family liked this; I thought it was ok, but it was definitely better as leftovers. The hash browns ended up more like mashed potatoes by the time it was done.

I made a lot of additions to this, but will still rate a 5. I brought it to our Christmas Eve gathering tonight and it was a huge hit! I used two, 20 oz pkgs of Simply Potatoes Fresh Shredded Hash-Browns. I added sour cream, cream cheese, Velveeta, and Half-n-Half, which I mixed together with  shredded Colby Cheese, the butter  and the Cream of Chicken Soup, then melted in the microwave before mixing this into the potatoes. I also added dried parsley and minced garlic, which I sauteed with the chopped onion before mixing into the potato mixture. I sprayed the pan with Olive Oil Pam, to prevent sticking and I baked them for an hour at 350. Sooooo good!

Was very good but instead of using the cornflake topping I used cheesy garlic crutons crushed up.  I also cooked hashbrowns and onions to soften them in fry pan with olive oil before I mixe everything together.

I was looking for a potato side dish to make with my meatloaf and found this recipe here. It was delicious! I did make an addition to it by adding a can of corn to the recipe (drained, of course). I will be making this a lot & it's so easy to prepare.

Tasty recipe, a real alternative time saver,  pleasant change for those who, like me, is "obligated" to cook potatoes for dinner every night by an Irish husband. I also prepared it with grated fresh potatoes and once I tried to add fresh hot chilli peppers and another time saffron, always delicious, a win!

Tastes exactly like the Cracker Barrel hash brown casserole! Since I found this recipe I make it every weekend for my family for breakfast, we LOVE it. The only thing I do differently is use cream of onion soup and omit the chopped onion. #lazy

Very good and easy!  I added a cup of sour cream.  I didn't use salt and used half the butter.  If potatoes are somewhat frozen, cover with foil and cook for a good hour.

Pretty good, I did add some diced mushroom and jalapeño. 
It definitely needs more butter and cheese, but definitely with a few changes  would be delish!!

Great flavor. Took longer than stated time to 'brown' and I ended up sticking it under the broiler for a little bit to get it the way I like but other than that excellent addition to the table.

The original recipe was okay. It wasn't horrible, but I did make some changes to it so that way it not only tasted better but is also gluten-free! I added 8 ounces of sour cream, replaced the cream of chicken soup to creamy mushroom soup by Progresso (a gluten-free soup), reduced the onions to 1/4 cup, reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons, and added some more cheese - 1 finely shredded bag and 1 regularly shredded bag. I mixed everything together except the regularly shredded bag, poured it into a casserole dish and then had the leftover cheese spread on top to make a cheese crust. Then I baked it for 35 minutes on 350 degrees and then baked it again for 15 minutes on 450 to brown the top. That's my changes!

I took one reviewers advice and mixed together the night before and placed in the fridge. Not bad advice, because I do think it made it easier to mix together the next day, but In the future I will just put the bag of hashbrowns into the fridge the night before, it was very difficult to mix the butter/cream of chicken evenly into the frozen hashbrowns. I plan on using a mixer with the cookie paddles and  let it do all of the work for me. I followed the recipe exactly, except added for grating a little sharp cheddar over the top. I baked for 45 mins. Turned out VERY close to cracker barrel.

Enjoyed this Christmas morning and I'll make it again. The best part was I made it all the day before and only had to bake it in the morning!  I followed the tweeks that a few reviewers suggested: cutting down the butter, substituting in light sour cream (there's nothing light about this dish but it's so good!), condensed cheddar cheese soup, and I meant to sub one cup of cheddar for Colby but bought shredded jack cheese by mistake.  It was still a hit and all gone after brunch! So many ways to jazz it up to your liking!

Not a bad recipe. I think it's missing. Something. Not sure what yet. 

I did add a out 1 tablespoon of garlic and a few dashes of dried parsley into the mix. 

The ole lady said it would be good with less butter cause of the grease from the cheese and to add some drained cooked hamburger to it.

This was pretty darn good.  I used half a can of cream of mushroom and half a can of cream of chicken because as a rule I don't like using cream of chicken soup because I don't like the salty processed chicken taste.  I used one cup of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of colby/jack.  Also I added about 1/4 to 1/3  cup of half and half.  I cooked it at 375 for about 40-45 minutes to make sure it was cooked through and super crispy on top.  My husband said it was better than cracker barrel.

You can't cook this at 350 degrees in 35 minutes!  The onions are still raw as well as the potatoes. Cook at 365 degrees for 1 hour and it comes out perfect with a light golden crust. Just sayin'.

This recipe is amazing! The only thing that I did differently was thinly dicing the onion instead of chopped and I used sharp cheddar cheese. Personally, I love over-easy eggs and I served the eggs atop a small portion of these yummy, cheesy potatoes and it was heavenly.

I tweaked this a bit to reduce the high sodium levels from the soup.  Instead of soup I used 1 cup low sodium chicken/or vegetable broth and 1 cup of sour cream and always garlic for extra yummy flavor.  Everyone was amazed how delicious this was.

Delicious and yummy, I'll definitely be making it again! I used garlic instead of onion, because I don't like onions, and I added a little almond milk to make it stir easier. I also left it in a lot longer, removed the foil and turned up the temperature toward the end. And I used my stove's broil function for a little bit to get it more cooked/crispy on top.

Delicious!  This is so much better than the "typical hashbrown casserole" that one thinks of.  I made it exactly as the recipe states except I used the square country style potatoes rather than the shredded.  I like the fact that this recipe doesn't have sour cream as an ingredient. Not a fan.  I've been looking for a potato recipe that doesn't use sour cream and I finally found it!  I made this 2 days ago and already plan on making it again this week for guests.  Thank you Savannah0410 for posting!

My husband was a big fan of this dish. I baked it a little longer than indicated because we like a little >crunch" to it! I also added two tablespoons of sour cream to it as well! Good potluck dish!

This was just okay.  The taste wasn't bad, but both my husband and I thought there was too much cheese in it - and we like cheese!  It was a good recipe to use up some hash browns that I had, but I won't be making this one again.

I have made this without using the butter at all and added just one tub of sour cream instead and it turned out great, creamy and good!!!!  Makes the dish lower in fat and it isn't greasy at all!  Even the guys loved it!  I have also made it with half the butter it called for and that was really good and helped with the greasiness.  I never use margarine and always use real butter!

This is a really great recipe.  I sauteed my onions, added mushrooms and one extra can of cream of chicken soup and added half a can of milk to that portion only.  It made it extra creamy and easier to mix.   I can't wait to make it again, and again!!

So good I didn't even get any!  Coworkers raved about it!  I took advice of one review and cut butter back to 2 tbsp and added 8 oz sour cream.  Next time I will try the lowfat kind.  I also used a mix of Colby jack and Monterey.  Will make again.

We liked this a lot.  The only thing I did different was covering it for 35 minutes, then uncovered it and baked an additional 25.  I like the potatoes nice and soft, more like real potatoes than packaged.  Next time, I will use half the cheese.

My husband and guests really loved this.  I sauteed the onions before mixing into potatoes, then added an extra can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I  used shredded Colby cheese in the mixture and added cheddar on top.  Will definitely make again.

Great! worked well! I used cream of mushroom soup and a combo of shredded cheddar cheese ( topping) and a packet of Velveeta to mix in, and it was delicious! This is a keeper and will go in the "regular rotation".

Excellent, we ate every last bite (as a side dish for four hungry adults).  I did cut the butter to less than half (used under one stick), since the package of potatoes was just under two pounds.  Used cream of celery instead of cream of chicken. And I cooked it a lot longer because it wasn't browning up in the time suggested. Thanks for a great recipe.

I go to cracker barrel every other morning for the hash brown casserole so I definitely know what it taste like. This recipe hit it on the nail. It taste just like the restaurant! I am very happy!!! I did make some adjustments based on other reviews. I used 1/4 cup butter so it wouldn't be too greasy, 1/2 tsp salt so it's not too salty, and shredded Colby cheese. It turned out perfect!!!!

This recipe is good but very greasy. I cut the butter down to about 2-3 tbs and add 8oz of sour cream. I also started using cream of potato instead of cream of chicken soup. I just got tired of picking out all the little chicken pieces from the soup.

This recipe works much better if you use (1) one lb bag of hash browns. I think that's why some people are complaining of it being dry. Also I used a 4 tbsp of butter. Instead of chopping up onion and running the risk that hubby would flip out, I grated about 1 tbsp of onion. Potatoes and onions are good buddies and next time I will actually chop up the onion and saute it a little in a pan, then add it to the mixture. I used Campbells healthy request cream of chicken to cut back on salt, I also didn't add any salt. I only put in maybe 1/2 cup of cheese, hubby is not a big cheese fan. But I will increase it next time. I added 1 spoonful of sour cream. I baked it @ 350 covered (with foil) for 30 min and then baked uncovered for another 30. It was not dried out and not greasy. It did lack flavor but I had to make changes due my husband and his preferences. Potatoes need a lot of love and I will be sure to add more onion, increase the cheese and maybe use regular cream of chicken soup, instead of the healthy request, the next time I make this. Definitely a comfort food and one I am happy to add to my rotation. I made this with pork chops and green beans.

Made it for dinner last week and everyone loved it!!! I added some sour cream as previous reviewer recommended. And also used less of the cheddar and shredded some fontina cheese and butterkaese, as I needed to use those up. This could very easy be made with macaroni noodles for Mac n cheese casserole as well!

I make this frequently! So easy and always a hit! I added cooked crumbled bacon this time. I didn't have cornflakes so I did plain breadcrumbs on stove with butter and then topped casserole in last 5 minutes! Delicious!

Great and easy recipe. I cooked it for about 10-15 mins longer to make them more crispy. I also added a little bit of heavy cream to it, I'm sure milk would have worked too. Just to make them a little creamier.

This recipe is so easy and very good! I made these with fresh shredded potatoes done by hand. My only mistake is that I forgot to rinse the potatoes once they've been shredded so the casserole had a very potatoey taste. Next time I'll rinse them and the review again. Great recipe!

Always a favorite of mine!  Good if u thaw out tater tots and crumble them instead of hash browns. Always a hit! I throw in a tad of garlic or garlic powder and bake a few min more for a crispy top and corners

I used this recipe, but added 8oz sour cream, substituted the cheddar cheese for shredded Colby Jack cheese and 1/2 cup of Velveeta cheese, substituted cream of chicken soup for cheddar cheese soup, used sweet onion (Vidalia), and sprinkled smokey paprika on top. I had to cook it 15 mins longer than 35 mins as the recipe calls for maybe becase I added extra cheese and sour cream). My recipe tasted much better than Cracker Barrel's. The difference is that mine came out creamy & cheesy, but not too cheesy. Cracker Barrel's tends to be much firmer and dryer. Im thinking that they aren't using sour cream, maybe they use milk.

Everyone at our BBQ raved about this recipe, even the picky toddlers. I did make some changes to the recipe as follows: I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken soup. I crisped up some bacon and caramelized some onion in a little bit of the bacon grease. I did as a previous reviewer suggested and mixed all ingredients together the night before, including frozen potato shreds. And finally, I mixed a little bit of melted butter and corn flakes to sprinkle on top because that's how I always are potato casserole growing up. Next time, I will use about 75% of the butter that's called for because it seemed a little too much for my liking.

Been making this for years.  The only change I make is sub green onions for the onions.  Everybody loves it.  Great for holidays and family gatherings.

I made this on my annual ski trip this Saturday for 31 people and it was amazing. One person said they don't like hash browns but that they loved this recipe. I followed the recipe except that I used colby cheese instead of cheddar.  I also melted the butter.  It turned out amazing and I will be making this again very soon.  This would be amazing in a breakfast casserole too.

Good basic recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup sour cream. I baked for about 40 minutes and it still could have used more time.

A very simple recipe to follow, easy to tweak to your own liking. As is, it is very good, but a little bland for my preferences. I added garlic and sweet corn to this recipe, AMAZING! Was a great side dish for biscuits and gravy. Thank you for adding this!

This was exactly what I was hoping for! I used cream of mushroom soup since that's what I had and loved it! The onions were definitely noticeable but in no way overpowering. I didn't have any cornflakes so I used panko crumbs with melted butter for the topping. Thanks for the great recipe; I'll be making this for Thanksgiving as a side dish.

I made this for the first time this week. My family loved it.   I did not have frozen hash browns so I put fresh potatoes thru a course grater on my food processor.   It took abit longer to cook - 1 hour 15 minutes but it was worth the wait.  It was even better on day 2.  This is now my family's favorite way to have potatoes.

These are the cheesy hashbrowns I remember from when I was growing up. They were ever present at family potlucks! I used Ore-Ida hashbrowns and switched the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom. These baked great and tasted just like I remember!

I love hashbrown casserole, but, as written, this recipe only deserves three stars, and that's only for its potential. The first time I prepared it, it turned out greasy and dry at the same time, even though that might seem like an oxymoron, and it was also very bland. The second time I made it, I halved the butter and added another can of cream of chicken and three generous splashes of milk -- if I had to guess, I'd say it was close to 1/2 a cup or so. I also added way more black pepper and a smidgen of garlic powder, and it turned out more like a 4-star recipe -- nothing I would necessarily serve for company, but a nice accompaniment to a weeknight meatloaf for BF and I. Overall, I like the premise of this recipe and think it's great to play around with, but I think you will be disappointed with the results if you follow it exactly.

Way too much butter in this recipe, I'd recommend using half the amount suggested.  I'm not so sure you could call this a restaurant-quality dish, unless you make some major tweaks.  Otherwise, it provides a decent base recipe to build upon

All I can say is blech. I've never had this in a restaurant or even tried anything similar so this was a new dish for me.  Mushy hash browns drowned in an overly cheesy and heavy sauce, no thank you. Made exactly like the recipe except I used less butter,  and I can't see how that would have affected it so much.

Very good recipe. I cut the butter in half, left out the salt and added about a 1/4 cup of milk and 8 oz of sour cream.  I also added a can of cream of celery (i love the flavor) and used sharp cheddar because that's all I had in the fridge.

Super yummy! I implemented some changes based on other user reviews and I absolutely loved the idea of substituting the butter for sour cream. It makes it so much lighter without sacrificing the flavor. I also use cream of mushroom soup simply because I'm vegetarian and it still tastes great!

I accidentally omitted the salt and was surprised that it wasn't even needed! I also cut the butter down to 1/3 c. It tasted great! I definitely will be making this again.

I made this basically as directed, omitted the onion because I can't stand them O:-) and I added a panko/melted butter crumb topping so it hade some texture, upped it to 400 degrees and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes until it browned. It was good, I would make it again. Kind of heavy for a side, could use something to lighten it up...

Used all the butter listed. Could have reduced it to 3T. as other reviewers stated. 1/4 c. onion was more than enough. Also topped w/crushed cornflakes w/ melted margarine. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good. I had to change one thing, as we are gluten free, (no cream of chicken soup), I subbed 6 oz. heavy cream, and 6 oz. chick stock. I also added 2 cloves fresh chopped garlic. Yum!

This has been my "go-to" cheesy potato recipe ever since discovering it a few years ago.  Just realized I hadn't reviewed it before now.  It is a crowd pleaser every time.  Thanks for sharing,MARBALET!

I use part cream of chicken and part cream of mushroom soup. Also, I crunch up corn flakes and sprinkle on top adding some of the melted butter so they don't burn when in the oven. I usually double the batch and freeze. Excellent recipe!!

I have been using this recipe, with  little tweaking, for years and my family can't get enough of it. This is a very good base recipe. A couple of tips for those first trying this - thaw out the hashbrowns before using and mix in a large bowl. I usually mix with my hands - very messy but much easier.

I made this a couple of times and it is absolute the best! I made a couple of different changes. I used a package of Potato-Ole Seasoned Crispy Crowns and cooked them by the directions on the package. And then chopped them up. I grated some 1/3 less fat velveta cheese instead of cheddar. And I used the one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom. Finally, I used Light Sour Cream and Corn Flakes. It's awesome. My wife and I could eat it every week.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  It's a very good base recipe that tolerates additional ingredients very well.  I've added browned crumbled sausage, diced green chiles, and diced red peppers.  I used cream of mushroom soup (personal preference).  This recipe makes a lot, and reheats very well the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe for years and its always a big hit!  I leave out the butter, salt and the chopped onion and mix a large container of French Onion dip in with the soup and potatoes!  So quick, so easy!  IT IS FAB!!

Awesome! I halved the potatoes and onion, used only 2 T butter, some dried parsley, just a bit of fresh ground pepper, a pinch of sea salt, some dried parsley and used butter to grease the pan (8 x 8). I used the whole can of soup  and 8 oz cheese rather than half and topped with a 1/4 cup of panko/parmesan (an 1/8th C each) for the crust. I cooked for 45 minutes but I think and hour would have been even better! A keeper for sure! Made it as a side to a juicy grilled steak! Yum!

I added 2 cans of green beans to the mix and on the bottom of the casserole dish I put boneless skinless chicken thighs with the potato mix on top. It took a while longer to cook but my whole family loved it and I will be making it again. There is something to be said about a dinner that 3 toddlers all enjoy!

A real favorite at our house and restaurant!  I added a few more spices (salt pepper garlic powder)and make sure I melt a bit of shredded cheddar on top when I serve it - otherwise it is a keeper just as it is!

Almost too greasy to eat but the flavor is pretty good.  I used green onions instead of regular - it's all I had.  I spooned 8 tablespoons of grease off the top.  Way too much for me.  Maybe less cheeseore butter  next time and/or an added starchy  ingredient to absorb the grease.  ?

Made this this morning for breakfast.  It was quick, easy and turned out good.  I only had a 1lb pound bag of refrigerated hash browns (bob evans I think it was) so I cut everything in half and baked it in a 8x8 square pyrex.

This recipe came out great!!!  Normally when I make a recipe, I tweek it out to my liking, but I took a chance and made this recipe EXACTLY as it was and it came out phenomenal!  (That's probably b/c last time I tried to spiff it up and added Velveeta cheese and it did not come out right).  This tasted just like the Hashbrown Casserole they serve at Cracker Barrel!!!  One of the simplest recipes I've ever made!  Most definitely a keeper!!!

Really an excellent side dish. The second time I made this I added a few spoonfuls of sour cream and cooked for 35 minutes, then let it broil in the oven for another 12.  These small changes made for a better flavor and a nice golden brown, crunchy texture. Really really good!

This is pretty good. I combined one tip from another hashbrown casserole recipe. I mixed in the cheddar cheese but put some parmesan cheese on top as well. It was good and I will keep this recipe in mind for the future.

I didn't have all the ingredients at home so I had to make some slight adjustments. Took the advise of many and substituted the butter for sour cream. I didn't have the chicken soup, had to use celery with a little oxo cube...hubby says tastes just like scalloped potatoes. We loved them. Will make them again.

This is my number one go to recipe for pot lucks.  I am always asked for the recipe.  I use the Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese from Kraft instead of only Cheddar and really enjoy the flavor change.

Awesome.  Our new holiday favorite.  Accidentally put 1 lb. cheddar and added a cup of sour cream.  1/2 cup  melted butter on top is too much though.  Made it the day before and reheated in the microwave.  Works for me!

My family loves Cracker Barrel hashbrown casserole, so I was very hopeful that this would fit the bill, and it did!  I usually don't like to tweek recipes, but in this case I took the advice of one sage reveiwer and used colby cheese instead of cheddar and cut the butter in half.  I made this for Christmas brunch and the pan was scraped clean, with many compliments.  This is definitely a keeper and I can stop looking for the perfect hash brown casserole recipe!

This casserole had nice flavor.  It was a little greasy so I recommend using half the amount of butter.  If you like your hash browns with a crispy edge, this may not be the recipe for you.  I baked it for 45 additional minutes because I like my potatoes well done but still did not get the crispy crust I like.   Great with sour cream.

Like the overall flavor but too greasy for me. Next time will maybe cut down on the butter or use 2% fat cheese. Literally had to use a paper towel to soak up the excess oil.

My family enjoyed this recipe(I don't eat cheese). But I made a few changes my biggest change was using half of the butter that the recipe called for. I'm sure I will be making this again maybe with a little less chesse.

Tasted great! I think a half cup of butter was a little too much though, next time I will try 6 tablespoons instead. Added sour cream.. delicious!

Loved this recipe--it really was like the Cracker Barrel casserole.  I substituted the condensed chicken soup with condensed cream o' mushroom soup so my vegetarian guests could (and did!) enjoy it.  Also,  I think the 2 lb bag of hash browns was more appropriate for 10 servings, partly because I was also serving eggs, bacon, french toast and fruit salad, but also after I multiplied the recipe for 25 people I was preparing for.

Love this recipe!  I didn't have hash browns, so I used redskin potatoes and chopped them in my Vidalia chopper (the smallest cubes possible).  I had to cook it for about 50 minutes because of this, but it turned out great!

My picky son loved this! I used less butter, a little bit of sour cream, one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup. I mixed all the ingredients together minus the potatoes; added those last so I didn't have to "gently" mix. Wonderful recipe!

amazing! i made my own cream of chicken soup (made a very thick roux to resemble the condensed) and my own hash browns and threw in some frozen peas and it was delicious. it did however turn out very fatty- so maybe something to avoid if you are on heart attack watch.

Crazy good! I made this for dinner with ham steaks and english muffins with apricot jam. I'm sure the leftovers will be awesome as well. The onions did not get as tender as I would like. I will most likely leave them out next time.

I really wanted this to turn out like the Crackel Barrell hasbrown casserole but it's missing something. I followed the instructions 98% because I added sour cream to subsitutue the extra can of soup that others added. I think some of the fried onions on top would be delicious too. Overall a good recipe but my tastebuds were expecting more.

I've made this recipe numerous times now and it's delicious! I add sour cream to get more flavor and onions. I also add fried onions to the top to get it some crunch. My family LOVES it.

I thought this tasted Great, however I didn't follow the recipe to a T.  I had read other reviews about how it seemed dry so I added more sour cream and cream soup as well as more cheese.  Everyone Loved it and I will make again!

I loved this. I used simply potatoes.  One bag of southwestern and one bag of regular.  I also used a tablespoon of onion powder since I didn't have onion on hand.  My family loved this recipe.  Even the picky 4 year old.

This was ok.  I sauteed the onions in a little oil before I added them to the mix.  I used colby cheese to cut down on the grease factor and french fried onions to add flavor.  I eliminated the butter altogether.  I used cream of mushroom because I'm a vegetarian.  It was a pretty dry and flavorless.  If I make this again, I will definitely add another can of soup and maybe some red pepper flakes to add a little excitement.

I make these in the crockpot with no topping, so I don't use any butter at all.  I also add a bit of onion and garlic powders.  DELICIOUS.

This is one of my favorite side dishes of all time. My mom always made it when I was younger and i absolutely love it. I think it is even better the next day. I did make a few changes to suite my families tastes.....I used 1 bag of frozen hashborwns (we are a family of 3 most of the time and 4 during the summer so we didnt' need 2 bags), I left out the onion and only used about a 1/4 cup (maybe a little more) of sour cream, altho that was completely on accident. I put a nice layer of the shredded colby/monteray jack cheese on top and baked at 350 for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was perfect and there were no left overs :(.  I will make this again and again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was soo good, exactly what I had in mind for a family get together and it was the only thing that people went up for seconds, it was so good!! I added 8 oz of (fat free) sour cream and topped with with melted butter mixed with saltine crumbs.

I have made this several times , and still have not come to love this one . I have tried it as written , and also with ham , then with less onion , and still it just does not seem to taste right . Maybe with the velvetta cheese it may be better , but this is just not the Restaurant -Style Hashbrown Casserole I was looking for .

Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  This was delicious.  I didn't have the pre packaged hasbrowns on hand but I did have a package of frozen potato o'brien so I used that instead.  It turned out even more delicious than I'd predicted.  Both my picky husband and anti potato daughter loved this dish.  I will be using this again for our Easter brunch this year!  Yummm! Thanks for a great keeper.

I made this recipe with a few modifications:  I added 1 cup of sour cream, used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and baked it for an hour instead of 35 minutes. It turned out fantastic! It made a huge pan of hashbrown casserole, which I thought it would take us a week to eat. It was gone within an hour of coming out of the oven. Delicious!

Added frozen green peas along with the onion (thin strips instead of chopped), and skipped the cheddar cheese. Used a little less cream of chicken soup and sprinkled with real bacon bits. Smelled great while cooking and tasted even better! Thanks!

Great Recipe! I added some garlic and milk to the mixture. I might add chives and/or mushrooms next time. Bacon might be good also. I also baked it at about 400.

Wow!  Absolutely delicious.  Following other reviews, I added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  And I used Golden Cream of Mushroom soup.  While mixing the ingredients, I was concerned about the mixture being too dry.  But, in the end, everything was fine.  Enjoy!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  My mom has made this for years but can not keep up with her recipes so we finally found something that tastes exactly the same.  I did what one reviewer said and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup chicken stock and my family preferred it with the additions.  I beleive they would eat this every night if I would make it.  Thanks for submitting.

This was a good recipe, I made it for a Christmas brunch and had to double the recipe.  I would recommend melting the butter and putting it in last, I broke a spoon trying to reach the butter at the bottom of the bowl!  Don't add any salt! It was salty enough without adding more.  I also added 16 oz of sour cream (for the double recipe) which made it creamy.  Overall, it was very good.

It was very good, but probably not the best I've ever had.. but I'm also more critical of my own cooking that anyone else's. I added a few too many onions, so stick with the recipe. Overall very easy and tastey.

Added minced garlic.  Husband and son raved about it, and when I sent some to my neighbor she said this was definitely a keeper!  Very rich, but worth the calories.

Oh. my. goodness. I made this for a brunch I attended, and boy, it was a hit. I ate the rest of it for dinner, and then again the next morning :) Seriously, delicious. I always wondered how a certain restaurant chain got their hashbrowns to taste so good. Little did I know, that I had the ingredients already in my pantry! Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing. **Update - The onions don't quite cook all the way through, so I've ended up sauteeing them in the butter to ensure that they cook entirely - it tones them down a bit for the kids, and now they don't even know that they're in there!

I only had cream of celery soup on hand, and some great left over ham. So I mixed the potatoes (still frozen), chopped onions, sour cream and tons of cheese and chopped ham together, then put one hafl the mixture in the baking dish, then some left over cooked spinage, then another layer of the mixture. Extra cheese on top, then a bit melted butter and bread crumbs...it was a great meal with a tossed salad. My husband is a meat eater and he especially loved it this way.

Turned out wonderful, so much easier than trying to mash potatoes when you have guests, make this dish instead!

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it a few times, and it always comes out great. I even made it ahead of time for a potluck I wasnt going to be able to attend, and just gave my husband the directions. I make a few changes when I make it. It is good with either cream of chicken or cream of mushroom (I always use the 98% fat free - there is more than enough fat in the butter that I dont feel the need to add even more!)I use probably a cup of onion, but my family really likes the onion flavor, if you dont like a strong onion flavor stick to 1/2 or even 1/4 of a cup. I also throw in some ham, or bacon and even some green pepper from time to time, the flavor is wonderful. I actually do NOT recommend letting the hash browns completely thaw because then the casserole can end up too mushy. I actually let them thaw enough so that it all breaks apart, and mix the potatoes onions, cheese and anything else like peppers or ham I am using together in a really big bowl. Then I add the soup and once that is well mixed drizzle the butter over everything stir well. The butter will solidify because the potatoes will still be cold. Bake it for about 45 min at 350 and it comes out perfect. Rich and creamy but the hashbrowns still hold their form and havent turned to mush!

This was just ok for me, husband liked it, one son said he would rather have a box style type. I did use the advice of Angie and added a can of condensed cheddar cheese and a cup of sour cream and sprinkled the top with some bacon.

I made some changes but this was a great guide. First thing I did was brown a tube of breakfast sausage and put it in a bowl. Added in, I used one can cream of chicken and one can condensed cheddar cheese. Mixed this together with 1 cup of sour cream, 1 stick of softened butter, and a package of simply potatoes. Added in some pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and about 1 cup of shredded four cheese mix (Kraft blend). Mixed it all up, and smoothed out in a very well greased glass baking dish. Poured more cheese on top, a few dollups of melted butter and it's in the oven. DELICIOUS! A few sprinkles of crispy bacon on top when it's done would be divine!

My entire family loved this!  Even the kids.  I used country style hashbrowns (little potato chunks), used 1/2 the butter and added crunched up corn flakes mixed w/ a little butter to the top 1/2 way through cooking.  Next time I will saute the onions in butter first.

This was very delicious!! It was greasy though so next time I will cut back on the amount of butter... maybe do a 1/4 of a stick of butter. I also decided to add about 2 oz of softened cream cheese to the recipe... very good!! I will be making this again!!!

Not at all what I was expecting. Either it was the brand I used which was Schwan's (do not buy that brand yuck!!!) or it was the combo of chicken soup. I'm not real sure but I will not be making this again. My kids didn't like it and my husband well he just didn't eat it. Sorry to be harsh.

I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it, but felt I should have baked it longer.  The potatoes, though thawed, didn't seem quite done.  Great taste, though!

this was my third time making this and i realized thawing my hashbrowns was VERY important.  i used hashbrowns straight from the grocery store freezer so i put them in the large mixing bowl in the microwave for about 6 minutes, mixing a couple times.  added melted butter, salt, pepper, 16 oz. of sour cream, tony sasheries seasoning, onion powder, 2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese, and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  omiting the onions.  once almost baked, i topped with 1 cup cheese and baked another 5 minutes til melted.  turned out REALLY good!

This was very good! I sauteed the onions before adding them to the bowl because they always ended up still being a bit crunchy if put in raw. I also added more cheese, we are big on cheese in this house! This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

No doubt, this recipe would have been wonderful had I followed it as written. But I wanted the casserole to be more substantial, as a full meal, so I browned 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger and added it to the mix. With the extra "dry" ingredient (hamburger), I also added 8 ounces of sour cream and another can of cream of chicken soup. It turned out spectacular and I highly recommend it.

I would give this 4.5 stars. I prepared this dish using 1/4 cup butter and no salt and a little sour cream (on the advice of a different reviewer who stated it was too salty). I didn't find it too salty at all (although unfortunately I like salt). I think I would prepare it the same next time, but add a little seasoning salt. Also, I think a little more cooking time wouldn't hurt either.

Awesome!!! Our guests could not get enough of this, it was totally the hit of the dinner! I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken as I'm a vegetarian. It worked great!

Simple, easy, and tastes wonderful!

I made this for our Christmas dinner and it was wonderful! It tastes like Cracker Barrell! And that's nice because we don't have one close to where we are living. I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken and used colby jack cheese. It's even good today as leftovers.

Super good and easy!  I did not have sausage and used bacon instead.  I am not a fan of breakfast type baked stuff because they are too "eggy" for me.  But this is perfect - I really liked it and even the picky two year old had some!  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this several times and it is always a crowd pleaser - especially the men and kids. I've found that any "cream of" soup works well, except cream of celery. I also like to cook it halfway, give it a stir, and add the cornflakes and butter topping suggested by other reviewers. Wonderful! If this accompanies burgers or other grilled foods, I use season salt, if it's a more traditional/comfort meal, I'll use regular salt.

I used 8 oz of sour cream and reduced the butter to 2 TBS and then added green onion and crushed corn flakes to the top.  Overall it was pretty good, although next time I think I may use slightly less sour cream, as the flavor was very evident.

I found this to be a fairly good recipe.  After reading many of the other reviews already posted, I went ahead and cut back on the butter to 1/4 cup.  Other changes I made were to add milk, sour cream, more onion, more cheese, garlic salt in place of regular salt, and parsley to mine.  By using unsalted butter and fat free/low sodium soup I was able to keep the sodium content low even after adding the garlic salt.  I would make this again, but will continue to experiment with it a bit - maybe change out the soup flavor, use a different cheese such as swiss or mexican blend.  I am also going to try adding some vegetables and meat to the recipe to make it a full meal - such as bacon or ham or chicken and broccoli.

I love this recipe.  The first time I made it, I followed exactly and it was good.  The last time I made it, I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, sauteed the onion in butter, and used about 2-1/2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese - it was awesome!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Great taste, VERY similar to Cracker Barrel's casserole.  Next time, I will definitely cut the butter back, as my casserole was swimming in butter.  Other than that, delish!  Thanks for posting this!

Very good - I did make some modifications after reading the reviews.  I've made this recipe several times and the best thing I did was to half the amount of butter.  You could probably even try a little less than that, but I didn't want to skip the butter entirely.

I also use dried onion flakes for convenience.  I've used cream of chicken in the past, but the last time I used cream of celery because it was what I had in the house.  Still turned out wonderful.

I really did not like this. I have had other hashbrown recipes I liked so much better. No sour cream in this or cream cheese which may have helped. Will not make again.

These were good but I used the displayed raters changes and added sour cream (16 oz. and about a tablespoon of milk). It was good but I wonder if the sour cream & milk kept the potatoes from getting crispy, which is how I like my hash browns. I also cooked it at 400 degrees with tinfoil covering it for the first 30 minutes then put crunched up corn flakes * melted butter on top and left it uncovered the last 10 minutes. Next time I will either use 8 oz. or no sour cream at all, depending how risky I feel. I wish the potatoes had browned, they really didn't at all but I think thats due to my changes. Otherwise, this was delicious!! By the way, I only used 1/8 a cup of chopped onion, as I don't really like onions  and I'm glad I did because you could definitely taste them even with such a small amount. Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

This is a good recipe. I prefer my mom's recipe instead though, which doesn't use butter at all. Instead 8oz of sour cream, garlic salt, 1 onion/2bl minced onion, and paprika on top.

I make this all the time for pitch ins.  It is always requested of me now.  I place the thawed hashbrowns in the dish and sprinkle with cracked black pepper.  Then I mix up the remaining ingredients except for cheese, however, I also add 8oz of sour cream.  This makes it in my opinion.  Then I spread that on top and then top with the cheese and bake.

Wonderful recipe!  It came out a little greasy from the butter so I wont use as much next time.  I liked that much onion but my kids didn't so I won't use as much next time.  But what a great dish!

I used all low fat/fat free ingredients and this dish still turned out well. I didn't have the onion I thought I had, so I had to use dried onion flakes. I cooked mine for about 45 minutes and it never browned like I thought it would. Next time, I'll put it under the broiler for the last minute or so.

My husband and roommate have asked me again and again to make this recipe! I loved this dish it`s so easy to make and fills those hungry men!
I did make one change as suggested, less sour cream. I also changed the corn flakes to crushed Ritz crackers.... I am a huge baby and it hurts my hands to crush up corn flakes, and I had the Ritz in the cupboard already :)
It turned out VERY yummy with the Ritz!

I made this last night for dinner. Changes by me were- defrosted 1 lb-14oz Ore-Ida Hashbrowns, 1/4c green peppers, 3c sharp cheddar cheese, Really thick ham cut into bite size pieces (3c).  Mix this (and all others in list) all toghether and bake at 350 degrees and broil the top to toast it. Plenty for 2 adults and 3 year old and lots of leftovers.

Great recipe!! Was a little too cheesy, but I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of mild.  Used a little less butter than required as others had suggested and it was a huge hit at a big dinner party!  No leftovers!

It definitely does not need the butter, the cheese makes it oily enough and the butter just sat on top and made it greasy. Probably would have been good if I would've left out the butter or at least cut in down to 1/3 of what it called for. I make it regularly now without the butter, and use low fat or fat free sour cream, YUMMO!

this was a hit at our house!  It does remind you of the cracker barrel hashbrown casserole.  It went very fast.... I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe has really good flavor.  I peeled and shredded my own potatoes, other that I followed the recipe exactly.  I really don't think whoever posted that picture did.  It is too fluffy and dry, very decieving compared to what mine looked like.  My husband and I just stared at it for a little while wondering if we were going to eat it.  It was just this casserole floating in butter...literally!!  I suggest using less butter.  When the cheese melts it is already going to be greasy, so there is no need for all of that.  Other than that the flavor was still good.  I read another review where someone broiled it for a few minutes to make it crunchy on top, that sounds really good.

Once again, a huge hit. I made a quadruple batch and kept them warm in a crock pot since I needed my oven for stratas.

I like mine a little browned and crispy on top so I let them cook as long as possible.

The flavor was good (my husband liked it better than I did) but it was not done cooking after 40 minutes.  I ended up taking it out of the oven and zapping it in the microwave to finish cooking it so that I could serve it with dinner.

Good recipe, but WAY, WAY, WAY, too many onions. In fact, I'm going to try it without onions at all next time- I don't think they belong. I was looking for Cracker-barrel like recipe, and don't believe they use any. The onion taste was just incredibly overpowering, and I didn't even use an entire 1/2 cup! Otherwise quite tasty.

This was delicious.  I used 'I Can't Believe it's not Butter'for the butter portion and added 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. It wasn't "greasy" at all.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and broiled it 5 more minutes to get a little crunch & crisp to the top. Yummmm

My husband loved this, but for me it was too much onions. Still really good though - just not my favorite. It will go in with the keepers though, as he ate thirds.

This is really good! I use healthy request crm of chix soup, 2% ched cheese and I add 1 c fat free sour cream to mixture & 5 tbl of milk (it seems dry w/out it) and use only a 1/4 c light butter. You cut calories 1/4 and it is still YUMMY!
(you could cut calories more by omitting sour cream, but it will be a lot drier) Actually the 'Hashbrown Casserole" recipe on this website is far superior to this one!

This went over quite nicely with the family.  I did not have cheddar cheese so I used Mozzarella.  I would cut down on the butter next time and wish I would have read the reviews because it is not necessary to use so much.

I added sauteed green peppers and onion.  Along with half a can Cream of Celery, 1/2 c. sour cream, little milk, and the cork flake topping.  My family liked it very much.  Even though there are six of us, it makes a lot.  Better to have for a gathering.

I served this at a potluck, separating the potatoes from the other ingredients (which I combined over medium-low heat on the stove until the cheese melted); the potatoes I cooked in a skillet with the 2 tbsp butter.  *I separated them because I wanted to give people the option to add the cheese sauce or leave it out.  It was a big hit - at least six people asked me for the recipe.

I made this, and it turned out very well.
I used the refrigerated hash browns, not frozen. I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.
Very good. I am planning to make this for a Christmas Eve dinner.

I made this for a work Christmas party. I used only 1 1/2 pounds of hashbrowns, 2 would have been way too much! I also thought it probably needed a little more cream of chicken soup and cheese. It was a little dry, but overall pretty good.

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken and it came out perfect.  I also used diced potatoes instead of shredded potatoes.  I will definitely be making this over and over again!

So easy & good, too.  I added French Onion dip since I read a review that this might be a bit dry.  It was very good.

Made this for a bunch of bikers and hardcore crazy people. Got home after the party not much of it was left. I have made this for my family and they all loved it, even my youngest who will not eat onions.
Tried crushed cornflakes on top during the baking, turned out really good. Have also tried bread crumbs, these work and taste good also.

Thought this recipe was fantastic only I like mine a bit more "soupy".  I added about a 1/2 cup or so of sour cream, garlic and extra pepper.  So, so good!  I'll be making this a bunch!

This recipe is so good! My friends call it "Heavenly Hashbrowns". I add a tub of sour cream to the mixture (the size you make dip out of), and generally use mild cheddar cheese.  Yummy!!

I made it for a birthday party at work.  Everyone raved about it.  I thought it was a little too soupy - I like my hashbrowns crispy, but don't go by me, go by the 10 people that asked for the recipe.  I used fresh potatoes, because I am a glutten for punishment, and made it the night before and cooked it in the morning.

I used 1/3 cup of margarine instead of 1/2 cup.  Maybe the reason it was so greasy is because I used margarine instead of butter.  This dish was so greasy that when it first came from the oven, the greased drained right off the potatoes.  Yuck, bad first impression.  This did taste pretty good.  Of course, I'm the only one in my family to like it.  I don't think I'll make this again.

I have been making this recipe for several years.  The only thing I do different is instead of salt, I use garlic salt.  I also use 8 oz's sour cream.  I think it cuts some of the saltiness and it gives it a creamier texture.  Very good and I get lots of request for this recipe.

This was so easy to make! Yum! I added some parsley to give it some more flavor.

This is so good.  I now know what I'm bringing to my job for the annual meeting.  I used italian cheese blend, since I didn't have cheddar.  I added garlic powder and sliced up some smoked sausage.  I did half the amount of butter.  This will be good with some fried eggs in the morning.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is great!  I use the o'brien-style potatoes and leave out the onion, and it's still great.  I sometimes add cubed ham for a complete meal, or substitue cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken.  Any way I fix it, it always goes fast at our table.  The leftovers are even better!

I made this recipe for a breakfast potluck at work.  I doubled the original recipe and substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken.  I also topped it with chopped green onions when finished.  It looked great and everyone raved about it.  I also made it for my husband at home and he liked it as well.  Definitely a keeper.

This was very yummy!  Very close to the flavor of Cracker Barrel's.  I kept having to double-check the recipe to make sure I didn't have to pre-fry the hashbrowns!  I was skeptical that not frying them would result in a bland dish, but I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it turned out!  Also, I used cream of celery soup as I'm a vegetarian, and it turned out wonderfully.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicious and I recommend it.  I used cream of mushroom soup and added a second can to make the recipe creamier.  It was wonderful.
