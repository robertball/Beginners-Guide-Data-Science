I substitute chopped artichoke hearts (frozen or canned) for the mushrooms, and reduced fat shredded mozzarella for the feta. I love the suggestion of adding capers so I put in about a tablespoon. I use about half a lemon's worth of juice and omit the dill. Will also try it with brown rice for a healthier whole grain.

I found this to be a delightful accompaniment. I prepared it with more lemons, and added capers (for that bit of extra lemony zing). Although I like mushrooms, I really felt that they should have been left out of the recipe. They just seemed to get in the way. I will fix this dish many times.

Really good, we enjoyed this!  I didn't do the final oven thing, I just covered it on the stovetop on low simmer for about 25 minutes, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely have this again!  Thank you.

Wanted to add that we serve this with the Chicken Souvlaki Gyro recipe found on Allrecipes--excellent!

My husband didn't like this, but I loved it! The lemon, spinach, and feta reminded me of dishes served a a local Greek festival each year. I was a little skeptical and thought this might need some sort of sauce, but it really doesn't. This is a lighter, refreshing side dish.

Wonderful!  I also substituted artichoke hearts for the mushrooms.  Using about 2 cups fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen works well too.  The dill makes this a great compliment to broiled, baked, or grilled fish, but the spinach and feta make it a good side dish for lamb or pork as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good! Followed recipe except I omitted spinach.  Everyone loved it!  I think the spinach would have been perfect in this dish, but I didn't have any on hand.

This was an easy, tasty and healthy recipe that everyone in my family loved when I served it with Christmas dinner. I decreased the healthiness a bit though, by adding about a 1/2 cup of shredded monterey jack cheese to give it a little more flavor and richness

I liked this recipe--I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it turned out great.  The tastes are quite adult (read: your kids might not touch it), but I thought that the capers were a really yummy addition.  I was out of dill so I substituted tarragon.

I was looking for a last minute recipe with rice.  I found this, had all the ingredients on hand except the dill.  I added a little julienne zucchini.  Also left it on the stove to cook.  It turned out fabulous!  We will definitely make again.

This was amazing. I left out the onions and garlic and added a few extra dashes of lemon juice to taste AND a can of tuna. It had this amazing just lemon enough aftertaste that kept making me want to go get more. The tuna really added to it. So good. I will make it again.

This dish was okay, but kind of boring. I had to use a ton of feta to get some flavor.  Then I added some Frank's Red Hot sauce and it was great!

I decreased the rice to 2 cups, increased the spinach to a 16 oz bag and increased the lemon juice to the juice of one whole lemon. Yummy and light. Served it along side grilled lemon pepper lamb chops. Paired wonderfully.

Good flavor, but I ended up adding way more lemon juice than was called for because it was so dry. I also used feta with herbs and added more of that also.

Good recipe.  Goes excellent with the  Sauced Cod Fish recipe found elsewhere on Allrecipe.   I had no mushrooms and substituted Locatelli cheese.    Made for a "rave" meal.

enjoyed this - I didn't have any dill, so I omitted it. Very easy to make and it isn't too heavy. It went very well with grilled chicken and some sliced tomatoes. I will definitely make this again!
