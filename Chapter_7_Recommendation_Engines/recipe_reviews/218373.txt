I don't think it can get much better than this! I can't quit eating it! I put all the salty snacks in the bark and none on top because I didn't think the potato chips would stay crsip being exposed to the air. I hope there is some left for my husband when he gets home, lol.

This was absolutely wonderful;  so easy and quick; great for those of us who like dark chocolate and salty tastes combined.

This was really good!! it was a great combination of salty and sweet. I made it for a party at church and everyone loved it. The only change i made was to substitute milk chocolate chips for half of the dark chocolate chips. I did this because i know a lot of people who don't like dark chocolate. But overall it was a really good recipe!! :)
