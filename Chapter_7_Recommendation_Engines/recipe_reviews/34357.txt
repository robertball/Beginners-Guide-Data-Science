Absolutely delicious!
I started to cook at 6:45 and i was done by 7:30.  The only thing I changed was I added a layer of refried beans mixed with salsa and a layer of reduced fat mexican cheese blend. So it went tortilla, refried bean mix, riccotta cheese mix, meat, sprinkle cheese. Then on the very top I put another layer of riccotta and then sprinkled the cheese. I served it with fat free tortilla chips and corn. My husband hates beans and mexican but he cleaned his plate.  He couldn't figure out what the bean layer was - he just liked the creamy taste - Great recipe

This really is a delicious and versatile recipe.  This is the 3rd time I've made it now and this is how we've decided we like it best: 2 10 inch tortillas & then 1 halved tortilla on each side (straight side to the edge of the pan).  

Half the meat mixture (2 lb ground turkey, diced yellow onion, taco seasoning, 1 14.5 can diced tomatoes & 1 can rotele), 2 cups shredded monterey/colby.  Another layer of tortillas.  Next is the ricotta with 1 egg and 1 4 oz can chilies whipped together and a can of corn over the top.  Another layer of tortillas.  Rest of meat with 2 small cans sliced black olives.  Another layer of tortillas.  8 oz sour cream + 8 oz salsa mixed over the top of that, topped with 2 cups of mexi-cheese and sliced green onions on top.  Bake as directed.  This makes enough to feed myself and 3 growing boys with plenty to take into work to share.  Thanks so much for the ideas and the recipe!

This was very yummy and the kids loved it! I did change a few things though, I used corn tortillas instead of flour, I decreased the water to about 1/2 cup, and I added pepper, chili powder, and some other spices to the ricotta. I also added cheese (a combination of cheddar and monterey jack) to the layers and on top. Very yummy!! This made enough for 3 meals for my family, so I froze the extra helpings.

Great recipe.  This is what a "lasagna" is supposed to be--all the others are just meat and noodles.  The ricotta makes it a nice blend of Italian and Mexican.  I finished the top with some shredded Monterey Jack cheese and black olives.  Everyone loved it, even a rather picky 9 year old.  Also a good recipe to use up leftovers--you can add pinto or black beans, sweet corn or extra salsa--it's a very forgiving dish

Oh my Goodness!!  This recipe is AWESOME!  And I don't even really LIKE Mexican food so much...I used half a packet of taco seasoning and added some cumin, chili powder and red and black pepper, with a can of garlic-and-onion-diced-tomatoes, half a can of mushrooms, and the green onions all simmered w/ the ground turkey for about half an hour...I also used enchilada sauce, spooning a little on the bottom of the pan first, then layered as the recipe directed, using cottage chz instead of ricotta, topping off w/ the rest of the enchilada sauce and just a little sprinkling of shredded mozzarella and shredded cheddar.  I covered this with foil for most of the bake time, uncovering the last 10 mins...Mmmm!  Wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!! :)

I totally changed this recipe.The changes I made were.... I toasted my tortillas until golden brown, used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (diced tomatoes and chiles), added cumin, paprika, pepper and garlic powder to the ricotta and no water! My husband loved it and I had seconds but I still think it needs something. Next time I will add tomato paste to the meat mix.

Great recipe, I also changed it a bit.  The most wonderful change was mashing up an avocado into the ricotta.  Turned out a fantastic light green color.

Changes I made: Added avocado to the ricotta, No water, Mixed refried black beans and salsa as a layer on its own, Chopped red peppers into the meat mixture while roasting, Added layers of sliced cheddar.

I've made this several times and will make it many, many, more times - consider it a staple! First, if you're using flour tortillas, take the time while prepping the other ingredients to toast the tortillas just for a few minutes. I always make enough for leftovers the next day and this seemed to be a good solution for the sogginess. I added black beans to the meat mixture and only drained them a little so i didn't need the 2 cups of water after that. I usually cut the taco seasoning to only 1/2 a packet. I usually don't keep green chili peppers on hand so i substitute chopped green onion or fresh chives. Only 4 stars, since there were modifications but still a keeper. Delish!

Imade last night. My very picky husband said "smells good, never had this before" good thing I said. "I never made it before either" after he said that he was my guinne pig, he devoured 2 large helpings. I must say that this was very good and soooo easy. One thing I did do was let it rest out of the oven for 5 min. after cooking and it held together nicely.

I love Mexican lasagna but I make it slightly different. Instead of the Rotel and the diced tomatoes I use my favorite salsa. Ricotta and eggs aren't necessary either. Try using a layer of sour cream. Top with beef mixture (ground beef is what my family likes) and top that with a layer of Mexican cheese blend or cheddar. It's much better and actually tastes Mexican. Layer the top with salsa and cheese and when it's done cooking sprinkle with cilantro or green onion.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I used a fresh jalapeno with a little chicken broth instead of the can of green chile peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm sorry, but this just did not work for me.  Ricotta cheese and mexican just don't go together.  I tried it, thinking it would be one of those weird combinations that would just 'zing'. But it didn't. I think, if you make this, you should omit the ricotta and eggs and substitute layering some type of mexican cheese in it's place.  Possibly mix the mexican cheese with the sour cream and salsa and use it as a layer.  Also, you need to spread a little of the meat mixture on the bottom of the dish before beginning your layers.  Otherwise, your bottom tortillas will be crunchy and hard, and the others will be soft.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!! I listened to the suggestion of many reviewers and omitted water from the recipe I also added refried beans YUMMMMM! The beans are a little tough to spread around especially when there is other stuff underneath so I added a splash of chicken broth to them so it would be eaiser to spread around. I also added a little adobo to the turkey while it cooked. 

I hardly ever make the same thing twice in week but my husband begged me to make another one two days later so I made him one. After dinner I fell asleep  and the next morning I couldn't find the leftovers anywhere. HE ATE THE WHOLE THING!!

I loved this basic recipe idea. I changed it quite a bit though. Without alterations, this recipe lacks the 'kick' I look to Mexican food for. I took the advise of many previous reviews. First, I mixed salsa with refried beans and sread it over the tortilla as the bottom layer. here you add quite a lot of flavor and can vary it in spicyness depending on the salsa heat level you use. Second, I used two lbs of ground turkey, I like more meat. Third, I added chilli powder, paprika, amd cumin to the ricotta cheese. Lastly I added a mexican blend shredded cheese as the last layer in each section and on the top of the final product. Topped it with a dollop of sour cream, more salsa, and chopped avacado.

One more great thing about this recipe... it was better as a leftover. I recommend making it the day before and heating up individual pieces in the microwave. Serve over a bed of lettuce and dress with whatever you like on top (other suggestions to  try: jalapenoes, black bean and corn mix, or enchilada sauce)

I used ground beef, yellow onion, 1/4 water, no greed chilies, no ricotta.  Looks like I made my own recipe:)  I put my onions in with my ground beef as I browned it.  I added 1/4 water with my taco seasoning then added my tomatoes.  I warmed the flour tortillas, put a layer on greased cake pan, then dollops of sour cream and spread it out.  then the meat mixture.  I then put a layer of corn/Bushes black beans mixture, then a layer of shreaded cheese.  I repeated once, baked at 400 for 30 min then broiled for a short time to brown the top.  Loved this recipe and my mods:)

The flavor of this dish was just okay. I had some issues with this recipe. I always like to follow a recipe and review it as it has been submitted. Some people make so many changes it isn't the same recipe anymore. That having been said, I wouldn't recommend this recipe. The meat mixture was very watery and when it came time to serve, the bottom two tortillas stuck to the pan. Some type of topping would have been nice too- Cheese or something. All in all, it wasn't bad, just not good enough to make again.

This is very simple and sooo good. My family and friends request this one a lot. I substitute ground beef. Also, I only use about a cup of water instead of two. Try it...   you will not be disappointed.

I enjoyed this, although it was my gotta use up leftovers in the fridge meal, so I didn't exactly adhere to the recipe. I used corn tortillas soaked in some chicken broth because I find that making a casserole out of flour just gets them too soggy. I picked this recipe to use the ricotta and I'm not sure I enjoyed it in there...it seemed out of place, but again, since I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I'm going to rate on what it would have been, rather than what it was. I added refried beans which competed with the ricotta. Next time I'll use one or the other. Also added some left over fried rice, some fresh garden veggies and the tomatoes and salsa were home canned...like I said...a leftover casserole night. Thanks for the idea!!!

I did not care for this recipe. I made this recipe for my father on his birthday because he said he wanted mexican or italian food. I added the two eggs with a little hesitation to the ricotta. May I say, my gut instincts were right. The two eggs made the whole dish come out like a mexican quiche. I absolutely HATE the texture of eggs, especially in a mexican dish! This recipe would be much better if you just left the eggs out completely. I am not sure who in their right mind rated this dish with even more than one star. I made it again another night, but used cream cheese instead of ricotta and no eggs. Delicious. This recipe should be removed so it doesn't fool anyone else.

Yum!  I have made this several times and we love it!  Used ground turkey, corn tortillas, and added refried beans as a layer as others have suggested.  Great as leftovers for lunches too!

Very high in carbs and had to double the meat but it tasted good. A unique combination of flavors but it still left me longing for more flavor. For us it'll stay on the once every 6-9 months list.

I thought this was a very  Yummy dish! I used Taco flavored ground turkey and did not use the 2 cups of water. I also added Black beans drained and rinsed and Black Olives, garlic salt and pepper to taste into my meat mixture. I added extra cheese and garlic salt and a pinch of salt and a big dash of pepper in with the eggs and ricotta. I used cooking spray in my glass baking dish before I started to layer things. The bottom layer was nice and crispy. I would make this dish again.

This is a very forgiving recipe you can tailor to your own tastes/needs.  There doesn't seem to be any taco seasoning on the market that doesn't have spices or natural/artificial flavors, so I sauteed the ground turkey with Texas ranch that doesn't use corn, gluten, artificial/natural, MSG, spices, etc. I cut up fresh tomatoes, omitted the eggs and used pepperjack instead of ricotta. Used a 9x3" casserole dish and cut 4 tortillas in half and placed them so that the straight edge was on the outside.  Next time I will use more tortillas, because it left a gap at the top and bottom.  Quick and easy - kids said it tasted like nachos.  Score!

This was very strange. There was too much egg, so it reminded me of Migas (a Mexican breakfast dish). The 2 cups of water is unnecessary, it just made the tortillas soggy. Apparently my tortillas were too big, because I could only fit 4, and there was too much cheese mixture in relation to the amount of meat. I skipped the sour cream and salsa, because I wasn't sure what the point of it was, other than extra calories. Probably won't make this again.

This was good. I used a beef/turkey blend. I also added a bag of southwest corn, and since I live in Wisconsin, some shredded Mexican cheese to top it all off. I'll make this again.

I give this a 3 star.  It wasn't awesome, but just ok.  All the ingredients sound very tasty together but something got missed with this recipe.  It was terribly dry without the sour cream/salsa mix too.  Not sure if I will be making this again.

There wasn't too much liquid in this (think of how much you use when adding seasoning packets to ground meat!) and it was a huge hit at our house. I did add refried beans because I'm into them. It was better than I expected.

My family loves this! We eat a lot of Southwestern food, and this is a cool, different way to use tortillas. I have cooked it with ground turkey, beans, and lentils, and they're all good. (Precook the beans/lentils and then start the recipe where you stir in taco seasoning.) I usually skip the green onions and the sour cream/salsa dip step. Instead, I sprinkle with shredded cheddar after it comes out of the oven or serve with sour cream. Note: If you try this as a freezer meal, use corn tortillas instead of flour. The flour tortillas become very soggy after being defrosted. Enjoy!

When I first read this recipe, my gut instinct told me NOT to use flour tortillas.  But since most people thought that it was tasty with the flour tortillas, I went ahead and tried it.  I should have followed my first instinct.  They were very soggy even though I cut the water down to 1 cup instead of using 2 cups.  Bingading was right.... the ricotta didn't hold up very well..... On the other hand, it was tasty and I will make it again just with a few modifications.  I will definitley use corn tortillas next time. The sour cream/salsa mixture was really good; I just put in a little more salsa than it called for.  All in all a good go-to recipe!

Not too bad of a recipe. I did change some things. Instead of using flour tortillas I used corn. I just didn't think flour tortillas would add enough flavor. If I make this again I think I will add refried beans, olives, and another type of cheese. The ricotta didn't hold up very well.

It was very tastey and we will make this a part of our meal choice from now on.  We did have to make slight adjustments on the meat.  We used 2 lbs. of turkey because we did not know wha to do with the rest (we buy 1lb. tubes like sausage) and thus additional seasoning such as granulated garlic, black pepper, and chili powder were added.  I am probably slow but I did not see the point with the side combination of salsa and sour cream.

Delicious! I eliminated the ricotta cheese and added scattered tsps. of sour cream on 2 layers. Topped it with tex-mex cheese. We are vegetarian so I used soy crumbles, made this dish for meat eating guests and they all loved it! A keeper!

Wow this was a great recipe along with easy and fast.  I revised it using ground beef, added chili powder; salt; pepper; granulated garlic powder; cup water (used water from rinsing cans); 1 egg with ricotta cheese and green chili mixture; adding 1 can rotele with diced tomatoes; 2 (10-inch) tortillas per layer, halved tortilla on each side (straight side to the edge of the pan).  I did not use the sour cream or salsa in recipe, instead I served on the side with corn.  My family really liked this.  I'm planning on making it for Super Bowl Sunday, and emailing my recipe version to my daughter and sisters to make for their families.  Thanx so much for sharing.

I made this for my boyfriend and I the other night, and while I am still impressed with the idea, some tweaking needs to be done. 

The Ricotta didn't go over well AT ALL. My boyfriend said it generally ruined the whole dish, not really fitting in with any of the Mexican flavors and being this dense layer in the middle. I don't know what I'd replace it with -- guac, maybe? I didn't care for it either. Also, maybe it was the fact that I used 93/7 lean turkey, but there was no flavor to it, even with the taco seasoning that we love. I would use beef or pork next time.

Not worth making in my opinion.  I felt like I had to add a ton of veggies/seasonings in order to make it at all tasty and worth the effort. I added seasoning from a Mexican chicken casserole recipe I had in the cupboard, re-fried beans, corn (It's basically a whole new recipe).  It was definitely edible after the extra effort! Yet, the ricotta ruined it..and it was too runny.  Sigh*

I made this last night, and it was great! My husband had two huge pieces, and said it was definitely a keeper. I did make a few adjustments though: - Sauteed some minced garlic in the skillet with a little olive oil before adding the ground turkey - Added some paprika, onion powder, pepper and cumin to the ground turkey while it was in the skillet -I omitted the green onions, because my husband won’t eat them.   -Instead of the can of tomatoes and can of chilis, I added two cans of Rotel with chilis. Because this was a little more than the recipe called for, and was undrained, I only added about ½ cup of water instead of the 2 cups the original recipes calls for. This was the right move, because it was just saucey enough. More water would have turned it into a soupy mess.  - I used half part-skim ricotta and half low-fat cottage cheese, to cut down on calories. - And like others had mentioned, I spread the 8 tortillas on a baking sheet and put them in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes while getting the other ingredients ready. This made them nice and baked without being too dry. - Finally, I also added some shredded Mexican cheese to the very top of the lasagna, along with some jalapeno slices. Delicious!!   Next time, I might try adding some corn and black beans to the meat mixture, to give it some added veggie substance.

This was easy to make and quite good. I added a can of rotel with lime and cilantro to my meat and also added some of the taco seasoning to the ricotta mixture. Next time I'll add black beans and corn. My kids ate it so I was pleased. I didn't use as much water as called for, just eyeballed it and didn't use the onions either.

This recipe is truly amazing!  Of course, I did some variations.  I browned about half of the turkey weight with onions and added zucchini but still used the full taco season packet.  My husband couldn't stop raving about this.  It has a permanent spot on our menu.  Don't skip the salsa cream.  I also used yellow corn tortillas because they were the only thing on hand and I think they helped make this dish.  Happy cooking!

This is an awesome dish and super easy. I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand but I have know doubt it would be delicious as written (except for the water I would take this out completely).  Mine was really runny and I didn't add any water just the juice from the tomatoes. An added plus was my 5 and 2 year old loved it. The changes I made were sour cream instead of ricotta, no eggs, I added a layer of black beans (drained), and 1 can of Mexicorn instead of the green chiles because I didn't have any and last I used whole wheat tortillas. Really good!!!!

This was good but I did adjust the amount of taco seasoning (I thought it might be too much because I did not have quite 1.5 lbs. of meat). The rest of the family (picky guy and 4 yr old) really enjoyed it. We will make again.

This was a wonderful, easy, quick recipe! The only change I made was to use Gimme Lean meat substitute instead of turkey. I used whole wheat flour tortillas, and I thought they soaked up the juices well without getting too soggy. I also added shredded pepper jack cheese to the top (to me, casseroles like this always need SOMETHING on top). This recipe is definitely a winner, and I'll be making it again!

I realize I am the minority here, but I didn't care for the ricotta in this recipe.  DH thought it was tasty, so that is good!

Wow, this was great -- a real hit at my house.  I followed the suggestions of a couple other reviewers and added refried beans to the layers and sliced black olives on the top.  Also, since we're on diets here I used lowfat cottage cheese and eggbeaters instead of ricotta and egg and the lasagna still came out tasting rich and good.

My family loved this-husband said best recipe I have made in a long time. Did a couple things different-added a layer of refried beans(family likes them) and added a mexican blend shredded cheese to the ricotta mixture, and some on top. Put some salsa on the bottom of dish, so it would not stick. Also used ground chicken(what I had on hand). Thanks for the great basic recipe, so many things you could do with this!

Wow, dare I say this is even better than Italian lasagna? I made it with ground pork (excellent) and to solve the debate once and for all about the water, simply use the LARGE can of tomatoes (28 oz) instead of the 14-1/2 oz size. (Who buys that scrawny size anyway!) and just leave out the water altogether, you won't need it with the bigger can of tomatoes. I also did what others suggested and added a can of beans for more nutrients and definitely add some shredded Mexican cheese on top before baking. Bake some corn muffins to go with it. So glad I have a little piece left, it is all mine!

I don't even like vegetables!  Instead of tomatoes etc, I just used salsa.  I tore the tortillas up to make cutting later easier.  And I put a layer of canned refried beans above the first tortilla layer.  The liquid was good to keep the tortillas soft.  And just after it started bubbly, I put a layer of cheese.  Will make again!

My family loved this recipe. I omitted the water and added a can of refried beans as a layer, but kept everything else. I also made jalapeno cornbread and it was fabulous together.

I made several of the changes recommended below...omitted the water, added garlic powder to the ground turkey, mixed 1 can of refried beans with 1 jar of salsa to create more layers in the lasagna, and added a few layers of shredded cheese.  However, it was still a little bland and a little too soupy for us.  It wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

This was really good and everyone liked it, but I didn't have taco seasoning on hand so I used fajita seasoning.  It still tasted great, and I couldn't believe how quick it was to make.

I really liked this recipe -- all the ingredients were in my pantry/fridge and it was simple to put together.  Being in a hurry to get dinner on the table, I followed the directions exactly when putting together the meat sauce rather than reading previous reviews as usual.  I was somewhat alarmed by the amount of liquid in the pot, and rushed to the computer to see if anyone else had commented.  
During the time it took to read enough reviews to realize that I was going to have to "drain and re-season", the sauce had been simmering long enough to evaporate most of the unwanted liquid. The result was a nicely seasoned turkey mixture that tasted great in the final dish.  I only added a bit a dried green chile pepper to the ricotta/egg mixture and some shredded Mexican cheese to the top.  My family raved -- well mostly. My oldest ground-meat hating daughter wished it had shredded beef, which I will try soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

There is WAY too much liquid in this recipe. I'm new to cooking so I try to make everything by the recipe *exactly* when I try something new. BIG MISTAKE. I ended up having to drain my pan (which looked like it was filled with watery soup) to fill the lasagna with the less then flavorful meat mixture. I added cheddar to the top and we ate it- but next time I will use the *idea* of this recipe to create a less soupy (more flavorful) meal. Sorry!

Really great recipe, Brenda!  I skipped the water entirely... there was plenty of liquid from the tomatoes and chiles.  I also seasoned the ricotta with salt and garlic powder.  I added a layer of guacamole after the meat, and made the last layer flour tortillas topped with shredded cheese and cayenne.  It really looked pretty when it came out of the oven, and everyone said it tasted great.  Thanks again!

You definitely have to do a lot of changing of the recipe to make it better.  Less water, more cheese and spices would be better.

I omitted the water in the recipe and added tortilla shells and mexican cheese on top before baking.  It added a little crunchy texture.  This was very good!

I thought this was pretty good.  I used flour tortillas and they weren't soggy at all - but I did cut the water down to 1/2 a cup and drained the tomatoes.  That just sounded like way too much liquid for a lasagna kind of recipe.  Other than that, the rest worked fine and was delicious!  Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!  I read other reviews and took some advice, namely adding cumin to the ricotta and a little extra spice to the meat and reducing the water.  I also used lean beef instead of turkey and added a small amount of marble cheddar to each layer.  My husband said he liked it even better than regular lasagna!

Truly enjoyed this alternate version of lasagna! Cut the water down to 1.5 cups or even 1 cup...2 cups is too much. I also melted some shredded cheddar cheese on top when I baked it. Very good!

This recipe was very good though we like our Mexican food hotter and spicier.  I added crushed red pepper, Mexican seasoning, chili powder, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  Also, the ingredients call for taco seasoning mix and 2 cups of water, but they are not included in the directions.  I used 1 cup of water and that was plenty.  Took other's suggestions and added the refried bean layer, with cheese in layers and cheese and black olives on top.  This one is a keeper!

My family of six absolutely LOVED this receipe, so much so, after my 11 year old daughter took her first bite, she asked could she have the same thing for lunch! It's a great recipe with a wonderful Mexican twist, and I am a major Mexican food lover. Like another reviewer, I added mixed Jack & Cheddar Mexican cheese on the top which made it even bubbly and colorful, with the sour cream/salsa garnish as an excellent final touch. It's a quick and easy dinner for Mom's on the go, but everyone thinks you slaved for hours over it.

It was Good!! I read all the reviews and took a little from here and a little from there. I left out the eggs. I did use ricotta and would  leave it out next time. It wasn't bad, but I just didn't feel like it added any thing to the dish. I would replaced it with Fat free spicy refried beans and cheddar jack cheese shreds. I added them  any way. It was easy and tasted very yummy!! I would recomend this recipe, but add what ever twist you like, IT WORKS!

This was an easy meal to prepare and my entire family LOVED it!  Even my picky eater asked for THIRDS!  :)  Only thing I changed is adding shredded Mexican blend of Kraft cheese on top to melt & brown.  We have decided this will be one of our 'family favorites'!  Thanks for sharing!

This was an easy dish to prepare. The flavor was yummy, even with low fat dairy products.  I went by the recipe except for swapping out the tomatoes & chilies for 1 can of Rotel.  I wasn't sure what to do with all the extra liquid in the meat mixture, but hubby dumped it over the top & it didn't come out soggy.  I think I'll use corn tortillas next time...reminds me more of enchiladas.

This was delicious.  I did cut back on the water only use maybe 1/2 cup.  I also used extra lean beef because I had that on hand.  I added a little taco seasoning to the ricotta mixture and a layer of pepper jack cheese in the middle and on top.  Very good the next day, too!  Quick and easy.

Easy and very good!  I reduced the water to 1/3 cup and substituted  3/4 C. salsa for the chiles.  Simmer for a few minutes for the meat mixture to thicken.  Other than that I followed the directions and the result was great!  Good leftovers.

Just tried this recipe tonight and it was not a big hit with anyone. I followed the recipe without all the changes - it really bothers me when someone gives a recipe 5 stars, but they've completely changed it.  So, if following the recipe, it's very bland and definitely needs work.  I liked the other suggestions about adding cheese, yellow onion and spices.  I may try it again with a LOT of changes, but will not make again like this.

This is a nice change from an Italian lasagne. Lighter and spicier using turkey mince it is also good cold. I would recommend serving some Doritos or other corn snacks with the salsa though to provide some alternative texture. Crusty bread is also good. Altogether, a 'keeper'.

This was pretty good, I think the only reason I wasn't thrilled with it was because I really don't like the texture of ricotta cheese personally... if I make this again,  will have to think about what I can replace it with... the family enjoyed it overall, thanks for the recipe!

This was very good - the taste is fantastic (I did as other reviewers suggested and added a layer of refried beans w/ spicy salsa and a light layer of cheese to each layer of tortillas).  So, it went like this:  tortillas, bean/salsa mix, ricotta cheese mix, meat mix, thin layer of cheese; repeat about 3 times and finish with tortillas and a light sprinkling of cheese and green onion.  I thought, however, it was a bit of a pain to do all of the layers - it took me almost 30 minutes just to put it together and I dirtied up many dishes.  Also, I used reduced fat ricotta cheese and lean turkey breast - for a 3x3 square piece, there is about 5 grams of fat per serving and it tastes fine.  It's very filling, so one square was fine for me and hubby had two.  Finally, there is a TON of food.  I would recommend assembling in two 8x8 pans and freezing one prior to cooking.  There is no way our family of 3 can eat all of it!

Very good dish!  I used ground beef (85/15) instead of the turkey, also in the final 5 minutes of the bake time I added a 1 1/2 cups of shreaded cheddar cheese.  Very good and a very quick recipie!

I thought this was a really neat twist to regular lasagna. I read the reviews before making and made some changes myself.  I too added a can of refried beans and 2 cups of fiesta blend cheese (half of that to the top layer). I also completely omitted the water and it was still too runny so I simmered it for a bit to let it all evaporate. I believe next time I will add another layer of tortillas either in the middle or to the top at the end so they don't burn. Also sprayed my pan so the tortillas didn't stick.

I wanted to love this b/c it was so easy and ingredients are easily found... and I did!  I used 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 cup water, and 2 t chili powder + 1/2 t cumin (sub for taco seasoning); also added 2t chili pwd + 1/2 t cumin to 1 small can of refried beans. A layer that I don't think is optional. I'm not sure if the ricotta and egg add anything so I might try ommitting it and replace it with cheese. Update: leftovers resulted in soggy tortillas.  I'm going to blame the ricotta.  Will definately opt for layer of cheese instead of ricotta & egg.

This was great! I was worried about it not requiring any shredded cheese, but it wasn't needed;The ricotta gave all the cheesy flavor needed! My husband couldn't even tell it was ground turkey instead of ground beef! We will definately make this one again soon.

This was very good. Had to follow the suggestion of leaving out the extra 2 cups of water.  If it had been noodles uncooked, the extra water would have made sense!  However, flour tortillas are not that forgiving and it would have been soggy.  Overall, this recipe was very good tasting.  I doubled it and used two pans; froze one for another day!  Thanks for the great recipe! Even my picky eaters raved.

Not Mexican and not lasagna. Tried to spice it up but that really didn't help. If you're really looking for a spicy lasagna keep looking, this isn't it.

We didn't care for this at all.  It may have been somewhat better if we'd decreased the water to 1/2 cup, but the 2 cups took forever to boil off to the point where I could transfer the meat mixture to the pan.  The texture of the ricotta cheese and egg was not appealing to us at all.  Put soggy taco shells on top of that from excessive water in the meat sauce and you do not have an appetizing dish.  Again, maybe to reduce the water to 1/2 cup like that other lady would have made a difference, but this wasn't something I'd bother with again.

This recipe is delicious!!  I had a small dinner party and decided on a Mexican theme and everyone loved this dish. I followed the recipe exact and had excellent results.  On the plate with the lasagna I served a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce with a dollup of the sour cream/salsa mixture--it looked as good as it tasted. Thanks for the recipe!

Just wanted to say thanks for this easy, tasty recipe.  I omitted the water but instead added 1 can of tomato sauce and spiced it up with a little tabasco for some kick.  I also added a layer of refried beans on top of each tortilla layer per other user reviews.  I also threw in some mexican shredded cheese... definitely worth making again =)

This was good, but will make again. I may have made a small mistake and cooked off more of the liquid than needed. I thought it would be too runny but it turned out a little dry. mind you the instructions did not say to cook off liquid, I decided to. I will make again but not cook turkey mixture too long after adding all ingredients.

I loved this meal. It was so easy to make and sooooooooooo delicious. I used whole wheat tortillas instead and I put a layer of monterey jack cheese on top before I baked it. This is also a great meal to make and freeze.

This is an easy and quick recipe that's very tasty! I followed the advice of some of the other users and added a layer of refried beans mixed with salsa. I also added a layer of mexican cheese. I decided not to incorporate the peppers as my boyfriend doesn't like them, and it was still very flavorful. This dish is easily made low-fat/low-carb by using whole wheat tortillas and low-fat/skim milk products. I recommend making your layers pretty thin . . . My layers of the ricotta mixture were a little thick and too "liquidy."

I also love this and changed a few things. I tried this with ground turkey and ground beef and it was much better with beef.
Used corn tortillas instead of flour, added jalapenos and corn. Also added cheddar and pepperjack to the layers, plus chopped olives.

This is my favorite recipe by far!  I've got very picky eaters in my house but none of this dish survived their second day of leftovers.  If nutrition is a concern, here is how I up-ed this recipe:  I added refried pinto beans, used whole-wheat tortillas, used only half a packet of taco seasoning, used half ricotta- half firm tofu and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I know it sounds weird, but the guys in my house had NO IDEA they were eating so good.  This will definitely be a staple at our house from now on.

I made this dish for my daughters Mexican-theme birthday party.  It was easy to make and delicious.  I added some grated jack cheese on the top.  Excellent the next day for leftovers.   Heats up well in the microwave.  I will definetly be making this dish again.

I took this to a mexican themed pot luck and everyone loved it. I didn't think it was that great at first - just okay - but it grew on me and I was mad the next day when I didn't have leftovers. I will be making this again. I did pour out some of the liquid from the meat sauce (about 1/2 cup) because it seemed like so much. It turned out perfect. I also added black olives and cheese to the top just before it was done.

This recipe turned out okay.  I don't recommend the flour tortillas because they became so mushy and soft that they gave the lasagne a poor texture.  It tasted okay, but I will probably never make again.

This was so good!!!!!  My boyfriend laughed at the idea of a Mexican lasagna, but he was stopped in his tracks after the first bite!  I topped the lasagna with Monterey Jack cheese and black olives and served it with green olive and cheese stuffed bread.  Mmmmm  Good!

My 12 yr old daughter made this after I got all the ingredients for her. It was such a huge hit. This is the second time she's made it. On the top layer, she added cheese and pepperoni.

Delicious! We crisped the pitas first in the oven (so the leftovers aren't as soggy), added a layer of refried beans and melted cheese on top. We all had seconds and couldn't believe how good it turned out!

Great base recipe....I sub'd white chopped onion, added a few cloves of minced garlic, 2 roasted poblano peppers and chicken broth instead of water (only 1/2 amt)....like others, I also added some cheddar cheese on each layer and used flavored tortillas for extra flavor....I foresee a myriad of combinations in the future with this recipe - thanks!

Yum we loved this. Did make some changes though ricotta just seemed strange so left that out. I added refried beans and used rotel. Will make again. Maybe try black beans next time.

LOVED this recipe, but I did add a few tweaks!  I mixed the ricotta with gorgonzola crumbles, a spicy cheese sauce from my native Austin, TX area, and various spices. In addition, I also did have a layer of refried beans.  Top layer was a shredded Colby/Jack mix.  Soooo good! :)  Sour cream is a great topper, but guacamole on top is also fantastic!

This was delicious! I omitted the extra water because I was afraid it would be to mushy and I also added black refried beans in the layers and it was just what it needed. Will add this to make often list.

I only added 1/4 cup of water. I warmed up refried beans with some water and put in layers: Tortillas, refried beans, riccotta, meat mix, shredded tex-mex cheese. I topped it with more tex-mex cheese, cilantro and chopped olives.  The family loves it!

When I first made this I thought it was going to be way too watery but discovered that while baking, all the juices soak into the tortillas and make them just like lasagna noodles. I used ground beef instead of turkey and rinsed well before adding other ingredients to skillet. I also added a nacho taco cheese blend between layers. Overall this is a wonderful twist on taco night that the whole family LOVES!!

Very simple and easy to make. I didn't have any taco seasoning so I added paprika, cumin, garlic, chili powder, oregano and salt and pepper. Plus some shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese and a can of corn. I also used corn tortillas because that was what I had on hand. My husband and children liked this dish too.

LOVE THIS DISH!  This the 2nd time I've made it and my husband really, really really likes. 
I don't use store bought Taco Mix.  The first time I made it I didn't have any so I used a recipe from
allrecipes.com.  The homemade mix was so easy to make this second time I chose to do the same thing. I used a can of Rotel Original for the can of tomatoes. 
Thanks for a simple to make and delicious to eat dish.  Next time I'm gonna try whole wheat tortillias.

Very good - I omit a star because I changed it a bit after the initial go-around. I didn't care for the ricotta (personal preference) and so used shredded mozz/cheddar instead. Also, I use a little hot salsa in addition to the veggies listed - gives it a little oomph. Good basic recipe, though, and I do use it quite frequently. It's also good cut in small squares as an app on game day!

This one's a keeper.  I did take some reviewer's advice and did not add the water.  I also added a layer of refried beans,layered shredded cheese and topped with cheese. I also toasted 8 inch whole wheat tortillas a little. I also liked it topped with guacamole, salsa & sour cream.

The whole family loved it. I followed the original recipe and it was great. I will probably play with it next time, but I see that more as "what toppings do you like on your tacos?" My husband scrambled the leftovers with eggs and a little shredded cheese - tasted just like a great breakfast burrito.

I thought this recipe was okay; it had a lot of good spicy flavor.  It had an odd texture, though, which I think was due to layering the ricotta/egg mixture on top of the tortillas.  It came out soft and tasting rather like, I would say, imitation lasagna noodles.  I didn't mind it, but my husband wasn't too fond of it. I used ground beef instead of turkey, and after adding the next five ingredients to the meat, let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the onions to get tender.  I also topped the casserole with 2 cups of shredded pepperjack cheese, and increased the baking time to 30 minutes, so the liquid from the meat sauce would be adequately cooked in.

This recipe makes a delicious, quick meal.  The only thing I did differently than the directions was to add shredded cheese to the top before baking.  I would highly  recommend this to your list of recipes to try, you won't be disappointed!

I have mixed thoughts on this recipe.  I am only giving it three stars cause I did change alot of the recipe to suit my taste.  I think there is way too much water for this recipe.  I only used 1 cup.  I think the diced tomatoes should be drained.  I added a sm can of sliced olives and a can of refried beans.  I also added colby jack cheese to two of the layers.  I may try this again, but I will make some added changes.

Just awesome! Didn't change anything. Meat took awhile to simmer down but nothing a slotted spoon couldn't fix once we started making the layers. Definitely adding into rotation.

Wonderful, easy recipe!  I halved it for my meat-eating fiance and he loved it. My changes: ground beef instead of turkey and cooked it with one onion (2 if doing full-size). I also added about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce because I didn't think it was thick enough. Added 1/2 can of corn as well. Added shredded Mozarella to the top for the last 5 minutes. Served with sliced avocado and he loved it!  For me, I made a vegan version. I used 1 block of soft tofu mixed with 1/2 container of Tofutti cream cheese - this was my "Ricotta" mixture. For the "meat", I used the same amount of tomatoes but added a cooked onion, a can of kidney beans and 1/2 can of corn. (you could add some shredded vegan cheese if you have it, I just didn't have any on hand).  A great recipe that I was able to "veganize" and enjoy with my man! Thanks!

This was such a great recipe.  So flavorful and good.  I did not add as much water as the recipe suggested, I didn't see the need for it.  I maybe put in 1/4 cup of water to a 1/2 cup of water at best.  I did garnish with fresh chopped lettuce, chopped tomatoes and chopped green onions.  Looked amazine and was a complete hit at my pot luck!

REALLY REALLY good!!!  I halved the recipe, since hubby won't eat this, and ended up freezing it all in 1 cup Ziploc containers - PERFECT every time I heat one up! :D For me, half the recipe made 8 - 1 cup servings!  Only thing is I did not seem to have enough tortillas for all the layers called for - but it tastes fantastic either way.  I used lean ground beef instead of turkey, and no other changes.  Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

southwestern food is 99% of the time easy to make and fantastic tasting - it's hard mess it up but this recipe was struggling from the beginning.  despite good feedback from other users, I didn't like this at all.

I used Boca "meat" in place of the turkey to make it a vegetarian dish. My husband, who is a meat eater, loved the dish.

Our family loved this dish. My son was not crazy about the green onions, but we liked the flavor and texture they added.  I made the following changes: reduced amt of water to about 1 cup, added fresh cilantro to the ricotta mixture and salsa/sour cream mixture, and added shredded cheddar in each layer.  I gave this recipe a 4 star because the tortillas were soggy, but I am not sure how you could avoid that.  Maybe either using corn or toasting them as mention in other reviews would have made a difference.  We will make this again.

I made this recipe this evening and my family loved it.  I did have to tweek it a bit.  I used a 1 1/2 lb. of beef,(family is not turkey fans). Instead of just two tortillas on each layer I used three, so I could completely cover the 9 x 13 pan.  I also placed sliced colby jack cheese on top of each of the tortilla layers, then smoothed the ricota mixture over that.  For the meat mixture I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce, instead of the diced tomatoes.  My family isn't big on chuncky tomatoes.  I cut the water way down to just about 3/4 to 1 cup instead. I had a few extra tortillas and I cut them into triangles, placed them on a baking sheet, drizzled them with olive oil, sprinkled them with some Goya Adobo seasoning, took a brush and spread the oil and seasoning evenly on each slice and baked them at 400 degrees.  They were sooooooooooo good.  I will make those on their own often.  Great snack.

In tried this last night.  I added 8oz of shredded cheddar to the top before baking as requested by my daughter.  Though I thought it was very good I would say that it could use a bit more spice.  I may add some salsa to the main dish or another half packet of taco seasoning.   I liked the topping of salsa and sour cream and thought it added alot to the dish.

Fantastic, easy, very original recipe. I made it for the first time this week and everyone loved it, and we have some people in my family who are very picky about their Mexican food. I didn't end up using all 8 tortillas, you can probably get away with just 6, ie three layers.

this sounded gorgeous so I was very disappointed with the result!! It smelt perculiar while cooking and only one of the family ate more than a couple of mouthfuls. I really like the idea of using tortillas and the ricotta mixture so maybe I'll try this base using beef and missing out the taco seasoning. will let you know!

It was very tasty.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I read the other reviews and did 1/2 with beans to see how it would taste so everyone enjoyed the option of with or without beans.  I only used 1/2 of the taco pack but added pepper to the meat.

This is a very simple and fun recipe.  I love Mexican food and I love Italian food.  What a great combination.  I followed the recipe to the letter, I just added mozerella and cheddar cheese to give it a little more umph!!  I served it to a friend who is very picky about food and her response was:   It was the bomb!  Very quick, easy and it's tasty to boot.  Enjoyed this recipe tremendously

Omg....this is soooo good.  I added the refried beans and the cheddar/jack cheese & it turned out sooo good.  My whole family loved it.  It tastes even better the next day!

Being a vegetarian, I used "Veggie Ground Round" instead of the meat. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, since it was what I had, and that seemed to work well. It was delicious, and my meat-eating boyfriend also loved it. We couldn't stop at 2 pieces!

Very Quick, and tasty, I don't usually try new dishes and serve to company first time, but I did this one. Was finished from prep to cook in 45 minutes. Added shredded cheddar to the top... was a hit

Excellent!  I used corn tortillas, added refried beans, and put shredded mexican cheese on top.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of water and let it simmer a little before putting the dish together.  I did not have too much liquid at all.  It would have been too dry had I not added the water.

Very easy and tasty recipe. A good one to be creative with and personalize according to your family's tastes. The ricotta cheese layer really adds something (a little cilantro in it was good too }. My husband even liked it and he normally doesn't like mexican food. Will definately make it again.

Very good-follow suggestions to nix extra water (maybe 3/4C, just depends on canned veggies used) and add a layer of beans/salsa.  Also used Ro-tel instead of individual cans of green chiles and tomatoes

I thought this was good. I added the refried beans mixed with the salsa but the sauce does not need the 2 cups of water. It was too runny even though I cooked the sauce and tried to get it to thicken. When it comes out of the oven it is really soupy.

I used others advice and added one can of refried beans to the middle and I didn't add any water -- I don't like runny food all over my plate.  I also added a little chili powder and garlic to the ground turkey for a little more flavor.  I thought it was delicious and it made quite a large helping so we had leftovers for a few days.  Very hearty and satisfying!

This is a great recipe as long as you use less water!  The only other changes I made were to use only one pound of hamburger and add a can of black beans.  I also only had three layers instead of four.  I will definatly be making this again!

Very good.  I used corn tortillas and omitted the water.  I also added more seasonings.  Next time, I'll toast the tortillas before making so they are crunchy and add some fresh corn to the mix.

Made this recipe for my girlfriend a few days ago and it was a huge hit. I followed another reviewers idea and used a bean paste along with everything else in the layers.  I also used a little of the meat on the top sprinkled with some grated cheese and bannana peppers.  Great simple recipe.

I took the advice of others and added olives, used NO water, corn tortillas & added shredded cheese within the layers. It turned out very well -- and we were able to keep lots of leftovers. It was easy & tasted great!

Way too much liquid.  We ended up having to drain it and then try to add back in flavor.  I thought it was just ok, but my husband liked it.

This is a great variation to the usual italian dish.  I used ground beef, diced tomatoes with jalapenos and no-boil lasagna noodles.  I also added fresh cilantro and a little cumin to the ricotta mixture and topped with cheddar and olives as previously suggested.  Came out very tasty.  Next time, I'll make it a little spicier.  I think you can adjust the spice to your taste easily by changing the flavor of diced tomatoes and adding whatever other peppers/seasonings you like.

Bland. Needs "spicing up"; perhaps salsa, hot sauce, etc. Try a different recipe.

Mmmmm, was this yummy!!!  I used ground beef and rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro.  Hubby and I both loved it.  It was even good the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe, Brenda.
