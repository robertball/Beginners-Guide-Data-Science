This is something I make all the time during the summer. To change it up, I might add chopped bacon and shredded lowfat cheese. Almost everyone who tries it likes it better than potato salad! I use lowfat mayo or FF sour cream/plain yogurt to lower the fat a bit.

I was looking for a recipe to use my cauliflower before it went bad, and this turned out to be pretty good (and simple). I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand so I made a few modifications: used red onion (a few tbs because I didn’t want the onion to be overpowering), used relish instead of pickles, used bacon bits instead of real bacon (they didn't stay crispy so I would suggest adding them just before serving or use real bacon!) and omitted the peas. There was a bit too much dressing, but it tastes just like potato salad. I wasn’t expecting this salad to be spectacular, but I was nicely surprised. Puts a nice twist in the average potato salad.

Very Good - I used frozen cauliflower and cooked it according to the package directions which kept it a little crispy. I added real bacon pieces (less fat) and also used less light-mayonnaise and only 2 eggs to help reduce the calories a little.

Fabulous!  My guy is currently on a low carb diet so I thought I would try this and wasn't expecting much.  We both loved it and I will continue to make this even after his diet is over.  I didn't use the pickles or eggs but that was just a preference.  I would use it in the future.  I also did half Duke's Mayo (no sugar) and half sour cream.  Thanks submitter - a definite keeper.

Not being a fan of potato salad myself...I was surprised that I liked this dish.  I blanched the fresh cauliflower until desired tenderness.  Served with pulled pork sandwiches. Everyone enjoyed.

The salad came out great! I used red onion, and I wish I cut it more finely, but it was still good. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good imitation of potato salad! I thought the cooking time was a bit much for the cauliflower. I would take off about 5 minutes next time, other than that it was delicious.

A great way to eat cauliflower, and a nice light salad, not heavy like potato salad.  Tastes better with fresh cooked cauliflower, compared to frozen, in my opinion. This recipe is a keeper!

Delish! I preferred mine less rich, no eggs, less mayo, less dill pickles. I have to say that yes I improvised with what I had...used no peas, added fresh parsley and used red onion for color, and we ate it immediately, no marination. This a great base idea for a potatoless salad. My teens said "Mom made cauliflower taste good. It's magic! Nuff said. Thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting "fake potato" salad!  We eliminated the s+p, thinking that is personal preference, and omitted the onions because we had none.  Cauliflower is one of our favorite vegetables, so this definitely came out as a winner!  Thanks for the recipe!

I forgot the eggs but put a tiny bit of horseradish in it considering I didn’t have mustard. 
 My husband raved and went out and bought a head of cauliflower and some mustard. He gave it to me with a big smile. I think we will probably be eating it again and hopefully remember the eggs this time.

Very good ingredients! I would never have put them together. However, I used raw, uncooked cauliflower. Delicious! I added just a few things. 1 tsp. dill, a dash or 2 of hot sauce and small cubes of pepper jack cheese. I added diced celery, because I had no peas. And I left out the bacon. It had a nice crisp texture, and I didn't have to wait for it to cool.

Great alternative to traditional potato salad, in fact my husband prefers this. Great recipe as is. 
Have also substituted celery for peas and green onion for onion with good results.

I tried this after reading all the great reviews, BUT is it just me but I thought it was WAY too salty.....  After I mixed the dressing I had to add more ingredients to take away the saltiness, so not sure if one teaspoon of salt is a misprint or not.  Otherwise it would be okay.

Wow.  I'm surprised.  This really is good.  A little too salty for my taste, but really good.  Never guess it was cauliflower if you didn't know.  Not exactly like potato, texture wise, but nice and slightly crunchy.

I can't eat potato salad (my favorite) because of the high potassium level.  This satisfied my craving for potato salad. Great.

For a different twist, I substituted  curry powder in place of the mustard and added a Tbsp of lemon juice.  It was colorful and tasted great.

I followed the recipe as it is written. It was very good!!! I will make it again but would like it creamier. I thought it was a little dry after sitting in the frig for the afternoon. Next time I will make it a full cup of mayonnaise and a bit more mustard.
Thank you for the recipe!!!

Very nice! Nice & light and refreshing version of an old summer favorite. Only  thing is probably a good idea to let cauliflower sit on paper towels for 5 minutes after draining.

Looking for something different to do with a head of cauliflower and came across this recipe.  What a nice find!  Made as directed, just left out the bacon.  It was surprisingly good and a decent sub for potato salad.  Took it to the office and got rave reviews.  Be sure to well drain cauliflower after cooking, otherwise dressing will be somewhat watered down.  Next time I will reduce onions to about half, maybe use sweet pickle relish instead of dill (personal preference).  Will make a nice potluck dish.

Surprisingly delicious! I made the salad for a 4th of July BBQ and it was a hit. I added chunks of bacon and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

LOVED! This is a new favorite in our family. We made it primarily as the recipe is written. What really struck me is that you could substitute cauliflower for potatoes in any potato salad recipe.

Loved this! My son is diabetic so a lower carb option to potato salad is ideal; and the bonus was that everyone likes this better! I left out the peas and added some horseradish, yummy.

I took out the peas, dill pickles and bacon an substituted 2 cooked potatoes cubed and 1 cup of diced celery and used only 2 eggs.  I steamed the peeled, diced potatoes for 5 minutes and then added the cauliflower for another 5-6 minutes to steamer.  Put the salad together and it's great !

I loved this recipe with a few tweaks. To make it healthier, I used plain low-fat yogurt instead of mayonnaise, no eggs, and no bacon. I also used chopped celery and red onion instead of the peas. Adding some dill weed and garlic powder topped this dish off perfectly.

What a fantastic idea! I am completely off of carbs save for berries and a few choice fruits, so I opted for spinach instead of peas - so delicious, thank you for this recipe!

Yummy! A great way to add flavor to cauliflower while enjoying a "Potato" salad with less starch. I left out the peas, added celery because I had some in the fridge and a squeeze of lemon juice.

I don't think you get accurate reviews if you change half the ingredients.  Made exactly as is and it is fabulous.  Definitely satisfies one's craving for potato salad with using potatoes.

I'm not on a keto diet or anything, but I had these made by someone who was, and loved it. So I looked online for a recipe. I just like that this is so yummy and a great way to eat cauliflower!   I added celery because I like it , but the rest of the recipe was terrific.

I’ve made this a few years ago and again today for Easter.  I didn’t steam the cauliflower ( hastily read recipe) :(.  I guess I’ll serve it as is.  Has  anyone out there done this?   If so,  how was it the next day?

Very good.  Instead of frozen green peas, I used a large handful of fresh sugar snap peas.  I threw these in with the cauliflower after the cauliflower was almost al dente to blanch them for about 1 minute or less.  Instead of regular onion, I used scallions, both white and green parts. I added 1 teaspoon of sugar to the dressing.  The salad was very yummy - thank you for the recipe.

This was pretty good, and oh so close to regular potato salad, but wasn't spectacular.  (I guess I don't think potato salad is spectacular anyway, so maybe that's it.)  It turned out fine, but I would have personally left out the pickle.  Took it to a church potluck...still had a bunch left over and past the next day, I didn't like it anymore.  Still, a healthier version that potato salad.  I would encourage others to give it a try if they are looking for something like that.

Made it with Oatly creme fraiche instead of mayonnaise, dijon mustard, frozen cauliflower and onions, no pickles, bacon, peas, or hard boiled egg. Was a little worried when it looked watery but let it sit 24 hours and it thickened right up. The bare bones recipe was still phenomenal.

I made this for the first time last week, and I ate it in 2 days.
I really enjoyed the dressing and the vegetable combination. I just wanted to let you know that I will be making it again today.
Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I didn't measure exact and it still came out great! I didn't put as much pickle, only a few small pieces. I'll definitely make this again.

This is something I will definitely make again and again. Only thing I changed was the pickles. I don't like dill pickles so I used a sweet pickle relish. My husband loved it. I took some to my niece and she went crazy over it.

Being on a low carb diet, and a die hard potato salad fan, this hit the spot.  I added a little pickle juice to loosen the sauce and made everything according to directions sans bacon.  I would've added it but forgot.  Would definitely make again.

I love this recipe.  Always a hit at BBQ parties.  I never leave a party without having to share the recipe.
I add green onion instead of a regular onion.

Excellent salad!  It's great as is, and I will use it as a 'base' salad to add ingredients depending on my mood. It was a big hit at our Father's Day gathering ??

I left out the eggs, and used 2/4 cup of light mayo and 2 Tbsp light sour cream, jalapeno, and 1/2 onion. This turned out ao much better than I expected. I served with BBQ pork sandwhiches. Wonderful!!

This dish is delicious! My husband and I are on a low carb diet and this tastes just like the real thing. It's one of the best "mock" salads I've tried- and I didn't even add the bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

Our ladies' club is having a Fall luncheon and everyone  needs to bring a salad.  This sounds like a good one and different so I'll make it without the eggs but with carrots
and sliced black olives for a Fall color scheme.   I know it will be delicious because of the main ingredients listed.

This recipe is excellent! I omitted the bacon just to keep it more on the healthy side. No doubt it would be even better with bacon...cause everything is better with bacon! Thanks :-)

Excellent!! My boyfriend described it as a surprisingly delicious cross between egg salad and pasta salad. I didn't have all of the ingredients so I altered it a bit: I used dijon mustard and dill mustard. I didn't have dill pickles so I added sweet india relish. I didn't have frozen peas, so I added a frozen corn/carrot/green bean medley. I used turkey bacon, and I omitted the onion because I don't like raw onion in salads. It turned out so well and is a great way to get kids to eat cauliflower because you don't realize you're eating cauliflower. I can't wait to make this again for the first summer BBQ!!

This was so boring I had to rate it.

Very plain so I tried adding some ranch, didn't help a bit. It was like a bland, mayonnaise salad. Skip the cauliflower and just make. A potatoe or pasta salad!

This was pretty good. I subbed red pepper for the peas because I don't like peas and did omit the bacon to save calories but it was a nice change and fit well into my low carb diet plan.  Thanks!

I love potato salad and any kind of salad in general. I passed on the bacon which cut back on the sodium and fat but I bet it would be good. (I didn't have any on hand)

I'm trying very hard to get on the whole bandwagon of subbing cauliflower for things.  I do like cauliflower.  I really wanted to like this salad but really didn't.  I didn't make it as a sub for potato salad but instead as a way to use a head of cauliflower that was nearing expiration.  I wish I'd gone with my instinct and used green onions instead of a regular onion because that taste really dominated the salad.  I'm curious to see what Hubs says about it.  I doubt that I'll be doing this again though.  Thanks.

I was looking to use my cauliflower before I went on vacation and I had all the ingredients on hand. It was very good. Not something that I must include in my rotation but I will use this again when I need to use a head of cauliflower. Definitely add bacon if you have it on hand.

Yum! This is so good! I like to add a few radishes, it makes it look so pretty. I don't feel quite so guilty if I have seconds either since it's made with cauliflower, haha.

Have made this repeatedly since discovering it here.  What a delicious low-carb option to regular potato salad and tasty way to add cruciferous veggies to your diet.  I find myself craving it often.  Added celery once and it was okay, but the recipe is better as writ.  Just thinking about it has reminded me that I need to go to the grocery store for more cauliflower...

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is!  The only change I made was I used seasoned salt for extra spice.  I'll add more pickles next time just because I like them so much :)

This was such a pleasant surprise.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  The only thing I changed, as others have mentioned, is that I used 1/3 cup of light mayo and 2/3 cups of fat free sour cream to lighten the calories.  I omitted the eggs for the same reason but I'm sure they would be a wonderful addition. I will be making this a lot this summer.

I will never make potato salad again.  This was AWESOME.  My kids ate it.  I didn't put the bacon in since I didn;t have any.  I'm on my way to the kitchen to make more.

Great healthy alternative to potato salad.  also added 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 1 extra tablespoon mustand and 2 tablespoons white vinegar.   I must have had a mammoth cauliflower because I needed to triple the other ingredients.  Will definitely make again and again!
