Helped to add more sugar and cinnamon before rolling the balls (before doing that, a taste-tester said they were "bland")

This turned out pretty good. They're a bit chewey and the flavor wasn't too strong. I think maybe I'll try instant espresso next time to give it more of a coffee flavor. Everyone at the office seemed to like them, though.

I must have done something wrong, because when I made these they were more like goo than a cookie. I doubt thats what theyre supposed to look like, but they did taste excellent ^^;;

I had no trouble rolling these as other reviewers did.  I halved the recipe and wound up with 17 balls. I did not try to dissolve the coffee powder but just added it directly into the mix, which worked out fine. If you're a coffee lover you will enjoy these.

This is an excellent adult dessert.  The overwhelming coffee and liquer flavor is addictive.  It takes at least 45 minutes to dissolve the coffee granules in the Kahlua, though, so be patient.  And if you blanch your own almonds, they must be thoroughly dry to grind or you get mush.

I have been making these for years even though they are a sticky pain in the butt! Everybody LOVES these! I can never make enough! I do add a bit more Karo and Kahlua, and I use  chocolate animal crackers. Gives them a richer taste than the oreo with it's white cream filling. They are easier to put into a processor and make a finer grind, which makes for a smoother coffee ball.

They were delicious but a little difficult to form into balls. The mix seemed dry and wouldn't pack together so I added more Karo syrup.

I really struggled to get these balls to come together as balls.  They were on the dry side and the cookie crumbs and almonds just didn't seem to want to play nice together.  The chocolate defiantly increase the punch of the coffee flavor as well as highlighting  coffee's bitter nature.  All the black coffee drinkers loved them.
