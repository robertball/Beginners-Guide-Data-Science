This is a way more successful than other "banana pancake-flourless" recipes I have tried...they were good to me and my toddler, the hubby started out feeling ok about them then said the texture on the inside is a little off but the flavor was there. They are very moist on the inside but outside is very normal and easy to flip. Added a pinch of salt, and a little cinnamon. Next time I will add alittle more than 1/3 cups of  Oats and see if inside gets a little less soggy. 

Update: 1/2 cup of Oats (ground finely before adding other ingredients) really made a great difference. I make these regularly now! THANKS!

I read all the other reviews and made the changes they suggested: 1/2 cup of oats + vanilla. I also added peanut butter powder, protein powder, ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. It was like a way easier version of banana bread! So delicious! The extra oats and powders made the batter just the right consistency. My husband can smell a "healthy" recipe a mile away and doesn't like me to step away from traditional pancake recipes but LOVED these.

These are absolutely fantastic for a super simple and very healthy recipe.  They are what they are meant to be - a high protein, high fiber recipe without wheat or milk.  If you can't have milk or wheat, these will make you very happy.  I added 1/2 cup of quick oats instead of 1/3, as indicated by another reviewer, and these were not mushy by any stretch of the imagination!  Keep in mind, these are not made with the traditional ingredients of regular pancakes, so don't expect them to taste like regular pancakes!  That being said, they were very moist, tasty, and the hint of banana flavor was fantastic.

OH MAN....these are delicious!!! i only made a couple of minor changes.  no baking powder, as i was all out and i increased the oats to  3/4 cup, and i added fresh blueberries. i used coconut oil in my cast iron skillet to cook these little beauties!  Once it was mixed up in the blender, i let the batter  sit for a few mins. to thicken up a bit, then added the blueberries just before cooking. They are so delicious, no maple syrup is needed, although i did drizzle with some pure Canadian maple syrup! i will definitely be making these again.  Thanksamunch greaterexp3 for a most delicious recipe!

Very excited to find another use for my ripe bananas, but these pancakes were inedible. Although they were cooked through, they were extremely soggy.

These were great! Super simple to make and they even rose a bit like regular pancakes do, which I loved. These are not very sweet at all, so keep that in mind. I served these w/ butter, banana slices and cinnamon syrup. I think I would add a bit of vanilla to the batter next time, but other than that, these are a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really enjoyed these pancakes! I used an overripe banana, 1/2 cup quick oats, a dash of vanilla plus the other ingredients and cooked them in coconut oil. Mine turned out thin verses fluffy but I wasn't expecting a normal pancake so I enjoyed them.

I thought these were excellent for being dairy and wheat free!  I sort of tripled the recipe and used 1 1/2 c. of rolled oats, 2 1/2 bananas, 1/4 c. of peanut butter, 4 eggs, 3/4 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla, 1/2 t. cinnamon, and some chocolate chips.   I put the oats in the blender for a bit first, then added the rest of the ingredients (except chocolate chips) and blended until smooth.  I stirred in the chocolate chips and then cooked on a griddle.  They were good plain, but better with pure maple syrup!

Great recipe :). I tried another recipe on here that did not have the oats and let me just say that the oats in this recipe makes all the difference!! I used 1/2 cup of oats like almost everyone that reviewed this recipe.  I made perfect pancakes and you can't even tell the difference!! Easy to flip & I even used the batter in my waffle maker.  Great healthy recipe that my family enjoyed.

I loved this recipe- simple & quick, still approved by my kids, just what I was looking for, to avoid wheat but still have a treat. I added 1/4 c chia to add antioxidants, and subbed some pumpkin for 1/2 of the banana amount, and added fall spices to go with pumpkin- yum. Thank you!!!

These were delicious! My toddler ate two huge ones and asked for more. I added two tablespoons brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to sweeten them a bit.

I also made a simple caramel sauce on top that's not dairy free but made it taste like banana fosters pancakes.

The family all loved them and us a definite do over.

This was really yummy! I increased the oats to 1/2 and ground them fine first like suggested by reviewers. I also added cinnamon, a handful of chocolate chips and served it with a dollop of plain greek yogurt on top. It was delicious!

I had three very ripe bananas so I tripled the baking powder and oats (I used oat flour) but not the eggs. I just used 4 eggs. I added vanilla and a pinch of salt. I thinned it with a splash of milk but I still needed to spread them with the back of the ladle after pouring them in the hot frying pan. They tasted great and I would make them again!

Really good for kids, they love It. The riper the bananas, the better the pancakes. if you more than double the recipe, you'll need less eggs

I had to modify it for my daughters allergies. We used (2) flax eggs instead of regular eggs. That wasn't enough to hold them together so I added about (2) Tbs of gluten free flour blend to help it stay together. They were amazing. My non-allergic kiddos said they wanted these over traditional in the further...winning!

It turned out way better than I expected with such an odd assortment of ingredients. I did use more than 1/3 cup of oats, but I didn't really measure them. I usually made a similar recipe, with just oats and eggs, but this is much more like real pancakes. I'm not the biggest fan of bananas, so I might try and modify this for something else like peanut butter next time.

I have made this recipe twice now and am happy with the results. For my taste, I prefer to use two small lady finger bananas which have a better flavour than regular bananas. Yum!

My kids and I really liked these. I did add 1/2 oats and a sprinkle of cinnamon and they turned out perfectly.

recipe was very ready to follow and came out great.  I used coconut oil instead of spray, which caused a bit more burning.  also I added blueberries to the mix.  will definitely be trying again

Following feedback from other reviews, I increased ground rolled oats (ground them prior to adding other ingredients) to 1/2 cup and added a pinch of salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Excellent texture and flavour. Definitely added to favourites!

Love these! They are tricky but the key is not to try to flip them to quickly.  Let them sit and cook at a lower temp than you would for traditional pancakes.

Came out soggy and looked like bread pudding. Only giving it two stars because I like bread pudding.

These were fantastic! I read the reviews that said the pancakes were tasteless. I think that's just because of the "tang" of the bananas. I suggest putting in a pinch of salt and either cinnamon or vanilla. I tried one with syrup, it was not bad. The second I ate with homemade strawberry jam. It was heavenly!

Quick and easy way to use some over-ripe bananas. There isn't a lot of flavor but they are filling. Bottom line: all gone and kids asking for more. That's the test!

May want to suggest using very ripened bananas bc if they're not, it will come out very bland!  I did the recipe without the oats and powder & it cooked fine, just like regular pancake for me - just no flavor.

Later, I tried recipe with ripe bananas and it tasted SO GOOD!..but it's more watery, takes longer to cook & came out thin and not puffy like regular pancakes..I then added baking powder based on this recipe and it helped a little bit puffing it up but not of much significance.

This recipe was OK--I put strawberry syrup on mine, which was nice. I tried a recipe that didn't include the oats, and these were easier to flip than those. They do rise slightly, but not like traditional pancakes. I'll make these as something different for breakfast and to get rid of a ripe banana. I blended the oats in my Ninja smoothie cup blender first (to make a flour consistency), and then added the other ingredients and blended--worked perfectly to pour the batter out.

This is a really good recipe. They have a nice flavor to them perfect for munchin by my little one with no syrup! I think with a bit of vanilla it'll be 5 stars.

I just made these today, and I was not optimistic as they were cooking, but they taste great!  I did add a little vanilla, and made sure my banana was very well mushed.  I think they're more filling than flour pancakes, too.  I will use this one again!
