This recipe was very, very dry. I added a bit of heavy cream, a bit of romano cheese, and some grated fontina, took away the oregano-didn't quite mesh with esgargot. And added frsh chopped parsley. trick add a bit of the canning liquid in as well. Also, if you want more flavor omit the artichokes add diced tomatoes and capers and a hearty splash of white wine. (wine and artichokes do not go well together at all)

This recipe was not as expected.  It needed some kind of sauce; was a bit dry.  Could not find escargot, so substituted shrimp.  Did not throw out, but will not make again.
