This is so addictive, I'm making it tonight for the 3rd time in 2 weeks. The only thing I do differently is, I buy whatever cooked shrimp is on sale at the fish counter (I'm not wild about canned shrimp) and then I chop it into small bites and when I sprinkle it over the cream cheese mixture, I press it into the cream cheese with the back of a spoon so it's not on top, it's in the cheese, sour cream, mayo mixture. 
No one gets a bite with no shrimp that way.
I love this recipe. It's perfect for when company comes or I cut it in half for just us.

I've been making this recipe for years...excellent recipe - most love it.  The only thing I do different is use frozen tiny shrimp...SO MUCH better than canned.

I like to also add a can of crabmeat to the mix-it adds great flavor!

This is a great dip, particularly when served with tortilla chips. And by the way, except for the garlic, exactly the recipe from Company's Coming Appetizer book. I own it, and have been making this dip for about 15 years.

I love this recipe, I have made it many times.  I do like to use red pepper instead of green, and I also layer the ingredients.  So the cream cheese mixture on the bottom, then the cocktail sauce mixed with garlic, then the shrimp, peppers, green onions, tomatoes, then cheese.  I also prefer to use marble cheese, although the mozzarella is good too.

I make this spread every year at Christmas time, and it is ALWAYS a huge hit!   * I do not add the garlic, however, and I think that if I were too, I would not add quite as much as called for.  I also typically do not use the 4 full cans of shrimp, and sometimes mix it up a bit by using both crab and shrimp * Also, make sure your cream cheese is softened, so you don't get the lumps as you are mixing it   I never have to worry about leftovers with this spread - delicious!!

This is my go to recipe when I need to take an appetizer some where.  I usually omit the shrimp and use a couple different color of peppers for added flair.  I usually use tortilla chips to serve instead of crackers.  I've found that the taste of cocktail sauces vary.  Some are somewhat overpowering.  Try various ones to find one that you like.  Guests have enjoyed this dish once it has a chance to sit a while.  The flavors seem to gel together.  I also suggest draining the tomato or removing the seeds.  It will help the dish not get watery as it sits.  My favorite part is the leftovers all thrown together in the bowl the next morning.  Fantastic flavor.

My guests liked it or at least they said they did. I did not. The shrimp were so overwhelmed by the garlic, gr onion, gr pepper and cocktail sauce you can't taste the shrimp or crab. I even put a can of crabmeat in the mayo mixture. It reminded me of a horrible salsa with a dollop of mayo on the bottom. 2 **'s only because of the other peoples opinion.

I took this to a party and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were I omitted the chopped tomatoes (not a tomato fan!) and used minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh garlic.  Fabulous dip-  will make again!!

This is our all time family favorite at any function. It goes over well where ever I bring it. It works really well without shrimp, in fact I almost always make it without. Delicious.

This was a huge hit, very easy to make.  I used larger shrimp and it was a little difficult to get them on the cracker and the bite was a little large.  I will use a smaller size next time.

This was a huge hit, the tray was gone quickly. I used red instead of green peppers, and added some pickled jalepenos to create the true "surprise". It's the perfect thing to bring to a party, people will snack on it all night.

I used a small salad shrimps package and they worked perfect.  I didn’t use as much cheese as suggested and I was a little shy on the cocktail sauce but that was fine. It turned out great.

Big hit with the girls. I also used frozen salad shrimp and added some jalapeños and red pepper.   I think sinking the shrimp down into the cream cheese mixture at the bottom made it easier to scoop.

-Use 1/4 c onion instead of garlic in the cream cheese
-can omit peppers(Jude does)
-Use 1/2 ketchup/ 1/2 chili sauce (or all ketchup) instead of cocktail sauce

This is so addicting! I make it the day before - this gives it time for the ingredients to blend and the cocktail sauce to not taste so overpowering.  I followed the advice of a reviewer and used shrimp from a shrimp ring. Don't cut it into little pieces - you won't even notice it's in there. I made this mistake! I'll cut them in half or leave them whole next time. I also added a couple Tbsp of salsa and some garlic salt. Perfection!

It was a big hit at Super Bowl, as I expected.  However, I was hoping for more zing in the recipe.  I will definitely make this again but perhaps with some cayenne pepper mixed in or some banana peppers.
