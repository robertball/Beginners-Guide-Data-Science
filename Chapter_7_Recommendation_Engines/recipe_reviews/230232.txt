Very good. Loved the addition of the apple, and especially the fragrant caraway seeds. I mushed up the caraway seeds with a mortar and pestle, then added the caraway to the soup mixture. Fabulous!  Did not serve the soup over bread, but served the soup with my homemade bread as a side! Very nice!

There were some unexpected ingredients for this soup so I just had to try it. Glad I did! This will be a go to!

great soup! made it the first time mostly following the recipe. i left out the sugar and used chicken broth because that's what i have. wasn't enough broth, but i think my cabbage was too big. i added a little more cider to the bowl as i reheated it. 

second batch, i added rutabaga, potatoes and kielbasa. i left the apples out because they had no flavor in the first batch. i'll put them back in the next batch. there was no flavor left in the apples because it all went into the soup.

We loved this.  But, like another reviewer, I omitted the olive oil, using  the bacon drippings instead.   I realized I had no vegetable bouillon or stock, so I used chicken bouillon.  Also, I used only 1/4 cup of sugar.  Any more, I fear it would have been too sweet, hence  the four star review.  Finally, I added the bacon back to the soup.  This was a nice, light but filling,  very flavorful soup.  It had almost a sweet  and sour taste to it.  What's more, because, I think, of the caraway seeds, it made the house smell lovely.--there aren't many cabbage dishes you can say that about.

This was a big hit at my house!  I skipped the olive oil and fried the onions, garlic, and caraway right in the grease left over from the bacon.  The caraway really sets this dish apart from similar recipes I have tried, never would have thought to add that myself. Delicious!

This recipe is a great fall recipe that uses up all the apples and cabbage! I found this recipe very sweet for my tastes though. I would personally omit the sugar completely. On the other hand, my husband liked it and did not find the sweetness a problem.

I made this soup to use up some of my fall crop of cabbage. It was very good and I'll definitely make it again. I didn't have any caraway seeds so I just left the.

I just made this, so yummy. I omitted the bread for a low calorie gluten free soup and it was still super filling and yummy!

I adjusted the sugar down to a scant 1/4 cup and it was delicious!  Just like sweet and sour cabbage.  Ps. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock.  Yum
