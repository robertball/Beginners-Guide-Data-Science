I hope you enjoy my family's stuffing as much as we do.  You can substitute chicken liver for the stuffing, if your bird comes without the liver.  I have made this many times with the recipe from this site, A Simply Perfect Roast Turkey, by Trudie.  These two are a winning combination.  Enjoy!  And thanks grandpop!
