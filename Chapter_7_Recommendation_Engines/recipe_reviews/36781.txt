Light, sweet, moist and lemony! These are a nice little snack! Since I wanted to bring out more of that wonderful citrus flavor I used 2 Tbsp. of lemon zest and a full Tbsp. of real fresh squeezed lemon juice. As a personal preference I also cut way back on the spices using only a pinch of each. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin lined with paper liners so I got a half dozen really big muffins (no way would this yield a dozen). They took 20 minutes at 400. I poked holes on top with a toothpick while warm and poured a bit of glaze over top of each.  The lemon glaze really gives these muffins a nice sheen and brings out even more of that great citrus flavor.

These were awesome.  I used 1 c. of yogurt, and substituted with whole wheat flour.  I also did not put any topping on them, and used all of the lemon zest and juice from a large lemon, and they were incredible.  Great recipe! Will definitely become a regular at my house.

I thought the muffins were very good and moist. They took  a little longer to cook then 18 min. Also I agree with others that I just got by with making 12, no way you can get 24 out of them. I added more zest and juice and a bit more sugar to make sure they weren't tart,( next time less sugar, wasn't needed) since I made them at my preschool with 6 3-5 yr. olds. THey were easy to make and were loved.But I was suprised that no one else said,  that the spices over took the flavor. You really hardly could taste the lemon at all. Next time I'll try them without the 3 spices, and add van. and maybe more of the lemon ingrediants. We didn't put on the glaze(frosting) I made them again at my preschool and more then doubled the lemon juice and zest. I put in the original amount of sugar and left out ginger, cinn. and nutmeg. Everyone loved them, including me.I did put in vanalli.

A few minor alterations made this recipe more flavourful and fantastic. I used 1+1/2 tsp. lemon juice, and 2+1/2 tsp. grated zest.  Insead of the icing, I made a sort of glaze with about 3-4Tbsp lemon juice and 1-3 Tbsp icing sugar. A bit runny at first, but it soaks in nicely.

Very good, sweet and moist.  I agree that they're more like cupcakes than muffins.  I used plain yogurt, but highly increased the lemon zest and juice, since we like things lemony.  Very nice.  They only make 1/2 the amount that it says they make.

This was a good muffin recipe---I subbed 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for the spices, and I didn't do the glaze on top, just sprinkled with pwdrd sugar. Thanks for the post! We enjoyed!

These were very yummy! I did add more lemon juice to the batter as I did not think they were "lemony"enough. Also could be because I used a "lemon cream pie" yogurt and did not make the icing. We still really like them.
Also, you will only get 12 muffins for sure.

Excellent! I didn't have any of the spices but I had fresh blueberries--and instead of plain or lemon yogurt, I had had vanilla yogurt on hand. Followed the rest of the recipe, but added a little more lemon. FANTASTIC.

Everyone loved these- big hit.  I cut way down on the spices, because I thought they would really overwhelm the lemon flavor- and I love lemon.  I added more lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. lemon extract.  I added more lemon juice to the glaze too.  Have requests to make this one again.

great taste, but if you really want 24 muffins, better double or triple the recipe.

Tastey.  Used 1/2 amount of sugar and could still use less.  Like the lemony flavor.  Used whole wheat - next time I'll use half whole and half white.

I made these muffins exactly like the recipe stated to make them.  They  had a slightly bitter after taste.  I even double checked to make sure I added everything!  You definitely have to double the recipe to get 24 muffins as I had enough batter for exactly 12.    You're better off trying the To Die For Blueberry Muffins, now those rock!

Easy recipe to make, made dozen nice size muffins, but the muffins were a bit dry. Added some poppy seeds since my family likes the lemon and poppy seed combo. OK muffins, not Wow!

These are pretty good. More like cupcakes than muffins. I upped the lemon juice to a tbsp. and added a little more to the icing, which meant I had to add a little more confectioners sugar.

Tried this recipe for the first time this morning, makes a lovely spring breakfast with some fresh coffee. I used the zest and juice of one whole lemon (instead of measuring out the recommended dose!), and it was a bit overpowering. Next time I will stick to the recipe amount!

yum! I used 2 tsp of lemon juice instead of .5 tsp - next time I will add even more. the mixture of spices is just right. next time I will add oatmeal to make it healthier and give more texture. loved the icing because it was really tart. I added yellow food coloring for a nice effect. the icing was a bit thick so I had to add a tiny bit of water. recipe yielded about 12 muffins. my kids loved them!

The texture is good but I really like lemon and these weren't lemony enough.  I will make again and double the amount of lemon zest which should make these the most excellent lemon muffins ever!

Very good.  I especially enjoyed the glaze which I felt gave a nicely contrasting flavor.  I added some fresh fruit and chocolate chips and it still turned out really well. I didn't end up with anywhere near 24 muffins, though.

Tasty muffins and low cal!  These were a lemony hit with friends and family.  Not as low cal as I originally thought because although it says the recipe makes 24 muffins, it really only makes 12.

These are delicious!!  I did not add the recommended cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg but I did add a dash of cinnamon and ginger.  For the yogurt I added one of lemon yogurt and one of honey Greek yogurt (I doubled the recipe as recommended and I got 22 muffins).  I added lots of lemon juice and zest because I LOVE lemon!! I will make these again!

This muffin is fabulous! I did many substitutions because I was running out of ingredients. The substitutions I have made include 1)cream cheese for yoghurt 2)more sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, honey and flour 3)no spices added because i had none 4)substituted wheat flour for plain flour. The result turned out to be amazing! the muffins tasted moist and like dense creamy custard lemon cake! i know i have turned this healthy recipe into a fattening dessert treat, but it's sure to make your taste bud happy =)

Funny how it works sometimes but I was really disappointed when I tried one of these shortly after it came out of the oven.  The next day, however, they were served at church fellowship and got rave reviews.

Really could be better. The muffins were okay, but the frosting was bad news. These sat around and dried out and ended up trashed. Sorry, Anna!

I made these after reading the recommendation. I doubled the receipt and got 30 standard size muffins. It's not lemony enough with the glaze on top, even then it's so-so. I made a second batch with the following change:  omitted the spices, except for the ginger, added 1tsp of vanilla, doubled the lemon zest and lemon juice and then added four drops lemon essential oil. Every thing else stayed the same and they turned out wonderfully lemony!  A nice mild compliment to this 'cupcakes' is the Sturdy whipped cream frosting.

I've made these several times. Moist and delicious but not nearly lemony enough for me. This last time I think I got it right. I used 1 cup nonfat Greek yogurt, added an extra tablespoon of sugar, used half the cinnamon and omitted the nutmeg. The best part... I squeezed two whole lemons (big ones) and then reduced the juice in a small pot until it was about 1/4 cup. I also added just a smidge of ginger paste and poppy seeds. Lemony achieved!

I didn't have lemon so I used a orange, it came out great. Use a little less nutmeg as that came be over powering and added a little zest to glaze and dried mulberries to muffin.

Quick and easy! I couldn't find any real yoghurt that was lemon, so I substituted blueberry. Did like everyone else said and punched up the lemon. Only added the ginger too. It turned out great! And I did get 24 muffins from my mini tin. Thanks!

I liked the recipe.
I used 1/2 cup sugar, plain yoghurt, a whole lemon for the zest, 
1 1/2 tsp lemon juice and a pinch of cinnamon.
The lemon flavour is there.
I did not use the icing/glaze.
However, I made 12 medium-size muffins not the 24 as indicated in the recipe.
:)

This is a great recipe!  I make it all the time.  It does only make about 12 muffins at most.  I loved the spices with the lemon.  I did add a bit more lemon zest to the recipe.  I also followed one of the previous reviews and made a sort of glaze with about 3-4Tbsp lemon juice and 1-3 Tbsp icing sugar. It soaks in nicely when poured over warm muffins.
