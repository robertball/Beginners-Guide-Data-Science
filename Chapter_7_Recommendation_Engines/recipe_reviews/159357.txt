This is fantastic!!!! We now use this on everything. Great on sandwiches. Try 1/2 mayo and 1/2 horseradish sauce for a kick.

This is awesome!!  I made the little smokies and decided to make this sauce to go with it, to take to a church function.  I've been very busy sending the recipe to people since.  Very nice.  Thank you!  Julie

Great sauce!  I tried the recommended dipping sauce for the Brown Sugar Smokies on this site but found that it tasted a lot like the mayo/ketchup sauce I mixed together for my fries as a kid.  This one is so much better!

Served this on New Years Eve with the Smokies and everyone loved it. Had chicken strips the next day and used the leftover sauce to dip them in, was really good. Thanks!

I made this dip for the Super Bowl & it was terrific. I had made one pkg of bacon wrapped smokies & cut this recipe in half & there was more than enough sauce. Very good!

this is soooo good! we used stubbs bourbon bbq sauce and dukes mayo. i think the better the ingredients you use, the better the outcome. they went so good with the brown sugar smokies but would also be so good with numerous things(chicken tenders, fries, on burgers) i can't wait to have another party or get together so i can make this (and the smokies) ;)

It might have been my fault for using a brown sugar bbq sauce and brown sugar, but this was a little too sweet. Mixed with the brown sugar on the smokies, it was a little over powering. Maybe a few drops of hot sauce or a plain bbq sauce would have been better. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for the superbowl along with some twice baked potatos. Everyone loved them. There were none left when the game was over. I followed the suggestions to coat the bacon and lil smokies in brown sugar and marinate in the fridge overnight. They were so good and addicting!
I mad ethe suggested sauce ut not spicey. Added a lil worchstashire sauce to it. 
Now everytime I see my nephew he asks me to make some more and bring them all to his house. haha
OH and I did not heed the suggestion of using a roast pan to catch the drippings of fat and was very sad I didnt. Dont ignore that suggestion, youl be glad you did when you go to get the pan out and the jucies DONT go all over the oven making a huge mess!

It was a tough one deciding between 4.5 and 5 stars...I usually only give 5 stars if I don't have to tinker with a recipe...but, I couldn't get just half a star to fill in and really, it's just pretty darn good. It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I added a little bit of onion powder (because I LOVE onions, especially with a bbq sauce) and celery salt to cut back the sweetness. That made it just perfect for me. Served with the Sausage Stuffing Balls for supper as we waited for the blizzard to roll in. Loved it!

This sauce was really good.  Everyone loved the smokies so much that they didn't have a chance to taste it though.

Has a strong mayo aftertaste. I added some lemon juice to jazz it up. That helped some. I haven't served it to my guests yet so maybe they will love it & then I can amend my review.

Loved this!  so simple, yet so good.  MUST also try the brown sugar smokies sauce that compliments these little tasty creatures.  Tip - trim some excess fat off bacon, or use center cut.  Definitely don't use thick cut.  Very very easy for a quick little snack!!

Like the recipe states, "Amount of ingredients is approximate, measure to your OWN taste".  I add more sugar to mine to make it perfect.

Really enjoyed this sauce, but in combination with the bacon wrapped lil smokies w/brown sugar...just a little too sweet.  It did taste good, but be prepared that it is sweet with sweet.

I used maple flavored bacon and dark brown sugar. They were an instant hit! I will be making these appetizers for years to come.

Very good sauce - compliments the Brown Sugar Smokies. I made half a recipe of the sauce and it was enough for a full recipe of the sausages.

You know the Brown Sugar Smokies were so good that nobody used the dipping sauce---but it was absolutely excellent with many other things.  Per a review; I added the horseradish and loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

I was even less a fan of this than I was the Bacon Wrapped Smokies  I made this for.  Just like the Smokies, this was rich and sweet.  Rich and sweet with rich and sweet is overkill.

I add some horseradish to taste, to give it just a little bite. After that, just know, you can't stop. They're so freakin' addicting! I think I ate 4 or 5 packages of lil smokies before I realized I was bogarting the appetizer!! Many were angry with me but that's cool. I went to bed with sweet smokie dreams!! LOL

Great tasting, but hard to serve at parties.  They need the "juice" to keep them warm in a chaffer or crockpot, but since the "juice" is just run-off bacon grease, they lack in presentation.

I thought the bacon wrapped smokies needed a little something extra, and this complemented the flavors well.  It was easy to throw together with ingredients that I had on hand.  If I make the smokies again, I'll make the dipping sauce as well.  If I'm short on time, I'll just dip them in bottled barbecue sauce.

I made this to go with the Bacon Wrapped Brown Sugar Smokies, and although easy it really didn't add anything to the already delicious smokies.  Everyone politely tried it once, then the rest just remained as the smokies were devoured all on their own. Make this as a different condiment for sandwiches, etc, but I wouldn't bother to make it for the smokies.

These were SO good!  I typically make brown sugar bacon for football games, but wanted to turn it up for this year's Super Bowl.  These were a hit!  We borrowed someone else's nickname of "pig candy" and called them "Pittsburgh Pig Candy."  :-)  Served with the sauce from this site.  Delicious!  Huge hit!

This was pretty good but the mayo was too much for us so we added a little more BBQ sauce.  Went really well with the Bacon Wrapped Smokies recipe on this site as promised.

Instead of bbq sauce i used chili and it was a great sauce but not needed.  I made it for a bunch of guys who ate the smokies as is and loved it.  I will definitely find another use for this simple but delicious sauce.

Served this Dipping Sauce with the Bacon Wrapped Smokies, excellent.  Our barbeque was actually more of a chipotle sauce, so the balance of sweet and spicy was perfect.  We also used leftover sauce as a dressing on our lentil burgers this afternoon; it is perfect!  Will definitely make the sauce again!

L O V E  this stuff. I add a spoonful more of light mayo and use Kraft sweet & spicy chipotle bbq sauce and splenda brown sugar. I've gotta go make a batch right now to go with some chicken for lunch - thanks so much for sharing this version.

The dipping sauce complemented the bacon wrapped smokies perfectly. However, there was a lot of sauce left over. I guess this means that I will be making the smokies again!

This was okay, but nothing special.  People didn't really seem to use it very much.

This recipe is great.  I used a mango habanenro barbeque sauce and cut the brown sugar in half.  It was awsome with a little kick.  Great for the get together with friends.  The kids even liked the sauce, not too hot but tasteful.

I made this as an appetizer for the Super Bowl. It was a nice compliment to the bacon wrapped smokies.

Yikes...must just be us, but this went uneaten.  I ended up pulling it off the table and replacing it with BBQ sauce.

In all fairness, though, no one at our party like the Bacon Wrapped Brown Sugar Smokies, either but they said they were better without this sauce.

Sorry

This sauce is amazing with the smokies. I even use the leftovers to dip other items or I spread it on bread. It’s so good!

To my surprise this sauce turned out to be a winner. I used BBQ sauce in place of chili sauce. The brown sugar smokies are good all by themselves, but the sauce adds to them.

We made these last night for a get together with a few neighbors. Did the overnight thing and crisping under the broiler as many have suggested.  Frankly, I found the marinade just a  sticky mess after overnight. Next time I will do the brown sugar just before the baking. I have done plenty of sugar coated bacon around jalapeno poppers, and they aren't as rock candy hard as these were. I am sure it was the crisping process.  Anyway, good recipe, but next time I will stay at 375 and flip 'em during the baking.

I've made them several times and they disappear extremely fast!  I'll make them again, for sure.

I thought it tasted too much like mayo. However I did use light mayo and light BBQ. I ended up adding twice the BBQ sauce and brown sugar.
