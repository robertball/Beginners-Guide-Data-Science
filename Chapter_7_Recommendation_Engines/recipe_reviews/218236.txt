I made this as the recipe states. I did rinse the brocolli in a colander and chopped up the bigger pieces before adding it to the casserole. Once we tasted this dish we felt that it needed eggs. I DO NOT like baked eggs so I fried an egg, sunny side up and placed it on top of this casserole in  individual bowls. It was very good with the egg added and also would be good without the egg for maybe a side dish at dinnertime.

Enjoyed this recipe. Used it as a breakfast casserole. Made one without the sausage for my vegetarian.

This recipe is more like a side dish.  It was very good, but it did seem to be missing something.  I made my own additions to fit things I had in the fridge and things I wanted to use up.  It was good, but next time it will not be the main dish.  I added 1/3 c sour cream and fried onions from a can to the top.  I also threw in a pinch of onion powder and garlic powder.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice and it was great both times! Simple comfort food for a cold busy day.
