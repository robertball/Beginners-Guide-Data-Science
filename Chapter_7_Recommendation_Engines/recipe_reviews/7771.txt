This cake is more of a spice cake and is more likely to be used during the holiday season.

I doubled this recipe and made a few changes.. I doubled the vanilla, added real vanilla bean, and took out the mace. I also used about half the lemon. It was a little time consuming seperating the eggs but it really made the cake light and fluffy. By doubling the recipe I got 3 eight inch cakes and two 14 inch cakes... which made a nice two tier birthday cake for my friend. Overall I was satisfied with the basic recipe, it was a very light and moist cake.. but the flavor was changed.

Just did a practice run of this recipe (10 servings) for my brother's wedding cake. The flavor of the mace is perfect since they were looking for a spice cake for their fall wedding (and they also love donuts - mace is the spice used in cake donuts). I forgot to split the sugar and ended up adding it all with the flour and butter, so my egg whip was a little wrong. But, the flavor is really wonderful, and I think the texture will be too, when done correctly. I baked this smaller batch for only 40 minutes and then let it sit in the oven (turned off) for about 15 mins.
