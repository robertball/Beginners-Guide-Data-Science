I would make this again! 
I however cooked it a little differently.
I used a glass round baking dish around 8 inch round
I put cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom (allergic)
I put cheddar cheese (mild) on top
And I used home-made mashed potatoes instead of boxed (recommend)
It was phenomenal!
I also cooked it on 360 degrees since there was no temperature on the recipe.

For those wondering about the missing oven temperature, Chelsey's  Personal Recipe tab has the original version of this recipe before submitting to AR. It states to "Bake at 400 degrees Farenheit for 15 minutes or until potatoes are lightly browned". Concerning size of individual pans, it states: "classic comfort food is made in 2x 6" cake pans, so everyone gets their own! For smaller portions, try making them in 4" cake pans." If baking in a large pan, the baking time would increase.

tasted great. Very easy to make (better than hamburger helper). But the recipe does not give oven temp. So I used 360 degrees which seem to work fine.

I added Himalayan salt,pepper and garlic combo to both mashed potatoes and the hamburger mixture. I baked at 400Â° for 25 minutes in a 8" glass pie pan. Broiled the shredded cheddar cheese. Tasted amazing!

5 stars - It isn't Julia Child cuisine but it's quick & easy, versatile & adaptable and very tasty.  I used fresh mashed potatoes & canned kernel corn.  I used left over cooked roast beef that I added into the onions step toward the end.  On top I used a mixture of cheddar and Asiago.  I'll make this again and freeze the pies.

This was quick and easy to make.  My hubby and nephew loved it.  I didn't make them individually, but still worked well.
