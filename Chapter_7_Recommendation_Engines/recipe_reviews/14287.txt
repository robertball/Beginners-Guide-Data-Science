Wonderful salad!  My husband had a bowl of it before it had even gone into the fridge to marinate and declared it delicious.  I couldn't find my balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead.  It was even better the next day.  I will definitely bring this to summer picnics and potlucks.  Next time I make it, which will be very soon, I'll use the balsamic and perhaps a touch of freshly ground pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good...this was the base idea and I made changes which turned out well.  Used only 1 green pepper (all I had), zuchinni instead of cucumber, 1 tomato, and 1/2 REGULAR onion; marble cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack (again didn't have it).  Did not have italian dressing mix, so I used a garlic balsamic vinegar that was hanging around in the fridge, 1/8 cup of it and 1/8 cup of the vinegar, and that was great.  But any store-bought, liquid italian dressing would work great too.  Everyone liked it!

My husband and I thought this was GREAT!  I am not a big fan of tomatoes, so I only used 1/2 what the recipe called for and doubled the cucumber, which I love.  Easy recipe to put in whatever you like.

This is pretty good. It's a great way to use up veggies. I made it as a side dish for club sandwiches.

YUMMMMM!  I love this salad!  Of course, I reduced the red onion by at least 1/2 because it was too strong 1st time.  It's great for summer get-togethers!

I am snacking on the leftovers of this WONDERFUL salad, as "we speak" - my "celebrity" and family company yesterday enjoyed it immensely.  The only change I made was to add red, orange and yellow peppers to the green one which of course, made for an extremely colorful presentation.  The taste was so fresh - wonderful recipe - thank you so much.

Very good and very easy to improvise to accomodate whatever is in the fridge. I used crumbled bleu cheese rather than shredded cheese and imagine that feta would be good as well. Easy and tasty, what more could you ask for?

Wonderful salad!  I thought at first it was a summer recipe, but actually looks fit for winter, too (lots of red and green.)  Flavor is great!  Husband and I both love it.  We will definately make it again...might add pepperoni next time..  Thank you!!

The dressing for this salad ws really good, but I would change the variety of vegetables next time, because the tomatoes made everything all slimy, and I wasn't liking the celery either. Otherwise...this was pretty good!

Garden Delight Haiku: "Wavered on my score. Closer to a 3.5. Thought it was okay." I skipped the monterey jack cheese all-together, and served this alongside a bowl of feta for anybody wanting a sprinkle - I was surprised that none of my party guests were interested in trying this, and one finally fessed up that it was the celery that put him off. W/ the time spent chopping, and letting it "marinate" longer in the fridge for the flavors to meld, I don't know if it'd be worth making again, but I actually enjoyed mixing the leftovers w/ romaine lettuce as an actual salad, since the vinegars and dressing mix jived really well that way.
