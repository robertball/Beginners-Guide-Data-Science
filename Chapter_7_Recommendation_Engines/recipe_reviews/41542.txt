Very good!  I scaled this to two servings for Hubs and me.  I made the tomato relish portion of this recipe, cutting the balsamic and olive oil in half.  I made it in the afternoon and let it sit at room temperature until serving.   And in order to save some calories, I just salted and peppered my chicken and seared it in a little olive oil, skipping the entire breading/frying process.  My way was quick and easy and I would definitely do it that way again.  Fresh basil and a good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar are key to this recipe.  Here’s a tip:  If you think your balsamic vinegar isn’t quite the quality it should be, you can add just a touch of brown sugar to it to give it more depth.

Because the other reviewers noted about the bland chicken, I added salt and pepper to the egg mixture and marinated the chiken for about an hour before covering them with the bread crumb. I also sauted the onion and let it cool before making the tomato basil mixture. It cuts down on the strong onion taste. Excellent and low carb meal.

This recipe is delicious!  My husband said it tasted like a gourmet chef prepared it.  He (obviously) loved it.

I agree with one of the other reviews--the chicken portion wasn't great, but the tomatoes/onion mix was wonderful!  I warmed it up in a skillet for a few minutes so it was a bit tender.  Next time, I'll probably make oven baked chicken and then top with the tomato mix.

Good sauce. Made night before then served over chicken breasts marinated in a lite Italian dressing. Ripe tomatoes, Vidalia onions and fresh basil are a good combo with grilled chicken. Served with a salad and garlic bread.

This was a great recipe - I made it and really liked it! I used seasoned breadcrumbs, then pan fried, but in only a few TBSP of olive oil and that was enough.  Instead of onion, I used garlic and when the chicken was done, I sauteed up the tomato mix for about 5-8 minutes to soften up the tomatoes and basil - we loved it warm.

I used a few variations, but didn't like the chicken part of it.  Loved the tomatoe and onion bit, but the onions got very strong after a little. Probably won't make it again.  At least no the chicken

We liked the simplicity of this recipe, but did find it bland based on the original recipe. We added garlic powder and thyme to the breadcrumbs (we used panko crumbs). We also added garlic and rosemary seasoning blend to the tomato mixture along with coming half the diced onion with a bit of butter until cooked through, to cut down on the raw onion bite and let it marinate in the fridge. We also warmed the tomato mixture in a skillet before topping the finished chicken breasts. So good.

super basic, easy to make recipe. saves well for leftovers -- make extra tomato basil mixture for bruschetta the next day. were missing a few of the ingredients but easy enough to sub without any notice.

Turned out to be excellent! It was a hit with the 5 at my table.
 I used olive oil in place of the eggs and the breading turned out fine.
 Definitely will make again!

This was definitely a delicious recipe. Making the chicken is simple and straightforward, as is the bruschetta. All I had on hand was aceto balsamic bianco, but I think it would taste better with regular balsamic. Seems healthy, although it does make your breath stink because of the bruschetta!

I made a few changes that don't matter. The major change is that I used a couple of fillets of cod instead of chicken, and it still turned out great with the tomato basil sauce. The basil was fresh from our garden so that helped I think. Will definitely make it again, next time with chicken.

Fast, easy and delicious! I scaled this down to two servings, and used dried basil instead of fresh. Served it over egg noodles with green peas on the side. Hubby loved it!

My boyfriend made this for me and I LOVED it. He did baby red potatoes as opposed to the macaroni and it couldn't have been any better. It's a simple and light meal, but it's visually pleasing and totally satisfying while not leaving you with that "heavy" feeling. Complimented with a nice glass of Malbec and a spoonful of love; definitely made for a restaurant experience while being cozy at home with the love. He definitely impressed me with this one ;-)
