The consistency was absolutely perfect, and the recipe is easy enough for a first time ice cream maker like myself. I used fresh lavender instead of dried though - for anyone else who decides to do the same, cut down to a teaspoon or two.

SO SO SO good!  I've made my fair share of ice cream and this is up there with the most amazing consistencies I've come across.  Smooth, creamy, and wonderful.  The flavor is close to perfection but it really is screaming for the addition of a little bit of vanilla at the end.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe in my back pocket!

This was my first attempt at ice cream in decades!  And hands down it was easy and delicious!  Smooth, creamy, and just a hint of lavender and honey. It was great!  We used our own honey from our hives and it was sweet but not overpowering. Great recipe!
