This was really tasty and perfect for me since I have a whole box of mangoes to use up! I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed it as a dip with some tortilla chips, but I do think this would go really well with chicken. I just love that sweet/spicy combo, and the longer it sat the better it tasted, IMO.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Chef John!

This was amazing I used Asain Chili Sauce since I didn't have the paste and used Cilantro paste, comes in handy if fresh in not available.  Definitely will make this again soon used it over Grilled Mahi Mahi.

OMG! It was so goooood! I topped saut√©ed shrimps with the sauce as an appetizer. The only changes I've made are substituting lemon juice for rice vinegar and fresh parsley for cilantro (my husband's not a fan of it). I didn't use any garlic and Thai chili pepper. Definitely will make this again. Thank you so much Chef John for all your hard work in bringing these amazing recipes to our kitchen. David and I are big fans of yours!

I have a mango tree and mangoes are falling like there is no tomorrow. So, I searched up mango sauce and this was the first recipe to come out. This is so delish!!! I had to change it up a little since I didn't have all the ingredients. I had unseasoned rice vinegar which I seasoned with Italian seasoning. Then I added Thai chili sauce, some red pepper flakes, the mango, green onions, cilantro, and lemon juice. OMG! So yummy! I think this would be a great combo with ceviche. Thank you for the great recipe!

I just made it!! I used it as a marinade instead of just a sauce. I haven't cooked my fish yet but so far the mango sauce alone is so good

A real crowd pleaser. I should have made more. Chef John's video is definitely helpful as usual. Made the recipe as written. Had to go to a local Asian grocery to find the Thai chili pepper. Served with pork tenderloin and shrimp appetizers cooked on the Big Green Egg.

It tastes great. American mangoes are a bit rubbish, but I was fairly pleased with the results I got rehydrating dried mangoes from the Philippines. One pack is just the right amount, I think.

I couldn't find the Thai chili so I used jalapenos, and I didn't have any citrus fruits on me so I put in a dash of lemonade, which I don't think hurt.

I absolutely loved this sauce.  I highly recommend you watch the video and slice the mango as he does.  It really does make a difference.  I served this on top of cedar plank mahi mahi and it was to die for!  Thank you Chef John!  Once again you do not disappoint.

Excellent, I used it on grilled  mahi mahi and it was a huge hit. The trick is to let the salsa sit the in the fridge for at least an hour. I noticed the flavor were more intense.

Loved this relatively simple recipe that is so versatile and becomes the centerpiece of the meal. Used it on grilled halibut first night, grilled salmon the next and just ate the remainder straight out of the bowl with a spoon. I coated the fish with olive oil and a sprinkle of chili powder before grilling which complemented the mango sauce nicely. I could not find the Thai pepper so I used a Serrano and left about half of the seeds/membrane in to make sure there was enough kick. That seemed to work perfectly.

A friend made this and served it over Mahi Mahi, it was excellent, will definitly be making it at home.
