Finding a mocha mint powder substitute is difficult, and the photo is misleading as this is not a layered brownie as shown.  However, if you like mint and cake-like brownies, they do come out delicious! Land O'Lakes has a mint hot chocolate powder that can be used.  I found it in my local grocery store.

These came out really yummy & moist!  I used fat-free cream cheese, swiss mocha instant coffee powder (because I couldn't find the mocha mint in the store), & reduced the amount of margarine called for in the original recipe.

I bake for a living and these are a best seller. Unfortunately for me Folgers has done away with there Mocha Mint Mambo that was my main ingredient.  I have yet to find a substitute.  I think I might try swiss mocha and add creme de mint.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

These brownies are excellent. The only thing I might change next time I make them, is to use a frosting instead of melted chocolate chips for the topping - I found it was too hard and didn't cut very nicely.

These were very good.  Except I added my own personal flair to them.  I could not find the mocha mint powder so instead I used reese's peanut butter cup baking pieces.  I also used vanilla frosting instead of chocolate chips.  They came out great.

They were very moist, but weren't up to my standard for a potluck.  The picture looks NOTHING like they turned out.

I usually have wonderful luck with box or homemade brownies, but these turned out awful.  They were dry and tasteless. I took them to a picnic and didn't realize how bad they were before I served them.  I learned two things - always taste test before serving and read the ratings first.

Maybe I did something wrong, but my brownies came out dry and no mint flavor hardly at all.  I did have to use Mocha mint instant coffee because I couldn't find what the recipe called for.

These did not turn out like anything remotely close to resembling a cheesecake. Fortunately the thick layer of chocolate on top gave it some sweetness. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE
