I just got a new air fryer and had a head of cauliflower in the fridge so this was my first air fryer experience.  I shook it a couple of times during cooking and when I checked at 15 minutes it was burned-beyond edible!  I'm thinking this is way too long on the time.  I'm fine with some brown on the pieces but black is too done!

I used mild Chili Powder instead of Paprika.  Flavor was amazing. Rest of recipe was the same.

Delicious! Watch carefully, as if you are using smaller florets they will be almost burnt crispy at 15 minutes. We loved this recipe and will use it frequently. Three cloves of garlic sounds like a lot, but it definitely not over-garlicky. Delicious!

I love cauliflower and in the air Fryer it was quick, easy and delicious.  I substituted olive oil for the peanut oil as I didn't have any.

So happy to find a new way to make cauliflower. I am not a big fan of cauliflower and it's taste but have found that roasting it makes it a game changer when trying to eat healthy. Definitely a recipe that can be customized to what flavor of dish you want to serve along side. Going to try adding buffalo sauce after cooking the next time. Thanks for sharing.

I have a similar recipe to this so I knew it wouldn't disappoint. My original recipe called for smoked paprika but it was pretty potent and I panicked and changed it up to regular paprika. I was tickled pink when I saw this recipe because it confirmed to me that great minds think alike. Smoked paprika it is! Great recipe and 5 stars all the way!

So delicious! I did add five minutes to the time, as suggested in the Cook’s Note. Maybe I’ll use a bit less salt next time, but we gobbled this up in no time!

Great way to change up cauliflower.  Only change I made was using coconut oil because that's what I had on hand. Absolutely delicious!

First time with air fryer.  Ended up over cooking as I took the "add three minutes if cold" to mean if the machine was indoors.  My mistake.  I also cooked 2.5 cups instead of 4.  I did not adjust the time downward so my outcome was shall we say "deeply browned".  First time for everything.  Next time, I will use more of the ingredients and cut down on the cook time.  I will plan on 12 minutes and add more as needed based upon visual inspection.

15 minutes in the air fryer and it turned out perfectly. Right amount of crispy and crunch. Mixed in a sliced red pepper.

This was delicious.  Just like any recipe- time and temperature may need to be adjusted based on your appliance and the size of your florets.  The flavor was great.  Texture was perfect.  Crispy but not greasy.  The smashed garlic was a nice touch.  Different garlic experience than just pressing it or mincing it.

My husband, and I did not care for this one.  Maybe it was us.  We will not make it again.

It was ok, but not good enough to make again.
