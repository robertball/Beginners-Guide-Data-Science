A healthy, flavorful, light dish. Followed the recipe exactly. Did the red peppers, (lightly oiled with olive oil) under the broiler before chopping. Overall, the recipe was very easy to do. Highly recommended!

This is the first time I've ever had goat cheese and first let me say YUM!!  This is a GREAT vegetarian dish (unless you don't do dairy) and you could easily add some steak or chicken to these to bulk them up.  Very light and a rather "guilt free" dish as well.

I made these with one minor change I used Light Balsamic dressing with EVOO vs. the Balsamic and Olive oil seperate.  I made them for a 4th of July party about 3 hours ahead of time and they turned out great (next day not near as good)!  I didn't make my own peppers (they were costly fresh) but the jarred were great.  

I do recommend having toothpicks on hand though ~ helps keep them together.

I used baby spinach instead of baby mixed greens, because that was what I had. I'm not sure the roasted peppers added much to the wrap. Thanks!
