Such an easy and wonderful recipe!  As always, I added some stuff, but not because it needed it, because I love the stuff I added, celery and celery salt (instead of the regular stuff)  And I added some cooked shrimp too.  When I was ready to add the seafood, mushrooms, onions, and celery, I transferred it to the crock pot, and set it to warm.  That's just hot enough to make it hot, without bringing it to a boil.  Delicious Pam Rosterman.  Thank you!

I was a little disappointed in this for two reasons.  I think the mushrooms should be sauteed in advance because at the medium low setting they were not getting cooked.  Also, I have never used canned oysters before this and will never again.  They have a very strong fishy taste...fresh oysters do not.  With that said, I think if I were to try this again it would be with those changes.  It was otherwise easy to prepare and the base was delicious.

This was alright for me, a little bland. Not bad, but with seafood being so expensive I probably won't make again.

I made this a few days ago for dinner and thought it was a nice way to use up some canned seafood and have a quick and tasty soup!  I followed the recipe as written, except that I swapped out one of the cans of clams for a can of lump crab meat.  My guests thought this was tasty, and my sister even asked for seconds (she's a pretty picky eater).  I think I would definitely like to try duplicating this recipe with fresh seafood because I think it will help the overall flavor and body of the soup.  This was my first time using canned seafood for anything, and I was super impressed with the seafood itself.  Overall, a very good soup.

Super easy and delicious.  I chose to use 1 can of crab meat and 2 cans of tiny shrimp instead of the oysters just for our family's preferences.  I followed reviewer's idea and sautéed the mushrooms and onions first and loved the texture and flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

I added lobster, shrimp, clams and squid, all finely chopped. I sautéed the pepper and mushrooms together. Deglazed the pan with sherry, then added the milks, etc. I used an emersion blender to purée the mixture, then added the seafood to slowly cook in the hot milky broth. Delicious!

This was very delicious and easy. I added 2 6.5oz cans of tiny shrimp drained and went heavy on the hot sauce. Used Gringo Bandito Super Hot instead of Tabasco. 10 stars!

Hats off to the author of the recipe. Consider substituting fat free evaporated milk, fresh oysters, and fresh (or frozen) minced clams--fabulous bisque!

I used salmon and salad shrimp in mine. I also added garlic and my husband and I loved it! I used a bit of olive oil to sear the meats and then added the rest of the ingredients. I also had to thicken the broth a bit.

Awesome recipe, thank you!
I did sauté the mushrooms first with one clove of garlic.
I used pre-cooked shrimp and fresh littleneck clams.
I steamed the clams in wine before adding to the soup.
Will definitely make again!
Don't let it boil - mine started to a little right at the end and the wine and milk started to separate :(

This was pretty good. Nice flavor. Don't do oysters so I added some cooked shrimp just to heat through before serving. I might make this again and maybe experiment a little.

This recipe was great.  Made it for a birthday party and people came back for more.  Served with crusty French bread.  Delish.

It did not say how many it served. but only that it was 6 cups. For the two of us,I made the whole thing. It's wonderful but I have left overs and will enjoy them later. I had asparagus on the side.
I grew up on seafood in Florida and have lived in Colorado now for 
54 years.  Buffalo is good but this is great. 

In the butter,I did saute 1/2 red and 1/2 green pepper, mushroon, and 
onion. Also used small can of evaporated milk instead of half & half, and used Basil instead of bay leaf.   Betsy Gielissen

so simple and so gooood!!!  no leftovers - took a total of 30 minutes to make.  i didn't use mushrooms, we don't like them in our house.  i switched out the seafood too...i used lobster that i had in my freezer and a few shrimp.  sweet, rich and creamy.
