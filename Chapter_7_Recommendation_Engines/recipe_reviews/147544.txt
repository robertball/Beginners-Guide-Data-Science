I have never tasted a Bolognese sauce before restaurant or otherwise. This was extremely fast to make and I followed the recipe and it's entirety. I chose to actually use the harissa because I know it involves a lot more ingredients then just cayenne pepper. Perfect simple and fast!

Good quick easy recipe for bolognese. I have had better but was short on time and had a craving recently so tried this and was satisfied. Used veal instead of beef and had no harissa on hand so substituted with cayenne. Good flavor would def make again in a pinch. Mascarpone is a must in this one!
