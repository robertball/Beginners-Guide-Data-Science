This has been our family's favorite holiday cookie for 25 years! It is a great cookie exchange cookie...quick to make because they don't spread very much..so you can bake many of them on a single sheet..great with coffee.

So good, but add a teaspoon of almond extract to the dough for better almond flavor.

These were really fun to make and my daughter thought it was really yummy! I was in a sugar kick so i added more sugar to the dough.  Baked it for about 12 minutes.  The 2nd time I made it,  I rolled the dough in a log, flattening the sides, wrapped in siran, chilled,  then sliced.  I thought it was much easier doing it this way.

Fun fact: "Finska kakor" means "Finnish cookies" BUT in Swedish :P "Suomalaisia kakuja" would be the Finnish translation. Def reminds me of the old country. Holla!
