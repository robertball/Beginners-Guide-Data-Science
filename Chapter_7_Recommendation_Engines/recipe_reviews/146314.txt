I put this sauce together in my food processor, just dumped the mangos half in there and let the processor do the dicing and blending; and then heated the whole thing in the microwave instead of boiling it on the stove.  I was impressed with the flavors.  I thought they blended well.  I poured the entire thing over an angelfood cake, and my guests raved.  I would make this again, maybe over ladyfingers and ice cream next time.

My family really enjoyed this sauce. I added a little chipotle powder and I poached Tilapia in it once it was heated. We have now made this twice with fish and we're trying it tonight with chicken and tropical rice.

This was great! I served it over chicken coated in baked, crisp plantains, sauteed white onion, sauteed green bell pepper and jasmine rice. Fantastic sauce!

This was a great sauce over some chicken sauteed in hot pepper-infused olive oil and pumpkin ravioli. I did add two chipotle peppers when I pureed the mango which added a nice spice. However, I think I'll cut back on the chipotle peppers when using the infused olive oil in order to taste more of the coconut and mango. Thanks for sharing "Crazy Chef"!

This was interesting.  I think that I would have loved it, except that maybe I just don't like mango?  The texture is smooth and creamy, and it is wonderfully easy to make.  We tried it over baked chicken, (didn't like that much) mixed with brown rice (better!) and over vanilla ice cream (hmm...yum?...hmmm...)  If you know that you like mango, I think you'll definitely enjoy this.  If you're not sure, try it.

This was a pretty good sauce. I cut the mangos up and put them in the food processor with the rest and made it that way, super easy! Great over BBQ chicken, served with rice and black beans.

This was an easy flavorful sauce, I did however add some rehydrated ancho chili's and a jalapeño, white pepper, 1/2 lemon juice/zest, harassia powder, smoked salt and some curry powder hit with an immersion blender and was the base for my chicken curry.  I also used a little sour cream instead of heavy crème...  Top w/ cilantro.

My entire family including my dog loved this sauce.  We placed it over brown rice with chicken.  It almost taste like a smoothie drink when it comes out of the blender.
