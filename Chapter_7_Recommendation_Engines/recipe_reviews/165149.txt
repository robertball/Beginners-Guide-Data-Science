I can't believe that there really is just one review at this delicious pie ... It's the best citrus pie i ever had, better than the Lemon & Lime pie! Thank you very much! I'll make this one again!

This was wonderful!  It would be great on a hot summer day or night as the citrus is very refreshing!  I actually had to make this twice as the first time I assumed the filling would set after cooling.  Only later did I realize I needed to cook the filling until it is about the consistency of pudding. Practice makes perfect~!   It was awesome once I cooked the filling long enough!

Fantastic Recipe! Perfect as written. I do think I will try all Orange Juice next time just to make the orange flavor even stronger (we love orange flavored anything). I loved the addition of the orange segments too. This will absolutely be a repeat at our house. Thank you for sharing!

My orange pie is an orange "soup"! The bottom layer of the pie did not set. I followed this recipe very carefully, including step 2, which instructs you to cook the mixture until thick and bubbly "about 5 minutes" on medium heat. At the end of five minutes, mine wasn't at all thick, so I added five more minutes until the mixture had a least thickened a bit, but I mistakenly thought it would set in the oven or when it cooled. NOT SO. Those minutes on the stovetop were the only opportunity to thicken the bottom. Knowing this, I should have waited until the mixture had a good pudding texture, however long that took.

Made this for a potluck. It was one of the first desserts to go. Everyone loved it. Very fresh and different without being too way out there or weird.

This was one of the best pies I've ever had.  Next time, I'll probably add a bit of orange extract to boost the orange flavor, but it still knocks your socks off without it.  We used fresh squeezed tangerine juice in place of the orange.  This pie is going into regular holiday rotation at my house.

I just made this pie last night and it is wonderful.  I added the diced orange, and it is a nice treat.  Filling set perfectly! After this I think I will try different juices and see how they turn out, using this recipe.  Hmmm Maybe Pineapple meringue pie??  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not sure why, but my filling mixture never got thick at all even though I followed the instructions word-for-word. I then put it in the fridge hoping that it would thicken up, but it didn't.

Interesting switch up from lemon meringue. I didn't particularly like it, but my family members who are a little shy of the strong citrus in lemon pie much approved of this alternative.

I thought it was too sour. I think the next time I will not use the orange segments and add a little more sugar.

My husband and I were watching the pie contest on Food Network and we both started craving pie.  I am the baker and he is the taster.  My husband found this recipe and went to the store to get the ingredients so that I could make it for him right away.  After he finished his first slice he asked if I was going to rate this pie! He said "It is 5 stars in my book!"  I have never seen him so excited about a pie.  The pie is rich and tangy, but oh so good.

I made this pie and it turned out wonderful.  However I was quite disappointed in the orange flavour.  I think maybe the problem is  that there is too much lemon in this which is a stronger ingredient.  Maybe less, if no lemon juice and a little more orange juice would fix it.

I absolutely love this recipe! Tradition at our house is late luncheon on New Year's Day and guests are asked, if willing, to bring a New recipe they've wanted to try but haven't - I've been wanting to try Orange Marange pie for a few years, so this year was my chance - it tastes and looks yummy! I even threw some orange zest into the marange topping, which was also a first for me! Thank you for sharing this recipe and helping me start the New Year off on a great note! Huzzah!

This was SOOOOO good! Was worried about the filling as it wasn't thickening up like it was supposed to - took a look away from it to get my margarine cut up and when I turned back to the pot, it was ready! Patience is a virtue. Also, this is the first time I have made meringue. I had my metal bowl and my beaters for my mixer in the fridge overnight to ensure they were cold in time to make the meringue part. It took a long time to get the stiff peaks to form, and even then, I think maybe I should have beaten them even longer. Next time, I will keep the mixer on high speed the whole time since I think the problem might have been that I didn't incorporate enough air into the egg whites fast enough. I can't wait to make this again, though!

I had a bunch of tangerines and oranges to use so I used all juice for my pie filling. It wasn't quite tangy enough for me so I added the juice of one lime at the end. When I make it again (and I will!) I'll definitely use orange and lemon. It set up great and is delicious!

I have made this pie 4 times and I'm getting ready to make it again. Everyone has loved it. However, I prefer it without the orange pieces in the pie. I believe it weeps more when I add them. Hats off jowolf2. Do you have a recipe for lemon meringue pie?

We have an orange tree that produces prolifically every year. I have been searching for an orange pie recipe. This recipe is great! The only thing I would do differently next time is slightly reduce the lemon juice and replace that amount with orange juice it was a bit lemony tasting but still my husband loved it and the orange flavor was present.

Amazing orange merengue pie! Just like my grandma's and with actual measurements, as opposed to my family's "just keep adding until it tastes right" way of making it.

this  was my first meringue  pie and it turned out perfect.  My husband  is not a big sweets eater but he loved this pie.  He has already requested  another!  His mom (the queen of the meringue  pies) also loved it.  This recipe  was simple and delightful, I'll be making it again soon.

Made this with some tangelos picked from a friend's property. Brought the pie to a Christmas party for work and it was a hit! So smooth, not overly tart. It was a bit runny but that was probably my fault- I don't think I let the crust or the filling cool enough before putting the meringue on top. The custard filling and the meringue held together just fine but there was extra juice that sloshed about and got things a little sticky. But I forgot about that when I tasted how wonderful the pie turned out. Will be making this again!

Made it with a gluten free graham style crust, and everyone loved it! Did not add the orange pieces. Yes, you must cook fillings until thick, as others have said.

I give this a 5 for flavor and ease to make. Only thing is I thought  it was odd to let the curd cool before putting the meringue on, but  I did and the meringue slid off the pie when we cut it. It didn't fuse together.  Isn't going to stop us from eating the pie because it's delicious!  I will make this again.

This pie was fantastic. I made it for my dad's birthday, and everyone LOVED it.  I made a couple of changes to it, just to make it my own.  I used all orange juice, instead of using the 1/2 c lemon juice.  I made a graham cracker crust instead of the regular pastry crust.  And, because I am not a big fan of meringue, I made a sweetened whipped cream for the top. AWESOME!

Tried this last month.. was DELICIOUS!  Making it again tonight.. Only change I'm making is serving it with whipped cream instead of meringue.. AND making it as separate/individual tarts.

Wow, what can I say what a great recipe. I made two of them which was a good thing the first one was gone as soon as my family were allowed to eat it. So have one more for today for dessert and I am sure it will be devoured in the same fashion. I doubled the orange zest though and I did add the orange chunks which is why I think this has to be one of the best pies I have eaten.

So amazing! I was skeptical but it turned out perfect the first time and the whole family loved it. Will definitely be making it again.

The only thing I did different from the recipe was I used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar.

Great tasting recipe all around. Only thing I thought was that the meringue was a bit too sugary sweet. I added about a quarter of an orange's juice to it and it turned out perfect.

Great flavor and change of pace from lemon. I cut lemon juice in half as another reviewer mentioned and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

So good! Mine ended up tasting like a really rich lemon pie which was fine because my husband and I both love lemon anyway and I only found this recipe because I had oranges to use.  I think if I make it again and I want it to be more orangey, I will add in the orange pieces which I omitted this time.
