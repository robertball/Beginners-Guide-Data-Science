I love cherry season. I used bing cherries and the jam was so good. I cut the cherries in half, removed the seeds then cut the halves again. I wanted the cherry pieces large enough to see. Oh, by the way, do as I didn't and wear gloves to pit the cherries, I do believe my finges will forever be stained with the cherries, but it's cherries, and well worth the red fingers. I have a large canning funnel which I use when putting the food into jars to help keep the rims of the jars clean, which is very important, as Pepper stated. The jam was excellent; the flavor is very definitely cherry and the color is beautiful.

This is an easy & delicious cherry jam recipe.  At first, I was turned off by the "sweet" description, but I couldn't seem to find a better recipe online.  I finally made this one, and I'm glad I did.

I cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3 cups.  It made the jam tart and perfect.  I used 1.5 packages of pectin instead of 2 because I don't like my jam to be really firm like store-bought jellies.  I think 1.5 was still too much, and next time I'll just do 1 packet.  Because I cut out 1 cup of sugar, I only got 1 pint of jam.  I kind of want to make more now.

The jam was easy, and I loved the simple ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This jam was incredibly easy. I followed the instructions--they were very precise which was a relief for me......I'm not a canning rockstar. This jam was not only beautiful in the jar, it was delicious. One of the best jams I've made yet. It's like summer in a jar.

You should turn your jam jars upside down after filling and sealing for the first 10 - 15 minutes of cooling to prevent the fruit from staying at the top of the jar. Cut the apple juice and lemon in half for a better set. I used 2 pouches Certo with 4 cups pitted quartered cherries, 6 cups sugar. Hope this helps...

Being a born and raised Calgarian, cherries from a tree are something that is bought, not grown. What I do have are two bushes of Nanking cherries, those teeny little red berries that are more pit than fruit, but oh so tasty. So I picked my Naking bushes clean... And got me about a whole cup once pitted... I went to the farmers market and made up the difference with some BC cherries and the results were fabulous! I probably  didn't even need to go through the process of canning the jam since we're consuming it faster than a Cullen can run ;)

Tasted wonderful!  This was my first time making jam ever so I was really worried that it wouldn't turn out.  I added pineapple juice instead of the apple juice because that was all I had, but it had great flavor!

I used the fresh picked cherries we had just brought back from B.C. and this recipe totally didn't work for me.  It's more a syrup than a jam and while it tastes great on pancakes, is not what I was hoping for in a jam recipe.

I made an account here to review this mostly just to add a note for the negative reviews declaring that this is a Syrup recipe. It's very unfair of you to chastise a recipe because you didn't follow it properly. I have experience with jam. If you ended up with a syrup following this recipe it's because you didn't follow the recipe. Period. You tried to double it up most likely, and the pectin doesn't like that. Or you let it boil with the pectin for too long. I've made this and several recipes very similar to it each year for the past few years. I always follow the recipe closely and I always end up with "jam". My friend followed the same recipe but he wanted to make up eight jars at once instead of four so he doubled the recipe, and he ended up with syrup. 

I just didn't like seeing the one star review complaining about syrup when I know 100% that it was their own doing.

After a lot of pitting cherries, this jam turned out beautifully. I did the recipe as stated and the other reviewers were right saying that it was pretty separated (cherry parts at the top and thin cherry jelly on the bottom of the jars). The taste was unbelievable - sour, sweet, and very cherry! If you haven't canned jam before, this is a great place to start thanks to the detailed instructions. A good way to use up some free cherries from the neighbour.

Nice and easy. I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and ginger to make it a little better. Mmmm...Cinnamon Heart Jam!

I added pure Almond extract which put this Jam over the top! I also used low sugar Ball pectin which was great without all of the sugar!  It cuts the amount of sugar by ½!

This was my first attempt at jams &  jellies since my husband was diagnosed with diabetes. I used Suregel for low-no sugar recipes and used Stevia granulated sweetener.   It turned out great. And, I believe, this is the first time I've ever made a recipe that resulted in the predicted amount of servings, which was great also, because I made a triple batch right off the bat.  Having to clean & sterilize extra jars would not have worked out at all.  Thanks for a simple, wonderful recipe!

Sweet cherry season in Michigan is my favorite!!  This recipe is perfect to extend that time of year and I always triple or quadruple it.  To personalize the jam for the chocolate lovers in my life, I substituted chocolate porter stout for the Apple juice and added a  chopped Hershey bar into the hot fruit.  I cut down on the sugar by a third (2 cups for each batch of fruit, not 3), since Bing cherries are plenty sweet already.  Then I can as usual.

While the flavor was good. My jam didn't set. It is syrup. I think adding the extra apple juice made it much too runny for it to set properly. Disappointed.

This recipe is super easy to follow and the jam turned out so delicious that we've been eating it out of the jar! The most difficult and time-consuming part was to pit and chop the cherries. :)

Doubled the recipe. It was my first time making jam. It turned out delicious with great color. It took a long time to remove the stems and pits of the cherries, but it was worth the work. I would definitely make this recipe again, would try the  sugar free recipe, too! The photo I included shows the cherry jam up front with blueberry syrup in the jars in the back. Made them both in the same day. Thanks for the great cherry jam recipe! Already shared it with my FB friends!

Tastes absolutely delicious! Cut the recipe into 1/4, and subbed the powdered pectin for 1 package of certo liquid pectin. It turned out great.

I went a little nuts buying cherries as soon as they came in season and the prices dropped- I ate and ate and ate and ate until I simply could not eat any more, yet I still had loads of cherries hanging out that I didn't want to go to waste.  This recipe was the perfect solution- the most time consuming part was pitting the cherries, which really would have been made easier with a pitter I'm sure.  Other than that everything came together quickly and easily and produced a delicious jam!

My husband helped, he pitted the cherries.  So very good.  Did not change a thing!   Yummy!

Goodness Gracious, this is so good.  I made it exactly per the recipe except that I took the advice of a reviewer who decreased the sugar to 2 cups; glad I did.  Went right out and bought some ice cream to put this over.  I don't do canning, so just put this into a tall container for the fridge - for immediate consumption!

This was my first try at canning anything! The best low sugar cherry jam! My mentor loves it also!

Love, love the addition of the lemon. Even added a bit more. Brightens up the jam and I love that touch of tang. Much more juicy than jammy and a perfect compliment to Greek yogurt. I did cut back the sugar by a cup. My cherries were very in season and naturally sweet.
