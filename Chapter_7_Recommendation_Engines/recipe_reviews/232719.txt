Almost perfect first time! I just watched the video for the first time - saw why I had to use a knife to make pockets! If you do not smush bubbles you will not get a good pocket! I used an electric fry pan @400 degrees as alternate cooking method (from another review thank you!). I used 100 degree oven to rise dough for 2 hours. Browning was faster using electric pan than times in instructions - went by browning color. Flavor so good I put a little butter in one and had for a yummy snack!

I tried making pita bread in the past and every time I failed miserably so of course I was skeptical that I could successfully prepare pita bread using your instructions (It's not you---it's definitely me). Call me a bit overdramatic, but I literally teared up when my first batch came off the stove browned to perfection and actually sturdy enough to open as a pouch. I guess I just had to watch someone else make them before giving it another shot. Thanks from the bottom of my heart. This is now my go-to recipe from now on. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a batch of falafels to make to go along with these bad boys.

SO TASTY! I see a lot of complaints about non-puffs, well, mine didn't either but they tasted better than any flatbread I've ever bought in my life. I started smooshing the bubbles on the last few I cooked, and got much better results. You gotta smoosh! It spreads the air through the sealed pita and really helps with that pocket.

As for the pro-bakers, that works, but grilling it just gives it that to die for flavor that you just can't get any other way!

It is a simple and fool proof recipe. I hand kneaded the dough because I don't have the dough mixer attachment. It took me 15 minutes to knead the dough and I used about 2 table spoon flour which I sprinkled on my kneading board. All the pitas puffed and formed pocket. Since I don't portion equally, I noted pockets of the thinner bread is more fragile than the thicker bread. I suggest if you want to form good pocket for filling, make a thicker bread. But if you want to serve as taco shell, make a thinner bread. I had it for my brunch to go with mayo and fish. Fold it up, just like soft taco. Yum....yum.

I follow the same steps except the last one. I preheated the oven to 500 degrees. Placed the rounded dough in a heavy baking sheet, as much as it takes (depending on the size). Baked for few minutes (about three minutes depending on your oven) Got the bread out and put on  towel for few minutes.

Really tasty bread. Mine didn't puff up like the video but I didn't have a stand mixer to make these. I did get a pocket, but I had to sort of help open it up a little..

This was a wonderful recipe! The dough was so simple to make and I easily found a way to make and eat dinner while waiting the two hours for it to rise. When I placed the pitas in my skillet it puffed up so nicely!! I was expecting a HUGE fail but now I've completely fell in love with these pitas and will be making them every weekend! Did I mention they tasted amazing too? Light, fluffy, and so bread-y, they were exactly what I was looking for in a pita!

I love bread. Lately I've been loving flat breads, andy I've been trying to eat less sugar, so I was happy to try this recipe and stop having to buy pita bread every week. Watching the included video is extremely helpful. I folowed the recipe, and used my kitchen aid with the dough hook and my pita turned out perfect. I'm using this as a starter recipe and will probably make changes depending on my mood. But will definitely make this as is again.  In a lot of the reviews I noticed people have been having trouble getting the poof, and I think rolling the dough thinner might help with that.  My son was "helping" me and the ones he rolled out were a bit on the thicker side and although they tasted delicious, they didn't poof and i have to cut a pocket in. Once he wandered off, I rolled the dough to be thinner and they all proofed! Best pita ever.

Great recipe! The only thing I can't figure out is how Chef John rolls out the pitas with as little flour as he does. My rolling pin wants to stick. But, the flavor is great! People, if yours aren't puffing up, it's not that big of a deal. Cut your pitas into halves, and then run a paring knife down the middle of the insides, being careful not to cut through to the outside. I haven't had a wasted pita yet by doing it this way. Just go slow and be careful with your knife.

I followed this recipe to the letter and my pitas didn't puff up. I guess I'm going to have to find another pita recipe.

Make this all the time and it's great! Better than buying at the store because you know everything that's going into it. I also made this with whole wheat flour, substituting 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for every cup of white flour, and adding more while kneeding if necessary. Turned out great!!!

I got this recipe to work, but not without its fair share of trial and error. The dough recipe itself is alright, if not a tad on the salty side. But you know in step 8 where it says to pat them into rounds an inch thick? That's , flatten those puppies until they're pancakes and then some, because the shape they are when you put them in the pan is they shape they'll come off in. Mine didn't puff up at all. Also, I don't know what you're stove is like, but at "medium high" heat, my stove burned it in 2 minutes.  I wound up cooking them at the 3/10 setting. To figure those two things out, I sacrificed a quarter of my yield. I also highly doubt that the half hour wait in step 7 and the 5 minute wait in step 8 are at all necessary. To be fair, I'll admit that I mixed the dough by hand, due to my lack of an electric mixer, but I doubt that made a difference. This recipe is workable, but for much more consistent results with less effort I'd recommend cooking them in the oven, which is something I've done in the past with greater success.

Wonderful recipe, I didn't have a stand mixer so I did it the hard way but it still came out great. I used a rolling pin at the end to get them as thin as I wanted and I got some nice even bubbling as I got better and better at flattening(My first few were way too thick and just made tougher yet still delicious bread circles).

Waiting for the dough to rise on another batch now. Lasts a nice while too if sealed or bagged, doesnt get stale very fast when exposed either. Going to try toasted them with olive oil and rosemary to make pita dip chips (:

Was totally awesome and made it exactly as called but the times for cooking are off. 30-40 seconds then flip is all that's necessary on med. high heat. If you wait 3 min. you'll be serving black manhole covers instead of pita bread

I grew up on pita bread and this recipe isn't what I expected. Middle Eastern pita bread is very soft and a little chewy as well as thinner. This recipe is a little salty, very soft but it doesn't have the chewiness. Two problems I found making it with a cast iron skillet was that the bread took on a strange flavor and medium high was way too hot and it scortched my first one. It's an easy recipe but next time I'll cut the salt way down and try baking it on a baking stone in the oven on high heat, lower rack. I'm not sure if that will help with the chewiness though. Chewy and soft is what makes a great pita.

Solid pita bread.  That's 1.5 teaspoons of yeast for those of you using yeast in bulk.

The secret to the puff, and you will get it about 95% o the time is you have to flip early. 
When you add to the skillet wait 10 seconds then flip, wait another 10 seconds and flip, wait for the puff!
Found out half way through the batch and then all the last one started to puff this way.
At first I would let it cook from the bottom but i would see large bubbles on top and when I would flip it wouldn’t get it to bubble. 
Try it on one and you will see the huge bubble all the time!

I have tried to make home made pita bread many many times and have yet to be successful. This one had such great reviews for being easy and tasty I figured id give it one more try. I was careful to follow the recipe exactly. I am making my husband home made Gyros for his birthday dinner and I wanted homemade pita to go with it. The dough divided into 8ths made for very tiny pita...it is  maybe a 5inch circle tops. They don't taste that great....its ok for me as a snack but to serve as a special birthday dinner is not good. It turned out more like a thick tortilla...I am sure I must have done something wrong but since I did follow the directions it seems a waste of 3hrs....not to mention the 1  hour walk it took to get to the store to get ingredients. My fun surprise for my husband will end up with a call for him to pick up pita bread on his way home! haha oh well!

I followed the instructions but I did not like making mine on the cast iron pan.  I did not get the poof.  After making one in the frying pan I switched to a 500 degree oven.  I baked them on the top rack for 5-6 min.

I watched the video and read the reviews and I thought I knew what to do to get my pitas to puff, but when I cooked them in the skillet they didn't puff.  Since they weren't working anyway, I figured I'd cook them the easy way and bake them, and surprisingly, a few of them did puff in the oven!  They turned out tasting okay, but I didn't think they were better than store-bought.  I won't make this recipe again.

All but one of my pitas puffed up as shown in the video, but it was still easy enough to make a pocket in it. These turned out much smaller than I was expecting. Maybe next time I will cut into 6 rather than 8 to make them a little bigger. I never got my dough to look as pretty as the video, but these are delicious even if they are a little less than perfect. Probably added a little less salt than called for, but that was the only change I made.

I really liked these and will be my new go-to pita shells.   I like pan frying, rather than baking, as my other ones did.   My only problem was that after cutting, they were hard to open up.   I see from other reviews that I should have smooshed the bubbles.   I think my heat may have been a bit too high as well.

My first time making pita.  It turned out great.  I used a bread machine to make the dough.  I also used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.  I think I'll try all purpose flour next time to compare.  Chef John is right; these were better than any pita I have bought in a store.  I liked experimenting by rolling them out to different thicknesses.  1/4" like the recipe was great; I also liked thicker pieces.  Very nice.

I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great! Definitely way better than anything store bought. Not all of them puffed up like in the video, but they puffed up just enough to have decent pockets for stuffing. Paired these with tonight's dinner of shakshuka and everyone was grabbing for seconds and thirds! Doubled the recipe for my family of 6 but next time I'll triple or quadruple lol They're really that good! Thank you for this recipe!

Be sure to watch the video.  I was surprised how easy the pita was to make following Chef John's demonstration.  And how delicious and attractive they were.  I doubt that I will ever buy pita bread from a store again.

Very tasty. I added garlic powder. It was delicious!

I used instant dry yeast. It didn't rise nor inflate. Maybe the water was too hot.  I'll try with colder water next time and If that doesn't work I'll try with different kinds of yeast :) Maybe the temperature of the pan stopped it from inflating.

I tried this recipe 4 times tweaking and tweaking and more tweaking.... NOT ONCE that a pocket came out. not even one time. 
The bread comes up out flat and with a few bubbles.
getting frustrated.
Maybe it's time to check other recipe. I'm looking (since I know it exists) for a pita bread that had a pocket is that it is not thin.                     

3/12/2017
just tried again. I swear.... there is NO WAY you can fit 3 cup of flour like this recipe calls for  and mix is with 1 cup of water. NO WAY!!!!

Easy and delicious!! I've never made homemade pita before and since my 2 year old likes it so much I thought I'd give it a try. This was better than the farmer's market fresh pita. Thanks again Chef John!

Wow, these tasted great.  They were a little difficult to make, I had to add a lot more flour then what was called for, before I could get the right consistency.  While cooking them, mine did not puff up very much, so I had trouble getting the pockets in mine.  I had to use my finger to force the bread to open.

I made this and they ended up more like a naan texture because for some reason mine didnt puff up to a hollow in the center, but turned out to be a nice cross between a flat bread and naan in the end

Just as Chef John commented - better than any pita breads you will find in the supermarket.  It takes a little effort, but well worth it.

The video is right- it is MUCH better then store bought.  I loved it!  The only thing is that it was too salty for my taste.  I will reduce this next time.  Also, I had to leave mid-way, so I popped the dough in the fridge to rise.  The dough still doubled in size, but it did not form nice pockets with the dough being cold.

The flavor was fantastic!  They didn't puff up as much as I thought they would, but when I opened them they had the pockets.  The best part was how wonderful they tasted.

This is a great recipe. I'm Lebanese, but have lived near good Middle Eastern bakeries most of my life; it didn't make sense to make pita bread at home. Now I live in the south, and grocery store pita bread just doesn't cut it. I was a bit intimidated to try the recipe, and was amazed to see how easy it was. Most of my loaves puffed up beautifully, with a couple of exceptions. Based on the recommendations of other reviewers, I reduced the salt a little bit, and I thought the flavor and texture of the bread were excellent.

I've made this twice this week alone.  The first time I didn't get a puff in the pan.  The second time I did it I flipped a baking sheet upside down and put it on the second highest rack.  I baked it on broil and was able to do 2 at a time and every single one puffed.

This being said, if you do it this way you don't get the lovely charred bits on the bread but it's still soft, slightly chewy, and delicious.

I made Chef John's pita bread recipe for the first time today.  THEY TURNED OUT PERFECT!Followed the recipe to the letter.  You have to let them rest both times.  The first batch was pretty good...watching them PUFF was fun but I don't think I let them rest as much as the second batch.  The second batch was also  rolled just a hint thinner.  The heat control is also a major factor.  My first batch had a lot more charred spots...the second batch, a lot less which may also be a contributing factor for the perfection I got with my second batch.
Every one puffed but that second batch....indescribably perfect and absolutely delicious!
I'll never use any other recipe but this one again.  
Thank you Chef John!

I make this all the time and I mean it all the time. The only thing I do differently is forget about it. So it gets a bit more time to rise on each step. I am a bit more experienced in the kitchen and that seams to make a difference when mom tries and fails at making it. I’m very gentle with it compared to her. Sometimes I add sumac and I highly recommend trying this when you are at the process of adding to the sponge. 
Thank you John.

I make this frequently and turns out tender and chewy at the same time.  My entire family say's it's better than any of the store bought pita available in our area and it freezes well also.

This was so easy and so good.  I’m in Florida, so I always set my dough outside to rise.  I found that my stove was way too hot at medium high. I set mine just shy of medium.  It was fun to watch them puff up. They taste better than the grocery store version.

I used gluten free flour and they were really yummy! As mentioned by other reviewers, they did not bubble up as much as in the video, so I had to cut them with a knife but that wasn’t a big deal. I made 6 instead of 8 since I wanted them to be the same size as the store bought pita breads. Also next time I would cut back on the salt.

Made it two times, and it turned out to be awesome. This recipe is a keeper. No machine, so hubby kneaded the dough. Homemade is the best. Thanks to Chef John.

This was awesome! I’ve never made pita and all my local stores had was the whole wheat. I looked it up and figured I could probably do it, and I had everything already, I had to knead it by hand because I don’t have a stand mixer, and it still came out amazing! Perfect bubbles, puffs and everything! Dipped in some tzatziki and perfect zero,

After reading the excellent advice from other reviewers, I was able to make the tastiest pita I have had since I moved to a fairly remote part of the U.S..  I did not understand what they meant by "smoosh"  but I do now.  It means that when you get a substantial bubble on ones side, press down on it gently with the back of your spatula and it will open up the rest of the "pocket".  It is the same thing as if you sit on one side of a half inflated pool raft.  The air goes to the other side.  It also helps if you roll out the dough thinner than you think (1/8 inch).  For those that want a larger pita, you should only make 6.  Also, as another reviewer suggested, turning the dough in the pan twice in the first minute, then leaving it to start the "bubble" really helped.  The two layers seemed more even that way.  If you are going to make pita chips, or if you are salt sensitive, then I would decrease the salt a tad.  So wonderful with hummus and a lentil soup from this same site.  I am making the sponge as I write this.  I am not by any means a baking person (great with gravy and sauces), but I love this recipe and video.   The ingredients are not expensive, so why not give it a whirl?  I did, and am so grateful.

Though this is certainly a long process, with a fair bit of waiting, the final product is well worth the time. The most difficult aspect of this recipe is pressing and/or rolling the dough balls into round shapes after the 30 minute rest. The dough doesn't easily spread outward. I found that using the rolling pin helped, but to prevent sticking--to my hands and the rolling pin--I needed to judiciously use more flour. Also note that a pan that is too hot will create burn marks, rather than brown marks, so watch that heat! If the first one gets too dark, too quickly, it will only get worse, unless you make a heat adjustment. In that case, lower the heat! As usual, great recipe Chef John. I enjoy the bonus jokes and one-liners on the video too. These were absolutely great with the American Gyro recipe. My family snatched them up in  nothing flat.

This turned out perfect!!! Make sure to watch the video. I made one batch without watching, and it was a hot mess. I do not have a cast iron pan, so mine did not look as beautiful as they could have. My pita were delicious and just as good as a restaurant version.

delicious. perfect puffage. I experimented with cooking techniques on my first batch. Baked some at 500 in oven like one reviewer suggested. Really big puffs, but the outside was a little dry. grilled some like the video and these also delicious and tender. did anyone know that if you make the ball into an English muffin shape, small and thick, it tastes just like an english muffin? Delicious nooks and crannies and all! I think I may make a batch like english muffins for breakfast sometime. great recipe.

Great recipe! Easy to follow and very successful. The flavor was exceptional. Better than store bought.

I omitted Olive oil on the skillet and heated it to 550 degrees. At the higher temperature, the pita puffed and cooked very fast. Attempts at lower temperatures still came out, but with a less pronounced pocket.

Great recipe- put in proofing drawer for 1 1/2  hours to rise and it was fine.  We only got 4 regular sized pita rounds out of this recipe, so in the future I would double.  Great flavor!

This recipe is easy and yummy! I used 1 cup whole wheat white flour and 1 cup bread flour, adding more flour slowly as necessary. Be careful not to add too much flour. Every pita puffed up beautifully and were a huge hit with my entire family. It was easy to make with my stand mixer and dough hook. I have now made this several times, refrigerating the dough after dividing and forming into balls. When ready to eat, I rolled out the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes before frying and they puffed perfectly and tasted wonderful. We used these for falafel, gyros, pulled chicken, and plain. Thank your for such a great recipe!

Today was the 2nd time I made these and they came out terrific!  I believe the 1st time I mixed the flour and yeast with the water but today I first mixed yeast & water then added the flour, perhaps giving a better rise to the sponge which looked insanely great today!  Every single bread was a full balloon!  Love, love, love Chef John's videos and teachables!

I had limited time so I rested dough less at each stage and STILL PERFECT PITAS! Best ever. I used both a small and a large cast iron griddle (I’m southern, cast iron is LIFE) and also I did add s bit of oil between to prevent burning.

6 out of 8 pockets! Fluffy and yummy...might need a touch of sugar. Super easy and fun! 1 of the 8 definitely didn't rest for 5 minutes and I think your skillet really needs to be nice and hot. 

The other 'trick' was flipping after about 20 seconds each side, back and forth for even cooking until the pocket started forming. Another review guessed that one side may get too cooked and thick to form the bubble... Sounded reasonable. 

To work in all the flour (2 1/2 c), I did have to take my dough off the hook and knead a little by hand. My sponge didn't look very foamy either, but it all worked out :)

I think my problem was not using instant acting yeast and so I didn't let it completely rise. Loved the taste and simplicity.

Excellent pita recipe. I've discovered that you can bake them in the oven at 550F for 2-3 minutes on the bottom rack, then put them under the broiler for up to an additional minute. You can get multiple pitas cooked at the same time and they puff up beautifully. Also, you can put the dough together at night before going to bed with 1/4 tsp dry instant or active yeast and let it rise overnight instead of kneading. Knock back the dough and continue the recipe as stated.

Excellent pitas! I missed the soft, tasty pitas we got where we used to live, so searched for recipes and found this. It delivered and then some! The only change I’ll make next time is I’ll make a double batch!

I tried spreading the dough with my fingers as well as rolling the pitas out with a wine bottle and only one of them puffed up, so I guess there's a bit of luck involved. Regardless, they tasted great and worked just fine with my halal street chicken.

I hate baking bread because I'm not the best at it.  This recipe though was quick and easy as advertised.  I did use fast-rising yeast and threw the dough in a small room with a space heater.  Had I followed the recipe exactly it would've come out much better.

Tasty but time consuming and tricky to get the right thickness. And not really above and beyond store bought pitas as promised... Be sure to make the pocket while pitas are warm or you may have a hard time like me.

Good turn out and easy to make. I let my sponge develop for about 45 min to develop a deeper flavor. The bread turns out very light and when grilled, puffs up beautifully.

Followed recipe exactly and this turned out as expected.  I got 'air' in all of my pita breads when cooking them.  I made small pitas because I want to serve appetizer size gyros for a holiday gathering and this recipe allows you to make any size you want.

I made the dough exactly as directed.   But when it came to cooking it, I opted for the oven set at 425.  I rolled out the bread and instead of putting in a fry pan, put it on a cookie sheet in the oven.  It puffed beautifully!! I let it get very slightly browned and took it out - it was great.

Was great dough with nice flavour. It was a bit hard to make a circle as large as I wanted.  Used as it was but didn't puff up to allow a  pocket.  Would still make again.

reading the recipe I did not think this would be good but I was wrong, absolutely wonderful!!! only thing I did different I use glad press and seal wrap instead of tin foil while the bread rises for 2 hours my house is not very warm so I turned my oven on for a couple minutes to get it about 75 degrees and then placed the dough in the oven (turned off) for the rising aka proofing part of the recipe

I followed directions carefully, except to reduce the amount of salt to 1 1/4 tsp. Even then, they were a bit too salty. Pitas were soft and puffy, but not all of them would open to be filled and they were smaller than the picture. It would be helpful to know the diameter of the prebaked pita and not just the thickness. If I make them again, I will try 3/4 tsp salt. Otherwise, the pitas were worth the effort and very tasty.

I have made this recipe a number of times now and love it. My husband asks for them often. I have made it just as written and it works great and have made them adding a tsp of sugar to the sponge to help it rise a little better, giving the yeast a bit more food. Both work fine but personally I like the bit of sugar added. I have found that if you shorten the time you cook the pita on the first side so that it barely bubbles and then flip and cook a longer on the second side (but not much)  and then on the flip back to the first side if you are patient and let it cook longer on this side it will almost always give the full puff. It is my favorite part of making the pita is getting the full puff. It is so rewarding when you get the full puff.

The key to get a good puff every time is to cook it on the first side for ONLY 10 to 15 seconds before the first flip.  This will help seal in the moisture.  Then cook it as the recipe calls for.  Beautiful delicious pitas!!

A very good and simple recipe that is way better than store-bought pita. However, everything that is good takes time.

This pita recipe is now in my permanent "keep" box.  Excellent!  I rolled them a little too thin but it didn't stop us from loving them.  I made gyros and it all came together perfectly.  I had perfect bubbles :)  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

I followed another readers suggestion and heated my cast iron pizza pan in the oven @ 500 degrees for 30 minutes. I then cooked the pita on the pan, three at a time for 3 minutes.  Result: perfectly puffed pita!

Wup. I made pita bread from either this or the NY Times. I just cannot remember which. 
300 gm of bread flour, 50 gm of whole wheat flour, 50 gm of sourdough starter, 1 tsp of salt, 1 Tbsp of olive oil, 240 gm of water.  all mixed in the morning, for an evening meal. I forgot that I had a baking stone and used a cast iron frying pan to bake these on my stove top. Big mistake. It takes way too much time to make 8 Pita Pockets this way. If you cannot afford a baking stone go to Home Depot and pick up a 12 or 15 in floor tile, if it fits in your oven. Bake the pita Bread on the tile four at a time.

Wow! I could not believe that the pita bread turned out so well on first attempt! Filled it with chicken and cabbage curry; my family loved it! They are still trying to figure out how I made the magical pockets!

Made this a few times and enjoyed it until I found Chef John's Lebanese Mountain Bread.  Don't think I will ever do this one again because this takes way longer to cook and rarely puffed for me.

I followed this recipe exactly. Absolutely awesomely delicious. I have made this multiple times for my pita discerning hubby, with my younger teen step daughter helper, by myself, for extended families, etc. This is a highly requested item at family and friend get togethers. Chef John keep them coming.

I followed the recipe exactly. this is my first time making bread, and it's so simple, and delicious,  and surprisingly satisfying! Not to mention cheap! I did NOT get full 'inflation', which means you don't get the classic pita pocket. I suspect that comes with practice. I think my issue may have been, the dough seemed a bit dry, compared to the video, I'll try a bit less flour next time. Whatever the case may be, this bread is still very much worth making, and is likely 1 of the best  options for bread and/or yeast beginners like me! I'm very proud of my bread, and can't wait to make it again! the scent is amazing!

This was my first pita attempt. It was okay. The taste wasn't great - a bit salty. My very first pita puffed BEAUTIFULLY...like a balloon. (The others, not so much). However, the pocket wasn't even. One side was quite thin. So I don't know what happened. I'm going to give this one more go and follow the directions even more closely!

I used the exact measurements but swapped out AP flour for whole wheat pastry flour. I preheated my cast iron pan on my flat top stove at #4 for 10 mins.  I proofed my dough for several hours because I forgot about it. I use my microwave with the light on to proof my dough. Rolled the dough out and proceeded as directed. These little tasty treats all bubbled up and made a beautiful pockets perfect for my kerrygold butter. This one is a keeper and we will make these a lot. 
Tips: make sure your yeast hasn’t expired. Make sure your cast iron is hot enough. I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil on the skillet because olive oil will smoke up your house. Keep the plate of cooked breads covered with a towel.

Turned out perfectly! Next time I will probably make the portions larger to create larger breads. The bread was perfect to use with my avocado Chicken salad! I would not change a thing....it just takes all day of waiting and doing small tasks but other then that My whole family loved it!

Gluten free - My first try at this recipe and I used cassava flour so my expectations were very low. I got in trouble right off the bat with the sponge, which was way too thick. I fixed that with an additional 1/2 cup of water and went merrily on my way, following the video at every step. The resulting dough was quite impressive, and I anxiously anticipated tossing the first pita into the skillet. Based on my experience with tortillas and several suggestions here I set the stove a tad below medium. To my utter amazement the first pita poofed beautifully. Unfortunately, it turned out gooey inside. I fiddled with the thickness, heat, and time for the remainder of the recipe and although all poofed, none would produce a pocket. The taste was superb, however, so I'll keep at it. Next batch I'll use Pamela's Artisan Flour and see how that works.

I'm pretty experienced making breads, so these were real easy.  If you have problems making these pita's, make sure your yeast is active and you follow the resting and rising times. You can a accidentally kill your dough if you're not careful with temperatures.

Wow! What a surprise to find that I could actually make pita bread and how easy it was.  I'll never buy them again.  We had the most delicious lunch with home made Tzatziki sauce and left over steak.  My husband raved about it. Thank you, Chef John!

The flavor was good overall, but a bit too salty.  I ended up needed much less flour than recommended, so perhaps that would make a difference in my results.  My results were hit or miss.  Some puffed, some didn't.  Some were too thin to cut a slit in, and the first batch in the pan was too thick and doughy in the middle, and very small in diameter. As others said, the size it goes in to the pan is the size it will come out.  The burner needed to be set less than medium hot - a 4 1/2 out of 10 on my stove, so the first several were done too fast and left it doughy in the middle.  Results were somewhat better when they were rolled with a pin really flat, like a tortilla.  I"ll make it again, and try more modifications to time , temperature, and thickness.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I was stuck in the house on a snow day and had a recipe I really wanted to make for hummus but couldn't do hummus without pita. And all the pita recipes I've tried don't come out right. And I don't have a 700 F wood-burning oven. This was so easy, and while not every pita puffed up, the majority did so perfectly. And even if they didn't puff, they were delicious.  The only problem I had was that after the first two, the cast iron pan gets two hot. I used two pans, and made two pitas at a time. I put them to rest on a clean dish towel draped over a plate, and then cover them with the towel. They stay perfectly fluffy that way. This is it, I can stop looking. Again, thanks.

My favorite bread recipe! Try it at least twice before you call it quits! Mine didn't puff the first time, but puff every time after without fail.

Followed the recipe except didn’t let it rest 30 minutes at the end and I rolled it out very thin, then cut the pitas into triangles. It was time consuming to fry all of the pitas- I made two batches of dough so I ended up running two pans to get through them all. Got exactly what I was hoping for- will definitely make this again!

I follow this recipe for the dough, but then I deviate at the end. After making the 8 dough balls I don't let them rise that extra 30 minutes, and when I roll them out I roll them as thin as I can so they make a good 6 to 8 inch round. I fry them off like the directions say after that and this gives you a thinner pita that you can use for rolling around your gyros, souvlaki or other fixings instead of a 'pocket pita'.  Sturdy but soft, not dry with little bubbles that brown beautifully on both sides. So yum!

I've made it four times, with different tweaks getting different results. For great ballooning, I recommend adding another 20-to-30 minutes of rising AFTER rolling them out, and don't overlap them. I prefer them thick (pita patties?) as delicious mini-loafs. I use flavored olive oils and toss in herbs. I cut the salt unless I plan to dip them in something I'd normally use chips for.

So, I saved my hand bag change for a long time and finally bought a kitchen aid mixer.   The Pita bread recipe was the first one that caught my eye.  It has turned out very well.  I did cook the pita on a cast iron griddle, gotta love cast iron.  It did 'poof' up and to get a decent pocket, you have to smush the 'poof' out of it.   Browned well, loved the consistency/chew factor.  Couldn't have turned out better.

Hi Chef John, I love this recipe and often use the dough for pizza and rolls! Ive started making your sourdough starter too. I wonder if you could let me know how to make this recipe with the starter instead of yeast? Many thanks! Karen

Like many others, I do not have a stand mixer so I kneaded by hand. I didn't add any time, just kneaded the 5-6 minutes. The only change I made was that I baked the dough first and then just browned it a bit in the skillet. They turned out so incredible. I got pockets even though that wasn't my aim. My local grocery store just makes total garbage pita so I decided to make my own and they're better than anything I've had from stores, bakeries, or restaurants. Totally worth the effort to make them yourself.

This pita bread was absolutely delicious. The pita was light, airy, and still had that slightly chewy texture that I love from homemade pita bread. It reminded me of the pita that I get from the food trucks near my office. Although time consuming, it was easy to make, and definitely worth the time spent. I will definitely make this again. Thank you so much!

Thank you for am amazing recipe!  it came out so beautiful. the first and last one gave me a full pillow, the others only half. I think the letting then rest before frying helps with he puff.  they taste fantastic and they were so soft!

These turned out great! It was my first time making pita bread and I was getting full puffed out of the majority of them! Unlike the other reviews, I did not think this was too salty. The video was definitely helpful to watch prior to making these, as it showed me some essentials: the desired consistency of the dough, how to roll the little balls, and the press method to encourage the pockets to form to achieve the full puffed-ness. Two thumbs up from my hubby so definitely will be making these again! We paired it with chicken tiki masala and rice, but are considering making them as the base for individual pita pizzas.

Very good! The pitas puff up a lot during cooking so I patted my dough circles down more than 1/4 inch before putting them on the skillet.

The warm water in this recipe needs to be between 105-110f for the active dry yeast to work. That will fix any problems cook are having with "the rise".
..any cooler, yeast won't activate
...warmer will kill the yeast rendering it useless

Despite the instructions appearing lengthy, I found this recipe quite intuitive and relatively easy to accomplish. I think this is one of those breads that takes a few times perfect, but my family really enjoyed my first attempt.

Very easy to make and tasted very good, puff or not.  Not all my bread puffed.  At first, I thought I may have followed the recipe wrong, but later on, I believe it was the temperature which I was using a regular stainless pan on medium/low heat.

Because I'm making a Moroccan Tagine tonight, I thought that it would be a good idea to have Pita bread--but I figured that I would try to make the pita rather than go with store bought.  
After perusing a few recipes, I came across this and decided to use it because many other recipes called for a blend of all-purpose and whole-wheat flour. I' only have all-purpose in the house.
I watched Chef John's video before preparing the dough, and got my ingredients in place.
I'm glad that I watched the video.
When C.J. says to not add all the flour at one time, he is correct.
I did not need all of the flour as suggested.  In addition, I used Kosher salt rather than table salt.  And I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt.
As far as rising/proofing goes, it didn't take the full two hours. For me, it was an hour and a half.  Cutting the dough into eight pieces was a cinch because I used a pastry scraper--those scrapers are great for cutting dough.  I formed the dough into balls, set them on a silpat-covered cookie sheet, put cling wrap on them and placed them in the oven for 30 minutes. 
After the final proof, I patted down and rolled the dough, rotating constantly to ensure a good round.  Then I heated up a bit of the oil in both a cast iron skillet and my crepe pan.  Both pans worked remarkably well.
One thing I want to point out.  My smoke alarm s*cks. It goes off so randomly.  Since this is a grill-bread recipe, I put my vent fan on, opened the windows and turned the ceiling fans on.

This recipe it magical! I live near a ton of Middle Eastern restaurants and this is the first time I've tried to make pita bread, let alone match the great taste of authentic pita bread. We nailed it thanks to Chef John's great recipe. My husband and I couldn't help but eat each piece (with a bit of garlic sauce) as it came out of the skillet. Fantastic recipe! Thank you!

This is the second time I've made this.  I'm fairly new to making bread although I have finally learned how to make a perfect pizza dough.  We are older and trying to cut back on salt, and there was way too much salt in this.  I'd only use 1 tsp next time, and if it needs more, adjust.  Finding the right pan heat is always a challenge.  I've just decided ours cooks hot so I used med low heat with the cast iron skillet.  Even had one do the full pillow thing!   Next time, I'll weigh the finished dough ball and divide by 8, but I'm a Virgo so that might not be a big deal for you.  Overall, very good except for the salt.

It WAS a lot of fun. I followed the recipe exactly and I am a pretty good cook. The end results were very tasty but it was not a perfect product. My pitas puffed nicely around the outside, not much puff in the center. I was able to make a nice pocket in spite of no center puff.  Please tell me what I did wrong because I do want to try this again.

THANK YOU, CHEF JOHN,  for this wonderful Recipe and Video!  

I am not much of a cook, but have discovered that it is almost impossible to make bad-tasting bread, as long as you obsess about your water temp and do not kill your yeast.  I have become our family's bread baker, producing many delicious-tasting loaves and rolls of varying degrees of beauty.  (My hot dog buns had funny-looking points, but tasted divine.)  

But I was nervous about making pita.  I lucked onto your recipe including your dead-useful video to reassure nervous bakers.   Every one of my first batch puffed!  These pitas are heavenly, and I thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.  

I like them best halved and split open, with one inside side smeared with (home-made) hummus, and then filled with some cucumber slices, tomatoes, and black olives.  OMG. as the kids say.  Stuffed with a dressed lettuce salad is good too. 

Thanks again, Chef John.  I am so happy to be able to provide this traditional staple for my family and know it tastes better than store bought.

First time working with flour. The instructions were good and my bread puffed up. The only thing that I was not happy with was the amount of salt. They turned out really salty. But overall it was a good recipe with good instructions. Thank you

Great recipe. I've made it twice.  The first time I was hit and miss with the puffage.  6 of the 8 were half puffed.  The second time 6 of 7 were full puffs (I dropped one, hence the 7 instead of 8). Highly recommend!

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now. Out of those some 2 dozen pitas, I think 3 of them have puffed. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. That being said,  these are really delicious and I have made do with non-puffed pitas.

Watch the video, follow the steps and you will be in pita heaven. These were great. I may try baking them next time just so I can get them done faster. My cast iron skillet is only big enough to grill one at a time. Double the recipe if you are making them for any type of event. You will end up eating many before the company comes over ;)

Perfect! You get really tasty, fluffy and light pita. Just like in a restaurant. If you do exactly what he says in the video you won't get disappointed!  Thank you for this recipe!

Zero 'puff', no pocket. Good flavor and texture.   Following the written directions, I rolled the dough to 1/4 inch thick (which I think is way too thick) and most likely the reason we didn't get pocket pitas.  After my failed attempt I watched the video and it appears that the rollout was much thinner, perhaps 1/8".   I ended up with something like naan -  still tasty and enjoyable just not the pocket we were hoping for. I will try this again in the near future to see if I can redeem the recipe. ( I also had to adjust the pan heat to medium low, on my range about '3',  not medium high. This seems to be a common adjustment for  many posters here.)

I have made many delicious things in my life, but this may quite possibly take the cake. That's right, a simple BREAD now rates higher than all my prized roasts and steaks and baked goods. My pregnant brain woke me up from my afternoon nap demanding some hummus and pita, and I just could not bring myself to go drop $5 on a tiny package of stale pita. I found this recipe at 2:30, and by 6:00, I was losing my freaking mind over this delicious, fluffy cloud of yeasty pita. Thank you, chef John, for satisfying this mama's craving.

I followed the recipe to the letter and watched the video for tips on handling the dough. It turned out perfect! Some puffed more than others as he said may happen in the video. I let them cool completely and they all opened a couple that did not puff as much had to be worked gently with my fingers to get open.  They were delicious!! We stuffed them with curried beef with apples and raisins and a side of Tzatziki sauce. 100% recommend this one these taste a 1000 times better than store bought.

This recipe is The Bomb! Wow!! the only change I made was to use 1/2 whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose flour. I also had to leave the house and so let the dough rise for 4 hours instead of the 2 hours.....all was good! These are sturdier than store bought, WAY cheaper, and taste SO much better! I smooshed the pitas when they puffed so that I had good pockets as well. I can see making these weekly! Especially during summer gardening season- they are great with cream cheese, sliced cucumbers, sliced onion, sliced tomatoes, cilantro and cracked black pepper.

I didn't use a cast iron pan because I don't have one. I only made 1/2 a recipe.  It took a couple tries to get them to puff - the ones that worked were rolled less than 1/4 inch and also it seemed to be important that the pan was the right temperature - more hot than medium-hot.

I made it with a few changes! I not quite but almost shallow fried it, which meant that it puffed up nicely on one side but remained flat and crisp on the other.  I also mixed some zaatar seasoning with olive oil and spread it on the flat side as it came of the pan, delish!  So so so good with a meze platter!

Usually, when I see that something is quick and easy to make, especially yeast bread, I am very skeptical, but this actually was quick and easy (other than the rising time, which I spent doing other things). One thing I would change next time is I would not roll the dough out so thinly because there were no pockets and it was crispy instead of being soft (which was definitely not a bad thing either!), but that's entirely my fault and not the recipe's as I never know when to stop rolling out the dough.

I followed the recipe exactly. These came out great. It was my first time making pita bread and not all of them had a really good pocket but the taste and texture were excellent. They were a big hit with the family. I can't wait to make them again.

I made wheat bread pitas, substituting 1-1/4 cup whole wheat flour for white flour.  I usually proof my yeast but decided to follow the recipe as written, even using a digital thermometer to ensure water was at correct temperature. Dough did not rise at all (yes, yeast was good as we just bought it yesterday so my wife could make pandesal which came out perfect). Mixing in the remaining flour, it was just too dry and more water had to be added. After 2 hours still no rise to the dough. Continued on and made the balls as shown in the video and covered. After 30 minutes they had risen almost double. Fried the first one and no puffing occurred. While the second was frying I cut the first one in half and tried to make a pocket but it wouldn't open. I expected to have 8 flatbread but from the corner of my eye I saw the second begin to puff up. In all, 4 fully puffed, a couple with a little spatula "encouragement," 3 partially puffed up, and of course the first one. Having altered the recipe and not knowing what the outcome would be, I was thrilled to have such successful results.

Just like he said; even better (much!) than store bought! No puffing but I didn't mind because they are just so delicious!They tasted a bit salty to me and I thought it was just me, but then my husband noticed it too. I will decrease salt to only 1 teaspoon from now on. We used them as wraps for grilled lamb kebabs with yogurt sauce (Jamie Oliver's "best lamb kebabs" recipe). Super easy~ I love this recipe!

Great dough recipie.  I live in Israel - where Pita is our "rainbow white bread" - loved the taste.  I did change however the method of making.  I tried on a skillet - didn't make the pocket.  so I baked instead. Lightly coated the heavy slide in pan with olive oil - baked on each side for 1.5 minutes on 250Celcius - full pockets each time.  Since I didn't have a cast iron skillet - likely didn't get hot enough when I tried it on my gas stove....

First time!  I don't have any thing but a hand mixer so I used my bread machine.  I mixed the poolish (pre dough) in a bowl.  While that was sitting I turned my bread machine on, with the pan empty (it does a one turn mix at first) by the time my poolish was ready my bread machine was in full spin.  I added olive oil to the bowl and salt and flour and stirred it in, then dropped it in the bread machine pan (had to add a little more warm water until it came together as a ball.  Let it run for 6 minutes and unplugged the machine, dropped the dough in a pre oiled bowl and followed the rest of the directions.  When the first pita got the little bubbles and puffed up, I was so excited.  I too, smushed them down (to get them to brown properly.  I didn't use them for pitas, I used them as the bread for a gyro.  They held together so well, without falling apart as the grocery store ones  do.  I am making them again today.  Please watch a video to see how to cook these.  I don't  think it is fair to rate a recipe low because the failure is yours.  My question to those who failed is did you follow the exact recipe?  Did you see bubbles in your yeast mixture?  (if not, your yeast was bad or your water temperature was incorrect.)   I have been cooking for 40+ years and all of the recipes I have tried on this site have been good recipes.  I think most of the one stars are just user issues.  Use good ingredients, follow the recipe exactly (especially if it is your first time) and it should

I adore this recipe. I got full puff on 7 of 8.  The taste when using olive oil makes it much better than using canola oil. They worked very well as tuna salad sandwich and as snack with flavored dips. Next time I plan on adding a touch of rosemary.

Followed the recipe perfectly and I only got puff on 2 of the 8.  Darn..  I like the recipe but my results were not that great.  Instructions were very good.  So lets see how it goes again.  I will try this one to get better results.

Turned out great! We ran out of pitas and the next day I didn't have time to make more and bought some at the store. The difference is undeniable.

I think this is one of those recipes which will get better each time you make it. It was relatively easy, but I didn't like the texture.  I only need pita bread a couple of times a year, and I will probably try this one again, but  I wouldn't make it if quality counts more than intent.

Simple, and amazing!
The kids love these, very versatile and so tasty! 
mine never puffed up, however, we use them as a flat bread for pitas with hummus, or tacos, mini pizzas, the possibilities are endless!  Great EVERY time!  Thanks for a killer homemade pita recipe!!!!

This was my first time to try making pita bread and it came out exactly like the video.  It was yummy and much better than store bought.  I cant wait to try adding spices and other things to jazz it up.  Very good!

Zero changes. The video helped for sure. Super easy recipe and well worth it. This pita is delicious, have made it twice now - and will never do store-bought pita again. It's also pretty darn good the next day.

Highly recommend.

Woah! It worked! I think the key is letting the dough rest.  Had some trouble with the olive oil smoking badly in the cast iron pan, but other than that, this was great!

Dough was really easy to make and followed directions to the T. I had a bit of trouble making them 'bubble' while cooking, just gotta practice a few more times! Dry our really fast so don't make them too far in advance.

This was so easy!   I don't have a stand mixer so I had to knead it by hand.   However, they were just a tad salty for us, we are on a low salt diet,so I will use a bit less next time  and I think I rolled them a bit thin but my husband loved them!  I actually got a full puff on one of them.  :) Will definitely keep this one.

Turned  out very good!   I don't have an electric stand mixer, so i kneaded by hand.  It took maybe 10 extra minutes,  but the end result was worth it.  It was so cheap and easy to make, I'll never buy pita bread again.

My puffed up really well. Each one. I found it impossible to stretch the dough out with my fingers alone and had to use the rolling pin. I found the cooked pittas too tough. Does anyone know what I can do to improve? I don't have a stand mixer. So I did mine by kneeding the dough with my hands. I used 2 3/4 cups flour total.

I read the recipe, the comments, and watched the video. I followed directions to a T, I even made sure the water was the right temp with my candy thermometer! My dough did not look like Chef John's...it was not so smooth and bouncy. I did not need to add any of the last 1/4 cup of flour, mine was quite dry after the initial 1.75 cups. I found that rolling the balls to 1/4" think made the pitas too thick (almost 1/2") and they didn't get a  pocket. When I rolled them to 1/8" it was better, and I sort of got pockets. They tasted great warm from the oven, but only ok a few hours later. I may make them again, but it was a lot of work!

Delicious! Mine didn't puff up too much, but I didn't care.  I cut it in triangles and dipped it into some hummus and olive tampanade. Everyone loved it.  My dad is allergic to soy, so he usually can't have store bought pita bread, he was thrilled to be able to enjoy it too.

I liked the fact that I could make these on top of the stove. I think my problem was that I didn't roll the first ones thinly enough and they didn't puff. The last half of the batch worked better making them thinner. I was used whole wheat because I has some left over and decided to try. They stayed soft and pliable for a day or two, which I thought was better than most whole wheat pita. I will try this again using white flour like the recipe calls for. I know it isn't a fair review if I don't follow the recipe without alterations.

I made these for the first time and they tasted great. I did not get mine to puff up but I think it was because my dough needed more flour (stupid FL humidity). It was a very easy recipe to make and I can't wait to try to make them again. I think with a few more tries I should be able to get them to puff. They reminded me of giant English muffins when I did not pat them out thin enough. Thanks for the great recipe John. I love your videos.

Followed recipe to the letter. First one didn't fluff at all ...that's the first one that got ate! After cast iron skillet got warm enough those that followed puffed up like Pita Paul and Mary! The video does help a lot.

I made these today, along with making a Traditional Greek Pita.  These take 1 1/2 hours longer to make, but they are so much better.  Directions are very easy to understand and simple ingredients.  Will definitely make again.

Tasty, but like some other commenters, my pitas didn't puff up to form a pocket.  I hand-kneaded the dough (no big mixer with a dough hook) so maybe that was the problem.  It would be nice if it wasn't assumed that everyone has a big mixer with a dough hook, or at least if some instructions were given for those of us who don't.  My pitas also burned on "medium high" heat as the recipe calls for, so I turned the heat down.  Medium high heat or lower, none of the pitas puffed.

I found these pitas to be way too salty.  My son still loved them though and has requested I make them again.  I had mixed success with the puffing.

Yea.  Never buying pita bread at the store again!!!  I doubled this recipe, which made 16 pitas, because I wanted extras....nope.  My family ate them all in one sitting!  They are that good!!!!
My only change is that I'd probably cut down the salt to 1 teaspoon.

I will definitely make some more. The last time I made them my sister in law stopped by unexpectedly and I had to let her try em. Shes mentioned twice to me already about when I'm gonna show her to make them because they turned so fluffy and had the pockets just like chef Johns.

I loved this pita bread, and I am  normally not a huge fan of it. They were so soft  and fluffy. Originally I was unsure about how the air pockets would happen but they where there and they were great.

I used bread flour instead of all purpose and instant yeast instead of active dry yeast. These turned out amazing! I don't know why I ever bought pita bread before. They were chewy which I think was mostly due to the bread flour, and they puffed up perfectly making glorious pockets. I was so proud of myself, lol! This is a simple, fast, easy recipe and I highly recommend everyone make their own pita bread.

Easy to make and really delicious. Very soft and flavorful, definitely sooo much better than what you buy at the store. Don't be sad if your pita doesn't puff up into a perfect pocket, that's ... honestly not very important at all, although it's fun to watch.
A word of caution - don't make the dough balls too oily when they're resting before being rolled out and don't put oil on your pan. I've definitely ruined a batch by doing that because they ended up sort of frying and becoming hard.

I love this recipe & have been using it for a couple years. There are a few variations I do to ensure that I get puffy pitas every time.  I do everything according to Chef John until the final stages. After my dough balls have rested I'm very careful when rolling them out. Try not to make holes or roll to hard on them. The variation I do is during the cooking process. I put my pita in for about 30 seconds them flip them right away. I'm not sure why but this seems to be the trick. I can successfully make a batch of 20 & have them all puff like little pillows.  I hope this helps, good luck & have fun.

This is perfect. The taste is to die for. Very easy to make.  If anyone's having problem, watch the video and other reviews for helpful tips. I was worried I might not get puffed pita. But all of them puffed perfectly, I almost cried in joy. We had one of the best dinner last night because of this. I could eat half a batch of this without any filling! Thank you chef John!

This is some of the best pita bread I've ever tasted. It goes perfectly with homemade hummus. My only complaint is how long it takes to make it one by one... But it's worth it!

5 stars to perfect pita!  I love the fact that I can make fresh bread without turning the oven on in August in Florida, that alone gets 5 stars.

Unless you are a seasoned cook; I wouldn't attempt this before guests come over.  I found it to create a lot of mess around my kitchen.  But the pita was wonderful, and if you don't normally use a lot of salt, I would cut it down to 1 teaspoon. Sorry, even though the taste was great, I'll be buying mine in the future :(

Thank you so much for this recipe. I was afraid making this would have a bad outcome because I have no experience with making any type of bread, and I don't really bake much, but these came out perfectly!! And they're delicious as well!

First I made Yogurt cheese to get the whey (liquid) to use to jump start my homemade sauerkraut. I used the yogurt cheese, shredded cukes, and the juice to make the Tzatziki Sauce. When I made the Pita breads, I had to turn down the heat to make sure it was medium heat or they wouldn't puff up like the video. It also helped to use bread flour instead of all purpose flour. All a success the first time!!
Thank you, Chef John!!!

Ive made this 6 times now and its so easy. Chef John is right about feeling when a dough is perfect. My last batch had that "supple" feeling he talks about and they were absolutely perfect. They do dry out really easy for me... and suggestions on getting them nice and soft?

I followed the recipe verbatim and the results were excellent. Next time, I will experiment with different herbs, such as rosemary or oregano. We dipped in the pita bread into Tzatziki sauce which was good, but what tasted even better was a light brushing of garlic infused olive oil as they came off the skillet. this was a great family project, and the entire family enjoyed participating.

Mine only puffed a little when I covered the pan, otherwise they did not puff up.  Tried baking and it was definitely more puffy.  Try both and see what works for you, either way it's good.

This recipe even works in high altitude. I live at 4800 ft. It was perfect. Two things I will do next time. 1 Use peanut oil to cook the breads. It handles the heat better. 2. Use a soft brush to remove excess flour from the bread rounds before I put them in the hot pan. I had trouble with the excess flour burning. These two steps should make this recipe perfect. Also rolling out the bread with my rolling pin was faster than using my hands and the rolled breads cooked just like the hand patted bread.

This recipe was very simple and the result was delicious. We lived in Egypt and this reminded us of the baladi bread we loved so much. I've shared the link to this recipe on my blog along with a fabulously easy lentil soup recipe. The perfect combination to take me back my time in Egypt. Thanks for sharing this recipe and the great video!

Made exactly as the recipe and they are PERFECT! My first two burned because my electric burners are iffy, but the remaining 6 are just beautiful! Totally worth the time and effort.

First time I ever even tried making pita bread and this was awesome! I skipped steps 7 and 8 and just wen straight to cooking the pitas and they still were perfect! Everyone was so impressed that I made them from scratch and they tasted just like the ones from the store. Great with hummus and for wraps.

Awesome, I followed the directions just as stated( skipped the video) the fluffed up and browned perfectly. Whipped up some turkey salad, stuffed my pita and everyone in the house enjoyed.

wow - easy and delicious.  I wanted pita bread for gyros, so I made 10 thinner pitas with this, instead of 8.  Turned out perfect.  I plan on making pita chips with the few I have leftover.

Tried it. It was so good almost brought us to tears.  Sea salt was the key for us I think.  So easy my 7 year old nearly made it.

This was such an easy recipe to make, great for a first time bread maker like me.  It was my first time using a Kitchenaid and I was very pleased.  They do take a long time to cook (almost an hour for 8). Next time I might have two skillets going to save time.

I used a different recipe for the dough, but I loved Chef John's instructional video for the learning the technique. I had never made pitas before, but I had some leftover dough from making bolani, and I was out of bolani filling. So, why not pitas? My dough was made with King Arthur 100% whole wheat flour, salt, yeast, and water (no oil). I made a soft, wet dough, and kneaded it until it passed the windowpane test. Then, I let the dough ferment in the refrigerator for 3 days. I used Chef John's suggested technique for making small boules, letting them proof for 30 min., rolling them out, and then letting them rest before grilling in a cast iron skillet. I made my pitas thinner (2 or 3 times as thin) than Chef John, and I used peanut oil to coat the pan. I let my pan get quite hot. Almost all of my pitas were "full balloons." I found that the key to getting them to puff up was to roll them thinly and uniformly. Grill on one side until bubbles appear throughout the whole pita, flip and grill on the other side (puffing should start), then flip again to get the full balloon. These were the best, most flavorful pitas I have ever eaten.

i really liked the pita bread made following Chef John's recipe.  I didn't have a stand mixer so i used a food processor instead.  Thanks Chef John.

This really turned out very well, except I think, at least, on my stove, to use only medium heat! My first couple got a little to brown, not quite burned! I hope practice makes perfect! Thanks so much for the recipe and the video helps a lot! Some of mine puffed up and some didn't. But I really didn't care. I wanted them for souvlaki with tzatziki! Like I used to get many years ago when we were stationed just outside Athens, Greece! Great food there!

My daughter and I are brand new to baking.  We followed the recipe and barely got it to rise.  The taste was fine but gummy I think from it not rising.  They were also very small pitas at 1/4 inch thickness.  Experimented with taking one of the balls closer to a 1/8 thickness and it performed much better.  Will try again but using sugar to proof the yeast.

Third time I made these : full puff-age!!! On about half of them. They're so cool and balloon-like. And delicious. I don't rely on them all to puff perfectly but they're so yummy that who cares? I just put the filling on top rather than inside and eat it like a taco.

Great recipe. My only aggravation is that only 5 or 6 of the 8 pitas puff up. I am sure it is something I am doing wrong with the rolling out. Regardless, I have made this recipe three + times, and they taste great and 70-80% of the pitas puff up like a balloon...

Oh, and let me say I love Chef John's video (demo and voice). He just has a great presentation style!

Great basic recipe, but the directions need to be tweaked.  DO NOT heat your pan to med high and put oil in it, you will burn your pita bread before it is fully cooked and will never get to the stage where it puffs up (this happened to me).  Instead, medium heat worked just fine with next to no oil in the pan.  I recommend using no oil or just using a non-stick spray.  Otherwise, the dough recipe is GREAT.  If the instructions had worked as written this would have been 5 stars.

I've made this recipe twice now. First time to eat immediately...they we're amazing but took some work to form pockets. Prbly because they we're still hot. The 2nd time I made them a day ahead of time to use the next day with pulled chicken. The pockets worked amazing and the taste was incredible. Easy to make but I do recommend you watch the full video for real success. Chef John makes it look easy because it is!

I thought these were okay. The recipe was pretty simple to make. I mixed, kneaded, and proofed in my clear glass Kitchen-Aid bowl, that comes with a lid. The rise time is really the longest part. As far as the taste on the overall recipe, I am not sure what to compare it to, as I can't really remember ever having homemade pita bread. This recipe was kind of like a slightly thicker and sweeter tasting naan bread. I opened the center, of the halves, but it was more kind of like cutting into a thick piece of bread. It didn't really get a pocket to it. Although, the flavor was fine I think I prefer naan bread slightly better flavor wise. Also, this was much heavier and denser, for some reason. So, I am not sure how one would make a meal out of it. After one whole piece, with nothing else, I was absolutely full. Now, I am curious what other homemade pita breads taste like.

tried this about 5x now and my pitas don't always puff up all the way, sometime 1/2, sometimes a little, i get same results with my flour tortillas. i think it has to do with not having a mixer or kneeding enough, but they still tast great!

This recipe was easy to follow and my results were very good.  I am new to bread making and pitas is a bread i was very interested in making myself as they are so expensive in the stores, and my family loves to eat hummus and pita chips.  But with the price of pita chips and the price of pita bread, it was not always feasible.  Now it is, my first batch of pitas using Chef John's recipe was a hit with my family and I was very please with the results.  I need a bit more practice to perfect the pita making technique, but I am very pleased with my first timer results and I will be making these pitas again very soon.  Thank you Chef John :)

Great tasting homemade pitas.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used an electric griddle heated to 400 instead of a cast iron pan.  Some puffed up and some didn't.  I used a knife to start splitting the ones that didn't puff up, then carefully finished opening by hand.  Made Holly's Hummus to go with and they were a hit. Thanks, Chef John for the great recipe and video.  I will be making these many more times!

Love this recipe.  Easy to make and never fails. Everybody loves them and they make great personal pan pizzas if they don't inflate.  I keep some in the freezer at all times.  The only problem is the batch is a little small better to double it.
