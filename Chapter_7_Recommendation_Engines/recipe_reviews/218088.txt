WOW! Say good-bye to dreaded "dry pork" forever with this tasty BBQ pork dish that definitely has an Italian flair to it. I LOVE balsamic vinegar and could practically drink the stuff so I had to try this. Instead of cooking the sauce I decided to use it as a marinade.  I cut back a bit on the balsamic (use a good quality one and you can't go wrong) and added 2 Tbsp. of olive oil. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I used thick cut bone-in chops and put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for a full 24 hours. The smell coming off the grill was fantastic and the taste was sensational. Just as the submitter states it's just the right amount of sweetness and the chops were definitely moist, juicy and full of flavor.  This was perfect served with "Grilled Tomato, Onion, and Bread Salad" from this site. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe!

Sooo good. These pork chops have been marinated for 2 days. We don't have a grill, so I put them in a skillet on medium high heat for 1 minute per side and then tossed them in the broiler for 3 minutes per side. They were so yummy!

Best BBQ hands down!  Made exactly as written and it was delicious.  Used boneless pork chops and marinated them in enough sauce to cover them for about 5-10 minutes while I figured out it was too windy to grill outside.  We don't have a baster for the grill anyway so I used the bowl I had them marinating briefly and made sure they were coated before putting them on the pan under the broiler.  I rarely have broiler success but this dish was exceptional.  I used a thermometer and the pork was perfectly done and super moist.  I had leftover sauce that I saved out to use with chicken the following day.  This is my favorite sauce hands down and I'm not a big BBQ sauce fan especially if it comes from a bottle.  I use a higher quality balsamic vinegar, you can really tell the difference, and this brand I use is Modenaceti Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.  I've used better balsamic vinegars than this one before but never wrote the names down.

Very tasty - easy to follow recipe - works just as well if baked in the oven at 350F for 30-35 minutes. Yummy!!! I'll definitely be making these chops again in the future.

This sauce was amazing. I thought it smelled great when it was simmering, but I love balsamic vinegar! It was like balsamic vinagery BBQ sauce! I ended up letting it simmer on very low heat longer than the recipe called for and it got super sticky and thick and fantastic. I let the chops marinade in about 1/3 of the sauce while I prepped my side dish and then grilled. I ended up having to finish them in the oven for 20 minutes because mine were cut thick and I didn't want them drying out on the grill. We all really enjoyed this recipe!! Hubby said to save the extra sauce so we can have these again! :)

Upon completion of cooking they tasted pretty good, but smelled really bad (nauseating) while marinating & definitely smelled bad while cooking.

Really really good! Added less balsamic vinegar and about 3 tablespoons of olive oil, and left out the salt. Its a new favorite!

Just so-so for me/us. We LOVE balsamic & only use good quality & I hate to say it but, I'm kinda bummed that I used the last of my bottle for this recipe :-( I cant quite put my finger on which component I didn't like...it's got mostly 5-star reviews so I might go ahead & try it as a marinade sometime? I just don't know yet if I'm willing to try this again.

I just made this about an hour ago, and I have to say that it was delicious. One thing I would say, though, is beware when you make the sauce. It smells very vinegary, and you will probably think that you have done something wrong or that the chops will turn out horrible. However, once you cook the marinade into the chops and eat them you discover how delicious this combination of ingredients is.

Who knew that vinegar could make such a tasty meal? Thanks for the recipe!

I gave it 4 starz. It is good. However, I did cut down on the balsamic and I added hot sauce for a bit of spice. Tastes store bought. Changing review. 2 hours later. 5f Starzzzz. I have now BBQ'ed the pork ribs and then added the sauce. Hands down. FANTASTIC!! It compliments the ribs instead of taking over with a powerful falvor. It might of tasted like a bottled BBQ sauce, however, it most certainely is not. Will not buy bottled BBQ sauce again. This is a keeper.

SO good!!  I made these chops for dinner tonight and they turned out better than I hoped they would.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar but did have balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing and used that instead.  I left out the garlic since the dressing already had it.  I baked the chops in the oven and they were very juicy.  My eight year old, who eats slower than anyone I've ever seen before, wolfed down his and half of mine!

This was delicious! The balsamic vinegar was giving off a very strong smell while the sauce was simmering, to the point that my bf and roommate were kind of turned off by the smell of it. I added a bit of honey and olive oil and it was perfect for us!

The sauce was wonderful. I used it on pork chops that I sauted in a pan, rather than on the grill.

This is absolutely fabulous! The flavors blend together so well and grilled, the sauce caramelizes just beautifully. I have to admit to one very tiny change, though. I added an extra dribble of Worcestershire sauce. I believe this is my favorite pork chop recipe that I've used so far! Thanks so much! :o)

Made it exactly as written. Really excited that the sauce was home made since many store bought sauces contain high fructose corn syrup which I refuse to consume.   Used large boneless pork chops from the warehouse store.  They were a hit with the family.  Husband declared this should be the way our chops should always be made.  Will make again.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Not sure what makes this Italian but...
Not bad but some suggestions. One, cut the vinegar in half ...way too much for 4 chops. Two, wait until the chops are half done before applying any type of BBQ sauce. The sugars in the sauce will caramelize and start to burn before your chops are done. Lastly, it is not necessary to wait three minutes before enjoying. Dig in, it's not beef. GL, Chef Cosmo

Excellent recipe! Marinated the pork chops over night and cut back the balsamic vinegar to a half cup like others suggested.My boyfriend loved it! I didn't have enough pork chops marinated overnight so added extra to sauce about an hour before. They were not as tender or tasty as the ones who had been marinating. Will use larger thicker boneless chops the next time!

Delicious.....marinated 4 nice thick chops for 24 hours then grilled. They were tender and juicy. I loved the crust that the brown sugar and ketchup gave the chop while grilling and the balsamic was subtle and not as strong as I thought it would be but a welcomed change in this marinade. My family loved this dinner tonight, served with grilled asparagus. Thanks!

I have prepared this recipe several times and it is really good.  This is my husband's favorite recipe that I use for pork chops.  It gives you a nice sweet and tangy flavor and they are so tender!

Great recipe! I love balsamic vinegar and this does not disappoint. I marinated the chops in about 1/4 of the sauce while I cooked the rest of the sauce and meal. very tender and yummy!

OMG this is so delicious!  I dunked the entire boneless chop into the sauce before putting on the grill and basted while cooking. Very flavorful from first bite to the last.

These were good, and a nice change.  The balsamic sauce wasn't good by itself.  I definitely recommend basting with it before and during grilling.

It was delicious but if you are not used to some of the potent flavors it could be a bummer. I loved it. Make sure to use thick pork not thin.

I loved this dish! The ingredients were simple and I already had everything in my pantry. The brown sugar added a sweetness that was really good and it made me like balsamic vinegar. I made them in a cast iron skillet and they turned out great. Great option for a budgeted college girl!

We liked this recipe! My husband went to turn the BBQ on and found out we were out of propane so we ended up simmering the pork chops in the sauce on the stove top. They still turned out great! I liked how it was quick and easy and used ingredients I already had on hand.  I will be making this again so we can try on the BBQ this time.

I am not a big fan of pork chops, but this was AMAZING. The sauce is perfect! It is cold and snowing outside so I made the sauce, poured 1/2 of it over the boneless pork chops in a baking pan and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. Then used the extra sauce for dipping. I also added a touch of honey into the sauce to give it a little extra sweetness. The pork chops melted in my mouth. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I enjoyed making this balsamic BBQ sauce, very rich and thick result.  I used some for marinating, and then some for basting while grilling and had some to drizzle.  Different and delicious.  Prepared exactly as written.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

Well, I really liked it. The family, not so much. The kids wouldn't touch it and my husband who drinks vinegar straight from the bottle has now declared that he doesn't like warm vinegar, but liked "whatever other tastes there were in it". So, I think the fix is, that I'll have to reduce the vinegar...maybe by half.  

I used it as a marinade for about an hour and then broiled the chops (5 min per side). While they were broiling I brought the leftover marinade to a boil and then when I flipped the chops I poured it on top of them. This made them very saucy which I loved because that's where all of the flavor was, but too much for the rest of them! Oh well.

This was great!  I made half the recipe for two large (Costco) bone-in pork chops and had plenty, with some leftover.  The 20 minute simmer time results in a slightly reduced sauce that has nice body.  I put the sauce together early in the afternoon and let it sit at room temperature until it was time to grill.  I'm interested in trying the leftovers on chicken.

The only problem was not enough pork! lol.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar but i did have balsamic vinaigrette dressing,  so I cut regular vinegar with a little of the dressing, and it came out amazing!

This was good I had to make a few changes based on what I had. I used just under 1/4 cup brown sugar since I used the last of what I had and I used a grainy mustard. That said these were really good. I grilled onion slices brushed with the leftover sauce and served them with it. I would cut the balsamic back some especially if youre using a good brand.

Absolutely excellent. As I said before it is important to use a very good balsamic vinegar. I buy mine at the Olive Pit in Corning California. It’s their deepest most flavorful balsamic vinegar. Thick, very dark and chocolatey. I followed the recipe precisely but made sure I simmered the sauce, to reduce it, for a full 20 minutes making it the consistency of liquid peanut butter.                                     I am going to try the same sauce next time I barbecue steaks. This is definitely a winner.

We used the really thick pork chops, so it took about twice as long to grille them.  But the sauce is absolutely delicious!  Just the right amount of tangy taste.  I would perhaps even make 1 1/2 the amount of the recipe because I like lots of sauce.  This is definitely a keeper and I would even use this recipe for company!

I had only three, six-ounce chops to work with, so all I did to compensate for that was reduce each ingredient amount by about a third. It was fantastic. For sides, we prepared some scalloped potatoes and some fancy macaroni and cheese with some dinner rolls, the rolls were really tasty to dip in the sauce. Overall the dish was fantastic. However, the sauce in it's prep stage had an extremely strong aroma to it, delicious but strong. I definitely recommend this dish for a nice date night (both prep and dining).

Wow vinegar! I absolutely love balsamic vinegar but this had a vinegar taste. There  was no balance in the sauce. The vinegar needed to be reduced to half a cup or increase the brown sugar to half a cup.  If using a good quality vinegar you do not need to reduce it, the vinegar is already thick and would probably only need 2 Tablespoons vinegar in that case I would suggest; omitting  the sugar,  start with 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 clove garlic, 1 tablespoon Dijon and maybe a little olive oil for balance plus salt & pepper until you achieve the desired flavors. My kids (ages 7,5 & 2) really enjoyed this hence my 4 star rating but my husband & I felt the sauce needed work. Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing!!! Whole family loved it.. sometimes a 2 yr old and a 17yr old are hard to please BUT it was a definite hit!! You don’t have to modify a single ingredient.. I doubled it because we had 7 chops and I had a lot left! Ah-maxing!!

AWESOME!  Made this almost to the letter.  However.  Added a little olive oil and just marinated chops while doing my usual side dish prep, etc.  this allowed the chops to soak it all in, and eliminated the vinegar smell that everyone is complaining about.  All into the zip lock bag and later onto grill.  Fantastic!!!  Also, saved some marinade and brushed it onto sliced zucchini,  when the chops still had 5 more minutes added the zucchini to the grill.  Out of this world .  Served with potato salad, and you can’t ask for a better meal.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!! Thank you, I have redeemed myself cooking pork chops.  My kids went crazy for this and requested it again. I used a thick pork chop and pan seared it with olive oil for 5 min on each side until browned then I poured the balsamic sauce over it and oven cooked them for 15 min more.  Let the chops rest in the pan for 10 min before serving.   I added garlic  and soy sauce for additional flavor.  Save the extra sauce for chicken the next night.  The sauce has that pungent vinegar smell, don't worry the taste is amazing.  Printed the recipe and its in my box for the next time.

Way too sweet for my household! Will not make again. For much better results, marinate the chops in your favorite Italian salad dressing (store bought or homemade) for 24 - 48 hours before grilling.

The flavor of the sauce was delicious. Rather than grill the chops I simply browned them on the stove then put them in the crock pot with the sauce on top. It cooked on low for about For or five hours and we had the most tender, "fall off the bone good" pork chops in the tasty sauce.

I made a marinade using these ingredients for is as well and let it soak all day.... phenomenal!!  will definitely be preparing this lots more!! served with potato salad and dinner rolls!
Side tip...for my potatoe salad I boil the potatoes in liquid crab boil...this small change will forever change the way you prepare potato salad!

I was very skeptical at first with all the vinegar. However I made it last night for my wife with grilled corn and asparagus and she loved it! 5 stars.  The  flavor is tangy and sweet but not over the top just right. Enjoy

My bbq ran out of propane so I breaded the chops with bread crumbs, browned them in a pan on the stove, and then added the sauce on top of them and baked them at 400 for about 30 minutes.  I also reduced the Worcestershire sauce to 1/2 tsp and thought it turned out beautifully.

The only change I made was I used a balsamic vinegarette  (sp) salad dressing. The pork chops came out moist, tender without being overpowered by the vinegar. The pork chops that we used were about 2 inches thick and grilled as stated.  We didn't marinate them, just before grilling we brushed on the marinade, so I think that not marinating the chops is better, then you are not overpowering the vinegar flavor.

This is delish and a perfect way to do pork chops.  I had BOGO boneless loin chops that tend to be dry no matter how you cook 'em.  I marinated for 3 days just because I was prepping ahead for the week.  Grilled 4 minutes each side, perfecto!!!

I made it according to the original recipe, and I didn't care for it.  That may be just a matter of taste preference, but I didn't like the sauce which is, after all, the key ingredient.

I will diffidently make this again!  Both my husband and son  loved the pork chops.  That is saying a lot, because normally I get the opposite reaction from them when I tried other recipes.

Wasn't crazy about it.  Too vinegary.  Followed recipe exactly and used good balsamic.  Saw other reviews that would cut down on amount of vinegar. I agree.

I did this as a marinade. Cut the balsamic to less than half. It is needed to counter the ketchup taste. It was great on the grill. Don't see a need for all that boiling, the marinade is plenty thick if you just use less of the vinegar.

I didn't have ketchup so I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (and omitted the brown sugar) and these turned out juicy and tasty.  Of note--make sure you use non-stick spray in a grill pan or on the grill since this will stick.  The sugar in the ketchup or BBQ sauce stuck pretty badly, so clean up was difficult.  Punch up the italian inspiration with fresh oregano, instead of dried--add a pinch at the end and the aromatics are very nice.

LOVE this sauce! Got this recipe in an email and tried it tonight. Followed the recipe as written. Was a little hesitant when I smelled the balsamic but after it simmered it was perfect. Will definitely try this again with no changes. Great recipe!

I made this sauce for boneless chicken breasts. Since the sauce tasted pretty sour at first, I added an extra 1-4 cup of brown sugar. After simmering it, I used it to marinade the chicken for about two hours. A short time on the grill and the chicken came out moist and flavorful. I'll try it next with boneless pork chops.

We liked it A LOT!  4 1/2 stars. Used less of the balsamic, as others suggested, about 1/3 less. Just right. Produces a great carmelized coating on the grill.  I would add more salt and pepper and maybe garlic to bump up the flavor, but just a little so as not to cover the balsamic flavor. Delish.

I made it just as it read, and did it for 2 servings. While I didn't quite pick up the Italian in it, it really was awesome! Go light on the brown sugar...I cut it back by 1/2 a Teaspoon.

I'm not usually a huge fan of pork chops, but this sauce made them absolutely amazing. They weren't dry at all ...in fact they were cooked perfectly!! The only thing I did different was,  I made the sauce ahead of time and made sure it was completely cooled  before I marinated the porkchops in about half of the sauce. Then I used the rest of the sauce to baste the pork chops in between flipping them.

The pork chops turned out amazing. I followed the recipe and it couldn't have been easier. The only thing I would do next time is to let them sit in the sauce for a few minutes before putting them into the grill.

I thought this was fantastic!  Made the marinade exactly as written.  The chops were full of flavor and you don't need to marinate, which is great when you decide you want pork chops at the last minute and don't have time to marinate!  Thank you :)

My family loves this. For the record this "Italian BBQ Sauce" is great on chicken as well. I add dry mustard, onion powder, a touch of sage and Italian spices to it like oregano and rosemary. This sauce has become my standard sticky grilling sauce.
One review on here caught my eye that stated, "this smelled bad while cooking". Be careful when heating Balsamic Vinegar it burns very easily and if done so it will smell horrid! As soon as the mixture shows wanting to bubble turn it all the way down and let simmer for 20mins.

I thought this was great! A nice way to change up my pork chops. After reading other reviews, I decided to add 2 Tbsp. of olive oil (I have a Tuscan herb one- highly suggest), and cooked it a little while longer to thicken. I also salted & peppered my chops first & sprinkled with basil before adding marinade. I only marinated for 3-4 hours, next time I will do overnight, I bet they'll be that much better. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Who would've thought that those ingredients would turn out so well.  I made this for my family last night just how the recipe states and it turned out well. My kids ate the whole thing without any complaints. Also goes well with the Honey Ginger green beans in this app as well.

After cooking the sauce and tasting it, I thought too much vinegar and too sweet, but my opinion changed after I tasted the grilled chops.  Undoubtedly, it is a powerful basting sauce, but it worked well on two boneless pork chops which I'd brined for about 3 hours.  A definite repeat pork chop recipe for us.

This recipe is awesome! Totally made plain grilled pork chops even better! This is way better than putting just plain bottle BBQ Sauce on them. I may try to add some spice to this recipe to kick it up a notch. This is our favorite new pork chop recipe! Try it and you'll love it!

great sauce....surprising for how bad it smells while simmering! it makes your kitchen reek of vinegar, but don't be afraid to try it! the vinegar is barely tasted in the chops. I didn't have Dijon so I sub'd half yellow mustard and half horseradish sauce. I  recommend trying/tinkering with this one. I was skeptical about mopping raw meat from the start since it usually causes the sauce to scorch, but it turned out good.

Absolutely delicious and made even tough white meat tender. The sauce is so good and could be used on just about anything but really does wonders for plain old pork chops.  I have always struggled with grilling pork chops and these come out fabulous, tender and juicy even! Leftover sauce keeps well in the fridge for other uses.  Thanks for sharing a super recipe!

Excellent sticky sauce for messy and delicious pork chops! It does burn your nose while it simmers, so make ahead before the company arrives:) We really appreciated this twist on BBQ and will make it again!

I made the sauce and then cooked these in the crock pot for about 4 hours. They were delicious.

Delicious!  While I was afraid while cooking it that the balsamic vinegar would be too pungent, it tasted delicious!

I have never been a big fan of pork chops on the grill- until now. This recipe was so good I was already craving these again after 2 days.
