Ick!  This fruitcake (even though it was covered while baking) was dry, crumbly, dense and hard as a brick!!!  A small church near where I grew up used to make and sell a (very moist) light fruitcake as a fundraiser.  If anyone knows of a recipe like that please post!

There were a lot of complaints on this recipe(on the other listing as it appears twice). This recipe works great with a few modifications.
1. You can use any type of dried fruit to equal 6 cups total that you like, ie light/dark raisins, chopped dried apricots, dried cherries, cranberries, currants etc
2. Add 1 extra cup butter. Use a mix of sugars ie white, brown and splenda to equal 2 cups.
3. Add some cinnamon/nutmeg to enhance flavor
4. Finally and this is the key set the timer in 1 hour increments so it does not over bake as baking time of 3 hours will probably overbake and dry it out.
5. For those who like this you can add a couple of tablespoons rum every few days til Christmas and this also makes it moist and tasty.

The other reviews were pretty right on, this recipe is kind of dry and crumbly but...it makes really good toast and I even cut it into slices and then baked it and made a kind of biscotti and it was delicious. And the over all flavor of this fruit cake is really good, so dont give up on it just work on it a bit.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I replaced the almonds with pumkin seeds, and only baked for  2 hours. It came out dry and crumbly, although the flavor is good.
