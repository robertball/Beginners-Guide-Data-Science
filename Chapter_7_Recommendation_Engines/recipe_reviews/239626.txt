Since the ingredients didn't specify frozen hashbrowns I made with freshly shredded pre-baked russet potatoes and I think it  may need the frozen because my potatoes were mushy. Also, there was too much soup/cream cheese topping for me but maybe it just seemed like this because I cooked in a casserole dish (3 qt I believe) like instructions stated but I think it should state that you need to use a 13x9 pan for more surface area of potato to soup mixture.  Make sure to use FROZEN hashbrowns, use a 13x9 pan, add some seasoning to potatoes and use less of the soup mixture to top potatoes.  Also, make sure you use the fat free condensed soup because I didn't and I think it contributed to the oil that was at top of the finished dish.

I don't like to criticize another cook's recipe but this just seemed to be lacking something.  Seemed a little bland. I mixed some cheese into the actual casserole because I thought it seemed to be missing something when I was making it. Not a bad recipe and I think with a little tweaking would be pretty good.  Maybe some meat?

I used this as a base recipe (because I wanted to make cheesy potatoes with cream cheese in it) and added some extras.  I made this recipe with homemade, gluten-free, cream of chicken soup.  I also added a finely chopped white onion and some fresh garlic.  Then to the soup mixture I added 1/2 cup of greek yogurt to give it a bit of tang.  My family absolutely DEVOURED this - even my picky husband loved it.  It made quite a large batch so I froze half to use for a later meal.  Two thumbs up!
