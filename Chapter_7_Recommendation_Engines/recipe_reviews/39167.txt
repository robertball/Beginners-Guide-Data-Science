This recipie is just outstanding. I have been awaiting the arival of fall with much anticipation and this recipie is a yummy fall time treat for sure. I was concerned there was going to be too much spice in it but it was just right. The most time consuming part was peeling and dicing the pears. It went together very quickly and came out delicious and so very beautiful. It is best eaten warm out of the oven but I have been eating it cold and its still very good. It is a nice change from the ordinary fall/winter time desserts like pumpkin pie. It would be a very nice presentation as a holiday dessert. I really enjoyed making and eating this recipie.

This was delicious and so easy to make.  It's a beautiful presentation.  I served mine at room temperature and it was demolished by the crowd.  Best to use firm pears.  You can make it healthier by using Sucanat sugar instead of refined brown sugar.  I cooked it on tin foil, sprayed the foil with oil, but it ozzed and was difficult to transfer to a serving plate.  Next time I will try a non-stick pan but will spray it.  I only had a 10oz puff pastry but it still made two nice sized studels.

This is a wonderful dessert. I scimped on the brown sugar and added a little bit more of each spice along with allspice and vanilla powder. I cut the puff pastry into individual size servings which were cute but harder to braid attractively. Everyone loved it and I will certainly make it again.

This was so good, easy, and pretty.  I did have a lot of filling left over that I had to throw out b/c it did not fit in the 2 wrappers :( So maybe make less or make 3 instead of 2.  Also as a general rule don't brush too much egg on.  The flavors are somewhat delicate and you don't want the strudel to taste like a fried egg.

We thought that this was just OK. The ingredients seemed like they would go together better. Make sure that you dice up the pears small so that they will cook through. Will not make again. The presentation was why I gave it a 3 stars instead of 2 stars. My hungry teens didn't even want to finish their piece. Sorry.
