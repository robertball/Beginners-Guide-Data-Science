I made some changes to the flours in this recipe, so I can't give it a fair rating, but I like to post what didn't work out so others don't make the same mistakes that I did.  I used a GF flour mix with white rice, tapioca, and sweet rice instead of brown rice and sweet rice. I used teff grains instead of teff flour. I omitted the nuts. I also accidentally used 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1 Tbsp. My batter was soupy and the waffles rubbery. I added 1 C more GF flour, and that helped the texture. In the future, I'd reduce the amount of milk. It for sure needs salt, at least 1/2 tsp, I think.

I tried this recipe with one change as I didn't have any teff flour and never heard of it until seeing it in this recipe. I used corn meal and almond milk. 
Sprayed the waffle iron with "Pam Baking spray" and the waffles came out very good. They were a little crumbly but had a delicious taste and nice and brown. Maybe the Teff flour would help them hold together better?
