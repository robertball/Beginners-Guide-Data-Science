This was a very easy dessert to prepare.  My "glaze" didn't end up loking like the picture, but the whole family thought it was delicious. Has a mousse texture and taste. VERY RICH! Going to try it with a thin layer of raspberry filling next time.
****edit**** I did make this a second time using some seedless raspberry jam mixed into the top layer of this and then for the glaze, used whited chocolate instead of the semi-sweet chocolate and placed a few raspberries on top.  Also drizzled raspberry sauce on the top.  Makes for a very different dessert from the original recipe.  Both were very well received.

I am always hesitant to try a recipe that has not been made by several people, but I have to say the ingredients tempted me into giving it a try.  We did NOT regret it.    It was such a hot day when we made this so I froze it.  It turned out delicious.  I love that I could melt the ingredients in the microwave and didn't have to get out a double boiler.  The next time I make this I will definately double this recipe because it goes so fast.  It is VERY rich.  The pictures of it are way too HUGE to eat because it is so rich.

Edit:  After 5 1/2 years of making this it is still the chocolate dessert that my husband begs me to make.

I double the recipe and put it in a 9-in spring form pan, lined with parchment paper.

The final product looks amazing!

The flavor was okay, but I found it really hard to work with.  (mine got very sticky).  It was good, but probably wouldn't become a staple dessert for my family.

I put it in a small glass pan 8x8. It turned out great! Yummy! Perfect for chocolate lovers.

Not sure what I did wrong, but the chocolate pudding layer didn't set properly.  We spooned it into glasses & ate with spoons.  Of course it was still totally delicious!  Paired it with a cherry ice wine & it was a huge hit!
