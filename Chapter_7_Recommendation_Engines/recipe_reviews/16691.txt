This was a delicious recipe. Only thing I didn't like was that the dressing was not moist. So next time I will add 1 can of chicken broth to the dressing, butter and sage.  I added 2 cups milk to soup mixture and no water.  This makes a thicker gravy-type consistency.

I had a similar recipe years ago but it never "turned out."  This one definitely did!  Enjoyed every bite.  Made it the night before, refrigerated overnight, and put it in the oven when I came home from work - PERFECT!

Instead of all water, I use 1/2 milk, 1/2 water. Plus, I add a bag of frozen broccoli florets in the same layer as the chicken. I think it's yummy comfort food and family has enjoyed it.  It's not gourmet, but it does hit the spot and has your veggies in there!

I submitted this recipe years ago and never thought it got listed.... I was playing around today and found it.  Anyway, the actual recip I submitted was supposed to have cornbread stuffing, not herb seasoned.  Anyway, I think that is what makes this recipe unique (or did at the time I submitted it.)

I love this recipe idea and also tweaked it some. I only used one can of soup (cream of chicken) and one can of milk. I sauteed onions in the butter for the stuffing and used Stove Top stuffing mix. I reserved about one-third of the stuffing mixture and put it on the top before baking. The casserole was very, very good--almost custardy in texture but crispy on top, yummy!  Made lots of leftovers to freeze for a single gal, too, and it reheated well in microwave and oven!

Really easy to make.  When I make it again I will use a little less butter, as it was slightly greasy right after cooking.  I would recommend making it a day ahead of time as it was much better the next day.

I would give it ten if I could! My 15 year old is so picky. I cooked this recipe one evening because my husband loves stuffing. My son tried it and thought he had died and gone to heaven! I have to cook it now at least two times a week and there's never left overs! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! As my son would say, you are the bomb! LOL!

I almost never make a recipe without tweaking it a bit...  I added sauteed onions, bell pepper and garlic and a can of mushrooms to the stuffing and I thoroughly seasoned the chicken with sage, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I didn't have cream of chicken, so I used cream of mushroom with the cream of celery.  This was very easy to make, even with the additions, and it tasted more "complete" with all the extras in the stuffing and the chicken turned out tender and flavorful.  This one's a keeper, and I'll definitely make it again.

Let me say first, that I don't know how 1 pkg. of stuffing mix would be enough for this.  I used 2 and it still barely covered the bottom of my 9x13 pan.  I used cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup, chicken broth instead of water, and mixed the broth into the stuffing instead of the soup.  This was good, but it was definitely missing something.  I will play around with it, because I liked the idea and the family thought it was kind of like turkey and dressing.  Thanks!

I found the recipe bland and not very appetizing. I added green chilis, crushed cashews and corn to the dressing and it made it a bit more tasty. I found the cream of celery soup over dominated the taste of the dressing and chicken. If I were to make it again I would remove the celery soup.

So easy to make and very yummy.  My husband loved it too.  It was even better after re-heating a couple days later.  I followed some of the suggestions such as using milk and also chicken broth instead of water.  I also used some frozen veggies I had on hand.

I really enjoyed this meal, as did my family. It was incredibly easy to make, really gooey and tasty. I used chicken broth, just because I use that in almost everything as a substitute for water, and added some salt and pepper to the soup mixture, other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. Thanks for this, it is a definite keeper.

Loved this! Such comfort food. Used leftover chicken and added some frozen diced onions. Added a bit of poultry seasoning and about one cup or a cup and a half of chicken broth to the dressing. Next time I will just add water to the dressing mix or use low salt chicken broth. Used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. Added some celery seed on top and didn't add quite the amount of water suggested to the soup mixture. Will make again for sure.

I changed the recipe a bit by following the suggestions of other reviewers.  I sauteed onions and celery in the butter and seasoned them with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I added 1/2 can of Swanson's chicken broth to the stuffing mix. In another bowl I mixed the chicken pieces with 1 can Cream of Chicken and 1 can of regular whole milk, omitting the Cream of Celery.  I then poured over the stuffing mix and baked it for 45 minutes.  We enjoyed this dish and it does remind us of Thanksgiving dinner.

I loved this but I made a good amount of alterations. Instead of herb dressing I use cornbread. Also I mix the cornbread dressing with chicken stock and sauteed onions in butter until moist. Then I layer with a bag of mixed frozen veggies. I top that with cooked shredded chicken and then cover with a mix of 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery, and one can cream of chicken. Top it off with bread crumbs and bake. It barely fits in the 9x13 pan but it is soo good! We love it.

I made this recipe, only instead of using water, I used the chicken broth from where I boiled the chicken. It turned out really awesome. An easy recipe that I will do over and over.

Fantastic. Only thing I did different, I added milk. I split the water amount with milk using equal parts. Turned out great. My son said the stuffing part was thick but very good and said I can make that again. Thank you for sharing tasty and easy to make recipe.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning , 1/2 teaspoon of chicken soup base and 1 teaspoon of onion flakes to the buttered crumbs.  I used the broth from the cooked chicken instead of water.  I  had added celery and onion into the water that the chicken was cooked in.  I didn’t have a whole chicken so I used boneless thighs.  My husband liked it and he usually doesn’t like casseroles.

Yummy!  I added half a cup of chicken broth to the stuffing mixture.  Also, did half the water it asked and the rest chicken broth for more flavor.  It turned out a little too soupy for our liking so next time I'll add another 6oz. box of stuffing mix.

Hubby and I both love this recipe! I didn't have a whole chicken so I used chicken breasts that I baked and shredded. This was the only deviation I made from the original recipe. Both the chicken and the dressing were moist and tasty.

It tasted great, but so soupy, and I cut back a cup on the water. Maybe it was cooking at 4900 feet above sea level, I'm not sure. I think it would have alright with a second box of stuffing.

I made this and loved it, the few changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of water. I also doubled the cream of chicken  with no cream of celery. I used celery salt instead.
It's great!

It was too "soupy" and very mushy.

Good recipe - thanks for submitting.  AFter reading reviews, I also added 1 cup of milk and used 1.5 cups of water.  Will probably make again and may add onions next time.

Delicious BUT I added a can of chicken broth to the dressing & a sautéed onion.  Cut the butter in half. My picky eaters gobbled it up!

This was just okay and barely that.  I followed the recipe but added onion to the butter when it had melted and used chicken broth instead of water.  I thought the dressing mix would absorb the liquid, but there was just too much liquid for the amount of dressing mix.  The final product was too runny.  The flavor was okay, but won't be making this again.
