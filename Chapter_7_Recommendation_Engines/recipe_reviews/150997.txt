The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of five is that it was only perfect with some minor changes. Firstly, there is no actual pumpkin in Jell-O Pumpkin Spice Pudding. Not even artificial pumpkin flavor. It's just the spices that are usually added to pumpkin pie. That in mind, I added half a can of Libby's pumpkin to the pudding as I was mixing it up. This made such a huge difference in the flavor. Second, you don't have to spend all this time making honey glazed pecans yourself. I bought cinnamon glazed pecans at my local grocery store and they tasted a million times better for no effort. Third, I dusted the top of the pie with some pumpkin pie spice. With my changes, this pie was absolutely KILLER. I will probably be bringing it to one of the Thanksgiving dinners I'll be attending this year!

Note to anyone trying this recipe..you have to use the Pumpkin Spice Jell-O.  It is hard to find, but luckily I stocked up last year!  This pie is AMAZING and is so simple and easy.  It makes a dense, sweet (but not too sweet) pie that is sure to please your pumpkin pie purists.  Enjoy!!

This was a really wonderfully flavored pie for pumpkin lovers. However, DEFINITELY make it the night before you serve it because it will not set up in just an hour like they request. It ran after cutting slices after setting for 3 hours.

This was so easy to make (the most difficult part is finding the pudding in stock at the store), and tastes almost like a real pumpkin pie!  I used skim milk and light cool whip, so this is a tasty treat for fewer calories.

LOVE LOVE LOVE........followed exactly and it is now a holiday favorite, and an anytime favorite because it works with every pudding flavor. Use choclolate pudding and make the best chocolate cream pie, good also with banana pudding and fresh banana slices in between the 2 layers. This thanksgiving we did a butterscotch version, and everyone really loved it.

Simple and easy!  goes together in under 5 minutes--but you have to make sure you get the jello at the store when you see it--not all stores carry it and the one near me only gets it in once a year and when it's gone, it's gone.  Yummy, easy, fun!

Very tasty!  I used skim milk and sugar-free Cool Whip. Unlike some other reviewers, I did NOT think it needed more pumpkin added. It was great as is and super easy! I also omitted the pecans as we don't really like them.

I will be making this with my Life Skills students for Halloween - we will use the little tart graham cracker shells and substitute a variety of candies for the pecans so that each child can make a "jack-o-lantern" - they can't wait!

This is delicious! The best part is that there's no baking required, so it's quick and easy to throw together on a whim. It's very light (unlike pumpkin pie). Mine didn't come out quite a pretty as the picture, but the taste was awesome and I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving.

An awesome alternative to Pumpkin pie. The first time I saw this I thought, well that's interesting. Then I tasted it...  TERRIFIC!!!!  I now make this every year for Thanksgiving, and sometimes just for the fun of it. The only thing that stinks, is that, living in North Dakota, I can't always find the pudding mix in my area. However, I have found that you can get it online!!

Super easy and fast to make!  I've used different pudding mixes, since the Pumpkin Spice is seasonal, and it always turns out great!  Sets quickly, just mix blend really well.  Instead of the pecans, I sprinkled baking spice on top, and it was still delicious!
