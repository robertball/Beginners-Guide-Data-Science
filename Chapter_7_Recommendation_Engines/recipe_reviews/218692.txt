I have been making this recipe for years as it is delicious.   I got the recipe from my mother in law and it is my husbands favorite.  She always used shortening instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts chopped fine.  I have made them with butter flavor shortening which I really prefer.  I also made them with butter but really prefer the shortening. My husband is diabetic so this is his "treat" at Christmas.  His mother passed away many years ago so I feel sure it brings back good memories.

I was so happy when I found this recipe! My mother made these every year for the holidays for as long as I can remember.I have searched her recipe boxes and couldn't find this recipe. She is now in a nursing home and asked me to make refrigerator cookies for her as a treat. After making numerous recipes from other cooks and not quite getting the cookie she remembers,this recipe has put a smile on my Mama's face! If you are looking for an original icebox cookie,this is the one! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I received this recipe from my grandmother. She always had cookies on hand to serve her guests. These are one of my favorite cookies! The cinnamon can be over-powering to someone who doesn't care for a lot of spice. The nice thing with these cookies is that cinnamon can be substituted for something else or eliminated all together. If cinnamon is too strong,  I  suggest a spice combo such as allspice, nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon. I would use ginger the least (no more than 1/4 to 1/2teaspoon) until you know how it will taste in this recipe. Sometimes, my grandmother omitted cinnamon and the nuts and used an extract...lemon for example. If you use an extract, use carefully, as you are adding extra liquid to the batter.

Not what I was looking for in an ice box cookie. I wanted more of a butter cookie and didn't care much for the cinnamon.

But for the walnuts, it was just like those my mom made when I was a child. Being from the south, pecans are the nut of choice.   Delicious with either nut you decide to use.
