This is by far one of the better beer batter recipes out there. I did end up adding more beer to give mine more of a pancake batter type of consistancy, and if you don't have a favorite dipping sauce, you'll want to add something more for flavor.  I ended up using some Walla Walla sweet onions and it turned out great!  

One tip... rather than drudging the onion before dipping it, I just threw my sliced onions in a gallon size bag with the flour and gave them all a good shake at the same time, it really cut down the mess.

This is wonderful recipe. The batter must be of pancake batter consistancy.  So add extra beer as needed.
Recipe as written is good.  But on our second batch we decided to add some spices to see if it would make them more flavorfull.  We really enjoyed them better with the spices. We added some paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, red pepper, extra salt.

This works well, I ended up dipping them in flour, then batter, then flour again, then batter again, and they came out beautifully crunchy. First time frying onions; next time would use more spices in the flour/batter/both :)

Best. Onion Rings. Ever.

LOVED EM!  Thank you for this easy delicious recipe!  I had to add more beer like the others but boy was it worth it.   I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't have enough onion so I dunked a turkey sandwich in the batter and deep fried it like a Bennigans Monte Cristo.  And it was soooooo good. I think I've fulfilled my fried food quota for the next six months after what I ate today!

I have to admit, I was afraid to make these...I hadn't deep-fried anything before, but these turned out fabulous!  Easy easy easy to make.  I did use about twice the amount of beer than called for.  I used Heineken but I think the next time, I will use Nut Brown Ale, as the beer flavor didn't come through very strong.  No leftovers, it all went fast and now they are having me make more this week! **Update** I made them again with Newcastle Nut Brown Ale and you could taste the beer more, it had a deeper flavor.  I will make them with the Nut Brown Ale from now on.

Excellent batter! I added a ton more beer to make it thinner. Made this for a fish fry and received a ton of compliments. Will definitely make this one again!

I think the batter is awesome. I added more beer aswell and used the "flour in bag and shake 'em" method. I'm German and I'm looking for authentic american recipes 'cause my wife was born and raised in Texas and I makes her feel just a little bit more like home!!!

These were great! I used 3-4 Vidalia onions, and added seasoning salt &  a little paprika to the batter, and once they were fried. I had to use about 2 bottles of beer, to thin this batter out. This made TONS of onion rings. This is time consuming so be sure you have extra help in the kitchen while making dinner. I had Mr. grilling burgers while I cooked these, and kept them warm in the oven on low until ready to eat. We all loved them, and made our homemade burgers into Western with Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce found at AR.

We just tried this recipe and it was ok. I'm only giving it three stars because the proportion seemed to be way off when it came to the amount of liquid to make it a dip-able batter. When only using the 1 cup of liquid (beer) as stated, it made such a big glutenous glop on my wire wisk, I had to add A LOT more beer to make is a good batter consistency.

This batter worked great!  I used a specialty beer from Rogue breweries.  Be sure you use a beer that would taste good on its own and like others have stated you need more beer than called for.   You also need to add spices for some flavor, I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  Although they would be pretty bland done as written, I still give this recipe 4 stars because the batter worked so well.  They are crispy, light and stuck together well.   Definitely try these!

i did not care for this recipe and would have given it a 3 but my brother liked it and thought it should get a four. it needed a lot more beer than called for and a lot more seasoning as it was very bland. we added garlic powder, salt, pepper, chilli powder, and paprika. we also battered some sweet potato which was quite tasty and different. overall, the recipe needed so many changes that i will prob try a different one next time.

This recipes has some good ideas. Beating the egg whites first, then adding to the batter is a great way to lighten up the batter. The batter needs seasoning. I had to add salt, pepper, garlic powder just to get any kind of flavor. I also had to add 3x more beer to get the right consistence. I sliced one onion 5/8 inches thick and was enough for 4 people to eat as a side dish. This recipes has to many flaws in it to be good.

This is perfection! I've used this recipe for a few superbowl parties now and I get alot of requests. I made the mistake of trying the old fashioned recipe from this site and was so highly disappointed. For now on I will always use this recipe!

Turned out great, we actually double dip the onions into batter. Put first coat on, threw in the fridge for a bit and then dipped them again. The spicing is something that will have to be tweaked to ones liking but we used salt garlic pepper and some paprika and used seasoning salt when they came out. Tasty just needed tweaking but could be perfected after a few attempts.

These were great! I used organic whole wheat flour. I did have to add about 1/ - 1/2 c more beer to get rid of the doughy consistency though (which I attribute to my choice of flour)My kids loved them, even the one that doesn't like onion rings when we eat out. Definitely going to try adding different seasoning to the batter. Thanks so much for sharing!

I've never cooked onion rings before, but by the time I tasted the first one, I could tell this was a recipe to keep! I also wound up adding extra beer as the batter was too thick, but it turned out amazing.

Hubby and kiddos loved them!  Did have to give 4 stars as I had to use about 1 1/2 bottles of beer for the batter to get the pancake consistency everyone talked about in reviews. Also added quite a bit of seasoning salt, some garlic salt, and some paprika.  (Only added the extra seasoning after making a few, and hubby tasting them and saying they needed the seasoning.)  Would've given 5 stars if it weren't for this.  Really easy to make. :)

Needs a lot more beer than it says.   Needs a LOT more seasoning. This was an extremely bland batter, and the saving grace for these onion rings was my ranch dressing. I even put paprika, but it is desperately crying out for more seasoning of any/all kinds!!  Also, not by fault of recipe: Needs a strong beer to get some flavor in there (I used Budweiser and it honestly didn't flavor it at all)

I did these on the stove, in about an inch of heated oil (I used a candy thermometer to get the oil to the right temp). One cup of beer worked great, & my mom asked "where'd you get these?!" :)  I sprinkled salt on them as they cooled on the paper towels.  Thanks!

My family loved these. It's messy to make but fun to eat. Served with ranch and making more today. I'm adding seasoning this time. Garlic powder and Creole seasoning. For taste!

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed it almost exactly. My only tweak was that I used a whole bottle of Guinness and a bit of water. I took another reviewer's advice that the batter should resemble pancake batter. This was a good call. The onion rings came out perfectly, and we even had them for leftovers the next day. (I reheated them at 400 degrees F, for about ten minutes until they were crispy.)

I was looking for a great batter recipe. I tried this and I love it. I did add some pepper and garlic salt just cause I put it in everything I cook. I used this recipe for mushrooms too and it was fantastic. Easy to make and cheap no more going to a restraunt and paying 7.95 for an appitezer of shrooms. For my onion rings I did the same and seasoned them with Andy's seasoning salt after they were cooked and served with a side of HOMEADE ranch dressing.......diffenitly going to be a regular in our home and for the superbowl

We loved these.  My husband added baking powder, garlic powder, season salt and chili powder to kick it up a bit.  Very nice batter...stayed on the onion and not all throughout my grease. Will use this recipe every time we make onion rings.

Not too bad! Very tasty, but needed salt and pepper, and maybe an extra spice to your liking--Old Bay, Emeril's Essance, garlic salt, etc...

I loved the lightness and crispiness of this batter. It was exactly what I was looking for.  I just used the batter recipe to fry something else, not onion rings, but I followed the recipe for the batter.  I would have given it 5 stars, but reading the recipe I saw there was little seasoning, so I used the seasoning ratios from another batter from this site.

GREAT!!  Works wonderfully with mushrooms as well.  Probably would work with anything you wanted to batter. I made myself a little short cut and it was still the best batter I have used.  I skipped the step of rolling the onions in the plain flour, went straight to the batter and it was THE BEST!!

As others suggested, I used more beer than called for in the recipe. I used one full bottle --would have used more, but that's all I had left.  These onion rings turned out very good, using 2 medium-sized Vidalia onions. It made just enough as a side dish to burgers for a family of 6.  Next time, I will add some seasoning to the batter; it could use a little salty/spicy to complement to sweetness of the onions.

This is fabulous, just the recipe I was looking for!  I did end up using more beer than called for, like others, but I usually use the liquid called for as a guide, adjusting more or less as necessary.  I thought this recipe was perfect just as is.  I didn't change the seasonings at all.  I froze most of the recipe, reheating them on a heat-safe cake rack in the oven.  Not as good as freshly made, but still very yummy without all the mess.  This recipe is terrific, and works great for just about any vegetable.  You MUST try it!!!

Best Beer batter onion rings at home I have every made!! I used Bud light, b/c it is what I had on hand, the recipe would benefit from a more flavorful beer. As well my favorite beer battered onion rings are a bit sweeter, so I added about 3 tablespoons sugar, made a huge difference. Lastly I used a madeline on the largest setting mine will go (only has to thicknesses, really thin and slightly thicker) and after doing a few I realized I wish I had just cut them by hand they needed to be alot thicker. Overall these were the easiest and tastiest home onion rings I have tried in a long time.

With the recipe as printed, I got dough rather than batter, but after adding the rest of the can of beer, these turned out fairly well.  They definitley need some seasoning salt or something mixed in with the flour, but they were awesomely crispy.  Thumbs up!

Batter came out too thick and was unable to use it. I checked the amounts and ingredients several times but i followed the recipe.

I'd try something else instead next time.

Great base batter.  Added a bit more seasoning then called for.  I was frustrated with handling the rings, and then had the brilliant idea to slice the last onion in wedges. The onion "petals" handled very nicely, held up better in the oil and were great for scooping up dipping sauce.  I will use this recipe again.

I LOVE this recipe.  I doubled the beer (one bottle).  My family snarfed them down!  My 9 year old said "Now you have something to brag about" after eating them!  We dipped them in blue cheese dressing...YUM!

The amount of beer depends on what type of beer you are using. When we used dark beer we used about 50% more, but when we used the light beer the recipe was spot on.  I think it tastes better when made with darker beer, and the batter is less dense.

Pretty good...could really use some more seasoning, though.  Next time I'd maybe add some salt/pepper/onion powder/etc into the flour.

These were so yummy!! We added season salt & garlic salt into the batter before frying; tasted a little bland without it. Tried with both white & yellow onions and liked yellow the best.

Wonderful.  Light, and fluffy.  It is a keeper.  My only suggestion would be to alter the recipe so that the flour used for dregging is listed 1st, then the rest for the batter.  For a new cook, it could be confusing.  Thanks

My husband and I both thought this batter was extremely good! It has a very good taste. It was quite messy though! The only problem I had while deep frying these were a couple of them stuck to my basket and burnt. So when I made my second batch I made sure I kept shaking the basket now and then and used a utensil to sir them a little. All in all, this is a great recipe for a delicious batter I am sure I will use time and time again!

Very good, even though I did not do the egg white part. I will next time to see the difference. I just mixed the eggs with the beer, added salt and paprika then the flour. I did not used the butter either. Deep fried them and they were great. I also used more beer than called for.

This is the best batter I've ever made.
It was a bit of work but well worth it.
The onion rings came out so light and crispy. But I had so much batter left. I think the next time I'll only make a half recipe because there is only my husband and I.  Wonder if this batter can be frozen?  I doubt it though, seems like it would turn watery when thawed.  Anyone ever tried to freeze the remaining batter?
Thanks LaDonna for a great recipe.

This recipe didn't have alot of reviews but the ones it did have were great. I agree this is the best onion ring recipe I have ever tried or ever eaten for that matter.My husband said keep cooking these are great. My neighbor was over, she sliced a large onion and made a plateful for her and her husband, they loved them too. This recipe is definitely a keeper for 2 families now. No more searching, this is perfect, mouth watering and delicious!! Thanks LaDonna!

This is the best batter for onion rings, eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, squash, etc.  I've tried many over the years and my husband likes this one best.  Just keep adding beer until it is pourable.

Made one batch as recommended, ended up adding more beer because the batter was too thick. Either way this recipe NEEDS seasoning and a dipping sauce.

These are amazing, and super easy. I also added more beer to get the right consistency and added some seasoning. Came out lovely!

You HAVE to add at least 2 more cups of liquid.
If you don't have beer, you can use soda water, just add a little salt.
Make sure your oil is about 330 prior to frying. 
I like to add Lawry's seasoning, about 2 tbsp. You can also use Cajun seasoning.
Sweet yellow onions, or Vidalia onions are best.
This batter will work well  for fish!

I made these, with a few changes, I added Old Bay Seasoning to the flour, and Cayenne Pepper. 

One tip, I took out the "silver skin" on each onion ring, made a huge difference.

These turned out really good. I was in a hurry, so I didn't let it sit as long as the recipe called for. I realized that the wait time is important for letting the batter thicken to the right consistency, so I'll do that next time. The batter is pretty bland, so I had to add a bunch of hot sauce and herbs to give it flavor without a bunch of salt. This will probably be my go-to recipe.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious and light.  I was a little concerned when I was "battering" because of the thickness and density of the batter but they came out perfect!

I'm not gonna lie, I was really worried this would come out badly because I decided to be lazy and not follow the directions. I was so wrong! Beat the whole eggs without separating; added butter, beer, and spices (garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper); mixed in flour; and then after waiting about 15-20 minutes started frying up my onions. Turned out YUM! The real test, though, was the husband and he loved them.

These onion rings were quite delish!!  Even used the same batter for some fried pickles.  They were some of the best pickles we ever had.  As the other reviews stated the batter definitely needed more beer than 1 cup.  I used a whole 12oz can and a smidge more.  perfect!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Hey I will be the first to admit I simply just put the flour, eggs and beer together with a pinch of salt, waited the 30-mins and started dunking the onions into the pancake like batter. What came out is the best onion rings I've ever enjoyed and not just because I made them... but because this recipe rocks!

I tried these tonight for dinner.  I wish I had a picture but we ate them all!  They turned out great, I was a little skeptical during the process and I did add extra beer so as other have said so I thought I would describe what it looks like.

After mixing the first set of ingredient I wound up with a very thick substance that looked an awful lot like bread that hadn't risen.  So after an hour, I added the other 4 ounces of beer, still a little thick, but I pressed on and added the egg whites.  Shazam!  Thick pancake batter, then I knew I was on the right track, and things hand't gone terribly wrong.

I'm too clumsy to accomplish the flour->batter->oil process alone so I had a helper and we made great time.  I would completely recommend these even to the beer-batter novice (which I am)!  Be careful of the temperature of the oil, which as all things frying, lowers over time, in order to make sure it's not too hot or too cool so you get the lightweight fry but cooked onions.  We even cut up cauliflower for the rest of the batter and they were divine as well.

This recipe worked well but wasn't very "wet", kept having to loosen it up with more beer. as far as "to taste" I found that about 1 tablespoon of salt did really well.

After reading the reviews we initially tried dredging the onions through corn meal laced with Cajun pepper and salt. Finding that the results came out like donuts. We then thinned the batter with additional beer (again as other reviewers had suggested}. Finally we gave up dredging and went to just the batter which we had already doctored up with Cajun and Salt in addition to the beer. By now we were so full and bloated with the samples we were just OVER IT LOL!! Off to the trash it went!! On to the next recipe..next time!!!

For those with celiac, try any gluten-free beer instead of regular beer, and gluten-free all purpose flour- worked like a charm! Agree with everyone else about more beer... Used almost a full bottle.

Really good, a big hit.  I also needed more beer (approx 18 fl oz/1.5 bottles of Bass Ale) to keep a consistency suitable for dipping.  Added some onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper to the batter in addition to the salt.  So good!

Not good for deep fryers, sticks to the basket too much.

This was a great recipe!!!!! I too had to add alot more beer to the mixture but otherwise they were fantastic. Also, if you find they are lacking a little flavor just salt them once you remove them from the fryer.

Very good recipe.  The batter turn out very thick, so I ended up putting the whole can of beer in the batter to make it thinner.  I did not add the salt because of the butter.  Instead I added coarse ground pepper.  Will make again.

Really good!  I also used quite a bit more beer than the recipe called for - like a bottle and a half.  The onion rings were light and crispy.  I can't wait to try it with zucchini!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  The batter came out more like a dough so I had to add way more beer.  I guess I'll keep looking for a beer batter for onion rings.

I feel bad for giving such a bad rating but I have to agree with the review ihopethatsnotacricket. The batter was very thick, didn't stick, and had no flavor. They tasted like onions coated in plain flour.

Oh my goodness, these were so good! Will have to be a special treat though, because they are a lot of work. Also, I had to nearly double the beer but it was worth it.

Boy, I sure hope that not everyone's turns out this bad!! First of all I was trying to coat cheese cubes. Well, it didnt work! The batter tasted bland to begin with and second it didnt stick to them. The "batter" looked more like taffy. I followed the directions exactly, but something HAD to be wrong... KEEP LOOKING for a different recipe! It just tastes bland and makes a mess and wastes a perfectly good beer.
