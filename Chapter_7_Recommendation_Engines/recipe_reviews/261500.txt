We thought this was delicious although I did have to make mine a little differently then recipe.  I only had chicken thighs on hand and didn't have any fresh lemons.  I browned my chicken in my instant pot and sprinkled lemon pepper, salt, paprika and garlic powder on each side as it was browning.  Once browned I added my chicken broth as recipe listed and since I wanted this to be a full meal in one pot I added two med. size onions, cut in wedges, several peeled potatoes also cut to be about the size of new potatoes and 4 carrots peeled and cut in large bite size pieces.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on my veggies then tossed them before adding to my pot and sprinkled some parsley flakes just for looks.  I set my instant pot for 25 minutes and once done I let the pressure release on it's own since my pot was pretty full and to give a little more time under pressure to make sure all my veggies were done.  Wonderful one pot meal.  Will be making again.  Thanks for sharing!

Meh, don’t like it.  I’ve tried this twice, both times the skin was unappealing. First time followed directions exactly, second time did the same and tried to crisp the skin up in the oven afterwards - sadly, still disappointed.  This is a great recipe if you’re not planning to serve the chicken as the meal’s centerpiece or your oven’s too dirty to handle an hour at 450°, but if you are serving the bird as the main dish, standing alone... Stupid Simple Roast Chicken is a lot easier and (not including rest time) takes the same amount of time to cook (1 hr) once you add in sautéing, pressuring up, natural release, etc. and makes a much prettier centerpiece. (Trick to Stupid Simple Chicken - dry completely before roasting.)  This recipe is a great complement for a main course chicken dish that doesn’t require skin and makes an amazing broth for gravy - but really, save your instant pot for the sides.

The best chicken I have ever made.  Close to rotisserie chicken but not as crisp on the outside.  I followed the recipe exactly but had a chicken 1 pound larger so added 5 minutes cooking time.  The chicken close to the lemon was delicious and would love that flavor deeper in the chicken but not sure that is possible.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

The recipe made for a delicious chicken. However, It was very hard to plate. It completely fell apart. I will make it again, but next time, after the initial browning, while it's out of the pot, I will let it cool a bit and truss it up good before putting it back in the pot breast side down. No one complained though about it falling apart. I served it with au gratin potatoes, air fried brussels sprouts, and honey glazed carrots It was a Sunday dinner so I went all out. lol

Recipe came out ok.  I could’ve used more seasoning.  Flavors were mild and I used lemon pepper seasoning as well as fresh lemons.  Do not be afraid to season more. Chicken was super tender and juicy. Delightful overall.

My chicken was 3.65 lbs, the smallest one I could find in my market.  I used the Poultry setting, 20 minutes high pressure and then let it Keep Warm for 60 minutes.  Also, I peeled 4 whole carrots, and placed on top of the bird, perfection.

The flavor of everything with the lemons and seasonings, amazing and easy.  

I made baked potatoes in the oven, great meal.

No changes made and we all loved this.  All 4 grandsons agreed that should be a regular on the menu.  I used a 5.5 lb chicken and set the pressure time for 34 minutes.  Let it on the “keep warm” setting for 1.5 hours while we watched movie.  I removed the chicken, cooled it a little then shredded the meat and put the meat back in the cooking liquid.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I make chicken in my instant pot a lot. When I do a whole chicken though, I always use whole potatoes as a trivet instead of the metal one and wallah, instant side dish! And the potatoes taste fabulous with all those juices dripped amd cooked right into them!!

Very easy to make but the seasoning all fell off. I had to take the chicken off the bone and then soak it in the juices/seasoning to have any flavor.

This is a great go to for making a whole chicken! Mine was 4.5lbs so I cooked it for 28 minutes. It was very moist. The lemon flavor is rich in the pan drippings. I should have browned mine longer, but all in all a good chicken recipe for the Instant Pot!

I agree with most reviewers.  You can't get a roasted chicken with a pressure cooker.  It's not the correct style of cooking.  The skin turned out pale and soft.  It didn't bother me.  It made a nice stock that I think I will use to make a soup.  The taste was nice with the lemon.  I don't think I would make it again for a "Rotisserie" chicken.

Great recipe.  Easy to make and flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.  I think next time I will try adding a quartered onion in the cavity along with the lemon.

This method for cooking chicken is fantastic! The meat was fall off the bone! I literally tried to remove the leg and the bone slipped clean out.  Just FYI the skin doesn't get crispy  even with browning it first (didn't bother me). I added a little butter during the browning process.

I did add half a cup of extra water to the bottom - I ended up with about 3 cups of drippings.

Although I loved the pure lemon flavour it needs a bit more. Next time I am going to play with the herbs & spices.

This was very good. I used white wine to deglaze added a little broth, then potatoes and the chicken on top, with the rest of the broth. Made a nice gravy out the juice.

I prefer crispy skin from oven baked chicken. The liquid made an outstanding gravy and this is worth keeping just for that!

It tastes fine, but the skin is not very appetizing. .   
Any tips on browning the skin more? I think I will go back to using the oven.

Smallest chicken I could get was nearly 4 lbs.  I used garlic pepper seasoning with paprika for the rotisserie flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I set my pressure cooker for 30 minutes cook time with natural pressure release for 20 minutes, and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The skin was not crispy, but it didn’t matter as I pulled the meat off the bone to make buffalo chicken soup, which turned out wonderfully!

I thought this turned out great. Yes, the skin is not appetizing and it fell apart taking it out of the pot. However, the meat is tender and tasty. We had it for dinner with rice the first night, and the leftovers were used in quesadillas and soup.

Flavor was nice but it’s definitely not roast chicken.  More like pressure cooked chicken.  Made great stock afterwards!

Excellent recipe and I added fresh rosemary and sage to the rub as well - only reason not 5 star is because legs got really dried out - may have been too long to depressurize on my Instant pot - but will definatley make again!
