Yes quadrupled the recipe, my family isn't small. I used 2 whole beaten eggs instead of egg white.  Added almond extract as well as vanilla extract. It tasted great. My family loved them.  Oh I cut the amount of salt since I used salted butter. If you like marzipan, you will love these.

I made these for my husband, he said they were a "make again" recipe; he said they tasted like amaretto instead of shortbread, so I might try substituting Amaretto liquor instead of the extract next time.

I doubled the recipe, used both vanilla and almond extracts, truvia instead of splenda, and put about half a tube of almond paste.  I also made a glaze of powdered sugar and almond extract and milk.  It was great.  Next time I will make them a little thicker as I think I flattened them too much.

Ok. First thing, this was the very first keto recipe I have ever made and I’m SUPER impressed. The taste is phenomenal! It doesn’t specify in the recipe but I always use salted butter in any recipe regardless of whether or not it calls for salt. I recommend refrigerating your dough for about 15 minutes then actually rolling it out to an even 1/4inch thickness. I pressed mine down and it just didn’t cook as evenly as it could. I think I’ll be making these again but adding some cinnamon or ginger.

Loved the flavour and texture!  Timing was a little tricky - if left in for full 20 minutes they were a little dark on the bottom, but taken out earlier they were a little underbaked inside.  Will try to flatten them more next time.
