This salad is very good served over lettuce.  I also used Doritos instead of corn chips and it added extra zing! It's very good!

This was just okay....My family didn't really care for it.  I don't think that I'll be making this again, but thanks for sharing.

Really great!  I served with lettuce and sour cream.  Definatly add the cilantro.  The leftovers were great as a chunky dip.

I added black olives and served on shredded lettuce.  My 10 yr old son didn't like the dressing.  With the leftovers, I added salsa and sour cream - even better!!!

We definitely enjoyed this, but it works better as a dip than a salad.  If I made again, would most likely serve with a scoop shaped corn chip rather than on top of them.

We make this recipe without the onions, use cheese cubes instead of shredded and add small pieces of green bell pepper.  It is perfect for a day at the park or camping.

I agree it is great served over lettuce as well as the chips. I added yellow bell pepper but it would have been just as good without.  Great change from taco salad and very easy to prepare and serve. Husband enjoyed it also and asked that I make it again (which makes it a 5 star recipe in my book!)

This is a great base but this is the way I tried it the second time around. Drain ranch beans and pour in bowl. Add small grated onion, one package taco mix and 3/4 cup catilina dressing. Cover tightly and set in frig overnight. Next day spoon over your favorite salad. add tortia chips and cheese salsa and sour cream or other fav Mexican condiments
