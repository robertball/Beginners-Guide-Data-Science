A wonderful recipe, but why all the steps to prepare it?  I put everything but the meat into a large bowl.  Mix that up well and then add the meat.  If your kids won't eat chunks of anything like onion.  put the broth into the blender with whatever veggies you like (onion, peppers, celery, etc.), and blend.  You get all the flavor and nutrition.  There are only two of us, but I make the whole recipe, divide the finished meat loaf into 6 portions; put 5 of them into Tupperware square rounds and put them into the freezer.  Then we can have meatloaf at the drop of a hat, whenever I can't think of whatever else to have for dinner.  I love having something this good without having to cook.

I was a little skeptical during preparation because of the all the oatmeal, but it was delicious!  I've tried 100's of meatloaves and are always just "okay", but, this one my husband even claimed to be better than his Mother's Famous Recipe!

This recipe is fabulous- it has been named the "best meatloaf ever" in our house.  
It has great flavor and did not crumble.

My changes- I halved the recipe and also added minced carrots.

Thanks for the great recipe!

I think that this is the worst meatloaf I have ever had or made.  I was embarrassed to serve this to my husband.  it smelled great cooking, but came out bland, mushy, and with a horrible texture.  there is no saving this recipe.  I can't believe I wasted money, food and time on this disaster.  Does anyone know what meatloaf is supposed to taste like? apparently not.

There is no messing up this recipe! I also cut the recipe in half (6 servings) and added Monterey jalape√±o cheese for a little zip.

This was ok, the flavor was great but I found that the cheese made it greasy. I will try this again using ground turkey to reduce the fat and less cheese baked in. Other than that, this recipe has the best flavor and texture I've found.

This is very good. My meatlof came out a bit "loose" and broke easily when I tried to remove it from the pan. The taste was good and DH really liked it. I love the addition of the oatmeal for fiber, but wonder if that led to it falling apart. I'm sure I will make this again!

Finally found a meatloaf recipe my son likes.  I prefer a little BBQ sauce or ketchup on top so I will make that addition the next time.  Also I sauteed the onion and celery, again personal preference.

This is a great meatloaf. I made mine in a "meat-loaf pan"which has an insert that keeps the loaf high ehough to let accumulated grease drip off. For those that had a problem with crumbling; I find that if I mix the loaf and let it set for at least 2 hours in the frige before baking, it will set up better. Also, meatloaf has to "rest", just as a roast or other cuts of meat do before serving. My only other hint is to use havarti or gruyere cheese. They seem to give lots of flavor without the "greasy" problem.

I cut this down to 6 servings. I ground my oats down in my food processor so they wouldn't have been as noticable. Instead of thyme and basil on it's own, I added a heaping teaspoon of italian seasoning (my homemade italian seasoning has both thyme and basil included with their other spices).I used Campbell's condensed beef broth and I also added a heaping teaspoon of worchestershire sauce, for extra flavor. This still made a decent sized meat loaf--enough to fill a 9 inch square pan. A little over an hour at 350* and it was done. For me, I was not a fan of this (though I will say I loved the flavor that the beef broth gave to the meat loaf) and my husband ate it, but he thought it needed a little more. We both thought it was quite mushy and even after cooling a little in the pan, it was still mushy textured. That said, my two boys loved this meat loaf and that surprized me because the littlest does not like most meat loaves. My oldest ate two and a half pieces and my youngest ate two small pieces. Out of the whole 9 inch square pan, two small pieces remain. I'd make this again BUT I'd use something else to bind besides oats, my husband and I thought a mixture of breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese and a little ground pork would be a good addition that would definitely firm up the meat loaf and add a little something that we think it's missing. I almost made a gravy to go over the top and I'm kicking myself that I didn't. I think this meat loaf needs a gravy.

This is great! I took it a step further. I rolled the entire mix to an inch thick and squared it out. Then I added 6 cups cooked mashed potatoes and wrap meat around and seal. Place meatloaf in large pan and bake on 350 for 2 hours. Enjoy!

Did I miss something?  I see from the picture that you served some sort of gravy on this meatloaf and maybe that's what it needed.  It seemed bland and too cheesy.

I give this 3 stars because it needs some adjusting. The first thing I would do differently (and I did the 2nd time) was to use ground turkey instead of beef to make it healthier. For those that found it loose.. I'll tell ya why. The broth is unneeded, go lighter on the cheese and make sure you buy a good cheese or else you will get a greasy taste to it. My biggest thing.. a meat loaf should always start with your meat room in a large bowl, dump everything on top of it and MIX WITH YOUR HANDS! Every meat loaf I've ever had that was delish was mixed by hand. If you dont want to put your bare hands in then put on some gloves like you wear when you color your hair or see at the doctors office. You will see a world of difference if you mix it right!

I customized this by using quinoa instead of oatmeal for more nutrition.  Sauteed the onion & celery and used fat free cheese.  Worked like a charm.

wonderful, wonderful....from reading reviews I cut back a little on the beef broth, I used lean ground beef as the recipe called for. I can't understand why others had "loose" texture for their meat loaf. Maybe they didnt use lean beef as suggested. If using regular hamburger I could understand the fat in hamburger meat making the meat loaf and not binding as it should???

I'm always on the lookout for different ways to make old favorites and I really liked this.  But beware...this makes a HUGE meatloaf.  I didn't read ahead to see how much meat it called for until I had already started.  But we can use the leftovers for lunches.  I only had about 1 1/2 cups of cheese and that seemed to be enough.  I didn't put any on top.  I might cut back on the celery next time as I found it a bit too strong but all in all, this tasted great!

This was a good way to add fiber to our diets without the taste. This was a great option to the same old meatloaf. More of a mashed potato and gravy meatloaf then a ketchup and scalloped potatoes.

This is a fair recipe for meatloaf, not great.  It's funny how everyone has an idea of how a meatloaf should be made.  The cheese- to me is just an added fat that doesn't help the taste at all.  This recipe has a lot of steps that are time consuming & it 's flavor was pretty blah.  I did cut it in half because my family is small but I don;t think that should alter the recipe's taste.  This just isn't what I am looking for in  a meatloaf.

I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I thought it had a good flavor, but the oatmeal was a bit much.  My husband thought it overpowered the meatloaf and you didn't really get the flavor you expect when you have meatloaf.  I did think it was moist and had no problem with it falling apart.  The addition of the oatmeal did make it very filling, but it did give it a different type flavor.

I was excited to try this, because no one in our household likes meatloat. Since it had so many good reviews, I had hoped it would be different...it wasn't! We still don't like meatloat.

My husband wants me to ONLY use this recipe for any meatloaf I use in the future. I halved this recipe and didn't put the cheese on top, but used all of the cheese inside.  I used 1 lb. lean ground beef (must use lean, or it'll fall apart!), and 1 lb. ground turkey breast.  I also topped it with some bottled BBQ sauce.

Excellent but reduced by half and added sauce (double) from mom's meatloaf, this site.  Also would try a little less liquid and add another egg to help hold together.  Great flavor.

Firm, presentable, contained a vaiety of spices and flavors, and then was almost tasteless!! It is one of the most bland meatloaf preps I have ever attempted.  I added catsup at serving, in order to give it some pep.  I HAD followed the recipe!!

I've tried a lot of Meat Loaf Recipes and this one is a keeper.  For Ketchup you can substitute T-sauce and add agave nectar to it which will mimic the ketchup or use a natural ketchup.

Great recipe!  I cut this in half since it did call for 4lbs of beef....thats alota beef!  2lbs was perfect for my family of 5 (3 kids).  As others suggested, I did cut back the amount of cheese and oats and added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  Also added a  glaze of ketchup, vinegar, mustart and brown sugar! And topped it all off with 4 slices of bacon.  Yummy!

Made this with 2 lbs ground buffalo, omitted the broth, split whole wheat panko crumbs and oatmeal. Baked 1-1/2 hrs at 350 with a large baked sweet potato to which I added a tsp of Smucker's All Fruit apricot preserves and crisp steamed broccolli florets. Husband loved it.  Less calories in buffalo, which we eat all the time. Great leftovers.

AWESOME!!!  This meatloaf was amazing.  It was better than my mom's and hers is great.  It appears that Rebekkah at the bottom doesn't know how to cook because mine was gone within the hour and was asked to make it again next week.  Again, AWESOME!!

I agree with earlier reviewer. We cut receipe in half and followed carefully. Meatloaf came out soggy and bland. I would not make this again.  It was a waste of time and money. There are many much better receipes for meatloaf.

Fantastic!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it did crumble a bit while serving.  But after dinner, and while I was storing the leftovers, and it had a chance to cool a bit, it didn't crumble at all!  The only change I made was added 1/2 cup of crumbled bacon bits, just in case it didn't have enough calories!  lol!  Make sure to drain the fat out of the loaf pan before serving.      I usually love meatloaf topped with ketchup, but I resisted topping the loaf with it and the flavor held its own without it!  Although I couldn't resist completely and put a dab of ketchup on the side of my plate to dip in. I didn't use it however!     Have to admit I was VERY nervous about adding the entire amount of oats, but after mixing them ALL with the hot liquid and after baking, you barely could tell they were there!  But I do think they added a lot of flavor and texture!  I wrapped and froze the second loaf for a future meal!  Great recipe!  It will be my new go-to meatloaf recipe!

Nice flavor, but this so fell apart while trying to get it out of the loaf pan. Smelled wonderfully delicious, but just meatloaf with too many onions. No rave reviews here. Not bad, just not outstanding like some of the others here are.

Loved this recipe- it does make 2 full loaf pans so depending the group your feeding you may want to half the recipe.  I use lean ground turkey for mine.

I just made this for the first time and it is THE BEST meatloaf I've ever had; hands down!   I can't leave it alone.    I used quick oats instead of old fashioned and instead of cheese on top, used a glaze of 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce, but those were the only changes.   This is truly divine.

I split this receipe and used deer meat and lean ground beef. I also added 3 slices of crumbled bread too because it seemed a little mushy with just the oats. My husband enjoyed it.

I agree with Pam-3BoysMama. I too wondered if the use of oatmeal caused it to fall apart. Maybe I'll try bread crumbs in lieu of the oats. I did like the flavor though but I prefer meat loaf over meat mush...

I did not care for this recipe, nor did my family.  I thought there was too much oatmeal and really didn't have a taste that was memorable.  Actually, quite blah.  Maybe it was the cheese that turned me off.  Oh well, I'm stuck with another loaf.  I won't toss it but definately won't make this again.  To each his own I guess.

Disappointed that it wasn't better than it sounded. It's good enough to try again, but I'll be making some adjustments...possibly adding tomatoes.

This was fabulous!!! My husband has been a critic of my meatloaf ever since we have been together. (25 years). I never seem to make it the same twice. I calculated 6 servings and adjusted it to fit the recipe exactly, except I did not put the cheese on top, but the required amount inside. I feel the falling apart or greasiness others describe would be with the ground beef, cheese or eggs that they use. I used LEAN beef, good cheddar cheese, and farm fresh brown eggs (1- JUMBO) It was perfect! and we got the full benifit of the fiber in the oatmeal!! LOVE it....

A good, easy recipe.  I used smoked  gouda cheese, which gave it a good, smoky taste.

I just don't get it.  I've tried meatloaf after meatloaf and nothing impresses.  This was okay.  My kids ate it only after we drowned it in ketchup.  I won't be making it again.

Little too moist, Kind of fell apart.  Would scale back the broth to prevent that and needed some more seasonings.....kind of bland.  Didn't really notice the cheese either.  Cut the recipe in half and it still made 2 small loaves.  Liked the idea of using oatmeal so would try again.

Overall good taste . Needed more vegetable for our taste.  Changes: used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, added carrots and ground flax seed to try to boost nutrients.

I scaled this down for three instead of twelve. I did like the addition of the celery but the basil and the texture didn't do it for me.
