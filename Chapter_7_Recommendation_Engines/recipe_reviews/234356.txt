11.4.18  Caramelized the onions for an extra 10 minutes, and they were beautifully golden and sweet.  Had my doubts about the addition of the apple cider, and doubtful that I’ll add it again.  Guess we’re just too traditional, but we didn’t care for the sweetness that the cider added to the overall flavor of the soup.  The caramelized onions added enough sweetness for us, but that could be personal taste, so I wouldn’t want to discourage anybody from trying the recipe exactly as written.  Using the food processor to slice the onions made this an extremely easy recipe to make, and with its few ingredients and relatively short cooking time compared to many other onion soups, this is really good.  No wine in the soup?  Nope, I didn’t miss it, and I’m a wine lover.  This is a solid recipe, and I’ll making it again using all stock, probably try beef broth next time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it, I’ll add a photo the next time I make it. ***UPDATE 11.9.18***  Made this again today using beef stock instead of chicken, and apple juice (1/2 cup adding just a little sweetness) instead of cider.  My husband liked the beef stock better, but I thought the chicken worked equally well.  That’s a win-win because either will work. Also, instead of just parmesan, today I topped it with a traditional crostini with mozzarella, more like the traditional french onion soup, and then under the  broiler.
