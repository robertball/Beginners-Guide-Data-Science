It was delicious! I didn't cook the noodles, but followed the rest of the recipe as it was written. Since my noodles were uncooked, I made sure they were covered with the meat sauce. I baked it for 25 minutes (instead of 20) with the foil. Then I uncovered it and baked it for 15 minutes (instead of covering it and baking for 10). It turned out perfect and not having to cook the noodles beforehand was a time saver! I'll make it again, most definitely!!

This was good for using a jarred sauce. I gave this tray to my daughter and her family and they really enjoyed it. I pre-boiled my lasagna, added garlic and some Italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese. Delicious!

This was so very good. The balance of ingredients were just perfect for me. The Ricotta gave a nice creamy texture and the Barilla Marinara sauce was not over powering just right, the onion flavor came through nicely was a perfect blend! I did boil the Barilla Lasagne noodles with salt and EVOO for only four minutes this made it easy to handle and had no cracked or broken pieces at all. Love it will definitely be a go to recipe and was easy to prepare!

This lasagne was very tasty and oh so easy but I am not sure what I did wrong as it was very soupy. It seems like two jars of sauce may be a bit of overkill - next time I may try it with just one jar.

This was easy and delicious. Makes enough for a large family or to invite guests over. Reheats well. Also, this can be made ahead. I made it the day before, planning to have it for supper and had something come up, so I ended up refrigerating it and making it the next day. You could also freeze it. Just remember to thaw it overnight before cooking. The baking time will need to be increased if you cook it chilled. Will definitely make again!

Happiness is having this for dinner! I really enjoyed this dish and I made it vegetarian by using vegetarian sausage (yes, it does exist).

Used Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, and grated mozzarella cheese, as that is what we have here. This is a very easy recipe, and the results are fabulous!

This recipe was very good! I followed the recipe exactly other than adding 1/4 tsp minced garlic to the sauce, and it turned out great. Thanks, Barilla!

This is a good, basic lasagna recipe. The only thing I did differently was not pre-boiling the noodles. I just layered them in uncooked and made sure there was plenty of sauce and cheese covering them. I allowed a few extra minutes of bake time to ensure they were tender and done.
The Barilla wavy lasagna is easy to use and it tasted great. We enjoyed this.

My family really liked this lasagna.  You will undoubtedly have some torn noodles.  Use the pieces in the middle layers and set aside whole noodles for the top layer.  I did pre-cook my noodles, so I did not cover it with foil and it baked with just a little crunch on the sides, just the way we like it.
