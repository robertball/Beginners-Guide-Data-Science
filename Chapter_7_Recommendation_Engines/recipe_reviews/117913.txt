The best!  The things I did different is I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, I soaked my raisins in hot water for 10 min first, and I added less oil and added applesauce instead.  The recipe made 12 large muffins!  Exactly 25 min in the oven.  They came out and looked like they were store bought. This is a keeper!

Great recipe. Though I changed a few things. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of white. I also replaced half of the oil with applesauce. They turned out wonderful.

These were soooo good. The only changes I made were to omit the raisins, and add a splash of orange juice. Outstanding. Thanks so much, Nancy!

Happy Holidays to everybody! Just made this for tonight. These are so good! Will be a regular in our house. We ate one right out of the oven and my daughter didn't wanna stop. Since my mangos were a little overripe, I had to puree them, so there was a lot of juice in it. To compensate, I only used 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of the oil, added 1/3 cup coconut milk, and mixed in approx. 1 cup of coconut flakes. I always have problems with sticking paper-cups, when making muffins with fruit in it, so I just grease the muffin pan and cover with coconut flakes. Muffins just fall out the pan, don't stick nor pull apart.

Thanks for this recipe. I have been searching for a mango muffin recipe for a long time. Living in Fiji I have plenty of mangoes and often wonder what to do with them. I used only 1/4 cup sugar and whole wheat flour and they are delicious!

Absolutely loved these!  I made some adjustments to make them a little healthier.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour.  I replaced the sugar with Sucanat and reduced to 3/4 cup. I replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce. I also omitted the raisins because I'm not a fan.  These were moist and delicious!!

I actually forgot the sugar and they still turned out great because the mangos, bananas and dried fruit are sweet.  I brought these to church and they were gone in minutes.

These muffins were great!  I used all whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp soda and 1 tsp baking powder as I don't like the taste of baking soda.  Turned out great.  I didn't have any walnuts on hand so I substituted 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1 tsp almond extract.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

Very useful recipe, thanks! I used dried apricots instead of raisins and omitted the nuts, I also substituted 1/4 of the flour for rolled oats. The muffins turned out just right and I gave the leftovers to my friend that came for dinner to stuff her fiance with, otherwise I would have eaten them all myself...

This recipe NEEDS 1 tsp baking powder added to it. The muffins have a great taste.  I substituted 1/2 white flour 1/2 wheat and 3/4 c applesauce instead of oil.  I loved the idea of putting mango in muffins and will definitely make them again!

It was very good for the people that enjoy mango flavor, it is a strong flavour by itself but the combination with ripe bananas was excellent because the get along very well and lowered the mango flavor.   I don´t know if I packed them very promptly in a container and they have to cool for a while but some of them got sticky with the paper cups and could´t get them out completely.

Wow I made these muffins last night.  They are so good.  I blended two mangos and one banana in the blender.  I used half the amount of sugar.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of white flour.  My entire family loved these muffins.  I will definately make them again.  They were also pretty healthy with all the changes.  Try these muffins you will love them

I had some mangoes to use up and found this recipe. I am not a big mango fan and didn't much like the smell of them when I was dicing them up. So I did not have high hopes for these. But, they turned out great! They taste sort of like cinnamony banana bread with peaches. I made the recipe as indicated, except I did sub half wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and used a little more banana and a little less oil than called for.

I love having something to do with a ripe mango!
I cut the recipe in half, using currants instead of raisins and lemon instead of lime juice ('cause that's what I had around). I also used 1/4 c whole wheat flour, adding it to the 3/4 c white flour. I have four delicious 'large' muffins now to enjoy!

Definately popular with everyone but I was hoping for more of a mango taste, but perhaps that is just how cooked mango turns out?  I ran out of baking liners but they cooked perfectly without in a non-stick muffin pan.

This recipe had been in my saved file for over a month, and I am glad I tried it this evening!  It was very easy to put together.  I made a few changes - only 1/2 c oil, 2 eggs, and 1/2 wheat 1/2 white flour.  I also used dried blueberries instead of raisins.  The muffins definitely stick to the muffin papers because of the mango chunks, but not a big deal.  As I live in Costa Rica with 3 mango trees in my yard,  I will definitely be making these muffins again!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Yummy BUT -- be sure to spray your paper liners first! Sticky sticky sticky. You'll be scraping each muffin off the paper. Better yet skip the liners all together and just spray the muffin pan directly.

I puréed the mango and banana because my 4 yearold will not touch fruit- I found there wasn't a strong taste of mango in these maybe because of that reason- I omitted the raisins and walnuts- a little too much oil for my liking but my child gobbled these up-

I made these today and they are divine. I did add about 3 Tbsp. wheat germ and 2 Tbsp. of crushed flaxseed to the flour mixture and cut back on the sugar slightly.  I sprayed my muffin tin with PAM and the muffins released beautifully.  I will definitely be making these again!!!  Florentine.

This was just not my favorite muffin recipe.  I dd not taste much of the mango but it was extremely moist.  I did use other people's advice and used half baking soda, half baking powder and they didn't rise.  I would not do that again but that was my fault for changing the recipe.  I also used half ww flour since my family can't ever tell the difference and it did end up having a great texture.  So pluses-great texture and very moist; negatives-pretty bland.

Awesome!  Delicious - just made them tonight - used spelt flour, halved the amount of sugar, and it was still plenty sweet - halved the fat too - replaced other half with applesauce.. still moist sweet and delicious!  The mango chunks are just GREAT in this muffin. Thanks for the recipe! :)

These were amazing! I omitted the banana, raisins and walnuts, and added diced nectarine instead. Absolutely wonderful, these are now a family favourite!

This recipe was "okay". I used the suggestions from some of the other cooks trying this same recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup.
Thank you for the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!! Next to fresh-picked local blueberries, I love mangos, and these muffins were amazing! I made no changes to the recipe, but I contemplated using dried blueberries instead of raisins. Maybe next batch. I also made a dozen regular size muffins and two dozen minis for those co-workers who fuss about the calories but devour 'em anyway. :-) Thanks for a winner!!!!!

Delicious! I used applesauce instead of the oil, and put in some baking powder instead of about 1/3 of the baking soda it calls for. I skipped the raisins and sprinkled a mixture of coconut and brown sugar over the tops before baking. (Next time I'll include finely chopped nuts in the mixture.) I would have liked the mango and cinnamon tastes to be a bit stronger, so next time I'll probably double the cinnamon and use some additional pureed mango in place of some of the applesauce. Yum!

These turned out awesome!! I had been looking for creative ways to use mango since we have a neighbor with a huge tree and this was perfect. 

The only different thing I did was add a streusel topping:
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
Chop in the butter until it looks like crumbs and sprinkle on top of muffins before baking

My co-workers raved about these!  I used 1/2 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup oil.  I used 1 tsp baking soda and only 1 tsp baking powder. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I omitted the raisins and used almonds instead of walnuts.  I had frozen diced mango so I thawed it and used that instead of fresh.  Next time I will add shredded coconut to give it a more tropical taste.

These muffins are GREAT tasting. Made them this afternoon, as I had a couple ofbmango's going bad to do something with. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour, Used 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda,  I used dried cranberries for the raisins.  Added some coconut and pineapple. They are really moist but there is no mango taste at all. Next time I will use  more Mango's and no banana.

Made this today, but the mango I had didn't yield quite 2 cups. I diced up some pineapple rings I had left over to make up for that 1/2 cup I was missing. I didn't use the nuts and substituted dried cranberries for raisins. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. They turned out perfect. Very moist and tasty. Each bite has something different to offer.

I would like to give another five star review to these muffins. Fabulous! I had a banana and 2 mangoes that needed to be used today or else meet their fate in the refuse. I always tweak recipes to avoid running to the grocery for a missing ingredient. This recipe is so flexible. I added some pineapple to make up what I was lacking in mango. Applesauce replaced 1/2 cup of the oil. I also used all whole wheat flour. Adding some oats for topping set off the appearance. Fabulously moist and delicious muffins chock full of fruit. Enjoy!

I followed this recipe but opted out of the raisins and walnuts. I used 3 ripe mangos from the tree and one apple banana (type of bananas we have here in Hawaii). I kept them chunky and not pureed. I also didn't have muffin tin or bread tin so I used a 9x13 pan. Turned out awesome!

OMG! I made these two days in a row because I had four huge ripe mangoes.  The first time, I followed the original recipe and they were fruity and delicious.  This afternoon, I made more because I had leftover mango -- but because it was overripe, I processed it along with two ripe bananas which gave me about 2 full cups of puree.  I used only wholewheat flour and a bit less sugar and oil after I had read reviews suggesting that.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of baking powder which someone suggested. I did use raisins and crushed toasted pecans. I used flaked coconut the first time but not the second.  I found the batter still a bit wet so I threw in about a cup of oats.  Well, after about 21 minutes, I had THE MOST WONDERFUL FLUFFY YUMMY muffins! Better than the original version, and easier to handle, though both versions are so tasty! I am sitting here, looking at them and loving them. I just had a sample and it is going to take a lot of self-control not to have a second one.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made mini loaves of bread instead of muffins. I also used applesauce instead of oil,half of the sugar, did not add raisins or nuts. It was a moist bread but I will leave the cinnamon out and add vanilla extract next time. We ate it with cream cheese on it and it was very good. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing.....all of the wonderful ingredients and after baking I realized that I had forgotten the sugar.  They are delicious even without the sugar.  I bake muffins every week for a non profit group training for the L A Marathon and this is a perfect healthy treat after their run!

These were ggreat and I even screwed up the recipe. I accidently used baking powder instead of the baking soda. Turned out kinda flat, but the taste was fantastic. I can only imagin what they would have been like if they had stay fluffy.

I did take the suggestion of previous bakers and added 1 t. baking soda and 1 t. baking powder and cut back the oil and added applesauce. Also I used half all-purpose flour and half unbleached all-purpose flour. While warm from the oven these are some of the best muffins I have ever eaten; at room temperature they are still great but not quite as wonderful. Nancy thanks for posting this great recipe!

Wonderful.   I also made some adjustments - cut the sugar in half, used part applesauce and part butter for the oil, used whole wheat four and added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 cup plain yogurt.  Turned out wonderful.

These were pretty good, but I made them with apple sauce instead of oil, so take my review with a grain of salt.  They came out very "healthy" tasting.  Plus, I also had the same problem another reviewer had that the muffins wouldn't come out of the paper muffin liners easily.
