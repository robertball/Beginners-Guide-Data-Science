We boiled a chicken for about 2 hours then built up the broth with the discarded peels from the onion with a few carrots and celery sticks pepper corns bay leaves and the discards from cleaning all the meat off the chicken. Boil while you do all the potatoes few hours or so. The rest is about the same.

I grew up on this dish and I do have some modifications that I use.  I use chicken legs and boil them with onions. Let the chicken cool and remove from the bones.  I also use very thin boneless chops which adds some great flavor. I bake the chops with some olive oil, salt and pepper. I also find that using a juicer changes the entire consistency of the potatoes. I still do it the old fashioned way with a grater by hand. My one bit of advise is salt and pepper everything!
