We have this on Christmas Eve too, an old family favorite going back to my Grandmother's Aunt.    Our recipie is basically the same but doubled - except fot the cream (Grandma mentioned she often halved the reciped though, so would be very similar!)  Instead of sherry, we used 1/2 cup boiling water to dissolve the gelatin, and instead of vanilla we use almond extract.  We also add 1/2 cup slivered almonds and 1 whole almond (the one who gets it gets the prize - usally a small box of chocolates or a christmas ornament). Instead of raspberries we use a strawberry sauce.  One package of frozen sweetened berries, thawed, cooked with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and 1/2 c water until thickened.  I always tried to get the prize as a kid, eating 2 or 3 bowls until I was ready to burst.  I still get teased by family every Christmas Eve when the pudding comes out after supper.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband is Danish, we have this every Christmas and eat it leading up to Christmas with just slight alterations. We make a large pot of rice plain without almonds, vanilla and cream the day before and eat it for supper with a little butter and sugar cinnamon sprinkled on, the next day we add the cream and almonds and true Danish style top with Cherry sauce. Nom Nom Nom. Niels makes it for my family in Scotland and they LOVE it! Mustn't forget a marzipan pig for the prize when the whole almond has been found!

I did not change a thing. It was delicious. Just like when my mother made it when I was an infant.

First, I one the almond for my first time in 37 years!
Second, we have Rice Almond every Christmas Eve as we celebrate our Danish heritage. I used White Cranberry juice  instead of Sherry, and slivered almonds instead of chopped. This recipe turned out very good, our family of forty enjoyed it! We will be using this recipe next year, and many years to come.

Easy to make.  Definitely top it with berries, otherwise, it was like eating those plain-o store bought rice pudding.  I didn't enjoy it but my daughter thought it was good.

Be careful not to use too much gelatin.  The berries taste great with this, so don't leave out!
