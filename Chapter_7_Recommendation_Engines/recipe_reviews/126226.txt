This was a great dish that even my picky little girl liked. A bit salty, I'll sub 1/4 cup chicken broth for some of the soy sauce next time. Also, the 1/2 cup of water called for failed to cook the rice, I added probably another cup to cook it through. Thanks for the delicious, quick recipe!

I haven't made this yet. I was wondering if you knew how to make this in a clay pot. I have one and would like to use it more. Thanks!

Very good followed the recipe to the letter, except for the clay pot, like  my favorite hole in the wall in China Town of San Francisco where I was the only anglo and there by special invite. Thank you Miss Yung!
