I'm choosing not to post stars as to throw off the rating, but frankly, I was disappointed.  Not in the sauce, which tasted wonderful, but in the fact the beans never finished cooking!   I think the bottom line is to follow the advice of a previous reviewer & soak + boil before slow cooking.  The allrecipes site has an advice section, which addresses the issue, I've pasted it below.  

Time your Seasoning
For the most part, you can go ahead and add spices, seasonings and aromatics  to your pot o' beans when you start cooking them, but there are a few things that you should never add until the end: salt, and anything acidic, like tomato products, lemon juice, wine and vinegar. Salt will toughen the skins of the beans, and acids can keep beans from ever getting soft. Once your beans are tender, you may add these ingredients to your heart's content.

I'm coming back to let you know I've tried this recipe again, but soaked the dry beans overnight, simmering in the morning till soft.   Worked beautifully!   I will use this recipe's ratios in the future, but those beans are being cooked first!

NO SOAKING, NO BOILING.  I just rinsed the beans and cooked them on High in the Crock-Pot with 8 cups of water for 6 hours.  Then I added all the other ingredients and they were hassle-free and perfect!  I did not add the 1 1/2 cups of Water; used only 1/2 cup Brown Sugar; no mustard; no bacon (didn't have).  These were the best baked beans I have ever tasted, will make them often!

Re: Beans that are still hard after 18 hours

This has happened to me in the past.  I couldn't figure out why, until I heard a radio cooking show explain it.  The ACID in the tomatoes prevents the beans from cooking thoroughly.  The radio cook suggested not adding acid ingredients until after the beans are cooked.  I always follow that advice now.

Followed advice from previous reviews.  Soaked beans overnight almost 12 hours.  Then brought beans to a boil and then simmered on low for one hour before putting in crock pot.  Followed reciped exactly, sauce was excellent.  Cooked 4 hours on high and then 2 hours on low.  Beans were perfect.  OH!  to avoid sauce being to watery I put paper towels over the crock pot before putting the lid on to absorb condensation that gathers.  I do that on alot of my slow cooker meals to avoid watery sauces, etc.  Will definetly make again!!!

This is a very good recipe.  I soaked the beans overnight-10 hours and boiled them for 30 min to an an hour so they were soft enough.DO NOT SKIP THE BOILING  or you will be cooking them forever and wondering why they don't get soft. Older beans take longer so if they are fresh 30 min may be enough.  Also do not add salt until cooked it also prevents the beans from getting soft. They were not dry and the ratio of tomato to molasses was perfect.  I gave 4 stars instead of  five because  they are a lttle too sweet because of the ketchup. So next time I pureed a can of tomatoes instead, so a cup of pureed tomatoes and half a cup of ketchup and used half the brown sugar recommended.  They were still sweet but much less so.  If I have it I add a smoked ham hock.  Gives it a delicious smokey taste and the meat just falls off the bone.  My husband doesn't like beans but likes it cooked with a ham hock.   In addition you can cook them for about 5 hours on high if you are in a hurry.

My Mom found these too sweet so instead of 1.5 c ketchup I used 3/4 c tomato puree and 3/4 c ketchup.  Not so sweet.  I agree with the previous review they are perfect otherwise

This was the first time I made baked beans, but this recipe is the best! No need to try any other recipes.  Nice sweet molasses flavour!
I soaked the beans overnight and cooked the recipe in my slow cooker for 9 1/2 hrs (It wasn't quite ready at 8 hrs).

After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe a bit and they turned out just fine. I actually did the "quick soak" method on my beans...boiled them for a few minutes, and then left them sitting in the covered pot for an hour before draining them and putting them in the crock pot with the bacon, onion and seasonings.  I coked them on "high" for 4 hours, until they were moderately tender, then added the ketchup and cooked on low for another six hours.  I also cut the brown sugar in half, since others mentioned it was too sweet.  Next time I wouldn't though...because I kind of like mine a little sweet.  Overall, good recipe, but it did seem like something was missing..and I just couldn't place it.

I made sure the beans were basically cooked before I added any other ingredients.  I rinsed then quick-soaked them (add beans to hot water and boil for 2 minutes, then leave in hot water with cover on for 1 hour).  After the quick soak, I put them in my pressure cooker for 3 minutes on high pressure with natural pressure release.  I added a few tablespoons of oil to the water in the pressure cooker to keep the skins from getting tough (a tip from my pressure cooker cookbook).  They were very tender before I added the other ingredients.  Cooked on low for 7 hours.  Yum!

As with all bean recipe's i soak mine over night and I never have a problem. This  recipe is a good one,I change it abit though (as i do every recipe,not just this one,bad habit of mine)  Anyhow,I added another 1/4 cup molasses ,a 1/4 cup maple syrup , 1/2 cup more brown sugar , and 2 tsp of liquid smoke ,and I also put an entire package of bacon in. it turned out incredible , they were gone in 1 day and I have people asking me to make them again so they can have more,even been offered money for them lol.

I noticed the salt went in right along with the other ingredients.  This causes the beans to be tough.  I never add salt to beans until they are cooked.  It makes a big difference.  My mother-in-law taught me this many, many years ago when I was first married and asked why my beans didn't turn out as good as hers.

Wow-these baked beans are incredible, this is one I'll be using many times in the future when grilling out or even on a wintry Sunday.  Incredibly easy and uses only a few ingredients which I always have on hand.  I did exactly as others suggested with fantastic results; namely both soaking the beans overnight and then simmering at a slow boil for an hour in the morning before throwing in the crockpot.  If you do this then just add the other ingredients and let it go for 8 hours on low, be sure to stir every now and then-don't wait to add the ketchup/salt as the sauce literally comes together like fine wine over the duration of time.  While it might seem a bit sweet initially, after slow cooking for 8 hours it all comes together and is simply perfection-I'm a person who likes spicy sauces and I'd not add a thing to this, nor change the composition.  Kudos for this one, it's truly simplicity and perfection in one-I'll not be buying anymore canned beans!  (this is FAR less expensive than canned beans, a single package of beans fixes a whole pot).

Soaked overnight and boil until you can almost mash with a fork. I Used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. The real trick i found with crock pot baked beans, Place a piece of tinfoil just ontop of the surface of the beans while cooking. Acts like a oven, keeps the heat right on the beans, will even brown the top of the beans a bit. Keeps condensation that rises to the top of the cover out of the beans. Terrific tip that was shared with me.

Love these beans!  Definitely need to boil the beans first, or they'll never soften.  Boil for about an hour with just water (no salt!).  Advice I got from my mom: when you can smash a bean between your fingers, then you know it's ready.

This would have been 5 stars if I could have gotten the beans to cool. I see so many people having this issue and citing the tomatoes and/or salt as the culprit(s) that stop the beans from softening that I wonder why the directions don't call for cooking the beans first or adding the ketchup/salt last. 

I soaked my beans for 12 hours and they cooked for a whopping 24 hours in the crock pot, 4 of which were on high heat. The beans did not soften properly. The sauce tasted awesome, however, and my house smelled like heaven all the time they were cooking, so I suppose that was the silver lining! I will definitely make this recipe again, but the beans will get boiled in advance.

Followed previous reviewers' advice and added salt at the end.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  Also put a piece of paper towel on the inside of the lid, which made beans thick and not soupy.  Ended up needing to add a 1/2 cup of water at the end, as they got too thick!  Beans tasted good if not slightly flat at the end of cooking.  Added a Tbsp. Dijon mustard at the end with my salt, as well as a splash of cider vinegar.  Would make again.

I really liked this recipe.  I was looking for a real homemade beans recipe (I see so many recipes that call for you to open a few cans and add this and that - that is NOT homemade!) so that I would know exactly what is going in to it.  I did soak and boil the beans as others suggested and they were perfect - not too hard not too mushy!  I left out the bacon (will try it with next time) and added lots of pepper, 1/2 tbsp of worcestershire and a 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  Next time I will use less brown sugar, but other than that, this recipe is great!

I soaked my beans overnight and then boiled them 1 hr before placing in the crock pot and after about 6 hours the beans were definitely done. I liked these ok but I don't think I'll make them again my fanily doesn't seem to be a fan of baked beans. Thanks for the recipe

I would like to rate this a 4.5. I followed the recipe , except I also boiled the beans for 30mins after soaking overnight and before placing in the slow cooker, and I added 1TBSP of liquid smoke, and omitted salt, and (wow I guess the minor changes sound like alot but they arent) I used 2/3lb of bacon instead of 6 slices, next time will just use the whole pkg, yummeh! I cooked them on HIGH for 10 hours and the beans still were a bit tough. So, next time I will boil the beans for 1hr or 1.5hrs before placing in the crockpot. With that being said the "sauce" is to die for. Exactly why I love beans exactly x10. I will never and I mean NEVER buy another can of baked beans again!!!! And for the price difference alone. The canned beans were always good but now I can't look at them the same!!! This recipe is a keeper with the minor alterations.

I have never done a review, but felt the need since there was some conflicting reviews about cooking the beans. 

I soaked the beans overnight and then boiled them until tender enough that they were done cooking, about 30-45 minutes. 

Then I threw the beans in the crock pot with all the other ingredients, including the tomato ketchup which is an acid and can prevent beans from cooking. This allowed the sauce to thicken and flavor, without the worry about if the beans would be done or not. I knew they were already done before I started the crockpot. 

This a great recipe. My whole family loved it and it makes great leftovers. Thanks for sharing it!

Flavor was pretty good, a little on the sweet side. Will certainly make again, but with a bit less molasses/sugar.

I made these for a group of high schoolers, all  guys, and not one of them would eat them. Even these teens found them sickening sweet. I took a bite after the kids refused to eat the beans and I felt as if I was going into an instant sugar coma. If you try this recipe, cut way back on the brown sugar and perhaps the molasses could be cut to 2 tablespoons. Ended up throwing the entire pot out, hubbie wouldn't even taste them.

My first time making home made beans and they were delicious - I've shared the recipe with others already.  I soaked over night and boiled as per the instructions of other reviewers.

I have made these and many baked beans on the stove and in a crockpot.  Please, please don't add salt until the very end of the cooking cycle.  When they were still hard, I cooked one batch of beans literally for 5 days trying to see if they would ever get soft, and that's when I read any salt toughens them.

Delicious!  The first time I made them I only soaked the beans and it came outh fine, the second time it took over 12 hours for the beans to soften.  Since dried beans apparently aren't consistent, I now soak and cook the beans first.  

I use smoked salt, or a little liquid smoke in the beans.  I've also started adding a generous splash of whiskey about 1/2 hour before serving - yum!!!

My friends now request "my" famous baked beans for all our cookouts - thanks for sharing, TLEFURGEY!

The beans didn't cook through even though I had them soaking on warm for 8 hours before adding the other ingredients (but I meant to put it on high). By the time the beans were cooked some of the sauce was burnt, and now it all tastes burnt. Not sure if we'll be able to eat it...This sauce is good but the recipe needs to indicated how to cook the beans completely before adding other ingredients.

These beans taste wonderful! I cut the brown sugar in slightly more than half as previous reviewers suggested, and added half a beer. For the last few hours also added some extra tomato sauce to thicken it a bit more.

Hard to rate this. I did an overnight soak with the beans, then crock-potted them for over 9 hours, and almost ALL of them were STILL not done. However, the flavor was pretty good. I used about 3/4 cup of the brown sugar and no bacon, though, and that came out pretty good. However, I still thought it was just a little bit sweet (I do not care for sweet bakes beans), and the molasses gave it too thick of a texture, so I'd probably use like, 1-2 tablespoons of it next time I make these (which I'd like too, once I cook the beans for a week!)

Superb recipe, but like other reviewers have mentioned, my beans (fresh, presoaked overnight) turned out crunchy the first time I made it.  The second time, I presoaked overnight and boiled the beans first, also added the salt and ketchup towards the end of the cooking time, and they turned out perfect!  This worked out great for freezer cooking as well, I made a double batch, cooled, stored half in one large ziplock and the rest in smaller portions. When it was time for the family get-together, all I had to do was thaw, pour into serving dish, and reheat. Next time, I am going to try a little less sugar (personal preference), but this is by far the best baked beans I have ever had. Thanks for sharing this!

Very good beans!  My husband loved them and said they're almost as good as the beans at our favorite BBQ joint.  I cooked my beans with just water and the onions until tender, then drained off most of the water with a ladle and added the other ingredients sans water and I cut back the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  No bacon b/c we wanted vegetarian beans.  The beans tasted good but the addition of 2 t Frank's Red Hot Sauce and 1/2 t chili powder really made them great.  They don't taste spicy or like chili beans at all, the extra ingredients just punch up the flavor.  I only let the beans cook about half an hour before serving.  Next time I will use 1/2 C brown sugar as they were just a TAD sweeter than I prefer.  I'm rating the recipe 4 stars without the hot sauce and chili powder but 5 stars with.

My husband loved this so much he raved about it on his Facebook status update!  :)  I soaked the beans and boiled them, so they were pretty soft before I combined all of the ingredients in the crockpot, thus cutting down my time to 5 1/2 hours.  I also went a little shy on the sugar, because I don't like very sweet baked beans.  They are AMAZING!  Tangy, sweet, thick . . . scrumptious.  We are stealing bites out of the pot, even though they are for dinner tomorrow!  Will make them again and again.

Be sure to cook these beans before putting in the slow cooker.  Cut brown sugar to 1/4 C if at all.

I love this recipe.  I have never made homemade beans before and I loved these.  Tasted exactly like the brown beans I love!!  I added a bit of special spice I had at home and used maple bacon but apart from that I followed the recipe and they were perfect.  A great beginner recipe!!

I made these and brought to football Sunday.  Everyone raved about them, they were a huge hit!  Perfect amount of tang and sweetness.  I soaked overnight and threw them in the crockpot on high for about 5 hours (i truly don't see a need to soak them overnight AND boil them).  I did wait until they were pretty much cooked before I put in the acidic ingredients, (ketchup, mustard, sugar, molasses) and then finished on low for 2 hours.

So much better than canned! Used only 4 slices of bacon has that's all I had, and it was plenty. Also used half the salt, which I added towards the end with the ketchup because salt and tomatoes can keep beans from softening. Also increased water to 2 cups to make sure beans were covered in crockpot. Before placing in crock, I used this method to reduce gas: place beans in 6 cups cold water and nothing else, bring to a boil and boil ten minutes. Remove pot to sink, do NOT drain, add 1/4 baking soda and stir like crazy until all foam is gone. Rinse beans well, then place in crock and continue as directed. Left on low overnight.

Great, a hit with non-bean lovers!  I followed it exactly, but next time may reduce sugar and ketchup just to make it healthier.

I have been looking for a bean recipe for some time and came upon this one.  After checking the star rating and reading some of the reviews, I decided it was a good recipe to try.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.   After 13 hours the beans still have not cooked through and the sugar level is through the roof and therefore not fit to consume.  I have tried many recipes from this site and this is the first time that I was unhappy with the results.

Very good!  Soaked overnight, boiled in the morning for an hour and  cooked in slow cooker on high for 8 hours.  They still could have cooked a little longer.  Added Apple juice to the liquid about 2/3 through cooking.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I did follow other people's advice and cut down on the sugar, and I'm glad I did, it was plenty sweet. But I still LOVED this recipe, and its so easy and nice to have dinner ready when I come home!

I don't really care for baked beans, but I'm bringing them to a work picnic and this was the recipe I decided on.  Based on time, I soaked them for about an hour, then boiled them for about an hour (without any salt or acid!) and then put them in the crock pot. They turned out fantastic and even I ate them.  My husband keeps asking me to make them again.

I've done versions of this recipe a few times now and every time my beans turn out awesome!    I've done it without the bacon most times and I use less ketchup and a can of diced tomatoes instead to make it a bit less sweet and still get the tomato goodness.  I also add real maple syrup to the mix.  Fabulous recipe!  Thanks!

This got me started in perfecting my own recipe. Definitely prefer the 1-hour boil method rather than overnight soak (they weren't soft enough that way). I leave out the bacon, and an hour before serving, fry it up, crumble and add to the beans.

The flavor of this dish was great! However my beans never did cook completely despite cooking them for 18+ hours! I soaked them overnight but maybe that was a bad batch of beans. I will definitely try again!

Please change the instructions for this recipe do that the salty, sweet,  and acidic ingredients are added after the beans are cooked .  My beans stayed hard after many many hours on the crock pot.  Now I've learned that  salt and acid  in tomato based sauces (like ketchup) cause the beans to stay hard.   Then I read some of the reviews  and found that others had the same problem even though they gave this recipe 5 stars.  It doesn't matter how good the flavor is if the texture is terrible.  This was the top recipe that came up on my Google search,  but the instructions need fixing so that more people don't end up with crunchy  beans.

Finally - a recipe that is easy to make, but still delicious. Took about 14 hours in the slow cooker. Added yellow mustard and cayenne pepper, plus some extra ketchup, salt and pepper to taste. Delish!

So good!  As per other reviewers I soaked overnight AND boiled them for around an hour.  I only put in half the sugar and also added the salt at the end.  Yum!

The sauce on these beans is truly delicious. Yes, I would make this recipe again. However, though I try hard not to change a recipe the first time I make it, I gagged at the thought of using a whole cup of brown sugar, so I reduced it to 1/3 cup, and the sweetness level was perfect. Based on the many complaints on this site about tough beans, I also precooked the beans at a roiling boil for 50 minutes before draining them and putting them in the slow cooker. They STILL came out a bit hard after 10 hours on low. I cooked the beans another 4 hours on high, and then they were perfect. Gracious, they're just these little Navy beans--you wouldn't think they would need so much cooking time. Your cooking experience may be different, but the beans ARE good, and I like the fact that there is no precooking of the bacon. Quick to prepare and delicious to eat.

This recipe was great. I soaked them overnight & boiled them for 45 minutes and then followed the recipe pretty close. I added about 1/4 cup more molasses and cooked them on high in the crockpot for 6 hours. The beans were still kind of hard so next time I will boil them for longer and maybe cook them for longer in the crockpot. Still awesome.

only changes I made were pintos instead of navy beans and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  good flavor but still too sweet for my tastes, I'll try 1/4 cup of brown sugar next time.  otherwise happy to make again.

I doubled the recipe in a 6 qt. crock pot using 1 pkg each navy beans and lima beans (totaled 6 cups). Soaked x8 hrs then boiled x 1 hr. Placed in crock pot then doubled everything in the recipe except ketchup (used 2 cups total) and brown sugar (kept 1 cup). Added a smoked ham shank. The beans were amazing and the house smelled delish. They were not too dry and we got many compliments!! This is a great recipe to feed a crowd when making burgers and dogs on the grill.

These were fantastic for 4th of July!  However I am giving them only 4 stars because I added Worchestshire sauce and BBQ sauce because what are beans without it!  But super good recipe! Making it again for Labor Day!

Beans still very tough after 12 hours; good flavor though. I even tried finishing them the last hour on the stove to try to salvage them. As another reviewer said, beans have to be cooked to tender first, before any salt or acidic ingredients are added.  I knew better but tried the recipe as written. Next time will cook beans in plain water first, then add all flavoring ingredients.

Beans were way too hard so next time, follow the advice of other reviewers and boil them first.  I reduced ketchup by 1/3 and upped the amount of water big time.  The sauce is really good but just too sweet. I will reduce brown sugar next time, too.

I made these homemade beans for a small Mother's Day celebration with my in-laws.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone thought they were great.

I would probably make these again, but I'd change two things.  First, I didn't soak the beans overnight, so I boiled them for one hour--but a lot of the beans were still on the crunchy side.  So, I would probably boil them for an hour and a half or two hours--or just be certain I soak them overnight.

Second, I didn't like the pork/bacon to bean ratio.  I thought there was too much bacon.  Next time, I'll probably only use three slices of bacon instead of six.

But the flavor of the sauce was great, and it was very easy.  And, it travels well.

Everyone at my gathering LOVED this recipe however it took MUCH longer to cook the beans even after soaking them overnight! Make sure that you allow plenty of time - mine cooked for about 13 hours and they were good (although cooking them a little longer would not have hurt!)

Did the overnight soak in the crock pot..over 8 hours was almost too long.  Threw everything in the pot at the same time.  Terrific taste.  Will make again.

As so many reviews recommend, I soaked the beans (used 1.5c white navy, 1.5c black) for 10 hours, then boiled and simmered 1.5 hrs.  Once I moved them to the crockpot, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious!  Raves from all.

I also soaked my beans overnight and in the morning boiled for 1 hour. They came out great. oh yeah I didn't have any molasses so i used light corn syrup and they tasted great!
**update- I cheated once and used a bottle of BBQ sauceand they weren't as good as the origional recipe.

As long as you follow the advice below so that the beans are fully cooked...or do the recipe exactly, but refrigerate and eat a few days later, this a definite 5-star!

This recipe couldn't be any easier! A cinch to make for a pot luck or family get together! Had family get together and these were a hit! Made the recipe as written except I soaked the beans overnight AND boiled for an hour right before I put them in the crock pot. It took a full 10 hours of cooking, but I got perfect bean texture. This does not disappoint! Move over Bush Beans!

Terrific!!  Do make sure to cook the beans first. I add beans and 8 cups of water to a slow cooker and cook for 8 hours or until soft, then add the other ingredients (minus the extra water). I tried the stated method one time, and the beans never really softened.  Other changes: reduced sugar to 1/3 cup, omitted salt, reduced bacon.  My new standard recipe for baked beans!!

FANTASTIC!  I omitted the bacon, added a few tablespoons of real maple syrup (cut back a bit on the brown sugar), and a few drops of smoke flavoring.  I'm going to make this recipe for a party this weekend!  Loved it!  I have heard that Napa Cabbage is good in baked beans...I think this is a great recipe to give it a shot!

My first time making beans other than opening a can!! I soaked them overnight and then boiled them for about 20min, because I was worried after reading everyones advice.  I cooked them on high by accident in the crockpot...so they were done a little early. Put them in at 9:30am and we were eating some at 3pm. (be careful they don't dry out on high...add water if it looks like this is happening)  I also waited to add the ketchup and salt until the end! Very Important!  Yummy recipe.

Great recipe!  My first time making slow cooker beans and my husband loved them.  Said they were the best beans he's ever had.  I did puree a can of tomatoes instead of using ketchup and also cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Did not cook after 8 hours. Let it go for 10 hours. Still no good. Then the sauce started to get too tangy and headed toward bitter. Then I dumped it out. Now I'm looking for a new recipe. Yich. Obvious glitches which I now see after a bit of study: have to pre-soak beans. Ketchup (acid) and salt do bad things to beans that don't let them slow cook properly. Also, this was a soupy mess, much too much liquid.

My husband said these were in the top ten of all the things I cook! All our kids had seconds too. I substituted ham for the bacon since we didn't have any. They were a little soupy so next time I won't add any water when I stir in the sauce ingredients. This is something we will make often, as a side dish in the summer and a meal in the fall and winter. If you have trouble with the beans not getting tender, the problem is old beans not cooking time. I never soak any beans and we eat them in some form or another at least twice a week. Try to buy your beans from a place with a high turnover, they will be fresher and cook more quickly. Thanks for the great recipe!

Having been taught by my mom and grandmother to presoak the beans overnight and cook them plain prior to adding anything else, I did just that.  I then added everything except the bacon (wanted vegetarian beans) and water.  I added 1/2 cup of the bean cooking liquid.  Next time I will add more liquid.  Excellent taste.  Too sweet?  Maybe but not by much.

Follow the advice of previous reviewers and you'll have perfect beans! Great texture and outstanding flavor... I ate these twice a day for over a week and never got sick of them! That said, this makes an awful lot of beans.

Too sweet and too much "ketchup" flavor.  Soaked overnight and boiled the beans for an hour first....still a little bit tough after cooking time had passed.

A very good recipe, with just a couple of minor problems.  I used a bean combo (great northern, navy, small red)to give a little variety, and also for a more interesting presentation.  I didn't want to cook any bacon, so I added about 1/3 cup or so of real bacon bits, which worked great.  My biggest problem, however, was that I needed these for a 2pm dinner, so I threw my oven safe crockpot bowl into the oven at about 300 degrees to speed things up.  They ended up needing the addition of about 4 extra cups of water, but I got them done in time and they were still good.

Flavors work but you shouldn't add anything with salt to beans until they are cooked. The beans will never get to the creamy texture you want if you do. I wouldn't recommend this recipe. It's like a bad joke to cook something for hours that smells good only to find out that the texture is terrible.

The recipe says soak OR boil I chose to soak the beans then put it all together in the crock pot and cooked for at least 8 hours. The beans never cooked we even tried to put them in the oven the next day for 1.5 hour still did not cook. The recipe should be revised to read SOAK AND THEN BOIL. On a positive note the liquid was delicious.

I modified the recipe to fit my picky teenager, who does NOT like things to be too sweet. 
1) Omitted ketchup, and replaced with tomato paste and 3 tablespoons of white vinegar. 
2) No mustard powder, replaced with 3 tablespoons of honey mustard
3) Used white beans because they seem to cook more thoroughly in crock pot
4) Reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup honey. 
5) Used peppered bacon
6) Added 4 cups cured ham, chopped

I used Pinto Beans instead as that is all I had on hand. Do boil the beans for an hour even after soaking as the ketchup must hinder their cooking. I already knew that salt would so that was excluded. For the sugar... I used the molasses but only 1/4 c. of the brown sugar and it was still sweet enough. I can't imagine using all of the sugar. I also used a veggie broth instead of the water. Now for the final taste.. it was very yummy and i would make it again for sure, just too much sugar and tomato but overall great. Next time i will add some jalapeno pepper for heat.

I second the reviews statin that the beans were still rather tough when soaked overnight and then mixed with the other ingredients for cooking.  I had to both soak and then boil the beans before they were soft enough to go in the crock pot.  I made some very minor changes to the ingredients:  I used leftover Christmas ham instead of bacon, freeze dried onion instead of fresh, and Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup, obviously, since it measures differently than real brown sugar).  The sauce was excellent.  I'm sure I'll make these again.

I soaked the beans overnight and then put them in the crock pot on low; After a few hours I switched it to high as the beans seemed very hard.  They were on high for about 6 hours. Long story short, I never served them as they never got soft.

I tried these yesterday, they were great! I boiled the beans for 2 hrs., and soaked all night.  I added the rest of the ingrediants and after 4hrs. in the crockpot they were ready to eat. I don't have to buy Bush's anymore. I highly recommend them.

I liked the sauce a lot but am in agreement with the ones that suggested cooking the beans first. I tried this recipe several times without cooking them first and the one time they never did soften. I will use this recipe but like some of the others have mentioned I will cook the beans first.

These taste just like the beans my mother made when I was a kid.  The only thing I do differently is that I soak the beans overnight AND boil them.  Otherwise the beans are, as my mother would say, like eating bullets.  I have made these many, many times and always get rave reviews.  Thanks for posting.

Yum! I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times. I didn’t change any ingredients, but did tweak the cooking process. I boil the beans and soak for an hour. Then place beans and everything else except salt and ketchup in the slow cooker. Once the beans are tender, I add the salt and ketchup and let cook on slow a few more hours. Oh, I also cook my bacon partially before putting in the slow cooker.

TLEFURGEY this is a great recipe as is. how ever I make 400 servings at a time for the a VFW Beach Bash here in the Philippines. We always get asked for extra. I don't use a slow cooker but cook them in 24x13x9 pans uncovered for 10 hours (while smoking my briskets) in my smoke house at 230 degrees. I use 25 cups of tomato ketchup (expensive here) and 25 cups Banana ketchup. I have to smoke my own bacon also I cut molasses back to 7 cups and brown sugar to 30 cups. I also add 10 extra cups of water due to long cooking time. the beans pick up smoke flavor and sweetness from the Mango wood I smoke with. for those that have a smoker try cooking them that way the flavor is out of this world.

I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them for 36 hours and they never did get soft (well, maybe a handful).  The "sauce" was very good, but who likes crunchy beans?  This will not be a saver!

These taste very similar to the baked beans my mom used to make when we were kids - they're sweet, which I love!  We made them ALMOST exactly as written...we sauteed the onions in the bacon grease and cooked the beans completely before we added the other ingredients and cooked.  I think they were 5 star as is, but my husband thought it needed "something," so I think the next time I make them, which will be soon, I will try either apple juice or beer in place of the water.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I soaked my beans for 24 HOURS then cooked on high for 10 hrs. THEY ARE STILL CRUNCHY. I'm pretty irritated. I have read before that acid from tomatoes can slow down the cooking in beans...of course I remembered this at about hour 7 of cooking. The flavor wasn't great anyway...tasted like ketchup.

The lesson here is "you just can't trust a bean". Bean quality varies. I have had beans turn out with little soaking or boiling at all. Other times nothing I did could save them. As a precaution I soaked overnight and boiled but not until fully cooked. My beans are in the crock as we speak. I doubled the recipe and added extra dry mustard and vinegar. The reciepe on the bean package is the one I always use but this was very close and I wanted to use the help of other reviewers. I gave 5 stars. I know this sauce will be a good one however these beans are starting out pretty soupy. I tried the paper towel trick but my paper towel fell in (which is exactly what my husband said would happen) I tried to use the moisture to stick it to the lid but it fell in right away. I put in some tomato paste but we'll see... I like my beans to taste like candy but found that the rest here like less sweet. Due to my addition of more dry mustard, vinegar and pepper the gang will probably be fine. I am thinking about one reveiwers suggestion of the Frank's hot sauce and the teaspoon of chili powder. Beans are fun to experiment with. I used a nice ham bone with lots of leftover ham from Xmas in my pot. Gave this a 5 star because already I know it's going to be good. My beans are 2 hours in and 3/4 cooked. I just hope I got a decent batch of navy beans to begin with. Thanks TLEFURGEY. Sometimes I throw the package out and am digging around for the recipe. Other than the vinegar this is very close.

My first time ever making beans & these turned out amazing. You def need to let them cook a long time but they were a big hit w/my husband! I froze the leftovers & plan to thaw them this weekend. What a great recipe! Thank you!

Not bad. I soaked the beans overnight and then simmered for about an hour. Cooked in slow cooker overnight. The bean were cooked, but not mushy -- perfect. My issue is with the sauce. It was ok, but tasted like ketchup. Next time, I will try a recipe that doesn't use ketchup as a base.

Great recipe!  I had lost my recipe that was almost the same, and this is perfect!  I made a couple of modifications, but I believe it would have been great anyway.  I added a diced green pepper and replaced some of the ketchup with barbecue sauce.  I probably only used half the brown sugar too and it was plenty sweet.  I thought I had bacon, but was out so I omitted it and no difference really.  The biggest key, as others have said,  is to make sure the beans are soft before adding everything else.  There's nothing worse than spending all day cooking to have it come out too tough.  Yes, it's happened to me.  LOL

This is the best baked bean recipe I have ever tried. It took a bit longer for the beans to soften, but it was worth the rate.  I highly recommend it.

This was my first attempt at make homemade beans. I pretty much follows the instructions except my beans cooked for 12 hours. Otherwise the flavor and taste was good.

Oh My, these were the best!  The hubby and kids loved them.  Not too sweet for us. I followed the suggestion of 8oz of water and cooking on low for 6 hours. I drained all but approxmately 1/2 cup of "broth", then I added the all of the ingredients and cooked for about 1 more hour.  Finally I baked in the oven on 350 for another 45 minutes. Wow I should have made these for July 4th. Well next time, no next week. LOL

PERFECT not-baked baked beans recipe. Exactly what I had a craving for. The only change I made was using Goya ham-flavored powder (two packets) instead of bacon to cut down on fat/calories. And, because I own the world's fastest slow cooker, I only cooked it for eight hours on low, and it was already starting to stick to the bottom of the pot. Seven hours probably would have done it. But for a normal slow cooker, the timing in the recipe should be right on.

I have never done baked beans in the slow cooker before but these are great. I soaked my beans over night and boiled them on the for an hour in the morning before adding them to the slow cooker. They were not to soft or hard it was perfect.

Went well with my family. You do need to soak beans and then boil them. They still were a bit tough in the end, so i would recommend soaking over a whole day and not just overnight.

I followed the recipe exactly and the beans turned out just right. They had the right amount of liquid. They were done. The baked beans were more perfect the second day as the liquid got absorbed more into the beans. I did taste at the end of the cooking time and added just a touch more of some of the seasonings. I put a few drops of smoke also.

yum! These taste a lot like the one's my mom used to make.  I made one change (because my hubby is a carnivore) and browned a half pound of ground beef before hand and threw that into the mix as well.  Even my 2 year old was nutz about this recipe!

I agree with other reviewers, I had to soak beans overnight and cook one hour and I think next time I'll cook for 30 more mins. Added sausage this time but may try ground beef next time in additon to bacon.

Followed the recipe with exception of soaking overnight AND boiling for 1 hr prior to starting up crock pot. Doubled the molasses as it's my girlfriend's favorite. Used Canadian 'FatBack' pork bacon to get those wonderful flavorful chunks like my father used to use.
Overall, it was darn good for slow-cooking as opposed to the standard bean crock in the oven method.

I followed the recipe completely, but the only thing I didn’t like was some of the beans were still a little hard. The recipe states, “soak beans overnight OR boil for an hour.” What I should of done was soak overnight and boil too. So what I ended up doing was when there was 2 hrs left I turned my crockpot up to high and then added an extra 1hr 45min and the beans turned out great, but there were still scattered beans a little hard. The recipe was very easy to put together and make.

Have made it a ton of times. Figured out that actually putting the beans in with water up to the top of them 6L slowcooker for overnight, then draining and adding the sauce in the morning makes perfect soft beans for supper time the next day! Have tried boiling and soaking but they were never consistent. This works wonderfully.

I made the mistake of adding too much water. At the end, I had to transfer it to the stove to reduce the liquid. I skipped the ketchup (allergic) and used half the brown sugar. I added the salt at the end along with half a teaspoon of ground smoked chipotle peppers & a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar. I think I doubled the ground mustard as well. I look forward to having these in my freezer to pull out on chilly mornings for a lunch that warms me up on several levels!

Way too sweet. Soaked the beans for about 14 hours. Cooked it in my slow cooker all day...about 12 hours on high. Beans still harder than I would like it. Tempted to throw out because its so sweet but instead will freeze it into small single servings as I don't believe in wasting food.

This came out too liquidy and really sweet...too sweet really, and I had omitted the molasses because I didn’t have any.  Can’t imagine how sweet it’d be otherwise. Wouldn’t make this again.

I added the whole 24-ounce bottle of catsup and reduced the water to about a half cup Instead of bacon a used a full pound of diced Taylor Ham Pork Roll (Yay New Jersey!!). I finished it off on the stovetop to let some of the liquid evaporate.  Yum!!

I'm giving this three stars only because it took 10 hours on high! I wish I had read the reviews before putting everything in the slow cooker! If I make it again I would definitely boil the beans first! It is good taste wise.

This recipe is amazing BUT I always add HALF of the amount of ketchup, otherwise the beans are way too thick & sweet. Make sure you soak your beans overnight and after cooking with this recipe they will be fully cooked.

Sometimes when I make this recipe I add maple syrup & liquid smoke sauce... definitely recommend!

I love this recipe! I have made this so many times and always get rave reviews. The best tip for this is to soak the beans overnight in cold water and then boil for an hour in the morning. You can combine all of the other ingredients into a bowl and dump everything in the slow cooker. However, do not add the salt. There is enough in the bacon and it can make the skins tough and not cook thoroughly. I also cook for an hour on high before turning it to low. It never fails. It can take 9 hours, but is SO worth it! Also, I use a whole pound of bacon. It's a preference for my family, but does make a difference. Love, love, love!!!

The sauce is delicious, but I wish I had seen the other reviews before I cooked it. You definitely do need to soak AND cook the beans. Otherwise they can end up kind of hard and dry, not good. But otherwise it is tasty enough that I will give it another try sometime.

Fantastic flavour but will cut sugar and/or ketchup down next time.  So easy to make and fills the house with that a-mazing aroma.  My grandmother’s old fashioned baked beans recipe will remain in my recipe box but this is great.

Very good, I soaked the beans overnight and I boiled them for 1/2 an hour.  I think I would boil them for the full hour next time just to make sure they are rehydrated.  We let them sit overnight after we made them and reheated them the next day to serve.  Didn't change a thing would make again.

Loved this recipe. I followed several of the suggestions and after soaking for 12 hours I simmered the beans for an hour. Also I'm not a lover of overly sweet beans so I reduced the brown sugar by half and instead of molasses I used a cup of medium dark maple syrup. Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours and the beans just melted in the mouth. This is a great base recipe that you can endlessly tinker with and add all sorts of flavours.

The sauce was delicious, but like other people have stayed, the beans never finished cooking. I had them on low for 16 hours and they stayed slightly crunchy.

I mixed navy and pinto beans and boiled for an hour.  Cooked on low for 10 hours in crockpot because beans weren't cooked enough *the pintos, of course*. Otherwise great recipe, my family has requested them several times.

I soaked the navy beans for 8 hours overnight, drained the water. Then added fresh water and cooked 3 cups of beans for 2 hours. When the skins burst in the air, I placed them in the slow cooker with the sauce recipe. When done after 8 hours of cooking,  they were still a little crunchy, but the sauce recipe is terrific!  It is similar to my Dad's beans, baked in a brown pot, but can serve a crowd.  I am going to cook the soaked beans half at a time so they are softer next time.

The beans were outstanding - loaded with flavor and not too sweet.  I soaked them overnight and simmered them for 1 hour and 20 minutes, then in the crock for 6 hours on low and 4 on high.  As recommended by others, I added the salt at the end of cooking.  Beans had a delightful slightly al dente bite.  This recipe was a hit!  Thanks for sharing it.  :)

After reading reviews I decided to cook my beans half done before adding to the crock pot. I drained their liquid and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. No one in my family liked it. The beans were mostly done but there were still a few crunchy ones. This was plenty sweet but the flavor just wasn't for us. It was a waste of food and time. Just a side note, I have read a lot of other baked bean recipes and some of them say to make sure you don't use black strap molasses because of it being too bitter.  I didn't have that kind so I didn't use it in this recipe but wanted to pass along the tip in case others like me are trying to find a perfect recipe for them.

Smells wonderful, I didn't have any trouble getting beans done like someone else mentioned.  Boiled them for an hour before hand, however.  Then, with the rest of the stuff several hours in the crock pot.  After I boiled them there was no water to pour off so used the whole thing in the crock pot.  Made it too soupy, but it tastes wonderful.  I slightly thickened the sauce.  Since I was making them for Easter dinner, I added ham chunks.

Super!  Made for Christmas and they were a hit. I will no longer be buying canned beans. 

The only change I made is that I soaked them overnight then cooked in crockpot on low for 6-8 hours until soft. Refrigerated overnight, then put back into crockpot using the recipe, (omitting any more water) and cooked them on low another 6 hours. I was afraid they would get too mushy but they were perfect. We love the sauce!

I just read a review that talked about one of my primary disappointments with this recipe.  The beans did not finish cooking completely even after soaking them overnight.  I should have know to boil them before putting them in the slow cooker but it's been awhile since I cooked beans and I don't do it often enough.  
In addition, I thought it was a little unusual to add so much ketchup to a baked bean recipe but I did and I WILL NEVER ADD KETCHUP to baked beans again.  Maybe if you want a barbecue type taste but NOT for a Boston Baked Bean type of dish.  I cooked it per the recipe, put the beans in refrigeration overnight before even using them and then heated them up the next morning.  I disliked it so much that I through out the whole pot of beans.

This recipe isn’t great.
I followed the suggestions and soaked beans overnight and boiled them to ensure they were soft enough.  I didn’t add ketchup or salt until the end, put paper towel under the lid to absorb moisture and halved the brown sugar so they wouldn’t be too sweet. 
The consistency is great but they taste like ketchup beans! WAY too much ketchup! I added more brown sugar to try to counteract the tomato taste but it didn’t really help. Now I’m stuck with a huge container of ketchup baked beans.
I’ll be asking my mother in law for her delicious recipe to use from now on.

This did NOT WORK! I soaked the beans for 18 hours, put them in the slow cooker for 6 hours with the other ingredients, still crunchy. Put it on high for another 1 1/2 hours, still crunchy. Put it in the pressure cooker for 1/2 hour, still crunchy. Have it in there for another hour, but had to make other plans for dinner due to time constraints. I Really think you need to bring it up to temp for an hour before you can bank on those beans getting cooked. This recipe doesn't deliver.

Couldn't eat them, followed  recipe exactly and even cooked for 2 more hours. They never cooked tender enough to eat, will never make again!!  Would give a minus 10 if I could!!!!!

I followed advice from other reviewers and soaked the beans for 15 hours, boiled them on simmer for another hour, and did not add the salt or ketchup until after the beans were soft in the slow cooker.  The only changes I made to the recipe were reducing the brown sugar by half, and adding a small can of stewed tomatoes which I had puréed.  They were really tasty and good for a group - I made the recipe for a group of 10 and had some left overs.  Caution with cooking time:  I started on "High" and  had to stop the cooking time to keep beans from getting mushy.  Will cook longer on "Low" next time.  I think this recipe has more nutrition in it than the recipes that call for tinned  beans.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I would make it again. But probably would cut down on the sugar a bit. It was a little too sweet for my taste. I didn't soak my beans overnight, just boiled them for one hour before putting them in the slow cooker.

Good sauce.  I used canned great northern beans because I didn't have time to soak and boil them per other reviews s.  I drained and rinsed them really well.   Also only used 1 cup water because I wanted to sauce to be thicker.  They were a hit!

I used canned beans and it was a crowd-pleaser.  Since the beans were already cooked, I used only 1 cup of water.  I used BBQ sauce for half of the ketchup & only 2/3 C of brown sugar.

This was my first time making beans from scratch and while the flavor was great (although a bit too sweet and I halved the sugar) my beans didn't turn out too well.  I soaked them overnight and then boiled for an hour before adding all the other ingredients and after a couple of hours they become mushy.  My beans ended up looking like refried beans but tasting like bbq baked beans. lol.  I may try again but maybe not boil my beans before cooking.

I highly recommend these! They're GREAT!!  Easy to make, delicious and, for me, taste better cold. I've found cooking the beans on the stove works better.  Use a bigger pan and fill with water, - don't just cover the beans.

They turned out great. I loved these beans, but they do take much longer than the recipe states.  I'll make these again but start them early in the morning or maybe even the night before.

I always like to read the reviews and make suggested changes that are to my liking. So as previous reviewers commented, I soaked the beans over night (12 hours) and then boiled them for an hour in water without salt. This definitely helped soften them.   I don't like beans too sweet so used half the brown sugar, and also halved the ketchup with tomatoe puree. If you do this, you may want to add about a quarter cup of more liquid (going to try burbon next time for kicks).  These were going with smoked ribs, so I was lucky and had some homemade smoked bacon in the fridge to use to give it more the BBQ taste. Next time if I just have regular bacon, I might add a tablespoon of liquid smoke for the outdoors taste. But that is just a preference. I also fried the bacon with the onions so that I could remove some of the grease before adding it to the pot for the full cooking time. These are just some personal preferences. This recipe is bang on and can easily be added to depending on your tastes and eaters. Excellent base recipe. Thanks for sharing.

i cooked it for 12 hours instead of 10 because I didn't think the liquid had reduced enough. Soon after taking it of the heat it thickened up. Beans had a mushier consistency than I would have liked but all in all I think they turned out very well.

Would cook for 10 now that I know it thickens more after taking it off the heat

Excellent! Soaked beans overnight and in morning, cooked beans as per package ( one hour until soft). Had they not been soft I would not have used them for the recipe...  hard, cooked  beans indicate the bean may too old and past their prime!  Appreciated reading comments on how beans may not cook right!  Used cooked bacon as my alternate to a salted pork! Baked in slow cooker on high for approx. an hour to meld flavours and then on low for approx.3 -4hours, stirring several times! Reminded me of my Mom's baked beans!  This recipe may replace my 'fake baked beans' now that I have had success cooking the beans from scratch!

I'm so frustrated that people give this a 5-star and then write in the comments that I did not cook. I only look at the stars I don't read everybody's comments before making something I guess that's my mistake. This recipe did not cook I still had hard beans at 10 hours in the crockpot. Very frustrating when you're responsible for bringing baked beans to a party of 30 people.

Excellent.  NOTE: I did soak the beans as directed, rinsed them, and boiled them in water for about 20 minutes.  At 15 minutes or so, I started "bite" testing them for softness.  This is the trick to avoid mushy beans, in my opinion.  Soak, Boil and bite test until you no longer notice any hardness.  
We ate them all.  We served them hot for dinner, we reheated a serving in the frying pan to serve with eggs one morning, we ate them cold for lunch with a sandwich and they were good every time.  This will be my go to recipe for baked beans.

Made this vegan very easily - delicious and everyone loved the smoky bacon flavour (even though it was bacon-free). Because I don't like pieces of anything in my baked beans (just beans and smooth sauce), I pureed the chopped onion with some of the water (1/2 cup or so) and a few tbsp of vegetarian 'bacon bits,' then added that puree to the slow cooker with everything else. Also, I used can beans... in my experience, my slow cooker never ever gives me soft/tender beans if I use dried ones (even with pre-soaking) so I didn't want to risk it. Using canned beans meant I could cut about half the water, and the time (I let these go 5 hours on low). Thanks for the recipe!

I will make this again!  Used dry bean and always have an issue with "hard" beans.  Maybe put sugar in too early, or where I buy my beans.  My beans came out better than usual with this recipe.

Well, I soaked the beans for 13 hours, then drained them and added the beans and other ingredients to the crock pot, cooked them for 6 hours so far and they are still hard. I am supposed to be bringing these to a rib fest BBQ now, but there is no way they are ready and I am betting that they will still be hard in another couple of hours, due to the ketchup and salt being added. I think the person who said that they need to be soaked and boiled (or just boiled) is likely right. So I have learned something....soak and/or boil the beans, and check that they are tender before you add the other ingredients!

Part 2: Have now cooked the beans in the slow cooker/crockpot for a total of 10 hours and they are pretty good, though some of the beans are a bit crunchy. The flavour is very good though! They are quite edible...but I have a ton of beans to eat! I still think that boiling them is key  to ensure they are soft and likely will cut down on the amount of time they need to  cook in the crockpot. I would try this recipe again with that change in mind.

I made these beans twice.  Once in a really large batch for a large birthday party and once in a smaller batch for a cookout.  They turned out awesome both times.  I soaked the beans overnight and boiled them for one hour then I combined all ingredients and put them in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours.  They came out perfect!  I don't like really mushy beans.  They were the perfect consistency.  the sauce was sweet and flavorful.  Everyone liked the sweetness of the beans.  I may cut back the molasses just a smidge and see how they turn out.  I usually double the recipe for a large crock pot and it's just enough to fill the crock. Extra bacon is also a bonus!  If you want to spice them up, add a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash chipotle seasoning!

Cook the beans first! And then these are very good.  I add about a TBLS of cloves to darken it further and be amazing!

Best baked beans ever after I altered it a bit to suit a diabetic guest. I used splenda brown sugar and substituted 2 chopped apples and Agave syrup in place of the molasses. I used extra thick bacon and more of it from Sandy View Farms in Spruce Grove AB which has the best bacon in the world and that might a big of a difference as well. For a finishing touch I added about a teaspoon of Liquid smoke which add s a bit a flavor

I boiled the beans for an hour before they went into the crock pot, and I didn't have an onion, so I put some frozen fajita peppers and onions in with it.  I also cooked it on high for 6.5 hours.  It came out delicious!

I read a lot of the other reviews and noted that many said the beans never softened.  So I soaked them overnight, and then boiled them at least an hour before putting them in the slow cooker.  I also reduced the amount of brown sugar to just a few spoonfuls as some people said it was too sweet.  I cooked them on HIGH for about 6 hours and then reduced it to LOW for the last 2 hours.  The beans were soft, the consistency was perfect and they were the hit of the BBQ! (I did not use pork, bacon or any meat, and substituted the water with vegetable broth).

Add a bit of baking soda when soaking the beans. Helps for them to be tender.

I soaked the beans over night and cooked them in my crockpot for ten hours and they were still not cooked. I didn't want to cook them any longer because I was afraid the high level of sugar would eventually burn. I served them to my family on Father's Day and was politely told they were too sweet and that I should have cut back on the molasses.  My husband said he liked them, but I have to agree that they were too sweet.

These were the most delicious bake beans I have ever had!  The only change I made was I used 2 packages of real bacon bits because I didn't feel like cooking bacon.  I will definitely be making these again.  My husband loved them too!!

I am skipping the star rating as well, as maybe I did something wrong, but....  After reading the reviews, I soaked the dry beans for about 20 hours and boiled them for about an hour.  I assembled my ingredients, waiting to add salt until the end, but the beans are still firmer than I would like after being in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.  And unfortunately, the 'sauce' does not have the flavor profile that I like- it is a bit non-descriptive for baked beans.  I did double the servings for the recipe, but that should not change the 'sauce' flavor.  So, a couple hours before the party, I am headed to Sam's club for beans!  Such a bummer.  Most recipes on this site are terrific!

the sauce makes it!  I did cut back to 1/2 the sugar (already sweet with molasses).  didn't have any dry mustard, so just added Dijon mustard instead.  and just for variety, used 1c of red beans.
boiled until beans dente, then dumped in slower cooker w/sauce, set to high for 5 hrs.  I used a wooden spoon to keep the lid ajar, so the sauce would evaporate and reduce.  great beans for a bbq!

First I want to say the sauce is very good. But,... I used the little white navy beans, soaked overnite,then drained added sauce and put in crock pot .10 hrs. Later the beans were  still chewy,  continued to cook on low  over 12 hrs. By this time sauce was to concentrated even with addition of water during the cook time. So perhaps soak, drain, pre -cook in water on stove till tender, then add to crockpot with sauce. Not sure worth all the process.

Hubby LOVED these beans!  As others suggested, I halved the sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I would be interested to find a substitution for the ketchup, since this recipe uses up most of a bottle!

I loved these beans!  However they took alot longer to cook than the recipe mentioned.  I soaked beans over night as directed but even after 10 hrs cooking the next day they were still hard. Next time I would soak longer and boil for an hour as well.

I loved the sauce for these beans. Made a batch for Sunday football and the guys loved it. There was none left.

I followed the recipe exactly but had a problem with the cooking time. Even though I soaked the navy beans for 20 hours, after 10 hours in the slow cooker the beans were as hard as skittles still. I ended up cooking the beans a total of 20 hours in the slow cooker to achieve the required tenderness in the beans. (while occasionally adding more water to maintain the moisture)

Next time I'm going to try par-boiling the navy beans for 30 minutes after soaking to see if this will shorten the cooking time.

Simmer beans for one hour and then soak overnight, drain, dump in crock pot. I also make the sauce the night before using a full pkg of bacon and 1/2 cup brown sugar being the only adjustments I made. Stir well, cook on low for 8 hrs, done to perfection!

This was a fabulous recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing! I did boil the beans an hour versus soaking them overnight so I didn't run into the issue of the beans not being fully cooked as mentioned in a few reviews. I will make this again!

This recipe was one of the best ones I have tried for baked beans. Had to cook a few hours longer than suggested to get the beans softer but other than that it was gobbled up right away and everyone said it was delicious. I will be using this recipe again for sure.

I can say hands down this was an amazing recipe. I used smoked bacon thick cut strips and diced a pack of 8 slices up and it was out of this world. Didn't add any onions as I have kids but this is a keeper and turned out awesome. This is the second time I made this batch. I always soaked the beans overnight and then stir them up. I get up the next morning and mix everything up and put the slow cooker on for 7am its done around 5. I cook the beans on high for 2-3 hours and then use low temp for the rest of the time this just makes sure the beans aren't crunchy.

Definitely read the helpful reviews. Soak beans over night AND boil for about an hour before hand. Cook for 9-10 hours and don't add the ketchup or salt till the last half hour or so. Also, only about 1/4 cup of ketchup. Trust me, I love ketchup but more the 1/4 cup is way too much.

I followed the recipe and added the salt at the beginning. The beans were hard after 10 hours of cooking and I ended up cooking them twice as long. Do not add salt until the end. I mAy add the beans were soaked in water overnight the night before. Could be the acid from the ketchup, too. 
My second issue it doesn't taste that good. Ketchup is a condiment, not a main ingredient.

I did soak overnight & boil the beans for about 45 minutes before I put into the crockpot. Be sure to cover with enough water the night before, they soak up a LOT of water. Also put into an extra large pot with enough water when boiling. I put in the exact amount of ingredients called for. They were good & made the house smell wonderful.

I won't make this again. They are sickeningly sweet, lack flavor and even after soaking the beans overnight then boiling for an hour, a few remain crunchy. I added vinegar, prepared mustard, KC Masterpiece BBQ Seasoning and BBQ sauce in an attempt to cut the "sweetness" and add some flavor. I must admit, they taste better, but we won't be finishing the batch.

These were pretty good.  Scaled brown sugar way down (to about half what was called for) and baked in the oven after giving beans a brine pre-soaking and then simmering beans for about an hour (my crockpot died and moved on to a better place).  Still a little sweet, but I'm not complaining (grin).  Thanks so much for recipe.

I made these for my daughters birthday bbq and everyone LOVED them.  It was my first time making homemade baked beans and it was a huge relief that I picked an accurate recipe to try.  I did follow other suggestions and cook my beans a bit before adding the other ingredients. Thank you.  :)
