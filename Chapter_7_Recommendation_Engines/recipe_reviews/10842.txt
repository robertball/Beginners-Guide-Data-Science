I took the reviews into consideration while making this for cupcakes, and didn't want them too sugary, so I added 3 tbsp cocoa pwdr. and kept everthing else the same as the recipe called for. My icing came out so thick and I think I might have figured out why some are having problems with it being too thin. If you are using margering instead of butter, there is a higher content of water in it.  This frosting is fantastic for cupcakes, nice and thick if you use butter.  I'll be keeping this easy and delicous recipe.

Very easy to make.  No problem with the consistency, but others might have had a problem if the butter was melted or didn't mix long enough.  Mom's tip is to add a touch of salt to help even out the sweetness.  Turned out great.

This recipe is a bit sweet if you are using it without the cocoa.  If you do use cocoa with it, it tastes great.  I added a half cup of cream cheese (making the vanilla version) and it tasted even better. This does NOT yeild 3 cups, I only got 1 and 1/2 or so cups out of this.

Powdered sugar frosting, basic buttercream frosting, whatever you want to call it this recipe has the perfect proportions of butter to powdered sugar.  I made the vanilla version and didn't measure the milk, just added enough to get the consistency I wanted.  For novice cooks, it is important to cream the butter and sugar well, a good few minutes, until it is very light and fluffy!  Update 11-19-12: The chocolate variation of this recipe, while fluffy and delicious, is a very LIGHT chocolate.  If you like it darker, replace some of the powdered sugar with more cocoa powder.

I needed a frosting recipe for cookies I was making. My friend had neglected to give me her frosting recipe with the cookies, so I needed something delicious and easy. It's so good, I had a hard time not licking the spoon as I frosted. Absolutely delicious! Will use this recipe from now on.

This was the easiest, fastest, and most delicious frosting recipe ever!! I don't know what happened to the person who wrote the review saying it was like pudding...maybe they put in too much milk, but I didn't have that problem at all. We used it to frost our Valentine's Day cookies, just added a drop of red food coloring for pink frosting and it is great!!!

I made the chocolate version using unsweeted cocoa- delicious. After mixing it up (I added the cocoa in at the beginning - works fine) I added another tablespoon of cocoa for a slightly more intense chocolate flavor. This is so easy to make and tastes just as good as store-bought but WITHOUT THE TRANS FATS. The very first ingredient in store-bought frosting is partially hydrogenated oil!Gross! So, feel good making this frosting for your kids!
Note: The color is a light creamy brown.

This turned out wonderfully! At first I thought it looked just a little runny but it piped and set up beautifully on my cupcakes! I used it to frost Cream Filled Cupcakes (also found on this site) and the tastes matched perfectly! It wasn't too sweet at all and I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks alot!

Simple, easy and delicious!  However, I'd suggest making twice as much if you are going to frost and fill a 9" cake.  I don't understand what people are saying about the pudding consistency.  I had no butter so I used margarine, and it was still wasn't runny.  Maybe they are comparing it to canned frosting, but as homemade frostings go, it's the best!

Why buy store bought frosting when this recipe is sooooo good?! I made chocolate frosting with 3T. good quality cocoa (from Penzey's Spices) and half and half instead of milk. Use electric beaters to mix up the frosting and there should be no complaints about the consistency.

If you're looking to take away some of the sweetness, add 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice. Just perfect!

Yum Yum! I wish I would have known sooner that making your own frosting was that easy. I followed someone's advice and first beat the room temperature butter until fluffy, then added the sugar, beat, then added the vanilla, beat some more, last I added the milk. I used it as a middle frosting layer in my chocolate cake. It really made it extra special.

Really easy and amazing frosting... definitely make with butter!!  As other reviewers said it is a very sweet recipe but the cocoa really balances it out.  I doubled the cocoa and it was perfect.

This recipe is good...but I am giving it 4 stars because it's too sweet for the vanilla as stated.  I took the advice of a few others on here...added cream cheese and 1/2 tsp of milk at a time until I got my desired consistency.  If you are making the vanilla portion of this, and the recipe as is, is too sweet for you - add in 1 TB of cream cheese at a time until you get it to your desired sweetness.  The cream cheese will take the sweetness down a notch.  So I used about 1 3/4 Cup powdered sugar, 1/2 cup (softened -left out for a few hours) butter, 2 tsp milk - put it 1/2 tsp at a time and 2 TB cream cheese (adding 1 TB at a time...and had left this out for a few hours to soften)...oh and 1 tsp vanilla.  It covered 18 cupcakes good.  If you are making a cake, you will likely have to double the recipe to get enough frosting.

This was yummy and easy to make.

This recipe was very easy to make. It was a bit sweet so I may take the advice of another reviewer and add more cocoa powder to cut the sweetness a little. I did notice that the recipe calls out the serving size is 48, but i was only able to frost 12 cupcakes (barely) with this recipe. I didn't go crazy on the frosting either. I did pipe the frosting but this should have covered at least 2 dozen but it didn't.

This is a very good, basic recipe for frosting.  I made it as directed only I subbed almond extract for the vanilla.  Tasted even better the next day when the flavors had a chance to meld.  Thank you for sharing what will be my standard go-to frosting recipe.

I consider myself to have a sweet tooth and I found the vanilla version of this recipe ENTIRELY too sweet. I really wanted to use the white version, because I want to color it for a birthday cake. In reading the reviews, others said that using unsweetened cocoa mellowed the sweetness, so I tried that. It is better, but I'm still not sure about it. The consistancy was good. Overally, not a huge fan of this recipe.

Made this tonight with the cocoa for 9X13 MMMmmm Chocolate Cake from this site.  Frosting is easy and quick to put together.  Didn't even need all of the milk.  I think I just used less than a tablespoon.  Not too sweet.  Just right.  I will be making this frosting again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made the chocolate version.  We accidentally sifted the cocoa powder with the sugar, instead of adding it at the end, and it still turned out absolutely fine.  This is a melt in your mouth frosting, and it's absolutely delicious.  I will be using this frosting from now on for anything I need.  Easy ingredients I always have on hand.  I put the frosting on David's Yellow Cake, and it was great.  I made a layered cake, and I had just enough frosting for it.  I will say if you are a person who likes their cakes to be very thickly frosted, double this recipe.  A little bit more frosting wouldn't have hurt, I may even make a double batch of it if I make that recipe again, but it was still good with the amount of frosting that was on it.

Loving this recipe... I added some butter flavoring and I'm not sure if that took it over the top, but my boyfriend is a big fan (he says it's just a little different but somehow it's soo good). I will take that as a winner =) I bake almost nonstop, so he's had his share of taste-testing and providing feedback. I whipped this for several minutes and am excited to use it tomorrow to decorate some cupcakes and cakes!! Hoping it pipes as swell as it tastes!

Made it as written, and it was fine.  However, then I adjusted it by adding another cup of confectioners' sugar and some more milk.  I found that reduced the stronger butter taste.  Before it was a bit too greasy of a texture.

This is the best frosting recipe I've found!  I didn't have to change anything and loved the light chocolate color and flavor.  As a cake decorator this is the recipe I will use in both vanilla and chocolate versions for future projects.  Definitely double (or triple) the recipe if you're frosting and filling a cake but as is it will frost a dozen cupcakes. EVERYONE who's had this from me has commented on how good it is and/or asked for the recipe.

Excellent flavor! It was not thick like frosting, but more like pudding so I am not sure if I'll make it again because of that. I tried addign corn startch to thicken it up which did help a bit.

I've been making powdered sugar frosting since I was a young girl, but I never measured the ingredients before. I just mixed some powdered sugar and butter, then added too much milk, then added more powdered sugar, then added too much milk...You get the idea! I learned early to add the milk just a little bit at a time. Today I made this to use on the train cake that is on the video for my grandson's birthday, so I measured. I had to make 3 batches, and they were great. I used exactly 1 TBS. milk to 2 cups powdered sugar. I mixed it with an electric mixer and it was a snap. From now on, I'll measure! By the way, any leftover frosting was always used to frost graham crackers!

It came out great! I realized that in order to make frosting properly, u do need a mixer of some sort! Just a whisk alone had always made frostings runny, not so much as a frosting lol but i used this recipe for chocolate cupcakes as well as a cake :) thank you!

Thank you so much for this, I am not the greatest chef or baker I am a mom of 4 and need the most help I can. I love to give treats for my children to share with the kids in their classes for special occasions. Tonight I realized that my Daughter's class was celebrating Summer birthdays before the school year ends and I wanted to take part since her birthday is in August. I had no Icing though. Had no spare change to buy any and it was to late before I got the note.  So I thought maybe I could try and  make it myself. I found this website and found the recipe first and thought I should try it. All I have to say is WOW very delicious the kids are going to enjoy these very much and I thank you for your contribution to this web site.. You saved me.. LOL Also I will never buy icing EVER again.

This frosting is delicious!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder.  Added milk by the teaspoon until it was the consistency I wanted.  Turned out perfect!

This was enough frosting for about 21 cupcakes, so I would double the recipe if frosting a layer cake.  Will definitely use this recipe from now on!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so creamy and spreadable. To help cream the butter, I put the hard stick in the microwave for 5 seconds several times. Then I just stuck it in the mixer until the butter was nice and creamy. I added the other ingredients and it came out so nice! Definitely will make this again!

i had to double the recipe, it just wasnt enough to cover 24, which is the amount of one cake box. The grainy taste that other members were talking about went away with more blending so that was nothing to worry about. other than that i mixed red dye with it and my nieces and nephews loved it!

By far the best frosting recipe I've come across so far!! I made two batches of chocolate frosting for a two layer cake. I mixed the frosting by hand..took about 10 min of stirring and a sore arm for each batch to get the right consistency but well worth the time. My sisters were sneaking spoonfuls of frosting as I was frosting the cake! Will use this recipe for cakes now on

Wow!  I made this recipe just as written, except I creamed the butter alone first before adding the rest.  My kids licked the bowl and beaters clean, and I can't stop snitching!  It's a keeper!

Perfect!! I was looking for a Vanilla frosting recipe that does not use shortening and this one is great. I used salted butter and the result is not too sweet. One recipe is NOT enough to frost a two layer 9" cake, so you'll need to double the recipe for that.

Awesome recipe!  I made a double batch, 4 layer cake and decided to use this one to frost between the layers for contrast (it was chocolate) and use a different chocolate frosting for the outside.  I wish I had used this recipe for the outside as well.  It was so soft and creamy!  I made mine as instructed without the cocoa powder. Alone it did taste buttery (not bad) but I used it for a cake and the flavor of the cake was more dominant.  Yum.

Not bad frosting, really, really tastes like butter though, which in some instances might be great.  I think next time, I'll do half butter/half shortening, but that's just my preference.  I also liked the addition of the touch of salt, it does bring out the taste.  I noticed that in another recipe and decided to try it with this one, just a pinch will do!

Delicious and versitile, I often omit the cocoa and add other flavors (cream cheese, orange juice, peppermint, etc.) to compliment the dessert of the day - always, with wonderful results.

I like this because it has a relatively low amount of butter, compared to a buttercream frosting.  Mine turned out perfectly.  I was afraid of the 'too sweet' possibility so I added half a pinch of salt.  It was divine!  The key is to add the milk very sparingly, NO more than 1 1/2 Tbsp.

My mother use to make this with blue bonnet margerine. Perfect recipe to change up without messing it up. Great to use with different flavored extracts and/or food coloring and doesnt lose its thick consistency. Also for the butter take it from the fridge and let it warm up to room temp (or zap in microwave for about 10 seconds. (-: )

I make homemade frosting all the time!. I prefer homemade to the store bought stuff. No offense Betty Crocker. For those of you getting a thin consistency frosting there are 2 things you can do. 1) Add about 1/4 cup of vegetable shortening. This will definitely thicken it and give you a better consistency without losing the flavor. Or 2) slow down your mixer. When you cream the ingredients together too quickly you melt the butter making it soupy. Also, use less milk if the butter is really soft. I HOPE THIS HELPS!!! Happy frosting! :)

I made it for cupcakes and split the recipe in half made half chocolate and half vanilla. I colored the vanilla and this recipe doesnt take too well to food coloring but it tastes good. As others said it doesnt make as much as expected.

Great and versitle recipe!  Everyone loved this frosting on cupcakes.  My husband raved about it and a friend said she just wanted a tub of this icing for her next birthday!  Definitely double for 24 cupcakes or a cake.

I've never made homemade frosting before and OH MY GOD! This was delicious! I had to stop myself from eating all of it before I could spread it on my cherry turnovers! The only problem was that I think I added one too many tablespoons of milk because it was a little runny but it was still sooooo delicious.

GREAT recipe!   What I like about it is you can use one recipe and make both vanilla and chocolate frosting.  I would have liked a heavier texture but it was sweet enough without adding more sugar.  I did, however, add 1/4 tsp. of salt as I felt it needed it.   Thank you for sharing such a GREAT recipe Anonymous.  I'm giving it 5 stars because the ease of two flavors makes up for the salt and texture issue.

This frosting was too sweet for me so I added 3 oz. of cream cheese instead of milk. It not only cut the sweetness, but it also gave it the perfect consistency.

used this frosting on my daughters birthday cake and it was yum! I didn't add the cocoa to it. Make sure you use a real and high grade vanilla flavoring. You could prob. try adding different flavor and hav great success. This frosting has a great spreading consistancy but I think it's a little too sweet to use between layers as well as on top. I filled my cake with lightly sweetened whipped cream and fresh unsweetened strawberries. It was perfect.

I eliminated the cocoa powder because I needed to dye the frosting, but it was very tasty! It was sweet, but I like a sweet frosting, and it was perfect for decorating cupcakes. My only complaint is that this definitely wouldn't have frosted 48 cupcakes. It barely did my 24!

So easy and so tasty!!  Never buying store-bought again.  The mixture was dry and messy when I first tried to use my hand-mixer so I added a few drops of milk and whisked the mixture by hand a few times before using the electric mixer.  Turned out great, but admittedly a bit too sweet.  If you don't have a stand mixer, soften the butter a bit and whisk the mixture by hand for a few strokes before using the hand-mixer to avoid a white powdery mess!

I was disappointed in this frosting, especially considering the reviews.  It is very buttery--frosting even separated some.  It definitely turned out more like a glaze than frosting.  I will try another recipe next time.

I have just finished making this wonderful frosting... only added topped cocoa powder to 3 tbsp and used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of cream cheese per others reviews for a more intense, less butter flavour! The taste is to-die-for and had to agree with others that this recipe DOES NOT YIELD 3 CUPS BUT SOME 1.5 - 2 CUPS. I managed to pipe out beautifully on "Too Much Chocolate Cake" as a birthday cake for boss' daughter. Will post picture soon...

I used plain soy milk instead of dairy milk but couldn't taste a difference. This was easy and incredibly delicious. I frosted a ginger-cranberry cake. I will use this recipe again.

I almost hesitate to admit to the number of years I have been trying to duplicate a simple icing that my mother used to make. Although capable, she did little baking other than very good brownies. I remember her dense and delicious brownies and how much I liked the vanilla icing. It was even better if left to dry out for a day or two. The outside stiff while the inside stayed creamy. While following the ingredients and directions as stated here I came to the beating and thought that 1- 1/2 Tbsp milk wouldn't be enough. Previously I have come to this point and gone ahead and added more milk. I can't say why I just kept beating tonight but as a result I have finally resolved the icing mystery. What to me looked dry and too stiff was how the consistency was supposed to be. Except a touch grainy (which I will work on) this is a great icing recipe.

My family really likes this recipe, like a lot. However, I didn't like the texture too much. It was kinda grainy and I just don't like that buttery sugary taste. But frosting like this isn't my thing. It was easy to work though

Followed recipe exactly... Perfect! Will use the recipe from now on. Comes out great even without the cocoa. I've also tried adding citrus zest, and that came out wonderfully as well.

This is a very good recipe! It was a bit sweet for my taste but my boyfriend thought it was the best ever! FYI- I didn't measure but I don't think it made 3 cups. I had barely enough frosting to cover a 9x13 cake. I will definitely make this again! It was super easy!

This frosting was pretty good though it took a while to get the texture just right. I would suggest using a little less sugar. I used corn starch to thicken the frosting because mine was a little runny but I didn't want to add sugar because it was already to sweet.

Tried this one out to frost the cupcakes I made (Simple White Cake recipe on the site). Was disappointed. The recipe, as is, came out nice in texture, but way too sweet. So I added milk...which ruined the original texture. It still didn't help the sweetness. Eventually I had a semi-runny mess that still wasn't that great in flavor. Maybe I did something wrong? Or maybe hand mixing just won't work for this one.

This is the same recipe that my paternal grandmom passed down to my dad, and he taught my mom.  It's more like a jumping off point than a recipe.  You start with those ingredients then add more till you have the right taste and right amount of frosting.  Works great every time!

This is slightly grainier than frosting made with shortening, but it's definitely worth it to avoid the trans fats!  I doubled the recipe to cover 24 cupcakes and had about 1/2 recipe left over at the end.  If I made it again, I would add a little salt to offset the sweet, but this is very yummy!  My 4 year old said it was the best she'd ever had.

I read some reccomendations and then I tweaked this to my liking for a VANILLA frosting...I doubled the sugar, used 1/2c butter and 1/2 c of cream cheese, NO MILK, and about 1/2 t. (or so) of lemon juice to cut the sweetness, and of course the 2 t. of vanilla.  This way it turned out PERFECT.  Just the right balance.  Thanks for the great start!  This is now my staple frosting recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!! I tried the vanilla recipe as written, I thought it was great, I used a pinch of salt like some suggested. My husband, however, thought it was too sweet. Also, the original batch only frosted about 12 cupcakes. So I decided to add the 1/2 cup of cream cheese (another reviewer suggestion) and doubled the recipe when I made it again. This was PERFECTION!! The texture and flavor was wonderful. I will definately use this recipe again, even without the cream cheese.

I was looking for an icing recipe that I could adapt to make some 'mini-monster' cupcakes for my daughter's class at school. This turned out AWESOME! I needed a recipe that wouldn't be TOO sweet because there is a lot of icing on the cupcakes. This worked out perfectly. Everyone raved about it - and  it sets up nicely so that they didn't have the messy icing all over their fingers from eating it. Thanks!

This recipe was tasty but quite sweet. I frosted One Bowl Chocolate Cake III and that made the sweetness balance out. It was a nice frosting overall. The one complaint I would make is the texture of the frosting was too runny. I tried all the suggestions other members made and then I even stuck it in the freezer for a bit. It helped a little but was still almost dripping off my cake.

I made this recipie for my cousin's birthday. I had 24 large cupcakes and it was enough frosting for frosting all the cupcakes + writing "HAPPY 6th B-DAY CASEY" + a little more. Great recipie, my only little issue would be it's a little "buttery" tasting, but next time i'll add a little more vanilla, and try the chocolate version.
Defnitley a keeper, Thanks!

Awesome!  So simple and easy.  I'm not sure why some have experienced a problem with the frosting being too runny.  I actually had to ADD more milk to mine.  It was delicious and raved about!  Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Love this frosting, quick, easy, and flavorful. Needed a last minute recipe and this was perfect. Took Naples34102 advice to add milk until desired consistency. I used salted butter; therefore, no salt had to be added. I also used clear vanilla to keep the color white. Recipe doesn't make three cups, estimate one to 1 1/2 cups. Had to double recipe to have enough to frost two layer 8" cake.

This is delicious! I added the cocoa powder. I actually used 3 tablespoons because I wanted a stronger chocolate flavor. This frosting is very thick, fluffy and decadent.

This recipe is by far the best frosting! I've used it on cake, cookies, and an eclair dessert. Consistency needs to be adjusted with the varying items with a little more or less milk depending on what I make. But, I use this recipe every time!

I modified this recipe since I didn't have milk or butter.  I used butter flavored Crisco and 2 tablespoon of water as substitutes.  It actually came out great, I was happily surprised that it did.  I live in Texas and I know of many who use Crisco to make icing because of the higher melting point, but this was the first time I had tried it.

This is the only recipe that I use for vanilla frosting. I only used 1.5 cups of the sugar and about 1 tablespoon of  milk. I added the milk in small amount at a time until it reached the thickness of the frosting that I wanted. I always make 1.5 recipes to frost 12 cupcakes.

Perfect frosting when you're in a pinch.  I did add a bit to much liquid which made it a tad runny, but the taste was wonderful.  This will probably be my go-to from now on.

Worked perfectly for me just as the recipe is written.  I used unsalted stick butter which may be the difference in some of the other reviews saying the icing came out too thin.  Mine was nice and thick...perfect for frosting.

So good I licked the beaters.  I did add 1/2 a tsp of almond extract to it and it really turned out good!

Very (too) buttery for me. Nice and thick if you're for frosting cakes and cupcakes.

Very good and easy to whip up.  This recipe made enough to cover my 9x13 cake.  Will make again, it had a light and slighly sweet taste.  I was looking for a vanilla frosting, so i didn't use the cocoa powder.  Followed recipe exactly, except cocoa.

This was a very good recipe....would work awesome as a starter recipe with the ability to change the flavor according to substituting the vanilla extract.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is it was too sweet  to use as a vanilla recipe for my taste so I did end up adding the cocoa and it came out really good.

I made this frosting exactly the way the recipe calls and it came out delicious. Soooooo...creamy. Put it on some hamemade cupcakes for my little guy's birthday, everyone enjoyed. Never buy store bought again.

This recipe is the same I grew up using before store-bought icing. The only difference is we used canned evaporated milk.

Does this ever take me back to my childhood!  Once a week in my teens, I got to bake a cake (it was a reward thing).  This was the only frosting I ever used because back then there wasn't any canned frosting available at the grocery stores.  The cake flavor determined whether I made the vanilla or the chocolate version of this frosting.  I'm going to bake a cake right now and whip up some of this memorable frosting.  Thank you for posting this tried and true recipe.

This is a great quick frosting.  FYI, I didn't have cocoa powder so I zapped 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave for 2 mins on medium heat and added them after when beating the butter, sugar, and vanilla.  You can add a tiny bit more milk if you find the chips make it too thick.  But chocolate flavor came out great.  This frosting is on the sweeter side, for sure, but delicious.

I left out the vanilla and substituted maple flavoring instead.  Used it on top of a chocolate sour cream cake.  It was delicious! Very easy frosting to make.

I made the vanilla version of this frosting. It was so amazing! I added approximately 1/2 cup of pre-whipped cream cheese and it gave the frosting so much more flavor. If you are using the frosting to actually decorate, I would suggest refrigerating the frosting for up to 30 minutes, so that it has a thicker consistency and won't be runny. : )

Very easy to make, adequately stiff for piping onto cupcakes.  Following recipe exactly, and it's not overly chocolately.  I'd probably boost the cocoa powder next time.  Also, maybe I was generous on the frosting per cupcake, but it only covered about a dozen cupcakes.  They look great!

I wanted a quick simple frosting for brownies or cookies. I made a few changes due to what I had and personal preference. I halved the recipe and used margarine instead of butter and another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of peanut butter. It helped thicken up the frosting and gave it a nice creamy peanut butter taste. Delicious! I couldn't stop licking the bowl!

This recipe is so simple and so great! I have made this a handful of times and every time I get a perfect consistency, espically for cupcakes! I did cut back on the vanilla just a little bit because I thought it was pretty overpowering, but other than that it is perfect!

This frosting recipe is truly amazing! I made this frosting to top some dark chocolate cupcakes I had made for some people at work, and I got rave reviews. It is definitely hard not to eat the frosting all by itself! I did add a little more cocoa powder for more chocolate flavor, though- delicious! I will never buy frosting from the store again.

This frosting was good overall, but it was rather sweet for us.  We ended up adding a lot more cocoa powder to balance out the sweetness because we thought adding more milk would make it thinner and we wanted a thick frosting.  After that it ended up being great!

I halved this recipe and used margarine that has a butter like consistency. It turned out good. it's really fluffy. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's too sweet. I added lemon extract to suit my taste and it's still sweet, but non the less tastes good and has excellent consistency. It also requires a few handy ingredients. DEFINITELY A KEEPER! :)

I didn't like this recipe on it's own, but my husband did.  I found when I added some almond extract it was greatly improved.

Excellent frosting. It made enough to frost an 8x8 cake. Will be using this recipe on most of my cakes from now on. 7-11-10 Made 1/2 recipe to frost 12 cupcakes today. Made 1/2 chocolate and tinted the other 1/2 purple for my granddaughter.

Wow, I just made this frosting with the cocoa.  It is quick, easy, and delicious.  It is a great basic frosting that is forgiving; too thin? add some powdered sugar, too thick, a few drops of milk.  Great recipe, I'll use this one all the time!  I used half & half instead of milk, it worked great!

Good taste. I did add a little salt so it wouldn't be so sweet. It is kinda hard to spread onto cupcakes tho.

Just made this without the cocoa, with about 2 tablespoons of softened cream cheese and only a bit of the milk as needed.  Beat it until it was fluffy, put into a pastry bag & piped onto cupcakes.  Added some Christmas sprinkles & mini candy cane.  The frosting was perfect and very good!

It's pretty basic and pretty sweet!  Mine was a bit thin but it worked out great as I was just looking to drizzle something on our brownies.  Added a hint of peppermint extract for that Christmas touch.

This was pretty good.  Don't know if I'll make it again, though.  I guess it just didn't have the taste I was looking for.  It tasted like sweet, vanilla-y butter.  If that's what you're looking for then this is the one for you 'cause it's definitely not a bad recipe. =)

I had no trouble at all with this recipe being too thin. I always use real butter and I allow it to sit on the counter while I bake the cake or cupcakes.  Adding the milk a little at a time prevents your frosting from becoming too thin.  I frosted 24 cupcakes and still had a little left over. This is so much better for you than the store bought frosting. All those preservatives and trans fats---YUCK!

I made this frosting with strong coffee instead of the milk and added about 2 1/2 TBSP of cocoa powder and it was a great mocha frosting.  Definitely worth making again.

Great recipe!  I made the chocolate version.  This recipe is great as is, but personal preference - I ended up doubling the amount of cocoa powder.  As a result, I also needed to add an extra Tablespoon of milk to get it to the perfect spreading consistency.  I mixed it with the wire whisk attachment in my stand mixture until it had the texture of whipped frosting.  This is now my go-to chocolate frosting recipe - try this and you will never want to buy canned frosting again!

We have made this recipe tons of times. Instead of the cocoa though, we add koolaid a little at a time until we get the flavor that we want. Tonight we made a lemon cake and used this recipe mixed with strawberry koolaid to make a strawberry lemonade cake. We have made cherry, tropical punch, pineapple, orange, & blue rasberry icing with this. We will keep using this recipe for a long time to come.

I am a vegan so I customized this recipe and it worked beautifully!  I used Earth Balance Spread instead of butter.  And rice milk instead of regular milk.  The frosting came out light and not too sweet and was a huge hit with the many family members who tried it.  I also like that if you want BOTH vanilla and chocolate frosting you can first make the vanilla, use some of that and then add the cocoa accordingly.  Thus, I was able to have cupcakes with chocolate AND vanilla frosting.

This is a fabulous frosting. You HAVE to ignore the butter request for this recipe and use only white vegetable shortening. Trust me, I've used butter/margerine and shortening. And the frosting came out a little grainy and sort of looks like it is separating when made with butter or margerine. But if you make it with shortening it will look and taste like buttercream. Fabulous!

Absolutely fantastic! I was in quite the bind when I tried using a different recipe and it just didn't turn out as planned. Luckily I decided to check out AR and found this one. I figured I'd give it a shot and am very happy with the result. I made the Vanilla and it turned out fantastic!

If making the vanilla version, add cream cheese to make the flavor better!  Other than that, this recipe was exactly what I needed and works great on my cupcakes.

Yummy - added about 1/4 cup cream cheese to it just because it needed to get used up! But very good on the cake!

The other reviews said this was too sweet, and I took that into consideration. I mixed it up as the recipe said and when I tasted it it didn't seem too sweet at all, so I didn't alter it. The final project on my cake was way way way too sweet anyway and I ended up giving it to my family completely. Also, when I put the first layer of frosting on the cake and then put the second layer of cake on, all the frosting in the middle started pouring out and down the sides. The same happened on the top too. So by the time the cake was finished, I had a sugar coated cake with a huge pile of frosting on the side's bottom, and I followed the recipe exactly. I definitely will not make this again, with alterations or not.

Needed a vanilla frosting for a spice cake. This was just what I needed. Based on other suggestions used real butter(no margarine), so real butter it is from now on for this recipe.

Yum!  I usually am not a big frosting fan but this came out great!  I added a pinch of salt and left out the coco since I wanted pale yellow frosting.  Perfect consistency and was right amount for 24 normal size cupcakes.

This turned out well. I needed something basic to go between Big Soft Ginger Cookies for sandwich cookies. This worked great. (I halved this recipe and omitted the chocolate powder.)

I'm not big fan of frostings as I find that they are usually TOO sweet. This frosting is really GOOD. I am very happy to have finally found one that I like!  It's a keeper. Thank You!!

This will be my frosting recipe from now on!  So good and not too sweet at all.  I used 1 1/2 tbs. of heavy whipping cream instead of milk, but followed the rest exactly including cocoa powder.  Nice and thick and creamy.  Easy to pipe onto my cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing this!

Really good.  To avoid the frosting becoming runny add the milk slowly, 1/2 tsp at a time until you get desired consistency.  Perfection.

Whoa! Sugar!  This was way too sweet to use & didn't make enough to frost a 9 x 13 cake.  I modified it to the following & it made enough, tamed the sweetness, & turned it more white also.  Add the following:  1 cup of shortening, an additional 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and 2T more of milk.

Great icing! This turned out light and fluffy. I used the cocoa for a chocolate frosting. I used margarine instead of butter. It only iced the top of a 9x13 cake though, and not thickly at that, so if you are making a layer cake, you'll need a lot more. I made this a second time as vanilla and it wasn't as good as the chocolate flavor at all. It tasted powdery and very sweet that way.

This frosting works out awesome. It is the right consistency and it tastes perfect. Although, I did add a tsp of almond flavoring to it because that is what my grandma always did with her frosting. It adds a little more flavor to it!

Pretty good for a quick frosting.  A bit on the sweet side though and I had to add more milk cause it was too thick to ice the cake with. 

I'd make it again.

Perfect combinations... I'm not very good at measuring butter, so my concoction was extremely dry/crumbly at first.  I just added an extra Tbsp. or so of milk and it all blended together perfectly.  Will use this as my standard from now on!

Great, thick frosting! I made the recipe as written using the cocoa. When eaten on its own it is just slightly too buttery and sweet but it is perfectly balanced when put on the cake. I only got about 1 1/2 cups of frosting though, not 3 cups. Great!

This was really good for icing sugar cookies.  It was really thin so I had to add more sugar which made it a little sweeter than I would have liked, but still very tasty.

Absolutely sensational frosting! Dresses up any of the lighter dough recipes without being an overbearing chocolate and destroying the original flavor of what is being frosted. My "go to" frosting.

5 stars is not enough for this recipe.  It should be 10 stars!  I haven't made it using the cocoa yet, but the vanilla frosting is wonderful! I used it to frost a cake and for cupcakes.  Tomorrow I am going to use it to frost sugar cookies.  This is the best frosting recipe I have found yet!

This recipe had good texture and thickness if you do things right. I froze the bowl and beated the frsoting to a cream when making it, the frosting was really buttery tho (and im truthfully a butter lover!!) so i would sugget half shortening. it also DID not make 3 cups.. maybe 1/2 to 1 cup so remmebr that when your making it and double the recipe if your in a rush!!

Nice fluffy frosting but watch out, it's quite sweet.  Start tasting it around 1 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and add small increments after that until your taste.  I just used vanilla style, if you add the cocoa powder, it may cut down the sweetness but be wary.

Good cupcake icing. I added 1/4 tsp almond extract because I like that flavor.

My 10 yo daughter picked out this recipe and it's a keeper!  We didn't need very much frosting, so we used 1 c powdered sugar, 3/4 stick of butter, 2 T cocoa powder and 1 tsp vanilla, then added enough milk to make it creamy.  Whipped it well with the kitchen aid.  Yum!  Very rich, not too sweet, very chocolaty.

This frosting was good - but I would suggest adding a little less sugar - it was too sweet and when I tried to cut the sweetness as the recipe suggested w/ more mile, it made it too thin.
Next time I will add 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 T of milk.

My batch definitely didn't yield 3 cups, but still tasted delicious!  Specify that to CREAM butter, it must be SOFTENED(as we inexperienced cooks may not know)!  Learned that the hard way--end result was well, well worth it, though.  Thanks for a keeper! *-V.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have any milk and I too used coffee creamer (French Vanilla). I was a little skeptical at first but it turned out great. It was very fluffy. I only added 1 tablespoon of the creamer. I think that might be the key between the fluffy vs pudding consistency; use less liquid for fluffy. When I was making it, there didn't seem to be enough of it, but I used it to frost about 24 cookies generously, more than I thought. I also used green food coloring. This is a good basic, sweet frosting recipe.

Excellent recipe. I too, needed a frosting for cookies but instead of vanilla and milk for liquids, I used orange extract and orange juice and it turned out excellent.

Super quick and easy! I opted for the chocolate flavour. I used 3 tbs of cacao powder. And for milk, I used 2 tbs of almond milk. The almond milk didn’t seem to make it creamy enough so I added an additional 2 tbs of 5% cream and it turned out amazing!!! So creamy!!

I did use a half cup of cream cheese like one reviewer suggested and it turned out perfect. I used unsalted butter and I didn't need the salt to cut down on the sweetness when I added the cream cheese. Delicious recipe. It covered an entire 9"×13" cake with enough leftover to make some muffins or donuts with a drizzle.

I have always used canned frosting because I didn't think it was worth the trouble to make homemade.  Wrong!  I don't think I will ever use canned again.  This was so easy and so much better.  My husband does not care for dark chocolate  .  This was chocolate flavor without the bitter taste.  The  four star rating was because it was a little too sweet.  Love it.

Made this frosting for cupcakes and it came out great.  There was plenty of it for 36 cupcakes and it spread easily and tasted great. unlike other reviewers, I did not think it overly sugary and that is something I would normally object to.  That said, trimming the sugar would not hurt I don't think.

Very good as is, but on the sweet side.  To bump it to 5 stars, I used half Crisco shortening and half SALTED butter, added a pinch more salt and doubled the cocoa.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and oh mah gah... it is perfect! Made this to frost a butter recipe yellow cake for a family get-together and everyone raved about it. The small amount of cocoa powder gave a subtle chocolate taste that I prefer. My new go-to!

tasted ok, very very sweet but I added a little salt to cut the sweetness some and it turned out alright. I put the frosting in the fridge to chill so that it would thicken a little and that helped a lot with the consistency of the frosting. I also used a whisk attachment for when I mixed everything together which also helped. Overall, it was pretty decent frosting.

I made no changes to this frosting and the consistency was lumpy and extremely runny. i put it into an icing bag and it just ran through the tip. I was very disappointed with this recipe.

Piped this on cupcakes.  It only covered 9.  it was a buttery and sweet frosting.  Added the cocoa so it had a nice chocolate flavoring.  Not a bad light chocolate frosting recipe.

I cut this recipe in half as I only had 12 cupcakes to frost.  I didn't need to add any milk as the vanilla made it wet enough.
I will definitely use this recipe again!

This frosting is phenomenal! I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't need quite as much milk as the recipe states to get the consistency I wanted. I included the cocoa and it was perfect for the rich chocolate/peanut butter cake I'd made. I tend to have trouble with frosting either being runny or dry, but this was perfect. I received many compliments on it and will be making it again.

I loved this frosting it was perfect, although I would double the recipe if you were making a cake or more than 15 cupcakes. The frosting was great for complex designs and tasted wonderful.

Light, fluffy, and not too sweet. My eight-year-old granddaughter said it tasted like chocolate ice cream but not cold. Was perfect for my chocolate cake!! I did add about 1/3 cup cocoa instead of the smaller amount in recipe. I will definitely keep this recipe and use again.

I don't buy premade frosting because I don't do high fructose corn syrup and it's in ALL frosting! I didn't have unsweetened cocoa so I used a some Ghiradella hot cocoa powder and I also used it to sprinkle the pan with as well! 
I melted half of a Hershey bar with the butter and whipped in into the sugar. Than I added half and half instead of milk. 
It came out so creamy and delicious! My 5 yr old son helped me make it and when he tasted it he said "Momma it taste so good like real frosting"!

This recipe is great, and if you don't have butter don't worry! It's yummy without it too.

WAY TOO SWEET! I used a mixer after creaming the butter, sugar and vanilla by hand and it thickened up nicely while adding the liquid. I also used creamer instead of milk, and just added a little at a time until I liked the consistency.

I think this frosting was exactly what I was looking for! I made it with salted butter, and it wasn't too sweet for my family. Quick and simple. And This was my first time making my own frosting! With this recipe I was only able to frost 15 cupcakes using a Wilton 1m tip.

Excellent! My 11 year old daughter just made this and it's perfect. We used coconut milk (from carton, not canned) and it's super-creamy. Thanks!

super fast and easy to make. I added a little salt as recommended by other reviewers to offset the sweetness since I wasn't using cocoa powder and it worked well.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written. Beat the butter/sugar till light and fluffy..... It's amazing... What makes it so great is there is just enough icing for a nice layer on a 9x13 without being thick and heavy.... This is definitely the lightest fluffy frosting I've ever made..... I've already added it to my recipe box!!! Thank for the great recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe it's easy and perfect to make for any cake! What I did for a substitute was added evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it came out really well. So if you just ran out of milk you can use evaporated! Hope this helps you out a little! I loved this and I know you will love it too.

I think I did something wrong, because my frosting did not turn out right at all. I followed the directions for the vanilla frosting, but it turned out looking a little bit like baby formula. I think what I probably did wrong was put a little too much milk in it, because I had added that little extra half tablespoon of it to the frosting so it wouldn't be so sweet. It tastes good, but doesn't look so good.

Considering the fact that this recipe requires so few ingredients and virtually no time, it's pretty darn good.  It is ULTRA sweet!  Adding the extra tablespoon of cocoa powder does level out the sweetness, but it's still pretty sweet.  The texture is fine.  It is very similar to one you would find in the grocery store.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the cocoa version, but took followed another reviewer's suggestion and substituted one cup of the water with one cup of hot coffee. It came out light brown in color and "fluffy".  Would be OK to dip strawberries in (as a dip not a coating), but didn't make me say YUM as a cake frosting.  I recently moved and have yet to unpack my favorite recipes, so I'll continue to search for antother frosting recipe until I can find that box!!!

Oh my goodness- this frosting is the best ever! It barely made it on the cake, as I had to stop myself from eating it by the spoonful! It got rave reviews. Thanks for the only frosting recipe I will ever use! (One tablespoon milk was perfect.)

Just made this for a 9x13 yellow cake I had baked.  Read a lot of the reviews and so upped the cocoa to 3 T, use 1 T cream cheese, for the milk used 1/2 n 1/2. Since I was adding the cream cheese I used 3/4 butter (not oleo). Could not ask for a better frosting, easy to spread, just right amount to frost my cake.  I've saved to my recipe box for future use.

Made the vanilla version for a white cake.  I tripled the recipe for 2 boxes of cake mix.... Should have made 4x the original recipe.  It's good frosting and easy but just not outstanding.  Perfect for frosting a tiered cake and making cupcakes look great.

Very good recipe as is.  I thought the chocolate flavor was a bit on the light side so I doubled the cocoa and milk.  Not too dark and not too light, just right.  I mixed for about 4 minutes, until the color changes from dark to light.  2 notes: 1.  Sift the cocoa and sugar together and the frosting will be super duper smooth.  2.  Add just a pinch of salt if you are using UNSALTED butter.  Salt enhances the chocolate flavor.  There's my 2 cents!

I agree with another reviewer that this does not make 3 cups.  It barely covered the top of one 9" round cake.  Still, it's very good.  It does come out extremely soft and spreadable.  If you're putting plastic decorations atop the cake, they will sink down into this very malleable frosting.

Used this icing for my nieces 4th birthday party cake.  Everyone raved about the icing on how good it was.  I have used many icings before and I didn't find it to be too sweet .  My only complaint is that it doesn't make enough to decorate a cake, it's great if you are doing cupcakes.  it was so simple to make too thanks for a great recipe

This was excessively sweet. I added about 1/8 tsp of almond extract, to cut the intense sweetness a bit and add some more flavor. Delicious.

This is the only sugar cookie frosting recipe I use.  I don't care for it with cocoa so I make it without and add food coloring for whichever holiday I'm baking for.  I use this with the Sugar Cookie Cutout recipe on this site.

Reminds me of my mom's frosting...I wasn't sure how to "cream" everything together so I just went at it with a fork. We iced cupcakes with the frosting and it was perfect, not too sweet and no sugary aftertaste. This recipe has earned a place in my recipe box.

This frosting was okay, mine looked like a mousse, and the taste was a little off, that was probably my fault because i used instant cocoa.

Amazing recipe!  Perfect consistency for cupcake frosting.   I did not add the chocolate and thought the taste was wonderful.   It is sweet, but that is how I like my frosting.

This frosting worked perfectly for the  Sweet Vanilla cupcakes. I made them with the cocoa and they were delicious! Very quick and easy and just the right amount for cupcakes or brownies. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

This was an amazing frosting to make and it tasted soooo good. I did the chocolate version too. I added about 4 Tbsps. of cocoa. One thing I loved about using the cocoa was the low calories. One recipe I used called for 6 oz of baking chocolate...70 calories in just one oz!  Loved the fosting...so so good! Thank you  :)

Wow! This recipe is simple, very easy to prepare & can be made quickly. To frost two 8 inch round cake layers I doubled the recipe & had just enough! I will be using this recipe often in the future.

Excellent!! I just made this for my four year old's son birthday cake. I tinted it blue. I had to quadruple the ingredients but then I had more then enough to cover an 11x15 in cake....I definitely recommend this recipe and will be using it often myself.

Very easy, and tasty.  I paired this up with the strawberry cupcake recipes (also from this site) and added about a tsp. of strawberry extract from this site to stay with the strawberry flavor.  Delicious!

Delicious, However if making the vanilla version to frost a 9' cake I would recommend doubling the recipe. I used the full amount of milk and added a single egg yolk which gave the frosting a creamier consistency and thus a neater presentation, nut the original is still fabulous.

Simple and quick frosting. Used maple syrup instead of milk and got a nice caramel flavor at first. Then I was playing around with food coloring and didn´t like the final color, so I added the cocoa powder and made it into chocolate frosting. Thank goodness for flexible recipes.

Wonderful! I made sure to use room-temperature (not melted) butter, added just a little extra milk, plus a dash of salt (as another reviewer suggested) in order to balance out the sweetness, and it turned out great! Thank you for this recipe! I will be using it again. :)

Id give this 10 stars if I could! I used 3 tbsp of cocoa instead of two, but other than that I made no changes. It tasted just like brownie batter to me, I loved it. And I don't think it was too sweet, it had the perfect sweetness for frosting which is meant to be sweet!

The most idiot-proof recipe I've ever made from this site.  You make this in no time flat.  Tastes exactly like the stuff you buy in the store.  I don't know if that's a good or bad thing - but I know it did taste pretty darn good!  I needed this to dirty-ice a cake before I stick fondant on it.  Worked well.  Tasted good - easy to make - this was a clear winner and will now be my go-to icing recipe.

CAUTION-**TOO SWEET WITHOUT CHOCOLATE ADDED**!!! I made this and iced a chocolate cake, I was looking for a buttercream frosting taste, but really it just tasted like powdered sugar.  I added a bit more vanilla, but that just made it sweeter.  I would have added more butter, but I had none left so I couldn't.  I ended up using a very very thin layer on the cake, and it was still way too sweet for our taste. (and I love sweet things! but could only eat a tiny bit of this icing)

I thought this was just fine. I was out of cream cheese for my cream cheese frosting, but this worked great on my cinnamon rolls. I did add a splash of extra milk and I did not add any cocoa powder. Super easy ~ had it done in about 30 seconds.

tastes yummy!    added an extra TBLS of cocoa powder and substituted some cold coffee for some of the milk.  recipe does NOT make 3cups of frosting just like everyone says.  this takes no time at all to make!    it is worth having to wash a bowl and beaters.     btw, here are the ingredients of a store bought frosting (expiration date of nov2010):  sugar, water, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, cocoa processed with alkali, palm oil, cornstarch and 2% or less of 10 other things!

This is exactly how frosting is supposed to taste.  The key is to use real butter and real vanilla extract - none of those artificial substitutes.  For those who complain about how sweet it is, I think the problem is that they are used to the canned version made with corn syrup and .  Real frosting is this simple and this sweet.

This frosting is excellent.  Simple, and tastes great.  I used extra vanilla for a more potent flavor.  Unlike others, the texture worked for me very well!

It is absolutely right that you need to add the bakking cocoa for this frosting not to taste as sweet. I added 3 tbsp. of cocoa instead of the 2 and I also added an extra tbsp. of milk because it was far to thick. This recipe also doesnt make very much so I had to double it. I thought it tasted a lot like buttercream because of the rich buttery taste. There isnt anything I would change about it.

It takes absolutely forever to cream the butter and sugar together by hand, but it is well worth the time and effort.  This is fantastic sugar cookie frosting!  I'm definitely hanging onto this recipe for next year's holiday baking.

Perfection! I was doing a 4 layer cherry chocolate cake and tripled this recipe. I also added a hefty spoonful of cream cheese and used caramel extract instead of vanilla. This officially rivals the store bought stuff that I love so much but can't eat!

This frosting saved my cookies.  I chose a dry, bland cookie recipe, but the frosting made them more than edible.   I forgot the milk, but it still spread real well.  I also left out the chocolate & tinted ligt purple.   Oh, and use real butter, no margarine!!  Huge differance.

UPDATE: THIS IS MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY. I STILL DON'T CARE FOR THIS FROSTING'S BUTTERY TASTE/TEXTURE, BUT SAW A MCH NEEDED, DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT DAYS LATER. I MAY EVEN CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT MAKING THIS AGAIN. :-) This was OK. I guess I am just "addicted" (and used to...) the super sugary-sweet store frosting lol! I found this to have a very buttery taste and to be only mildly sweet. My fiance thought it was very similar to bakery-made frosting (go figure!). Made a double batch, using real (unsalted) butter and Madagascar vanilla for optimal results (no cocoa for me - I wanted vanilla frosting). My Kitchen-Aid mixer made prep a breeze (I added about 1.5 T milk with great results - consistency was perfect and frosting 'set' nicely). I used almost the entire batch to frost a double-layer chocolate cake (One Bowl Chocolate Cake by shirelyo, also on this site). Note: You must DEFINITELY double this if you plan to frost a multiple layer cake or more than 12 cupcakes; as is, this is enough to frost one 9 x 13 inch cake at most!!! Although this was decent, I think I will continue my search for the "perfect" frosting. Thanks anyways!

I didn't use the milk or the cocoa powder, it didn't need it. I did find it melted quickly as I live in a tropical climate. So I would suggest to put it in the fridge for an hr or so to solidify it some more. It's delicious, sweet, and a nice color.

Very tasty, but it was very hard for me at first to get over how it is all butter and sugar...I followed the recipe exactly and it worked and my kids loved it.  I used it for sugar cookies, but it would probably work better on a cake or cupcakes.

I made this frosting when I realzied that I didn't have any frosting for a cake I had just baked. I added a little bit of lemon flavoring oil. At first after I made it the mix was really runny. I tried adding more confectioners' sugar but it never thickened. I followed everything like it said (besides the lemon flavoring) so I'm not sure why it didn't thicken. It turned out more like a glaze than a frosting.

Hi, I was making a Jeepers Creepers Halloween cake and wanted to try to make a whitish vanilla frosting from scratch instead of from a can (to dye green, of course!).  I think this is a good basic vanilla frosting with a good consistency.  I doubled the recipe, which then yields about 2 3/4 cups of frosting, or close to 24 oz., which is about the same amount of frosting as 1 1/2 (16 oz.) cans of commercially prepared frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced half (1 stick; remember, I doubled the recipe) of the salted real butter with a stick of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (NOT the tub margarine - it has too high of a water content!).  I think it came out very good for what it is, even though usually I don't like anything that's not chocolate!

The consistency is perfect for decorating as long as you beat it long enough... if you follow the recipe (exactly) you shouldn't have any problems.  I haven't made the chocolate yet, just the vanilla.  The taste is also really good!  I highly recommend this for a quick, easy & tasty frosting.  (Note: The quantity is very small, only enough for about 12x muffins or so)

DELISH! So easy to make. I used a pastry bag and was able to decorate a dozen cupcapakes. I omitted the cocoa and added 3 drops of red food coloring for the prettiest pink frosting ever. So pretty...thanks so much! Definitely use BUTTER.

This is my favorite frosting! I made the vanilla the first time and was blown-away. The second time I made the chocolate (adding 3 T cocoa) and although it was good, I wasn't as impressed with the texture. I wonder if the butter was too soft. The flavor was perfect though. This is a nice recipe to play around with. You can add imitation flavors to it to switch it up like rum, mint, orange, lemon, strawberry. Just some ideas!

Fabulous! It was a great consistency and nice and sweet but not too sweet like those cheap frosted cakes you buy at a grocery store....a definite keeper! The key is to slowly add the milk and do not switch to margarine..use butter!!

This was so simple to make and was delicious!  Very sweet! It didn't yield quite was much as i would have wanted, but for the cupcakes I was frosting it was just right.  If was frosting a cake, I might consider doubling the recipe.  I tried the vanilla version, I can't wait to try the chocolate :D

Delicious!!! I used margarine, worked fine, and added extra vanilla, I also had to use more sugar, about a cup more, to sweeten it up. I give 5 stars because I didn't use butter, thus I feel its my fault i had to alter it. ;)

Would've given it a 0 if possible. Made both ways, the vanilla way was MUCH to rich and the chocolate way was almost as bad except you taste some chocolate instead of just confectioners sugar. I'm afraid to put it on my cake, it would taste better bland than with this icing on it.

This frosting is sooooooooooo good.  My 3 kids have dairy, egg, nut, and soy allergies among them so we need recipes without these ingredients.  With this one, we substituted soy-free/dairy-free butter and used Rice Milk.  It was so delicious and creamy we can't wait to try again!

I used this recipe to make vanilla frosting about a week ago to ice a chocolate cake.  I was not impressed by it at all -- texture and flavor, something just seemed "off."  Then, this morning, I had about fifteen minutes to frost some cupcakes I made last night.  I did not have time to search for a different recipe -- I just went to this one again.  Except, this time, I made the chocolate version.  Three words:  OH MY GOD.  The flavor was to die for.  If you're frosting a two layer cake, you'll probably need to make extra, as I just barely got enough for a single batch of cupcakes.  Three stars for the vanilla, five for the chocolate, so this gets four stars.  P.S.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Way to sweet and not thick enough for my liking. Also a funny colour - like a white-beigeish. Won't use again.

This tasted yummy!  It did not thicken up enough for my satisfaction.  However another user pointed out that real butter is thicker than margarine.  I will try this recipe again with real butter because I loved the taste.

I just finished making this (with butter) and while it is thinner then some icing, it wasn't to thin. It didn't make as much as I hoped, but it's very easy, and uses ingredients my family always has in the house! I added some salt so it wasn't as sugary!

I used the chocolate version of this recipe to frost an 8-in two layer cake and it turned out just right.  I kept it in the fridge while the cake cooled and then zapped it in the microwave for just a few seconds at 50% and it spread perfectly.  This is a super easy, super yummy recipe.  It was enough for the whole cake, but if you like to use a lot for the filling you'll probably need to make extra.

Great frosting with loads of options for different flavors. I used a rum extract instead of vanilla and it was delish. I did need to double it as it wasn't enough for a 2 layer cake.

I've made this twice.  Once as written and once adding a dollop of cream cheese to cut the sweetness (I think that sour cream would work too). Both are good but I prefer the less sweet version.  I'll also cut the extract to 1/2 t since I seem to be able to taste it.  Thanks!

It's a good recipe, it's simple and it tastes good. I made 24 cupcakes and it only frosted about 10. So it definitely needs to be doubled or tripled to be on the safe side. I also added raspberry flavoring to the vanilla version, cuts the butter flavor a bit. No trouble with the consistency either.

Perfect as-is!  I omitted the chocolate because I was making white cupcakes.  It turned out perfectly smooth and creamy with a fabulous taste...not too sweet at all!  I doubled the recipe and was able to pipe 24 cupcakes generously.

I made this recipe exactly as it is posted, except I added a tiny pinch of salt to help with sweetness, as I was not using cocoa, as suggested by another reviwer. I don't know if it was my brain playing tricks on me or what, but when I ate it, it was just nasty. I felt the greasy butter in my mouth. Not to say that I don't like fattening treats once in a while, (probably more often than I should!) but I don't like them to taste like butter when I eat them.

I tweaked this recipe using the 1/2 cup cream cheese one of the other reviewers had suggested.  That being said, the consistency of my frosting was perfect! As for the taste, well, it was good!  i can't say it's as good as some other frostings i have had.  I kind of reminds me of german chocolate.

Oh my gosh! This frosting is delicious and so easy! I did make 2 adjustments; I followed the recipe but used salted butter and half and half instead of milk. Some of the reviews have said how sweet the frosting is, but I think using the salted butter may have balanced it for me.  The half and half possibly made it creamier, I can't be certain since I tweaked the original recipe. But this is definitely going to be my mainstay frosting from now on. Yummy!

This is my favorite frosting recipe from this site!  I opted for the chocolate version and since I wanted to frost a 2-layer cake, I made 1 and a half times the recipe (perfect amount).  Perfect texture... thanks for the recipe.

This was sooo good.  I have been looking for a vanilla frosting for my daughters b-day cake and this is the winner.  I just made it as a trial batch and it was so good I think I have a tummy ache from eating to much.  I followed your ingredients, but mixed them up my own way.  I first took the butter and beat it (w/ electric mixer) until fluffy then added 1 cup powdered sugar, and beat til fluffy, added the next cup of sugar, beat til fluffy.  Then I added the vanilla and milk and beat til fluffy again.  Tasted and decided to add just a pinch of salt, beat it again and that did it.  I may try the recipe again using the cocoa, but am really happy with what I have so far. My one complaint is that it is slightly buttery, I'll have to work on that.

Great Frosting recipe and it was just enough to frost the 9 inch cake I made.  I did follow the advice given in the reviews and had to add a tablespoon of cream cheese to cut down the sweetness.  But this is much better than store bought frosting.  Definitely will use again.

This recipe is great in a pinch! I was looking to frost some cookies really quick-like, and was so thankful to come across this. Will definitely use in the future. Easy, simple frosting. Used about 2tbsp of milk, gave it just the right consistency. :]

Very good! I used earth's balance - non-hydrogenated fat margerine. I red other reviews that claim margerine has a higher water content that butter. I used more confectioners sugar and I added some corn syrup to the frosting as well - so it weould stay in the star-shaped twirl I made ontop of "Amaretto Cake" cupcakes from this site.

I've been making the chocolate version of this. I follow the instructions exactly and it comes out marvelous! Lately rather than cocoa powder I've been melting semi-sweet choc.chips for the chocolate and it tastes excellent too. I frost this on the One Bowl Chocolate cake III recipe I found on this site.

Easy recipe but it didn't yield much...had to double the recipe.  It was also EXTREMELY sweet...I would cut back on sugar next time...though I will say that it tasted not as sweet the next day after having been refrigerated...will try again but w/some tweaks here and there.

Used this for my daughter's birthday cake, with 1 tsp cherry extract, in addition to the vanilla, and also hot pink food coloring! It was so easy my 7 and 8 yr olds helped make it, and although it was quite sweet, was fluffy and delicious! She declared it the "yummiest cake ever!".

ok, I read the reviews and the big debate here seems to be wheather this is too sweet or not. Alot of people said that the vanilla was too sweet, but not the chocolate. I figured that it's all just personal preferance and went ahead and made the chocolate version. I love sweet stuff, but this was so sweet it almost made my teeth ache! WOW! I didn't want to waste it, so I threw in a couple of chunks of cream cheese and and blended it in with a hand mixer. It blended up nice and fluffy and not so sweet. It tasted great! It is 3 stars, tops, as written, but 5 with the addition of the cream cheese. Can't wait to eat the cake I frosted with it.

I just made a cake for my brother's birthday, and it was extremely light and fluffy. I needed a frosting that was light enough that it wouldn't weigh the cake down into nothing-ness and this one worked well enough. I substituted evaporated milk for regular milk to keep with the sweetness because the cake had a light taste as well.  I tasted it BEFORE I made any changes and thought it was delicious. Unfortunately, it does not make enough to cover a cake of 2 9in round pans so I was going to have to double it... and ran out of powdered sugar, so I added cream cheese, whipped cream, and white sugar to make a very different frosting that worked awesome. If you want an icing that is for a lighter cake, add a few heaping spoonfuls of Cool Whip to fluff it up a lot! =]

Really good flavour, and not over powering. Really easy to make and adjust to your own needs. I followed the recipe and then just added more powdered sugar/milk as necessary to make the amount I needed.

This frosting will not set!! It tastes delicious, but it's so runny! I've beaten and beaten, and added more powdered sugar. Something isn't right!

I needed frosting in a pinch and found this one. I followed the directions and it worked well. It was a bit runny at first, but it did set up nice when I let it sit for a minute.

I just made this and it tastes wonderful! It makes enough to put a thin coat on two 9 inch round cakes, with some in the middle. It hasn't set up yet so I'm not sure how it does but it's fluffy and good so far!

This is exactly like the frosting my mom used to make on her cakes. Homemade frosting is so much better than storebought, and everyone that tasted this agrees.

This turned out really good for me. I made the chocolate version.  I kept sifting the dry ingredients until it turned a uniform color.   I then blended until all the ingredients mixed together and formed one lump.  Then I added half and half instead of milk.  Turned it creamy.  I would definately use again. I liked it cause it didn't take a lot of ingredients, or a lot of work.

Very easy, very sweet, not much flavor with the vanilla however.  It wasnt greasy and it wasnt runny.  It was fluffy and frosted the cupcakes beautifully.  I think this is a good base recipe for other flavors.  Will def use this recipe again :)

I made this icing to frost cupcakes for my 2 yr. old nephews birthday and everyone loved the icing.  It is so hard to find a good vanilla icing recipe...especially one my husband will eat but this tasted amazing.  I used light margarine instead of butter and the consistency was still pretty good.  With the leftover icing I added some cocoa powder and diluted a bit of coffee granuals is some water to make the chocolate frosting which I refrigerated and used for a chocolate cake a few days later, delicious

My family loved this recipe. Just the vanilla turns out pretty sweet but when you add the cocoa, its perfect! Also this recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups, double it for the 3 cups.

I was skeptical, but I wanted a fast frosting, so I tried it. I used "Can't believe it's not Butter" and it still turned out great! Tastes like a more fatty frosting! Great easy recipe!

I didn't have any softened butter, so I substituted shortening for butter. I also added 1/2 cup cream cheese as suggested by another reviewer.  The frosting turned out great.  Better than store-bought frosting!  I used it to frost cinnamon rolls (Made from recipe "Cinnamon Rolls I" on this site).  Yum!

I would give this 3 stars, because it tastes better with the cocoa added to it.  However, by itself, it tastes too buttery, even after adding additional powdered sugar.  I will not use this recipe again though.

This recipe is too sweet, even though I cut the icing sugar down to 1 1/2 c.  So the icing tends to become less thick.  It still holds up fine for my green tea cupcakes.  Instead of the cocoa powder, I added 2 teaspoons of green tea (matcha) powder.

Excellent! I did use the 1/4 crisco-1/4 butter version, it is sooo good! I had enough to frost 15 cupcakes, and my scratch cupcake recipe made 14, so it was perfect. I tried it without the cocoa and it was still good, but decided on using cocoa for my vanilla cupcakes. It was easy, quick and delicious!

This frosting was great! I made Valentine's Cupcakes! I made 2 runs of this frosting and in the 1st one I used the full amount of buttter, it tasted a little buttery to me so in the next run I used 1/4 cup of butter and substituted Crisco for the other 1/4 cup and it tasted much better to me!

I just made this frosting for Valentine's cookies for my son's class at school.  It made the perfect amount!  I thought it whipped up quite well, and tasted pretty good, too. I hate runny icing, so this held up well in a pastry bag with a decorator tip.  Thanks!

I gave this only 3 stars because the taste was very sweet (even with extra milk added)and slightly gritty even though I mixed it with a electric hand mixer. The spreadability was very good. I tasted the frosting at first without adding the cocoa and it was very good although sweet. I actually prefer it over the chocolate. That says a lot for a chocoholic such as myself. Added 3 TBS of unsweetened cocoa for a more defined chocolate taste. Would make again but only use 1.5 cups of sugar. It easly made enough for 24 cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe.

Really awesome frosting! Made two batches of it for my cake. The second one I made was a little runny, but 2 overloading tablespoons of cocoa powder sucked it up. NOt Bad for a first time frosting maker for me. and it made it taste good too! Great Recepie.

Amazing! Very light and fluffy!  I added an additional tsp. of vanilla and a few more spoonfuls of powdered sugar.  I didn't even bother measuring the milk - I just eyed it until it was the right consistancy!

Tastes really delicious.  Best homemade vanilla frosting recipe I've ever tried.  I used butter, not margarine, and it was still kind of runny.

Frosting has a great taste to it. I added a few extra drops of vanilla extract and a little extra sugar(couple of tablespoons). I would make this again.

A good vanilla frosting recipe and I plan on making it again.  Mine turned out a little thin so I added some extra powdered sugar and that helped.

This recipe had way too much butter for my liking. I added like 2 or 3 times the amount of the other ingredients to even it out.

This really works well and it's a great base if you desire to use other flavorings like lemon or orange- but less butter, that would be my only recommendation. If you need more liquid use a little bit of water to make the difference- that's what I did.  I just found the butter to be a little overpowering.

I made it without the chocolate, and it was some of the best frosting I've ever had. Simple, yet soooo delicious.

Just like everyone before me says just perfection. I loved the way it dried enough that you can stack them but not hard.

pretty sweet - but I love that!  I used coffee cream instead of milk - made it nice and fluffy.

This is really good. I made the mistake of trying to make only enough frosting for one cookie the first time.  I made the frosting, adding some blue food coloring, and then put it in a sandwich bag and wrote letters on some cookies for friends at school. I will make this more next time.  This was Great!
