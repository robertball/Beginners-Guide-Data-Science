I would add more butter because I’ve tasted arepas cooked by a Colombian woman and they tasted buttery, but it’s personal preference

These are delicious. We ate ours with salsa and queso fresco and it was amazing.

I'd suggest cooking with actual oil, rather than cooking spray. It crisps up the edges and adds a nuance to the flavors. (I made half with cooking spray, half with olive oil.)
