FANTASTIC! These are addictive. They were very easy to make. I'm not sure why some reviewers had problems with the filling oozing out. Chill the filling for about 1 hour before using and, as the instructions state, SPREAD the filling over the dough triangle - don't just place a spoonful at the widest part and try to roll it up over that - spread it out over the triangle to within about 1/4 inch from the edge (I used 1 heaping measuring teaspoon of filling for each). Then roll very loosely. I drizzled melted white chocolate over these after they had cooled. I made these the night before for a party. They are delicious warm from the oven, AND are still yummy served at room temp the next day (wrapped them in plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight - took them out of the fridge about 2 hours before serving) So delicious & easy - a hit at the party I took them to. Thanks! P.S. The recipe makes A LOT of filling - I used 8 cans of crescent dough and still hade plenty of filling left (could easily fill 10 - 12 cans of crescents)

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner this year. I wanted to try something different this year to make for the little kids and they loved them. It will make a difference if you spread the filling out on the dough instead of in one spot so that it doesn't spill out. I also had the problem of having quite a bit of the filling left over so I made a pie out of it. It had a wonderful texture and taste.  I think the cream cheese did the trick. I will try this again mext year since the kids liked it so much.

This easy fall recipe was a big hit at my children's preschool fall festival.  Many moms and teachers asked for the recipe.  I left the nuts out since it was for kids but think they would be good in it.  I made 80 rolls and still had filling left, I did use much less filling on each roll than what the recipe called for.  I too sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon before cooking.  I will definately make again!

I also did not use the pecans, but will next time.  This recipe is so delicious that I made these twice this weekend.  The measurements need reworking, however, because I made only 1/4 of the recipe and made 32 rolls!

Not very good.  I thought the filling wasn't a good complement to the cresent rolls.  I love pumpkin, but I will not make them again.

I took this to a Thanksgiving get together and had several people ask for the recipe.  They are great once you get the assembly down.  I followed the review that said to use a heaping teaspoon of the filling and then actually spread it over the crescent roll.  Then roll very loosely.  Once the filling cooks, it will harden a little, and won't spill out the sides.  This is a great, easy recipe!

One word...messy! I even did as other reviews suggested and chilled the filling first and spread it down the crescent roll. I also had enough filling left over I could have made 2 pies! Filling was tasty but I won't make these again.

Not that Great! These were a mess to make! Hardly any flavor not sweet or pumpkin or cinnamon--every flavor gets lost in this roll--nothing stands out! The recipe makes way too much filling--what a waste! Won't make again!

Everyone loved these and they are soooooo easy. I'm already handing out copies of the recipe.  It makes a ton of the pumpkin mixture.  I've used 6 pkgs. of rolls and still have some left.  Thanks for share such a great recipe.

Very tasty and even good the next day. The mixture makes a TON. You could feed an army with the mixture. You truely only need a tablespoon of the mixture to be spread on the cresent roll. Will make again.

Made this for a Thanksgiving brunch and they were a big hit. Very easy to make. I rolled the crescent rolls very gently and loosly so the filling wouldn't ooze out. Very  pretty, tasy rolls!

I made these for my husband's Thanksgiving potluck lunch at work, and they were a major hit! Even the cafe chefs loved them! They were easy to make - a refreshing twist on crescent rolls, especially during the holidays.

Labor intensive if you make them alone.  I always buy two pie shells and make two pies the day after Thanksgiving with the left over filling.  The filling makes a great pie.  This is a Thanksgiving must have for me and my family!

These did taste yummy. However, the amount of filling is soooo much that you should only make them if you are taking them to a large event.

Question:

Could you make your own pie dough and still have them turn out?

I am anxious to try this - they sound so tempting.  I just don't like the crescent rolls.  THANKS.

These turned out to be be really tasty.  My husband was skeptical when I first told him what they were, but after one bite he was hooked.  I did add some additional spices, mainly nutmeg & cloves, and it was a nice flavor.  I would definitely half the amount of filling.  I've got tons left over.

These were attractive to look at, and served the purpose of being a bread at the table, but these were a little too bland for my taste. They could have used more spices, some nutmeg, maybe cinnamon.

I made these for Thanksgiving last year and they turned out fabulous and everyone loved them.  I didn't have any problem with the filling oozing out, but then, I rolled them loosely.  I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar and they were both crisp and flaky.  These really are to die for and you definitely cannot eat just one!!

My family and I thought they tasted pretty good, but they didn't come out as crispy or flaky as I would have liked.  I think it would be a good idea to use the same amount of jumbo rolls instead of the regular size ones.  It would help a lot keep all the filling in.  I would make them again.

I thought these were awful.  No matter how I tried, I couldn't get the filling to not ooze out. I went ahead and baked them and I didn't even think they tasted good.  This one is definately getting thrown out of my recipe box.

I found these rather difficult to make.  The filling squeezed out as I was rolling up the crescents and I had at least half of the filling left over.  The flavor is not bad, but not my favorite, too much cinnamon.
