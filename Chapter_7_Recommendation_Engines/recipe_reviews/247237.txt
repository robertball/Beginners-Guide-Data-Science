This burger is the sum of its delicious parts, starting with the chipotle aioli which I now use on just about everything, the burgers themselves whose spice is perfect, and the toppings that set everything off just right. Thanks Chef V!

Good burger. Next time I will add some spicy smoked sausage sliced thin instead of the bacon for more spice.
