Was not a big hit with my family.  I like the concept of this soup though and will play around with adding different flavors.  Thanks so much for the the post.

I love this soup. My grandmother use to make this soup when I was a kid and it always hit the spot.

Finally found this recipe, it was a popular way to serve fresh green beans when I was growing up.  My Hungarian Grandmother made it often.  Over the years I have tried to make it, but it wasn’t always as good as Grandma’s...this recipe is! Thank you!
