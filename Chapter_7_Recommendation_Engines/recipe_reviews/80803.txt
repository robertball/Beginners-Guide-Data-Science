I love this recipe, and it has become part of my regular recipe rotation.  I use Morningstar Farms Veggie Crumbles in place of the TVP, simply because I couldn't find the TVP.  Everything is is exactly the same- especially the spices and the honey.  I think this recipe hits the spices just perfect!  Also, I brown the onion, garlic, and veggie crumble, add half the spices in a big skillet.  Once that is done, I transfer it to the slow cooker, add the rest of the ingredients, and then let it cook on high for 3-4 hours.  SO EASY!  I always double the recipe, and freeze the rest because it freezes and reheats well for quick mid-week dinners.  THANK YOU for posting this recipe.  It is my favorite!

Awesome!!!  I always drain and rinse my beans and then add liquid later - in this case a bit of chicken stock.  I'm not vegetarian but I'm sure veg stock would work too.  I just don't like the extra salt.  Thanks!

A wonderful recipe over all. Don't be afraid of the cinnamon and honey. I was at first, but it really adds a nice counter to the cayenne pepper. I used Boca Burgers instead of the TVP (2 of them for 6 servings) by sautéing them with the onions and garlic and adding a bit more olive oil. Also this recipe is pretty spicy, so only use 1/2 of the cayenne pepper if you're not into hot food. Topping it with shredded taco cheese and adding some whole grain rice to the mix turns this into a great, hearty meal!

I work in human services at a day program for individuals who have survived brain injury.  They are all very meat oriented.  So, I made this chili with some Boca crumble one day, just to see if anyone would notice.  No one did.  They all LOVED it.  It's now a staple on the Autumn and Winter menu calendars.

This was excellent.  For some reason I had no chili powder so I used a couple tablespoons of chili seasoning and a little extra cumin (and omitted the salt, pepper, and cayenne because the chili seasoning contains them).  I cooked it on low for a couple of hours to cook down some.  Fantastic!  My husband really liked it as well and he was amazed the TVC wasn't ground beef. I'll make a double batch tomorrow for my veggie friends. Thanks for a keeper Paulina!

This was pretty good.  But definitely called for too much garlic, IMO.

my husband is an executive chef, and there's not too much he doesn't always have a few ideas to make something taste better, but this chili HANDS DOWN was something he told me i can make ANY time.  i didn't use the tvp so i only used half of the spices and that was plenty warm enough!  fantastic recipe!

If you aren't afraid of heat then get yourself cooking on this wicked spicy and freaking delicious vegetarian chili.  This recipe is easily worth five stars without a single change.  My seriously carnivorous extended family happily devour bowl after bowl with nary a "rabbit food" crack.  It's that good.  Wicked good, in fact :)

This is the best veggie chili I've ever had.  It has all the right ingredients and can easily be adjusted for taste.  The cinnamon is a nice touch and goes well in the chili.

I substituted a cup of dry great northern beans (which I pressure cooked for about 40 minutes) for the canned beans. I also used fresh tomatoes rather than canned. This recipe came out quite well and I will definitely make it again.

Too tomato-ey.  Did n't really care for.  More of a soup taste than chili.  Sorry.

i've never made veggie chili before and i made this one last week to take to a pot luck at my son's school.  it was a huge hit, there was not a scrap left!  i made a few changes but did not really deviate too far from the recipe - i doubled the recipe, except for the spices based on other reviews.  i did not use cayenne because i figured alot of the kids and parents might not like it, i used yves ground soy, added mushrooms to the saute and, used black beans and kidney beans added two handfuls of frozen corn.  after i sauteed the soy and mushrooms/onions and the spices, i threw it all in the crock pot for three hours.  the carrots were a bit crunchy but it was perfect!  i even took some to the chef where i work and he gave it a two thumbs up!  this will be my new recipe from now on.  thanks to original poster!!

This recipe is unbelievably good.  It has so much flavor, I don't think anyone would miss the meat or even realize it's a vegetarian chili.  I agree that it's quite spicy, but I like it that way.  I only made a half batch to try it out, but I plan to make a double batch next week so that I can freeze some for fast and easy dinners.  On a side note, I was able to make this recipe a lot quicker by rehydrating the tvp in hot water in only 10 min while I prepped and cut veggies and by using my pressure cooker to reduce simmer time to 15 min/5 min instead of 45/15.  Thank you Paulina!

Made this today and it was delicious!  I used veggie crumbles and cut the cayenne in half b/c my parents and sister (the vegetarian) were visiting and don't like too much heat.  Definitely my new fave chili recipe -even over meat varieties!

My first attempt at Veggie Chili and this turned out Wicket good. I made some alterations (mostly on other suggestions), but generally followed the recipe: Only 1 tsp cayenne Elminated carrots & cinnamon- would turn out too sweet Used 1 can light kidney, and 1 can Black Beans Added 1 tsp Oregano to make it more savory  This one is a keeper.. I plan to enter it into my office annual chili contest - wish me luck!

Loved this recipe!  I cut the cayenne in half and used 1 pkg of Morning Star Farms Grillers instead of the TVP, but otherwise this was scrumptious!

i can't cook worth a  (years of soupy chilis that were terrible and bland), and this turned out SO well! I made a few changes:  1. one extra can of red kidney beans, because i love fibre, and red kidney beans 2. used Yves veggie ground round instead of TVP 3. yogurt instead of sour cream  i loved this recipe so much, i became a member of Allrecipes so I could post a 5-star review! Wheeee!

Wicked Good indeed!  

I used a bag of Veggie Crumbles by Morning Star farms and a red pepper instead of green because that is what I had on hand.  I also ommited the cayenne pepper since I was making this for my kids but I think it might still be too spicy for them.  Next time I might divide the chili before I add the spices. 

Next time I might try one can kidney beans and one can garbanzo--just for fun.  :)

I have made this chili twice now.
I absolutely love it!
Made a batch for my husband and a few friends and everyone thought it was fabulous!
I added more garlic, but thats just because we are obsessed with garlic in my house.
Thank you so much!

THE best chili I've ever made. Very simple ingredients, but taste like you wouldn't believe. Simple to make too. I followed recipe almost exactly as written, except I only used 1 tsp. of cheyenne pepper (due to past mistakes). Cinnamon and honey were excellent additions and I really think it made a difference in this recipe. Delicious!

Extreme hit with all diners. I added a couple of handfulls of frozen corn and a little less than a cup of black beans and it looked more colorful and still tasted mah-velous.

Tried the recipe exactly as written.  VERY good, but a little too much heat for me. Next time I'll only use 1 1/2 tsp. of the cayenne, chili powder, and cumin.  Loved the cilantro and green onions chopped on top. Substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream. I would recommend apple cider as the perfect beverage for this meal!

I followed the recipe carefully, substituting only extra beans for TVP and agave for honey. I am very happy the recipe says to add only half the seasoning at first, because otherwise it would be unpalatable. Now, I love spicy food and can practically drink green Tabasco sauce, so I'm not a whimp. What I ended up with was a five alarm chili with very nice flavor. Needless to say, I never added the second dose of cayenne, chilling powder and cumin. This recipe in NOT for children or mixed company. Ill probably try a different recipe next time I make chili, since I really need to make things my kids can eat.

I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes from Muir Glenn that added a really nice flavor to the chili. I don't like thin chili so I just threw everything but the water into a pot and had the TVP cook in the juices from the tomatoes. I thought the heat was just fine, but everyone else thought it was too hot so you may want to decrease the cayenne some.

I was amazed by how good this is! The spices are perfect...(maybe just a little less Cayenne Pepper) but the flavor was just to die for. I had black beans and garbanzo beans so I went half and half on those. I added avocado junks to the condiments. This is so good I'll be making it again and again.

This chili really is wicked good!  I loved the textured vegetable protein- I found it at Whole Foods in the dry good bins (you know, where you have to scoop out stuff yourself).  I used all the honey, but only half the cinnamon and spices.  I also added some more veggies (celery, mushrooms, and zucchini) and more beans (pinto and black bean).  This chili was a hit and I will definitely make it again!

Best  chili by far!!!!  I just added a bit more chili powder and a bit more ground soy and put some cheddar cheese on top as well since I'm a true Wisconsin-ite!  I will be making this many times this winter!  Thanks!

mmm this was delicious.  I love the cinnamon and honey.  I added a lilttle NM red chile powder to give it a little more depth in the spice.  Overall yumminess!  Will definitely make it again, but maybe add some more veggies like zucchini or squash.

This turned out great and everyone loved it, but it was H O T, despite me cutting the cayenne down to 1/2 teaspoon.  The kids and my husband still all gave rave reviews.  The only thing I changed was using a can of black beans in place of one of the cans of kidney beans called for.  I'll definitely make this again.

The spices gave it a really nice kick.  My mom always made a rather sweet chili and it seemed she added the beans shortly before serving.  This was the first time I cooked chili this long and the beans were nice and soft, haha!  I just made it with what I had at home.  I didn't have any TVP or sour cream.  I question the need for the cinnamon, though.  This made a large pot and I can't imagine that 1/4 tsp of cinnamon really made much of a difference.  I certainly didn't taste it.  I like to cook a large pot of stuff so I have leftovers, and this recipe fit the bill there!  I always have chili on rice, though, so with the pot of rice this recipe will last 3 days and I have extra in the freezer.  I will be making this again!  Easy to make with "on hand" ingredients, quick prep time, and leaves a hot tingle in my mouth.  Thanks for the recipe!  Next time I might add some sliced jalapenos.  Hmm...

Update:  I tried it with TVP today.  Next time I will do as another suggested and double the amount of TVP.  1/2 cup was just barely noticeable in the chili.  That may be due to my using 19 oz cans of tomatoes and beans instead of 12 oz cans.

Wow!  Simple and delicious chili!  This was my first time using TVP but I was pleasantly surprised.  The chili tasted just like "normal" chili with meat.  What was even more fantastic was that DH tried the chili and really enjoyed it.  He did not have a clue there was TVP or he would have hit the ceiling.  I'm delighted to serve a high fiber, healthy, delicious tasting, filling entree to the family.

I had trouble with getting the tvp to brown, and then during the cooking time the chili developed a crust of burned stuff on the bottom of the pan. It made the whole batch taste a bit off, but was still edible. Maybe my medium to medium low heat was too much, but the flavor combined with the cinnammon was a bit strange.

Loved this recipe. I only cut back on some of the spices since I don't like real hot dishes.  Used only 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp gr cumin...omitted the cayenne, but used 2 drops of the sriracha chili sauce.  I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of cannellini beans. Used a yellow pepper since that is what I had.  VERY TASTY AND THE SPICE WAS JUST RIGHT.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE.

I am not a huge fan of chilli but I thought I would give this a go. I used frozen tvp rather than dried. I didnt have a carrot so I chopped up a few button mushrooms. I left out the cayenne and it was just the right amount of heat for me without it! It was fab!!! Really tasty. I am a chilli convert now. Thanks!!

Great recipe.  I love how there's a hint of sweet that's not overpowering.  We're not vegetarian, so I used extra lean ground turkey.  We also topped it with diced avocado as well, which was great.

I just made this for dinner and my husband's words were "mmmmm....I could eat this once a week!" He of course is a meat eater and wasn't sure about the TVP, but he LOVED it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used have the cayenne, which was perfect.  I made it with scalloped corn, and it was delightful! Thanks for the EXCELLENT recipe!!

Great recipe - made it vegan by subbing maple syrup for honey (was out of agave nectar!) and using cashew cream instead of sour cream. My omnivore husband and I both loved it. We will add this to our regulars!

Really good!  Did this in the slow cooker, sauteing the pepper, carrots, garlic, and onion with the fake meat first.  I used the fake meat crumbles instead of TVP (no soaking, just looks like ground beef).  I reduced the cayenne pepper by 1/2 (didn't want it to be too spicy for the average person) and only used 2 cloves of garlic.  It was still pretty spicy and so good!  I also added a can of corn.  Thank you!

I loved this recipe but I did modify it. I didn't chop the onion I just skined it cut the ends of and cut it in slivers with a food processor ( so they were more like french onion soup) I cut the spices in half as I don't like hot. I doubled the olive oil and honey. I didn't use TVP instead I used two morningstar black bean patties and added them crumbled up to the onions after they had cooked for several minutes. I didn't use two carrots instead I cut small slices from 6 baby carrots and put them in. I like my chili more like a soup so I added 3 cups of water as opposed to the 1 cup.  I didn't use sour creme instead I added 1/2 cup of taco cheese to each bowl (we had pretty big bowls several cups in each bowl) ... and I added cilantro at the end from a grocery tube instead of fresh... next time I want to try it with the brown rice someone suggested I think that might make it a little "heavier" ... the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's too spicy .... even with only half the seasoning it was still pretty hot for me.

I used black beans because that I had them on hand.  I also didn't use the cilantro or the green onions-just sour cream and cheddar. It tasted WONDERFUL! This is my first time making veggie chili (I've just started eating veggie) and it is great-I don't miss the meat at all!  Thank You!

We loved this recipe!  My husband liked the heat but I could have had it a bit less spicy.  I did make a mistake and added the green onion in the cooking instead of using it as a garnish.  I used a orange pepper because I like them better than green and the carrots I used were pre-shredded and organic from Publix.  I don't know where you find those size cans of beans and tomatoes so I used 2-15 oz cans of beans and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also used 1 cup of Gardein beefless ground brand veggie crumbles.  This was soooooo good especially with the homemade loaf of bread that my husband baked.

I like hot food but this was EXTREMELY HOT and not in a good way.  I have never tasted anything so hot.  I had to add two extra cans of tomatoes and two extra cans of rinsed beans to eliminate some of the heat.  STILL TOO HOT.

SO GOOD! I leave out the cinnamon, but the honey is an awesome touch!! I use 1C of TVP, add corn, olives, & sub a can of kidneys for mixed beans, sub a can of diced tomatoes in juice for a can of crushed tomatoes in tomato sauce, makes it a bit thicker.

AWESOME flavor!!! Wouldn't change a thing! However, I did add black beans and a 1/2  jar of my fave salsa - Clint's (Black Bean & Corn) Texas Salsa - for fun! Super yum! Will definitely make again! =)

I will make this again with half the spices and NO cinnamon.  With these changes, I think I will have a good replacement for my favorite chili that contains meat.  I used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can of black beans.

This was quite delish!  I did cut down on the cayenne as others suggested and glad I did.  I used 1/2 the amount called for.  Also, drained and rinsed one can of beans and replaced that liquid with the same amount of veggie broth.  Everything else remained the same.  I will make it again for sure.  I think I might even add more tvp next time.  This is a keeper!!  Thank you Paulina.  As a side note, I'm new to a more plant based diet/vegan and trying to find good, easy recipes particularly for diner.  This fits the bill. :)

This is an excellent recipe and very tasty.  I tweaked it a bit.  Didn't add the cayenne pepper and honey, and it still tasted really yummy.  I also used very good quality tomatoes and a 1/4 cup of Bragg's Liquid Aminos.   Next time I will make a double batch of this recipe to have leftovers.

Very good; very tasty. I lost some of the juice from the canned beans and put in some “Better than Boullion” broth.  Also used Morningstar Griller Crumbles instead f reconstituting dry TVP.

This is superb! I cut the cayenne by 1/2 a teaspoon and added more tvp and stock to compensate. I also threw in a few fresh tomatoes and tomato paste. Thanks so much for this recipe! It warmed us on a cold, rainy day.

True five star, but I never used TVP and I do it in a crock pot like others.
Use a package of BOCA crumbles sauteed with the onion and dump everything in the crockpot on low for 4-8 hours. The longer the better IMHO. 
If your family doesn't like much spice, reduce the chilli powder by half.

awesome recipe.  I also add 1/2 tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder to the spice mix.  I soaked Tvp in veggie broth and therefore used less salt than this recipe called for.  will make this again.

This was fantastic and so easy!  Just swapped out vegetable broth for the water.  It's going in our menu rotation immediately!

Love, love, love this... It is my go to chili recipe now and everyone always asks me for the recipe. The only thing i do different is just add a bunch more different types of peppers (anaheims, pablanos, etc) and halve the cayenne. Sometimes i will make this with meat instead of TVP to satisfy my hubby but he's tried it the other way too and didnt have any complaints. This is a keeper and the cinnamon and honey really make the dish!

I loved this recipe! I used Trader Joes meatless crumbles and it was fantastic.  Let it simmer on the stove for about an hour on the half, stirring occasionally. Also sliced avacados and put in the chili with no sour cream! It was a Superbowl hit!

Thanks
Nikki
