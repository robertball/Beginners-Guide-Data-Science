I'm not especially experienced with baking. I followed the recipe almost exactly, aside from leaving out the coconut and brewing my tea with 1/4 cup soymilk and 1/4 cup water, as a reviewer suggested. I used Stash Premium Chai Spice black tea, which uses exactly the spices called for in Masala Chai tea. I baked it right at 20 minutes and stuck a toothpick in the middle. It came out clean, so I took them out of the oven and let them sit. When I cut them, they were very moist but really didn't fall apart. One corner crumbled a tiny bit so I did what any noble baker would do: I ate it. Delish.

I used sweetened coconut instead, since that is all I could find at my store. I also only used 1T of cocoa powder for the bottom of the 8x8 pan. For a light dusting, that was even too much and I ended up dumping some of it out. Even with that, these are amazing brownies. Incredibly soft and moist.

As is, the recipe is okay, but the chai flavor is very very subtle. The second time around, I made the following changes: upped the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup, the vanilla to a full teaspoon, added one egg for improved texture, used half white and half packed brown sugar, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and used "chai butter" instead of oil. To make that, I simply simmered butter with a teaspoon of chai tea leaves for about 5 minutes, then strained. If you want to keep the recipe vegan, you can infuse the canola oil with chai as well, and omit the egg I added. Make sure the chai tea is brewed very strongly -- I poured 1 cup boiling water over three tea bags and steeped for 20 minutes. The chai flavor was more pronounced but not overpowering. Next time I might add some extra ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves for a spicier brownie.

I originally picked this recipe, because my friend's little sister is very allergic to eggs and she'd never had a brownie before. So of course I had to save this poor kid from a lifetime of dread and depression. This recipe was perfect and worked great. The trick might be to make the chai just right. I'm Bengali, so I made it thick and heavy, the way my family generally likes it, with a "Bengali Spice Chai" teabag from Celestial Seasonings. The brownies came out rich and dense, just how brownies should  be. The chai undertone made it even better for me.

Holy cow these are amazing! Definitely needed less than 2 Tbsp for dusting. Used a heaping 1/3 cup coconut (mmmm) which I ran through my small mixer thing. The chai: used two teabags steeped in 1/4 cup warm coconut milk and 1/4 cup hot water; strained the bags and then - aw, what the heck - opened them up and added the tea contents! I only had an 8x11 so they baked longer than 20 minutes (and remained "shiny"). Five of us for dinner - there are few remaining! Can't wait to make them again!

These are very moist & really yummy.  Fell apart a bit, but I made 1 1/2 times the recipe & baked in a 9x11 pan, so this  might have had an effect.  Will definitely bake again and will try some of the variations others suggested.

Made these for my vegan little brother....absolutely delicious!  I was slightly confused about the Masala chai, though....I wasn't quite sure whether to use tea brewed with water or with soy milk (to make sure that they are vegan).  After researching the traditional way to make the drink I went with a combination of the two and they turned out fabulously!

This brownie recipe is great!  The Chai flavor is as promised, subtle.  I love the coconut too.  My kids loved it but my Chai loving South Indian husband hated it.  Still I give it 5 stars :)

These brownies turned out great!  Didn't alter the recipe at all, except using less cocoa powder to sprinkle into the pan.

Steeped 1 Tbsp. chai in 1/2 cup boiling water, then dumped the entire thing (including the tea leaves/spices) in with the mix.  Gives a very apparent chai flavor.

These tasted all right, but I was a bit disappointed in the lack of chai flavoring, I didn't taste it at all!  Mostly it was just brownies with coconut in them.

These are delicious! I used sucanat instead of white sugar, coconut oil instead of canola oil, and made a strong rooibos chai tea. I am going to try with whole wheat flour next time.

I'm giving this a five before they're even baked because the batter is sooo good. I thought the hint of chai might be weird, but it's phenomenal. Truly a beautiful thing.

Yummy!  Soft, moist and chewy.  I left out the coconut, and used vanilla soy milk to brew my chai- if you use flavored soy, you might want to cut the amount of sugar in half, they are pretty sweet.  Also- it took mine almost 40 minutes to bake.  We will definitely be making these again!

ERMAHGERD!  These brownies are ridiculous.  There two things that I somehow manage to always screw up: cupcakes and brownies.  I substituted apple sauce for half of the oil, used brown sugar instead of white, steeped 3 Stash chai tea bags in coconut milk and hot water, ripped open 1 of the teabags didn't use cocoa powder for dusting the pan.  This was delicious as a batter, straight out of the oven and after sitting for an hour.  This is going to be my go to brownie recipe.  It's so hard to screw up!

These were very interesting.  I usually use espresso to heighten the chocolate flavor in brownies and the chai was a nice change.  The coconut accented the spices very well.  However after 10 minutes over the cooking time indicated, they were still not done in the middle, and fell apart even when they were completely cool.  Vegan brownies don't have to crumble just because they don't have egg in them.  If I make this again, I will modify the recipe, but this as-is provided a decent dessert for us.

I have nooo idea how to rate this recipe, because right now mine are ina lumpy, black, bitter mess. it's fully cooked, but it looks nothing like the picture. I'm panicking slightly, wondering what I did. The only thing was maybe, I used chai latte mix instead of tea and cut down 1/4 of the sugar. They are dense lumps that don't stick together and they barely cover the bottom of the pan. WHAT DID I DO???????

I made these tasty brownies with Rice Dream Chocolate Chai and added a little bit of nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom.  The chai flavor was very subtle but the chocolate in these was plenty flavorful.  They were moist and tender and mine did not crumble.  I cut them after 20 minutes and they were fine.  Ate one a little warm to try it out.  Slightly fudgey in the center.  Will definitely try again with chai tea steeped for 10 minutes or longer.  Enjoy!

Delicious!!!  I used gluten-free flour and substituted agave for the sugar and it came out great!  I think next time I will use coconut oil instead of canola.  And I like my chai strong and spicy, so I think I'll brew it even longer next time and add extra spices.  I had to bring them in to work today to share so that I didn't eat them all!

I was really looking forward to these and while they were good, I was hoping that the chai flavor would really come through and was a bit disappointed that it didn't.  I think the next time I make this, I'll actually add a dash of various chai spices to the mix to really give it some punch!

These are really good, especially considering no eggs or butter.  I will make them again, maybe without the coconut, as a personal preference.
I also did half applesauce half oil as someone else suggested.
I left them out on the counter overnight by accident and they were still moist the next day.

These brownies taste great, but are very crumbly and difficult to cut (I gave them 1.5 hours to cool). These would be fantastic served as a brownie sundae! I followed the receipe exactly and received many compliments from my dinner guests.

wow, this was fantastic- I was very hesitant to try vegan brownies not knowing what was in store for me.....even my picky son loves them.  next time I make them I am going to add chili pepper to it for a kick and I will steep the tea twice as long( 10 minutes)!  wanted to give it 6 stars but 5 was the max.....MUST TRY THIS!!

Made it without the coconut. I guess I didn't make the chai strong enough, because I can barely taste it - but they're very good brownies nonetheless.

I made these without the coconut b/c my cousin isn't a big fan of it, but I did use coconut milk to brew the chai. Also, I used organic buckwheat flour instead because my bf is allergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs.Despite cooking them for about 35 minutes, they never became very solid. That said, everyone loved it (though they said next time I should serve it with ice cream! I'm going to try making this with almond flour (instead of all-purpose) and either carob flour or agave for the sugar (I'll nix the chai if I use agave to even out the liquid content) so that *I* can eat it (carb restrictions). I'll let you know how that turns out.

I love vegan brownies so I really wanted to try these.  They were so worth going off my diet for.  The spiciness was very subtle (despite my accidentally using a full cup of chai, made them really moist though!)

This was an excellent, easy and moist brownie. The coconut reminded me of a 'haystack brownie' I had one time...I will be making these probably more than I should.

These were AWESOME!!! I brewed my chai without milk and added twice as much coconut. Perfect for me. I think I'll scale back the oil a bit next time and maybe substitute some applesauce in place of it. I couldn't stop eating them they were sooooo good!!!

What kind of a sadist wrote this recipe?! Allow to cool for ONE HOUR before cutting?! Has anybody ever followed this recipe to the letter? You shouldn't! These brownies taste best warm. They're deliciously fragrant! If you don't have to have your brownies fudgy, this is a great recipe! Just use less sugar (for me 1/3 cup was perfect), and start checking doneness before the 20 minute mark.

As with other reviewers I found the chai flavour too subtle. I've made it a few times with different variations and now pump up the spice flavour considerably by adding chai spices directly to the recipe -cardamom, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, sometimes anise, maybe some black pepper, maybe nutmeg. I also often add some almond or pistachio

So yummy! I used India Spice Chai and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup since I don't like things quite so sweet. Baked 20 minutes but they were still goey in the center. I'm at high altitude so maybe that's why. Topped with a sprinkle of cocoa doughnut glaze and then put them in the fridge a few hours to firm them up. Love them!

These are good, but I feel like they need some milk to fill them out. I may try to use a soy milk or regular milk next time to make them work-- else, I normally use 3 chai masala tea bags per cup of boiling water to brew them.

No coconut, but made these for a vegan Co worker.   The Chai spice is very subtle, but the brownie overall was good.

i had to heavily modify the recipe and i still didn't think it came out moist enough (my dinner-mates thought it was great, I think they were just polite).  Added a whole egg, extra half pinch of cinnamon, allspice and cloves to add a kick to the flavour.  The tea bags didn't do much at all (3 Tazo Organic Chai tea bags simmered for 30 minutes)

We found these brownies enjoyable but the flavor didn't wow us.  I added extra cinnamon and cardamom to the batter to boost the chai flavor, but it was still very mild.

These brownies are SO tasty.  I had to cook them about 5-10 min longer than it says and they are crumbly, but taste amazing!

These brownies are amazing!  I make this as written except instead of blending up the coconut I just put it in shredded.  So moist and always a hit!  I will am looking forward to trying what 1 reviewer suggested: brewing the tea in soy milk.
