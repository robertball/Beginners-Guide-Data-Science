I just made this recipe for the first time today.  I saw this recipe and loved it and wanted to try, only to find after getting it going that it had such negative reviews but decided to go with it anyway.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding some pepper and it was excellent!  :)  My husband and I LOVED it and our daughter did as well.  It was tender (falling apart) and FULL of flavor.  I used the jellied sauce like the recipe says.  When I do pork roasts I tend to poke the meat all over with a fork before putting it in...this may be why mine had a lot of flavor as opposed to the others who tried it.  All in all - excellent!  Paired with some oven roasted potatoes, delicious!  :)

You need to use whole berry cranberry sauce and cut out the cranberry juice. I used juice and jest of 1 whole orange.

This recipe is not what I thought it would be. It didn't really taste very good just a tad like clove and slight sweet taste. I wish it had more sustenance and was seasoned a little more.  I will say that its very easy but I was definitely let down and so was my family.

This was easy to make and turned out really good.  I used whole cranberry sauce, a bit of orange juice instead of cranberry juice and no added sugar.  Put on low in the crock for about 8-9 hrs. and it came out very tender.  Not an overpowering taste but just a hint of flavor.

Yum!  I tend to take recipes as a jumping off point, so if you are like-minded, here is what I did and it was delish!  I started with a thinly sliced sweet onion and a cup or so of white wine. Then I followed the recipe more or less, with whole cranberry sauce and an extra handful of cruising from the cupboard and a sprig or two of rosemary thrown in as  well as two crushed clementine oranges and their zest.  I served it with fresh biscuits and everyone from age four on seemed very happy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly!

Super easy to make! I agree with annnoe that if you want a thicker sauce at the end use less juice & whole berry cranberry sauce.  Made for a diabetic with hbp I had a 2.5 lb roast so I doubled everything, used cinnamon instead of cloves, splenda instead of sugar (12 pkts) left out the salt and added the juice & zest from 1 orange, tenderized it by poking holes all over the roast & cooked on high for 4 hrs then down to low for 2.  Dad loved it!  It was soooo tender, just fell apart & bursting with flavor all the way through it! It is on the sweeter side of things, so be sure to be in the mood for fruity flavor.

I had leftover homemade cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving and a small pork loin roast that I defrosted from the freezer.  I didn't have cranberry juice, though, so I substituted it with the equivalent amount of water plus about a quarter cup of dried cranberries.  Be sure to taste test the sauce while adding the sugar (cranberry sauces can be quite sweet) and check for doneness before the slow cooker's scheduled quit time.   Mine was done in 4 rather than 6 hours. .  My cranberry pork dish turned out great -- tender and delicious.

It was tasty, but needed just a little tang or zip.  I omitted the sugar thinking it would be too sweet and I'm glad I did; it was plenty sweet without it!  Next time, I'll take the advice of others and add a bit of orange juice and zest to give it that extra "something" that was missing (for my tastes).  I will definitely be making this again!

Recipe was great!   Only change I made was added water instead of cranberry juice and cinnamon instead of cloves.  Sauce was great on rice.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY last night and was very disappointed! The roast was flavorless and the sauce/gravy just did not work with it at all. It wasn't that the gravy was too sweet, it just had the weird mix of cloves and sweet flavor that made the roast taste worst!  I have never posted a negative review before.

I made this today. I didn't have the juice so I used water and added a half can extra cranberries. I used regular mustard. I didn't have dry mustard. I added more cloves. It came out so tasty. Very good. The roast fell apart. I forgot to take a picture of it though.

Delicious- everyone in my fam loved this. I did make several of the changes mentioned in comments: made my own cran sauce (2 c cran, 1 c water, 1 c brown sugar), omitted the extra 1/4 c sugar and cran juice, instead added 2T frozen OJ concentrate and grated rind of 1 orange, added 1/4t salt and 1/4t pepper. I also browned the pork on all sides and poked several holes in it before placing it in crock.

I have made this recipe many times, however, I do double the sauce.  I serve with garlic mashed potatoes, fresh green beans, salad and a wonderful white wine. My children love it.  Making it for Christmas dinner this year.

I've made this several times.  It's a nice change for a holiday meal.  The sauce makes a great gravy on potatoes.  I use orange juice instead of cranberry, and a little less sugar.  I cut the meat into thick slabs, across the grain, to make it less stringy and easier to serve.  Also gets more flavor into the meat.

This was the simplest and most moist and delicious pork roast.  A lot of the reviews said it was bland, but I only made a couple of tiny changes and it turned out spectacular.  I used leftover homemade cranberry sauce that I had frozen (rather than a can).  My sauce had been made with orange juice, and I also substituted orange juice for the cranberry in the recipe.  I also added 1/4 C of red wine vinegar.  Cooked on high for about 5 hours.  I didn't even bother adding thickener to the sauce - just spooned it over the sliced roast.  So yummy.

This recipe is great but I made a few adjustments. Instead of cranberry juice I used chicken broth and before I put the lid on I sprinkled dry Rosemary and thyme over the roast! It was delicious with great flavor!

Like another reviewer - the recipe looked great and I was surprised by the negative reviews.  I followed the recipe as stated - no substitutions.  Pork was fork tender and the sauce was so tasty.  I'm planning on making this recipe again for a late holiday supper meal.  It was so easy in the crockpot

I'm a retired personal chef and rarely use a recipe as is.....but.....this one made sense to me and I had homemade cranberry sauce left over and waiting for something fun to do with it.
Welllllll.....all I did was add cubed potatoes on top with sliced onions over everything.  Cooked in hot pot for an hour....and presto! 
Came out great and will do often!  Also, the potatoes sitting on top absorbed the wonderful flavor above and below, and were some of the best I've had in a long time.  Highly recommend this recipe with the potato/onion additions!

I made this but the family did not like it. They begged me to go back to my original recipe which is one can of cranberry sauce with the berries mixed with one envelope of onion soup mix and 8 ounces of French dressing stir that all together pour  over the roast cook on low for six hours. Delicious!

I made this following directions as written.  I did fork the roast as previous review had commented and it was delicious.  The gravy was very good.  My husband enjoyed also.  Meat was very tender.  I had a 2.5 pound roast so I doubled everything.

This recipe - as is - was a hit at a dinner party!  Last time I made it, I used a 4.9 lb. tenderloin.  After we ate our share, we froze the rest and will make a pulled pork meal from it.  Yummmm!

I omitted the sugar. Loved the tangy flavor.
