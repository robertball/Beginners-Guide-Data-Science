This is a no fail cake. I did roll it while hot and it rolled beautifully. When I unrolled it to cover in cream it was perfect.
I wish this recipe included a ganache for the topping.

This was my first effort at a yule log and it turned out great! I only cooked it for 8 minutes and it was definitely ready to come out, so be careful not to overcook the cake. I also adapted the ganache by mixing the melted chocolate in with whipped cream because that's what my daughter wanted. Probably would have been just as good as-is in the recipe. Will definitely make again!

Overall, this is a good recipe. The reason for a 4 star is because the ingredient amounts listed don't match the written instructions, that was a little confusing. FOLLOW THE MEASUREMENTS IN THE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS. I also recommend sifting the cocoa powder. The first time I made it, I had lumps of cocoa powder in the cake.

This recipe took a bit of effort, but came out pretty good. It definitely tastes better after it has been refrigerated to let the cream mixture harden. I used greased parchment paper as others had suggested, and the cake rolled out pretty well. My wife liked it enough that we will probably make it again next Christmas.

Easy and fun to make. It was delicious. Only change I made was to add powdered dark chocolate to the filling

This was very good, but I think I would adjust the recipe to 12 servings because the batter was a bit skimpy on my sheet pan.

Excellent recipe.Followed exactly. Recipe for Ganache was good but made a little to much. Next time I will use less when decorating log. I baked for around 10 minutes and cake was perfect.

Turned out really good, never made one before didn't know what to expect. I was out of vanilla extract so I used orange extract which worked for me and reminded me of those Chocolate orange I get at Christmas. Made slight changes to the filling and I'm happy with the overall results. Will make again
