I knew I was in trouble as soon as I tasted the batter. These cookies are phenomenal. I used high quality ingredients: Lake Champlain cocoa and Ghiradelli 60% cocao and white chocolate chips. I had made this recipe before it was kitchen approved.  I'm so glad it is now published because this is one of the best cookie recipes I’ve tried in some time. Thanks JRBaker for sharing!

These cookies taste delicious. Kept going back for more. They have the perfect amount of white chips to compliment the semi chocolate minis.  I followed the directions exactly with no substitutions. The instant coffee granules enhance the rich chocolate flavor. The dried cherries gave these cookies a nice texture. Baked up perfectly for me at the 10 minute mark. 
Five Stars~ Thanks Jrbaker

These are amazing! Just the right ratio of crunchy to chewy. Chocolate and cherry is a delicious combination. The coffee flavor enhances the overall flavor very nicely.  Next time I'll be doubling this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I like to use a cookie scoop to make them uniform, and can get approximately 24 cookies per batch.  You can use either dark chocolate cocoa powder for a richer color (like in my photo) or regular cocoa is just as delicious and will result in a lighter brown cookie.

Mmmmm, way good. I had a cookie craving and this recipe called my name. It was super easy. I didn't have cherries so I tossed in some dried cranberries which worked nicely but I do think some nice tart cherries would have been even better. I'm a coffee and chocolate fiend so I used about a teaspoon and a half of instant espresso. Yum. And a small handful of chopped pecans. I'm not saying this recipe NEEDS any changes because it would be great exactly as written. 
Well, I'm gonna go have another cookie now.

I haven't baked with cocoa in the longest time. The taste brought back some memories. I've never used dried cherries in baking before. What a delicious combination. I chopped the cherries first because they looked to be quite large. I'm glad I did because I think there would have been overwhelming bites of cherry. I made these to add to my Christmas cookie tray. Thanks jrbaker.

Had all of the ingredients on hand and made the recipe exactly as written.   While they were baking, the smell was actually that of coffee versus chocolate.  The instant coffee taste was a little overpowering for our liking.  We tried some of these while they were warm and discovered they were actually better after they had cooled for awhile - which was odd because who doesn't like a warm, just out of the oven cookie?  I have had this recipe in my recipe box for sometime and am glad I finally tried it.  Thanks for sharing jrbaker!

Best recipe ever. Reasonably simple, and gives the humble cookie an amazingly sophisticated taste. I'll make it again and again, I'm sure.

Awesome cookies!!! I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  These are devine.  I liked using the instant coffee.... mixed into the egg and vanilla to ensure it disolved, then into batter.  Mine baked for about 11 minutes.  Had to make two batches these are so good! Thanks jrbaker!

2-14-2020 ~These are better than Godiva chocolates for Valentine’s Day - and that’s what HUBS said!  In all the years I’ve been a member of Allrecipes, this just might be the first time he’s rated anything five stars!  Chocolate-y and just right sweet, crisp along the edges, chewy but soft in the middle. Chocolate and cherries – what a winning combination.  Since neither of us cares for white “chocolate,” I used all mini chocolate chips which in my mind is partly what made these so darned good.

This is a fabulous recipe. I had to make a few tiny change based on what I had in my pantry. I didn't have instant coffee powder so I added 1/4 tsp of almond extract to punch up the flavor and I only had large chocolate chips, used those, and I had no white chocolate so skipped that. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. I got 36 cookies out of the recipe.

The flavor of these cookies is great. I was hoping for a thicker, chunkier cookie, but mine came out a little on the flat side, not sure why. Tried chilling the dough and it helped a little, but still weren't as chunky as I'd hoped. My husband loved them and I'm sure I'll make them again.

Great recipe, loved the combination of chocolate, white chocolate chips and cherries... Only a small negative is they were a little bit more crunchy than I would have liked, I'm more of a chewy cookie person.  Even so a great recipe and one I'm sure I will be making again.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good recipe. I had to bake them the full 12 minutes or they came out gooey. I also used Starbucks instant coffee and it was WAY to strong, LOL. If you like your cookies to taste a bit like coffee, use the Starbucks.

I don't drink coffee and wasn't about to buy some just for this so I didn't add coffee. As strange as it sounds I substituted candy sprinkles for the coffee (the thicker sprinkles). I also added more chocolate chips instead of adding white chocolate chips, and used cranberries instead of cherries. Perfect texture and great flavor.

These cookies are fantastic! I used my coveted Chukar cherries from Pike Place market. This recipe is definitely worthy! I substituted all dark chocolate chips because I had a partial bag on hand. The cookie is chocolately with the sweet tart bite of plump, dried cherries.

These cookies are delicious!  I made them gluten, dairy & egg free due to food sensitivities.  I used Earth Balance (buttery spread), Enjoy Life semi-sweet chocolate chips & a Neat Egg.  I eliminated the coffee granules and white chocolate chips & instead doubled the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I’m excited to share them with my friends...yummy!

Pretty good chocolate chip cookies.  I put in all semi-sweet chocolate chips and used up the rest of the maraschino cherries I had left over from Christmas.

As written, a one star review in my book. I love chocolate and even candy, but these cookies were inedibly sweet once you put in all the mix-ins.  I threw out most of the cookies and the unbaked cookie dough. But the cookie dough itself had promise.  I decreased the sugar by two tbs  and put in  1/2 cup of chopped hazelnuts and 1/3 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes and no other mix-ins. Those cookies are pretty good (probably four stars).  I’d decrease the sugar a little more, but as it was the texture started getting a little dry, so I don’t think it can go down any more.

These came out great. I did cut up my dried cherries so they blended in better. Only made 2 small changes, used all 1/2 cups mini  chocolate chips since I didn't have white chocolate ones and added half tsp of almond extract

Excellent flavor.  I used espresso powder instead and got a great mocha flavor.  The only thing was that it was a touch salty.  I might reduce it by a pinch.

These are a winner.  Do not overbake, they firm up very nicely.  I skipped the coffee, husband loves cherries but hates coffee.  I will try with coffee sometime when making for someone other than hubby.

These are delicious- although quite sweet in spite using only semi sweet chocolate.  I also used espresso powder instead of coffee crystals (that's what I had in my cupboard) and would use it again but probably increase the amount- maybe double!  Definitely will make again.

Super good! Used craisins and walnuts because I didn't have cherries or white chips. But the latter is needed otherwise it's just a dark looking cookie. Would have preferred it if they didn't get so flat when baked.

Great cookie for sure. I had higher hopes for other-worldy given reviews, but they were just 'very good'. In future I'd use dried cranberries as you can't tell the difference between these and dried cherries (at about 8 times the price) in the recipe.

Delicious cookies. I didn't have mini choc chips so used regular size and they turned out good.

Very good and pretty simple to make.  Made it just as written. I did chop the cherries up before adding them.  Ten minutes was just right for cooking time for my oven.  The cookies are very soft and squishy when they come out of the oven,  but they firm up as they cool until they are a little crunchy on the edge and soft in the middle, so be sure not to overcook them.

These were fab-U-lous!  I didn't have enough cherries for the double batch I made.  Those suckers are pricey.  I would have liked to have the full amount as I really enjoyed the tart flavour with the chocolate chips.

The batter itself is dangerous. Next time I'll use dark cocoa powder, and the instant coffee granules (didn't have any on hand), for a deeper chocolate color. Fabulous cookies.
