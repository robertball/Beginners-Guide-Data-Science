There is surely a mistake in this recipe:  use 3 boxes of spinach and it's great, but only if you like things hot!  I just nuked it for a couple of minutes and it came out fine.

i'm only giving this a three star rating because i made quite a bit of modification to the posted recipe. with my modifications, i thought it was so delicious! used 1/2 jalapeno havarti and 1/2 mozzarella and kind of eyeballed the shredded cheese. it was probably close to 5oz. added garlic salt and freshly ground mixed pepper to taste, half a diced red onion and about 1/2 tsp jarred minced garlic. mixed well, but saved a little less than half of the cheese to sprinkle on top then baked as listed. wasn't too spicy but still very tasty!

Based on previous reviewer comments.  I cut back on the pepper jack to about 2 ounces and combined it ith 3 ounces of Colby Jack.  Spiciness was OK but it needs salt.

So easy! Didn't even have to go to the store. I used fresh spinach instead (wilted in a pan for about 4 min) and half colby jack/half cheddar. Made about a third of the recipe and just nuked it for a minute and a half (and that was plenty of time). Since I didn't use pepper jack, I added in a few red pepper flakes for spiciness.

And then I ate the whole thing by myself in less than 10 minutes. Oops! :)

Very simple and tastes delicious. 1 package is not enough. Next time I'll do 4 pkgs. I had some pepper jack cubes, didn't know what to do with them.  I also added 1/4 cup Mexican cheese shredded and garlic salt.

I just made a version of this recipe for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I didn't have any pepper jack on hand so I used a mixture of cheddar and Sargento Taco cheeses. I didn't thaw the spinach, which didn't seem to affect the dish. I also added approximately 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and paprika. I look forward to trying this with pepper jack cheese!

I add jalape√±os and onion to make it a bit spicier, but I loved it!  I will make it again.
