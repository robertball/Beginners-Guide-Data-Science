Bleh...very bland sauce.  Tried improving by doubling the Sriracha but the coconut milk is too strong.

I made a few changes so can't give it five stars.  Used a mixture of fresh veggies instead of frozen.  Didn't have srirachia sauce so used Frank's hot sauce.  Used some coconut oil instead of oil spray.  Saut√©ed chicken for five minutes then added veggies.  After five minutes, added some of the sauce and cooked for about another five minutes.  The sauce is excellent!  My husband was ready to drink it as is.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks.

This is delicious! I put some random ingredients I had into the recipe finder and this was one of the choices it came up with. It sort of reminds me of kung pao chicken. I used fresh veggies because that's what I had, and I didn't feel like rice so I served it over egg noodles. Definitely will make again.

This is delicious with just the right amount of spicy heat. I stir fried some fresh vegetables to slightly under done. I added them instead of the frozen ones after the chicken had browned. This is definitely something we will make again!

I did increase the portions with the idea of having leftovers for lunch for work.  I am not sure the sauce ingredients scale well.  The sauce, when cooled, turned back into peanut butter consistency.  I ended up not using any more of it.  It just didn't seem right, gummed up the veggies more than the flavor helped.  As I still have coconut milk I might try again (I love peanut flavor) but right now it's not speaking to my palate.

Pretty good. I used Ardvark sauce instead of Sriracha. Next time I may use more Ardvark and soy. Mine turned out tasting pretty much like peanut butter with chicken and veggies.

The flavor combination hinted at this recipe was an excellent base our dinner.
