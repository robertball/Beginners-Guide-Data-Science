Yes, this recipe does work and tastes delicious when done correctly. No, it's not as easy as it sounds (as you can tell by the negative comments, here). So, why bother with this recipe? Well, learning to make this sauce helped me master all sorts of recipes that required caramelized sugar. With that being said, first, you need a little less water than a 1/2 cup: just enough to moisten the sugar. That's because all of that water has to evaporate before the hot sugar will caramelize (because the temperature of caramelization is 320-340F, which is higher than boiling - 212F). Second, and this is important, when the sugar starts to boil, drops will splash along the sides of the pot, the water will evaporate, and the sugar will crystallize there. If they fall back into the pot, they act as seed crystals, which can make the entire mixture harden (which has happened to some people who've tried this). For that reason, try not to splash the sugar mixture on the side of the pot when initially combining the water and sugar. To remedy this, dip a pastry brush in a cup of water and gently brush the sides of the pot to dissolve the sugary drops until they run back down into the pot.  You will only need to repeat that until the bubbles get larger and stop splashing. After that, it should be smooth sailing. Now, be patient while it is being heated and DON'T STIR the mixture (mixing will cause crystals to form); the sugar WILL caramelize, and turn the beautiful amber color you want; but will

Turned out awful. The directions should say do not stir while sugar is cooking. I got that from the reviews but it should be in the directions.

Follow the directions and this sauce will work out perfectly! One thing I will say is I added a tbsp of vanilla, to add a little extra flavour.

I am really pleased with how this caramel sauce turned out :) , this is my first time making caramel and since I am not a hardcore fan of salted caramel I added just two pinches of salt which is rather imperceivable so I will add some more the next batch I make. I highly recommend giving this recipe a whirl, simple and delicious!

These proportions of sugar, cream and butter make a delicious caramel, rather you add all the salt or not.  I just added a heaping 1/4 tsp., as I needed regular caramel.

I had never made caramel before and I let it get too dark so it tasted way too bitter to salvage.  Take two.  I brought the sugar to the boil on high heat, then turned it down to medium high and watched it like a hawk.  Once it starts to color at all,  turn it down to medium. If you have an electric stove you may need to slide the pan off heat since it takes a sec for the temp to drop.   Swirl the sugar gently without lifting the pan, to even out the color.  I took mine off the heat at the light golden color because it continues to cook and darken while adding the cream and butter.  That's how I burnt my first batch.

I also warmed my cream in the microwave, and had my butter room temp.  This way it doesn't seize and clump and is much easier to whisk smooth.

Don't be discouraged if your first effort bombs.  You'll see how much heat you can work with, how quickly the sugar colors before it burns.  If it gets too dark don't think the cream will save it!  If it smells burnt it is burnt.  Throw that sugar out and start again.  You'll get the hang of it and never want to buy caramel again.

It turned out perfectly the first time I made it, which rarely happens to me. I made this to go over vanilla ice cream "for the kids." It ended up being the hit of the party with the adults. It was easy and absolutely DELICIOUS! I didn't have sea salt so I just used table salt and increased the amount to 3 teaspoons.

Ok before I made this I read some reviews. Great info from Steve so I went ahead. I’ve made caramel sauce before and had no issues. With this one I got the big lumps when I stirred in the cream. So I added the butter and some vanilla and stirred well and put it back on the heat for a couple of minutes and it smoothed right out! So delicious. Also I’d like to add that next time I will reduce the water.

If I had known how easy it was to make caramel sauce, I could have saved myself time and money running to the grocery store for Kraft caramels! And, as always, homemade tastes SO much better!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. 

To help prevent crystals forming around the pan do not stir. You can use a pastry brush dipped in cold water or you can just cover the pot. The condensation will just drip down the sides.

The first time I made this, I did everything wrong and it turned out horrible. I started with the heat too high and continually stirred the mixture, scrapping the sugar crystals back into the syrup. The second time I tried, I kept the heat on med until small bubbles formed and then raised the temp. I left the mixture alone and did not stir it which helped control the crystals forming. The syrup browned nicely and has a great flavor.

Did not work at all. The simple syrup turned to hard candy as soon as I added the liquid. I put it back on the burner, which melted the hard candy, but it never thickened.

The sugar water mixture never turned to the amber color. I tried a second batch and I made sure to turn the heat to medium low until bubbles formed on the edges of the sauce pan. Turned up the heat, and the recipe turned to rock candy! I wasted 2 cups of sugar! At this time,I'm still looking on all recipes.com for a better salted Carmel sauce recipe. :(

No stars! Twice I tried...the first time it crystallized before turning Amber, so tried again. Too soon, so didn't make a sauce at all.
