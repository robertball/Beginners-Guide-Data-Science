I consider myself a well established cook, with that said, let me say this recipe was less then impressive.  the overall taste of this recipe was "strange" to say the least - I attempted to Dr. it by adding addl spices, it helped some, but not enough for me to present it at my dinner table.  I'd pass on trying this recipe save your time and money - it was NOT worth the effort.

The general idea is good, but like others have said, the cinnamon is rather strange. I used nutmeg instead, as it's found in alfredo sauce, and used about half as much (1/8 tsp).

This recipe was great until I had to add cinnamon. I had to add a million spices just to negate this flavor. I highly recommend not using this recipe. There are a million other things you can do with zucchini and pasta.

We loved this recipe.  The cinnamon was a nice flavor.  I added  leftover turkey for a one pot supper.
