This was an excellent salad. It reminds me of a Cobb Salad. I also added some crumbled feta cheese to add some zing to it but either way it is a good one.

This had a nice zing to it. I made it as a side salad for blackened salmon so I didn't use the chicken. I added a clove of garlic and about 3 dashes of cajun seasoning to the dressing. Definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent salad easily adaptable to suit individual tastes and preferences. For me that meant substituting fresh tomatoes for the sun-dried which just weren t moving me in a cold salad. It also meant not stirring crushed garlic into a hot pan where you re blackening chicken which I had Hubs do outside on the gas grill (even tho it s 36 degrees outside!) in a cast iron skillet. I still wanted the garlic flavor however so I added some minced to the salad dressing instead. I needed to adjust the salad dressing as well to my preferred oil to vinegar ratio of 3:1. Equal parts vinegar and oil would be far too vinegary for me. Everything is in balance here and I especially liked the mix of the peppery arugula with the milder greens and the mild creamy avocado against the spicy blackened chicken. Rather than dice everything and toss it altogether I topped the greens with the tomatoes olives and slices of avocado then arranged a sliced chicken breast on each. Great salad that does both the taste buds and body good.

This salad was so good and a snap to put together. Instead of frying the chicken whole I sliced the breasts into strips and then seasoned. Not a sun dried tomato fan so I left those out but because I had everything on hand I added broccoli carrots cukes and topped with feta. The avocado beautifully complimented the spice of the chicken. Very nice and thank you!

Yummy salad! Wonderful flavors. I made it as is & loved it! I was worried the chicken would be too spicy for my taste but it was the right amount of kick. The calorie count is high but that comes from various fats in the recipe which are good fats so I'm ok with it. I will make it again!

Only used sun-dried tomatoes and spring mix since that's what I had on hand but this is easily one of the best salads I've had in a while. The dressing is easily my favorite part! The whole dish is delicious the next day too. I have a lovely slightly tart white wine with it; it goes well.

This was delicious! The chicken was nice and spicy but when combined with the avocado's natural cooling effect it was divine! I bought the chicken cut for Scallopini (sp?) so it was thin and tender and better sized for salad. The dressing was really good but I made two portions of it instead of one. This is a recipe I'll keep and share!

This turned out pretty good but I did have a few substitutes. I grilled the chicken instead of frying and added crushed garlic and a few splashes of lime juice to the meat before grilling. I used a few small grape tomatoes instead of sun dried to the salad along with cucumbers (sliced in half) feta cheese and omitted the olives. Yum!

Loved this salad. Made mostly by the recipe. Changed only the ratio of Oil to vinegar 3:1 as equal parts would have been too much vinegar for us. Really enjoyed the ingredients. Perfect for a hot August in Texas. Thanks for a really nice recipe which we will have often

I will definitely make this again! I made some minor changes re: what I had in the house (e.g. grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried). Definitely lived up to its name - it was fab!
