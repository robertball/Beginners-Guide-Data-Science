With only one red pepper, onion and jalapeno mixed in with a 15oz can of garbanzo beans, I knew I'd need another can of beans.  I don't know how anyone could use 4 bell peppers and still expect to find a chickpea on their fork!!!  This was fresh and easy to make, but I changed the recipe a lot (leaving out 3 peppers, adding another can of beans).  Maybe I shouldn't even have reviewed it??

We just tried this recipe and everyone loved it.  I added cilantro instead of the parsley and added chopped kalamata olives. The possibilities are endless.  I found that I would use 2 cans of the garbanzos if using 2 of each peppers.

Winged it on this - I just added and tossed to my liking, until it looked right to me.  Left out the jalapeno because I didn't have any and added artichokes because I did.  I did use the mix of lime and lemon but I would have preferred just the lemon.  Light, fresh, Mediterranean flavors.  Ripe black olives would be a terrific addition.  (In fact, I think I might still do that)

We loved the red pepper and garbanzo beans and added celery and some blanched green and wax beans for added umph!  A very nice salad to toss together on a warm summer day.

This is a great salad. I had a salad like this in a great restaurant around my area, but didn't know what all the ingredients were.  Now I make this all the time (I think my kids are getting tired of it) Although it doesn't need anything else, I changed to cilantro instead of parsley.  I also knew I was going to prepare this for dinner  after church service , so I chopped the peppers, onions and added pinch of salt, olive oil and red wine vinegar and set it aside for later.   Let me tell you what I got....A pickled delicious mess!!!!!!

This was a super easy salad to make and my husband loved it even though he isn't fond of garbanzo beans. He loved the lemon dressing to it. I didn't add jalapeño to it because I have little kids but they loved the salad too. I imagine if I could taste it with the jalapeño, I would probably give it 5 stars since it would have more diverse flavor.

I first had this on a plane, of all places! It was made with cilantro instead of parsley. I like both. YUMMY! My husband likes it because it tastes like hummus before it hits the food processor.
