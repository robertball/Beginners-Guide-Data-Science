Great recipe – however – I think there is a typo in the ingredient list:  the 1 4-ounce can of “tomato sauce with garlic and onions” – I am convinced that was supposed to read tomato “PASTE” (and that is what I used) – since I don’t think tomato sauce comes in 4-ounce cans (the tomato paste – to my knowledge – only comes in 6-oz. cans).  Ok – I made a few changes – instead of a green pepper – I used a drained and rinsed can of diced green chilies.  I didn’t have fired roasted diced tomatoes – so I used 3 regular cans of diced tomatoes and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika.  I also added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar.  On the preparation front – I cooked the pepper flakes, onion, red pepper, and garlic in a saucepan and added a bottle of beer.  Once those were soft – I used a slotted spoon to transfer them to the slow cooker – then cooked my pound of ground bison in the remaining beer liquid.  Once that was browned completely – all the liquid was gone – made for added layers of flavor! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was very good, but I think there are a couple of things that improve it: 1) use fresh garlic and press it rather than using minced from a jar 2) don't drain the beans!  It made for a soupier chili.  3) Add a dash or two of Tabasco at the end.  This chili is rather sweet and that helped to counter act.  This was great with  Vegan Agave Cornbread Muffins!

Overall, this was pretty darn good!  I haven't had a chance to try pumpkin chili yet, so I was surprised by what a delcious flavor this added to the chili.  It made it taste earthy and just slightly sweeter.  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I did not drain my beans which helped make the chili soupier.  Also, I used fresh garlic.  And, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  The one thing I would have liked is for it to be a little spicier.  I would recommend added diced green chilies/jalapenos/something to add a little more heat which I will experiment with next time around.  Thanks for the fun fall recipe, Daisy!

I love this chili! I did make a few slight changes to the recipe by using turkey instead of beef and doubling the chili powder and adding cayenne pepper. I shared it with friends and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this every fall from now on!

Finally I had cool enough weather to try this chili recipe last night. I pretty much made just as written, my changes were to use garden fresh chili pepper and two jalapeño peppers in lieu of the green pepper. I did add some yellow and red bells though. I also used whole 15oz. can of tomato sauce, instead of the two different cans of tomato sauces the cook recommends, I think that may be a typo. I did add a bit more cumin and chili powder, since we like spicy. I always add a dash of cinnamon to my own chili, and this one certainly was no exception. I loved the creamy thick texture the pumpkin gave to the soup, only giving a delicate nutty sweetness to the normal hearty southwest chili dish. With the fall coloring the pumpkin adds along with the variety of beans, and vegetables, plus the added health benefit of the pumpkin, make this a dish I will regularly rotate in the cooler months. You could even make this healthier by adding ground turkey instead of beef, or use an extra can of beans and no meat at all. Thanks Daisy K for the recipe.

This was really good!  I made one minor change to ensure my family would eat it.  I only used great white northern beans and black beans since my kids don't care for kidney.  I drained the beans, and while the pumpkin pure thickens it nicely, it wasn't to thick.  Also, I ended up doubling the ground beef and the seasoning as a result.  I didn't find this to be sweet at all.  Wonderful chili for something a little different!

This really wasn't very spicy but worked for me as I was making this for a daycare chili cookoff.  I chose this because it sounded different from the norm.  I did use about 1.75 pounds of ground beef.  This was a nice, thick, hearty chili and not too spicy for small children.  I actually ended up winning the chili cookoff with this recipe!  Thanks!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I didn't taste the pumpkin at all, and the flavor was bland. I used the amount of spice indicated in the recipe (and yes, my spices are fresh and have not been sitting around forever), but I thought it just tasted like tomatoes and that was it. It was edible, but not enjoyable.

Daisy, this was my first pumpkin chili and BOY was it Terrific! slightly sweet and spicy. Thick and Rich! My 19 yo DD is eating it as I am typing for breakfast! She gives it 2 high 5's! I used a can of V-8 and tomato paste in loo of tomato sauce. It was a rainy dreary evening yesterday and this was the Perfect meal! I made a pan of cornbread muffins that rounded out the meal.  I will keep this one close by. Thanks again Daisy k!

This is the only chili I make now.  I did make a few changes after I made it the first time.  I just use half a can of pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin puree and spices (I'm a lazy cook...), I substitute a can of Rotel in place of one of the diced tomatoes (hot or mild depending on how spicy you like), and I double the meat.  I've made it with just beef or with a mix of beef and venison and both were good.  It has become a favorite chili with many people I've fed it to.  I've even had 2 people ask me how to make it so they can enter it in chili cook offs!!

I made some variations but really enjoyed this!  The pumpkin gave it a slight sweet, earthy, warming flavor.  I didn't use meat and it was still great.  I also added extra pumpkin, cumin and chili powder (to taste).

3 out of 4 of us like this. Just the right amount of spice. I pureed the beans into the chili so the kids would have no choice but to eat them. Doesn't change the taste just the look.

I love this recipe! I made it exactly as written and it turned out to have a very nice, spicy flavor. I wonder why people change the ingredients the first time they try a new recipe. How will you know what it really should taste like if you do that? Anyway I  will make this again and I don't think anything needs to be changed.

Disappointing.  I made it as specified.  It was very sweet and not spicy.  I guess it needed more spice for us.  With some tweaking it may be better.

The BEST chili recipe I have ever made. Had it ready in the crock pot for a Halloween party for 7 adults before we took kids out trick or treating. It was a hit with everyone. Like other reviewers, I did not drain the beans, and I modified based on what was in my pantry: Different type of tomatoes instead of fire roasted - so I added paprika. I also accidentally used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and it tasted great. Used ground turkey instead of ground beef. My crock pot was at capacity! Don't be afraid to tweak based on what types of canned goods you have. I don't think you could screw this up. It is delicious.

Pretty good for a change of pace in the fall!! I DID tweak the recipe--no bell pepper b/c we don't like them, no red pepper flakes or chili pwdr b/c I was out. I added paprika, celery salt, & tumeric. I used 2 cans kidney beans & 1 can black beans, & seasoned diced tomatoes (Italian & Chili style).  YUM!!

I thought that this recipe was very good.  However, I did add 1 tsp of sugar just to sweeten it up and next time I will probably add an additional 1/2 lb. of meat.  But overall, surprisingly good since I don't really like pumpkin.

Very good recipe. I used non GMO TVP instead of meat to make it a good vegan chilli. Took it to a friend's house for a mini potluck and it got good reviews.  Really like adding the pumpkin for the nutritional benefits.  Will make this again for sure.

The recipe was tasting really great - right up until the moment when I added the pumpkin pie spices.  They took a very yummy dish to tasting far less good.  I highly recommend leaving them out completely!

This has become our favorite way of making chili. The pumpkin adds the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the chili peppers, fire roasted tomatoes and cumin. I've made two versions of this - a vegetarian one using crumbled, oven baked veggie meat balls, and a meat one for my husband with caribou meat from a caribou he shot 2 years ago on the north slope of the Brooks range in Alaska. Both were a big hit with us and our guests. Most recently, I've made chili fries, and it is now one of my top ten favorite recipes. I cut the potatoes into fries, deep fry, pour chili on top, sprinkle with sharp, shredded cheddar and put in the oven on broil for about 2-3 mins. The result is a kind of "french fry lasagna" - extremely delicious! Makes a perfect side dish, but filling enough for a main dish.

It's amazing that you can't tell there's a giant can of pumpkin in this chili. What a great way to hide extra veggies in your diet. I made it exactly as listed but will change a few things the next time, based on feedback. I'd recommend doubling the meat. We could barely find any in this substantially sized pot. I will also cut back to only one pepper (red). Otherwise, really, really tasty.

Our houseguests enjoyed and complimented the chili.  However, I am a bit of a self-proclaimed chili connoisseur and I had to "doctor" the recipe quite a bit in order to highlight the flavors.  I made my own pumpkin puree from fresh pumpkin.  The pumpkin didn't seem to add much uniqueness to the chili; it actually made it a bit bland.  I will try this recipe one more time with a few more tricks to see if I can get more of a pumpkin/fall flavor out of it.  I like the concept of Pumpkin Chili anyway, so I'm not giving up yet!

this was FANTASTIC!  I added extra black beans.  I also used fresh garlic like someone suggested.  I didn't have tomato paste and it turns out it was thick enough without it.  I used the 15 oz tomato sauce so I wouldn't waste anything and it was still thick.  Saved this recipe and will definitely make this again and again.

I got the inspiration to make pumpkin chili to enter in a recent chili cookoff- I tweeked it a bit- using just a hint of cinamon in place of the pumpkin spice and added some peppers and onions in-  I won first place.  Thanks for the great idea!

Fabulous!!!
I had half a can of leftover pumpkin from the other night and had no clue what to do with it! This was the answer!!!
I cooked mine on the stove top instead of the slow cooker. Used ground turkey instead of beef. Used just one (15 oz) can tomato sauce instead of 2 small ones. Used one can of diced tomatoes with onion & garlic & one low-sodium. Upped the chili powder from 2 teaspoons to 3 and upped the cumin from 1 teaspoon to 1 1/2 and added a couple splashes of hot sauce. Topped it with a small sprinkle of monterey jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream & minced cilantro!!! Earty! Hearty! Tasty!!!

Great recipe! I used ground extra lean turkey and doubled the spices,  and added extra hot chili powder and it was just the right spiciness.  Everyone loved it, super healthy, and didn't need sour cream or cheese at all!

This was great!  I made a few slight changes... I added a chopped jalepeno for some extra spice!  I used turkey instead of beef, so it was a little healthier.  My chili was becoming thicker than I wanted, so I added half a can of chicken broth.  Overall, it was delicious and easy, and I will definitely make again!!

The pumpkin taste and spice was unique, so I might try adding it to a staple chili recipe instead of this one. I prepared the recipe exactly as written, but it was bland and not very spicy. Once finished I added a significant amount more of all the spices, lots of extra beans, and ground chipotle.

Nice change of pace - my non chili eating better half ate and said it's a keeper. I did add more red pepper and chili powder, and used turkey instead of beef.

This pumpkin chilli is delicious! I have never made a pumpkin chilli before so I didn't want to stray too far from the original recipe. I didn't use the ground beef and I added cayenne pepper. I think this is a recipe you could change up a lot and it would still be good. I would definitely reccomend using the fire roasted tomatoes that the recipe calls for because those worked really well in this.

This recipe is awesome! My chili was amazing and all of my neighbors said the aroma was amazing outside of the house! I did add a bit more garlic but other than that I changed nothing. Very Flavorful and filling. The layers of flavors cannot be beat. Any person who says this recipe is bland may simply not be a very good cook. This is certainly a staple for the Harvest season going forward.

This is by far one of the VERY BEST chili recipes I've tried...the flavor is excellent, and you can tone up/down the spiciness by adding/deleting the red pepper flakes and/or cayenne pepper - my boyfriend and I really like the pumpkin in it, as we can definitely detect the texture and the taste - wonderful addition...we also loved the variety of beans in this recipe.  I made it on the stove instead of the slow cooker for fear of disintegrating the ingredients - this is definitely a keeper and we can't wait to make it again - thank you and kudos to the author of this recipe!!!

for my own notes, use extra 1/2 beef.  3 of our homegrown hot peppers and 1 1/2 Tbs chili powder is too much.  I do rinse beans to get rid of some of the sodium.  Add low sodium beef broth and some water to thin out.  Like the pumpkin. Hubby loved it but too hot for me even with dollop of sour cream.

I am a big chili fan and enjoyed this one.  However, I would not describe it as spicy at all.  It wasn't bland, and my friend who dislikes really spicy food enjoyed it and called it "better than regular chili."  I thought the pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin gave it thickness and depth of flavor without making it taste weird.  But I added some habanero salsa to my next helping and enjoyed that even more, so next time I'll add a jalapeno or two.  Overall, it's a nice variation on typical chili, the pumpkin adds some nutrients and thickness, and it's easy to make, so I give it five stars.  It reminds me of another recipe I've made that includes grated sweet potato - I think it's the same idea as the pumpkin, to thicken the chili, but a can of pumpkin is obviously much easier to do.  I left out the mystery tomato sauce/paste, FYI.

Best chili I ever made!  It smelled so good while it was cooking, I couldn't wait to taste it.  The combination of spices is great.  Changes I made: used chili con carne powder instead of just chili powder, ground chicken instead of beef, yellow and orange bell peppers instead of red and green, couldn't find fire roasted tomatoes so used diced tomatoes with onions and lime...and added 1 bunch of thinly cut kale for some added veggie-power.  Delicious!

Loved this. I made it in the dutch oven, instead of the slow cooker. I also followed the magazine recipe and just used (2) 28 oz cans of tomatoes instead of all the smaller cans of sauce and tomatoes. It was much easier.

This soup was awesome!!  We will definitely be having it again.  I wasn't sure how it would be with the pumpkin in it, but it is just very subtle.  We will definitely be having this soup again!

I made this chili following some of the suggestions of other reviewers. The pumpkin gives it a flavor you don't expect from chili and it is so easy to modify to your tastes and your pantry stock. I am making my second pot of it tonight!

I was really excited about this recipe but I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all so it was rather disappointing. Still a great chili base though! I added hot sauce, coriander, and paprika to make it a bit more spicy. Might be better with chunks of pumpkin.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made if several times for potluck dinners and it always gets rave reviews from everyone.  I don't care too much for kidney beans so I switch them out for a mixed bean medley, so there are less kidney beans and it adds chickpeas, which I love.

My entire family loves chili (we make it at least 1x per wk), & this was exceptional! I left out ground beef, for the vegan family members, but even my meat-loving brothers (16 & 24) raved about it! I used black beans seasoned with chilies, so the chili had a little heat. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. Will make again.

Tasty - Liked the pumpkin flavor. Was a little too spicy for my little ones but the adults loved it.  Will make again. It was very thick so I'd add more water or tomato sauce

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but rather added or didn't add what I had like different veggies and less tomatoes. The most important thing in this recipe is the pumpkin puree and spice. I very much liked the different taste of pumpkin in the typical tomato based chili.

Absolutely fantastic!!  I made it as instructed, but threw in another 1/2 teas. more red pepper flakes - we like a little more heat.  The pumpkin is such a great touch - it comes through beautifully, but subtly.  This is going to be a family favorite for sure!

Everyone seemed to really enjoy it at the Halloween party I went to.  I live in Texas, so I added extra chile powder, red pepper, and dried red pepper; also, some Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and a big Jalapeno pepper.  Even still, it could have been spicier; but others said the heat level was just right.  I think a hotter pepper than the jalapeno I used would have been perfect, just a little more kick.  I used cinnamon instead of cumin, just because that is what I had. 

I drained and rinsed beans and was glad, cause I thought the chile was wet enough as it was. 

Served with Cilantro, Cornbread, Monty Jack cheese.

This was great but not was not spicy. I don't like things very spicy but I found that a diced jalapeno and extra chili powder were needed (hence 4 stars instead of 5). I mistakenly did not buy tomato sauce and instead used 6 oz of tomato paste and some water. To make this vegetarian I replaced the beef with an extra can each of kidney and black beans. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great fall/winter chili. The pumpkin gives it a nice flavor. I had mine the next morning on top of scrambled eggs with taco cheese on top. Yum!! I plan on layering it on tortilla chips, smothering it with cheese and melting it in the oven for our football snack..definitely give it a try for a different type of chili!

I made a vegetarian version so I made a couple of small changes to this: 
I used homemade tomato sauce. (where the recipe calls for a 4oz can of tomato sauce, I think it's an error. It's supposed to be tomato paste)  
I added corn. 
I doubled the red pepper and the pumpkin pie spice. 
I substituted vegetarian smart ground for the meat and added some lavendar balsamic when I was sautéing it.

Very tasty.  The pumpkin and spice gave it a nicely different taste.  I didn't add any paste.  I used a regular sized can of diced tomatoes and garlic, rather than a 4 oz can.  I didn't think it was watery at all.  Only thing I added was a small can of green chile peppers because I had them on hand.  Skipped the salt as I thought between the canned beans and tomatoes it wouldn't need it.  It didn't.  Will make again.

Saw in the magazine and was quite intrigued. Had a can of pumpkin puree on the shelf for months....I added some sweet red wine and cocoa powder. I also used dry bean medley (1/2 pound) which I soaked overnight. I needed to extend the slow cooker time to get the beans tender. This is a very amazing chili and we love love love it! I have a lot in the freezer too.

I made this for a Halloween get together at work. Doubled the recipe and stuck pretty much right with it. It was bland and way too tomatoey. I felt this might be the case when I just kept adding tomato products; I should have listened to myself. My co-workers said it was 'good', but this is not the end result I was looking for. Would need many modifications, unless you are not at all interested in spices. It was the very last leftover eaten, by only one person in the home. Thanks for sharing though.

I tried this and it was pretty good, interesting I'd say. But chili is about meat, not beans and tomatoes. Way too many cans of stuff going in this mix, 1 lb of meat should never get more than one can of tomatoes and one can of beans, also dont need the pumpkin spice here. The puree gives the chili a nice texture. 2 teaspoons of chili powder should read "2 tablespoons" at least.

This is by far my favorite chili recipe, and I've used it often when autumn comes around.  It makes the house smell amazing, and everyone loves it.  I often substitute ground turkey for ground beef, but I think I might try an all-vegetarian version by adding another can of beans. 
My family likes very spicy chili, so I usually add 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. of cayenne. 
The recipe is so good and flavorful as-is, you don't need cheese or sour cream.  I usually eat it with some crusty bread.

This is really good! Can't wait to see what this tastes like the next day! A few notes: I added more garlic and substituted one of the cans of reg. petite diced tomatoes with a can of the ones with jalapenos in them. Beware: This makes A LOT so make sure you are definitely using a large crock pot. Also, it takes more than 1-2 hrs for this to get warm on Low. I would say 3-4 hrs on Low. Even so, the red and green bell peppers were a little crunchy. I bet this will be AWESOME tomorrow!

What a great way to add yet another vegetable to a crock pot chili-pumpkin, who knew!? I did tweaked it for my preference: 1) replace the green w/a poblano pepper 2) added 8oz beef chorizo to the ground beef + 3) added 2 tsp unsweetened coco powder to the spices. Definitely will be making this easy + tasty recipes (:

This was delicious!  It makes a pretty presentation with the three different colored beans.  The only thing I did different was to heat in crock pot on high instead of low.  I just felt it needed to simmer a bit.

I made this mostly as written, but did use fresh garlic, 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, and cooked on the stovetop instead of a slow cooker.   I also used ground venison instead of beef, the bold flavors work well with a stronger game meat like venison.  I didn't find this too sweet at all, but will try a little hot sauce on the side.  I really enjoyed and would make again.

This was the first thing that popped up on my feed one Fall day so I decided to give it a try as it sounded different.  It was really good the pumpkin spice and cinnamon gave it a warm taste and the pepper gave it some spice.  The pumpkin gave it a nice texture as well.   I did add some cayenne for a little extra heat and used a fresh pumpkin as they're in season here.  Delicious and will definitely make again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Too much pumpkin and too bland.  If I make it again, I will use half as much pumpkin and a lot more chili powder.  The pumpkin makes the chili a really mushy, thick consistency. Flavor is passable but as mentioned above, truly bland so I added 2 fresh jalapeno peppers and they were barely discernable.  If you like pumpkin pie  with some chili beans stirred into it, you might like this better than I did.  By the way, I'm from Texas where chili is pretty sacred.

This is my probably my favorite chili recipe. I've made it a few times now and every one loves it every time. If I were making it for just myself I would want to up the spice with added spicy chili powder at some cayenne or jalapeños, but as I'm feeding a 4 year old, as written is perfect for her.

I was searching allrecipes.com for ideas for my leftover pumpkin purée.  I never dreamed I’d find chili!  I made this for dinner tonight.  My guinea pig, I mean my husband said it was the best chili he’s ever had :-).  He loved the variety of flavors his very sophisticated taste buds detected.  I’m not sure of the reason for 2 hours in the slow cooker except to allow the flavors to blend, but we were hungry so dug into it after 1.25 hours.  It wasn’t yet warmed through, but it was mighty tasty nonetheless.  This one is going in the ‘favorites’........

I was disappointed and won’t make it again. It turned out to be too tomato saucey. I did replace the beef with turkey and didn’t add as much spice.

I had high hopes for this since it was featured in the magazine, but it wasn't very good. It's pretty bland as written so I spiced it up with some Valentina hot sauce. It still wasn't very good. I would not make it again.

It was ok. There was no spice whatsoever; I had to add 4-5x what was called for (and add paprika and cayenne pepper) to give it any kick. Thanks for the recipe, but I’ll stick to my own.

I made this without the hamburger.  It was still really delicious.  The pumpkin gives it a unique flavor; really nice.  I had some tomato paste left, so I used it instead of the tomato sauce.  That worked just fine.  I served it over broccoli for more volume.

No bell peppers. Still good.  The pumpkin is super. Makes it more like a squash/bean soup. I added shredded chicken precooked in microwave, or boil, and some chicken stock. Delicious. Perfect Fall weeknight dinner. House smelled amazing.

Oddly enough my husband really liked this chili, I didn't think he would because of the pumpkin.  It was a nice twist on traditional chili.  I'll be making it again in the fall.

I liked the subtle taste of the pumpkin. I might try it with ground beef next time instead of ground turkey. It was delicious!! It definitely took longer than 1 to 2 hours to heat up.

Very good, one of my go-to chili recipes. I like the hint of warmth from the pumpkin pie spice and the texture from the puree.

It is not spicy as written so I tend to increase the amount of red pepper flakes and chili powder or use a hot chili powder. I also occasionally add a chipotle chili in adobo for a nice smoky kick.

I only changed two things in this recipe. I did not drain the beans and it made for a soupier chili! Also I added about a teaspoon of adobo sauce. So yummy!

The best chili I've ever had! I do add a pound of chopped cooked bacon to the recipe when I make it. I will also put a tablespoon of the grease in with the chili to give it a bit of added flavor. 
** Update 11/08/17 **
I have made this recipe so many times, and each time it tastes better than the last. Highly recommend it.

I have made this several times now. The only deviation from the recipe is plain tomato sauce rather than flavored (all I could find). This was a fantastic and filling chili. We absolutely love it!  Thank you!

I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand, but I loved it with the pumpkin!  I used a can of Ranch beans, a can of light kidney beans.  My husband does not like too many beans so I stopped there.  I also used a can of Rotel in place of the fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I used the two cans of petite diced tomatoes, but did not feel it needed any of the tomato sauce.  I also added more cumin and chili powder since we like it spicy.  My husband and I absolutely loved it!

Hubby & I  love it! Pumpkin perfection! Will definitely make again. I added a yellow pepper for color & just because I like peppers. I turned down the chili powder & cumin a bit. I always use the 3 prong peppers (male)--better for cooking. The 4 prongs sweeter peppers for salads (female).

It was good but overall the chili was lacking something.  I nearly doubled the spices but still think it needed a punch.   Will try again with more garlic, maybe some nutmeg, and add some pumpkin flavored beer to the base.

I was so intrigued by the pumpkin this recipe calls for that I had to make it. I wasn't disappointed in the least. My husband and grandkids wolfed it down, and hubby took it to work for lunch each day until it was gone. The pumpkin flavor is very subtle and the spices are yummy, but mild enough to be kid-friendly. I made mine in the pressure cooker (Instant Pot) without any trouble at all. I can hardly wait to make this again. Thank you Daisy for a wonderful recipe!

Love the freshness, color, and textures of the bell peppers and triple bean combo, thick creamy mouthfeel from the pumpkin puree, and bit of a spicy kick. Substitute an 11 oz. package of Beyond Meat Crumbles for the ground beef for a delicious vegan version. Offer optional toppings of sliced fresh scallions and vegan sour cream, cheddar shreds, and bacon bits.

I followed the recipe as written.  I thought it came out well.  I did use a bit of crushed red pepper in my individual serving because I wanted a little more heat.  I know what my men think about the recipe by their treatment of the leftovers.  Leftovers were gone the next day.

I think the typo is that the "1 (4 oz) tomato sauce..." is meant to be a 14-oz can.  That is the only size I can find with garlic and chilies.
I thought there was too much "glop" in the background, so I would just omit this can entirely and add another can of beans.  Otherwise tasty and in its gloppy form is great on tortillas.  Adding a bit of cornmeal would soak up some of the liquid and make it more like tamales.

I will make it again and again. I used raw spices clove, cinnamon, a lot of nutmeg and allspice as I did not have pumpkin pies spice. I made my own pumpkin puree since I could not find the cans. I added a little chipotle hot pepper seasoning and topped with cheddar cheese, green onions and Sweet Potatoe Pumpkin chips!

Loved the flavor of this recipe. Cooking the bell pepper with the meat was a very nice touch... the smell made me want to eat that by itself (and I don't normally care for bell pepper). I didn't find it very "spicy" in terms of heat but I did like the sweetness added by the pumpkin (and it's nice and colorful making it a great Halloween food).

Instead of pumpkin puree I blended about a ¼ of a blanched butternut pumpkin. I couldn’t find Great Northern beans anywhere, so blanched ordinary beans. Instead of chilli powder, I finely diced several varieties of uncooked chillies.

This is a great base to any number of variations that can be made from it.  I have a huge number of Chinese eggplants producing in my garden, so I diced some up and added to the onion and pepper fry.  I also used turkey because I didn't have any beef in the freezer!  I added more spice, more garlic... used up some leftover tomato soup from the other night...  etc. etc...  And it came out great.  Use common sense - if it's too thick, add water - too thin add paste.  Oh... and the pumpkin puree I had was fresh. It came out great and even the kids gobbled it up!!  Don't be afraid to experiment. The pumpkin is here more as a paste showing you how incredibly versatile this fruit/veggie can be!

This was OK but didn't appeal to me that I would make it again. I had a lot of pumpkin in the freezer from last year's harvest so gave this a try. But thanks for the submission Daisy.

This is just a phenomenal chili recipe. I thought the number of different kinds of tomatoes was ridiculous, so I just used 8 oz tomato sauce, 1/2 c. salsa, and 3 cans diced tomatoes. I was afraid it would be too spicy, but it was just right. We served it with sour crean, shredded cheddar cheese, sliced green onions, and crushed torila chips on top.

I changed this a lot to suit the ingredients I had on hand (and I always add cocoa powder and a beer to my chili).  So while I can't rate the original, I loved the addition of a can of pumpkin puree!  Ill be using this as a base recipe again.

Just made again for the second time. I believe the review prior to this is correct on the 4oz of paste too. Added one 4oz paste and two cans  (4 oz cans) of water. I'm not able to find 4 oz of the sauce either. It turned out really good again. I purchased a 7qt crockpot and it fits perfect.

This chili was amazing! The only thing that I did differently was omitting the meat, as I'm vegetarian. I used freshly roasted pumpkin, and put in a pinch extra pumpkin pie spice which really brought out the flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly, but left out the red pepper so my kids would try it too.  It was just delicious!!!  A great meal that packs a protein punch!

This was a really great chili.  I made it without beans as I was doing a Paleo thing at the time.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the pumpkin pie spice.  I will make this again and either use way less or skip it altogether and add some cinnamon, clove and nutmeg to my taste.  I don't care much for the flavors of pumpkin pie spice in this chili.  It was nicely spicy as written.  Next time I'll probably add extra red pepper as I love mine very spicy!  Great dish and love getting the pumpkin into the mix!

Love this chili. But of course I had to make a few changes. I added black refried beans and 3 jalapenos. The jalapenos gave it enough fire and the pumpkin added a fall like flavor. Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe! Although I was only cooking for my husband and myself I made  the entire recipe and froze the leftovers in different containers. They'll make delicious cold weather meals when I don't want to cook. BTW I did not find this chili to be too spicy, just very nicely seasoned

This is a good recipe. Followed the recipe using slow cooker.  You certainly couldn't tell there was pumpkin in it but so what?  The spices were interesting.  Good way to get more vegetables in the diet. I steamed one small pie pumpkin to get the puree I needed.  I'll make this again.

It did seem to need something when it was finished, so I added a little tobasco. Then I served it with some fry bread.  No one could tell there was pumpkin in it until I mentioned it. I will definitely make it again.

This was my first attempt at chili and it was yummy. I did change some things to my liking. 
I used a yellow and red pepper, only 1 can of northern beans (cause I don't like too many beans in my chili), 1 6 oz can of tomato paste not sauce  (cause I read it may be a typo). Next time I will also leave out one can of the petite diced tomatoes, cause I think 1 is enough. And I also used turkey instead (1.25) lbs.

Super simple and VERY Yummy! I made a few changes...Sharing is Caring! Instead of the green and rell bell peppers I subsituted 1 jar of fire roasted red peppers and two fresh Poblano peppers. I chopped and seeded the subsitutions peppers and added them to the sauteeing meat mixture. I too doubled the chili powder. I used two generous cups of fresh pumpkin. One hour into the simmering (on the stove vs crock pot) I found the chilli a bit thick and added 2 cups of beef stock! Very hearty and a nice twist on our TexMex usual! Enjoy!

This was nutritious, good and easy to make, but nothing to rave about.  May or not make it again.  If I were to change anything, I would add more spice to kick up the heat a bit.

This was a huge hit at my house! It wasn't too spicy which was great for our 2 year old. My husband and I each added some sriracha to spice it up. I did a few things different based on my tastes and some suggestions from other people:

I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and instead of pumpkin puree I used half a can of pumpkin pie filling, no need for pumpkin spice.  I also used two red peppers because there were no green organic ones, I think it increased the sweetness a bit. I used a whole onion instead of half. Next time I will use just black beans as my daughter was picking those out to eat. 

We will definitely make this again, I'm even making it for our holiday party at work next month :-)

I made this chili the night after Halloween. The taste was good but I did not like the texture. I don't think I will make it again but if I did I would reduce or eliminate the pumpkin. If I just reduced the pumpkin, I would had 1/2 cup of water . Also, it used too many different kinds of beans and tomato sauces. I think I will return to my tried and true Better Homes and Gardens Chili recipe which is my standby.

Substituted ground turkey for ground beef and added turmeric and a little ceylon cinnamon and it was some of the best chili I have ever made.  My pumpkin-hating family was completely unaware that the chili had pumpkin in it.

Yum! This was great! Sweet and spicy. Bold and filling. I added 3 tbs of brown sugar to make it a little sweeter and bring out the pumpkin flavor.

During the slow cooking phase, I tasted this as it cooked. The taste changes were interesting. From Pumpkin with a hint of chilli to chili with a hint of pumpkin. Final taste was a well blended savory taste of chili and pumpkin. I give this 4.0/5.0. Very easy to prepare. A definite new fall classic.

Doubled it.  Added dark chocolate for complexity and simmered it on low for a few hours.  No need to make dirty pans.  Mixed it all up in one big, heavy pot.  Half goes in the freezer,half for Halloween dinner!  Can't really taste the pumpkin and pie spice but they add to the richness and thicken it.  I didn't use paste as was suggested.  Just the tomatoes forms I had on hand.  Used a Walla Walla sweet onion.

Followed others' suggestions to add a bit of brown sugar and smoked paprika (gave it a great smokey flavor). Resulting taste and texture were great -- a bit too spicy for my daughter, but an almost ideal match of spiciness and sweetness.

I decided to give this recipe a whirl.  It seemed to be really tasty and it met all of my expectations!  It packs a lot of flavor.  I added more onions to mine and did not include the great northern beans.  I did add my red pepper flakes to it because I like spicy foods.  I really enjoyed this dish and I have been sharing it with my friends.

I'm considering trying to make a cheese dip using the base of this chili.

This one's a keeper!  I like pumpkin in everything but I was a little nervous about serving this to my family.  They loved it.  I changed a bit based on what I had on hand - I know some reviewers don't like when you do this, but when you live far from the grocery store, that's how you cook and why I love the reviews on this site.  I used crumbled apple sausage that my husband buys at the local farmer's market instead of ground beef.  Didn't use any tomato paste but used the sauce.  Allrecipes Magazine said to omit the sauce, but I found it was needed for moisture and great flavor, too.  I had some fresh roma tomatoes I had to use up instead of canned diced, and put in a tiny bit of chili pepper in adobo for heat instead of red pepper flakes (being careful to de-seed them.)  Next time I won't rinse the beans.  My chili started to dry out a little, so I added a bit of water.  Delicious!  No need for cheese, it's marvellous on its own.  Thank you Daisy K.

I found this recipe in the Allrecipes magazine and decided to try it.  I made the changes suggested in the article and it turned out wonderfully!  A light pumpkin "fall" flavor with lots of chili pizazz.  My family devoured this one and I'll make it again.  It tastes like a restaurant-quality chili.

I made this chili in hopes of having a new chili recipe to make for a chili cook-off coming up.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used two cans of chili beans, medium, in place of the 3 different kinds.  While it tasted OK, it was definitely NOT spicy and not chili cook-off ready. I may try it again, but I will be upping the spice alot.  My kids did not care for the pumpkin spice, but other than that they also thought it was ok.  Still looking for a great "spicy" pumpkin chili.

Adding some canned pumpkin to any chili recipe is amazing.  It gives it a slightly sweeter taste, thickens it up, and makes it more healthy!  It's a win, win, win!

This was so good. Didn't have peppers so I left them out, also I used the beans I had. Also, didn't have any fire roasted tomatoes so I added chili tomatoes. My husband had 3 bowls, defiantly went over well.

This recipe was so delicious! We loved it.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and we added crushed up tortilla chips and shredded cheese.  It was so good.  Next time, I am going to use shredded chicken to give it a mexican twist.  YUM

Big surprise we liked it so much. Grew many pumpkins this summer and wanted a main dish using pumpkin.
While leery about pumpkin pie spice I found it added a subtle flavor.
I doubled all the other spices.

Overall this was pretty good but not great. A little less tomato and a little more heat could not hurt.

I made the recipe as directed.  My chili was very thick and failed to heat up on high in the slow cooker for 1.5 hours.  I think it was too thick.  My husband complained there was not enough meat in it.  The taste was good otherwise.  I would try this recipe again only using some of the variations recommended.  The presentation was beautiful!!  I'm thinking about making it as a vegetarian chili as well and adding corn.

This chili turned out good, I was nervous about how the pumpkin and the pumpkin spice would taste so I didn't put as much in.  I think next time I will do the whole amount and definitely spice it up.  Over all it was good but I prefer a lot of heat.  
This would be great for family night, I'm sure all the kids would love it.

We really like the sweet flavor the pumpkin & pie spice add to this.  For a little kick I added about 1/4 Cup Mrs. Renfro's Ghost pepper salsa - very hot stuff.  I also added a little more chili powder than the recipe called for.

Oh my gosh this was fantastic! I too used 2 fresh cloves of garlic in place of the minced and omitted the can of Great Northern Beans. I served it in a pumpkin  with crusty rolls on the side and it was an absolute hit! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was a big hit at a recent Halloween party I attended.  The parents and kids loved it.  The recipe is super simple and the taste and aroma of the pumpkin was fantastic.  Its a very healthy dish and one that I will sure make again.
