This was easy to make, and tasted really good. I may cut back next time on the apple cider vinegar, just because we  really tasted it, more so than the other flavors. But we still enjoyed it alot! I used one jumbo jalapeno and the heat was just right, and also used frozen raspberries. (The fresh ones at the store looked awful!) Made this to go on grilled chicken sandwiches with jalapeno havarti cheese, and this sauce complimented it nicely! Think it'd be great over a block of cream cheese with crackers, and can't wait to try it on other meats. Thanks Holly :)

This turned out awesome. Although I did use raspberry preserves rather than fresh and just eliminated the sugars and sauce. I poured it over cream cheese and served with crackers. Yum!

I've been looking for an easy Raspberry Chipotle sauce and this one made the list.  As suggested by a previous review I cut back on the vinegar and the results were very good.  We have enjoyed this with Salmon and pork but our favorite is with a nice grilled steak, cut into strips and the Raspberry Chipolte sauce lightly drizzled over.  For a special presentation, drizzle the sauce in a swirled pattern on the serving dish and place grilled steak strips on top. Steamed rice and a veggie makes a beautiful service. Very tasty, too!

Although I did not follow the recipe exactly - I have gotten nothing but raves!! I used an 18oz jar of raspberry preserves, two cloves of garlic and 1 large jalapeno pepper, 1 tablespoon olice oil, and 1/2 tsp of chipotle chili powder.  I sauteed the jalapenos and garlic in the oil until soft and added the rest and heated through.  Served over cream cheese with crackers.  DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is really good. The only thing I did different is that I added some chipotle peppers instead of jalepenos. It is a big hit over cream cheese or even over a pork roast. Very good!!!

This sauce is amazing!  Exactly like what they serve at So Long Saloon on my favorite Raspberry Chipotle Black Bean dip.  It may sound like a strange combination of flavors but it is so amazing!  Like one of the other reviewers, I used raspberry jam and left out the sugars and some of the vinegar.  It is quicker this way and you don't have all the raspberry seeds in the sauce!

This was great! I halved the recipe and used chipotle peppers instead of jalapenos. I also took out the sugar entirely, it's unnecessary calories when the raspberries are sweet enough!

Awesome.  Hubby was spreading it on bread and everything he could get his hands on as soon as the batch was done.  Made it yesterday to go with pulled pork soft tacos tonight.  Just tasted it with the pork as it came out of the slow cooker and it's going to go well!  I followed advice of others and reduced the vinegar (by half) and the white sugar significantly.

I never heard or ate this until a home product party and the organization was selling bottles of it.  I loved it but figured home-made would be better.  I substituted the jalapeno for a 7 oz can of chipotles in adobo sauce.  Since they came whole, I gave them a chop in the mini-prep.  I added the entire can (sauce and all) which gave it more spice then I was looking for so, next time I will use less.  I also used red wine vinegar because that is what I had.  This turned out really good!  I served it over cream cheese and with salmon.  YUM!!

I made it to the recipe specs except I added a teaspoon more of the adobo sauce for extra heat.  This sauce was amazing!! We used it as a dipping sauce for pork chops. I also used the left over sauce as a spread with mayonnaise on a ham sandwich. Flavor bomb!  This will be made again.

I did not have any jalapenos but otherwise I  followed the recipe and loved it.  I purchase a similar sauce at Costco and have wanted to find a recipe since Costco calls it a seasonal item.  I used it as a basting sauce for barbecued pork chops and it was delicious.  Works great on beer-butt-chicken as well.  Thanks for sharing.

Actually a chipotle pepper is a smoked jalapeño. The addition of the adobo sauce (which is what chipotle peppers are packed in) gives it the smokey chipotle flavor without packing all of the heat from one of the peppers.

I could not get my favorite commercial raspberry/chipotle sauce, so I tried this recipe.  I followed the shortcut of others and used a jar of raspberry preserves and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  I sautéed the minced garlic cloves and the chopped peppers and then added the preserves.  the flavor is good, but next time I will cut back on the garlic.  I am going to use it on a pork tenderloin tonight, brushing it on the last 15 minutes of cooking, and serving some as a dipping sauce.

this sauce is really tasty and versatile...in addition to the savory dishes mentioned, my brother likes it on chocolate cake and has used it as a topping for ice cream, too.

am adding half a bag of fresh cranberries to a batch for thanksgiving dinner.

I had no idea...I was worried having never made anything like this. I'm not a novice...just haven't done much in the way of fruit and hot. Turned out great. I did sub Splenda for the white sugar...and added a couple chipotle peppers w/ their adobo sauce as well as the jalapeno. Sweet, mediumly hot, savory...quite a combination. I put a cheese sauce on Naan, diced zucchini, cooked seasoned chicken thighs with Goat Brie slices/pieces on top. The last thing was dollops of the sauce. Turned out exceptional.

Really good!! Use this to top waffles for breakfast and then chicken and waffles for dinner. It goes with anything. I used chipotle peppers instead of jalapeños and cut down on the sugar. I also made a batch using cranberries. This will go perfectly with some turkey and dressing!

I made this to accompany Jimmy Dean Sausage Cheese Balls from this site.  I took it to a church gathering and people were raving about this sauce.  I did as others had suggested and used the chipotle peppers in place of jalepeno peppers. I did everything else just as the recipe says.   I can't wait to try this on salmon.  My husband used it on left over chicken tonight just because there was some left over.  I will be using this for several things in the future.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I left out the jalapeños and just the peppers from the Adobo sauce.   A touch of honey helped cut down the heat.  Will definitely make again!

Like many others I used chipolte peppers instead of jalapeno, reduced the vinegar and sugar.  I pressed the sauce through a mesh seive to remove the seeds and served baked on salmon.  This highlighted the fresh raspberries and was enjoyable but just didn't have the balance of flavors to be a keeper for us

Used a combination of chipotle peppers and canned jalapenos.  Also cut the vinegar a bit.  Delicious with grilled yams (sweet potatoes) and a little bit of light sour cream!
