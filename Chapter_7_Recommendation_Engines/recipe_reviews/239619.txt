Good starter recipe and an excellent use of cauli rather than taters. I steam the cauliflower and then shock in cold water so it doesn't get mushy. I also prefer a bit more spice in my salad. You can also sub in Greek yogurt for 1/2 or all of the mayo for an even healthier take!

This is a delicious recipe to add to your menu even if you're not on a low-carb diet! I will admit, I was serving only 2 people, so I made only half the "sauce" and used only 2 eggs, but I did use more than half my cauliflower. (What's the standard size of a cauliflower anyway?) I used the "taste as you go" policy. Definitely a keeper and a recipe I will make again and again.

It is an excellent cauliflower salad. I steamed my cauliflower and then shocked it in cold water as another reviewer did so the cauliflower doesn't become mushy. 4 eggs is too many for one head of cauliflower unless you happen to find one of gargantuan size. I found 3 to be sufficient. The dill relish really makes this, I can't stand sweet pickles or sweet relish, and the dill relish gives it the kick it needs along with the mustard. I had made this quite some time ago after seeing the recipe posted on Facebook. I'm glad to see it here, to be able to review a very good recipe.

This was just amazing really.  I love raw cauliflower, but not a huge fan of cooked.  However, I tried it, since I had a head, and then, after seeing the recipe, a "craving" for potatoe salad.  It was pretty darned good, took care of the "gotta have its", and I felt I could indulge with another small serving since it was low carb.  Remember to make ahead & chill for several hours before serving, so the favors meld.  I used bread & butter pickles tho, since I like "sweet", they were all I had in the pantry AND, we're snowed in.  HTH!!!           Blessings!!

Too much egg for my taste.  Made it 2nd time with 1/2 the eggs and loved it! 3rd time I added diced celery and onion instead of green onions, and loved it even more.  Hubby enjoyed it too!

I LOVE this fauxtato salad!  Not only is it lower in carbs it is also EASIER and FASTER to make than potato salad!  Cauliflower cooks and cools so much faster than potatoes, and you'll never ever miss the taters.  I've been making this once a week!  Hubby loves it too!  Tastes better the next day!

Really loved this with little changes. I didn't have relish so I used chopped green pepper...little less mustard.....and red onion.  Was wonderful!!  5 minutes for cauliflower was perfect. Put in frig then in freezer for few minutes. Next time I could shock it in cold ice water.  But, it worked perfectly.

Great recipe, the taste was similar to deviled eggs. The four eggs did make it a lot more yellow than expected though. Took a bit longer to steam until tender, and extra mush might actually handy for texture. Great recipe for Atkins low-carb dieting or anyone!

This faux-tato salad is just fabulous! I've been looking for some new ideas for cauliflower, and this is such a winner! So tasty you won't miss the potatoes at all :-) One teensy little suggestion I would make is to chop the cauliflower into pieces a bit smaller than bite-sized. It just seems to taste better this way. But of course, it's very subjective to taste.

We really liked this salad and made 2-3 times already. I am also sharing it with family and friends. I added a little more mayo because that is how we like our potato salad.

Perfect!
the only change I made was to make it easier, I microwaved the cut up cauliflower instead of steaming. it worked very well that way. Just rinse in cool water when done to stop the cooking, and drain it well.

Excellent recipe.! Tastes just like potato salad, but is a great way to sneak in the veggies (especially for kids). Don’t steam the cauliflower for more than 5 mins or it will become mushy. And I shocked it in ice cold water after steaming and drained.  I mixed the other ingredient in a separate bowl, then added to the cauliflower. I added 1/2 of a regular sweet onion (had no green at the time) and 1 and 1/2 tbsp green sweet pepper (both diced fine) and a few dashes of paprika. I used 1 tbsp of sweet relish  instead and added 1 tsp of Dijon grain mustard with the 1 tbsp of yellow mustard. It was so good!

Amazing potato salad alternative. I’m doing keto so no potatoes for me. I was kind of iffy bc I don’t typically enjoy eating the cauliflower substitutes for potatoes (such as cauliflower mash). All the other ingredients worked great together and it wasn’t missing the potatoes. I love boiled eggs so we did use all 4. This was even better the next day after it had sat overnight in the fridge.

This is a great recipe for low carb people.  I miss potato salad and this is a great replacement!  I added bacon and replaced the green onions with sweet red bell peppers. I’m eating for lunch this week and it gets better with each day!! I highly recommend!

I’ve made this twice, including as a side (that ended up being very popular) for the 4th of July. The first time, I made exactly as is but with half the eggs as some reviewers suggested, and it was very good. The second time, I used 3 eggs, extra dill relish, some bacon, and red onion for some extra crunch and flavor, and loved it even more. I steamed the cauliflower much longer and found I liked it better softer. Also, this is more delicious the next day after the flavors have more time to meld. My husband likes it cold, and I like it slightly warm. Thanks for a great recipe so we can enjoy “potato” salad again while on keto!

I'm always lookn for cauliflower & broccoli recipes, and with the summer right around the corner I have been thinking summer dishes...and this is a KEEPER! 
I always read reviews and take notes from what others have said, one thing I did was after putting the cauliflower in my steamer I lightly salted it & the cold water bath after steaming is a step you wint be sorry you did...I like others used zesty bread and butter pickles in place of the dill relish...
My husband loves it too!

I made it by the recipe and it was delicious but you can go crazy with your favorite potato salad ingredients and it will be really yummy. I love egg in potato salad but you may want to cut back if you don't. I make two bowls when I make it. One that has Miracle Whip and sweet relish for the sweet toothed ones and the Mayo and dill for myself. Any kind of onion will work, and I enjoy some chopped celery and bacon bits in mine!

This recipe has a lot of potential, but the way it's written here doesn't quite cut it for me. First, I steamed the cauliflower for over 8 minutes, and I should have let it go longer. The cauliflower is very crunchy. I loved the egg-to-cauliflower ratio. I added more mayo because half-cup just didn't cover all the cauliflower - and heads of cauliflower can vary widely in size, so that's  to be expected. I used chives instead of green onion because that's what I had, and I ended up adding about 4 tablespoons of chopped chives because the salad just didn't have much flavor. Same with the mustard, salt, and pepper. I will try again, but I'd steam the cauliflower longer and experiment with adding more flavor because this recipe was just a little too bland for me.

This was really good. I don't think anyone would mistake it for potato salad because the texture is so different. I thought the dressing was perfectly balanced and exactly how I like my potato salad. Using all 4 eggs gives it a better mouth feel and makes the right texture and flavor. It's more moist and refreshing than potato salad. Our family thinks this one is a keeper.

Very good.  Added some left-over green peas, which I would do again.  Think adding cashews would be very good.

I'm not a big fan of potato salad. This was fine for us. My boyfriend who really likes potato salad said this is just as good. I will definitely make it again for him.

Great low carb alternative. My wife is a potato salad fanatic and it received her approval. I only used 3 eggs, added an extra tbsp of relish and a dash of cayenne pepper. Going to try adding black olives next time.

Turned out good! I like sweet potato salad so I added a little stevia to this recipe. Will make again

Delicious!  Added chopped red onion (instead of green onions) and celery.  Used about double the amount of yellow mustard.  I used a stick blender to emulsify  8 oz of cottage cheese with 4 tablespoons of flax seed oil instead of using mayo. Flax seed oil is mild and nutty and so much healthier than mayonnaise. The extra ten minutes to mix it to a buttery cream sauce in cottage cheese was well worth it!  Sounds gross, but give it a try. Your body will thank you for the Omega 3s

It was bland, bland, bland.  Added hot giardiniera.  That raised it to 'ok'.  Finally added some lemon juice and and it's better  but I doubt I'll be making it again.

Great recipe!  Followed the directions as listed.  Used "light" mayonnaise and sea salt.  It's important to not overcook the cauliflower as others have said, however the taste remains delicious!

Since I am on a lpoo w carb diet to lose some weight, so I thought I would go e it a try. This salad was terrible. Maybe I didn't get all the water out of the cauliflower, because it came out to watery. Will not make this again.

I steamed the cauliflower in my microwave, cooled it and then proceeded with my regular recipe. Since I like Miracle Whip and sweet pickle relish there were a few carbs in my salads. Definitely less than regular potato salad. It was very flavorful on the second day, also.

Tried this last night for dinner.  It tasted like the potato salad my family likes.  All gone!
