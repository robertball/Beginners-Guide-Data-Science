These were very good!! I deducted one star because I feel the recipe needs more flavor as is. I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, some cajun seasoning, garlic, and onion powder.

Perfect. Like any recipe you make adjustments for taste and preferences. I added some onion and old bay spice. I didn't have crackers so I used breadcrumbs. Delicious. I also added some minced garlic.

Really good recipe! I added some seasonings to the liquid mixture before adding it to the cracker/crab mix. I also put some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix. Really yummy!

These are so tasty. Mine look a little burnt, but they really aren't. I fried in coconut oil instead of canola oil. YUM!!! Will be making again!

These were good. I ended up having to use another half of a sleeve of the crackers to get them to hold together but that was the only problem I had as written. Instead of using hot sauce I will try adding Old Bay next time. I like hot sauce but it just added more liquid. These were very pretty because you could see the red from the crawfish popping through.  These would make a great presentation for when you are having company.

Wonderful recipe! The only change I made was omitting the hot sauce and adding some creole seasoning. A little ketchup mixed with horseradish on the side and a fresh salad made a great dinner. Yum!
