This was not only delicious, but a work of art, as well. There are several discrepancies, however. A puff pastry sheet would barely cover the bottom of a 10 inch pie dish- I had to transfer it to an 8 inch pie dish. I used one large chopped onion and an 8 oz. package of baby portobello mushrooms, and when mixed with the 8 oz. package of cream cheese it filled the 8 inch pie. I didn't need the yolk and milk mixture on top-it had a very nice sheen on the lattice-it looked beautiful, and the flavor was wonderful.

I made this as a vegetarian option for Christmas Eve. Rather than using puff pastry for both crusts, I used puff pastry for the bottom and 6 sheets of filo pastry for the top crust.  In addition, I used a herb/garlic cream cheese for more flavor.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.

I served this with a rib roast for Christmas and everyone who tried it loved it! The lattice pattern made the tart look really attractive and appealing next to the rib roast AND it tasted great!  I would definitely recommend it.

This is DELICIOUS. A great meat alternative at family dinners for those complicated vegetarians in my life. Thank you for providing something I can cook for them that doesn't make me want to shove meat down their throat!

A bit time consuming for the average weeknight meal.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in individual-sized dishes.  After baking the crust, I added the mushroom mixture to the crust without chilling it.  The texture of the crust was slightly off as a result but it still tasted delightful and my husband gobbled it down.

I made this last night. A hit! I tweaked it a bit. I used half button mushrooms and half eggplant. Then, I used Neufchatel cheese (trying ri reduce a few calories).

Only gave it 4 stars because it is a big labor intensive for anyone who cannot be on their legs too long.  Beyond that it is delicious.

Had company for luncheon yesterday and did this.  Out of this world, even my meat-eating husband loved it.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Just be sure to make enough as they'll be back for seconds.  I made half the recipe, but used the whole package of puff pastry because I had the wrong sized pan, but it didn't make a difference.
