I used a 2 pound roast, left it in the crockpot all day on low (about 10 hours). I substituted chicken broth that I had leftover from boiling some chicken breasts instead of the water. Anytime I have leftover homemade broth, I ALWAYS sub  that for water or canned broth. Turned out great, and plenty of leftovers to use for BBQ beef sandwiches, or chimichangas, or whatever else!

Even on high it took more than 4 hours to become tender, so expect that possibility.  As it had not been reviewed yet, I asked the family and pretty much everyone thought it was just Ok.

Good! I put a cup & a half of green chili salsa also. Made a lot of meals out of it.

No need to add that much water in our experience.  1/4 C would be plenty in the crock pot.  We ended up putting it through a strainer to get rid of the excess water.  We did add about 1 t cumin as another recommended and it added the extra "something" that was needed.  Otherwise, it was "Ok" but not super special.
