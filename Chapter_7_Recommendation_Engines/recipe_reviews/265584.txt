This is a delicious stew. I followed the instructions but it seemed very thick when I started to close the lid; so I added an extra cup of water. I’m glad I did. I cooked it for 10 minutes and found it had started to burn. So, adjust water before cooking. The flavor is fantastic. Thank you.

Made this according to recipe. As another person mentioned I got the burn warning before the pressure built. I removed the lid, scraped the bottom, replaced the lid, and the burn warning came back on shortly after. I scraped the bottom once more, replaced the lid and ignored the warning when it came back on again shortly after that. I let it cook the full time and let pressure release naturally. All the veggies were thoroughly cooked. Not sure how to avoid the burning. As another user mentioned, the liquid was really thick so that may have been part of the problem. Perhaps adding the peanut butter at the end may help. Also, the seasoning was a little light for my taste. Overall, we thought it was alright but would tweak the recipe if I made it again.

The flavor was quite good and everyone enjoyed it. My main issue was the Instant Pot kept giving me a Burn notice and wouldn’t come to pressure. I think it was because the liquid was too thick. We restarted it a couple of times and finally added some vegetable stock to thin it out. If I try the recipe again I would add the peanut butter at the end after pressure cooking.

I Made this as my first go in my new instant pot. I made a couple of changes with it. I Sautéed some chicken first and set it aside then continued with the recipe. Instead of adding collard greens I  added the chicken pieces (small) back in after the stew finished gave it a bit of time to heat the chicken then served it with crunchy French bread. Yummy!

Because of other comments about 'Food Burn' warnings, I did not add the peanut butter until after the Instant Pot had depressurized, adding it at the same time as the greens.  Since we don't like collard greens, I used a 10 oz bag of baby spinach instead.
Other than these two minor modifications, I followed the recipe exactly.
We found this dish delicious, but I think next time I make it (and I will make it again for sure) I will double the spices.

My husband, and our friends love when I make this! This is my go to meal when I want something good but simple...I also serve with rice when I feel like something a bit heartier.

Delicious. I used a smaller quart instapot (4 quart) and I needed to slim down the recipe, but it’s got amazing flavor.

This was Awesome! I had my doubts if my spouse was going to like this, but he loved it and took leftovers to work and said it was even better the next day. We served this with fried corn sticks, a recipe found on this site. I did make changes to the corn sticks, but the two recipes went great together

Family is on a Daniel fast so trying new things and we loved it! I added a little Olive oil when cooking veggies and added a little extra salt and cayenne pepper. We like spicy! I did have to add extra water and this is def a dish that does not have to be done in a pressure cooker If you cut your potatoes into 1/4 inc discs and then each in quarters. The smell when all the seasonings combine is divine and even better the next day. We ate ours over a little brown rice so three adults ate on it for dinner and there is still plenty left for lunches or dinner tomorrow.

I added a can of great northern beans.  I would add more sweet potato next time.  Child and hubby thought was so-so.
