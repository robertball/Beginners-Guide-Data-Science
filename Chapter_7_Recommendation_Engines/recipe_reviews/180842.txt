This is excellent thank you for sharing! Much easier to make it than look for a store that sells it.

This bread is amazing! My husband is Jamaican and Loves it! The second time I made it I added a little more raisins and added in some spiced Jamaican rum. The Spiced Rum made it even better! I absolutely recommend this recipe!

I made this for friends of mine & they said it was 10 times better than the bun they get overcharged for at their local jamaician stores! I added diced cherries as well.  :D

This recipe was a true hit. I made it on Easter. I'm not a baker but this bun came out moist, and authentic. If you put it in a large bunt pan you have to bake it for 2 hours. Great job Tanya!!

Thank you Tanya for sharing.  This was a moist bun...not dry like the ones in the store.
Being the "health nut" that I am, I substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I used creamer instead of milk and I added 1 tsp of dark rum (as someone else had mentioned).  I think the next time I make this (next week) I will use Guinness Stout instead of the beer.  Ate it with sharp cheddar cheese. Yummy.
I was able to make 2 loaves which filled the loaf pans about 3/4.

So delicious! Followed the recipe exactly but I put 1 1/4 cups of brown sugar by accident. Still tasted great!
