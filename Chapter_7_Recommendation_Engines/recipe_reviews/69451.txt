Very nice! Next time I might try Italian dressing instead of the olive oil. Thank you!

Instead of green bell pepper, I used another red bell pepper. My cucumber was on the larger side. I took bellydancer's suggestion and added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for a little tartness. I thought this was great, though it is quite heavy on the feta. Next time, I'd cut it in half.

I made this last night and my friends liked it a lot.  I added a few shakes of Italian seasoning and a little pour of balsamic vinegar (just to taste).  Excellent salad, very light and very easy to make.  Yummy.  I will make this again.

A great alternative to other summer salads. I usually throw in a bit more feta cheese when I make this than what the recipe calls for and the leftovers last a while! Great healthy choice we'll keep for a long time to come.

I would have to rate this a five, even though I added way less feta and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  I'm sure I would love it with all of the feta, but I'm trying to eat lighter and healthier.  I didn't have a yellow pepper, but will definitely add it next time!

Lovely, tasty, fresh.  I used 2 Tbsp EVOO and 1 TBSP balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp honey, pinch of salt, fresh ground black pepper, and some oregano.  Added a small amount of black olives for colour and flavour.  Really hit the spot!

Wonderfully simple refreshing salad to go along with our grilled chicken. I made this up earlier in the day with all the ingredients listed, but did add some black olives and fresh garden cherry tomatoes. I made the lite Italian dressing on all recipes to go with it. The Feta cheese is a great addition, don't leave it out.

I thought the feta would be too much so I cut the amount by about 1/2...BIG MISTAKE! First thing requested was more feta, I used the advice of another cook and added a T or so of balsamic vinegar and it was fabulous! I will make this in a regular rotation of salad choices. This was a hit with everyone!

Very good salad. Only thing I did differently was to add some sliced carrots, cherry tomatoes and olives.

This was fantastic! A great side dish for grilled chicken. I only had 4 oz of feta on hand, but that seemed like a perfect amount for me.

I added a bit of avocado and tomatoes to the salad.  Everything else about the salad was the same except for the dressing.  I used the salad dressing from Greek Salad I Recipe here on allrecipes.  It was incredibly flavorful and really refreshing.  I would do again exactly the same way.

Light, easy, delicious. I didn't have the yellow pepper, but it was fine with red, green, and cucumber.

I loved this! I had to use dried parsley, as my little plants have barely spouted any. I used less cheese, and added in 1 orange bell pepper, too.

So good and easy.  I used allred peppers and just 6 oz low fat feta as that is what I had on hand- could definitely use the full 8 oz of feta though as I did not think it was too much as others said.  In fact, I never liked feta until I tried this salad!  I used about 2 TB fat free Italian dressing and couple dashed of balsamic vinegar in place of the olive oil to cut back calories.  I might try it with some fresh basil in addition to the parsley next time.  Really really good.  Especially good served over romaine or spinach as a great lettuce salad.

Very tasty and equally quick to make salad. I made it with Heirloom Peppers and Heirloom Cukes. Very pleased with the way it tasted and the way it looked. Almost like Christmas!

My sister in law brought this salad over for a get together and she used red, orange, and yellow peppers.  And Kraft Three cheese dressing instead of the oil. It was delicious.

I really loved this salad. If you like each of the ingredients individually, you'll like the way they taste together! I followed others' advice and added Italian dressing instead of olive oil, and omitted the parsley (because I didn't have any). So good.
