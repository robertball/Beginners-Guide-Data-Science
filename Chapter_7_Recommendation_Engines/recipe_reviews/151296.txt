Nice, light dip for fruit... like another reviewer, liked to find a fruit dip without marshmallow.  Used low fat and still tastes great!  Thanks!

Very easy and PERFECT for strawberries!  I loved having a fruit dip option that didn't have any marshmallow creme.  Thank you!

Wow, really good!! Creamy, refreshing goodness; great choice over the usual party snacks. I used reduced-fat cream cheese and non-fat milk. Adding a touch more sugar is safe if serving with tart apples. Try putting a dash of cinnamon in a side bowl of it to see if you like that added flavor. Enjoy!

Yum!  Bf made a fruit salad today and I wanted a dip to go with it.  So easy and quick, and I, too, am glad it doesn't call for marshmallow creme, something I've never had and would never think to purchase.  Went well with the fruit salad, which had bananas, apples, mangos, kiwi, strawberries, and peaches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic dip for fruit! It is not too sweet and works beautifully with crisp apples. Everyone asked me for the recipe (which was easy enough to share) when I took this for a picnic not too long ago. The kids loved it.

Good :). Didn't know marshmallows were sold in a cream lol so, glad to find this as I had these ingredients except for the sour cream.  But I did have an 8 oz. container of thick plain Greek yogurt which turns out has similar flavor to sour cream, and it turned out just fine.

I wanted a healthy snack that seems more decadent than perhaps it is. This dip, coupled with a generous plate of various bite-sized pieces of fruit, did the trick. SO delicious! I liked the recipe so much just as is, I was hesitant to add anything more (you know that old adage "if it ain't broke don't fix it)  However, after I got to delight in this delish snack for a couple days, I went ahead and dressed the last bit of it up with a shake of cinnamon. I'll do that from the start next time.

Simple,  sweet but not too,  great on any fruit for a sweet treat, and Bless YOU for a recipe without  Marshmallow cream! Have hated that stuff  since I was  little. Love Marshmallows for  campfires but that goop in a jar NO!!  I prefer natural ingredients and real sugars to that  goop any day.

JUST made this (and it's not even had a chance to chill) and it is already YUMMY!!  A wonderful alternative to all those marshmallow-y dips.  This has a pleasant sweetness with just a hint of tang to it.  Delicious!!!!
