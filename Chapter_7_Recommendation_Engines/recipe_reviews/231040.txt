I made this for dinner tonight. Usually, my husband doesn't like my salmon patties, but tonight he ate two and put away two for his lunch. I tripled the recipe because I had a 14 oz can of salmon. I didn't change anything else. I did make the dill sauce about 5 hours ahead of time so the flavors could mix well and that seemed to work out fine. I would make these again.

I make salmon patties quite often and don't use a recipe.  I followed this to the letter except for adding a little chopped red bell pepper which I had on hand.  The ingredients are pretty much the same as I typically use, and I never use mayo.   I found the breadcrumbs overpowered the salmon flavor, and I use a very high quality canned salmon.  I would use fewer  breadcrumbs, just enough to hold the patties together.  I mixed up the sour cream-dill sauce, tasted it, and thought it was fairly bland, so I added a little seasoned salt and some lemon zest.  Don't really mean to knock this recipe because we did enjoy it but, honestly, didn't find it to be anything out of the ordinary, pretty much the same as I've been making for years.

I tripled this dish so I could use one 14.5 oz. can of salmon. Cut back the Dijon mustard by 1/3, cut back the bread crumbs (I used the grocery store's not homemade) by 1/3, and add sufficient mayonaise (Hellman's preferred) to create salmon patties that are easily shaped and hold together; otherwise these patties are simply too dry.

Love the recipe, but I did make a couple of tweaks to try to make it even healthier.  I used Ener-G Egg Replacer in lieu of the whole egg (I had it on hand, but egg whites would work, too), reduced the breadcrumbs by a tad, and used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of low-fat sour cream.  I also added more dill and a bit of lemon zest. With or without the tweaks, the recipe is solid!

I have to add one other tip that I didn't use for this particular recipe but that I often use for my salmon patties: the magic of the waffle iron!  We love, love, love how crispy the waffle iron makes the patties and just use a little olive oil spray to keep them from sticking. Try it!  I think you'll be surprised!

I make this for my clients and their guests all the time and they absolutely LOVE IT and it is so easy to make . My clients have me make the dill sauce fresh for them every week as they use it to dip fresh veggies in . It's quick , it's easy and very filling and most especially easy on the wallet !!!

I am in love with this recipe. So easy, quick, and great for a weeknight fancy meal. My fiance is not a fish person, and even he loved this dish! This recipe is probably designed to feed one person! I used a 15 oz can of salmon and tripled all the ingredients. We ended up having about 3 patties each plus steam veggies and had enough leftovers (2/each) for lunch the next day.

Loved this recipe! I used sea salt and pepper potato chips instead of breadcrumbs and added a dash of Scorpion pepper powder. For the dill sauce, I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. I made extra dill sauce as you recommended and had extra, so I mixed my albacore in it the next day and stuffed it in some tomatoes with more potato chips crumbled on top and broiled those babies! 
Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will definitely be making again...like, tomorrow!

Two stars because the dill sauce was delicious.  The salmon patty was bland, dry and totally uninteresting.  I think there is way too much bread crumb in this recipe. The sauce recipe was scrumptious.  I later substituted the dill with fresh chives and served with baked potatoes.  It's a very well rounded and versatile sauce.

I love this recipe.  It is perfect for the small can of salmon.  I used crushed garlic bagel chips instead of the crackers for more flavor.  The dill dip is wonderful also.  I got 4 small patties with this recipe.  A perfect meal for two people along with cream potatoes and green peas.  Yum Yum....This is a keeper..

These salmon patties are so good. Especially with the Dill sauce that goes with them. I made them nice and brown and crunchy on the outside. Absolutely delicious!

While I appreciate that the author was looking for something healthier, the patties turned out very dry when I made the recipe twice, reducing the cooking time on the second attempt to see if I’d over cooked. Still dry. We liked the flavor but it needed more moisture. So I added what the author was trying to avoid and it turned out fantastic. I double the recipe for my family of 4 and doubled all the ingredients save the lemon juice. I added tarter sauce (1/2 cup mayo, 2 tsp relish, tsp mustard, tsp lemon juice) and they turned out fantastic. Moist and flavorful. This is a great recipe and appreciate the author for sharing it but my family needed some more fat in it and at least to us made it better.

I didn't measure carefully, and forgot the lemon juice. I also approximately doubled the recipe, so the salmon cakes lack some cohesion. However, they tasted rather wonderful, as did the dill sauce.

I used a different recipe for the salmon patties but wanted a sauce for them. This dill sauce made the recipe! YUMMY! It's a keeper! The only thing I changed is I added some lime juice (didn't have lemon) only because I thought it would be good. Don't judge the dill sauce on its own. You don't have the full effect of the yumminess until you eat it with the salmon patty!

Excellent, easy to make and easy to have all ingredients on hand.  I did not make the sauce because I had a very good herb dip on hand that was faster.

Added a little green pepper and a bit of the salmon juice just to be sure they weren’t dry.  They were delicious.

This was delicious!  I used frozen wild caught Salmon as that is all I had. I baked it with some lemon pepper seasoning then and assembled the patties. I make a mustard, dijon mustard ,honey sauce for sandwich spread and used that instead of the dijon mustard. I only had Panko bread crumbs so I used that. I added some parsley. Other than that I went with the recipe. Was not dry at all. I tasted the pattie without the Dill sauce and it was really good but with the Dill sauce it was delicious . I will most definitely make again.

Good way to use up canned salmon, which I am not really a fan of. I added some garlic powder and dill to the patties to increase the flavour.

I only made the sauce, and while it was tasty as is, I added some grated lemon peel to the sauce.  Lemon and dill are BFF! The lemon would make it 5 stars.

Really easy.  I was using a small can since there are two of us.  I thought one egg would make it too moist so  used mayonnaise instead of egg.  Added bread crumbs by feel until the patties would just hold together.   It was delicious.

Used 2 eggs and 1 cup crushed saltines to 4  5 oz cans of salmon. Added 1 diced smoked red pepper (from a jar), some ground white pepper and a couple of spoons of mayo (in addition to the onion, mustard and lemon juice). Brown them on both sides then put in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes to make sure they are cooked through. This made 10 patties.

I made these tonight because we forgot to take meat out of the freezer and had a can of salmon in the pantry. I omitted the mustard because we didn't have any, and added a little dill and parsley to them. They turned out great! Really tasty and the dill sauce is a perfect compliment. Will make again next time we forget to take meat out!

This was so tasty! I tripled the recipe so my husband and I could each have 2 patties and we have 2 left over. Our friend just returned from fishing in Alaska and brought us some fresh caught and packaged salmon so that definitely made it top notch. I did everything exactly as recipe is written except used slightly less breadcrumbs (I eyeballed it after 3/4 cup so probably ended up using a little over 1 cup) and I used half Greek yogurt half sour cream in the sauce since I rarely used sour cream (I would have used all Greek yogurt but ran out). The flavors were perfect and I'll def be making again! We paired it with some freshly picked sautéed squash (zucchini and patty pan) which complemented the patties PERFECTLY. thank you!!

If patties are dry try adding a little water to moisten.  Also I'd use 2T  olive oil. One not enough.  For dill sauce, I added a little fresh parsley from my garden and some chopped roasted red peppers from jar.  Adds color and flavor. Good on fresh salmon, baked potatoes or as a great veggies, cracker or bread dip.

In my version, instead of the diced onion, I used a packet of Lipton onion soup (and no other salt). A bit strong so would cut back to 1/2 packet if done again. But I used the sauce on a hamburger bun and it was fine (also had some ketchup on the side, though)… thanks, I just happened to have the sour cream and dill and some panko as well as regular bread crumbs!

Nothing really special.  I might try some different seasonings next  time.  I'll also lower the heat.

This is a fun way to get your fish. For my taste the patties were too big and the dill sauce a bit too "hot". Next time I'll make 3-4 patties and lessen the garlic powder. 

Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

Followed the recipe except for bread crumbs only 1/4 cup. They were wonderful - my husband said they were the best salmon patties I had ever made

A keeper recipe.  I followed both recipes to the letter, including the homemade bread crumbs.  I did triple the recipe due to the large can of salmon I had.  They came out very moist inside and fried up really crispy on the outside.  The sauce was really good too.  Served them with broccoli.  Very tasty and easy to make.  Thanks.

I made the salmon patties very similar (I had more salmon than 5 ounces). For patties I mixed 14.75 ounce can drained salmon (reserved juice in case the mixture was dry), 1 egg beaten, 1/2-3/4 cup finely chopped frozen onion/green/red pepper mix, 1/2 cup crushed chicken flavored stuffing mix, 1 Tbls dijon mustard, pinch of  paprika, 1 tsp lemon juice. For dip/sauce I mixed 3 Tbls sour cream 1 Tbls miracle whip 1 tsp lemon juice and the rest of the recipe as is. (I eyeball my measurements) My fiancé LOVED IT!

It was more about what I had on hand than a conscious decision to  change things but I added about 15 ounces of salmon and twice the other ingredients in my 'batch'. It was good; the patties were well integrated and moist/bound well; cooked quickly and browned easily ...

Excellent Dill Sauce. I didn't make the patties,  just used with grilled salmon that had salt & pepper.

I used Panko crumbs & mixed them with all the ingredients. Served with sour cream/ dill / garlic powder sauce. This will become one of our 'go to' recipes !!

I've made this twice now.  My wife said they're the first salmon patties that she's had where she didn't need ketchup.  I doubled this recipe.  I use GF breadcrumbs, a little olive oil in the mix, and a few dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  My kid is dairy-free, so I skipped the dill sauce.

This is my new favorite salmon patty recipe. I did use a 14 oz can instead of a 5 oz  one but I didn't change anything else and they turned out alright.  As for the dill dip, I added 1/2 tsp. horseradish and made it up early which gave it a nice, subtle kick.  Definitely going to make this again!
