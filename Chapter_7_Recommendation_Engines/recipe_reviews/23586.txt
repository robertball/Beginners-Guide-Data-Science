This is absolutely my FAVORITE mac & cheese recipe.  I've given it to countless friends & family members and all of them have fallen in love with it as well.  I did want to add that I put the egg in a measuring cup, beat it, and then added the milk to measure one cup because there was a lot of milk left in the bottom when I made it the first time.  I seemed a little soupy to me.  Now it's perfection every time.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Loved it! I must have tried a dozen mac and cheese recipes, but will make this from now on. I took the advice of others and added a teaspoon of garlic salt; also, I used 2 eggs because I like a firmer mac and cheese casserole.  I used a whole 8 oz. package of macaroni and it was perfect.  Maybe there was a typo error, and the writer meant to use 8 ounces of macaroni (1/2 of a 1 pound package.)

This was great!  Next time I will have to increase the macaroni if I use this much cheese.  Also,  I mixed the eggs and milk together before pouring it over the macaroni.

Something about this recipe isn't right ... I baked for about 22 minutes and it was extremely runny.  I don't think an entire cup of milk is needed; Next time I'd use only 1/4 to 1/2 a cup if any at all.

My family loved this recipe! I baked it for 20 minutes, then stirred it up, added a little more cheese to the top, and baked it for about 5 more minutes. Next time I will combine the milk and egg as suggested.

I really like this one! So did my husband. Better than from a box and SO easy. Followed recipe and I followed the advice of others and added a little garlic salt to the top (about a tsp). Also put a beaten egg into the 1 cup measuring cup and added milk to fill that ~ wasn't too soupy. Excellent! Wouldn't change a thing. **Update: I've made this like 20 times now for parties/get togethers. It is a hit! Everyone loves it. Goes well with just about anything, but especially cookouts.

Wow! If you are looking for a scrumptious mac and cheese, this is the one!  It is a great baked dish, not too mushy like some of the others.  I added about 2 spoonfuls of Italian bread crumbs on the top about the last 10 minutes, and that added a great punch to it.

This was very very easy and quick to make. Out of the five people at the dinner only one did not care for it. I thought it was good but not "the best" ever! Will be making this again. Maybe with a different combination of cheeses.

FABULOUS!!  I fixed this for Thanksgiving yesterday.  It was the perfect baked yet creamy sensation to suit all of my 50+ family members crowded around our table.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in 9 x 13 stoneware dish.  It was perfect!  Several of our family members dubbed me the family maraconi maker from here on. Thanks Susan G.!!

This is delicious and not difficult at all. Two issues are the portion size. There is no way this recipe could feed 9 people as a main course. I doubled it and had maybe seven servings. The second issue is with the egg. Even though I mixed the egg with the milk, there were still blobs of cooked egg on top of the finished dish. I think next time I will try mixing the egg and milk into the macaroni before layering it with the cheeses. Thanks for the good recipe!

I served this tonight for me and my two roommates and we thought it was very good! Not too creamy, the cheese tasted amazing and not runny at all. Our only complaint was that for some reason, it came out not very hot. I did it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, but it came out only lukewarm, so that was a bit of a disappointment.

I love this recipe.  Very good.  I really use whatever cheeses I have on hand for this recipe.  I always use evaporated milk instead of half and half that is indicated in the recipe. Just because that is what I have in my pantry.  Family really likes this macaroni recipe.  I have made it several times now.  Thanks!!

I really enjoyed the different cheeses in here, and the fact none of that awful "processed cheese food" was needed. I do think, however, that there is a bit too much cheese, and thus a little too much grease. I think next time I make this, I'll use a full box of macaroni, add about the same amount of cheese (maybe a few fingerfulls more), and then use about 1  and a half cups of milk and an egg (and of course a larger pan!) Thanks for sharing!

My husband made this and forgot the egg and milk and it was still great!  He also put some salsa on top and that really gave it a kick.  For those who think it is bland, maybe using sharp cheddar would give a better flavor.

This has to be some of the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had.  That said, there were a few issues with the recipe.  I don't think the issue was the amount of milk.  I think it was the amount of macaroni.  I used a full 8 oz box, which should be closer to what you would need for the 9 servings the recipe states it makes.  I also used fat free half and half simply because it was in my fridge and I needed to get rid of it.  When the casserole came out of the oven it was a still runny, but withing 10 minutes of sitting it was a perfect consestency.  I also added a little garlic powder and paprika for flavor and color.

I have used this recipe several times and it is one of my favorites on this website.  It is super easy and makes very cheesy, delicious mac & cheese.  I used the suggestion of other reviewers and mixed the milk and egg before adding it on top of the mac & cheese.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I got this exact recipe from Pattie LaBelle's cookbook. However, to make it taste creamy & be truly great do the following. Reduce the eggs to one or completely omit. (I omit)  Increase the half and half to 2 cups. Increase the butter by 2 tsp. Greatly increase the salt & pepper: 1.5tsp for the salt & .75 to 1 tsp for the pepper (depending on taste). Reduce cooking time to 5 - 10 minutes. Broil for 1 minute to get the cheese on top to brown. I know that is a lot of modifications but it's worth it.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not enjoy the results at all.  I guess I am used to a creamy macaroni and cheese.  This was very rich because of all the cheeses, but the sauce was weird.  I will definitely go back to making a roux from now on.

This was my first homemade mac and cheese and it was soooo good. All I had on hand were cheddar and mozzeralla, and I added fresh cracked pepper to each layer.  This was the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Thank you for the new recipe.

This macaroni recipe was okay. I thought it was all right, the husband didn't care for it at all. I reduced the amount of milk and increased the amount of macaroni. It was also very bland.

My whole family loved this. I made this recipe with a whole box (16 oz) of cork screw pasta and it was a rousing success!

This is a great recipe.  Easy to make and remember (always key ... can't alwaysw get to all recipes for a forgotten recipe).

I followed the suggestion of others and used a combined 1 cup of egg and milk.  Also, I only had mixed shredded cheese, mozzarella and kraft cheese on hand so I used that.  It came wonderfully cheesy.  Will definitely make again.

I've never been big on baked macaroni and cheese, but this one is very simple to make.  It's a little bland for me, but my family loves it.  I've made is several times and will make it again. Maybe next time add a little more salt and pepper and maybe some garlic.

I made this for this recipe for my husband and myself.  As lovers of macaroni and cheese I have to say this recipe is great. It's super easy and comes out tasting great and cheesy. I actually substitutes the provolone cheese for American and it came out even better.

This was divine! It was loved by all. I doubled the recipe, used carnation evaporated milk instead of regular milk and mixed the egg and milk together. Made it last week for a dinner dish, making it again tonight to take to a potluck bible study. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out tasting strange. There was far too much cheese in it for us. The egg on top also made it taste strange. This would be a good recipe if the amount of cheese was reduced by half.

This is the easiest and best macaroni and cheese dish I have ever baked.  I also used less milk as did another reviewer using 1 egg, beating it and then addig mlk to the egg mixture to equal 1 cup.  I have given this to many of my friends who also raved about it.

This was fantastic. i decided to go with pepper jack instead of provolone and it was a hit. the pepper jack gave it a little bit more flavor. also, i LOVE how easily it came out of the dish. makes life SO much easier.

My family loved this recipe! I made it for a family get-together, and Thanksgiving, and everybody REALLY liked this recipe. The thing that I changed was, instead of provolone cheese, I used Swiss cheese, but only because I couldn't find it. I also noticed a considerable difference in pan size. For Thanksgiving, I doubled the recipe, and it was a little dry, but when I used the smaller pan, it all blended together, and turned out really well. Nonetheless, my entire family really enjoyed this recipe, and ask me to make it whenever possible!

This is a good Mac N Cheese Recipe.  I have tried to find several recipes and this one was a hit.  However, I made a few changes.  I doubled the recipe (I used the whole box of elbow macaroni - i think whomever posted this recipe meant to use 8 oz of a 1 lb box of elbow macaroni).  I used the suggestion of beating the egg(s) and putting it in the measuring cup and then added the milk.  Also, after it cooked for 17 minutes, I stirred the entire dish to mix the cheeses, added a little garic salt, and a few plain bread crumbs (making sure to mix it well).  I added another cup of cheddar cheese on the top and cooked for another 5 minutes.  It was very cheesey!  Wasn't bad but the recipe needs some tweaking.  If you plan to double it...make sure you add just a bit of additional cheese to each layer, and use 2 eggs and more milk.  Overall, the kids loved it as part of their Thanksgiving meal.  Would make it again.

I love this recipe. I used it for my son's birthday party and it was very easy to prepare and serve. I also increased the amount of pasta and combined the egg and milk. I also used a blended pizza cheese mix in place of the provolone cheese to help add a saltier taste to the dish. Would recommend to anyone who loves mac and cheese but hates to make it homemade!

This macaroni and cheese was average. I took the previous advice about decreasing the amount of milk in the recipe, so it ended up baking perfectly. I thought it could have used more seasoning, but it was fairly good.

I found this recipe to be a miracle!  It's easy to make and tastes great. I added a layer of Parmesan on top About 5 minutes before pulling it out of the oven.  This worked well and the kids loved it!

The taste of this recipe is good.  But I agree something isn't quite right with the recipe.  I followed other reviewers advice and added the whole box of macaroni.  But I didn't change anything else.  Yes it was very cheesy however the macaroni was almost crunchy.  I will try this again and maybe make it the way it is originally written.

I personally like a cripsy cheese action with my mac and cheese so I added some butter pats to the bottom of dish before adding cheeses.  It was a hit.  Others liked it that way too.  Who would of known.

YUM YUM! I used the cheeses suggested in the recipe, but added garlic salt to the milk mixture. I also used a different noodle (curly q's) since the store was out of maccaroni (go figure). It was wonderful!

This recipe was ok.  I used a convection oven and still found that it neede to cook longer.  Maybe a total of 35-40 minutes.  I added bread crumbs to the top for some crunch.  Next time I make it I will also add just a little flour with the milk.  It was a little runny for me.  Flavor was real good though.

WE LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  i added some sauteed onions (that i was already making for the cajun meatloaf - which is a great paring for this recipe!).  i thought it needed to be cooked a little longer then 20 min and i mixed the milk and egg before pouring in.

My family did not like this recipe.  There was a lot of milk left at the bottom of the pan.  The flavor just wasn't very good.  It seemed like it was missing something.  I will not make this again.  The cheese was too expensive and my family thought the Kraft boxed macaroni tasted better.

This recipe was a hit!  I made it for a banquet and it disappeared in seconds.  My family loved it so much they've had me make it several more times.  It can't get any easier to make, but it's so delicious!  I've tried it with different kinds of cheeses to add variety (white cheddar, mild cheddar, Mexican blend) and it always tastes great.

i used 9x13 stoneware. i used two eggs and substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk. I combined the eggs and 1/2 and 1/2, whisked them together, and then poured the mixture over the macaroni. i make this all the time.  i have played around with the cheeses and have found that I prefer to use more sharp white cheddar but that goes according to your own taste. I have also experimented with various crusts. The easiest is to combine panko crumbs, bread crumbs, and some parmesan cheese and just sprinkle it across the top of the casserole. No muss, no fuss!! lol Enjoy!!!

So quick, easy and tasty!  I didn't have provolone but worked well with the other 3 cheeses.  Will definitely make again.  I used the suggestion to add egg to 1 cup measure then added Skim Plus fat free half and half, then paired this dish with a sauteed kale side dish.

I was super excited to make this, but my expectations fell way short.  The cheese to noodle ratio was a little high on the cheese side for me.  Also, after cooking the alloted time, it was a soupy stringy mess.  I think the recipe might be better if I used less cheese and less milk.

I followed the directions for this exactly, except I added hot dogs. I baked it for 25 minutes, and the cheese was bubbly and browning, but when I had let it cool for 10 minutes and went to serve, it was still VERY milky. I had to bake it for almost another 45 minutes until it was not liquid. I don't think it would have had much flavor without the hot dogs. If I make it again, I will bake it for much longer than 25 minutes. (directions said only 20 was needed)

This was my first attempt at making Home Made Mac and cheese, and I only gave it 2 stars because my two year old liked it. I guess it wasn't the kind of Mac and Cheese I was looking for. It was not creamy, it was a little on the dry side and super cheesy. My Husband told me not to make it again. I felt sick to my stomach after I ate it. Perhaps I did something wrong? I will definatly keep looking for a different recipe.

I followed the suggestions as well (added 1 teaspoon garlic powder to the milk, used two eggs...) I also added some chopped scallions to the cheese.  My family devoured this!  Very easy and delicious.

Loved it!! It was awesome and quick.  I just made this mac and cheese for my family for tomorrow! One suggestion, use more egg, it helps to bond the cheese together and also use butter to break up the macaroni when you are straining it.

Not bad, just not very good.  Had no real flavor to it.  I added ham and that helped a bit. Do not let the noodles cool before making this dish or it will not be warm enough in 20 minutes

Excellent! As for the milk left over in the pan, if you just let it sit for a couple of minutes, I found the milk will thicken and disappear.  It does taste better with salt and pepper added. All together GREAT recipe!

I read as many reviews as possible and took others advice. I used a cup of half and half with the egg mixed in. Once the macaroni was finished, I poured that into a large bowl and mixed in the half and half and egg mixture to that. Then proceeded with the layering. I used Gruyere cheese instead of provolone and it was fantastic! I used only half a cup a mozzarella so it wouldn't be too stringy. I used the whole 8 oz box of pasta, added a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a touch of paprika all mixed with the pasta before layering in the dish. I didn't use measurements on the spices, just a little as needed. Also used a little Parmesan and bread crumbs on top, about 5 minutes before the cooking process ended. My issue was it drying out, I added a little more half and half during the cooking process and after it finished. This helped keep it very creamy. Very simple recipe, quick and easy and everyone loved it!

Yay, I have finally found a mac and cheese recipe my whole family likes!  Like other reviewers, I added the milk to the egg and also used a whole box of macaroni.  Instead of provolone I added more cheddar and mozzarella, and Colby jack cheeses.  The next time I make it, I will add the milk separately from the eggs due to the extra macaroni.  Great recipe!

after reading other reviews, I beat the egg and then added milk to get to one cup. otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. I wasn't that impressed, and my husband thought we have had better. It might have been the cheeses - they kinda just blended together and didn't have any strong flavors. plus, this is a chunky macaroni and cheese; we prefer a creamy version. wouldn't make again.

This was so easy! I didn't have the specific cheeses listed on hand, so I used sharp cheddar, feta, Amish butter cheese & Amish garlic & herb cheese. I also took another poster's suggestion and mixed the egg & milk together before pouring it on whole wheat macaroni. It was very good, and none of that fussing to make a cheese sauce, which I never seem to be able to do properly. Definitely worth a try!

I mixed the egg and milk as others have suggested. Was good, but very cheesy and heavy. Would probably be better as a side dish.

Fabulous recipe!  Rarely do I comment on recipes but this one is my 'go to' for mac & cheese.  Be sure to stir the contents well when it comes out of the oven!  Have tried it with 1/2 t. of garlic salt mixed with milk mix as well as without garlic salt & both are great.  It's a matter of preference.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I took it to a family party and everyone ate it all. My 1 year old even ate it and he is picky. I think I'll double it next time so there will be left overs. Thanks.

This was fantastic!  As suggested by others I combined the egg and milk together to measure 1 Cup.  I also put a layer of Italian-Seasoned Bread Crumbs over the top for added flavor and texture.  I used 8oz of macaroni (half a 1 pound box).  Aside from the mozzarella I shredded all the cheeses myself.

This was my first try at making homemade Mac-N-Cheese & I was not impressed. It turned out bland & a bit dry.  I mixed all the cheeses together & added an extra egg, but that should not make much of a difference in the taste.  It definately needs some added spice.  I doubt I will be making this again.

I liked the option of switching out cheeses, easy to make. It is much better to serve the day-of: we tried to make it ahead of time and it really loses it's flavor.

This was pretty good.  I would give it a 3 star, but my husband who "doesn't usually like this kind of thing" thought it was "actually pretty good".  I used a little more pasta and mozz. cheese instead of the colby-montery-jack.  I also threw some onion powder in the milk-egg mix before I poured it on. The different cheeses gave it a pretty good flavor.  However, I will probably mix them all together next time and mix part way through cooking to spread the stronger flavors throughout.

This is probably a 4 and 1/2 star recipe.  Did not have the colby/jack cheese, so just saved a little of the others for the last layer.  Used about 6 oz of rigatoni pasta.  This is not a creamy dish, but very cheesy.  Also used a blend of cheddar & american cheese.  Also used 1 beaten egg in a measuring cup with milk added to make 1 cup.

Yum! This was sooo good! Only thing I did was add some garlic salt to the beaten egg, which I mixed with the milk and poured over the top. Definitely a make-again recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe, and very easy to put together. Instead of buying four different cheeses, I used Kraft Classic Melts which is a combination of four cheeses in one package. I used three cups instead of four, with 8 oz of macaroni and that was fine. My husband really liked it.

One son gave the recipe a four, but the rest of us gave it a three.  Though we ate it right out of the oven, it tasted kind of like how you would expect mac and cheese to taste if you had let it sit and get cold for about thirty minutes.  I don't know...I'm not sure if I'll make again.  Thanks anyway!  It was fun making mac and cheese from scratch.

This was great!  My husband and I made it after work and then finished it off the next day at lunch.  We added a fifth cheese--a smoked variety that gave it an extra kick.  Thanks!

I have been looking for a mac & cheese recipe that my husband would like and let me tell you I don't think it can get any better than this.
