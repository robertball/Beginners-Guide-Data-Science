Make sure to use extra-virgin olive oil, and add some chopped garlic and fresh grated parmesean for added flavor. Delicious!

This dish is in serious need of seasoning, (salt, pepper, garlic, parmesan cheese, lemon zest).  Some fresh herbs might be nice too.  Otherwise it is great hot or cold.

Not enough "kick" for our taste.  I added a small onion and a wee bit of instant boullion. I'm comparing it to one that had tarragon in it...which was an interesting ingredient.

Good and very healthy. I made it with whole wheat penne.  This is basically a chicken piccata. I'd suggest the following:  Cut the chicken into slices rather than cubes to make them bite-size.  Or use chicken tenderloins.  Dredge the chicken pieces lightly in flour before browning, which will help them brown and be a little crispy.  More capers  More lemon juice  Add salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. (yes, that's a given, but some people may need the reminder).  I might add a little white wine to the chicken in the last few minutes of sauteeing.  I wouldn't use extra virgin olive oil, which doesn't hold up well to sauteeing.  Much as I love olive oil and garlic, I wouldn't add it here.

I also added onion and a couple of cloves of garlic.  I have made it twice now.  Very delicious, but I think next time I make it i will also add some lemon zest.

First time I have ever really wanted to review a recipe!! I usually add my own twist to recipes, but I didn't really need to with this one!! I added roasted red peppers for color and it turned out delicious. Great recipe!

Really needs "more"... used 1.5 lbs chicken, seasoned with montreal chicken seasoning, and cooked it in the oil with zest and juice of one lemon. Added onion and garlic with the veggies, as well as 8 ounces fresh mushrooms and one yellow bell pepper. Instead of water I used broth. I used a pound of orzo instead of penne, mixed it all together, tasted it, found it still too bland. I added fresh ground pepper and garlic salt which helped immensely. The three stars I gave were for the original recipe. Terribly bland without my additions, but with them, it's 4 stars. Healthy, too.

Very fresh and flavorful. I didn't have broccoli so I added extra asparagus. I also added some chicken bouillon powder and garlic.

I increased the lemon juice by about a tbsp.  Also through in a few dashes of white wine while cooking and reduced liquid.  I substituted snow peas for the asparagus.  Used fresh mushrooms as I would never used canned.  Also left out the water

I really liked this. I made a few additions. I added onions. I buttered and tossed the noodles before adding everything else. Just gave it a little extra flavor. I added parmesan too. My husband really enjoyed it. It's a nice fresh pasta, not too heavy. Perfect for a hot summer day.

Only added a bit of Parmesan. Tried this while house sitting and it is definately my new fav, can't wait to get home & try it on the hubby & kids! They are going to love it. Only thing it needed was a nice piece of garlic bread and more wine!

I used chicken broth instead of water, subbed broccoli for the asparagus, added garlic, onion, and carrots, left out the capers, and added salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and parmesan cheese.

This dish turned out really well. I used zucchini instead of the mushroom/capers and lots of lemon juice. Very good!

I didn't realize broccoli and asparagus could cook the same time - thought the asparagus would be overlooked. I cut the capers and mushrooms and added garlic, caramelized onions, leftover ham and a little parm and mozzarella, and it had lots of flavor

Tasty recipe, but where is the sauce? I served this separate from the pasta, and made a seperate sauce to go with the penne. This is a great yummy recipe when you add a little garlic powder and herbs. thank you!

The end product was OK when it was fresh, but a day in the fridge definitely dried everything out.  I needed to add some more olive oil.  I would have added parm cheese if I had any on hand.  It was a very light lemony type of flavor.  Wasn't really anything that I would crave again, but I wouldn't not eat it again if someone made it.  It was good...just not remarkable.

My boyfriend really liked this dish because it felt much more healthy than the usual alfredo pastas we have. I took another reviewer's advice and coated the chicken with flour first, then browned it in corn oil which gave it a nice golden brown crisp. I added red bell peppers to the vegetable mix to give it some color. I also added some lemon pepper and garlic to the vegetables. I liked the way the chicken and veggies tasted but I was not used to eating the noodles completely bland, so I ended up adding olive oil and parmesan to the noodles.
