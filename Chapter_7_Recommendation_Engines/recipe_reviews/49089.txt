I think the chocolate is gilding the lily.  Consider using port in place of the champagne, and leave out the orange, use brandy in the whipped cream.

So easy, yet so elegant. My family loved these and they make a great presentation. I will be serving these at some up-coming ladies luncheons. Thanks Christina.

Very yummy and easy. I followed the suggestion of another user and added add the grand manier to the chocolate. But don't! Otherwise the chocolate will freeze up and get chunky. I had to throw it away. Instead, drizzle it over the final dessert. Also, i used wine instead of champagne.

I made these when my parents came to dinner and my dad said they were the best pears he ever had! I added a little splash of grand marnier to the chocolate and it was fantastic.

We loved this recipe. I used chocolate carbernet sauce instead of chocolate chips. Very nice dish!

When I tasted the cooking liquid it was so good, I decided to reduce it a bit and pour in on the pears.

I didn't have chips, so I just chopped up  some 70% chocolate to sprinkle on over the pears in the sauce.

I only used the champagne, cinnamon stick, and a cup or so of diet cran-grape juice. Really good!

I did not care for this recipe at all.  It was an absolute waste.  Not only was the timing off - I quarted and cored the pears and they still were not done in the alloted time - but it was way too perfumey and had an artificial taste to them.  I'd rather sip a mimosa with dinner and have pears poached in a simple syrup instead.

These are delicous. Every time I serve them I get compliments. I omitted the chocolate and just used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I served them on mascarpone cheese, drizzled them with the sauce and topped with chopped walnuts. The mascarpone balances the sweetness really well.

Yum! I improvised - used cooler instead of champagne, peach nectar instead of orange juice, and omitted the chocolate, and it was still fantastic!

make sure to use canned pears, if not, they might stay to firm.

Soooooo easy, so delicious!! Instead of the chocolate, I opted for a mixed berry compote of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, all served over vanilla bean ice cream. It was the perfect dessert!! Thanks!!

Super simple to make and most beautiful dessert to serve. I used wine instead of champagne.  Very tasty to the palate:)
