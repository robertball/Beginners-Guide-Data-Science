We used frozen beans and fresh potatoes.  We only used one can of soup and whatever cheese we had in the refridgerator.  It was very good and simple.

Instead of baking, I put the ingredients in a crockpot on high temp. and it went over well at a family reunion resulting in requests for the recipe.

For such simple ingredients, really, really good. Only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp each of onion and garlic powder. Took to a Church potluck, was devoured!

I following another reviewers advice and added chopped ham to the dish- also added onion and garlic (staples in my cooking) and I ended up with a dish that could be featured in the kid-friendly recipes section! Used fresh beans and potato. The cooking time was almost doubled with my changes-just kept an eye until it bubbled. Thanks for sharing!

I'm sorry but I can only give it four stars. It's just that it would really have to be spectacular for it to recieve five. :)

It was delicious, but I think next time I will possibly use freshly boiled potatoes. I don't like the flavor the canned potatoes had.

I changed this recipe so much that I considered not reviewing it, but it was really good and I want to remember what I did so I can do it again.  I used the crockpot, 2 hrs on high and then few hours on low until we were ready for dinner.  I used 3 or 4 red potatoes, scalloped; around 1/2 to 3/4 lb fresh green beans, sliced in half; around 2 cups of chopped cooked ham (the leftovers of the non-sliced part of a spiral cut ham), a medium sweet onion, chopped; some garlic, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, salt & pepper, and maybe 6 oz of shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend cheese.  Mixed it all up in the crock.  Could probably start it in the morning and let it cook all day on low.  I put a little shredded cheese on top of it before serving, both my husband and I loved it.

Thanks for the inspiration! Since I didn't have all the ingredients, I substituted a homemade white sauce (milk, flour and butter) for the cream soup.  I used fresh potatoes, boiling them until almost done, then layering with the green beans and cheese in a 9x13"pan.  Everyone loved it, from my 17 year old to my 16 month old!  Thanks!

I used fresh green beans, Yukon potatoes and whatever cheese I had in the frig. I also used a can of mushroom soup. I decided to try added turkey sausage (sliced and browned first) and added some seasonings as others recommended. (pepper, onion and garlic) I put this in the crockpot to see how it would turn out. Ends up, I had to leave it on high for 4 hours till it was done! (I didn't realize I would have to cook it that long but I guess it was because I used fresh ingredients) But after waiting that long it was tasty. Perfect meal for the cool weather!

I altered the recipe a bit - added chunks of chicken, fresh green beans and used fresh chunked potatoes. It needed to cook about an hour with the fresh potatoes. My hubby loved it and I did too.

This is a great recipe foundation... just in need of a little tweeking. I took advice from a few other reviewers. I used fresh green beans sauted in a small amount of olive oil using salt, pepper & nutmeg. The nutmeg accented the flavor of the ham, which i added. I used fresh potatoes just steamed for a few minutes before hand. Also a half of a sweet onion. I used cream of mushroom soup and a bit less cheese. This was awesome, and wonderful for a chilly night.

Super easy to throw together which is perfect when making big holiday meals. I season it a bit w/ Salt & Pepper. A little Garlic salt. I use 2 cans of soup and a colby jack or cheddar mix. 2 years running from this recipe. Turkey Day & Christmas and a couple here & there's. Also sprinkle a little french fried onions on top for some crunchieness. A hit here!

I used 3 cans of green beans and 2 cans of potatoes, low sodium cream of chicken and about 1 1/2 c of cheese.  I would suggest you season to your liking or it will turn out a little bland.  I added onion and garlic powder and pepper.  I cooked this for about 1 hour because it didn't look done after 30 mins.  Turned out pretty good and I will make this again.  My 15 month old really liked it.  May try fresh green beans and potatoes next time.

Great base recipe.  I had to adjust the quantities based on what was in my cupboard, which meant using only one can of green beans, but I also added cubed ham (as another reviewer suggested) and it turned out to be pretty terrific.  Adding the ham made it today's perfect rainy day meal.

This reminds me of some of the frozen veggie in cheese sauce mixtures that can be purchased in the frozen section of the grocery store.  It was pretty good, but I doubt I would serve it to guests.  It's easy to make in a pinch.

I took this to a family dinner and most everyone liked it, but I think next time I will cut back a little on the cheese.  One pound shredded made this kind of soupy.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

I was actually really disappointed with this. I feel bad saying it because there are so many good reviews but maybe it's because I followed the recipe exactly.. First off, 1lb is WAY too much cheese. Also I think it would be better with fresh potatoes cut up on your own because the diced ones just tasted like the canned grean beans to me. Also I think it would be a lot better if you but croutons or something crunchy of the top for more texture.

This is an awesome dish. I didn't use canned potatoes- I used simply potato diced with onion. I added some salt pepper and garlic powder. You can add all sorts of stuff to this and it's awesome reheated the next day- preferably fried! Yum! Thanks for sharing- this will become a staple.

This is a great recipe. Very simple and leaves plenty of room to change it up with whatever else you want to add it. It's great every time. The only way I can get my picky eaters to eat green beans. Thanks for this one!

This recipe was ok.  I used fresh potatoes and beans, which were good.  I wouldn't use cream of celery again (I needed a veg. option), and I might even use 1/2 can.

This is one of the easiest and yummiest dishes ever! We usually add one diced onion and I prefer to substitute cream of onion soup if you can find it but other than that I think it is a great quick dinner. I usually sprinkle some corn flakes on top and add diced ham if we have it in the house and make it a complete meal. I've served it time and again and I've always gotten raves!

Blah, it had no flavor, no anything for that matter. No one would touch it and it went out in the garbage, I even tried everyone suggestions to spice it up a bit, but still nothing. I am a fan of green beans so that is why I tried it, but I will stick to the original green bean casserole, because that is the best.

Good and simple.  I used fresh potatoes.  It turned out a little runny, so I could have used more potatoes.  It is definately something you can just throw together.  My picky 2 year old even liked it!

It really did taste excellent, but it was too greasy and upset my stomach afterwards. I think next time I'll try half the cheese.

This sat in my recipe box for a month before I finally got around to making it...I wish I had made it sooner!!  YUM!  My whole family including my picky toddler loved it.  I made a few changes...used frozen potatoes so it needed to be cooked a bit longer (1 hour).  I also saved some of the cheese and sprinkled  it on top at the end of cooking time.  I think next time I will probably use some garlic and onion.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I'm giving it a 5 star, because if I had the right ingredients: it would've came out awesome. But like they say, "When life gives you lemons, you make pie". lol.
I made it for 2
1 I had no can potatoes. Diced 3 small russets, Microwave cooked for 5 min on high added to the bowl
2. 1 can drained green beans
3. I had no  cream of mushrooms. Made a substitute found on web. Only needed half a can, so I half the recipe
 * 1 blespoons butter.
    4 oz sliced mushrooms.
    1 cup milk.
    2 ounces (1/4 cup) light cream. 
      cheese. I only 
      had chive and onion  cream cheese
My Husband said to keep this on the list to remake. I will be making it again using the same ingredients.

Had to make changes based on what was in my pantry and needed using.  I can tell from the as-is recipe hubby would like it but would prefer it spicier.  Needed to use some fresh potatoes so I diced and boiled them to equal the canned, had to use a mixture of Cheddar and Monterey cheese since I didn't have any Colby.  Also added a sprinkling of diced dehydrated onions, garlic powder and jalapeno powder.   Also need to use up some Italian bread crumbs so I added a topping of that.  And since it is just us two I basically halved all the amounts except the soup.  Oh, I also added some leftover turkey from Christmas to make it a main dish.  Very good!

Way bland. I will stick with my cream of mushroom, garlic, and salt at minimum. Longer cook time, but will microwave my additions in.

I had to adapt the recipe because I didn't have the chicken soup. I came up with a sauce with a similar taste, it tasted amazing! My husband and I loved it, so I will definitely make this again. I made it for 2 people, but we had enough for 3, so that will make a good lunch today.
I used 1 pound of fresh beans and 4 medium sized potatoes (diced), and precooked them so that the time in the oven would be shorter.
For the sauce I used 250ml of milk and some 50 ml of heavy cream, I heated that and added a chicken bouillion cube. Then I added a tablespoon of all purpose flour, to thicken the sauce. I seasoned it with garlic powder and parsley, and added a finely chopped onion, plus some lemon juice. I had it simmer for around 10 minutes, and then added some cheese (maybe 50-75 grams) to the sauce. After that was melted the sauce was a little thick so I added some hot water and poured the creamy cheese sauce over the (precooked for 10-15 minutes and hot) beans and potatoes. I stirred well to make sure all potatoes and green beans were covered with the sauce. It only needed 20 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees (200 Celcius)

Made this for dinner tonight - used fresh green beans and fresh potatoes, sliced  thin.  Also added fresh mushrooms and onion, which I sauteed in a little butter before adding to the potatoes.  I used cream of mushroom soup, some garlic powder, milk, and sour cream mixed together with half of the cheese called for - sprinkled a little cheese on top and baked covered at 375 for an hour.  Came out great.

Love this recipe. Made a few changes. Substituted cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom soup. Added one crushed garlic clove and hefty dash of Herbes De Provence spice in addition of 1/2 cup of  cream. With salt and pepper, this is definitely a family keeper.

I made this the other day and it was actually a descent side dish. I made it a little healthier though. I used low-sodium green beans and peeled, diced, and boiled 3 russet potatoes instead of using 2 cans of diced potatoes. I also only did 4oz or 1/2 of an 8oz bag of a cheddar blend mix instead of a full pound of cheese. It was plenty. The recipe was quick and easy. ty

Very easy and well-received.  Not the best casserole I've ever made, but my husband likes his food "plain", so he loved this.  I added lots of paprika and used maybe half the cheese.

Made this for dinner tonight, a side with roasted chicken. Only I used one can green beans and three cans of potatoes...used velvetta as I didn't have any colby. Very good! All ingredients were in my house, perfect because we are having a blizzard right now in Iowa! Thanks for the great recipe :)

I used fresh green beans and potatoes for this in place of the canned, boiling them beforehand. This wasn't bad, but it was rather bland. Wish I had added something more to it. It seemed like too many calories for something that was so-so in flavor, though perhaps I'm just not a vegetable casserole kind of gal. It all did end up getting eaten however, with no complaints, but no rave reviews either.

The husband loved it, so did I...and our kid ate it because we made him. I only used half of the cheese because it's all I had, but now I can't imagine having used a whole pound. It's super greasy, but delicious. For the heck of it, I added a little extra cheese on top with some crumbled crispy bacon. I'm sure the leftovers won't last long. I might even put bread crumbs on top next time like another user had done.

This is the perfect potato casserole! My family and I loved it ! The only change we made was that we used fresh potatoes instead of canned potatos. We will definatly use this recipe again Thank you!

We used fresh beans and potatoes.  It wasn't that great.  Too much cheese (and we're from Wisconsin!) and the soup was pretty runny.  It was bland.  Maybe with some adjustments it would be better.

Won't be making this again.  Used fresh instead of canned potatoes but I think this recipe has way too much cheese.  No one would eat it.

Hmmm - I really wasn't as in love with this as most other people!  We liked it, but it was nothing amazing.  I used fresh green beans and potatoes, so I boiled them for about 10 minutes before putting them in the oven.  I used a 1lb of beans and 2 potatoes.  Then I baked it for 15 more minutes.  A whole pound of cheese is 4 cups, which is really a ton!  I used what I had left, which was about 1 1/2 cups.  It could have used another 1/2 cup but I can't imagine 4 entire cups on here!  I do think I'll make this again, trying it with more cheese and canned beans.  Maybe it makes a difference!

This was an instant hit with my family, from kids to grandparents!  Try adding a can of diced green chiles to jazz it up just a bit, and use Healthy Request soup to make it a little healthier.  I was leery about using canned diced potatoes but they turned out great.

I gave it a 4 because I had to modify it & it turned out great with the changes. I used fresh potatoes, that first I boiled till half done. I a 1/2 lb of 2% cheddar, the Healthy Request Crm of Chix soup and added salt, pepper, garlic & some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. the way the recipe is written, looks very bland, very heavy, very cheesy (thus greasy)....seemed like no flavors would come through with all the heaviness!

Wonderful side dish! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was especially a hit with the kids. Nothing was left in the dish before the night was over.

My fiance really liked this recipe. We are vegetarians so I substituted with cream of mushroom soup. The first time I made it I only used half the cheese and that was great.  The second time I used the full amount, but I thought it turned out too cheesy.  Next time I'll stick with 1/2 pound of colby.  Other than that it makes a great alternative to the usual green bean casserole for Thanksgiving.

Extremely disappointing. I had to double my cooking time to get my fresh pototoes the consistency I wanted. The cream of chicken was very overpowering and it was way too cheesy/greasy. I prefer lighter casseroles and this one definitely sits heavy. I will not make this again. I gave it two stars instead of one because my boyfriend thought it edible (where as I did not).

I made this for Christmas, and everyone enjoyed it. I used fresh potatoes, though. I would recommend adding some onion and garlic.

Made this for our family Christmas as a change from the regular Green Bean Casserole.  It got great reviews.  Very easy to make.

I made this recipe exactly as given, and it was deicious.  It was so simple, and would be easy to tweak based on your own taste or availability of ingredients.  Next time I'll add black pepper, and either cut back on the cheese a bit or add some ham as other reviewers mentioned.
