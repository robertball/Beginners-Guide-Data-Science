Made as written except that I found 8 oz. of mushrooms to be plenty. Double that amount as directed would have just been too many. I am not a big chickpea fan but I really enjoyed this and it is one I will most definitely make again!

I did this last night for dinner.  It was easy to make; however, it was just ok.  I probably will not make again.
