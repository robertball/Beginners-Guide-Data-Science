I have been searching for a sweet potato souffle that includes pineapple (my Moma used to make it this way) and finally found this one.  It was spectacular.  The pineapple makes it a memorable dish!

Well, I made this as my "new" dish for thanksgiving this year, and while I enjoyed the flavor of the dish, the texture wasn't what I was expecting.  I whipped the potato mixture for 11 minutes and it never became "fluffy".  I used canned yams, which is supposed to be an acceptable substitution, but it wasn't.  It was basically a puree.  Because this wasn't fluffy, and it had the eggs in it, the texture a bit gross.  I really enjoyed the pineapple topping, but I would reduce the sugar by a third next time.  I think I will try this one more time with fresh sweet potatoes and see if the texture is better, if not, I will just make my praline yams and top with the reduced sugar pineapple mixture.  Thanks for sharing.

We eat baked  sweet potatoes (yams) year round at our house.  How can anything so good for you taste so good!  I baked this recipe tonight and wasn't disappointed!  This was a 'delish dish' souffle . . . high fives cinnalady!  My personal preference was  butter instead of margarine - everything else was perfect.  The pineapple topping was really good!  Note:   I believe there is a typo under Directions #2:  It reads "3 eggs" for the souffle; I believe it should read 2 eggs as the Ingredients call for plus  the 1 egg to mix with the pineapple topping.  Is this correct cinnalady?

I've made this 4 or 5 times now, and keep coming back again and again!  I agree with other reviewers that it's very sweet (Think Dessert!), but it's so tasty! I use the 3 eggs that it calls for in the directions, +1 more for the topping (4 eggs total).  It's baked up nice and fluffy for me every time.  As with any baking, make sure your eggs are at room temp when you whip them in so they incorporate well.  I would recommend that you allow yourself time to let it cool about 20 minutes before serving.  The only time I've made a substitution was when I was given a load of Acorn squash and tried substituting it for the potatoes.  I did some draining to make sure it wasn't too moist - otherwise the substitution worked very well.  It had a slightly different texture, but puffed up great and only lasted one night in the fridge!

This is the best sweet potato recipe I have ever had!  Love the blend of sweet potato and pineapple. Every year I am blessed enough that a sweet potato farmer gives me a box of sweet potatoes.  I am sharing this recipe with him.

Excellent recipe! Texture is light, sweet, and very tasty. 

I crushed fresh pineapple instead of using canned - I felt it was 10X better that way. I also used real butter and homemade vanilla extract. Major YUM factor. :)  

All in all a wonderful alternative to a traditional sweet potato casserole.

I wanted a different twist on sweet potatoes this year. This was fairly easy, baked beautifully and I received many compliments. I added a few chopped nuts on top for interest. I gave it 4 stars because it was really more sugar than would be my first preference. Next time I will try cutting it.

This was a perfect recipe for my husband on a soft diet after dental surgery. It was the first time I ever tried a souffle. Wish I had taken a photo of this. It rose nicely and was very visually appealing. I did a different method on the topping: I mixed 1/4 C sugar,1/8 C All-purpose flour, 1/8 C self rising flour, 1 egg and 1 C drained crushed pineapple. It was great!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it! It just seemed perfect for Easter and it is! I adjusted quantities for a large crowd. The potatoes were a bit more than doubled, like 8 cups so I doubled the eggs plus 1 extra. Everything else was doubled with a bit more. I also used butter, don’t like margarine. And fresh pineapple. It was light and fluffy texture, puffed up very nice. I will be making this again.
