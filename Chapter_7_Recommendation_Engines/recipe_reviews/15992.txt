I chose this rum cake because it had frosting instead of a glaze and it did not disappoint us!  It tasted better the 2nd day, although was still good on day one.  It was moist and had just a faint rum taste, which I liked.  I don't generally like cakes that taste like they were soaked in rum.  Excellent recipe!

I served this cake for desert Christmas day and thought that it was good, but not exceptional. The chocolate frosting did not sound good to me so I just sprinkled the finished cake with powdered sugar.
