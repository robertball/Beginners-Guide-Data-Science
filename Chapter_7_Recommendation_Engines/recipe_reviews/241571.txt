This is my second time making this recipe and we had to double it this time just so we had enough for my four person family (and extras for my lunch the next day of course!) a good tip is to paper towel the potatoes wedges dry before you put in oil so the potatoes come out extra crispy. We put them in the oven for 40 mins and it's a perfect amount of time. We paired them (this time) with the "melt in your mouth meatloaf" recipe on this site and steamed broccoli. It was a wonderful and filling meal that I will be making again soon!

Easy Roasted Potatoes Haiku: "The dill surprised me! Wouldn't have thought to use it. These were pretty good!" I usually roast my red potatoes w/ rosemary, thyme, or just a couple good grinds of s&p, but the addition of dill weed here (which I was leery of it), turned out tastier than I expected! The directions and timing were just fine; I didn't change anything other than to scale back for 3 servings, and stir/flip the potato chunks a few times at the 20 and 30 min. mark to ensure more even nummy browning.

Delicious!  I've always loved dill with potatoes!  Great here too.  Note that if you make a very small amount of potatoes, as I did for Hubs tonight, these will need far less than the directed 40 minutes cooking time.  I used just a few little new potatoes and they were done in just about half that time!

I used a Yukon gold potato since I couldn't pass up a sale and dill seed instead of dill weed. I used the small potatoes that I could half and not have to flip half way through cooking. I like the dill which I had never used before in roasting.

It came out exactly as the recipe stated.  My guests raved about the flavor and were surprised to hear dill was used..  Thanks.

Great recipe for roasting any vegetable. Replaced salt and used Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic spice to keep it low sodium.

Perfect. Finally the right time and temp. I had very small potatoes, so I did shave off about 5 minutes, but otherwise everything was great. Great job, McCormick. P.S. The dill is great!

I loved this! 40 minutes was exactly how long it took to roast. Next time I might use just a little less dill. Personal preference. Great leftovers too!

These were delicious. Just the right combination of spices. These will be a regular addition to our menus.

Nice flavors from the herbs. Never used dill on potatoes before. Really liked it.

I cooked a meatloaf for an hour at 350 at the same time. When I took the meatloaf out, the potatoes weren't quite done, so I turned the heat up to 400 and let the potatoes cook for 15 minutes longer. 10 minutes would probably been long enough, but they were still delicious!

Thought of using one of those packets to roast potatoes at the store, but there was a lack of them when I went there.  This recipe saved me.  It was easy and I had all of the ingredients.  Went over well with the family, which was the important part of this.

These potatoes were well received by my family. They were delicious with ham and corn. I used three large russets that were peeled and cut into eighths. They cooked for about 45 minutes. Will make again soon

Ready to go in the oven. My kids call them "wedding potatoes" since they are often served  at receptions. We love this simple side dish.

I halved the recipe, because I used a small bag of the mini-potatoes, which I further cut into more uniform pieces. Very flavorful with the dill and garlic powder. I also stirred the potatoes about half-way thru. I believe I cooked them for about 28 min. You just have to keep an eye on them so they're not overcooked.
