My husband and I both really liked this! I used frozen broccoli florets and just heated them up until all the extra moisture from them was gone. I added a touch of turmeric in addition to salt and pepper too. Next time I will probably go 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce as the noodles absorbed a lot of it (and I like saucy mac and cheese). This makes a whole bunch of mac'n'cheese so there will be plenty of leftovers (no complaints here!)!

Creamy and yummy. I used jalapeno white cheddar (as this is what I had on hand) but would like to use sharp cheddar next time. Used 1 onion. Substituted almond milk for regular milk. I will definitely make this again. For homemade bread crumbs use 1 slice bread.

This was pretty good but I definitely agree with other reviews that said it needs more flavor. I had added some garlic powder and red pepper flakes into the sauce but I think next time I ll add more flavor or jalapeños or something. Definitely makes less than the serving size says. I made it for what it said was 5 servings but my husband and I ate it all alone (and we ate pretty normal servings with seconds).

Turned out perfect! I made half the recipe for 2 people and had plenty leftover. Used Italian breadcrumbs for spice.

I made this but I added 4 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of sour cream it was good but not cheesy enough. Next time I will add another 8 ounces shredded cheddar and mozzarella.

I thought the pasta was good but nothing special. I had added a bit of bacon to it because bacon. Felt it could also use a bit of seasoning maybe some hot sauce? And more cheese. There s never enough cheese.
