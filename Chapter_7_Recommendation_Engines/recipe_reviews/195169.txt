Wonderful!!! I was looking for recipes to use the oodles of mint growing in my garden.  This is a winner.  I used half of a large pork tenderloin and marinated it over night.  It was sooooo good that I marinated the other half of the tenderloin and we had the same thing two nights in a row!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I made a major mistake making these--grabbed what I thought was mint, but it was marjoram (I don't have either fresh--it's winter here) so I accidently used both 2 tbs marjoram and 2 tbs mint.  It actually turned out great that way!  I love the way mint enhances meat, and it went well with the rest of the ingredients.  I used already cut pork cutlets (6 of them), and the marinade was just enough to cover them.  I had very little marinade to dispose of, which is always a plus.  I love the chili and other Thai flavors in this, and the mint gives it a nice earthy taste.  I served these as cutlets with veggies and a roll; I'm sure they'd be great as sandwiches too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it! This will definitely fall into the rotation this summer and prepared again and again.  I made only one substitution based on what I had on hand - I used a Thai Red Curry Paste (and slightly less) in place of the Chile Paste.  Served with Creamy Dill Cucumbers on the side. Fabulous!

Yummy! I used thin chops and pounded them so they were really thin. Served on seasame buns with lettuce (hubs doesn't like cucumbers), a sauce of mayo, mint, and garlic powder and topped with Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce. Very nice. Will definetly make this again!
