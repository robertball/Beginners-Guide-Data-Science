I was so happy to see this recipe because I thought that my family were the only ones who made this "strange casserole"  We had this often when I was growing up (one of 8 children.)  I made this for my husband, and so did my sister for her husband (he calls it cat food).  Anyway, it always gets eaten, so call it what you want!  To those of you who add pasta, it just isn't the same, you really just need to try it in the original form, it really isn't a noodle dish. Thanks for posting this wonderful old family favorite.

I only gave this recipe a 4 because I always have added peas, and think it tastes better with peas in it.  :)  Overall, a GREAT recipe!  I have been making this for years, the recipe was given to me by my father.  Great recipe to make with children, also.  (They like to crumble the chips, especially).

I grew up on this with a few exceptions.  We made a sauce using one can cream of mushroon, 1 cup of milk and 1tsp worchestire sauce.  Then we layered the casserole beginning with potato chips, tuna, corn and sauce.  We repeated layers ending with the chips.  My kids have grown on this also and love it.

Very easy to make and tasty.  I add shredded low fat cheddar before baking, and serve over elbow noodles.  We eat this on a regular basis!  Tastes just as good re-heated.

I love this recipe...old family favorite. Green peas are great in this dish and really give a better texture along with the chips. I don't think I would like it with cheese, but I may try it. It's great to see this oldie but goodie on here. Enjoy:-)

this was a favorite of mine growing up, but we called it "mock chicken casserole". i now make it for my own family with the addition of hard boiled eggs, peas, broccoli and shredded cheese.

Great basic recipe ~ I've always layered my casserole with layers of peas & tin mushrooms. Looks really fancy in a glass dish for a pot luck.

The main problem I had with this recipe was the salt content. Because of the use of chips, the salt content shot through the roof. I am not one to use an excess amount of salt as it is, and this simply contained too much. Also, the tuna was a bit overpowering, which could be because the flavor was enhanced by the salt. I think I would try this recipe again, but instead I would find an unsalted or lightly salted chip, and use more soup and less tuna.

Yummy!  I did make some minor changes though.  I didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, so I used one can cream of mushroom and the other can cream of chicken.  I also added cheese to mine.   I served it over rice.  It was a little like 'gravy' consistency so I might try just one can of soup the next time with a little milk like some other reviewers have suggested.

I ate this all the time growing up but it really needs rice with it. Also, pringles are the best potato chip to use!

Add peas, cheese, pasta and I used crackers instead of potato chips.  Kids liked it.

I had this recipe growing up and loved it too.  We put potato chips on the bottom of a round casserole dish (smush down a little) about an inch worth. Then layered - tuna, then soup mix (add seasonings if you choose). Top with crushed potato chips.  Sometimes I top with a little french fried onions.  The chips on the bottom will make like a crust almost- crispy.  No noodles, no peas, plain and simple.  And OH so good.  I still fix it when I want comfort food.

To keep the casserole from being too runny, use one can of crm. of mush. then add milk until it's a nice consistancy. (I do this before adding the chips.)

A quick and easy meal.  Perfect for the days when you don't want to spend time in the kitchen.   It deserves 5 stars just because of how simple it is but I gave it 4 because it didn't have pasta and I think it needs it.   I added pasta to the soup/tuna mix as someone had suggested because I wanted it to be hearty.  Crushing chips on top is a great idea.

This is a very basic tuna casserole recipe. Good (for family) on its' own, it does improve with the addition of one or two traditional vegetables - peas, broccolli, etc. I like to add noodles to make it heartier, and also an egg or two to give it that 'custard-like' consistency. - If you didn't like this in the grammar school lunchroom or at grandma's house, you may not like it any better now, but with a little imagination you can transform the base recipe into something quite pleasing to you and your family. Thanks, MFMS, for the return of this classic!

OMG!  I also grew up with this recipe with the exact ingredients. We were five kids plus Mom and Dad and money was tight so this fed everyone.  I thought it was my Mom's recipe..haha guess a lot of homes at the time needed to stretch that dollar.  I love this recipe but not my husband so I only do it occasionally.

Made this for my husband and me this evening and we really loved it!  I did add one 8 1/2 ounce drained can of peas like some others had suggested and also sprinkled lots of pepper on before serving.  Next time I will use the tuna in water instead of tuna in oil and I think it will be even better.  This is a keeper and soooooo easy.

My mom used to make a tuna casserole similar to this and in fact, I didn't know that tuna casserole was usually made with noodles until about 3 years ago (I'm 30 now). It's nice to see others have discovered and enjoy this odd combination.

I omitted the Cream Of Mushroom, In it's place I used Cream Of Celery, My kids Totally Loved it. Sometimes It don't even make it to the oven, I just mix all of the ingredients(omit the chips)in the pot and serve. It is more Creamier.

My mom showed me how to make this one day and now I make it for my boyfriend when I really don't feel like cooking. Instead of plain chips I use bbq potato chips. We also eat it over rice. It's great!!

This is my kind of recipe, 3 ingredients, 15 minute cook time and comes out tasty. It is by no means a gourmet dish but it feeds the family and it is easy enough to make even on the busiest of nights

I grew up eating this casserole just about every week. My mother added a half a can of milk so that it was not dry and added some black pepper (as do I).

I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer - this is not a tuna noodle casserole - adding pasta makes it a different dish. I never knew that there was a thing called a tuna noodle casserole until I moved away from home.

Hadn't had this since I was a kid.  This was always one of my dad's favorite meals.  Very good.

I made this for dinner tonight. Not only was it simple to make, but it was very tasty!! I added a few things though, peas, corn and noodles. I also sprinkled it with some oragano and basile. It was wonderful!

I didn't have any noodles in the house but was craving a tuna casserole, when I remembered this recipe that I had previously passed on.  I am so glad I didn't have noodles. I may not have tried this. It is a different dish, but just a good as traditional tuna casserole.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. I was looking for comfort food that I could make with things I already had since our finances are tight this week. I settled on this. I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used one can broccoli cheese, and one can cheddar cheese soup. I added a can of corn. Without some type of starch in it, it's really just tuna salad made with soup instead of mayo, so to make it more hearty I added 1 1/2 cups macaroni (measurement is from before the noodles were cooked). I didn't have potato chips so I crushed up some corn flakes and sprinkled that over the top. I like my casserole more dense and felt this had too much cream soup. Next time I will only use one can of soup. I also thought it needed some pepper to taste. For next time, I will add either frozen peas or frozen chopped broccoli, and use cream of mushroom soup and top with cheese.

I followed the advice of others and added Penne Pasta and cheese. I used Pringles Light, Sargento Mexican Reduced Fat, and 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom Soup. Yes it is quick and easy. Yes it is filling. I will probably add some alternate spices next time for a little more flavor.

I should have read the reviews before making this dish.  It was a little runny and needed the noodles to give it body.  I also had to cook it about 35 min. and it was still not firm.

Very easy to make.  I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic (for the soup) and a bag of Baked Lays chips.
