I wanted to add this review as others found that the dried beef is too salty.  The solution to salty dried beef is to remove much of the salt.  Place the beef in a bowl of cold water, swish it around and allow it to soak for a few minutes, drain and pat each piece dry before chopping and adding to the recipe.

My mother-in-law warned me about the flavor of dried beef, but I wanted to try this anyway.  I  know what she meant now--either you like the taste of dried beef, or you don't!  It was a bit too salty for our tastes.  Thanks anyway!

My family and I found this recipe very good.  Did soak the beef for a bit knowing that its alittle salty.  It came out great.  Was really easy.  Used shredded cheese as that is what I had on hand.  Would be good with Pastrami and rye bread breads on top too.  Will make this again.

We love dried beef, and this was almost like making chipped beef & gravy and just adding the noodles.  I added crushed ritz crackers since didn't have chips for the top but otherwise made as the recipe said and we thought it was pretty good.  A little bland but more pepper helped with that.  Thanks Grandma!

I cut the recipe in half as there are only three of us.  I did use the full 4 oz package of dried beef.  All three of us liked it and will make again.  Kenny G.

Excellent! Tuna would be good also instead of the dried beef.

This was a little too salty for my family.  If I tried it again I would try using low sodium soup, but I'm not even sure that would cut the salt enough for us.  Thanks anyway!

This was pretty good, although I think using a different type of meat would make it better. Dried beef is just a little too salty. But it was an easy peasy recipe.

My whole family really liked this.  I soaked the meat first, like others recommend, and I used dried cubes of bread instead of the potato chips.  The other thing I did was crumble a little cooked bacon over the bread cubes--maybe the equivalent of two pieces of bacon.  My opinion is that it is fine.  It is definitely comfort food and inexpensive to make.  I think it is a little dry, though, but like I said, my whole family liked this.  My son keeps coming back into the kitchen for more.

I didn't have potato chips so I used fried onions. Turned out great!

This was pretty good. I soaked the dried beef first and this really got rid of a lot of salt. I added 4 oz of shredded cheddar cheese since I didn't have the processed loaf cheese which also cut down on the sodium as well. Finally I added peas and a touch more milk. Good flavor, though I might not need to soak the dried beef first if I do it this way next time. I'll probably skip the peas and add mushrooms next time as well.

We liked this very much. Boyfriend likes lots of meat so I added 1/2 lb of dried beef and used cream of celery soup since I don't like mushrooms... Think I would also try buttered bread crumbs next time to eliminate some of the salt.
