Love it! Thanx for the recipe - it's easy and very tasty and a variety of add-ons can be used to get a completely new spread: dried tomatoes or crushed, smoked almonds or some finely cut basil. Too many varieties to mention.

This is really good, and it gets better if it has time to mellow and blend, overnight at least and day 2 even better still. I had a lot left over and used it to make broccoli cheese soup -- Oh YES!

Love this recipe. It has just enough sharpness, although I guess that could change based on the cheese. 
The first time I made it is just used a mixer,  and would agree that the texture was off. The second time I used the mixer, then transfered small amounts to my food processor  (it is only 2 cups, 3 at best). Then mixed the processed cheese again to make sure it would all be the same. Much better, good enough to give as gifts.

This is really good stuff. I added some jerk seasoning and black pepper instead of Tabasco, and I liked that really well.

Just a heads up: if you have a smaller food processor, this is going to take a while, even if you half the recipe. Either be very patient or go with a different recipe. Even doing it in sixths, it was very slow going.

Very good!  Exactly as beer cheese should be!  I halved the recipe, and it still made plenty for a crowd.  In an effort to use up leftover cheeses from various holiday recipes, I used a little over half cheddar and the balance was mozzarella and fontina.  I used a decent pale ale for the beer.  It was so good that I plan to make this again with all cheddar as the recipe states. It goes great with buttery (slightly sweet) crackers (like Ritz).

Really very tasty just as described.  Was a touch salty to me so I'll probably dial the salt back a touch since there's salt in the Worcestershire and the hot sauce.  I had used a decent amount of hot sauce as well.

I had to halve the recipe, to fit in my processor.  Best recipe I've tried!
