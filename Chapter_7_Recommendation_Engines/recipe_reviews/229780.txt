Since this is a baked omelet, there is no need to dirty a skillet, too.  While the oven is preheating, just put your butter, onion, bell pepper and ham in the dish you are going to bake it in and place that in the oven until "sauteed" and heated through to your liking while you are beating the eggs and milk and then stirring in the S&P and cheese.  When the onion, bell pepper and ham are ready,stir them into the egg mixture then pour the whole thing back into the baking dish and bake.  Less dishes to do.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe. I cannot believe the review where an individual changed the entire recipe & then gave it 3 stars saying it came out dry, but that next time they will be making even more changes and the recipe will then be a 5 star recipe. Rewritten recipes should be submitted as new recipes, and not used to criticize someone else's recipe. It had to be said!

First of all, I am sick and tired of people giving low ratings on a perfectly good recipe, just because they changed the ingredients and didn't follow the recipe as written!  That says something for YOUR cooking, not the person who submitted the recipe.  Change if you must but enter your changed recipe and then let people judge your entry.
I found this recipe to be very good and reminded me of what my Mom used to make when I was a kid.  I have made it EXACTLY as written and would not change a thing!  Very easy and everyone loved it.

Really good and really easy.  I had a cooked potato left from dinner last night, so I peeled and cubed it, and added to the egg mixture.  I used a 16-oz container of Egg Beaters instead of the eggs to save on fat and cholesterol. I just poured the egg substitute mixture into my new ceramic-lined skillet, popped it into the oven, and it cooked perfectly at 25 minutes.  After baking, it slid right on to a plate with no sticking whatsoever (and I saved one dirty dish).  Next time, this omelet will travel from Denver to Mexico because I plan to add some jalapeño and serve with salsa, sour cream, and some chopped cilantro.  Wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company for brunch (or lunch as I did today).*****UPDATE 3.1.17***** We never tire of this recipe, such a winner and so easy!  Did a little Mexican spin on it today by adding chopped cilantro and some red pepper flakes to the omelet itself and garnishing it with salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar, and jalapeños.  Delicious, as always!

Very easy Sunday breakfast for my husband and me. I reduced the serving size to 3 and used a pie plate. I baked it for 20 min. I also tossed in a couple of baby bella mushrooms and sprinkled some reduced fat cheddar cheese on top. Delicious!

I've been making these for years, but I use my iron skillet!  I saute the veggies in the skillet then add the beaten eggs and top with cheese.  I sometimes add diced potato as well like a previous reviewer said, and sometimes mushrooms. Pop it in the oven until done, it only takes about 10-15 minutes since the pan is already hot and the bottom mostly cooked. I call it a frittata!  Easy and delicious1

Grandma used to make this about 60 years ago and I followed in her footsteps. I make it in a deep cast iron fry pan cooking shredded potatoes until nice and crisp, then adding eggs etc. and put in oven. After it sets, I top with more cheese, red & yellow thin sliced bell peppers and let finish. Oma used to call it a FARMERS BREAKFAST and so do I. Fresh spinach and other fresh veggies mixed into the mixture is fantastic, let your tastebuds guide you! Be aware though that mixture will at least double in size, so make sure you have a VERY DEEP fry pan or fry potatoes first, layer them on bottom of deep baking dish and add rest of stuff, works as well!

Delicious! I am not a fan of green pepper or onion but I like the flavor in certain dishes and I was feeling adventurous so I fixed this. I scaled this down to 1 serving (2 eggs) and I minced my pepper and onion very tiny before cooking so I wouldn't encounter large icky pieces of it while eating. I used smoked dinner ham and I do think using a good quality and flavor of ham makes a difference in this dish. I was really not expecting to like this but trying to expand my food boundaries, and hesitantly took a bite. Oh. My. Goodness. My mouth is in heaven. I devoured this whole thing and it was fabulous to the last bite. This turned out moist and not at all dry like I thought. I didn't have the proper size baking dish so I lined a pie plate with aluminum foil and bent it up to make a small foil "boat" in the size I needed. I still can't believe how delicious this dish was!!! Thanks for sharing and I am soo glad I tried this.

Good, basic, simple recipe, just extremely vulnerable to user error which can easily affect the outcome for a less than perfect result.  Mine was tasty enough, certainly edible, but I over baked it.  So, here are some suggestions to learn from my “I should have known better” mistakes.  I think the 400 degree baking temperature was high to begin with.  I’d play it safe and go lower, 350-375 degrees.  I used a Le Creuset cast iron skillet, which conducts and retains heat so much better than other cookware, so another reason to lower the baking temperature and/or reduce the baking time.  Finally, be mindful of the size pan you use and how thick the egg mixture is in the pan, and adjust the baking time to take that into account.  A thinner omelet will not take as long to bake as a thicker one.  In my case this morning, I made all the above mistakes and one more – not checking on the omelet now and then while it was in the oven.

I made this a little differently than the recipe reads.  I microwaved some frozen spinach, squeezed out the water, and made 6 slices of bacon and chopped it up.  I mixed the 8 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, spinach, bacon and about 1 cup of shredded Mexican cheese.  I poured it into a buttered 9" cake pan.  400 oven for 25 minutes.  Turned upside down on a plate it slid right out.  It was tasty but dry.  Next time I'll add more milk.  It was really easy and next time it will be 5 stars.

This was good. Not as delicious as regular stove top omelette, to me, but I was glad to find this method because I am omelette challenged! Doing it on the stove top, it always turns into cheesy scrambled eggs. I cut this down to 1 serving (but threw in a third egg because it was the last one left in the carton) and used the smallest of my corningware casserole (holds like 2 cups of liquid I think). I forgot to pay attention to the oven temperature indicated in the recipe and cooked it at 350. This was fine but took longer obviously. I wonder if it ended up being a happy mistake; maybe at 400 the eggs would have browned too much for my liking. I would certainly make this again, with many different mix-ins.

Great recipe and great method.  Just two of us here, so I bake this in four eight ounce ramekins and we eat two and have the other two for the next day.  You need to do is microwave them covered about a minute each and make some toast and a side of fruit!

We L.O.V.E. this recipe and its one, that we make at least once a week, I love it just the way it is written, but we have made it with different ingredients..basically what we had on hand and no matter what, it is delish!! I always add a little dill and we prefer it with swiss cheese, it takes the recipe to a whole new level for my family! Thanks for sharing!! This is a family favorite for us.

I used chopped RED bell pepper and turkey ham. We all liked this a lot. I served it with homemade salsa/sour cream on the side and with toasted english muffins. WE ATE IT ALL.

I made this using the EXACT recipe as stated!  It is delicious!!  This is one of the easiest baked breakfast dishes I've made and in MY world easy is good! Luckily, the flavor is wonderful as well. I'm sure this recipe can be changed or other ingredients added according to personal preference, but if you're looking for a VERY tasty and VERY easy breakfast dish for the family or company, this is it!  Many thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe has become a staple.  It is so simple, so easy, so fast I can't imagine not liking it.  I've added other ingredients, like whatever is left in the vegetable drawer.  I've used my mixer to really beat air into the egg mixture and ended up with a mini souffle.  I make the recipe in a 9" cake pan.  I serve it sliced (8 pieces) with 2 pieces a serving.  A wedge salad or soup make it a satisfying lunch, brunch or snack for that matter.  There is nothing to change about the recipe.

This is delicious and so easy to prepare. We pour the mixture into an unbanked pie crust, bake it for 30-45 minutes@ 350*, and call it a breakfast quiche. It is really tasty with warm blueberry muffins and a bowl of fresh fruit.

I use cottage cheese (small curd) instead of milk for fluffier eggs.  Any filling works - for vegetarian, try spinach and mushrooms.

After you cook the onion, let the skillet cool a bit, then pour in the rest of the ingredients. Less dishes! °375. half and half instead of milk, and a pinch of Italian seasoning.

Tried it today after church so it was more of brunch dish. Family loved it! They all went back for seconds and almost finished it. I will definitely make it again. I may throw in some diced green chiles to add some kick.

It  tastes good and can be the base used for many variations.  Use a cast iron pan to cook the veggies and you don't need to use a second pan.

This is an excellent recipe. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe said. The second time I used bacon instead of ham and added a finely diced tomato! So it's easy to customize for any picky eaters you may be trying to feed. And the best part is that it was good enough for my family to ask me to make it again!

This recipe is a great base for a baked egg casserole. You can basically put anything into it that you like in a omelet. Since I generally make everything in quantity to freeze for later meals, I won't post all of the changes that I made. I have posted a modified recipe that I used. Portions of the casserole can be frozen for future meals, and I also freeze smaller portions for my mother for breakfast. This is a wonderful way to provide a healthy breakfast without the daily cooking. My Mom loves the variety to her breakfasts. I personally added a few more ingredients, but that doesn't diminish the quality of this recipe as a greater starter to get ideas.

This is excellent and my husband's favorite of all the breakfast casseroles I've tried from Allrecipes.  I like adding a little fresh basil chopped.  I needed to have 6 servings so used 12 eggs and put the mixture into a 7" by 11" rectangular pan.  It was done in about 20 minutes so keep your eye on the pan so it doesn't overcook and dry out.

I've cooked many omelets over the years but this was my first time baking one in the oven.  It came out really good!  Nice and fluffy...almost like a quiche but without the crust.

This was a Sunday morning hit for me and my sweetie. I added 2/3 cup fresh cooked spinach, 1 roma tomato, reduced eggs to 6, added 1/4 cup white flour to thicken the mixture, added 1/4 cup monterrey jack cheese and reduced cheddar to 1/4 cup. Like another reviewer, I also cooked it in a glass pie plate. It was absolutely delicious paired with hash browns, fresh fruit and mimosas.  This recipe is a keeper.

Yummy, filling breakfast. I saw this in the AR magazine and loved the tip about sauteing the veggies in the oven. Brilliant, why haven't I ever thought of that?? I'm a lazy cook so I loved this tip. I used cut up bacon, cooked it for a bit til it was starting to brown, then added some packaged hash browns that needed to be used up, tossed those in with finely chopped onion, jalapeno, bell pepper and banana pepper (all from my garden and needed to be used). I used buttermilk and a splash of half and half. I obviously can't read correctly because I thought it said 350 and I'm so glad I did that. Mine was a tad bit overcooked at 350. I can imagine at 400 it's way overcooked. I left out the butter since the bacon provided some grease. I used 1 less egg and less cheese (a mix of sharp cheddar and jalapeno jack). We like things spicy. Ate it with a hatch green chili salsa. Husband ate it in a corn tortilla. Very good, thanks for the recipe.

Had some guy friends of hubby's stay over a few nights and made this for their breakfast/brunch before the drive back. Changed it up a bit. Seeded and diced 2 fresh jalapenos, used red onion as it is sweeter, snipped in 6 large fresh basil leaves, a cup of (left over from dinner the night before) roast chicken, some minced garlic and a few slices of Swiss cheese on top, which melted into the eggs and made it nice and gooey; sprinkled top with some red chili flakes and baked it up! The men in my life loved it with warmed flour tortillas,  they all made wraps and gobbled up the whole pan.
Thanks for sharing such a wonderful versatile dish!

This was a really quick, hearty meal. I used pre-diced ham, 8 eggs per other reviewers, and I didn't use the onion or bell pepper. Easy-peasy and delicious as a fast breakfast-for-dinner meal; we all went back for seconds and finished the dish.

I love this recipe, I only made two servings because there is only two of us. I've made it every weekend and sometimes I add sliced baby bella mushrooms, it is delicious either way. Love this recipe. Will try with egg whites tomorrow!

I've been making something like this for years. Sometimes we bake it and sometimes we cook it up in a pan and scramble it all up like scrambled eggs. Then we call it Scrambola. Try adding a little beer in place of the milk (the alcohol cook off). The variations of this are endless. Try different cheeses, meats, and beers to vary the taste. Yummmmmmmmmm.

Delicious! I did not use the butter or cook the veggies first, I also used leftover cubed ham from a shank ham. This was so very good. I love frittata! Served to my family with whole wheat toast.

My family all said the same thing about this recipe.  It was very flavorful (I also added some garlic powder & used bacon instead of ham).  However, it was kind of dry.  I will double the cheese next time.  I served it with a fruit salad & yogurt dressing I got from this site.  Yum

So, I didn't have ham but I had sausage so I made that instead and followed the rest of the recipe as is. I thought it was really good. My husband said it had a very nice flavor. You can easily change this up to move it from Denver to other parts of the world. I can see making this again with onions, mushrooms and spinach. Or tomatoes, onion and a little salsa. I would change the cheese to a milder blend. It's very versatile.

I think this is an easy way to make an egg casserole dish without all the fuss and mess. It was a delicious way to eat eggs. I have tried other egg dishes and this one is great. One can always add mushrooms or what ever veg you might have on hand.

Yum! Just made this forSunday breakfast. Used red bell pepper instead of green (it's what I had on hand), and used turkey ham. Very easy and quite tasty! I would think the possibilities are endless..... you could use tomatoes, mushrooms, and I'm thinking asparagus! Could easily be served to guests for brunch. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

I found this recipe when I was searching for a new way to use up some leftover ham.  This is FABULOUS.  I have a stove-to-oven set of cookware, so was able to do the sauteeing and baking all in the same skillet.  Used olive oil instead of butter, also added a chopped tomato (drained on a paper towel) and a palmful of fresh basil. Substituted cottage cheese for the milk and also threw in a couple of diced string cheese sticks for creaminess. Baked at 375 for about 15-20 minutes, and egg was perfectly cooked.  Made 4 healthy sized servings, which I topped with sour cream and salsa. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks MOMINOREGON... you rock!

This is an awesome recipe for eggs!! I used olive oil and sauteed fresh asparagus until crisp tender, added garlic and mushrooms along w/ the onions and sauteed a few more minutes. Added mozzarella cheese - a little more than called for-and a fresh chopped, seeded jalapeno since I didn't have any fresh green pepper to the whipped up eggs. Used 6 duck eggs and 2 chicken eggs and mixed w/ salt, pepper and half and half.  This made 2 pie pans full of frittata. I baked for 20 minutes- I mis-read the first time and put the timer on for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. THEN, I read the recipe again and saw that it was to cook at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. I upped the oven to 400 degrees and set it for another 5 minutes and the casserole was done. It was set but not brown- Perfect!! Even my husband liked it and he is not a fan of eggs, but since we have 2 ducks and 4 hens we DO eat eggs- I just try to change it up once in a while so I don't have to eat ALL the eggs in the house since my husband isn't fond of them.  I will freeze one pan for another day.  Freezes well! You can make this vegetarian, or it's also perfect if you are eating low-carb! Versatile and Delicious!! Thanks so much for posting!!

This is excellent for breakfast or brunch or any time you want a light meal. I baked mine in a nine inch square, glass baking dish. I like that it can be easily cut into 9 squares. Based on what others have written, it seems easy to add in the vegetables or leftover items or other additions that you like.  I did not add any extra salt. I used ham in mine. And the ham was already salty enough. Also, I think this would make a perfect breakfast sandwich and be much better than what you can get from a fast food place.  Save your money, save your time, and know what is really in your meal!

This was actually very good and I'm normally not a frittata lover. I diced up an onion, half a green pepper, a couple of baby carrots and a celery stalk for variety then threw in 3 asparagus spears that I had steamed. I used 2 garlic cloves because I have so many on hand right now. Basically, I added a bunch of veggies, sautéed them and then did the egg, cheese and milk pour-over. I had thrown in some leftover ham and a couple of slices of diced bacon. My sides were some cornbread and sliced fruit. You could easily serve this with a salad for dinner, too. It wasn't too eggy, which I tend to not like because of the texture. Like bread pudding. 
This was a great use of leftovers, endlessly adaptable. I sautéed it in my cast iron pan and then baked it all off in the over still in the same pan.

I am sure this is probably really good, I use the same ingredients but I cook it on my cast iron griddle, & it is great!

We thought this was very good.  Used 9 eggs, colby jack cheese instead of cheddar, and one grilled brat cut up instead of ham.  Only used about 1 Tbsp. of butter to saute veggies and brat.  Baked in an 8 1/2 x 11 dish.  It looked and tasted great!  Served with Chef John's blueberry muffins, yum!

This was just ok for me. It was more like a frittata recipe than it was an omelet. I used two cups of Monterey cheese and two cups Mexican blend cheese. I also added fresh diced tomatoes. I took other reviewers advice and baked at °350 so it wouldn't overcook.

This was so easy and amazing.  I'm still trying to figure out why it tasted so good!  I did not use butter.  Sprayed a big oven safe pan with Pam and added the onion and used red pepper.  I used chopped up Canadian Bacon as that is what I had and added this to the pan with some chopped up zucchini. Used Mexican cheese blend.  I sprayed a little olive oil in the pan when adding the ham as it got a little dry.  Put everything into the egg and cheese mixture, re-sprayed the pan and popped it in the oven.  It was done in about 20 minutes.  The kids gobbled this up and I had to have seconds.  Would be good for guests and easy for Christmas morning.

Oh my Goodness, this was Awesome! My teenage boys loved it right off! My husband who hardly eats when its hot! (Log Truck Driver) ate 3 pieces! I did mix a little ideas from others too. I added sliced mushrooms to the end of the onion/green pepper cooking. I added fresh chives and chopped green onion.

Very good, I have made variations and these always go over well. Liked the tip on sauteing the veggies in the pan in the oven first, smart! I added some all-purpose seasoning salt, and also some chopped tomatoes to my section of the pan.

The only thing I did different was add an extra egg and only because I had 9 eggs in the carton and didn't want to keep a lonely egg. Easy to put together and tasty, we had it for dinner with hash browns

This was an ok recipe. The green peppers were overly watery, and leaked into the omelet giving it a weird texture. Overall, I would not make it again.

I needed a fast and easy dinner, this fit the bill perfectly. I omitted the salt and scaled to 12 eggs. I baked it right in the pan after saueting the vegetables and ham. Baked in 20 minutes exactly in my oven. My sons enjoyed this with home fries and tomatoes. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #DinnerUnder30

Loved this easy, comforting breakfast.  Only used 1T of butter, sprinkled onion powder instead of using real onions, substituted Canadian bacon for ham, added some diced grape tomatoes that were on their way out with the green peppers. Used seasoned salt instead of regular salt & used skim milk. Definitely will make again, for breakfast, brunch, or even a weeknight dinner!

very nice and easy... and you don't need the baking dish if your skillet can go into the oven... i use my cast iron skillet and just eliminate the baking dish... i also like to add a potato to mine...it is a matter of taste.

Very good. I made it exactly as stated. The only thing I'd change in the future is the temp. I think cooking it at 375 and checking it after 20 minutes would prevent a bit of scorching on the top.

Really good, but need to reduce oven, and bake for only 20 minutes @375.  Turned out a little dry from over baking.  Really tasty, but time consuming, compared to just making a omelet!

I made this in a 10-inch round baking dish as directed and found it to be overcooked and somewhat dry.  I did take it out at 20 minutes but feel that 400 degrees might be too high of a temperature.  If I made this again I would bake it at 350 for about 20 minutes and perhaps use an 8-inch round baking dish.   It was tasty, though, and was good reheated the next day.

My family loved this recipe.  I will make it again its easy for a Sunday morning breakfast or brunch.  I followed the idea to cook my veggies in the oven first that worked out and then I didn't have to spray my pan for the baking step.

I love trying new spins on old favorites and this one didnt let me down. Even my father gave his highest compliment, "it's terrible...leave the rest for me so you dont have to suffer." I had to use two round pans though because I used 10 eggs and loaded it up with veggies. I also used a roll of maple sausage instead of ham and it was amazing. I literally ate til I couldnt move...it was worth it.

This was amazing! The only change I made was to add mushrooms to the onions and peppers in the skillet. Even my picky teenager ate it and loved it. This one is a keeper!

Delicious! I made this in a cast iron skillet. I didn't have any ham on hand so I substituted cooked bacon for the ham and I added a small diced tomato to the mix.

Excellent recipe!  I added mushrooms and sauteed all of the veggies with ham in a big cast iron skillet, then added the eggs and a mixture of swiss and cheddar cheese before putting into the oven.  This will be a new family staple!

Excellent! Due to our personal preferences, I reduced the peppers and onions to 1/4 cup each, and increased the cheese to a full cup. Served with a side of bacon and sliced tomato for a deliciously easy, low-carb meal.

This recipe is excellent.  It is basic enough for non-adventurous palates, and if you want to vary the flavor, it is easy to do so.  Add herbs, potato, mushrooms, and/or small amounts of any vegetable you like.  Enjoy!

This was OK, but I don't think that I would make again.  The eggs were dry and the moist, tender taste of an actual omelete is more to our taste.

My family loved this recipe!  It is easy to prepare, healthy and delicious.  The best part is that it is very flexible in that you can adjust the ingredients to your tastes.  We used smokey links, red peppers and mozzarella one time; ham, Colby-jack, peppers and spinach another.  A great addition to our menu!

This is quick and easy I did not have ham so I used bacon instead and everyone loved it.  Nice meal when you are in a rush with a salad.

I really liked this simple yet delicious ensemble. Definitely making it again. I substituted spinach for the peppers though,was not in the mood for it that day.

MMMMMM
I did a little variation as well. Exchanged the green pepper with roasted red pepper. 2 mushrooms finely chopped. Used an stove-to-oven fry pan worked well. Served with chunky salsa. Will become one of our fav's of our weekly menu

Used up some leftover ham on this, and it wasn’t terribly different from other recipes I’ve used...but nevertheless, everyone really enjoyed it! I added a little garlic powder to it and added some additional cheese on top in the last minutes of cooking, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

Wonderful!
From a one year old picky eater, and a wild three year old, to three adults, we all loved this. It was so fluffy, and filling. Ill be trying it with sausage soon!

I made this twice now for potluck at work. The first time, I followed it as written and the second time, I doubled the recipe and baked in a muffin pan.  I "NoCanCook" but both times turned out good.  Co-workers asked for the recipe.

This a keeper! Will never go back to breakfast casserole requiring bread.  You can use any combination of meats, cheese and veggies. Baked in a square pan. Did add 1/4 tsp dried mustard.

Absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 a tomato since I like them in my omelettes, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T. It was super easy to make and is going to be one of my go-to recipes from now on. Highly recommend!

Delicious recipe!! I actually made a 'crust' for it by mixing approximately 1-1/2 cups leftover cooked medium egg noodles with a beaten egg, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese & 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Then, spread it evenly in your baking dish & bake for 5 minutes. I then flipped it onto a dinner plate & slid it back into the baking dish to bake another 5 minutes. I then poured the omelette mixture evenly over 'crust' & baked as directed.

The cooked omelette kept well in fridge for couple of days & made a tasty quick grab & go breakfast.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

It was really good. I wish I had increased the size, as my boys put it away and were still hungry. The flavor is good. We seasoned it with Tony chachere’s and added some potato’s. No other changes, as it is good as is.

Family loved it, they all wanted the recipe.  So easy to make and delicious with a spoonful of your favorite salsa.  Baked it in a 9 inch glass pie plate and it was done after 20 minutes.  Definitely will be making it again.

I followed the directions, except for using red, yellow and fresh jalapeño peppers instead of green bell pepper, and it turned out great! Easy and tasty, especially for the evening meal we prepared it for. I will definitely make this again!

First time making this omelette. I will admit I did not make the  Denver omelette; instead made it with sausage ham and bacon.  Most fluffy omelette we have had and no flipping. Made it all in iron skillet.

This is one of my favorite go to recipes.  Bell peppers are a no go in my family so I use green onions, gives the flavor everyone likes and adds the green color.  I serve this with the Quick and Easy Fried Potatoes from this site.  I even got a "goodie" when asked what was for dinner tonight!

I knew this recipe was a keeper at first bite.  I omitted the ham (not much into eating swine) and used a whole green bell pepper.

I made it as per the instructions. We were having overnight guests so I prepared it the evening before and slipped it in the oven in the morning. It was a big hit. Will definitely do it again.

This is probably the tastiest omelette I’ve ever made. I scaled it to 2 servings and made it Greek with feta, tomatoes, onions and spinach and it was very flavourful. Great recipe, thank you!

Easy dish to make...but?  The bake times are confusing. The page time says 35 min but the directions say 25 min. 
  The video uses a skillet in the oven but the directions use a baking dish in oven.  I used the skillet at 25 -26 minutes and it was fine. 
  I don't know what 35 min will do in a baking dish.

Wow! If I can get my daughter to eat a vegetable, I’ve won the battle! This was easy to make and delicious! I added baby spinach because I like spinach. I had to do a half cheese/half regular cheese topping because a family member can’t do cheese. I also added turkey along with the ham but I figure you can add any type of meat...bacon, sausage, chicken, etc. Awesome dish!

This was so easy and yummy!  All my family ate up the whole thing in one sitting. I confess i didn’t put any bell pepper. Just with shredded mix cheese from Costco and whatever leftover cream cheese, it was so good. Hubby even thought that i had put expensive Gouda in. I recommend using fancier, less processed ham if you can. I will definitely make again.

Very tasty! I made it w/o the milk only because I didn't have any, it still turned out good. I omitted the green peppers and used a mexican cheese blend instead. I will definitely make this again! Yum!!

I made this for breakfast this morning and it went over very well with the family. The only thing I altered was that I used one small red onion along with the half bell pepper. This was delicious, along with some hash browns it was a hit. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love this!  So easy; and tastes just like a Denver omelet!  I made it exactly as shown, except I made a one-and-a-half batch and put it in a 9x13 pan.  HUGE hit with my church group!  Thanks for this fantastic recipe.

I agree with many other reviewers. Don't review if you changed the recipe. I cooked as written(eggs were on a serious last week) and used for dinner with hash browns and zucchini. Went over well with both husband and teenagers. I will do "breakfast for dinner" more often.

Delicious! Made it with left-over veggies and creamed spinach on the side. Absolutely fantastic. My recommendation: we added a bit more milk and some sour cream, which turned out extremely yummy, and sprinkled some of the cheese on top.

I used a 1/2 bag of Birdseye pepper stir fry vegetables (green, red, and yellow peppers and white onions) and a little less salt.   Quick and delicious breakfast (and lunch)..

Easy, Easy and add whatever your family loves. From the suggestion of a previous reviewer, I baked ours in a prepared round cake pan. I would however keep an eye as you are baking at the posted temp. I would reduce it by 5 minutes or so. Next time I will add a can of heated diced tomatoes with jalapeños and cilantro. This could make for another great meal. Thank You for Sharing.

We served this at a small church event. Everyone enjoyed it. We made it one day and reheated the leftovers the next day, which were equally yummy. We'll make this again. Thanks for the recipe. :o)

This had all the flavors of a Denver Omelet ! It is great if you need to feed a family without having to wait to make individual omelets.  I added a diced fresh jalapeno and topped the omelet with a little cheese before baking.

It turned out really good!! I substituted halal sausages for ham and spiced up a bit with extra crushed red chilies. The pan was 8 inches instead of 10 but everyone agreed that the fluffier omelet was better

Simple and tasty. Not a fan of onions so I substituted half a red bell pepper. And like another reviewer did, I just mixed up everything in a bowl for one less thing to clean.

Made it for my family today. It was delicious. 
Took a few creative liberties with the veggies and meat to aline it with our keto diet. Will definitely be making it again.

If you put sliced chees on top, put one layer only and not overlapping each other or it will cook slower under double layer.

Doubled the recipe for my crowd (14 eggs). Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used sour cream as half the liquid; half the eggs were eggwhites from the carton; completely omitted the salt (was plenty salty already with the ham and cheese). Turned out great.

This turned out great!  I baked it in a 7X11" pan and for an extra 5 minutes.  I needed to use up some spinach, so I steamed the fresh spinach.  I added 1/3 of the bag, but didn't put the onion and peppers in it.  You could even add mushrooms as an addition.

I sautéed the onion, Tri-colored peppers and ham in a large wok shaped skillet. I used 7 large eggs, a bit of canned milk with a touch of water, had a Mexican blend of cheese. I needed more salt but hubby thought it was fine.  My special addition is tarragon. I had heated oven to  400°F but turned it down to 350°F once I placed everything in the skillet and popped it in the oven.  This was a great use of the eggs we needed to use up.  We'll eat the leftovers tomorrow morning.  I added more cheese 15 minutes into baking and served with some toasted English muffins.  By the time the muffins were toasted (after my cheese addition) it was done. 

Looks great, tastes great, simple ingredients! What's not to love.

Made this for my family for Mother's Day. Everybody loved it and asked me to make it again. I'm only 14 years old with very little cooking experience, but I was still able to make it. I didn't have a 10" pan so I used a 12" pan and cooked it for around 20 minutes.

Delicious!  I reduced the portions since it was just for me and my son.  He loved it!  I'm going to change it up just a little next time, but this is definitely our go to Sunday breakfast now!

This was a hit at my house! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of wilting in a couple of handfuls of spinach when I was sautéing the ham and veggies. It is a 5 star recipe as written, but I like that it is very versatile. I will definitely make this again and experiment with other flavors!

Made three times & will be  using in our rotation. 

Followed recipe exactly as is first two times, and it is 5-stars as is. Kids enjoyed it and husband loved it.

Third time I made changes just to do something different, only (bacon instead of ham, added mushrooms, & hash browns, and so on). 

Very versatile recipe to change out with your favorite omelette preferences but also equally delicious  exactly as written

Great tasty recipe. Followed it exactly and ate with salsa.  The texture of the egg comes out great.  Serves about 3 people.  Would double recipe next time.

This is the simplest baked omelet I have ever made.  The eggs come out so fluffy and the cheese, onions and green pepper enhances the flavor of  the omelet.  My son  looks forward to this when I'm making it for supper, which happens to be tonight.  I am battling cancer and look for easy and simple recipes that are also delicious.  This is one of those without breaking your budget.  Definitely a keeper.

After reading reviews I found the one that thought like me and do it all in a cast iron skillet.btw thanks for the idea of lowering the temp. I used orange and green bell pepper with onion and also added a small amount of jalapeno membrane left over from earlier this week about a half tsp after minced and mashed did the same with a small clove of garlic"about 1 tsp to give a lil warmth and more southwest taste. Whipped the eggs with the milk til air bubbles appeared then folded in some Mexican cheese.a mixture of Colby Monterey Jack asadero and quesadilla cheeses. Took off the heat and poured that in and stirred to make sure everything was well distributed and baked at 375 for 25 mins. It came out perfectly moist and delicious ??

I had started making this when I realized I only had 5 large eggs. So I scaled the recipe down and baked in individual portions,  using a muffin pan.
I also didn't have any ham, but substituted some diced beef Soujouk  ( dried sausage ) that I cooked in the skillet with the veggies. I baked at 375 for 15 minutes. My husband and children liked these omelets /fritatas/egg cakes.. ( names given by the children ). I plan to make again, using different veggies and protein.

I must agree with another reviewer....I made this according to directions but it had a really weird texture-kinda dense and spongy.  IF I make it again, I definitely will add more meat and try to figure out what made this so dense.

I made this recipe as submitted. It was easy and everyone liked it. I enjoyed it with these ingredients, but agree with other comments that the "additions" to the basic egg dish can easily be modified for individual taste and variety.

Pretty easy to make and very good. I made exactly as the recipe stated except I used Canadian bacon instead of ham & I baked in a dark pan so used 375 instead of 400. It came out great.

I made this Christmas morning with minimal effort.  I pre-cooked my peppers and onions and prepped everything so all had to do was wisk together and pop in oven.  Aside from the pre-cooking part, I made as directed in recipe.  It was delicious and just as good left-over the following morning.  I'll be making this again!

No changes. Made a double batch in a 9X13 baking dish. It was a huge hit. Yes, I will make it again. I prepped the ingredients the night before and it was quick and easy in the morning to put it together, toss it in the oven and let it bake while we opened Christmas presents.

This looks wonderful.  I know it will be delish, without even making it.  I will be making this, though.

What I would do differently is opt for an oven proof skillet or pan.  I'd cook the onions, peppers and ham in the skillet or pan, and pour the egg, milk and cheese mixture over the filling.  I'd let it set for minute or so, prior to baking.  This one dish method saves time and clean-up.

This is very good and easy to make. However, next time eliminate the cheese and add just a little more milk. Cheese can be added to top and melted  after it's baked. Also, add a little Lawrys salt and Penzeys Mural of Flavor.

Great recipe, substituted bacon for the ham as that's what I had in the fridge.  Served it with home cooked baked beans, awesome.

I'm not sure if it was just my oven, but I had to bake longer than the stated time and it still seemed a little runny in the middle. I added mushrooms and this may have been the problem although I did salute them before adding.   My husband loved this dish and scarfed up almost all of it at dinner so I definitely will make again.

This was great and very easy.   I made this in a non stick skillet  only using one pan.  The omelet or frittata  (whatever you call it) slid right out of the pan when it was finished baking.  I scaled this down to using 5 eggs,  pepper jack for the cheese and kielbasa in place of the ham.  After the onion and pepper were sautéed I added the eggs , topped it with the cheese and baked it @350 for about 12 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  This is the kind of dish you can just about add anything you have on hand.  Mushrooms,  potatoes, jalapeño.  There are no rules to this one.  A real good change for breakfast.

I've used a recipe close to this before but never baked it. I used coconut milk and baked it in pyrex.  It turned out great, light and fluffy with a little brown around the edge.

It came our well but, the skillet was already hot and ready to just add the eggs, I didn't see any benifit of heating an oven to 400 degrees  for 35 minutes or so just to bake it, seems like a lot of wasted energy!

I made this today with a little bit of a twist, and it came out great. Instead of ham, since I didn't have any, I sautéed chorizo in a separate pan, then added it in with the egg mixture. I also added chopped bacon into the egg mix. With 5 minutes left of baking, I added the remaining bacon crumbs on top and top some cheese and jalapeños.

I love it! I usually make the crust less quiche recipe from Bisquick but I like this one better because it is healthier. I mixed my eggs in the Vitamix while I let the ham and green onion bake in the oven with the butter. I pulled the pan out, added the rest of the ingredients and baked it for 20 minutes. I put foil over the pan after about 10 minutes to prevent over browning. Easyy recipe without the extra dishes.

I make this according to directions and it's so good, easy and quick. Warming a piece the next day is just as good. We have this a couple times a month. Actually, we just had it last night.

Will make this again. Fast and easy, almost foolproof, which is great for me. Halved it for 2 and cooked in same cast iron skillet as onions and peppers. Did sub Spam for ham. Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.

I substituted ground beef and Italian sausage for the ham and used buttermilk.  I also used tortillas to make a crust in individual baking boats (cups).  Great for serving guests or a large family.

This is a new favorite of ours! Super simple and tasty. I didn't use quite as many onions and pepper due to personal taste. I have made it twice now. It will be a regular on our menu.

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I followed it exactly, except I halved it and made it in two separate 5-inch baking dishes because my husband doesn't like onions and I do. (I also may have used slightly more cheese than the recipe calls for.) This was fluffy, flavourful, and incredibly delicious. Also super easy. Perfection. Highly recommended!

I also wonder at people who change A lot of the ingredients and then give it a bad rating. That's just rude. Made this exactly as the recipe states and it was perfect exclamation my family loved it and I will be using this recipe again.

Mine turned out rubbery.  The fault could of been mine as I baked it the allotted time but maybe it was just overcooked.  The only change I made was to use bacon instead of ham, otherwise to recipe.  Just don't feel changing out the meat would have affected the texture.  Mominoregon,  anyway....it was fun to try your recipe!

Very easy. Made it a couple of times and got very nice and soft consistency. On second try, changed recipe for a "sweet" outcome by replacing fill ingredients with strawberries and cinnamon...should have used chocolate. Tasty outcome

Baking this omelet is the only way to go. There is no fear of the eggs tearing apart and of all of the cheese running out while trying to fold it in half while making  an omelet in the traditional
manner.

I've made this twice and loved it. I followed the recipe. It was easy and very tasty with an English muffin. Make sure you double-check the bottom of the omelet. The first time it was perfect, but the second time the bottom was still runny, so I needed to put it back in the oven for a couple of minutes.

Excellent - came out very nicely! Easy to make. I tried the top positive review tip of coking onions and peppers in the oven first, but that took a while - I think I would likely just saute them next time. I will also likely add a little more cheese (personal preference) although it was quite nice as-is!

I try so hard to follow recipes, but somehow or other I always do something goofy.

With this recipe, I left out the green pepper, because neither our visiting guest or my husband care for it.  I substituted bacon that I had cooked in the oven the day before to make prep easier with company here.  I misread the cheese and only put in 1/4 cup, but it was still very good, and the entire dish was finished off.

When I make it again, I will not sauté' the onion in the skillet in which I am going to bake the dish.  The eggs stuck to the bottom of my cast iron skillet.  

I can see adding all sorts of different veggies to this.  Quite easy for the prep.  I will make again, and soon!

Very easy to make.  Absolutely delicious.  I cooked my onions, bell pepper and ham on top of the stove in my 10 inch Lodge cast iron skillet, poured in the egg mixture and then put it all in the over.  Mine took approximately 20 minute in over.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this minus the onion and it was still good.  Will add the onion next time when that family member is not here.

Absolutely delicious, I added more cheese, onion, and bell peppers.  I also added bacon to the top before placing it in the oven.  I cooked the bacon ahead of time and crumbled it up.  My husband and boys loved it, will definitely be making this again!!

I made this today for my husband and myself.  I used 5 eggs because we really didn' t need that much for the two of us.  It was a bit time-consuming because I didn't use ham, I used bacon, but this really is an easy, delicious meal.  I used a 4 cup round pyrex dish and I think it would have been perfect in a small cast iron skillet, but I only have a really big one.  It puffed up so nicely and looked beatiful.  I had to cook it for 25 minutes which I didn't expect, since I made half the recipe.  Next time, I will put more veggies and more cheese and see what happens.  This will be so good with different vegetables also.  Lots of options and a great recipe.  Thanks.

I thought this was delicious and easy to make. I added diced tomatoes and mushrooms to mine. I liked the idea of one reviewer of adding some of the ingredients to the skillet while the oven is  preheating.

I made this with shrimp, green onion & green pepper. I put butter, onion, green pepper in the pie pan & then I put that in the oven while it was preheating.  I whisked the eggs, milk, s&p together. Finally, I added the pie plate mixture, stirred all together & poured back into pie plate & baked. Easy, peezy & delicious. Served with a salad & called it dinner.

I added a grated zucchini to the mixture for extra moisture and I baked  mine in a 9X13 pan lined with parchment paper.  I cut it up into squares and that's my breakfast for the next few days, just heat and eat.

Made changes. Great basic recipe.  I used green onion,  portobello mushrooms, 3/4 cup ham.   Sautéed  all three, warmed the ham.  Followed directions as written.

Great versatile recipe. Made this with six slices of crumbled bacon, Monteray Jack cheese, fresh spinach from our garden, and leftover couscous from the night before. Did not cook the onion before adding to the egg mixture, but wilted the spinach. Will definitely make again with different meat and vegetable combinations- such as ham and asparagus.

This all seemed like a straightforward frittata and by golly it is ! You can always saute your ingredients in a non-stick pan, add the cheese to your beaten eggs and pour this egg/cheese mixture into the pan. Let it cook for 2 - 3 mins, then put the frying pan under a heated grill for 3 - 4 mins. Same result except the grilling tends to puff up the frittata a bit.

The bell pepper makes the omelet heavy and not as fluffy and light as expected. Without the bell pepper the omelet is light and fluffy. I made this omelet a second time and replaced the bell pepper with tomatoes. The tomatoes made the omelet light and fluffy. I also used 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese rather than 1/2 cup. Also feel free to add many other items into omelet if you follow the recipe alone it seems kind of plain. Although the baked omelet is very tasty and a great breakfast dish.

This was a nice change from my usual omelet, since it allowed me to sit down and enjoy some coffee while it was baking.  My only change from the submitter's recipe was to swap out red bell pepper for the green, since that was in my fridge, and I wasn't ready to change clothes to run to the grocer.  DH approved!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent! Light and fluffy like an omelet should be. I used linguica in place of ham, but all the other ingredients were exactly as recipe stated. I baked it in a 10 inch skillet greased with Crisco, slid right out and cut like a pie. A hit for sure!

I made it just as the recipe stated but put my butter vegetables and ham in the oven to saute in the baking pan so I wouldn't dirty up a skillet. It turned out great. My husband loved it so much he took the leftovers with him to work to eat for lunch the next day.

Very good, easy, and like others said, you can pretty much add anything you like. I had a meatloaf in and used this to pop in for the last 25 minutes since the kitchen was already hot and now breakfast is ready for a couple days! We top with salsa and love it. Made as written.

I made as is. Great.  This is a Denver omelet and the ingredients for this classic omelet got it's name from Denver.  Any other ingredients will not make this a Denver omelet.  I know, I'm from Denver.   
This lends itself to many variations.

With the chopped ham it was kind of salty. Nest time, no salt. Other than that, it was wonderful.

I added an extra egg, about a cup of onions and a cup of cheddar cheese.  Maybe next time some mushrooms.

Instead of milk, I used sour cream, twice the cheese called for, an extra egg & a sprinkle of cayenne pepper....delish!

I'm always looking for easy recipes for egg dishes. I have a few chickens and an overabundance of eggs at times! This recipe was easy and delicious! I wished I had added the mushrooms I had but forgot... always next time!

I love this recipe. I added tomatoes but I am sure without them it would turn out just as wonderful.  Other then tomatoes I follow recipe exactly as listed. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent!  Albeit I had to cook this about 20 more minutes than suggested on the recipe (ovens in Holland don't seem to be as hot).  I added some left over crumbled cooked bacon and some fresh mushrooms that I had leftover.  I will be making this again!

Hubs and I enjoyed this very much.  Since the name of the recipe is "Baked...", obviously that was my intention, but looking at the clock, I realized there was no time for that, so I just continued using the skillet and cooked it as if it were a regular omelet.  Works either way.

Loved it. It was easy to make and so easy to eat. I added some mushrooms. I guess you could add or take away what you want.  I made this for dinner. Thank you for this dish.

I made this exactly as written, except I used an 11"x7" casserole since I didn't have a 10" round. It was delicious for a late, but easy, dinner and leftovers were great warmed in the microwave for breakfast later in the week.  Will definitely make this again. I can see how many of the substitutions recommended by others would be yummy too.

This was so delicious!!!! Even better, it was so easy! I poured the mixture into my 9 inch glass pie dish because I didn't have a 10 inch round baking dish. The 9 inch dish had plenty of room for this and baked perfectly.

Excellent and easy!  Just added chopped mushrooms to the original recipe.  Gayla's suggestion to do the veggie/ham mixture in the oven, using the same pan, worked like a charm and made cleanup much easier!   Invited over friends to have "breakfast for dinner".  Everyone,  including my husband,  raved about it!  I will definitely make this again!

It was good, but when I took it out of the oven and cut into it it was very watery. I'm not sure if it's from the 2% Milk or the over abundance of vegetables I put in it. Like I said it was good but needs some work.

Will make again. Changes we made were adding some crispy bacon pieces to the mix and cooking it in a NuWave oven at 350 for 20 minutes. We are light eaters and this was enough for 6 servings. We cut it into 6 pie shaped wedges put 4 in the freezer to firm up a bit then used a foodsaver to individually vacuum seal 4 pieces. firming up is a must or the foodsaver vacuum will crush it to a pancake. These will last in a freezer for a long time and will be almost as good as fresh when thawed and microwaved.

The recipe is totally adjustable!  I made it as written but see that the fillings can be substituted with whatever is your favorite.  I used my cast iron and eliminated the need for a baking dish.  Easy, and a keeper recipe.  We actually had it for dinner due to an abundance of eggs from our "Chickies".

We really enjoyed it. I only made minor changes - I used green onion instead of regular onion because my husband prefers it that way, and I also sprinkled a little more cheddar cheese on the top about halfway through the cooking. I will definitely make this again.

Simple, easy, very good.  I did as others suggested and baked it in the skillet I used for the onion and pepper.  However, my skillet was black with black nonstick interior, so I should have lowered the temp.  After 20 minutes it was a bit overdone -- but very good in spite of that!  I used bacon instead of ham but would be great with ham also.

I have been making oven omelets since the 1990's without a recipe to guide me (I am 60 something) and have not sauteed my vegetables first.  I make mine in individual bowls, ramekins, 
and zucchini is a great addition.  Thank you for reminding me.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated without making any changes.  It was very good, though not spectacular.  It was extremely easy to make, and I thought it tasted a bit better once it cooled a bit.  I used the red sweet peppers as in the video, and you could taste the sweetness of the pepper a bit more when it cooled some.   Still, it was an easy, tasty Sunday morning breakfast and I've copied the recipe to make again.   Next time, I will probably add sauteed mushrooms to it and maybe add a dollop of sour cream and/or some sweet stewed tomatoes.

This was really good. Great to be able to put breakfast together on a Sunday morning and then read the paper while it bakes.  Followed recipe except added a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  It was moist and flavorful.

This is a very easy recipe.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I added a layer of sliced canned potatoes, red peppers, scallions, fresh spinach, bacon bits and ham, mushrooms and four slices on top of Swiss cheese as that is what I had on hand.  It was delish.  My daughter and I had it for dinner tonight and we have leftovers for lunch during the week.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  Good flavor and quick.  I cooked it in the cast iron skillet that I had cooked the onions and bell pepper in.  Made clean-up even easier.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out lovely and we all enjoyed it very much.  I will certainly make it again.  Let us remember that when we give "our reviews" it's for the EXACT RECIPE as given.  It's not right to change the recipe and then rate the posted recipe poorly.  We're not interested in "your" version of the recipe.  If you want to do that then I suggest you submit "your" version of the recipe and let it be rated for how you made it.  Your being asked to review (if you care to), "this" recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make. The taste was amazing and we loved it. Put a dollop of sour cream on it and either chopped green onion or parsley. We will be making this again.

I diced a potato and parboiled that, then added it along with the cooked onion, green pepper, and ham.  Loved it.  Gave it a spanish flair.

One mistake I made was that my pan was a little smaller in diameter, so the omelette was about as high as it was wide -- like a souffle.  I just let it sit for a while after taking it out of the oven which gave time for the middle to finish cooking and the eggs to set.

Still, it was delicious and pretty easy.  It will be a regular on weekend mornings/brunch.

I made this recipe this morning and both my husband and I agreed that it is a definite keeper.  I didn't have any ham on hand so I used Canadian Bacon.  It was moist and flavorful.  I will keep this one in mind to serve overnight guests.

This is very good.  I made it as per the recipe, but instead of using a separate baking dish, I used an iron skillet to saute the veggies.  then I stirred the remaining ingredients together and poured over the veggies in the skillet  Popped the skillet into the oven and baked for the indicated time.  No need to used an separate pan for sauteing and baking.

Mine is still in the oven. Not sure how it will come out cause I changed some ingredients, but I love the simplicity and how easy it is to make. For a non cook here, recipes like this could make me become a chef.

This was great! My first time making anything like this, and was perfect just the way it was written. I added just a few red peppers only because I had them. I will definitely be making this again! Had it with fresh fruit and blueberry muffins, what a great meal.

Simple, hearty, and tasty. Used 10 eggs (since the ones we had weren't the biggest), but otherwise followed the recipe. Didn't have a 10" round baking dish, so I used a 7" x 11" casserole-style one. Consistency was perfect, moisture level was perfect. Might add a couple things next time, but my girl and I loved it this time around.

My mom said "oh boy" when she tried this recipe.  I did add chopped mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions and used bacon instead of ham (had bacon on hand).  Next time I'm thinking of adding spinach too.  Turned out great and was done in 20 minutes in a cobbler stone dish.

First let me say I do not eat eggs because I'm allergic. So testing and tasting was not an option for me during the cooking process. I did minor modifications not because the recipe was lacking but due to family preferences. I used a combination of sweet onions and green onions, added a mix of bell peppers - just for color, eliminated  salt , used a  bit of jalapenos- about a quarter, and a pinch freshly cracked black pepper in the ham mix, about 1/4 cup more cheddar which I sprinkled over the top to serve (again just for the fun of it).

My family went at it like there was nothing else to eat.  It vanished within a few minutes after setting it  a the breakfast table and request came for more!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I have found another way to serve up eggs!!

So glad I found this recipe!  So easy to do when having company for breakfast.  I made this in just a few minutes, put it in the oven & was able to spend time with guests while it cooked instead of spending time working on breakfast.  Recipe is so easy to adjust to available ingredients or number of people you're serving.  I make muffins/coffee cake ahead as well as fruit bowl, great breakfast with minimal time involved!

This is a complicated way to make a frittata. Saute any veggies, over med-high heat, in an oven-proof pan (I like zucchini & onion) with minced garlic until softened. Add any meat (I like turkey ham, less salt) along with crumbled feta cheese. Beat 4 - 8 eggs with a little water & pour over veggies & meat. Lower heat and let sit for 5 - 10 mins. until only top remains uncooked. Sprinkle cheese on top (I like shredded swiss) & place under broiler, using the 2nd slot down, until melted & a little brown.  Cut into pie wedges.

Nothing special.  Made exactly as directed only subbing red bell pepper for green.  It was overcooked at 20 minutes in my oven.

Easy and delicious!  I added different veggies.   However it is ready in 25 minutes not 35. Came out a lil dry 35 but  was still good. Saving for future mornings!

I was looking for a base recipe and this was it. Very easy to swap out the veggies, even increase the amount. I added much more than the recipe called for [peppers, onions, broccoli, tomatoes, diced ham] and added a few more eggs, milk & cheese. Used a larger baking dish and cooked it a bit longer. A hit with everyone. Easy, flexible recipe that's definitely a keeper.

My boys-5 and 8 years old who don't like eggs even loved it.
