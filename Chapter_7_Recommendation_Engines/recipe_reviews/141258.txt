Phoenician Gourmet, you have outdone yourself and this pie absolutely deserves to be titled after you! I have my favorite Key Lime Pie recipe that I have been using for years, and I don't mind saying this recipe will probably take its place. First of all, the crust -the ground, toasted almonds take it to way beyond the ordinary. And then there's the filling - SO extra creamy! The heavy cream was a beautiful addition not only in taste, but its addition makes for a more substantial pie than others, filling the pie plate nicely. The combination of the novel ingredients of almonds and cream make for one, extraordinarily good Key Lime Pie, and with the perfect degree of lime flavor! As the first reviewer of this recipe, I can only strongly encourage others to give it a try! I can't imagine you'd be sorry! Edited 8/7/2011 - I use 1-1/2 tsp. grated lime zest rather than just 1/2 tsp. - perfect.

Fantastic recipe, when key limes are in season, stock up on them, just put in freezer and they are good for about a year, when needed, just take out what you need, better than the bottle stuff, i like my limes fresh, I have frozen lemon and limes and oranges for years. and just as good as the day I got them.

If there were an option for more than five stars, I don't know if I'd ever stop. The best key lime pie I've ever had. EVER. The toasted almonds and refrigerating overnight is a must. My crust was done in under ten minutes and my pie was done in just under fifteen minutes. You HAVE to try this pie. It's excellent.

The quest for "THE" key lime pie recipe is over! This was a smashing success, perfectly tart, perfectly sweet, rich and creamy. The only thing I need to fix is that the crust was so crumbly it was difficult to serve but it was so good I still have to give it 5 stars. Next time I'll take some of the leftover egg whites, whisk them with a fork for a few seconds and brush the egg wash onto the pie shell before baking. I've done that in the past with perfect results.

Yum!  This is a great recipe and really simple.  My only complaint was that I wished it looked a bit greener (it was more yellow-colored from the yolks).  I serve it with some fresh whipped cream to balance the tartness.  I've made it with bottled key lime juice and fresh squeezed limes.  Also, we only chilled it for two hours and it was fine :)

Everyone who likes Key Lime Pie should make this recipe - even novice bakers.  It's delicious and so easy to make. In the past, I always used a store-bought graham cracker crust. NEVER AGAIN!!!  The crust is so easy to make and the difference in taste is remarkable.  The cream is definitely a secret ingredient that changes the recipe from good to great.  I thought the lime flavor was perfect, following this recipe exactly.  Anyone who likes a strong lime flavor might want to add more juice.  I used bottled key lime juice; can't easily get the key limes in Boston.

I love key lime pie and I've had my share of great ones and not so great ones.  This one is definitely in my top two, it may even be #1.  My husband and I ate this entire pie in less than 24 hours. It's that good. Seriously.  The toasted almonds in the crust definitely puts it over the top and I can't imagine using that ready-made stuff again. The filling is very similar to a recipe I've always used that uses another can of condensed milk instead of the cold heavy cream - I really didn't notice a difference in taste between the two.  Either way, this will be my go to recipe for Key Lime pie when we entertain. Loved it!!

This is an excellent key lime pie filling.  I make it with a ginger snap pie crust instead, in a 10" deep pie dish.  I increase the heavy cream to 1 cup and increase the lime juice to 2/3 cup to make up for a large pie pan.

Very rich, because the cream in the filling cuts the tartness.  I enjoyed it, but we like ours tart.

It was my first time trying a key lime pie recipe. I loved the combination of tartness and sweetness at the same time. And the almonds gave the crust an amazing taste. My family loves extra crust ratio to pie filling, so I doubled the crust amount. I made this recipe for my guests who are very hard to satisfy. They Loved it!
Next time I might add 1 tablespoon lemon zest to the filling to boost the flavor. I sprinkled some powder sugar on top to give it a nice finish. I added a photo of my pie you can check it.
Just watch out to completely cool the pie before covering it with plastic wrap to keep it in the fridge. Otherwise you'll find water drops from the wrap making spots on the surface that couldn't be covered not even with powdered sugar.
Thanks for the great recipe. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I used regular lime and it came out great. I'll be trying key limes next. For those that can't get a hold of any...try this: search for newlimeco.com and you might be able to order some.

If I could give it more stars, I would!!!  You have taken Key Lime Pie to the next level.  I only had 1/2 and 1/2 on hand so I used that and it still was the best I've ever made.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

Thanks for the GREAT recipe! I had to toast my own almonds & hand squeeze a whole tree of key limes, but it was worth it. I took this on a hike with some friends and they all loved it and many wanted the recipe! (but will not ever carry a whole pie in a cooler up a hill ever again). I made extra crust; it is the best part of this type of pie; so it had a thick crust and a nice sprinking on the top.

I am wavering between 3 or 4 stars on this recipe.  The crust was a little greasy, and we felt it needed more lime flavor.

Wow! This truly is an amazing key lime pie! (I can only review the filling because I had an extra regular pastry crust to use that day). The filling was just the right amount of creaminess, sweetness (I don't like super sweet desserts), and tartness. I bought 2 bags of key limes and actually zested them instead of the regular limes. Not sure if that was necessary--and it sure was time consuming--but the result was so delicious. To fill my deep dish pie pan nicely, I multiplied all the ingredients by 25% but followed others' advice to double the lime zest. Therefore, it took about 25 of those key limes to get enough juice and zest. I know that the recipe's graham cracker crust will make it even better and that will be for next time! You gotta try this :)

This pie is amazing.  I made this for my family first, it was gone by the end of the night (and there's only three of us).  My mom then requested I make it for a lunch party, and she had people asking her about it for weeks.  It is hands down the best key lime pie I've ever had, and is neither overly tangy or overly sweet.

The almonds in the crust make this recipe.  It balances the tanginess so smoothly.  I also usually add a healthy sprinkling of the Bakers Blend from the Spice and Tea Exchange (which has cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cloves, cardamom, and star anise), and it gives a wonderful little kick of flavor to the crust.

I made this with fresh squeezed limes from my yard and OMG was it good. I'm making it again this weekend for my daughter and her family to try it. If you like the custard type consistancy, you'll love this. I may try the same recipe with lemons and see if it makes a good lemon merangue.

This pie is wonderful! Since I had no key limes, I used half lime & half lemon juice, & it turned out delicious! The best key lime pie I've ever tasted! Thank you for sharing this tastey delight.

The texture was really nice and creamy and the flavor was good; however, it was so sweet I could hardly eat it.  I have quite a sweet tooth and I love dessert, but this was way too sweet for me.  Probably nothing wrong with the recipe...I guess I just don't like key lime pie.  Who knew?

This was my first attempt at making a key lime pie.  This recipe was SUPER easy to follow and now I am in love.  Mildly tart, sweet and delicious!  We'll definitely be adding this pie to our list of favorites.

I put the amount of sugar it suggested and I found it too sweet. Next time I make this I will reduce the sugar content a bit. But other than that it was really really good! :)

I have made this pie for my friends and family many times, and each time I make it, I get sooooo many compliments on how good it is, especially the crust. This pie has become one of my favorite request from everyone when I have get togethers.

Outstanding!  The almonds in the crust make it stand out, and the creamy, slightly tart filling is out of this world.  I will make this pie again and again and again.

Really good and easy to make.  Don't get lazy and use a bought graham cracker crust.  The ground almonds really is a nice addition to the crust and it is super easy to make. The texture is a little creamier than what I'm used to, but overall, a very tasty pie.

This the Best Recipe Ever!!!! I have always Loved Key Lime Pie.  I tasted it once at a restaurant in NYC and have been looking for that same taste since, (restaurant closed).  Now, I have found it!!! This recipe took me back to the exact moment that I tasted a Key Lime Pie for the first time.  Please know, that I am writing this with a smile.  I am so happy to add this to my collection of Great recipies.  Note: I added a half of cup of almonds to the crust and that just gave it a boost.  Thanks so much for this one, I have been searching for so long and now I found the One! ;-).

This review is for the crust portion of the recipe, this makes an absolutely delicious crust, I reduced the sugar by half and left out the salt and my dessert was all the better for it... I used the crust with the "Key Lime VII a less sweet version" a customized version of the original Key Lime VII

Excellent pie!  This was my first attempt at a Key Lime Pie, in fact this was my first attempt at any pie (that wasn't of the instant variety).  This was super easy to make, so beginners don't be shy (my first pie came out pretty ugly, but still tasted fantastic)!  The lime flavor increases each day, but if you do like your Key Lime Pie to be more tart, I would recommend some more lime juice.  
Once I get this baking thing down, I'm going to use my leftover egg whites for a Meringue topping.

A very tasty pie but I didn't think the toasted almonds in the crust made much of a difference considering all the extra work.  I found the amount of lime flavour to be just right and increased after 2 nights in the fridge.  I did get rave reviews from my 2 guests who had never tasted key lime pie before.

This pie was so easy to make and very delicious. My only complaint is I forgot to buy some whip cream, would have tasted great on the pie. The almonds in the crust are amazing.

The best Key Lime we have ever had...great with fresh key limes (from my neighbor's tree) or bottled key lime. I've made this four times in one month!  It's that good! Going to try it with a lemon meringue.

I am teaching my girlfriend's 14 year old daughter to cook.  She loves Key Lime pie and it was time to make something like this.  I read through several of the over 40 recipes. I decided we would try this one.  To add a little science to it, I added green food coloring and taught her the meaning of titrate. It taught her to separate eggs, what sweetened condensed milk is, how to mix with a wisk instead of a blender.  We had fun and a great pie at the end.

I love the toasted almonds in the crust!  I always have added extra zest because I need the "bite" and I always try to cut back on the sugar a little.

Just for the record - I only made the filling, as I had a store bought graham cracker crust on hand, and decided to use that (although the crust recipe here sounds delicious, especially with the addition of ground almonds). The filling is fantastic! Creamy, with little flecks of the lime zest. This was the first time I've ever made key lime pie, and it won't be the last with this recipe! A keeper for the recipe box.

Nearly what I've been looking for. I visited the Florida Keys recently and tasted the best Key Lime pie I have ever had. I have been trying to make a similar pie ever since. This one is the closest I've come so far. I did double the key lime zest (on accident) so it had plenty of lime flavor but the whipping cream cut back some the tartness which is fine by me. I also topped it with whipped cream flavored with lime juice and sugar. Everyone loved it!

My first key lime pie.  In Dallas, it's $9 for a good slice.  It's $8 in Key West.  I almost cried it was so delicious.  Thank you so much.  I'll never pay for a slice again.

This is a delicious pie and it bakes out well.  It's texture is very creamy; the heavy cream is probably why.  However, even though it is delicious, bakes well and is easy to prepare, I prefer a more dense (or thick) key lime pie with more key lime taste.  It could be that by using the heavy cream, it dilutes the key lime flavor.  Once again it is a good pie; just not my favorite. - Linda O.

I made this yesterday following the directions with the exception of using Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice. This is a delicious pie, particularly the filling. The amount of sugar in the crust seemed to over power the taste of the crackers and almond blend. Next time I'll cut the sugar by half. This was in the frig a little over 24 hours and it set up perfectly. Be cautioned --- you cannot eat just one slice of this!!

Excellent Recepie. I made it easier by putting the filling ingredients into a standard blender and it worked fine. A great substitution for graham crackers is ground GINGERSNAP cookies. It really makes quite a difference and have had great reviews from those that have eaten the Gingersnap Crust. .. enjoy .. 5 stars all the way.

I have just returned from Key West where I had to sample "real" key lime pie. Of course it was wonderful. So on my return trip home I was in search of an exact match recipe. This is the recipe!! I just made this pie and have to say that it is nearly exact to what I had at restaurants in Key West. Thanks for sharing, it is wonderful!!

Absolutely delicious! This will be my new go-to Key Lime Pie recipe. My DIL, when I told her what I was making for dessert, said only my son would eat it, not her or the kids. Well guess what? Everyone loved it!! Made as directed except I added more lime zest. Can't wait to have it again!

We had farm fresh eggs, ripe limes, and no cream....so we used plain Zoi yogurt!
Times were good for crust, but we needed an extra six minutes for filling to set up.
The smell is lovely and the taste is delightful!

This is just my first time to comment. 
This is always a flawless dessert! I have used this recipe for several years and made it countless times for cook outs and other gatherings. I usually make two at a time. I double the recipe but start with store-bought graham cracker crusts. I use the left over egg whites and brush the crusts and bake at 375 for 5-8 min. I know you're asking about the almond flavor, but hold on...
I use the zest from a whole lime. Be sure it is ripe/dark green all the way around. I then drop a cup (+/-) of sliced almonds in the mix since the flavor is not in the crust.  This method allows for all the flavors of the original with an easier clean up.

Got rave reviews from all that ate it. I made it with almond flour and through all the crust ingredients in a food processor then patted it into a pie pan.

Being my first Key Lime Pie to ever make or taste, I must say this was excellent and so easy to make.  The taste was Magnificent from the crust to the filling!  I made a tiny change by adding 1/2 sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup cream, instead of the 3/4 cup cream it called for,  in addition to the 1 can of sweetened condensed milk.  I used a 1/2 cup more butter for the crust than the recipe called for as I used 14 graham crackers instead of the almonds   I probably won't look for another key lime pie recipe. It's a Keeper.

Excellent pie! In fact it compares to and probably exceeds the flavor of the key lime pie I had in Key West. Its that good! The only substitution I made was to swap out the almonds for macadamia nuts due to an allergy, but they worked perfectly in this pie! I might even go so far as saying they were made for this crust! Try it if you have some like I did. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Thanks for the fabulous recipe Phoenician. :)

Very good recipe!  It is rich, like all Key Lime Pie,  so it satisfies the sweet tooth well.   I used Fat Free Condensed Sweetned Milk.   I might try using a little less to cut the sweetness next time.  I also took another reviewer's sugestion and used 1- 1/2 tsp of Lime Zest and it was perfect.  The crust was amazing with the almonds.  I used whole roasted almonds and pulsed till fine, but not like (meal) in my small Food Processor.

This has to be the best key lime pie I have had---homemade or restaurant made.  I made two pies for my Bunco ladies and everyone loved it.  The texture is perfect.  The sweetness to tartness ratio is perfect.  The crust is unbelievable.  I did use more zest...using zest from a full 'regular' lime...didn't read the recipe correctly.  I used the bottled Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice. Served with a dollop of whipped cream. Every plate was practically licked clean. I wouldn't change a thing.

Followed the recipe to a T except for having to use brown sugar instead of white for the crust. Everyone loved it and complimented the crust a lot. I think it was because of the toasted almonds.

oh. my. gosh. so delicious! and the lime flavor developed over the few days that it lasted in my fridge. So for those that thought they might want to add a bit more lime juice/zest, maybe you could have waited an extra day, and it would have been perfect. The only substitution I made was that I didn't have heavy cream, so I added 1/2 cup half & half and 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk. It is so creamy I'm sure it didn't make too much of a difference.

Absolute best recipe.  My fiancée said it was too tart, but he's just a big sweet tooth.  I loved it.  I used a little extra zest, wouldn't change anything else.

We followed this recipe exactly and it was one of the most perfect pies I  have ever made. In the words of my young helper, it was 'restaurant quality.' The crust was really delicious and I plan to use it with other recipes.

We thought this recipe was fantastic. We grow our own Key limes in our backyard and wanted to try a new Key lime pie recipe. The crust in particular was fantastic. I really like the edition of almonds for extra flavor. We just let ours set up in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, and it was fine. We couldn't wait overnight! We topped it with whipped cream, and it was the perfect balance to the tartness of the pie. Good stuff!

My entire family loves this pie!  I made it once on a whim, because I was craving key lime pie, and my step-dad asked me to make it again less than a week later for father's day.  I had never made a key lime pie before this, but now I think I will never buy one again.  This is so easy and delicious.  I do like to add just a couple of drops of green food coloring to brighten up the color, but that's just me.

I have tried several key lime pie recipes but never have I come across one this delicious!!! this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I made this for fathers day and it was a hit with my family so much so that I had to make another one the next day. unfortunately I had to omit the almonds from my crust because of family food allergies I can't wait to try it with the almonds. Thank you

Awesome! Just awesome. I used key limes and squeezed each one. If you do that I suggest pouring the liquid through a fine strainer to remove the seeds and pulp. I also made a meringue. This tastes just like the best pie I had in Key West.

This was to die for!!!  Only downside was producing the lime zest, and that was due to not having the proper tool.  I even added the key lime juice at the same time as other ingredients (did't read recipe closely enough) and did not have any resultant problems.  Will definitely make this again.  Kudos to the creator of this version!

I made this pie for a Key Lime lovers birthday and decided to make an extra one for my family. This should def be rated 10+ super easy to make and omgosh is it delish. I used Meringue II recipe to top it off. They very mucH compliment easy other and I didn't change a thing. GREAT job Saundra, many thanks to you! Only thing is I don't know how the original recipe came out light greenish and mine is light yellow. Still taste off the charts though

My husband and I loved it.  I am not a big fan for graham cracker crust, but with the addition of the almonds I was amazed! I will try that version next time I make cheesecake or any other recipe with a graham crust.  We liked the pie so much I am planning on repeating it next weekend for friends coming over to watch football.  The only change I made was to add more zest as recommended in another review.  Added about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons.

This is a great recipe but I made a few changes because I love the taste of lime and possibly due to my having to use regular limes instead of key limes.   I used 3/4 cup of lime juice, 3/4 teaspoon of grated lime zest and added 3-4 drops of concentrated lime oil for the filling.  I then sprinkled another 3/4 teaspoon of grated lime zest on top of the filling, before baking, for decoration.

Once baked I prepared whipped cream - added 3/4 drops of the lime oil to the whipping cream and sugar.

I've made this pie at least 10 times now, and it's always a hit.  The toasted almonds in the crust make a big difference, though I have started adding a drop of almond extract as well, and I use a whole large lime to obtain the zest that's baked into the pie.

I made this for our southern thanksgiving and it’s the best key lime pie recipe I’ve Ever tried!! I’ve made variations of this in the past but this is our new favorite! I toasted almond slivers in butter myself before grinding them and adding crust mixture and they added a supurb nutty flavor to the crust that is perfect with the tart key lime flavor. I could not get fresh key limes so used bottled and it was still delicious! I definitely would not sub anything for the heavy cream which balances the tart key lime juice.

Added an extra cup of milk; heaping tablespoon garlic, leftover onion and mushrooms, and saved 1/2 c cheddar to sprinkle on top. Also added 1/2 c Italian breadcrumbs under the cheese topping.

This pie has a rich, creamy custard filling.  One of the creamiest custard pies I’ve ever had.  It is  very sweet with more of a custard flavor and subtle on the lime.  I baked it several minutes longer than suggested and it still took a full 24hrs for it to set up enough to cut.  I’m not a graham cracker crust fan so I used a different type of crust, adding ground almonds to the crust.  It made for a lovely pie.

Made it as written, well, my husband did... And I topped it with whipped cream, homemade, and sliced strawberries tossed with a little bit of sugar. SO good. It was my 27th birthday pie :) Very lovely. Would make (or have husband make!) again!

I followed the recipe except didn't have time to make the almond crust. I used a ready made graham cracker crust and after baking for 10 min. placed approx. 1/4 cup roasted chopped almonds in bottom of crust before adding filling.  I used heavy whipping cream and increased the lime zest to 1 tsp.  I only had time to refrigerate for an hour before serving---and it was perfect.   Everyone  enjoyed the pie. It is a keeper.

I have been wanting to make this pie forever. Yesterday I got a chance to make it for my Memorial day dinner. I loved the idea of putting nuts in the crust. I decided to put my own spin on it by crushing Lorna Doone cookies and macadamia nuts. I also made the recipe 50% bigger, because I had an extra large pie pan. I baked the pie for 25 minutes instead of 15 to make up for the size difference. This pie was exceptional! I will be making it again.

Perfection. My first time ever making key lime pie for my husband who is from Florida ( I’m from CA) The crust was unbelievable, loved the texture. The pie was literally the best I’ve ever eaten, even in Key West. Even though it said to refrigerate overnight, we couldn’t wait, and after 5 hours we cut it up and it was phenomenal! We both had two servings. Keeping this recipe to make for my mother-in-law!

This was sublime. I’m a key lime pie fan, and this is the best I’ve ever had...several of my guests said the same. Followed the recipe for the filling, but substituted coconut cookie crumbs and omitted the sugar from the crust. Worked perfectly.

This pie was easy to make and as good, if not better than any I’ve eaten in the best restaurants.  My family and guests LOVED it.  I will make it often!

This is my far the best key lime pie I have ever eaten. I lived in Florida and have had the pleasure of eating Key West key lime pie, in my opinion, this is even more delicious.  The nuts added to the crust help make this extra special.  I have experimented with different type nuts in the crust, they all seem to work well.  I would recommend this recipe go in your “go to” list of favorites.

This was my first time making Key Lime pie so I didn't know quite what to expect.  I chose this recipe since it had the most "fresh" ingredients listed, and followed it exactly - easy!   Wow - everyone was so impressed and a number of key lime lovers thought this was the BEST pie ever!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

Loved it.  Found "Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice" at our local grocery store and used that, so no lime zest, but good anyway.  Easy to make.  No more store-bought key lime pie for us.

This is my favorite Key Lime Pie.  I make each year on Feb 4th.  It’s our anniversary and we were married in Key West so we had wedding pie instead of cake.

This key lime pie was the first I’ve ever made but it was easy and the filling turned out perfectly. Tart and slightly sweet. I’ll definitely make it again. My only hitch was I required more butter in the crust as it wasn’t staying together. But with the extra 1/4 cup butter it was perfect and the crust was amazing and worth toasting the almonds for for sure.

This was great and easy to make. I made a couple of substitutions for my own palette - I generally find recipes from the US and Canada too sweet, so I took out the sugar in the base entirely, and replaced it with a little over 1/2 cup of coconut shavings instead. I used creme fraiche instead of "heavy" cream (which I took to read double cream). The cake set well and tasted delicious.

Didn't care for it. I made it exactly as the recipe directed. It was overly lime and sweet. The crust was overdone and it tasted almost burnt. It didn't have the creamy consistency I have tasted with other recipes.

I made a little variation and everybody loved it.   I added a meringue on top.
To Make Meringue: In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat the remaining egg whites until foamy (that you can turn the bowl upside down and it doesn't fall). Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. add few drops of ppepermint extract and keep beating.   Spread meringue over pie covering completely.
hope you like it!!!!

This is the first time I have made key lime pie, and I have to say, it was one of the best I have had.  I made 2 for a family BBQ, and everyone started remembering the first time they ever tried a key lime pie in Florida.  Like other people have said, don't change and thing.  Easy recipe to follow, and comes out amazing...I will definitely make this again.

Hello Everyone and thank you so much for your sweet comments and likes.   I am having a problem correct one mistake in the recipe , trying since some time for some reason I cannot do that.  For the lime zest it should be 1 tablespoon and not tsp. sorry about the typo. The zest with the rest of ingredients complete the flavour.

Other reviewers all loved this crust, but I had a lot of trouble with it. The toasted almonds were a delicious addition, but the crust was so crumbly it feel apart, and I had to rebake it. Then, the custard was absorbed into the crust, and some of the crust floated upwards, and baked on top. The final result did taste good, but there was too much crust for too little filling. If I'd make this again, I'd add more butter to the crust and double the filling.

Best key lime pie I've ever had! No tweaks or substitutions needed, although I will note that I used regular grocery store limes, and one time had to supplement with Rose's sweet lime juice to get a full 1/2 cup and it tasted equally good. Enjoy!

The crust is the BEST! The almonds really add a nice effect and keep the crust from ever getting soggy.  The 2nd time I made this I upped the amount of key lime juice a bit and squeezed in the lime juice from the "regular" lime that I used for zest. Everyone raved. Doubling the recipe fills a  9x13 pan nicely.

This has to be the best Key Lime Pie I have ever made. Everybody I have made it for says it is the best. I have made no changes in the recipe.

I prepared two of these for a board meeting last night. Hands Down... absolutely everyone said it was the Best Key Lime they've ever eaten. The only thing I did different was to brush the crust with whipped egg whites before baking. Phenomenal recipe for sure! Thank You.

This pie is so easy to make and wonderfully delicious. I'd never made a key lime pie before, but now I've got a go-to recipe that everyone loves. The crust is magical. So much better than the typical plain graham cracker crust. I'll use the crust recipe in other recipes as well!

Followed the recipe exactly, it was delicious! I don't even want to try another recipe for key lime pie or think of changing anything. The crust on its own is just wonderful and can be used for any kind of pie.

I've made this Key Lime pie twice and it came out awesome both times.  It reminds me of Key West, Florida when I ate Key Lime pie there.  I'll only make this pie when I want Key Lime. I added extra Lime zest than the recipe called for it's perfect.

Love, love, love this recipe! I have already made this pie twice and will continue to forever. The only thing I didn't do is use almonds in the crust and that's only because I didn't have any, both times. I might use them the next time. Oh, and the second time I made this I just used limes instead of key limes. Still tastes great!

My 1st attempt at key lime pie was with this recipe and it is hands down a winner. Better than our local restaurants. The only thing I did a little different after making it "as written" the 2nd time making this recipe I added more lime juice (to MY taste) and instead of using the cream in the pie I used it for whipped cream topping  and used cream cheese in the pie as a substitute. It was great both ways.  (as written and with my tweaks) 
The added almonds in the crust are great. I used the coconut dusted ones and ground them up in our food processor. Excellent recipe.

I loved this pie and it was simple to make.  Silky, just between rich and light, not too sweet, not too sour!

I was in Florida recently and brought home a bag of key limes (I am allergic to bottled juice) and it was exactly the right amount for the recipe (1/2 cup).

I would certainly recommend the recipe as written, though I ended up changing 2 things, one on purpose and one on accident, but I loved my results anyway (some people get mad when you review with your changes but whatever).
 
I used Light Cream instead of Heavy (this cream is not always available in all of the US, but it is in between half and half and heavy cream in terms of richness).  The reason is Heavy Cream almost always has carrageenan and I'm allergic to it.

The other change was accidental.  After the 15 minutes of baking, my baby woke up from his nap and I simply turned the oven off and let it sit for an extra 10 minutes.  I also thought that since my cream was lighter it might be good to remove a little more moisture and make for a firmer pie.

The only thing I would change is I would add a little more sugar or perhaps brown sugar to the crust.  The almonds were great, but I felt it needed just a little more something.

In any case, I loved this silky pie!

This got rave reviews at the office. I squeezed fresh key limes, and added about 4 oz. of cream cheese (I do the same with pumpkin pie). From allrecipes.com, I substituted two recipes: Meringue II and Graham Cracker Crust III (added toasted coconut).

This pie was so creamy.  I think the magic is in the amount of time you beat the ingredients.  I used a Kitchen Aid mixer and this pie turned out to be the best key lime pie I've ever made!

This has just the right blend of tartness and sweetness. And the crust is worth the few minutes it takes to make (although I used only half of the sugar it requested). Fresh key limes are the best to use in this recipe.

Fantastic, everybody loved it. Keep in mind that this is a sweeter key lime pie, so if you're looking for something more tart try a different recipe. Will definitely make again.

I tried to make it since I am a new to cooking when I put it back in the oven after pouring custard over the crust it started boiling and little of it came out also then I tried next in a big dish but the top is not smooth and it is not spongy like shown in the picture. Kindly anyone guide me a baking tip. Thanks. Sunny India.

Loved this recipe. This pie took very little effort but the end result reminded me of my favorite restaurant key lime pie. 
Now I can just make it at home! I followed another's suggestion with respect to substituting milk for heavy cream and also found outcome was still delicious. 
I used lemons instead. Found the tartness of the lemon juice and zest nicely balanced the sweetness of the condensed milk. The texture was absolutely divine.

Fantastic Key Lime Pie- I used nilla wafers instead of graham crackers for the crust. Had to make two because it was gone in a matter of hours! Thanks for the diabetes ;)
