I liked this recipe because there are  very few ingredients. I  am trying  to find  a family friendly recipe. I will use the bag when my grandkids are here... great idea! I added 1/3 cup honey , coconut oil and  used 1/2 organic whole wheat flour along with the regular white flour.  However, the bread did not cook in 30 minuets.. ( maybe my oven?) I added on some time to see if it could become less doughy. I would highly recommend this recipe and as I bake it more I hope to rerate it!
Otherwise next to perfect!

Really nice.. I added rosemary and garlic - baked on a cookie sheet instead. Nice flavor. Easy to make. I didn't roll it into a rectangle. Just formed and let rise

Very good flavor and texture.  I subbed honey (1:1, 3/4 TBSP less water), left out the powdered milk, used flax and grapeseed oils, added 1/4 Bran flour (less that amount on the last cup of flour).  Delish!  Will share this recipe and will make again!

Nice bread.  I just mixed it up in the bread machine and baked in a pan in the oven for 40 minutes at 350.  Turned out really well and was soft, so hubs gobbled it up just as well as he does other breads.  Thansk for the recipe!
