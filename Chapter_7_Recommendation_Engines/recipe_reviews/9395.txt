My 4th grader had to do a presentation about Christmas in Germany, so I made this punch and took it in for her to share with her class.  Even though we had to serve it cold, it was a big hit!  Several of the other children asked for the recipe.  They especially liked the lemon pieces floating on top because it reminded them of lemonade.

Would have given 4 stars as this is a very basic version of mulled cider, but this gets 5 stars instead due to having ingredients found in my kitchen as opposed to more specialized or complicated mulling mixes.  Very easy to assemble and great taste.

This is way too sweet for us, but the flavor is good, especially with the lemon slices.  I'm not sure I'll try this again.  But if I do, I would use less or no additional sugar.

We made this during our Christmas Around the World, Germany unit and my kids loved it!  It's so easy and adding the lemon and cinnamon made it seem exotic to my kids!

This was such a great treat today on a cold, rainy, dreary day. I used sucralose, cut the servings to two. I didn't have stick cinnamon so I just sprinkled cloves & cinnamon on top. I wasn't sure about adding the water but I did & it was great! Thanks!

I made this today for my office and used 1/2 apple juice, 1/2 white grape.  Very, very syrupy sweet.  I'm making it tomorrow with less sugar and I'm sure it will be much better.  It was REALLY sweet and I can't stress this enough, but it was still a hit so great recipe (kinda)! :)

I made this for a class party featuring German New Year - it was a hit!  I tripled the recipe (plus a little more water/juice to fill the crockpot) except for a triple recipe, I used 1 C of sugar and I also used whole cloves in a spice ball instead of ground.   I dissolved the sugar on the stove and then put all the ingredients in a crock pot for 1 hour on high.

It was amazing, although I had to use cinnamon ground and had trouble getting it out but I eventually did, and I didn't have lemons so I used oranges, I absolutely love this and I've shared the recipe around family and friends. It is pretty easy to make considering I am only 12 and just graduated. Thanks so much for the recipe! Xx
