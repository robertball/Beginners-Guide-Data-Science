The FLAVOR is RICH and FABULOUS, little to no gaminess... BUT the goose TEXTURE is like shoe leather... TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE 1/8 inch slices of quickly cooked Canada goose. 

IMHO, unless the goose can be sliced VAPOR thin, no fast cook method will work, it's got to be slow/pressure cooked prepped. 

OK DAY 2....
First: Salt&Pepper seasoned and PRESSURE COOKED thin sliced(perpendicular to the grain/muscle), goose in 2 cups of water for 30 min, medium rocking.  Removed from heat, allowed to cool on it's own, then used the original recipe...

Others in my family would never dream of eating "gross" game food... I never offered to share!... it's way too good to share, tender, not pulverized.

You can tell it's game, not farmed... but it's only a sense, a feeling, not overwhelming.

PrePressureCooked... it's a 5+, in a different league altogether.

This was actually quite tasty and easy.  It's basically like stir fry beef.  I didn't change in the recipe other than adding some bell peppers I needed to use and it came out great.  It works well with geese you get earlier in the day as the chili sauce kind of neutralizes the gamey taste.  The only thing I would suggest is to slice the goose as thinly as possible.  But that's just my preference.

Was delicious, easy, and quick. After Mike went hunting we had an abundance of Canadian goose to deal with. This is now one of two winning recipes we will use to cook goose with.

Made it as written - as other commenters mentioned, flavour was great, but SO TOUGH! I will for sure keep the sauce recipe, but definitely need to change the cooking method. 

*Update* I did try and do a whole goose with the same sauce in the slow cooker (6 hours on low until done) as well as in the instant pot - 35 mins of high pressure and natural pressure release. Both of these resulted in equally tough goose. Not sure what can be done with goose to make it tender and chewable.

Back in the day, it was popular in some European countries to serve Christmas goose.  I have roasted goose on a number of occasions, but from organically farmed sources.  This recipe is very similar to what my grandmother used to make and is simply delicious.  Nice to see a game recipe for a change.  For those that do not hunt, order from a reputable butcher or go on line.

The peppers tenderize the goose pieces. Spicey, but not too hot. Big hit.

This was awesome. I did add some crushed red peppers. Just enough to give it a little heat kick. My husband sliced the goose very thin so it was not tough at all. Served it over brown rice. Yum!

Very good and very simple recipe. I'm not a huge gamey taste fan but love to hunt so I'm always looking for good recipes. The sweet chili sauce really compliments the gamey taste of the goose. I divided the goose to bite size and didnt have any issues with toughness. It was very fresh goose though.

Thank you Bill Marker...I followed your advise and cooked the goose in my pressure cooker first, then I followed the recipe. I used sweet and sour sauce because I didn't have sweet Thai chili sauce. It came out delicious! My husband loved it! This recipe is a keeper.
