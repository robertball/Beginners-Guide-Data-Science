I love this dip! I made a few changes: I used 2 cans of chicken (12.5 oz each), 2 stalks of celery finely chopped, I didn't use blue cheese or ranch dressing instead I used 1 16oz container of sour cream and a packet of ranch dip seasoning and made the ranch dip. I added it all to the mix. The ranch dip has a better taste than the dressing to me. All in all the dip was a hit at girls night....they are already asking me to make it for our next get together :)

Insane.  INSANE!  I made to recipe, except I layered it instead of mixing it all together; it just looks better that way, in my opinion.  I used Hidden Valley Ranch and Paul Newman Chunky Blue Cheese dressings, and Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce.  Awesome.

Great recipe, though I made a few changes that made it simpliar to make: 3 boneless chix breasts (or 3 cans, tho the real thing tastes better), boiled and shredded, mix with 1/2 - 1 cup of hot sauce. Then add 2 packages of softened cream cheese (do NOT use the fat free, it doesn't mix well, you may use the 1/3 less fat) add 1 cup of GOOD blue cheese dressing; add 1- 3 celery stalks coarsely chopped. Mix well, taste and make sure it is spicy enough for you. Add cheddar cheese on top, bake 350 for 20-30 min. Serve with tortilla chips

I have made this before and my Husband loves it, I shred a Rotisserie Chicken in a baking dish, pour half a bottle of wing sauce over that, mix 8oz Ranch dressing with 4oz softened cream cheese pour that on top as third layer and then 8oz of mozzarella cheese for top layer. Bake in 350f oven until hot and bubbly.

i made this by boiling a large whole chicken, using the breasts for this and the rest for chicken and dumplings. i used a wing sauce i already had in the fridge and store brand ranch and blue cheese dressings. my family loved it. it could even be better with higher quality dressings i'm sure. i used regular cream cheese. it's great with  fritos scoops!

Made it for New Years and everyone loved it!  I skipped the celery and made it extra spicy. I also used canned chicken (my first time), I shredded it and I have to say it was easier and tasted much better then when I actually boiled the chicken.

Yum!! I dont like blue cheese and usually use ranch when eating wings...but I used both as the recipe stated and it didnt have too strong of a blue cheese-y flavor so I liked it. Only thing was that I couldnt figure out how long to sautee the celery because it never seemed to get "soft" and I actually couldnt even tell it was in the dip when I tasted it (no one else could either) so I think it could easily be left out and just use celery to dip in..or else have the pieces bigger if you want to actually taste it in the dip.  Also, I used more hot sauce than it called for -- about 3/4 cup and I noticed that it seemed to be really greasy/runny when I took it out of the oven and I think it was just all the extra sauce had settled on the top and I had to sop a lot out with a paper towel..not sure how to avoid that if you want more hot sauce. Everyone commented that it was pretty hot, but they still came back to keep eating more! I think it tastes good with crackers and celery, although the crackers seemed better since the dip was more on the runny side. I will definitely be making this again!

My family LOVED this dip... Next time I will mix the cheese into the dip. Once the dip started getting cold the cheese turned hard and was difficult to eat.

I had this for the 1st time at a football party last year. I kept trying to get the recipe from the girl that brought it but she was too busy doing shots to cooperate! I'm so glad I found the recipe. I made it this last Sunday for the Texans game and it was gone before the 1st Qtr was over! I added a little more hot sauce for my family's taste and served with tortilla chips.

This was absolutely amazing! I used canned chicken and 16oz sour cream and a ranch pkg. I also added a litter extra celery and didn't cook it that much so it had a little crunch. It was gone in 10 minutes. I should have made two. I will be making this again for sure. Everyone loved it!!

Really good - I will make it again with the following modifcations - I doubled the receipe and used 4 chicken breasts but it wasn't enough it came out a little runny.  next time I'm going to use 6 boneless chicken breasts and 4 stalks of celery - I used two and people didn't know it was there.  I used almost a cup of franks hot sauce and that was just about right.  I'll also keep the same amount of dressing but decrease the ranch and up the blue cheese.  Everone loved it though adn it was even better after it cooled and sat for a bit.  It was all gone!

I followed as described but turned out dripping with buttery fatty liquid.  Probably because of all the cheese.

I have people request this at every party I do.  No joke, this recipe has traveled from state to state.  Some definite do's from the other reviews: -  Do use half blue cheese, half ranch for the amount of ranch.  -  Do layer it in the baking dish: the ranch/ blue cheese/ cream cheese on bottom; then the chicken (mixed already with the hot sauce); and then the cheese sprinkled on top.  Kudos to this recipe-maker!!

This is a great dip, the only changes I made was to add 1 cup of hot sauce instead of 1/3 cup,and a extra chicken breast, it is like having buffalo wings without the mess. All the guys I work with loved it! Thanks for the great recipe. Also if you really want great flavor and heat use Louisiana hot sauce, it truely is the perfect hot sauce!

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it!  Easy to make and completely addictive.  I used wing sauce instead of hot sauce (because that's what I had on hand) and used a bit more than was called for in the recipe.  This is my new go-to for potlucks and sporting events!

I made a healthy version of this recipe and it turned out great. I couldn't stop eating it! =) I made the following changes: used 1 package of MorningStar Farms Chick'n Strips in place of the breast halves. I used no celery, and used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free cheddar cheese. I also used reduced fat ranch dressing (but regular blue cheese). All the same measurements that it called for. Would recommend serving with baked tostitos!

This recipe is great. My husband loves it and will eat it as often as I make it! It is a great dip to serve guests or to bring to parties. I use 1 1/2 cups blue cheese dressing and leave out the ranch dressing and the celery and it's still delicious.

I made this recipe for NYE and it was a hit! I used the exact measurement of ranch and blue cheese dressing and 1-8oz countainer of regular cream cheese. I used 1/2 cup of Franks Buffalo Wingsauce (because less than that is not enough to compete with the amount of dressing imo). And I used a 48oz package of boneless skinless chicken breast. It could have actually used a little more meat than that just to soak up some more of the dressing-cream cheese mixture, I think. I mixed the cream cheese and dressing together and the chicken and wingsauce together and then mixed them all together. Then, I put them in my 8x8 dish with the cup of shredded cheese on top. I put it in the oven for 25 minutes and then I just turned the broiler on high for less than five minutes and that really got the cheese on top a golden color. I think the broiler helped a lot with that layer of grease that I have seen other people mention, because when I took it out of the oven, I had only a very thin layer of grease to blot up. The people at the party (there were only 7 of us) destroyed that dip with Fritos scoops. My husband kept saying he wanted to wrap it up in tortillas. Also, I think it is important to use the full flavor dressings and cream cheese so that it is not too runny. I think that may be the problem some people here had who are saying their's came out too runny (and maybe they did not use enough chicken). Will make this again!

Perfect just the way it it! To keep that oily hot sauce from rising  to the top, simply mix the hot sauce with the shredded chicken and let it soak it all up. Tossing a few times to make sure it's spread out evenly. While everything else is sautéing and melting the sauce stays in the chicken instead of leeching back out into the cheese mixture. It's Delicious.

I made this dip for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a big hit!! I doubled the recipe and cooked the chicken breast in my electric pressure cooker with some Franks Hot Sauce, Garlic, Onions, and water. The breast were falling apart when I pulled them out and then took a fork to finish them up.  Everyone LOVE IT!! I will make this again!

Followed others advice and used rotisserie chicken chopped, 1/2 pkg cream cheese, 2 T sour cream, 1/2 pkg ranch, some diced onions since that's what I had in the pantry. I also didn't realize we were out of Franks so I used some texas pete and melted butter into it. 

Mixed cream cheese, sour cream and ranch mix together, added hot sauce to the chicken, then cream cheese mixture and onions, mixed everything together and then put into casserole dish lined in aluminum foil, topped w/shredded cheddar and cooked until bubbily. Served with Tostitos Scoops they were awesome!

I followed this recipe almost exactly - the only thing I didn't do was include the celery. What I got was a soupy mixture with greasy oil covering the top. I used three paper towels to soak it up, and there was still so much oil left over. The flavors also seemed odd to me - something didn't quite click or blend together. I will give this recipe one more try, but I don't have very high hopes.

Great recipe, was awesome with Fritos Scoops to use for dipping.  I increased the hot sauce, it gave it a great kick.  One thing about this recipe- once you bake it, the dip does come out with a greasy coating on the top.  Unappealing and unhealthy.  I blotted the grease off the top and then it was excellent.

Gotta give it 5 stars.  Nice spice, texture, flavor. Everyone loved it at our Daytona 500 party.  I printed out take home recipes for requests.  As for me, it's still 2nd to creamy garilic artichoke dip.  I will make it again just as written for parties.

Good; it actually makes a lot so we put the leftovers in the fridge and ate it cold the next day like chicken salad.  We actually liked it better the second day cold.

YUMMY!!!!!!! This is so good! I didn't have any Celery on hand, so I didn't put it in, but my lord this was! I also added a heaping scoop of sour cream to the mixture, well I think 2, and mixed it all together..I also added a few extra shots of hot sauce, and used Colby Jack, and Pepper Jack cheeses on top! To die for!

this dip is not to my liking. i should have known better based on the ingredients, but it was seriously such a mess. too much salad dressing, too much grease. Everyone moved on to rave about the Seven Layer Taco Dip. :) Go giants!

Yummy! Instead of boiling chicken breast. I used tyson grilled ready frozen fully cooked chicken breast strips. You can cook it on the stove, but I just microwaved the chicken for a few minutes. I didn't use any celery and I did not use blue cheese (don't like it) I used more ranch and added extra shredded cheese. It was a little runny prob because of the extra cheese, so the next time I make this I will use less cheese.

Love it but....use twice as much ranch and half the blue cheese. (It makes it bitter)  Don't add celery, it's not needed.

This was the first time I made a dish for my boyfriend and family, so I was really nervous about the outcome.  Everyone loved it!  I brought carrot sticks, celery, and chips to dip, but everyone was just eating it by the spoonful!  I used 2 boneless chicken breast, because that was all I had.  And I doubled the blue cheese and skipped the ranch because I don't like ranch.  I did double the amount of RedHot which I guess was ok, I found it too spicy but my boyfriend said it wasn't spicy enough.  The entire family said it was the best buffalo chicken dip they ever had!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but way too over powered by the blue cheese. I'll be making it october 16 for my husbands birthdya party - but will gradually add the blue cheese to taste. Otherwise I loved it.

I usually tweek my recipess but not this time. Made this for our neighborhood progressive dinner and it was a huge hit. The women loved it but the men especially liked it.  I will definitely make it again. Used Marie's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing and bottled Hidden Valley Ranch.  Frank's Redhot and rotisserie chicken.  Sharp Cheddar on top. Served with tortilla chips and bread. Couldn't even  taste the celery.  I might do 2 stalks next time.

I put a twist to this recipe & my family LOVED it.  I omitted the celery and used Buffalo Blue Cheese Salad Dressing instead.  I used 1/2 the hot sauce (to make it kid friendly) this made it thicker, I then let it sit in the fridge for an hour to "stiffen" put it in Egg Roll Wrappers and deep fried.  They LOVED it!!! Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls

This was delicious!!!!I used a rotisserie chicken to save time  and omitted the celery because I didn't have any on hand.My daughter and I started eating it before I even baked it. My husband came home for lunch and saw it on the stove and grabbed the bag of corn chip scoops and started eating it right out of the baking dish.He stayed at the stove eating away saying "This is so good". I went into the shower and called out to him and there was no answer,so I called for my daughter asking where he was ,and she started laughing saying "Mamma, daddy is STILL standing at the stove eating the dip"!! I tried to lie and tell him I cooked it to take to work so I could get more,but that didn't work. My husband said "O well, guess you have to make them some more! A DEFFINITE KEEPER!

This recipe is awesome! The celery really makes the difference here. I used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of hot sauce and it was spicy, but not overly hot. Even the kids loved it!

Hands down thee best appy EVER! I used white cheddar cheese so it had more of the sharp zing you would expect in a buffalo wing and I also added cayenne pepper powder because I didn't find it quite spicy enough. This is always a hit at every function I've ever made it for. I have a hard time actually getting it to the event, because I want to eat it all by spoonfuls! AMAZING!

This was a really tastey dip, but I'm not a fan of blue cheese dressing so I used a cup of sour cream and it wasn't as rich and made a big difference.

This recipe is fantastic!  I use less ranch and more chunky blue cheese which makes it even more delicious!!!

I've been making this recipe for a while now, and I've not seen a better one anywhere. I leave the celery out as I don't like it, but this dish never lasts when I make it. It's absolutely addictive and delicious.

Unfortunately,  I have a really different view of this recipe... I didn't like it at all! The taste didn't seem to blend together well. My husband loves blue cheese dressing and he didn't like it either.

I have made this many times & it has become one of our fave dishes! I don't like it as well with the Blue Cheese dressing so I use all ranch, and often I will use ranch DIP instead of dressing, bc I like it less runny. 
And I love how fast & easy it is! I made this for a football party, decided I wanted one w/o the blue cheese, made another batch & got it done before the guests arrived. People tried to bribe me for the leftovers. LOVE this!

Was a huge hit with my teenage daughter and her friends. Switched out the blue cheese and ranch dressing for caesar (Rene's), also used mozzarella and cheddar as well.  Served it with taco chips. Great party fare - wondering if it would work with crab?

I grew up near Buffalo, so I know my Buffalo-style anythings.  This was actually really, really good!  I'm not sure I'd call it a "traditional" Buffalo flavor because of the added ranch and blue cheese in the dip itself, but it did add a nice touch.  I loved the Franks Red Hot Sauce, but I doubled it to a whole cup and cut back the blue cheese to 1/4 cup.  It was still REALLY good.  :)

Took this to a Christmas party and everyone raved about it. We had seen that people said it was not spicy enough so we added one small home grown hot pepper diced and cooked in with the celery. This made it perfect! Will absolutely make again

I love the idea of this dip, but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture.  The flavour was good, but it needs to be creamier.....maybe some sour cream might help it out.  I probably won't make it again though.  Try it - you might like it better than I did!

This could have been much better but in fairness I modified my dish according to some advice I read in the comments.  I used 2 cans of chicken (12.5 oz each) and the ranch dip powdered packet with sour cream.  It was way too salty for my taste.  Next time, I'll use less cream cheese, more chicken and more hot sauce.  I'd probably skip the ranch dip and go for the dressing in moderation.  I'll be trying this again, either way!

4.5/5 -  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  This is good.  I can't fully give it the 5 stars, because it looks unappealing. Truly.  But, put the looks aside and this is the bomb.

OMG!  This dip is just amazing!  The only change I made was to use a 12.5 oz can of chunk white meat chicken in broth......  I actually had to print a copy for my mother, who wouldn't eat canned chicken if her life depended on it (and neither would I before this recipe!).    SO TASTY!!

followed recipe exactly as written except i used rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts to speed up cooking time.... pretty good but kind of greasy.  had to blot top with towels before serving to remove excess.  overall flavor was good and would probably add more chicken next time.

This wasn't that great.  I think it would have been better if I just left out the ranch dressing and celery.  My husband picked out the cooked bits of celery and it definitely needed more hot sauce...

This was a hit! I actually bought yogurt dressing my accident and it came delicious and probably healthier! Be liberal with the hot sauce. I used 3/4 cup  franks but a cup would have been fine! I also added a few shakes of Louisiana hot sauce. 

Like other reviewers I also used boneless chicken breasts. I poached in herbs and shredded about 4 breasts. Yum!

I liked it and more importantly....It was a hit w my coworkers.... I doubled the recipe and used boneless chicken breast... instead of 2 cups of cheddar I used 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of pepper jack... and used a little more than 2/3 Cup of hot sauce.. just by taste... and I did not top w shredded cheese before baking... I mixed in the shredded cheeses... delish!

This is a Yummy dip and I will make it again. I made the following changes ~ I used just the breasts of a rotisserie chicken and I omitted the Blue Cheese.  I did not increase the ranch though.  Next time I will add a few extra TBS of Franks hot sauce.  Perfect for a Super Bowl party!

The second time I made this I used a whole rotisserie chicken, shredded, and stirred in about 6 ounces of crumbled blue cheese. Sent this great recipe through the roof (and I recommend at least a half cup of Franks).

This was hella delicious! I used Mexican cheese mix instead of cheddar since I'm not a huge fan of cheddar, and I think it tasted so much better! Used this at my Christmas Party and it was a hit!

OMG, SOOO Good! I used real chicken, did 1 cup bleu cheese and 1/2 cup ranch and upped the Franks to about 3/4 of a cup. Sinful, especially since I used the full fat cream cheese!

Every time I make cheesy buffalo chicken dip and take it to family functions I always leave with an empty crockpot!  I always put 50% more cheese in than it calls for because we all love cheese! I pour it all into a crock pot, add half the cheese, mix it in then top with the rest of the cheese. Then I throw the crock into the oven to bake! Come out awesomeness! Then it's easy to keep warm at the function! Happy cooking!

I use 4 bone in chicken breasts. I boil them until tender and falling off the bone. I shred and cut the meat off the bone. I like a lot of celery. I use a full bunch of celery. I cut each stalk in half lengthwise, then chop the stalks up. Sauté the celery in olive oil, while the chicken is cooking, until wilted and tender. Follow the rest of the recipe as is. This always gets tons of compliments! Yum!

Very good! A food processor comes in handy for shredding big cooked pieces of real chicken and the celery. I also added some buffalo wing sauce, and reduced the hot sauce, for a milder version.

I used 2 cans of chicken (12.5 ounces each) instead. Also I didn't use as much ranch because I prefer the bleu cheese flavor and i added a little more hot sauce for more heat.  I didn't cook anything first, just added all the ingredients in a bowl, stirred and put in an oven safe dish.  30 minutes at 350 and it was great.

Excellent! We did a few things differently: 5 bone-in chicken breasts were put in the crock pot and we doubled the recipe except for using the same amount of ranch and blue cheese dressing as the recipe calls for (we didn't want it to be too soupy from making it in the crockpot). We used Moore's Buffalo wing sauce and Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce. (We did double the total amount of wing sauce but only maybe 1/4 of that was the Frank's sauce because we didn't want it to be too hot). We also put a 6oz can of diced green chiles in and then chopped up some celery and put it on top with some additional Frank's drizzle.  Oh, we also added some blue cheese crumbles in, maybe a 1/4  cup. Delicious- everyone raved about it and it wasn't greasy when we reheated the little bit we had left the next day.

This recipe is AWESOME! I had out with it salsa and a cheese dip, they were barely touched with a party of 22. They devoured this dip. I put it in a 9" pie pan and over half was gone. It's great for dipping with tortilla chips, AND celery sticks. The blue cheese dressing is the difference here! YUM. Next time I'll omit the cheese, because it really isn't necessary. The only thing I did different was I heated up the chicken with the hot sauce first, then added my cream cheese and once that was melted I added the dressings. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, which was fine, but I noticed that people were digging under the cheese to get just the good stuff!

This dip was delicious! I followed the recipe as described. My kids went back for seconds and thirds. My 11-year-old son: "this dip is insane!"He ate so much I thought he was going to make himself sick. My only issue was that it was a little thicker than I expected. I may have used too much chicken breast. Next time, I'll just add a little more of the other ingredients and hopefully that'll loosen it up. Even with the stiffness, this dip was awesome. Thanks!

This recipe was great. The only change I made was I used one celery stalk. This recipe was great although I would not recommend using bagged shredded cheese because the one that I bought didn't melt it just crusted up on top. Other then that the dish was great and I would recommend it to a friend.

A friend made this for this year's Super Bowl party. It was delicious!  I''m not a fan of blue cheese but it was still pretty good!  I'm going to try it with ranch like someone else suggested.

This is one of our favorites! I also made a few changes. I used one 12.5oz can of chicken (but next time will probably use two cans) one doesn't seem quite enough. Even one & a half would be good. 3/4 cup of RedHot sauce, if you don't like spicy food I would make it 1/2 cup. Two 8oz blocks of cream cheese, softened. 1 cup ranch dressing. And about 1&1/4 cups sharp cheddar cheese, because we love cheese! This is actually really quick and easy. I bake dish for 15 mins, take out and add the cheese evenly, and put back in the oven for 10 or 15 minutes. Prep time 5-7 mins, bake 25-30 mins, & enjoy!!!

I love this recipe.  I boiled my chicken in water, a tsp or so of chicken boullion, 1 tsp or so of cayenne, salt and pepper and a good couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  It's a bit greasy but I just mop that up before serving with thick paper towels and it's all good.  I also added about 1/4 cup more Franks because we like things hot.

Great start. I'm going to try using real blue cheese next time. Using two salad dressings makes it more about the dressings.

Never thought of mixing it all in the skillet before putting it in the oven...great idea!  I added twice as much hot sauce (cause I like it spicy and a little Cyan pepper)  Thanx...great recipe!

My reputation for making this precedes me and I'm no longer allowed to go to parties without a double batch of the stuff in hand! I use canned chicken (20 oz for a single) and wok oil instead of olive oil (gives it a garlicky flavor) and it is amazing. I've never had a person yet say they haven't loved it!

I love this dip! It's like getting to eat buffalo wings without all the mess & nasty bones!  I've made it so many times now I've tweaked the recipe a bit to make it spicier and a teeny tiny bit less fattening... I use 1/2 cup each of ranch, blue cheese dressing, cheese, Frank's red hot buffalo wing sauce, 1/2 block of cream cheese, and 3 cans of chicken.  Super fast, easy, and yummy - thanks so much for the recipe!

I rarely submit reviews, but I have made this many times and it always gets raves and requests for the recipe.  I serve it with Scoops & it's one if the first dishes at the potluck/party/football game to be gone!  I do use a bit less hot sauce when kids are part of the party.

I have made this twice now. The first time, as written (minus celery we don't like it). The second time I used 1 c ranch and 1/2 c blue cheese (my kids were not fond of the blue cheese taste). It was WONDERFUL both ways in my opinion. Kids preferred less blue cheese. A definite keeper imho!!

Great stuff, we take a loaf of italian bread, slice it real thin, brush with olive oil, grill and spread the dip on, best sandwich ever!  I like to use the ranch dip instead of the bottled. it has more flavor.

Great tasting dip for anyone who loves the buffalo wing flavor.  Just the right level of spiciness and great cheese flavor.  This is now a staple at any event at our house requiring chip/dip!

This recipe is amazing!  The first time I made it I accidentally used tobasco sauce and that was a big mistake!  The second time I used Frank's Red Hot and it was perfect.  I also used some Tyson's Buffalo Chicken tenders microwaved and cut up small instead of using chicken breasts and that saved time and was delicious.  The only other thing I did differently was I added some chopped onion when I was heating the chopped celery.  I also cut up some celery and carrot sticks for dipping in addition to tortilla chips and that was a hit.

This is the best dip EVER!  I would have eaten until I was sick if I didn't have any sense.  Even my wife said this was the best dip she'd ever had.  The only changes I made was to use 4 chicken thighs instead of 2 breasts, doubled the hot sauce and layered the dip instead of mixing it all together.

Amazing! Great for football parties, everyone loved it! I did make a few changes - I used all lite/reduced fat ingredients, 2 stalks of celery, 1/2 cup of hot sauce (could have used more!) and used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar. It was a huge hit and I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this- as did other party goers!!  Used 3 boneless skinless- did not use ranch- only used blue cheese dressing ( bob's blue cheese- homemade from this site) - served with corn chips and celery sticks.

Made this for a house party and everyone thought it was awesome!! I did make some alterations. I rarely use whole chicken breasts so I "boiled" As the instructions say 4 average size boneless chicken breasts, used Marie's LITE blue cheese dressing, lowfat cream cheese, and cabots 50% lite cheddar cheese which saved on fat and calories plus all the other ingredients.. It turned out great with these substitutions. I also used celery to dip with rather then tortilla chips.

I made this recipe almost exactly as called for.  I only substituted chicken breast tenders for the bone-in chicken.  I think next time I make it, I will probably try all bleu cheese, as the mix of the ranch and bleu cheese was a little much for me.  Otherwise, it was good...and it certainly got eaten up at my house.

I only made a few changes to the recipe but I bet it would have been just as good if I hadn't.  Used leftover baked chicken and thigh,1/4 cup of the hot sauce and added a small diced onion and 2 celery sticks instead of one, last but not least did not have any bleu cheese dressing so used all ranch. I would say that the recipe is versatile enough to play around with and still have great results. Thanks for adding another terrific recipe from this site.

I didn't have any blue cheese on hand, I just used the Ranch and cream cheese, I added a small amount of mozarella cheese in the mixture, topped with mexican blend shredded cheese. I was so good. Thanks for this recipe.

My teenage son's LOVED this.  I did increase the Ranch dressing and decrease the blue cheese. Instead of melting cheese in the oven; I used the microwave. It was so filling I made it for dinner as the main dish with a side salad.
