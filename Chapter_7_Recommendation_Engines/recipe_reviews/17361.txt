very nice! tried it twice....with regular granulated sugar....it comes out very grainy. Not a good trexture at all!
When tried with confectioners/icing sugar, it came out very smooth & we loved it!

Very good! It's a keeper.  My children (ages 3 & 4) ate in straight from the mixing bowl.  I'm not sure if white sugar refers to confectioners or granulated sugar.  I've used this recipe 3 times.  The first time I used it in a german chocolate layered cake with chocolate frosting for 60 children.  I used the granulated sugar & it recieved many compliments. The next 2 times I used confectioners sugar in a layered chocolate cake with buttercream frosting (for a birthday party & a cake for home).  They were well recieved as well.  What sugar do you (the reviewers) use & what does white sugar refer to?

I used this filling for a farewell cake at work.  It was a big hit!  One co-worker said he didn't like overly sweet stuff, but he came back for a second piece of cake with this filling!

This is the best filling I have ever had and so easy!  Just beat the hell out of it and it will be smooth and light.  I made the traditional chocolate cake from Hershey's website, split the layers and filled the cake with this filling.  I then iced with fudge icing.  What a hit!  And so beautiful!  I will use this filling lots of ways, I am sure.

I this recipe as is is pretty bland.I doubled the recipe to use a whole can of evap milk.  I added about 2 cups  of powder sugur to get a some what of a sweet taste, and then it was ok. I decided to try this recipe because i am doing a wedding cake  soon and i needed a fluffy whipped chocolate moose filling but i didnt want cream in it i was worried about it going sour while the wedding cake set out all day. after i added the additional powder sugar I added about 1/4 cup cocoa powder and it made it awesome!!!! so thats why i gave this 5 stars only if its chocolate.

I didn't want to rate this seeing as a changed it too much but wanted to share my experience. Since so many complained of the shortening taste I chose increase the butter and decrease the shortening to about a 65/35 ratio as opposed to 50/50. I also used regular sugar which I turned into powder in my mini processor because I wanted the sweetness but not the grainyness. Excellent vanilla is important and I used the white kind which gave me pure white filling. I had some open evaporated milk in the fridge which I think was to old so I used vanilla flavored coffee cream because I didn't want to use milk and that's all I had. The end result was quite nice and I used it to pipe into the center of my blond two bite brownies which sank in the center while cooling. So thanks for the starter recipe.
**Update:I made this again and used the evaporated milk called for and I hated it. The flavor from t he evap. milk was overpowering and it made the whole thing very smooth a creamy but not in a good way. I seemed to bring out the greasy shortening taste. I have since lowered my rating from a 4 to a 2 star recipe.  Stick to sweetened cream and maybe that will work like the coffee cream did for me the first time.

excellent recipe....sandwiched this filling between layers of puff pastry and it tasted kind of like a cream horn, but better and not as sweet.

OMG this is the best cake filling ever!!! Hello... I have to admit that I must have read the 1/2 cup sugar about four times before actually trusting it (because I thought it was calling for confectioner's sugar) but I went ahead with the white sugar we use daily and hoped for the best, BUT the key here to remember is To cream your butter for five (5) minutes, then when you add the sugar and shortening and evaporated milk FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES, LADIES AND GENTS THIS HERE IS THE KEY TO THIS MOST PHENOMENAL cake filling.  This is not explained in the short recipe but the key to your success in making this frosting that people will indeed rave about! Hope this helps.

Wow. Takes an ordinary dessert and turns it into five star! I baked a yellow cake from a mix, layered this filling in between, topped with a chocolate glaze, and wow, I impressed even myself. Hard to quit eating this out of the bowl!

I used icing sugar, as the other reviewers said it was grainy with white sugar.  Took a while to get fluffy, but once it did, it was good.  (It WILL look gross for a while, during mixing).  Not a strong flavour-will maybe try more vanilla, or try almond extract next time.  Overall, a good filling...as long as you don't use white sugar.  Next time I will add cocoa powder, to try it as chocolate filling. UPDATE: I tried to make chocolate filling, following the instructions, but adding 1/4 C. Cocoa Powder (Along with the Icing Sugar), and substituting Chocolate Milk for the Evaporated Milk....and what a waste of ingredients!!!!  It would only separate...it wouldn't come together at all!!!  It slid right off the beaters.  Disgusting!!  Will never make again!!!

This icing recipe is marginal at best.  The taste of shortening was overwhelmingly strong in the final product.  I attempted to rectify this by adding more sugar, but it didn't seem to make a dfference.

Yummy! I did have to add some more sugar - it tasted too shortening-y without it.  Used it as a filling with the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream frosting.

Tried this with powdered sugar because I used it on the top of the cake. It was a little runny, but the evaporated milk gives it a yummy richness. Will play around with the powdered sugar and milk amounts to get it just right. Thanks for the recipe!

This was anything but light and fluffy...more like heavy and lipidy.....My testers, and myself, felt it was very heavy and over powered the cake

Great, I was worried about the granulated sugar being grainy but after the filling sat for a day it was smooth.  Delicious.

Ok I realize that I am the only on that is going to put a bad reveiw on here but I did not care for this.  I followed it to a t and there's way to much shortening.  Just as another review said.  We even added sugar- not powdered- ground that up in a food processor to not be gritty and it still was terrible.  My husband and I didn't enjoy this at all.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  It was pretty bland and too "shortening'y" tasting.  I had to add a little bit of salt and a lot more sugar to make it worthwhile.  I won't be making this one again...it did nothing to add to the cakes I made.  I tried it with a chocolate cake and a strawberry cake.

This turned into a pretty fluffy white filling.  I paired it with the Too Much Chocolate Cake and Satiny Chocolate glaze from this website for a friend's birthday cake. She said it tasted like a giant Little Debbie cake!

So I read the reviews & thought I could beat out the graininess of the sugar. Wrong! I also used 3/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup shortening & still the shortening taste was overpowering. We are able to eat the cake, but mostly I'm wishing I hadn't wasted the butter!

I followed directions to a T. I used confectioners sugar instead of granulated. Only because other reviews said it worked better.  Have to say, not a fan of this recipe.  It tastes like Crisco and has a slimy feel.  Won’t be putting this in my recipe box.

I made no changes to the recipe but did beat the butter and shortening for at least 5 minutes each and then continued to beat for another 5 minutes after adding the sugar and milk.  I think it could have been a little sweeter so may try confectioners sugar next time.

This is delicious, exactly what I was looking for.  I used white sugar, which in the context of AllRecipes is granulated sugar, and by following the beating times, all the grainy-ness was beaten out of it.  I was using only half the recipe and as my beaters weren't getting into the butter I added the shortening and the sugar and beat it all together for 10 minutes.  When I added the liquids, it separated, looked quite ugly but I kept the faith and kept beating....for a delicious creamy, fluffy result.  I've posted a picture showing it in its intended way - as filling.  Update:  I had to let the filling sit 24hrs.  It sets  quite a bit. I had to add a couple more tbsp of evap milk to soften it for spreading.

I got this recipe from my grandmother, but we don't use it as a filling; we use it as frosting.  You have to beat this for a long time or else it will be grainy.  If you use unsalted butter, throw in a pinch of salt.

once again, pretty dissapointed. My husband and I both thought it was pretty tasteless. Not a whole lot of flavor. I tried it on chocolate cake, might be better on pastries.
