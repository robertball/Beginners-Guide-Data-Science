A great summertime sandwich!  One of my favorites.  I used pita bread, my husband prefers tortilla wraps.  Pita bread can be a little messy but delicious.  I also use low-fat cream cheese and just a couple slices of avocados.  Two whole avodacos would be way too much (must be a misprint.)
Note to Eggyplant:  a pepperoncini is a mild yellow pepper, also referred to as Banana Peppers.  They are usually sold in jars near the pickle section.  Gives the sandwich a little zing.

Fabulous! I toasted some whole grain bread before assembling the sandwich. I used light cream cheese and added a little salt and pepper.  This would easily make a nice wrap sandwich. I would definitely make this again!

Great sandwich! You definitely only need one
avocado, though.  And since the bread was already spread with cream cheese, I chose not to mash the avocado and spread it on the bread. I just sliced the avocado and added it to the sandwich.

The first time that I made this I rolled it in a tortilla shell & it just didn't do the sandwich justice.  The second time I made it, I marinated the cucumbers in Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing (found on this site) instead of the vinegar & oil & had it on wheat bread.  YUM!  It was messy, but very tasty!  Thanks Jennifer!!

I am just plain crazy for this sandwich, and I can't imagine why I never thought to put these ingredients together myself.  I've made this multiple times now, and have adjusted it to just my liking: Use a handful of fresh baby spinach in place of lettuce, used only 1T of lite cream cheese mashed together with 1/4 to 1/3 of an avacado and a pinch of onion powder and black pepper(this seemed to make plenty of spread to cover both pieces of bread), add sliced pickles when the mood strikes.  I've tried it sprinkled with a variety of vinegars, and although I like them all, balsamic is my absolute favorite.  I also pass on the EVOO, and sometimes I sprinkle a little drief basil and/or oregano over the vinegar.  Absolutely fabulous & oh, so satisfying.

I never thought a sandwich could be a 5-star recipe, but this one is! My husband wasn't too thrilled when he saw what I had prepared for lunch, but even he had to admit that it was delicious. My only changes: I used half the vinegar and oil (they add a lot, but I think 1 tsp. each would be too much), substitued onion for pepperoncini, sliced the avocado instead of mashing it, and left out the sprouts (because I didn't have any - but they're probably a good addition). The sandwiches came out looking beautiful (not a mess like other reviewers commented...) and tasting great!

This is a good, very filling veggie sandwich.  I've made it several times since I discovered this recipe a week ago!  I've tried both slicing the avocado and spreading it, spreading it made for a less messy sandwich that stayed together better.  Did not use pepperoncinis, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Also be sure to use thick, whole wheat bread or else the oil/vinegar combo will make the bread fall apart.  Delicious!

I love this sandwich! I add a little guacamole mix ~extra spicy~ to the avocado. And instead of putting the dressing on the sandwich I spoon a little on as I eat! No soggy sandwich

Gave this sandwich five stars because I didn't want to discourage anyone else from trying it. It was very good. A few thoughts though; I made this in the winter and served with soup. I really think it would have been better for summer fare. Meat and potaoes hubby wasn't impressed. I tried hiding the all veggie aspect of the sandwich by adding a layer of salad shrimp. I didn't work. They were too light and delicately flavored and almost seemed like more vegggies. Hubby isn't wild about avocadoes. I used 1/2 of a big one and it was more than he could tolerate. "Thick" wheat bread is not easy to get unless you use a wheat hoagie roll or bake it yourself. I used a nice homestlye wheat but it was still pretty soggy and messy. Although I don't mind that, I love messy hearty sandwiches but it might be a disaster with small kids though. Serve with a fork to scoop up the leftover "salad" that falls out of the sandwich. I didn't have any sprouts but I'd like to try it again with them. I had the lettuce but after the sandwich was put together with all that stuff I forgot to add it. Don't think I missed it. The cream cheese was the secret ingredient to make this stand out from regular mayonaise based veggie sandwiches. I'll remember that for other occasions.

This sandwich is sooo good! I have lost count how many times I have made it. I use 12 grain bread and for the tomatoes I used roma, but I can only fit 4 slices on the bread. For the cucumber I use the English style, so I did not have to peel it, saving time. I really liked the amount of vegetables on this and that it is sandwich shop qualty. I suggest using whipped cream cheese. It is not only lower in fat/sat fat, but it spreads much easier. The only thing I leave out is the sprouts, because I have never been able to find them. It doesn't seem to need them anyhow. It also tastes good with or without the yellow pepers. I make it both ways. I have found that "white wine" vinegar is much better to, as it is more mild. Thank you submitter!

Super tasty.  Here are some changes you might like: Whole wheat pita oven baked until crisp and split in two, bean sprouts (couldn't get alfalfa), garlic HUMMUS in lieu of cream cheese to make it healthier and still very tasty, shredded carrot, mixed greens, pickled hot peppers instead of pepperoccini.  Mmm-mmm!

I altered the ingredients a bit to suit my taste, removing the tomato and pepperoncini, and adding some cheese and small slivers of onion.  I also used bottled Italian dressing instead of the oil and vinegar.  I've tried this on pumpernickel bread and in a wrap.  It was very good each time!

This sandwich is awesome!  
I don't think it really matters what type of veggies or bread you use.  What really makes this recipe is the vinaigrette and pepperoncini combination mixed with the cream cheese and avocado.  I really love the tangy kick this sandwich has and the pepperoni kicks the heat up a notch.  I always vary the bread (from Flax bread to bagels).  Cucumber is good but so is red pepper.  Leftover roasted eggplant and caramelized onions are amazing!  The combinations are really endless, but stick with the basic vinaigrette and pepperoncini!  This is my favourite veggie sandwich now!

This is a great recipe. My boyfriend and I love it. I didn't use alfalfa sprouts or pepperoncini. It's a nice picnic sandwich!! Make sure you eat it right way otherwise the bread gets soggy from the cucumbers and vinegar. :)

I am a new vegetarian and was looking for a hearty sandwich and found this one.  Delicious and filling.  I made one for a co-worker and left it on her desk because she was in the middle of a project.  Within ten minutes she called me and said she had stopped working after the first taste and paid attention to what she was eating for the first time in a long time. This sandwich will stop you in your tracks.

Very tasty!  I, too, used sliced red onion instead of the pepperoncini.  Omitted the vinegar/oil combo, but I think I'll try that next time.  Sliced avocado instead of mashing it.  Served with a few gourment potato chips from Trader Joe's and a fresh peach.....delicious!

A wonderful sandwich!  I like to use  French Bread slices.  I use avocado, if I have it.  I'm not really a balsamic vinegar lover, but I used it and that is what puts this sandwich over the top of 5 stars, for me!  Thanks Jennifer, that sandwich shop must have been super!

I was looking for an easy veggie sandwich and this totally fills the bill! We loved it and the found it very filling. We did add a slice of provolone cheese and my husband (who skipped the peppers) wants to try swiss next time. Also, we subbed bottled Italian dressing for the oil/vinegar. Bottled ranch also worked well, so I am sure your favorite dressing would do. Everythine else was the same. I do think next time (which will probably be tomorrow) I will use a pita bread instead of the wheat (which we did toast).  You need a hearty bread to stand up to the moist ingredients. This is definately going to be a regular with us.

Wonderful!  Just like a sandwich served at a local bagel shop.  Tastes great on pumpernickel!  Have used roasted peppers when I don't have pepperocini.  Also added shredded carrots.  Reduced tomato to 2 slices to keep it from sliding around so much.

My mom and I tried this for lunch today and really enjoyed it!!! Made a few changes though... I made the sandwiches on wheat buns instead of bread. I used a very small amount of cream cheese- Mom left out the cream cheese and used a slice of Swiss cheese instead, and liked that a lot. I left out the olive oil and vinegar, and used Light Italian dressing instead. I also left out the pepperoncini and avacado, but added red onion for a little kick. Mom got clever and sliced the cucumber lengthwise and used just 2 slices, instead of the 6 or 7 small ones I used. It helped her sandwich be a lot less messy. This tastes great and is so good for you, but it's also very very messy- the other reviewers were right!! I think I'll try a wrap next time...

So many ways you can do this.  I used Pumperknickle bread and it was wonderful. I agree that the cream cheese totally tops off this sandwhich.  I'll probably add black olives tomorrow, I mean next time.

I liked this very much. No changes made except to use whipped cream cheese because its easier to spread as another reviewer noted. The layer of cream cheese keeps the bread from absorbing the olive oil and vinegar and to my surprise was a delicious addition. I don't know why some reviews are saying the bread gets soggy, it shouldn't because the recipe notes to eat immediately. Most enjoyable was after eating I didn't feel stuffed like I do when I eat a meat based sandwich.

This sandwich is true to the submitter's word.  It is a delicious lunchtime sandwich that is brown bag transportable to the office and Weight Watcher friendly.  For those of you on the Weight Watchers program, this sandwich can easily be converted into points.  For only 5 whole points, change the recipe as follows - substitute 2 slices of high fiber, whole grain, whole wheat bread (2 pts), 2 TBSPs of LIGHT cream cheese (1 pt), and 1/4th of an avocado (2 pts or add another 1/4th of an avocado for 2 more pts), then no olive oil or vinegar so the sandwich won't get soggy by the time lunch rolls around.  Wait to add cuke slices, tomato, sprouts and lettuce once you are ready to eat it.  I put the veggies in a separate container when taking the sandwich as a lunch to the office.  I can't say it enough.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Interesting mix of ingredients. Fresh, clean, and tasty. Tip: don't slice the cucumbers too thick or they'll squirt right out when you bite in!

Absolutely delicious! Would love to give it 5 stars but I had to sub red capsicum as we didn't have the pepperoncini. Tasted healthy and fresh with a lot of flavour.

nummy nummy nummy! You can have fun with this - use what you love (tomato, avocado, cokes, spinach, etc) this sandwich is limitless. I paid $9 for a veggie sandwich at a restaurant that was NOT NEAR as good as this one. THANK YOU!

Did I miss something? The recipe calls for only 1/2 of an avocado. Earlier reviewers complained that 2 avocadoes was too much.......HELLO! Anyway, this was a really terrific sandwich made on thick slices of the Country Seed Bread, this site. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple thick slices of red onion. Yummy, but messy! That's half the fun!Thanks for sharing, Jennifer.

This was so good.  My husband, who is not a huge veggie fan, had seconds!

Since I read several reviews that said it was messy, and that wheat bread fell apart, I tripled the recipe, and put it on a ciabatta (Italian "slipper" bread).  The crust stood up really well, we loved it.   I made this sandwich for lunch two more times with leftover ingredients that hadn't fit into the ciabatta.  So yummy!

Delicious!!  I'm just not seeing where people are getting the 79g fat per serving, or that it calls for 2 avacados?  I see 33g fat and 1/2 avacado.  Maybe it was fixed.  But how I figured it out, if you use w/w high fiber bread and fat-free cream cheese, I come up with about a 400 cal sandwich...or about 7 Weight Watcher's points.  You could even omit the oil as you already get fat from the avacado. I definatly will make this sandwich again and again!

This is a great sandwich, however, I prefer it on a toasted bagel using light cream cheese! The hot, toasted bagel is an awesome contrast to the cold produce inside. I also slice the avacado on it instead of mashing it and put cream cheese on both sides of the bagel. Yummy!!

This was a very good recipe.  I had to make modifications to it because it was high in fat and calories, and because I couldn't find any peperoncini (not sure of the spelling).  First, I spread low fat cream cheese on a whole wheat tortilla, drizzled some red wine vinegar, put only half an avocado, omitted the olive oil and for obvious reasons, I omitted the peperoncini.  It's great on a hot summer's day, when you don't have much in the fridge!!!

I love these. As a vegan, the cream cheese gets left out, and I use an almond pesto in its stead. Also very nice lightly toasted under the broiler for a few minutes. Don't pass these up just because are veggie with no meat.

Really good sandwich! I mashed the avocado and then added the sliced pepperoncini to that and some garlic salt and pepper, and mixed it well. Used spinach, and lightly tossed the sprouts with red wine vinegar and sunflower seed oil before putting on the sandwich. I absolutely loved this sandwich!

Great sandwich!  I didn't have sprouts or avocado, so I added some sweet onion and some fresh red bell pepper, otherwise made the recipe as written, on crunchy oat bread.  Perfect!

So fresh and addicting! Very versatile; you can add or subtract ingredients according to your taste. 
I toasted the bread and sprinkled garlic powder and dill on the cream cheese after spreading it on the bread to give it even more flavor.

Terrific!  Didn't have a ripe avocado but had some guacamole so spread some of that on.  Pita bread would be perfect for this recipe!  Really loved the comination of all the vegies/flavors.  Definitely going in my "make often" section.

My family really enjoyed this.  The only reason I am dinging it a star is because the olive oil/red vinegar mixture was a little weird for us.  I think regular vegetable oil and red wine vinegar would have been better.  One daughter said this vinegar combo kept her from tasting the avocado, and to leave it off next time.  I will definitely try this again, it is definitely worth repeating.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This turned out to be very yummy. I even tried banana peppers for the first time, which I found are also pretty good! Instead of adding oil/vinegar and tomatoes, I used a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. I also used spinach instead of lettuce and added a few shakes of black pepper, oregano, and onion powder.  I will definitely be making this again!

My best friend and I love to try different recipes and love to challenge each other with coming up with a unique one.  Well, this one was IT for me!  I guess when a 12 y/o boy begs for half is a good indication!  I will tell you that it is much better with the cucumber in thick slices as opposed to thinly sliced (I tried it both ways).  Thanks for this KEEPER!

This sandwich is great when you're looking for something a little bit out of the ordinary. I used spinach in place of lettuce, and substituted Italian pesto salad dressing for the red wine vinegar and olive oil.

Delicious.  Now I won't have to go out to the sandwich shops anymore.  The whole tomato seemed like a lot so I just added a few slices.  And I substituted spinach for the lettuce.  I also didn't use pepperoncini since I don't like the taste of pepper.  I'll be making this a lot.

I loved this! You definitely need a very thick bread, otherwise the sandwich gets very soggy.  I wish it would keep better, as I made a few extra to take to work for lunch, but they were inedible by day two and three. I used a veggie cream cheese and spinach leaves in addition to the romaine lettuce.

My husband eats a lot of meat and I am working on introducing more vegetables into our diets.  He LOVES this sandwich.  He keeps talking about how amazing it is!! I def recommend!  Add some garlic powder and onion powder to the avocado (I normally get annoyed with all the changes that people suggest but this is an easy one that made a difference!)

I really enjoyed this sandwich, finding sprouts is always a pain in our area, so I have had it with and with out. With sprouts it is soo much better I leave off the lettuce when I do have sprouts. For my meat eater husband I add sliced Turkey and mix some ranch in with the mashed avocado. I didn't have red wine vinegar once and instead soaked my cucumber slices in balsamic ving. it was fantastic!

I omit the olive oil - just mix together whipped cream cheese and red wine vinegar to taste - great sandwich.

Mmmm...crunchy, delicious & satisfying! I LOVE the textures & a thin slice or two of deli turkey wouldn't hurt for those who just hafta have some meat in their sandwich. I also have been known to cheat & just use an Italian salad dressing or vinaigrette in place of the oil/vinegar, a dash of salt is a must & a sprinkle of dill weed adds a nice touch, also!

I really enjoyed this sandwich! My husband, a meat lover, said he felt like he was eating a salad between two pieces of bread, nothing special. I tried bean sprouts since I could not find alfalfa, and I boiled the sprouts for one minute, adding the vinegar and olive oil to only the drained sprouts in an attempt to keep the sandwich from getting too soggy like other reviews had mentioned. The next day I took a sandwich for lunch and added a slice of Swiss cheese--delicious! We ate these sandwiches with a side of zucchini relish, a recipe I found on this site that was also very good.

I wasn't to sure about this sandwich.  The ingredient list seemed to leave much to be desired.  But since I've been trying to eat healthier I decided to give it a try.  The Verdict=DELICIOUS.  Very refreshing even during the winter months and healthy.  Followed the recipe as is...but used some of my local markets guacamole instead of avocado.  Definitely a staple!

Great sandwich. I didn't have cream cheese, sprouts, pepperoni or avacado. I made chipoltle mayo and added a slice of pepper jack cheese. Great sandwich using garden produce.

These were wonderful. We followed the directions the first time and they were five-star sandwiches already (hence the rating). The second time, we tweaked them to suit our individuals tastes (more pepperoncinis for him, less avocado for me, a splash more vinegar for both) and enjoyed them even more. We'll definitely be making these again. Thanks!

This sandwich was very good.  I was looking for a recipe to use up my sprouts and I am so glad I found this one.  I will be making this often!  In order to reduce calories, I used 1 tbsp light cream cheese on one slice of bread and 1/4 avocado on the other.  I also eliminated the EVOO.  I like the suggestion to use spinach instead of the lettuce; I will try that next time. This sandwich was filling and delicious.  Thank you for the healthy lunch recipe!

Excellent, but kinda messy to eat. I made the sandwiches the second time using a baguette. Slice in half the long way, then pull out some of the bread so the halves are about 1/2 inch thick, creating a trough to put the ingredients in. Assemble and enjoy.

I followed this recipe pretty closely except for the following: no sprouts, used pita bread. The pita bread made for a very messy sandwich, so I probably will use regular bread next time. However, I didn't think this sandwich had enough flavor. I'm not a big cucumber fan but trying to incorporate different veggies into my diet. I tossed the cucumbers and tomatoes in the vinegar and oil but didn't think it added much flavor. For me, the banana peppers saved the sandwich. I didn't really taste the cream cheese. I will probably play around with this recipe and make it again, but I was not too impressed.

Made this as listed the first time, minus the pepperocini (kidlet won't eat them.)  They were great.  Next time I made them with Ezekiel bread, and whipped 'Better Than Cream Cheese' spread with the mashed avocado for a light, creamy spread, adding a pinch of dill and garlic powder to the spread.  That made an excellent vegan sandwich that I still think about every time I pass alfalfa sprouts in the store.  My only problem is using up all the alfalfa sprouts before they go bad.  This is a yummy, healthy lunch.

This was very tasty even for people who eat meat. For those who have an autoimmune disease and cannot eat alfalfa sprouts, I highly recommend using brocco sprouts.  I think they taste the same but are much healthier in general, and safe for autoimmune diseases.

Making this sandwich is worth the extra little bit of food shopping, time and effort. It is different and very delicious. Try it with herbed cream cheese and a whole avocado!

This was really good. I asked my husband if he'd ever had a cucumber sandwich. He said no, but he would like it. He's a big cucumber fan. Made this as written except I used Whole Grain White which is what we always eat. And, my husband really enjoyed it. He asked if we could have this again sometime soon.

I used to order this sandwich when I worked in San Francisco.  They also used 1/2 an avocado and they left it nearly whole!  So delicious.  My favorite sandwich.  When I make it at home I sometimes add sliced radishes or pickles.  This is a perfect sandwich!

I make several variations on this sandwich at least 3 times a week.  It is versatile.  Sometimes I will add jalepenos and make a wasabi mayo to spread on it instead of cream cheese.  It is good with just about any type of veggies you have available at the time.  Also is tasty grilled on ciabatta or foccacia bread.  Good stuff!

Was not my favortite.  Thought that I would love this.  However, I did change a few thing- i used balsamic vin and a pita, and did not have the pepperocini :(.  Maybe with some good fresh bread and the suggested vin it will be better. Will try again but still think that it will lack some taste...  Maybe try some italian seasoning??

This is the best! I found this recipe because I was craving a veggie sandwich from a restaurant back home. I didn't have red wine vinegar, but I substituted it with seasoned rice wine vinegar. I omitted the pepperoncini. My sister and husband aren't vegetarians, but they loved it. YUMMY!!

These are exceptional, and have even more eye appeal when served in split pita breads.

I left out the oil and vinegar completely because I didn't want my sandwich dripping all over the place.  And it was still really awesome.  I also used red onion instead of the pepperoncini.  The submitter is right - this is a veggie's dream!

Im always looking for different sandwiches, and as its a lovely hot summers day here in the UK I fancied a really nice light snack - and this is perfect. Indulgent - yet it felt healthy. I haven't got a clue what a peperoncini is - (cant find them anywhere) so I used red salad pepper instead. This is the first time I have used avacado - and it made a great salad sandwich - no more boring salad sarnies for me!!

Because my avocado was not quite ripe, I made guacomole (1 avocado, 1/2 diced tomato, juice from 1/2 lemon, salt and cilantro to taste) and spread it on the sandwich rather than just plain avocado.  FYI:  This made enough for 2 sandwiches, and my husband raved about the recipe.

I've been making my version of this for years since first having one in a sandwich shop in Seattle.  Instead of the pepperoncini, oil and vinegar I use fresh tomato slices from my garden.  I also use avocado on both sides of the bread and eliminate the cream cheese.  A few added sunflower seeds are good too.  A great sandwich.  P.S.  If you have a Publix close by, its great on their sour dough plus 5 bread.

I just recently turned vegetarian and have been looking for easy, healthy foods I can have for lunch.  This sandwich was the first recipe I tried, and am happy to say that I don't have to look for any more recipes.  This sandwich was so good, it didn't even matter that there was no meat!  My avacado was not ripe enough, so I didn't use it, but I had swiss cheese that I added.  I'm not usually a fan of cucumber, but this sandwich made it taste great!  This is a great recipe to get people to eat their vegetables and not complain!

This has long been a  cool, easy favorite of mine, except I also enjoy it without the avocado, oil and vinegar. It's best on a hearty whole grain bread, such as Health Nut (sold by Arnold Breads, also called Brownberry in Midwest) or Oatnut. Enjoy!

Thanks for the recipe...this was delicious!  I used reduced fat wheat bread, 1/3 less fat cream cheese (hate the fat-free stuff!) and 1/4 avocado to reduce the calorie count.  It tasted fine made this way.  I made it in the morning and took it to work with me, and may have used 1/2 the oil & vinegar to keep it from getting soggy but it held up really well.  This one is definitely making the rotation.  I think it would also make a good wrap, and I might add some turkey to mix it up once in a while too!

This sandwich gets a big "thumbs up" from our family!  My 13-year-old daughter takes her lunch to school every day and recently told me she hates sandwiches.  Well, I found this treasure and made it for her, on homemade whole-wheat walnut bread and with everything else the same, and she told me she'd eat that every day.  Success!  I'm thrilled to have found this sandwich - it will be a mainstay in my lunchbox repertoire!

Five stars because I absolutely *hate* cucumbers but *loved* this sandwich!  All the ingredients compliment each other so I wouldn't change anything.  We made extra sandwiches and wrapped them tightly in foil for a "pan bagna" lunch the next day!

THIS recipe is THE BEST.. I'm not a FAN of sandwiches.. I usually like the hot food with lots of spices.. But OHHHH this was sooooo good.. I am craving it right now and will make it over and over again.. many times.. very easy cool refreshing and OHHHH.. so low in calories.. and SOOOO very very good.. I just eliminated the oil, and avocado, and added some thin sliced red onions.  The rest I left the same.. and I used it on Deli pita bread made by Sarah Lee.. Just THE best.. I CALCULATED The calories per sandwich and came up with only about 200 cal per DELICIOUS low fat sandwich.. 80 cal = pita, 100 cal= 2tbs philly cheese or just 70cal if you use light.. And they rest is the veggies.. SO YOU Do the math.. the best.. Thank you..

This was an excellent sandwich. I don't like pepperoncini or tomatoes so instead i sauteed some chopped up mushrooms in olive oil and redwine vinegar and i also added sunflower seeds to it. I think i would take everyone else's suggestions next time though and slice the avocado instead of mashing it.

It works wonderfully with or without the cucumber.  Also, 2 avocados is way too much for one sandwich, I ended up using about 1/2.

I love cucumbers so this was a good recipe to try.  I took some suggestions and used Pita bread but it also kept falling apart.  The best way to keep it all together was to use tortilla wraps.

I loved this sandwich.  If I were to make some recommendations tho, make sure your bread is thick enough to accomodate all that goes on it.  I only used one avacado, I think two would be way too much for one sandwich.  The oil and vinegar give it some "zang!".  I was thinking you could probably buy a long wheat sub bun and make a huge sub and slice it for company.

this was a nice light sandwich.. i think this can go a lot of different ways.. today i chose to leave out the cream cheese (would've used daiya) and i was out of tomato.. my only suggestion would be to use marinated cucumbers like other reviewers did.. very good.. ty for the recipe

This worked out really good. I used sourdough rolls and used sweet yellow peppers since I had them. Also I like a little onion and so diced up some green onions and put them in the mushed up avocado. My wife is vegetarian and I wanted to try and get away from the usual stuff and this really worked.

Ok here comes the healthy nut. Instead of cream cheese I mashed 1/2 oz of goat cheese with just 1/4 of avocado and used that as my spread. Let me just say WOW! I'm in love. Thank you

I'll definitely make it again .  I skipped mashing the avocado and the sandwich was all over the place.  Next time I'll mash the avocados and hopefully it will help keep the sandwich together.

Loved this!! Didn't even miss the meat.  Only changes I made were toasting the bread, slicing avocado (instead of spreading) and I used balsamic vinegar. I even fed to my 12 year old minus the couple ingredients she didn't like and she loved it also.

Great sandwich. I make something similar to this but I use a thin everything bagel, and hummus instead of cream cheese.

We made these using bagels when I cooked at a college veggie dining hall. We made them with and without avocado because some people don't like it. It is great both ways.

I added toasted sunflower seeds and black olives to the cream cheese along with some garlic and herbs. You could also get roasted red peppers added to it I made the above mentioned modifications and it was good.

The next time my brother tells me vegetarian sandwiches are never filling enough, I am making him one of these! It was really good. I did not use the oil or vinegar. I used a spinach and artichoke hummus instead of the cream cheese. Everything else was as the recipe stated. It was a very satisfying sandwich!

This was fabulous:  I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I didn't use alfalfa sprouts (couldn't find any), I omitted the pepperoncini and I sliced the avocado instead of mashing it.  It was delicious!!! This will be a staple for me.

Awesome sammich!!  

I subbed the cream cheese with creme fraiche, as it was all I had on hand.  Also added red onion and no sprouts, since I didn't have those either. Replaced the olive oil with pesto.  

Thanks for sharing!

Most satisfying veg sandwich I've tried, even missing 4 of the veggies ingredients! Where I live, avocados, lettuce, sprouts, pepperoncini and cream cheese are not available at all. So my sandwich only had onions, tomatoes and cucumbers, and my "cream cheese" was just yogurt with all the whey liquid strained out, and it was STILL DELICIOUS. Which proves the power of simple seasonings like S&P, oil & vinegar. Thank God for this fantastic combo!

Great sandwich.  I did over stuff it a bit and it was hard to keep it together but tasted greats.  I paired it with the corn salad from here and it was a hit.

I didn't quite have everything in stock to make this so had to improvise with what I had on hand. I only had spreadable veggie cream cheese, had no sprouts or banana peppers, so I added some slices of red onions. I used a big fat sandwich roll for the bread. I added some shakes of oregano and salt & pepper on the tomatoes. A very filling sandwich and I loved the cream cheese and avocado combo.  I am not really a big bread fan and will make this again but use a tortilla wrap to hold it all together better...and will get some sprouts and peppers...but sticking with the veggie cream cheese.

This was a good sandwich. I made a few modifications based on what I had at home - I omitted the alfalfa sprouts and pepperoncini and used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. I also used a garden vegetable cream cheese. I found the recipe to be filling but kind of bland. For 500 calories, I had hoped for a bit more. Also, the sandwich was a bit slippery and too full - it fell apart almost right away. As others have said, eat it right away because the bread does get soggy. I really like the concept of the cream cheese and avocado, so I will try it again with less vegetable stuffing and I'll add garlic powder. Oh, and definitely salt!!

Really good - didn't have sprouts, but next time will try to find them.  I also think it needs a little zip - maybe some type of vinaigrette instead of just the red wine vinegar?  Great way to pack in the veggies, though!

I used Dave's Killer Bread, I spiced up my cream cheese with onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed and fresh ground pepper and I used reduced fat cream cheese . I did use a whole handful of alfalfa sprouts and I did not add avocado only because I don't care for it. HALF of a sandwich was perfect with a cup of homemade veggie pizza soup for lunch.

I was less than impressed. Made this sandwich twice. The first time, I omitted the EVOL, vinegar, lettuce, and pepperoncini. I also used a toasted, sprouted bagel instead of bread. That might've been a 4-star sandwich. When I made the recipe the second time with the EVOL, vinegar, and lettuce (but subbing red bell pepper slices for the pepperoncini and using the same bagel), I found the vinegar far too overwhelming. I tried to finish the sandwich, but ended up throwing some of it away. I much prefer the sandwich without the vinegar and EVOL, as the cream cheese, avocado, and sprouts are flavorful enough on their own. Additionally, there is too much filling for my taste. Would not make this recipe as specified again, but might alter it and try it using these ingredients and proportions: 1 toasted sprouted bagel, 1 T cream cheese, 3 slices cucumber, 1 T sprouts, 1 tomato slice, 2 sliced olives, 1/3 mashed avocado, sea salt and pepper to taste, possibly some mustard or onion powder, maybe some spinach leaves. Thank you for the idea, though; the concept of this sandwich is solid! I consider the key ingredients to be the cream cheese, avocado, sprouts, and a high-quality tasty bread or bagel.

This sandwich didn't have much flavor. It definitely has potential,but needed s&p and a lot more oil and vinegar. I think oregano would have helped too.

This was an OK sandwich. I made mine on white bread and my husbands on wheat. Wheat is the way to go. The white was just to soft and it got mushy with the Italian dressing I put on instead of the oil and vinegar.

delicious sandwich. I used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site in place of the oil and vinigar as suggested by another reviewer. Did everything else the same. Very flavorful. Definately a keeper.

Reallllly good sandwich, especially on a hot summer day.  I omitted the avocado (ONLY because I didn't have it on hand) though I wish I would have had it. Used Panera's low-fat veggie cream cheese and it tasted great. I wouldn't change a thing!

Left out the olive oil and balsamic, but added bacon. The heavy bread we used stole a lot of the flavour.

This was a really good sandwich! I made mine on some sourdough tomato sandwich rolls I had made and it was tasty. I left off the lettuce and added some garlic powder and salt. I really liked the oil and vinegar. Ill totally be making this again!

Good flavor.  I may try it with a thicker bread next time since it did start to get a little soggy toward the end.

Pretty good...my note to myself was to try shredding the cukes and radishes and adding them to the cream cheese; maybe sprinkle with vinegar/oil/oregano?

This has become my sandwich staple?  I make an olive cream cheese at home and use that as the spread.  Use the avocados whole - no mashing.  And use the sprouts if I have them - otherwise it's good without as well.  On toasted sourdough or any good thick hearty bread.  Just perfect.

really enjoyed this sandwich, but had to leave out the avacodo, due to a food sensitivity. Can anyone suggest a substitute for the avacodo??

This was good, not fantastic.  I thought some of the ingredients didn't go well together (cream cheese and avacoado).  I think next time I might add some turkey to see if it gives it some more flavor and play around with the ingredients.

mm yummy, i loved it. I used Golden peppers, they were really hot. Don't know if they're the same? But i don't remember pepperochini's being  that spicy, so maybe they are different. I did without tomatos cause i can't stand them. 
So good though, will be my lunch

This sandwich was soo good. I loved it. I toasted the bread and used garden cream cheese because that is what I had. I also omitted the oil blend and used  onion instead of pepprochini. Awesome good. I have had 4 sandwiches in two days..Yummy

Loved this one! I used Orowheat's health nut bread because it's the only kind I buy.  Used herbed cream cheese, vinaigrette instead of oil and vinegar, and red onion instead of pepperoncini.  By the end of the week, I'm making it from memory!  Thanks a bunch for sharing!

This is a yummy sandwhich, and the flavors of the avocado and cream cheese added a rich tasting spread to the vegetables.  It may require the additiona of honey mustard or a zingy herb of some sort to really drive the sandwhich home.  Also, I may add roasted red peppers next time!

Wow! This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I left out a couple ingredients we didn't have (sprouts and pepperoncini) and it was still fabulous. My boyfriend and I couldn't stop raving while we ate. I think the avacado is the key to the sandwich. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

i love this sandwich! i think it's my new favorite. the one problem with this is that my sister is always trying to steal half my sandwich and i made this everyday for about a week i liked it that much. i like to leave the avocado in slices (i love avocado) and i think it tastes better when the cucumber is sliced about 1/4 inch thick. extra cream cheese on the bottom keeps this from getting soggy. i start by putting avocado on one side and cucumber on the other then sprinking with some black pepper and a little garlic salt then start putting the other ingredients in. mmm and extra peppers sooooooooooo easy. i like using this sara lee oat and nut bread that my mom gets at least i think that's what it's called.

I love this sandwich! I'm a vegetarian and can not take dairy product except butter. So I replace the cheese with butter, pepperoncini with onion, wine vinegar with lemon then I add into the dressing a pinch of salt for the taste, pepper & a drop of honey. It works great! Thanks for the idea.

I was pretty happy with this.  I toasted the bread and also sliced the cukes lengthwise.  Oh, and I used guacamole instead of just an avacado.
I think next time I'll use red onions instead of pepperoncini's and maybe use just a tad less cream cheese.

I made these for a bridal shower and they were a total hit!  I omitted the pepperoncini, but otherwise made as directed.  I did remove the crusts from the bread and cut the sandwiches into small squares--great finger food, and so elegant!

THANK YOU for this awesome recipe.  Was having a pregnancy craving for this and it sure hit the spot.  I will be making this all the time now!!  I eliminated a lot of the mess by toasting 7-grain bread and letting it slightly cool before spreading with cream cheese and only using a light drizzling of oil and vinegar.  I also took the suggestion from another reviewer and sliced cucumber longways, which helped keep it from falling out.  Didn't use pepperocini's but did add thinly sliced red onion.  YUMMY!!!!

Great recipe!  I made this for my roommate and I to take to work in our lunches, and as someone who dislikes cucumber, he just loved them.  I did deviate from your recipe slightly, because bread wouldn't hold up after 4 hours, even in a chilled lunch box.  I used spinach wraps (which you can find in just about any grocery store) and garden vegetable flavored cream cheese and they turned out great!  Thanks for the fabulous lunch idea!!

Totally yummy combination.  Quick, easy, meatless combination!  I love sprouts on any sandwich and the vinegar and oil made it nice and tangy!

I am not a vegetarian, but this was SO good. I made it into a wrap with spinach tortillas, and it was great. I ate one for lunch, then one for dinner. Has enough kick that you really don't miss the meat at all. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great tasting sandwich but the fat content is a nightmare!  79 gm fat in one sandwich is enough to have your cholesterol flying out the window in one day.  
Yes, what is a 'pepperoncini'?  The terminologies in Australia are frequently different.

This sandwich is so delicious, I eat it all the time...But I've noticed that there are alot of ingredients in it, and sometimes the bread just wouldn't hold it all in, so I use Pita bread now. It tastes just as good, and all the stuff stays where it should! Thanks for a great sandwich, Jennifer!

I didn't know what pepperoncini was.  The people at the grocery store helped and we figured out it was salad peppers.  This was a very good sandwich!  Our guest, who is a vegetarian, really raved about them and ate several.  My mom, who is very health conscience since her stroke, thought it was very tasty AND healthy.  Used wheat hogey buns.

I really enjoyed this-- I made it with low-fat cream cheese and a new type of 
avocado that's lower in fat.  I'm sure it would have been REALLY yummy with the
"full fat" versions, but it was still quite good.  I also used some Annie's Goddess 
salad dressing on it instead of the oil & vinegar.  My husband didn't much care 
for this, but then he's not a cream cheese fan, plus it was his first time trying 
sprouts.  It's a great recipe for me, though, because I'm always looking for new
lunch idease and I'm planning to take the ingredients to work tomorrow to make
a sandwich there.

WE LOVED IT.  Definitely not just a cucumber sandwich. There is a lot going on in this, but it is great. I used goat cheese. Cream cheese would probably spread better, could probably use softened cream cheese herb dip. It’s messy, but it was wonderful.

Delicious and healthful. It will get soggy quickly so serve it immediately. Also needs a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. The pepperoncini is a great addition!

I’ve made a version of this sandwich for years and it is so delicious and refreshing! I usually put cream cheese on one slice of bread and mayonnaise on the other slice, don’t use oil and vinegar but do use salt and pepper on the veggies. I thinly slice the cucumbers and slice instead of mash avocado.  I’ve also added chopped green olives to the cream cheese which is yummy. I will try also adding lettuce and banana peppers (I like those better than pepperocini) but don’t care for bean sprouts. Though my husband is a confirmed meat eater and hamburger lover he loves this vegetable sandwich!

I used a really nutty and seedy bread and toasted it. I didn't have alfalfa sprouts so i used bean sprouts (not a great idea but I ate it anyway, lol.) I forgot the pepperoncinis. But will remember next time.. Everything else was awesome. This was the second time I made it...today, and then several years ago. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!

I loved this recipe. I made a little change to the cream cheese spread. I used 1 ounce of cream cheese, 1 Tbsp of mayonnaise and a little celery salt. Instead of a sandwich I made a wrap and it was perfect.

I love this sandwich! I found this recipe online a long time ago...not sure if it was even on Allrecipes...and every time I've made it over the years, I fall in love all over again. It's different from the usual veggie sandwich. Alot of different tastes combine to make it one fantastic treat! A keeper for sure!

Delicious!  Didn't have cream cheese so I used Brie instead.  I also added some French's fried onions and it was the perfect amount of a little salty and crunch.

It didn't turn out the way I expected and I attribute that to the sprouts - not a big fan of sprouts.  When I tried it again without the sprouts it tasted better.

My cucumbers are growing like crazy in the garden this year, so I have been searching for new cucumber recipes.  This was such a simple concept, and the flavors came together wonderfully!  I made it exactly as directed, except the omission of the bean sprouts- my grocery store was out of them, so I left those out.  This sandwich was messy to eat, but had outstanding flavor!  I saw some other reviews where people questioned the mashing of the avocado.  I see the benefit of mashing it.  The mashed avocado helps hold everything together!  I have had avocado slices on sandwiches before and they always seem to slip out.  I love this sandwich so much, I made it a second time today for lunch!  Again, without the sprouts because I didn't have any on hand.  I'll try it again with the sprouts soon!

Delicious! I didn't have pepperocini or romaine. I used spinach instead. I mashed 1 small avocado with about 1Tblsp chopped onion and garlic salt. I used Paul Neuman's  balsamic dressing and toasted my multigrain wheat bread. It was very good.

I used all the veggies in a low-carb wrap with no cream cheese and double the avocado.  For me, the  key to avocado sandwiches is yellow mustard and salt, so I added those.  Delicious sandwich.  Thanks!

This was a really good veggie sandwich. I will add salt and pepper next time I make because it was just a tiny bit bland.

I've made this twice now.  The first time, I made no substitutions but after reading other reviews, did half the amount of olive oil and red wine vinegar.  I had to agree with the review that said it just wasn't good.  The taste of the olive oil was unpleasant for me.  Also, it was very sloppy.  The second time, I sharpened up my knife and sliced the veggies super-thin.  That made a huge difference; the sandwich held together and was not sloppy at all.  I also took another review into consideration and subbed Italian dressing for the oil and vinegar.  Scrumptious!  You actually had me at peperoncini and I thought I'd love the sandwich since I really love fresh-veggie sandwiches, and peperoncinis.  I'm giving it four stars because even if I'd sliced the veggies thin the first time, the olive oil was off-putting and twice the amount of it would have wrecked it for me.  Still a great base recipe though, and a great healthy option!  Thanks!

It took a few bites for me to warm up to it. It wasn't terrible, but I probably won't be making it again. I didn't use vinegar or red wine. Probably for the best.

I make this sandwich all the time and it's awesome. I also add shredded carrots, and red onions. Any cheese would be good too not just cream cheese. Any sliced cheese depending on your taste. When I want to make it more hearty I add turkey, but also have added ham. Once again anything would be delicious with all those veggies.

Couldn't find alfalfa sprouts but we didn't miss them and don't think its really necessary.  My wife and I really enjoyed these and definitely will be fixing these again.  This is probably the best veggie sandwich that we have ever had.

I changed the bread for a corn tortilla and added hummus instead of cream cheese. It went really well with the cucumber! I loved this recipe.

My entire family loved this recipe, even the kids!!! I served it 'family style,' i.e., I let everyone assemble their own sandwich. We used lettuce, avocado, pepperoncini, onion, tomato, cucumber, sprouts and cream cheese. I did make the dressing that another reviewer mentioned from this site (Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing) which was, as it promised, FABULOUS! This sandwich is a keeper and I'll absolutely make it again and again.

I don't put in olive oil or vinegar. my three changes:

-add pickles
-eat this on toasted whole wheat bread.
-no cucumber slices

put pepperoncini on the side.

Now it tastes even better. yum!!

Excellent. I used 100% Whole Grain Fiber Bread from Trader Joe's for extra nutrition. They didn't have pepperoncinis, so I used green peppers, and now know it would've been better with the pepperoncinis- would've packed a lot more flavor! I also used snow pea shoots because Trader Joe's did not have alfalfa sprouts. I read they actually have more protein anyway!

YUMMY!!!  I used Sandwich Thins by Oroweat for bread and I didn't have any red wine (forgot to grab it at the store) so I used balsamic.  I'm excited to try it with the red wine vinegar!  With the Sandwich thins it had a weight watchers points plus vale of 5!  A lot of food for just 5 points!!!

Who knew a sandwhich could be so fabulous.  I changed the recipe up a little, so that I could cut back on the WW points.  I used a lower fat onion chive cream cheese. I left of the avocado and left off the oil.  As another reviewer mentioned, I also used balsamic vinagrette.  It was just wonderful.  I've had one every day for lunch this week.

We made these for lunch and they were pretty good - very fresh tasting.  (We omitted the sprouts since we do not like them).  They were very fresh tasting.  More filling than I expected they would be, but definitely could use an accompaniment (soup, salad, etc.).  I might make these again, but wouldn't add to the regular rotation.

We marinated the cuke slices in Paul Newman's viniagrette.  Didn't have lettuce or pepperoncini.  Sliced the avocado.  Lightly toasted our 100% whole wheat bread.  Talk about a delicious veggie sandwich!  My 18 year old and 12 year old really liked this, as did I.

I thought this was good! I made it on a whim, so I didn't have any alfalfa sprouts, but it still worked out fine. I also, only had Italian-style sliced bread, so I lightly toasted that. Instead of using plain mashed avocado, I used 'Avocado Chimichurri' recipe from this site. This is such a light and refreshing sandwich! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've loved this sandwich since childhood!  The only difference is that I add a touch of garlic salt and pepper.  Yum!  Yum!  My garden cucumbers are now ready!  When I'm on the go, I buy the Veggie Sandwich at Jimmy John's.  Hold the mayo and provolone if you like and add vinegar & oil and hot peppers.  Similar!

This sandwich was okay, but was kind of bland. Needs another ingredient to spice it up a little to add flavor. Good ingredients, just was too wet/mushy for me.

I scaled down the ingredients, quatered and seeded the pepperoncini, sliced everything thinly and made these into a wrap appetizer. Sooo delicious! I later made a whole wrap for myself. I spread the cream cheese on one side and the mashed avocado on the other. I found that when I did this I never got a bite with both avocado and cream cheese so next time I will keep tp the centre of the wrap. I'll start with the cream cheese, then spread the avocado, then lettuce, pepperoncini, cukes, tomatoes, sprouts and dressing :)

Made this on a toasted bagel with chive & green onion flavored cream cheese & left out the oil and vinegar. Delicious!

This is my new FAVORITE sandwich!! I was really in the mood for something light and easy for dinner and this was it! I didn't have any peperocini but other than that I made it just as written only toasted my bread and it was amazing. Thank you so much for this absolutely delicious sandwich!

This sandwich was absolutely delicious. I prepared as the recipe states except I used balsamic vinegarette dressing instead of oil and vinegar because that's what I had on hand. It would also be good with grilled chicken. I highly recommend this recipe.

Just what I was craving!!  I woke up craving raw, crunchy beggies so this fit perfect!!  I did not have pepperocini so skipped that.  I also used mung bean sprouts as that is what I had on hand.  Made it even crunchier.  Great sandwich, hands down!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious and so healthy! A perfect blend of flavors and textures. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I just used a little bit of balsamic vinaigrette dressing, still tasted great. Yum, will be making this one quite often to bring to class. Thanks for submitting it!

Yum yum. Im not vegetarian but i love this sandwich. I skip on the oil, i dont find it necessary. It tastes fine without pepperoncini if you dont have it, or dont like it. To mix up the flavor, try sun dried tomato cream cheese (or another flavored cream cheese.) Try to eat asap, if you wait too long the bread gets soggy from the tomatoes.

This is a great concept.  Left off the alfa alfa sprouts because didn't have any and don't particularly care for them.  It was good except that I didn't care for the cream cheese, and I like cream cheese.  I think it could easily be left off and it would make it just as good and healthier.  The best part by far though were the pepperoncinnis.

ive had this sandwich a very long time ago and it was so good!  i just made it again, and unfortunately, i only had regular salad lettuce, and living on an army base in germany, the army grocery stores do not carry the sprouts(which i used to put on almost any sandwich), but it was still amazing!  the rest of the avo im going to use to make guac!UPDATE: i forgot to mention, half an avocado is too much for one side of bread, and if you add garlic salt on the avo instead of regular salt with the pepper, it gives it a lot better flavor!

This sandwich was amazing!!! My boyfriend called me on the phone while I was eating it. I raved to him about it and couldn't get off the phone fast enough to finish it (I was quite hungry, lol). I did add mushrooms and spinich, and I substituted a creamy hummus (any flavor could work but I used one with roasted pine nuts) instead of the cream cheese (just to make it a little more healthy- if that's even possible!). I loved the banana peppers. It gave it a mild sweetness compared to all the other flavors. Unfortunately, I was so excited when making it that I forgot the oil and vinegar. Even without, it was delicious. I'll have to remember to add them next time. Great sandwich! Thanks! :)

This is a great picnic option. I make my cucumber sandwiches more like the British version, using white bread. I also use  seasoned rice vinegar for extra flavor. Definitely, serve and enjoy immediately so the bread doesn't get mushy.

I always make this for parties and always get requests to make them again. They are good for if you have vegetarian guests. I blend the avocado and cream cheese in a food processor with a dash of salt and lemon juice to make a creamy spread. I still place some on both pieces of bread in order to keep the sandwich sticking together. I've never tried it with the dressing though, but it's still amazing.

This sandwich just doesn't taste like much og anything.  I changed so much to make it better that effectively I made a different sandwich.  Toasted the bread, used herbed cream cheese, used broccoli sprouts instead of alfalfa, added red onion, used balsamic vinegarette and mustard.

This sandwich reminds me of one of my favorite vegetarian sandwiches from a local restaurant in town.  It was very filling and yummy.  The only thing I changed was I left off the cream cheese and used Greek hummus instead. I also added a few slices of pepper jack cheese. I didn't have the pepperocini but will add it next time I make it. Thumbs up to this recipe!

It was very filling.  I used homemade bread.  I don't think I added enough vinegar or pepperocini because I didn't taste the vinegar at all and the pepperocini only minimally when I happened to get a slice.

Oh my goodness!  This may be the best sandwich I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it, although my 15 year old decided she could pass on the alfalfa.  Next time I'll try it on a croissant and maybe sneak in a little roast beef if no one is looking!!

We loved this sandwich.  The pepperoncini adds just enough zip without being overpowering.  I substituted baby spinach for the lettuce.

Very tasty.  I used fresh homemade white bread (slice your bread nice and thick).  I also used sweet onions, as suggested by others.  I assume the pepperoncinis are some sort of pickled peppers, but did not use them.  I used the garden veggie cream cheese, but thought it could have been eliminated.  However, I am not a lover of cream cheese, except in cheesecake and deserts!  I think seasoned mayo would work just fine, and save you a few calories too!  All in all, it was very good.  Get your napkins ready!

Very good sandwich! We used salad dressing of choice rather than vinegar and oil.  I also added some salsa to the avacado. (chop up pepperoncini and rinse because it is very hot!)

This was so delicious! I couldn't find pepperoncini so I used onion instead. My only complaint was that the whole wheat bread I used was a little sweet. I'm going to make this again with kaiser rolls or a cheese bread. Thanks, Jennifer!

This is a GREAT sandwich!!  I used an entire avacado vice just half (I love avacado).  I also took others advice and used only 1 teaspoon of oil and vinegar.  I have passed along this recipe to my mother, and she loves it too!!

This was an outstanding sandwich.  I was looking for a way to get rid of cucumbers last week when I saw this recipe.  It didn't sound like something I'd like (too many veggies), but for some reason couldn't get it out of my mind.  I made half a sandwich tonight to test the recipe and was *very* impressed with it.  I'm having this again tomorrow!!

FABULOUS sandwich! The oil and vinegar really adds great flavor along with the pepperoncinis. Perfect for an early summer luncheon on the back porch with a dear friend. She left with the recipe.

This was okay. My avocado went bad before I had a chance to use it, so it may have been better with the avocado. I am not a big cucumber fan, so I rated this higher than I would have. But, for cucumber it was pretty good. :o) I liked the oil & vinegar combination.

This is one of the best veggie sandwiches ever!  The only thing I changes was that I sliced the avocado because I liked the look of it better that way.  I loved it even though I forgot to get the pepporoncini (which I love).

WOW!!!  What a combination!! I am a person that hates cucumbers, tomatoes, and alfa sprouts! But since I needed to incorporate more veggies in my diet, I came across this recipe and couldn't believe how good it was! I did everything the recipe called for except I used Light Italian Bread and sliced the avacodos instead fo mashing them. I also used Light cream cheese and a very light sprinkle of Good Season's Italian Dressing instead of the oil and vinegar. Although it fell apart a little, it was great! Next time I think I will toast the Italian Bread first. I am definately going to try this on my kids, because they are not vegetable eaters, I think the pepperoncini peppers might be a little too much kick for them, so I will make it with roasted red peppers. This is definately a keeper!! Thanks Jennifer!!!

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The cream cheese made all the difference! I didn't have any sprouts, pepperoncini, tomatoes, or even avocadoes. I used mushrooms and red pepper instead. It still turned out very, very, well. Flavourful and unique. I've made this several times, and will continue to make it.

Very good, I used banana peppers instead of pepperocini and I loved it! One of those sandwiches you eat for lunch since your husband won't eat it! =) Thanks!
