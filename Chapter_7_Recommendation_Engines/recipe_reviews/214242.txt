I have made this dessert for many occasions, and it is always a hit.  I do use more than an 8 ounce tub of Cool Whip though as my top layer never looked as thick as the picture.  When I measure the peanut butter, I heap the 1/3 cup.  This is personal preference that came from making the dessert so many times.  I have used low fat Oreos, low fat cream cheese, cool whip free and sugar free jello with excellent results.

I did modify to what I already had, but it was f a b u l o u s!!!  I made a graham cracker crust and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  It was fantastic.  The extended family loved it and took most of the left-overs home.  It has a nice balance of heavy and light and it tasted just as good the next day.  Very yummy.  I will definitely make again. (:
