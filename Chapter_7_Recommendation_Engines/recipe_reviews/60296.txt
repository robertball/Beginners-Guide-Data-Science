I had to go out and buy yogurt, this was so tasty. Couldn't find split pea flour, so I used my blender and made my own. And used the "self-rising flour" on this site. Lot's of work for my first batch, yes, but I knew it looked good. I am glad I have leftover batter, more every day. This is going to be my India food week, along with Elijah's Phulouries, of course.

I personalized this recipe by using garbanzo bean flour instead of the split pea flour, iand rye flour (as the self rising flour).  I cooked this as if they were pancakes.  Great flavor!  Easy to make!  I'll be making this again.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I had all the ingredients on hand--believe it or not--except the self-rising flour. I had a little all-purpose flour and a little whole wheat flour. So, I sifted the two together with salt, sugar and baking powder to create self-rising flour. Also, I had on hand Urad flour, which is black bean flour. I went ahead and mixed everything together and into the oil it went. The fritters came out golden, light, spongy and so flavorful. Add mango chutney to that and what a wonderful treat! It's delicious.

I like these!  I burned them--I'm just not so good at frying.  I think I'll make them into patties next time and eat them like hamburgers--with chutney of course!  I used my small cookie scoop to make the balls, so they were kind of big.  Maybe that was my problem.  Oh, well.  I had to go on a bit of a search for the split pea flour, but found in an international market.  Best I can tell it's chickpea flour, so that's what I bought.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! These were great! I had to end up making my own split pea flour. Which my processor didn't like. But otherwise these were easy adn yummy. I used fresh chives from my garden instead of green onion and added a pinch of cayenne. My friends and family loved this also. I ate them with cilantro chutney!!!!I ordered some split pea flour and will making them again tomorrow night!

i've been making this since i was a little girl. My family has a traditional hand grinder that we grind basically the same ingredients into. I dont think that this beats that in taste but it was a pretty good recipe.

I just made these - they are fragrant and flavorful!  One note: I needed double the amount of water to get a thick batter (I used 1.5 cups).  I also used "gram flour", which, based on the packaging, I assume is the same as split pea flour (it is yellow lentil flour).  In the future I would increase the amounts of both types of onions (I did so after I tried the first batch), and perhaps experiment by adding peas.  A nice dish overall!

I used different seasonings so I can't comment on flavour but I'm commenting on texture instead. This recipe has too much dhaal (split pea flour) for my tastes and the second time I made it I added a little more flour and baking powder. That was more to my liking. My family really enjoyed this - both times and both ways I made it. Thanks JWARD for the recipe.

I think that the onion spoiled this recipe.  If I make it again, I would omit the onion and use less garlic.  Make sure it is the split pea flour that comes from the Caribbean; it comes in a package or make your own by soaking the peas overnight and then grinding it.  I bought some in the market, but it was not the best, the taste was not right.
