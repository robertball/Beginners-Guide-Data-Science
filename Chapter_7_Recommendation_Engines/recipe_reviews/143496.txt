It sounds good but my mom is Korean and she has never made it with ham or cheese. We always ate it with egg, carrots, dakquan(which is pickled yellow radish), and occasionally beef or dried squid.

Yes, again the cheese is weird to me too, but with that said kimbap can be made anyway you want.  Kim - is seaweed and bap - is rice, the possibilities are endless and I had it many ways.  Each family makes it differently.  I personally like mine with dak - quang (pickled radish), bulgogi (korean beef), steamed spinach, egg and carrots.  It's just what I'm used to.

I agree with the others.  Some of the ingredients were a little odd.  My favorite is imitation crab meat, kimchee (lay on paper towel first to get rid of most of the juice), egg, pickled radish, and carrot sticks (I parboil them first so that they aren't so crunchy).

Everything was great, except me being Korean, the cheese is not very traditional, nor the ham - more commonly bulgogi or spam are used instead, and alternate of cheese, there's this korean yellow radish - none the less, very good!

Its okay as long as you sorta tweak it
cheese is popular with the korean teenagers but most kim bab is made without cheese. Also I always had kimbab with hotdogs, sliced lengthwise. Also, this is missing "dan-moo-gee" which is pickled radish, gives the kim bab a good tangy taste. 

but if you want to make it with cheese, here are some other "fusion" ingrediants to add:
tuna, beef, kimchi, pork cutlet.
and for vegetarians, you can make this without any meat, still tasty if you make it right

As to those who said this wasn't authentic or how they had it, I wrote it as it was given to me by a Korean student studying here.  It is possible that she was using the ingredients available here and not making it quite the way it is usually made, but she didn't say anything to that effect.  Also, I spoke to a friend of mine who said that she had the same thing made by another Korean student studying in Canada.  This may be due to the area they were from or just the generation they were born in.

I am Korean and I have been around long enough to know that everyone has different flavors. My mom use to make ours with hotdogs, and I have heard of people using cream cheese. I think what ever you have in your kitchen, as any thing goes. A good note to everyone is not to fill it with too much rice or it will be hard to roll about a 1/4 inch layer should be good. And make sure that everything is patted dry or you will rip the seaweed when you roll,cut or eat it.

Super good, and super easy to "personalize".  Our neighbor makes hers with fried SPAM strips, pickled daikon, and egg.  Sometimes we use blanched carrot strips, too.  Sometimes, kimchee and beef.  Any way you make these, they're delicious!

I grew up eating Kim Bap as my Dad spent some time in Korea as a young man and I have never had it with cheeseo.O But other wise it sounds right. My Dad uses ham once in a while just for a different twist:) My birthday is in a few days and he is making this for me! Oh Yeah!

I used radish and crab as well but I didn't use the cheese. I oiled the outside of the roll with a touch of sesame oil.

I have been living in Seoul for a little while now and it is pretty common to see kimbap with ham and cheese.  I prefer tuna to ham or cheese though.

I lived in Korea for a while and this type is indeed sold there. It is not traditional but the kind you buy at a convienience store as a snack..I bought it many times. If you buy Kimbap in a resturaunt or had it made in someones home you would not get this version ..it's the takeout version of Kimbap.

Very good!  We lived in Northern China for 3 years and I would walk once or twice a week to a local butcher shop. The cleanest butcher shop in our area and it just happened to be owned by a husband and wife from Korea.  There are apparently a lot of Koreans in that area of China.  The butchers wife made these and sold them in the shop.  She made them with ham but no cheese.....cheese was very expensive there so that may be why she didn't use the cheese.  She also made one with tuna (canned)  and pineapple. Sounds strange but it was delicious!  So glad I found this recipe.....I really miss living in China and I miss the Korean butcher and his lovely wife. This is definitely a comfort food for me now!  So THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to Katie K for posting this recipe!!!
