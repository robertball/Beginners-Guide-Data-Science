Great marinade! I did cut the recipe back and used just a bit less Italian seasoning (personal preference). Nice combo of flavors and was great for an eye of round roast. I will def be making this again for roasts as well as other cuts of beef! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this just as itâ€™s written.  My BF is particular about flavors, but we both loved it!  Will definitely use again!

Great Marinade. Awesome flavors. Used it on a roast we did on the BBQ rotisserie. Will use this one again.
