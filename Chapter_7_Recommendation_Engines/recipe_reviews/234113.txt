The soup was on the rather bland/boring side. The description of a carnivore going crazy over the soup and the "really fast" description in the title got me excited that this was going to be a fantastic soup. It was not really fast to make, except I sped it up by shredding the zucchini in my Vitamix blender. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used low-sodium broth. I can't imagine the reduced sodium affecting the final outcome of the soup though. It basically tasted to me like shredded zucchini, onion, and a very lightly flavored water. I am giving it 3 stars, because it is healthy and I hate to be the first rater of a recipe rating really less than that. Someone might find a way to doctor this up, and love it.
