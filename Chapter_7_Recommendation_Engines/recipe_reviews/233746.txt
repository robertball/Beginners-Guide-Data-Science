This recipe seems a little plain so I spiced it up a bit and made a few changes after reading the comments. I only uses 4 cups of milk instead of 6.  At beginning when I put the butter in pan I threw in some chopped onions, crushed red pepper, salt&pepper and little garlic powder..... I didn't have the bread crumbs so i used I sleeve of RITZ crackers crushed. It turned out amazing! Definitely will make this again!

This is comfort food, pure and simple.  I scaled the recipe back to 2 servings and added 1/2 tsp dry mustard to the white sauce.  I had no bread crumbs so I just topped it with shredded cheese.  Delicious!

This was a very basic but tasty recipe. I scaled it back to 2. servings. I made it as a side dish for our family of 4 and still had about 1/2 left.

I've made this twice now and the first time I felt it was to thin off a sauce. The second time I made it I did serving size of 4 (like the pervious time) but I used 4 and a half cups milk instead a 6. Much better Consistency! I also used different types of cheese for taste and wheat flour. It was yummy.

Just finished putting this in the oven. This is one of our family's go to recipes. I have scaled back the milk to about 4 cups versus the 6 it calls for..... I also added diced ham as an addition.  And finally added a little Parmesan to the bed crumbs for an additional cheese. 

Alternative additions I have used over time are: a packet of ranch dressing with a smaller flour amount, two tablespoons yellow mustard to the cheese sauce, or two tablespoons or worchestshire sauce (for a smoky meaty flavor)

As one of the other reviewers said, something was missing. My daughter suggested using different types of cheese and also adding bacon or ham. The possibility of adding sliced tomatoes at the end of the baking period might also help. I will also try using dry mustard as one other reviewer suggested. If I think it's just ok after the additions I will not make again!

Made for Thanksgiving this year. My family liked this. I was not all that impressed. It needed something in the cheese mixture. I will try adding some type of spice or seasoning next time I make it. I think I saw someone said they added ground mustard, I think I will try that next time.

Needed to add quite a bit more cheese as I found it a bit bland, and could definitely reduce the amount of milk. But overall was good.

I think this turned out great! Some may not like the texture difference with the breadcrumbs but I prefer that. The rest of the Mac and cheese is very creamy/cheesey. I put a little bit of cheese on the top before I baked it.

These reviews are spot on. 4 full cups of milk is the key. I did 3+ and wished that I had gone a full four. So tasty. Just lacked a little of that saucy feel. Added mustard like the others along with pepper and garlic. Was nearly perfect.

I made this for dinner and didn't have cheddar cheese so I used Mozzarella. I did add my own little twist and only added 4 cups milk and added 1 cup sour cream. Turned out delicious!!
