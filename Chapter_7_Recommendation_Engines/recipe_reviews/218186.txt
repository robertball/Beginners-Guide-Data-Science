Wow!  This is so good!  I used vegetable oil spray instead of the olive oil, and used thyme instead of tarragon.  Without the recipe, I would have missed having a wonderful soup!  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was fantastic; perfect for a cold day.  I left out the basil and it had quite a hearty flavor while the soup itself was not too heavy.

Very hardy and flavorful! Getting over the mentality that anything pink/red should be sweet is an issue for me, but after the first bite I'm usually ok.

Delicious!  We garnished with goat cheese, which tasted great.  Will definitely make this again!

Wonderful; make it for 16, and everyone (who liked beets) loved it.

I've made this 3 times using slight variations on the spices used. Always turns out great and is absolutely delicious!

Love Beet Soup. I always cook my beets cut up in a microwave a lot faster. Just an idea. Some recipes call for a dab of sour cream. I wouldn't use tarragon since i don't like it.

So surprisingly good. I did not have any leeks so I used 1 small shallot instead. Will make this again soon. Thanks for this delicious red beet recipe.

I used golden beets, and I peeled and cut them up before roasting them in the oven with a little olive oil. It turned out delicious. This recipe is a very good basis to start from and innovate.
