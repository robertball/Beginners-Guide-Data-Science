ABSOLUTELY YUMMY! easy, creamy and just perfect in my opinion. I did it instead of a cake since it was my daughters birthday and she had been craving cheesecake. The whole family Loved it. Even a begginer can do this! Enjoy!

very easy to make! Just make sure the jam stays warm when you spread it otherwise it smears in the cheesecake with it. But this dish was a very big hit at my family reunion. Everyone was impressed because the designs make it look professional. Also, tastes great!

I made this for a Memorial Day BBQ and it was a huge hit!  It was also incredibly easy to make, which is great for an inexperienced cook like me.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This is the simplest cheesecake I've ever made, and yet I get some of the best compliments when I bring it to summer parties!  One tip: refrigerate the cheesecake with the cookie cutters still in tact.  That way when you remove them later, the sauce won't run into your pretty star-shaped cutouts.

I got rave reviews on this cheesecake. I chose to make just one large star in the center and fill it in with blueberries. I didn't like the idea of having servings with no topping. With this change, every piece has strawberry jam, blueberries or both.
