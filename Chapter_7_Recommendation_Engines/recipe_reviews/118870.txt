This was a great recipe. I used refried beans instead of pureeing the black beans. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this recipe!  We vegetarians and therefore big bean eaters here so the bean mixture was big hit and a great alternative to tomatoes.  I didn't follow the exact measurements for the toppings, just put on what looked good to me, and added some jalapenos too.  I also add garlic to the bean puree.  Yum yum, I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe exactly, and felt like something was missing. I was excited about the healthy veggie aspect, but for flavor - found the cinnamon a bit overpowering. My husband complained that there was "too much stuff piled on top", making it hard to eat. If made again I would use canned refried beans instead of the puree, would cut the cinnamon in half, and would add more garlic and onion, while easing off the quantity of the other toppings. I will keep trying, as I think this recipe will be a good one that people can customize to their own personal tastes. Thank you for sharing!

Loved it, but would modify a little next time. I omitted the salsa and sour cream. Next time, I would use a thinner layer of the bean paste and add some jalapenos for heat. Overall a great recipe.  Would make again!

This came out great.I omitted the olives and made my own crust. I also added hot sauce.Next time i will use a sharper cheddar andless green pepper.
