Good base flavors.  You can at least partially prevent the rock-hard freezing problem by adding alcohol (1 or 2 oz) to the mix before putting it in the machine.  Vodka won't add any taste, or you could add pear liquor, or a complementary flavor of some other kind.  Most all of my ice cream recipes have a little alcohol in them (since I rarely use enough fat or sugar to keep the creaminess level high), in the form of rum or vodka.  It works wonders.

Fabulous flavor!  I made mine with pears in light syrup, Splenda, and low sugar, fat-free yogurt.  I was very pleased with the results as were my guests.  Will definitely be making this again.

I used organic pears minus any juice, Stacy's organic vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup organic honey instead of sugar. What I did was blend it in my blender and froze it in a flat freezer container and when it firmed up, I scooped it back into the blender and re-ran it through. I froze these in dixie cups and when it was firm, I stuck popsicle sticks into them. The kids and I loved these and even my popsicle snob husband liked them. I can see how it reminds people of the holidays. It's a warm and comforting combination, even frozen!

Amazing!  My kids went crazy over this.  I used pears in their own juice and plain yogurt with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Even with those substitutions, I lowered the sugar to 1/4 cup.  It was still very sweet.  We don't have an ice cream maker, so we made the frozen yogurt in a bag.  I filled a plastic gallon bag half full of ice and added 1/2 cup rock salt.  I divided the yogurt mixture into three quart bags (I sometimes double bag to guard against leaks) and added them to the gallon bag.  Then, the kids and I wrapped the bag up in a towel and tossed it around for about ten minutes.  It was a fun activity for family night!

Thank you VERY much for sending in this recipe!  It was wonderful - a huge hit even with non-pear fans.  I added a smidge extra cinnamon and allspice.  It was so refreshing and so flavorful and unlike any ice cream or frozen yogurt I've ever had before - and it was super easy to make.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This was very tasty! However, it turned out kinda slushy upon finishing up in the maker and then of course, froze rock hard in the freezer.  Might have been not in the maker long enough.  But good nonetheless! :-)

I have made this MANY times and my family just loves it.  I prefer to use pears in natural juice and decrease the sugar.  This recipe was so good it made my mother-in-law go out and buy an ice cream maker!!

This is the BEST use for over ripe pears! I used 3 of them instead of tinned (sub apple juice for the liquid). Wonderful flavor with just the slightest tanginess, creamy and sweet. Besides the hint of pear flavor, the taste reminds me of apple pie. Be sure to let it ripen in the freezer, then let soften at room temp for a few minutes before scooping.

Light and refreshing dessert.  Easy and quick to prepare, but as others have said, it is best the first day because it freezes hard and loses its creamy texture.  I am excited to try this with other fruits - peaches would be great!

This is the best frozen yogurt I've ever had!  It's perfect for anyone who doesn't like the usual tang of frozen yogurt.  It was sweet and spicy and ooooooh so good!  

I didn't have allspice, so I added extra cinnamon.  Also, I bought the can of pear halves with less sugar (1/3 the sugar), and I still thought the frozen yogurt was plenty sweet and delicious.

This is so delicious and refreshing! Today I made it again and removed half of the mixture out of the ice-cream maker about half-way through the ice-cream making process. I put it in pop-cycle molds to make some frozen yogurt pop-cycles. MMMM

So delicious and creamy! But yeah, make this the DAY OF! That goes for pretty much anything made in an ice cream maker, the freezer just hardens the  out of it and it never has that creamy texture again.

Oh my goodness!  This is fantastic!  I made it with Splenda & fat free plain yogurt (come to think of it, I forgot to put vanilla in it like I'd planned).  The kids all loved it & so did we.  We doubled the recipe & ended up with only a tiny bit left over.  The flavor is excellent & intense.  The texture is creamy and smooth.  Everyone loved it, even my 19 y.o. son's friends who were here for a visit.

Absolutely wonderful! Lovely flavour, lovely texture. A little too sweet perhaps, but that may have been because of the pears that I used. I will most definately be making this again!

This is delicious!  Very spicy with a hint of vanilla and pear.  Definitely reminds me of the holidays, and I love the creaminess from the yogurt.  I don't do well with ice cream because of my lactose intolerance, but I can tolerate frozen yogurt.  I didn't have enough vanilla yogurt, but I used plain yogurt and added some vanilla extract to deal with that lack.  I added some vanilla vodka to the mix as another reviewer suggested.  I tried it tonight and it's the consistency of, although not the texture, of ice cream.  Very nice.  thanks for the recipe!

I love it when something this simple is so tasty! I made this with three fresh peaches, pureed with a little vanilla, about half the sugar, and non fat yogurt. I'm already working on other variations in my head. In playing with recipes - I'd advise that you keep it "healthy" with fruit based recipes. IE - adding one whole banana and fresh vanilla beans is excellent. However, sweeter additions - I tried peanut butter cups - seem to clash with the tart/sour flavor of the yogurt.

The flavor was really delicious. My problem is that it never set up. Was more like a slushy. I put it in the freezer for a while hoping it would firm up and it did but it just became a big chunk of ice. I'm not sure what happened I'll try it again sometime though because the taste was amazing.

Such an easy recipe compared to many others out there.  While it wasn't the best frozen yogurt I've ever had, I think it still rates a 5 for flavor and ease.  The texture was a bit gritty so use peaches if you don't love pears the way I do!

This has a very different, unusual flavor.  I wasn't sure that I liked it at first, but it really grew on me.  It was very easy to make, although the yogurt didn't get solid enough in the ice cream maker and had to be put in the freezer.  I might make this again and would recommend it to others who are looking for something a little different for dessert.

This was one of my favourite frozen yogurts.  It is easy, delicious and very refreshing, and would be excellent alongside homemade gingerbread.

This was okay. Pears are kind of gritty and so the second time I made it I used peaches and less cinnamon. It was much better. Eat this all up though because it's not as good after it's been in the freezer.

This is really delicious and super easy, but as others have said, it's only good the first day. After that, it freezes solid (despite my addition of an ounce of alcohol as suggested).

I really love this recipe!  I did leave out the allspice and only used the cinnamon.  It is so smooth and refreshing.  It's flavor is very different, yet very pleasing!

This is really yummy, but the freezing rock solid that everyone is commenting on is because there is no alcohol in the blend and alcohol keeps the mixture soft.  I used plain yogurt, and added 1.5 T vanilla extract (that's the alcohol) with 2 T honey instead of the vanilla yogurt.  The result was creamy and scoopable, even two days later.

This was such a unique twist on a frozen treat! I didn't have allspice so I used a tad more cinnamon. I also did not add sugar because I figured the juice from the pears was sweet enough. Next time I will make this from scratch, boiling pears and using honey as a sweetener.
