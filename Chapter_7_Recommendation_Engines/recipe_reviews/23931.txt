These were great!  OK - I never follow a recipe exactly... I added a TABLEspoon of Worcestershire and several dashes of hot sauce, as well as increasing the flour to almost a full cup because we're at HIGH ALTITUDE.  I rolled the dough onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet, which I think probably better keeps the crackers from sticking.  I highly recommend rolling out the dough until it is VERY THIN, otherwise the squares come out like thin cornbread with only the corners getting crispy.  Be sure to separate the cracker squares on the baking sheet.  This is a recipe I will use again - next time making the squares a bit more "fancy," perhaps piercing a design on the dough (before cutting) using the tines of a fork or some other decoration.  I served the crackers with the Vegan Black Bean Soup (5 Star, Top 10 Vegetarian Recipe) - a "SOUPER" combination!

This recipe is not a true cracker, as it does not contain enough flour to make the leavening work. (In addition, baking powder should have been used instead of baking soda, because without acid in the recipe, baking soda doesn't work.) What you get are completely flat, dense, basically unleavened cornmeal slices. They are actually very edible, but only because plain toasted cornmeal is not too bad. This recipe seriously needs improvement.

Very good, I love the flavor.  For some reason, the dough didn't come together enough to form a ball.  I didn't want to spoil the proportions so instead of rolling the dough out I used a spatula and spread it out on the parchment paper so thin you could almost see through it then cut my crackers with a pizza cutter.  I sprayed the dough with a light mist of canola oil and baked as directed and wound up with 84 crispy little jewels.

I really have no idea what people have against these crackers, and they are crackers.  You can go into the store and buy bran crackers that have the exact same texture as these do, only these are probably better for you.  They're simple but tasty.  I did however have to add a little extra flour in order to make them kneadable.  In a second batch, I added some seasonings (garlic powder and onion powder), and they were very tasty.

I really wanted this to work...I truly did. I did everything exactly the way the recipe said. They were rolled paper thin. The first batch tasted like dog biscuits. The next batch, I tried seasoning them with salt and then misting them with lime juice and soy sauce...they still tasted like dog biscuits. The third and final batch, I did all of the above and added one of my favorite seasoning blends....they STILL tasted like dog biscuits. How are these supposed to be like corn chips???? That is just not possible. Was something left out of the recipe perhaps?  This recipe needs som MAJOR help. This was a waste of time.

Mini crispy cornbreads!  These are great crackers for dips and spreads.  I like the flavor and the texture!  We will be making these again!

My husband really liked this and they were fairly easy to make.  I had to add some extra flour to make it pull together, but the result was a nice dry cracker with a mild flavor.  On the second dough ball I worked in some garlic and onion powder and it was even better.

I have been looking for inexpensive crackers for the snacks in my children's lunches for quite a while. These crackers are just what I am after! I had only tried a half-batch, and I think that only makes about 4 servings, not 8. Taste? - even my picky eater thought these were bland. I am going to keep this recipe, but I will add more of each flavoring. Finally I have a recipe for that chili oil my kids gave me for Christmas!

Great recipe, just not my taste.  I did add more flour & roll them very thin, as another person suggested & that seemed to make it more cracker like.  Great texture & crunch too!

My dough came out too soft.  After a flour adjustment I thought these were wonderful!  Especially with homemade salsa.  Of course I added more worcestire and hot sauce.  Especially hot sauce,

I made two batches of these for a Christmas get-together over the weekend and they were a HUGE hit!!!  Easier to make than my Christmas cookies and fit right into my baking agenda with ease.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!!
