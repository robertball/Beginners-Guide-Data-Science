I made these cute little guys for my daughter's preschool Christmas party.  They were a huge hit.  They are a little time consuming, but are worth the effort for a special children's cookie.  I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and put a mini-m&m (red or green) for a nose.  I also gave them a little Christmas holly bow by their ears with holiday sprinkles.  Be careful if baked too long they tend to crack.

I love this recipe!  I made these adorable mice for a Christmas party I had, and people enjoyed them so much my husband requested to take a batch to his Xmas potluck!  They tasted delicious too.  I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes, per a previous suggestion, but I was thinking, sprinkles for eyes and a mini choc chip for the nose would probably be cute too!  These are great, just a little time consuming, but worth it!  I did have to cook them a little longer than the recipe stated though.

I made these for a cookie exchange as well and everyone thought they were really cute.  I used black licorice instead of red, and little silver ball candies for the eyes.  The only problem I found were that they spread quite a bit when I baked them, and looked more like flat cookies than puffy little mice.  Still, they were really yummie :)

These are really cute.  I used almond slices for the ears.  I think I like these better than peanuts because the ears are bigger.  They are more fragile with the almonds.  I also used black licorice wheels by Haribo for the tail.  This worked well because they are wound-up so the tails curled well.  Next time I will shape them into balls before the chill time.  I lost patience with how long it was taking to mold the chilled dough and I think the chill is important to keep them from flattening out.  My kids reminded me of another fun Christmas mouse I made...you take a marachino cherry that has the stem on and dip it in chocolate.  Then take a Hershey kiss and lay both on their sides on waxed paper as you touch the bottom of the kiss to the bottom of the cherry.  The point of the kiss is the nose and the stem of the cherry is the tail.  Then quickly slip two almond slices in between the kiss and cherry as ears (with the rounded part up).  Allow chocolate to dry and then come back later and make eyes with a toothpick, using royal icing, melted white chocolte, or even the frosting you can buy in a tube.  Remember the ears are kinda fragile.  My dad loves these because he is a big chocolate cherry fan!!  Thanks for posting the peanut butter Christmas mice.  They are more old fashioned looking than the cherry mice and I was looking for an old fashioned Christmas this year!

SOOO Cute.  Made these for my Christmas cookie boxes and everyone is still talking about them.  I also decorated them with mini candy holly leaves, just at the base of one "peanut half ear".

These are very cute, great alternative to plain old peanut butter cookies.  I brought them to a cookie exchange and everyone thought they were a very cute idea.  They did take a little longer then expected, because of forming them into the little mouse shape and putting the eyes and ears on each one.  I also substituted mini chocolate chips for the eyes.  HAVE FUN!!

These are great!  I found that they spread a little, so be sure to follow the recipe and make the backs of the mice tall instead of flattening them out too much.  They will flatten to a normal shape as they bake.  I found the licorice a little frustrating, too. The cookies cool pretty fast and the licorice doesn't like to go in very far.  Maybe I'm just putting them down too low on the rear?

These are SO CUTE! I made them for a cookie exchange and of course they were the hit of the party. I made a double batch so it took some time, but they are so worth it. Even my 12 year old son said he was proud of them. Will definitely make them again...over and over.

Very time consuming but worth the effort.  The dough was very crumbly and I had to squeeze it to make it work.  I apparently didn't make the backs pointed enough because I ended up with flat mice.  I used Reese's Pieces for the eyes, almond slivers for the ears, and pull and peel Twizzler's for the tails.  The kids loved these.

Time consuming but fun cookies!  I used crunchy pb, sliced almonds for the ears, mini chocolate chips for the eyes & caramel for the tails.  I roughly formed the mouse shape with an oval Tbsp BEFORE I refrigerated the dough which I think helped a lot since the dough became a little crumbly once chilled.  The caramel worked great for the tails!  I just cut individually wrapped caramels in half, then rolled them between my palms to make a rope shape.  I stuck the tail in the warm cookie & it melted a little, keeping it in place.  Next time I'd use a different candy for the eyes -the chocolate melted & was messy.  Overall great taste & presentation!

Needed something "fun" for a baking class and these were it.  The youngest was six and the oldest was nine.  We had a blast.   Skipped cooling part as time was in short hand.  The mice turned out well but flattened a tad.  Used sliced almonds for ears, mini chocolate chips for eyes and licorice--(what a pain).
An older boy mentioned that, "I can't believe the kids made these, this is probably the best snack they've made so far."

These are cute but VERY time consuming and difficult to work with.  The tails are challenging and the dough does not hold together very well for molding.  They do taste quite good though.

These were easy to make and tasted okay.  They seemed a little dry.  Maybe more peanut butter would make them better.

I made these for a community event next weekend so I haven't tasted them yet.  I will add reactions afterwards.  Regardless they are the cutest things!

Time consuming but cute Recommend putting dough in frig for about an hour. Makes it easier to work with (mold)

I just finished making these. They turned out great! I made sure the dough was completely chilled before I baked them and they didn't spread out much. Since I had to use what I had, I used red ball sprinkles as noses and green jimmies as eyes. For the ears I used chocolate chips stuck on with white chocolate after baking and white chocolate swirled tails. :)

I make them but I don't put the tail on them. My kids don't like that type of candy. But you can add sprinkles and make some look like girls. Have fun and add they cutie stuff your kids would like.
