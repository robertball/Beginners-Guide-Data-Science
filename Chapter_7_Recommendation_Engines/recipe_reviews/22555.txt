The chocolate part was kind of bland, but it was a nice compliment to the apples.  Pretty quick, easy, and tasty--I'll definitely make it again.

I didn't like it much but my husband and kid did, so...I think it's thin and only moist where the apple is, they say it's simple and light.I'll try a smaller pan.
