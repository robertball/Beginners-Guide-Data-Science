Gosh this was good.  My issue with most sweet potato soup is they are overly sweet... this one is not. The 5 spice powder adds a really nice flavor  to this and balances the sweetens well. Will make again

Given the end result, you would never guess the simplicity of this delicious soup.  My husband deemed it "high end restaurant quality."  It has the just right balance of savory and sweet, and was a perfect dish for the first day of Autumn.
