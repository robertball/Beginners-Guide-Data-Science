This salsa was so good! To tone down the spice for the kids however add a little salt.  I was extremely surprised with the complex taste of such a terribly simple salsa to make. I am going to jar this to give to friends and family!

This salsa turned out pretty good, although I ended up with salsa paste.  Next time, I think I'll watch how long I leave it in the blender!  It does taste better after it's been in the fridge for a while, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been searching for a salsa recipe that is easy to prepare and is the consistency of those served in my favorite restaurants. This is it!! Mine too thickened overnight but I just added some V-8 juice to it. This one is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This salsa had a thick pasty texture after having been refrigerated and a little too overpowered with onion.  I love all kinds of salsa but would not recommend this recipe.

My son Steve used this recipe for a sixth grade math project, and we made it for his class. It was a huge hit! He snipped off the cilantro leaves to measure 1/4 cup rather than use an entire bunch, and we found it to be just the right amount. No need to mince the cilantro or dice the onion since the blender does all the work for you.

If this was a recipe for ketchup then I would say it was pretty good, but as for salsa, it was bland, like eating a can of stewed tomatoes, pureed.  Here's what I added to make it edible, 4 dried chiles de arbol, three cloves garlic, cumin, salt, mexican oregano, paprika, coriander and a pinch of pepper,hit the puree button.    It still didn't work on chips, but I hated to throw it away after all the work so I used it in place of enchilada sauce with some leftover shredded turkey, threw some cheese and crushed chips on the top and it was a pretty tasty weeknight casserole.

As it is, I would rate this recipe with four stars. But, I think with just a little modification it could easily be five! Like other reviewers, I found this to be too thick. I think in the future I will not drain any of the canned tomatoes and green chiles and this may help. Also, I think I'll not blend half the onion coarsely chopped and two cans of the tomatoes and chiles to leave it a little chunky. But the flavor is VERY good!

Delicious!  I have been searching for a salsa recipe just like this.  Next time I will chop the onion instead of blend it up to make it chunkier.  I will definately make this over and over.

Good base but was a little bit bland; added chopped onion,  cumin, garlic powder, salt, white pepper and lemon juice to taste. (It's easy to add too much cumin so go lightly with it. )

This is the only salsa I make any more. This is better than anything we have ever tried. I does set up a bit, but just stir it and it's fine. I love the combination of flavors and how easy it is to make.

This was okay, but didn't really stand out. I made it exactly as written; it made two blenders full. I did take some to a meeting, and a few people said they liked it. Personally, even though I do like cilantro, I found this to be a bit too heavy on the cilantro flavor; I guess I like more tomatoes and onions, and garlic would have been nice too.

I love salsa, and this was so quick and easy to make. The can of tomato paste gives a nice wee bit of sweetness to this salsa. I did add in some pickled jalapenos and a couple dashes of garlic powder. Tasted like the salsa they serve at the Mexican restaurants. Great recipe for a quick salsa snack.
