This is officially on our Thanksgiving menu!!! Too easy and delicious to pass up. I used the large toothed plate on my spiralizer, so the ribbons were pretty thick. They took a bit longer to cook than written.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love a sweet potato, and this was a different way to prepare it. I had this for dinner, as I was at a Sunday brunch earlier. I would never put 1/4 cup of butter on a sweet potato if I had it another way, so I just reduced it to a tblsp, just to get an idea how it turns out. I did not have the sage leaves, so just used a sprinkling of dried sage. It takes on a smoky, almost crisp, burnt-like flavor, and I really liked that. It does need  the salt, too. Nice light and healthy dish for a hot, last day of summer dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Bomb. I was looking for a way to use up the Sweet Potato Ribbons I got from Trader Joes... This was easy and delicious. Probably not the healthiest considering the amount of butter, but oh well!
