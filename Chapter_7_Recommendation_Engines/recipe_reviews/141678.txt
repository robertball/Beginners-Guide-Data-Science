Here's the deal folks!  Most would agree that using a pork tenderloin for pulled pork is not a good idea.  Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor!  I used a 4 pound shoulder cut (also called Boston butt).  It was only $5, whereas a 2 pound cut of tenderloin was $10!  I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours, pulled it apart and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy sauce, and then cooked for another hour.  I served them on Kaiser rolls with coleslaw and homemade fries from this site.  Amazing!!

This was so easy to make and the results were amazing. I followed the recipe only adding a couple of things. Before placing the tenderloin in the slow cooker, I rubber salt, pepper, and garlic salt on it. I then used a fork to poke holes in the tenderloin so the juices could be soaked up. I added the root beer and let it cook on low for 5 1/2-6 hours. I then drained and pulled the pork apart easily with a fork. I returned the pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and let it continue to cook on low for another 1-1 1/2 hours. It was so good and and my husband loved it.

I was looking for something I could cook in the crock pot on a very busy day.  I was tired of the usual pot roast, and we have chicken all the time so,the idea of pulled pork occured to me.  I tweaked this reciped just a bit and the result was really good!  I knew a 2 lb tenderloin would never be enough for my family of 6, so on the advice of the butcher at my grocery store, I used a 4 lb shoulder (it had a small bone in it, but it slid out easily after cooking on low for 10 hours.  I mixed 1/2 cup of Bull's Eye Original Barbeque sauce with 2 cups of root beer then poured it over the roast, sprinkled it with a generous amount of dried minced onion, then drizzled some additional barbeque sauce over the roast.  Halfway through cooking, I turned the roast over, added more minced onions and another drizzle of sauce.  After 10 hours in the crock, I removed the roast, let cool slightly and then shredded it.  I mixed in the rest of the barbeque sauce, some salt and a little water to moisten it and served it on a bun. The result was a restuarant quality pulled pork sandwich that my whole family enjoyed!  I will definitely be making this again!

WOW!!  This is SO GOOD!  I have to admit, when my friend first told me about "Root Beer" pork, I was skeptical.  Then she told me that her chef fiance loved it, so I decided that was a good reason to give it a try.  I'm SO glad I did!  I cooked it in just root beer for 6 hours, then drained it and cooked it in the BBQ sauce for an hour.  When I tasted it, it MELTED in my mouth!  It is SO GOOD!!!  Plus it was super easy!  Highly recommended!!

FANTASTIC!

I had gone to "Log Cabin BBQ" the last night, which inspired me to try to make pulled pork sandwiches myself.

This one blows Log Cabin BBQ out of the water!  I used a 6 pound pork shoulder and filled up my slow cooker with root beer to cover the meat.  Left it in for about 10 hours.  It was so tender and juicy, I could barely take it out of the slow cooker!

The best thing is--7 pounds of pork shoulder was only about $10!!!!

The means you can make enough pulled pork sandwiches to feed about 30 people for about $15-20!!  And they will be raving about it!

Extra points for ease, too!

Thought this was good, but not too much different than what I usually make.  I typically use pork butt or shoulder and cook it with a cup of water, shredding and adding the bbq sauce at the end.  I like the idea in this recipe of using pork tenderloin - it's a lot less fatty and very easy to shred/pull, although you may sacrifice some flavor using a leaner cut like this.  As for the rootbeer - it didn't seem to noticeably enhance the flavor of this dish for me.  In all fairness though, I did have a cold, so maybe that had something to do with it!  The rootbeer did however make for a messy crockpot when it came to clean up as the sugar caramelized on the side of the pot and was really tough to scrub off.  I'd recommend either using cooking spray on the sides of the crockpot, or trying a pan liner made for crockpots.  If like me you have trouble getting it clean - try scrubbing with your fingers using a paste made from Bon Ami.  Worked for me!

I appreciate folks who review the recipe when they have used the original ingredients.  What I don't appreciate, is someone who posts and completely changed ingredients.  Why not post as an entirely different recipe.  This was great as is.  It will vary, depending on what barbecue sauce you use.

This is a GREAT recipe for a sweet southern type pork unlike the strong underlying flavor of vinegar favored by the East coast or the mustard based sauces of South Carolina/ Georgia.  With that being said if you are a traditionalist of a geographic region, this is probably NOT the recipe for you unless you like the sweeter sauces of Tennessee.  Experience imparts using a pork tenderloin will provide a drier meat, however using something will a little more fat such as a shoulder or butt will impart more flavor.  The main tip for this recipe is to ensure your meat is covered with liquid, or turn it every few hours.  Mixed with Sweet Baby Rays, Sweet and Spicy sauce to help counter the sweetness of the root beer and cooked for 1 hour longer to absorb the sauce into the meat.  Served on onion rolls with a sprinkling of French's French Fried Onion Rings on the meat and a side of apple coleslaw (from this site) for a quick dinner.  5 stars for a truly easy, no fuss, no muss recipe.

Very very good. I used a pork shoulder roast. I soaked it in the rootbeer overnight. We love Sweet Baby Rays Brown Sugar and Hickory sauce. I couldn't keep the kids from eating it before dinner. I will be making this again for sure. Would be great to serve to a crowd.

Rootbeer?!?  Seriously?!?  That was my first response - I too went for the boston butt over the tenderloin - 4lbs for 1/2 the price of a 2lb tenderloin was enticing and, yes, I was skeptical - I jabbed the chunk of pork a few times with a fork left all the fat on it, tossed it in my big crockpot and covered it with a 2L bottle of 99c A&W Rootbeer (total cost, about $9.50) - set it on low for 7 hours and went to work...  Came home for lunch, rolled the meat at 4 hours and went back to work...   came home, and found the CP on "keep warm" - I dumped the liquid fat and rootbeer, pulled the bone, forked the meat apart and dumped a 23oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce into the pot and set it back to low for 1hr - the result was about 3.5 lbs of the best pulled pork my family has tasted - this could have served 10 people but there is less than half left!!!   I saw this recipe pop in a "Superbowl Main Course" survey today (after I made it) - Shoot yeah, this is Superbowl food!!!  I sampled the pork after the rootbeer bath and it already was great - I loved the raw sweetness the RB provided to the exterior and it was super tender and moist....  Winner Winner, Pork dinner....

I love this recipe, however, I have found that it is much easier to cook on low for 10 hours and turn the slow cooker on before I go to bed the night BEFORE we want it.  The next morning, I take a fork and everything falls a part on its own.  I add more BBQ sauce, stir and place the crock pot in the fridge and off to work I go.  When I get home, I pull the crock pot out, turn it back on high for 2 hours and serve....Letting it sit all day allows for the sauce to soak up into the pork.

Very tasty - easy recipe. I marinated the pork loin in a wet rub made with dry onion soup mix with fresh garlic, Montreal steak spice, pepper and worcesteshire sauce. I served the pulled pork on whole wheat buns with coleslaw. Chances are, I'll make this one again.

This was definitely a great recipe, but I have to give it only 4 stars. Using pork tenderloin for pulled pork is like using beef tenderloin for meatloaf - the basic idea is right but overkill.  Pork shoulder roast or a picnic cut is better.  Really any cheaper cut of higher fat pork will work better than tenderloin.  All that being said, the tenderloin does work and provides a low fat, but more dry pulled pork.  I've also used Dr. Pepper, added sliced sweet onion, 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar and 1 t. red pepper flakes.  Adds a little zing to the sweet. It's been my experience that the pork comes out better cooked on LO for the entire time.  If you have to shorten your cooking time and use HI, be sure that all of the meat is covered with liquid and place the onion under the pork to avoid burning or overcooking.

I recently got back from Memphis, TN on a business trip.  After going to "The B-B-Q Shop" and having a great pulled pork sandwich, I decided that I'd make some pulled pork and see how it compared.  I started off with a 2.5 pound pork tenderloin which I trimmed only a little of the surface fat from.  I then poked holes on it and cut it into four pieces to better lay in my 6 quart cooker.  I seasoned it with fresh ground pepper on all sides, kosher salt, and some garlic powder.  I topped with some crushed red pepper flakes and let it stand for about 10 minutes.  I chopped up a red onion and took only three center discs and laid them on the bottom of my cooker.  I put the meat on top and poured in two cans of A&W Rootbeer.  I cooked the pork on low for a little over six hours, and when I could hardly get it out of the cooker it was so tender.  Two forks made quick work of the meat.  I cleaned the cooker and put the meat back in with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce.  I cook it for another hour on low, mixing it a couple of times during cooking.  I buttered sandwich rolls, with a sprinkle of onion powder, then toasted them.  Once they came out I put a fresh slice of pepper jack cheese and then loaded them up with pork.  For topping I had the original sauce and the sweet and spicy variation.  These were AWESOME.  Very simple recipe, great results.  I think the seasoning does help as I don't like plain food.   I'm stuffed, can't wait for left overs!

Hint for removing stuck-on foods from crockpot--put a fabric softenr sheet in the empty crockpot, fill with HOT WATER and let it sit for an hour or two. Works for me every time!  GREAT RECIPE--use boston butt instead of tenderloin..

Very basic, so I used this as "inspiration".  As others said, use a pork shoulder roast rather than tenderloin - it's much cheaper.  I also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and seared the roast before putting it in the slow cooker, covered it with root beer, added a bit of hot chipotle BBQ sauce and a dried piri-piri pepper.

Do NOT throw out the liquid when the roast is cooked!  That stuff holds so much flavour, it's a shame to waste it.  Instead, ladle it out into a pot and reduce it to a thick sauce, adjust flavour as needed, and pour as much back onto the shredded meat as you like - less for a dryer pulled pork, more for saucier.  Sweet, spicy, and full of pork flavour!

I didn't have 8 hours, so I cooked a 3 lb shoulder roast in the oven, covered, with 2 cups Rootbeer, and cooked it at 350 for 4 hrs. The entire roast was INFUSED with rootbeer (adding a wonderful sweetness, almost candied flavor to it). I then decided to make my ROOTBEER BBQ SAUCE with it! It's soooo good and if you are looking to serve a new flavor of pulled pork sandwich, TRY IT!   COMBINE ALL INTO SAUCEPOT & SIMMER FOR 20+ MINUTES.*I sometimes have to add cornstarch/water to thicken this, as it's originally for BBQ Ribs* •1 cup root beer •1 cup ketchup •1/2 cup orange juice •3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce •2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice •2 tablespoons brown sugar •1 tablespoon honey •1 clove garlic, minced •1/2 teaspoon lemon zest •1/2 teaspoon onion powder •1/2 teaspoon ground ginger •1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper •salt

I thought this recipe was easy and great! I did the following modifications to spice it up a little: 
1) I used a pork shoulder based on the suggestion of other reviewers 
2) The night before cooking I washed my pork shoulder in cold water and poked several holes in it with a fork. I then rubbed 1 package of McCormick® Slow Cookers BBQ Pulled Pork Seasoning on it and wrapped it in saran wrap and put it in the refrigerator overnight. 
3) Before putting the pork shoulder in the crockpot the following morning I quartered an onion and used it to line the bottom of the crock pot. 
4) I smeared a little bbq sauce on the pork shoulder and then placed it on top of the onions and used an entire 2 litter of rootbeer to cover my pork (I have an oval crock pot so it took a lot). I read in several reviews that stated covering the pork with rootbeer was important. 
5) I cooked the pork on low for 8 hours (flipping it 2 -3 times while cooking). 
6) After the pork was was cooked I completely emptied the crockpot and let the pork rest under a foil tent for 30 minutes. 
7) I then shredded the pork and tossed it in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and placed it back in the crockpot on low for another hour. 
The result was fabulous pulled pork!!!! I did not think it tasted or smelled like rootbeer (the thought/ smell of rootbeer makes me sick so I was very worried to say the least!). I would highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again!

I made this for our Super Bowl Party and it came out amazing! I admit I was a little skeptical about using the root beer...but boy was I wrong!  I used pork butt, per the advice of my butcher and couldn't have been happier with results. I put the meat in the slow cooker and poured the root beer over (using about 1 liter) and left it to cook on low overnight. When I woke up in the morning, I took the pork out and shredded it. Although not much effort was required, since it was pretty much falling apart! What was great about the pork butt was that there was barely any fat at all! I drained the root beer from the slow cooker and returned the shredded meat, added barbeque sauce that I had made, and cooked on low for another 4 hrs or so.  The meat was amazing...so tender and flavorful. Served on kaiser rolls with homemade coleslaw on the side. Everyone at the party loved it. This recipe is definitely a keeper! My husband is already asking when I will be making it again.

We love this recipe. I layer onions in the bottom of my crockpot before adding the meat. I also sear the meat before adding it into the crockpot. I like to make coleslaw with this and make a big ol' sandwich filled with coleslaw and pulled pork. The leftovers are even better the day after.

I've made this 3 times now because it's sooo good and easy. The root beer is essential and ingenius!! However, I disagree with others' suggestions to use cheaper, larger cuts of pork. I made this twice with tenderloin and it fell apart easily with the forks when I went to shred it. But I tried a large pork shoulder today, and I'll never do that again. It was tough, and super fatty. It required so much work to cut the fat off and shredding it was very difficult. It took much more time than the tenderloin, which cooks very quickly, about 2 hours or less, but is still very tender and flavorful. I added crushed red pepper to make it spicier, and I nearly doubled the BBQ sauce because I love BBQ sauce. Definitely be prepared to add lots more sauce after you shred the meat. I've made this with chicken too, but it's way better with pork tenderloin. I put the buns under the broiler for a few seconds - watch them closely. The toasted buns are essential, in my book. Happy to have found this recipe!

Ok, so I read all these great reviews about this recipe but I have to admitt that I was a little concerned about pouring Root Beer all over the meat but it was very tasty! I took others advice and used a 3lb pork shoulder, I rubbed some Mrs. Dash on the meat. I put it in my crok pot, poured A&W root beer on it and cooked it for 8 hours on low. When it was finished it was so tender and juicy. Shredding it was a breeze. I also used Sweet baby Rays' BBQ sauce which I had never tried and it was also very good. I had to write a review because all the others were a big part of why I tried this. I recommend it. The meat did not taste of Root Beer at all!!

I didn't think it was anything special.  Followed the recipe exactly and while it wasn't disgusting, I've had much better.

Best Pulled Pork Ever! 
Used a Boston Pork Butt  as others had suggested just over 4 lbs . seasoned the meat with Ms Dash Garlic and Herb ... placed the meat in a 6 qt crock ..... cut a large onion into larger chunks and placed around meat . poured a 64 once bottle of Non Diet Root Beer in the crock along with 2 Teaspoons of liquid smoke .. cooked for almost 10 hours on low .... removed the meat and placed in a colander so the root beer had a chance to drain  .... and after emptying the crock of the onion and root beer and wiping with a paper towel put the meat back in and  shredded it in the crock (it almost fell apart).....  in a sauce pan where i had diced a medium onion finely and about half of a sweet bell pepper.... i gently softened the onion and pepper and add a 28 oz. bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and mixed with the onions and peppers ..... then poured over the meat and mixed it in ..... cooked on low for another 90 min and served on toasted Buns  .
If you want a little kick to it take a fresh Jalapeno pepper diced finely  and add with the the BBQ sauce.
Draining the meat I had No Root Beer Flavor as other had sugessted and this is as Good a Pulled Pork as I have ever Had.
The onions and peppers are just preference and adjust the amount of BBQ sauce to your liking .
Try it you..... Will Not be Disappointed

So many of these reviews just raved about this recipe and yet there were a few that complained about the "root beer" taste in the meat.  I was convinced those few were just crazy... well, they were right!  (Hear me out!)  When you take the roast out to drain the root beer and pull the meat, you can most definitely taste the root beer. However, if you follow the directions and suggestions from others, put the meat back in the crockpot mixed with the BBQ sauce for an hour or so.  After that you will not  taste the root beer.  You get a very tender and flavorful pork sandwich.  Do not use tenderloin, a waste of good meat.  I used a 4.5 lb pork roast on sale (the one with a bone) and a bottle of good ole K-C Masterpiece sauce.  With some toasted buns and pinto beans, you got yourself a down home meal.  Thanks, we really loved it!

I made this for my daughter's 5th birthday party.  It was so easy to prepare! Her party was at 3:00.  I used a 3.5 lbs. pork tenderloin, a whole onion chopped, and a cup and a half of root beer.  I seasoned the meat on both sides with a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic power, and onion powder.  I put the meat, root beer and onion in the crock pot at 8:00am.  Every hour I would turn the meat over just so that each side would benefit from the marinade.  At 2:00pm, I pulled out the pork loin and drained the root beer in a colander.  That left the soaked onions which I put back in the crock pot with the pork.  I, then, pulled the meat and lightly chopped it.  I poured an 18 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and then cooked it for an additional hour.  It came out absolutely wonderful. We will definitely be making this again!

This is one of the easiest dishes I have ever made.  I followed others' suggestions and used a 6 lb. boston butt instead of the tenderloin.  I seasoned my meat with what I had in the cabinet, and I used 2/3 of a 2 liter Barq's to cover the meat.  After about 10 hours on low, it was falling to pieces!  I added a large bottle of "Sweet Baby Ray's" sauce, some more spices, and that was it.  It got rave reviews, and several people told me that it was better than what they have gotten in restaurants.  I will definitely make this again.

EASY and delicious...it is no wonder why this recipe rates top in 2010. I have made this recipe a dozen times and have passed along the recipe. There is a similar recipe in Allrecipe that calls for beef broth, and I liked it, but something seemed "off" which I now realize beef & pork don't mix. Like other reviews DO NOT use pork tenderloin as that is a very expensive cut of meat. I find 1/2 pork loins on sale for about $1.50 which have no bones & barely no fat. Once the meat is cooked I only have to slice off the top fat, then shred. I pour off the juice into a measuring cup; add the meat to the crockpot, add the bbq sauce and then add any "juice" as needed. YUMMY>

This was so good!!  I made this tonight for company (I doubled the recipe) and everyone raved.  I think it's important to note that the root beer does not flavor the dish.  It is used only to tenderize the meat. The flavor comes solely from the meat and the barbecue sauce.  Those reviewers who claimed that this recipe was too sweet may have forgotten to drain the root beer before adding the barbecue sauce, or perhaps used a barbecue sauce that was too sweet.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce (our family's favorite) and it was fantastic!

This gets 10 stars!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception:  After 6 hours, when you take the meat out of the root beer, **let it rest** for 5 minutes before shredding it!  I did so under a foil tent.  This will allow the juices to redistribute!  Then, I shredded it with a fork, returned it to the crock pot (after draining the Saranac root beer), added Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ Sauce, and let it cook for the remaining hour.  Used 2 lb pork tenderloin because I like a healthier cut of meat.  SOOO Good, will definitely make many, many more times!

It was good. Used a large pork roast(prob about 5 pounds or so..we are a large family)poured a bottle and half of rootbeer over it. Was a little worried about how it would taste from the way it smelled when I drained it but it tasted better than I expected ..shredded pretty good added a big bottle of KC Masterpiece and served on ciabatta rolls with provolone melted on. Also made the Sweet Restaurant Slaw from the site to go with as a side! Great meal and not a lot of work!

this recipe is fantastic.... the only change i made was to add some salt and pepper to enhance the flavor.  If you want to make a great meal that everybody will enjoy- without a lot of dishes or strange ingredients- then this is the recipe for you.  This is a keeper!!  I served mine with slaw and baked beans.  So easy, so delicious!

Wonderful!!!! I just made this last week. Pork roast was on sale for .99/lb. and decided to try it using a 4 lb. roast. I used 2 bottles of IBC root beer to cook it in. I did pierce the meat then pour the root beer over. It worked great. I cooked it on low for 8 hrs. and it fell apart. I drained the juice and then shredded and cooked another hour with  BBQ sauce. Nex time I am going to use Sprecher root beer and see if the sweeter root beer makes any difference. Thanks for a quick, easy and very tasty recipe!  :)

Just wanted to say "Folks", it's hard to get a good review when people are reviewing their own personal variations instead of the recipe they "didn't" actually make.  Haven't tried this yet Livie but am looking forward to it.  Sounds amazing!

I converted this recipe to cook in the oven. Cooked a 13.5 lb "Boston Butt" and of course it wouldn't fit in a slow cooker. Thanks to all who gave suggestions on oven temp. End result: used 6 cans of rootbeer, cooked 6 hours at 300 deg. in oven, drained, pulled apart and covered with Krafts Hickory Smoked BBQ sauce, which I heated first and added about 4-6 oz. of Burbon (to taste). Tossed and let cool in two alum. 1/2 pans. Ref. over nite and put in oven next day at 300 deg. for two hours to heat. Served to our friends as we watched the Eagles Beat the Giants! What a game, and I didn't have to spend the day in the kitchen cooking. Everything was done the day before, and everyone raved over how moist the pork was. Excellent Recipe. Go  Eagles!

This turned out tasting like I poured root beer all over dinner. Maybe if I used a spicier sauce to help balance the sweetness, this might be edible.

This is my favorite barbecued pork recipe.  I make exactly as written, use "Sweet Baby Ray"'s sauce and it's great.  Only thing I do different is I take tenderloin out when thru and cut up in about 2 inch slices before pulling apart.  Otherwise the "strings" are way too long.  Super easy, super good, what more could you ask for?

Regular dark beer works so much better than root beer.  And as countless others have note pork tenderloin is way too lean a cut of meat for slow cooking.  The point of slow cooking in a liquid such as beer is to break down the tougher connective tissue of tougher cuts of meat.

I had never purchased, let alone prepared, a pork roast. I am glad that I read the reviews. I bought a 5-6 pound "shoulder cut" (which was about $10) and cooked it on high in the crock pot for 3 hours, then turned it down to low for another 5 hours, with a bottle of Barq's. I spooned the meat out on to a plate (it was so tender it was falling apart), emptied and rinsed the crock pot, shredded the pork back into the crock pot, and poured a HALF RECIPE of Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce (from Allrecipes) on top and lightly mixed it in. And let it simmer on low in the crock pot for another 90 minutes. The result was something my husband and kids went CRAZY over. My husband said it's the best pulled pork he's EVER had. We only eat meat about twice a month, but I definitely think this will be going into the rotation. I served it with Ramen Coleslaw (also from AR) and stir-fried zucchini and crookneck squash from the garden. Delicious dinner!

Mmm...mmm...mmm GREAT!!! Used a boneless pork butt roast which I rubbed w/ salt & pepper, then quick seared in a hot cast iron skillet (not necessary prob., just habit!) prior to throwing in the crock pot w/ root beer, 2 cloves of chopped garlic & a sliced onion. For our tastes, I shredded the meat & returned it to the slow cooker with some of the juices (fat removed) & just served warmed Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce on the side, then topped the sammies with cole slaw ("Sweet Restaraunt Slaw" from this site, using mayo)...delish! Gonna be the star dish on 4th of July!!!

Pulled Pork is kinda a "No Brainer", with the most attention needing to be payed to the marinade (Slow Cooker Ingredients, liquid).  ANY additional spices, colas, beers, that are added to this slow cooking "broth" will add to the eventual overall flavor.  I myself prefer the "Pork Butt" as the cut of meat instead of a pork loin or tenderloin, as it is LESS EXPENSIVE, and has a bit more fat on it!  (More flavor)  The cherry on top, is after the pull, the SAUCE used.  Mmmmmmmm, I use a home made BBQ sauce in mine, ranging from a vinegar base, to a brown sugar base, depending on my mood.  Either way, don't think you can go wrong.  If your a little more dollar conscience, use a Pork Butt, and save the rest for your HOME MADE SAUCE!!!

I wish I could rate this 10 stars!!! This was delicious and fabulous. I used a pork tenderloin that was almost 3 pounds, so I used 2 cans of Birch Beer, and used 2 Tablespoons of Montreal Steak seasoning. Let that simmer 6 hours, then I shredded the pork, drained most of the birch beer off, then added 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, original and honey. I was told this was the best pulled pork anyone has ever had, this will be made very often, thanks for sharing this wonderful, easy recipe (:

I made this recipe for friends who came for "Happy Hour" supper.  It was awesome.  I was advised by my butcher to buy "Polish Pork Butt,"  was a bit skeptical about the amount of fat.  The fat absolutely makes for a moister result, and there's no reason to pay the extra for the tenderloin!!  The meat absolutely fell away from the fat without any carving or problems at all!  I took the left-overs to work for my coworkers, and they all wanted the recipe!  This will be my go-to for simple, simple, simple rave-review recipe!!

Made this for a block party/luau and it was gone in a matter of minutes! Used an 8 lb. shoulder (Boston Butt), trimmed off the fat, sliced an onion and placed it on the bottom of the slow cooker. Then put the pork roast in and poured in two cans of root beer. I let it soak overnight. Gave it a turn before putting cooking and let it cook on high for 9 hours.  Removed the pork roast and poured out the root beer and onions and shredded. Put it back into the slow cooker and poured a BIG bottle of BBQ sauce over it and let it cook for another 40 minutes. Served it on small rolls with coleslaw. Wow! People were fighting to get to the table. It was a huge success.

Use pork shoulder, butt or even loin, not tenderloin! Tenderloin is too lean for this recipe. You need a roast with some fat marbled through it to give it flavor and keep it from drying out while cooking! Delicious though! The root beer helps tenderize the meat, beautifully & I don't think it comes out tasting like root beer if u cook it long enough.. just gives a slight sweet taste to the meat. I always do a light dry rub, before putting it in & pouring the root beer around it. I Cook it low & slow..about 8 hours, basting it a few times, if i'm home. Then just drain, shred it up, discarding any fatty bits. Add lotsa Sweet Baby Ray's and cook for another hour..or two. Serve "slider" style on mini buns w/ coleslaw and seasoned potato wedges. Just started one.  Does not get easier than this!

100% fabulous. i used a simple rub on a 4 lb pork butt (pork shoulder), put it in a slow cooker and covered about 3/4 of the way with a&w root beer. 8 hours later i took it out and pulled it apart with 2 forks. then i drained the slow cooker and put the shredded meat back in with a bottle of sweet baby ray's bbq sauce. another 45 minutes in the slow cooker and it was done. i will make again.

This was AMAZING!!!  Just finished eating, BF had two sandwiches and I'm having leftovers tomorrow for lunch.  

I did use 20oz of Root Beer just to make sure the pork was covered completely, then cooked for 6hrs, drained and shredded, returned to crockpot with Kansas style smokey BBQ sauce for one more hour.   So tender, so juicy, so delicious!!!!

For those that said it was too sweet - they had to have used sweet BBQ sauce - because you can't taste the sweetness of the Root Beer after you've drained it and cooked in BBQ sauce.

This was AWESOME.  It came out juicy and tender and completely fell apart when I shredded it.  I have no idea if it was the root beer or the tenderloin, but it was fantastic.  And it was even better the next day!  It's definitely a contender for my favorite pulled pork recipe!

I make this all the time.  A couple of tips...don't use a pork loin unless you're wanting less fat.  Cheaper cuts actually add more flavor.  I usually use a 3-4lb pork shoulder/butt (boneless).  

Also, you can use ANY DARK SODA.  The soda actually tenderizes the meat...it doesn't change the flavor.

My husband prefers sliced onions in his, so I throw those in with the pork and soda so they absorb as much flavor as possible!  Yum!

Lastly, you can't beat Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Hopefully, your store carries it!

Excellent! This is THE recipe for pulled pork. So easy and the results are amazing. I used a pork sirloin roast instead of a tenderloin. It was about $6.00. I poured 3 cans of A&W over it, added some minced dried onions, 3 cloves of smashed garlic and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Then I drained it, shredded the meat and added one bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce (the best!!) and cooked it for another hour. It was outstanding! A keeper.

I just made this and it's amazing.  The root beer gives it a very mild underlying sweet taste.   I used a 4 lb pork roast, as opposed to tenderloin, and filled the root beer over the top of the roast.  I cooked it on high for about 4 1/2-5 hours (as I didn't have 6 or 7).  It was tender and succulent, and I had 0 problems with the root beer sticking to the crock pot.  I pulled the roast out, drained the root beer, and shredded the pork.  I then put the pork back in the crock pot, and smothered it in some homemade bbq sauce.   delicious!!

Tasted like root beer, even after I let it cook for an hour in the BBQ sauce.  Gross, pulled pork shouldn't taste like rootbeer.

Thankfully stuffing my face with delicious pulled pork has in no way impaired my ability to tell you how amazing this recipe is. Follow this recipe and you will not be disappointed. It's easy, cheap, and almost the best thing to come home to after a long day. I threw the tenderloin and root beer in the crock this morning, let it cook on low for 8 hours, it kept warm until I got home and bing bang boom- in a few minutes I had an amazing dinner. I'm 5 months pregnant and I could eat this every night until I give birth. My baby could come out shredded and covered in bbq from my obsession with this recipe. Beware the dangers of its deliciousness!

I used a 4 1/2 lb pork shoulder roast. I did a dry rub(homeade,including brown and white sugars and other seasonings of my liking) all over the roast and place it in a ziploc bag with half a bottle of beer overnite. The next day i added a bottle of A & W Rootbeer and then let that marinate all day and nite. The next day i put it my slow cooker on low and let it cook for 10 hrs (I did add a bottle of bbq sauce and rubbed it all over every side of the roast) I took it out.. drained it,shredded it, added a bottle of Sweet baby Rays bbq sauce (i kept a about 2 cups of the sauce it cooked in and added that to bbq sauce) and let it cook another 45mins-one hr on high..then i served it on kaiser rolls...by far the BEST pulled pork sandwich ever! Only difference is next time ill do TWO bottles of sweet baby rays instead of ONE!! Definately keeping this recipe..altho my rating of 5 stars is obviously based on my changes and difference in the way i marinated it...i didnt try the recipe as written as i read thru most the reviews first and decided against it.

This was delicious, SIMPLE and tender! We used a boneless pork roast (only change browned pork in a skillet with S & P first) on low then drained root beer sauce (the secret)...Pulled the pork with (2) forks and mixed in Jack Daniel's regular BBQ sauce with a tad of water to simmer for another 1/2 hour.  My DH could not guess what it was cooking in all day : )  If it was too sweet like some stated then use a GOOD "hickory" BBQ sauce and not one with Brown Sugar or Honey!  The root beer adds the exact amount of "sweet".

10 stars!  First timer here - and it was GREAT and EASY!  I'm thrilled, my son, pulled pork expert says it's better than he's ever had.  I bought a 4 lb. butt/shoulder pork roast on the bone, seasonsed it with garlic powder, salt, pepper, seasoned salt and dry onions - 2 bottles of root beer and let it cook for 8 1/2 hrs. - pulled it out, removing bone and big piece of fat, drained the cooking liquid removing bits and pieces, put 1/2 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray and about a cup + of the liquid it cooked in - OH MY it was SO good - thank you a million times!  My son thinks I'm special...priceless!

Always a hit whenever we serve it. And if we don't have root beer, any cola will do (not diet). I too save money by using a cheaper cut of meat. After shredding, I just moisten the pork with bbq sauce (instead of covering it completely) and serve with extra sauce so guests can customize to their liking.

First time to make pulled pork, and I am very happy with this recipe.  I actually used it for a large package of assorted pork chops instead of a roast.  Probably cooked them 7-9 hrs (lost track of the time), but definitely until the meat was falling apart.  Only downside was picking through all the meat for the little bones, because some of them fell apart also.  The pork was superbly tender.  After "shredding" the meat (all I had to do was mash it with a fork), I added about 1/2 bottle of barbecue sauce along with some of the cooking liquid to thin it out, mixed it well, and left it in the fridge overnight to absorb the bbq flavor.  Warmed it the next day in the microwave and served on wheat buns, with more bbq sauce and light ranch dressing.  Will definitely make again.  I considered adding an onion and some spices but didn't, and honestly I don't know that it is needed.  This was delicious with just the 2 ingredients.  My daughter pronounced it better than our favorite bbq restaurant.  My assessment is that the soda and crockpot really tenderize the meat, and it soaks up the bbq sauce flavor very well.  Definitely a new family favorite.  I will try this with coke as well, though I could not taste root beer, there was maybe a touch of sweetness in the meat before adding the bbq sauce, but I would have never guessed it was cooked in root beer if I hadn't put it there myself :)

I made two crock pots of this. One with the BBQ sauce and one without (just the root beer) for my sister who is nursing. Everyone LOVED the one without the BBQ sauce best! The flavor was so unique and the pork super tender. Will make this again without sauce!

This was super easy to make, and tasted great! I used a pork shoulder instead of a tenderloin, as I am on a budget. Two pounds was only $2.35 as opposed to the $10 dollars it would have cost to use a tenderloin.  I used a rub on the pork and seasoned it before adding the root beer.  I also added some sliced onions to the bottom of the pan.  When the pork was tender enough, I removed the fat from the shoulder to make it a bit healthier.  I added the bbq sauce an hour before serving it, as I wanted the meat to marinate in it a little while to enhance the flavor. It turned out very well.  My boyfriend loved it! I served it with a potato salad.  We had a little bit of pulled pork left over the next day which I used for taco night.  It tastes great with some spicy guacamole rolled up into some flour tortillas! I would definitely make this again!

Oh my YUMMY!!! I used a 5lb Pork Loin (which barely fit in my slow cooker lol) rubbed it with salt, pepper and some garlic powder. Doubled the root beer and added 2 TbSp liquid smoke. Because the meat was so big I did make sure to cook it for 10 hours. I felt like a 5 star chef when my hubby bit into it and rolled his eyes in delight! Have a ton of left overs which I've stuck in baggies and placed in the freezer for quick dinners when we need them. DEF making this one again!

So easy and very good! You will need more rootbeer than the recipe calls for to cover the pork, so I buy a liter bottle of rootbeer and just pour in that I need.

I've made a slightly different version of this many times now because it's a real winner.  Don't be deceived by the simplicity or the few ingredients -- it's unbelievable.  My version uses a Boston Butt cut, and in addition to the root beer, uses minced onions (dry).  I've done every type of long-version pulled pork that take days to make, and this beats them all.

YUMMY!  I served this to my close friends that HATE Rootbeer. They couldn't believe that it was made with rootbeer. You can't taste it... I used a 4 lb pork loin roast (that was on sale for BOGO) with 4 cups of rootbeer and 2-18oz bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce. It made @ 10 large sandwiches. YUMMY! 3 weeks later, I made this recipe again with a 4-1/2 lb Boston Butt (@$7) and it also was Yummy... The only difference  between the two (as far as I could taste) was the "Butt" had a little more fatty taste to it...Butt (pun intended), both turned out fantastic.

First of, let me say to the person that said Southerners don't like Vinegar based sauce..Wrong, lol..we love our Cider Vinegar, especially paired with pulled pork!! I have made this recipe about 10 times and have used a 5 pound Pork Butt and 2 bottles of root beer..you need some of the fat, to make good pulled pork..I have used dark ale & a&w root beer, it comes out better with root beer, but that is just my preference. I have been using a recipe for BBQ Sauce given to me by a friend to simmer the pork in after you shredd it and it is delish!! I have to rate this recipe 5 Stars..simplicity is best!!

So eaasy and delicious. I used a 4.5 pork shoulder. I rubbed garlic powder, salt and pepper over the whole thing. I sliced one medium sized onion and placed the pieces on the bottom of the crock pot. I placed the shoulder on top of the layer of onion then sliced another onion and placed those pieces on top of the shoulder. I then added enough of a two liter bottle of root beer to cover the shoulder. I slow cooked the shoulder for 10 hours on low overnight. When I took the pork out in the AM it came out in pieces it was sooo teder. I separated the fat which was minimal from the shredded pork and threw all the pork back into the root beer bath for a couple minutes. I then removed it, discarded the root beer and added sweet baby rays. I put the crock pot of shredded pork in the fridge to sit until I put the crockpot back on low for about an hour before dinner. SO DELICIOUS! SO EASY! The familu can't wait for me t make it again

I had thought the root beer would add a weird flavor to the pork but I was WRONG! So tender and tasted amazing. My husband, who is super picky about his BBQ loved it. Only thing extra I did extra was to rub salt, pepper, garlic powder and some paprika into the meat before cooking. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Simple, easy, and really good! However, I am a spice freak, and personally think it tastes better with an onion, and then some spices.

SOOO GOOD! I was making this for a party so I used a 10 lbs pork butt roast, seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper,  and cooked it on high for 3 hours, then low for 6. Drained (reserving about a cup of liquid), shredded, then put back in the slow cooker until it was time to eat. Then I poured just a little of the liquid back in to make sure it was super moist. Everyone loved it - we ate in on buns with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and coleslaw. YUM! Thanks :)

Made this for a party with about 30 people.  I used pork shoulder, not tenderloin.  I was wary because this group is Texan and likes their spice and thought cooking this in root beer would be too sweet for this crowd.  Boy was I wrong.  They LOVED it.  Every person must have commented on it a dozen times before the night was over.  Huge hit and will definitely make again!

Yum! We love this pulled pork! I have made it with a tenderloin as well as with a roast. Either way it turns out amazing. If you don't have rootbeer on hand any cola will work just as well. I also slice about half an onion into my slowcooker with the meat! We love it with Bull's Eye Smokin' Chipotle BBQ sauce.

A.) SO EASY  B.) DELICIOUS  C.) SO EASY   •  The husband's reaction when I had him taste it upon walking in the door, "Uhh! Ohh! That's yummy!" And after dinner, he told me that he's looking forward to bragging up my cooking to his parents again this weekend. That's all I can ask for, eh :)   •   I love all the helpful suggestions, so, in turn, I like to let others know how I've tweaked: I used a cheaper "Pork Loin Boneless Roasting Pork".  I rubbed on a bit of salt, black pepper and garlic powder and then, easy peasy, put the pork in the slow cooker, covered with root beer and walked away for 5 hours.  After 5 hours, I snagged the pork out of the cooker and into a large bowl.  It pulled apart with hardly any effort!  I discarded the root beer, returned the (pulled) pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce (I use Dan the Smokin Man's BBQ Sauce, local Michigan product!).  Warmed for an hour or so and then served.  I will happily make this dish again.

Best pulled pork ever! I have felt compelled to write a review but this recipe inspired me! We recently moved to the east coast from Southern California and BBQ is huge here. We've tried pulled pork dozens of times and this is by far the best. I think the root-beer makes all the difference. I rubbed the pork with salt, pepper and minced garlic before tossing it in the crock pot. Also added a chopped sweet onion for flavor. Served on potato buns with banana peppers, slaw and pickles. I've made this a few times now, my husband now requests this on a regular basis. Thank you!!

Super easy to prepare, however having made pulled-pork sauce from scratch, I have to admit using purchased BBQ sauce didn't work for me.  Much too much bbq flavour.  Not sure what, if anything, using the root beer did for this recipe.

I made this for the Superbowl with a few adjustments and it was delicious!  The day before I used a 5 1/2 lb bone in pork butt with 24 ounces of root beer, a sliced onion, and a few shakes of liquid smoke.  I only needed to cook it ~10 hours before it was fall off the bone tender.  We shredded it and put it in the fridge until the next morning when we put it back in the slow cooker with 2 - 18 ounce bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce for 2 hours.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I followed it precisely and it came out fabulous.  I changed a couple of things and it still did very well.  Note:  Like another reviewer said, I appreciate the reviews when the reviewer followed the recipe and I appreciate the change suggestions.  But if you are going to change the ingredients, don't give it a bad rating based on what YOU did or didn't do.  You may well have ruined it all by yourself with what you thought was a good idea.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I pulled together a few different reviewers suggestions and the result was amazing.  I bought a pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin and it was HUGE - so i had to quadruple the recipe.  I was a little skeptical about not using any seasoning on the roast so I followed another reviewer with the worcestershire/onion soup/garlic/salt and pepper marinade and let it sit covered overnight in the refrigerator.  First thing in the morning I loaded up my crock pot with the roast and root beer and away it went.  I let it cook for 12 hours while I was at work and when I got home the house smelled wonderful, the meat was falling off the bone and very juicy and easy to shred.  I made this along with Jodi T's Corn and Black Bean Salad and everyone was raving!

My husband considers himself a pulled pork expert and this recipe received the highest praise - he said it was the BEST he has ever had.  The only change I made was to use pork butt instead of tenderloin.  Oh, and Sweet Baby Ray's (the greatest bbq sauce ever) makes all the difference.

I agree with MegaG pork tenderloin is much to dry for
making pulled pork.I use a pork butt, it has just the right amount of fat to make a delicious pulled pork.
I braised a 4 to 5 pound butt for about 3 to 4 hrs.the only season I use is salt and pepper. I  put about 1cup of chicken stock with about 1/2 cup of apple juice .also slice 1 onion and 1 bellpepperand it is the most tender and delicious meat you can ever put in your mouth. Also I have done the bone in or boneless. pulled pork tacos in a corn tortilla with some cole slaw,!!!YES!!!

This is a great recipe. I would not recommend the Pork Shoulder. It has so much fat on it, and you are paying for that. You can feed more with a smaller more expensive pork tenderloin. I used two 2lb . pork tenderloins and I drained half way through cooking and added another bottle of root beer. I put in two tablespoons of liquid smoke at that point. For the last hour I added the Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar Barbecue sauce that someone recommended in their reviews. I used two bottles. It tasted awesome. I have ordered pulled pork from a catering business before and this was better really. Our friends have their own smoker at home and they loved this recipe. I have used the shoulder before and I will definitely use the tenderloin from now on. It was just pure meat. Thanks for the tip on Sweet Baby Rays I think that really made a difference.

My daughter found this recipe on your site and told me how good and easy it was to make, she was right, this was so good. I only had diet root beer, so I ended up using coke and it worked just fine. Soooo easy and it smelled so good while it was cooking all day in my slow cooker. My husband loves pulled pork and really loved this recipe, will be making again.

We are still buzzing over this delectable perfection on a bun! So amazing! My husband says it is the best pulled pork he has ever had! And it was super easy. I did make some changes however. I used 4.5 pounds of tenderloin. I seared the meat on all sides in olive oil spray (not butter) prior to the slow cooker. I added 2 carmelized onions in slivers in the pot as well as a tablespoon of garlic while the meat cooked. I used 4 cans of barq's root beer, 1/4th cup of Jack Daniels whiskey and a smidge of brandy to the slow cooker. Then after 6 hours, I strained the meat and onions and added 1 bottle of Jack Daniels Hickory and Brown sugar bbq sauce and 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown sugar bbq sauce. I had mixed the sauces together prior to adding to the meat. I then put the meat on whole wheat bakery kaiser rolls which I lightly toasted. The whole shebang just melted in our mouths!!! Thank you for this easy recipe which was a cinch my first time putting together.

I have been asked for the recipe many times.  Make sure you use a sweet BBQ sauce to mix with the Root beer.

This was very easy and tasted wonderful. I was hesitant about the root beer, but it flavored the pork perfectly. I put one can of root beer in the slow cooker with a 6lb bone-in pork roast on low for 10 hours. Removed the bone, shredded the pork, added bottled BBQ sauce, 2 cloves of minced garlic and cooked it another hour. Served on hamburger buns with grated sharp cheddar and red onion rounds. Perfect.

This was very, very easy and so delicious!  After hand shredding the pork, I stirred in a generous amount of Wegman's Memphis style BBQ sauce...its sweet, and has a strong smoky taste.  I lightly buttered kaiser rolls with sesame seeds and lightly toasted them, then loaded on the pork.  On the side we had home-made potato and egg salad and corn on the cobb.  Yummmm!

A friend told me to cook pork this way.  I used a pork loin (I prefer to save pork tenderloins for other preparations) and cooked it with a liter of root beer for about 7 hours. I shredded the pork (easily), returned it to the pot and added Jack Daniels Master Blend BBQ sauce.  The pork was delicious.

I tried this recipe over the weekend and it was a major hit! I was skeptical about root beer being the only ingredient, but thought, let's try it! Followed the directions exactly, cooked a 3.4 lb pork for 7 hours, took it out and the meat was super juicy and shredded amazingly. Put the shredded meat back in the crock pot for about 20 minutes with bbq sauce and dinner was ready! Served it on toasted buns topped with shredded lettuce and a side of fruit. The hubby and kids LOVED it! Great dinner; mission accomplished!

I make this a lot when we are having company.  It's so easy, I don't even have to worry about it.  I just put a little sauce on it after I pull it apart in the crockpot, and then I set out different kinds of sauces and people can put on what they like.  I serve it with pickles and sliced onions, cole slaw, and chips.  I also always use a pork shoulder.  So much more for your money, and when it cooks all day, it comes out so tender - you don't need the tenderloin for delicious results.  Some people say to add seasonings, but why, when it comes out so good just like it is, and its so easy to just toss in the crock pot as is.  Thanks for this recipe!

Use 4.25 pork shoulder instead of tenderloin. Used two and 1/3 12 oz cans of root beer. Added almost 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicy BBQ sauce.

I was unable to find a reasonably sized pork roast as others have suggested so I followed the recipe and went with the pork tenderloin. I doubled the recipe and used 2 tenderloins (approx. 4 lbs.). I took the advice of many and added salt, pepper, and garlic salt to the pork before pouring the root beer in. I let the pork cook in the root beer for the suggested 6-7 hours before draining the root beer out of the crockpot. I then poured in the BBQ sauce (I used Dinosaur BBQ which had a nice spice to it) and then it cook for about two hours to soak up the BBQ taste. I did this because I felt the root beer taste was too strong initially. After cooking in the BBQ, the root beer taste went away and just made the pork a little sweeter. My hubby loved it on a hamburger bun with a side of baked beans! I topped a 1/2 cup of quinoa with this delish pulled pork for a healthier, fiber-filled, low-carb option and it was wonderful! This is a quick and easy recipe guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser!

This is a wonderful and easy way to make pulled pork that people will love.  I have always used a can of coke, cook it all day on low in the slow cooker, shred and then I make my own BBQ sauce.  If you like a sweet sauce there is a honey BBQ sauce recipe on this site, which I always use and get rave reviews.

I followed directions, but the root beer honestly does not give the pork a very good flavor.  I was surprised because it got so many great reviews.  You couldn't taste the other spices because the root beer was so overpowering.  I didn't care for this recipe and wish I would've just cooked the pork in a broth or pineapple juice like I typically do.

I made this recipe for the first time last night, I let it simmer on low in my slow cooker for 15 hours[ I had 2 shoulder roasts] I poured in almost a while bottle of root beer and added 1 tbsp of liquid smoke. It was so tender that it shredded of the fork effortlessly, I then added a bottle of sweet onion chipotle bbq sauce, a tsp of worcestershire sauce, a tsp of liquid smoke and was i cooking!!
I let it simmer on low for 2 hours to get the flavors blended, that is the secret of a good flovored pulled pork, is to let it simmer up all the flavors of the sauce.
I had 8 in for supper last night and that was the first time they all tried it, my friend Libby after having tasted her first bite closed her eyes and said that was how i imagined it to taste, she said i think we are in the deep south!
A great recipe, i reccomend everyone should at least try this recipe!!

So easy, so good. I use whatever cheapo pork roast cut is on sale. I usually buy a few and keep one in my freezer for this quickie recipe. I've tried a few different BBQ sauces, but our favorite is from Trader Joe's. Yummy as pulled pork sliders with cole slaw on top of the pork.

Sorry but I have to give this one star. The root beer does not give the meat any flavor at all. After 6 hours in the crockpot I had a dry, tasteless piece of meat that I drenched in barbecue sauce to give it some flavor and juicieness. This was a waste of a good piece of meat.

Made this exactly as stated in the recipe and used Sweet Baby Rays sweet and spicy as suggested by many of the reviewers.  My family LOVES this recipe. Thank you for sharing! Update - I make this recipe all the time! To save money I use a 3-4 pound Boston Butt Roast with the bone in. I think it is more flavorful using the roast with the bone. Keep the fat on and be sure to put it in the cooker fat side up so all the juices can roll down over the meat. When you shred it you can throw the fat out. Slow cook for 8-10 hours until it shreds easily. I also like to salt and pepper the meat first and if I have time, I sear it on all sides for more flavor.

This dish is truly devine. I used Bullseye Bold, it make sure there was lots of flavour. I hosted this dish, and it was a huge success. I made no alterations to the dish (I used pork tenderloin, not the shoulder if anything), it's perfect the way it was... the meat just fell apart. Will -definitely- make again!

I decided to make this recipe because it looked easy and good, and it was! I cooked it on low for about 6 hours, drained the root beer, shredded the pork, then added the BBQ sauce. I let it cook on low in the slow cooker for another hour after that. Served with German potato salad and a green salad. It was an effortless main dish!

This is amazing!  I opted for a pork shoulder roast as it is a good choice for bbq. I used a 5# roast rubbed with salt, pepper and garlic powder and 2 cups of root beer, cooked on low for 5 hours then on high for about 90 minutes.  I shredded the pork and returned it to the slow cooker with about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and enough bbq sauce to moisten the meat.  Then kept warm on low for about 30 minutes until dinner.   This is a wonderful option for winter pulled pork when you just don't want to brave the elements to use the grill.  Thanks to Livie's Mammy for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  This has become a staple in our house.  I usually cook the pork for 8 hours, drain the root beer, add the bbq sauce and then allow the bbq flavour to soak through, about another 1/2 hour to 45 min. We've also put garlic butter on the buns to add some extra flavour. Yum!

So I just got done cooking and eating this delicious dinner and I must say I pretty much inhaled it. I used 4 lbs. of pork butt because my grocery store didn't have any tenderloin in stock. I poked holes in the meat to better facilitate the juices in my pork. I didn't measure the root beer I just poured in enough to almost cover the meat. Not to much not to little. I turned it over halfway through cooking it and started to drain it & shred it at about 6 hours. Then I poured my barbecue sauce (Bulls Eye) stirred it in and set my slow cooker to keep warm and served on some hamburger buns straight from the toaster oven with some baked beans. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! Will DEFIANTLY make again.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and everyone loves it! I have had many people ask me for the recipe. My sister just had me make it yesterday for my great niece's birthday party because she liked it so well when I made it for my son's party. The only thing that I did differently is that I added a whole 2 liter of A& W root beer instead of just a can. Once it is done, I drain all but about 2 cups of broth off of the meat then add Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. This keeps it juicy and flavorful.

I made this recipe as written except my roast was just over 4 lbs. so I used two bottles of IBC. The root beer did give the loin a slightly sweet pleasant flavor, but I feel it needs some seasoning.  We ate it without BBQ sauce and it was good but I did make a custom sauce for half of it and returned it to the crockpot to simmer in that for a while.  It consisted of cider vinegar, tomato paste, brown sugar, molasses, a little garlic, Worcestershire, and Frank's Red Hot - no measurements, just all ingredients to taste.  I would make it again with a little additional seasoning added.

I did things a little differently: I used a 4 pound shoulder cut and Dr. Pepper instead of root beer. I cooked it for 6.5 hours on low, then shredded it, wrapped it loosely in foil, and put it on the grill on low heat with wood chips to get the smoke flavor. Served with Big Al's KC BBQ sauce from this site.

I make a similar recipe to this one.  You use rootbeer and a full bottle of Chili Sauce and mix together. Then pour it off the Pork Loin and cook in crock pot. It is the best I have tried.  Pork Loin is the better choice when you can get it on sale for $1.99lb.

I was really looking forward to this; since all the reviews were so positive.  I have to say this recipe was NOT GOOD!  There was very little taste, it was mushy; very disappointing.  My husband didn't mind it, but he's not very picky, either.  I won't make this again.  Yuk!

Delicious!  I used a pork butt--way more flavor than a tenderloin. But since I didn't want all of that fat, I trimmed as much off of the pork as I could before cooking it.  I actually cooked mine on low overnight, then refrigerated the pork--crock and all--while I went about my day.  A few hours before dinner, I skimmed the hardened fat off the pork and shredded it, removing the chunks of solidified fat (gross, I know) as I went.  Then I drained the crock, mixed in some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and warmed up the pork on low for a couple of hours.  Served it with a vinegar-based coleslaw. Very yummy!

This recipe was excellent!  I made it for a family reunion and everyone wanted the recipe.  I researched several recipe sites to come up with the ingredients.  I used a 4.68 lb. pork butt (cheaper cut of meat) and better for pulled pork.  I sliced a large onion and put it on the bottom of the crock pot.  Placed the pork on the onions and use a can of ginger ale to cook the pork in.  Cooked it on low for 10 hrs.  Drained the juice, chopped the onion and shredded the pork.  Placed the pork and onion back in the crock pot and used a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce.  Cooked on low for another couple of hours and served with buns.  To be honest, most people did not use the buns, they just scooped the pulled pork up and put on their plate as a side.  Wonderful!!!

Followed the recipe, but pierced the pork and rubbed a little salt and pepper on the pork loins before placing them in the crockpot.  I also added two cans of rootbeer (instead of one), because my crockpot is oblong (instead of deep) and one can didn't cover.  Cooked for 6 hours on "high" setting - drained the rootbeer, pulled the pork apart and then added a bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce on "low" for the next 1 1/2 hours...EASY and Yummy.  My family loved it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

So easy and tasty. Used first with one brand of BBQ that I didn't like...then tried Sweet Baby Rays like others suggested. Way better. I also used coke the second time when I didn't have any rootbeer...and it was great!

WONDERFUL!! I hate root beer so I was slightly nervous trying this recipe but it is DELICIOUS! Like many reviewers, I used a cheaper, larger cut of pork than the recipe suggested (in my case, a 6 lb boston butt) and it turned out marvelous. Use a high quality BBQ sauce and a slow cooker liner for superior taste and hassle-free clean-up! This is an easy, fool-proof recipe for success!

I had never made pulled pork before and I am not a big root beer fan but this recipe was unbelievable!  I got a 6 lb. Boston Butt from the butcher and layered slices of onion on top with a little salt and pepper.  I walked away thinking okay...that was too easy!???  Seven hours later drained it, shredded it and placed back in the crock with Sweet Baby Rays for an hour until company arrived.  This is the perfect recipe for entertaining because you dont have to cook while guests are there!! Thanks for another great addition to my recipe box!

Root beer?!?  I had to admit, I tried this recipe only because my son begged me to make pulled pork, but I'm so glad I did--it was fantastic.  For those of you who, like me, are always trying to shave calories off of a recipe, I used diet root beer and it was fine.  I did spice things up a bit with  some hot sauce at the end, but this was just my personal preference--it was great either way.

I LOVED this recipe!  It was Soooooo easy.  I'd recommend trying this!  The taste was wonderful, and it was about the easiest thing I've ever made!  (And I love to cook! but sometimes just don't have a lot of time.)  I don't know what the root beer did, but it was just GREAT!  I will definately make it again and again!

I've made this several times, and every time it was a hit.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly except for the cut of meat, and despite using a 6 lb pork shoulder, there were few leftovers with my teenaged boys. Since then, I have followed suggestions of others and rubbed the roast with a mix of salt, pepper, and garlic powder (and sometimes a little cayenne) before cooking.

Guy Fieri's root beer barbecue sauce really brought out the root beer flavor when I made it last night, and I added about 1 tsp of cayenne to compensate for the sweetness of the sauce. Made a pineapple cole slaw and corn bread to go with it, and again was not disappointed.

I used a 5 lb. pork shoulder cut, used a light rub, and 3 cans of root beer. It made my house smell sickly sweet when it was cooking. When it was done, I dumped the liquid, fork shredded it, and mixed in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and put pack in the crock pot for another hour. It has a strangely sweet smell and after-taste, similar to cream soda..? I'm still trying to find a way to salvage it. Maybe it was because the root beer came out of a can, but I'm not going to try it again. I'll have to pass on this recipe.

I've used this recipe a few times now, experimenting with different cuts of pork. Most recently I used pork sirloin because it was on sale. Any can of regular (not sugar-free) soda will work--the acidic soda water does the tenderizing and the flavoring does the, well, the flavoring. I've used Coca-cola, Seven-up, Ginger ale, and Dr. Pepper; all with excellent results. Regardless of flavor the pork stays moist and tender when under the influence of soda pop. The barbecue sauce usually overpowers the soda taste anyway, so you can't go wrong. Here's a tip: leave everything in the crockpot when shredding the pork. If you have any excess liquid after shredding(and most often I don't), then just drain the juices. Why dirty up an extra skillet when you don't have to? Here's another tip: toast the buns before slapping on the pork. The dryer bun holds the sauce  better.

Don't be put off by the root beer - this recipe is over the top fantastic not to mention ridiculously simple. I've used the pork for BBQ sandwiches, for soft tacos, quesadillas, etc. It's great for superbowl parties and buffets. I'd double the recipe tho cuz u won't believe how fast it'll go!

It doesn't get any easier or more delicious. I used a 4lb pork butt in a bit over half of a 2l bottle of root beer. Cooked 7 hours on low......and it just almost pulled itself, :)  Added Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and cooked it for about another 1 1/2 hrs(from cold, probably 1 hr if it were still warm). Served along homemade potato salad and pinto beans and birthday cake, :).

I am suprised there are so many positive reviews for this.  I followed the recipe word for word and you can totally taste root beer.  I took a bite and the first thing that came to my mind was "hot rootbeer mixed with barbeque sauce with some pork flavour mixed in".  Never making this again.

This is our go-to tailgaiting crowd pleaser! We always throw a whole large sliced onion into the crockpot with the porkroast and bbq sauce and it gets all caramelized and delicious. We scoop this onto potato rolls or hawaiian sweet rolls and throw some coleslaw on top and chow down! Yum!!!

Results vary between cookers, of course, but ours is the largest size so I needed to add 6 oz (1/2 can) more root beer for the same 2 lbs of meat. If you get a shoulder roast, which is MUCH cheaper and more flavorful than the tenderloin, remove the netting it comes in. Also, 6 hours on low didn't have the meat "broken down" enough... we put the heat up to high for the last hour. If you are making this to entertain guests, give yourself a margin for error and start it earlier and figure on 8 hours for 2 pounds of meat - it holds perfectly after you stir in the sauce, and you aren't all sitting around smelling it and drooling and starving while you wait!

Sorry, did not like this. Not sure what the root beer had to do with this. As with most "bbq" anything, I find it's mostly all up to the sauce. I will stick to the kalua pig on this site when I make this kind of thing. The pork simmering in rootbeer did nothing to the aroma of my house. Sorry :(

My boyfriend loved this! I used a pork loin, sprinkled salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and a pinch of mustard powder. I lined the bottom of the pot with yellow onion slices and put loin on top, just slightly covered with Mug root beer and cooked on low for 8 hours. The pork just fell apart so easily! Dumped the liquid, reserving just a little bit on the side and mixed it all with SBR Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and cooked on low for another hour and a half. Sooooo good!! Thank you!

I rub a 'pork butt roast' with garlic powder and course pepper, wrap tight with cellophane and refrigerate for 2 hours or more before slow cooking. I also use  Dr. Pepper (not diet). My favorite sauce is 'Sweet Baby Ray's' original. Don't overcook! YUM-YUM

Here's how you kick up this recipe... keep the pork tenderloin but rub it down with Neely's season salt (double the paprika and cayenne). Lay the pot roast on top of an entire chopped onion. Pour 12 oz. root beer, 12 oz. pale ale beer, and 16 oz. beef broth over it. Cook it on low as long as you can. Empty the crock, shred the pork, and mix in your favorite BBQ sauce (I make my own) with the shredded pork. Let it cook for 1.5 hours and serve on your favorite bun. Add BBQ sauce to the sandwich as needed. Enjoy!

Very tasty - the first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and found the pork was a little bit dry. I used a larger pork roast the next time and it was much better - I think the tenderloin is too lean for this recipe. I have also substituted Miller Lite for root beer and it was fantastic!

Delicious!!!!!!
I also used a pork shoulder that was 2.5 lbs (much cheaper) and cooked it for about 8 hours.
after shredding I placed back in crock pot with a ladel of root bear I reserved while draining, then added about 3/4 of an 18 oz bottle kraft honey BBQ sauce. Afraid it would be too sweet with the whole bottle. SOOOO good. My 3 and 4 year old loved it and they usually hate trying new things. Can't wait to try this recipe with different flavors BBQ sauce.

This recipe is awesome! I normally smoke my pulled pork, but decided to try it in the crock pot this time, due to time constraints. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed and neither were any of my guests! I did use a pork butt and seasoned it with a rub and added a couple tablespoons of cider vinegar to the rootbeer, but that is just my preference. The pork fell apart into pieces when I removed it to shred. It really was great!!

I have made this recipe many times, and like other reviewers, I found that the Root Beer gave hardly any taste. WHAT I SUGGEST is using DR. PEPPER! It is sweeter than the root beer and the flavour seems to stay inside the meat as well. For a BBQ sauce, we make our own but I suggest getting a spicy sauce or hickory smoked sauce to balance out the sweetness of the meat. If anyone is wondering what to make as a side dish, you can make home fries or coleslaw, something nice and refreshing to your mouth! Hope this review helps you guys out!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, substituting pork butt for the tenderloin.  It cooked up somewhat more quickly than the recipe indicated, becoming "shreddable" in four or five hours.  Fairly tasty, texture was perfect.  A little sweet for my taste, though (go figure -- I used a bottle of Jones root beer) ... and could have used a bit of salt.  I used a bottle of Baby Ray's ... and rinsed the bottle with wine vinegar.

Do not, do not, do not use DIET Dr. Pepper. I did, and while the tenderloin was certainly pull-apart tender, there was zero flavor imparted to it from the soda. Might as well have used water. I'm trying to fix it now, with a little Cholula and some brown sugar. If that doesn't give it some kick, I'll just be sure to use plenty of sauce. I'll update this review after. But still, 4 stars because it's my bad for not using a sugared soft drink. ****** UPDATE: I wrapped the pork, juice and all, in foil overnight. Today, it was very moist and had just a hint of sweet from the brown sugar. So I went ahead and sauced it, reheated on the stove, and served it. We all loved it, so it now gets 5 stars. So easy, so good. I'll be making this again with a pork loin to save $ and the root beer as the recipe states, plus a dash of liquid smoke, just because. If I'd followed the recipe exactly it would still be 5 stars.

This was really easy and really good.  Can't go wrong with Pulled Pork. I like to make it a day ahead, then let in sit in the fridge overnight -- seems to bind the flavors really well.

Fabulous!! Made this last night to take on vacation.  Used a 6 lb. shoulder, rubbed it with South African Smoke season blend from Trader Joe's. Sprinkled some California style garlic powder, black pepper, and some cayenne power all over. Threw it in the crock pot with A&W Root Beer for 10 hours on low. Drained it and mixed in Bull's Eye Carolina style BBQ sauce and cooked on high for 1 hour! The house smelled so good I could hardly stand it! The BEST pulled pork recipe I have ever used! Thanks!

A year or 2 ago when I was looking for a good and easy recipe for pulled pork I saw this one and passed b/c I thought root beer sounded gross... So i went with another recipe (which was not as easy). I wasn't thrilled and thought ok, i'm going to try that root beer pulled pork recipe... and Oh My Gosh!!!!  I wish I would have went with this recipe first!!!  GET PAST the fact that it uses root beer b/c you will be so happy you tried it!!  ONLY change I made is I use pork shoulder (aka pork butt)  More tender and easy to shred!)  Other than that... as many have said before... we love sweet baby rays!!  I have made my own when time isn't an issue but you just can't go wrong with this amazing recipe.  I've thought about (haven't tried yet) trying it using for my BBQ beef recipe that i got from allrecipes.com!  Anyway, thank you so much for a staple summer time party food!!!

This was delicious!  I used pork shoulder and cooked on low for 8 hours with the root beer.  Shredded and used Bullseye Original BBQ sauce and cooked on low for another hour.  Served on rolls and it was a hit!

Pork tenderloin was a really bad choice for pulled pork. You can slow cook it for a week and it will never fall apart like a fattier cut of meat. Also, using root beer adds nothing what so ever.

This is incredibly easy and very tasty! The pork was so tender after 6 hours on low that it just fell apart. The only thing I will do different is add extra sauce next time, since I like my pulled pork a little saucier! Delicious!!

Excellent.  I used two 1.5 lb boneless tenderloins.  Poked holes with a fork in each and rubbed them with a little plain sea salt.  I poured ~2 cups root beer over them and let em cook for 6 hours on low, the drained the rootbeer and poured a bunch of BBQ sauce over them and allowed them to continue cooking for another hour and a half.  Shredded super easily, great for leftovers.  Thanks!

Very good and very easy.  Had a boneless pork loin and thought it would be dry, but it turned out great, not dry at all, very tender.  I used Big Al's BBQ sauce from this site.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow to eat the leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!! I poked holes, seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Pour the root beer. Let it cook for about 8 hours on low with a 3 1/2 pound tenderloin.  Then put it back in with sauce for about an hour. Served with green beans and curly fries. Good stuff!!!

So easy and so good!  I sprinkled garlic salt and pepper onto the roast before putting it in the crockpot.  I also stab the roast with a knife a bunch of times to let the root beer soak into the meat. I also use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. It's the best out there! It's perfection!

Outstanding! I made this for company on game day, served with beans and fries. Almost everyone had seconds! However....I did tweak the recipe a bit. Used pork shoulder and gave it a nice rub with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Used beer instead of root beer. Cooked for a total of 7 hrs (first two hours on high). Came out moist and pulled apart easily.

Fabulous recipe! I tweaked this recipe just a bit, but had people calling me 2 days later to let me know how good the sandwiches were. First, a shoulder roast is fine. The meat will be so tender you won't know the difference. I put a simple rub, Johnnys Seasoning Salt and black pepper, on the night before, covered and left it in the frig. Cooked with a can of root beer on low for 6 1/2 hours. I took the meat out and shredded it at this point and added a sauce containing the following: 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original, Tapatio, Worcestershire Sauce, honey and brown sugar. Just mix the remaining ingredients with the BBQ sauce until you get the flavor you want. Mix the sauce and meat and put it back in the crock pot on low for 1 1/2 hours. I served it on sesame seed hamburger buns. You won't be disappointed.

Seriously, this was truly amazing!  I've never made pulled pork before and I really had doubts even will all the great reviews.  I could not find tenderloin so I bought a 3 1/2 lbs boneless pork shoulder.  I also didn't have time to cook it long, so I cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours.  The only thing different is I added some garlic powder to the meat before I poured the root beer over it.  It was sooooo tender!!!  My husband loved it.  I will be making this for our football sunday parties FOR SURE!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Re: the last reviewer statement I have to disagree. Some of us have special diets for health reasons and mine doesn't allow much fat so yes, using pork tenderloin does make sense, it is way lower in fat than the shoulder. I enjoyed this recipe and used my own homemade BBQ sauce after draining the meat. Put the meat on buns, topped with good homemade low fat coleslaw, it was great and low enough in fat for me to be able to enjoy it with everyone else. So yes, tenderloin is more expensive, but it is also healthier for those who need to think about fat content. If you want a healthier version of pulled pork I recommend this recipe.

Root beer? Sounds like that secret ingredient and a must try.  This has to be a love it or hate it type of thing.  While cooking, the odor was not pleasant. It left an aftertaste similar to those old artificial sweeteners that lingered.  Give the root beer and pork a try the next time you cook pork chops to get an idea if this is a taste that you may find appealing.

Thank you all so much for your reviews of this recipe! You just made my night!  I pulled together most of the comments and found this method worked out perfectly:  4lbs of pork shoulder/pork butt, 4 cups root beer salt, pepper, garlic powder  Sprayed the crock pot with cooking spray, rubbed the pork with the s&p and garlic powder, added it into crock pot with root beer.  Cook on low.  At 3 hours turn the pork over.  At 6 hours take the pork out and shred removing excess fat and the root beer from the pot.  Return the shredded pork and add sauce.  I used a southern mustard bbq sauce.  Cook another hour.    It was 100% perfect.  Awesome.

This is an awesome recipe!!  I had the task of feeding my son's college baseball team.  Never having prepared pulled pork before I was looking for a recipe and came across this one.  I first started out with 3 10 lb. sections of pork shoulder roast.  I rubbed each with a little Liquid Smoke and a combo of kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, garlic power & onion powder.  Put it fat side up in my Westinghouse Roaster set at 225 degrees and poured in equal amounts of root beer and beef broth until the liquid level was near the top of the roasts.  Covered & let cook for 10 hours.  As I removed the meat from the roaster, it was falling off the bone and was very easy to shread.  I kept  some of the roasting liquid and added small amounts to the pork as I shredded it to keep it moist.  After shredding all the meat I added Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce to taste.  I also kept some of the roasting liquid in a bottle in case I needed to moisten the pulled pork when reheating the day of the game.  I also served it with bottles of the Sweet Baby Ray's just in case some preferred more sauce.  Every player ate at least 2 sandwiches & some came back for 2 more.  I would recommend this recipe to everyone who needs to feed a crowd as it got rave  reviews today!  Will be making again.  Thanks bunches!!!!

AMAZING!!!! Excellent on a tortilla with sour cream and salsa!!  Definitely use a boneless pork tenderloin (the long skinny kind) and make sure you drain the rootbeer before you shred the meat.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  Five yums!  This is such a super easy recipe and a sure crowd pleaser.  And it's even better warmed up!  The best bbq sauce (in my opinion):  Sweet Baby Ray's.  Just be sure to prepare a side of cole slaw to throw on top of your sandwich!

Excellent!  My first try at pulled pork and it was easy!  I had a 4 lb pork loin roast and I used 2 cans of Mug Root Beer and a can of beef broth and did my own rub of garlic powder and salt and pepper all over the roast.  Left in slow cooker for over 7 hours and it just fell off the bone and shred easily.  Added my BBQ sauce and very tasty! Great easy way to make pulled pork

I used A&W. I also rubbed the pork with salt,pepper, and garlic powder before cooking.  This was the best thing I have ever made in the slowcooker.  My guests all had seconds and I didn't even put sauce on it. I just let people choose what they wanted to top it with.  If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  I served it with mashed potatoes. YUM Thanks!!

Made this twice now. The first time I used tenderloin and it was unbelievable! The second time I used a cheaper cut and didn't really like it - it seemed less flavorful, almost greasy and didn't like the fatty texture. The leftovers ended up in the trash since no one wanted to eat them. I have to disagree with those who say a cheap cut is just as good. I think the tenderloin makes it a five star recipe not to mention it's healthier with tenderloin.

Wonderful!!! I started by rubbing the pork with salt, pepper, and garlic salt and poked with a fork so it could absorb the juices.  I cooked the pork in the rootbeer for 5 1/2 hours, then drained and pulled apart, then I added Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes.  This was deliciously tender.  My husband ate three sandwiches and I had 2!!!  We still have enough to warm up later!  I will definitely use this recipe often!  Thank you!!!

Awesome recipe!  Tender, delicious, and easy! It is also the lowest fat version of pulled pork I have found.  I will be making this again and again! **Update**  When I was pregnant I made this recipe and I could taste the rootbeer, and I didn't like it. I have since used chicken broth in place of the rootbeer and it turned out wonderful!

We tried this recipe the other nite and it was good.  The pork was tender, and shredded easily, but in my opinion the root beer really didn't add any flavor to the pork.  I have achieved similar results using a bottle of beer or broth (tender, easily shredded pork), but with much more flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.

I've tweaked this recipe a little bit - I use a 4.5 to 5 pound pork shoulder (as big as will fit in my crock pot), and I cook it a little longer (8 to 9 hours) with two cans of Barqs root beer and half a yellow sweet onion chopped up. A bottle and a half of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce at the end makes it just the right amount of soupy - it'll make a mess if you let it, but it won't fall out of the bun if you're careful. I make it often for potlucks, and everyone who has tried it absolutely LOVES it.

Some days you just want an easy to make meal, and this fits the bill. Used the Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy sauce. You could add as much as you like to keep it thin or drown it on. With coleslaw and other sides you're ready for a crowd. If you slow cook it overnight for 10 hrs, there's no hassle.

My family LOVES this pulled pork! I made 8 lb for my daughters 12th birthday thinking we could have leftovers.... It was all gone that day! I will say I made it with root beer the first time. Dr. Pepper works well too, but I have made it with a can if beer as well and that has got to be a favorite. It cooks the alcohol out but it gives it a great flavor. Especially good for tailgates and parties or family gatherings. Definitely a keeper!

Made a BIG batch for 40 people for 4th of July party.  A big hit -- delicious, cheap and easy!!!  Got a 9 lb pork shoulder from the butcher, put it in my double size crock pot, poured a 2 liter bottle of cheap root beer on top and cooked on high for first two hours (to heat up root beer and get things simmering) then on low another 8 hours until the meat was falling apart easily.  Made it a day ahead of time -- let it soak overnight in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, then reheated in the oven for a couple hours at about 300 degrees.  Came out amazing -- had many compliments and few left overs!!!

This really is a great easy recipe. The type of sauce you use makes the real difference.  We use Dave's BBQ sauce (Devil's spit). Made for a bunco group and everyone loved them!

So I made this the other day for my friends as an "experiment" for this was the first time I had ever bought/used a slow cooker. Followed the directions (Extremely simple and easy) and served it to my friends. They said it was the best  pulled pork they ever had. Thank you so much.

Just slow cooked this masterpiece with the use of a $6 Boneless Pork Loin. 12 oz. of the finest sarsaparilla, A&W and 18 oz. of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue 
Sauce.  I slopped it onto a high quality bun and shovel punched it into my throat, where a tastebud took place. Do yourself a favor and paint some coleslaw onto this mythical beast before taming it from the wild.

Another fantastic recipe from AR!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and A&W root beer.  My husband had 4 sandwiches, I couldn't believe it!  He added cheddar cheese to two of them and said he really liked the flavor, I wanted to add provolone but we were out.  Next time I'll make sure to have some on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe.  :)

I have made this at least 6 times and I always get raves.  I don't change a thing and it is so easy.  I have used several bottled sauces (I live in Houston) so it is a sweeter southern style sauce.  Make sure to heat it atleast 30 minutes more after draining and adding your bbq sauce.

You can't go wrong with this recipe! I have made this recipe twice - once for my fiance and once for my brother-in-law, who is married to my hard-core vegan sister, and doesn't enjoy the pleasures of meat too often.  Both my fiance and bro-in-law ABSOLUTELY loved this recipe! My fiance said, "how did you learn to make this?? It tastes like a restaurant!" and my bro-in-law raved, "This rivals any pulled pork I've ever had at a restaurant!"  No one can believe how easy this is!  I followed the cooking directions and ingredients to a T.  At the end of the cooking, I pulled the pork apart on a cutting board, drained most of the cooking juices from the pot, set the crock pot on Warm and put the pork back in with generous squeezes of Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce the first time and SBR's honey BBQ sauce the second time.  Both were delicious! You can't go wrong with this recipe!

OMG,  This was an awesome recipe.  Cooked this for my parents last night for the first time.  Very yummy.  For all of you who aren't sure about the rootbeer.  I wasn't either at first but it doesn't make the pork taste like rootbeer.  I used 5+ pound center cut pork loin.  Cut in half to fit in crock pot.  Covered pork with rootbeer (Barq's) and cooked on low for about 8 hrs.  Drained juice and poured Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce on to cover and continued to cook on low in crockpot for about 1 1/2 hr.  Husband and parents loved it, will definately fix again.

I used the cheap pork butt roast instead of tenderloin.  It turned out juicy and tasty.  I added Diana sauce instead of BBQ sauce.  I definitely wasn't the BEST pulled pork I've ever had, but it was certainty tasty!

I was hopeful about this recipe from all the rave reviews, but we didn't care for this. The pork tasted too much like root beer even after I had added spices before cooking and after mixing in bbq sauce. Won't make again.

I know this doesn't need anymore reviews but this is delicious!  The only "change" I made was after I shredded the pork I put the entire crock (mine is removable) in the oven at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes or so (just keep an eye on it).  This helped the pork get that oven roasted flavor and allowed some of the liquid to evaporate or soak in or something.

First time I have ever made pulled pork. Wow!! It was YUMMY!! I followed some of the others suggestions. I used a pork shoulder instead of a tenderloin and I rubbed the roast with garlic powder, salt and pepper before cooking. I put in slow cooker and poured root beer over it till it came up to halfway point on roast. I did not cover it in root beer as some other reviewers did as I read somewhere if you cover the meat in a crock pot with liquid then you are just boiling the meat, not braising it as it is supposed to be. I cooked it on low for 8 1/2 hours then took it out and shredded the meat....it was sooooo tender!!!I then emptied the liquid from the crock pot except for about 3/4 cup, put meat back in and added almost a whole bottle of Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty BBQ sauce and then cooked on low for another hour. Turned out perfectly!!! Other reviewers complained about it tasting like root beer, but I did not taste that at all. Just yummy BBQ pulled pork. I will definitely make this again.

I give 5 stars when the guests rave, the kids love it and people are still talking the next day! So moist and flavorful! I used a 10lb Boston Butt Pork Shoulder ($30). It barely fit in my 6qt crock pot. I filled it with Root Beer almost to the top. I was afraid it would spill over. Cook 8 hours total on high (fat side down, flip after 4 hours so fat is on top). Drain the root beer, scrape the fat off the top, then shredded the meat, add almost a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Brown Sugar and Hickory Sauce, let it sit on warm until ready to eat.  This made enough to serve a group of 35 people (with a few burgers and hotdogs as well). Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Such an awesome recipe! So easy. I used a pork shoulder and it was about 7lbs. I marinated it in the root beer in my slow cooker over night but I don't know if that made really any difference. I just did it so it was all ready for me to put on first thing in the morning. I cooked it on low for 9 hours. It was amazing! So juicy and tender. Will definitely make it over and over again! Thank you!

After reading some reviews, I did a little bit alteration.
I put pepper & Lawrys salt all over boneless pork shoulder (cheaper!). I didn't have root beer, so I used Dr. Pepper :-) I chopped some onions and garlic. Threw all of them in the crockpot. I added a little bit of BBQ sauce for taste (I love Baby Ray's and Kraft Original). After 5-6 hours, I shredded the pork with pork (so easy!), drained the liquid, added the BBQ sauce. SOOOOO GOOOD!!!! my 7 yr old son tried it and kept making "heemmm" sounds :)

Most important tip-use pork butt and save the liquid drained off after cooking. As it cools, the fat will rise to the top for easy disposal. Then you can easily add several spoonfuls of the liquid back into the shredded pork for flavor and to keep moist.  People said it was the best pulled pork they had ever had. No one could believe it was cooked in root beer

Really delish! My husband said this is the most moist pork he's ever had! We will be making it again. Plus, it was ridiculously easy to make.

Not a fan! Used A&W root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I had such high hopes for this after reading all of these glowing reviews.

So very tasty!!  Swapped root beer for an Alaskan Amber beer. This was amazing!  I drained the meat at about 5 hours and then shredded and put back in slow cooker with BBQ sauce.  This was so moist and tender!  Served it with Bebop baked beans and coleslaw from this site!

Type or root beer MATTERS!  First time i cooked pulled pork and i used a tenderloin.  it was so good i was going door to door to have neighbors try it.  trimmed the fat layer and forked the tenderloin, just about covered it with Barq's root beer then set the crock pot to low for about 7 hours.  drained it, shredded it, then put it back in with sweet baby rays bbq for another hour and a half.  Fantastic.    

a few weeks later i tried it again and the results were quite a bit different.  i hope to write a second review but in case i cant; i used a shoulder (butt) and A&W root beer, same process as above but results were not good at all.  funky taste.  

Super Sunday and i'm hoping to re-create my initial success.  using Barq's and sweet baby rays.  forked the tenderloin but kept the fat layer this time after watching a marathon of pit masters.  i plan to trim the fat after 7 hours or so right before shredding.  we'll see.  

i'm from the northeast and i'm not up on the various flavor profiles of bbq - all i can say is we really enjoyed the first batch and my family hopes my 3rd try is half as good as my first and we'll all be very happy.  go pats.

I use IBC Root Beer for my pulled pork and it is so good!  I've heard Dr. Pepper works as well but I have not personally tried it.  After I take the meat out, shred it and pour out the juices I put the meat back in the crock pot on low with bb-q sauce for about an hour.  I use enough sauce to evenly coat the meat.  Sweet Baby Ray's is the best BB-Q sauce too!  I use toasted Kaiser Rolls for sandwiches.  This is a hit with my family and friends.

I added Dr. Pepper instead of root beer, and also added some chopped onions on the bottom. Without the inions, it's just not the same.

This is really great!  Don't use diet soda, make sure you get a good quality root beer made with real sugar.  I used a can from Whole Foods.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  I made it exactly as described, except I added some seasonings like pepper.  Very delicious.

This was incredibly easy to make and excellent tasting.  I'm from the Georgia where nearly every city has a few BBQ places selling it's own version of pulled pork and this recipe is very similar to some of the better ones I've had.  I really like sweet BBQ but I would recommend not using a very sweet BBQ sauce since the root beer adds it's own sweetness.  Was a smash hit at a neighborhood BBQ.

This was really good and so easy to prepare.  Could could fool anyone into thinking that you cook since you were born.  I bought a 4 lb pork loin and a liter of root beer.  Rubbed the pork loin with salt, pepper,  a small amount of garlic and some liquid smoke.  Covered the it in the root beer and let it cook on low over night.  Before I went to work the next morning, drained the meat, pulled it apart and added the 1/2 a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's. then left instructions for my husband to take it out of the slow cooker in 1 hour.  When I came home from work that night I re-heated and served with corn on the cob and baked beans.  It was great and I had so much left over my boys used it in their lunches that whole week! I will definitely make this again, especially for a large group!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is so versatile in that you can cook the meat, shred and serve with different sauces.  I like sweet/spicy and my guys like vinegar based sauce.  I put the shredded pork on the table w/ the sauces and everybody does their own thing.

Awesome!! Rubbed pork tenderloin in garlic powder, salt, and black pepper before placing in crock pot. Cooked for 7 hours, then drained, pulled apart, and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce. Returned to slow cooker and cooked for an additional hour and a half. Melted in our mouths!

FANTASTIC!  I made it with the root beer and Bull's Eye Kansas City BBQ Sauce!  Myself and 2 adult sons loved it! The tenderloin is better because you don't have all of the fat!

Thank you so much! I've tried pulled pork in the crock pot before, but never had any success. We spent the day at the Western Washington Fair smelling all the good fair food and then came home and shredded the pork (I used a 2lb top loin I got on sale for $4) and then we could choose to serve plain or add sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce. Perfect for picky eaters! So good with freshly picked corn on the cob! Make this!

This is ridiculously easy which earns it a star. Other than that, it's kinda like a manwich, canned sloppy joe mush meat. I used a pork roast, served over toasted calabrese buns and topped with fresh apple coleslaw. I may try it again someday but the chances aren't good. If I did though, I think I'd ixnay the root beer in favour of some delicious broth I could concoct, get a little smoke in there.

I made this twice.  Once with the pork tenderloin.  It was okay but I found it a bit dry.  So I talked to my butcher and he suggested that I try it with a pork butt roast.  Holy cow, did it make a difference.  I used a 5 lb pork but roast and used enough A&W Root Beer to almost cover the roast.  I set the crock pot on low overnight.  Shredded the beef (super easy, just fell apart).  Then added 2 bottles of BBQ sauce, plus 1 cup of the drippings from the crock pot. Baked in the oven for 1 hour at 250 degrees.  It got rave reviews from everyone!  I will make this again!  One of the easiest things I have ever made.

So easy! Tonight I used a beef roast and Coke instead of root beer, since it's all I had, and original Diane Sauce. The beef was frozen straight out of the freezer, and I cooked it on high for about 8 hours, but more or less is fine, it's quite forgiving.

After shredding the beef, I put the sauce into a saucepan and thickened it with corn starch to make a thick gravy-like consistency.

I ladled some of the sauce on the bun, topped it with the beef shreds, then added more sauce then added the top of the bun.

Messy but SO good! This would also be fine using bread, like a hot-beef sammich!

I love pulled pork, but this is not very good at all. I grew up in the south and have made pulled pork a bunch of times, but thought I might try something different. Unless you love root beer so much that you want your pork to taste like it, I would avoid making this recipe.

This was excellent. Made as directed; used a 2lb Pork Loin and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  I did add 2 or 3 dashes of Cayenne just to add some spice.
Will definately make again and add to my permanent collection.
Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was unchanged by me and was fantastic. I made 20 lbs of tenderloin. I used the root beer as described and then finished the recipe off with Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce.

I used an 8 lb. pork butt, 1/2 2-liter A&W root beer, 1/2 Lg vidalia onion, 2 peeled garlic cloves, 2 Tbs worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbs Stubb's liquid smoke hickory flavor, 2 Tbs McCormick's barbecue seasoning,  2 Tbs Lawry's season salt, 8 turns fresh black pepper.  1 bottle Stubb's Original BBQ sauce, 1 bottle Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce.   I cooked the pork in a 6 Qt crock pot on low for 11 hours.  Took pork out to shred and debone ( I didn't have any fat to remove at all just a bone). Strained the marinade of onions and placed into a saucepan to reduce by half.  Added pork back to crockpot and then added the marinade reduction, 1 bottle of Stubb's Original BBQ sauce and 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce.  Cooked for another hour on low.  Everyone LOVED it.  Didn't taste like rootbeer when I tasted it before adding the BBQ sauce either.

I make this recipe, but I didn't have root beer, so I used a can of cola and a beer....even yummier!  I use this with company....buy 2 pork shoulders.  Then I put out 2-3 different BBQ sauces and some vinegar...it ALWAYS disappears!

I loved this, but I need to find a BBQ sauce that's more tangy than sweet - on top of the root beer, a sweet sauce is just a little too much for me.

HOLY WOW! This recipe is by far the best pulled pork I have tried. So very easy! I used a big hunk o pork (I think is was a pork shoulder, it was big and cheap). It had a thick layer of fat and a few bones but after cooking for 8 hours on low the fat came off in one piece and the bones simpley fell out. I didn't have any root beer so I used two cans of dr. pepper. I also seasoned my meat (salt, pepper, garlic salt, and tony's). I used 3/4 bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar bbq sauce.  All I can say is this recipe is awesome. Extremely tasty, inexpensive, and can feed a crowd.

I was looking for a great way to make pulled pork and this was a great starter recipe.  The idea is good.  I also added liquid smoke for that slow smoker taste that we get from the local barbeque restaurant.  SO glad I did! I also put a meat rub (All purpose meat rub from this site) onto the meat and placed it on top of the root beer/liquid smoke.  I cooked the meat for about 7 hours and turned it over halfway through.  When it was done I put Dinosaur Bar-B-Que Sensuous Slathering Sauce onto it.  I must say it was melt in your mouth delicious! We will be making this again and again and again...with the same changes!!!

This was not bad but not amazing either. I found it to be a bit odd tasting but I've had pork cooked in root beer before, so I don't think it's just that I didn't care for that. Used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I would have like the final sauce to be a bit more substantial, it was just completely liquid. Used a centre pork loin instead of tenderloin and I think this is a good cut for this kind of thing; not as expensive as a tenderloin (and gets super tender while cooking anyway) but not really fatty like a shoulder/butt cut. The meat was amazingly tender and moist, I just wasn't in love with the final dish. We ate it and will eat the leftovers but not sure I'll make this recipe again.

Most requested meal!  I use a Picnic roast (shoulder arm roast), and grind some garlic pepper on the outside prior to adding the Dr. Pepper, but other than that, I follow this recipe. With a fattier cut of meat, I think you spend a little extra time separating the veins of fat when you shred the meat, but it is so tender and so flavorful you won't be disappointed.  
Shared this with a friend who was hosting a college graduation party and she used it to serve bbq pork sliders.  She said it was the hit of the party.

I accidentally ended up w/ a 14 lb. pork shoulder and I slow cooked it for 11 hrs in A&M Root Beer. 
It was AWESOME..I also rubed salt and pepper on the pork b4 I started to cook it. Perfect recipe. Couldn't be easier than to forget about your cooking for a while.

If you don't rate this five stars, it's either because you forgot to drain the root beer (like I did the first time!) or you used the wrong barbecue sauce!  Thank you for this great, simple recipe!

Better than any bbq in town we have ever had! I also just bought a pork roast instead of a tenderloin. I salt and peppered it and then browned it in hot oil before I put in the crockpot. Served on whole wheat buns and with baked sweet potatoes and corn-on-the-cob!

The best bbq I've ever had!  This was my first attempt at making it and I'm in love!  I bought a 4 lb pork tenderloin on sale for $6.  I used half for another meal, and half for this bbq.  I used montgomery inn bbq sauce and added a little garlic powder.  I thought it needed something to balance the sweetness from the rootbeer and bbq sauce.

This was so easy to make and really good.  My son is a very picky eater.  He actually gags on most meat.  He ate two and 1/2 half of these last night for dinner.  Tonight he could not wait for dinner to be served so he ate two before my husband got home from work.  last night I chopped up some of the pork for sandwiches.  The rest I sliced for dinner tonight.  We all loved this recipe and I will make again very soon and double the recipe (at least) so I can share some and freeze some for later.  Thanks!!

Great recipe, very easy and flavorful.  I followed some tips from other reviewers.  I got a shoulder cut instead of pricey tenderloin.  Salted and peppered it before adding root beer.  Also cut slits and pushed 10 garlic cloves in a 2.7 lb cut of pork.  Started it fat side up, then halfway through I turned it over.  Salted and peppered the other side.  After 6.5 hours on low, I took it out and shredded it (it was so tender), drained the crock pot, added the shredded meat and bottle of bbq sauce back in the crock pot.  Let it cook another half hour.  It was so tasty.  The second day the root beer flavor came out even more.  I will definitely make this again!

The first time I made it, I used root beer and I could taste the root beer flavor.  The second time I made it I used a combination of cheap beer and broth, which was much better.  The meat is "fall of the bone" tender after cooking all day and it so good on toasted rolls.  My husband and I prefer a tangy barbecue sauce as opposed to the sweeter sauces.

I used a pork butt to make this. You can use any cut of meat. I was worried about the root beer making the pork too sweet... well I was wrong. I loved this recipe and have shared it with my family and friends. We did BBQ pork sandwiches the first day where we added our own BBQ and the next day we made pork tacos YUMMY! thanks!

This was very easy. The meat was tender. Previous reviewers were correct, the success of this dish depends on the quality of the barbecue sauce you use. As suggested by others, I used a pork butt, pierced it all over with a fork, then rubbed the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I made it the day before so the flavors would meld. Served it to a small gathering on seeded sandwich buns, along with condiments the individuals could add on their own: Pete's Red Hot, jalapenos, peperocinis, grated cheese & extra BBQ sauce. There were polite comments, but no raves.  I received more compliments on the broccoli slaw I served as a side. Will make again, but will experiment with seasonings & with making my own BBQ sauce.

This was really good and easy.  I was skeptical about using root beer, but it turned out great.  I used a boston butt, becasue the tenderloin is too expensive for this type of meal.  I also added, ketchup, a squirt of mustard, brown sugar and hot sauce and onion powder.  I let it crock for about 5 hours on high, then 2 more on low and it was so tender.  The meat shredded very easily and the taste of the sauce is phenomenal.  Use less brown sugar if you don't like a real sweet bbq sauce.  Great recipe

As written, this recipe is just okay.  Best thing about it is that it's EASY.  Used a 4.25 lb pork shoulder roast and good root beer.  Cooked in slow cooker on low for 8 hours, disposed of liquids in the pan, de-boned and skimmed fat from meat, then shredded.  Taste was rather bland...like plain cooked pork (go figure!).  Added 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce, 1 bottle of hoppy beer (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale), black pepper, chili powder, and ancho chili powder and let it cook for another hour.  MUCH better.  May have been better if we'd used a more misquite BBQ sauce, but this worked well, too.  At least 4 stars as modified...would make the same changes next time, and would make again.

How easy is this?!?!  Great recipe too.  This is a great meal for those busy nights when everyone coming in at different times.  I've even done it for camping trips. There's never any leftovers at my house, which is a bummer as I know it would be great the next day.  (I've got too many boys who keep going back for more) You can also sub Dr. Pepper or a regular cola.  Why mess too much with perfection?  Thanks Livie's Mammy!

Followed MegaG's suggestions.  I used a Butt Roast, slow-cooked on low for 6-7 hours, shredded and added BBQ Sauce then slow-cooked for another hour.  Served on toaster Kaiser rolls with coleslaw. Mmmmm!  Very tasty!

This was good and easy- served on Texas toast garlic bread.  I used a pork roast, not a tenderloin.  You'd have to be crazy to use a tenderloin in the crockpot!

This is super good just as it is, and so easy! My girls LOVE it!  Ok, here's my little customization: Like I said, wonderful right out of the crock pot, but I wasn't happy with the BBQ sauce I had on hand, plus I wanted it to taste more like it had come off the grill. So I took a sandwich portion, threw it onto a hot cast iron skillet and let it sort of caramelize, then splashed it with a little balsamic vinegar, hot sauce, and a teensy bit of brown sugar, put it on a toasted bun... OMG!! YUM!

This is SO good!  It's like roadside dining.  When giving out the recipe, people can hardly believe it's made with soda.  I use whatever soda I happen to have on hand, always excellent results.  And a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Ray makes it perfect.

My first time making pulled pork! I used a 1 1/2 lb. pork tenderloin (on sale for $5) and sprinkled it with a bit of garlic powder, salt & pepper before placing it in the slow cooker with the root beer. Cooked 5 1/2 hours before removing it (as it was falling apart, so tender) and shredding the meat. Placed shredded pork in the slow cooker with almost 2 cups of Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this website and cooked another hour. Delicious when served on a toasted bun! In my husband's words, "This is the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had". Right on!

This was so easy and delicious. I didn't change a thing and used sweet baby ray's hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce. Served with Sweet Restaurant Slaw from the site.

Tasted awesome!!  Pretty much kept the recipe exactly the same, just rubbed the pork down with some salt, pepper, and garlic for some flavor.  Highly recommend using Dinosaur BBQ Sauce with this if you can find it at your grocery store - best bbq sauce on the planet, made right here in Syracuse, NY!!  Also, definitely use the Reynolds Slow Cooker bags - the sugar from the soda carmelizes on the side of the slow cooker, making for a miserable cleanup - the bags make cleanup a breeze....will make this again and again!!

Very easy and my finicky husband wants me to make it for friends coming over for the Super Bowl.  Didn't have root beer (I don't like it) so used Pepsi instead and as I said my husband even liked it.  Will use pork roast next time because of the cost but had the tenderloin at the time so used it.

I used a 4 lb pork shoulder and a can of beer as I didn't have root beer.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours and the meat just fell off the bone.  After draining out the beer and shredding the pork I put it back in the crock pot with most of a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce so that there was some for those that wanted extra sauce.  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. There's hardly any left.  I'm thinking of making this for a pot luck next week.  Super easy and super yummy!

I want to add a twist to this recipe.  I make mine with the cheapest pork roast/butt/shoulder I can find.  I remove the bone. Seasoned to taste and then I soak the pork in a 2 liter bottle of rootbeer (cheapest one I can find) overnight.  Then cook the pork as directed in the crockpot the next day. Drain rootbeer completely.  Shred the pork.  Add your favorite BBQ sauce and slow cook for another hour.  DELICIOUS

Why would you want pork to taste like rootbeer? I thought this cooking method might be something special because of the great reviews but all you really get is rootbeer flavored pork, and the BBQ sauce doesn't hide that flavor even after rinsing the pork when I took it out of the pot. The 3lb pork tenderloin was moist after 6 hours but next time I'll try another cooking method. This isn't worth a repeat.

I made this pork for dinner tonight and everyone loved it.  I think the root beer gives the meat a great flavor, but it isn't over-powering. The only change I made was that I threw in half an onion because it was in the fridge and I needed to use it up.  I served the pork on dinner rolls with baked french fries on the side.  I will def. make this one again...it's super simple and dinner is ready when you get home from work!

I seasoned my pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder and some Montreal Seasoning.  Let it marinade in the fridge for 2 days (not on purpose), just running as usual.  I actually had a big piece, about 5 1/2 lbs., so I doubled the amount of root beer.  I cooked it for about 6 hours and drained it and added a 19 oz. bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and one of Sweet Baby Ray's.  I got the smoky taste of the JD and the Sweetness of the SBJ.  It was just wonderful!  This one will be added to the rotation for sure!  Thank you Lori.

The root beer made the pork so sweet, it was almost inedible. I even tried to cut the sweet with vinegar and hot sauce, but it was all I could taste. The pork was very tender though, I think I'll just use water and a spice rub on the pork in the future.

This was great AND super easy--I loved it! I actually forgot to thaw the pork and threw it in FROZEN, it was perfect in about 9-10 hours. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, thanks to the rave reviews, and it was delicious. I'll make this often!

This is the best pulled pork recipe.  It's very easy to make but tastes like you spent all day working on it.  Some suggestions: I like using Reynolds slow cooker liners to make things even EASIER, Baby Rays BBQ sauce and MUG root beer. Also, I use the last hour to  switch the slow cooker to HIGH and thats when I drain the excess juices, shred the meat and add the BBQ;  this makes the sauce a little thicker.  This recipe is definitely on my top 10 and real crowd pleaser.  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

My family loved it,  and went back for seconds.  They even wanted it the next night for dinner.  I coated it in barbeque sauce,  added a few spices, garlic, Worcestershire Sauce for a bit of a bite,  and mixed it all together.  I should have trimmed some of the fat off as the sauce was a bit on the fatty side for me.  At first the idea of adding root beer was kind of strange but being that so many thought it was great, as they say "When in Rome..."

This turned out so well! The only change I made to the recipe was that I used a 5+ lb. pork shoulder roast in lieu of the tenderloin, and I added about 1/2 c. of bbq sauce to the slow cooker. It is dreamy! Moist, flavorful, and esp. good doused with your favorite bbq sauce. I will make this all summer long!

Delicious!  I used a 4lb pork loin, which cooked for about 5 hours before I pulled it apart. The hardest thing about this recipe is getting it out of the crock pot - it's so tender, it falls to pieces!

I love that this is a lower fat version of pulled pork...  The root beer made it almost too sweet so I made it the second time using 1 can of chicken broth instead.  It turned out wonderful!!

This was a great super simple recipe.  It will most likely become a staple item on our menus.  We went with Longhorn Honey BBQ sauce and I loved it.  My husband really liked it too though he would like me to use a sauce with a little kick to it.  Try this one out if you haven't already!

Root Beer?! Ahh - yes. Root Beer. You don't really taste it, but it does give it tones of smokiness. Very good recipe. I followed it exactly and it turned out wonderful. My mother in law (who is not overly generous with compliments) said it was excellent. Next time I might add some onions and peppers, just to give it some texture. But overall, extremely easy and very good. Definitely will make again.

This was soo good!! My husband, who isn't a fan of bbq, loved it and so did my 5 year old. Changes I made: poked holes in the pork and rubbed a little salt and pepper before adding the root beer. Drained the pork an hour before serving it, shredded it a bit and added 1/2 of the bbq sauce. I cooked it on high for the last hour. I finished shredding it and added the rest of the bbq sauce before serving. I served this on Kaiser rolls.

I made this for dinner on Saturday.  Started the pork loin in the morning and it was fork tender by dinnertime.  Super simple to make and very tasty.  My husband added cheese to his sandwiches, but I had mine plain, and both of us loved it!  Thanks!!

THE BEST!  Definitely use a pork butt (shoulder) instead of pork loin.  Way cheaper, way more flavorful and WAY more moist and tender.  I slice up an onion and put it on the bottom of the slow cooker.  Season the meat with salt and Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic and put it in cooker.  Use just enough root beer so that it comes about half way up the pork.  Turn half way through cooking if you can.  Take out the meat and shred.  Pour most of the liquid out of the crock.  Put the meat back in and let it soak up remaining juices.  Everyone tops off their sandwich with whatever bbq sauce they prefer.  Before putting all the meat back in the cooker, I reserve about half of the meat and freeze.  Makes a great base for taco filing.  To make tacos, I add garlic, oregano, cumin, cilantro and lime juice.  Great for tacos and quesadillas.

Like others have written, tenderloin is not the best cut for this, but it still came out well.

I cooked it for 6hr 15min, made a Carolina style barbecue sauce and put homemade slaw on top.

I was so skeptical of this recipe because of how simple it is...but boy did it deliver! No additions or changes from the original recipe. Used pork loin and Foxon Park Root Beer, then used Jack Daniels original sauce. Cooked it overnight in my crockpot on low - 10hrs. Shredded it and drained some of the leftover root beer. Added in the bbq sauce, mixed well and let it sit in the fridge like that all day while I was at work. Came home to some serious melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork! Next time I make it I plan to use pork shoulder or pork butt - I think a fattier meat will be a smidge tastier. I also plan to use Sweet Baby Ray's instead of JD. A++!

This recipe was awesome!! My family loved it!! I did use a pork roast as it was on sale and only cost me $6 for a three pound roast. I cooked as directed once it was done I removed the one small bone. Then I removed the roast from the crock and placed in a large bowl. I used my hand mixer to shred the meat as this method only took me about one minute vs using a fork for about 5 min. I poured the juice from the crock into a nonstick pot added a bit more BBQ sauce and the shredded meat, simmered until it thickened up. I served on a seeded bun with coleslaw with French fries as the side! I had plenty left over so I used a silicone mini loaf pan, filled with meat then froze overnight, and then transferred to a gallon Ziploc freezer bag. Now we have pulled pork on hand for school lunches or my husband a quick meal. This is also great as a BBQ baked potato!!

I seasoned my 6.68 pound "shoulder butt" roast with Lawery's poultry rub, stabbing the roast with a small knife then generously rubbing this stuff over the entire surface.  Put the rubbed roast in the crock pot, added a can and a half of Pepsi since that's what lives in our house!  The fluid level was about half way up the roast.  It went on low all night and the next morning it was so tender I thought I'd missed the meat and was stabbing air!  I let it cool while I woke up with a couple cups of coffee, then removed the bone from the meat and poured everything through a colendar, saving the juices in a large bowl.  I'm so glad I did this.  The eventually de-fatted broth tasted like "Au Jus" from a perfect standing rib!  The meat itself was beautifully seasoned and was great as it was, but I went ahead and did half of it with  Sweet Baby Ray's and some of the broth as directed.  It didn't take as much sauce because the meat was so well seasoned already.  The saved meat went into the freezer for future use...the rest did Christmas "lunch" with family...make your own sandwich on home baked sour dough bread.  We were happy campers.  I'm so thrilled with the way this turned out.  I'm afraid I'll never again achieve this perfect balance of seasoning, so I'm going to savor every drop of the broth while I can!  I hope to try this "cooking method" on other cuts of meat.  Thanks for this recipe!  And all the variations from reviewers, too! There's a lot of room to play with this!

Have made this different times with cherry coke, regular coke and root beer. Always turns out great. I used Famous Dave's Devil's Spit bbq sauce as we like it hot. Last time I used 3 pork loin filets.

SO easy. SO good. The husband and I devoured this. We just used a regular pork loin instead of the tenderloin. We wanted the extra fat for flavor :) This was some of the most tender, saucy and flavorful pulled pork we've ever had!

Soooooo yummy! We used a pork shoulder as others suggested and then I just took the fat off the pork after I drained the root beer and before shredding the meat. We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce which was perfect. Then I made a vinegar based cole slaw to go inside the sandwiches using a broccoli slaw mix, some extra shredded carrots and a couple tbsp. of chopped red onions. The sauce was 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup red wine vinegar, 2 tsp. of sugar and a tbsp. and a half of poppy seed dressing. The tangy flavor was perfect with the sweet bbq sauce!!

Absolutely delicious and totally easy!
I used a 1.8kg pork shoulder and a bottle of root beer (591mL).
Poked holes in the top and bottom and let it cook overnight.
Drained it when I got up and put it back in the slowcooker, then removed the skin and bones. Shredded it up with a fork, then mixed in the barbecue sauce and cooked it on low for another hour.
Definitely going to make this again.

Made this for a holiday pot luck last year and it was so popular I am being asked to make it again this year.  It is so easy.  The root beer tenderizes the meat so it falls apart even before you pull it. Everyone loves it!

I know many folks don't like someone to rate a recipe when they've changed it, but I think it's the beauty of Allrecipes that one can read suggestions/tweaks etc. and see how it turns out.  I took the suggestion about using a Boston butt, laying in on onions, cooking it over night and rubbing the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Oh yeah, and the one that suggested covering the whole meat with the root bear.  All suggested from various people.  Thanks!  It turned out super!  I had never made it before and fed 27 people who really enjoyed it.

I made this for supper last night and we loved it!  Boneless pork tenderloin was on sale, so I managed to get two for about $7 at my local Sobeys store.  I rubbed the meat with salt, pepper and a bit of garlic powder and placed them in the slow cooker. I used a bottle of Jones' root beer as it's sweetened with cane sugar.  I set the slow cooker on low for exactly 5 hours, then drained the liquid, shredded the pork and added in a bottle of BBQ sauce.  I used the "No Limits" BBQ sauce, which Sobeys introduced this year.  Has a nice flavour to it.  Set the crock back on low for an hour and it turned out perfectly!  It made A LOT of meat since I used two tenderloins, so tonight we're using the leftovers for Pulled Pork tacos!  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

This was great and it was soooo easy.  I used all natural root beer and put the barbecue sauce in the last hour of cooking.  I put it on hamburger buns and topped it with coleslaw from allrecipes with dried cranberries mixed in.  So delicious!

Used a 4.25lb boneless pork shoulder, slightly trimmed of fat. Cooked 10 hours on low in 2 cans of Dr. Pepper, flipping halfway through. Drained, removed fat, shredded, and dumped a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's in and cooked on low for another hour. Served 5 hungry ladies (sliders, 2 per person) with 4-5 servings for leftovers! Perfect, easy, foolproof.

We LOVED this recipe. Easily the most amazing thing I've ever made in my crock pot. I know people hate it when others don't follow the recipe exactly and then rate it, but here's what I did. Bought a 4 lb bone-in pork shoulder, seasoned generously with salt and pepper, placed in the crock pot with a slow cooker liner on low with 1 liter of Mug root beer. Turned it over every 3 hours until the meat broke away easily with a fork (about 7 hours with the last 2 hours being on high). Took it out of the soda, dumped the soda out, removed the bone, and shred the meat. Put the shredded meat back in the crock pot with 1-1/2 bottles of our favorite BBQ sauce, let it sit on low for 1/2 hour, served it on toasted buns with cheese. INCREDIBLE.

Easy and was very good.  Only thing I changed was I used the pork butt and it slid right off the bone.  No reason to spend more money for tenderloin.

I followed the recipe almost exactly but used pork shoulder per others' suggestions. It was laborious removing the fat BUT so worth it! I used Trader Joe's barbecue sauce and my boyfriend said this was the best pulled pork he'd ever had and the best thing I'd ever made. Now I have something to live up to!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband loved it.  I changed the soda to Dr. Pepper because that's what I had on hand.  It was easy, it fell apart, and it tasted delicious.  I'll be keeping this in my recipe box!

My family loves this pulled pork dish. I've prepared it several times and it's a crowd pleaser.  I always use pork shoulders and rub some garlic salt and pepper onto it before pouring on the root beer.  Also, I've found that bone-in pork shoulders allow a  little bit of bone marrow flavor to seep into the pork.....Yum

Nothing much to add to other reviews, but I do use mostly tenderloin for this because it is done faster and has less fat to trim off.  I usually double the recipe, do it for 4 hours on high, then drain the excess liquid and add the BBQ sauce and cook for awhile longer.  We like Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  One of our latest favorites for just family or double for a larger crowd.

Like most everyone on here, I read all of the reviews before making this recipe. I used a 3 lb pork shoulder, and 2 cans of root beer instead of one because I read that the more meat that was covered with liquid, the better. I cooked it on low for 10 hours, while I was at work. When I got home, I drained it, pulled the pork, added it back to the crock pot and smothered it w/ bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays Chipotle). Okay... I love to cook, and I love food, but this was probably one of the worst things I've ever made. I could not get that root beer flavor out of the smell of the meat or the taste of the meat for anything! I gave it two stars b/c my 9 year old son absolutely loved it! So I'm sure it's just a matter of taste preference, but I thought it was horrible! I brought it to work today for a potluck, and I'm really hoping everyone else likes it as much as my son, but I will not be making this with root beer again. I think next time I'll try some chicken or beef broth or something... anything... else. Sorry for being negative about it, but I read a lot of reviewers that said they couldn't taste the root beer at all, and I just had to put my two cents in ;)

This was the BOMB. Hands down, restaurant quality pulled pork.  I made this over the weekend for my family with a few small changes.  I used a 5.5lb pork shoulder because in my opinion, it's more tender & flavorful than pork tenderloin. I left the fat on while the meat cooked to keep all the flavor in. Once it was finished cooking, I peeled the fat off.  I used a half a liter of Mugs Root beer. I put in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours, turning it once halfway through. After the 8 hour mark, the meat was so tender, I could barely get it out of the slow cooker to drain the liquid without the shoulder falling apart. I peeled the fat off, put it back in the cooker, pulled the  meat apart (WITH EASE) & I let it cook in the sauce for another hour. I used a bottle & a half of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, since my family likes sweet bbq sauce. This is SOO GOOD.. I will definitely be making this again. I'll throw onions in the crock pot with the meat next time.!!!!

This is amazing. Who would have thought root beer - which I really dislike - would create such a wonderful pork dish! I used pork loin the first few times. I'm going to try other cuts as well. Sweet Baby Rays sauce is our choice.

I have made this now twice- once as a trial run, and the other for a large family reunion.  Each time, everyone has raved about it and wanted the recipe.  It is a big hit, and could not get any easier!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely amazing with any kind of pork you use. The first time I made it I followed the recipe using a small pork tenderloin and a can of beer. FANTASTIC. Then I used a 4 lb picnic pork shoulder with two cans of beer for a party. I let it slow cook on low for about 9 hours overnight. After shredding it and adding a bottle of BBQ sauce it was OUTSTANDING! I got so many compliments. Will definitely make this again (and again and again). So easy and so delicious

WOW! There are no other words needed to describe this recipe. I used a 6.5 lb pork butt roast that I had seasoned with minced garlic, onion powder and pepper overnight in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap. I used 2  Aldis canned rootbeer. Cooked it in the crock pot for 7 hours on low and about an hour on high. 

There was not much pulling of the pork as it was literally falling apart just trying to get it out of the crockpot. 

Drained the liquid from the CP and put the pork back in with 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Rays Brown Sugar and Hickory. 

Hubby says he never wants store bought pulled pork again which is huge as he usually doesn't like my cooking lol!

This is good, but I too use shoulder/butt, the fat makes the juice, not to mention, better flavor..I like to cut up an onion and put slices at the bottom of the slower cooker, then add shoulder, and then whatever you like to flavor it with..

I work two jobs and am also the only one who cooks in my home. Made this recipe on a VERY busy day. I used a 6 pound pork butt because it was on sale and used Baby Rays barbecue sauce because it was on sale. I used a liter bottle of root beer to cover the meat. Cooked for 6 hours, drained shredded, added bbq sauce and cooked 4 more hours. When shredding the meat I removed any fat. It made 10 LARGE sandwiches for about a dollar a sandwich. In this economy I'm always trying to save money without skimping too much. This recipe was great and freed up my time to get what I needed done. The meat was tender and flavorful. Everyone loved it.

Super good! I have made it now with both pork shoulder and pork tenderloin.  I shred the meat and take out the fat as i go cuz I hate the feeling of biting into fat.  The pork shoulder had more fat so it was more work to remove all of it but the tenderloin (depending on sales etc.) is more expensive.

This is a great recipe.  
I basically prepare it the same way, but
I use the Pork Shoulder as mentioned in a previous review, Cream of Soda instead of the Rootbeer.
I also add abt. 1 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar and 3/4 cup of pancake syrup in addition to the Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce.
Give it a try!!!!

Cooked 10 hours on low, drained, shredded, added BBQ (Big Al's from this site), 1 more hour on low.  Served with mini slider buns for a work potluck.  People could not stop raving.

I've never made pulled pork bc i thought it would be hard.  Wow! Thtis was sooo easy and soooo yummy.  My 8 yr old twins both had three sandwiches!  And even my three year asked for seconds!  The meat is perfect, i wouldn't recommend substituting.  I will make this again and again!

This is so easy and delicious.  I've told quite a few friends the recipe and they keep waiting for more ingredients.   Skeptical, they try it.   Yummy!     I try to use Root Beer made with cane sugar - that's my only change.   :)

I was not very impressed with this.  The heated root beer had a very weird smell and it was not pleasant to me. I will not be making it again.  I am going to try maybe a broth recipe.  It was just not for me.

This was amazing! My husband loved it as well. Here's what I did different:

Rubbed salt, pepper, and garlic salt on the tenderloin before I put it in the crock pot. I had to use 3 cans of soda to cover it really well, but I still had to turn it a couple of times. I cooked it for 5 hours, dumped the soda, shredded the pork, mixed it with some BBQ sauce (Famous Dave's) and then cooked it for another hour. Tasted wonderful! Will have to make this again!

So easy and delicious.  I made it for a Super Bowl party and it was such a hit that I shared the recipe on my blog.   I used Stubb's BBQ sauce to give a kick to the sweet root beer.  Thanks.

My family loved this recipe.  I was a little concerned as I have never even tried root beer, so had no idea how it was going to work in a recipe.  But this really was so good, I will certainly be making this recipe again.

LOVED. Used butt per recommendation from my butcher. Followed exact recipe otherwise. I use Sweet Baby Rays Sauce and the only thing I want to figure out is how to add a touch of smokiness flavor.  The texture and flavor was perfection.

Not really sure that the soda made much difference, but it did taste very good.  I used Dr. Pepper 10 and Kraft Honey BBQ Sauce.  Yummy!

Dead easy and awesome!!  Followed the recipe only because I had Pork Tenderloin (it was on sale).  Once it was cooked and "shredable", I drained the crock pot, shredded the pork, added the kids favourite bbq sauce, simmered again for about an hour.  Served on buns with coleslaw and it was awesome!!  Definitely a hit in our house.

I've already made this recipe twice before, and am making it again tonight. The first time I used pork, but   because one of my family members doesn't eat pork, I wanted to try this using boneless, skinless chicken breast. It takes more bbq sauce than the pork, but still amazing. I used Kraft Chick'n Rib for the sauce. EVERYBODY loved it, and got seconds.

Really good and super easy! Based on other reviews I also shredded the meat, added sauce, and let sit in crock pot about an hour and a half before serving.  Also used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin.  When my picky 5YO ate two, I knew it was a keeper!

I used pork shoulder instead of pork tenderloin, it's just cheaper. I added garlic powder, pepper flakes, ground black pepper to mine. Next time, I'll add a bay leaf. Cooked it in my rice cooker....easy as pie. This was a BIG hit at a Potluck Dinner that I attended! I will make this again for sure....thanks for the recipe.

I ditto many reviews here - this pulled pork was made for a group of 15 (I doubled the recipe and it was perfect) and I used pork shoulder for a bit more fat. I didn't rub any seasoning on the pork at any time, and the only thing I did to ensure the root beer was fully soaked in by the pork was to "stab" the pork with a prong. I also turned it once in the middle of the 7 hours. Plus, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (original recipe) works GREAT on this stuff!

We were hesitant making this after reading some of the reviews stating it tasted too much like like root beer. But, to be honest, we didn't taste it at all. This was our very first pulled pork recipe and we loved it!

I prepared this recipe today, for the first time in my Dutch Oven. What a fantastic recipe to induct one into the world of slow-cooking! :) I started out at 350F but gradually lowered to 250 so it wouldn't burn. Having never done this sort of cooking before, I had to 'wing it'. I kinda lost track of time as it was in the oven for 9 hours total, but it tastes fantastic! (Made my own BBQ sauce too!)

this recipe, while easy to make, was so blah and nothing special that I wouldn't even bother to make it again. The root beer just added a weird taste, and it didnt make the meat any more tender than if I had used water. I will give it a "meh".

Great taste and not terrible for you!  You really don't need to fat from the other cuts of pork; tenderloin worked great!  I didn't taste the root beer, tho.

This is really so good and so simple.  The first time I made it I used a brown sugar bbq sauce, but that was just too much sweet.  The second time (for guests) I used Sweet Baby Ray's original.  It was fabulous.  I served it on slider buns with coleslaw.  It was a big hit with guests.

This is SOOOO good. I either use pork shoulder or butt  and I use sweet baby ray's brown sugar bbq sauce for the sauce.Once I shred it, I try to pick most of the fat globs out.

I, like some of my fellow reviewers, just couldn't stomach the overbearing root beer taste. Yes, it did make the meat very tender but even with the BBQ sauce added (and with the root beer drained about 30 minutes prior to being done), my husband and I could both still taste that sweetness...and we didn't like it. I prefer recipes where the BBQ sauce actually cooks with the meat. I'll stick with those.

Finally a pulled pork recipe I LOVE!  I've tried two other recipes and have been disappointed.  Hubby and kids even loved it.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original barbeque sauce.  I also used a pork roast and not a tenderloin. Awesome! Awesome! and oh sooooo easy.

I have made this recipe a few times now following the recipe given and it has turned out wonderful every time! My husband is a picky eater and he LOVED IT!! Its quick and easy with almost no prep time which is great since I have a very active 10 month old to keep up with. It is also fairly inexpensive with such few ingredients so I usually make a lot. It tastes wonderful even as leftovers!!

Not a bad idea. I used pineapple soda instead with a couple of onions and a cup of bbq sauce. Turned out pretty good.

Super easy and very good! I as well don't use pork tenderloin when doing a dish in the slow cooker. Buy a cheaper cut of meat; you don't need the tenderloin when it tenderizes in the slow cooker all day.

OMG! Thanks so much for this recipe. Excellent. I cooked the meat in IBC Rootbeer all day. Coated the meat with salt, pepper, garlic salt as suggested. Turned the meat half way through after about 4 hours. Then when finished drained the juice and shredded the meat and then added baby rays hickory and brown sugar BBQ sauce. Allowed it simmer in pot for awhile. My kids loved it! Had 2nds. Great recipe and comments. Thank you. Will make again for sure.

Great recipe and super easy.  I used a 1 pound tenderloin, so it only needed to cook on low for about 5 hours, and then added Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce.  So delicious and tender!

I would have made this years ago if I knew it was this easy.  The only thing I did different was I used diet root beer b/c that's all I have.  I used the tenderloin and wouldn't change that b/c I don't like dealing with gobs of fat.  I'll be making this often.

I loved the subtle flavor the rootbeer gave the pork. I also liked using a tederloin which is much leaner than a pork rost. I used the original Jack Daniel's No. 7 BBQ Sauce and made the "Tasty Buns" recipe from this site to make the buns I served it on (also easyP. My family really liked it and it was SO EASY!!! You can adjust the flavor based on the sauce/spice you like. I followed the directions exactly and it was tender and flavorful! Oh, I used Mugs rootbeer.

I cooked this recipe following the recipe exactly except for using pork shoulder rather than tenderloin. For the root beer I used Barqs and for the BBQ Sauce I used Sweet Baby Rays. The result was fantastic! It made a ton of food and we had plenty to freeze and it turned out yummy even after being frozen and warmed up! I highly recommend this recipe. It is my go to pulled pork recipe :)

This recipe is awesome! I made it for a potluck at work and it was the first thing to go. I used boston pork butt instead of tenderloin. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

DOne this recipe twice and found it is a winner! Simple and the easy to make. My only recommendation is to use a Root Beer with real sugar, it is a notable difference than when used with a root beer with High Fructose Corn Syrup.

Good and easy! I didn't have any Root Beer, so I used Pepsi. I used a pork shoulder and rubbed it down with some salt, pepper and garlic. I poured 1 can of Pepsi over the top. It was not enough to cover it (don't know if that makes a difference or not). I was home, so I flipped it halfway through cooking. I cooked it on low for about 7 hours. Once I drained the Pepsi out, I added some BBQ sauce and let it cook for another 30 minutes or so. It was very moist...not dry at all. I definitely prefer smoked pulled pork, but this is a great substitute (and half the effort).

I decided to go with a pork shoulder to the meat would shred easier. Great choice! I also used a can of diet root beer....because it was all I had :) I checked on the meat after 5 hours and I wish I had checked maybe 30 mins before that. So, I know it says to cook it for 6-7 hours on low but I definitely recommend checking it way before that! Overall, the meat was still tender and full of flavor. I will FOR SURE make this again! :-) 
Now, time to enjoy my sandwich!

This was definitely a winner! I did make a couple of changes. I used a boneless pork roast. I made a rub of sea salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder that I applied liberally to the pork roast and I marinated it in root beer over night in the fridge. In the morning I took it out of the fridge, let it come to room temperature, poured more root beer in the crock pot (just to cover the meat entirely) and then put it on low.  Served it on lightly toasted potato bread rolls.  Very good!

I'm eating this as I type, it is sooooooo delicious! My 17 yr old brother and my husband both described it as delicious. I didn't have root beer so like a previous poster I used regular beer and it turned out awesome. I will definitely make again!

I thought the root beer helped keep flavor in the pork, straight water seems to wash it out.  I don't like root beer so I was skeptical about using it.  I will make this again, will probably make my own sauce next time!

The root beer really tenderized the meat but didn't add any flavor. Next time I would add powdered garlic or onion to the recipe. Everyone thought the meat was really tender. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. The sauce will make you love or hate this recipe.  However, I recently tried the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue recipe from this site and everyone like this recipe more...it had more flavor.  So I guess I won't make this one again...sorry.

The best! Just don't add too much of the pork stock back after you pulled the pork, it tends to make everything a little mushy.

I make this often, as it is so good.  Definitely follow the advice of others about using the shoulder cut and shredding it in BBQ sauce about 2 hours before it is done.

I have made this several times and it's always a crowd pleaser! I have used tenderloin every time, except for just now when I used a shoulder butt. I just stirred in the BBQ sauce and have to say it looks really greasy and mushy, unlike using the tenderloin. I think the tenderloin also gives more usable meat, whereas there was a lot of waste with the shoulder butt. I think it's worth it to spend a few more dollars for better meat! I'm sure it will still be tasty, though!

Made this tonight and got rave reviews from my family! It was incredibly tender and the root beer gave it a really great flavor. I decided not to mix the bbq sauce in with the meat because I liked the taste so much. I just put a little sauce on the bun when I served it. As for the meat, I'd stick with tenderloin - it's less fatty than other cuts of pork and the texture is really smooth. Will definitely make this one again!

My family loved this and so did I. So easy to make and such a flavorful dish. I switched to a less expensive meat under the adivce of previous reviews, using the Boston butt instead. The smallest at the grocery store at the time was 5.87lbs, so I had to use more ingredients. About 2/3 of a 2 liter bottle of A&W root beer (enough to almost completely submerge the meat in my slow cooker) and 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce [Sweet & Spicy, Hickory & Brown Sugar (18 fl oz each)]. Before placing in the slow cooker on low for 10 and 1/2 hours (I prepped this before bed), I trimmed the fat and pricked the meat (for absorbing some of the flavors and releasing some fat), rubbing a mixture of a tablespoon each of the following: cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, chili powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt. After draining, I shredded the pork, added the sauces, and returned to the slow cooker for another hour. Perfect. Served on warm buns to an eager family on Independence Day!

This is an excellent recipe.  I added an sliced onion to the crockpot when I began cooking.  Just a preference of mine.  I've cooked pork in colas before, but the root beer was something new and I had it on hand so thought I'd try it.  To those expecting some flavor from it that were disappointed, I think the carbonated drinks have more of a tendency to affect the tenderness of the meat rather than add flavor.  It came out very good.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce (my favorite) and it was delicious.  I don't think there is much difference between using root beer or some type of cola.  Tasted the same.  I agree that using a pork tenderloin for this dish is a waste of money.  Buy a cheap cut!!!  That's what the slow cooker is for.

MegaG, you are right on.  Boston shoulder is the best cut to use, not a tenderloin.  There's not enough fat in it.  This is very similar to how I make carnitas, except O put cilantro, dried chilies, garlic, jalapeno, etc. in with the Coke, or Pepsi.  Root beer sounds yummy.  I'll have to try that version if I can manage to keep the root beer around ling enough. And Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce is the best.  I like the brown sugar honey one.

I used this recipe with a 6lb bone-in pork shoulder because I was feeding a group of 8 (including 2 hungry teenage boys). The pork fell right off the bone and shredded beautifully.  I served it as sliders on Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Best pulled pork ever - the root beer really does make all the difference.

SOOOOO fantastic! I used two cans of root bear because I have a rather large crock pot and the one can didnt even cover half the  tenderloin. It was so good my husband and my 3 year old loved it. I have a recipe for root beer baked beans I may have to try with it next time too!!

A friend from work shared this recipe with me. I made it for the first time this week. The root beer tenderizes the pork to the point where it melts in your mouth. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce which has just the right balance of sweet and spicy. I serve creamy cole slaw on top of the pork for an added kick!

So easy and so, so good.  We use pork sholder because it's cheaper.  This tastes great hot or cold, and it is a great dish to bring to someones potluck or BBQ

I used a two pound pork roast, and cooked it on high for 4.5 hours. I used about 1/3 of a two-liter bottle of root beer. I am not a fan of root beer so the smell while it was cooking was a little off putting to me. Thankfully, the barbecue sauce remedied that issue and enchanced the root beer flavor. My husband loves root beer so I made this for him! Serving it on King's Hawaiian sandwich rolls.

YUM!! Used a 5 lb boston butt, Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet 'n Spicy BBQ sauce, and 2 cans of A&W root beer in my 6 qt slow cooker. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Best pulled pork I've ever had!

The pork itself was kind of plain and boring after being slow cooked for 8 hours. All the flavor came from the bbq sauce I Mixed in. I was hoping to have shredded pork that had some good taste by itself. I will continue to look for other recipes.

EXCELLENT!  Just as "favabeens" did, I used a pork shoulder and Bullseye Original BBQ sauce.  After shredding, draining, and adding the bbq sauce, I cooked another hour.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I had invited guests and everyone loved it!  This recipe is a keeper!   Thank you Livie's Mammy for sharing your EXCELLENT recipe!!

Great!! I also cooked (3) pork shoulder, however I used a commercial slicer instead of pulling. Leaving what little fat that was left, in. Served at a block party, people that ate it looked me up to compliment. The funny thing is I smoke all my pork. When I told them I slow cooked in a roaster with root beer they all had a good laugh.  Thanks for a great web site!!!!

MMMmm!!  I used 2-lb. Boston butt with a bone in, like another reviewer suggested, as it's cheaper. The cut has just the right amount of fat in it.

I found that I had to add another bottle of A&W root beer to bring the liquid level up (my crock pot is gigantic). I turned the pork over a few times, and it was completely falling apart after 5.5 hours.

After draining the rootbeer, I topped it with local Climax moppin' and soppin' sauce (which I was initially apprehensive about). So juicy, tender and delicious!!

I used pork shoulder with great success. I also added 4 strips of bacon which I later chopped into the mix of pulled pork and Jack Daniel's Honey BBQ. FANTASTIC!

This was SO good! I used a 3lb tenderloin, 32oz of root beer, and seasoned with garlic salt & pepper. I also put in some big chunks of onion. The pork was just falling APART, it was that tender! I used some of the juice to thin my sauce down a bit, and added some brown sugar.  Pork so good, makes you wanna slap yo' mama!  I will totally make this again!

This message is for the person who cooked a 6 pound pork roast in six hours but the recipe didn't turn out.  Instead of cooking the roast too long, it sounds like it wasn't cooked long enough.  I cooked a 2.5 pound tenderloin for six hours and it was tender and delicious.  If you use a larger piece of meat, you will need to cook it longer.  Six pounds will probably take at least 12 hours to cook.  Also, make sure that you increase the rest of the ingredients.

This was delicious. I made it with a 5lb boston butt, used one can of root beer and about 8 oz of water.  Then added Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce...DELICIOUS!  Definitely a favorite recipe now!

This was amazing! I am not a big fan of BBQ, but my family is, so I decided to make it. I used a can and a half of pepsi to three pounds of pork shoulder. I cooked on low around 5-6 hours. I pulled the meat out, drained and shredded it, and put it back in the slow cooker. I added BBQ sauced and cooked on low for one more hour. My kids, ages 7, 4, and 20 months loved it! My husband loved it too, and I have a family of picky eaters. Will definitely make this again. It was so tasty and tender.

This was awesome and easy. I shared this with same friends and they couldn't believe how easy it was. Cooked the pork for 6 and a half hour in root beer and an additional hour in Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce. It melted in my mouth.

Very good.  I changed the recipe around by using pork shoulder instead of a pork tenderloin and added an extra bottle of root beer.  Very delicious!

I couldn't believe how good the rootbeer made the meat taste.  I could have ate it just the way it was before adding the BBQ sauce. 
It was such a huge hit at my party that I'd been requested to make it for several partys afterwards.  I've never had left overs!

I did things a little differently.  I cooked on low for 7 hours, and then it simmered for another 3 while I was still at work.  When I got home, I drained the rootbeer and shredded the pork and let it simmer for another hour in Hawaiian sauce.  I served it over rice rather than on a bun.  It was AMAZING.  The rootbeer really helped make it sweet and it really tasted like the Hawaiian pork that we love so much.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very tasty & moist.Pulled apart easy.Didn't know how the root beer would add to the flavor,but there wasn't any root beer taste.After shreading,I made a mustard sauce to mix in the pork.I used yellow mustard,balsamic vinegar,brown sugar,worchestershire sauce,a splash of hot sauce.I simmered it for 1/2 hour stiring it because it thickens.The sauce is a dark color & has a mild mustard taste.Matches well with the pork.Serve on rolls.

Although I am kind of new to this cooking business...I have made pulled pork a few times. I always just season it myself...but using the rootbeer was not only easy but also yummy! My boyfriend and all my rommates loved it! I will make it again.

I LOVE pulled pork- so the results were still more than edible. However, number 1- the smell of root beer in the slow cooker all day was honestly nauseating and number 2) there are just other simpler ways of cooking pull pork and get equally good or better results- i.e. using beef broth, real beer, onion soup mix, etc. If determined to use the root beer I think I would recommend using less of it and some of another broth or liquid in place of the rest. AND definitely use the boston butt/pork shoulder- you can dig out the meatier places but the flavor the bone and fat provide while cooking are unparalleled by other cuts- although I am sure the pork tenderloin is also delicious- this is slow cooked pork pulled pork!

YUMMY!! I didn't use the pork tenderloin as recommended,  I used a pork shoulder instead, which was way more economical.
I also browned all four sides with olive oil, fresh garlic, salt, and pepper before I put it in the crock pot. 
I also added liquid smoke in with the root boor and I walked away until I added the bbq sauce the last hour and a half. 
The meat just fell apart and was so juicy and delicious. A great recipe when it's too cold to use the smoker and you're craving pulled pork.

Very disapointed. I'm not big on pork, but I usually love pulled pork. This was not good. I used shoulder pork so maybe pork tenderlion would have made it taste better although I think It may also have something to do with the rootbeer. I thought it had a nasty smell while it was cooking in the crockpot. I will never make this again.

This was amazing! We've made it a few times and even for a party at our house and got rave reviews :) We used pork shoulder, though, instead of tenderloin as was suggested to us by the butcher at the market. Also, we used Barq's root beer. I don't know how much difference it makes with what brand, but I happen to find Barq's the most flavorful.

I made this for a superbowl party, and it was great.  I added some sliced onions for a little extra flavor.  The pork pulled apart really easily, and I added honey BBQ sauce.  Mmmmm.

The pork turned out very moist and tender, but, I could taste too much rootbeer. I guess that is to be expected by the ingredients, just don't be surprised that it is REALLY rootbeer-y

Excellent. We used Boylan Root Beer because it has no high fructose corn syrup and then used Stubb's Bar-B-Q Sauce for the same reason. We cooked the pork for 5 hours, drained the root beer added the Stubb's and cooked for an hour longer. Amazing!

This is THE absolute best recipe for pulled pork. I tweaked it just a bit and rubbed the pork with  black pepper, crushed garlic, dry mustard & onion powder before hitting the root beer. We have passed this recipe on to quite a few of our friends & neighbors and they absolutely love it. I use Sprecher root beer (imho the best root beer around), & Bone Suckin Sauce Hot/Thicker Style (by far the best BBQ sauce ever!). Thank you so much for letting the world know about this great sandwich. Oh definitely using onion kaiser rolls, colby jack or pepper jack cheese & cole slaw on it is our favorite preparation! I did make this once and it came out kind of dry after 8 hours, so the 2nd time I only cooked it for 6 hours and it was perfect!

This is delicious... my boyfriend and his friends couldn't get enough on football Sunday!  I followed the directions exactly, rubbing the meat with garlic salt and onion powder before cooking, and poking holes in the tenderloin to absorb the flavors.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Delicious!  I just wish that I'd had more sauce on hand to add to the pork when on the bun... it was a tiny bit dry.

Amazed! This was one incredible recipe. Simple and all of my guests loved it. I read some of the reviews and took some suggestions: 1. We used "pork butt" 2. We used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce I can't wait to make this again....

I didn't find that the root beer flavor meshed well with the BBQ sauce (I used Stubbs spicy sauce).  I took the lazy way out and well, that's how it tasted:(

Didn't have any root beer so I used a cola. Came out delicious. I'm going to try the root beer next time. Although, I don't think it will make a difference since all I really tasted was the bbq sauce.

I put two Boston Butts in the crock pot and added one medium thick sliced onion, 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and to make it taste like it was smoked for days, I put in 3/4 bottle of liguid smoke, and then added a bit more towards the end.  This was used for a group picnic of 35 and everyone loved it.  Some put it on sandwich buns with more barbecue sauce and other ate it plain.  They want me to do it the same way next  year.

WOW!  I used a 6 lb. pork butt roast, sprayed the crock pot with PAM, and covered with store-brand root beer.  Followed the rest of the directions as written and it was AMAZING!  My picky 7-year-old says it's "out of this world!" :)

This is so easy and good.  I followed the recipe exactly; using A&W rootbeer and Famous Dave's BBQ sauce.  My father-in-law liked it so much (very tender) he asked for the recipe.  And, he's an awesome cook, so I took this as a compliment.

Quite tasty. I rubbed the meat with kosher salt, pepper and garlic and then tossed in the crock pot with the root beer. Mixed it up with BBq sauce later.. just delicious.

WOW!!! Used a 5 lb shoulder butt, used two 12 oz. bottles of root beer and cooked on low for 10 hrs. It literally fell into 3 pieces as I tried to pull it out of crock pot. ABSOLUTELY the best pulled pork I've ever had!!!!! 5 stars!!!

Awesome and super-easy!!  I used pork tenderloin (I prefer very lean meat, so I use pork tenderloin in all my slow cooker recipes) and a 21.6-oz bottle of BBQ Sauce (instead of the recommended 18-oz. listed in the original recipe).  Cooked the roast for 7-1/2 hours, then for another 30 minutes after shredded the pork and stirring in the BBQ sauce (so, total of 8 hours of cooking time).  Turned out to be delicious!  Lean, moist, easily-shredded....perfect!!  I wouldn't limit sauce to only 18 oz, as called for in the recipe.  I think it would be too dry without the extra few ounces I added by using a 21.6-oz bottle.  You could even add 2 or 3 more ounces and I don't think it would be too moist.  21.6-oz seemed perfect to me.  I used Hunts Original BBQ Sauce, but any BBQ sauce will work nicely in this I think.     I'll be making this again.

I am a college student, and I found this recipe extremely easy to make and all of my friends loved it! I did change it a little. I added brown sugar and cracked pepper to my dish, as well as sweet onions and a slice of pineapple on top! I broiled the buns and added a bit of salt and butter to them. I served a side-dish of home fries! I will definitely make this again, it was perfect for a Sunday football day!!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This was delicious!!!  I used the butt portion of meat and did what one other person mentioned and placed a dry rub of onion soup mix, garlic, steakhouse seasoning and worchestire sauce.  Threw it in the crock pot and added one can of A&W Root Beer.  Cooked on low for 7 hours.  I then poured out the Root Beer.  Pulled the meat off the bone with a fork and disgarded the fatty pieces.  I then added barbecue sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes.  Hubby loved it, and my 8 year old asked for more and even the dog and cat got a few nibbles.  Moi Delicious!!!  Oh yes and I also made Mom's Coleslaw recipe from this site.   It was the perfect coleslaw to compliment this dish.  Will absolutely make this one again.

I made this for a party and everyone raved about it.  I used good root beer (Jones) made with pure cane sugar and a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle bbq sauce.  It was sweet with a subtle kick that wasn't too spicy.  This is definitely a keeper!

Used a 4lb Boston pork butt with bone in, 2 bottles of IBC rootbeer, cooked on low for 7 hours. Shredded and replaced for 1 hour with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce. The result was absolutely delicious! The entire family enjoyed this, even my finicky son enjoyed it and finished quickly compared to his usual slow pace. We will enjoy this frequently from now on.

This is a great basic recipe but don't be afraid to play around with it.  For me it was a little too sweet and I just used a regular BBQ sauce, our favorite Sweet Baby Rays.  Next time maybe I will make it with a spicy BBQ sauce.

I also took the advice of others and used a 4 pound shoulder instead of the tenderloin.  I  doubled the root beer and the barbeque sauce because I doubled the size of the pork.  For sauce - I used one bottle of Bulls eye hickory and one bottle of the sweet and tangy to balance each other out.  When it was done, I removed the pork and pulled it into shreds with two forks, drained all of the liquid and returned the pork to the slow cooker and mixed in the barbeque sauce and let it go for another hour to let the sauce soak in.  It was so good.  I am definitely going to do this one again.

I made 30#s of a Pork Shoulder Roasts for a customer cookout and it turned out beyond what I could have imagined. I still have people asking me for that recipe. I used a lower temperature (225 degrees) over 12 hours in a slow roaster and it fell apart. I used A & W Root beer plus I rubbed some salt, pepper, and garlic powder into the pork in the beginning. Use this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

I put 2 onions quartered on the bottom with a 5 lb tenderloin and 36 oz of root beer.  After 4 hours, drained off the root beer reserving the juice.  Chopped the pork and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and approx. 3/4 cup of the reserved liquid.  Was told it was the best pulled pork ever.  So easy!  Will be doing this often, especially for casual company.  Many thanks for this recipe.

I've made this twice in the last three weeks - both times my guests have raved about it.  I have a much more difficult recipe (any recipe is more difficult than this one!) but this recipe is heads above my old recipe!  I cannot emphasize enough how great this pulled pork is!  Highly recommend it!

This was quite amazing.  Never would have believed that root beer could be the "secret ingredient" in pulled pork BBQ.  I am trying to cut out corn syrup, so I used some leftover BBQ sauce (from the Slow Cooker BBQ Ribs on this site): 2 cups ketchup 1 cup chili sauce 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 4 tablespoons vinegar 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 dash hot sauce

This recipe is great.  I had the tenderloin in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  I then added Stubs BBQ sauce along with a little bit of water and cooked it on low for another hour.  It came out fantastic.  I didn't have any issue cleaning up sugar from the root beer.   (I saw a few people mentioned they had an issue with the sugar hardening on the slow cooker.)  Used A&W root beer.

I was AMAZED at how wonderful and easy this recipe was. I bought a 3 pound pork loin for $6 and some change from a nice grocery store. I think it is definetly worth buying the leaner cut to save on fat because it is still moist & delicious. I followed all the steps exactly on here & I wouldn't change a thing. I used Sweet Baby Ray's award winning BBQ sauce & there did not have to be any additional seasonings like garlic powder or S&P. I cooked the pork for 6 hrs on low, drained it, shredded it, and cooked with the BBQ sauce for 1 hour. I served it on potato buns as is. I will be making this often, and I think it would be great for sliders for appetizers on the mini Kings Hawaiian Rolls.

Tried this last week for a fairly large luncheon - 13 adults and 3 kids.  Bought a 5 lb pork butt and cooked it in the root beer for 14 hours...fell apart..added Baby Ray's and it was yum!!! All the men asked for the recipe and several women did too.  BTW, the one little girl who eats nothing but pasta had a whole sandwich.  Served with cole slaw and potato salad...delish!!!  Thanks for the recipe...:>)

I made for my company summer kick off luncheon for 40 people mostly men who work outside. Use 30# of pork shoulder which I pre-rubbed with dark brown sugar, yellow mustard, minced garlic, onion powder, apple cider vinegar, worchershire sauce, salt and pepper. Placed in an 18 qt roaster @ 325 topped with 2 liters Mug Rootbeer and some bay leaves. Cooked for 7 hours. Cooled to shred and remove bones and extra fat, tossed the juiced because of the fat content. Reheated next day w/1 bottle of zesty chili sauce, apple juice and water to cover. Reheated @ 250 for 1 hour. Most employees skipped the barbecue sauce, loving the flavor as it was. Will be keeping this one handy. Thank you.

I was skeptical that a lean cut like tenderloin would work  for pulled pork but i was proven wrong. I never make pulled pork because a Boston butt is too much for the two of us being able to used a tenderloin is fantastic! The result was moist and with a fraction of the fat. The sauce i used was a little sweet so i am going to have to do some research on a more acidic sauce to balance out the sugar from the root beer.

This is the only way I can eat pork BBQ now. I've had gastric bypass, and most bbq is WAY too fatty for me to eat. Using a tenderloin cut, with diet root beer, makes this a delicious meal for me and my family. I rub the tenderloin with fresh ground pepper, some garlic powder (or add in some fresh pressed garlic in the crock pot), and cover with root beer. I serve on buns, topped with cole slaw. This has been a hit with family, friends, and the men in my hubby's squadron. I get asked to make this again and again!

There was not enough fluid (and I even doubled it) for it to cook for 6-7 hours. The birthday dinner I was making for my Brother-in-law was ruined and so was my slow cooker!!!!! If you plan on making this (I would advise not to...) make sure you add some water!

oh , i was so looking forward to this ... the reviews were so positive. It was my first attempt at pulled pork. I used SurgarRays reg. bbQ sauce. my hubby ate his sandwich , but i couldn't. The pork itself was yummy , so i washed off all the sauce and will try making a rice dish with the rest of the pork. I did everything according to the recipe.....but we did not care for this recipe at all. I think if i tried it again....i'd try a brownish gravy instead of the BBQ sauce.....and it's not that we don't like BBQ sauce......it was just too "smokey" tasting.....or something.......I usually make my own BBQ sauce if i'm doing ribs........but i thought i'd follow some of the other reviewers suggestions of SugarRay sauces.... sorry, i guess ya can't please everyone.   I will say though, ya can't beat a slow cooker for doing pork roasts.  No muss, no fuss.

This was easy and tasty-what more can you ask for? I used a 4 lb pork loin roast that had just a little fat on it, seasoned the meat beforehand -  which I definitely recommend, and added about 24 ounces of root beer.  After meat was tender and pulled apart, I drained the root beer off and added a full bottle of Stubbs BBQ sauce.   My husband and kids loved it, and I loved how simple it was. Note: As others have mentioned, for a simple clean-up, be sure to spray your crock put with Pam beforehand.

This is such a great and easy way to make “barbecue” at home. I am a native Memphian, and we are picky about these kinds of things. I used a premium brand of root beer (Hansens), which I think probably contributed to the great taste. Based on the other reviews, I did salt and pepper and pierce the pork before putting it in the slow cooker. I also covered the meat entirely with root beer, which is probably more liquid-to-meat than the normal technique but definitely necessary for this recipe. I did use pork tenderloin, too, because that is what I had in my freezer. Several people noted that this is an expensive cute of meat to shred, but it is also very lean. Considering that there is sugar in the root beer and in most barbecue sauces, cutting the fat helps the nutrition of this recipe. Also, sometimes pork tenderloin goes way on sale, and this is a great way to use some out of your freezer.

I've made this before and it' delicious! Sure, you can add an onion or spices but it really works just as well if not better just like this. And no one can believe you used tenderloin instead of butt or shoulder and you save literally 100's of calories!! That was the best thing about this recipe besides it's delicious taste. I use Sweet Baby's Ray's sauce- the original and then provide the sweet and spicy or the hot and spicy on the side.

The rest of my family liked this recipe, but I really didn't care for the background flavor that the root beer gave this.  I will also agree with some other reviewers - though this is great with a pork tenderloin, you don't have to make this with such an expensive cut of meat.

I used a boston butt and used about 3 bottles of root beer.  It didn't do anything to the meat.  In fact it was really bland until I used my version of Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce.  Then my pulled porked was off the hook.  I think just adding water with garlic and onions and some seasonings would have done better.  Not trying this recipe again.

Freakin' awesome!  Per other reviews I also used boneless pork shoulder (had a group of 10 hungry boys to feed & that was more affordable), poked holes in it with a fork and rubbed some black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes and garlic powder on it before adding in the root beer.  Let it cook on high for 5 hours & it shredded perfectly; then added in Sticky Fingers bbq sauce.  Topped the sandwiches with Muenster/Pepper Jack cheese & they were devoured within minutes.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

I seasoned the pork (I used shoulder) with salt and pepper and then added sliced onions and minced garlic.  Cheap/poor quality sauce will ruin this dish!  Served with Sweet Restaurant Slaw recipe from this site.

This recipe was SO EASY and SO GOOD.  I used a 4 lb shoulder cut, trimmed the fat, seasoned with garlic powder and pepper and cooked it in the slow cooker in the root beer on low for about 9 hours.  I used enough root beer to almost cover the meat and turned the meat half way through the cook time.  Drained the root beer and mixed in the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and let it "get happy" with the BBQ sauce until warmed through.  Served on Garlic french bread rolls "southern style" with cole slaw on top and my family and friends devoured the entire roast and begged for more.  AWESOME recipe!!  Will be making this again and again. Thanks so much!!

Update 3/2011 - Tenderloin makes a BIG difference. I season my meat with Montreal Steak seasoning and soak overnight in coke. Then add the BBQ sauce with approx 2 hours to go.  FABULOUS!!!  

Really a 3.5.  My husband LOVED this recipe and would have rated it a 5; however, I thought it was "just ok."  Not fantastic - as I was expecting, given all the rave reviews. I seasoned my meat and let it stand overnight - and even with that, the meat was just ok. I agree with another user who said they don't see evidence of what the rootbeer is for. Based on the reviews, I also used pork shoulder, instead of tenderloin and I found this meat to be very fatty. My family and I were picking out "nasty pieces" throughout the entire meal. To each his own - but I certainly don't think the price savings justified the unappealing nature of the cheaper meat. I think I will try this recipe again with tenderloin and see if it turns out any better. I definitely think the BBQ sauce should be added to the meat much sooner than called for.

I used Diet Root Beer and it worked just fine without the caramelization on the sides of the slow cooker that other had complained about.

What an easy recipe! I used pork butt instead of tenderloin. Why use an expensive cut? Now 2 quarts are in the freezer ready anytime.

this was so easy to make. I spiced up the meat like  I read in the commets, I even let it soak in the root beer over night and then turned on the crock pot on in the morning. Well make it again and again.

I've made this several times now.  Once for 30 people for a party.  A terrific recipe when you need to serve a large crowd and don't want to be hanging out by a grill.  I've always used a pork butt.  The bone comes out easily and it shreds perfectly.

This was definitely a hit at the party.  I did make a few minor adjustments.  I trimmed any fat on the meat, rubbed it with salt and pepper, added one onion sliced and about 5 cloves of garlic.  When they were finished I served it up on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to make them almost like sliders.  It was perfect for a party.  I might add a whole jalapeno next time just to give it some kick. I will definitely make this again.

I'm not a slow cooker type of person.  I don't like my meats cooked for long hours because they usually dry out.  I was VERY impressed with this recipe!  I had borrowed my sisters slow cooker for some refried beans and decided to try another recipe since I had it here.  This was wonderful!  I have celiac disease and have to watch my gluten so I don't usually have root beer on hand as most is not gluten free.  So I substituted Dr Pepper instead. I also used pork butt instead of a loin. This was so good I would proudly serve this to company.  Thank you for giving me my first real slow cooker meal recipe and for converting me to using one.  Great, great recipe.

I tried this with both pork butt and pork tenderloin and the tenderloin was easier to pull. It was a big hit at my nieces summer barbaque.

This was pretty good. My family was not totally blown away, but it was quick and easy. I dont know if I would use the root beer again or not because I have made this before using the McCormick pulled pork seasoning packets and it turned out a little more flavorfull. I used sweet baby rays bbq and added a little after the first 3-4 hours of cooking. I drained out the rootbeer and added the rest of the bbq and cooked for another 45 min. I also cooked it on high for about 5 hours. All crockpots are different - mine is a newer one so I was hoping it would cook a little faster then 5 hours, but no such luck. If you are looking for a very easy pulled pork and not a whole lot of seasoning then this one is for sure worth trying.

had this in my MIL's house and it was great, so I am trying it myself tonight.  Also used the pork shoulder for the low cost aspect.  TIP TO CLEAN YOUR SLOW COOKER:  if you are having a hard time getting cooked on food off it, soak a dryer sheet in it for a few hours and everything should come right up.  Fill with water enough to cover all stuck on food and it will wipe up after a few hours.  Works everytime!!

I wanted to make pulled pork for a July 4th BBQ.  My husband told me I would need a smoker.  Not really having the room for(or funds to buy) a smoker, I came to Allrecipes looking for something I could make with my crockpot. Saw this recipe and had to try it.  I used pork butt, Barq's and seasoned the meat with salt & pepper.  Bought some sauce from a local BBQ joint and served it on slider rolls.  It was heaven!  The best part is that it seems as if you slaved over it for hours, but really it doesn't take much effort at all (especially if your husband does the pulling);).  You should keep in mind that the pork will cook down.  I bought 5lbs of pork for 20 people.  We only had about 13 and there was only a tiny bit of it left after the party.  I made this again last night, cause I didn't get enough on the 4th!  Can't wait until tonight's dinner!

Delicious! I used root beer and a pork roast.  It literally fell apart as I was taking it out to shred it.  I used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce (the best - if you have not tried it, please do!  It is better than any others out there)and now it is on the warm setting since we are close to eating time. Try it!

Made this yesterday and it was fantastic. Felt kind of weird about the root beer, but it works! I had a four pound pork loin and Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce. Not greasy at all, which we liked. We toasted our buns with butter, topped with pork and onion slices. My husband put dill slices on his and said it was really good. Enjoyed by all. Thanks for a great recipe. Will use this often.

Delicious recipe! I revised it a little: I added about 300 ml of beer and 100 ml water (I have a huge slow cooker and was afraid the pork would dry out with only 1 can of root beer) I also cooked it with onions and garlic for flavour and discarded them with the root beer after cooking on low for 10h. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I didn't have rootbeer so I used regular Coke. It worked fine, I think next time I will add peppers and onions to give it a litle more flavor. I used Sweet Baby  Rays Hickory and Brown sugar BBQ sauce as suggested by other reviewers, and used a pork loin roast that I already had.

Multiplies very easily! I had a party for 12 people and purchased a 10 lb pork shoulder. I had to carve off the meat and still probably had at least 8lbs of meat. I threw it in with A&W root beer and it was fall apart ready after 10 hours on low. Thank goodness the A&W root beer didn't "stick" because I really hate root beer.

This was SUPER easy. I used 3 1/2 pounds of boneless pork rib roast and it worked just fine. I also added a few seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder) before placing the meat in the crock pot. I only gave it 4 stars, though, instead of 5 because there were a few bites where I could faintly taste a hint of sweet root beer. (I used diet root beer.) I think I will make this again, but I might try diet Coke next time.

Good at first but too sweet for us.The pork is very tender. Might be better if I made my own barbeque sauce, that way I could control the sugar.

This recipe would be 5 stars but I had to add to it to make it 5 stars. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly- it was ok not great but ok. It definitely was sweet but I like me bbq pork sweet and spicy. So, the second time I made it I made a dry rub with brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and red pepper flakes. I caked the pork butt with the dry rub and then cooked it in the slow cooker with the rootbeer. We used sweet baby rays sweet and spicy bbq sauce and when we added the bbq sauce we added chopped jalepeno peppers. It was awesome!!

made this and did not add the BBQ sauce so people could add what they wanted. (hot or mild BBQ)  Found the pork alone tasted "o.k." can't really taste the root beer so i would use the beef bullion method i normally use.

These were great but I don't think the root beer played too big a part in the taste.  The BBQ sauce makes all the difference.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce.  If you don't have rootbeer I wouldn't worry, you could use any other dark soda or even just water as long as you have lots of sauce.  Also, we seasoned the meat with Johnny's and Garlic salt/powder through out the day.  This is great served with frozen fries or a green salad.

Amazing!!  Everyone LOVED this... kids included!  I used a shoulder roast and sprinkled Onion Onion & Garlic Garlic (Tastefully Simple seasoning) on before pouring Root Beer over. Cooked on low for 6 hours, drained and pulled pork apart. Then added some Liquid Smoke and half a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays' BBQ sauce and a little water.. (we don't like an overwhelming BBQ taste)... IT was PERFECT!  The liquid smoke and BBQ sauce made it amazing!  THIS is what I have been looking for.  Thank you!

I have made 3 other bbq pulled pork recipes trying to locate a delicious meal.  I am done looking!  This was incredibly delicious and extremely easy!  You can't ask for more than that. It was even better the next day.  The first day, we just used fresh hoagies right out of the bag.  Today, is spead butter on the hoagie & broiled it for a couple of minutes. Outstanding!

WOW!  I made this for my VERY picky husband and he along with my 3 VERY picky daughters LOVED this!  I used 4 lbs Pork Butt Roast and pretty much covered it with A & W rootbeer.  I cooked it for about 7 hours.  After I pulled the pork apart, I put it with COOKIES BBQ sauce.  I also made a KFC coleslaw recipe and put it on top of the sandwich. (bun, BBQ pork, coleslaw, bun) My husband ate it like this somewhere in the south before and to my surprise, it was FABULOUS!!   I am making it again for a birthday party today.  I hope it turns out as wonderful as before!

Everyone loves this recipie.  I used a BBQ sauce specifically for pulled pork - Dinosaur BBQ.  I also season the pork loin before it goes in the crockpot.

Very good and so simple to put together. I used a 4 lb pork butt instead of tenderloin. Much more economical to use butt.

I made this with pork shoulder and Pepsi because that's what I had.  I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper, put a layer of sliced onions on the bottom of the crock pot, poured the Pepsi and added about 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce.  Once it was done, I shredded the meat, discarded the onions and liquid and poured the rest of the barbeque sauce into the crock pot.   It was delicious.

I get so many compliments on this pulled pork.  But... I change it a bit to make it my own.  I add the rootbeer and the BBQ sauce in the slow cooker.  I add 1/4 tsp of smoke flavor and also add 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder.  Cook on low for 8 hours.

Love this recipe. Made this several times now. use pork shoulder. the blade cut is tender. have used several brands of root beer. found the more flavorful the root beer the more interesting the meat. have tried it with hard root beer. Not much different. I have experimented with variety of rubs. usually something on sale. get 7-9 lbs piece, rub it and leave it a minimum of 45 minutes before cooking. place into 6 qt cooker, add 12oz root beer and cook on low 7-9 hours depending on weight. when done, reserve 1 cup liquid, skimming off fat. combine with bottle of BBQ sauce and cook down to desired thickness.

Extremely easy.  I added a 1/2 sliced onion.  The flavor was very good but the meat was dry.  I used a tenderloin so next time I'll use a cheaper cut of pork. Husband liked it so it's worth making again.

Been making This recipe ever since I found it on here. Instead I use Hawaiian Sweet Buns that really brings out the sweet flavor, also I add a slice of provolone cheese. I didn't feel like going back out so I used the fresh Onion buns we had in the pantry, also came out a hit. 
To all the people that posted that it tasted too much like root beer... Well Duh, that's the only thing it called for. It's supposed to be sweet tasting or else it would have called for water and a pulled pork packet and for the others that tweaked the recipe and still gave it a low rating, you can only blame yourself for that.

Very good ! Our church co-operates with other churches in Bethlehem in running a homeless mens and womens shelter throughout the winter months. One of the church memebers donated a 10 pound pork loin for us to cook pulled pork sandwiches for close to 30 homeless men. I cut it into quarters and used this amazingingly easy recipe to cook the meat. The pork loin pulled apart very easily then I used Sweet baby Rays honey barbrque sauct to finish it up. We served the sandwiches with string beans and applesauce plus many home baked desserts. The guys really enjoyed it !!

This was incredible.  I used A&W rootbeer, and two pork roasts since I could fit two in my crock pot. Covered with the soda and nothing else. Cooked on low for about 8 hours. The meat had a pretty good taste. After it cooled I drained the rootbeer and pulled the pork apart. I then mixed in about 1/4 cup of liquid smoke and some garlic powder. I let set in the fridge overnight and put back on low. After the meat was warmed I added two bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. I gave it a little taste and wasn't all that impressed. I usually use KC Masterpiece. I let the flavors marry for a couple of hours on low and Wow!!!! what a happy marriage it was.  The sauce and the pork came together in a fantastic taste explosion.  It was the best I have ever tasted.  Big hit with the family, even my daughter who hates bbq sauce on pulled pork, loved it. Try this recipe and you won't be sorry.

This is AWESOME!!  But as it's hard, and expensive, to find root beer here in Spain,  I made it with Coke.  My friends, husband and I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making pulled pork on my own, and I was specifically looking for a tenderloin recipe because I personally did not want to deal with all of the fat on less lean pieces of meat! Worth it - I only spent $10 total on 2 1.5lb pork loins from my grocery store. I was skeptical - but in no way did this recipe taste like rootbeer after draining the liquid. The only thing I did different was cover the bottom and sides of the pork in the crockpot with a sliced yellow onion and a sprinkle of garlic powder. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and served with a thinly sliced red onion and toasted sesame buns! Will definitely be making this again!

Hello Dear All Recipes Users!!!  I made this lovely dish a few days ago turned out wonderful.  The ONLY changes I did was because in Greece (where i live) I cannot find root beer easily I used regular beer.  I also took some advice from other users and after pulled my pork apart, put bbq sauce and pork back in slow cooker for an extra hour on high.  Served it on hamburger buns with cheese and red onions.  Even my 7 year old who is the most pickiest eatier loved this.  Will be making again soon.  Thank you for a most wonderful recipe.  Also will be great for the summer when we want to go the beach.  Fix beforehand swim and come back to a great meal.

Super Bowl 2014 Food Menu MVP! Everyone loved this. I did use a tenderloin but have used a pork shoulder in the past.  I seasoned the meat and cooked it in the root beer for 8 hrs. Drain the juice, shredded the meat, added a bottle of BBQ sauce, and put it back in the crock (on warm) until game time. Served it with mini potato rolls, cole slaw, pickles. No fuss - tons of flavor!

I did not care for this recipe. The root beer gave the pork a sweet taste that overwhelmed the barbecue sauce.

I am a novice cook and I made this for dinner tonight, using a 4.5 lbs pork butt, and diet root beer.  It came out great!  I cooked the pork in the root beer for 7 hrs on low and then drained, and shred the pork.  I then added the shredded pork back into the slower cooker with Sweet baby Ray;s (best BBQ ever in my opinion) and cooked for 1.5 hours on low.  It came out GREAT!  better then any restaurant I have been to.  Great recipe!

I did what the recipe called for, except I used almost a full 2liter of rootbeer. I put the pork tenderloin and rootbeer in the crockpot around 2:00pm (I made sure the tenderloin was completely submerged) set the crockpot on low and set the timer for 6 hours. When it had 40 mins left on the timer I took it out, drained the rootbeer, cleaned my crockpot, put the tenderloin back in the crockpot and then added BBQ sauce and let it warm back up on the "keep warm" setting for the last 40 mins. Absolutely delicious!! My boyfriend took a bite and the first words out of his mouth after he took his bite were "mmmm, this is definitely a do-over".

Everyone in my family thought I was nuts cooking the pork with rootbeer. But everyone loved it.  Won't cook pulled pork any other way from now on.

I recommend making this with ~ 3lb pork shoulder instead of the recommended tenderloin. I used a 2lb one, and the meat to sauce ratio was not quite right. I didn't read the directions and added the BBQ sauce and root beer at the beginning, as well as a bit (about 2-3Tbsp) of white vinegar, to cut some sweetness. It turned out well. No need to drain this recipe, which was good. I served it on buns with crunchy fried onions, which made a nice contrast in texture.

This is ridiculously easy and delicious.  I use pork butt instead of the tenderloin.  Cheaper and tastier.  The boys have enjoyed this so much that I've made it three times in the last month.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great! I found that using a smoker BBQ sauce really blended well with the sweetness of the root beer. Will definitely make again! Served it on warm crusty kaisers with homemade coleslaw. Yummmm

Love this recipe for feeding 6-8 people in a pinch!
I work on the mountains during the day, and this recipe allows me to throw something delicious quickly in the slow-cooker (making the home smell savory when I arrive back:) before heading out the door!
Its ready to go the second I walk in the door: I simply put it in a oven-safe casserole dish, pull it apart as directed and let it bake in the barbecue sauce of choice (taste preference of heat/spicy level dependent on guests) at about 325 degrees for about 15-20min or until bubbly (Note: I live at altitude).
Add a starch, and green side [on this plate, featured with sprouts and mini-multi-colored taters] and a few extra condiments for your guests' liking/ what's on hand.....and your in business with this awesome go-to slow-cooker pulled pork!

Great recipe though I agree it could have used way less liquid broth from the start as the pork ends up releasing it's own liquid which results in a diluted tasting sauce. I use powder/dried seasoning/chicken flavoring (Maggy cubes) and would suggest mixing this straight into the BBQ sauce in the crockpot, omitting the extra liquid.

I used Pork chops for this recipe.  I placed 500ml of cider in slow cooker with them along with 1 large onion chopped, 3 cloves of garlic and salt and pepper.  once the pork was cooked i took the liquid and veg out, liquidized them and having pulled the pork apart i soaked it in the now blitzed liquid.  I later drained most of the liquid off before adding the bbq sauce and placing the pork back in heat for service.  Superb flavour from the apple adding a lovely sweetness to the meat, highly recommended.

I am not the best cook in fact I really don't enjoy it. But my mother gave me a bunch of pork tenderloins and I had no idea how to cook them. When I found this recipe I thought this sounds easy enough. I followed the recipe exactly and my family of 7 loved it they are already asking when I am going to be making this again.

I used a 5 lbs shoulder cut (aka Boston Butt). Sow cooked for 6 hours, shredded, placed back into slow cooker, added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and cooked on high for 30 mins. Once done, I toasted Kaiser Rolls and served. It got raving reviews.

Was hesitant but WOW WAS I WRONG! 

Used a pork shoulder and trimmed the extra fat and connection tissue. Seasoned with salt/pepper and browned it well. I used 2 bottles of root beer and cooked on low for 10 hours.   It shredded sooooo easily and the flavor was sooo good, I was surprised at the amount of the flavor imparted but not tasting like root beer. 

Huge hit and sooo darn easy,I won't make pulled pork any other way.

This was so good. I used a pork shoulder roast. Took it to a family BBQ and everyone loved it. I don't like root beer and was a bit hesitant because of that, but you couldn't taste the root beer. I used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce and served it on King's Hawaiian rolls. Very tender and tasty.

I used a combination of pork tenderloin and boneless pork loin which I had in the freezer, and diet root beer (what I had on hand). I actually liked the pork loin (which I bought on sale for $1.99/lb) better than the tenderloin.  I also liked that when shredding, I didn’t have to go through the meat and discard all the fat that you have when using the typical Boston butt roast.  The meat cooked perfectly at 6 hours, and its flavor was fantastic, just an interesting little bit of sweetness from the root beer.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the BBQ sauce that you use will totally dominate the flavor of the pork, so at a minimum, choose one that you REALLY like.  Unfortunately, I wanted that pork flavor on my sandwich, and in the future, I will not use a powerful tomato-based BBQ sauce for this recipe.  I will serve the pork on its own, maybe wrapped in a lettuce leaf with some Asian garnishes, set some aside for some Mexican dishes, or try a vinegary North Carolina BBQ sauce for sandwiches.  And seriously, put meat in pot, add root beer, lid on, cook for 6 hours, shred, and add sauce...come on, it just doesn’t get much easier than that.  I’m not a huge crock pot fan, but this is one that I really enjoyed, and I’m not alone, with 2,833 reviews at 4.5 stars.  A winner, for sure!

I've made this recipe about a dozen times now and I just love how simple it is! All you need are 3 ingredients! I've made it with tenderloin or pork shoulder, whichever is on sale. I prefer to use Dr. Pepper, but it's good with root beer as well.. just a lot sweeter. Any dark regular soda will do. It's the carbonation that really tenderizes the meat. After cooking on low for 10 hours, I drain the soda, add a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Sweet & Spicy sauce, and cook on low for another hour. This recipe is so simple and so good. I always get requests for this one.

Good, but it's very much just the sauce on the meat that you taste in the end. Unfortunately, I went with a sweeter BBQ sauce and ended up with what tasted like a sloppy joe.  If I'd used a traditional sauce, though, I'd say the experience of the pulled pork would have been more on the mark.  I followed the directions, using a small pork shoulder with an average amount of fat on it, added sliced onion on the bottom. Used enough A&W root beer to come up to 3/4 of the side of the meat, cooked it for 8 hours on low, turned it about three times,dumped the juice/root beer/onions, added the BBQ sauce and cooked the last hour on high. I tasted the pork on it's own after shredding and sadly, honestly, the meat didn't taste like anything at all! Super-tender and shredded easily, obviously, but it had no real flavor. The meat wasn't supposed to be seasoned, so I was hoping for a rich flavor or something from just the root beer, but no.
**UPDATE: the root beer is meant to act as a tenderizer only and is not used for flavoring, according to a review I just read! That explains a lot!** Super-easy recipe and fairly cheap. I'll make it again, but just use a vinegar-based BBQ sauce next time.
But we did really like it and both ate two sandwiches!

Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor! I took another chef's advice and bought the less expensive pork shoulder cut. I then rubbed it w/garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper.  I cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours, poured off the fat, pulled it apart and mixed with BF fav BBQ sauce, and then cooked for 30 min. I served it with Nana's Southern Coleslaw from allrecipes.com. Both are 5 stars.

Pulled pork BBQ is a favorite of mine and cooking it in root beer really does make for tender, delicious meat. For me, this is a great, simple 4-star recipe that I'm able to make 5-star with a couple easy alterations. 

When I put the pork loin in my slow cooker, I dice up a large, sweet onion and press the pieces onto the top of the pork loin. I then sprinkle a couple tablespoons of sugar and a modest amount of cayenne pepper on top of the onions. The sugar allows the onions to caramelize and the onions and spice make for perfect, savory pulled pork that's flavorful even without sauce, if you'd like! I do like my sauce though and prefer to use a bottle of my favorite Carolina sauce or Sweet Baby Ray's, depending on my mood.

I serve this BBQ on top of a slice of gluten-free bread.

I've made this a few times with different root beers and different bbq sauces to vary the flavor and sweetness level.  Delicious results every time.  Goes really well with potato salad.

Wonderful! Make this recipe exactly as written – it is perfect. Made pulled pork July 5th and the second time was a charm.  I also made this recipe on July 4th using the review suggestions cooking a Boston Butt. My guests enjoyed it, but I did not like it, the meat tasted gamey or something, just off a little to me. Using the tenderloin improved the sandwich for my taste at least. Thank you - my first experience making pulled pork - it is so easy. First review ever, recipe added into rotation menus per family requests.

I served this for a 'Grads and Dads' event a couple of weeks ago. Instead of tenderloin, I used pork shoulder purchased from Costco. If you haven't purchased it there previously, start now. It was a spectacular piece of pork; much less fat than what you get at the grocery store. I assumed about 4 lbs of shoulder to substitute for 2 lbs of tenderloin. Otherwise, I used the recipe as stated, and thoroughly drained the fat when cooking was complete. I had to do one in the crock pot and the other in the oven. No difference except how long it took (oven was faster). Then I used bottled BBQ sauce (Kraft... was on sale). I got raves from my guests. I froze the leftovers in baggies and took one of the bags on our boat trip for July 4th. The encore performance was also easy and wonderful.

My husband, who owns a restaurant, said this is the best pulled pork he has ever tasted. I used a pork shoulder, filled the cooker with root beer until it covered about 1/3 of the meat and cooked on high for about 4 hours. I turned it to low to cook for another 5 hours. I drained the RB and took the meat out which fell apart so easily. I put the now pulled pork back in the cooker and mixed in a bottle of A1 steak sauce and half a bottle of Bulls Eye hickory smoke BBQ sauce (although anything smokey would give it that flavor.) I stayed away from honey based BBQ sauces, since the Root Beer is already sweet.  I let it cook on low in the sauce for about an hour.  I wouldn't recommend playing around with it. Just get a sauce (or sauce combo) that you like.

I was really hesitant about this recipe at first (root beer?!) but I decided to try it out because of the rave reviews. Huge hit! I'm a picky eater, one of our guests is a picky eater, and we have 5 young girls that are all picky eaters and this stuff was devoured. I doubled the poundage of the recipe but used a pork shoulder which is much less expensive. Cooked skin on (in case anyone else is confused by that. I wasn't sure if I should leave it on or not. Leave it on, remove after cooking before shredding) and it took only about 6 hours (but my slow cooker runs high). Admittedly I thought I had made a terrible mistake making this recipe to entertain friends with by the smell. It wasn't awful but a very interesting odor (it is pork cooking in root beer, after all). But once I got it drained, shredded, and the BBQ sauce on it (we used our favorite: Garland Jack's Secret Six Original) all our mouths were watering. I put it back in the slow cooker for an hour on low with the BBQ sauce and served with Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I on top; though I omitted the onions from the recipe in favor of thinly sliced onions as an additional optional topping. It was so good my husband requested it for Father's Day.

Best shredded pork I ever had! I opted out of using pork tenderloin and instead got a nice pork loin way cheaper. Ended up using one liter of mug root beer but because crockpot was large and oval I topped it off with 2 cans of pepsi. I also sliced some onion and placed them underneath the meat for added flavor. This recipe doesnt call for any spices but I did apply salt and pepper and some garlic powder also to the meat. Let it sit about 9 hours on low and it shredded sooo easily! Added 2 bottles of sweet baby rays and let sit another hour. Turned out perfect! Served with homemade slaw... delish!!

This was an OK way to cook a 4 lb pork loin that I wanted to cook without turning on the oven or any fuss. I didn't think the root beer added any real flavor. I thought it was a bit dry, but with the BBQ sauce on it, the sandwiches were fine. I kept some of the meat out before adding BBQ sauce and made quesadillas the next night. I added chili powder, onion powder and cumin to the meat, and they turned out great.

It can't get any easier than this. GREAT for beginners, people with busy schedules, people on a budget, its so simple and comes out tasting great! The first time I tried this I threw all the ingredients in (pork, rootbeer and bbq suace!) After cooking for about 7-9 hours, I shredded the meat while it was still in the pot, I also found that the sauce was too watery! (no way was I going to drain it- I already had the bbq sauce in it) If this happens to you, All you do is a add a dash or 2 of some CORNSTARCH stir it up and let that baby cook for an hour or until you see that the sauce has thicken and is of the perfect consistency. Yes I skipped a couple steps from the original recipe but it totally saved my dish and I made it that much easier.

AMAZING!!! I love this recipe and my fiancé can say the same!! I've tried A LOT of pulled pork recipes and hated every one of them but this one is to die for and so easy. My family is from Texas so we love our BBQ and this recipe makes us feel right at home right from our kitchen table in California :) We started out using hamburger buns for a pulled pork sandwich but this recipe comes with a lot of juice so the bun would get really soggy. After a few runs at it we decided to try it on sour dough bread because at the time it was the only bread in the house (I know... Weird!) But actually it was so good!!! The bread stayed nice and toasted and but we were still able to enjoy those wonderful juices! Y'all have to try this one!

Really good. I recommend a spicy BBQ to cut down on sweetness.  I've made a couple times and it is a hit.  I have also frozen and saved for later and that works well.

This was so very good!! I'm sure a big part of it was the very yummy Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce I used, but the pork was well cooked, juicy, and the sandwiches we made were so good!! I put this into our weekly meal rotation right away and am already wanting more.

This recipe does not require pork tenderloin.  I have used much cheaper cuts of pork and the results were just fine.  Very good and simple to do.  The Kids just absolutely loved this.

I did a pork tenderloin and poked it this morning all over and put garlic salt and pepper and Montreal steak seasoning with 2 bottles of IBC root beer and let it cook on low from 7-5:45 then drained it and put a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce for another hour. It turned out absolutely amazing! This is the best pulled pork ever! I will be making this again!

Very easy, loved it! I did how ever, pull the pork apart, combined BBQ sauce and let it cook on warm for an hour. I also forked holes into the pork to help absorb flavor.

Tasted GREAT!

What I did:
Used a pork butt (Aprox 4 lbs)
Covered pork butt in crock pot with root beer and let cook for about 8 hours on low. (Flipping it halfway through).
My pork had a large piece of fat on it that I removed approximately at the 7 hour mark.
After about 8 hours, I took the pork out and shredded it in a bowl, removing any fatty pieces in the meat. 
The juice mixture was then poured from the crock pot, and the shredded meat back in. 
A small amount of root beer and a small portion of barbeque sauce were then added to taste and mixed in the crock pot. 
It then cooked for one last hour (at the 30 minute mark I stirred it.  
IT WAS SO GOOOOOOD!

The only thing I may have done differently is let it sit for another two hours, but thats it.

I have NEVER made BBQ anything because you either get it right, or you don't. I found this recipe a few months ago, and I purchased a 7.5 pound pork shoulder on sale from Wegman's. ($1.29/pound). It sat in my freezer because I was scared to try it! (Note: I'm a city girl that is dating a country boy....so the pressure was definitely on!!) I decided to give it a whirl. I read through about 200 reviews and did tweak the recipe due to the fear of there not being any seasoning in the recipe....I used a pork shoulder, rubbed the meat with McCormick's Pulled Pork Seasoning and wrapped in saran wrap overnight, poured in anentire 2 liter bottle of Barq's Root Beet, and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. It was a HIT!! My boyfriend who is as country as country can be said this was the best he's ever had. Granted, he "had" to say that or he'd be sleeping on the couch! My 15 yr old son, however, is brutally honest when it comes to giving his opinion....and he gave it 2 thumbs up! YEAH!!!! The meat was very tender  (not mushy like some claimed)...it slid right off the bone when I drained the meat. This is a keeper...not just for the yumminess, but for the simplicity of the ingredients and the process in making it!! Thank you to the original poster for sharing this recipe!!

Freakin' amazing. I made a few changes that others suggested, such as poking holes in the tenderloin first and then using a dry rub (garlic salt, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, etc.) before adding the root beer. It's cheaper to buy a 2L than a six-pack of 12oz bottles, anyway, so I just poured it in until it covered the pork (and I used closer to 3lbs). I cooked it on low for 10 hours, drained the root beer, then added more of the same spices to taste and most of a 40oz bottle of Jack Daniel's original BBQ sauce. I cooked it on low for another two hours, stirring often, and finished it off by slathering hamburger buns in margarine and throwing them under the broiler for a few minutes. Add some fresh green beans in lemon-butter sauce or corn on the cob, and you're golden! Accolades all around. Some of the best pulled pork I've ever had. :) AND SO EASY!

This was delicious and will definitely be a go to meal when I want to impress guests! I took the advice of many other reviewers and used pork shoulder and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce...excellent recommendations. I also added onion and garlic to the slow cooker. If you're like me, and like a bit of spice, I recommend adding pureed chipotle in adobo sauce and adding it in the end with the bbq sauce.
I served the finished pulled pork with caramelised onions and baked potato.

I am not big on using my slow cooker, but this recipe has me getting it out more often. It could not be easier or the taste more perfect! I have a large slow cooker and made a 6-lb tenderloin in it, by cutting it in half. I didn't measure the soda, just covered the tenderloin with it. It took about 12 hours to cook. Everyone at our BBQ RAVED about it. I got over 24 servings with all that pork!

love it!  I've been using this recipe for years, but am finally reviewing. I get asked to make this everytime we have a party! Only thing I do differently is add onions.  I've also used a coke once when I didn't have any rootbeer and was just as delicious.  So easy.

I tried this and my family loved. I added cracked peppercorn and cajun seasonings to it and it was fantastic. I have to make it again and add cole slaw on top.

I'm new to crock pot cooking and I've tried this recipe twice.  The first time it was strictly to the recipe and although it was wonderfully tender, it was a little bland. The second time I added a package of dry onion soup mix and that did the trick. We used a honey smoke BBQ sauce at the table and the whole family loved it.

This was so easy! I put the 2 pork tenderloins into the crock pot, added 1 bottle of root beer, and cooked 5 hours on medium. It came out moist, tender, and so easy to shred. I added Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and served on toasted buns with slaw. Easy and delicious!

Absolutely amazing!!! I followed one of the ratings advice to pull my pork apart and add my BBQ sauce 1hr before it was finished. It was the best pulled pork we have ever had!!! I served it on fresh pretzel buns from our baker and they were TO DIE FOR!!!!! This is a KEEPER!!!

I tried this yesterday when I had no time to fuss. When pouring in the root beer, I added lots of pepper and garlic.  I must say the taste of the root beer was nice...but adding all the BBQ sauce tastes just like any meat with lots of BBQ sauce on it! My 17 yr old grandson loved it, however. I will go with the low and slow pork that's been in a marinade & make my own sauce. But for teens, it's a GO!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! Went for the pork shoulder cut and used a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce.  Followed review by Jeff_Belmont of Oct. 19/10.  Also made homemade butterhorn buns and coleslaw, which was the perfect combination.  Will definitely make again and again! ;o)

This was absolutely terrible.  Sorry to say it tasted terrible too even after adding the Sweet Baby Ray's.  The only good thing I can say is the meat was tender and I substituted Boston Butt. Very disappointing.

Great Recipe. I used a 3 lb pork tenderloin, cooked on low with Root Beer for 8 hours while we were at work, when I got home I drained root beer and added Jack Daniels BBQ sauce for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours on low. It was so simple yet so delicious. I served on burger buns with Coleslaw.

I received an advertisement in the mail to subscribe to All Reciepes magazine and saw this reciepe, tried it, mainly due to all the 5 star ratings.  As the saying goes "There's a reason that Baskin Robbins has 31 flavors."  Way, way too sweet; mushy meat.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce and pork shoulder. There are 2 people in my family who have real "sweet tooths" and they gave it a thumbs down.  The solution was to put salsa on it, to add flavor other than root beer and to cut the sweetness some. We followed the suggestion from AR people to use cole slaw on the sandwiches; it did help and because of that, we were able to eat it the first night.  To each his own. :)

I didn't have root beer on hand so I used coca cola.  The pork was super moist - shredded easily with 2 plastic forks.  However, it didn't have much flavour - maybe that was because of the coke and not the root beer though?

This was lip smacking good!! I used a natural Root beer with cane sugar and no chemicals. Paired it with a natural root beer float and waffle fries, veggies and dip. My kids are picky picky and asked for seconds (one has never eaten pork!). I used little buns so they were like sliders and put lettuce and pickles on too. Thanks so much for posting. This would be FANTASTIC for a large group. One of my all time faves! Definitely put this on your "to try" list.

For anyone in a hurry - this is a sure thing! We absolutely loved this easy recipe. I cooked it the recommended time, drained the juices (but kept them) shredded the pork, put it back in the crock pot, added the barbecue sauce and cooked for another 3/4 hr.  And, by the way - the juices (or the cooked root beer that I saved) was incredible to taste once it was cooked and I reheated on the stove with a little cornstarch - or flour to thicken up and we dipped our sandwiches in it. To die for!

I used the butt as others mentioned. I've used this cut for other recipes in slow cooker and it works well. It is definately cheaper than tender loin and any flavor difference is minimal. The purpose of the root beer I'm not sure. I've done other pulled pork dishes that were just as good, thus the reason for 4 stars. It is good, but nothing special to other ways of preparing pulled pork. Much of the flavor of this recipe depends on the sauce you choose. I did add a lot of fresh garlic, as always. Made sliders with Amish Cole Slaw. It was a hit, but so was the way I've always prepared. Again, no differing value by adding root beer. The slow cooking is what makes it "melt in your mouth".

Delicious! And so easy, even my boyfriend could do it! We used 1/2 of a 5.? pound shoulder roast (so 2.5+ pounds)and added salt, pepper, and garlic. I left the ingredients and the instructions with the boyfriend and went to work. After 6.5 hours it was not falling apart yet, so I turned it up to high for an hour. At 7.5+ hours it was shredable but could have cooked longer, but the kids were hungry so I drained it, shredded it and added the sauce. Most people cooked it in the sauce for another hour or more, but we didn't have time. Everyone loved it, even the picky 7-year-old! I had to stop the boyfriend from eating his third sandwich. I served it with Cole Porter Slaw from this site, which is awesome. Next time I will allow more cooking time, and maybe just use regular A&W instead of fancy local artisan root beer (the taste was a little overpowering). We will definitely make this again!

Delicious and so easy! I used pork loin instead of tenderloin and Bullseye Carolina bbq sauce. Served on buns with Paula Dean's Buttermilk Coleslaw.

TO DIE FOR! First time making pulled pork, I used tenderloin(long skinny kind) so I didnt have to deal with the fat..yes it may be a tiny bit drier to use in a crockpot but I really didnt notice or mind. It came out amazing! What happens is it will soak up the bbq sauce so make sure you account for that if you do use tenderloin. The fattier cuts prob wont soak it up as much. I did a dry rub of onion powder, s&p and let sit in freezer baggie in fridge all day. About 1030pm I cut each of the 2 tenderloins into sections so it would be easier to shred and wouldnt be long strings, jabbed them a few times w a knife and put into the cooker covered 3/4 of the way w A&W rootbeer turned on low. In the AM I drained, wiped down crock and let pork sit about 15 min before I shredded it, poured bottle of Sweet Baby Rays sweet n spicy (make sure to get this kind) and put whole thing cooker and all into fridge for the day. About noon I took it out, gave it a stir, this is when I noticed it sucked up most of the sauce so next time I will get bigger bottle..cooked on low for hour and half and OMG!!!! The flavor is just killer. It would be a tiny bit better only if it were a tad bit saucier but I did not feel like running out for more sauce.. other than that I would not change a thing! Def will make many more times thanks for the recipe..

Fantastic and very easy to make! 

Some reviews say that Pork Shoulder is no different than the Pork Tenderloin... trust me, the Tenderloin makes a world of difference as does the BBQ Sauce. 

I also suggest that adding a chopped Onion from the start is a fantastic idea as well. I also add a half cup of Red Hot or sometimes a few dashes of Daves Insanity. Subsitute a nice Porter Beer in place of the Root Beer for a slightly different taste!

Just remember Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin. Its worth the extra few bucks and a lot better cut, less fat and the 4 lbs you get instead of the 2 Loin is usually fat weight. The Shoulder leaves fat bits floating in your pulled pork no matter how much you trim it.

Loved this recipe...very easy and tasty.  I may have solved the issue of the root beer taste.  I made two batches of this recipe using pork shoulders for a pot luck.  With the first shoulder, I put the pork in with the fat side down, added root beer about half way up the sides of the slow cooker and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The pork was tender and delicious but not falling off the bone.  When I cooked the second and much leaner shoulder, I placed it in the slow cooker with the fat side up, again adding root beer about half way.  The second shoulder was fall off the bone tender but there was a distinct root beer taste and the pork was way too sweet.  It seems having some fat melt into the liquid neutralizes the root beer flavor.  At least that way my experience.

We made this for a baby shower BBQ we had last week.  I used a shoulder roast that was on sale, got a 2 ltr of root beer, soaked the meat in root beer all day and then the night before the BBQ we started the slow cooker. (Make sure the meat is covered completely) In the morning, we drained it and added BBQ sauce. It was perfect.  All day we were complimented on how good it was.  No one knew how simple it was to make! We served it with grill onions, next time we will add coleslaw.

This is a great recipe.  I used Fitz's Root Beer, which I highly recommend because it uses real sugar, and because - it is from St. Louis!!  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and the root beer and after the pork tenderloin was done cooking I shredded it, added Sweet Baby Ray's and put it back in for an hour.  Hubby LOVED it, as did the people at the party I was hosting.  I had lots of requests for the recipe!  I combined it with the top rated homemade coleslaw from Allrecipes and it was so good!  BTW - I add Stevia instead of sugar (1/2 the amount called for) in the coleslaw recipe.

Mmmmm... I love this recipe. I currently have a batch cooking in my sow-cooker. The only variation I have for this is that I start to separate the pork slightly after approximately 4 hours to let the juices soak in. The reviewers who tasted rootbeer in the meat; did you drain, sauce and continue to cook for about one hour? if not, the rootbeer is still sitting on your meat and that's why you're tasting it!! There is a great "Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce" recipe on this site, which I am eager to try with this recipe. However, so far, using Kansas City Style Smokey BBQ sauce has been a total HIT. This is one of the best tasting pork barbeque sauces I've found so far and is kid-friendly.

The best pulled pork ever. For the cooks who had the taste of rootbeer, I dont know what happened,because I HATE rootbeer and I could not even tell it was used!I poured the rootbeer until it covered half of my seasoned meat as was suggested by some reviewers. It fell apart it was so tender. My husband said we no longer have to go to any bbq restaurant for pulled pork!!!!! And I also liked that it was absent of all the vinegar flavor that you sometime get in restaurants.Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

This was excellent. I did modify by adding some mustard and using a pork roast vs. the loin, but really, either way is just fine. We loved every bit of it!

I hate root beer. Let me reiterate. I absolutely despise root beer. But I found this recipe, had just bought a slow cooker, and my fiance loves pulled pork. So I tried it. I was stunned to taste it! It came out perfect! I stirred it a couple of times an hour, and seasoned it with salt and pepper beforehand. Perfection! Couldn't even taste the root beer with the barbeque sauce on!

This was actually just simple and easy! I read over some of the recent reviews. The root beer worked better than water as far as the texture of the meat goes more than actually flavoring the meat. I had no issues with cleaning the root beer off of my crock pot, it actually came off with just water. My crock pot isn't anything fancy either, just an old hand-me-down one from a friend of mine who replaced hers a couple of Christmas' ago. Maybe that person didn't add enough root beer and/or over cooked it. Anyway, this was a great recipe. I work nights, so I just popped this baby in the crock pot with the root beer and cooked on low while I slept about 6 hours. When I woke up, I just drained the meat, shredded it, and topped it off with some sweet generic bbq sauce that I had in the fridge. =)

This was the easiest and the BEST pulled pork.  My daughter was skeptical about using the root beer, but after tasting she suggested I use 2 pork butts so we would have leftovers!!!  Will definitely make it again.  It's also very economical, I think my pork butt cost $9 or 10...pretty cheap for 5 people (most of whom had 2 sandwiches each)

OMG I'd give 10 stars if I could! I used a picnic shoulder cut.  Don't be afraid to use a cheaper cut because most of the fat cooks off & what is left comes off easily.  I covered the roast at least 1/2 way w/ rb, flipping it over the last couple of hours to make sure the whole thing was tender.  I cooked this over night all together about 11 hours. Lightly mixed 3/4 bottle bbq sauce & kept on warm for another hour to incorporate flavors. This was the most tender juicy pulled pork sandwich I ever had!!! Everyone loved this! I will definitly make again & maybe even for the next b-day party we have!  This is our new favorite recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I have made this with pork tenderloin and cheaper cuts of pork. Personally, I like it either way equally, so I will go with cheaper cuts! While I have made it using root beer I have also made this with Cream Soda on a few occasions and beer every now and then with great success and wonderful flavor! So don't be afraid to change it up and use what you have. But for me, the key to a great pulled pork sandwich lies in the quality of the BBQ sauce. For the best you will ever put in your mouth, try Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site. It is off the charts delicious!

AWESOME!  I cooked two 8 lb. boston butt pork roasts in my slow cooker.  I cooked both for approximately 7 1/2 hours. I shredded and added sweet baby rays sauce.  I did save several ounces of juice from the slow cooker and added a small amount of liquid smoke to give it a "cheater" smoky flavor. the juice/liquid smoke mixture over top and it kept it moist.  I poured  I served it on mini Hawaiian rolls, yum!!!

So easy, so good - I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sauce - just enough to coat, then I let my guests add additional sauce to their own sandwiches.

There aren't enough adjectives to describe how good this is! The root beer gives the meat an unbelievable sweetness and goes well with a robust tangy barbecue sauce. We make this one often.

This is the easiest recipe! The pork falls apart, so shredding is easy, and you can vary the flavor by changing the sauce you choose to put in during the last 30 mins.  We prefer a sweeter, honey based BBQ sauce; works well with the root beer. :)

This recipe was unbelievably easy and was so good.  I made for the first time & took to work for a pot luck and everyone raved.  I will make this my standard recipe for pulled pork!

This recipe is so simple and delicious. I used pork shoulder instead, about 2.5 pounds. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce: Sweet and Spicy. Turned out great!

So good!  I did not do pork tenderloin, but had an almost 5 lb cut that was 6 grams fat/serving, which was in between the tenderloin and shoulder butt.  It was on sale for about $10.  I cut some onion and laid in on the bottom of the slow cooker bag.  Then put the pork on top and sprinkled with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and seasoned salt, then covered the entire thing with root beer.  Flipped 3.5 hrs later and then about an hr before eatting, I drained bag and put in a new one.  I skimmed off the fat and then shredded and covered with Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  Also added more seasoned salt, pepper and onion powder to taste.  5+ stars!!!  Made enough for 15+ sandwiches.

I just tried the finished product and it was phenomenal! I was a little unsure about the root beer but it was great! I used a 2.5lb pork butt rubbed with Montreal steak seasoning then placed into some chopped onions and topped with root beer. Sat on low for 7 hours and it was great shredded then smothered with rendezvous Memphis BBQ sauce. The root beer just enhanced the flavour... My house did not smell funny nor did I taste it!

Fantastic recipe, but I do make a couple of changes! I put a dry rub on my roast that consist of brown sugar, Montreal chicken spice,and a little bit of fresh ground coffee. I leave it in the fridge for 4-6 hour or overnight works too. Then I sear the outside of te roast on my kamado BBQ, and then it goes in the slow cooker for 8hours with the root beer! My family LOVES it especially on gameday!

This was literally the perfect recipe. I was nervous about the rootbeer and lack of other seasonings, but i followed this to a T and it was soooo yummy.  Even my mother who normally picks at food like a mouse ate 3 sandwiches.

The pork comes out moist and mouth-watering! So easy to pull!
Since everyone here likes different sauces, after I pull the pork I let everyone load it up on their buns and then add whichever sauce they want! Everone always asks for seconds!
Makes a great lunch the next day too! I put some pork in a microwave-safe container and add sauce on top. The bun is wrapped up in plastic wrap and put separate from the pork so that it won't get all soggy before lunch. Once the pork+sauce is warmed in the microwave, it is just a matter of scooping it out onto the bun! Delicious! :)

WOW!!  These are excellent!!  I covered my pork loin in Montreal Steak Seasoning and used the root beer as directed, with our favorite Amish BBQ sauce...it was BURSTING with flavor!  This will definitely be a staple for us this summer, with it's simplicity!

Very good. I could taste the root beer but it wasn't overpowering. I used a homemade sauce then left it in the crockpot another hour. I didn't see much of a difference from using beef broth which I normally use. Both are very tender and I think I prefer the taste with the broth even. But it was good still.

A little dry.  No root beer effect.  It just tastes like the bottled sauce.

Delicious and super simple. I sprayed the slow cooker (as suggested by another review)for easy clean up and yes, it was a breeze. I did not have root beer so i used ginger ale and it was delicious.  Oh yeah, and I used pork shoulder instead of the more costly pork loin.  Its so nice to walk in and smell a great dinner and I dont have to do too much to get it on the table. Highly recommend this dish

The pork was tender and juicy, and, saturated with Sticky Fingers Memphis Original Barbeque Sauce, totally delicious.  We used King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to make awesome sliders.

This is awsome!!!  I used two 4lb tenderloins and 1.5L of rootbeer.  My family could not stay out of it while I was shredding it.  This will go into the dinner rotation for every other week.  Have 3 teenage boys and can never seem to fill them up.  This did the trick!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have a pulled pork recipe that I use and found this one to be easy but bland. Like many other reviewers, I used a pork shoulder and saved a lot of money vs. a tenderloin. However, the flavor that came from this was mostly from the barbecue sauce and not the pork.  Just didn't work for me.

I love pulled pork - and this is no exception. Easy to make - I leave it in my crockpot all day and go to work. Then I smother it in Stubb's Spicy Bar-b-q sauce. Perfect for everyday and all holidays. :D

this was the best and I mean the best pulled pork ever. I used coke because I didn't have root beer on hand and added a little water to dilute the extra sugar and it tasted fabulous. thanks for sharing this recipe will definitely make again.

THis is an amazing recipe. It was very simple and everyone loved it. My husband who does not like pork even came back for second helpings. One tip is to use high quality root beer.

Wow, what a hit. Even my friend who will get up a 4am to put pork on the smoker thought this was great. I don't think he believed me when I told him how easy this is.  Thanks so much for another winner.

I really didn't like this very much. The root beer gave it a very strange flavor. I much prefer the Slow cooker Texas pulled pork recipe on here.

I use regular pork roast (cheaper cut) since I will cook in crockpot for 8hrs on low. and with the basics from this recipe I added a touch with 5oz of horseradish sauce rub on pork and slice 1/2 onion and use only 8oz of rootbeer or coke. If you do not like the smell or taste of onions then pass on the onion. The horseradish gives a savory flavor & brings out the 'meat sweetness' (not the sugary type of sweetness). I add horseradish sauce to rub on my beef too when I cook pot roast. give it a try!

I did not care for this recipe. The smell of the pork cooking in the root beer was unappetizing. Fortunately, after draining the root beer, the barbeque sauce helped mask the root beer flavour, but not entirely. I have learned my lesson, root beer is not a cooking ingredient.

Excellent recipe! I substituted the root beer for Dr. Pepper and used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. It was a BIG hit.

Easy when you can't do smoked pork.  All the flavor is in the barbecue sauce you choose, however.

I made this for a Super Bowl gathering last week and it turned out great.  I'd never made pulled pork before, so I was eager to try, but a bit worried about this unusual recipe.  Like others suggested, I used a cheaper/fattier cut of meat and cooked it in the crockpot.  I put the 4+ lb butt in the crockpot along with a 2L of rootbeer and cooked it on low overnight as one of the previous reviewers did.  It was bubbling and fully cooked the next morning (8 hrs).  I then removed the meat, cleaned off as much fat as possible while shredding the meat, and strained the liquid.  After cleaning the crock pot (messy from bubbling soda), I put the meat back in, added a bottle of barbecue sauce as well as plenty of the reserved rootbeer to fully cover the meat.  After stirring to mix the liquids, I put the crockpot in the frig for about 6 hrs to let it marinate further (as another reviewer suggested).  I then pulled it out, turned it on low for 2 hrs and high for 1 hr to thicken up the liquid some.  The meat was tender and flavorful and all of us enjoyed it.  I'll definitely make this again and do it more often, keeping some for leftovers and maybe freezing some.  I may experiment with barbecue sauces in the future but this basic, easy recipe is great is a winner as is!

Easy and delicious.  After shredding the meat, I put it back in the (emptied) crock pot to warm with the sauce.  Will definately make this again.

This is a solid slow cooker pork recipe. One thing to add:  instead of hamburger buns, you should use Sweet Hawaiian rolls, which are lightly toasted. Also, a crunchy coleslaw and pickles are an important addition.

Super easy! Less fatty and healthier if you use tenderloin but also drier. However, once you've added your BBQ sauce it doesn't really matter! I used a 12 oz bottle of root beer plus an entire bottle of beer to cover as much of the pork as possible, since I left it held together in the string. Easy to clean the crock pot afterwards since it was on Low, maybe the beer helped that. I might try it in just beer next time, maybe a dark one, or with half the amount of root beer. I wasn't keen on the smell of the simmering root beer. I also might try with a cheaper cut of pork next time and see if there really is more flavour. I followed others' advice and salt and peppered the roast, then pierced it all over with a knife and turned it over every couple of hours so all parts would have a chance to be in the liquid. Maybe this is why mine took 9 hours on Low to cook. I also threw in a clove of garlic for more flavour. It pulled apart easily. I had to then put it in the fridge overnight since it was too late to eat for dinner. I reheated the next day in a pot on the stove . I put some in a pot with just Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and a splash of cider vinegar, and some in a pot with a combination of Stubbs BBQ mopping sauce, Sweet Baby Ray's which my husband loved, since the Stubbs sauce is spicier and more vinegary. I prefer it sweeter myself, with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese. Served with homemade cole slaw. Yum!

Fantastic!  3lbs on low for 8 hours.  Used Bulls Eye.  (Its the best!) Easy and delicious.  Night 2 I stuffed heated tortillas, filled with leftover pork, lettuce and cheese for barbecue wraps.  Super yummy both nights!

first time on the slow cooker, and this recipe worked well! we used a pork shoulder (also called boston butt). the 12 oz of root beer (stewart's) didn't cover it, so we just topped it off with water. we drained & shredded with an hour left and added jack daniel's original bbq sauce. looking forward to eating the leftovers lunch today!

Well, my first successful slow cooker recipe (just got mine).  You know what, it couldn't have been easier, or more delicious!  I followed the recipe to the T.  I had to use 2 1-lb tenderloins.  Would absolutely make this again!  Used Sweet Baby Ray's original, of course.

Made this pulled pork for my New Year's Eve party.  There wasn't a single bit left at the end of the night.  I rubbed Mrs. Dash all over the pork and I used pork butt instead of tenderloin because the meat guys told me it would be better. The teenage boys told me "it rocked" and my chef friend asked for the recipe.  It's super easy and incredibly delicious!

Very good!  I ended up buying a 3 lb. tenderloin, but it was still done after only 4 hours on low in my crock pot, (it is always fast cooking).  I would make this again.

This is by far one of the best pulled pork recipes I've ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly as written, cooked my pork approximately 6 hours and it turned out so tender and moist. I used Jack Daniel's honey smokehouse barbecue sauce which really complimented the pork. My family couldn't stop eating this and I've been requested to make this many more times in the future, and I'm sure I will!

Made this several times.  So easy!  We used 2.5 lb Pork Shoulder.  I believe it was Hormel...and already had some "slow cooker seasonings" on it.  Used about 16 oz root beer (generic brand).  Let cook for 8-9 hours.  Then used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.  We bought King's Sweet Hawaiian rolls which make small sandwiches, but they taste so good with the pork.  One time we added coleslaw to the sandwiches as well.  Very tasty and VERY easy!

Absolutely delicious!  I used pork loin.  I followed the recipe as far ingredients, but cooked in pressure cooker rather than slow cooker, because I like the way the pressure cooker infuses the flavors.  The meat was 'melt in your mouth' tender and had a delicious flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Used the Restaurant Coleslaw from this site....that was awesome also.  Great combo!

I have always loved pulled pork and was anxious to try this recipe based on all the positive reviews-however all I could taste was root beer.  I actually used only half the amount it called for and still the taste was overpowering.  I drained all the root beer off for the last hour of cooking, and still could taste the soda.  I will try it again using chicken broth as some others suggested.

Wasn't really impressed with this dish..I followed many of the suggestions using a shoulder instead of the tenderloin..If I should try this again I think I would drain most of the liquid out and substitute it with more BBQ sauce.

I love pulled pork and so does my husband.  I fix this recipe quite often.  However, I use my own homemade bbq sauce.  I am not wild about bottled bbq sauce and never buy it.  But with the homemade sauce this recipe is delicious.  I love the rootbeer twist and the acid in the rootbeer makes the pork very tender.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! Made it exactly the way the recipe states and it was very tasty and tender. Perfect for a cold winters evening.

Great way to make this- super moist and falls apart. Make sure you don't use a pork tenderloin though. It is too lean and turns into rubber.

this was absolutely delicious. few things to keep in mind, and this saved me: 1) do not use pork tenderloin. the cut is not fatty enough, and way too expensive for this dish. use pork shoulder instead. 2) make sure to cover the beef in root beer, this may require more than one bottle. 3) i cooked this for the first time and got scared that it was so tough after 6 hours. it really softened in hour 7 and 8.

I make this just as it is written. I love the pork tenderloin in this recipe. I have made it several times and my whole family enjoys it too. My son liked the idea of root beer in the barbecue so much that he thought it would be good on top of everything else which he found out isn't true but it was funny anyway.

I made this recipe at least five or six times already, and have always received rave compliments on my pulled pork!

I use pork shoulder or pork butt (so much cheaper for same results), pour in the root beer, and forget about it for 8 hours.

One night I only had 3 hours, so I cooked it on high for 3, and the pork wasn't tender enough to pull apart. I did the next best thing, sliced it up thinly, and put it back in the crock pot with Sweet Baby Ray's Brown Sugar BBQ sauce liberally slathered on everything. At the potluck, everyone RAVED about my BBQ pork, it may have been better received than my pulled pork!

Regardless, I love cooking pork this way - it's no fail tender pork! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this recipe using a 4.45lb pork shoulder instead. Also used 1 cup of water and poured half bottle of root beer over the meat and cooked it low for 8 hours overnight. I than drained the excess liquids. Shredded it and added the BBQ sauce and the rest of the root beer cooking it on low for 90 minutes. It was so tender and awesome!!

Mmmmm.  Delicious!  I poured about 20 ounces over a 3 pound pork sirloin roast and slow cooked it overnight, about 10 hours on low.  In the morning, I emptied the root beer out of the crockpot and shredded the pork (it literally fell apart), placed the pork back in the crockpot and added 2 cups of Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce from this site and cooked on high for 4 hours.  This was AWESOME.  My husband loved it!  Tender, juicy, and great flavor from the BBQ sauce.  Who would've thought root beet could tenderize this meat so well?  Looking forward to eating the leftovers tonight!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a 6lb. pork shoulder, increased the cook time to 9 hours, and used Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. I served this at a party and everyone couldn't get enough!

Very good, however I'm glad I put salt, pepper, and garlic on the pork roast before I put the root beer in.  I used 2 cups root beer next time I think I will use more.  It was so nice not having to worry about dinner at the last minute!

Awesome recipe and it's super duper easy. Picking the right bbq sauce is key and then cook it for another hour so the flavour is absorbed. I like to add onions to the root beer and meat mixture to give it a bit of a kick.

I made this for company and they all had seconds!  I used a pork shoulder instead of tenderloin and added Franks Red Hot Sauce for a little kick and it was delicious.  I also make a coleslaw with crushed pineapple that compliments the pulled pork amazingly.  Making this again tonight...Loved it!!

The first recipe I tried with BBQ - strange seeing as how I grew up in Texas! 

I added a few of my favorite spices on the pork tenderloin before pouring in the root beer.  Some lemon pepper salt, season salt, garlic powder, some southwest chipolte season. Then I added about 1/4 cup of white cooking wine.  

It has quickly become a family favorite and now I can have a good BBQ sandwich anytime!

This is so easy and so good.  Slow cooker for about 7 hours, BBQ sauce, Buns, Pickles, Onions,big glass of southern ice tea and you have the best barbeque sandwich dinner.  Delicious. I was skeptical about the rootbeer but it is great.  My son loves this. I used a boston butt and is turns out fantastid.  I have made this several times and alway good.

I used 1.5 lbs of frozen boneless chicken breasts - since that's all I had.  Added spices & cooked in A&W root beer on high for ~1.5 hours.  Switched to low and cooked another 7 hours, flipping halfway through (I didn't have enough to cover the chicken and didn't want it to dry out).

Drained the root beer, added Ken Davis' Original BBQ sauce.  Shredded the chicken and cooked on high for about 20 more minutes.

My son said it was the best thing he'd ever eaten!  That alone gave it 5 stars.  :)   Will definitely make again!

I had never made Pulled Pork before and after reading other reviews decided to go with a pork shoulder to get better value for my money. I added some minced onions in with the rootbeer and the sandwiches turned out delicious. Melt in your mouth. Loblaws sells a President's Choice Pulled Pork Sauce which I used for this and it was quite tasty.

Very good and extremely easy.  I bought a 4 lb boston butt roast and cooked it for 10 hours till the bone slipped out without resistance and the meat shredded easily.  I drained the slow cooker, shredded the meat, added the sauce and then stuck it back in the slow cooker for another 30 minutes.  I would suggest you use a spicy barbecue without a lot of sweetness.  I used a variety of Bullseye bbq sauce with molasses/brown sugar and the pulled pork is very sweet - almost too sweet.  Other than that, this 4 lb roast gave me enough for 16 sandwiches.

This is the easiest and best slow cooker recipe I have tried!   The root beer is the key b/c using coke can make it burn and become syrupy.

Seriously...how does it get any better than this?  It doesn't.  Easy and absolutely delish!!!  The whole family loved it, and with 3 kids, that almost never happens.  I used a pork shoulder/butt because that's what was on sale and KC Masterpiece Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce...also on sale.  This one is a keeper!

My son is very hard to cook for a basic fast food junkie.   I don't enjoy cooking!   I ran across this recipe and I also used 4 pound shoulder cut.
It was amazing!   My son and I both really liked it and we ate on it for several days.  I recommend this to all.   Very easy and reheats well.  I used the Kaiser rolls and toasted them.

I prepared the recipe as written.  I was pretty tasty, but next time I think I will season the meat with some salt and pepper and garlic powder as others suggested.  I used sweet baby rays sweet vadalia onion BBQ.  I would suggest a more savory sauce for the pork because the sweetness of the sauce was just a little too sweet for this recipe.  Overall I liked the texture and I think with a little more seasoning and the right BBQ, this recipe would be a winner.  But pretty good as written :)

This pulled pork was the best! I as well used a shoulder (boston butt) I rubbed it down with pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic salt, and paprika and let it sit for a little before putting in the slow cooker. After six hours I pulled it and smothered it in Sweet Baby Rays. Sliced up some onions and put it all back in the cooker for another hour and a half. Amazing served with coleslaw on top!!!

FANTASTIC & SIMPLE!!!  I used a 12 lb Pork Butt roast (which is perfect for pulled pork!)  I brought it to a Potluck Resort Dinner for approx. 50 strangers and they ALL (ages 2 yrs to 72 yrs) RAVED ABOUT the pulled pork.  Complete strangers asked if they could take some home (their cabin at the time), it was THAT GOOD!!!  I LOVE to cook, but I really LOVED HOW SIMPLE this recipe is when you are pressed for time!!!  I used "Sweet Baby Rays" SWEET & SPICY which has a MAJOR kick to it.  EVERYONE LOVED IT.  I also used a very expensive 16 oz "glass bottle" of rootbeer although I think any rootbeer will do.  I could only fit the one bottle in the crock pot although I had 12 lbs of pork.  (No more room) and it was perfect!!!  I also added more sauce of course due to the amount of pork I used.  DELICIOUS!!! Cannot wait to make it again.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Delicious.  We used about a 7 lb. tenderloin, dry rubbed some salt, pepper, red cayenne pepper, minced garlic and garlic powder.  Then added the ketchup and root beer.  After about 6 hours, we shredded it and gave it another hour to soak in the juices.  It was so simple and was wonderful!!  We served on rolls with shredded cheddar cheese.  Will definitely put this in the rotation.

Oh my goodness this was good & SO easy.  Get a big pork tenderloin/roast as it REALLY cooks down while in the slow cooker.  I was afraid that I would not have enough meat.  Luckily, once shredded, there was more there than I had thought.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you!!

I made this for my daughter's 4th birthday party and it was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe to feed 25 people and there was hardly any left at the end of the party. I am going to make pulled pork like this from now on!

I'm sorry, but this was nothing special to me. I think an onion, garlic and maybe a stalk of celery would have been a better choice for flavor. The Root Beer gave it an off flavor that the BBQ sauce had to cover up. Keep in mind I'm not talking about a strong flavor, just a slight flavor of what I consider an off taste. I doubt if you will ever find someone identify a root beer taste unless you tell them beforehand.

Those that have smoked meat often will probably be puzzled why this flavor is desirable. I suspect to those that don't eat a lot of smoked meat, this gives them some sort of hint of a smoky flavor. 

Another mentioned using Dr. Pepper, and I suspect that might be a better choice. As far as some claiming the meat was dry, that is fixed with a simple solution that every competitor in a smoke-off contest uses. Right after cooking, wrap the meat (with juices) in aluminum foil tightly and then wrap it in a blanket, and let it set for one hour. The juices are pulled back in the meat as it cools "SLOWLY." In my case, it was as simple as reducing the Crockpot to "warm" (I have 3 settings high, low and warm) the last hour, and leave it to cool with the Crockpot turned off for an hour. It was really juicy. Only after this point to you discard the remaining juice.

As one person said, it stinks while cooking. This was the reason I cooked on the patio and after getting a whiff when opening the Crockpot, I would say they are right. I probably cooked it about 8 hours in all.

So simple!  Hubby is in love with it, and was requesting it for Superbowl Sunday while still chewing.  I used a 2.5 lb pork shoulder, store brand "old fashioned" cane syrup based root beer, cooked on low for almost nine hours.  Drained, shredded it, put it back in the slow cooker for another hour with Sticky Fingers Memphis style bbq sauce.  Served it on lightly toasted Kaiser rolls with a side of home made potato salad.  AMAZING!  This will definitely be made again... and again... and again...

So I realized I had pork after thinking it was beef! (I can't cook that's why I'm here!) This recipe seemed easy so I tried it. It was excellent!! I cut up an onion, seared the roast and cooked 4 hours. I picked up the bone  with no meat on it. I was able to stir the meat which pulled  it apart it was so tender! My first ever pulled pork was a hit. I must have called 20 people to tell them. Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband liked this pretty well, and it was certainly effortless to make. He felt there was too much sauce, and I used less than recommended. Used a sauce that was quite smoky and that seemed to be a good thing. Thanks!

Excellent!
I used a bottle of beer in place of root beer. I cooked mine on low for 5 hours and then drained the liquid and shredded the pork.  I then added it back in with the BBQ sauce on low for 45 min.
I will make this again soon!

Perhaps I added too much root beer...I used more meat (not tenderloin), but covered the roast in the slow cooker like some mentioned. Cooked over seven hours. Still not fork tender and tastes like root beer. Interesting idea, but this is one I won't make again.

Easy recipe.  The pork was decently moist, but I was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  It never did pull apart too easily.  I would recommend flipping the pork every couple hours, so that the whole piece gets the juices and flavor.

This was very good and the best part is it took less than 5 min to prepare the meat to put in the crock pot.  My husband raved about it.  (probably because it was something different!) and my 3 yr old kept saying "mmm".   I also used another cut of pork that cost about $5 for just over 2 lbs.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

In a word - perfect! The root beer really imparted a nice sweet flavor, and was better (for my tastes) than using vinegar as the acid. The meat was so tender we had a hard time even removing it from the crock pot! I used homemade BBQ sauce, and this was the best pulled pork I've ever tasted. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

We liked this.  My husband said, "this is better then I expected, I don't usually care for pulled pork".  I loved it for simplicity and ease.  The kids weren't so hot about it and my older one ate it only with coaxing.  I used sweet baby ray's original sauce and found it still had some kick - no additional seasoning is needed if you use that sauce.

This was very tasty and quick to prepare in the morning.    I used 2 1 lb tenderloins.  The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it tasted a little too much like the root beer.   But it was very tender and i would make again.

This was a HUGE hit with my family for a get together.  I used 4 lbs of pork and filled the crock pot with root beer.  I cooked it on high for three hours then on low for 3 more hours and it was fantastic.  I drained the meat and shredded it and stirred in our favorite BBQ sauce.  We had 8 adults and 6 kids and it was ALL GONE!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I added onions and garlic as other have to 2.5lbs "pork carnita" meat and it came out perfect.  With Sweet Baby Ray's "Sweet & Spicy" bbq sauce, you don't really need much more.  Certainly an easy dish that can't go wrong!

I used to make pulled pork that required a 2 day process, brining for a day and cooking the next.  No longer, this is now my go-to pulled pork method.  For health reasons I had to give up the brining, but would have anyway now that I've tried this.  I used diet root beer and Kinders BBQ, topped off by a healthly dollop or two of Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce.  Turned out sweet and Hot, just like I like it.  It verges on almost too sweet, but to me adding the heat from Dave's brings it all into balance.  And my wife, who is not a pepper head, likes it too, just omit the Dave's from hers.  Pairs nicely with French Sourdough bread!

For the most part this is how I make Pulled Pork but instead of Root Beer I use canned Beef Bouillon and it is sooo good.  I will try the Root Beer next time to see which one I like best.

This is so easy to do, and very tasty!  I add only a little Seasoned Salt and a Barbecue Spice to the pork 10 minutes before I place everything into the crock pot.  The cook time is closer to 8 hours, and the last hour I keep the crock pot on the Keep Warm setting.  This meal feeds the 2 of us for at least 3 meals.

Even though the root beer was drained from the meat, before adding the BBQ sauce, it still tasted like I had spilled my soda on my main meal. Way too sugary tasting.

I've already made this twice! The first time I used root beer but I bought boston butt or pork shoulder and I used stubbs bbq sauce (2 bottles) and it was yummy! I cooked it on low almost all day and it was moist but didnt shred as easy as I
hoped, but still good. I just made it again but didnt have root beer and used 2 cans of coke instead and cooked it on high most of the day and used a very lean pork tenderloin and it pretty much shredded itself without the fat chunks! I used 2 bottles of bulls-eye and it was just as yummy if not better! This recipe is soo simple and is soo good! I suggest to follow the directions with the tenderloin cooked in coke, drained and add your fav bbq sauce. Easy

Pretty good!  My picky kid loved the root beer pork (that I set aside before adding the sauce).  It was a bit bland, so next time I'll season the pork and maybe add an onion to the crock pot.  Thanks for posting!

DO NOT MAKE THIS UNLESS YOU CAN STOP YOURSELF FROM EATING THE ENTIRE THING!  This is AMAZING!!!!  I will never make pulled pork any other way.  I used a bottle of IBC root beer and for the bbq sauce - Bull's Eye Original.  Best recipe ever!  Thank you!

I just made this, was not keen on the taste before I added the BBQ sauce, it was a bit sweet and weird but then I'm not a fan of root beer, will try cola or Dr Pepper next time I think. After I added the BBQ sauce it tasted a lot better.

Pulled pork is not a dish that we are familiar with in the UK but having tried it on holiday I was keen to find a recipe when back at home, so pleased I did, as this is now a family favorite. 

We do not have root beer so I used coke instead, used pork shoulder as per other reviews making it a much more economical meal. Also rubbed in some chilli seasoning mix to the pork before putting it in the slowcooker but when using a better brand bbq sauce I could miss this step.

Such a simple dish and by far the best slow cooker meal I have made.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time was with a pork tenderloin cut, the second was with a pork blade roast (boston butt.) I highly recommend going with the boston butt, because the meat has more fat and it tastes a lot better that way. No matter if you're using 2 lbs or 8 lbs of roast, just cover the roast between 1/2 and 3/4 the way with root beer and cook it for 8 hours low and slow. Drain, pull, and sauce it up. Yum!

Oh. My. Gosh. Best. Pulled. Pork. Ever. 

My boyfriend, who makes really good pulled pork, even bowed down to the this one. I following the recipe exactly as is and wouldn't change it for the world. I served it on whole wheat buns with a little cheese and the Aw-Some Cole Slaw  The kids I babysit even devoured it the next day. It only got better with time. Thanks for sharing!

This is WAY TOO SWEET!  Ditch the root beer and slow cook it in chicken broth, then add the bbq sauce.

This was awesome!  I also used the cheaper cut of pork as suggested in another review and after 7 hours it just fell apart.  I will definitely make this again; it was a huge hit with everyone!

Overall I ended up with a fairly nice slab of meat. I don't believe the Root Beer did anything at all for the loin.  I had to use a rub from another recipe and glad I did because the meat would have been quite tasteless.  This recipe also loses points for asking you to use prepared barbeque sauce.  I used a delicious sauce recipe I got somewhere else and would suggest you do the same.  

So as a whole this recipe requires too many additions and judgements calls to give it a high rating as a stand alone.  I suggest trying a different pulled pork recipe altogether.

Ok, I do cook a lot and was skeptical about the rootbeer but it came out great. I did use a pork butt cause there's more fat content and it doesn't come out as dry as the tenderloin.

YUM YUM!!!!  The only thing I did different was cooked it with the BBQ sauce and some water (with the root beer) and 4 minced cloves of garlic.  I think next time I'll also rub it down with some salt and pepper before cooking!  Served it with sweet potato fries!!  This is a keeper!

This meal was super easy, and tasted great! I put it in at 10 in the morning, and by 5 it was falling apart as we took it out to shred it... then we put it back in with the BBQ sauce and let it cook on low for another hour.. Great fast meal!

I was a bit skeptical when I saw the only ingredients for the slow cooker were pork loin and rootbeer, but dinner was delicious!  The pork was falling apart after 6 hours and was just wonderful with the bbq sauce.  This is a keeper!

Used 2 pounds of pork shoulder. cooked as directed for about 51/2 hours. Then I took out and shredded the pork. Put the root beer jus to the side. I didn't pour it out. Covered the pork in Heinz Honey BBQ sauce, the rest of a Chipotle glaze I had left and a little Worcestershire sauce.  I then let it cook for another hour or so. I toasted the buns in the broiler. We paired it with recipe "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I, By: Marsha" from this site.

I made this for the first time a few months back when my husband and I moved into our new place and were throwing a house warming party. The feedback was amazing! We had another couple over, both who aren't fans of pork and they were the ones raving the most about it! Months later, they're still asking when we will be having them over for more of those delicious pulled pork sandwiches! I've made this several times since then and honestly, I just can't get enough of it! Typically I pair this with the Tangy Coleslaw also from Allrecipes... give it a try, I promise you won't be disappointed.

One of the most delicious meals I have ever made. I used pork shoulder, but the butcher told me you can use pork butt/ pork steak and it will be just as good and cheaper than a tenderloin. I put cooking spray on the sides of the slow cooker to keep the root beer from sticking and burning. Followed the recipe to a T! Cooked for about 7/8 hours. Shredded the pork, pulled out the bone, doused the meat in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (a MUST!), let it cook for another hour (well, admittedly I took a bite from the slow cooker every 2 mins because it was so delicious). Outrageous! Can't wait to make it again.

Had to give this 5 stars.  Really the only thing I changed about this recipe is I added cola rather than root beer. I prepared this a day in advance minus the sause.  About an hour before serving I placed in slow cooker and added sweet baby rays.  I made this for approximatley 20 people and got rave reviews.  So easy, will be doing this again for those "get togethers".

So went to the store and they only had one package of a pork tenderloin left and didn't have anymore (I hate getting the last package of something, i know weird, lol) but I saw that they had turkey breast tenderloins availabe so I bought that.  Besides the change of the meat, I basically did as the recipe stated...root beer and Hunts honey bbq sauce ( i prefer Open Pit but couldn't find any).  It came out AMAZING!  Definitely not dry and very flavorful.  I could taste the root beer just a little but it wasn't overwhelming.  Would definitely make again!

This recipe couldn’t be easier and makes tender pulled pork but I wasn’t fond of the subtle flavor of root beer that peeks through.  I’ve made this in the past with ginger ale instead of the root beer with a sliced onion which I find has a better flavor.

This was the most tender pulled pork I have ever had. It's only as good as your bbq sauce though. So play with it and customize your sauce. I used stubbs (texas thing) spicy and added brown sugar.
Next time I will split the pork in half and use 2 different sauces.  I also used pork loin roast. (mostly white meat) instead of tenderloin. Thanks for the easy yummy recipe

I added bbq sace to the cooking liquid and seared the pork first in the pan. I also used a bbq rub for a bit more flavour. I would have given it 5 but I changed things.

This was good but the pork wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be after cooking in the root beer !
I left some of the juice from the cooker in and then added the barbecue sauce - think it would be better to drain it all and then add sauce as recipe indicates - it certainly doesn't have any root beer flavor !  
This was good but not a "mouth watering, must have it again" recipe !

OK, all I did was rinse the pork, put some A&W Root Beer in the crock pot. 7 hours later I shredded it, put the sauce in and BOOM!

I think my father in law likes me now!

PS: I did chop up one onion and put in half way mark.

used 5 1/4 lbs pork shoulder.  trimmed as much fat as I could off of it.  used 2-20 oz. bottles of root beer to cover the roast.  drained off liquid in strainer after about 7 hours and shred it then added 1-18 oz. bottle sweet baby rays hickory bbq and 18 oz. regular sweet baby rays.  buttered the rolls and put in the oven.  Every one loved it.  you could take some pork out before adding bbq sauce and reserve it for tacos for the week.  my 5 lb. shoulder could have made at least 10-12 sandwhiches.  fed 6 adults with lots of leftovers.  served with chips and coleslaw.

This was pretty darn good. I'm not sure what the root beer was supposed to do though, because I can't taste any difference in the pork. Perhaps the barbecue masks differences in flavor. I'd like to add a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix, garlic, and/or Worcheshire sauce in the future.

My husband loves this recipe.  I bring it to our get-togethers and there is never enough left.  Depending on the party I have to buy 2 roasts.  Either way, there are never left overs.

This recipe is amazing.  The pulled pork was so tender.  My husband said the pulled pork tasted like we went to the restaurant.  Oh yeah!! I was smiling!!  I did change the recipe by adding seasonings to meat about 10 minutes before it was finished.

I didn't taste the root beer and the smell of warm root beer made me want to barf.  I cooked it just shy of 24 hours.  Once I strained the root beer out (while gagging) I pulled it apart.  Although I couldn't taste the root beer, this was some amazing pulled pork.  I thoroughly enjoyed leftovers, which I normally hate.  =)

Used a Boston Butt-first night without sauce-great! I was hesitant about Root Beer, but loved its flavor. The second night we had leftovers and added Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce. Excellent.

Delicious. o.o But I could taste a little bit of the root beer since I like my sandwiches with just a bit of BBQ sauce. And, actually, I don't really like root beer...Next time I will just use beer. :) Or maybe a can of pepsi or something. Thank you for the recipe though!

Needed a ton of pulled pork for a grad party.  Did an experimental one as written here.  Very good.  For the remainder, I put peppers, onions, garlic, carrots, etc. along with the pork & root beer.  After I took the pork out, I hand blended the remaining liquid and veg.  Then added the bbq sauce.  Excellent.  Served on smaller buns (Costco) to make go further - sorta slider style.

Wow! This is so simple, and yet it tastes delicious. I used Barq's root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's Original sauce. After 6 hours, I drained the liquid and then shred the pork. The tenderloin pulled apart SOOO easily. I mixed in the BBQ sauce and kept it on Low until my side dish was ready (Baked French Fries II from this site!), about a half an hour. I put my hamburger rolls under the broiler for just a minute or two and they were toasted to perfection. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!! I will be making this again and again!

This was my first time making my own pulled pork and it sure did come out good! I had a 2.25lb pork shoulder on hand and I used the sweet ray's honey bbq sauce. I did need to add some extra from another bottle because it didn't look wet enough. Came out great. Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband, the usual cook in the house, gave me the raised eyebrow when I told him what was in the crock pot. (We were having guests over.) But when he sat down to dinner and tasted it, he proclaimed it the best pulled pork sandwich he'd ever had. It received rave reviews from everyone, even the kids. I did add more root beer than the recipe called for because I had a larger piece of pork (shoulder instead of tenderloin), and it was wonderful. Took other's advice and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Awesome!

very good! doubled the BBQ sauce. also, if you heat this up the next day, add a bit of water and more BBQ sauce to restore the pork to being juicy.

This was awesome... my boyfriend is not a pork fan so I made this using Tri-Tip. It was great. I cooked it as instructed and then prior to serving I mixed a little A1, Famous Dave's BBQ, a little Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ. Toasted a light fluffy bun I got at the bakery with some Mozzarella Cheese... My boyfriend normally enjoys my food, but I knew this was something extra special when he told me 8 hours later... that sandwich was great I've been thinking about it all day! He said it was better than this local BBQ place we go. I was astonished. This is a keeper!

I've made this numerous times and have made a couple of changes each time.  I always add a few onions slices cut up because I like the flavor. I also use a pork shoulder. But where I make some interesting changes is the soda.  I love the root beer but have used beer in the past and also Dr Pepper. I know that sounds strange but it's great.

Update: Last couple of times I made this I had added onion soup. I kept the sauce that was drained, put it in the refrigerator, scimmed off the fat the next day and froze it.  Today I add  little bit of pork, carrots, some water and put it back it the pressure cooker. Added some noodles and it as another whole meal. I've also added some potatoes instead of noodles in the past , thickened it a bit and had a great stew.  Really extends the original meal.

I have to admit I was afraid of using rootbeer but decided to give it a shot since I read the reviews and most people said it was a great recipe.  To my surprise, it is definitely a GREAT recipe.  I rubbed it with sea salt, garlic powder, black pepper and some liquid smoke.  This is a keeper and I will definitely use this recipe to make pulled pork again.

I used what I had in the freezer, which was a pork tenderloin. I used diet A&W Rootbeer and cooked the pork until the thermometer reached the 170 temp, the the pork turned out very tender. Pulled apart very easily. I  made sure that I drained the pork well before I tossed it with bbq sauce and returning it to the slow cooker to warm completely  through. At the very end I added a few dashes liquid smoke, for a subtle smoke flavor.

had a 5 lb pork shoulder (bone in).  placed it in my 5 qt slow cooker.  poured in 2 cans of a&w root beer around the sides.  cooked it on low for 7 hours.  it still wasn't falling apart so cranked it up to high for 90 mins and it was done.  it was falling off the bone.    took out the pork and put it on a platter.  shredded it.  dumped the root beer and wiped clean the slow cooker.  put the shredded meat back into the slow cooker and poured 3/4's of an 18 oz bottle of stubb's smokey mesquite bbq sauce.  set it on low for 1 hour.  came out super moist and flavorful with the bbq sauce.  put potatoe rolls side up on a pan and set it under the broiler for 10-15 seconds.  served the pulled pork on them.  thanks for a simple and easy go to recipe to feed a bunch of folks for cheap.

This was a big hit at our Ravens football party and was so easy to make. Marinated a pork butt in the root beer over night. Put pork in slow cooker and filled with fresh root beer. Cooked as directed. Used Sweet Baby Rays BQ sauce. It was excellent.

I really liked this, and it couldnt be any easier. Only thing I did different is I uses a 4.5 lb pork Boston butt roast. I coated the meat with my home made BBQ rub and put it in a ziplock with a bottle of good root beer (I used Frosty). I let that sit overnight. Next morning I tossed the roast into the crock pot with a fresh bottle of root beer, some fresh minced garlic and some liquid smoke and cooked on low for about 6 hours. This is where you have to watch not to over cook it. Some people complained it was 'mushy', I assume from being overcooked.  I turned the roast as it cooked and broke it up as I went. When it was cooked I dumped the liquids, shredded the meat ( tossing as much of the fat as I could pull out. Then put back in crock with a bottle of Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce and cooked another.  I've cooked pulled pork before, and this was the best results. Served with home made baked beans and a salad for a true BBQ feast. I'll make again.

Family loved this and very simple to make.  I used the pork butt about 4 lbs.  Feed us four with 2 full plates for left overs.   Went with the small rolls to serve.   My 13 yo thought it was awesome.   Used the dried onion flakes, some s&p and turned over the meat mid-way.   I had it on slow cook for only about 6.5 hours (mostly because I forgot to start on time).   It forked apart effortlessly at 6.5 hours.   I drained off juice (and fat) from the crock, replaced the now-pulled pork and reconstituted the meat using about a 1/3 of bottle of BBQ sauce.   I went light because I didn't want to loose the nice hint of root beer.   Some added more sauce at the table but most liked the mild but not over-sauced flavors (including me).

SO simple and the taste is AMAZING!  Used Pork Shoulder and it just melted in my mouth.  Also didnt have rootbeer so used a Dr. Pepper instead.  This has become a permanent recipe to stay in our family!

Simple and yummy. I just used the rootbeer and then I had pulled pork, cheese and spinach quesadillas and then added the bbq to some of the leftovers for garlic toasted sandwiches. Perfect.

I used a large pork roast instead of the tenderloin.  Like a previous reviewer, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy.  It gave it a zing without too much heat.  And I used a bottle of IBC Root Beer.  It came out delicious!  I used potato rolls which were the perfect complement.

I myself have never had pulled pork BUT my boyfriend is a big big fan and his family comes from the south.  He said it was the most amazing he has ever had anywhere, he even told his whole family how great it was and now i am requested to make it for them.  I used 16oz of rootbeer and a little bit of good garlic salt and that is the only thing I did different

Fantastic! It's the only time my husband has actually liked my BBQ. It's so tender. I rubbed the roast in salt, pepper and garlic powder first. It's become a regular recipe in my house. Thank you for posting it!

My fiance loves to order BBQ pulled pork almost every time we go out to eat ANYWHERE! (Including places like Cheesecake Factory.) It's one of his favorite go-to American foods. One night, he had a taste for them but we're now on a strict budget for our wedding. So I suggested he look online for a recipe. He found this one, so I picked up the ingredients, and he prepared it the next morning. When I got home from work, I drained it and put the bbq sauce in there. I never would've thought to use Root-beer to flavor the meat. This is just as good if not better than the pulled pork they serve in restaurants. This is a go-to recipe on a hectic work week for us now. Thanks!

My family aren't big pork eaters at all they tell me No to pork, but the supermarket had the loin of pork on sale, so I figured since I am the cook & if they are hungry enough maybe they would try something new. I found this recipe & I looked at lots of reviews & decided to cook it. Well it was the easiest thing to make & to my amazement THEY ALL LOVED IT, I doubled up on the BBQ sauce otherwise it would have been to dry. 5 stars for this one, & I went back to the store & bought 2 more loin of porks to put into the downstairs freezer, so goes to show you  MOM KNOWS BEST

Doubled the recipe (4 lb tenderloin) and made for a get-together.  Served with King's Hawaiian sweet rolls, and Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce. Delicious.

Amazing with pork!!!....and also with chicken.  For either protein, I use 16 ounces of diet root beer, 9 ounces of A1 cajun sauce and 9 ounces of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  (Then add a little bit of both to taste.)  I have cooked it on high for 3-4 hours and it has turned out exceptionally well.

Only as good as the BBQ sauce you put on it!  Really, it is a simple recipe.  I used the pork tenderloin as asked for because it was on sale for $2.99/lb.  We prefer ours a little saucy so needed a bit more than the 18ounces (some could have been the pork was a little more than 2 lbs too).  I used Cookies BBQ sauce as that is my favorite.  Turned out very tender and my family loved it!

This recipe was amazing! However, I did substitute the pork tenderloin for a 5lb fresh pork shoulder.  It was cheaper and I think more flavorful.  I did trim off most of the fat and seasoned the pork with garlic powder, pepper, complete seasoning, an Adobo before placing it into the crock pot.  I also used 2 cans of Mug Root Beer since it was a larger peice of meat than the recipe called for. My whole family loved it and it was even better the day after!

Perfect!  I have made this twice in the last week, once for an office potluck and once for Sunday Football, and both times it was a hit!  I, too, was nervous about adding the root beer, but for some strange reason it works.  Only change I made was adding some kosher salt, cracked black pepper, and minced sweet onions before adding the sauce.  Oh, and I doubled the recipe both times; I used a a 4 lb. pork shoulder/butt, A&W root beer, and SBR bbq sauce. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, I used pork shoulder like most other reviewers.  I added some apple cider vinegar to the bbq sauce and after shredding it put it back in the crock pot for another 30 minutes.

so easy and so good. i used pork shoulder (boston butt) and rubbed salt, pepper, and garlic salt all around it. dumped it right into the crock pot with a the root beer. Afterwards, emptied the juices from the pot, added a 1 sliced onion to the bottom of the pot, then the shredded pork with bbq sauce mixed in it. After an hour or so, i mixed everything together. oh boy...i cant stop eating it. OH! and for an extra kick to the bbq sauce, i added sriracha hot sauce (thai hot sauce with a rooster logo on it).

Absoloutley Incredible!!!!! I made this for my coworkers during a Pittsburgh Steelers Tailgate Party. It went over very well. I added a dry rub (Cajun, garlic, dry mustard, salt & pepper) before putting into the rootbeer. Also after draining and pulling, I added about 1/2 cup of the rootbeer back into the meat then added the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce. This is a keeper. And sooo easy. Thanks for posting this one.

One word....AMAZING. It was so easy to prepare and the outcome was a hit. I'm not a big fan of pulled pork but my boyfriend is and he loved it. Next time, I will use a different BBQ sauce. I chose a sweet one this time but will choose a spicy on my next round.

Wow this is the best pulled pork I have ever had by far. My mother in law got me hooked. My daughter and I just it in a bowl with the juice. No bbq or bread it is so good. We have made it with tenderloin or any old pork roast that is on sale and it always taste the same. If you do not have Root Beer, Coke or Dr Pepper works just the same.

Really, really easy and GOOD! I used a lean pork roast instead of tenderloin and seasoned it with garlic powder, pepper, and a little salt. I used one can of diet Barq's and then used Sweet Baby Rays sauce...delicious!! Thanks for sharing- we will definitely make this again.

I used about 6 pork sirloins, which was a total of about 4lbs of pork, and it's a lot more lean than a pork shoulder, and a lot cheaper than the tenderloin. I had to put about 5-6 cups of MUG root beer for the soda to cover the meat, which I recommend doing. I also recommend marinading the pork the night before cooking in a mesquite type of mix. I used McCormick GrillMates Mesquite flavor. When making the marinade I add a few extra spices like cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, white vinegar and some whisky. Also when I went to cook the pork in the morning I add about 4 tsp of minced garlic to the crockpot. I cooked it on low for about 11-12 hours and it was so easy to pull apart, it was breaking in half when taking it out. I recommend saving about 203 cups of the rootbeer mix from teh crockpot to spread over the pork after done shredding it.  I didn't use the BBQ sauce and mix it all together to cook longer because I wanted to use some of the pork for tacos as well, and I didn't want the BBQ sauce on the meet. Awesome recipe, and I will use this one from now on. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I used a Pork Roast cut in between the shoulder and the tenderloin, and it was SO tender!  I actually used apple cider vinegar as my tenderizer because I didn't have root beer, but I used A&W root beer Barbecue sauce so it may have had a similar taste.  It was so so flavorful.  I also threw in some chopped onions that were a nice touch but probably not necessary to make this a great pulled pork recipe!

Simple.  It came out perfectly.  We used a pork shoulder roast and cooked it for about 7 hours with our solar oven. The meat and root beer were in a black ceramic pot with a glass lid.  The trick is keeping the temperature low enough (not full-on sun).  We turned it over a few times and on the last attempt it fell apart, just right ....

We also made corn bread (  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grandmothers-Buttermilk-Cornbread/Detail.aspx )


and coleslaw ( http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/restaurant-style-coleslaw-i/Detail.aspx )


... add the bbq sauce and some baked beans. We thought we had died and gone to deep south food overload heaven.

I made this for out 4th of July picnic. Everyone thought it was out of this world.  I am planning on making it again for a family reunion next weekend. Very easy to make.  I did substitute the pork loin for a pork butt instead because I was feeding a lot of people.  Great recipe I would never have thought using root beer.

I have a large family which consist of mainly growing boys so I used pork shoulder 9 pounds to be exact instead of tenderloin. So aside from the different cut of meat I made it exactly as the directions say and lets just say I had no need to wash the crock since my 5 boys pretty much licked it clean. They have already put in thier birthday dinner order lol!!!

Made this for my July 4th BBQ. It was so incredibly popular, everyone asked for the recipe! Many said this was the best pulled pork they had ever eaten! I am so pleased that this is now one of my new "signature" dishes. ha ha   **Made it with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce.

I used this recipe in the crockpot with a less expensive cut of meat. It costs less and tastes better that way. The longer it cooks the more tender. We are picky BBQ people. I will make this again.

I've had better pulled pork but this was easy. I did however make pulled pork nachos the next day with the leftovers & that was so good! I spread out some chips, spread out some pork, a drizzle of extra bbq sauce, cheese, jalepenos & microwaved. After, I put a big dollop of sour cream in the middle. Very Tasty!

Absolutely delish! Followed recipe to a T with the exception of using a pork butt roast instead of the pork tenderloin that was called for.

very good>> in fact delicous!!  I put a small pork tenderloin my crockpot with a  bottle of rootbeer on low as directions said for about 6 hour. When I  removed it -it shredded itself and  fell apart.  I  followed the rest of directions, but used alot  less bbq  sauce and that was  plenty for us  -tosted the buns - we  put sliced sweet onions,  mixed sliced peppers and thin slices of tomatoes in our sandwiches  -it was  very good- infact my hubby had these recently at a catered meeting luncheon  he was attending and he said mine were  as good or better!  thanks for posting such an easy  recipe.

This is the easiest recipe ever.  Followed exactly as written except used a much cheaper pork butt and trimmed the fat before cooking. Use enough root beer to cover your meat. Used Bandanas Sweet and Smokey bbq sauce.  Prepared for a birthday party and everyone loved. Even got a call the next day from someone that wanted to prepare it that day. Served with kaiser rolls and also mini rolls and an assortment of cheeses.  Yum.

Soooo Good! This is one of my most used recipes when having a group of people over. It's so easy and gives the flexibility of using your favorite BBQ sauce. It's great served with "Zesty Cole Slaw" from this website. The slaw is best served ON the sandwich! Delish!

I started with a leftover pork roast and onions... simmed the shredded pork in a can of Dr. Pepper on the stovetop for about an hour.  Then I added BBQ sauce (his favorite brand, but not mine!) and added spices to make it pop a bit more (parsley, garlic and chili pepper).  It is WONDERFUL.  I will totally make again!  Plus, this was my first try at pulled pork!

The best pulled pork that can be made year round.  Nothing beats summer bbq's and this is the perfect pulled pork without a mess.  I used a very cheap pork sirloin roast and worked well.

delicious! I used Hansons rootbeer added a few spices while the pork was cooking (garlic salt, pepper, and a hickory rub) then used a hickory BBQ sauce. So Good, never would have thought to use rootbeer I love the slight hint of rootbeer once all the sauce is added, so good!

Turned out great!  We did not add the barbecue sauce in while cooking.  We left the meat plain and gave each guest a small bowl and multiple choices for sauce.  To each their own.  Not a drop was left and everyone wanted to know what that distinct flavor was.  I never did tell them it was the rootbeer.  I was already told I must bring some to the next family function.

I made this recipe for the first time today and it was very good!  I used what I had on hand - a 2lb pork tenderloin, one 12 oz can of Diet Barq's Root Beer, and a 14 oz bottle of Danielle's PNW Sweet & Spicy BBQ Sauce.  I served it on toasted Sweet Onion Buns with Coleslaw and some Baked Kettle Chips.  I also topped each sandwhich with a bit of Dijon mustard and chopped red onion.  Very good flavor and easy as recipe is written and it made enough for my husband and I to have sandwiches all week.  I like my BBQ a little more spicy so I left the leftovers in the crockpot on warm and added some McCormicks Steak Seasoning and let it meld for a few more hours.  Very, very good!  Will go into our monthly menu rotation.

This was amazing!  I was a little worried about what a pork roast cooking in root beer was gonna smell like all day in my house and to my surprise it smelled just like an awesome barbecue.  I followed the recipe exactly and used the pork tenderloin.  I know some suggest other cuts of pork but I say use a tenderloin.  Super tender. tons of flavor and a lot less yucky fat!!!

this is SOOO good and SOOO easy!  we had leftovers of this for mother's day and gave it to my mom in corn tortillas with cheese and she went crazy and went home and made it herself and said it tastes better than the local bbq joint.  my husband had the great idea of letting the bbq sauce soak into the meat for one day in the fridge before serving.  makes a big difference.  VERY yummy!

Very, very good pulled pork!  I would've given this 5 stars, except I was disappointed that the root beer really didn't do anything to the flavor.  I used a Boston Butt, as other reviewers suggested, and it fell completely off the bone, which was then easy to remove and meat was easy to shred.  I also rubbed crushed garlic over the meat to enhance the flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was outstanding!  I cooked the pork on low for 8 hours, drained the root bear, shredded the pork, then put it back in the slow cooker with a bottle of Jack Daniels sauce for another 30 minutes.  Served it up on kaiser rolls toasted in the broiler.  Will definitely make again.

I did what others suggested and rubbed the tenderloin with salt, pepper, and some dry onion soup mix. The meat was so tender. My husband really enjoyed this. I'm not a fan of pork, but it was very tasty.

Delicious. I used a bottle of ale instead of root beer, and I added 1 cube of chicken bouillon. EXCELLENT results, and so easy.

Made this for my sons Birthday, and my guests couldn't stop eating this! It's so easy and VERY delicious. I added a half an onion, chopped, to the root beer as it simmered. I also cooked this on my stovetop since I do not have a slow cooker. I used a pork shoulder as suggested and I wouldn't go for anything else. The last thing was that I didn't use all the BBQ sauce they called for. I added it to taste.

I made this for a birthday dinner and my guests were gushing all night.  I used pork butt because it's much cheaper and just trimmed it carefully before cooking.  This is an instant hit and I will make it many times in the future.

Amazing/easy recipe. The only warning I have to give is not to use a sweet barbecue sauce. The root beer and a sweet sauce will yield a VERY sweet meat. I used Baby Rays Sweet&Spicy sauce and it was too sweet. Next time I'll make it with a tangy sauce and should come out much better.

This is the best (and easiest!) meal I've made in the slow cooker.  I followed the directions exactly, except I completely forgot to drain the rootbeer and it was still delicious.  The extra bit of liquid kept the meat nice and moist after reheating a few times (as it lasted several days!)!  We will definitely make this again.

Perfectly Simple & Simply Perfect~  Didn't change a thing~ Would make again and take to a potluck with toppings like cheese & onion.  Can bring it right in the crock and keep it on warm or low, just might need a bit of extra sauce so it doesn't dry out.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS EASY DISH!!!

Amazing! I have been wanting to try this for a while and I am so glad I finally did! I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I added about 5 other ingredients that I think really helped the overall flavor of the dish. I used a 7 lb. bone in shoulder cut. I seasoned it very generously with Slap Ya Mama (cajun seasoning) and I also rubbed it down with some liquid smoke. I cooked it on low for 6 1/2 hours with a bottle of IBC rootbeer and a small can of beef broth. I also added an onion and about 4 cloves of garlic. I took it out the slow cooker to shred it and it was just falling apart it was so tender. I was very nervous about the rootbeer but it was actually really nice. I could taste it but it was very subtle. It just gave it a nice sweetness. When I added all the pork back into the slowcooker I left a little bit of the juice and then I used an entire 40 oz. bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbeque sauce. I had some of the honey bbq on hand too so I added a little bit of that too. I continued to cook for another hour on low. Yummy!!!! I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!!!

I wan't sure about the root beer, but it made it taste amazing.  I did use a tenderloin and it turned out fabulous.  The smell when it was cooking was great. We're definitely going to keep this one.  Just be sure to spray the crockpot with a cooking spray first and the clean up is easy.

I've tried this recipe at least 3 or 4 times now and it's been a hit every time!! At first I was unsure about rootbeer.... but it's amazing. LOVE this recipe.

So so easy. Like some of the others, I changed it to a Boston Butt for a juicier piece of meat and less costly. You don't have to change a thing on this recipe.  You "can" add to it if you want by rubbing it with garlic and bbq spices ahead of time

Best pulled pork I've ever made/ate in my life. It was so good. Cooking the pork in the rootbeer worked out really well. I left just a little bit of rootbeer in the slow cooker and used some Dinosaur BBQ garlic sauce and some Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce. Turned out nice and sweet. It would probably be too sweet if i used a sweet BBQ sauce so this worked out perfect. For sure will be making again and i might cook the pork in some sam adams instead of the root beer just to see what kinda flavors i get out of it. All in all an amazing recipe

This is it!  I (for one reason or another) didn't think that you would actually be able to taste the root beer it was cooked in, but you can.  And it's amazing!  Made according to recipe using our home-made BBQ sauce.  Wow!

Very easy and delicious. I followed other commenters suggestions and used a shoulder roast purely to save money. The only other thing I changed was I seasoned the roast with salt and garlic before cooking. I left it in the slow cooker for 7 hours, drained the majority of the drippings, shredded the pork, and added a generous amount of Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce. I then refrigerated it overnight, took it out in the morning and put it back of the slow cooker on low for another 4 hours. It was delicious!

The best pulled pork we've ever tasted!! We used Boston Butt and Mug root beer. We used lot more of the root beer than suggested since we wanted to cover the meat pieces. We cooked it in the slow cooker on low setting for 8 hours. The meat was moist and flavorful! After draining the fat and liquid off, pulling the pork we added around 6 ounces of Hunt's BBQ sauce and cooked in slow cooker (low) for another 30 mins. It was delicious!!!

This is UNREAL. So delish. I used a can of Coke since I didn't have Root Beer, and the pork shoulder cut (here in south Texas it's labeled CARNITAS). I used homemade barbeque sauce. Make this and let the compliments ROLL in.

Like other reviewers, I used a Boston butt.  SO EASY and it was fabulous!  My husband is rarely impressed with my cooking but commented several times how much he loved it!!!  He said it tasted like a pulled pork sandwich from a BBQ restaurant.

Needed something simple. This was it!  I used two tenderloins (2.7 lbs total) and rubbed them heavily with McCormick's Barbecue seasoning, placed them in crockpot and slowly added 1 1/2 cans Barqs rootbeer.  Cooked on high for 6 1/2 hours, then shredded the pork, drained the rootbeer off, stirred in 1/2 - 3/4 c. Jack Daniels #7 BBQ sauce and let heat through 30 minutes.  Served on homemade hamburger rolls (allrecipes, too) with additional BBQ for putting on top.  Husband and kids raved.

I am making this for the 4th time on Christmas.  I use a 5 - 7 pound pork butt and almost cover completely with A&W rootbeer and cook in crock pot on low for 7-8 hours.  I always have rave reviews!!  This is so easy and delicious.

Good, not great.  I used a shoulder cut, rubbed with garlic powder, salt and pepper for a moist pull in the crock pot.  I used A&W Rootbeer nearly to cover the roast, but supplemented with vinegar.  Cooked overnight before pulled, drained and tossed with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce in the morning.  Guests raved, but the flavor was a bit too sweet for me.  I'll experiement with other marinades in the future.

This recipe was fantastic!  I took some suggestions from the reviews and this dish was absolutely delicious.  I added some garlic, diced onion, and used the regular Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  The garlic gives it a lil kick to it.

Excellent recipe! I was skeptical about the root beer, but the pork came out great! I think the root beer gave a slight sweet taste to the BBQ sauce (used Sweet Baby Rays Original).  Next time I will make my own BBQ sauce.  For those that said that the sauce was too runny, make sure you drain out the root beer from the crock pot.

Made this last night. My husband said if he'd ordered it at a restaurant, he'd have been very pleased. I used the tenderloin-- yes, more expensive, but much, much leaner. No grease. Used 1 lb. tenderloin, 1 can Dr. Pepper (which I didn't drain). Was ready to be shredded after only about 6 hours on low (less than some other folks), added a mixture of 3 sauces and some diced onion, let it cook one more hour.

Great flavor and easy, easy, easy! My grocer had very cheap pork tenderloin on sale, so I used that, but next time I'd like to try the cheaper cut pork butt to see how it compares. We both loved this recipe. To those who found it too soupy; didn't you drain the meat before you put the sauce? No reason why it should be soupy if you did.

Being a new wife I'm trying new things in the kitchen. I feel like my husband and I don't have exciting meals...this added excitement. This was so delicious and I feel so liberated that I was able to make this successfully. My husband ate 3 of 'em. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was so easy and tasted great! Served on whole wheat buns with sweet pickle chips. I was surprised at how tender the meat was....the rootbeer really added a little something special. I did have a little trouble trying to drain the liquid from the meat. I ended up just forking the roast into a spare bowl, emptying the rootbeer down the drain and then putting the roast back in my slow cooker and adding the barbecue sauce. I will definitely make this again. It was inexpensive to prepare and very tasty. Next time I make this will separate and freeze individual serving sizes.

Prepared this recipe the first time early this summer based on the rave reviews. I did use garlic and onion and Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Have also done with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle Sauce and it was even better. My husband ordered pulled pork at a restaurant recently and told me I should give them this recipe.  This has become an easy to make favorite!

I'd browned my pork loin (4-5 pounds), but when I put it in the crock pot, I realized I was missing an ingredient in the recipe. A few clicks later, I found this recipe. I'd never heard of cooking meat in root beer, but I had it and decided to give it a try. ... I poured in a can of A&W, and cooked it on Low for about 7 hours. ...The meat fell apart without any help. I put it in the fridge (crock and all) without pulling it apart or draining the fluid and exchanging it for BBQ sauce. ... We're adding sauce as we take the meat out (the meat fell apart by itself).  I like it plain, or with a mild BBQ; my husband has tried BBQ sauce and other spicy stuff. It's so good! I'll definitely make this over and over!

High praise for this recipe!!  Especially coming from my husband, which I didn't tell him that it was made with Root Beer.  He would not have tasted it if I told him what was in it.  I sprinkled a Pork Butt Roast with garlic powder prior to putting the lid on and viola!  Absolutely excellent and I've already shared with family and friends.  My 8yr old couldn't get enough after her first taste!  Thanks so much!

This was amazing, I cooked it exactly as the recipe called although I used a smaller pork tenderloin since I didn't need as many servings.  The taste was perfect, the meat was tender and pulled apart easily.  I served on garlic kaiser rolls which I toasted just a bit.  I used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce.  This will be a new staple in my house!

Super easy and very tasty!  I've tried more complicated pulled pork recipes for the slow cooker and this one is by far the one my family likes the best!  One change, though ... instead of a pork tenderloin, I use pork butt (a.k.a. Boston butt).  I tried the tenderloin, but the butt is much more flavorful for this recipe, and it's less expensive.

My Family loved this. It was quick, easy, and very filling. We even had enough left for lunch the next day. I changed it up a bit. I seasoned the meat and put it in the crock. Then I added a full bottle of bbq sauce (I added water to half the bottle, shook it, and added it in) and stirred until coated. I poured root beer in until meat was just about covered. Cooked it for several hours (4 on high). Then I added in diced onions and stirred. Let cook for 2 more hours then drained. Shredded meat then added a large bottle of bbq sauce. Put back in for about 45 minutes to heat up sauce. Served on sesame buns. Great with coleslaw and tots.

I made this for a large gathering and it was a huge hit!  I used a 10# pork butt, covered with rootbeer, added a lot of honey over the top and cooked on low for about 9 hrs.  Drained and used Sweet Baby Ray's (my personal favorite)  and cooked on low for another couple of hours.  It was a large pot luck, and it was the first thing eaten!  Many people were disappointed they didn't get to try it after all the glowing reviews!  My brother-in-law was even impressed, which has only happened one other time in 20 yrs.  Super easy, inexpensive and delicious!

This was excellent and so easy.  It was my first time trying pulled pork. I used a 3 1/2 lb sirloin pork roast.  Put in slow cooker with 12oz root beer.  Cooked on low 6-7 hours.  Did flip over half way thru.  Took out roast and shredded with forks.  Left only about 1/4 of liquid and then mixed the pork with 1/2 bottle Sweet Baby Rays.  Placed on toasted rolls.  Served with coleslaw and roasted potatoes.

I also often use a less expensive butt or shoulder cut of pork.  You can increase the amount of meat, just increase the root beer as well.  I have cooked this for large and small crowds and everyone just raves about it.  It also keeps well in the slow cooker for quite a while so it is good for parties like open houses etc.

WOW-nothing could be easier to put together. I just rubbed in some salt and pepper and threw a boneless pork loin into the crockpot with a can of A&W. Decided to make homemade BBQ Sauce instead of store bought. I used the recipe from "Texas ribs" for the sauce. Tasted the pork after shredding it before adding the sauce and almost decided to eat it that way, it was so tasty. Added southern sweet coleslaw and mashed potatoes for the sides--YUM YUM!

This was so easy and so good.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce and A&W root beer.  I also seasoned the pork with a rub of salt and pepper, garlic, and oregano before pouring in the root beer.

Turned out very tender - great technique! But next time I will try using "regular" root beer and sauce, since the all-natural stuff we used (Boyland's root beer and Annie's Smokey Honey sauce) left it tasting a bit... odd. I think good ol' A&W would be tastier in this recipe.

This was honestly the BEST pulled pork I had ever had.  My family loved it!  I used the pork butt as per some of the other suggestions because the cost was better on my pocketbook and it worked fine.  When cooking I added bbq sauce and an extra can of root beer.  It was so tender and delicious.  This will be on our menu many times to come.

I already had a pork shoulder roast, so I used that instead.  Because it was so large (7 lb.), I need 2 bottles of root beer to cover the meat.  Cooked it on high for three hours then 4 hours on low.  After draining and shredding, I mixed in 1 bottle of BBQ sauce and had another on the side for those who wanted extra on their sandwiches.  It was fabulous!  Everyone loved it and the company asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

This was so incredible...I used the Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce with Belle's Hamburger buns. Really, really great! The sugar in the rootbeer is a good balance to the vinegar in the sauce.

I'm not a huge pulled pork fan but was making it for a party, this tasted really well (though I agree about the smell of the root beer while cooking) we used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and the taste was very good.  I will say that the look of using a tenderloin is not as appealing as using a butt/shoulder and since the shoulder is also cheaper I will use that in the future.  Thanks!

Quite wonderful and so dang easy, I just cut my 4lb pork loin in half, covered it with 1 can of Mugg root beer and cooked it for 10 hours on low. I took it out of the crock pot and shredded it and tossed with Sweet Baby Rays sauce and put in the oven for 1/2 hour, which I think is a little sweet, I would try something smokier next time. I served the meat with sourdough rolls and the left overs on tortillias...everyone loved it.

I thought this sounded weird, root beer and pork??  I tried it based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. This is very good.  I did add 1 small onion coarsely chopped and two cloves of garlic, smashed, to the broth to add some extra flavor.  The pork was tender, sweet and flavorful.  What a super easy way to cook pulled pork.  I will definitely make this again.

Cream soda works too, if you don't have rootbeer.  Use about a cup and then add chicken broth (2 cups) when there's about an hour left of cooking time.  Drain the cooking liquid with about a half hour left to go and add BBQ sauce.  Shred meat before serving and stir it in the sauce.  Yummy AND easy!

This is a great recipe, but it needs  rub!!  Although slow cooking is "cheating" over smoking for such a meal, the weather does not always allow for that.  I rubbed the pork roast (not tenderloin) with Montreal Seasoning, let it sit, jabbed it with a knife and added liquid smoke flavoring.  With a few more drops after pulled mixed in with BBQ sauce, it makes you think this was smoked, then slow cooked in sauce as a finisher.  All obviously a personal preference, but think of it as a difference between boiled ribs with sauce on them at the end, or smoked/grilled ribs.  I would watch the saltiness though, as liquid smoke and most rubs are high in sodium content.  Enjoy!

I have prepared this several times now and it is excellent.  The family loves it, so I usually have to double or triple the recipe. My only changes have been in the final stage, where I add a very finely diced onion and garlic to the shredded pork and then top with "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ sauce, then slow cook again the next day. My grandson always requests this dish and asks me to make extra so he can take some home with him.  I think that alone rates as a 5 star recipe :)   Thanks for the great recipe.  L.

OMG!!!  This is soooo easy!! AND it's awesome!!!  No reason not to make this!  I did season the pork with onion powder and garlic powder before cooking.  I also used about 4 lbs. of pork for a family of 4.  Used the Sweet Baby Rays like others suggested and it's now my favorite bbq sauce!  I also buttered the buns before toasting!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Outstanding! I used a 4lb Boston Butt - I didn't have rootbeer so I used what I had on hand - 20 oz Dr Pepper, 12 oz Coke and 8 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. (Wanted enough liquid to cover meat.) Cooked on low for 10 hours in the crockpot. Pork fell off the bone - it was truly delicious and didn't require anything else.  My husband has requested that I make it regularly.  We loved it!

Delicious! I made this last Sunday for football and it was a hit! I dry rubbed the tenderloin with half a packet of Lipton Onion Soup as recommended by an earlier review. I'd also recommend doing so, added a nice flavor to go along with the BBQ sauce. Will for sure make again!

Oh my goodness!  I've never made pulled pork before.  I was nervous about the root beer.  I read the reviews and went for it.  We rotate Monday night football and this was my week.  I made this with 6.5 lbs of pork.  Used Sweet Baby Rays.  It was great.  All the guys loved it.  My husband thought it was great and wants to make more often.  Definitely a keeper.  I just need to add that each of the guys had three sandwiches and couldn't stop talking about it.  I made it Sunday night in advance and it was better the second day.

What a simple recipe!!  And tastes great too.  I followed the steps described in the recipe, but made one tiny modification under the advice of another review...sort of.  I dry rubbed the pork tenderloin with half a packet of the Lipton Onion Soup mix before putting it into the crock pot of root beer.  I don't think it made that much of a difference, but it definitely gave it a nice flavor combined with the BBQ sauce.  It was a hit during tailgating!

This was a big hit at my 4th of July party. I cooked for 10 hours...first couple hours on high and then low. I did use a dry rub I bought from my butcher called "Old Fashioned BBQ seasoning". This was recommended by the butcher and added nice flavor. Everyone asked for the recipe...

I made this for my son's graduation party.  I have never made pulled pork before so I was a little nervous.  The butcher recommended pork shoulder, which is also called Boston butt.  I cooked the pork in the crock pot, drained it, pulled it and added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on Thursday.  Reheated it to serve it Friday evening.  I had rave reviews from my guests.  I made 10 pounds of meat and there was nothing left.  Except for using a different cut of meat, I made the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful! Thank you to Lori Wagner for such a great recipe!

Very Good and Super EASY!!!  I left mine in a crockpot for 9 hours while I was at work.  Came home to a wonderful smelling house and all I had to do was shred and throw in some BBQ sauce and Voila!  Very Good!  **Addition** I have since revised my version of this recipe.  I use the seasoning from "Slow Cooker Carnitas".  Just cover the tenderloin in the seasoning, and place in in the crockpot with the Rootbeer.  It's amazing!  Try it!

This was really good. The only thing differently that I did was the cut of meat. I used a 4 lb. boston butt instead of the tenderloin and it came out just fine and was cheaper. Was a super easy meal. Will definitely make again

Absolutely excellent.  I served it along with the Zesty Coleslaw.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce as others had suggested.

This recipe is sooo easy.  It's perfect the perfect "crock pot" meal.  It's 3 ingredients I already had the pork and the BBQ sauce, but didn't have root beer so I used the Dr. Pepper I had on hand.  It turned out delicious.  I'll try root beer next time as I can imagine that the flavor is better, but it was great anyway.  I'll do this one probably a lot.  You can improvise and use what's on hand.  Even add a little brown sugar if you like that sweet pork taste.

Wow, this is how we make the tastebuds dance! I was a little crunched for time so I did modify it a little; cooking on high for three hours before taking back down to low for another two. Once I finished the rootbeer bath I drained and pulled the meat. It basicaly fell apart trying to get it out of the slow-cooker. I then added my own recipe for BBQ sauce and continued to cook in the sauce for another hour. Serving these delicious shreds of heaven to my guests for my sons B-day party was a definate winner! I will use this recipe again and cannot wait until I do!

This is VERY GOOD!!! Everyone liked it, even the daughter. I made a couple of changes- Since it's what I had to hand, I used Diet Pepsi. I also used Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and a sprinkle of garlic powder and a touch of brown sugar. We had this with summer squash bake and biscuits, which was a great combo. I can't wait to try it with fiddle heads and small red potatoes in spring!!! I will be making this again for sure!

This was the first time I had ever made pulled pork. I was not to eager to make it as everyone always said how much work it was. Not this recipe! I put the meat and rootbeer in the slowcooker on low and left it over night. In the morning when I attempted to take the meat out I had a hard time because the meat was so tender and falling apart. For the sauce I mixed a variety of sauces together.Everyone at the party was raving about how tender it was and the fact that it wasn't too salty or too sweet. I will definitly use this recipe again.

I just moved from North Mississippi and have been missing pulled pork sandwitches ever since.   So, I decided to make my own, and this recipe made my year!  I omitted the Root Beer. (didn't have any)  I usually get 2 - 2.5 lb pork rump roasts, rub them with salt and pepper, poke holes throughout and put in the crock-pot with 1 bottle of bbq sauce.  (I Like Stubbs spicy)  After about 5 1/2 - 6 hours on low, I pull the pork from the bone, and put back in the crock pot for another hour or so.  Serve on Keiser rolls.  ENJOY, I sure do :)

This was my first recipe with my new slow cooker and it was fabulous!  I poked holes in the pork & rubbed it with bbq spice rub (Weber Grill) before placing in the slow cooker.  Following previous reviews, I removed the pork after 6 hours, shredded it and added Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  I cooked for an additional hour on low to let the sauce soak in.  This was delicious!

Wonderful, easy way to make pulled pork!  I used pork top loin and it came out very moist and shredded very easily.

This was a hit for my family. I made it to take over to a family member's house for a lost in our family. This kept my cousin from cooking. My large family and visitors that stopped over found this dish to be WONDERFUL!!!! It was so tender and it melted in your mouth with each bit. We used mini hamburger buns to help it go a long way. DELICIOUS!!!!!! I will keep making this meal for a very long time.

I also added half a cup of light brown sugar, and it tasted awesome. The only thing I would say is that because of the root beer, the sauce is a bit thinner and doesn’t hold on sandwiches well. Be prepared to eat with a fork and knife

When I made this for my family my oldest son said. "Dad, I'd pay money for this." I don't remember what kind of Root Beer I used but I used Sweet Baby Rays original barbecue sauce. One step I did add was to marinate the pork loin in the barbecue sauce overnight.

We seasoned 1.5kg of pork shoulder with salt, garlic and pepper before setting it to slow-cook with 750ml of A&W Root Beer.  Since we didn't have a slow cooker, we put it on stove top at medium-high heat till it boiled, then simmered it on low heat for 3 hours and it turned out tender. The root beer brought out the taste of the pork so wonderfully, I can't believe it!! Everyone in the family wanted a 2nd serving, and that's a lot to say for a choosy family of 6!! Perfect. 

(We also made our own hamburger buns using another recipe on this website. Unfortunately we couldn't find sweet Ray here too, so we got Masterfood's BBQ sauce instead: still delicious.)

This was absolutely DELICIOUS.  I used an 8 pound pork shoulder (why use tenderloin?!?!?), which I cooked in the crock pot covered in the root beer on low for 15 hours.  Drained it and the pork was falling off the bone.  Put the shredded pork in a roasting pan, mixed in two bottles of Sweet Baby Rays and then cooked it with a lid on for another 30 ish minutes at 325.  

Served it at a super bowl party with homemade slaw (the Sweet Restaurant Slaw recipe on this site) and potato buns and all 8 pounds was gone by the end of the night!

This was perfect for our party. I used a bone-in Boston butt, dried it, stabbed it a few times and rubbed with salt, pepper & garlic salt at another reviewer's suggestion. This cooked on low for 8 hours covered in root beer, and then we shredded it and put it back in the crock for an hour mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  So many compliments, and I shared the recipe with two others already. I considered that another sauce would've given it more of a kick, but it really was perfect for those who didn't want anything spicy.  Can easily serve it with other sauce options to top off.  We ate the rest all week, and it only got better by the day. Will definitely make this again.

I think that anything good about this recipe comes from the BBQ sauce that you use. As it is, I was not overwhelmed by the taste of the pork alone, I thought the rootbeer taste was kind of off, but drowned in lots of sauce it was fine, with just a bit of an aftertaste. I've done this before with Coke, and I much prefer that taste, I think (although that recipe also used a pork shoulder, so it may or may not be an apt comparison).

The meat did turn out nice and tender though. I found that just shredding it gave me really long, chewy strands, so I sliced it into chunks of about 1 inch and then lightly shredded it, which gave it a better texture and meant my kids didn't make Chewbacca noises, which they do whenever meat is too chewy.

This was not bad, just nothing special about it.  I made it with a pork butt/shoulder and while it was very tender, it had much less flavor than the way i normally do pulled pork in the crock pot.  Meh.

Like others, I used a pork butt for more flavor. I followed the recipes after this point (used can and a half of root beer with 4 lb butt).

This recipe worked very well with a 7.5 pound shoulder roast and a 20oz bottle of root beer. This required a larger slow cooker - the 7.5 lb roast was too big for the standard Crock Pot.  Used one 18 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce after the long cook, then had another bottle for topping the sandwiches.  Served with coleslaw and baked beans.  Big hit and easy cooking for a large crowd!

Very good but not over the moon about it. I used a 8#+  boneless  butt (shoulder). Trimmed off as much visible fat as possible --I think tenderloin would be too dry.  Started in Slow-cooker on high then turned down to low after about 2 hours--that butt  nearly filled the crock.  Used most of 2 cans root beer and seasoned with a good amount of Morton All-Season. It was done after about 7 hours. Meat fell apart without the need to "shred".  Drained off all root beer juice. As I mixed in the BBQ sauce  (Sweet Baby Ray's, is there any other?) meat  continued to disintegrate. All in all  very tasty but not pretty. Next time will use cola instead of  root beer.and probably won't cook as long.

This worked with extra-thick pork chops well (I didn't see where anyone else had tried using pork chops). I did speed it up to make dinner faster by putting the crock pot on high for about 1-2 hrs until the pork was pull-apart tender. It really comes down to what barbeque sauce you use.

Hands down, the most simplistic yet delicious pulled pork recipe!  I used a boneless pork loin roast and seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I used a fantastic new BBQ sauce at Trader Joe's (Korean Style BBQ Sauce)  because many barbecue sauces  is out there, like sweet baby rays has high fructose corn syrup.   We ate them on Kings Hawaiian hamburger buns! Delicious!

Very simple and absolutely delicious!! I've made this so many times for my family and they always want more. I usually do exactly what the recipe calls for. Only thing I add is seasonings and sometimes I use pork tenderloin and other times, I'll use pork butt. It really depends on the cost either way it always comes out amazing and plenty of leftovers

This was such an easy recipe to get together which was perfect for a busy morning before going to work.   Make sure you use a good barbeque sauce since that is the main flavor that you taste instead of the root beer.  The pork itself was tender and had good flavor, but, in all honesty I think since it was slow cooked it would be more economical to use pork shoulder instead of an expensive pork tenderloin.

I also used a Boston Butt and poured in 2- 12oz bottles of root beer. I also seasoned the roast prior with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. It was the easiest thing I have ever made. Turned it at 4 hours though I don't know it is necessary. Lastly, I did not add sauce (we simply don't care for a lot of barbecue sauce). We added it when we served depending on individual taste. We saved leftover pork for lunch. Without sauce we used it in corn tortillas and added onion and cilantro for something similar to street tacos.

Simple Simple Simple - Used a Pork Roast 3 lbs (vice Tenderloin) -Cooked  Low and Slow 6 hrs.  Drained root beer, shredded and added BBQ Sauce - Turned up to High for about 45 minutes.  Love it.

UPDATE - Made this again.  It is de-LISH
I think next time I may Smoke the PORK an hour or two in my Weber, then drop it in the Crock Pot

Delicious as written. I like a bit more bite to mine so I added some apple cider vinegar and seared the meat before slow cooking. Also use good quality root beer.

If you're looking for something with a unique flavor, this isn't it.  But, if you're looking for something easy to prepare, hard to mess up, and something the family will enjoy, I highly recommend it.  I chose this on a day when we were very busy.  Got the ingredients from the store in the morning, popped it in the crock pot, and went about our business, turning it when I could.  It shredded quite nicely and had a lovely flavor when we mixed it with the BBQ sauce (just Heinz, nothing fancy).

So delicious, so simple! I add minced onion to my root beer/pork. Best w/pork shoulder and butt, in my opinion. I added some of the root beer juice to the pork as I shredded it; the liquid reabsorbed into the meat and made it super-juicy!

I've made this both with a tenderloin as instructed and with a boston butt as suggested by the reviews. I think both ways are great but you do have to watch the tenderloin so you don't over cook it as it can get dry. I love that this is so easy and that it paired well with both the Joe's bbq sauce and the KC masterpiece i had bought.

Have been making this for my family ever since I found the recipe about 3-4 years ago.  Everyone seems to enjoy it.  I have make mine with the pork butt/shoulder, root-beer or coke, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, onion and with our favorite bbq sauce.  It has been a family favorite when looking for an easy meal to cook while away.

A great "starting point" recipe. I have made this 4 or five times and it's always a hit. Add what you like to the pot to suit your tastes. I rub roast (pork butt not tenderloin) with a dry marinade and let it set for an hour. Put it in the pot and add the root beer, a quartered onion and a large clove of garlic. I also let it set over night, scrape of the fat, and then reheat, drain, pull and serve with favorite sauce.

I've made this pulled pork a few times already and I have to say I love it, it's simple to do, it gives the meat a nice sweet taste that I enjoy, especially paired with Honey BBQ, and it's great on Sweet Hawaiian Hamburger buns. The only things I've changed is I use Pork shoulder because it's cheaper, and it pulls apart much better, and I add a little seasoning on top like Garlic salt, Season salt, and Onion Powder before pouring the Root beer just to add a little more flavor but otherwise it doesn't need it. I also followed the advice of a few reviewers by draining and shredding the pulled pork an hour before it was done, taking out the bone, and then adding the BBQ Sauce (I've used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce) and then putting it back in to cook for that last hour. When you do that the BBQ soaks into the meat and it's SO good! Will definitely make this over and over again, even my picky eater husband loves it, and so do our friends who've tried it. :)

I used "Not Your Father's Root Beer" which is an alcoholic beverage as well as a honey bbq sauce. I think this made it sweeter than maybe a regular root beer with an original bbq sauce but I liked the sweetness. I also put the bbq sauce directly on the pork while cooking and added a little bit more after draining. I will most likely use this recipe again in the future.

This is the best pulled pork recipe I have made.  IBC Rootbeer gives it good flavor.  I rubbed a bit of pork seasoning on before adding the rootbeer to the crock pot.   We always use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.   Simply delicious!   I recommend using a pork butt roast instead of a loin.  If your roast is large enough,  you can freeze some for later.

Used a pork butt, and seasoned with Mrs Dash before pouring the root beer on.  I cooked on high for 1 1/2 hrs, and then on low for another 6.  It was very flavorful, and fall-apart perfect.  Even our picky kiddos loved it!

Made it exactly as the recipe was written using Kroger brand real sugar root beer and Kraft Brown Sugar bbq sauce.  The pork was tender and not at all dried out which is a problem I've had with pork in the slow cooker before.  I was originally worried that there would be too much sauce but the full bottle ended up being a perfect amount.  I think this will become a go to recipe.

I made the recipe as is, except substituted pork butt roast for the tenderloin.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce (the 'spicy' one), which I had never heard of until I read the other reviews about this recipe.  We topped the sandwiches with shredded cabbage for crunch.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!  It was excellent - the first time I've made pulled pork.  Everyone loved it.

The root beer gave it an odd flavor that I did not care for, although others thought it was ok. None of us care to have it again, however.

This is fantastic! The only thing I do differently is to put the pork back in the juices after shredding it and then putting the BBQ sauce on it right before serving. My husband and I like spicy BBQ sauce but my daughter doesn't so this way everyone gets what they want and by putting the shredded pork back in the juices it doesn't dry out.

I used a pork shoulder as it was what I had on hand. I followed the directions as stated and it came out marvelous! I used Stubb's BBQ sauce and added homemade coleslaw as a topping. That addition made the dish pop! My family thoroughly enjoyed this dish! Of course it's a keeper!

This was incredibly simple and came out great. To bump up the heat, I used a spicy dry rub on the meat before adding it to the slow-cooker.

Super easy and tasted very tender and nice. I used an almost 3 lb tenderloin in my slow cooker at the #3 setting for about 5 hours, then shredded and added BBQ sauce for last hour on low. Made enough for 9-10 servings.

This has become a go-to recipe for us. I used the suggestions from several different posts to get to our preferred method: I use boneless pork ribs (country style), trim off the fat, salt and pepper and put in the crock pot with the root beer. When done cooking, I pull out and shred in a large casserole dish, mix in the bbq sauce, and then put in the oven at 300 for about 20-30 minutes or until the bbq sauce starts to carmelize then serve. I get rave review and people always ask for the recipe.

This is my go to pulled pork recipe.  I tweek it a little and don't put the barbeque sauce over it.  I buy a pork shoulder butt, better piece of meat for pulled pork. I always stab mine with a fork, then season with salt, pepper and garlic powder before placing in the crock pot, then pour a whole bottle of root beer over it.  Turn on and go to bed.  As a 3rd shift nurse, I need quick crock pot recipes.  Make a little rice and beans, add some salsa, cheese, sour cream and guacamole and you have burrito bowls one night.  Pulled pork sandwiches the next.  Recommend to all the nurses at work.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Started it on a Saturday morning then proceeded to spend the day doing my regular errands and chores. When mealtime came I had a hot home cooked meal I didn't have to slave over. The meat had a slight zing from the bbq sauce I used and was very tasty. Simple, easy, and not time consuming to cook.

Anyone who says you can't make this with tenderloin is crazy, I used 3 x 2lb loins, poked holes in them and sprinkled with pepper and garlic salt, laid them in the bottom of my slow cooker and poured over one bottle of root beer. 6 hours later we had beautiful pulled pork that just fell apart. I mixed with a little BBQ sauce and it was heavenly! Will
Def make again, big hit with my family and guests (4 adults and 4 children) so will def make again!

I really liked this recipe, very simple and easy to follow. I sliced an onion and added that at the very beginning, then drained the liquids out but kept the onions in. The onions were a great flavor add and a nice change in texture too.

This is the first time making pulled pork. I took a suggestion from a friend who is a butcher to use shoulder pork to make this. Since I was making it for a party, I purchased 8 pounds of sliced pulled pork which ended costing $2.49 per lb. I used a full bottle of Freddy's root beer, 26 oz bottle and it barely covered the pork. Cooked it slow for 5 hours and it then turned it up to high the last 1 1/2 hours since I was running short on time. Drained the juices and shredded the pork with 2 forks. It took a while since some of the pork wasn't as tender. Then placed it back in the crock pot and pour a full big bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Cooked it on high for another hour. I had rave reviews and said to make it again at my next party. You couldn't taste the root beer at all. I estimated about 1/2 lb per person since I had 14 over and had about 1 lb left over. The only thing I would do different next time is not to use a crock pot liner since it seemed to take longer to cook things. But great recipe. I guess I need to make it again. Thanks!

So easy I was looking for  something easy  for a family reunion this was it and allowed me lots of visiting time. I used parchment paper as a liner[ I have had bags melt in the roaster pan] turkey baking bags for the pork this made It so easy to cook and once I took the pork out the liquid was easy to dispose of.{ I don't like to pour fat down the pluming as it ends up causing problems later]  Thakyou

I refuse to review any recipe that I've had to modify.  With that said, I followed the directions to a T and my whole family loved it.  We are a small family of 4, so the 2 pounds of tenderloin will be feeding us for 2 days.  Will make this again.

Made this the first time "exactly"  using "Sweet Baby Rays" Sweet & Spicy BBQ Sauce w/ Calif. Slaw.  It was very good  HOWEVER the  Second time I added 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp salt. :) Much better, sweet with a very nice spice kick at the end of each bite. We also made Apple Slaw (using vidalia sweet onion instead of green onions).  You can find both slaw recipes  on this site also.  WOW NOW we have a Unique Family and Party Dish At potlucks this crock pot is wiped out..... FAST.

Easiest pulled pork recipe ever. I added seasoning because I like mine a little spicier (garlic powder and cajun seasoning (i.e., Tony Chacheres), cooked it all night on low in the crock pot, and used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbeque sauce... My new favorite pulled recipe. Thank you for a great recipe. (I did use a pork loin roast, and it was perfect).

They had pork loin and root beer on sale at my local store so I figured what the heck and tried this out.  Had to adjust a little cause I got a 4 lb loin but I just covered the loin with root beer in the cooker and doubled the other ingredients.  It turned out wonderful!  The meat cooked up very tender and very flavorful.  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, and I recommend it to others as well.

This recipe is not that different from any pulled pork recipe that you can find anywhere else, but yet it has the root beer as ingredient that makes it more interesting. I have seen that some peole add apple cider or any other liquid but I found that the root beer gives it a special touch. When you have that root beer taste combine with the porks fat and the BBQ sauce you have a good sauce to marinate you pork to not be dry. You should try this recipe.

Cooked it just as instructed just added a little seasoning at the end. Used Jack Daniels Original BBQ Sauce. ..... OMG!!! It's so good. I'm on a Paleo diet. I'm altering a strict diet with the use of Soda and Store bought BBQ sauce, but so what! It's bliss. No bread. Served with Sweet potatoes and roasted kale. #highlyrecommended

This was really amazing. My first time cooking pulled pork. At first seeing one of the recipes was root beer made me second think but as i read reviews from others i was excited to try this. I used a tip from another reviewer and rubbed black pepper and kosher salt before putting it in the slow cooker. used pork shoulder and filled the crock pot until the meat was covered. cooked for about 6-7 hours until the meat started to fall apart and i used rays honey and brown sugar to coat the pork. i let the pork sit for another hour to soak up the flavor of the bbq sauce. but definately amazing!

We really like this as well.  We added large pieces of onion on the bottom on the crock pot (large so we can pick them out before adding BBQ), salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the meet. Make a huge batch and freeze leftovers for quick dinners.

This was delicious, my son had 2 sandwiches eaten before I even sat down. I used pork shoulder as suggested by another reviewer, bcse for some reason anytime I use tenderloin it is very dry. This wil be put into the dinner rotation for sure! Thanks for sharing :)

This was so delicious! I used a different cut and forgot about it for 6 hrs. When I got back to check it, it was so tender that I could barely take it out of the crockpot. Left it for another hour covered in bbq sauce like instructed, and served it with black eyed peas and baked potato wedges. My husband couldn't stop raving about how good it is!! Will def make it again. Yum, easy and cheap! Thank you!

My family loved it.  I used a 4lbs boneless pork butt and a 16.9 oz bottle of root beer.  Cooked on low 6 or 7 hours and it was falling apart.  I imagine using real brown sugar, garlic, and other ingredients would deliver a more complex flavor.  But this recipe was a great inspiration and is in my recipe box.  Thanks to other comment authors for additional guidance.

Soooo i added to the recipe a little! First i rubbed the tenderloin with sage,onion powder, garlic powder, coriander,cayenne pepper, paprika salt and pepper. Drizzled with olive oil and refrigerated overnight. The next day i browned the pork in my cast iron skillet on all sides then placed in crockpot with 1 yellow onion sliced and 1 tbl spoon minced garlic. Poured in the root beer and cooked on low for 61/2-7hrs!

First time attempting pulled pork. Did a 3lb pork shoulder with two 12oz bottles of kroger root beer. Cooked on low for 10 hours & it was just falling apart.  Drained & added bbq sauce. was a little too mushy for me but husband and brother absolutely loved it, said I had the local bbq spot beat haha.

I used a 2# boneless pork roast. Put it in the slow cooker, added 1 can of root beer, approximately two tablespoons of dehydrated onion and just 1/2 cup of bbq sauce. Cooked for about 8 hours. Added a bit mre bbq sauce after shredding the meat apart. Served over mashed potatoes- didn't feel like having bread! Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Had this recipe stored for a while and finally decided to give it a try. Like other reviewers, I added some seasoning to the pork before throwing it in my crockpot. I added ground pepper and garlic salt. This came out amazing! Although I will probably add more BBQ sauce on the next round. Great recipe!

Yes, it is soooo good! One of the best barbecue recipes I have ever found. Love the root beer. I always like root beer floats with barbecue sandwiches but I never thought about cooking it in the root beer. Super good.

I loved the ease of preparation. I didn't have root beer on hand so I substituted with Dr. Pepper. I don't think it made a difference because the result was delicious. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and seasoned the pork first with garlic powder, salt and pepper. This is as good as the best I've had in the past.

I tried this because I had to work late, had (diet) root beer, bbq sauce, and a pork loin.  I had a 4 lb pork loin, so doubled the root beer, but only one bottle of bbq sauce, so had my daughter only use that one after it cooked about 6 hours.  IT WAS SO GOOD!  My family usually doesn't like bbq anything, and they LOVED this!  Will make it over and over.. thanks so much!

Very tasty, tender and so easy to prepare. I cooked the tenderloin for 5 1/2 hours, drained the root beer then added the BBQ sauce and cooked an additional 1 1/2 hours. Was a big hit with family and friends. You can spice it up by using the different flavors of sauce available

I made this once before, and the first time it was nothing to write home about. Too sweet & a bit boring. Deserving 3 stars, at best.

This time around, I added 1 chicken bouillon cube, 4 cloves of minced garlic & 1 onion. Normally I prefer a sweet and tangy bbq sauce, but since the root beer is sweet, I used a basic hickory sauce. I added it about halfway through. 
Method #2 wins all 5 stars! (So I averaged the two results) :)

Thought I'd try somehing different than usual, but I didn't care for the root beer flavor.  I will go back to my simple slow cooker recipe that uses pork shoulder (butt is the same thing), water filled enough to cover the meat, a tablespoon of worchestershire, and a diced onion on top.  Cook on low for 8 hours, shred, put back in crock pot and add 1 bottle of favorite bbq sauce.

We made this last week, and my family loved it! I used the pork tenderloin, and it was amazing! The meat fell apart on its own, and it was full of flavor. I did rub it with salt, pepper and garlic salt before pouring the root beer over it. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I'm making it again tomorrow for a party. It will be a keeper.

Like others, I used a pork shoulder instead of a tenderloin - more bang for your buck!  It was incredible.  So easy.  I rubbed the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder and then covered it in root beer.  Set it on low for 8 hours flipping it part way through, and it came out amazing.  My only "complaint" was that it was hard to drain because it was so easily falling apart!!!  Not a bad complaint to have.  I mixed it with Pork Butt BBQ sauce and let it sit on warm while I put my baby to bed.  I will absolutely be making this again!

I made this EXACTLY as was stated in the recipe, pork tenderloin and all, and it was literally AMAZING!!! So amazing in fact, that my husband had FOUR of these pulled pork sandwiches! The ONLY thing I might do differently next time is add more root beer so that it completely covers the meat. Since I only used one 12 oz. bottle of root beer, it didn't even come close to covering the meat, so I felt like I had to constantly flip it to keep it from drying out. Otherwise, everything is PERFECT with this recipe!

This pork was DELICIOUS. I only made a few small tweaks to the recipe. Instead of tenderloin, I bought a 3 pound cut of Boston butt. I used diet root beer instead of regular for calorie's sake, and honestly, I could have used two bottles instead of one. The whole pork was extremely moist, besides the top that stuck out of the root beer bath. After 6 hours of cooking on low, I drained off the root beer and poured a whole bottle of Sticky Fingers Carolina Sweet Barbecue sauce over it. After one more hour of cooking on low, the meat practically fell off the bone! It was so moist and flavor-packed. I can't wait to make this recipe again... 5 thumbs up!!!

I was looking for a BBQ pulled pork recipe to put on top of nachos, and came across this one. I used a pork shoulder instead of a tenderloin, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was absolutely delicious, but I'm not convinced that the root beer actually did anything for the recipe. I couldn't taste it (probably a good thing) - I could only taste the BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce). 

That being said, I love how easy it was to make this and this BBQ pulled pork on nachos with black beans, onions, tomatoes and cheese is a must try.

I made this exactly as directed except I used a 4 lb pork shoulder (more bang for your buck).  It was delicious.  I will make this again and again.

Make this all the time for my family that loves it ! The root beer makes all the difference! Sweet and spicy-- I make this in the crock pot and leave a good 10+ hours so It falls to pieces and is easy to shred. Serve with a pile of coleslaw on top = yum

Wasn't the most amazing pulled pork ever, but it was good. I did a spice rub on the pork first, though, and next time, I'll sear the meat before putting it into the crock pot.

Went with the tenderloin route, as we like the leaner cuts in our house.  We added our normal meat seasonings (Mrs. Dash garlic and herb, lawny's season salt) before pouring the root beer (A&W) in.  Also, we went with 2 bottles of root beer to cover the tenderloin entirely. It was really good, and it got my husband's seal of approval to make again.

Great but reduce the liquid and add smoked paprika and chili powder. Add two tablespoons of vinegar and salt. No need for BBQ sauce.

I used 3 lbs pork shoulder.  I was afraid it would be too sweet so added a large chunked up onion which I discarded with the cooking liquid.  Instead of my usual Sweet Baby Ray's I used a locally produced mild smokey BBQ sauce.  32 oz was perfect for this amount of pork.  Served with the KFC coleslaw knockoff found on this site.  Going to serve both at our after Christmas dinner party.

This was the first time I've ever made pulled pork and this was certainly an easy recipe to follow. I also used pork butt instead of pork loin and used enough A&W root beer to cover the meat. I followed advice and cooked on low for 6 hours. Took it out of the cooker, shredded the meat, which was easy to do, and then mixed it in with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Placed it back in the slow cooker and refridgerated overnight. Put it on simmer for about an hour or so before dinner. The recipe gets three stars for ease but the flavor comes from the BBQ sauce so be sure to find a sauce that you like (I personally love Sweet Baby Rays). That being said, I will most definitely be using this recipe again. It's already on the menu for the superbowl.

Loved this! Really easy and basically ready for me when I get home from work. I use Diana's Maple BBQ sauce and I love it. While you can put the pulled pork on a bun, I also like serving it on rice.

Love this recipe! Super easy and very tasty. I took some advice from the previous reviews and put a pepper, kosher salt, crushed chili pepper and garlic rub. Also used pork shoulder instead of pork loin. I will definitely make this again!

We found this recipe on here in 2011 and have made it dozens of times since then.  It's great for a family meal - I usually freeze half after I shred it (before adding BBQ sauce) to heat up a couple of weeks later.  This has also been a hit at many picnics and corporate food days.  Easy enough for the kids to make too!

I've made this recipe a few times and everybody loves it...so easy and tasty. I rub some salt, pepper, chopped garlic and onion powder on the pork before I pour over the root beer. I let it cook on low for about 8 hours, drain off the root beer and shred the pork, before placing it back in the slow cooker with a few bottles of BBQ sauce on low for about an hour.

I love this recipe! I used a pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin and it turned out amazing. Used A & W root beer, which I was skeptical about, but it turned out juicy and tender. Finally I used Stubbs Hot BBQ sauce and a little sweet baby rays because my family enjoys a spicy taste to their BBQ, not just sweet. I also recommend adding coleslaw to the sandwich it made it that much better.

Amazing! I do have to confess I did brine my Boston butt which was what I had on hand, but other wise I cooked it by the recipe. This was for a church dinner and only one sandwich came home. That was because my mother just had to have a little for home. My Boston butt had a bone-in, and cooking it this way it slid out clean. Best pulled pork!

Loved this! Super simple. A couple of hours before it was finished I added sliced onions. One half hour before finishing I drained the liquid, shredded the pork with a fork and stirred in the BBQ sauce (Chipotle Maple Bacon flavor) and let it continue to simmer on low. So yummy, everyone loved it! Keeping this recipe as a go to!

Tried it, loved it. Took the advice of others and rubbed my fav garlic herb and spicy pepper melody into the roast prior to cooking. Served on garlic toasted ciabatta buns with coleslaw.  Instant family favorite!

Ok, I am a Texas girl now living in California.  I LOVE BBQ and pulled pork is my favorite.

Fantastic! I will say all the flavor comes from the bbq sauce you use so make it a good one.

Simply Easy! Amazing taste.  Rubbed salt, pepper and garlic powder on pork.  Used boneless pork shoulder. Cheaper than tenderloin  About $2.50 per lb.  Cut the pork into 3 large pieces and sear the pork in my dutch oven.  Added a can of root beer and slow cook on stove top for about 3 hours or until meat is tender. Didn't pour any liquid out.  It evaporated.   Did not use a whole bottle of sweet baby ray bbq sauce. but  Just enough for my liking.  Served it on hamburger buns and over rice.  Will definitely make again!

Amazing! Was skeptical about the rootbeer...I used dads rootbeer brand a 1 liter bottle, I actually ended up falling asleep so it cooked for 10 hours instead of 7 and was soooo tender and juicy.. I definitely think I put too much root beer in but it was amazing!! Thanks!

I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Used the pork butt as others suggested.  So much flavor, felt like I was at a BBQ restaurant for a lot less money.  Even better the second night!

Have made this once before, but used a larger pork loin, & it was really easy & good.  Am cooking it again ( 6 lb pork loin).  This time I seasoned the loin with a couple of kinds of seasoning salt & will cover it with root beer to cook.  Will use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce for the end product.  I always use a crockpot liner bag regardless of what I'm cooking so clean-up isn't a problem.  I'm freezing this batch for a family reunion on the 4th of July.  I anticipate this batch will also be a hit with the family!

It tasted like boiled meat. It was very tender but no flavor.  The BBQ sauce add the only flavor.  I will never make this again.

Very easy to make and tastes great. I like pulled pork but not BBQ sauce and the flavor of the pork with the root beer was perfect.  I added the BBQ on the side for my husband.  I used King's Hawaiian sweet hamburger buns and it complemented the meat well.

This never lasts long at my house.  My kids love it, and with homemade buns it makes this recipe awesome.  I have made this a couple of times, and I will sometimes add a liquid smoke spay (couple of squirts) and a couple of teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce.  I also like to find a charcoal BBQ sauce, it gives it more of a grilled taste which enhances the BBQ experience.  I have tried Pepsi and Coke slow cookers and they are not as good as root beer.  Also what makes this so great is it can be cooked in the garage on hot days and not warm up my house!

This is an awesome recipe!  I don't really change anything.  I do use a picnic roast instead of a tenderloin.  I cook on low for about six or seven hours then drain the liquid, shred and put it back in on "keep warm" for another hour with the BBQ sauce.  You can taste the root beer a little, but it ends up being good anyway.  It's a sure fire way to get great pulled pork!

I sprinkled brown sugar over the pork before pouring the root beer and it made it a little tangy. Used Sweet Baby Raes BBQ sauce, honey flavor because I like sweet! It turned out awesome!

Excellent! Used 10lb pork shoulder (bone in), cooked overnight on low in slow cooker with 2L root beer. Flipped in the morning and cooked for 4 more hours on low. Removed bones and fat and added ~60oz Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce. Simmered 1 hr.

This is good and easy, but taste much better with Dr. Pepper instead of Root Beer. I just did this for my second time the exact same way, but with Dr. Pepper and the results were much better.

Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe! I'm giving it a 4 because I loved it, but my hubby said it was good but a little too sweet. I agree, and think that's maybe a function of the BBQ sauce we used + the root beer. ( I tasted it before the BBQ and it was kinda sweet.) We used Sweet Baby Ray's, and we did drain all the root beer. When I say too sweet, I mean just a little. I do think the flavor mostly comes from the sauce and I am pretty inexperienced in BBQ. My husband suggested Stubbs BBQ sauce next time, so we will try is again for sure!

I am not a big pulled pork lover, but my family really liked it. I had to add another bottle of sauce though because I let it set for awhile and it dried out.

It was edible, but it didn't taste any better than when I used water or chicken broth and the slight flavor and scent of root beer was just weird - even after I had added bbq sauce.

As is, recipe is only a 3. (I have used a plain pork tenderloin before to "save" a recipe, and discovered it was not easy to shred nor as tasty as a shoulder. So I used a ~2.6 lb pork tenderloin roast, which had more fat). After following other suggestions with letting it sit in crock pot on 'keep warm' setting for an additional hour, which ended up being 1½ since had errands to run,  it raised review a point. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce which is my favorite- but that still was inadequate. Once I added approximately 1 to 1½ tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar, it finally had that special punch to it, and became a 5.

I really wanted this to be great because it was SO easy, but it was disappointing.  The root beer really didn't give the pork any flavor at all.  I've had much better results with a rub or marinade.  I guess if you pour enough BBQ sauce, salt, hot sauce, cole slaw, etc etc on any pork roast it can be good, but didn't think this was a great base recipe in itself.

THIS WAS AMAZING!! I BOUGHT A CASE OF A&W ROOT BEER AND POURED TWO 12 OUNCE CANS OVER THE PORK. I BOUGHT PORK TENDERLOINS FROM WALMART. IT WAS A LITTLE OVER 3 POUNDS TOGETHER (CAME IN A PACKAGE OF TWO). I WAS LATE GETTING HOME, SO THE PORK WAS ACTUALLY ON LOW FOR 10 HOURS!!! I DID COME HOME FROM RUNNING ERRANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AT WHICH POINT I TURNED THE PORK OVER AND POURED JUICES ON IT. I CUT UP A LARGE WHITE ONION IN SMALL PIECES AND POURED IT INTO THE CROCKPOT IN THE MORNING WHEN I PUT THE PORK IN THE CROCKPOT. THE WHITE ONION WAS SWEET AND DELICIOUS WITH THE PORK.

The Root beer does amazing things with this pulled pork! We couldn't get enough it was delicious! I used Diana's Chicken & Rib bbq sauce because that was all I had on hand. We served it on bakery fresh buns and topped with coleslaw. It will defiantly be a regular on the menu at my house.

AWESOME...EASY...what else is there to say?  I always use a larger pork tenderloin and just add more root beer.  This can feed a big crowd for cheap (when it's on sale for $1.99 per lb).  It makes the meat so tender and yummy, you could skip the BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely easy. Root beer adds nothing to the flavor. Pork tenderloin does not have enough fat to add that luscious flavor. Primary flavor came from the barbeque sauce. Edible barely. Overall disappointment.

I just made this today and it was great!!  I used Pork shoulder like several other reviewers suggested, but otherwise I did this exactly as written!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce, but I'm sure any BBQ sauce would have worked just fine. It was super tasty!  My husband and I loved it, and we're excited for leftovers tomorrow. We'll be making it again for sure!

Heads down the best BBQ I've ever had! I used a 2 lb pork tenderloin, $7 & Garland Jack's Secret Six Original Recipe BBQ sauce! It was in the crockpot w/ the root beer for bout 9 hrs on low! I loved it! It reminded me of Memphis, TN BBQ!!

Dr. Pepper works really well also! Hickory or mesquite barbecue would be a perfect compliment, and I agree that a cheaper cut of pork, like the shoulder, tastes just as good, and shreds easily if cooked slowly in the pop (soda).

Since there were so many wonderful reviews I decided to try this recipe but I have to say I didn't like it. I didn't like the underlying root beer flavor unfortunately. The BBQ sauce didn't mask it and the combination of flavors kinda made me want to give it to my dog (if I had one). Sorry! I was really hoping.

Just a thought...I make a very similar recipe with cola instead of root her with a few extra tweaks. I see a lot of posts about using a cheaper cut, totally agree, however tonight a tenderloin was what I had thawed and pulled pork sounded yummy. So, for a little added flavor try dicing up a few slices of bacon and about half an onion(depending on amount of meat,mine was 2 pounds) and lightly brown together. They do not have to be fully cooked as they will continue in the crockpot. Just a quick tip for extra flavor, mine always comes out awesome and full of flavor!

I agree, tenderloin, though healthier is not necessary when you are cooking it it root beer and covering it with BBQ sauce. Butt or shoulder works just as well. I also use dr. Pepper too, which works just as well. I also season with salt and pepper first. When I drain it, we keep all the onions to eat, they are so good mixed in as well. I prefer making homemade BBQ sauce, but sweet baby rays works well in a pinch

Made this last night for a potluck. I'm so happy to have found a way to make pulled pork so easily at home. Since I was making a lot, I used my giant crockpot and used one shoulder and two tenderloins. Both cuts tasted good, but the shoulder meat was much juicier than the tenderloin. There wasn't a hint of root beer taste. I will make this again, thanks!

This was a great and simple slow cooker pork recipe! Great for football Sunday when you want to spend time enjoying the game and not slaving away in the kitchen... I doubled the recipe and did add some BBQ sauce with the root beer , but that was it! Huge success!

This recipe was soooo yummy!  I rubbed garlic power into the meat and then put that in the slow cooker with the root beer, then I added a layer of onions and barbQ sauce over the top of the meat, and spread it all over the meat/onions with some salt, pepper and white pepper! Before I turned it all on i poked holes in the meat to let the juices sink in!!! Then I served with BarbQ sauce in a bun!! It was so tasty and my family really loved it!!

This was so tasty!  I added a few things based on other reviews...minced onions, salt and pepper rubbed onto both sides of pork, and then turned over about half way thru, approx 3 hours in as I let it go for 6.  I drained it well but made sure to keep any of the yummy bits that had come off.  I also added some honey to the BBQ sauce I used, which is Sweet Baby Ray's Original, along with a little garlic powder.  Now, if I were making this for myself, I would have added Raspberry Jalapeno jelly for a little kick.

This is a great recipe and it's so simple.  I only used 1.5 cups of root beer, as per the recipe, and I couldn't taste it at all in the finished product.  I would have noticed because I HATE root beer!  The only thing I'd change for next time would be the barbeque sauce.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's brown sugar and hickory sauce and it was way too sweet for my taste.

This was surprisingly good! I used a tenderloin and A&W root beer. Mixed in about 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce into the root beer. Cooked for 7 hours and it was very easy to pull apart. Covered with Sweet Baby Ray's and served on a nice kaiser roll. The family loved it!

Made this afternoon for lunch.   It was a hit!   2 minutes to prep...most of that was dragging out my crockpot as it does not have a permanent home on my counter.  Thanks for such a simple and delicious recipe!  I will certainly make this again!

Delicious.  The pork stays tender and juicy.  I made this with Dr Pepper on my second run and like it a little better but ONLY becuase you can still taste the undertones of the rootbeer and I don't particularly care for the flavor of rootbeer.

I got a big chunk of pork shoulder since it's a bit cheaper, used about 4 lbs, one bottle of rootbeer and some Sweet Baby Ray's (I forget which variety and I'm not at home now to check). 
We made this to have for a game night with friends and everyone loved it & were so surprised at how easy it was!!

Omg! The easiest pulled pork ever! My family really likes it, and my cousin's husband even got her to buy a slow cooker after eating the pulled pork at my house! I personally, think that it's very sweet, but I guess that's how pulled pork is supposed to be?

Yummy, but a little sweet for the hubby.  I changed it up by decreasing the RB to 1-1/4 cup and adding a 1/4 c apple cider vinegar.
Turned the meat halfway through, salted, lightly covered with white pepper and added 1/2 tsp. whole black peppercorns.  
Used Sticky Fingers Memphis style as the mix in and "Kermit's key lime chipotle" as a condiment-sliced sweet onions and potato rolls.

Sweet with a kick!

Surprisingly good! I can always appreciate a good meal that doesn't require a lot of time or work and this is definitely one. I took someone else's suggestion and seasoned the meat. As well I took the suggestion of pouring off the root beer when close to done, shredding the pork and placing it back in the slow cooker and covering it with the bar-b-q sauce to cook awhile longer. It worked out perfectly.

Excellent and very tasty!  I covered the entire tenderloin in root beer and put in slow cooker. After I drained the root beer and pulled the pork apart, I put back into the slow cooker with Honey BBQ sauce until it was hot, and served. The great reviews from family and friends were all day long!  Delicious!  TIP:  If you buy a whole pork tenderloin and cut into 3 roasts, seriously you will pay a total of about  $7.00-$10.00 more for the entire full tenderloin, then one small pork tenderloin. Trim fat, store other roasts in freezer for future use.

I used to eat pulled pork until I refrigerated the leftovers and saw all the fat congealed throughout.   Then I came across this recipe, and although I was concerned it would be lacking in flavor, decided to give it a try.  AMAZING! So simple, delicious, and so much healthier than my old recipe that used a fattier cut of pork.  I didn't make any changes (nothing to change, really).  My kids, who in the past, didn't like pulled pork, loved it!  I used Sticky Fingers Smokehouse Memphis bar-b-que sauce.  My one recommendation is to get a sauce you know you like.  Since its a big part of the flavor, don't skimp on the sauce!  I will definitely recommend this to my friends!!!

This was great. I used a small pork sirloin. I was able to get it in a sealed package with some seasoning on it. It was just the right amount and worke dwell for me and it was only around $6.00 for 2 lbs. I didn't use as much barbecue sauce but kept it on the table in case guests would like more. I used about 1/4 cup. I'll keep this recipe. It is easy and good.

Great recipe. I've made this 4 times now and like to buy 2 of the 1.5 pound Hormel mesquite pork tenderloins. I prefer leaner cuts of meat and it shreds in less than a minutes. I cook for about 5 hours, shred, add sauce and let sit on warm for up to another hour. Super easy.

Great recipe.  I followed it as instructed and used some bottled BBQ sauce that my husband and I love.  We ate on it for about half a week until it was gone.  Good stuff.

OK, so the first time I tried this recipe was with pork tenderloin and it was awesome. Today, I tried it with pork shoulder as many people have suggested. Personally, I didn't like it. It was way too fatty for me. I will stick with the pork tenderloin!

Super easy pulled pork and delicious!  No need to change the original  recipe except that I seasoned the pork and made sure the root beer covered the entire loin.

Have made this more than once and everyone raves about this and ask what the secret is. When I say rootbeer, everyone's jaw hits the floor! I usually use the cheapest cut possible and never go wrong. Best pulled pork recipe ever!

After reading all of the reviews for this recipe, I also decided to use a pork butt.  IT WAS AWESOME!! I thought it was fantastic, and my boyfriend said he "was kind of in love with it".  This was my first pulled pork recipe and also my first use of a slow cooker.  I had a 4lb. butt, used Jones root beer, and put 1 onion on the bottom, set it to 8 hours& that was it!! When it was ready, I drained it skimmed the fat out, added some of the juice back in, and topped it with the "Absolutely Awesome BBQ Sauce" also from AR.  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I have made this several times using a boneless pork shoulder roast. Our favorite sauce is Sweet Baby Ray's, and it comes out absolutely delicious each and every time. Put some sweet slaw on top, and you've got a fantastic pulled pork sandwich. This is an easy and great recipe. Thank you for submitting it!!

This was so good! The only reason i didn't give it a 5 star was cause i changed the cut of the meat, used a cheap cut, but other then that it was a hit!! i had a bottle of maple smoked bbq sauce, i used that.. it was so sweet, and as for people who said it tasted like rootbeer...i didn't get that at all, it just added something i cant really describe! i will be using this one again!!!

I have made this recipe on a few occasions and I believe you guys have found the secret to the best pulled pork ever by cooking it root beer. I find the only thing I can do to make it better is by topping it with some good ole' coleslaw. Everyone I have ever made this for has agreed with me. It is indeed some of the best pulled pork they have ever had.

So good and so easy. I am making this for the second time; it's in the slow cooker now.  My tenderloin is a little over 4 lbs so I added extra Root Beer. I make a large batch so that I can freeze quart bags of left overs for lunchs later in the month.

Fantastic pulled pork! I cooked pork butt (no need for the more expensive cuts, as others have mentioned) on low for seven hours with the root beer (I seasoned with a little garlic plus salt and pepper before putting in crockpot), then drained and shredded the pork, and put back into the crockpot with Famous Dave's BBQ sauce (more than the recipe calls for) AND a little more root beer. I let that cook for another hour or so and served on pretzel rolls. With a couple sides, this served 10 people.

Oh my gosh this is so good!!  I needed to bring a meal for a ladies weekend retreat and thought this sounded like some they they would all like. I put it in the crockpot last night and woke up to a wonderful smelling house. It was so moist and pulled apart so easily. I tasted it before adding the BBQ (used Sweet Baby Rays) sauce and you couldn't even taste the root beer at all. I used a pork butt for this and just removed the fat before shredding the meat. Very economical and makes a lot!!!  I'm serving it with slider buns.

By far the best slow cooker pulled pork we've made to date.  I used a 3 lb pork roast with a 12 oz can of Hansens natural root beer and cooked it on low for about 8 hours then shredded it and added Kraft hickory smoke bbq sauce to it (~ 1.5 bottles).  The meat was considerably more moist than it's been in the past.

As others have done, I used a 7lb pork shoulder, removed some of the fat and the skin which was still intact.  I used two bottles of beer to mostly cover the meat.  After 8 hours in the crockpot, on low, the meat fell off the bone and smelled wonderful.  I drained the liquid, shredded the meat, and applied Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (almost a whole bottle).  The meat remained in the crockpot for a few hours (accidentally while we visited with our guests).  When we finally ate, it was perfect, and very easy clean up!

Easy, easy, easy!  I love pulled pork but have never actually made it.  I've been craving it and saw this recipe and gave it a try.  My kids, husband and I all loved it.  We had it with watermelon and corn on the cob served on soft wheat buns.

Family loved this!  I rubbed spices on:  garlic & onion powder, pepper, salt, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes.  filled with root beer and turned it on low and went to bed.  The next morining I shredded, discarded most of the juice and added the BBQ sauce.  So good!  It just melted in your mouth!

LOVED THIS!  Poked wholes in the tenderloin before cooking and added liquid smoke to the root beer in the crock pot.  I've made this about 4 times in less than a month using different bottled BBQ sauces and 1/2 cup cider vinegar. 
Served it on buns with coleslaw!  My family loved this and I'll keep it in my recipe collection!

So simple! This recipe is delicious as it is, but can easily be tweaked to your taste buds. If you don't like the taste of root beer, try using Pepsi or Dr. Pepper instead; just make sure not to use the diet version. If you are looking for more flavor, add BBQ sauce as a condiment to your sandwich, or try adding in minced onions, minced garlic, oregano, basil or even salt and pepper as it cooks.

Very easy.  We used this recipe for a 5 year old birthday party bash.  We had lots of kids and parents too!  It was a hit for both.  The kids wanted more and the parents wanted the recipe.  I had two -pots full and there was no left-overs.  The parents were amazed about how little ingredients were used.  They all thought it was a lot more involved than it actually was.  A BIG HIT!  One note:  You do not have to use Root Beer, you can use coke/pepsi too.  Just do not use a diet version.

Delicious! I was a little late deciding on dinner, so I had to use the pressure cooker...turned out great! Fork tender in about an hour. It also eliminated the off-smell some reviewers complained of.

My dad doesn't do pulled pork and he actually requests this (he does love root beer). I'm using A&W this time around, but when I'm splurging (or making a Trader Joe's trip) it's sugar cane soda all the way. The only thing you can mess up with this recipe is the sauce. Serve with (not too) sweet, tangy coleslaw. Use the shoulder (save the loin for something outside a bun).

First I must say it is oh so very simple and delish! I agree with  reviews saying that pork loin is not the best choice. Butt or shoulder is great. I have made this recipe several times (10-15!) as my large family loves pulled pork sandwiches. A few drops of liquid smoke added to a full liter of rootbeer gives us our favorite flavor. (If you use liquid smoke, be careful not to over do it. You do not need very much! ) Changing the BBQ sauce can give you a slightly different flavor each time. We love heat in our family so homemade spicy sauce is our preference although this recipe still is wonderful even with your bargain BBQ sauce. Yummy yummy yummy. Enjoy!

This was shockingly (to me) good.  I had mediocre, at best, expectations.  But it was something simple, with limited ingredients that seemed like it would fill up a crowd.  

It came out delicious and was probably the most tender meat I've ever cooked.

One suggested modification - I just can't wrap my brain around buying a top cut of meat (tenderloin) and then killing it in the crockpot for 7-8 hours.  So I used a pork shoulder and it was wonderful, as well as inexpensive.  

I'm a recipe "tweaker" for sure, and I can't recommend one other modification to this three ingredient recipe.

We liked this easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use a 20oz bottle of root beer. I barely tasted any root beer. And it smelled good while cooking. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it really could have used more BBQ sauce.

A simple recipe that works. This goes from good to great with the best quality rolls you can bake or buy. In my case I bought some really good bakery fresh rolls. Used sweet baby ray's.

I'm not much of a BBQ eater really but this is really good. It makes it very tender and we ate on it for days:) My son even liked it and he can be picky with food..I will most certainly eat this again!!I thought putting rootbeer in it was sorta weird but I like to try different things..I'm glad I did.I also tried it with coleslaw on top and that made it even more yummy!!!

OK - so I'll admit that the pork (I used a tenderloin) was as tender as could be, but all I could taste was root beer.  Also, a reviewer said she won a contest using "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ so I went out and bought that and it was way too sweet.  I will try again cooking in coke or beef broth (NOT ROOT BEER) and I will either make my own BBQ sauce or use a different brand.

Okay...hmm. Made this exactly as written.  Ended up with meat that was so mushy, it was almost off-putting.  I now see why several other reviewers said that pork loin is not the ideal meat for a slow-cooked pulled pork recipes. I wish I had used a tougher cut of meat.  The flavor was good, it was just the texture..no substance to it at all.  So, a good recipe, but avoid the tenderloin, use something tougher so you don't feel like you are eating bbq pork flavored mashed potatoes!

Would not have believed it if I had not gambled on an $11.00 Piece of Pork Tenderloin.  Absolutly Un real.  It looked just like the picture. What I, as a southern cook of 60 years, Always strive for.  My neighbor ate both sandwiches I took him and his wife got none.

Best Part is just 3 ingredents. Took Exactly 7 hours on slow in my new hum dinger of a Crock pot.  Done at 2AM. YUM YUM  Used An Hawaiian BQue Sauce which sold on the internet for $34.00 a bottle.
Can't fine it now to buy, however mine came from Walmart on a close out for $.99 cents.  YEA ME SUPER SHOPPER

Very good and so easy to make....  I think what makes or breaks this recipe is the brand/quality of BBQ sauce you use at the end. If you use a low quality no name sauce it will affect to taste. I recommend using a good quality store bought or even better, a homemade BBQ sauce. In my case, I used Diana's Gourmet sauce (available in Canada) and MUG Root beer.

Prep time was fast and was easy to do! I used a 3.5 lb pork shoulder and 2 20oz bottles of A&WRoot Beer. Slow cooker was on low for 7 hrs. When done I used a  half of a bottle of Famous Dave's Devil Spit BBQ sauce and mixed it with half a bottle of Famous Dave's Zesty sweet BBQ suace!The flavor is awesome! You have the taste of sweet and bit of heat from the Devil spit!Try it! You will love it!

My wife and I just love this recipe! It's SUPER easy and you can really taste the soda in the meat even after you slather on the BBQ sauce. I've tampered with the recipe a few times and I have a great redo. I use Dr. Pepper instead of Root Beer from time to time just to make it different since we have it so much. I also use almost an entire two liter instead of just one can so that the pork is completely submerged. It keeps it really moist and adds a lot of the soda flavor, but not so much that it's overbearing. I also add some Celery Seed and Mustard Seed into the BBQ sauce and after I've shredded the pork, I mix it all together and put it back in the slow cooker for another 30-60 minutes.

I cannot recommend this recipe.  In place of an expensive pork tenderloin I used a pork butt - on the recommendation of many posters.  Don't know if that was the problem, but my husband nor I cared for it.  In fairness, I may try it again with a tenderloin.  Except for using the pork butt, I did not change the recipe.

It truly is great.  Made it as written only used a pork roast instead of the tenderloin.  I trimmed off the fat first.  Used Sweet Baby Rays sauce and cooked on high 4 hours.  So good.

We loved this recipe. We used cheaper cuts of pork as other reviewers did. Put it in the slow cooker overnight and then just heated it the next evening when our guests arrived. We made Big Daddy's BBQ sauce which was mustard based and a nice, tangy contrast to the sweet pork.

So easy and delicious! Leftovers today were great as well.

I chose this recipe because of the health factor - tenderloin is lower in fat than the typical selections for pulled pork. It was a great choice and the recipe is definitely a keeper! 

I followed the directions (except the rolls) verbatim and used Bulls Eye BBQ sauce, as it is a bit sweeter than some other sauces, and served it on whole grain pita bread. It was a big hit for everyone, for sure. 

Next time, as there will be a next time soon, I think I will probably add some chopped onion, garlic and jalapeno in the mix and, possibly, another 4 ounces of BBQ, as I really like it dripping. 

A couple people mentioned that a tenderloin is harder to 'pull', but I found it worked very well. I had it shredded in a matter of minutes without much effort at all...

Loved this! I didn't use tenderloin, I used chops that were on sale and it still turned out amazing. I love that you can use the cheapest cut and still get a really good meal. My friend who doesn't even like pork ate three sandwiches! This will be a regular for weekday meals from now on.

Have fixed this twice now.  1st Time:  Exactly to recipe using 1/2 Williams BBQ Sauce (from Atlanta) and 1/2 Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce...Result? Liked it!  2nd Time:  I took several of the other viewers advice using Boston Butt, salt & pepper, garlic, etc. forking meat before adding the root beer.  The meat was moist but it took longer to shred to get rid of the extra fat that was on the boston butt compared to a drier meat from the tenderloin.  Also the liquid didn't smell so good with all those extra flavors mixed in with the root beer....though the flavor of the meat itself was fine.  This time I made a mixture of 1/2 Sticky Fingers, 1/2 Bone Lickin' Sauces, some yellow mustard and a dash or so of liquid smoke and used this for the BBQ Sauce.  Result?  Still liked it!  So my take on this recipe is that no matter what you do to the meat/root beer mixture, it's all in the BBQ Sauce that you use that will determine the number of stars this recipe gets.  Find the right BBQ Sauce and you have a Winner!!  Thanks Livie's Mammy for an easy, tasty recipe.

I made this for the first time for my Superbowl party today and I was nervous since it was such a simple recipe. It turned out to be just as wonderful as everyone said! I had to use more that 12 oz of root beer, just to make sure that the pork was covered in the crock pot, but we had it on hand, so it wasn't an issue. Also, it was diet root beer, but it didn't hurt the flavor at all. The pork was tender and delicious and required so little work. Will definitely make this one again!

This was great! I used Honey BBQ sauce. I also cooked the pork and root beer all night in my crock pot. I felt it needed a little something after mixing it up, so added a few dashes of liquid smoke. Did the trick!

While the root beer was cooking it gave off a terrible stench.  I could hardly stand draining it off the meat.  I did go ahead and put in the BBQ sauce.  That night I could taste a little of the horrible smelling root beer.  But, the next day it tasted great.  The end result was really good, but I had such a terrible time with the root beer smelling marinating with the meat that I don't think I could make this again.

Ok, I liked this recipe but used Dr. Pepper instead of root beer, it gave it a lot more flavor and wasn't so "sweet." It definitely needs to be seasoned with garlic/onion/salt/pepper/etc. I also cooked it on high (I was in a hurry) for about 3 hours. I let it sit in the crock pot for an hour or so on warm shredded with the bbq sauce on it. This was amazing!

My family loved it!  I used a 7-lb pork shoulder roast and it came out perfect!  It was so tender the bones slid right out!  I shredded it after pouring off the root beer and added Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  This is recipe is a keeper. I'll be serving this moving forward at family picnics in the summer.

This was my first time making pulled pork sandwiches. This was also by far the best pulled sandwiches I have ever tried! I did make a few minor changes. Instead of a can of root-beer, I used a can of beef broth. I rubbed in spices as well into the pork before placing into the slow cooker such as fresh chopped garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. I let the pork cook on slow for 6.5 hours and then shredded it and added more spices including cayenne pepper and let that cook an extra hour. I also took the buns and added butter to the inside and cooked on the skillet on medium heat for a couple minutes until toasted. 

My boyfriend stuffed jalapeno peppers with cheddar cheese and bacon and cooked that in the oven for 15 minutes as a side. 

Over-all this made a great dinner!!!

This was really great.  I didn't use pork tenderloin - instead a cheaper cut and it was just fine.  I used the store brand root beer.  I sprinkled a little garlic powder and salt over the pork and poked several holes in the pork before cooking.  We used sweet baby rays Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.  It was just wonderful.  Cooked on low for 6 hrs, then drained, then added a bit of sauce (I did not overdo it with the sauce).  I then cooked for another hour in the crock pot.  So easy and so good.  I will use this recipe for the rest of my life.

Used this recipe today for pulled pork sandwiches only I used a 4 lb shoulder picnic pork roast. I was concerned that using just the root beer wouldn't give the meat much flavor, so I added a couple onion wedges, some BBQ rub, a bay leaf, and some smashed garlic cloves to the liquid in the slow cooker. The meat was tender and ready to shred after about 6 hours in the slow cooker, but I was disappointed with the flavor. It was actually rather bland until I added the BBQ sauce. I also added more BBQ rub, some worcestshire sauce and some liquid smoke to the shredded meat. My family thought it was good. I will probably use this recipe again, but may need to try other some other seasonings for cooking the meat.

This was yummy!  Not the best pulled pork EVER, but good enough that we enjoyed it.  We used Dominion root beer (it's made with honey), and sweet baby ray's sweet and spicy barbeque sauce.  I did season the pork before I cooked it, with seasoned salt and a fancy seasoning mix from penzey's spices.  Would make again!

I tweaked this recipe just a little bit, and it came out AMAZING! I followed everything accordingly, as far as quantities goes with the root beer, BBQ sauce and tenderloin, however, I cut up the tenderloin into 3/4 inch chops, pierced them with a fork, enabling the juices to get soaked up; then seasoned chops with kosher salt, cracked pepper and a little bit of garlic powder. I then let it slow cook in the crock pot for 5 & 1/5 hours, drained the crock pot, set the chops out to cool for a few moments and pulled them apart (don't be discouraged, they appear to be a little tough at first). Once most of them are pulled I placed back into the crock pot and emptied the entire bottle of bbq sauce and added about 2 oz of more root beer in the bbq bottle to get the remainder of the sauce out, and cooked for an additional hour an half. Throughout the hour and half I was periodically pulling apart the chops with two forks at a time for more of a shredded affect. I used Stubbs bbq, for a gluten free pulled pork recipe. Hope y'all enjoy!

I used 2 lbs of boneless pork rib chops instead of the tenderloin. They shredded easily after 6 hours and came out delicious!

I've made this recipe a couple time I add 1/2 of a chopped onion before I put the pork in. Adds a little extra flavor. I agree that using tenderloin to make pulled pork is a little expensive, I used a less expensive cut and turned out great.

I have a small crock pot, and only two of us to serve, so I used a one pound tenderloin, cut in half, and one cup of root beer. Added BBQ sauce by sight and taste, less than a bottle. It was awesome!

UPDATE: I made this again, with a cheaper cut of pork loin.  It was still good, but the tenderloin was so much better!

This was just ok.  I didn't think the Root Beer did much for it...and it ended up just tasting like BBQ sauce.  I'll go back to my old recipe.

I tired the recipe tonight to surprise my fiancé (since I had the day off, I spent the entire day baking his favorite cookies and wanted him to come home to a nice dinner!). The suggestions to poke the pork with a fork while it simmers was helpful. I also used some Jack Stack meat rub on it as well. It helped keep it moist. (I had 2 loins in the crockpot; 1 was forked and the other was not. The forked pork was MUCH more moist!)

I used a combo of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and Sweet Baby Rays (both were on hand). The sandwich was juicy and tasty. Fiancé liked it and asked for a repeat. I would like to see what other recipes are out there to give it some more "oomph", this seemed very safe. Overall, good recipe.

This was a very easy recipe and taste very good!! I used boneless pork chops because that's all I had on hand and it turned out great!! It didn't smell very appealing while it was cooking in the root beer but once I poured it off at the end of it cooking and added the bottle of bbq sauce it smelled amazing!!

I didnt notice the root beer adding any flavor.  Was hoping this recipe would knock my socks off, not so much.  I'm going to be nice and give it a three star, where as most people seem to either give 5 or 1 stars.  Im just going to say this recipe didnt move me and leave it at that.

not a super big fan of pulled pork sandwiches but this was a big hit with some picky eaters in my family.  I used butt roast vs a tenderloin loin as tenderloin does not shred and can dry things out. use either a butt or shoulder roast, you'll love this.

So easy! used 4 lbs boneless pork sirloin roast and a 2L bottle of generic root beer and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Was very tender and delicious! My new go to recipe to feed a crowd. Only added BBQ sauce to 1/3 of the pork and ate that right away. Will use the rest of the very tender and flavorful pork in tacos or other recipes.

I have made this a few times now, and we have perfected it - we think.    I thinly slice, then halve an onion and put it in the bottom of the crock pot.   Then I plop the pork on top of the onion, then give it two good cranks of cracked black pepper.  Pour the root beer on (we use Hansen's - of all the ones we've tried, it's the best flavor with this) and let it go.   We use Stubbs BBQ sauce - - really like the flavor, and it's about the only one with no High Fructose Corn Syrup.

I never learned how to cook, I thought I'd start now (at age 46!)  I made this recipe and it could not have been easier, my husband and I LOVED it.  I threw out ALL of my cookbooks, which were very intimidating, and they were OLD, now I have this site to use! This pulled pork was really good, I appreciate the simplicity while not compromising taste.

Amazing!! I cooked a 3lb pork-loin for 6 1/2 hours in the root-beer, took it out 'pulled' it apart (really it mostly just shredded itself) put it back in the crockpot for another 1 hour with BBQ sauce and one yellow onion diced - the only thing i chewed in this sandwich was the bun, the pork melted in my mouth. Absolutely a keeper recipe! My x-husband loved it, as well as my 2 toddler kids, myself and my teenage brother.

Just tried this as my first slow cooker experience! It was so easy and absolutely delicious. I followed the receipe exactly except instead of pork tenderlion I used pork butt.  It brought all my kids home for dinner!  I've been bragging about it so much I convinced my cousin to buy a slow cooker to try it!  Served it on potato rolls slightly buttered and quickly toasted in a fry pan.  Side dish of steak fries!! Left overs were packaged and frozen in individual packs for a quick sandwich when mom isn't home to cook! Amazing will absolutely make it again!

Oh my goodness this was great. Served it last night when some friends came over for Monday Night Football. I used a 4lb Pork Shoulder as someone suggested and a 2L bottle of Rootbeer. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Drained and pulled apart, removing any fat I could. Added 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and let sit on low for another hour. 1 bottle was just enough, so if you like it saucy I would recommend 1.5 bottles. With this BBQ sauce it is a little sweet, so maybe choose a different BBQ sauce if you like it more smokey. Buttered split buns and browned under the broiler, then topped with pulled pork and French's Fried Onions (as per another reviewers suggestion). Could not have been better!  All of us were rushing for seconds!!

4 stars with the recipe as is....5 stars with these simple changes. I sear off each side of the roast in canola oil on the stove before putting it in the crockpot. Just 3 or 4 minutes on each side. I've found this helps the roast stay juicy and moist. 

I also leave the roast in with the bbq sauce for at least 30 minutes before serving, to give the flavors a chance to blend together. Top with a simple slaw and this makes a mean sandwich!

This was my first time using a slow cooker! I am young and exploring the kitchen for the first time on my own. I was very impressed with the way it came out. I didnt add anything extra. I used a shoulder piece, and more root beer then asked for. Drained MOST of the root beer but left a little to keep the flavor of the pork (tip from mom) used sweet baby rays bbq sause and I will say i was very impressed for it being my first time. This is a recipe i am keeping!

Excellent recipe! You can use whatever kind of sauce you wish, or none at all! I'm going to try this with sweet & sour or hoisin sauce, with gravy, even cranberry sauce! Lots of pulled pork in our future! Thanks!

I did almost everything the same, except that I didn't have root beer, so I used regular beer. I used pork loin (blasphemy, I know) because it was actually cheaper at the store, and much leaner. It pulled apart perfectly with this recipe. The only problem was that  I didn't read the recipe thoroughly and forgot to drain... oops!

I figured it would save me time on a busy weeknight to come home to this meal, but then I spent more time trying to get my kids to eat it than I would have spent just preparing something they like better.  I didn't feel great after eating it either.  Just a bunch of sugar and meat.  I made coleslaw to go with it, which helped a bit, but I don't think we'll be making it again.

After making this recipe with shoulder for years [trimming, degreasing and still having fatty bits on the finished product], I decided to try a 4 lb Single Pork Loin [not tenderloin] for a small gathering. The finished product had a very thin layer of fat on the surface, it was moist and super tender throughout!
4 lbs of meat, 2 1/2 cans of root beer and 1-40 oz Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce is THE BOMB for 17 people YES 17 large sandwiches! Wait for pork to go on sale and try it, my piece was only $13.

I was a little concerned about cooking pork tenderloin in root beer all day but decided to give it a try based on the amazing reviews this recipe has received here. It was super easy to prepare and the meat was so tender it fell apart on it's own.  
Unfortunately my husband and I both felt we could taste the root beer. Overall the pork was too sweet for our taste, maybe because we're from SC and  are accustomed to a vinegar based barbecue. Probably just a personal preference.

I made this recipe tonight, with a few tweeks from others who reviewed this recipe... I did a dry rub of garlic powder, black pepper, montreal steak seasoning and a pork rub.  I also used about 18 oz of A&W root beer...because I had 2 and a half pounds of tenderloin cooked it for 5 1/2 hours turned it half way through...drained it then shredded it and used one and a half bottles for sweet baby rays sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and cooked for another hour..stirring half way through. It came out FANTASTIC!!! We had it on fresh sandwich rolls from the bakery and I made a homemade cole slaw to go with it. It truly is simple and easy and deserves 10 stars..

I've never made pulled pork before and this turned out great! Super easy! I used pork shoulder and also added half a bottle of beer to the root beer.  I also rubbed some garlic and onion powder and salt on the meat before I poured the root beer in.  Those who said they could taste the root beer must not have poured out all of it before adding the bbq sauce because I couldn't taste any of the root beer...just bbq fantasticness!!

Recipe was a hit and everyone commented how moist it was.  Didn't add BBQ sauce to pork; let people put their own on.  Topped w/ sweet restaurant coleslaw.

I am trying this for dinner tonight! It sounds so good! I did score a great deal on my pork roast, I got it for half off the original price. I didn't want to spend 15.00 bucks for the tenderloin, so I got a boston pork boneless roast, and it's huge. all for 6.00 bucks and I'm using faygo  and frosty mug root beer!
Yummm. I'll let you know how it turns out!

Ok, so same day....I just got done eating this for dinner....OUTSTANDING! Thank you so much Livvie's Mammy for sharing this recipe! It is by far better than any other we have tried, and this will be the recipe we use from now on. This is a great dinner to make when it is 93* out with the air off. The pork was extremely tender and I used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce, my favorite for anything, and only ate it with potato chips, the salty of the chips complimented the sweetness of the pulled pork. Thanks again!!
One last thing........it only took 5 hours in the crock pot!

Some of the comments I got:
"Better than really good southern roadside BBQ!"
"I'd pay $8 for this sandwich! And I'd buy TWO!"

I simply can't believe how EASY this was, and how AMAZING it turns out.  I'm making it again tomorrow!!

A great slow cooker recipe, in that it is simple and tasty, but I made the recipe exactly and found the pork tough after only 7 hours of cooking. Perhaps it was because it was a lean cut, but when I make this again I will leave at least 10 hours to cook, and possibly use a different cut of meat.

We had this tonight - it was terrific and super easy. I made it per recipe, though I only had diet rootbeer in the house, which didn't seem to make a difference. I drained the liquid, shredded the meat - it was like buttah - (used a pork loin roast) after nearly 7 hours on low, then let it sit in the bbq sauce on warm for about an hour. Served it with sauce on the side - we used and love Stubbs Original BBQ sauce. Will definitely make this easy peasy crowd pleaser again!

I never made pulled pork so this was a great guide. The first time I slow-cooked the pork shoulder-butt for 8 hours and it was good. The second time I cooked it overnight ~ 14 hours and it was even better: smaller pieces of pork and easier pulling. Thanks!

This recipe turned out great! I was a little skeptical when I read that one of the ingredients was root beer. The family loved it, my dad even asked me for the recipe. The only thing I changed was adding seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder) to the pork before I poured in the root beer. I will definitely be making this again, and soon!

This was AMAZING!!! I used pork butt and added a whole head of crushed garlic and 1 large onion quartered along with some salt. I used 1 liter from a 2 litter bottle of A&W root beer. Cooked it for 8 hrs and then removed the pork to shred. I cleaned the slow cooker and put in the shredded pork with a whole bottle of Famous Dave's sweet and sassy bbq sauce.  This was perfect and super easy. This is my new bbq pulled pork recipe! Thank you for sharing :)

I love bbq and was very doubtful about this recipe but with so many good reviews, I thought I'd try it.  Oh, boy. It was excellent!  As good as my favorite bbq restaurant at a fraction of the price. I used pork shoulder and it was perfect. When I make it again I will change one thing. Instead of draining and shredding it at 7 hours and then finishing it in bbq sauce for the last hour, I will pull it out of the root beer at 7 hours, shred it, and return it to the hot root beer until ready to serve. Then I would drain it and let people put on their own sauce.  It's not so sweet that way.  Thanks for the recipe. No leftovers here!

This turned out great.  The only change was that we rubbed the pork shoulder with a chipotle seasoning, smoked paprika, and salt & pepper before placing in the slow cooker.  Delicious!  Serve with some slaw on top.

Absolutely delicious recipe.  Added a few dashes of Worcestershire to a mediocre bbq sauce and it gave the pork a nice extra kick.  We also made a simple coleslaw as a topping.  Cabbage, mayo, lime, salt and pepper.  Not your average slaw but it compliments the pork nicely.  Thanks Livie's Mammy, great recipe!

Why would you use pork tenderloin instead of a cheaper cut of meat?  Because the flavor is amazing and you have a LOW FAT pulled pork.  I made this yesterday with Stewart's rootbeer and a bottle of Bulls Eye BBQ sauce (guiness version).  It was a total hit at my "slider party".  Made the cutest, most delicious little sliders on hawaiian sweet rolls.   And it was so easy!  I set the slow cooker in the morning and literally forgot about it the rest of the day until it was time to quickly drain and add the sauce!  This is a must make recipe!

Really not good. My husband and I jokingly called it "Root beer meat." I followed the recipe exactly, used fresh, unopened, high quality root beer, but there was no flavor but stale root beer and it permeated the entire loin. I shredded the meat and simmered it in BBQ sauce and shaved onions to try and cover some of the nasty stale root beer flavor. Definitely will not be using this recipe again, even with tweaks.

I used 2# pork tenderloin (wasn't dry at all, but a cheaper cut should work too). 

Before I put the meat in the slow cooker, I covered it on all sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder & chili powder.  

I used a 20 oz bottle of root-beer (it covered 3/4 of the meat, so I flipped the meat after 3hours).  After 6 hours I drained the meat and it fell apart.  

I finished it off with Sweet Baby Rays Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce.  So good!  I will be making this again.

Sorry to be the detractor here. Yes, it is easy and edible but I like a BBQ where the meat is good even without the BBQ sauce and this just does not fit the bill. Very, very bland before adding the BBQ sauce. Definitely not a keeper for me. Sorry.

I have a recipe for pulled pork that we love but I was looking for something super easy. This recipe definately had that however, I thought it was quite boring. I'm not a BBQ sauce fan and I usually eat pulled pork without it but this one had a hint of sweetness and nothing else.

This is SO good! My husband and I have made it twice so far, and it will be our go-to recipe from now on. We used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin, and it was great. For the BBQ sauce, we used Sweet baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy blend. I recommend making some cole slaw to go along with it. Simple and easy.

Pretty good.  My husband loved it.  I served it with restaurant style slaw from this site.  Definitely has a root beer flavor though, which for me was a little different in my bun.  Will try some other pulled pork recipes still.  Not bad though.

I have made this several times and my picky family loves it!  I have never tasted the "root beer" taste that some people claim to have tasted.  You could easily substitute coke and get the same effect.  Why it works is because soda is an acid and it acts as a tenderizer.  Also, any cut of pork would work.  It doesn't have to be a tenderloin.  What really makes or breaks this recipe is the type of BBQ sauce you use.  Don't buy a cheap low end sauce.  This is not the place to skimp.  Enjoy!

Excellent and soooo easy. Used the pork tenderloin as suggested...also added caramelized onions and Heinz chili sauce to the rest of the sauce ingredients. Cooked on low for 6 hours with all of the ingredients  then shredded the meat and mixed in with sauce and more bbq sauce.  VERY GOOD!

Love this recipe.  Easy, economical, delicious!  I support using the pork tenderloin.  Maybe a little more expensive, but also seems to be a more healthy (less fatty) cut of meat.  Also, if you watch prices and buy in bulk when on sale, you can often get pork tenderloin for $1.99 per pound, so why not?

Very good. I am not a root beer fan but you can't really taste it.  We add sauce at the table rather than stirring it into the crock pot, it keeps the consistency that we like that way.

This was very good! I used a 2.5 lb pork shoulder and 2 cans of A&W root beer. I cooked it on low for 7 hours, drained it, shredded it, and added Sweet Baby Ray's Honey bbq sauce and cooked another 1 hour. Next time I will start cooking it a couple hours earlier because it wasn't "fall of the bone" tender. I had a hard time shredding it but I didn't want to wait any longer to eat! It was still SO good! I couldn't taste any root beer either. I can't wait for leftovers tonight!!

Made this for my husband and he absolutely loved it, he made me make it again the next week.  I let mine cook an extra two hours and it shredded quickly and easily, the root beer is a nice touch so I used either a honey or brown sugar based BBQ sauce to go with it.  They pair up nicely!

This was ridiculously easy, and tasted disproportionately delicious considering the little work involved!  I cooked mine for 6 hours on low in the root beer, then drained it, added some sauteed onions and then the BBQ sauce (make sure you use a good flavorful brand, not the cheap-o stuff), and cooked for another 2 hours.  This was fantastic.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to rub the meat with salt and pepper prior to cooking, because I found that it needed salt at the end.  Thanks for this recipe!

Amazing! Easiest, best pulled pork recipe we've ever tried. The rootbeer gives it a slight smokey flavor, and we used much less barbecue sauce than called for. The whole family loved it!

This was wonderful and so easy.  The one crucial thing that people have to remember is that you must have the right BBQ sauce.  If you just pick one off the grocery shelf, you might be disappointed in the end result.  I used a boneless Boston Butt and it was perfect.

Delicious and easy!!  I used pork shoulder instead, but I'm sure either would be amazing.  I added some sliced onion during slow cook.  After pulling, but before adding BBQ sauce, I added some onion and garlic powder and some Texas Pete's hot sauce.  All changes I made are a matter of personal preference, probably not necessary.  Enjoy!

This dish was great! I used Bulls-Eye Bold Original bbq sauce and it was delicious!  I marinated the meat overnight in the Root Beer added garlic, salt, and pepper.  I served it with warmed Kaiser buns and homemade baked wedge fries. I will be making this again.

It came out great. I had 4 lbs of pork sirloin chops in my freezer and this was a great way to cook them. I used Beer instead of root beer. I also seasoned with salt, pepper, and mustard at the start. I used SBR hickory and brown sugar sauce. While the pork was cooking I made some cole slaw and then put it all in a sandwich. YUMMY!

Its was really good. I changed it up a bit. After cooking the pork in the slow cooker for the recommended time I shreaded it and placed it back in the slow cooker and cooked it in BBQ sauce for another few hours (6-8). Turned out great. I cook this for every party I have

I've never been impressed by a recipe that uses soda as a shortcut, and this one is no different. The pork came out tough, and the root beer flavor is too distinct. Next time I make pulled pork? No shortcuts.

This was the best recipe for pulled pork.  It is so easy, and the meat is so tender and moist!!  It did end up being so moist in fact, that the bread was soaked through.  We used a hickory smoke flavored barbecue sauce for amazing results!!

We have made this many times...the only change is to rub garlic powder and Cajun seasoning before browning the pork roast. I always get rave reviews when I make this!

Love the taste of this. I put the root beer and BBQ sauce together in crockpot and cooked it all at the same time, drained and saved the liquid to use as we wish.

Super easy and yummy! Seasoned the tenderloin (it was on sale, yippee!) with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper and let it sit in the fridge overnight, then used Stubb's Smokey Mesquite BBQ Sauce to finish. Excellent!

While the rootbeer was a decent liquid for cooking it, it did not seem to add any flavor to the pork.  I used country style ribs and they did come out tender.  However, if I didn't use a family favorite bbq sauce, the pork would have been bland and boring.

This was good, but nothing great.  It did not taste as "crock-pot" as most meats, so maybe the root beer helped that.  I liked using pork tenderloin because it is so lean.

This rocked! I bought an 8lbs pork butt as suggested by other reviews. It was very juicy! I used Sweet Baby Rays and also put coleslaw on the sandwich as we love it that way.  Will defnitely make again! Very tender!

I used one bottle BBQ sauce and then added more sauce on the sandwich.  We are saucy people, so the more the better for us....  I'm making it again tomorrow for hubby's work party- he took leftovers to work and everyone wanted his lunch!

Pretty good, but I couldn't taste the root beer and I think I probably mixed the meat up too much because it was a little mushy.

This recipe was great! Leave some of the Root Beer in the crock pot so when pull the meat apart, the meat will aborb it and keep it juicy:)

This turned out great. When I cook for my immediate family, I use pork tenderloin, but when I cooked for 25 people, I used a pork shoulder and cut off the fat. Much cheaper! I used Pepsi, instead of Root Beer, because it's what I had on hand. I cooked in a slow cooker the day before the party, and let it cook some more the next day with water in the bottom, to keep it moist. Then pulled it apart  and added the barbecue sauce. Let it cook until we were ready to eat and it turned out great.  This is a great meal for those on a budget. I paid $25 for a large shoulder roast and it could of fed my immediate family 15 to 20 times. The one thing I would of done differently, is I wish I had separate a third of it out, before adding the sauce, so people that didn't want the sauce on, could have it plain. That would work good, if you wanted to add it to other recipes too!  After feeding 25 people one day and another 15 the second day, we were still able to freeze 2 large gallon size bags of pulled pork. Great recipe!

After reading previous reviews.  I added sea salt & fresh ground pepper to the crock pot.  I also opted for a spicy bbq sauce.  I believe that the spicy bbq is imperative for the recipe since the root beer is so sweet.  This recipe is AWESOME!  Fast, Easy, & Delicious!

Awesome recipe!!  I made it for the family and it disappeared quickly and those that didn't get 2nds or 3rds were bummed.  A coworker and I made a bet during hockey season when our teams played.  If I won, he'd buy In 'n Out (he doesn't cook).  If he won, I'd have to make the pulled pork and bring him a big sandwich, chips, and a drink.  I lost once and he wanted to bet me on everything!

I have made this 10+ times.  This was my staple at all my bbqs this summer and it is a HIT every time!  Theh last couple of times, i have put the pork on potatoe slider rolls.  The rolls really brought it the next level and were so cute!

Really easy to pour rootbeer over the pork and let sit in the crockpot. Meat was very tender. I didn't taste the rootbeer at all since the BBQ sauce was added. I'll be sure to taste the pork before adding the sauce next time.

This was great.  I would give it a four for above average / very good taste, but the ease of preparation bumps it up to a solid five.  I used Dr. Pepper and it turned out terrific.  I'll definitely make this again once football season is in full swing.

This was AWESOME!  Used pork roast with A&W Root Beer.  Cooked on low for 4-1/2 hours, then high for 1/2 hour.  Removed from crockpot and "pulled" the pork, adding Cattleman's BBQ sauce when I was done.  Returned to the slow cooker for about 30 min.  Served with my favorite cole slaw from this site (Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I) YUM! and a fresh fruit salad and BBQ beans.  The meal was absolutely delicious, and my Hubby and son both agreed it was the best pulled pork sandwich they'd ever eaten.  Thanks, Livie's Mammy, this one is in our dinner rotation for GOOD!

Planned on making this with pork shoulder as other reviewers had, but tenderloin happened to be on sale - and for the small portion i was making it actually ended up being cheaper.  Cooked this on low for 7 hours in my crock pot. Drained it, then shredded it very easily and added a generous amount Cattle Boyz bbq sauce, cooked on low for another hour.  Bringing this on a camping trip this weekend, i'm sure it will be a hit - easiest and best pulled pork i have made yet.

Teenager loved it! Very easy. The tenderloin part was a bit dry, so I agree with the other posters to use the shoulder instead. I would make this again.

AMAZING! Easy and oh so good. My husband is very picky and loves this..
My grown children ask me to make for them when I visit. No taste of root beer, didn't smell too bad. Excellent summer dish with claw slaw...Thank you.

I have made this recipe a few times - I am now editing a previous review.  Originally I thought it was flavorless, but I have found that this recipe is only as good as the root beer you use.  When I use basic grocery store root beer, not good.  When I use a "fancy," more flavorful kind available by the 6 pack, delish.  Many compliments at potlucks and people asking for the recipe. I use a 3-5 lb. pork butt instead of tenderloin.

AWESOME! Made it just like the recipe called for....Doubled the meat to a 4lb tenderloin and used 2 bottles of spicy BBQ sauce from the Neelys (Food network stars found in my local grocery store) and it tasted great just on cheap grocery store hamburger buns! Thank you for posting!

This was amazing!  I first seasoned the pork with garlic salt and some Lawry's seasoned salt and then followed the recipe.  It came out delicious.  So, so easy!  Will do again and again.

I did it a little different: 
Sauté onions and garlic with a tbsp of Olive Oil. Then I fork the pork (lol) and do a salt, pepper and minced garlic rub. I place it in the pot and pour 12 oz of sugar cane root beer over it and a tbsp of liquid smoke. Let that simmer for 5-6 hours. Note: I use a stoke pot with a cover on the stove top at a very low heat. I can not find a crock pot not made in Chine but it calls for a crock pot. 
After 5-6 hours I drain the root beer and fork the meat, pour 12-16 ounce of BBQ sauce, stir and simmer for 1-2 more hours. It is sweet but delicious. Serve it on buns with any condiments you enjoy such as BBQ sauce, coleslaw, onions, lettuce and tomatoes. And don’t forget the yummy sides! My Daughter said I could sell this, it is her new favorite.

My family loved it. I made a 4 pound pork roast fried each side before placing it into slow cooker, I used 1 cans of root beer after about 4 hours I added one  onion, red pepper and green pepper to it..  After a few hour I tried it and thought no way did I add the peppers, it tasted like peppers alot,  so I added another can of root beer and let it cook a few more hours, added a bottle of bbq sauce u have to eye ball it don't want it to wet.  let that cook a bit longer.  OMG it was the best pulled pork I have ever had, u couldn't taste the peppers anymore it was sweet and delicious, my kids and husband loved it.. I did cook my pulled pork for around 15 hours on low.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe. I usually make my own sauce for this so I can tweak the taste. I also leave the bbq sauce out sometimes to make the pulled pork for several different meals, ie. tamales, then add the kind of sauce I want later.

Hands down the best pulled pork I've ever made. It was gone and tasted amazing. I saved some for experimenting the next day, this might sound weird but I put some pico de gallo on it in a bun and it was the most amazing thing I ever ate. Try it! :)

Whoa, baby!  This is a delicious recipe and so incredibly easy.  I didn't have slow cooker; used oven-safe All-Clad pot, covered with heavy-duty foil and the pot lid.  Popped in 225? oven for 6 hours.  The pork tenderloin shredded easily with two forks.  One bottle of Baby Ray's Original after cooking, and one bottle on the table for those who wanted more.

This was very easy and so good. It was even better the next day reheated after it had time to really mix with the bbq sauce.

I've never made pulled pork before and couldn't believe it was so easy. I took other reviewers recommendations and used a 7lb pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin since it was for a party and I needed to feed a crowd. I let it cook overnight and then shredded the next day and cooked for an hour in the bbq sauce. Everyone loved it! This is too easy and tasty not to make again.

Excellent! I put salt and pepper along with adobo seasoning all over the roast.  I put dried onion flakes and two huge cloves of garlic (minced).  I covered the roast in rootbeer in the crock pot and cooked on low for 7 hours/.  I drained the rootbeer and used Jack daniels bbq sauce, shredded the pork and cooked on low for an additional hour.  served on hampurger buns with potato salad.

I didn't happen to have any root beer in the house, but I did try Dr. Pepper and it tastes great!  I did also do a little seasoned rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (as suggested by another review).  Delicious.

Great recipe!!!! Thanks to other reviewers, I seasoned my meat prior to cooking.  I actually marinated the meat over night and cooked it in a pressure cooker. (only 1 hour of cooking time)  I'll add an onion next time and see if that further enhances the flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'll be sure to pass it on.

For as simple as this recipe is, it is seriously amazing! Cooked on low for about 7 hours and served on hamburger buns. We will make again very soon (I'm hoping!) and what makes it even better is that this is such an inexpensive meal to make. Thank you so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, and while the pork came out tender enough, there wasn't much flavor to it. If I were to try this again, I would definitely take some of the other reviewers suggestions and add some spices.

Absolutely yummy! I used a boneless pork butt instead of tenderloin since a fatter, less expensive cut is what I thought was used for pulled pork. I didn't have the problem of the sugars sticking to the sides of my slow cooker and I think the cut of meat was why. I definitely will make this one again.

This recipe is so easy to make!  I was hoping for a new favorite.  I am sad to say that it was a huge disappointment.  My husband and I did not enjoy the flavor of the meat with the root beer.  I will not make this again.

This was so easy, I also used a pork shoulder I find it has more flavor to.  I put the frozen roast in the slow cooker for 7 hours on high heat I didn't have rootbeer so I substituted it for pepsi.  After 7 hours i drained it added sauce and shredded left it in slow cooker on warm my husband raved about it and he's pretty fussy when it comes to meat.

Also added a packet of slow cooker pulled pork spice from McCormick, and this was the best pulled pork recipe my entire family enjoyed.  Great even as filling for burritos....yummy!

I did not care for this recipe. For the life of me, I cannot understand how this recipe became an all favourite except that it is easy.  I may never again be able to eat pulled pork or drink root beer.  I cannot give this recipe even one star except that I must in order to publish this review.

We are what some would call real novices at cooking.  When we found this recipe, I thought too easy.  But we cooked it as per the recipe and OMG it was out of this world good.   Thanks so much for publishing it.

i admit that when i saw that the secret (pretty much only) ingredient was root beer, i had my doubts...but i was so wrong! it turns out fantastic. my boyfriend said it rivaled any pulled pork sandwich we've ever had and we've been to a few good ones. i am very pleased with the recipe. i will tell my friends and co-workers. i can't wait to make it again!

The root beer gave it too much sweetness and didn't think it went well with the pork.  Next time I will try beer instead.

Made this with a 4lb boneless pork shoulder and it was PERFECT. Put it on at 11pm done at 6:30am .Took the pork out let it sit to cool a little then wraped it in foil. Put the liquid in a bowl in the frig also. Got home warmed the liquid with a jar of BBQ sauce shread the pork mixed it in. And yummy

Super easy and tastes great.  I added root beer to my sauce and cooked another 45 minutes on low.  Tasted wonder and was very moist. Was a huge hit at a work party and took no time to make!

I made this last night and WOW! This is one of the mosy delicious things I've ever made. It was so easy. I cooked it on High for 4 hours and it literally fell apart when I picked it up with a fork. I then added the BBQ sauce and cooked it an addl hour on High. It was quite filling. I usually get requests for 2nd helpings and although delicious, everyone was satisfied with one sandwich.

Made this for my wife for Mother's Day, her request for pulled pork.  Made the recipe half as big again for the 7 adults and 3 kids.  No leftovers, only compliments.  Easy and good, how much better does it get.  Gave me enough time to make home made buns.  I used the tenderloin because it was on sale this week but I think that like others would normally use a less expensive cut of pork.

This was fantastic!  It was such a hit that I actually made it twice this week  :)  I agree with the reviews that say to use a cheaper cut of meat.  The first time I used a 2 lbs. tenderloin b/c that's what I had ($14 worth of meat) and a thick and spicy bbq sauce.  The second time I used a 3.5 lbs. roast ($7 on sale) and a hickory sauce.  The roast was just as tender and pulled apart just as easily.  Once I shredded the meat I added the sauce and put it back in the pot on low until my husband came home.  This will be a regular meal and a definite party food from now on!

So easy to make, and it was so yummy! The addition of the root beer adds some great flavor. I add a little bit of brown sugar after I shred the pork. Tastes great!

I was really surprised at how bland this recipe was especially after reading all the rave reviews.  The pork was nice and tender but sauce was very lacking in taste.

I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't turn out very well. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and it was pretty dry. I had to pull the meat apart by hand.  I wonder if the thermometer on the crock pot is off because I can't imagine that I cooked it too long. I had a 6 lb pork roast. It was very tough :(

Edited to add that I have learned that most times when a cut of meat like this still remains tough, then it has not had enough time to tenderize-it can take 8-10 hours, so if your meat is tough, keep cooking it! Other than chicken, most meats will eventually fall apart if you keep cooking them.

This was awesome. I have a large oval crock pot though, and I would suggest adding more root beer or water if you also have a large one. This time I actually added a cup of water about halfway through and then broke up the meat when it was soft enough. 

I HAVE to figure out something to do with the leftover juice. It's so tasty I could drink it. Don't pour it out!

THE HUBBY LOVED IT!!  I used a 2.5 lb pork butt, which only cost $6, and two cans of the cheapest root beer the supermarket had.  Couldn't have been easier!  Definitely recommend you drain well BEFORE shredding, otherwise you might have a little more residual root beer flavor but otherwise the root beer taste is indistinct.  This recipe is going on my shortlist!

LOVED this!  As a mom of 3 boys (ages 5, 3, 1), I was looking to cook something easy.  I had a pork tenderloin and wanted to cook it differently than normal!  I searched for slow cooker pork tenderloin recipe and ran across this.  I thought it was too good to be true, but it was wonderful!  My two older sons asked for seconds and they are picky eaters.  When I saw the number of reviews and still an excellent rating, I thought I should try it...I'm so glad I did!  I cooked it exactly how it was described.  Thank you for this recipe!  I will certainly cook it again.

Oh My Word ~ ~ ~  yummy!  I made this with an 8lb pork shoulder as suggested in some of the reviews, filled it with Root Beer just to the top of the roast and cooked it for 10 hours on low.  I shredded it (so easily). Then divided it in half and doused with Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ sauce, then saved it in the fridge until the next day. Each Fri, the 2nd shift guys where my hubby works,  take turns bringing dinner in for the 4 man crew. As it was Hubby's turn, I sent the pork, extra sauce, buns, coleslaw and chips. Had Hubby put it in their crock pot 2 hrs before serving, on low,,,, they LOVED it! One poor guy ate 4 sandwiches and was miserable the rest of the night,,, but asked to take the leftovers home, HA!

Very easy and very tasty. I wasn't sure how the root beer would be but it kept the pork very moist.  I find Pork can usually become very dry when slow cooked.  Worth investing in a good quality, milder bbq sauce.  I used a Hickory and Apple wood one and was very pleased with the results

Good stuff!  I used a pork shoulder roast rather than the tenderloin, and it turned out delicious.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  =)

Made this for my birthday last year, it was a big hit!  Very easy, I found the pork on sale so it wasn't too expensive to feed a crowd.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I used barq's root beer with sweet baby ray's and wasnt overly keen on the flavour left by the root beer.  Next time i will be cooking in beef stock.  I also prefer to serve with coleslaw in the bun.  Other than that it was a great recepie and easy way to cook the meat!  Cheers!

Followed the instructions and was not happy with results at all. Really bland. However, it appears that the type of bbq sauce used completely makes the difference. When I originally made it, I used a mustard based bbq sauce, as I'm not partial to the standard ones. When reheating the next day, I used a regular bbq sauce and it was great. I give the recipe 5 stars but feel a notation should be made about the type of bbq sauce so others don't make my mistake. :)

Who would have thought Root Beer? Didnt even taste it as I thought there would of been more flavor of it but it still tasted great! I didnt toast the buns but will the next time. I usually dont like slow cooker recipes but it is nice to have dinner ready when you come home!

I made this for my sons birthday party and we had about 25 people.  It was excellent.  I used a pork shoulder and cooked it for 7 hrs.  We took the meat out, shredded it and mixed the bbq sauce in.  It was excellent!!  We will definately do this again.  Thanks!

Who'd of thought, rootbeer.  I used a rolled pork butt in a crockpot and pork came out fantastic.  My wife who usually doesn't like pulled pork because of it's "porky" taste had two sandwich.  I served my Carolina style with a nice slaw recipe here on All Recipes.  For a switchup next time I might try Dr. Pepper.  Hey, if rootbeer works why not?

I used a cheaper pork roast to serve 4 (about 1 pound).  The sauce was amazing and this was done at exactly 7 hours.  I served this with carrots.  I will make this again.

Delicious! Although, I didn't follow recipe exactly.

Used a 4 lb pork shoulder, marinated overnight in 24 ounces root beer.

Cooked 10 hours on low with garlic, worcestershire, and johnny's seasoning.

Mixed with 13 ounces of barbecue sauce.

DELICIOUS.

So simple. Delightfully easy. And came out so well! I was a little skeptical at first because the recipe seemed so easy. I'm so glad I decided to do it anyways. I used another recipe on here for the sauce: Big Al's K.C. Sauce. Great addition.

I've made this for a large group and was repeatedly asked for recipes. Excited to make it again today for an even larger party. This dish is amazing in its simplicity. No tweaks required. If you like it Memphis style, cole slaw on top is a nice touch.

Made this recipe with a 2lb tenderloin which turned out beautifully but my only problem is the root beer. If you are not a fan of root beer, don't use it. That is all I could taste when I ate the pork. Will try again but use a different liquid, possibly beer.

I'm fairly new to the kitchen so I made this recipe as-is even though I noticed many others saying that a different cut of pork could be used. I've made this a few times now and I've gotten so many compliments on it! Very very easy to make, even for a novice like me!

I made this for the super bowl game yesterday and it was awesome! No one noticed any rootbeer flavor to it. I used sweet baby rays sauce and pork butt roast. I will definitly make this again!

This was very tender and yummy, and very simple! We all enjoyed it very much. I did, however, follow the others advice to use a pork shoulder.

I followed the others advice of using a boston butt, rubbing it down with salt, pepper and garlic powder, and cooking it on low for another hour with the BBQ sauce in it.  It was amazing!!

I used a less expensive roast cut and beer instead! A bunch of chopped onion and garlic along with seasoned salt and pepper. Famous Dave's BBQ sauce mixed with a little of the beer from the crock pot. It was fabulous!! Great for game day!! :)

Loved this!  Very simple.  A couple of change...I didn't use a whole bottle of barbecue sauce.  I ended up using 1/2 to 1/3 of a bottle of Dinosaur BBQ Sauce and it was perfect!!  Also, I used a 5 lb. pork butt/shoulder.  Much better flavor!

Excellent.  Great leftovers.  Time consuming, but so easy and worth it.  The most difficult part was being home smelling it while it was cooking and not being able to eat it! Will definitely make again.

WOW!!  I LOVE pulled pork and this was delicious!  We even made more the next day to bring to a family get-together!  Used a shoulder cut and Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce and 2 bottles of root beer (wasn't sure if the whole thing needed to be covered) DEFINATELY A KEEPER!!

Root Beer....who would have thought.  It was really good though. I used a pork butt and followed some other suggestions of spices.  We like lots of onion and garlic so I rubbed the roast down with garlic and onion powder, black pepper and sea salt.  I used K-C masterpice bar-b-que and it was great!

Using root beer adds unnecessary sugar to the meat.  Made it way too sweet.  Didn't like at all.

My family loved this recipe. I used a three pound pork tenderloin and seasoned it with garlic powder and pepper. I poured 1 to 2 TBSP of liquid smoke ditectly on tenderloin before I added a 20 oz bottle of rootbeer. I turned slow cooker on low before leaving for work and it cooked about 8-9 hours before I got home and was able to shredd and add sauce. It was still perfect.

Used Picnic Roast as this was all the market had left of cheap pork. Added powdered onion and garlic with the Root beer. On low for 6 hrs, pulled from slow cooker and pulled apart. When adding back in to slow cooker, I layered it. Some BBQ with a dusting of onion and garlic powder along with 6 dash of Hot sauce, layer of pulled port, layer of BBQ, onion and garlic powder than last layer of pulled pork. Topped it off with dusting of onion and garlic powder, 6 more dashed of Hot sauce and a bit more BBQ. Folded in pot until well mixed and slow cooked it another hour. Never had better Pulled Pork BBQ!

Love the idea of slow cooker pulled pork, but don't notice the root beer added much to the meat's flavor.  It was very tender so perhaps the use of root beer its more for the acids in the soda, but perhaps another form of moisture would result in more flavor.  Used a pork shoulder cut and after slow cooking for seven hours low, pulling it, mixed it with BBQ sauce, and put it back in the slow cooker for another hour.  Always pick up local BBQ sauces when traveling, so plan on slow cooking pork again with another sauce.

very easy and tasty recipe two things I always look for. Only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was the taste the rootbeer gave the pork while good was not excellent. Will definitely make again.

Good, but I changed it. This would be so bland with just root beer and then bbq sauce! I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced onion. I shredded the pork when it was cooked, and cooked it about another hour with the bbq sauce. This was a fine recipe, but can definitely get better bbq by going out!!

When I was making this I was "Thats it? No salt and pepper?" I fought the urge to add to the recipe, I am so glad I did! It was melt in your mouth perfection! I did not have a tenderloin on hand so I just used a pork roast..and it still was heaven! Thank you thank you for this AWSOME recipe!

Not real sure why I added a can of root beer to this?   Also not sure why this recipe gets such rave reviews?  The texture was mushy, flavor was non-existant until I added my barbecue sauce, upon which it just tasted like my barbecue sauce.  I could just salt & pepper my pork, add a tad bit of water, and slow cook it, add my barbecue sauce & get the same results, without having mushy pork.   We topped it with pickles & onions to give it some "ooomph".

So easy and delicious.  I was skeptical at first because it did not smell great but once I stirred the bbq sauce in it smelled amazing.  Definitely a keeper.  Tastes even better the second day.  I would recommend using a pork loin as other reviewers said as it is MUCH cheaper.  We shredded the pork about 5.5 hours in and let it sit in the root beer for about half an hour before adding the BBQ sauce and then let that sit for another half hour to let everything marry.  perfect!

My husband and I both took one bite and we were done.  All we could taste was root beer...and we both hate root beer.  I used a little more than the 12 oz of root beer since other reviews said they couldn't taste it.   Man, that was the wrong move!!!  It was moist and tender, but could not get past that root beer taste.  If you like root beer, then this is a good recipe, if not, then I wouldn't recommend.   Needless to say, we won't be trying this one again.

This was okay, but not exceptional. I got an aftertaste of cooked root beer which wasn't that appealing to me. I would not make this again.

Who knew pulled pork could be so easy!! I made my first batch with a piece of meat a little less than 3 lbs. Came out so PERFECT. I used toasted Kings Hawaiin rolls with a little coleslaw on top. Was an instant hit at a New Years Eve party. Am planning on making for an upcoming poluck. Love this recipe! Thanks for posting! I wouldn't change a thing!

I don't think the rootbeer added anything, but unnatural ingredients.   I thought it had a bit of a strange flavor before I added the sauce.  Luckily the sauce covered it up.   I will use a rub next time before cooking, then cook, shred and add the sauce.

We really didn't care for the taste of root beer in the meat. It seemed like a great idea, because who doesn't love root beer? Just too sweet for meat.

Easy and excellent! I loved it that I had all the ingredients on hand to make a family dinner! I also only used about half the sauce so it wouldn't be too sweet, and others can add more if needed. I will make again!

This was very very good with a few minor adjustments. I use the boneless half pork loin when it goes on sale with 20 oz. Root Beer and one bottle of Barbecue Sauce and cook it on low for 6 1/2 - 8 Hours. When it is done I shredded it and added a bit of the liquid and a bottle of Barbecue Sauce and heat it. It is great! Even better the second day too.

I was skeptical to try this but used a 2 pound pork loin and my own recipe for barbecue sauce and it turned out amazing. I fixed it up before work, and when I got home I took two forks and the loin shredded like a dream. Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly.

Wow.  This was so simple to make and the leftovers were great.  I followed the recipe only adding a couple of things.  Rubbed garlic salt and pepper on it. I then poke holes in the meat to better flavor the meat.  Placed thick slices of onions on the bottom of slow cooker and placed meat on top of the onions.  Added the root beer and let it cook on low for 6 hours.  Shredded the pork and chopped the onions.  Mixed both with BBQ sauce and continue to cook on warm for another hour to blend the flavors.

I really didn't think the root beer added any flavor and in fact thought this came out a bit dry.  I think next time I'll go ahead and pour in the bbq sauce at the beginning, that way the meat can really absorb the flavor.

Awesome meal!  I have made this several times for guests and everyone LOVES it and it is so easy.  I have used pork shoulder each time just because it costs less than tenderloin.  Mix with Trader Joes Bold and Smoky Kansas city style BBQ sauce, and add some broccoli slaw as a side or on the sandwich--delicious!

This was a pretty good recipe.  It really needed to be seasoned, so i used a dry garlic and chili pepper rub. Also, i left it overnight, sliced it in the morning, and served it for supper.  The longer this baby can simmer, the better!

I've made this several times and it always turns out fabulous!  I used a whole pork butt instead of the loin.  It's less expensive and I think it has more flavor.

This is soooooo good. The meat was very tender. I did not use tenderlion but a cheaper piece of meat (the butt) and it turned out GREAT. I rubbed spices on the roast the night before and let it sit in the fridge till morning when i just tossed it in the crock pot. I also made some Apple Butter BBQ sauce which made it even better. My husband loved it and so did my kids. 5 stars for sure!

Super easy! I use pork shoulder roast, about 4.5lbs, cooked as directed, using Sweet Baby Ray's sweet honey or sweet vadalia BBQ sauce. Serve on Kings Hawaiian rolls for tasty pulled pork sliders. Have been a hit with all eaters!

This recipe was merely mediocre. I had to add a bunch of stuff to give it more flavor. The pork was complely tender, though.

I made this once awhile ago and thought it turned out too sweet but I used KC Masterpiece.  Today I had a craving and gave this another try and boy, am I glad I did!  This time I used a spicy Gates bbq sauce from Kansas City and it was delicious.  My teenage boys gobbled it down! Thanks for a super easy, delicious recipe!

Easy, easy, easy, that is the best way to describe this recipe. Using pork shoulder is the way to go. It is cheap and does not dry out when cooked for several hours. The smoke flavor is not there and it is a little mushy instead of having a sturdier texture,but that does not take away from it being a good easy way to make BBQ for a crowd.

I followed the recipe exactly as is the first time however it seemed the sauce was overwhelming for our taste so I did not add the barbecue sauce the second time I actually put the pulled pork on a toasted bun and then topped with some of the sauce..to us it was so much better this way but just our preference..will cook again and again

Loved it! I ussed a Boston Butt because that is how my mother made it when we were children. I liked the roort beer. I did a bit of a rub and might soak it over night next time and I made my own sauce. It's great, I hope my husband loves it as much as I do!

I followed the recipe, except I used coke instead of Root beer. I mixed 3/4 bottle of regular BBQ sauce with 1/4 bottle of hickory flavour BBQ sauce. Divine! Leftovers freeze well but sometimes I use the leftover for shepherd's pie instead of ground beef and everyone raves about it.

In my opinion this recipe was an awesome starting point and idea for making the pork tender and tasty. I did use a different cut of pork and seasoned the pork with S&P, Paprika, Cumin, crushed red peppers, a pinch of red curry seasoning, half an onion cut up, and made 7-8 cuts in the meat and filled with a bit of garlic then put in 16oz of A&W Rootbeer. After ithe meat cooked on low for 8 hours I drained a good majority of the liquid and then added Masterpiece Spicy BBQ sauce to cook for another hour or so. House smelled sooooo good that whole day and tasted even better the next day for lunch. Once again, awesome recipe!

I made the recipe using a pork roast and it came out very good!  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the pork before adding the root beer.  Will be making again soon!  TFS!

This recipe is about as easy as it gets! I used a ~4lb. pork shoulder and 2 cans of Hansen's root beer.  The root beer added just the right amount of sweetness to the pork without being overpowering (I was worried about this given I'd never cooked with soda!). Unlike an earlier review, I had no problem with the soda sticking to the sides of the crockpot. Extremely easy clean-up.  Super tasting!

YUMMY!!!! I don't know what influence the root beer had in flavoring the pork, but I swear this has got to be some of the best pulled pork that I've ever tried. We stuffed the pork in chinese sweet buns and had one of the best dinners. The kids were raving about it. I followed the other reviews and got a pork shoulder cut, which was 10 bucks for 4 pounds. I seasoned the pork a little before placing in the root beer, but I really doubt that it needed it.

Love it, and so does everyone who ever tries it, they all ask for the recipe and are so surprised when I tell them the simple ingredients.  A tip for all the leftovers:  Quesadillas with the pork and some shredded cheese, so yummy.

My family loved this!!  A couple changes I made were cutting the soy sauce in half, adding a can of beef broth, and only 3 cups of water.  It took five minutes to put together in the morning before leaving for work.  When I got home, just buttered up some rolls with/without cheese and toasted them up, made some fries, and ate.  YUM!!

I host a weekly lunch at my house for 15 teenagers. I think this was a great success!!! It dissapeared very quickly!   I soaked this overnight and cooked it 4 hour before draining the rootbeer. The last two hours were cooked in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.   SOOOOO GOOOOODD!!!

What an amazingly easy and DELICIOUS dish! The perfect recipe for tailgating season and with the budget of a newlywed and new home owner, it was more than impressive at a cost that was easy to swallow :) We'll be making it again for this weekend's game!

I made this for a family dinner when I didn't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. It was so easy and the root beer made it very tender. It shredded very easily. I used pork loin roast instead of pork tenderloin and Open Pit, our favorite BBQ sauce. Everyone really enjoyed it and we served the leftovers for friends the next day, and they also liked it.

I tried this receipe while camping.  Needed something for a crockpot potluck.  Had a different meal planned, but wanted something easier.  Used a pork shoulder (2 of them, 1 at 6 lbs, 1 at 7lbs.)  Used 1 1/2 bottles of root beer each.  Cooked for approx 7 1/2 hrs.  Drained & covered in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Smaller one was ready first.  It was a HUGE HIT!!  Had the other one for leftovers the next day and for dinner when we got home on Monday.  We all loved it!!

I didnt have any rootbeer so I used diet dr pepper and a couple of teaspoons of sugar and sliced onions turned out really good. I will be making this again with rootbeer next time.

Wow. Just wow. 1 change: I used pork shoulder instead due to the price. I trimmed most of the fat off the meat before putting in the pot b/c there is plenty of internal fat to keep it moist. I used A&W root beer and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce. We top ours with coleslaw, but thats a family thing :) It's really simple, incredibly tasty and fool proof. TRY IT!

I will be making this meat but using a great bbq sauce from this website- Big Al's K.C BBQ sauce..  My family loves this bbq sauce and I will repost after I make this with it  :) .. I dont see how this pulled pork recipe can go wrong with 1000 reviews averaging 4.5 stars!

Got a 2 lb pork roast, added two 20 oz bottles of Root Beer, put in for 7 hours, took out and stirred in a bowl with a bottle of Jack Daniel's® Honey Smokehouse. Served on potato buns. Yum!

Delicious and so easy!  I used a pork shoulder and cut off the fat before putting into the slow cooker.  Meat was so tender and easy to shred.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce.  Next time I will use Coke instead of Rootbeer.  Rootbeer is really strong and has a distinctive taste.  Served on buns and with coleslaw.  Easiest dinner I've made in a long time...will definitely make it again!

Not for us. Not one person in my family liked it. I especially did not like the root beer flavor. The only plus to this recipe is the simplicity.

Talk about easy! I had a pulled pork recipe that was also good but took forever and lots of ingredients.  This is every bit as good. It does need a little seasoning though. I seasoned it after I got it all shredded and it was so good.

A really simple and delicious recipe.  You could easily substitute a cheaper cut of meat and come out with a really delicious meal.  Be careful to drain it well or it will be too thin.

AMAZING! Best pulled pork ever! It was so easy my kids could have made it! I used a 4lb Boston butt because it cheaper and more. Cooked it overnight w/ rootbeer, shredded it in the morning, added some Sugar Ray's Brown Sugar n Hickey BBQ sauce, slow cooked it for another hr and BAMM - lunch and dinner! My family loved it! We made sandwiches and even used the meat on nachos.

This was excellent. Very tender. Because it doesn't have alot of spices in it, its all about the barbecue sauce.  Sometimes less is more.  I made it exactly like the recipe and it came out perfect.

Was very good as well as easy. I as one review said used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but I used the sweet and spicy and it was good. I also as one review said, thought it would be hard to clean the crockpot but it cleaned up easily and I did not spray it with cooking spray, I used a  salt and pepper rub on the meat before cooking and I did use a little bit more than 12 oz of rootbeer.  I also sprinkled some meat tenderizer on the meat while it was cooking. I will be making this again for the family reunion in another week.

Like most others, my reaction was, "What? Rootbeer?" I salted and peppered my tenderloin and cooked it in the rootbeer for the first 6 hours. When I went to drain the rootbeer I did think it smelt terrible! Then I added the BBQ sauce (I used Jack Daniels Orig. #7) and cooked it for 1 hour more. IT WAS PHENOMENAL! The whole family loved it. Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is great for the working woman. It was so easy to throw in the crook pot and leave it for the day. Served with some chips and coldslaw it is perfect sandwich. The best part was that the cut of meat was low in fat so you do not have to feel bad for loading up on some spicy BBQ sauce.

This recipe was WONDERFUL and so easy! I had a pork tenderloin in the freezer and I thawed it in the fridge the night before. In the morning, I pulled out the porkand rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic salt. Since it was a very long cut, I divided it up into about four pieces roughly the same size. Poked some holes in the meal, threw it into the crockpot and let it go all afternoon!  It was so easy and I loved it. I used Jack Daniels Spicy BBQ sauce and the taste was phenomenal! Everyone was RAVING about it. I will definitely make this again :D

I couldn't believe how easy and how incredibly tender and great tasting this was!  It really did just fall right apart b/c it was so tender.  I was short on time, so I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then low for the rest of the time -- turned out great.

I made this recipe (along with Big Al's BBQ Sauce from this site) and it was wonderful!  Received raves from ALL -- and one 5 lb. pork shoulder later, the crock pot was empty!  Only changes I made were to add more root beer and 3 large garlic cloves.  Cooked for 6 hours, shredded, added sauce and cooked add'l 1.5 hours.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

The BEST!! Do not change a thing. It is so easy and melts in the mouth. My family is always asking me when I am going to make it again. I have made this a few times and used different BBQ sauces with the same results Thank-you very much for passing this recipe along!!

Like others, I was skeptical about cooking with root beer...smell?  mess?  flavor?  No problems!  I used a less expensive cut of pork and it was so moist.  It was about five-six pounds and took over eight hours to cook.  Used it with Western North Carolins Vinegar Barbeque Sauce from this site.  Excellent! And oh, so easy.  This will be a regular dish in our home.  Served it with Creamy Spiced Coleslaw also from this site.   Thank you for sharing!

This was  the best pulled pork I have every made. It was so easy to do and My husband just loved it. He said  that is a keeper. I didn't change a thing. I like to make  the recipes first and then if I  want to change I will do it the next time I make it.  I also made Sweet Restaurant Slaw  to go on top of it. and to top it off I made the Yankee Salad. Boy   you all helped me out  a lot. Thanks to all. Love them and love Allrecipes. And if you haven't tried these recipe you should.  Thanks again Bev in Ohio

I made this for the first time on Father's Day.  My husband was so sure this wouldn't work.  Awesome recipe.  My doubting husband made sure the leftovers were hidden in the refrigerator for his sandwiches!!!  We plan on making this again and again.  I've already shared the recipe with 2 friends.

I tried this over the weekend and wouldn't reccomend using rootbeer.  The taste was bland to say the least and the after taste was terrible.  it took hours of tweeking with other ingredients to get it to something edible.  Sorry, just not for me.

This is an easy yet very tasty recipe.  I used a pork roast instead of a tenderloin and it worked perfectly.  The meat was tender and juicy and the roast is cheaper.  My husband loved it so I am going to make it for our family reunion.  Hopefully it is a hit!

This was so delicious!  I added brown sugar and other seasonings then, cooked it for 6 hours.  I added some smoked honey bbq sauce for the final 30 minutes.  My husband and I can't stop eating it.  It was still juicy 3 nights later for leftovers.

I know a lot of people have reviewed this and thought it was wonderful, but I am sorry to say I found the meat lacking in taste.   To give it credit, the meat was very moist and once I added the barbecue sauce this was a good recipe, but not great.

After seeing how many reviews this pulled pork got I was excited to try it. But, as you can tell by the recipe it is very simple so at best I have to say it's an average recipe. Did people at the party like it? Yes. Was it easy? Yes. For those reasons, I think this pulled pork recipe is great for someone who just wants a standard, easy pulled pork. But I don't see how this can deserve 5 stars...there was nothing really special about it and it was definitely not the best pulled pork I've ever tasted. It was not bad though.

I made this on Sunday for my husband's birthday and it got rave reviews from the crowd of 15!  I seasoned and trimmed the fat from two 4 lb pork rump roasts and put them in the crock pot with 4 cans or root beer and cooked on high for 4 hours.  When I got home over 5 hours later, I had a hard time getting the 4 pounder out of the crock pot because it was falling apart.  After shredding the meat I added 1/2 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ sauce and 1/2 bottle of their Hickory Brown sugar and returned the meat to the crock pot and put on warm. Delicious!

This was amazing! I cooked it exactly as written, only I halved the recipe as there were only two of us. It was delicious! I used Stubb's BBQ sauce, which lent an awesome smoky sweetness. I served it with corn on the cob and brown sugar & bourbon baked beans. I think my boyfriend likes me even more now! I definitely will make this again! I think I may try using pork shoulder next time to see if it really is more flavorful. The tenderloin was tasty, but a bit spendy!

YUM! I'm not really a fan of pork tenderloin (I know -- I'm crazy!). So when I found myself in possession of a free pork tenderloin, I didn't know what to do with it. I was very glad to find this recipe. The pulled pork sandwiches turned out moist and flavorful.   I probably wouldn't buy an expensive tenderloin to make a crockpot recipe, but this was a creative and tasty way to use what I had.

Really good and extremely easy.  I put this on at 9 at night in a slow cooker with a warm setting.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours and didn't think about it again until about 10:30.  I drained the rootbeer and it shredded with two forks in just a few mintues.  I added the BBQ sauce and heated it on high for about 20 minute to warm it up.  It was a hit for lunch!

this was simple yet delicious. The whole family devoured them.  I doubled the recipe and there was only about 1/4 cup meat leftover from dinner. I will definitely make this again.  Especially on a busy day since this recipe took no effort at all.

AWESOME Recipe.  I followed the Recipe and everyone just loved it. Months later and everyone still talks about how awesome it was. I used 2 shoulders. I wasn't able to get much Root Beer in with both shoulders in the cooker but the juices from the meat were just enough. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I mixed the Sweet BBQ & Spicy and it was just perfect. Will make this over and over. Yummy!

Never thought I'd enjoy pork soaked in root beer until I tried this. So incredibly easy to make and the pork falls off the fork. I did 'spice' it up a bit before I put the root beer in. I rubbed with kosher salt and fresh gound pepper front and back, then added minced garlic and rubbed. I'll admit the smell of root beer and garlic cooking is not the best, but the taste is AMAZING. Used Chris and Pitts BBQ sauce and was licking my fingers after seconds! Will make several times. Also, grocery store did not have tenderloin (honestly), so I used pork shoulder.

I've made this many times, always easy and so good.  Sweet Baby Ray's is a must have and if I don't have root beer, I use beef broth instead, just the same, less sweet.

This was a huge hit with everybody.  Easy to make.  I liked using the tenderloin, so that there was less fat.  Very tender and a nice flavor.  Will try it again with different types of bbq sauce.  We used hickory, honey, bbq.  Will also start sooner next time so that it will cook longer.  I think it would be even more tender that way.  We were hungry and ate after about 6 hours.

This is a wonderful recipe! Because I was making such a large portion I went with the Boston Butt and it was amazing. That's the only thing I changed. It was a big hit at the party and everyone ate it all :)

This is really delicious. Mild but has a great special flavor w/the rootbeer! I used a mild BBQ sauce but put in a dash of cayenne, garlic & salt too. Next time will use a spicier BBQ but not a LOT cuz the taste of the rootbeer is really great!

Used a 4 lb shoulder, 4 cans of root beer, one can of water, and rubbed the shoulder with seasonings before I put it in th slow cooker. The meat was almost covered completely. I let it  cook for 10 hours and when I got home it was ready to go. I drained it, reserved about a cup of the liquid to put in with the sauce, shredded it and put in some Stubb's original sauce (I'm a Texas girl) and the broth. The result was crazy, tender, awesome goodness that rivals any restaurant pulled pork I've ever had. I will use this recipe again and again and again. The un-sauced meat was not super sweet, it was super moist and just plain wonderful. I made again the same way with tenderloin (for 10 hours) and it wasn't stringy or tough at all. I'll do it with this cut from now on to save on fat and calories.

This was very tastey!!! I used a cheaper cut of meat. The bbq sauce I used was very sweet, next time I will try a spicey sauce because the rootbeer makes it very sweet. I will keep using this recipe!

I cooked the pork tenderloin for 6 hours on low with the root beer. I then shredded it, reserved 1/2 cup of the liquid and then cooked it for another hour with the Sweet Baby Ray's and the liquid. It was awesome and easy!!! And there wasn't a mess to clean up. I will definitely make this again! The kids loved it!

The root beer adds a nice sweet flavor to it.  We tried making it without root beer once, and it wasn't very good at all.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This is the best pulled pork recipe I have ever found.  It's easy and tasty!  Tip: After you have pulled the pork, put it back in the slow cooker with the "juice" (to your prefererence) from the cooking process.  Serve right from the slowcooker with the Asian Slaw.  My family oves it!!!

delicious!  I added a bit of garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Also, I just placed the roasts in a roasting pan at 450 F for 1 hour then turned the oven down to 200 F for 4 hours.  So tender and easy to shred.  Heated and browned buns on the grill, served with fresh cilantro and coleslaw on top!!!  So awesome!  Great for large groups.

Delicious I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out great.  I also like other reviews use only Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  I would definitely do it again but next time I will marinate the pork shoulder in the rootbeer overnight.

Delicious. I always use crock pot liners. If you run out of them, fill crock pot with hot water and add 1/2 cup or more of dishwasher detergent granules. In about 30 minutes, your crock pot will rinse clean with no scrubbing.

We loved this...was a little skeptical, after cooking in the rootbeer and shredding the pork, didn't think it was much different than other well seasoned pork in the crockpot, after adding the sauce and reheating, the flavors really come out! Will make this again!

I used a pork shoulder and 1 can of root beer, cooking on low in the slow cooker for 7 hours and then attempting to shred, but I think that it could have cooked a lot longer (we were pressed for time so we couldn't wait). I had to slice the meat as it didn't come out too tender, then put it in a casserole dish with the bbq sauce and cooked on 350° for 30 minutes or so. The flavour was great but the tenderness wasn't quite there. Next time I will take the advice of others here and cover the meat with root beer, cooking for about 10 hours on low, and then try the shredding. Easy recipe, just needed longer with a shoulder!

I was nervous after reading the review about rating the actual recipe (which I agree is a valid point).  We found this recipe very good.  I wasn't sure when to add the BBQ sauce so just did it at the same time as the root beer.   We served it with the left-over root beer (to drink) to complement the meal.   Also served baked french fries and steamed veggies for a quick easy yummy meal.  My picky 3 year old even liked it.

I have a recipe for rootbeer pulled pork that is similar (not sure if it came from this site!).  But the pork cooks in JUST the rootbeer with a sliced onion, some garlic and salt & pepper.  When the pork is done, you simmer 2 cans of root beer with a jar of chili sauce until it reduces and put that over your pork.  AMAZING!  I guess you could cook it all together, but the nice, thick sauce is wonderful.

This is a great, easily adaptable recipe. I made this yesterday before work with Sweet Baby Ray's and a bottle of regular beer as I thought root beer would be too sweet. I seasoned the pork with some salt, pepper, and chili powder before adding to the crock pot. Also, I used a pork butt rather than tenderloin. I let this cook all day and added some more barbecue sauce half way through cooking. This was very easy and made for a very tender pulled pork sandwich

This is a family favorite, so easy to make.  I season the pork shoulder with williams sonoma coffee rub first, then use KC Masterpiece bbq sauce, serve it on a roll with cole slaw, it is so yummy!

Wonderful flavor! Great recipe. So easy. I used a lemon garlic pork tenderloin for this, cheap rootbeer, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Hubby loved this, me too! A keeper!

My first time making pulled pork and usied a new slow cooked.  I followed the suggestions of others and used a pork shoulder butt and Sugar Ray's BBQ sauce.  Cooked the pork on low overnight and then shredded the pork and added the BBQ sauce the next morning.  Delicious and yummy.  Would definitely make again and again!!

YUM!!! I had a few pork tenderloins in the freezer and felt like using the slow cooker. I came across this recipe and almost did not make it because I had no root beer. After reading another review I found that it came out fine then water was used in place of the RB. I tried it and WOW...my whole family devoured it. My son can be picky..he couldn't get enough. We usually are all waiting at the table for my daughter to finish her meal a good 20 minutes after we are through and she was the 2nd one done. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you!

This is one of the best pulled pork recipes that I have ever made.  My husband and kids loved this.  Quick and easy in the crick pot and the meat was so juicy and tender.

I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out great!!  I covered the pork roast in root beer and cooked 7 hrs on low in slow cooker.  I used Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce, the original and it turned out great.  I made the Awesome Cole Slaw recipe to go with this!!

I made this 2 nights ago for me and my husband. My husband is an EXTREMELY picky eater, pretty much a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so it was mainly for him. I've never been a huge fan of BBQ sandwiches, but I LOVED this recipe. It was soooo good. The only thing I did slightly different was after draining the root beer it cooked in, I shredded the meat and put the BBQ sauce in, I added a little splash of the root beer to the sauce, and it turned out fantastic. Saw many other pulled pork recipes, but this was the easiest and I'm sure the tastiest!!!

Very Easy and I love easy to make meals. I made up 2 tenderloins and I did add salt, pepper, and garlic salt rub.  Very nice. I would have drained out the root beer an hour earlier and let the BBQ sauce ( I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey  and a mix of Bullseye Tangy) have more time to really soak into the meat. Tomorrow's will probably taste even better. Family Approved.  Goes great with slaw and beans.

I did not have rootbeer, so I used Dr. Pepper. I also added oregano and cracked black pepper. So easy and so delicious! Even my daughter that is not a barbecue fan loved it. I will definitely make this again.

This was a really good recipe.  I made it last night for my husband and youngest son and they devoured it, even though my husband doesn't like anything with BBQ sauce in it.  I was skeptical of making anything in a crock pot since usually everything tastes the same, but this recipe was definitely the exception.  I cooked the pork tenderloin for 8 hours, turning about every hour or so, then drained, shredded and returned to the pot with Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ Sauce for another hour with just a bit of water added to keep it from drying out.  Served on very soft hamburger buns for a great meal.  Next time, I might try toasting the buns so they don't get so soggy.  Thanks so much for sharing, Livie's Mammy!

This was just strange.  The smell of the meat cooking in the root beer all day was very unpleasant.  I thought the root beer would make the meat sweet but it really didn't.  I forced myself to eat it because I hated wasting it!  My husband thought it was fine but I just couldn't get over the root beer taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will not make again.

This was really good. I didn't add the whole bottle of bbq sauce, I added just enough to get the flavor, then people can add what they like on their hamburg buns.

I used the entire botte of A&W root beer as others suggested with the Sweet and Spice Sweet Baby Rays.  To me and my family it was just ok.  I will not make this again and I will stick to my usual recipe for pull pork.

Awesome recipe for pulled pork. Based on the reviews, used more root beer and some vinegar. If you can get your hands on Dinosaur BBQ sauce, use it!!! Freezes well too.

This was a winner! I asked the butcher which cut I should use and the package sis not say but it was a big chunk with no fat. I cut it in half and cooked them for 4-5 hours on high since I was short on time and it was awesome if I don't say so myself.  What I did differently: - I added Coca Cola instead of root beer.  - I also added a few fresh garlic cloves (smashed but still in one piece so I could fish them out when the pork was done) - Added a few chopped green onions  I can't wait to make this again!

My husband and I both loved this recipe! Yummy! We stayed in for NYE last night and I threw this in my crockpot and let it go while we played Wii :). So good we had seconds and today ate all the leftovers while watching football. I used IBC root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I didn't add quite as much bbq sauce as called for so I had a thinner sauce. Delicious! This may become a tradition around here :)

5 stars doesnt cover how much my family loved this! It is great! I tried it in the slow cooker the first time, and I didnt like how it came out. But the second time I didt it on the stove and it was FABUOUS! I simmered it with about 2/3 of a 2 liter of root beer for about 5-6 hours... the meat just fell apart, I barely had to pull it! I use a honey bbq sauce. It is delicious! It is definitely something I will make over and over!

absolutely outstanding and ridiculously easy.  Recipe originally called for a 2# roast, but I used a 4 1/2 # roast and maybe 14oz of rootbeer - there was more than enough.  Great.

I tried this a couple of days ago on a pork roast I needed to use up in the freezer.  It was the BEST pulled pork I've ever made!  I did sprinkle some garlic powder and paprika on top of the pork before I closed the lid.  I know one other reviewer mentioned that the part that wasn't covered with root beer was kind of dry, and I found that to be the case too.  Next time I will completely submerge the pork in root beer.  It was falling apart, extremely moist, and delicious. This will definitely be the only way I make pulled pork in the future.

I made some minor changes: rubbed Boston buttom roast with some seasoning salt, crushed garlic, a bit of vinegar and some cayenne pepper, the end product the best pulled pork ever. I will make this again for the Christmas parties, husband went crazy over this recipe and I only spent under ten dollars and had enough pork for ten servings.

I made this recipe and it was great.  I used coke because its what I had and it turned out good.  the only think that I will do next time is to make sure that the pork is completely covered in liquid, if not the top part is a little dry, but with BBQ sauce you can't really tell.

Perfect and plain recipe.  Add some more sauces/spices to the slow-cooker for more flavor.  Also, I suggest putting the pulled pork on Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of hamburger buns.  DELISH!

This was a great recipe! I couldn't find singles of root beer at my grocery store, so I got a 20 oz. cola instead. I put all of it in and followed the rest of the directions. My boyfriend thought this was a great pulled pork! Thanks!

5 stars for ease and versatility.  But 4 for flavor.  Adds a little flavor but better to plan on adding another sauce.  On the other hand...after having sandwiches one night I used the remaining meat for taco's.  Just added a little taco seasoning and water.

My husband was skeptical, but really enjoyed the slightly sweet flavor that the root beer added to the pork. Thanks for the suggestion!

I used 3lb pork tenderloin, put 1/4 sweet onion & sm bell pepper 2 sm garlic cloves chopped. Sprinkle pork with barbecue seasoning and then placed overtop of veg. Pour 12oz beer over and pour 1/4 of bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce on pork, on low for 4hrs. Drained juices put veg & pork back in along with remaining sauce plus another half a both and cook on med another 1hr. Pork was very tender but too sweet. Next time I'll either use spicier sauce or leave plain & add whatever sauce guest want.

This recipe couldn't have been any easier and turned out fantastic.  I made this for dinner on Halloween for my family and they all loved it.  I didn't use the exact amounts that the recipe called for but other than followed it exactly.  Used slightly more root beer and pork.  Am making this again today for a friend that just had surgery.  This will be in my frequent rotation.

This is excellant! Try using the Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce & it will remind you of the BBQ Sandwiches that you had many years ago at the old "Dog & Suds"! YUM!

After eading all the reviews I decided to try this recipe, really it can't much easier then this. The root beer was different but good. I found tenderloin on sale at the store so it was perfect. I figure which ever BBQ sauce bought will give the flavor of your choice, so if the flavor isn't to your liking try a different sauce the next time. I will definitely be making this again

The flavour of this pork was pretty good (but how can you go wrong with bottled bbq sauce!), and none of the root beer flavour came through.  The reason I gave this dish only 2 stars is that the texture of the pork tenderloin after shredding was completely mushy...this cut of meat was so tender that it had absolutely no texture to it whatsoever.  I may make this again, but will definitely use a cheaper, sturdier cut of meat.

I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then stab it with a fork a few times, as suggested by another commentor.  Since I didn't have a slow cooker, I put it in my oven at 170 for 6.5 hours. (I would suggest going up to 200, since the pork still didn't shred easily)  Shred the pork best I could, added enough BBQ sauce to coat it, and put it back in for an hour.  Took it out and coated it again to serve it.  And yes, it tastes even better the next day!

made with 4lb pork butt, under $10. Delicious, easy and well worth the afternoon of delicious aromas in the house! the butt only took about 5 hours to pull, and 1 hour in sauce! wonderful!  spiced it up with a nice pork rub before slow cooking it, and used simple brown sugar BBQ sauce, and it was delightful!

This was definitely restaurant quality. The only changes I made were that I cooked it with about 1/2 cup of minced onion for extra flavor. I cooked it about 5 1/2 hours in the root beer, drained it, salted it, and then put in 18oz of BBQ sauce and let it simmer an additional 30 min. It was still moist but cooked through this way.

Great! This wasn't as to die for as maybe other recipes that take longer to marinate and have tons of spices, but the ease of this dish definately deserves a high rating. I did let it cook another hour after stirring in the BBQ sauce. Also, since this only has a handfull of ingredients, make sure it's good quality root beer and BBQ sauce--Jack Daniel's is always good sauce.

After eight hours on low, I removed the pork to drain off the fat and root beer (I used a 20 oz. bottle) and to shred it. I almost left it at that because it was so delicious! But dinnertime was still two hours away, and I didn't want it to dry out, so I returned it to the crockpot on low and added a 28 oz. bottle of KC Masterpiece Original barbecue sauce. WOW! This is amazingly good and so easy - I'm sure I'll make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I cooked it in the root beer and drained it.  Then I poured the bbq sauce on and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Let it cook on low for a few hours and it was fantastic!  We froze the leftovers and they also reheated nicely.

I made this for my family and some of the tenants in my building and it was a big hit. I used Sweet baby Rays Honey bbq sauce mixed with a little kc masterpiece honey sauce. I also started with a pork loin center roast that I had on hand

This was excellent.  I did use a generic form of Dr. Pepper 'cause it was what I had on hand, but that was the only change.  The whole family loved it.  I do believe the soda gave it extra flavor as well as made it fall apart tender, and, because you drain off the soda at the end, you don't get all of the sugar (and caffeine in this case).  Even my incredibly picky 3 yo loved it.  fyi, I used jack daniels bbq sauce.  thx for the recipe!

I made this for a family gathering. I had a pork shoulder already so I used that instead of a tenderloin. I followed the recipe exactly except I did put a little garlic on the meat, (whole family is pretty much addicted to garlic). I put it in the crock pot before I went to bed. Let it cook all night and in the morning it was done when I woke up. I drained it,forked it a part and put Sweet Baby Rays barbque sauce on it. My family raved about how it was the best they had ever had, better than their favorite restraunts. I will be using this recipe for years to come. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

My first attempt at doing pulled pork. Although I did not use the tenderloin, heck in these financial times not alot of folks with large families can afford that, I used a pork shoulder and tossed that in the slow cooker instead. My shoulder weights totaled close to the 7 pound range so I tripled the rootbeer. Followed the rest of the directions and oh MY! what a hit with the family! Very good and will do this one again!

So good!! I could not believe how easy this was and my kids who are extremely picky gobbled it all up! I used 4lbs of pork tenderloin and 1 20oz bottle of Root Beer and this came out perfect. Like others we used the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and it was delicious. Thank you for this keeper!

I always make this when I host large gatherings at my house. It is so simple and always turns out so tasty. Make sure you drain the pork well before shredding and do not over shred-- as this can lead to the meat being too mushy. If you use a good quality BBQ sauce it makes a huge difference.

Great flavor! Make sure to use your fave BBQ sauce. It did take a while to shred the pork, but it was definitely worth it!

I made this for a couples game night and our guests couldn't believe this wasn't from a local BBQ restaurant. I used a Boston Butt Roast, poked holes in it and sprinkled it generously with seasoned tenderizer on all sides. I poured a 2 liter bottle of A&W Root Beer over the roast and cooked on low for 8 hours. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. The roast was so tender, I barely needed to shred it! I will be making this again!

Simple and easy recipe for pulled pork.  I did make a few changes, however.  First, I used a much cheaper cut, no need to use an expensive piece of meat. My pork roast was approximately 4 pounds. I filled the slow cooker with A & W Root Beer to about half way up the roast and added minced garlic for addtional flavor. Cooked on low for 10 hours, then shredded. Served on lightly toasted buns and topped with shredded Cheddar cheese. Yummy!!

Never made pulled pork in my life but have always ordered it in my favorite barbecue restaurant.  I've been on a try and make it myself kick and decided this would be a great recipe to try and it absolutely was!  I made it exactly as it stated in the recipe but added honey to the top of the pork when I put it in the slow cooker.  My kids loved it!  We ate it with a coleslaw recipe I found here and it was delicious.  I will be making this again and again.  I love using the slow cooker, I can always make lots and have leftovers, which by the was were just as good as the first serving.  I may try freezing some to see how it holds up.

We made this for my daughters first birthday, we made 28 pounds of pork roast. It was amazing. We let it be in the roaster for a full day on low heat. It just fell off the bone. Enjoy this recipe.

This was easy and delicious.  I did the pork in the root beer and shredded it.  The next day (serving day) I added the BBQ sauce and put it on low for several hours.  It was very tender and got rave reviews

This was excellent. I had a 5 pound pork butt, so I used that and kept the rest of the ingredients the same, adding just a little extra bbq sauce for more moisture. I cooked it on high for 7 hours, (because it was bigger),  and it was cooked perfectly. I know I will be making this again soon! Thanks for posting. :)

I made this exactly to the recipe. It was very tender, but we thought it could have had more flavor--kinda bland without the BBQ sauce.

I combined this recipe with the Southern Pulled Pork and ideas of my own to come up with top notch pulled pork. I added the onions, liquid smoke, and garlic from the Southern recipe then was set to add the root beer to the liquid and realized all I had was diet so I added cream soda instead. It cooked for 7 hrs on high then I poured all of it into a strainer and pulled the pork in the strainer, it just fell apart. Then I put all of it back in the slow cooker and added just enough BBQ sauce to keep it moist and cooked for another hour then served on kaiser rolls. Marvelous.

Made this recipe at work for a bunch of men. They loved it. Sold out. Will definitly make this again. So easy, not alot of ingredients big flavour. Used pork shoulder, cause it was cheaper and made in the oven cause I had to do more than one. Great recipe.

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. I have made it several times and my boyfriend and family loved it. I've made it with both a pork butt shoulder and a pork tenderloin and they were very similar in taste, so whatever is cheaper will work great for you! :) Also, it is fantastic to have dinner ready when I get home from work, so its a popular dish in our household. :) Thanks for the recipe!

The root beer gives the pork a nice tang. I did rub some seasonings on the pork before putting it in the slow cooker and I also poked some holes in the pork so the juice could absorb better.

I've made this several times using whatever cola was in the fridge, diet coke, cherry coke...still delicious.  I do use a pork shoulder rather than a tenderloin.  It is a less expensive cut of meat and just as good in the end.  I've found that it tastes the best with a tangy barbeque sauce rather than a sweet sauce.  The sauce you choose will really make a huge difference.

This recipe is really good.  The pork turned out tender and juicy.  Using the root beer does make your house smell kind of bad.  I think next time I will try cooking it in Mojo Criollo.  I used sticky fingers Carolina sauce and it tasted awesome.  The smell of the root beer is my only complaint.

This was very tasty!! I too used a pork roast instead of loin b/c it was much cheaper. And the meat turned out juicy and tender. Because I enjoy the flavor of the meat I didn't simmer in BBQ like some other reviewers did. (also b/c I didn't have time!!) Instead I mixed some of the juices from the roast, bbq sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, s&p, onion powder and garlic salt in a sauce pan and poured over the meat.  This way you get the great flavor of the meat, but also some of that sweet and tangy sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

4 1/2 stars I am thinking.... very good, but I was hoping more of the rootbeer taste would soak into the meat.  Maybe on a day where I have more time I will make my own BBQ sauce with the rootbeer and brown sugar.  Otherwise this was crazy easy and very tasty.

This was good, flavorful and super easy.  We have a very large slow cooker, so the root beer didn't cover the pork.  The uncovered portion was a little drier and harder to shred, so next time I will turn the meat half way through.

Too easy and good!  Turned out excellent.  The only change I made was I sprinkled the meat with garlic and onion powder. It tastes even better the next day.

So my not-so-smart roommate went to the store and bought cream soda, rather than root beer. Turns, out it was a winner!! I also used a pork shoulder and after 8 hours it absolutey delicious. We used Corky's original mixed with Corky's Apple flavored bbq sauce. I took this to work and everybody asked for the recipe! I may never make bbq on the grill again!

Holy  this was quick, easy and delicious. I used left over pork from the roast I made the night before. I just put the root beer in a skillet and cooked the left over meat in the root beer for 1.5 hours. The meat fell apart and was so tasty. I'll definitely make this when I am looking to impress someone.

This was a hit at my house!  I seasoned my pork shoulder roast with garlic powder, salt peper, montreal seasoning and liquid smoke, then added rootbeer, covered and cooked 7 hrs and then drained and pulled pork, then added barbq sauce and cooked 1 hr. DELISH

I don't think that the root beer added any significant flavor but it did something! This was the most delicious pulled pork recipe and SO easy!  The only think I did was add some salt with the BBQ sauce at the end for a little more flavor.  My husband and kids love it and next time I plan to serve it over stuffed baked potatoes.

This turned out perfect!  We made this recipe several times, with several variations.  We made it with 8 lbs of pork butt and another time with 11 lbs of pork shoulder.  We poured enough root beer into the slow cooker to cover the meat and let it cook overnight.  It turned out moist and flavorful.  We served it at a party with homemade bbq sauce and it was hit!    Thanks for the recipe!

A very, very simple recipe. Take the suggestions of other reviewers - use a pork shoulder blade roast, add a few cloves of garlic to the slow cooker, sprinkle a good deal of salt and pepper on the roast and let it cook for 8 hours. It is amazingly good for a such an easy, easy recipe.

This was such an easy way to make pulled pork!!  I will say I prefer to use pork loin for other recipes, for this I bought a huge pork shoulder at costco. :)  I ended up using a 6+ lb portion, 3 cans diet rootbeer (didn't feel the need for extra sugar) and cooked in my crockpot on High for about 5.5-6 hours.  If I had known how long it would take to pull the pork- I would have left a LOT more time before dinner.   We put this on the Hamburger Buns recipe from this site, and boy was it tasty!  Turned out perfect, and we have enough leftovers for 1-2 more dinners!  THANKS!

I like that it is easy to make.  The taste was a little bland.  I made some cole slaw and it made it much better. I really think the key is the type of BBQ sauce you use. I used a traditional sauce and wished I had used a spicy or sweet one.   You can not taste the root beer at all, so really all you will taste is the sauce.  The pork was VERY tender.   I will make again and use a different sauce!

This was great!  Many thanks to LauraT and Alison Brune for their comments as they helped me tremendously.  A smaller pork tenderloin would not have been enough for my three boys, so I used the pork shoulder (4.5 lbs.) and it was great - even enough for at least one round of leftovers.  Prepping the pot by spraying with a non-stick cooking spray was a great idea and made cleaning a snap.  Great recipe for us busy ladies - just set it and leave for the day!  Thanks!

I am rating this 4 stars because my husband and brother-in-law loved it, and I am not a huge fan of BBQ - so not the best judge for this one. :) It was very easy to make. I placed the 3 lb shoulder roast roast on thick sliced onions and added three peeled cloves of garlic. We used A&W root beer and cooked on low for 3 hours. The meat was very tender and tasty. We added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I will definitely make this again, I'll probably just put some aside sans sauce for me next time.

This was very good.  I coated the meat in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika before putting it in the slow cooker.  It took about 5 hours for a 1.5 pound roast to cook.  Yummy!!

I loved this recipe! I did do a few things to change it though.  I used a boston butt instead of a tenderloin.  I rubbed it withsalt, pepper and montreal seasoning and then added onion, and garlic to the slow cooker.  I used about 4 cans of diet root beer, enough to cover the meat. I cooked it about 3 hours on high and 2 on low and then pulled it apart and then as suggested by others added sweet baby rays sweet and spicy sauce and simmered for about an hour! It was so yummy. Definatly a keeper!

Best Pulled Pork recipe ever! I took the advise of others and used a pork sholder rather then tenderloin and was very happy with the results. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and was happy with it. I didn't change a thing. I believe in trying a recipe just as the writer intended in order to write a true review. This didn't disappoint. This recipe will be a great addition to family and office functions. Thanks for the recipe! I recommend it highly.

I made this for our basketball team's snack bar, it was a big hit.  I made my own "Memphis" style barbeque sauce and served on buns with cole slaw. Everyone loved it!

I have made this almost every weekend for the last month and a half since it is such an easy meal and a huge hit.  I use diet root beer and the meat is so juicy and fantastic.  We also have done it with beef and pork...both are delicious and I have found Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce is the best.  So easy and soooooo good  We have been doubling the recipe and adding a can of diet root beer to the meat once we shred it before adding the bbq sauce.

I used a 5 lb pork shoulder roast and put a single package of onion soup mix on it after I marinated the meat in the root beer overnight. I served it on toasted buttered buns with slaw (cabbage, mayo, barbeque sauce, vinegar and hot sauce to taste). Fabulous meal!

This was very easy and really good!  I used the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, as others had suggested, and it was a great complement to the slight rootbear taste in the pork.  One note -- once I shredded the pork and added the sauce, the meat was quite cool, so I left it in the crock pot on low for about 25 minutes to get it back to temp.

Very good.  I used a much cheaper cut of pork (butt roast), and used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce.  My family loved it, it was a simple, easy meal.

Simple, easy and yummy and I am not even a big BBQ sauce fan! I would use the tenderloin every time since it will give you less fat to deal with. Next time I will make two at a time so we have more leftover. Would also be a great potluck dish to take anywhere as well.

This recipe was easy and great!  I used pork butt instead of tenderloin; in a slow cooker the meat cooks for so long that you can use a less premium cut of meat and still end up with very tender and moist meat.  Also the carbination on the soda helps tenderize the meat.  The pork butt turned out great for a fraction of the cost.  Shred the pork when its warm - I cut it into chucnks and cooked this overnight because I didn't want to overcook it (pork can get gummy and rubbery when cooked for more than 8 hours in a slow cooker).  I refrigerated it while I was at work and it was difficult to shred when it was cold.  I would also suggest using 3-4 pounds of meat and doubling the rest of the ingredients.  This makes pretty small servings otherwise.  Overall, a very easy and inexpensive meal!

Really good and easy! Don't pour the whole bottle on all at once. I added some bit by bit just to coat the shredded meat, then let everyone add more as needed.

This was delicious!!! I used a less expensive cut of pork and de boned it after draining. It was excellent.

A perfect side dish for this one is sweet potato fries.... mmmm mmm mmm.

Easy and good! Made it exactly the way the recipe states using Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce. I highly recommend buying bakery sandwich/sub rolls instead of hamburger buns.

I ended up using carnitas for this recipe as it was very inexpensive and the butcher told me it was essentially cut up pork shoulder. It was delicious,but I used 3.5 pounds of meat and it was WAY too much for our 3 person family. We ate well for days!! I also cut down on the sweet and added more of the tangy as we like our barbecue "Carolina Style". All in all great recipe for a beginning Barbecuer.

So easy!  I used a pork tenderloin, which I agree with previous reviews is too nice of a meat for pulled pork, but it turned out great.  Pork cooked for 7 hours on low and then added the BBQ sauce for a remaining 15-20 minutes.  Good leftovers.  Yum!

This couldn't be easier and it was delicious.  I think I might add some garlic powder next time for a little more flavor, but my husband remarked several times about how good this was.  I served a salad and corn on the cob with it, so it literally took about 10 minutes of my time to make this dinner!

Very good and very easy!  I've made this several times now, and it's very consistent.  I'm always surprised at how this doesn't taste much like the soda it cooks in, but has a nice flavor.  The last time I made this, I used Dr. Pepper and it turned out fine.

Made for supper last night. Fabulous! I put a 2.10pd pork loin in my crockpot on low for 9 hrs. I did put in 2 cans of root beer because I was at work all day and wanted to make sure it didn't get dry. It was so tender and shredded perfectly. Will be making again. Thank You for the recipe!

A bit of advice, make sure you use good quality root beer such as Barg's or A&W.  I used a generic brand and my husband could tell the difference.  Otherwise, this was so easy to make and delicious.  Next time I will try it with a Boston butt as others have suggested.

Even though I "cheated" on the recipe, the idea was still good and I give 5 stars for getting me thinking.  I used a bottle of Fosters. (beer) It was plenty liquid and really tenderized the pork.  When I pulled it out of the slow cooker it came right apart and I tossed a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Rays on top of it and but it in a huge frying pan over the stove.  I was able to get some pieces a little crispy and it was delicious!  Thanks for the jumping off point!

Super easy but only as good as the BBQ sauce you use.  Got rave reviews when I used KC Masterpiece Honey BBQ.  Also, don't shred too fine as it's a little too "mushy."  Leave some chunks.

Made this for a 4th of July BBQ for 60 people.  Followed recipe except substituted pork shoulder (16 lbs.), and it came out wonderfully.  Was a little worried after it cooked for an hour or so and all we could smell in the house was rootbeer and an unpleasant meat smell.  But it went away as soon as we put the bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece) on when it was all pulled apart.  There was not one piece left at the end of the night.

Very easy and tasted great! I slow cooked the pork on low for about 5 hours, drained and shredded it, and then put it back in the slow cooker, and added Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce, turned the cooker down to "keep warm" until dinner (about an hour) I've never done this before, and had no idea how to "pull" pork, so I read some things online and took two forks and just ripped the meat - by the time it came for pulling, the meat was so loose and tender - it was very easy. Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe was so easy. I had to use two pork shoulders because I have such a big family. In a before review they suggested using 2 cups of root beer if there is more meat. This recipe came out delicious!

Can't get much easier than this.  I did add some additional spices on the meat including salt, pepper, and sage.

Definitely will be a do over for my family!

Very good and so easy!  I used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ Sauce.  You can't taste the root beer at all, which I was a little skeptical about before making it.  I will use this again, my husband loved it.

Simple and delicious!  I will keep this one at the front of the recipe box.  My husband loves the meat without the BBQ sauce, and I like it with Sweet Baby Ray's Original Sauce.  Sweet and spicy and hits the spot.
It is very no-fuss and would be great to make when company is over and you don't want to be in the kitchen all evening cooking.

Love this!  So good and so easy too!  I followed the suggestions of some others.  I leave the pork in the crockpot for 3 hours with the rootbeer.  Then I drain it and shred the pork.  I put in back in the crock pot, add the BBQ sauce and let it cook for 1 more hour.  My hubby loves it!

mmmmmm...deliscious! even better the second day. I too drained the rootbeer after several hours, then added a bottle of open pit original barbecue sauce. This works perfect with pork shoulder and is much cheaper than pork tenderloin. Next time Im going to try fresher pork because ours was a little old and I bet it will taste even better!

great recipe, very easy and delicious. my husband told me that its a definite keeper!

my only change is that i poked holes in tenderloin so it could soak up the juices and i rubbed some pepper on the tenderloin before putting in the crock pot.  also, after i took the meat out to drain and shred, i put it back in with the bbq sauce and let it cook for another 30 minutes.

Made this recipe for my sister's baby shower. Used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. It turned out fantastic. The men in my family devoured whatever was left later that night. My husband loved it so much he plans on making it for his firehouse. I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm a vegetarian, so I have to base my reviews on my husband's taste.  As far as the flavor, he gave it 5 stars!  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and he loved it.  The problem he had was in the texture.  I don't know if there's a better way to shred it (mine just fell apart on its own), but it was too fine and stringy.  He referred to it as "cat food".  I thought it looked like something worse, but I'll spare you.  Perhaps a different cut of meat would give you a thicker shred.  If you're used to a stringy pulled pork, this recipe is super easy and delicious!

This was quite tasty! Although Im sure you could probably get away with a cheaper cut of pork, the tenderloin was awfully good. The rootbeer was an unexpected ingredient but it worked really well. For the people who commented on the sweetness, I think that their complaint might be due to the use of a sweet sauce.  We live in the south where we use a vinegar based sauce, so I did not have that problem at all. I recommend Johnny Harris sauce from Savannah, GA if its available in your area. I also salted and peppered the pork before adding the rootbeer, and I think that helped in the end result. Altogether a simple and yummy way to cook BBQ.

This recipe is awesome! It was such a HUGE hit at my superbowl party yesterday. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and it was perfect. Everyone, including myself who typically doesn't like bar b q, couldn't stop raving about it. Noone could believe how easy it was to make either. This recipe is def. going to be a regular in my superbowl menu.

Who knew that root beer was the key to such amazing pulled pork?  FANTASTIC and family approved - especially when served with slaw on top!

Very easy too make, but it was a bit too sweet.  Mine seemed a bit dry so I used more bbq sauce, but then it ended up too sweet.  I will make it again, but tweak it a bit next time.

The pork turned out very tender but my husband and I were not crazy about the flavor. I don't know if it was the root beer or the sauce I used. I will try again with some other liquid and sauce. Great technique though.

I was afraid that root beer might make this too sweet for me, so I used a bottle of Corona and Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce.  Turned out very good.  But the best part for me was the gravy that I made from the juices.  Don't throw out the juice!  Whisk it into a roux and it makes a VERY tasty gravy (using Corona, anyway).  I don't know how the gravy would be if i had started with root beer.

I followed the recipe as is.  I cooked a FROZEN pork tenderloin and a can of root beer for 10 hours.  I added only a handful of chopped onions for flavor.  I shredded the meat and added BBQ sauce just before serving.  Awesome.

I made this recently for a barbecue and I'm glad to say that everyone loved it.  The modifications I made were this:  I used turkey london broil instead of pork; I also cut up an onion, put Chicken Rub on both sides of turkey, stabbed it a few times with a knife, and sealed it in a plastic bag overnight.  Like another reviewer, I also added some b-b-q sauce to the root beer.  At the end of the cooking time, after draining the meat, I added the rest of the b-b-q sauce and continued cooking in the crock pot on low for at least another hour. The shredded turkey meat turned out very flavorful and very tender, and I definitely plan to make this again and again.

Excellent recipe. I used country style ribs that I seasoned up and seared on the stovetop.  Cooked them 6 hours on high, drained the root beer, shredded the meat, added in the BBQ sauce and cooked for 1 1/2 hours longer.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe.  It was very good.  I plan to add my own touches (hot sauce and more seasoning) the next time I make it.  It is quick to prep and tasty.

Made this over the weekend. I followed the recipe using a pork shoulder joint and Heinz 1/2 regular and 1/2 hot & spicy BBQ sauce. It came out perfect and we all wanted more. SOOO easy. Next time I make it, might try adding chopped onion just for more texture.

Recipe worked great!  I actually had a turkey breast tenderloin in the freezer instead of pork.  No one knew!  I used the root beer and it worked great.  My husband does not like bbq sauce so I added some dry rub to the tenderloin when cooking for extra flavor.  It shredded up and was good.

This turned out great! I even used a corona because I didnt have any root beer and it still came out very tasty. I will make this again and maybe add some onions. I will also leave some of the juice in the pot when I add the bbq sauce so it doesnt get too dry. Especially if I am making a large batch for a party.

This is a great recipe.  I used a different cut of pork but it still worked out fabulous.  The only thing I did a little different was leave some of the juice in the mixture and then added the barbeque sauce and let it cook on high for about an hour stirring occasionally.  I turned the heat off and let it sit for awhile so the barbeque sauce would cook into the meat more.  I'll turn it back on about an hour before serving this evening and I'm sure it'll be a hit!

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  It was so simple and easy.  I was throwing a huge BBQ party for my husband's birthday, but didn't want to do any major cooking.  I used a pork rub on the 4 lbs. of tenderloin, put in the slow cooker and went about my day stress-free.  After about 6 hours, it came out perfect.  The pork shredded so easily.  The day of the party, I split it into two batches, using two different BBQ sauce (one hot and spicy, the other sweet and tangy).  I put each batch in a slow cookers, mixed the BBQ (an hour before the party) and it was hot and ready to be served once the party started.  So easy!

This was great. So simple and easy. The root beer had me skeptical.. but in the end it was fantastic. Will definitely make again. For the BBQ sauce I used Bulls Eye rib sauce.

I have made this recipe twice now, and it's  very easy and turns out great.
 
 I make it with two pork Tenderloins, as they typically come in at around 1.2 pounds each.

 I  questioned using Pork Tenderloin vs Pork Shoulder but was  very pleasantly surprised with the end product. It is exceptionally lean, and after 7 or 8 hours on Low it shreds very easily.
 This is about as easy as it gets for a tasty comfort food meal the whole family loves.

 We use Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar sauce with it, but I know sauces are a very personal thing.

  We usually  make nachos with chips, cheese and some sour cream on them, but it also makes a great sandwich or taco too !

This is a hit at every gathering - I never come home with leftovers. Simple to remember, and very easy to make. I occasionally add some diced onion to the root beer  while it's initially cooking for just a little extra flavor.

Rootbeer was good. I also made it with a can of Guinness beer...EVEN BETTER! :) 

For the bbq sauce there is one with Guinness beer flavor added to it. VERY good. Also Mesquite flavor is very nice.

I used a pork shoulder roast. I believe the fat content with this cut keeps the pork very moist. I entirely covered the meat with a and w root beer and left to cook for 10 hours then drained. I shredded and added very little bbq sauce, and put it back on for another hour . I am not a big fan of having pulled pork where the only flavour is bbq sauce. This was a fantastic simple resipe. I sprayed the slow cooker with coconut spray twice and clean up was a breeze.Two very big thumbs up.

Use pork shoulder instead of tenderloin and this is a great formula for a basic pulled pork. Just add seasonings and spices that your family like to finish and it'll be excellent. Also, don't forget to add some liquid smoke.

Super easy recipe! Barely any cleanup. No complaints from anyone. The goodness of this recipe really depends on the quality of the BBQ sauce, so keep that in mind. Thanks so much for sharing!

I am trying all of the different styles of "pulled pork" (Sweet southern ‘Tennessee’ style Pulled Pork, Maple-Mustard East Coast Style Pulled Pork, high vinegar Carolina BBQ, Hawaiian Pulled Pork and Slow Cooker Carnitas) and this is the first. It is an EXCELLENT KEEPER!! Yes, it is sweet which has its place. I let the Crock Pot run over night and finished it in the morning. The only difference I made was to cut it down to a 2 1/2 pound, bone-in, pork shoulder roast and dumped in 16 oz of A&W Root-beer. It is really inexpensive such that the Sweet Baby Ray Sweet and Spicy sauce cost almost as much as the meat.

Me and my wife love this, we do add enough root beer to make sure it is completely covered, season the pork before putting in the cooker and save 1 cup of the juices after cooking to mix with the bbq sauce, this is saved to our favorites because it’s so good and easy to make.

I have been making this for 5+ years and figured it was time I should leave a review! This is an absolute staple in my house! I don't change anything and it's 5 stars! Only advice is to use a good BBQ sauce bc you can ruin it with a cheap flavorless one. Soooooo good

This was so delicious! I used 3.6 lb. Boston Butt. I cooked it on high 7 hours, drained the root beer, shredded the pork, then added a bottle of Rumboggies Sweet Hickory BBQ sauce, and cooked on low 1 more hour. So amazing!  I usually just cook pulled pork like this but use a bottle of BBQ sauce only. The root beer will be the first ingredient from now on. I made homemade coleslaw and added it to my pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun.

It was delicious. I usually put clove pieces in my pork but I sprinkled a little ground clove on after soda. So easy and mouthwatering.  Thank you for such an easy recipe.

This needs more than just root beer. I threw in cumin, salt, pepper and garlic. Sprinkled some cayenne pepper before adding the bbq sauce and cooking it for an extra hour on low. Turned out well.

I made this tonight for my family of 5 and it was SO DELICIOUS!! It would’ve been perfect as is, but I did go with another reviewers method and added, salt, pepper & dried minced onion. This one is definitely going in my recipe collection!

I was looking for a simple pulled pork recipe where I could improvise with what I had on hand and this fit the bill.  This is by far the easiest recipe ever!  And it was absolutely delicious.  I used Dr. Pepper instead of root beer, a 2.5 lb boston butt instead of a tenderloin,  one sliced sweet onion and a little bbq dry rub seasoning on the pork.

Gross.   Like many reviewers said it tasted like meat soaked in soda.  I tried doctoring it with Sweet Baby Ray's and even some onion  but it still had that soda pop aftertaste.  Finally gave it to my cats.

This is one of my favorite meals at any time of the day. Instead of root beer I use real beer. If you’re not using Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce than you’re doing it wrong.

I think I'm the only one on here that follows the recipe just as directed. I followed it as is and it came out absolutely delicious. I don't like barbeque sauce so this recipe is perfect cause you can take some out and mix some in if that's what you like! Definitely will make this again!! Sue

Very easy to make recipe and the pork came out very tender.  Will definitely do again.  The recipe says it takes about 8 hours, and I was worried because I forgot to defrost my meat before tossing it in .  I put it on the 10 hour setting to make up for it being frozen.  It was cooked in 8 hours anyway.  And this was enough to feed 8 people with leftovers.

Use a pork shoulder, way cheaper and the end result is still delicious.  I usually sear the roast before popping it in the slow cooker, bit it turns out great even if you don't.  this is the only way I make pulled pork now.

I made this in my slow cooker and it cooked 10 hours.  I came home and added the BBQ sauce and I thought it turned out very good.  I am not a huge BBQ person and this one wasn't too bad and very simple.  I did add onions and garlic to it.

Didn’t find that the root beer added anything to the pork.the lack of actually seasoning the meat left it tasting bland and boring, even with the bbq sauce and root beer.

I followed the advice in a lot of reviews. Used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin, with salt and pepper and root beer on low 6 hours. Then drained, shredded, added homemade bbq sauce, and cooked on low 1 hour. Very good but needs some spices, I need to experiment. Very very tender.

Delicious, but took my slow cooker longer than 7 hours on low. If keeping on low, I’ll allow for closer to 10 hours next time. Root beer and sweet baby ray’s sweet and spicy sauce were great.

Pork loin and tenderloin are poor choices for pulled pork, they are too lean and will come out dry. I had a pork loin in my freezer and tried it in my crock pot and it was dry. I usually smoke but did not have the 8-9 hours so I used the crock pot. I need to do pulled pork for my office on Wednesday and bought two butt haves that I am going to put on Tuesday morning.

This recipe was so delicious.  I don't use a slow cooker that often as the food sometimes comes out a little dry.  Not this one!!  We were having a New Year's party so I used two 4lb. pork shoulder picnic roasts.  I covered the meat with 2L of A&W root beer and cooked it on high for about 4 hours then turned it down to low for another 2 hours.  After that I pulled out the roasts and drained all the root  beer.  We removed the bone & large pieces of fat, shredded the meat (it just fell apart), and mixed in  one and half bottles of Heinz Bold & Spicy BBQ sauce.  I let the meat slow cook on low for a couple more hours then added the last half bottle of BBQ sauce and onion flakes (for a bit of extra flavour) and turned the slow cooker to warm until everyone was ready to eat.  It was a big hit with everyone.  Hardly anything was left.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this twice and both times the meat was still tough after 10 hours, and the flavor was blah. Everyone was adding sauces and peppers to their sandwiches to flavor it up.

My husband raved about this, and then I told him the secret ingredient was root beer.  He would have it every day!

We used beer instead of root beer which seemed too sweet but otherwise followed the recipe and it worked perfectly.  The pork shredded nicely and we liked the lack of fat.

I have made this several times; it's consistently a hit. (Always braise meat before cooking in a crock pot or roasting in oven) Have tried with a variety of BBQ sauces, comes out great!

I would recommend a different cut of meat. I have baked tenderloin in the oven and it comes out awesome, this came out much drier than I was expecting pulled pork to be.

Made it, loved it.  However I also changed it.  Pork Tenderloin is just too lean to make this dish successful.  I used a traditional pork butt, about 4 lbs.  I added nothing to the recipe except the root beer it called for.  When it was done the house smelled really good.  When I took it out of the slow cooker, the bone fell away, the fat was easily removed and I had beautiful, beautiful and tasty meat in front of me.  I have one rule of thumb when it comes to cooking meat and that is, "FAT AND FLAVOR BOTH START WITH A 'F'".

This was only ok for us. We all thought it was missing seasoning and much prefer the other recipes we have made. It was very simple and very easy to make, though. And for that reason alone I would recommend it in a pinch but I would also suggest adding some herbs and pepper.

Ok so here’s the deal - I made a bunch of changes to the recipe but kept the same idea. First, I used a pork butt since it was a whole lot cheaper for the amount I was making. I also ended up with a 7lb roast, but didn’t have to adjust the cook time. With the larger roast I used 2 bottles of root beer, then a larger bottle of sauce (same one previous reviewers used) and took the whole crockpot to work for a potluck. I came home with an empty crock and so many compliments! I’ll definitely be making this again!

I've been making it this way for years, I just buy a bottle of regular root beer, usually A&W, pour it over the top almost to the top of the pot, plug it in and cook it on low for approximately seven hours it comes right off the bone. I buy a picnic roast,  drain it shred it ,add a little of your favorite bbq sauce, buy slider rolls and that's it! comes out consistently good every time.

This recipe makes completely flavorless meat. Obviously it needs to be buried in BBQ sauce to be edible. I turned my leftovers into tacos, after I seasoned the heck out of it. It did pull ok, but the root beer added nothing to it.

I made it exactly as described and it was a hit! I finished it off with a Hickery BBQ sauce it was amazing. The pork flavouring was wonderful and it pulled apart incredibly easily.

We like this simple recipe and I only make one change. I always add enough root beer to cover the meat- turns out too dry for our tastes otherwise.

I used half a 4 lb tenderloin and expected the meat to be a bit juicy and shred easily. It was dry and didn't shred easily so I believe there was a hiccup somewhere in my cooking. I cooked it in the root beer then drained it and added the barbecue sauce and meat back into the slow cooker. It was real good but I might cover the meat in root beer next time to see if that makes it any more juicy. Held up real nice in the fridge though, make some homemade mac and cheese and add this on top and you get a delicious meal.

Wow! Did this with Pork shoulder (4lb) and two bottles of root beer at slow cook for 10 hours.  Then drained and re-heated on stove with bbq sauce (kinders) and made sandwiches with this and coleslaw.  Forget about it:) TOO GOOD!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and we loved it. I probably should have cut the recipe in half since there's just the two of us (we had a bit too many leftovers), but I will definitely make it again.

I've been making pulled pork like this for years. It is the perfect recipe! Especially when you add the sweet hawaiian rolls to put it on! Some of my friends prefer using Dr. Pepper instead of the Root Beer, but to me, it's all about that Root Beer!

I had a 5.45 pound bone in pork roast I cooked on high for five hours with four onions and one can of root beer and it was amazing. All of our kids loved it on Hawaiian rolls and they added their own bbq sauce to their individual sandwiches. I wish In retrospect I had cooked it on low but I was not anticipating being gone for as long as I was, so it cooked longer than necessary. It was delicious anyway and fell apart easily. Delicious! I gave it five stars for simplicity and palatability for kids ages 10-22 as well as being delicious despite leaving it too long on high in a crock pot.

it was great and easy. Nice sweet and tender. (used pork tenderloin) The thing to be taken here is that it is simple to tenderize and cook flavorful meals like this. I intend to try variations of this recipe adding garlic and onions. My two favorite  flavors I also cook pulled chicken the same way.

Simple to make and tasty. I probably won't make it again soon due to high sugar content (sugar and protein both about 20 grams).

I bought about 9 lbs of pork roasts (6 small roasts) and we slow roasted them on the Traeger smoker with a rub.  After they cooked about 9 hours, we shredded the meat and put it into the crockpot with a bottle of root beer and the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce (recipe from this site) and let it cook a couple hours.  HOLY MOLY!  DELICIOUS!

This was the perfect dish to prepare for a recent potluck that was held after work. It was very easy to prepare and was delicious! I included slider buns so that many could have it as a ‘sandwich” or on the side. Every bit of it was eaten and enjoyed! I will make this dish again!

Super simple: easy prep, easy cleanup.  I paired this with the “Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce” on this site, and the flavor was great.  I may try seasoning the meat a little more next time, and cooking a little longer, but no complaints!

I will definitely make this again.  After reading the reviews, I used a 4 pound pork butt, seasoned it with Montreal Steak seasoning (salt & pepper would be fine), added 12 oz Root Beer (Kroger brand), and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  i put  the crock in the refrigerator  for several hours.  Before I went to bed, I put the  crock in the crockpot and turned it on low.  When I got up this morning, the roast was just falling apart.  I  drained off the root beer, forked the pork apart and put  it back in the crock pot with a bottle of Kroger KC style BBQ sauce.  I kept it on warm all morning, until noon.  It was a big hit.  People had seconds!    Next time I will bring  those  King's Hawaiian dinner rolls or slider rolls.  That would have been a better sized roll than a hamburger bun (for our group)  Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

And, no, it did not smell like root beer this morning when I pulled the meat apart.

6/7/2018  -- I made this for another pot luck.  This time I substituted beef broth (made with bouillon granules & water, because that's what I had on hand) for the root beer.  I still used the 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  I couldn't tell the difference in the taste between beef broth and root beer.  I think 12 oz of the liquid of your choice works.  It was a hit (again).  This is a very simple, but delicious thing to do with a pork roast.  Again I heard, "who brought the BBQ?"

This is a go-to recipe for my family. I serve it topped with Sweet Restaurant Slaw (allrecipe by Sandi Johnson) and my family all takes seconds each time. Both are easy recipes- very low prep time for a delicious meal waiting for you at the end of the day.

While the meat was super tender (and it should be using a tenderloin!), the flavor was a little off. I’m not sure if the sugar from the root beer started to burn or otherwise turn in flavor from the heat, but it tasted like I’d expect it to taste if I’d used diet root beer - like some strange chemicals were flavoring it - but I used a full sugar can of A&W.

Amazing!  Doesn’t get easier than this - hardest part is remembering to put the thing in before you leave for work!  Any non-diet soda works if you don’t have root beer.  Ginger ale is great.  I tried 6 hrs on high with Ginger Ale and it came out amazing.  At the end I usually take it out, scrape off the fat, shred it just by pulling it apart on a plate with two large forks, drain the slow cooker, then put the shredded meat back in with about a cup of bbq sauce, mix well, and slow cook another 30 min on high.  Comes out so delicious.

Happened to have a bottle of root beer so gave this recipe a go. I was amazed at how easy it was and that it turned out so well. My tip: Start shredding pork after about 5 hours so the flavors are more thoroughly dispersed. 
Unfortunately I won't be purchasing root beer in the future as I won't use products with high fructose corn syrup so if you have a suggestion for an alternative it would be great!

This was good, but too sweet for me. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and minced onion. After it was done and I added the barbeque sauce, I also added some Frank's Red Hot.

I didn’t use a full 18 oz barbecue sauce. I used Jack Daniel’s barbecue sauce probably about 12 oz. not the full bottle. I’m very impressed! I cooked on high for 4 hrs then low for 2. The last two hours I noticed the liquid really became absorbed. We loved it it’s very sweet and tasty! Good recipe!

Very bland. I'm not one that covers my food in BBQ sauce, (or any sauce) and this was so plain. I had to season and spice at the very end to make it not taste like hot cardboard! 2 stars because the ease of the crockpot and the doneness of the loin was good. I didn't have to think about cooking at the end of a long day. 
Won't be making this one again.

I'm still new to the cooking game so this easy, few ingredient recipe looked like a safe try. Well let me tell you! It was SO delicious! The one thing I took from comments was an hour before it was ready I drained it, pulled it, and added the bbq sauce for the last hour in the slow cooker. Served it w buns and Cole slaw. I think my boyfriend loves me more for this one and I will definitely make this again!!

This was SO simple and SO good.  I put in 2 cans of root beer and a cup of chicken broth to cover...plus a few garlic cloves.  I started it on High for an hour and then on Low for 8 hours and it came out perfect for a 4 pound butt.  Very moist, it shredded easily.

I cooked 4 pounds of this and had to turn it up to high after 4 hours to ensure it would be done on time. I would recommend starting it on high and seeing how things looks half way through.

This was a simple, yet delicious recipe. I followed every step and used a pork tenderloin that I found on sale for less than $4. The only thing that I did in addition to the prep as listed, which I do with most meat, was to season the pork with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder, then placed in zip lock bags overnight.  My entire family enjoyed this and I will definitely make again.

This is delicious!! The pork loin was only $1.75 a pound and very lean. Popped it in the crockpot and forget about it ?? That part. Great for Monday thru Friday coming home from work. It’s a keeper for sure ????

Very easy to make and great tasting.  Like some other reviews say, you don't need to use pork loin for this recipe.  You can use a cheaper cut and it will still turn out very good.  Use a BBQ sauce that you like, I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce.

I’ve made this a few times now and it’s certainly a Family favorite. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because it asks for pork tenderloin, I find that if you use tenderloin it takes on way too much of the root beer flavor. I prefer a pork loin. It takes on just enough flavor and is still super tender from the slow cooking. YUMMM

while i love the base idea of this and the sweetness obtained from the soda, do yourself a favor (or flavor!) and give the meat a good rub down with some spices! onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt & pepper at the very least. and cook with a huge pile of onions which I shred with the meat...very very tasty!

Nothing special about this recipe. Made it according to the directions, but used pork shoulder roast. Couldn't taste the root beer,  which some people complained about. If it weren't for the BBQ sauce, it wouldn't  have had much flavor.

Great!  Very simple.  It does really depend on the sauce you use at the end.  I usually go with Sweet Baby Rays (the original is my favorite, but the hickory and brown sugar is good as well).

Can substitute root beer with Dr Pepper or similar if needed.

This is so great! I made this about a month ago with 2lbs of pork tenderloin, and first rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic then put it in with the root beer as well as a chopped onion. After cooking for 6-7 hours, I removed the meat and drained the slow cooker. I then shredded the meat, put it back in the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and warmed it on Warm mode for a little while until we were ready.

I'm making this again tonight with a 4lb pork shoulder, and using a can of beer instead of root beer (suggested by a friend) so we will see how that is!

Made it for a family gathering, using two pork loins. (1 package) I would say it fed about ten people.  If you have hardy eaters, i would use four (individual) pork loins- (2 packages.). Very easy to make, and turned out great.

OMG, we just had the most delicious pulled pork. I did make some changes though. 
1. Bought the butt roast mean
2. Added one onion minces to the crock pot 
3. Added BBQ pulled pork seasoning mix to the crock pot
4. Used the Best  Root Beer
5. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce

Served on toasted buns and coleslaw on the buns as well with pulled pork.

Served with Baked  french fries and coleslaw (recipes from this website)
Everything was simply delicious!

The pork came out more mushy than shredded. Do not use tenderloin.

Excellent Simple Recipe. Tender,easy to shred,great taste.
I didn't have root beer and was so disappointed as I had bought a pork shoulder  really cheap on sale and found this recipe. I found a bottle of ginger beer I had ,so i used that. Also rubbed the pork shoulder with a onion soup mix packet and some garlic powder. Cooked on high 2 hrs,then low 4 hrs,drained all the fat off and cut up and shredded ,then poured over Uncle Rays BBQ sauce and cooked another 1hr on low.
So yummy ,could hardly wait to eat it. Served with a mashed sweet potato , pepper squash,and coleslaw.
Great dinner.

This is the only way I make pulled pork anymore.  I always use a pork shoulder cut instead of pork tenderloin, and I’ve done both boneless or bone-in.  I also always use Sweet Baby Ray’s original bbq sauce.  I’ve served this to both just family as well as large gatherings, and everyone raves about it.  Really great on Hawaiian rolls.  Leftovers are just as good.

I've done pulled pork before but never with root beer. It was incredible. So very tender and tasty.  Everyone at our vacation beach house was blown away.

Ok so I made this and followed the recipe exactly. Or at least I thought so... it wasn't as magical as I had hoped. My pork was not super fall apart tender by any means. Pulled pork was more like tear apart pork. Oh well. The flavour was good and that's what really matters. But I think I'll try another recipe next time.

Easy, pleasy delicious pulled pork!  No time to go to the grocery and needed a slow cooker recipe for a long day at work,  I was looking for a way to use up some pork tenderloin from the freezer.  This was delicious!  I used an adult root beer I had in the fridge, and added some onion to the mix.  Definite do over, thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought the rootbeer would add a nice flavour to the pork, never noticed any flavour from it whatsoever, and I bought a high end rootbeer, maybe the cheaper stuff would have been better. Very disappointed. Thank goodness for the BBQ Sauce.

While I like root beer, I really did not like the flavor it gave the pork.  It also had a lot of liquid that I had to strain.   I think the final result depends on the sauce you add.

This is a great simple recipe.   The one modification I made was I used an instant pot on high pressure for 100 min on a normal meat/stew setting.   It came out great!

I live this easy recipe. I used a 4lb pork roast. Kosher salt and pepper rub and injected it with chicken stock. Cooked on high heat to start and finished on low heat for 5 hours. Shredded the roast with Bear Claws and added two small bottles of Bulls Eye barbecue sauce, cooking on low for one more hour. It came out fantastic. Thank you AllRecipes.com (and several tips from reviewers).

I love making this recipe in my VitaClay multi-cooker! It makes the beef so tender and juicy, and only takes 2-3 hours (depending on size). The texture and taste are great, but less so when I made it for longer hours in a different slow cooker. It seals up and holds all the juices in. So good!

I changed things up just slightly - my local grocery store had an abundance of picnic roast at a great price so I picked one up. Put some salt pepper and garlic on one side of the roast(4lbs) and put 2 cups of a&w root beer in and then when my hubby got home around the 3 hour cooking mark he added another 2 cups - not sure if this made a difference or not but he always meddles in my cooking. After letting it cook on low for 6 hours I checked up on it and falling apart so I drained it and added 1 bottle of sweet baby rays and let it cook for another 1 hour on low. It tastes absolutely phenomenal. It didn't need the extra cooking time at all but after reading previous reviews I decided to give it a try. Melt in your mouth super yummy pulled pork. SO easy! Will definitely be volunteering to bring this dish over to any potlucks !!

give it a 3.5. actually it would have suited our taste with about half to 2/3 the sauce, but for the ease of prep it is a winner.

Definitely  quick to put together and easy!  We found it a little too sweet  and I raised the temperature to high for the last two hours since I planned on serving it in seven hours.  However, the next day the flavor was much improved as the barbeque sauce had a chance to settle in.  I would suggest making this the day before!

It turned out fantastic. However I used Dr. Pepper versus Root Beer. Not a big fan of Root Beer.

I'll definitely make this one again!!  I followed recipe almost exactly.  The only thing different was that I didn't use as much barbecue sauce and that was actually an accident.  The bottle was dark and I couldn't tell how much I was dumping in and, as it turned out  it was probably only about a little over half of what was requested in the recipe.  It was perfect though!  Will "have that accident" the next time I make it also.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It just couldn't be any easier.

Loved this recipe. The tenderloin was tender and tasty. I didn't have to use a fatty cut of meat, plus I used diet root beer. Very easy to make.

This is so easy and tasted great. You can taste a hint of root beer. But that could be because the only root beer I had was NOT YOUR FATHERS ROOTBEER  (alcoholic) Everyone loved it.

I've made it this way for years. Used different cuts of pork. It always comes out awesome and everyone I know loves it. I started using A&W but switched to Dr. Pepper for the last few batches. Also went with a hickory BBQ sauce. The sauce makes all the difference. You can't make this wrong. Lol

So one of my college boyfriends was so proud of himself for being able to make pulled pork, like he thought he it made him a gourmet chef. The first time I made this recipe I was like “oh you just put some root beer and pork in a slow cooker. That guy was an idiot.”

brilliant, simple, delicious recipe. It is great as-is but there are so many possibilities to tweak it. I used a pork butt roast, rubbed it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and sauteed all that with no oil in the pressure cooker to give a bit of crispy coating. I then added a cup of chicken broth (actually 4 boullion cubes with a cup or so of water), and a bit of liquid smoke. The pressure cooker (Instant Pot in my case) gives the same tenderness in 2-3 hours. Just mix the sauce in at the end.

Followed recipe as it was, but the only singleton root beer bottle I could find was 26 oz so I used all of it. Even when using a pork tenderloin it came out really tender. I mixed it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and put on toasted onion buns. It tasted really good, and I hate pulled pork, but I had to something with the tenderloin.

Also, I recommend dipping it into garlic aioli.

Used pork tenderloin, 4.45 lbs. (we like pulled pork!) used Root Beer. Rubbed tenderloin with brown sugar, onion salt, other spices private recipe mixture. Cooked in slow cooker on LOW. Reserved all liquid to add back in: ended up using about half of it to keep pork moist. Meat pulled just fine after 7 hours of cooking in crock pot. Added splash of apple vinegar, half of reserved liquid and red pepper flakes and set out for dinner, with several types of sauce to choose from. I like vinegary, mustard sauces, hubby and son likes sweet and tangy BBQ sauces. Fix your plate, sauce the way you like it, and chow down! It was, and is, very very good. I made sure the meat was 90% submerged during cooking to retain moisture and that seemed to do the trick. Yes, it came out drier than when I use Butt or Shoulder, but the flavor is quite delicious. Would make again, exactly the same. Highly recommended.

This recipe was good, simple, and above all, super easy to made.  The pulled pork was good, but my husband wasn't raving about it the way he raved about some other recipes. However, it was good enough that I'll keep this one in my back pocket to make again during a busy week.

This is a great recipe!  I used 1/2 of a whole butt which weighed 4 lbs. so I used more root beer and put a dry rub on it, but those are the only changes.  Because of its size, it required a longer time in the crock pot.  It was my first pulled pork recipe I've ever used and I won't change a thing.  I do want to share with you though, that I was found an easy way to shred it.  If you have a standing mixer, use your normal paddle accessory, cut off chunks of the meat while still warm and start mixing on low.  Gradually increase the speed.  Within two minutes tops you have the best shredding job with no muss or fuss.

This is my favorite pulled pork recipe.  It's great because it is so simple to do.  I add a few dashes of Liquid Smoke to mine to give it just a little kick of smoky flavor.  You have to make sure you let it cook long enough or it won't pull apart.  My husband thinks it is a little dry but I think with more barbecue sauce mixed in, it's great.

It's okay. Needs fat, sorry guys. Tenderloin is NOT the way to go, it does exactly what you think it will do without enough fat: it gets dry. The root beer was an interesting touch, I might use it again for another pulled pork recipe.

I used pork tenderloin as it was $1.99 per pound at my aldi's.  It was a little over 8 pounds. I used 2 cans of root beer. Made for a BBQ crowd. Unfortunately, my fiance got this going and added the root beer and BBQ sauce all at once in the beginning. It came out tender and shredded easily but since the sauce was diluted, we drained and then added one whatever BBQ sauce we had left which was only about 9 more ounces. Would have been perfect if followed the directions right! But even worth the mess up is still 5 stars. I think next time I will do the whole thing lol, and also rub the meat with garlic powder and spices before adding to the crock pot.

Excellent 
My family prefers seasoned food, therefore, I added salt, black pepper, and garlic powder to the meat before placing in the slow cooker.  I used equal parts of root beer soda and water.

8 hrs in slow cooker (low setting).  Drained the liquid and shredded the pork.  Added Bbq sauce and cooked another hour.

Served on toasted buns

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a pork butt.   It was so easy to make and everyone loved it, especially my grand-kids!   The pork was mild enough for the kids and the adults just topped off their sandwich with a little spicy BBQ sauce.

So embarrassingly easy, I laughed when asked for the recipe.  I did trim the tenderloin well before starting.

So easy and very tasty! My husband said he doesn't usually like pulled pork, however he loves this one and asked me to make it again! Great dish to bring to a pot luck or a gathering. I used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce.

If you like sweet BBQ, then I would recommend this recipe. I, however, am not a fan of sweet BBQ. I followed the recipe almost word for word: I marinated the tenderloin overnight in A&W root beer, and though many gatherers enjoyed it (crock pot was empty using 8lbs) I prefer using beer instead. All-in-all, very simple , easy to follow recipe and give it a go, you may just love it.

The taste was really good but I'm not sure I care for the texture. I think I need to work on shredding techniques.    It also had a slightly unpleasant smell while cooking.

It is an okay recipe. I found it was missing that "zing" . Perhaps a little bland but definitely edible.

Made this on a Friday and my family can't stop asking for mom. While you can make sliders or sandwiches with it, the most popular dish so far is pulled pork nachos with your favorite nacho cheese, Stubb's BBQ sauce on the pulled pork and Juanita's Tortilla Chips. Loved every bite.

Wow! This was good! And one of the easiest meals I've ever made! I followed the recipe except I used a 4lb shoulder rather than the pricey tenderloin. I slow cooked it with two bottles of root beer for 7 hours (rotating the meat about three times while it was cooking), drained it, shredded it with a fork (I easily took out the big pieces of fat at this point), put it back in the slow cooker with 2 cups of Sweet Baby Ray's original barbecue sauce and turned it on low for another hour before serving it. I must say that the first seven hours that the root beer and pork were simmering, I HATED how it smelled. Maybe that's just what pork smells like (I don't cook pork very often), but rest assured, the barbecue sauce makes the magic happen. I will definitely be making this again!!

We made this recipe almost exactly as written.  We left the pork in longer than called for (10 hours, instead of 7), as it cooked overnight and we didn't get up early to finish cooking it.  

At 10 hours, after shredding the pork, we drained the liquid from the slow cooker and added "Trader Joe's Bold & Smoky Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce" to the shredded pork in the slow cooker.  We mixed in the sauce thoroughly, and then let the shredded pork cook on low another hour, to help incorporate the BBQ sauce.  It was delicious!

I make this very often. I don't like to cook much, so I like crockpot recipes  (as long as it doesn't take an hr to prepare lol).  This is easy and very tasty. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes bbq pulled pork and doesn't like to do much cooking.

Great recipe- winner every time. The reason I'm knocking off a star is because I would never use a pork tenderloin for this. Use a shoulder or another cheaper cut- between cooking in soda and the long cook time, it will be just as tender, moist and juice. I usually use a good sized shoulder (can never find smaller ones) and use an entire 2 liter bottle of root beer. I dislike root beer, but the meat does not end up tasting like the drink after you drain the soda out. I usually use Sweet Baby Ray's Hot & Spicy (it's not really hot & spicy at all for my taste) BBQ sauce with a glug or two from another flavored BBQ sauce I have on hand or sometimes a little hot sauce. I serve this on hamburger buns with optional cheese and coleslaw. The slaw is a great addition to the sandwich- gives it a nice fresh crunch. Sometimes I'll also rub the shoulder with salt, pepper and any other on-hand spices like garlic power or onion powder before I drop it in the slow cooker. A good tip for mess-free cleanup (the sugary soda and BBQ sauce is a real hassle to scrub out of the slow cooker) is to use a plastic slow cooker liner. Once dinner is done and leftovers are packed, you just pull out the liner and toss in the garbage. Cleanup all done!

I don't think there was anything special about this. It was good, but pretty one note, and I couldn't taste the root beer.

This was good, but meat using a tenderloin meat was too tough.  I would try a Boston butt next time for a meat that pulls apart easier.

I made it with the tenderloin as stated but it was not as tender as I expected for the price.  But the flavor was awesome! Next time I will try the shoulder cut!

I should have been skeptical of any recipe with so few ingredients.  I switched the tenderloin for pork shoulder as many others did.  I also added some Grill mates Applewood pork seasoning to add some added flavor. Was a hit with the family.

Soooo good!! Used a pork butt because it's so much cheaper and seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic and paprika before I but it in the crock pot! Everyone loved it!! I made it with the Texas Slaw from this site and it went well together.

Pretty good!  I used a 5 LB pork loin with one can of root beer, lots of onion powder & some liquid smoke in the crock pot...adding a little water until the meat was covered.  I cooked on low for 10 hours...nice texture, mild flavor, easily shredded without being mushy.  Added light amount of BBQ sauce (you can always add more according to flavor) and put thin layer of pork mixture on small baking sheet.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes to crisp the BBQ up a little.  Kids ate it without complaints....froze the rest in small freezer bags for easy weeknight meals.

I really do advise against slow cooking pork tenderloin. Pork shoulder is cheaper and works far better, as it has more fat and connective tissue than the tenderloin

Turned out great ... family loves it.  I made as recipe, but once I drained and shredded the pork, I returned the pork to slow cooker, added the BBQ sauce, and then cooked on low for another hour.  Served on artisan buns from Costco and a healthy salad, I would definitely make again.

This recipe saved my life!I have a heavy work load. I can't show up to a party empty handed, but I need time to prepare food.  This took no more than 7 minutes combined of my actual prep time. This is perfect under $20 and really amazing! Just do it!

This was AMAZING! I only deviated from the recipe a little, taking the advice of a couple of reviewers. I used a 2 lb tenderloin and poked holes in it all over. Then, I rubbed fresh ground pepper, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder all over it. I put the meat in the slow cooker with 16 oz root beer and cooked on low for 7 hours, then drained the meat. I shredded the meat in the crock pot, poured about 28 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce over it, and cooked on low for another hour and served it on toasted butter buns. YUM! I was told by many that it was the best pulled pork they'd ever had! Word of advice...do NOT use a cheap BBQ sauce, like Kraft.

This was delicious (& super easy)!!  Cooked about 2 1/2 lbs for about 7hrs on low.  Tenderloin had a smokey flavor - due to the Root Beer??   Will definitely make again!!

This was very good & I would make it again.  I used the pulled BBQ on top of a large salad served with more BBQ sauce.  It is.very versatile, and I have enough leftover to have sandwiches too.

Made this a couple of times. This time I had some of the "Not Your Dads Root Beer." With the stronger root beer flavor of NYDRB, the flavor carried over with the BBQ sauce. Turned out really good.

I do not normally leave reviews but Holy oinker Batman! The grocery store I went to did not have unseasoned tenderloin so I used a 4# pork shoulder and prepared it as directed. For my sauce I used a nice smoky Hickory combined with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey and Sweet and Spicy (I had planned on only the hickory but it made so much I had to go to my BBQ meatballs reserve sauce). I used a 20 oz bottle of root beer which didn't completely cover the meat so I put it in the crockpot fat side up. I live alone so my plan was to eat some then freeze the rest. Ha! I ate it for breakfast (in omelets with roasted peppers and onions), lunch (on buns either hot or cold, sometimes Carolina style, sometimes not) and for dinner (sometimes on buns sometimes not, sometimes with peppers and sometimes with coleslaw). Once I was done eating nothing but pulled pork for days, I had to stop myself from making another one. I have never found a recipe that was so simple and yet so delicious.

I don't have a slow cooker, so I cooked in cast iron pan with lid on stovetop at low temp--- two pork loin pieces totaling 2.25 lbs for 3.75 hours.  Used 3 cans of root beer.  For last 1/2 hour, I scooped out some of the root beer, broke the meat into several large pieces and poured in the bbq sauce to simmer a bit longer.  Was very good!

Delicious! I poked holes in the tenderloin with a fork so the root beer could soak in like other people suggested. I sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper as well, cooked on low 6 hours, flipped half way and than I mixed in sweet baby rays! Yummy!

Delicious with the root beer. Very tender and great flavor! A big hit with my family. I also did the root beer with boneless  pork ribs and it was fantastic.

This slow cooker pork turned out delicious! Preparation was super simple and my family loved it! None of it went to waste. Great on bread as a sandwich or even just by itself. I will be making this again soon!

The secret is in the sauce, and how much you use. Root beer was a nice touch.

Delicious!  I used a Picnic Shoulder Butt, FAT SIDE UP, and then  discarded the excess fat before pulling the meat apart.
In my opinion, you ruin the meat when you put in all that BBQ sauce.  You also have no other option except BBQ when you do that.  I just added the garlic, salt and pepper ( and a little Cavender's Greek seasoning).  We had pork carnitas one night, BBQ nachos another night,  BBQ sandwiches another night, then pork tacos for lunch....so many different options if you don't douse it in the sauce.   You can always add the BBQ sauce later.

This recipe gets a 3 from mixed because we have mixed review from my house. I thought it was way too sweet, but my husband loved it. (He also liked being able to drink the rest of the root beer.) Since I'm the cook, and since the root beer doesn't add anything healthful, I won't be making this again.

We, my husband and I made it together. He started and I finished. Simple ingredients and quick mixing. Very tasty and we will make this again for sure. I will be sharing some leftovers with family & friends as mine was twice the recipe size. Thanks!

Came out nice if a tad bit too sweet for my taste. (Used SBRay's BBQ sauce) But it might just be preference. My sister whose a picky eater has made about 5 burgers with the meat I made so I'm grateful! I'll try adding more spices and maybe a different root beer next time. (Actually I'll probably try a different recipe altogether sans soda lol)

I used a pork shoulder and cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours then I added sweet bar b que sauce for about an hour.  Excellent! My kids devoured it, I made steak fries as a side and now I'm ready to go to sleep.

I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder on the tenderloins, then covered them with 16 oz of root beer ( 2 8 oz cans).  I cooked on low for about 6 hours, drained the pork, then shredded it as suggested.  Added  a bottle of BBQ sauce and cooked on low for another hour.   Could not have been easier!   Delicious, and even better the next day.

Used petite pork roast, added sliced onion to the Crock-Pot, added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the roast, and used way less BBQ sauce than called for. Delicious!

This was a great recipe! Very simple. With my slow cooker it only took 5 hours on low because I didn't want to dry out the meat. I would definitely recommend not using a whole bottle of BBQ sauce right off the bat when it comes time to pull apart the meat and mix it in. It can be a little much. I used about half a bottle to marinade the meat in and then added a little extra and mixed it in when serving. The pork has such a good flavor from cooking all day that I didn't want to mask it!! Definitely try this! :)

Cooking is not my all time favorite thing to do so this crockpot receipe was just what I needed! It was so easy I would definitely make it again!
Some of the negative reviews were in reference to the meat tasting like rootbeer, however my husband loves root beer and he loved the pulled pork!

Okay, I loved this recipe. Super easy. I did use a shoulder, because it's what I had. Kinda just dumped a bottle of Mug on top of it and crushed a few garlic cloves and threw those in. After it was cooked we shredded it, added the BBQ sauce (& another splash of root beer!) and let it simmer. Delicious.

I thought this was fine, but my husband thought it tasted a little like perfume. I used Sweet Baby Ray's, which is his favorite BBQ sauce, so I'm guessing it was because of the root beer - possibly because I used diet (it was all I had) instead of regular. Next time I may try using ginger ale or even a cola.

A crowd pleaser for sure!  A note on the portion revision feature...i changed the number of portions for this recipe to feed 18 and it gave me a recalculated meat amount of 2.5 pounds...i bought 3 pounds just in case.  I had a group of 12 adults and 5 kids and barely had enough meat...in fact i'm afraid some folks didn't get quite enough.  I would round way up and add some just as a precaution.

I used diet root beer and drained it from the crock pot after 6 hours and added the barbecue sauce and cooked it for one hour more. I also mixed about 16 oz of regular barbecue sauce with about 2 oz of super spicy sauce to give it a kick and it turned out great! Very tender and juicy!

Very easy and good. I used the Hand-mixer method to pull/shred the pork. What a massive time saver! My meat was shredded perfectly in less than 20 seconds. Where I live, there is no such thing as root beer, so I used a can of Coke. Any kind of pop (soda) will have the same effect - sweetness, and the acid for tenderizer. Root beer will add some "herb" flavor.

I don't have a crockpot, but I followed the recipe with my dutch oven for 7 hours at 240 degrees Fahrenheit. After shredding I doused with Original Sweet Baby Rays. 
Tasted better than I've had at restaurants!

I made this according to the recipe.  While the pork was tender and cooked, it had absolutely no flavor to it.  The flavor came from the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  We use Original flavor.  It was VERY GOOD & made great sandwiches.  The kids loved it. Will make again, maybe tweak the seasoning a little.

I was skeptical using a pork tenderloin but this turned out awesome. I made 8lbs for a party and everyone loved it. Thank you for sharing.

Super easy to make. I used Dr. Pepper instead of Root Beer to marinate it, and it was absolutely delicious. This is a great recipe to try out if you are craving some BBQ but don't want to buy a ton of ingredients.

Don't make the mistake I did on batch number one... you must use REGULAR root beer, not DIET! Batch number two was superb, this will be a go to meal for us.

The easiest way to get pulled pork.  I make this recipe every other month.  Get BYGO pork loins so I can always have one on hand to fix barbeque.

I ended up using Dr. Pepper instead, as I had no Root Beer. It still tasted great and my family loved it!  My uncle loved it so much, he had 3 sandwiches!  IHuge hit and will make it again.

It was fair. The only thing that saved it was the B-B-Que sauce.
For B-B-Q, I'll stick with cooking my meat in the smoker.

The only changes we made to this was with the BBQ sauce. We always add either some Jack Daniels or Jim Beam in the sauce with some lime juice and liquid smoke..

This is an amazing recipe! So simple and delicious - it won rave reviews from my college age son and his roommate. Found a 4 pound pork loin on sale, so made all of it for $10 plus the cost of the root beer!

I found this recipe in a newspaper years ago and made it.  My guests loved it!    I lost the little sheet of paper that I cut out and 'bam'  here it is again!  Thank you.  I am making today it for a camping trip, and of course, saving to my favorites.

It's simple and tastes great!

I followed this recipe exactly as it said and while it wasn't bad tasting, the root beer made it weirdly sweet. It wasn't a taste that was to great with my husband and I. It did come out perfectly cooked though, so apart from the flavor not being our favorite this recipe worked really well.

So good! I used a pork shoulder like others had suggested and a .99 bottle of root beer. The key is using a good thick bbq sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce, added some Cole slaw on top of the sandwich and had a meal the whole family loved.

Great recipe, many thanks! After reading reviews, added 1 Walla Walla sweet onio, chili flakes and 3-4 smashed garlic cloves.  Cooked on low for  7 hours then pulled pork. Added Fletchers BBQ sauce (made in Spokane, WA) and cooked on low for another 3 hours. Absolutely delish and in mid-August, a great way to keep the kitchen cool. Will definitely make again, cheers!

Used 3 lb pork shoulder and Slow cooked as directed  using A&W root beer. Drained liquid after 7 hours, added bottle of Sugar Rays barbecue sauce and slow cooked another hour. Both me and my hubby found this to be lacking in taste.

Easy peasy.  Never would have guessed that cooking it in Root Beer would be a good idea.  It totally worked.  I made a 6 pound pork shoulder and added 2 bottles of  Virgil's Root Beer.  I cooked it overnight on low.  Started at 10:30pm and at 7:30am I drained it.  I probably drained it too much, frankly, but no matter.  I added about 2 cups chx stock and 2 bottles of  bbq sauce,  I put it on warm and low intermittently for the next few hours and it was just perfect.  Easiest thing I've ever made.

It was really tasty. I will try a different cut next time though. Tenderloin, while it was delicious and juicy, did not "shred" well. This was super easy and incredibly tasty though and is my new favorite.

I followed recipe to a T and it turned out great. My family loves pulled pork. I usually smoke a pork butt but this is a good alternative when you want a super easy recipe. I am just starting to cook so the easier the better. It gets a 5 star for simplicity, ease, and taste

I made this today and it was wonderful and oh so easy!  I did stab the pork shoulder and add salt, pepper and garlic before I put it in the crock pot.  I cooked it all day and then drained liquid, pulled the meat apart , added the bbq sauce and put it back in the crock pot.  The kids loved it.  Very tasty!

This recipe is Awesome!! Used 7+lb bone-in pork shoulder, submerged in about a half liter of root beer.  Cooked on low for 8 hours, dumped out the liquid and added Sweet Baby Rays (ended up using 20+ ounces). SO good!

I don't know if the brand of Root Beer is critical, but I've made a number of pulled pork recipes and this one, using A&W, Sweet Baby Ray's and pork shoulder always give me rave reviews.  I sometimes throw in a sliced sweet onion in the beginning as well.  Great recipe--you should definitely try it.  Thanks for posting!

I chose a BBQ sauce with brown sugar and hickory. Next time I'll use a less sweet sauce because the root beer adds enough sweetness.

It was simple and easy! I've made it once using pork tenderloin, and twice with a plain old pork roast. It was great every time! The meat has good flavor from the root beer, and when mixed with the right BBQ sauce (I use Sauce Beautiful), it's the bomb!

Try using country ribs instead of tenderloin. Much cheaper and more flavor! I have made this several times now and each time it is perfecto! Garlic and root beer. That's it.

This recipe is so simple a lot of you changed/added a lot of ingredients to make it your own.  I agree with others that think you should rate it only if you make it the same way as posted and then indicate what you like or don't like.  Those making changes can post their own recipes and let others rate it accordingly.  Well, off my soap box.  I made this exactly as posted for my Bunco night and all 12 ladies in attendance loved the recipe and my sister said it was the best BBQ sandwich she has ever eaten!  I will be making this anytime I'm hungry for BBQ pulled pork (tenderloin)!  So easy!  So amazing!

I had a 4 lb.. pork butt roast, followed the direction just as written and put it in my Nesco starting  at 250 degrees but after a couple hours, it seemed it was cooking too fast so decreased the temp to 200.  It was done to perfection in 6 hours.  Used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce after cutting up the meat well.  Absolutely delicious!  Also so easy.

I added Stubb's pork seasoning & salt & pepper.  What I thought was one 2 lb pork loin was actually 2 pork loins. I cooked for 6 hours on low & when I took the meat out to shred it, I found out it was SO GOOD that I decided not to add the barbecue sauce to the whole batch. My 4 year old is having a regular pulled pork sandwich, but my husband & I are having pulled pork with grilled onions & bell peppers. Everyone wins & it's a delicious dinner served with beans!

I made this exactly as the recipe said. It was really disappointing. It tasted kind of metallic or acidic because of the root beer. Maybe if it had added brown sugar to give it a little sweetness. 
The sauce didn't thicken up at all even after I had left it on low all night to see if it'd improve for lunch.

6-8-2016  ~First, in my mind a pork shoulder roast is much better suited for this cooking method than is lean pork tenderloin.  And I wish I would have drunk the good Sprecher root beer I used for this.  While the pork was good, I can say it was not because of the root beer, which added nothing.  Cooking the roast as I usually do, about seven hours with little to no water, shredding the meat, then adding your favorite barbecue sauce to taste and cooking an hour or so more, is every bit as good, if not better – better because I could have enjoyed drinking that darned good root beer.

Make sure you have enough BBQ sauce to cover your pork...otherwise some of it will be untouched (I learned that the hard way).  If you have left overs, put it in a bowl, cover the top with plastic wrap, and then leave it in your fridge until you're ready to serve again.  :)

I don't think the root beer made any difference so it's just pork in BBQ sauce. Tasted generic to me.

This was really good.  Cooked all day in 2 cans of A&W rootbeer.   Next time will probably season meat with garlic powder. We preferred the pork without the BBQ sauce.  Next time I think will just serve pork shredded and let people add their own sauce or condiments.

I dusted the pork in a seasoning salt first but other than that I followed the recipe. It was amazing and perfect. My whole family loved it and so did our company. Will Be making root beer pork again. I put it with a creamy spiced coleslaw from this website and it was to die for.

I use a pork butt or shoulder depending on what is available at the time.  The Root beer gives it a great flavor and keeps it moist. I have made it so many times that it has become a staple at parties and even begged for at my work.

Made it, and it came out AMAZING! Five stars is an understatement! Tripled the recipe by using a 6 lb. tenderloin, 2 liter of root beer, and 2.5 18 oz. bottles of Sweet Baby Rays hickory brown sugar barbecue sauce. It was delicious, and will definitely use this recipe in the future. Followed other reviewers suggestions and let the pork cook in the bbq sauce for about 45 minutes after draining the soda.

I've made this a few times and everyone loves it, especially my picky eaters! I did have to use more root beer than the recipe called for.

I did make some changes.
I used an almost 4 pound boneless pork shoulder. I cut it in half to get it to fit into my crockpot.  I made fork holes all over the pork and before cooking I rubbed it with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder. 6 hours on low. After shredding the pork to make the sauce I added four tablespoons each of brown mustard, black pepper grilling sauce. 6 ounces of tomato sauce to the BBQ sauce. I continued to cook, stirring occasionally, 2 hours longer on low.

This recipe was fool proof, the meat ended up super tender and I added sweet baby ray's original sauce. Paired the meat with butter toasted buns and american craft singles, knocked it out of the park.

this came out wonderful with a few changes.  i added a few cloves of garlic and rubbed the meat with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, ground mustard, onion powder,  and garlic powder.  I couldn't find pork shoulder at my local grocery so i used a tenderloin instead, but will try it with shoulder next time.  It made enough food to last me and my boyfriend all week, I'll definitely make it again!

Great method for cooking pulled pork.  I had made this before with a store bought sauce, but this time I used a high end barbeque sauce I was able to find on Amazon, and it really made a difference.

I tend to not be a fan of pork and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a pulled pork sandwich from any restaurant, but this came out amazing! It even reheats great (and maybe tasted even a little better the next day). We will definitely make this recipe again.

I didn't even change it much.  The onions I chopped into large chunks.  Added Garlic to taste. I don't eat bread so didn't need the buns but made a great dish with just vegetables and rice. Everyone loved it!!!  Oh, and I added a little bourbon to my sauce ;) wink

I thought it was awesome! Recipe was super easy.  I would say that it does depend on the type of BBQ sauce you use.  I used a noname bbq sauce, and next time I will use something else...maybe a hickory smoke...go easy on the sauce.  Tastes a lot like the sauce you use.   I will make it again, for sure.

I use cheaper cuts of pork like butt and it has always turned out amazing. I then use the allrecipe for Southern Grilled BBQ ribs. Delicious, make it all the time.

Definitely going to make this more often! Extremely easy to do. Don't cheap out on your bun though! Also once you pull it apart, the pork might get cold, so I put it in a separate pot and just leave it in the oven while I quickly broil the buns. The root beer you use will impact the flavour, so use your favorite brand (A&W for me), and just pick your favorite BBQ sauce. Don't pay attention to how much you use, as long as all the pork is covered.

Very good and very easy to make!  Used my fav BBQ sauce - Sweet Baby Ray's.  The pork was very moist and tender.  My only complaint is that the root beer made it VERY sweet.  I may try this again with other variations.

Hubby loved it! I threw it in the crockpot overnight, added the barbecue in the morning and packed the whole thing/with buns off to work with him. Affordable and delicious, I know he's not going to work through lunch today and there is plenty to share with his clients.

So easy and so delicious, I made it exactly as the recipe called for, and the family loved it.  I left it in the crockpot for 10 hours and it fell apart!  Tender and delicious!!  Definitely need to have bbq sauce to top with, and great leftovers too.  Will make this over and over.  Would be a huge hit and easy prep for a crowd too.

I used a pork sirloin roast (it was on sale) and made it the day before.  The next day I mixed some BBQ sauce with liquid smoke  and hot sauce and stirred it into the pulled pork, heated it again in the slow cooker until the flavours blended.  I didn't want the pork to be too wet so I was careful with the amount of the BBQ mixture.  There end result was a success - everyone loved it.  I'll make this again.

It was delicious!!!  I will definitely make it this way again.  The only thing I did different was  I marinated the pork over night to absorb the the seasoning.  Thanks for the root beer idea.

The meat is nice and tender, but it's too sweet. I tried in vain adding spices, getting a hotter BBQ sauce but it's still very very sweet, I think it's probably the root beer. I will not do it again.

This was really good and best of all...EASY!!! Seriously just incredibly simple. I'll play around with different sauces, I think I prefer more of a smokey flavor and this is very sweet. I also may try adding some spices to the pork before cooking too, I felt like it was just a bit too one-note for me. But overall I loved the simplicity and the huge portion, perfect for leftovers!

Absolutely incredible.  I used a 5 lb pork butt, and still used only a can of Barqs Rootbeer.  7 hours later the pork was supple and all  I had to do was take off the fat before I added bbq sauce. This will be my go to for pulled pork!

Super easy, super tasty! (As suggested by other reviews, I used shoulder instead of tenderloin.)

Great easy recipe.  I used a cheaper cut of meat like a pork shoulder or whatever was on sale.  Makes lots so good for a crowd.

The pork on it's own out of the slow cooker wasn't great, I had to spice up the bbq sauce a bit.

In my opinion this is a good start for pulled pork. Followed the recipe exactly, and while it came out good, without a doubt I'm sure it could be improved on. I'm thinking seasoning the pork beforehand, improving on the BBQ sauce, and cooking it longer afterward. Not the best recipe, but I'm definitely going to make it again with some changes and go from there!

The was the best and easiest pulled prob recipe ever! I added a 1/2 cup of chopped onions to the slow cooker and cooked them along with the pork tenderloin and root beer.  This will be my "go to" recipe from now on.

This was easy and delicious. I used pork shoulder and filled the slow cooker up half way. About 4 hours in, I flipped the pork shoulder and allowed it to cook for 4 more hours. Once it was off the bone and pulled, I put it back in the slow cooker and added Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce  and cooked on low it until it was hot.

I made this a couple months ago, just getting around to reviewing. Is easy and good.  But I think its only as good as the BBQ sauce you use.  I used the Sweet Baby Ray's.  I did not use a whole bottle, I just poured in enough to cover all the pork and put out the bottle to pour on more individually.   You don't taste the root beer at all, could probably use any type of soda/liquid for this.

This was the first time I've made pulled pork. I thought it was extremely sweet and very salty. We still ate it, but it was a bit "too much" on both fronts and, as I said, I don't know if that was the root beer, or the BBQ sauce I used, or both.

Couldn't really taste the flavour of the root beer . All we could taste was the BBQ sauce that we added after it was cooked.

I used a 2 1/2 lbs pork shoulder to do this recipe with Sweet Baby Ray's Original bbq sauce.  The flavor of the A & W didn't come through I am thinking due to the fat that came off of the pork shoulder.  Had the wife trim as much fat off as she was able.   Next attempt will try with a pork butt or pork loin.  Will definitely make again.  Had enough left overs for about a week.

Update : learned recently that "pork butt" and "pork shoulder" are the same cut of meat.

This is ridiculously easy to make and tastes amazing. I ended up using a 4lb loin roast (it's what I had) and pouring a little over a liter of root beer over it to mostly cover it. Cooked on high for 3 hours then low for another hour or so, drained well and removed the bones, shredded the meat then added Sweet Baby Rays honey bbq sauce. Put it back in the crock pot on warm so people could serve themselves from there. You do not have to know anything about cooking to make this and get rave reviews.

So disappointed that this was not great.  I made it with a pork shoulder roast which was fine but the root beer just made it too sweet.  I wouldn't make it again.

Easy and delicious recipe! I added a chopped onion to the bottom of the slow cooker and used a 5-lb. pork shoulder instead of pork tenderloin.  To get the last of the BBQ sauce out of its bottle, I added some rootbeer to the bottle, shook it, and added this to the pot.

I didn't use tenderloin, it was too expensive. I did use about a 4 pound pork shoulder though and it turned out amazing. I used a little salt and pepper too. It was so good I ate it and it's left overs four days straight.

This is doo-licious this recipe,  I make into little Pork Sliders often for my family and also when catering. In Australia, the equivalent to root beer is Sarsaparilla. I use Bundaberg brand.

Delicious and easy to make.  Used a 5LB picnic ham instead for about 10 hours in the slow cooker.  Shredded the pork and another hour on low in the slow cooker with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce.

We've made this twice now and really enjoy it. And other reviewers are right - it's super easy to make and perfect for busy people! We believe the key is the right barbeque sauce. We like spicy - so Famous Dave's Devil Spit is perfect!

Incredibly simple and delicious.  I was skeptical about this recipe using root beer but met or exceeded my expectations.  Served the pulled pork on Hawaiian Kings rolls...... definitely will make them again.
Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great and easy recipe. My Aussie husband loves the southern pulled pork that we get from home when we visit and he said this was the most authentic that I've made. I used two cans of A&W instead of one. I did rub salt, pepper, garlic powder, & onion powder on the meat, seared it, then put in slow cooker for six hours. Drained the root beer, pulled the meat off, which it really just fell off, and added the full bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and put back on for another hour or so. Next time I think that I will add some liquid smoke and play around with the spices, but whether I do or don't, I think this will be my go to recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Absolutely love this! My fiancé says it tastes just like Original Joe's pulled pork! However, I add a tiny bit of brown sugar as well. TASTES GREAT! Top it off with a brioche bun and you got one heck of a sandwich!

This recipe was, predictably, quite sweet. I added a bit of Sriracha to compliment the root beer flavor. This resulted in a zestier sandwich overall.  I served it with lettuce, onion, and a side of fries.

This is a great recipe. I make it using a large "loin" roast, which is frequently on sale here, rather than the expensive, small and very lean tenderloin. It has a nice fat cap, and can be cut into sections that make it easy to fit in any size slow cooker. The fat gives the beneficial tenderness and flavor, without huge chunks that need to be removed, before or after cooking. Other than that, I season it then follow the recipe as written. It's easy, foolproof and always a huge hit.

I used one bottle of IBC rootbeer over pork tenderloin. I put in the crock pot for 5 1/2 hours on low heat. I removed the pork loin, it shredded beautifully. Added Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and shredded pork to the crock pot then cooked for 30 min. Meat was dry and way too sweet! I will not be making this again.

I used a thick and spicy BBQ sauce with this.  My husband said it was a little sweet and that isn't really his thing.  Myself, I thought the bit of "sweetness" that came through was an awesome complement to the BBQ sauce I used.  Will definitely make it again.

Very good!  I made it according to directions.  Using Pork Tenderloin did make it a tad dry but still delicious.  The second time I made it with a Boston Butt cut.  It was also delicious but I had to painstakingly remove all the fat from it as I pulled it apart.  I think I'll stick with tenderloin.  In both cases...it was terrific!!!

I enjoyed it more once it cooled off in the fridge...strange, I know.  If it isn't knocking your socks off, let it sit in the fridge and revisit.  You may have a change of heart.

That being said, I actually used three bone-in pork chops and had no issues pulling the pork.  My root beer was Barq's and classic Sweet Baby Ray's.

Doesn't get much easier than this recipe. Butcher helped me select the pork, which was helpful, because the pork tenderloin was running $7 a pound and he said I could easily use other options.

For me it didn't have enough flavor so I ended up adding a little can of 100g of "Chipotle Adobado" to spice it a little. It helped but even if I used my fav BBQ sauce (Tony Roma's) it wasn't just what I thought it would be.
I will try next time with beer instead of root beer.

This was my first try at pulled pork and was pretty happy with it! I was super skeptical about the root beer but turned out well! made sure to use enough to ensure that the meat was covered (2 bottles) and mixed it with sweet baby rays before setting it to cook to offset the sugar. Drained some after so it wasn't so soupy. Told a co worker about it, they tried it and was impressed!

While this calls for a more expensive type of pork - I buy in bulk at Costco so the price wasn't to bad.  This is so easy to make & my kids (15, 12 & 11) LOVE it.  I make it monthly so the cost for a family of 5 is less than $10.  Add some fruit and salad - great lunch or dinner!

Made the recipe exactly as it's listed using Baby Ray's sweet and spicy sauce. By cooking the pork loin in root beer, it'll smell, and somewhat taste, similar to root beer. I personally find root beer disgusting, so it's a little off putting. I guess I hoped that it'd be like when you cook with wine, and there's not such a literal flavor exchange! Next time I make pulled pork I'll probably use a different recipe.

So DELICIOUS and very simple! I will absolutely make this again. My husband is a BBQ fanatic and very picky. I was nervous to make this because of that. He had NO complaints and had several sandwiches. We had cheesy potatoes with them. So good left over as well!

This pulled pork recipe is really good.  The type of BBW sauce dictates the out come.  I chose a smokey sauce and it was amazing.

First time using this recipe and it was Awesome! I have a husband and teenage son and we all loved it! I used onion hamburger buns toasted which made it even tastier! Such an easy and delicious recipe will definitely be making this again! I did add onion just for preferred taste.

Loved it! So easy. I used chicken thighs because I'm not a big pork person, and then drizzled some worchestershire sauce over the top when I added the BBQ sauce. I also liked the chicken thighs because they cook faster and I was in a hurry since I didn't think ahead. It took about 2 hours on high, then drained the root beer, add the BBQ sauce then cook another hour. I had to shred the chicken myself a bit but it's so good I really didn't mind.

Sometimes the simplest way is the best way! This is a no-frills recipe but it works great. While the obvious use for this dish is sandwiches, we've used it for several different dishes including shredded pork tacos. The other nice thing about this recipe is that you're free to use whatever barbecue sauce you want--our family is a big fan of Sweet Baby Ray's and we've used everything from the original recipe to honey barbecue to sweet and spicy. One modification that I strongly recommend is mixing your barbecue sauce in after you drain and shred the pork and letting it simmer on low for an hour. It makes a HUGE difference as far as imparting flavor to the meat.

This is my husbands favorite dinner! I've made it a couple different times now and he loves it every time. It's so easy and time saving that I don't have to worry about dinner being on time it I set it up early in the morning. My husband says it's the best pulled pork he's ever had and I like that I know it's cooked well. For some reason every time my husband orders pulled pork at a restaurant, he gets really sick. I can now make his favorite dinner without worrying he will get sick.

I'm more of a Carolina bbq kind of guy, but the women in the family loved this due to the sweetness I assume. I used the pork tenderloin in an effort to cut out unnecessary fat. yes, not as good as using a Boston butt, but really not bad at all.   I cooked about 4 lbs of it. Rubbed with cracked peppercorn, sea salt, and granulated garlic. Covered with 2 liters of A&W (the only major brand of root beer worth anything). Added a few table spoons of hickory liquid smoke. cooked on low for 8 hours, reduced to warm for 4 hours. drained, pulled, and sauced with sweet baby rays hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce, added a couple more tablespoons of liquid smoke and cooked on high for about a half hour.  served on buns and topped with cole slaw. Pretty tasty. The liquid smoke is a must. Next time I'll use a bbq sauce that isn't quite as sweet. My wife and 3 year old daughter liked this so much that I'm sure we will make it regularly (assuming we don't get sick of it after eating leftovers for 4 or 5 days). I may try freezing some leftovers, if so I'll update this and let you know how it tasted after freezing. I freeze Carolina bbq all the time, I assume this will freeze ok too. Thanks for the recipe.

Used pork butt instead of tenderloin and i pull the pork an hour before its finished and add Sweet Baby Rays sauce to let it soak up the flavor for a little while. Everyone who's tried these has come back for seconds (and thirds!). Definitely a keeper! :)

About as easy as it gets. Good flavor from the root beer. We used diet root beer. Next time I catch pork loin on sale, we'll be sure to stock up the freezer. We cooked it overnight, and had a quick packing lunch for the next day. :)

Fantastic!  I served this at a family event.  Used 2 2.5lb pork tenderloins and 2 bottles of root beer, then simmered for an hour or so in Bone Sucking Sauce on the stove.  I was absolutely certain that I'd have leftovers for work.  There were 10 of us and I didn't have anything left over.  It was a hit and everyone was shocked when I said that I had cooked it in root beer.

Awesome! This turned out great.
I used a full 2L bottle of rootbeer and tried both with and without onion soup mix. Both times it turned out great. As the main flavour will come from your BBQ sauce, make sure you choose one you'll enjoy. I used a Miss Dianna's Smokey flavoured sauce.

We use pork loin all the time and we get quite a few meals from it. There are just the two of us. We freeze the pork in portions suitable for two and get 6-8 servings for two. I think that is pretty economical. 

We love this recipe and have passed it on to others.

Pork was fork tender.  I think our bbq sauce was off for this recipe.  I used Kraft Sweet & Spicy and it was not a wow for this.  Thank you for sharing.

Super easy to make! I cooked the pork tenderloin for about 6.5 hours and then drained. I added Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicy. I'm not a veteran cook so I didn't add anything else to "spruce" it up. No matter. It was great. The meat was tender and the sauce obviously makes the taste. If you follow this to a t, be selective with your sauce.

Fourth time making it. Tastes great every time. I find the more acidic root beer to have the best results.

I made it with root beer and my favorite bbq sauce, which is sweet and tangy.  Ended up too sweet.

If I can make this, anyone can! I'm a complete kitchen novice and this was super easy!! I used 2 pounds of pork shoulder, but followed the rest of the recipe. It was a great lunch for Father's Day! My hubby was very pleased! I definitely will be making this again!

I love the fact that this recipe is so easy. I did not use a slow cooker, I used a pressure cooker instead. I put in the pressure cooker for 30 minutes the first time, and did it again with bbq for another 20 minutes. I just threw in a twist by stir frying garlic and sliced red and green peppers first, a tbsp of hot sauce and then mixed it with the pulled pork. Finally, melted cheese with ANY meat in a toasted bun is delicious.

Super easy and so good.  The root beer is a great way to cook the meat so that it is tender and pulls apart easy.

This is so simple and tasty, with being a good starter recipe to make it your own!  I use a 2.5 Pork Loin Tips which our local store has on sale very often as a buy one get two free.  2.5 pounds is plenty for our family of 5.  But it was also great as a potluck offering.  The tips have less fat and when I can buy 7.5 pounds of meat for $12, I am pretty happy. I have used root beer, gingerale, rubbed the tips in McCormick's dry rubs, my home made rub, and it turns out wonderful everytime.

OK this should be 4 stars for wasting a great cut of pork.  This is a perfect pot-luck meal.  Yes its super simple and the flavor really comes from your BBQ sauce, but sometimes that's all you need.

I made this recipe exactly as written and loved it!  My BF's son loved it, and he is very picky. He told me it was better than our local barbecue joint (which is an incredible compliment).  Anyway, I am making this again tonight but this time I am trying it with pork shoulder because it is just so much cheaper.  This is such a great recipe. It is delicious and tastes like a lot of work went into it!

Fantastic recipe! I used a small pork tenderloin from Trader Joe's which I butterflied (sliced in half) and sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic powder and poked holes with a fork in the meat to help absorb the juices. I turned it occasionally in the root beer to make sure it cooked evenly. It was a small piece so when checking at 4 hours, the meat was coming apart very well. At that time, I drained it, reserving about 1 cup of the liquid. I returned the shredded meat, about 3/4 of a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and the reserved liquid (for added moisture and flavor). I then cooked it for just over an hour longer. It came out wonderful! I recently had a pulled pork sandwich at a restaurant, and it was all dried out. Not this...it was very moist and delicious. Thanks Livie's Mammy!

Holy. Cow.  This was awesome! I was skeptical of the root beer, but it was amazing.  The meat was wonderful even before I added the Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy.  Next time I will try a mustard or vinegar based sauce to tone down the sweetness, but I am not touching the meat recipe! Perfect!!

Easy, delicious and economical. Will make this again for a big crowd/ pot luck. I used a pork butt roast instead of tenderloin. It had more fat and was a traditional pulled pork consistency. I will try tenderloin to save on calories and cholesterol! I used Trader Joes Carolina BBQ sauce and retained a bit of the root beer sauce to balance out the vinegar taste. Great with cole slaw and baked beans. Next time I'll use up the collard greens to round it out. This is a keeper!

Made this Saturday. I used the pork loin because we prefer a lean cut of meat. I put s&p as well as a little garlic powder on the pork before adding to the crock pot. I used A&W root beer. Cooked it the maximum amount of hours. I used Sweet Baby Rays spicy and sweet as well as a few shakes of hickory liquid smoke. I had large rolls, buttered them and grilled them until golden brown. This came out great. My husband enjoyed it very much. I tried a few shakes of hot sauce on mine it it was good. Had enough left over for 2 sandwiches. The next day I took a skillet and sprayed it and added the pork with a little more BBQ sauce. Tasted just as good as it did the first time. I will make this again but I'm also going to try a less sweet recipe as well. Good job Livie's Mammy!

Delicious and much easier to clean up than recipes that have you cook the pork directly in the BBQ sauce (no gummy residue cooked onto the crockpot). I quartered an onion and threw that in with the root beer and discarded it before shredding the meat. Served with a fresh fruit salad.

Very good recipe, I have been making this for years without the root beer and made it this time with the root beer (I used A&W) it was really good and very tender.

I would recommend waiting longer than stated in the recipe to shred the pork.  I used shoulder as someone commented and the shredding was tough going...but the pulled pork that resulted was wonderful.  I used A&W root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.  MMMM!!  Raves from the guests.

This is a very simple, no fuss recipe that tastes great!!  Except for using a cheaper cut of pork (Boston Butt shoulder cut) there is no need to take the extra steps to preseason or change a thing.  I have all boys and they devoured it!! Served with seasoned red potatoes & homemade coleslaw.  YUM YUM YUMMY!!

Easy & Delicious!!  First time ever making pulled pork.  I used a bottle of IBC Root beer.  Drained liquid after the meat was tender and easily shredded.  Put shredded meat back in crock pot with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and let it simmer for another 2+hours.  Absolutely DELISH!  Definitely more of a sweet BBQ than savory.

WOW - YUM!!

I used a 3 lb pork butt instead of tenderloin - I think the fattier cut of meat turns out better for pulled pork.  I followed instructions and AMAZING!!  I was doubtful about the root beer but it turned out so so good!!  Better than pulled pork from a restaurant.  Will definitely be making this again - so easy and so delicious!!  Thank you!!

This was very good and easy.  I also rubbed salt, pepper, and garlic salt on the meat before cooking.  I used diet root beer because I cant have sugar.  I made a very low sugar BBQ sauce for the meat and it turned out great.  I was worried that the diet root beer would not work very well, but it did!  I will def make this again!

As with others, I was skeptical about using root beer to make this. I am so HAPPY that I did. This is AMAZING!!!I can't believe how the pork just falls apart, and it melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!! This is my go to recipe from now on. I baked it in a covered roasting pan, with the root beer 1/2 way up. I can't wait to get my favorite BBQ sauce in it.

I was looking for something that could pretty much cook itself while I'm at work all day and still be delicious, this recipe is it! My pulled pork turned out amazing. My boyfriend and I loved it. I didn't have root beer on hand, so I used Coke instead. Coke works just as well. Also, I lightly toasted the kaiser buns in the oven. I will definitely be making this again.

Made it for family's easter pot luck and everyone loved it. By far best bbq pulled prok recipe I ever ate and so easy!! Made with a 7lb pork shoulder roast and filled crock pot with root beer. I was skeptical of only using root beer as flavoring since I tend to use my whole spice shelf when cooking, but it is so yummy and not lacking in flavor. I cooked it overnight, drained, and shredded it. Put back in crockpot and added bbq sauce with a little water and cooked for another hour or so. Delicious!!

Listen up folks, this is it! I read some of the helpful reviews and this was my first time making this. I didn't add any seasoning or sear the meat or put any rub on it. Just a bottle of a&aw rootbeer and a 7lb pork shoulder instead of tenderloin (gotta lot of mouths to feed 'round here and tenderloin is expensive) but recipe is easy and spot on. Mine went in my Dutch oven cause I couldn't shove that big ol' swine in my crockpot! 325 for 4 hours in the oven and that was all that piggy said! I will definitely be adding this to the permanent recipe box.

Easy supper for a lazy day. Used a boston butt instead of tenderloin (way cheaper). Tossed it in the crock pot with the root beer and forgot about it until that night. Shredded/ drained it and added the BBQ sauce. After lunch today will make 3 meals for my family of 4 already from this. Thanks for the easy mode supper. Will use again.

Very good, and easy too. I mean, it's a pretty tall order to screw up pulled pork, IMO, but it was easy and relatively quick.

This recipe is awesome. It doesn't take much effort but produces great results! I have been asked twice now to make it for events, and I have only made it once before! I add a little liquid smoke just to give it a hint of smokiness, also normally use pork butt because of the nice fat that adds flavor and moisture. I pair it with bubbas best BBQ sauce and it is a slam dunk!

I was really hoping that this would be the best thing I have ever ate given >2,700 reviews. However, I just thought it was "okay". I used a pork butt as many suggested, used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce as many suggested, as well as A&W rootbeer. I've never made slow cooker pork before so wasn't sure what to expect. Husband said he thought it was good...it just seemed like it was missing something, perhaps the type of bbq sauce (sweet and spicey) wasn't a good selection. I will note that it did taste better the next day. My mom makes awsome pulled pork so I asked what she used to flavor it and she stated she actually used a combo of bbq sauce and she used Coke. So maybe it was the rootbeer that made it taste less than desirable....Will try it again using different bbq sauce to see it that will make a difference. The recipe was very easy to follow however so that is why I gave it 4 stars.

I am not a fan of root beer, but I tried this recipe anyway because reviewers stated you could NOT taste the root beer, and the meat would be fall apart tender. I used a 4lb. pork tenderloin because that was what I had on hand, and it was very tender after about 8 hrs cooking on low. BUT, it definitely tasted of sweet root beer. So, I used a large bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. The spicy sauce did cut some of the sweetness. I don't know how you could say you can't taste the root beer. Next time, I will use beef broth as others did and not bother with root beer.

This was just as incredible as all of the reviews said. I used whole foods brand root beer because it's made with real cane sugar and comes in a two liter bottle. I also used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin, although I found myself pulling out chunks of fat as I shredded the pork, because it was a fattier cut. I cooked about four and a half pounds of pork in two liters of root beer for seven hours, then I drained it and, also on the recommendation of other reviewers, added Sweet Baby Ray's Swwet and Spicy barbecue sauce. Some of the reviews had called for the Hot and Spicy, which, I discovered, no longer exists.

Used a Boston butt as others suggested. This is such an easy and delicious recipe! We served our sandwiches on King's Hawaiian hamburger buns - yum!

This is a GREAT recipe. I used pork loin roast which has more fat, but is MUCH cheaper. I just peeled off the fat before I pulled the meat apart. I agree that adding the barbecue sauce and cooking on high for an hour really made a big difference.

Simple AND delicious!!  I was looking for something easy to make for my husband and his friends, but I didn't expect much from such a simple recipe.  I used Famous Dave's BBQ Sauce and it came out excellent!  The only meat I had on-hand was a few pork chops, so I just made sure to remove all the bones, and it was perfect! The flavor was great and it just melts in your mouth!

So easy and so good!  My whole family liked it, including my picky eaters.  We tasted the meat before adding the barbecue sauce and it was just as good plain.  I'll certainly make this dish again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this on Christmas Day along with homemade cole slaw. It was quite the hit and took minimal effort to make. I used a pork butt roast and served the pulled pork on a pretzel bun.Delicious!

Since I have never had pulled pork before, I have nothing to compare this to.  One thing I do know, this was tasty! tasty! tasty!  I only had 1 x 1-pound tenderloin so I used 1 cup root beer to which I mixed in about 1/4 cup of bbq sauce before pouring over the meat in the slowcooker.  I also added a little extra bbq sauce to the top of the tenderloin while cooking.  Even tho I reduced the amount of ingredients, I did not reduce the cooking time.  I served it with homemade mac and cheese--hubby& I absolutely LOVED it!  A definite make again recipe!!

I did not care for this recipe. The root beer left an unappealing and strange taste on the meat, and I like root beer very much. It's almost a chemically strange twang that does not get covered up even under copious amounts of BBQ sauce.

The root beer did the job of cooking the pork and it actually smelled pretty decent while cooking.

Three others in the household seemed to either be meh about it, one liked it, which is why it gets 2 starts instead of 1. I will not make this again.

This recipe isn't a home run as written - I feel like pork tenderloin was definitely the wrong cut here, because my meat essentially turned out kind of "mushy" once shredded and mixed with bbq sauce. The overall cooking method is great, super easy and cooks the pork nicely!

I thought this was a great recipe. It was easy and my hard to please husband and picky nephew both loved it. My husband even ate it the next day and he rarely eats leftovers. The first two times I tried it with Root Beer and today I am trying it with Dr. Pepper after reading a couple reviews that suggested it. I used more than just a can of soda though. In my 2 quart crock pot I probably used 2 cans in order to completely submerge it. As far as the BBQ sauce, I personally like the Jack Daniels line. The meat always comes out very tender and delicious. You can't miss with this simple recipe!! AMAZING!!

Followed recipe exactly, however I did use the cheaper cut of meat. Turned out amazing! Served on the Hawaiian rolls and everyone love it! Don't be afraid of adding the rootbeer. It's not as weird as it sounds.

Very easy, but the result was only so-so.

My wife and I though the pork was rather bland (needed seasoning) and didn't care for the root beer flavor.

I followed this recipe very closely. I used a 2.5 lb. pork roast (on sale at Kroger; buy one, get one). I sprayed the crock pot with vegetable oil spray, placed it in the crock pot, set for 4 hrs. on high, poured Root Beer about halfway up the roast, poured a packet of McCormick's BBQ Pulled Pork Crock Pot Seasoning in the Root Beer and on top of the pork covering it heavily, covered, and waited. Two hours into it I flipped the roast to moisten some of the seasonings. When it was done,  I pulled it out, shredded on a cutting board, placed in a glass baking pan, mixed with 1 bottle of Kroger barbaque sauce and kept in the oven on warm until my dinner sides were finished (mashed potatoes and baked apples with cranberries). We ate the pulled pork both with and without a bun.

This was good, but nothing special. I do not think the root beer added anything.  All I could taste is the barbq sauce on the pork. Could hardly taste the pork at all.  I used Sweet Baby Rays. The sauce should be diluted some. Maybe add a half bottle along with the root beer when cooking it.  I am an expert cooking teacher and have taught cooking for 20 years

You can totally taste the rootbeer, which wasn't bad, but I couldn't get past it.

I just made this and I followed the recipe exactly except I used pork shoulder because I could not get the tenderloin. I love the taste as it is different and when paired with cole slaw, just delish!

I made this recipe today using a boneless mini pork sirloin roast (2.25 pounds). This cut is not as lean as a tenderloin and not as fatty as butt. After seasoning the roast with black pepper and garlic powder. I slice two medium size onions and placed them in the bottom of my crock pot. Having read reviews which suggested the root beer made the pork too sweet, I added one tablespoon of Korean red pepper powder on top of the onions, placed the roast on top then adding the root beer. I am sure any hot pepper powder, flake or sauce would suffice. On the low setting the pork cooked in 9 hours. The pork was tender and flavorful with just a little heat in the background. I have made a similar recipe with gingerale but prefer the root beer.

I have made this three times and it was so very good each time. I am wondering if I could do it with chicken to be low fat?

I was torn between 2 or 3 stars for this recipe. It was definitely nothing special. I was trying to find a pulled pork recipe that would appeal to my wife and I, who both like spicier food, and my son, who doesn't. My son didn't like the flavor that the root beer gave to the pork, and I found it bland even with the addition of barbecue sauce. This is one case where trying to please everyone ended up leaving everyone somewhat dissatisfied.

I should have read the reviews before I read this. I followed it exactly - bad call. The tenderloin is way too dry.  If all I wanted to do was drown it in BBQ sauce I suppose it would have been fine but I wanted to taste the meat, too. MIght be better with pork shoulder.

I was very disappointed in this recipe - I found the root beer made it way too sweet.  Would not make it again.  I love pulled pork but will try a different method next time.

I wouldnt use pork tenderloin. I always use a pork shoulder which I season with salt and pepper. I cut up a few onions and rest the shoulder on top. I cook on high for 2 hours, then low for three. Its always delicious

I am no whiz in the kitchen, but this was a simple to follow recipe. I don't blame anyone but myself, seeing as how I am not a big root beer fan in the first place. I thought that would tenderize the meat, not taste like hot root beer pork. It, to me, was not edible. Not only did it stink up the entire house like root beer, it did not taste well in the end. Again, I should have chosen a different recipe, so that is my fault. I would never make this again, or suggest it, unless you love root beer more than life itself.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times for various occasions.  My relatives, family and friends all have given the same response each time.  Delicious!  I've used different cuts of pork and all taste great.  By far, my most used pork recipe and my ONLY BBQ pulled pork recipe.

So soo sooo good! It was juicy and had an amazing flavor, plus, it's a cheap meal! I paid $8 for my pork tenderloin, and about $8 all together for the root beer, BBQ sauce, and buns. I love this recipe!

This was great!  I used a pork butt and not a tenderloin.  I used two bottles of BBQ sauce and cooked it a little longer to get it all warmed through.  Family gobbled it up.  Will make again!

I tried this once and submerged the pork in root beer, but I'm not sure if thats the right thing to do or not. The results were still darn good, but is just pouring the stuff over it enough?  I'm trying again today :)

Delicious! I made this dish for my husband and mother in law, and everyone gave it great reviews. I used a 2lb pork loin, added salt pepper and garlic salt, and used Barq's Rootbeer (the BEST rootbeer in my opinion!). After 7 hours on low I drained out the rootbeer and shredded the meat. I added Sweet Baby Rays Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and cooked for another 30min. It was moist and yummy!

I just made this recipe the other night...it is definitely a do-over in my house!  We loved it!  I must admit that I was a little skeptical using root beer soda but the pork doesn't taste like root beer at all.  It is super tender and easy to pull apart and you can't beat it with your favorite bbq sauce.  Will be adding this to our do-over recipe list.  Enjoyed very much!

Tastes much better the next day, when the barbecue sauce flavour has had time to really sink into the meat.  Lovely with a roll and salad.

This is good but much better if you throw in some of the Rib Rub from the Kansas City Style Back Ribs recipe on this site. Makes the flavour much better.

I was surprised how much you could still taste the root beer in the pork, even after draining all the juices. Too sweet for us. And the meat was almost too tender, as in MUSHY. Plenty of cracked black pepper and liquid smoke helped make it pretty tasty, but I'll keep looking for a good go-to slow cooker pork recipe.

One word: astounding.  I do not like root beer, so I was a bit worried that the room would smell like root beer all day.  Nope.  Smelled like heaven.  I splurged on the root beer and got something without high fructose corn syrup.  Didn't bother draining it, since I was at work and the sink was so far away.  I just left the lid off for a little while after I shredded the pork before I added the BBQ.

Thank you so much!  Will definitely make this all the time.

I didn't think the root beer added much to this recipe, and I didn't think a tenderloin was a good meat selection. Reading the other reviews, a lot of people say "this is a great recipe, but I had to change x, y, z." Me too, which makes me think it's not a great recipe.

It wasn't bad all in all... though I had to add more fluid at the end to even out the sauce to pork ratio but it was good.  I will use this as a base for future pulled pork recipes.

a little dry with the tenderloin - but mixed sauced into the shredded meat and nobody knew the difference.  Excellent!

Easiest recipe by far!!  I used a 6.5 lb pork butt I got from my local butcher (not tenderloin), added root beer and a coating of bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) and let it cook! I flipped it after about 5 hours of cooking. (Total cook time was 9 hours) Fell off the bone when it was done! I left it sit in a large bowl for about an hour to cool, then I shredded it. I put all of the juice from the cooker in a container and put aside. I then put the shredded pork back in the cooker and added the some (not all) of the leftover juice back in (to keep it from drying out) and put it on low/warm. It was even good without adding bbq sauce.

I needed pulled pork for lunch and so I started this the night before. I let the root beer and meat cook all night on low. In the morning I was a bit concerned because I wasn't sure it was done but I decided to drain the liquid and shred the pork. It shredded well and I put it back in the slow cooker with our favourite bbq sauce which is Sweet Baby Ray's. I let it cook on low for another couple hours until it was warmed through. This was absolutely delicious and it couldn't have been easier. I would recommend it and will definitely be making this again.
UPDATE: I use a pork butt roast for this and then when I shred it I pull out all the fat. This recipe is so versatile you can use almost any size of roast. I’ve used anywhere from a 3 lb to a 6 lb roast and they both worked fine. You just have to adjust the amount of bbq sauce you add at the end.

Made this with A&W from a 2 liter bottle ... did about 1/2 of it for 5 lbs of pork tenderloin.  Used Stubb's Original sauce.  Turned out very good, although the sauce was a little sweet for my taste.  Rest of the family loved it.  When it was even better, though, was the next day!  Cold, outta the fridge, it was FANTASTIC.  I've eaten leftovers for a week, without complaining.

Love this "make it as you want it" recipe. I added Chipotle chili pepper powder to the rub which gave it a nice kick. I used two cans rootbeer and one can Dr. Pepper. After cooked I used the left over juice to make a sauce for a pork tenderloin recipe I use since most pork tenderloins tend to be dry. I just added some chicken bouillon, salt, and Wondra Mixing flour to thicken it up. Yum!

Tenderloin worked just fine, however, I'm sure a fattier cut would taste better.  I'm a health nut so I used the leaner cut and reduced the amount of bbq sauce.  

Used 1.25 lbs of meat so only cooked it for 5 1/2 hours, then 1 hour more with the sauce.  Amazing.

It was certainly easy enough to make. That ease is my favorite part of the recipe. I thought the meat was a bit too dry.  I also didn't think the flavor was exceptional. My husband also thought it on the dry side; he simply added more bar-b-q sauce to his.  I stacked my pork on a warm roll along with some cole slaw and with the added dressing from the slaw it was a good meal.  Just not as great as I expected it to be.  I will make it again but, perhaps next time, I'll use a different, more marbled cut of meat and more root beer.  That just might make it juicier.

It is easy, yes, but the only flavor is the BBQ sauce that you add in!  So, pick a good sauce!
Do NOT make this with tenderloin - that cut is too delicious prepared other ways.  I used a pork loin like the allrecipes recommended.  Again, meat was tender but the flavor just wasn't there.

It was a good meal, but I didn't feel it was spectacular.  I used Dad's Rootbeer and wonder if I use something stronger if it would make a bigger difference?  I will definitely add onion.  Worth exploring.

This was a a great recipe to make in advance and serve as my family arrived at different times (from out of town.)I took the advice on here and bought a Boston butt instead of a pork tenderloin- great advice, wonderful flavor. 
 I bought 2 (12 oz) bottles of regular Root Beer, and used about one and a half. I cooked it 6 hours in my slow cooker, let it cool, then shredded it and returned it to the slow cooker with BBQ sauce.
 
 It was a real hit--and we're a family that usually sticks to grilled chicken or fish! It's very easy, very tasty, and not $$$. So glad I found this recipe-I've shared it w/several friends and family who also love it!

Didn't have any root beer around, so I replaced it with a can of real beer :).

Threw in some fresh red onions and fresh jalepeno peppers (which I pretty much put in everything), fresh ground pepper and some Sriracha sauce to give it even more kick. 

Turned out great, but not for people who don't like spicy!

I served this on onion rolls.  It cooked perfectly and completely fell apart into shreds after I drained it - stayed juicy too, not dry at all.  My husband and son both ate two sandwiches.  You can definitely taste a root beer taste in there.  I may have just needed more bbq sauce on mine to cover it, but overall this was a great Sunday meal and the boys loved it.

So easy and so delicious. (: A full bottle of barbecue sauce may be a bit much, so I just added a little bit at a time until it fit mine and my husband's taste. Love how easy it was!

My husband and I both jumped on that front page recipe in the "Special Preview of Delicious Things", for Slow Cooker Pulled Pork, yummy.  So easy and delish.  

 Thank you for the issue staff at "allrecipes".

It's great with beef too!  I had a 3 pound beef tri-tip roast that was on its last day and needed to be used right away.  I saw this recipe in the new allrecipes magazine, and it seemed worth a shot.  I used the recipe as written, except I had to pour more root beer in to cover the roast because it was bigger.  It was so easy and delicious!  I'll definitely keep this one for parties - it'd be great in sandwiches or over nachos!

Wonderful!  this is the best recipe on here for pulled pork that I've tried and I have tried several.  I cooked on high 1 hour and then low 6 hours.  I also added kosher salt, onion powd4er and garlic powder and stabbed the meat with a fork all over.  Just before serving I mixed in a little Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. The root beer gave the pork such a funny taste. From now on, I'll stick to my traditional pulled pork recipe.

Super easy and tasty... I made exactly as written with pork tenderloin and KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce. Everyone loved it. I served it with Hawaiian Sweet break rolls. I could slightly taste the root beer but don’t think others noticed since I knew it was in there.  While not the best ever pulled pork perry darn good especially since it was so so easy.

Oh My Yumminess!!!! Followed the directions to the "T" and ended up with THE MOST flavorful pulled pork I've EVER had!! What a wonderful way to use up an otherwise, sometimes boring piece of meat...so good, I've got another one in the slow cooker today!! I made a large 3.5lb loin roast so I'd have leftovers!!

Loved it!  Seared my loin prior to crock pot land.  My only diagreement is to NOT throw that yummy liquid goodness out!  After shredding I added some back in to keep it moist .  :)

This has become a regular dinner in our house.  We serve it on fresh yeast rolls and it is AMAZING.  The only reason I gave it four stars and not five, is that pork tenderloin does NOT make for good pulled pork.  User a cheaper cut of pork, like a pork butt/shoulder roast.  We have tried this with Dr. Pepper instead of root beer, and my husband likes that even better.  We ONLY use Stubb's BBQ sauce and it's perfect for this recipe.  We have made this several times and couldn't be happier with it, and it is SO EASY.

Wow!!  This is fantastic and so easy.  I did not deviate from the recipe but I used a blade meat tenderizer on the pork loin and almost covered the pork with the root beer.  I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  In the morning I set the slow cooker for 6-1/2 hours on low, turning the meat over halfway through the cooking.  I drained it and didn't need 2 forks to shred, it was so tender it fell apart using a single fork!  I added a jar of BBQ sauce and set it back on low for about 45 minutes.  I have never ever had such tender pork!  It almost melted in my mouth!  I've  always smoked my pork when making pulled pork but after having this my smoker may gather dust!

Delicious and easy. I made some modifications. I added apple juice with root beer. I took the cooked meat out and put it in a pot after shredding. I added barbeque sauce then filled that bottle halfway with apple cider vinegar. NC resident and native. We like vinegar in our barbeque. Also added pork rub spices. All of that cooked for a bit to merge flavors. Kids and husband loved it!

This was the first time I had ever made/had pulled pork. Although a lot of people here suggested a cheaper cut of meat I decided to just follow the recipe. I used sugar cane root beer from the health food section of my local supermarket and Budweiser BBQ sauce. It was absolutely delicious.

Way too dry! I was pretty disappointed in how this came out. I should have went with my initial instict and seared the pork before putting it in the crockpot. Next time I will try that.

My Daughter-in-law loves pulled pork!  I made this recipe and she loved it!  My husband, not a barbeque man, really raved!  My Dad, who does not like barbeque sauce at all, really liked the pork after it was cooked in the root beer.  He ate it just like that!  Me, I couldn't get enough!  I used the tenderloin and rootbeer and it was perfect!

We made two full crockpots of this for a birthday party. Everyone was coming back for more and asked for the recipe. We used pork tenderloin and reserved some of the juices to add along with the Sweet Baby Ray's Sauce. It was moist and had great flavor. Super simple...we didn't even measure anything out. Plus, it's easy to put together for a crowd.

This is awesome! Pork tenderloin is an excellent choice because it's so lean. I cooked 3lbs in root beer for 7 hours, drained, shredded, and added Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy bbq sauce and cooked for another hour. Tender, soft, juicy, tasty! The whole family loved it.

I followed the recipe and I've made it twice. Personally, I think it is too sweet. I'm looking for a more savory recipe. I made sure I drained the root beer off thoroughly before adding the BBQ sauce. The tenderloin is good. Note sure it's worth wasting that much money...

Kids liked it but my husband and I didn't care for it.  It was a little bit chewy n runny.  Smelled good while it was cooking tho.

I thought it was rather odd that there was no seasoning at all in this recipe. But I followed it anyway, thinking that the root beer really was some kind of "magic ingredient". The result was the most bland, tasteless meat I've ever had. Pouring Barbeque sauce on it was like pouring the sauce on paper. I won't be using this recipe again.

Very disappointed.  Thought it was going to be great after seeing all the high reviews.
Pork pulled apart very easily.
It tasted like I slapped BBQ sauce all over it.
Won't make this again.

Sensational...I used Coke cos that's what I had, a chopped onion & rubbed the pork with pepper before browning it...then followed your great recipe...I'd never heard of pulled pork ( I'm in Oz) but wow it's awesome & I found Sweet Baby Rays sauces are now sold here...this was soooo good...my diet's gone to hell lol

Easy. Yummy. I live in Alabama so I know good pulled pork. THIS is good pulled pork. I always use pork butt as well. It goes on sale and I buy it and freeze it. I use Garland Jack's BBQ sauce. The "boys" ( all in their 20s now ) flock to the kitchen when this is being served up!!!

Excellent, used hard cider instead of root beer because I didn't have any in the house.  Used Stubbs (Austin, TX) BBQ sauce because it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup--which so many BBQ sauces have these days. The whole family (mom, dad, 10 and 6 yr. old)really enjoyed this!

I agree rootbeer makes all the difference in this recipe, this is a family favourite. I put bbq sauce on it when I put it in the crock pot and soak it in rootbeer overnight also. So good

I love this recipe, I have tried some variations, like using a can of beer instead of root beer.  It gives it more of a yeasty flavor and I added a packet of dry onion soup mix.

I made this for Super Bowl Supper. I used pork butt instead of the pork loin, Famous Daves BBQ sauce and served on toasted buns. It was great and we both ate way too much.

Quick, simple and tasty! I agree with the majority though, I would not use pork tenderloin (tried it once, realized boston butt was the way to go for us, money and taste wise.)

This recipe was super easy and taste great. I'm not a huge fan of root beer but did not mind the flavor that was left behind. Though I will agree with a lot of users that it did have a unappetizing smell to it while I was cooking it but that did not translate to the taste. I used Mugs Root Beer.

The root beer imparts an odd flavor. You really have to drown the pork in the BBQ sauce to mask it.

Great recipe.  Made this for my wife, 10 yo son and 7 yo daughter.  Used a pork tenderloin, Teddy's rootbeer and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ. Added a little Franks hot sauce for mine to add some heat. Will be making again for our next party.

This is simple and great.  I did wish for a second container of barbque sauce to add for some people sandwiches that like them wetter.  But the pork was great and just fell apart.

Could not be any easier or tastier. I use any kind of pork roast and just trim the fat before adding the bbq sauce. I've used other flavors of bbq sauce and it's still a very good recipe.

This was so yummy! Everyone enjoyed this. I put it on the night before serving and let it cook over night. Instead of draining all the rootbeer, I left some in it and added the bbq sauce and cooked it low for another 2 hrs. I served it with homemade coleslaw (also on this web) and cornbread.

This is the simplest best tasting pulled pork recipe I have found yet.  Somehow, to me anyway, it tastes as if the root beer adds a smokey flavor to it.  I used to just add BBQ sauce to my roasts but this recipe showed me that I was missing a key ingredient for a fast (to prepare) easy meal.

I've made this recipe twice now and have enjoyed it both times, however the second time I think I left it in a little too long after adding the barbeque sauce and it started to get a little dry, but that was entirely my own fault. As per other reviews I used a 4lb pork shoulder both times as well as Sweet Baby Rays for the sauce and I have no complaints on either. The second time around I also poked the pork with a fork and rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting it in the crockpot and will continue to do it this way. Overall I really like this recipe because it is so simple and very yummy!

A+++  I'm a stay at home mom, first time making pulled pork by myself and it was super!!!! easy!  and it came out REALLY good.  Taste good, was scared of making it because it sounded way to easy and saw a few bad reviews, however i will deff. be making this again.  I doubled the recipe.    Only reason i didn't do a 5 star, it might be my fault but it was a bit sloppy?  I'm not usetoo pulled pork being so sloppy but it all goes to the same place right?   Deff. give this recipe a try!

Used trimmed tenderloin and a can of Guinness.  Added a couple of bay leaves, garlic powder, salt, pepper to the slow cooker.  Shredded great and was not dry.  Quality BBQ sauce is key.  Served over coleslaw on kaisers.  Enjoyed by everyone.

Followed this recipe almost exactly, except I used a pork shoulder and cooked 2 hours after adding the BBQ sauce but only because we weren't ready to eat yet. This is an amazing recipe! I made it with a sweet cole slaw and everyone raved. A definate keeper!

I made this twice. The first time, I used pork shoulder like other reviewers said.  It came out so chewy and tough.  It was so hard to shred.  It was so much work cutting the meat and separating the fat. The second time making it, I had forgot I even made this and again used pork shoulder as the other reviews say.  It again turned out chewy and tough.  I finally remembered I tried this a few years ago and remembered not liking it.  Ruined my party.  Had to go get pizzas. Wont be trying this again!!!!!!!

This recipe is out of this world good! Even my super picky 10 year old son ate two sandwiches and loved it! He is a mac n cheese and hot dogs kind of kid. My husband actually made this, it was so easy! It made enough for us to have another meal out of it, it microwaves up super easy and delicious. I highly recommend!

This is a great simple recipe. I would go about 7 hours max. Much longer than that and it'll be too mushy, shorter and it'll be too difficult to shred. Don't cook the BBQ with the meat, just add it in 5-10 minutes before serving. It's much more flavorful that way.

This was delicious. The only thing I had to do differently was using guinness instead of root beer. I'm Australian and I couldn't find and no-one knew what it was. It turned out great with Guinness.

Perfect meal to make when you are so busy you don't have time to cook.  I put this on at 8:30 am and let it cook on low until 4, added the barbecue sauce and let it simmer another 1.5 hours...so easy.  I also pierced my tenderloin with a fork and rubbed salt, pepper and garlic all over it.

I used 2 lbs. of pork shoulder steak, IBC rootbeer, and Tennessee's best old fashioned BBQ sauce. After 4.5 hours on low, my house was smelling like pork so I checked it. The meat fell right off the bone. After draining I let the meat and sauce cook for one hour on low. My family ate it up. Yummy!

I really enjoyed it and look forward to the leftovers tonight! I didn't have root beer so I used one can lemon-lime soda and one bottle of a Mexican orange soda. Both made with natural sugar. I also added a few dashes of McCormick BBQ seasoning blend and some pepper on top of the meat before cooking. I would make this again exaclty the same way. Great!

A friend mentioned using Root Beer to slow cook Pork. Wow she was right. After draining the soda away the pork was a nice color and shredded with little effort. The flavor was sweet and was a nice complement to the sweet and sassy sauce I used. I will use this recipe again.

5 stars for ease. 4 stars for flavoring. I may add some garlic and onions to the pot next time. Honestly, if you like pulled pork-make this recipe! It's such a good base to make your own. I used Sweet Baby Ray's-which we all know is the best BBQ sauce.

I L-O-V-E THIS! and so does my entire family! Its so darn easy and it tastes sooooo good! I wish I could give it 10 stars! I make this frequently along with cole slaw and some baked beans. The biggest thing is making sure you cook it until its about to just fall apart and then buy the best tasting barbeque sauce.

We love this recipe.  I have used boneless pork chops with good results.  I think any cut of pork would be fabulous and may try country ribs next. This is a family favorite!

Yum! This was delicious, and root beer? Who knew? I made several batches of this for a camping-style family reunion and everyone loved it. The only thing is that the recipe calls for tenderloin. Really? That's kind of like taking a NY strip and cutting it up for stew. A little overkill and too tender to start. I used pork butt (shoulder) and by the end it was falling apart and so incredibly melt-in-your-mouth tender. Don't use tenderloin. I served on crusty rolls with provolone cheese and the sweet restaurant style slaw from this site. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce and will try our favorite, the honey-chipotle, next time. Perfect pairing and there were no leftover sandwiches. Thanks!

Just made this for dinner tonight and both my hubby and I liked it a lot.  I used 1/3 of a bottle of bbq sauce, since I thought a whole 18 ounces would be too much, but it really needed some extra.  1/3 of a bottle might be too little, next time I might do 1/2 a bottle or so--a full bottle still seems too much. Next time I may add some paprika or garlic.  I let it sit for 5.5 hours in the Root Beer and an extra hour in the bbq.  I love slow cooker recipes and this one will definitely be a keeper. Thanks for the share!

Made this with a 5lb pork loin (it was on sale) and did two bottles of beer instead of root beer. This was only because my husband hates root beer and I didn't want to have this huge pot of pulled pork that he wouldn't eat. I cooked it for 8ish hours on low with the beer, then drained it, pulled it and added the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce (made a double batch that the night before...is definitely better if you make it at least a day in advance and a double batch was just right for the amount of pork we had). It was a little too moist and had a relatively strong beer flavor, so we took it out of the slow cooker, added more BBQ sauce and finished it on the grill for 10-15 minutes. It got a great, smoky flavor and cooked off the excess liquid more effectively than the slow cooker could have. PERFECT! We will definitely make this again for family and friends. Great taste, very moist, really simple to make. LOVED THIS RECIPE!

I got the nicer pork tenderloin because that was all they had at the market I went to. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it cooked like a roast almost so when I was pulling it apart it wasn't as tender as people talked about in reviews. Still not really sure what I did wrong. Thinking maybe it was the fact that I covered the meat with a little water in the beginning for a few minutes while I ran to get some Dr. Pepper upon realizing I didnt have enough pepsi to use. But it was tasty anyways.

Used a 4 LB pork shoulder and poured and entire 2 liter on top to cover it on the crock pot.  Used 2- 18 oz bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce after I drained the root beer (after about 7 hours).  The meat was fall apart delicious.  Let it sit in the crock with the BBQ sauce for about an hour before serving.  We like it with coleslaw and extra sauce on top.  It was good but I was expecting WOW and didn't get it with this.  Might try it again- it is super easy.

The pork was bland. It needed more seasonings. BBQ sauce was needed, but it didn't really help it.

I was a little apprehensive about using root beer.  It turned out ok but it had a weird flavor and  it smells nasty when you're cooking it.  I was not impressed.

Very good.  I made it with onions, mccormicks montreal rub, and a little salt.  I used 1 20oz bottle of A&W root beer.  I slow cooked on low for 4 hours pork tenderloin of about 3 lbs.  Then drained and cleaned the meat (cut out fat), and added 1 bottle of sweet baby ray's sweet and spicy bbq sauce and slow cooked another 1.5 hours.  Taste is very good.

I followed the advice of other reviews and went with a pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin. We sliced some cabbage and put them on King's Hawaiin roles with the pork. It turned out amazing.

We made this with a 5 lb package of pork butt (boston butt) sliced.  I sliced an onion, thick slices and layered on the bottom of the slow cooker.  Used one can of coke, one can of cream soda, and a cup of BBQ sauce (no root beer in the house), cooked on low for 10 hours.  Then drained, shredded, and added 3/4 bottle of Kraft BBQ sauce.  My boyfriend and I both loved it and decided we would add it to our "company recipes".  Easy and Delicious!

Whoever says you can't make pulled pork with tenderloin is out of their mind. This recipe made a delicious pulled pork, as is. Use the tenderloin! It'll be fine. At about hour 5, I was worried. At hour 6, the pork fell off the bone. I had to scoop the pieces out of the crock pot to drain it. It shredded just fine, and was delicious! My kids loved it, and husband said it was excellent and some of the best pork he's ever had. You have no idea how long it's been since he called my cooking excellent!!

LOOOOVVEEE! That Root Beer really makes the pork tender. I use a shoulder instead- about 6-7lbs bone in and let it cook in the crock for about 8 hours. Flip the pork about 1/2 through. Meat is very tender. I like the sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. My family loves this and always tell me my pork BBQ is the best! :O)

Amazingly easy. I used pork tenderloin (it was tender as all get out and flavorful... I hate pork butt b/c of all the fat & dark meat!), a salt/pepper/garlic powder rub. Then covered with root beer & followed directions. After 6 hours I took it out & shredded it, cleaned the crockpot and throw it back in with a sliced onion and some bacon and peppers (they were on hand). Also used Sticky Fingers Carolina BBQ sauce (Mustard based). Let it simmer for about an hour. AMAZINGGGG. Will make again soon.

This was oustanding!  The only change was to use a pork shoulder, the meat was easy to shred and super moist. Will definitely make again.

Best Slow Cooker Pork Recipe Yet!!  I used 10 oz. of Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce and a 4# Boston Butt Pork Roast instead of the Tenderloin.  Thank you so much for posting...this will be a family favorite.

My husband didn't like this as much as I did because he likes smoked pulled pork, but I can't eat it, I don't like smoked meats at all. I really liked this. The only change I made was to use a shoulder instead of a tenderloin, and mix some BBQ sauce into my root beer. I doubled it, had to use two cans because my shoulder was so big and I wanted the meat swimming in the sauce. It turned out great. In fact I just ate a sandwich of it as cold leftovers. I'll make it again.

This was SO easy and a healthy alternative to the fatter pulled pork version. I used regular IBC rootbeer but I'll use diet next time since I don't think the sugar content actually matters for the tenderness of the meat. The pork pulled apart perfectly. The only thing I would say is that it's definitely more dry than traditional pulled pork, but the barbeque sauce help that! I will definitely make this again!

Made it exactly as they said, using Sprecher root beer and Famous Dave's rich n sassy sauce.  In slow cooker 10 minutes less than 6 hrs, very tender.  OK, not bad, just not the greatest thing I ever had.

This recipe was great! 
It was as simple as root beer, pork shoulder and a thing of BBQ sauce! After my family made their yummy and approving noises while eating I informed them that I just slowed cooked the pork in root beer and then later added sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce. It completely surprised my bbq obsessed stepdad and my mom. 

I would say that this is perfect easy recipe that can feed a big family.Honestly you don't need to make any modifications to get a good result. I did however use pork shoulder since it was one sale.

Cheers!

Used Bulls-Eye BBQ with this recipe, took it to a pot luck and it was devoured.  Everyone raved.  If you're worried, there isn't an overpowering root beer taste to it.

Thank You, thank you, thank you.  This has been our family go to meal this summer. Made this for pot lucks, birthday parties, pool parties and left overs are great if you can manage to keep any for your next meal. This recipe is so versitail and the pulled pork can be used in many different dishes if used before adding the BBQ sauce.

Loved it, but we made a few changes. First I used a dry rub on a pork roast and place it over a bed of slivered onions and poured in half a 2L bottle of root beer to a large oval shaped slow cooker. Cooked on high for about 5 1/2 hours. When done I took the roast and onions out and shredded it into a bowl, added BBQ sauce and some of the left over juices and half a can of kernel corn. Served this concoction on cheese buns and put coleslaw on top. It was so good everybody cleaned their plates!

Made this this past weekend.  Put it in the slow cooker on Low at bedtime Friday, Saturday morning took it out (had to use a spoon as it fell off the bone) and shredded it.  We tossed it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce - then put it in smaller crockpot (I have several)to keep it warm til lunch.  Served it on toasted rolls with chips and macaroni salad.  PERFECT.  Fiancee loved it, kids loved it, I loved it.

Excellent. However don't chose a really sweet sauce. The meat is sweet enough to mellow a tangy one.

Very good! My father said to add salt/pepper/garlic powder and sear the meat before putting in the crock pot. Have no idea if that made a difference or not, but it was delicious. Served on wheat and potato dinner rolls - so yummy!

Was this ever tasty! I found that you can use a less expensive cut and make it delish! I took the advice of others and put chopped onion and two cloves of garlic just cross hatched into the pot, then used Gormet Original Diana Sauce holy moly! so easy to make too!

Cooked the pork loin in the slow cooker for 5 hours in cheap root beer.  Delicious.  (I didn't put on the BBQ sauce because I don't like it, but I'm sure it would be great if you're a BBQ sauce person.)

Just okay to me! I took the advice of others to use a pork butt, and I regret it. The tenderloin comes out much more tender than the butt. My meat was kind of tough and a pain to shred, and that's after 7 hours. Will continue my search for the perfect pulled pork!

Amazing SO Tasty and SO easy don't skimp on the sauce use a higer end not cheap low end. I make this when we go motorcycle riding for our group of 10 guys we hit the road for about 8 hours and when we come back it's a wain the morning and don't get back til 7/8 hours later that day and it's nothing but the sense of YUM when you walk in the door

My family went crazy for this. The root beer doesn't add a real root beery flavor but I believe that something in the root beer helps tenderizes the meat so you don't really need to use an expensive tenderloin.

This was a big hit with my family.  I used enough rootbeer to cover the roast, drained after cooking and then added our favorite Barbeque sauce.  Very good!

I made this recipe for my housewarming.  I had a lot of food at my housewarming but when the guests left and I went to try this it was totally gone.  Now many of my guests have used this recipe and it has become a favorite of theirs and it is sooooooo easy.  You will not be disappointed.

I'm like many others on this site and can't understand how people can rate a reacipe they have changed.  Anyway, I made this exactly like the recipe called for, tenderloin and all.  It is amazing, and so easy.  My husband is a big fan of our smoker and was very skeptical, he loved it.  Will make again and again, might change it up after this first time since the tenderloin is expensive, but only in the cut of meat department.

I make this at least once a month for my family and they love it.  Whenever I've shared it with friends or other family members the've asked for the the recipe.  I use Sweet Baby Rays Original sauce. (in a pinch I've used Dr. Pepper or Creme soda as a substitute)

this is a fail proof recipe. It is always a hit whenever i make it. I have made it with both tenderloin & pork shoulder. I do notice that it smells less "porky" with the tenderloin but the taste is the same. I actually make sure that the whole meat is covered in root beer. Enjoy!

I agree with those who suggested using a less expensive cut for added flavor.  Other than that, this recipe needs no tweaks at all..simply delicious!

Great recipe as-is.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with a little bit of Cajun seasoning mixed in.  It was a hit!  I also used pork butt instead of the tenderloin for 1/4 the price.  Still tasted great!

Great easy recipe.  I tried it using Diana's gourmet Western smokehouse BBQ sauce - Awesome!  It's great it uses tenderloin vs other fatty cut of pork!  Also must have it with "Mom's Coleslaw" recipe found here by Denise..

I am not sure why, but we did not like this at all.  When we came home after it cooked all day it smelled a bit funny and then the taste was too sweet and just a 'strange' flavor.   I have to go back to my old recipe.

This was so easy and delicious.  As easy as this recipe is, I still managed to goof it up, but the end result was still amazing.  I added the bottle of barbecue sauce in with the root beer at the very beginning before I realized I wasn't supposed to do that.  Luckily, I had an extra bottle of sauce on hand to use at the end after I shredded the pork.  Regardless, the end result was delicious and I'll definitely be making this super-easy recipe again in the future.

There could be a lot of factors as to why I don't jump on the wagon and support this.  I felt it was just too sweet or something.  I drained the rootbeer, after, and didn't keep it.  I used Sweet Baby Rays.

Perhaps that was just too much for me.  I thought I enjoy the sweeter BBQ's but combined with the rootbeer, it may have been too much.  

Some wrote they used beer and maybe that combination would be better.

Next time, I'll try beer and maybe a sauce that isn't so sweet. It smelled good!

Can't go wrong! I like to put some onion slices in the crockpot as well. We prefer to use a hickory bbq sauce.

I have no idea why this recipe has so many good reviews.  

The root beer adds nothing to the pork.  I could have just used water or broth and it would have had the same result in terms of taste after adding BBQ sauce.
I added creole seasoning just to make this enjoyable to eat.

I won't make this recipe again.  I will try another recipe for pulled pork.

I've made this twice, and both times it was delicious!  Did you know that they now make mini hamburger buns?  Perfect for potlucks!

This is my favorite pulled pork recipe.  I use A&W root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  It's always a hit.

I used a pork shoulder roast, and a can of diet rootbeer to keep the calories down. It was SO good! I shredded it after 8 hours on low, got rid of any fatty parts, and then put it back in for an hour with the bbq sauce. I have made it before using diet coke, or whatever pop we had in the house, tastes great every time. My husband has been asking for it again, so i'm making it for dinner tomorrow night!

This is teh first pulled pork recipe I have ever attempted. It came out great. I used the tenderloin, and almost an entire 2 L of A&W rootbeer. I used KC Masterpiece Original, and it was great. I toasted my steak rolls, and after the first one was gone, I jumped up and got right to making another one!! VERY GOOD!!!

Delicious! I added one small onion, which I finely chopped and sauteed, then added with the bar-b-q sauce.

I love this recipe. It is simple and easy, which is just my style. Cherry flavored cola works just as well as root beer, I have found. I made it once for a work function and now everyone wants me to make it when we have an event.

This was so simple.  Planned it for a hectic day.  My son ending up throwing it together in a crockpot.  Can't even remember the weight of the roast.  No measuring.  Cut the roast in 1/2 lengthwise and covered with root beer.  When it was done, just drained and mixed in the bbq sauce.  Next time, I may add some liquid smoke to give it a smokey edge and perhaps some garlic powder, just because I like to add my creative twist to most recipes.  That said it was a winner just as written.  Will be come a family favorite.

Wonderful taste!  I love the way the rootbeer tenderized the pork.  Be sure to use a high quality rootbeer.  I sauteed some onions to serve on the sandwich.  I used Nolan Ryan's new BBQ sauce...this meal was so easy and delicious!!

I have made this several times for different events and everyone loves it. Someome always asks for the recipe and can't believe how simple it is. The only change I make is to add a bayleaf and some garlic powder with the root beer. I made it once with Dr. pepper instead of root beer and it was just as good. I usually use a sweet BBQ sauce that has a slight kick like  Cattleman's Original.

This was very good and I would probably make it again with a few modifications.  I used a 4 lb boston butt instead and marinated overnight with a rub and rootbeer with chopped garlic and sweet onion.  Pulled directly from fridge to slowcooker and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The meat was so tender and there actually ended up being less waste than I thought using the butt.  I threw the shredded pork back in the pot and mixed in Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  The thing that threw me off a little was tasting the pork without the sauce...the rootbear gave it an off taste that didn't quite do it for me.  The bbq sauce helped tremendously but I couldn't get the underlying taste out of my tastebuds to enjoy it the way I wanted to.  My family, however, devoured it and thought it was great.  Next time I might try coke or Dr. Pepper and maybe even just beef broth instead of the root beer.  I'm not a huge fan of root beer anyway so maybe that came through on this one.

UPDATE:  I have made this several times since writing the review and I do not marinate overnight.  I just throw everything in first thing in the morning.  Cut up a big onion, salt and pepper the boston butt (have done up to 5 1/2 lbs) and cover with half regular coke and half beef broth.  Amazing this way!

The pork was very good but I have to be honest. I don't think it was because of the root beer. The pork tasted (before sauce) just like plain, unseasoned pork. So I will look for another recipe. But if you need something on the fly this will work.

Delicious and tender pulled pork!

I rated it 4 stars because I did add a few ingredients I felt were absolutely necessary.

The day before I made a dry rub using salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I then placed the 4 lbs. of pork into a large container and marinated in root beer.  The next day I dumped the marinade out and placed the pork in the slow cooker.  I then added a bottle of root beer and cooked the pork for 8 hours on low.  After 8 hours the pork was tender and easy to pull apart.  I returned the pork to the slow cooker, added the BBQ sauce and cooked for about 45 min.  

It was amazing! Pair it with a delicious coleslaw! No leftovers guaranteed.

I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it! I used a pork tenderloin the first time, making it easier to shred. This time I'm using a pork shoulder (I had it on hand) and I am sure it will turn out great too!

Good recipe, Im giving 4 stars because I had to doctor mine up a bit, or maybe I didnt buy a good BBQ sauce.  I love the idea of cooking in root beer!  And the cooked pork before sauce didnt taste like root beer.  I added a whole bottle of sauce and it wasnt enough flavor...was missing for sure.  I threw in some soy sauce, worstechire, mustard, tobasco sauce, garlic, white vinegar and salt.  Was great, my husband and his fantasy football draft friends loved it! Will make again!

Yummy!  ...and the easiest recipe yet!  I used the Boston Butt and it was absolutely perfect.  A three pound piece was easily enough for 4 or 5 people.  I served it with store bought frozen sweet potato fries and we loved the combination.   easy, cheap, delicious!  Try it!

This is an awsome recipe! Simple and tasty. The rootbeer is a great flavor component to the meat and I used a rasberry chipolte sauce instead of barbque.

I also, like many others, believe that a tenderloin is not the right choice of meat for a slow cooker recipe. I used a pork roast. It was done in 4 hours and very nice and tender. I thought the root beer would be "the special ingredient" ... but in the end it didn't add much to the taste. When I pulled the pork, I reduced the root beer in a pan. Then added it to the meat and bbq sauce in the slow cooker. Taste was ok, not fantastic. I also added some chili paste to give it some pep, which turned out to be a good idea! I will try a different recipe next time.

Delicious! Was a big hit at the potluck.  So easy to multiply for larger group. I used boneless ribs because they were on sale and they turned out perfect.  Great recipe and so easy!

This was the most moist pork tenderloin I've ever tasted! I used Kraft Chicken and Rib sauce this time, but may switch it up with something tangier next time around. 

Very delicious on fresh bakery or homemade buns!

I cannot believe how great this recipe is!  I will be making this over and over.  My whole family just loved it.  I did make some changes, only because I have a family of seven and wasn't so sure there would be enough.  I used two cups or so of rootbeer.  It just didn't feel right to put meat on to cook without some kind of seasoning.  So I added a little onion salt, salt, and pepper and a smidge of garlic, just to taste.  Then I let it cook.  After about six hours I went ahead and pulled the pork, added the bbq sauce and dumped some  syrup on top stirred it up and let it cook another hour or so.  It was fantastic!  I recommed this recipe to anyone.  We served it on buns with a slice of onion and a few pickles....delish!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I love easy and I love my slow cooker.  This doesn't get any easier and my kids even loved it!  I have made it a couple of times now and each time I choose a different bar-b-q sauce to mix it up a bit.  Score one for mom.  I have a new recipe to add to my menu list.  Thank you Livie's Mammy.

YUM!  I did what another reviewer did:  poke holes in the meat and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and poured the root beer and cooked on low for 5 hours.  Then I added the bbq sauce and transferred to a skillet so the liquid could evaporate.  It was SO good!

Great and easy recipe.  I used a pork shoulder and seasoned it with salt, pepper, and onion powder prior to putting it in the slow cooker with the root beer.  I served it with the California cole slaw recipe on allrecipes.  Simply delicious and my husband (and I) loved the entire meal.

After having this pulled pork, I don't think I'll ever want to go back to our favorite barbecue restaurant!  Not only was this the easiest recipe in the world, the flavor and tenderness is outstanding!  We used Boston Butt Roast instead of tenderloin.

Wow! This was amazing. I couldnt stop eating from the cooker before it was finished. The only thing different from the recipe was to use diet root beer and salt and pepper on the pork before I started the cooker. I will be adding this to my monthly rotation. YUMM!

Since I do not like nor drink root beer, the only substitution I made was pouring a can of Natural Light beer over the pork tenderloin.  I've tried a couple different flavors of Kraft's barbecue sauce.  My favorite is the Chargrill flavor poured over and mixed with the shredded pork.  Absolutely delicious!  You will not find an easier barbecued pulled pork recipe, and it's only 3 ingredients!

Very good and easy. Almost foolproof. I did use the cheaper pork shoulder.  Also cooked in crock pot 8 - 10 hours. Turned out very tender. Used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce as recommended by another member. It was awesome!

For those of you who said that the root beer didn't render any flavor to the meat, you must have used a cheap brand of root beer!!  I cooked an almost 7lb shoulder cut for 12 hrs on low and after I shredded it, I DIDN'T want to add the BBQ suace...the flavor was perfect without it.  I eventually added it to complete the recipe and it was still good.  I'm making this again tomorrow for my friend's 50th Birthday Party and this time I'm using a 10lber....I'm sure it will be a winner!!!

Unbelivable!!! This is good stuff. I had a 8# shoulder and cooked it on low for about 12 hours. We didn't drain the meat, but just forked it out, let it drain a bit, put it on a kaiser roll, and added our own favorite BBQ sauce. (we had three on hand) You'll not regret making this. Moist, tender and flavorfull!!! We didn't change a thing.

Sorry but I thought this recipe was terrible.  The meat came out perfectly tender but tasteless.  The rootbeer added no flavor to the pork.  Still looking for a great and easy recipe for pulled pork.

Great recipe.  Didn't have root beer so used Dr Pepper and cooked for 6 hours on low.  Stirred in Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy and let cook for another hour.  Perfection.

I will try the lesser expensive cut of pork next time. I always have used pork tenderloin, and after removing most of the outer silver skin, I cut it crosswise into pieces about 2 1/2" long. It's then a piece of cake to shred after cooking. I use a nice dark (real) beer, as well as sprinkle the pork with dark brown sugar, some dry mustard, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and some hot sauce, which forms the basis of the BBQ sauce. Add more after it is cooked and shredded. Yum.

This was very good. I used pork butt steaks because I couldnt find any other cuts. I thought the meat could have been seasoned a little more but it ended up tasting great with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and potato wedges!

Very tasty! I used chops instead of tenderloin and I used a little more root beer - enough to cover the pork while it cooked.

This was awesome!!! I normally don't go in and review recipes that I have tried but this one was such a hit with my family that I thought I should. I like to try the recipe just as it is without making any changes but in this case I didn't have quite the same ingredients so I had to improvise. I used a pork roast instead of pork tenderloin and instead of the root beer, I used a can of beef broth and a bit of water. This turned out so great - everybody loved it and was good as leftovers too. Next time I am gonna try it with the root beer!

Excellent and easy. I do recommend using the pork tenderloin, however. We tried it with pork loin and just wasn't as tender or juicy. ALso after doing it a couple times with root beer, we decided that we didn't really like the residual root beer taste that much. So now we use cola, same amount. Also, single tenderloins that we get here don't weigh 2 pounds. They weigh a little over a pound. That works out well for my husband and me as well. Great recipe and concept!

Didn't have root beer so used diet coke instead.  Very easy to make.  I found it quiet sweet, but not sure if it was the pop or the bbq sauce.  1 kids enjoyed it, the other didn't like it - both are picky eaters.

I usually make a more savory pulled pork recipe but wanted to try this because my niece doesn't like anything spicy.  I used Sprecher regular root beer and cut up a few Vidalia onions and a 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke and cooked on HIGH in the crock pot for 6 hours.  I drained it, shredded it, and returned it to crock pot and mixed it with lots of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and a little of the leftover root beer liquid (that I boiled on the stovetop).  This was a very good recipe.  Definitely on the sweeter side but in NO WAY does this have an overwhelming root beer flavor like some other people are stating.

I live in Australia where we don't have root beer. So, for my modifications I did as follows: Used a pork shoulder roast since it's a cheaper cut of meat and trimmed off much of the skin/fat that would have made the "crackling". Placed in crock pot fat side down and pour a can of Jim Beam & Coke over it (hey, it was all I had in the fridge). Cooked on low for 4 hours and then turned it and cooked for another 4 hours.  Removed the pork and pulled it apart on a cutting board. Actually, it just falls apart. Drain all juice before returning pork to crock pot and adding barbeque sauce and let it cook on low for another 45 minutes  to an hour.  The meat is soooo tender.

Easy and delicious.  Need I say more?  I was very sceptical because my other recipes are WAY more involved, but this one is the best so far.  I've shared it with a dozen friends and they are all amazed at how good it is.  Don't skimp on the tenderloin (but make sure it is plain - not previously seasoned or marinated).  When it goes on sale it is the same price as other cuts and it is FAR superior.  Try it.  You'll like it!

This was the best homemade pulled pork recipe I have found. When I seen that it was made with Rootbeer I was kind of worried. But I took the chance and did it and it was the best !!! Even my 4 year old little girl loved it . It was GREAT ! TRY IT , TRY IT ,TRY IT . I GIVE IT A TEN :)

This sandwich was so incredibly good that I had to write! It rivals what we get at our favorite Southern style Bar-B-Que cafe. It couldn't be easier. I also added a little Crystal Hot Sauce to my sandwich just because I like a hot taste in addition to the sauce. I can't wait to try one with coleslaw on it, Memphis style.

Took a chance with this recipe even though it sounded strange using root beer, but so glad I did. My husband and I loved this, and it was sooooo easy! The only think I'd add (if you don't mind the calories) is serving extra barbecue sauce on the side. Thanks Livie's Mammy for an easy and great recipe.

Very Good!!  My husband was very skeptical about the root beer but ended up loving it!  I used a 2lb pork roast.  We will definitely make this recipe again!  Both of my kids ate it up.

This was a great pulled pork recipe!  I think it was a bit sweet, but that is BBQ sauce.  I think some liquid smoke or tabasco to calm the sweetness would be awesome but this is still a delicious recipe.

I am no great cook, but I am trying to learn and this recipe was easy and very tasty. I added one onion just because i wanted some. My husband's choice of BBC sauce was not my favorite, but it was very yummy no matter what. I just wanted a little bit of a bite. :)

I finally decided to use my slowcooker , and this was my first take on making pulled pork.I followed the recipe as written, but I used a bone in pork shoulder. I  also added minced garlic and a packet of Accent seasoning. I set the timer for 7 hours, the pork was amazingly tender and moist. It tastes even better the next day. this is a keeper

Absolutely delicious!!!  I substituted beer for root beer as we don't like root beer, added some chopped onions and garlic salt.  Then I used Chicken 'n' rib sauce as we really like that one.  I will experiment with different sauces when I do this recipe again, just to try them.

My husband really like this recipe.  I used pork shoulder, which I kind of regret using since there was so much fat on the meat.  But, it was still very good and I would make this again.

Holy cow... or pig!  I have to admit, I was both frightened and intrigued with this recipe.  I did add some salt, pepper, and garlic to the tenderloin while it cooked, but it was amazing!  I enjoyed it equally with or without the barbecue sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I bought a 3 lb. pork shoulder & cooked it in root beer for 9 hours on low, it was a hit with the family. First time for me & pulled pork, I think next time I will cover the whole pork shoulder instead of just using some of it. I used 1/2 liter so it covered 1/2 of the meat and that half was much more moist. Everyone loved it, and so did I. Yum.

Oh my goodness - this was SOOOO good and so easy!!  In fact, it was so easy, I didn't know how in the world it could possibly get the reviews that it did - but figured I had to give it a shot!  Like others, I was worried about the rootbeer and the taste it  might impart - something just didn't sound good about pork and rootbeer - but alas my worry was for naught.  This pulled pork was absolutely tender and delicious and could easily take on any restaurant.  I did add some chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper - just to add some flavors that we like.  I cooked for 8 hours until it was falling apart, then took it out, drained the crockpot, shred the meat and put it back in and added Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce.  I didn't measure out the sauce - just put in the amount that I thought looked right, and how we like it.  HIGHLY recommend trying this super easy but tastefully delicious recipe!!

I made this for my husband's 60th birthday party.  Everyone raved about it and thought I had really worked hard making it.  I used the calculator to change the serving size from 8 to 40, then I doubled the amount of meat and only had about 2 cups left.  Many people went back for seconds so I was glad I had made more than what I thought I needed.  I will definitely make it again.

I used pork tenderloin and cooked for 6 to 7 hours.  It was so tender and easy to pull apart.  Delicious!  The sweetness all depends on which barbecue sauce you pick.  I like it sweet so I used Kraft honey bbq sauce and let it sit with the sauce for about an hour.

This meat is moist, tender, and delicious with no sauce or with any BBQ sauce.  I only had a small pork roast so added two large boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken broth, water, and a couple of beef bouillon cubes.  Shredded them all together before adding generic sauce...delicious!

Made it again last night with a small pork tip sirloin roast (no chicken), water, bouillon cubes, and sprinkled with garlic powder, black pepper and parsley flakes.  Instead of shredding, I sliced it as a roast.  Again, very flavorful and moist...you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Thank you, Livie's Mammy!

It was so simple!!  I made it for a potluck dinner.  I cooked it overnight (easy), used Sweet Baby Rays (as suggested by other reviewers - Thank you!), and I great compliments from everyone who had it!  Thanks for the recipe - I'll use it in the future!

This was excellent. My husband said it was better than he's had in a restaurant. I used Diana Sauce; Gourmet Western Smokehouse. Delicious!

Sooo good!! I'm not sure if I could taste the rootbeer, per se, but it gave the pork a nice crust that tasted wonderful. I used a pork shoulder but I'm not sure it was worth it.

I'm not much of a pork eater, but I have to say that these were AMAZING! We used a can of Barq's root beer that we found in the back of the fridge, and K.C. Masterpiece BBQ sauce from Costco. I used a lot more BBQ sauce than was indicated in the recipe, but I tend to prefer very moist shredded meat. We served up mini sandwiches on Hawaiian King Bread rolls (again, Costco - love that place!), and simply devoured them!

I took a tip from an earlier reviewer and also used Sweet Baby Ray Sauce. After I shredded I put it in a foil lined roaster pan, topped with sauce and mixed it up to get a good coat on all the meat, covered tightly with foil and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. I'd love to try this again. Next time I want to throw it onto a hot cast iron skillet and see if I can make a little "bark" ! YUM-

Nice tender and moist. I used a cheaper cut of meat and it was fine. Didn't taste the overbearing root beer flavor at all as mentioned in another review but was kind of bland. Not awful, not great either

I personally feel that a pork butt or other pork roast is far too fatty w/gunk to pick out, Pork Loin is the way to go. 
We used to do this same thing when I was a Girl Scout leader years ago. Can be done w/a Cola as well. We used to do a big crock pot of ground beef, in a Coke, or a beef roast, torn up for Barbeque, its all GOOD! The easiest recipes in the world and they slurp it up w/great enthusiasm! Thanks for reminding me of this one, love it!

Awesome!! I have made this twice in less than 2 weeks.  It is so easy and my family loves it! I cut the meat into 3 pieces so it is easier to pull apart. I remove all the meat after draining. Pull apart each piece and add back to the crockpot with the bbq sauce and a little water. Keep on warm until all has been pulled apart.

Excellent!!! I used a 2.5 pound pork loin that was FROZEN, straight into the crockpot! On HI for one hour (before I left for work) then turned to low for about 10 hours. Oh, and I didn't have root beer, used a box of fat free chicken broth!

Adds too much sweetness for my taste - but the 6 hours cooked the butt so well that the bones pulled easily with two fingers,  Gonna try beer next.

I agree with MegaG, a cheaper cut of pork with suffice. I used a 2lb shoulder cut. The night before, I seasoned it with a bit of salt and pepper then stuffed it with a few pieces of garlic and onion.  Slow cooked it for 8 hours (while @ work), used Sweet Baby Rays Hot and Spicy sauce and dressed my poboy bun with horseradish mustard and my local deli's coleslaw. DELICIOUS! The horseradish really took it to the next level!

My family loves when I make this.  It’s a good basic recipe.  Makes a great, tender pulled pork no matter what cut of pork you use.  Even is good made with chicken breast. I make this year round.  It’s always a hit at family potlucks and barbecues.  Very easy to make it your own. A keeper!!!

I'm not sure I understand what all the brouhaha is about using root beer. It did not impart any particular flavor to the pork.

Wonderful!  And beyond easy!  Instead of using tenderloin, just use the cheapest large chunk of organic pig you can afford and you'll have a meal the whole family will lick off their plates.  Now I want to invite people over so I can serve this one to guests, it's so good!  Be sure to splurge on great root beer and BBQ sauce.  I used organic, can sugar root beer and the results were amazing!

This is one of the best slow cooker recipes!  I used the bbq sauce recipe from the Barbecue Ribs By: SEEsign on here.  It's my favorite bbq sauce for every type of meat.  The overall flavor of the meat was complex and delicious.  Thank you!

This was just ok.  I was not a big fan of the flavor, it just was not your traditional bbq pork flavor.  My husband liked it, but I don't think I will make it again.  I know there is better recipes out there.

EXCELLENT**** however I changed it up a lil bit. I used a 4lb pork roast, 1 liter of Root Beer, 1 can of dark beer & spiced it up while cooking with BBQ Dry-rub.  drained 90% of the juices, added BBQ sauce & cooked for an additional 1hr.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!   Thank you

Pretty good! Made a few changes though. Seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic first.  Cooked in the root beer for 5 hours and then pulled it apart.  Added the BBQ sauce and some chopped onion and cooked for another 2 hours.  I felt it was lacking texture in the original recipe. By adding the onion it gave it more of a bite.

For the amount of work to make this recipe, the results are pretty good.  Not as complex a flavor as traditional method, but with the barbecue sauce it was pretty good.  I'm going to pass this on to my kids.  I think it is a good recipe for someone that doesn't have time to make it the old fashioned way.

So quick and easy without sacrificing flavor! Mine turned out really tender.  I took the lid off the crockpot for last 1.5 hours to help thicken sauce and also turned it on high.

I made this for the office as lunch, and the staff devoured it.  Used pork butt which gave the recipe a lot of flavor, and bought root beer made with real sugar (NOT the large national brands of soda with high-fructose corn syrup in them).  I'll be making this again & again!  Goes GREAT with Mom's Coleslaw...

Made this on Friday afternoon.  Everyone loved it!  Only cooked pork for 3 hours though. It was tender and well cooked.  Next day my husband added cheese and put between two tortilla shells to make bbq quesadillas.  Yum!

I also use a cheaper cut of meat and sometimes use a can of cola as an alternative.  The pop seems to tenderize the meat better than using broth or water.

This is what I did. The night before, I pulled a 4 lb pork shoulder out of my freezer, let it thaw, threw it into my slow cooker unseasoned and then emptied some Dr. Pepper over it (12 ounce bottle). I didn't have any root beer on hand. I didn't even bother with adding spices to it, didn't put salt, or a lick of seasoning on it beforehand. Why bother, it's going to get drowned in bbq sauce anyway and I was tired.   OMG, easiest dinner to make ever...and SO GOOD! Two thumbs up!

Great recipe and iI agree that a lesser cut of pork will work just fine. I used sirloin cut pork chops, the cheap family pack. I also added 2 shots of whiskey and a TBLSP of green hot sauce. X celent!

I took this to a potluck last week and everyone loved it! I did take the advice of others however and used a pork shoulder roast due to the cost of feeding 30 people. I seasoned the roast first with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and threw in some fresh garlic. It was wonderful! The meat just fell apart and the house smelled fabulous when I got home that evening. Also, I didn't put BBQ sauce on some of it and the flavor was great without it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent!!! I used Hawaiian ONO Seasoning as a rub on the pork tenderloin before I put it in the crock pot with the root beer! ALSO-I used Hawaiian sweet bread rolls instead of buns and topped it with cole slaw, like little Hawaiian sliders!! Simply amazing and it was a true hit with my husband!! :) YUMMY!

I haven't had very good luck cooking in the crock pot, but this was the best! I used a pork butt roast and it just fell apart. Everyone loved it. This is a keeper for sure!

This was amazing - I used bullseye original and at the beginning I used 3 cups of rootbeer and then added some bbq sauce to it. Then I added more rootbeer as time went.   When it was almost finished I drained it and then took the rest of the bottle of bbq sauce and then mixed it with a cup of rootbeer... It was a hit!

Quick and Easy. I had only 1.7 lb Pork so I reduced cooking time to 4 hours for the roast and 1 hour for shredded pork w/ BBQ sauce. Delicious! Ate it for days.

Excellent recipe. I cooked for 6 hours in the slow cooker and then removed the liquid and covered the meat with Hawaiian BBQ sauce and continued to cook it for another hour. It was delicious. The BBQ sauce really made this recipe.

AWESOME recipe; I subbed a beer for the root beer-- we're more of the Carolina type BBQ fans, so not TOO sweet.  It was perfect.

This recipes sheds moist, tender, and absolutely delicious pulled pork.  Everyone at my party was drooling when they smelled the aroma in my kitchen.  They loved the taste.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to enjoy the real flavor this recipe gives to a hunk of pork tenderloin.

YUMMY in my tummmy! I used pork shoulder steaks and sweet baby Ray's original bbq sauce.This is our new favorite! Try it with amish slaw from this site. Sweet rolls or potato buns go really well with this too! God bless for sharing.

My family loved this. Used Sweet Baby Rays. It was a bit too sweet for me ( it was the sauce not the recipe) Will use something with a bith more kick to it next time possibly Jack Daniels Orginal 7. Like others have said you can cut cost with a Butt Roast... No need for a tenderloin. Thanks for a winner.

My whole family loved this recipe!! It was so simple to make yet sooo yummy! I made 3lbs of pork roast and used almost an entire 2ltr or Barqs RB. I wanted the roast to be completely covered in RB. I highly recommend this to any one wanting to cook this. I will be making this again!

All in all very yummy! It had a very mild flavor which is what I was going for. I had lots over to use for other meals and since the flavor was mild I was able to easily make it fit what I was cooking up from the leftovers!

I had no idea pulled pork was this simple!  Easy recipe and it was delicious.  I thought it could use some additional sweetness.  Maybe it was the BBQ sauce I used.  I think next time I will add a little brown sugar or maybe use honey BBQ sauce.  Thanks I will defintely add this to my recipe box,

Amazing recipe. I only tweaked a couple of things. For starters, I'm not a fan of tenderloin so I used boneless rib meat. Turned out wonderfully. The other thing I changed were the proportions. Seeing as I am not cooking for a whole family, I cut the recipe down to 1 lb of meat and used about 9-10 oz root beer. I then added barbecue sauce to taste. Definitely an amazing recipe, I'm going to be making this every time pork is on sale at the grocery.

It didn't smell good, it tasted "okay". Not sure what the rave reviews are about.  I used bulls eye bbq sauce, and barq's rootbeer.  Maybe it was the choices in root beer or bbq sauce? =(

I tried this recipe with venison instead of pork. The meat didn't fall apart after 8 hours so my husband cut it into pieces. Even though he had to cut it, it was REALLY good. I will definately use this recipe again.

OMG, so good!  I used pork shoulder instead and slowcooked it on low for 6 hours, flipping it half way through. When it was done, I dumped it in the sink in a colander and shredded it with two forks. I used a homemade BBQ sauce and served on kaiser buns. My boyfriend said it's very similar to the ones at the Cheesecake Factory (haven't tried them, but I'm sure they are good).  This is a very cheap & easy recipe that I will make again. Thanks!

I made a double recipe for a family gathering and there wasn't a bit left in the pot!!! I only wished I had made more. I used our favorite BBQ sauce and the root beer gave it a touch of sweetness. I will definitely be making this again!!!

The BBQ sauce has to be a good one. I was on a budget and bought something cheap. Next time I will spend a few extra cents for the extra flavor. Thanks for sharing!!

This was a big hit at my family party! I accidently set the slow cooker on high instead of low and it was done in 4 hours. I will definitely make this again and I am sure it is even better when cooked slower and longer.

Split reviews on this. 2 of the 5 of us really liked it. I did not like that i could taste the root beer in the finished product. I will try again and be more choosy with my root beer selection, something with a little more spice to it. I also thought it was too dry. I had to add more bbq sauce and some apple cider vinegar.

Quick, easy, and delicious recipe!  After draining, I added BBQ sauce every 15 minutes for one hour to give it a nice glaze.

This is the only way I will make my pork bbq anymore.  I've tried different cuts of pork, from tenderloin to shoulder, and it is all good depending on which cut you like the most.  I like to mix both tenderloin and shoulder to add the more fatty, juicy meet with the dry meat.

I meant to review this when I first made it, as this definitely deserves a five star rating for ease of preparation and taste!!!  followed the recipe exactly except used a shoulder roast.  Oh, yes, and what recipe requiring BBQ sauce is good with anything but Sweet Baby Ray's - YUM!  Thanks for making me look good at the potluck!!!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I used Jack Daniels Original #7 barbeque sauce and served it on slider buns.  My husband said it was the best pulled pork sandwich he's ever had and wants me to make it again soon.  He said not to change anything in this recipe.  It's superb!

I was a little skeptical about the root beer and I have to admit that my family made fun of me when I told them about this... But the meat was fantastic!!  I added a little bit of pepper to the meat before cooking.  As crazy as it sounds the rootbeer almost gave the meat a "creamy" taste.  This is going to be a favorite in our house for a long time!

I cannot tell you how many times this year I have made this pork!  I have been asked to make it over and over!  I followed the recipe exactly.  We LOVE Sweet Baby Ray's, so that is the sauce we use consistently.  What an easy meal, that is guaranteed to get eaten!

This was the best pulled pork ever! My one suggestion would be to cook the meat for 9hrs. in crockpot overnight. Once cooled you can shred and put back in crock pot with barbecue sauce for 2hrs. Was a big hit with everyone!!! Yummy!

My husband loves making this... and he doesn't cook, at all!!  We use more root beer than it calls for, just to ensure that it's moist.  Delicious.

EASY and YUMMY! I agree that you can use inexpensive cuts of pork.  We used Pork Shoulder for the recipe.  Also, poured the bottle of BBQ sauce along with the Root Beer before setting the cooker and it worked just fine.  If you prefer, you could cook the pork and after add the BBQ sauce; however, cooking it with the BBQ sauce is simple and gives it a rich flavor.  Rubbed the pork with salt, pepper and garlic powder before pouring the liquids.  Great Recipe!  Thanks!

The rootbear really didn't do much to it in my opinion. But overall the recipe is sold. I added a bit of brown sugar to my BBQ sauce which was nice.

I had never made pulled pork which was a big deal since I've lived in the south for over 10 years.  My son LOVES root beer so I knew it would be a hit with him.  And it was.  This came out so tender and yummy.  We let the leftovers sit in the juice which made it all the more tender.  Yummy!

This recipe was a BIG hit at our tailgate this past Friday!  The beauty of this receipe is that you can make as much as you like!  I use a 4lb pork shoulder roast and since it was so well cooked, it was easy to pull the fat off before placing it back in the slow cooker with the BQ sauce.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and made the Sweet Restaurant slaw to put on the sandwiches as one viewer suggested.  All gone!  The only downfall that night was we lost the game!  Thank you for sharing a GREAT tailgate recipe.  You can't go wrong!

okay I've made this at least 3 or 4 times.  First, I use pork butt or shoulder.  I also slice up onion into the bottom of the crock.  In addition I add liquid smoke to taste.  Usually, serve with coleslaw.  You can put it on the sandwich for a nice crunch or eat it on the side.

Really good.  I followed the directions plus I added 5-6 dried red chilies to give it some kick.  It worked nicely.  My husband thought it tasted a little too much like rootbeer overall, though - but it was so darn easy, you can't really complain!

Excellent dish - I like to saute onions in the fat from the juice,  add a dash of tobasco than throw in the meat and add the barbecue sauce. Meat was tender, tender, tender.

Very good but could use a little more zip.  Maybe I'll try a different BBQ sauce next time.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's and may try something spicier.  These were good even the next day.

Very tasty!  I didn't have time for the slow cooker, but I made mine in the over at 300 degrees for 6 hours.  It was amazingly good and I will use this as my go to pulled pork recipe in the future.

This was the BEST pulled pork I  have EVER had!!! I sprayed the pot with pam first - works wonders! Use a 4.5lb pork butt(shoulder), Foxon root beer, and Bulls-eye bbq sauce. Pork cooked on low for 7 hours, bone fell out while I carried to the cutting board!

I've made this 3 times and it's so good!  Each time I've made it a little different and this last time was the best.  The first time I followed it exactly but only added salt and pepper to taste and it was okay.  The second I used more seasonings and it was better.  This last time I used Cabela's Blackened Seasoning, garlic and onion powder.  I also think the sauce makes all the difference.  This last time I used Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse and it was just GOOD.  Served it on some King's Hawaiian buns and MAN it was the BEST!

I used the tenderloin and slow-cooked it on low for 10 hours because of work and school.  It was great!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  I had homemade sweet potatoe fries and steamed fresh green beans as sides and we had a great meal.

Just made this Friday, 8-27-2010. I followed the directions completely. Not only was this good Friday night, but the leftovers were even better. This was too easy to make and so good, that I am afraid that I will be making this once a week! My sister made it Saturday night after I had her try mine. I share this recipie with everyone! Luv It!

just cooked this today in my new crock pot, it was the first thing i ever cooked with it and it was a success! i was drawn to this recipe because you did not need a lot of ingredients, i used a pork loin because they did not have shoulders at the grocery store, i diced some onions, put it on the bottom of the slow cooker, i cut off some fat off the pork and sprinkled it with salt and pepper and then added the root beer, and slow cooked it for 7 hours on low, then i shredded it and added the bbq sauce on it and cooked it for another hour. i hosted my parents for dinner and they loved it and my husband couldn't get enough of it either. highly recommend!!

Made this the first time exactly as the recipe states - it was really good.  Next time I added a layer of coarsly chopped onion on the bottom of the crockpot, put the roast in, salted it with Lawry's Season Salt and minced garlic, poured the rootbeer around it and let it cook for 10 hours on low.  It was so good we didn't even add the bar-b- sauce, just pulled it apart and ate it as a very tasty pork roast.  Both times I used a pork butt roast to make sure it wouldn't dry out with all that cooking.  Good recipe.  Love the novelty of the root beer!

Great with different kinds of root beer but I'm struggling with what kind of BBQ sauce to use.  I think once I get the right sauce, this will be the perfect recipe!

Super easy.  I used a 5lb butt, 2 cans of beef broth, cooked it for 6 hours.  I added the liquid smoke with the bbq sauce and put it in the over for about 40 minutes.

This was certainly easy enough; totally simple.  I used pork butt insteas of tenderloin.   I thought this was good, but it was missing something.   Perhaps I'm comparing it to my favorite Dinosaur BBQ and just can't get their PP sandwiches out of my head!!   Would probably make again but spicing it up just a bit.

This is wonderful, and easy for the busy spouse or parent!!!  I do think it's better with 1 1/2-2 full bottles of BBQ sauce, but then again, I used a 6lb slab of pork shoulder, so perhaps there wasn't enough sauce to go around.  NOTE:  If you do use pork shoulder, cook it on low for 9 hours... the fat will melt off, and you won't get big chunks of it in your sami.  Also, the longer and slower it cooks, the more tender it is :)

I used a 4 lb "boston butt". Cooked it overnight. In the morning I tore out most of the fat and refrigerated it with the bbq sauce. Reheated about 1 1/2 hour prior to lunch on low. Turned out Excellent. Used more sause than the recipe called for. (Kraft Original)

In the end, I split the pork into two dishes and only added BBQ sauce to one. To the other, I added garlic salt and adobo seasoning. My husband, who is Puerto Rican, loved it!

So good I want to make it every week - so easy, my husband can make it. I have used both pork tenderloin and shoulder and they are both great. I usually wait until tenderloin goes on sale and then buy several of them to freeze. I use 2 bottles of Henry Weinhard's Rootbeer and after cooking all day, I pour out all but 1/2 a cup of the rootbeer, and add the rootbeer to the bbq sauce. Makes it extra yummy.

Shocked that this didn't taste good, it smelled wonderful! The texture was mushy, I always follow a recipe exact the first time so I used tenderloin which may be why we felt the texture was off.

Never tried to make puled pork before-the was a WOW. Easy and delicious. I used a boneless pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin. My entire family loved it and I am making it again for my son's annual college buddy weekend-by request!

This recipe is nearly fool-proof! The root beer really softens and tenderizes the pork incredibly well! I cook the pork in the root beer for a couple of hours on high then dump it out and add a chipotle citrus marinade and some vegetables and it turns out fabulous! This is now a staple in our recipe arsenal!

Made this for a large party.  Bought 20 pounds of a cheaper pork cut and trimmed the fat.  Divided this between three crock pots and filled to the top with root beer (bought a couple two litre jugs - needed about one and one-half).  Put it in the slow cookers about 7:30AM, went to work, came home about 6PM. Drained root beer and allowed to cool slightly.  Shredded pork, added Sweet Baby Rays and put in the refrigerator.  Brought it back out a couple days later, back in the slow cookers (two now) and it was soooo goooood!  Everyone raved about the sandwiches.  Will use less BBQ sauce next time.  Will make again.

The pork was very tender after it cooked, but even after I added the bbq sauce, I could still taste the overwhelming sweetness of the root beer.  My family didn't really care for it.

I made this the other night. It was very easy to make and tasty but nothing special. If you are looking for a great pulled pork recipes that is super fast to assemble then this is it. The only downside is all it tastes like is the BBQ sauce - nothing special.

This pulled pork was amazing! So easy and the family loved it. I only added the barbeque sauce to a portion of the pork due to a low salt diet, and was still complimented on the flavor of the "plain" pork. This recipe is a keeper, for sure

This recipe was so easy to make that it tickled me!  And it tasted GREAT!  I brought it to a potluck and it disappeared in less than 2 hours.  The kids especially loved it with the sweet hawaiian dinner rolls. :)

After comparing this so simple recipe to many other complicated multi-stepped ones, we decided to try it.  My 16 year old just ate three sandwiches and said it was "amazing" - after we cooked it - we strained the sauce, separated the fat, and cooked 1-2 down with equal parts store bought bbq sauce - then added meat and heated through.  Served with extra sauce and pickles.  Delish!

The first time I made this, I was in labor with my baby.  It was almost done when we left for the hospital.  I tasted leftovers when I got home from the hospital and they were awesome!  We now make this about once every 2 weeks, and my husband and son fight over the leftovers.  I have used a couple different cuts of pork and they all work very well.  I use store brand root beer (a little more rb flavor than name brand), and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  I recommend this recipe to everybody and will be adding it to my daughter and son's recipe boxes.

Honestly, you can't get much easier than this for a great tasting BBQ dinner.  I put this in the slow cooker in the morning, and it was done and falling apart after about 8 hours.  Served with homemade potato salad and pickles, and it was the perfect dinner out on the deck.  Thanks for such a great, simple recipe!

yummy!  followed the directions precisely, and it was terrific.  i was worried at first that the lean cut of the meat would make it dry, but simmering in root beer all day does a pork loin good.  didn't care for the smell of the porky root beer as i poured it out, though.  :)  once mixed with the sauce, it melted in your mouth.  yum!

I used boneless pork shoulder. This recipe was so easy and delicious. I made it for a BBQ and literally had to save myself some because it was going so fast! I used sweet baby rays bbq, 1 chipolte and 2 reg for 11lbs. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. My only problem was the fat involved. You could see the oily fat layer at the top especially after storing leftovers. Because of this, I don't think I'll be making this again.

The taste was fine but the smell of the cooking root beer had some funk to it, hehe. I'll be making this again and again though. Wifey and the kids loved it and there were no left overs, which is a first for pulled pork. With toasted bread and Wheeler's bbq sauce it was very good.

This was a truly delicious recipe. I've made pulled pork before, and just let it simmer for hours in bbq sauce. This time, you could really taste the difference. My family loved. Even my mom took seconds, which is very rare. This is a new family favorite. Thanks for the recipe

I have cooked this for 4 years now at my annual BBQ and its raved about! Use A&W root beer, and open pit original with shoulder cut with bone in. The sweetness from the root beet really comes through so the flavor combo with open pit and the root beer is awesome!

Cooked mine on high for 4 hours. Pork was tender and had a good taste, but nothing special. I think Id rather follow a recipe than to just use bottled sauce. But I gave it 4 stars for its taste and simplicity.

Very easy and tasty!  It took a little longer than 7 hours to cook the pork but I had two tenderloins in the crockpot.  Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce is the best!

This is amazingly easy and so delicious.  My family loves when I make this and asks for it often.  I did add some garlic but other than that I stuck to the recipe.

The pork tasted great!  You could taste a little of the root beer in the pork and the texture was great!  I will definitely be making this again.  I did use a pork shoulder and poked holes in the pork like another reviewer.  I cooked it for six hours on low, drained and shredded it and then added some sauce and cooked it for about forty more minutes on low.  Loved it.  Thanks!

Excellent! Followed another reviewer's advice and marinated a pork loin (cheaper,, and crock pot tenderizes it just fine) in onion soup mix, worcestershire and montreal steak seasoning overnight. Then into crock pot with root beer. After it cooked, I shredded it and added bbq sauce, back to low heat for another hour to heat through.

My husband, who is usually a "shut up n eat" kind of guy when it comes to foods he likes, couldn't stop going on about this puled pork!  He even suggested I make and take it to our next family gathering!  I loved how easy if was to make!

This was so easy to make.  I did exactly as the recipe called for.  I should have put more bbq sauce and let it marinate for a bit but will definitely make this dish again!  My family loved it.

I am so glad I found this recipe, easy to make, and Oh so good. I realized this recipe is so good I could not taint it with store bought BBQ sauce, I found a great sauce recipe in one of the BBQ Bibles Steven Raichlen called 'Texas Jack Sauce' and it is AMAZING.  This has been a BIG HIT at my party's, I had about 20 people over one day and I made 6 lbs of pork. I was amazed that it was gone in less then 4 hours. I love this stuff.

Super easy recipe. I used a frozen pork tenderloin, turned the slow cooker on high for the first 1.5 hours, then turned it to low! A great week night dinner, couldn't have been easier to make!

Great recipe - couldn't be easier and it's delicious.  I had meat intended for pot roast that I prepared this way instead and it was delicious.  Great for leftovers too - in salads, etc.

Given that there were so many high ratings and reviews, I expected this to be so much better.   The flavor was kind of bland. My family & I didn't really like it. Tenderloin is kind of pricey and it's a waste to use it like this.

This recipe was wonderful! I made this meal for a larger group, and they were all raving at how moist and delicious the pork was. I choose to have different kinds of bbq sauce on the side and let my guests choose. I will most definitely recommend this recipe to others. With summer on the way, I will be making this recipe again very soon. Delicious! =o)

Did not care for the root beer. Left a weird taste to the meat. The second time I prepared this I used beef broth instead of the root beer. I love it. I have found a winning combination. I make Carnitas with the pulled pork one night and pulled pork sandwiches with the left overs the next. You have to try this winning combination!

This recipe was easy, has few ingredients, and is delicious! I came home to the most wonderful smell. I used KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar sauce and it was great! We served it on wheat buns with coleslaw and curly fries, but it was great without the bun as well!

So simple and so good!  I used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin and it turned out so tender.  Next time I might add some garlic powder or a little bit of spice just out of personal taste, but I followed the recipe exactly as written and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  We will definitely make this one again for pulled pork sandwiches!

UPDATE:  Try Dr. Pepper & Chiles in Adobo, or Jalapenos if you like heat.  VERY GOOD!  Country Ribs work well too.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This... was... AWESOME!!!  I did marinate it over night in about a TB of cider vinegar and a rub of chipotle powder, onion powder, brown sugar and salt & pepper.  Used Virgil's (microbrewed) root beer, and needed 2 bottles to cover- I've had bad experiences with pork loin/slow cooker and not fully covering with liquid- After 3.5 hrs on low it was fully cooked so I proceeded with finishing the recipe and then left it on warm for another 3 hours til it was time to eat.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle Honey, and it is quite good for a bottled sauce...  There's a bit of a kick to that one and that MADE it by perfectly balancing out the sweet.  Served on fresh Kaiser rolls with a broccoli/cabbage slaw and loaded baked potato salad with a lovely basil gin fizz my pro-bartender friend whipped up and it was a flippin' FANTASTIC meal- The PERFECT meal for having guests b/c everything was done when they arrived (house smelled GREAT!) and I was able to visit and not be busy in the kitchen other than merely slicing the rolls!  A TRUE KEEPER!!!  I would NEVER have thought of root beer, but it works!

Made a 4.5 pound pork loin and used a 1/2 of a 2 liter of root beer. Cooked on high for 7 hours and it was so tender that it fell right apart. Had surprise dinner guests and was so happy to serve it.

I have to say this was good and I love root beer so I was excited to see how this would come out.  It definitely had a interesting flavor, but I found it a touch too sweet and I definitely could taste the root beer underneath.  The meat was moist and tender, but if I do make this again I will use a much lesser cut of pork.  Tenderloin is expensive and I feel I could of got more flavor from a roast then this had. There was just something lacking, maybe a more smokey flavor or something.  Could not put my finger on it.

I wish I had listened to my gut instinct and used a shoulder or butt roast instead of a tenderloin, but I figured I would trust the recipe and give it a try. Tenderloin is not suitable for making pulled pork! I ended up having to hand pull it when the meat was done cooking, and the white meat was way too tough. I wish I could give it more stars, but although the root beer infusion was an interesting taste, it was still pretty bland.

This has got to be one of the easiest meals and is was SO good.  I forgot to drain the root beer before adding the bbq sauce so it was runny, but still tasted good.  Next time, I may try a spicy bbq sauce just for a little more heat.

This is the easiest and tastiest recipe for pulled pork out there.  We use bone-in shoulder as it is cheaper and works great.

I'm not a big fan of root beer, and I thought the flavouring would be subtle, but it was too strong for me.  Very easy recipe though, but I will try other pulled pork recipes.

This recipe holds up its end of the bargain and delivers tender delicious pork. I used calorie wise BBQ sauce and it was good. Next time I'll make homemade BBQ sauce. Thanx for sharing Livie's Mammy.

This recipe rocked my socks off for sure!  Make sure you have the extra bbq sauce b/c you will definitely want it and make sure not to overcook the pork or it will get very dry.

oh my god i love this recipe! i couldnt believe how simple it was, for such a good dinner, it was a hit! i tweaked it a little...i added a little garlic powder, nutmeg and a little whiskey-also a little more rootbeer than the recipe calls for...also before draining the rootbeer broth i reserved some of the liquid in case it tasted/felt dry...as i was shredding the pork i would add a little of broth at a time! also i left some of the liquid in th bottom of the crock pot, (barely coating the bottom), and mixed that in...at this point taste it, mmm! yummy, then add your favorite bbq sauce, i used jack daniels honey brown sugar! i left it in the crock pot for just like 10 mins on warm, so the sauces can mingle. also i made some cole slaw to put on the bun with the pulled pork! so yummy!

This was great! I made a giant batch and my husband ate it all week for lunch.. The only change I made was it was a little dry so I spooned some of the juices from the crock pot into the meat after it was pulled and mixed it in before I added BBQ sauce. This really helped! I can't wait to try it with some good homemade BBQ sauce instead of the store-bought stuff!

Couldn't be easier OR TASTIER!  Even using my slow cooker, it's great to just put a FEW thing in before work & come home 10hrs later to the good smell inside the front door!  When things I want to try have oodles of reviews, I take ideas from the first 100 and make changes I'd like.  This one I DID AS IS -- that's why I gave it 5 stars!!!  I couldn't taste the root beer, but it was really falling apart.

Good simple recipe. I cooked in the oven in a heavy oven proof pot with lid. 400 degree for 30 minutes then 200 degrees for 4 hours. I believe it was a 3-4 lb pork tenderloin cut in half. Added 10 gloves of garlic to root beer. After taking out of oven I drained the pork, shreded it and served with a Carolina style sweet barbecue sauce.

too wet.  I squeezed out the excess liquid several times, and the barbecue sauce still seemed to be diluted.  Next time I think I will cook with MUCH less liquid.

This ended up being just ok for us.  I didn't think the rootbeer added anything to the dish.  This could have just as easily been made with water or any other liquid for that matter, however the cooking style was great.  Slow cooking a pork roast (I used a roast, not a tenderloin) in liquid makes for amazing results.  Next time I'm going to use water and just season the meat with salt, pepper and some BBQ rub.  The BBQ sauce you choose will make all the difference.  Stick to one you like!

I initially wondered about using the root beer but I have to say my family really liked it -- even my 2 picky 9 y/o boys!  I use Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce and it is great!  I also use a cheaper cut of meat like earlier reviews mention.  I have made this several times.

We cooked this last year, and at first thought it was going to be terrific. But after it sat for a night the root beer flavor was too much, we didnt care for it. Good idea though.

This recipe was so good and very easy to prepare. I used a pork shoulder instead of the pork tenderloin. I will diffidently make this again.

This was really tasty! I used 4 lbs of pork shoulder like some of the others suggested, and it was enough to feed the 6 of us. 2/4 kids ate it, which is pretty good for them! I covered the whole pork shoulder in root beer and I think it was too much. Next time I will use less root beer. All in all this was a hit and I will be making it again!

Nice and tender.  Be sure to add your own spices as well.  I added onion, garlic, salt and pepper while cooking in the root beer.

This was a big hit! I love trying new recipes and this one didn't disappoint.  Much easier than my other bbq recipe that uses home-made sauce.  Of course, you use whatever sauce you want.  I used bottled sauce this time. The meat shredded easily and was delicious. I already have plans to pick up another pork loin while they are on sale.  Oh, and I used a 5 lb pork loin and pretty much doubled everything, I don't think I'd go any smaller than that, it's just too good!

This is AWESOME!!! I'm not sure what I like better the ease of making it or the wonderful flavor of it. I used a pork shoulder, rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder and brown sugar.  I added the rootbeer, cooked it in the slowcooker for 4 1/2 hours. I couldn't help myself from eating it while shredding it. It is very good at this point. It has a nice sweet flavor! I then cooked it about another hour with Sweet Baby Rays barbaque sauce. FANTASTIC!!!! For dinner, I paired this with garlic red skinned mashed potatoes and veggies. This freezes well so leftovers were frozen for lunches and what good lunches this makes!

My sister first made this for a baby shower and everyone raved about it.  We then made it for my son's 18th b-day --- It is always a hit with everyone!  We used a pork shoulder and trimmed off all the fat; more bang for the buck!  I do season the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder for more flavor.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!  I will be making it tomorrow night again, just because!

I used a boneless pork roast. Seansoned it with: salt, pepper, dill weed, basil and crushed minced garlic, added cut up onions, and mushrooms. Poured rootbeer on top of it, and cooked it on low for 8 hours. Shredded it, add bbq sauce, let warm up for an hour or so, and put it in "Kangeroo pita Pocket" Added a slice of cheese before heating it, added the meat and my husband loved it. Easy, simple and very good. Thank you for the idea.

I made this for the Super Bowl and boy was it good!!!! I used a pork shoulder instead of the tenderloin because I was feeding 7 people. I salt and peppered the pork and poured the first rootbeer in until it simmered down in the crockpot then I added the second!!! By the time it was done the meat fell off the bone ,tender and awesome!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is a great recipe!  Easy as can be and you can change the taste up with whichever sauce you are using.  We skip using the buns and just have the pulled pork with some fries and veggies on the side.

Amazing yummy pulled pork!  I ended up using about 6 pounds of pork and then filled up the crock pot with some spices and rootbeer to cover everything.  After about 6 hours on low heat, the pork pulled apart easily and I added barbecue sauce before putting everything back in the crockpot for another hour.  Definitely use a crock pot liner!  It makes for incredibly easy clean-up.

Absolutely exceptional.  I took reader's advice and rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic powder and marinated in Dr. Pepper for about 8 hours on low.  The pork was so tender it was hard to get it out of the Crock Pot without falling apart.  Cooked it for another hour with the barbecue sauce.  Personally, I like to put some extra sauce on the bread (used hoagies) and ESPECIALLY some cole-slaw and a few sliced red onions on the sandwich.  If you havent tried it with the cole slaw, you're missing out.. the different textures and tastes really blend well together.  Outstanding!!

I used a 4.5 lb pork shoulder and 2.5 12 oz cans of root beer and was surprised at how sweet the pork tasted. To me, it was too sweet. I would cut back on the root beer next time.

Great!!! Super Easy. Never would have thought to use root beer, but it was really good. I always cook with beer so this was a good little change. I did add one onion to the meat and root beer. Turned out great!!! Will make again and again.

This is delicious and easy.  My pork tenderloin was about 2.5 pounds.  I used most of the 20 oz bottle of A&W rootbeer.  I cooked the pork for about 7 hours and poured out most of the juice before adding the BBQ sauce.  I kept a little of the juice (probably less than 1/3 cup).  Before I added the bbq sauce I added several dashes of Liquid Smoke-hickory flavor- to the pork.  Then I smothered the pork in homemade BBQ sauce (inspiration courtesy of the Neely's). I modified their recipe by adding some Liquid Smoke and honey and cutting out most of the sugar and scaling down the vinegar a bit. I made the pork sandwiches carolina style with coleslaw.  I also prepared some crispy onion rings to top the pork. Everything turned out really well.  I will definitely make this again!!!!

Lip smacking and couldn't be easier!  My store had 2.5 lb. packages of country-style ribs on sale, so I used those instead of the tenderloin.  I seasoned the meat with 2 tablespoons Williams-Sonoma Coffee & Spice Rub and used A & W root beer and KC Masterpiece Original barbecue sauce.  There was quite a bit of broth and fat that had to be drained off before saucing the meat.  Perfect with potato salad and Texas Caviar (spicy, marinated black-eyed pea salad).

We made this with a pork roast, not loin, and with Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce.  Before adding the BBQ sauce, it tasted like rootbeer flavored meat--I really didn't care for the flavor.  With the BBQ sauce, the rootbeer flavor was overpowered by the sauce.  I have made this before without the soda pop just using a slow cooker on low temp overnight with the same results as what I got from this recipe.

I had 3 kids and 2 loved it and 1 did not. I couldn't believe how good the house smelled. "Like, burnt Marshmallows" I loved it. Husband did too,but did complain it was a bit sweet. I may try using beer next time. It was perfect after 5 hours in the pot.

Great recipe! I made this so many times and everyone loves it. The root beer makes it so moist and gives it a sweet but not too sweet taste. I’m making this again for company this weekend. It truly is a great recipe and so easy!

This was very easy to make. Before placing the meat in the crock pot, I rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic salt. I cooked the meat with A&W Root Beer for 7 hours on low. I drained the root beer, added Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked it on high for one hour. It was delicious. We had enough for leftovers. We will be making this for our guests. Thanks again for such a great meal!

I'm eating this as I type! It's delicious and perfect. Like others, I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce but I mixed the original and the hickory and brown suger. When I started to pull it apart (after 7 hours of cooking) it tasted a bit like dry stew meat but after letting the meal cook for an hour more in the bbq sauce it was perfect. I will use this recipe again but I may use cherry coke instead of rootbeer. Also, I'll use a tenderloin instead of the Boston Butt I used because it was so fatty!

This recipe produces super tender pork.  The meat doesn't really seem to have a root beer flavor to it at the end but it definitely keeps the meat moist throughout the cooking process and it ends up just right.  The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for the meat to finish.  I've cooked it twice now and each time I find myself pulling little bits of the meat off when no one is looking because I just can't wait.    I took the advice of most of the reviewers and skipped the tenderloin in favor of a pork shoulder which I think was definitely the way to go.  A tenderloin just doesn't have the fat (read: flavor) to make proper bbq.  I find that the recipe really hinges on the bbq sauce you use.  The first time we used Picky Vicky Brazenly Bold sauce and it was the perfect combination of heat and spice.  Unfortunately it isn't easy to come by so the second time we split the meat up and tried a few different sauces and though the meat was just right it didn't quite knock my socks off like it did with the Picky Vicky sauce so for this recipe to really shine you need to know your sauce before you start cooking.

Not necessary to use tenderloin - any pork will work fine. I used boneless ribs that were on sale. I was a bit concerned with the amount of fat, but didn't have time to trim before cooking. I was ecstatic to realize that during the pulling step, you can separate out all the fat! First time I made it, never even got to the BBQ step - my daughter and a friend ate it faster than I could pull it!

I thought this was great!  We topped it off with some Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and Loved it!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is to honor my husband who thought it needs something extra to not make it taste so root beerish...

My husband has been asking me to make pulled pork for ages now, but I've been avoiding it because I'm mostly vegetarian.  I used pork shoulders but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter and my husband LOVED it.  Said it was the best he's tasted.  I also served it for our new years party and my son's birthday party.  It was a huge hit and everyone thought it was pretty funny to be asking the "veggie" in the group for the pulled pork recipe!

this pork (i used pork shoulder) was excellent with just the root beer marinade.  it is kinda sweet, so be careful what bbq sauce you add so it's not too sweet...depending on what your looking for i guess.

I was really excited to try this because I love pulled pork, I love Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and I love my slow cooker.  BUT, I really did not think this was tasty.  I followed the directions completely and did not change anything.  For me, I think this may be the wrong cut of meat for this recipe; maybe the recipe needs a bit more fat in order for the flavor to stick to the tongue.  Not sure.  I may try this again with a cheap pork roast instead of tenderloin.

This was SO easy!! I did do it a little different.  I rubbed the meat (all 17 pounds) down with organic garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper, drizzled oil and sherry vinager on it and let it set in the frig for 7 hours. Then I baked it in the oven at 200'F for an hour before turning the temp down to 170'F.  I served this for my family's Christmas (all 38 of us) and it was SO good!!

Not a keeper for me. Pork was too sweet before adding sauce. Once I added sauce, it was hard to eat much because of the sweetness.

Pulled pork is awesome! All the time! After shredding the pork, I returned it to the slow cooker and poured in more rootbeer, let it sit on low for another hour. Mixing it sauce in the cooker drowns out the root beer flavor so add it to your individual sandwich.

We started the pork at 5 a.m. so it was ready for us to eat for lunch after church.  We served with french fries and/or chips and our family of 8 was satisfied.  AND we were able to have any leftovers throughout the day and evening.

Used beer instead of root beer.  I think this was realy good but that a lot of the rating would also depend on what sauce you add - ours was sweet and spicy.  Next time I'll try something different and make sure I have root beer in the house before starting!!

This is really good!  Cooking it in the root beer just adds that little something to it.  I have made this several times for parties and family and it's always a big hit.  Thanks

I made this for dinner yesterday. It was perfect comfort food for a cold Sunday dinner. It was so easy to make and very tasty. I toasted sesame buns with a little margarine and garlic powder till golden brown, topped them with the pulled pork, served with steamed vegis. So easy and so good. They tasted like I spent all day cooking. I tasted the meat before adding the BBQ sauce, it was very tasty and perfectly cooked. As per other reviewers I sprayed my crock-pot with Pam and it was no problem to clean up afterward.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, I'll definately make it again this winter.

The first and most approved recipe suggests not using pork tenderloin, but if you're health-conscious at all I would stick to the recipe. It's true that other cuts of pork are cheaper, but they are also packed with fat and calories. Pork tenderloin is one of the leanest cuts, so I don't mind paying a little extra. This recipe is fantastic, all I add is garlic salt and pepper, and I cook it with Sweet Baby Ray's for an additional hour after I shred it. I've probably made this twenty times!

This pulled pork came out amazing and was very easy to make.  I added some pepper, garlic and onion powder to season the meat first then used the root beer and Sweet Baby Rays original barbeque sauce served it with mashed potatoes and green beans instead of in sandwich form and it was a huge hit! and will definitely make this again soon!

So good and SO simple.  Mine did come out a bit mushy (maybe needs to cook longer?  or less Root Beer?) but still so good.  Will definitly make this again.

This was my first attempt making the pull porked sandwich. I did everything exactly as described except for just after 6 hours I drained the juice, pulled the pork and mixed Tony Roma's Original BBQ sauce and cooked it for another hour. I also poured a little bit of the juice back in as suggested by some of the other reviews. It was a HIT! I even ate a lot of the pork before I even had a chance to put it on the bun...I am going to make this for a party next week...Absolutely 5 STARS!!! Thanks

My Husband and I made these to take for the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving dinner. I wanted to do something for my parents and give them the night off so i cooked a Pork Shoulder roast in Coke all day Tuesday (6am to 9pm). Drained it and took all of the fat out and put it in a container. Wednesday night I put it in a slow cooker with some BBQ sauce and a little vinegar and made the best sandwiches ever. My whole family loved them and even ate some for breakfast and lunch the next day. No leftovers. Will definitely make these again. Marinating in the soda makes all the difference

I made this over the weekend for my husband and I ended up buying a bottom round steak in order to cook (per the other reviews). I soaked the meat in A&W root beer for approx 20 hours ( I left it in all night and day while at work). I then mixed in the BBQ which was Sweet Baby Ray's. I liked it but I was not particularly fond of it. Due to this I have decided that I am going to try and make it again, use a different meat and different BBQ. Maybe I will get a taste that is more to my liking. Otherwise this is a really good recipe and will be good for an on-the-go meal~

This is the best ever. It is so easy and everyone in my family loved it. The best part is how simple it was. I doubled the receipe and with the left over pork that I didn't add the BBQ sauce to, I made pork tacos.

Since we've gotten married, I've started a Sunday Slow Cooker tradition.  I've been dying to make pulled pork for my Husband since he loves it, and decieded to take a chance with this, even though I was skeptical of the rootbeer base .... the result .. AMAZING!!  I used 3 cans of A&W rootbeer, 1 1/2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce and a little of a spicy BBQ sauce we have .. and it was soooo good!  Highly recommended!!!

I loved the root beer as the marinade!!  I used a 4.5 lb boneless pork shoulder and 6 hours on low heat was not enough time.  I ended up pulling the pork apart by hand because it was so tough... Once it was all pulled, I put it back in the slow cooker with 2 bottles of bbq sauce and turned the temp up to high for 1 hour... it came out AMAZING!!!!  Next time I'm cooking for a big crowd I'll allow at least 8 hours for the pork to get soft.

This was good and SO easy! I used Big AL's BBQ sauce from the site (my go to sauce) and it was a great addition. Being from NC and with an abundance of great BBQ I couldn't give it the best, but it was good and definitely worth a crock pot day! Thanks for the rootbeer inspiration.

Not great...at all.  Based on the other reviews, I tried using a pork shoulder.  It was totally chewy and really hard to shred...even after all day in the crock pot.  I could not tell a difference w/ the root beer either.  Maybe next time I'll try the tenderloin, but it was SO expensive.

This definitely gets extra stars for ease, except for cleaning the caramelized tonic (pop/soda/whatever) out of my crock pot, of course!  I bought a shoulder instead of the tenderloin and did a light rub of Cajun spices before hand, though I don't think it needed it and wouldn't bother next time.  I flipped the knob to low and took a nap but when I got up I realized I hadn't plugged in the cooker!  I cranked it up to high for a few hours to compensate.  It was a bit of a struggle getting the meat off the bone -- don't know if that was due to the high heat or what -- but it was definitely tender.  After draining the root beer and fat I had to hand-shred the meat and then mixed it in with some very spicy BBQ sauce (Stubbs Spicy) and added a splash more root beer to mellow the heat.  Served it with tart slaw and a sweet baked beans and it was very good.  I'll be making this again soon for a football party but will use a boneless shoulder if I can find it, won't bother with the rub, and will use the proper setting.  The sauce you chose really makes this recipe, I think.  The tonic just keeps the meat nice and moist while cooking.  Thanks for a super-easy recipe!

I love pulled pork and this was my first attempt at making this.  I wasn’t sure about the root beer but surprisingly it worked out really well.  I think next time I might try ginger beer and see what I get.  For the sauce I used a chipotle bbq sauce and I thought I died and gone to heaven.  This was so easy to do and will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Sooo good & sooo easy! No need to buy a tenderloin, I used a cheaper cut - boneless pork ribeye roast I think. It was so tender it was falling apart!! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbeque and returned a little of the drained rootbeer-cooking-liquid and warmed for another hour. Husband requested as a weekly meal! Sooo good!

I made this for a Halloween party that we attended this year.  Everyone was bringing soups and food that could sit in a crock pot and be served whenever everyone felt like eating.  I decided to bring this, so that we had something a little more substantial.  Everyone LOVED this pulled pork!  I used pork shoulder, rubbed it in garlic, salt and pepper and browned it prior to putting it in the crock-pot.  I made two whole roasts, so the cooking time was much longer, and after we pulled the meat we just put it back in the crock and skipped the oven step.  I have made it twice since then, and I have people calling me for the recipe!

This was fantastic! After the pork was cooked through, I drained the rootbeer, shredded the pork, and then added the bbq sauce. Everyone loved them! I used the leftovers to make pork quesadillas the next day, and those were also great!

Yum!  The pork just fell right apart.  It tasted great.  I didn't have to fuss with it.  I added just a dash of liquid smoke to the pot, but I don't know that it made any difference.  I used our favorite barbecue sauce, I only used just enough of it, you don't want the pork swimming in BBQ sauce.  Then I let that sit on low for another hour or so.  Then you put a little BBQ sauce on the bun, spoon the pork onto it, and YUM! The pork was super juicy and tender.  We'll definitely have this again.  We used pork tenderloin because it was on sale for a really good deal.  I might also try this with another cut of pork, or maybe pork chops without the BBQ sauce.  Anyway, the rootbeer + pork idea works great.

Awesome!!!  I choose this recipe after reading all the positive reviews.  This was my very first time making pulled pork and let me tell you it came out perfectly, I couldn't believe it!  I too like some of the other reviewers used pork shoulder, followed it exactly EXCEPT I added hot sauce to give it an extra kick. Let me tell you if I can cook it and it come out so good that my boyfriend (King Picky Eater) asked for seconds anyone can do this!  I'm Brand New to the site (and to the kitchen for that matter) but can't wait to see what other easy, tasty recipes I can find.

I thought this was really good and very easy to make. My only complaint is that it was a little on the too sweet side.

This was soooo easy.  I used a 5lb boneless pork butt; cooked it overnight for 10 hours; shredded it and mixed in BBQ sauce (but did not use the whole bottle) and reheated it in the slow cooker 2 hours before serving.  Served it with Mom's Cole Slaw from this site.  Great meal.

Wonderful recipe.  It was so easy to make.  When adding the BBQ sauce I suggest a really smokey sauce. It balances nicely with the sweetness of the root beer.  My entire family loved it.  I would never have thought to use root beer.  Thank's for the out-standing recipe.

Delicious!  I didn't have root beer, so used a Diet Cherry Coke.  My cut of pork had quite a bit of fat, so I drained it, then mixed in the Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicy sauce (that is good sauce!)  So easy- I will make it again soon.

This recipe is delicious! Unbelievably simple and effortless. Even shredding the pork afterwards doesn't take long. You can't taste the root beer at all. I used Lock's BBQ Sauce for a homemade sauce flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

Ok, this is seriously the best pulled pork I have had. I used Pork spareribs, instead of tenderloin, layered 11lbs of it into my slow cooker, seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, and A&W Root beer. I started the Nesco at 3PM and let it cook throughout the night, and at 7AM the next morning, I shredded it and added sweet babyrays. I then let it cook for about an hour more, letting the flavors really meld together. My husband took it to his work, where they ate it on wheat hamburger buns, and when everyone asked me what I did, when I responded rootbeer, they were very surprised. A very good recipe. One thing I would recommend is to watch the liquid content, because as the meat cooks, it releases liquid, and when I opened my Nesco this morning, it was to the rim with liquid, almost overflowing. :) Sooooooo good.

This was yummy! I am not sure what the root beer does, because I couldnt really taste it, and I am sure the recipe is completely different depending on what bbq sauce you use, but I will be making pulled pork this way again. We used head country original sauce.

I made this for New Years last year and it was to die for.  The meat was so moist.  I made a bigger piece of meat and doubled the root beer.  The meat doesnt even taste like root beer but it moistens it so nicely and adds a tiny bit of flavor.  This is my "got to recipe" for pulled pork from now on.

I was skeptical, but my need for a new way to do a tenderloin, combined with just happening to have a can of root beer at the back of the fridge made me give it a try.  I winced a little as I poured it in, but it turned out nicely.  A really different flavour.  All this talk about pork shoulder -- maybe I'll try that next time.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. The flavor was just okay. The thing I didn't like the most was the sauce was way too runny. We like our sauce on the thicker richer side.

Very good.  I will note I added some liq smoke and tossed a sliced onion in while cooking.  I also, like one suggested, cooked 6hrs; drained/shredded; added BBQ and cooked 30 min.  Try serving on garlic bread slices and with Alyson's Broccoli Salad   =)  yum

This recipe was very good.  I cooked it for only 4 hours on high in the crockpot since I didn't have time to do the 7 hours recommended.  Maybe it would have been better had I cooked it longer at a lower temp.  Overall, it made a good sandwich and was EXTREMELY easy to make!

I was really excited about this recipe but truthfully, I thought it was just okay. I didn't use a tenderloin cut and actually wanted to use pork shoulder as others suggested, but couldn't find any so I used a more middle-ground cut of meat. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, which I have used many times and love. Something about the pork just tasted weird to me - almost like the rootbeer was burnt rather than carmelized (although nothing was burnt.) I won't write home about this one :(

This came out sooooo tasty and who would've thought rootbeer?! I used 4 pounds of tenderloin, (1) 20 oz. bottle of rootbeer,and after draining added 2 bottles of walmart brand honey BBQ sauce. I then added some dashes of hot sauce, salt and pepper, onion powder, and chili powder. This was so easy and so very tasty! I will make many more times!!!!!

I make this a lot! And has become a family favorite. I also use cheaper cuts of meat.  Sometimes I dice up a onion and a green pepper and throw them in there too!!  I recommend eating topped with cole slaw mmmmm...

I used a pressure cooker and would highly recommend it if you are bent for time or want to speed the process up. I started off with putting a dry rub and letting it sit overnight. I used spareribs because its what we already had in the freezer and used a bottle of beer instead of rootbeer. I cooked it in the pressure cooker for about an hour on low heat. It came out tender and juicy. Then stuck it in the oven with some Sweet Baby Ray's!  FYI - I definitely won't be using spareribs again because getting all the fat off was a huge hassle. And I don't think I will use beer next time. It gave such a foul odor when it was cooking and you could faintly taste it in the meat. Weird taste. I'll probably try broth and see how that goes. Overall, everyone really enjoyed it~

I used country style pork ribs because they were on sale and I bought a family size package for under $6.00. I cut the meat away from bone and some of the fat off before throwing in crock pot with rootbeer. Drained liquid, shredded and added a bottle of bbq sauce.  This has got to be one of the easiest, cheapest and best tasting recipes around.  Just threw some on hamburger buns with thinly sliced onion and pickles.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July gathering and it was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!  The only thing I changed was to substitute regular beer for the rootbeer just because it's what I had on hand. I used regular Kraft BBQ sauce (it was on sale for a dollar) and it was DELICIOUS!!  Will be making this recipe again and again and again!!

I made this the other night for company.  It was fantastic.  I did use pork tenderloin and followed the recipe as written.  I did make it up the day before serving then just put in the crock pot on warm.  It was ready when we were for dinner.  My guests loved it.  I served it with the Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad from this site (added broccoli).

Yum! Really good. I cooked mine for 7 hours and I think it needed one more. Couldn't shred it with a fork I had to cut it. But still tasted great in the end.

My husband and mother can't stop talking about this pulled pork.  I am making it for a second time in as many weeks to keep them happy!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce because that's all I'll ever buy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe instead of a similar one that I've used before that uses water instead of the root beer. I made the mistake of not seasoning the pork before cooking it, and added salt and pepper 1/2 way through cooking time because it was very bland. Just OK. I didn't find that the root beer added any extra flavor.

This was pretty good, though I would recommend using a different cut of meat, perhaps a smoked shoulder.  I used two tenderloins, and they almost got cooked too much, in my opinion.  The flavor was ok, though too sweet for my taste.  If I make it again, I'd add some tabasco or something, to cut the sweetness a bit.  My family liked it, though.

This is so easy.  I used a 3 lb shoulder roast as per suggestions.  I used a can of rootbeer and then a splash of coke just to make sure there was enough.  I also sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on it too.  Shredded easily and tasted sooo good!

Hubby & I really liked this.  I used a 4# Boston Butt (pork shoulder roast) per some of the other reviews.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  We served it on toasted buns with corn and tater tots.  I let the roast cook for about 10 hours while I was at work.  Then I drained it and shredded it and added the BBQ sauce and let it cook for about another 1 1/2 hours or so.  We will definitely make this again!

Good pulled pork!!! Made this for my bf & I this past wk. I had to zoom off to a networking event (I am "in transition" as they call it...). I went to McD's w/ my friend & my bf had this for dinner! I just made a sandwich w/ the leftovers & wish I would have had this hot out of the crock pot instead of a cheap fish-o fillet sandwich & fries (hehe!)!!! I ended up mod. this a bit to suit my/our tastes. Here's what I did: a) rubbed tenderloins (purchased (2) 1 lb. tenderloins on sale for $2.50 ea.!!!) w/ 2 T dried minced garlic & b) sliced a med. onion & added it to the sc w/ the pork. B/c I had to leave b4 everything was done cooking (cooked on low for 6.5 hrs.), I had my bf drain/shred the pork & add the BBQ sauce (we used a bottle of generic brand hickory flavored sauce that I wanted to clear out of my fridge) when he got home. Next time, I'd like to add BBQ sauce about 1 - 1.5 hrs. b4 the cooking time is up so that the flavor permeates thruout the meat & the sauce thickens a bit (I'd also like to try mix. sauces like Nandabear did). One thing to note: If you do not care for RB, do not worry. The taste is nonexistent (IMHO). You could easily sub. any dk. colored carbonated bev. w/ great results - try Dr. Pepper! You can also use pork butt/shoulder instead of tenderloin if you are on a budget (tenderloin tends to be more expensive). Served on onion rolls w/ bread & butter pickles, kettle chips & the rest of the RB to wash it all down! Tx. Livie's Mammy :)

What makes this so good is the tenderloin - yes it is expensive, but very low fat and low cholesterol, without making any sacrifice in flavor!  Admit it - you need to cut the fat and cholesterol, especially after discovering banana cake vi!

Excellent idea! I had leftover ham from Easter dinner (it was still uncooked) and this was the perfect recipe for it! I had it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and the meat that was not submerged in the soda got a little black. Next time I won't leave it in so long or I'll use two cans of soda so all of the meat is submerged. I used the Jack Daniels No. 7 Recipe BBQ sauce. Delicious!

I followed the recipe pretty much as written.  I cookied in the slow cooker for a little longer, and instead of adding salt and pepper, I used McCormick's Mesquite seasoning.  It turned out spectacularly and I will definitely use it again!

I used a pork shoulder at the advice of my butcher and it turned out great.  A tenderloin would have been good too and worth spending the extra money if you want a leaner cut of meat.  After the meat cooked and was shredded, I let it soak in the sauce on the "warm" setting for an hour or so which really helped the flavors combine.  An easy weeknight dinner and a great alternative to burgers for a casual summer get together.

This was sooo delicious. My grocery store didn't sell pork loin in anything less than 6lbs so I tripled the recipe. It resulted in a large crock pot FULL of pulled pork.  The only reason I didn't give this a five was because the smell of the pork and soda when draining the liquid was so terrible. Even away from home I could smell it all day long.

This was pretty good, but I think it would've been better if I would've chosen a different bbq sauce. I used Famous Dave's original. I would've preferred something spicier or smokier.

This is a great base recipe.  I used a pork butt & added a few drops liquid smoke,  salt & pepper and roasted it covered in the oven all day at 250.  Also put meat on bed of sliced onions, some garlic & a jalapeno or two. Uncovered toward the end to get nice color on the meat.

This was the juiciest pulled pork I have ever had.  Awesome.  I used Mug rootbeer, and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Bourbon BBQ sauce.  Next time I will use a sauce with more tang, since the rootbeer is already sweet, but other than that I am hooked on this recipe!

I too, was very hesitant on  the dynamics of adding rootbeer to pork. after slow cooking the pork roast, rootbeer for 7 hours, I was pleasantly surprised with the end result! Pork was nice and tender and pulled aparty very nicely! My family likes bbq on the sweeter side so I used Hunts Hickory with brown sugar. YUMMY!!! THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!!!

I made this for a large party and everyone loved it.  Had a lot of requests for the recipe.  Sweet BBQ sauce works best with the rootbeer.  If using a spicier sauce, try using beer instead.

This was surprisingly good! I have used other more complex recipes for BBQ Pulled Pork, but Ihave to say, this was comparable and very easy! I used this resipe in a beginners (kids)cooking class...the overall concensus was "AWESOME!"

This was my first time using a slow cooker and it turned out perfect!!! I used a beef eye round because my boyfriend doesn't like pork but it was still delicious!  The only thing I did different was browning and seasoning both sides of the beef before I put it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours with the root beer, who would have thought?  I love Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce so on someone's recommendation I used the Hickory and Brown Sugar, and my boyfriend and I ate it all up! I will definitely make this again!

This was phenomenal!  Used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin.  Unbelievably tender and moist!  After draining and taking out the bone and fat, added a couple tablespoons of liquid smoke before the BBQ sauce and simmered (warmed) an hour longer.  Very nice flavor.  Effortless.

I made this with pork chops.  It was ok.  I would consider making it again.  There was a strong root beer flavor to it (I marinaded meat in rootbeer overnight), and I'm not a big rootbeer fan, so that's probably why I think it was just ok.  DH loved rootbeer and enjoyed it.

Used a 4 lb pork roast so added 24 oz rootbeer.  Only had 1 jar bbq sauce, after shredding pork I put meat back in crockpot and added bbq sauce to rootbeer.  Very good.  Next time would double bbq sauce.  Sandwich good with coleslaw on top of meat.  Keeper.

I have been looking for an easy pulled pork recipe, and have now found it! This was so easy and wonderful. I turned the slow cooker on at 8:00am and got home at 5:30pm.  The meat just fell apart on the touch.  I used Jack Daniel's original BBQ Sauce, poured it on and got it hot again.  I was eating by 6:30

This is excellent. The meat was so tender it was a breeze to shred them.  Use Boston Butt meat, cheaper and original meat for pulled pork sandwich. I use BOURBON WHISKEY BBQ SAUCE from this site, it is wonderful.

I have made this twice now.  My husband and exchange student loves it.  I did figure out that it takes 8 - 9 hours on high for 6 lb. butt roast to cook.  I also used diet rootbeer the second time and there was no difference.   Thank you for a great and very easy recipe.

Really delicious!!!! All of my guests loved it. I changed it a little because of other user's suggestions. I cooked it in slow cooker for 5 hours and then shredded the pork and added sweet baby ray's sauce. I cooked it for another hour and served the sandwiches with sour cream and cheddar mashed potatoes

I have tried many pulled pork recipes. This one is my favorite but it's still not the best pulled pork I have ever eaten.  I think it would be pretty close if it had a little more flavor.  I think next time I will follow some other reviews and start with a dry rub.  I would definitely recommend this one!

Very easy. I substituted CocaCola because I have an allergy to an ingredient in Root Beer.  It was still tender and tasted great.  We use different barbecue sauces to vary the flavor.

So simple, I'm amazed.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ.  Excellent!  
I do wish I had added some onion or something though - it is really a basic "here's the meat part of the meal" recipe.  You definitely have to have veggies on the side for a real meal.

Great recipe!  I was a little weary of the root beer at first, but it works really nicely. I deviated from the recipe a little by adding a dry rub first (cayenne pepper, chili powder) and it came out really well giving it a sweet and spicy flavor.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's honey chipotle sauce as suggested and it didn't dissapoint. Next time I will add liquid smoke though.

This was  great! And so super easy. I did  put a dry rub on it the night before. Then cooked it for 8 hours on low. I also used a pork shoulder instead of tenderloin and it was just as good.

Thanks to the root beer, I think this would be fine even without the barbecue sauce -- or just pouring the sauce over the pork.  (I took out the root beer, shredded the pork, and then mixed a tiny bit of the root beer back in.) My husband loved it, said it was better than local barbecue restaurants.

I hate to rate recipes that I have altered, it doesnt seem fair to the posted recipe. I did not use the pork tenderloin, just because of the difference in the pricing. Turned out delicious! Used about 3 times the amount of root beer called for since my pork was so much bigger. Turned out fantastic, and with the amount of meat, ended up with enough for two meals, just put back in slow cooker for the second day and was even more moist and tender.

I made mini pulled pork sandwich appetizers with this recipe for my Christmas party.  They were so cute and tasty!!  I used regular pork loin instead of tenderloin and it still came out very very tender.  I chose Sprecher RootBeer (my fav) and Sweet Baby Rays "Sweet and Spicy" for a little kick.

This is so good and easy!  My son is begging me to make it again and my husband ate most of it.

I will definately make this again!  Lightly toasting the buns really makes this meal perfect.

Excellent and EASY!  I put a 3 lb. boneless pork shoulder in the slow cooker, covered 3/4 of the way in root beer, and cooked overnight (from about 11PM to 6AM).  Woke up, drained the juiced and rootbeer, and the pork shreeded apart with ease!  Added some nice bbq sauce to it and it was delicious!  I kept "taste testing" it at 6:30 in the morning it was so good!  Thanks!

I made this for a family get together and it was a hit.  I did increase the amount of pork for 15-20 people.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was I cooked and pulled the pork the day before put the bbq sauce in the slow cooker then put it in the fridge overnight, then let it cook on low til it was hot.  Turned out real well.

This turned out very good!
I used pork tenderloin and Coke (no root beer), cooked on low for 7.5 hours, shredded, added BBQ sauce and back into the slow cooker for another 40 minutes.  
I added extra sauce to my sandwich. I'll definitely make this again.

I agree that you don't need to use prime cuts for good pulled pork. I used a rump roast and it was soooo good! We didn't have any leftovers and that hardly ever happens around here. I normally cook my meatballs with cola soda, and the rootbeer with this was a good tenderizer and taste enhancer. I think I'll try cola next time just to see the difference.

I had this tonight at a church gathering and it was absolutely delicious!  The hostess used a pork loin & KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  It was lip smackin' good.  I can't wait to try it at my own home.

Great results and just plain easy to make.  I browned the meat before placing in the cooker just for some texture but wow the root beer who would have imagined. Very original.  My son loved it.  Trying to feed a three year old can be difficult at times but he scarfed it down.  Had to serve him twice.

Excellent!  I also added a minced onion & minced garlic rub for extra flavor.  Used Space Aliens BBQ sauce.  Didnt think clean up was too bad, just rinsed & soaked crockpot immediately after cooking.

Very moist!  I almost ate it without adding the bbq sauce.  I used a butt roast.  I think it was too fatty for my tastes, I will use a leaner cut next time.  I used 2 12oz bottles of Amy's Organic BBQ sauce.  It was great served with sweet potato fries and onions on a whole grain bun.  The kids were not very keen, but us grown ups loved it!

Fantastic!  The only change I made was that I used a Pork Butt instead of tenderloin (I just had remove the bone before shredding).  It was perfect and enough leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day.

I had a party of 40.  I used 9 1/2 pounds of pork loin purchased from Sam's Club.  I added garlic powder, salt,and lots of pepper, and plenty of Sweet Baby Ray's.  Will definitely make again for the next party.  Was a huge hit and SOOO easy!

Simple and delicious - definite 5 star recipe.  I was a little hesitant to consider because of the root beer, but it turned out perfect.  One thing to note - definitely make sure you don't make the mistake I did of adding the BBQ sauce before removing the pork from the bone.  Or you'll end up mad at yourself for the big mess.

wow - We were a little skeptical with the rootbeer until we sat down to eat.  Great taste and super easy to prepare.

This turned out great.  I used a Boston Butt instead on the tenderloin.  I rubbed in a little garlic powder and onion powder on both sides.  I poked a few holes in the meat and poured in the root beer.  Cooked on low for 10 hours.  I could not taste the root beer at all.

Know one could get over how phenomenal this recipe turned out. I simply followed the instructions then I added some onion powder, garlic salt, and jalapeno juice. If I could rate this recipe 10 stars out of 5 I would have!!

This turned out amazing. I did rub the roast down with some salt/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder before adding the root beer (I used organic) and then topped it off with Sweet Baby Ray's as suggested by other reviewers. The second best thing behind the taste was the ease of cooking it. Throw it in, pull it apart six hours later! I highly recommend!

I used a 4 lb pork roast and made the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce from here on AR.  I didn't have any root beer so I added 2 12oz bottles of beer.  A ton leftover which I'll freeze...very good and simple!

OMG! This was so incredibly good!  I did use pork tenderloins as the recipe stated and topped with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  My kids thought they had died and gone to heaven - it was sublime!

This was so simple! It was very tasty and cooked perfectly. Four stars because the root beer wasn't just an undertone you could pick out the exact flavor. I guess I thought it would be a little hidden.

This stuff is fantastic and I'm picky about pulled pork!  I used a 6 pound rump roast, sliced an onion and layered it on top and bottom and added some water because the root beer didn't seem to be enough liquid.  After 10 hours of cooking it was falling apart just as it should.  I will be making this again and again.

I was really disappointed, but my husband liked it, so I gave it 4 stars. I used a 4 lb. Boston Butt, and it was so fatty, I had to cut away a good portion of it. The meat did have a good flavor to it though, thanks to the root beer and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ.

I didn't add anything extra to the pork before placing it in the crockpot and it still tasted great when it was finished.  Very easy and tasty.

Excellent!! I did not use the root beer because I didn't want it too sweet, was looking for middle of the road because I was having a little party of five of neighbors & didn't want too sweet or too spicy so I used pork sirloin rib end roast 4.17 lb.(butcher's recommendation) with 1 cup of water.  I put it in the slow cooker, high for two hours, low for five hours, pulled the pork (super easy with a fork - I am a total novice), drained and put the meat back in the slow cooker with two bottles Bullseye original barbecue sauce.  I served it on potato rolls (central PA) with cole slaw & everyone loved it.  I'm very happy since this is the first time I've tried pulled pork.  I will most definitely make again!

Excellent, delicious and oh so easy recipe!  I've made it twice now for summer (in the Carolinas so our summers start early!), weekend gatherings.  Our friends just can't get over the fact that it's prepared in a crock pot!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  You cannot get any easier than this!  It was tender and juicy.  I used the listed cut of meat and it was great, didn't switch to the Boston Butt.

This is very good.  I tried it with a store bought BBQ sauce that was on sale not what I usually use.  I will make again with my regular BBQ sauce and see if I would then give it 5 stars.

This recipe was great!! I could barely take the meat out of the crock pot because it was falling apart. At first we could taste the rootbeer, but when we put some Sticky Fingers sauce in it, turned out perfect!! Thanks.

Great recipe. Loved it! But how do you pull pork? Really!?!? You would think a girl born and raised in Iowa would know!

My son can't stop begging me to make this again. One hint: Look for Sticky Fingers sweet barbecue sauce. In my opinion it is better than any sauce we have ever tried.

this is my first time making pulled pork and I was looking for something easy.  Well, it could not get easier than this recipe!  My kids LOVED it and it will make a nice addition to my dinner routine.  Worth a try!

This was very good, but a little too sweet. I did add some more BBQ sauce, which made it a lot better. I think next time i might add less root beer.

Great Recipe! It is so easy! Everyone in my family loved it, even my sister who often doesn't like BBQ sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!  Definitely a keeper!

This was the first time I ever made pulled pork and I thought it turned out very well.  I'm not sure that the Root Beer added anything to the recipe, but perhaps I did not taste it because I used very spicy BBQ sauce.  Thanks for sharing this...it's a keeper.

I made this for my kids school Tuesday night BINGO game. It was "BIG HIT" with both the BINGO players and the parents that worked at the BINGO.

I made this recently with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. It was great! Who knew root beer and pork would be so good!

This was my first time trying to make pulled pork & I absolutely LOVED it. My boyfriend is a huge pulled pork fan & said it was excellent. I cooked it for 8 hours because I was at work & it was perfect.

Soooo good!!  I'm originally from the South and am some what of a BBQ snob, but this is fantastic!  I would advise using Mug root beer - when I made it using this brand, the whole house smelled like cake while it was cooking (weird, but I guess it is all the sugar).  The next time I made it, I couldn't find Mug and used A&W brand, and it was still good but not quite as sweet.

This was good.  The root beer added a different flavor.  I used a boneless pinic roast.  It needed to cook a little longer.  Other than that it was very good.

It does not get any easier than this and very good.  I'm a big fan of Pork BBQ and it rates up there with the best.  Thanks!
