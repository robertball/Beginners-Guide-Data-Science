I am the one who submitted this recipe.  I'd like to point out that although the nutrition information makes it sound like this recipe is high in fat, most of the oil stays in the pan when you're done.  It's just there to make the seasonings adhere to the chickpeas, and to keep the chickpeas from sticking to the pan.  Probably some cooking spray would do the same trick if you're concerned.

Excellent!  A few tips: first.. the quality of your chickpeas will cause these to be mealy, or not. Field Day organics sells amazing chickpeas in a can, and they are creamy, not mealy, so they roast the best (make best hummus too). Next choice is Westfield organics. While I use Trader Joe's organic chickpeas in other recipes, this recipe will taste mealy if you use Joe's for this.

Next, the lemon.. if you use a meyer lemon for juice, its great. I also added zest from the meyer and that's even better, has a lemon flavor but not too tart.

As for the oven, if you make these in a conventional / older oven, they will likely not crisp well at 25-30 minutes if at all with more roasting. However, in a convection oven, the coating was perfectly adhered to all the chickpeas, the Fieldday and Westfield organic peas all came out non-mealy, and they crisped up in 25 minutes. 

Suggest making this in a good quality toaster oven with convection roasting if you can and otherwise have a regular oven. Saves energy too.

these were so so good.  I didn't even have any lemon juice or coriander and they were still so so good.  I think they needed a lot of extra time to get them crunchy, but crunchy they were!  be sure to leave them in long enough.  will make these again, the kids loved them!

This recipe turned out very interesting.  I really like it as a snack.  It reminds me of boiled peanuts that have been shelled and seasoned.  I just made a batch of them to see what I thought.  I think I might start taking this with me to school to snack on while I am in class.

The house smelled so good while these were in the oven. They are delicious. I will put the oven on convection next time so they will be good and crispy. Thanks for this recipe I will be making it often.

luved it! The key to getting them a little crunchy is to place them in a single layer when baking. And check up on them as they are in the oven- you may need to keep them longer! We finished them as soon as they were done! :D

These are yummy if you like the somewhat sweet, Indian flavor - which I DO!  However, describing the texture as "crispy" is a bit misleading.  They are a TAD crispy on the outside and normal bean texture on the inside.  Try 'em, you'll like 'em.

The spice flavor was very good, but I didn't like the texture.  They weren't like a crunchy snack . . more of just a dry mealy (?) kind of thing.  I ended up trying to pan fry them after the roasting to get more of a crispy/crunchy feel.  After frying I tossed them with more spice, brown sugar and salt to add back flavor.  It helped a bit and we still ate them, but I probably won't make it again.

I dry roasted the chickpeas at 300Â° for about 90 minutes on parchment paper. Stir every 15 minutes. Once they are crispy throughout,  add the oil, lemon and spices. Bake again for 15 minutes at 300 then turn up to 400 for about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Long process, but sooo worth it!

The seasonings also make a great rub for chicken.
Mix the dry ingredients  (I quadrupled the recipe and keep it in an hour tight jar).

The spices were bang-on perfect. I see why others suggest to dry roast first. So maybe a few technique changes, but otherwise this is delicious. I might use your spice blend on some other things! Yummy.

At first, I didn't like these, but the flavor grew on me.  By the time they were gone, I was practically licking the bag I kept them in to get all the last little spices out.  I followed the recipe exactly, and had to bake for almost double the amount of time...and I still wouldn't really call them crispy.  But they were definitely tasty, and a flavorful snack!

I love these! I didn't have any garam masala, so I substituted with hot Indian curry powder. I love spicy, so I added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I will definitely make this recipe again. :-)

So so good. Easy, and the whole house smells amazing as you bake the chickpeas.  Mine crisped up nicely, so I'm not sure why folks had difficulty with it.  Maybe a difference in the canned product?   These are fabulous snacks, and I make them every few weeks.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these never got crunchy for me. I purchased organic canned chickpeas (because someone mentioned needing to use high quality chickpeas), but they ended up very mealy. On a positive note, the flavor was good.

I loved the taste of these, however I did not enjoy them once they were roasted - they were dry and unpleasant to me - now I just mix up the sauce & refrigerate them - and toss them on salads

I made these because I had a ton of chickpeas to use up from the leftovers of the salad bar at work, and I was making an Indian-themed dinner anyway. They weren't bad; in fact they were quite good, and made a nice side to my Indian dinner, but they're not something I'd make again. I just wanted to do something with chickpeas other than hummus, cause I already know I like that. It was worth a shot, and I'll certainly polish off the leftovers with gusto, but I think I'll stick to hummus for my go-to on chickpea recipes. I suppose they weren't as crunchy as I'd have liked, and I baked them for quite some time too. Still, nice blend of herb flavors!

Since several other reviewers stated that these took longer than 30 minutes to crisp up, I was surprised when I checked them after 25 minutes and some of them had incinerated on my baking sheet. And I checked and I had roasted them at the correct temperature.  I removed the ones that were still edible, but I have to say the garam masala flavor was overwhelming.  DH ate one and said "They're all yours".  I ate a few, but no more.  They did smell good while cooking, but I don't think I'll make them again.  Sorry

First of all this didn't end up  being roasted properly second of all the flavoring was extremely bland even though it looks great on paper. I expected a lot more flavor considering I halved the amount of chickpeas I used. I was not impressed. Better off going to an authentic Indian cooking website.

T this is pretty tasty in a pungent, spicy, floral way.  I read what others said about not be partial to the lemon and having trouble with crisping the chickpeas.  So I dried my chickpeas on paper towels after I rinsed them for several hours.  I also preheated my cooking sheet in the oven before I put the mixture on the pan.  And, lastly, I used a lemon infused olive oil instead of lemon juice.  That's probably where the floral note is coming from.  Quite addictive!

Great recipe! I make a similar one, but I use premixed curry seasoning. It's easy, and I think the spices are more balanced that way as well. When making roasted chickpeas, I find the baking time varies with each batch, depending on the batch of chickpeas. Whenever you check on their progress, give the cooking sheet a shake, to ensure they're in a single layer and that they'll bake evenly and crisp well. I take them out when they're still barely easy to chew, and when they cool they get crunchy.  I usually boil mine from dried, and then make some roasted while I'm making hummus and other thing-try eating chickpeas warm  after just boiled with some sea salt, reminds me of boiled peanuts I get in the south. Try different flavors for roasted, even dessert ones, the possibilities are endless! I've even made cinnamon and sugar ones to give at the holidays, in the little treat gift baskets I make up. Even people who don't like "healthier" snacks love these!

Delicious! I didn't have coriander but otherwise made exactly as recipe says. Stirred at 15 min then at 30 min had just a couple over-done but almost perfect!  Would be awesome on salads too!

I make this all the time and love it! My kids and husband love it too. I double the recipe and we gobble the whole thing up in no time. It completely satisfies my cravings when I want something salty/spicy/crunchy to snack on and it makes me feel good knowing it's so much better for us all than grabbing a bag of chips! i go easy on the cayenne pepper since my kids are still little, but some day I want to try making it really spicy. Mmmmmm...

I made this with sprouted chickpeas instead of canned or cooked. The first batch(which I made with a few less chickpeas) came out scrumptious and with lots of flavor! While the second one the spices were a bit muted. Not sure why. Would make it again!

They were tasty, but not spectacular.  However, leftovers crisped up very nicely in the toaster oven.

I liked these chickpeas, but my boyfriend (who usually likes chickpeas) was not impressed. I recommend eating them right away, because the leftovers weren't nearly as tasty. I liked the spices in the recipe, but I don't think I would make them again.

They're ok.  I pre-roasted them for about 1/2 hour at 375 degrees.  They came out crunchy.  I then dipped them in lemon juice, coated with cooking spray, and then coated them with the spices.  This de-crunchified them.  I then cooked again for 25 minutes at 325.  They became too crunchy, losing the flavor.  Next time, I might omit the lemon juice and just use PAM and coat with spice.

I used two 15 oz. cans of Chickpeas rather than the two cups listed and adjusted the other ingredients.   Additionally, I took 1/4 cup of white sugar and sprinkled it on top of the chickpeas before baking.  Turning out fine after the adjustments.  Grease your baking sheet even if it is no-stick -- you will be glad you did.

Eating "by hand" is ok... but I discovered that mixing a handful with a serving of leftover tri-color quinoa and heating a bit (adding a bit of butter and coarse-ground salt) makes for a very yummy dish!

To reduce calories, I reduced the oil to 1 tbsp, left out the sugar, and dry roasted first for 25 minutes on parchment on the convection roast setting.

After dry roasting, I pulled the chickpeas out, and brushed on the spice/oil/lemon juice mixture with a silicone basting brush, and then stuck back in the oven for 5 minutes.

The spice mixture is great, and I amped it up a bit by dry roasting the whole cumin and coriander in a cast iron pan and then grinding it in a coffee grinder.

Used the spicy chickpeas in a salad and in couscous.

I have to be honest.....all I had was a can of chickpeas and some olive oil.  I did have HEB (a wonderful Texas grocery store chain) Texas Originals Steak Seasoning and I used that.  I found the recipe very helpful because I used the oven temperature, foil, and time on your recipe.

Easy and a good crunchy snack added to my trail mix. Used a pie tin which is about the right size for this small amount.

Liked the flavour, but not the texture.   Next time Iâll try using the same spices, but sautÃ©ing instead of roasting.

Everyone that tried them loved them including my 11 year old daughter.  A great way to get protein in those tweens!  I am making them again as soon as I get more chickpeas.
I made the spice mixture exactly as stated but I added two cans of drained chickpeas instead of two cups.  It was mild but flavorful.

The spices in this recipe are absolutely stunning.  The chickpeas started burning before they really got crispy on the inside, but that may have been because I use canned chickpeas from Goya.  Either way, I regularly make this to snack on during movie night.

these were sort of chewy/crispy - the reviews are right. they aren't going to be crunchy like chips. i thought they were phenomenal, but then, i'm mostly vegan. i did roast them twice as long as the recipe said - but i was using a toaster oven. i used maple sugar, not brown (we don't use sugar) and it was amazing. full of flavor but not spicy.

Deelish!!!  I love snacking on these healthy, flavorful beans!!  I think I overcooked them a bit; they weren't tasting dry and crispy so I kept putting them back in the oven.  Next time, I will follow the recipe's cooking time and see if they dry out a bit as they cool.   Super-tasty!  Thanks!!

I didn't use canned chick peas, but I soaked mine for over 24 hours before using.  They came out chewy instead of crunchy.  I will probably pan fry them next time (as I usually do to make my peas crunchy).  I also usually add curry power to mine.
