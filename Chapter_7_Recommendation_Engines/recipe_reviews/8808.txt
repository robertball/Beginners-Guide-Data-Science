I made this in a pinch, not having any creamed soup for the chicken pot pie I normally make.  This has replaced the old recipe I used.  It isn't as easy as the one with the cream of chicken soup but the flavor greatly surpasses the "easy" one.  (not that this is difficult at all, it just takes a few more minutes to prepare.)  Very tasty, VERY creamy!  My husband, who loves chicken pot pie said this was the best he had tasted.  I agree.  Thank you for your recipe.  NOTE:  I use two crusts: one on top, one on the bottom.  It does increase the fat and calories but the taste is worth the extra time on the treadmill!!!  You may have to add to the cooking time with two crusts.  I just judge by the appearance of the top and the bottom is always done.

10+++Stars.  Restaurant quality and better. First I baked two pie crusts(Pillsbury-ready crusts..much easier) in 9 inch pie plates. Then I made the filling.  I used 1 can chicken broth w/roasted veg flavoring to cook chicken.  I added more like 5 tbs of butter to cook the onion/celery-I used a heaping 1/3 cup flour and added the whole can of broth and like 3 cups of milk/heavy cream mixture.  I wanted alot of sauce to make sure it was plenty of liquid.  I used corn, peas, cooked cut up carrots and potatoes(microwave cooks potatoes in no time), and salt and pepper to taste.  I then poured my pot pie filling in the pie plates and topped with bisquick mixture(makes a great thick top crust-1 cup bisquick, 1/2 milk and 1 egg mix and pour on top)  then cooked for 30 minutes.  OH MY!!! DELICIOUS.  I think the flavored chicken broth added such wonderful flavors. I've found a keeper with this recipe!

This was one of the most delicious recipes for Chicken Pot Pie-worth the work.  I served this to my mother in law and husband and they both loved it. It takes a little bit extra work, but it's well worth it!

Excellent - one of the best around. Instead of milk - I used whipping cream (made it much richer tasting). Also - DON'T USE FROZEN VEGS - pick up red potatoes, fresh carrots, and fresh green beans - but blanch them (the potatoes a little longer). VERY VERY GOOD!

This is what a real pot pie should taste like. I subbed cut up rotisserie chicken, puff pastry for the crust, and added diced par-cooked potatoes. I would disagree with reviewers who subbed/added creamed canned soups to the sauce. The sauce is what makes this pot pie authentic. Absolutely the best comfort dish we've had all winter!

FAB-U-LOUS!!!!! Very tasty.  I followed some of the previous suggestions and used light cream instead of milk and added potatoes, salt & pepper.  I skipped the herbs because I didn't want them to over-power the dish.  I would not reccommend using any kind of canned soup as some reviewers suggested.  If you follow the instruction, this sauce tastes authentic, restaurant quality.  This recipe is a little bit of work to make during the week, so I prepared the filling the night before.  Added the crust the next night and cooked for 45 minutes.

Easy recipe, spouse loved it!  I actually made them in single souffle ramekins (put these on a baking sheet for overflow) so each of my guests had their own pot pie.

This was my first real attempt at cooking a meal for my parents and brother (my mom is a great cook, so I never really bothered trying).  I made a couple of changes (adding potatoes and carrots instead of frozen vegetables, adding a can of cream of chicken soup for extra chicken flavour and richness, and substituting some sage for some of the thyme).  This stew invoked a feeding frenzy!  It was so good that I am now responsible for making every Sunday dinner from now on!  Great recipe!

The pie turned out really well.  To avoid having the filling turn out watery (as I've read some people remark) I used one can chicken broth (instead of 1 cup) with one can of condensed cream of chicken (instead of milk) to make the broth mixture.  Add a splash of milk if the filling becomes too thick.

Tastes good but isn't the BEST I've had.  My daughters wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole.  (I think they're afraid of veggies!!)  But my son inhaled it!  LOL  Took 1 1/2 hours from start to finish.  Fine if you have the time but not fine if you come home late from work.

FANTASTIC!  I used left-over chicken and home-made chicken broth but I really feel the fresh parsley made this recipe extra special.  I tried keeping to the recipe, but also used a bottom crust as that's the way we like it.  This was "Oh so good!"  Thank you Corwynn Darkholme for sharing such a FANTASTIC recipe!

My husband and I LOVE this. I made minor tweaks - fresh veggies instead of frozen, and added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to the butter/flour/milk mixture. It was delicious!! Also, I doubled it and that much filling was enough to fill one large and two smaller pie crusts. We ate one that night and I froze the other two (unbaked). The two frozen ones cooked up really nicely, even going from pretty much frozen into the oven, just needed longer cooking time. GREAT for pulling out of the freezer on a snowy day!

I only give this three stars because it was so bland.  I really loved the texture and the ingredients, and I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  But after it came out of the oven, both my husband and I reached for the salt, just to give it some taste.  I'm not sure how to add more flavor to this, but I'd love to make this again!

This is delicious!  I made it exactly, but the one change I made that brought it to the next level, is adding about 2 TBSP of Dry Vermouth to the sauce when thickening.  It adds an amazing depth of flavor.  Highly recommended to add Vermouth or Sherry to the sauce.  Also, when eating it, I realized the filling needed a little salt.  I will add a teaspoon of kosher salt next time to the filling.

Absolutely delicious. I used Pillsbury pie crusts (the best!), only 1 cup frozen mixed vegies and 3/4 cup celery and added 1/3 cup chopped carrots. It turned out perfectly! It fit perfectly in the pie and looked terrific! My family and I loved it.

This is wonderful! Absolutely the best way to make chicken pot pie....from scratch.  I added mushrooms and had to sub 1/4 tsp dried+ 1/2 tbsp fresh parsley as I didn't have enough fresh.  This will be made again and again in my house. Thanks for sharing.

Terrible!  I used fresh cream, whole milk, lovely veggies and white meat chicken.  The only edible part of the pot pie was the store bought top crust.  How the rest could have turned out watery and dry at the same time is a mystery.  Bottom of the pie was watery, the meat/veg mix was dry and mealy.   What a dissapointment

This was fabulous.  I just made it tonight.  I used margarine and a non-dairy creamer in place of the milk, but it still turned out very tastey.  I used dry parsley because I didn't have any fresh.  That might have affected the flavor.  I used a pie dough that is also on this site, Pie Crust I, I think, or grandmother's pie crust maybe.  It turned out just right.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I loved this recipe, I only made two changes. I used two crusts instead of one because I'm one of those people that like a two crusted pot pies, and the second was I added a little bit of chicken boullion.  It was an amazing chicken pot pie that my whole famlily loved.  I would reccoment this recipe to anyone that wants to serve up a very tasty homemade comfort food supper!

Great recipe!  I only had a red onion and that definitely changed the flavor, but my kids still ate it.  In fairness, they did just pick the chicken and pie crust out and eat that, but they loved it.  I also had some light cream that I needed to use up, so I substituted that for the milk which made it even more delicious!

This is a yummy recipe.  I made it last night with the Oil Pie Crust recipe from this site.  I used my own homemade stock and it turned out great.  Delicious chicken stew!

I made for Mike and the kids tonite.  Everyone seemed to like.  Did it in 2 pie dishes with the top crust only.  May try to do a double crust next time.  Also, cooked just 1 potato in the broth before doing the butter and onion step.  was good I have to say.   December 8, 2010

Good flavor.  If you use fresh carrots and potato, make sure you pre-cook them or cut them really small.  I didn't and they were kind of still hard.

This was a wonderful recipe - thanks for sharing Corwynn! I made a couple changes based on what I had on hand and our diet needs: I substituted deboned left-over whole chicken, fat free half and half, gluten free flour, and the gluten free pie shell recipe from this site. Nom, nom as my son says!

Instead of pie crust I topped this recipe with Fluffy Biscuits by Nancy Horsburg from this site. It was incredible! It is my favorite chicken pot pie recipe. I even took it to my friend recuperating from surgery. I made everything as directed except the pie crust.

The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars is because I think it needs a little more spice. I add garlic salt or powder to give it more flavor. The veggies I use are carrots, potatoes, and peas along with the onion and celery.

Very yummy!!  I went with the reviewers recommendation and used 1/3 cup of flour, with chicken broth I used to boil chicken as well as 3cups of heavy whipping cream, then added fresh diced carrots, cooked 1 cup of frozen peas and corn then added to mixture and brought to boil. Then poured in pie shell and covered with bisquick mixture on top (1cup bisquick, 1/2 c milk and 1egg) was delish! Will definitely make again.

I had never made pot pie before seeing this recipe and now it's a huge hit in my house.  I'm not a fan of frozen mixed veggies, so instead, I dice one large baking potato and a few carrots and boil them in salted water until just tender and add that to the mixture with about a half cup of frozen peas. It always turns out great.  I have made this recipe with homemade pie pastry, but I've also used a Pilsbury prepared crust to save time. Corywynn, thanks for this great recipe!  It's easy and delicious!

Great!! I made this for another family and they called for the recipe that night!!  I made slight changes...I just boiled, cooled and diced chicken, used 1 can of broth and about 1.5cups of half and half...I dont really measure so they are estimates, i just made mine have plenty of the creamy good stuff!!  Also, I used 1 cup of Bisquick, 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg (mixed with a fork) and poured on top for the crust...bake at 400 for 30 mins...Perfect!!

I really loved this recipe!  It's so nice to have a recipe that does not call for a can of soup!    I did increase the sauce ingredients slightly to make more 'gravy', as we served this with mashed potatoes.   I used a 2 qt baking dish and used packaged pie crust for the top and bottom.  I used canned peas & carrots.   This recipe is a keeper, thank you!

This is a great Chicken Pot Pie.  It does take a little time to put it all together though, but worth the time when finished!  To save time I have used a rotisserie chicken instead.  My husband says it gives it a bit more flavor, I agree.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be making this one again and again!

Best pot pie ever!  My friend sent me this recipe and we are both hooked.  I like to use a turnip for a little extra spice with the starch, and add plenty of Italian Seasoning and cream with mine.  I also made it with the leftovers from a roasted chicken that I had cooked the night before and liked the addition of some dark meat.  I absolutely cannot wait to make this again!

I made this last night and it was a hit.
I parboiled 2 chopped carrots, 2 chopped celery stalks and 1/3 of a chopped onion then added them to the sauce.  I also added half a can of french green beans. I made my own crust from a pot pie recipe on this site.
Next time though I think I'll try to use more broth and less milk to give the sauce more of a chicken flavor.  Otherwise it was excellent.

This is the best chicken pot pie ever.  I made this with homemade pie crust and it was delicious.  I usually make this with cream of chicken or mushroom soup instead of chicken stock since I'm usually out of it and it turns out fine.  Add cubed potatoes, it's wonderful.  This is always requested by my mom, who doesn't really like to admit something tastes good that's made by someone else other than herself, so it says something when she requests this!

I used frozen peas and carrots mix, diced up a can of already cooked potatoes (they are already cooled and just the right firmness) along with some fresh mushrooms.  I found this to be simple and fast, and just the best flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

Fairly easy recipe. Some time savers are using frozen veggies and 1/2 can diced potatoes and leftover chicken or turkey. I don't use quite as much butter as what's called for. I prefer this recipe to the others that used canned soups. A+ in my book!  Definately in the winter rotation!

This our new favorite pot pie! I used a little more than 2 cups leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I used a bit more salt and pepper and a good splash of Red Hot. My stepson ate almost 1/2 the pie. I am hoping the last piece is still there at lunch time! :)

I made chicken soup earlier in the week and used the meat, broth and veggies from the soup (plus frozen veg).  Added garlic powder and oregano to the chicken broth mixture, as other reviews recommended.  Did everything else according to the recipe.  A perfect use of leftovers...  will definitely be making it again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I took it to a friend who had surgery. She ate one serving, her husband ate two servings and when I left he assured me, he put the leftovers in the refrigerator where she couldn't find them. The next day I understand there was 'great discussion' over who would get the last bite.

This is very good! I made it as stated and it was super yummy. Dont ruin it by using canned cream of (fill-in-the-blank) soup. It doesnt need it at all. My husband loved it. A keeper!

I used fresh chopped carrots and potatoes in place of the frozen veggies. Some frozen peas would be good too though. Then i used dried parsley because it's what I had on hand too.  More crust would be nice - so maybe using a bottom one too. I skipped the egg on top too.

I didn't have the thyme or parsley or the pastry. What I did have was puffed pastry.  It was delicious.  I also used veg-all.

We all loved this. I loved that it was all homemade and fresh ingredients. I made it stovetop only to serve in bread bowls. I took advice from others as well as adding a couple of items too.  I needed a 2nd cup of broth as a result. We used heavy cream instead of milk (only to use it up). I did use the onion & celery as written but instead of frozen veggies I used diced carrot, diced zucchini, chopped broccoli and a couple potatoes diced as suggested.  I followed the recipe otherwise and added celery seed and sage. Because it wasn't going in the oven I left it to simmer an addtional half hour. Everyone really loved this!!

This was the best pot pie i've ever made. i made some changes though. i added a chunk of onion, couple cloves of garlic and a fresh thyme sprig when cooking the chicken in the broth.then strained the broth. i didn't have any frozen mixed vegetables so just used about a cup and a half of chopped fresh carrots insteadand sauteed them with the onion and celery. I also added 2 tablespoons of fresh thyme instead of the dried. one more thing i did was saute some fresh chopped mushrooms in a seperate pan and added them in as well. it was very good!! thanks.

This was not bad. Made a few changes.  cooked cut up chicken in Olive Oil and then added 1 cup chicken broth to simmer.  Used one 10oz package of mixed frozen veggies. Also baked it in a pie shell. Put a Pillsbury Pie crust in a pie plate, pierced with fork a few times and baked at 350 for 7mins....then added all ingredients from recipe onto the baked crust and added another pie crust on top. Baked in oven for 30mins.  Will make again.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made from this website and probably the best chicken pot pie I have ever eaten in my life!  I liked the fact that it DIDN'T use Campbell's cream of chicken soup. The ease of preparation and the flavor of this pot pie was just so delicious.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe; I will be making it again this week!!

Delicious recipe. I had some boiled chicken breasts that I needed to use up and doubled the recipe. Put everything in big casserole dish with puff pastry on top; didn't brush with egg white. Added poultry seasoning, fresh garlic, heavy cream instead of milk and more butter. I used frozen onions, crinkle cut carrots and fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the frozen bag of veggies. Husband said this was better than anything frozen. And everyone ate this tonight including the kids! Corwynne's recipes are the best.

This was so good! I agree with the other users, next time I won't put as much seasonings because they were really overpowering.  I didn't want to use a pie crust b/c I don't like the way they reheat, so I covered the pot pie mix with vented foil (I was afraid that w/o the pie crust the pot pie would dry out) for the first 20 minutes, then I uncovered it during the last 10 minutes and added Pilsbury biscuits to the top.  Next time I'll cook the biscuits seperately though b/c they didn't cook on the bottom!!  I also defrosted the frozen vegetables in the microwave with a cup of chicken broth and some salt and pepper, and let them sit for a while to absorb the chicken broth flavor.

My husband loved this.  I thought it was good, also, but a little too much thyme for me.  I added a cooked, cubed potato to the vegetables.  I'll make it again for him, but use just a little bit less thyme.

My family LOVED this recipe. Instead of using frozen veggies I cut up baby carrots and potatoes. I boiled the cubed potatoes on the side and then mixed them in with the filling. If you do this just don't over boil them, you want them cooked yet still firm.

A delicious pot pie!  I had to add extra broth after I had cooked the chicken, as much had evaporated.  I would keep extra broth on hand.

So very yummy. Like others, I used half and half instead of milk, and fresh veggies on-hand (potatoes, carrots, broccoli) and frozen peas and frozen corn. Baked in oval casserole, used frozen pie crust for top. Did not add salt, but added Penzies chicken soup base to the liquid. OMG. Indescribably good.

I had leftover chicken meat so I used that instead of following the first step of boiling chicken. I followed the rest of the recipe. Excptions: I used 1/2 lb of chicken meat, increased the veggies by 1/2 cup, used fresh cauliflower and carrot instead of frozen, didn't have parsely so doubled the thyme and added salt and fresh ground pepper for more flavour.  I also used frozen pastry pie shells. The filling made two pies, using those shells, with top and bottom crust. I like having a bottom crust. This is a simple but time consuming recipe, and makes a nice dinner/lunch with a side of salad. I've made it more than once and will again.

The only thing I did differently was to kick up the pepper. I added freshly ground pepper -- however much I liked -- and it was wonderful. The sauce is not too thick or heavy. I did use 1% milk. I might bump up the thyme a bit next time. There were no left overs!

This was a tasty dinner!  I added 2 cups of chicken broth to avoid dryness and it was just right.  I would definitely make this again.  In fact, i had left over filling and was just wondering if i could freeze it as a complete pie for next time?

amazing pot pie, would gladly take the time to make it again.  The changes I made were simply out of necessity,  I don't have celery, thyme, or frozen vegetables, so I used fresh veggies, steaming them first.  I also used a double crust recipe, so I used both halves.

This was so yummy! I made it exactly as the recipe called for EXCEPT I made a double crust - instead of only having the crust on the top of the pie, I surrounded it with crust, top and bottom. So good! As for the portions, I agree that these were very BIG portions. But the pie is so delicious that you really want to eat the whole thing. Thank you for the recipe. Now I don't have to buy those overpriced, tasteless frozen pot pies.

I thought this recipe was great! I normally use cream of chicken & celery but didn't have any around and found this recipe.  I added some blanched mushrooms and cubed potatoes.  Topped it off with crushed ritz crackers.  Really tasted good and homemade!

This recipe was amazing. My boyfriend and even my 4 year old loved this pot pie. I used a little extra butter for the sauce and I added potatoes in with the celery and onion.

NOW THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! I did however add some roasted garlic, used two pie shells and potato but it was so awesome that my husband wanted to have the leftovers for lunch the next day.  And it was still delicous!!!  I put a pie shell on the bottom and one of the top to make it more like an actual pie. I will make this again and again!

My husband has been asking me to make a pot pie for some time now. I was relunctant to make one because I thought I would mess it up but I came across this recipe and it is definitely a keeper! After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to add potatoes to the filling. I was able to fill two deep dish pie crusts with this recipe. I couldn't have expected a better dish, especially with this being my first attempt ever at making a pot pie.

This actually did taste homemade & I was very pleased. My picky husband tried to eat the entire pan! I added some thinly cut carrots, 1 diced potato(zapped it for about 2 mins in the microwave to soften it),& a little bit of onion. I  added a bay leaf in the broth as the chicken was poaching & added poultry seasoning to the entire filling. I used 2 pie crusts, one for the bottom & one for the top. Oh I used a 9x13 pan. Next time will make individuals for different variations.

If you're looking for an all-American traditional chicken pot pie, this is the one.  It was very easy and tasty.  I would only recommend that a pan be placed underneath to catch drippings.  Perfect!

I have made this nearly a dozen times. Love it! I like to use fresh thyme and parsley.  I double the parsley. I have even added rosemary a few times. I use frozen peas and carrots, have also added mushrooms. I have made this with lowfat milk and with half and half. 
 I add a clove or two of garlic to the celery and onions, and deglaze the pan with around 1/4-1/2 cup of white wine to the veggies before adding the flour. WONDERFUL!

i am not a pot pie fan.  never had one i liked, never tried to make my own.  my bf's favorite food is pot pie.  so i thought ok, i'll give it another go.
replacing milk with half and half, adding 5 tbsp. of butter, and adding potatoes to the mix.  when it came out of the oven i also buttered the top and waited until it melted a little before serving.
the best and only real pot pie for me.  would eat again and again.  real hit with bf too!

My family loved this recipe. I used fat free evaporated milk instead of reg. milk and next time I will use 2/3 c flour because the sauce was a bit runny. I also made it with a bottom crust. This was soooooo good. Thanks!

Delicious with Rich, Flaky Pie Dough recipe by Pam Anderson.  Exquisite!!! Used poultry seasoning instead of thyme. It disapperared in my home in no time by one very hungry man, his teenage son, his wife, and my pugs dancing around hoping for a snack from the table.  it was that good!!

This is one of my "famous" recipes now.  I make it with these two simple changes:  1) Chop up the chicken before boiling - cuts the cooking time tremendously.   2) Whole wheat flour instead of white.  Delicious comfort food! (makes great left-overs too)

this is amazing! we made two, one using pilsbury pie crust ad the other is puff pastry. The puff pastry is amazing, and adds a country touch... the pie dough is good..nothing spectacular. Also, we used chopped carrots along with the celery...
we're saving the remaining filling (we doubled it) to go over biscuits on a rainy day. thank you for this excellent recipe!!!!

I don't often give 5 stars but this one was great! I used fresh veges cut up pretty small and used biscuits instead of a pastry crust (my preference). The only problem with the biscuits is they cook very quickly so I get them nice and dark brown then flip them over. Very yummy.

No kidding, this is the real deal, major comfort food!  My husband doesn't like pot pie, but ate 2 heapings of this.  I took the advice of many other reviews and changed just a few things.  Use 2 skinless chicken breasts, boiled and cubed; 8-10 small potatoes, cubed and nuked; 1 bag frozen mixture of carrots and peas fully defrosted; 2/3 cups flour instead of 1/3; Kroger brand refrigerated pie crust; cut the thyme and parsley (I didn't have any).  Mmmmmm- the best

Excellent recipe.  I, of course, didn't have the fozen veggies, so I nuked one potatoe, one carrot and a handful of green beans.  The sauce was excellent and you could add whatever veggies you want.  Great recipe.  Thanks Darkholme.

I did a bottom and top crust from the site(Best ever pie crust) and it was to die for. I only changed the veg's to our liking and I made more of the sauce as I had a very deep casserole dish.

My husband love this dish.  I added potatoes to mine and I didn't use the frozen veggies, I just chopped up fresh.  It takes a little longer but worth it(I hate frozen veggies).  I also use a top and bottom crust.  The ultimate comfort food.

It was really good. The pie tasted better the next day when the sauce could thicken up. After removal from the oven, the sauce is runny. The next day, however, it cut up like a pie and re-heated great.

Thank you Corwynn for this great recipe. Llke others, I have made a few minor adjustments, mostly cut back on the onion and thyme, but it was delicious. I did add more pepper and a touch of salt. Also, I had some leftover chicken breast that I used so that saved me some cooking time. Will definately make this recipe again.

Yummy, took some effort, but a healthier alternative to other pot pies (uses chix breast and only a little butter).  I didn't use as much onion as called for, though, and it turned out just right.  One whole onion would be quite strong, I believe.

have made this at least half a dozen times! I make it a "kosher" version - substitute non-dairy creamer & margarine for milk & butter (less cholesteral & can't taste the difference); also good with Bisquick biscuit mix on top !

I rarely leave any reviews (shame on me) despite using the site all of the time.  I had to comment on this though, as it is a really great adaptable recipe, even when not having the "exact" ingredients.  I ended up using mostly fresh vegetables and just a small bag of frozen peas.  But the thing I liked about this recipe the most was that the amounts of liquid to the measurements of veggies/chicken, etc is exactly right.  So no matter what you sub for the filling, it turns out pretty well.  Thank you for a great submission!

This was great and pretty fast because I used leftover rotisserie chicken. I just added my own chicken broth since I didn't cook any chicken. 
I added a bottom crust. It was a mistake. It wasn't soggy, but it wasn't crisp and flaky either. I made my own crust (it's easy!) and used whole wheat flour for half the white flour. It gave the crust substance and flavor. It was great for dinner, but I wouldn't do it in a dessert pie. 
Next time I make these, I'm going to make them in ramikins so it's easier to serve.
Overall, the flavor was great and I will make them again. This is healthier and more delicious than any frozen pie you can buy.

I make some changes personally. Extra veggies and i add oregano and thyme. Love it. It is a new standard! To save time, you can always boil chicken night before and then construct the night you want to eat it.

This is amazing!!  I did not have pie crust so we used Bisquick mix.  The flavors are wonderful!!  Completely different from the way I usually make Chicken Pot Pie!!!  It is time consuming but worth it.

For me Chicken Pot Pies scream out for green peas and potatoes, so I added them.  Also, I like a bottom layer of crust and added that as well.  I used part milk and part cream for the milk portion.  I think I used too much cream, as it turned out not runny at all, which means it will be dry when reheated, so it may have been more to my liking to use less cream or no cream at all.  My entire family loved it, even my picky 10 year old daughter.  That to me means 5 stars.  Saving this to my recipe book!

Delish!  I did add a diced up potato and left out the celery since I didn't have any on hand.  I also used pork in place of the chicken.  This will definitely be my go to when needing a pot pie

WOW that was frusterating, writing a whole novel and accidentally hitting backspace at the wrong time and I lost everything I wrote! 
ANYWAYYYY, I read many of the reviews, and I sort of decided after reading about 50, I'd give my question a shot. I'm making the pot pie in a pie dish, with a crust on top and bottom. But I'm wondering if anyone has tried preparing the pie and then freezing it? I am skeptical on doing this, worried if its going to produce too much condensation and turn out bad. So do I try baking it a little a head of time? I'm attempting today either way. So when I get my results I will update my review. 

My boyfriends a logger and is home randomly, machine breaks down or some dilemma. So when he is home I don't want to be rushed and in the kitchen. I wanna spend as much time with him, so I like to have meals ready for him. IF ANYONE HAS GOOD RECIPES THAT I CAN PREPARE A HEAD OF TIME LET ME KNOW ;)

Very delicious!  I didn't have just thyme, so I added some herbes de provence and that was equally good.  Will definitely be making this again!

We enjoyed this recipe. I used a rotisserie chicken for convenience and just shredded it and proceeded from there. Next time I would create a bottom crust and add some potatoes as well for heartiness. We'll definitely make this one again. My husband loved it.

Between evaporation and the crust soaking up the liquid...it's best when you double the gravy mixture.  I added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb to the gravy for more flavor.

This was so tasty! I didn't even have parsley and thyme, and it was fine without. Added 8 oz can peas and 8 oz can corn, and didn't have an onion. Made homemade pie crust and used it on bottom and top. Turned out perfectly! Will definitely make this again, whether there is a blizzard outside or not!

I will have to give this recipe 5 stars for taste!!! BUT only 1 star for accuracy for the serving size!! It says feeds 4 people...so I DOUBLED the recipe because we are a large family of 6.   So, this is what happened,  I ended up having to put it into 2 - two quart dishes instead of 2 1.5 quart dishes which isn't a problem at all. BUT after it was all said and done it made so much that we had plenty of food with just the first one! So, the whole second pie went right into the refrigerator for the next nights meal!   As far as taste goes it was WONDERFUL!!! It was time consuming but it IS well worth the wait!!! ALL my kids ate this and had  no complaints! We used whole milk for the recipe and it was  just fine! (We wanted to use cream like some suggested but we were out)   Thank you for a delicious meal AND ALL the leftovers :)

I really like it, but I will not be using the thyme next time, really strong, and I also used bouillon cubes & water instead of the chicken broth. Pretty good recipe though!

An incredible Chicken Pot Pie!  I followed the recipe exactly, and used my mom's recipe for crust which is incredibly easy. Put 2 2/3 c. flour and 1 1/2 t. salt in bowl.  Add 3/4 c. veg. or canola oil, mix with a fork.  Sprinkle with 4 T. ice cold water, 1 T. at a time until dough almost cleans side of the bowl.  If it is too dry, add 1-2 T. oil.  Do not add more water.  If it's too wet, add a tiny bit of flour.  That's it!  Just press firmly into a ball, then roll between two pieces of wax paper.  Do not handle it too much, or it will lose its flakiness.  It has always turned out great!  Thanks for a great chicken pot pie.

This was a good recipe! I cooked a whole chicken to make this. I added chicken bouillon cubes to the chicken broth, added some cooked potato chunks, added a little less vegetables and a little more broth, milk & seasoning. Since I only had 1% milk I added a little lowfat sourcream. Also used a bottom and top crust. I brushed the top crust with a little melted butter when done. It made 2 deep dish frozen pie shells. I bought refridgerated pie crust for the top. Everyone liked it! Thanks!

This was just OK. The sauce was tasty when I was making it. I added some extra black pepper and a bit more chicken flavored powder. But after cooking, the sauce was pretty bland. I'm guessing it just wasn't flavorful enough to stand up to all that chicken and vegetables soaking up the flavors. I did, however, very much like the idea of using the leftover water I cooked my chicken in + milk to make up my chicken broth for the sauce, and I thank you very much for that trick! I will probably go back to Chicken Pot Pie IX from this site next time. By the way, this feeds more than 4 people. It feeds probably closer to 6 people assuming a couple people gets seconds.

I have to agree with those who said this is restaurant quality.  My 9 year-old is very fussy, and when he took his first bite, his eyes closed in bliss.  By the time he was done (with a clean plate!), he declared, "Mom, you have GOT to make this again!"  My 14 year-old will eat nearly anything, but he was in complete agreement with his little brother.  "That was the best food I've eaten all week!" he told me, and he had just had a cake made by my friend, whose house is popular because her food is SO fabulous.  I might try adding the potato next time or making the crust from scratch (or Bisquick as another reviewer suggested), but even without changes, this was SPOT ON!

Really really nice, I also used Bisquick for the top and it was lovely. I made enough for 3 pot pies and popped 2 into the freezer for later. I added everything I could think of, did a quick saute of the onion, garlic and celery and them made the roux, not quite enough for us so next time I will make double. Even nicer that it didn't have soup in it and way way better than the store bought ones. Thank you Corwynn.

Absolutely delicious. I made a couple of small changes though. I added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to the onions, after putting the flour in, because they seemed dry. I also added more seasoning than specified, including sage and fresh oregano.

tasty and easy to prepare.  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe and a mix of leftover steamed fresh veggies instead of frozen, including some diced potatoes which help thicken the sauce.   And if I don't have time to prepare the whole shebang in one shot, I prepare the filling, pour it into the casserole dish, cover and refrigerate it until I'm ready to bake it.  Ditto for the pie crust.  Then I just need to roll out the crust, plop it on the filling, and bake.

I don't know how you give 4.5, but that's what I'd give this.  It's a wonderful "base" for what I ended up doing.  I added more of the herbs... and other things as well; like granulated garlic, sage, some of chicken broth powder (instead of salt)  I had frozen leftover turkey breast that was waiting for just the right recipe.  I added potatoes and green beans on top of what's called for.  I used someone's idea of Bisquick on top because it just made it so simple.  I put parsley in that.  Man, we both thought it was to die for.  Thank you so much for sharing!

this took alot of time but was worth it! i used fresh carrots and potatoes, and frozen corn. I also added a bit of rosemary and sage. My personal prefrence for crust was a pie shell on the bottom and phlio dough on top. very good

This was really good, but still did not have the tang I'm looking for. I will try this again using more chicken broth and some cream, or maybe even a little cream cheese.  I used two pie crusts (refrigerated) and everyone was glad I did.  I know it was good because there were no left overs!

Corwynn:  I am giving your recipe 5 stars!  I made it tonight and everyone loved it.  The only change I would make is to add a little less thyme.  My husband loves the flavor of thyme, yet said it was a little too thymey.  I agreed.  I also would like to try it with a bottom crust as well as a top.  I used left over roasted chicken, because I had it, and that's usually what I use to make my "old" chicken pot pie.    Also, just want to note for the record that I copied your little "heart" on top of the pie.  You need to make the heart a little bigger, because it shrinks .  Thank you for an awesome recipe, we loved it!  Jan

OMG this recipe ROCKS!!!! I run a daycare out of my home and we all could not get enough...me, a staff, a parent, and 7 kids!!!! We doubled the recipe and it fit nicely into a 9x13 pan. Also, we pinched and sealed a can and a half of cresent rolls for our crust since that was on hand. It was really good, but I would still like to try the pie crust.  We left out the thyme and parsely since we didn't have any, didn't seem to make a difference. Again, AWESOME, and we will definitely make again! Thanks!

definitely needs fresh carrots and potatoes.  I also threw in a can of creamed corn which added a nice sweet taste.  I didn't have a deep dish pie pan, so one recipe fills almost 2 regular pie pans!

DEE-LICIOUS! I cooked the carrots and peas in with the chicken. I also added thyme, rosemary and poultry seasoning to the cooking broth. I barely had a third cup broth left after cooking so I used a can of cream of chicken soup and about 1 3/4 c milk to make the "gravy".    Used french pastry pie crust minus 2 T sugar plus 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning...AWESOME DINNER! We all had seconds even though we were quite full from firsts, it was just that good no one could stop eating it!

Fantastic recipe--is very tasty!  I use thighs or legs or bone-in breasts & usually boil the chicken, then use the boil water as my broth (I prefer natural broth myself--tastes better, very little sodium).  I also omit the egg brushing on the crust--only because I'm frugal & don't care to throw out the egg when I would use so little.  Thanks for a great recipe!

really good - my husband loved it. i substituted 1/2 cup of condensed mild and 1 cup of milk with the broth - which made it creamy without being too rich. fresh tarragon would also be nice here - though i haven't tried it. great base recipe!

This is an awesome recipe! Like other posters, my variation is that I make it with a top and bottom crust and use pre-made crusts. I also add a bit more seasoning--thyme and pepper. This dish is the perfect comfort food!

Super Easy!! I made it alittle bit different due to that I didn't have everything in hand but mostly I follwed all the direction. I use chicken stock in a can. I fryed the onion only in butter, didn't have celery. I use a canned veg-all (about 3 cup). And finally, I didn't have time to go buy ready made crust or make one so, I use those ready to bake frozen buttermilk biscuit (storeband chaeper) which I had in hand and just bake for 15min. It cameout beautifully delicious!

Wonderful!  Was my first pot pie, and it was so easy!  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 1 1/2 lbs., and it was plenty!  I used fat-free milk and only 1 Tbl. of butter to reduce the fat.  I thought the thyme was a bit overpowering, so I will reduce to 1/4 tsp. next time.  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe on this site, and it was easy (made more than enough for a 1 1/2 qt. dish though).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Better than your Marie Calendars!
I did change a couple of things though. For instance, I used cornstarch to thicken the liquids, added cream of chicken soup, added brocoli with potatoes and carrots in conjunction with the frozen veggies. To add more zest to it I added cumin, black coarse pepper,sea salt, oregano.

Same as many reviewers here, I turned to this recipe because I really really felt like chicken pot pie but I did not have the condensed soup handy, but it turned out so much better! I stir-fried diced chicken until they're almost done, then added the chicken broth until the chicken was cook, then I added the broth to milk to make 2 cups. I used 1 chopped onion, 1 stock of celery diced, and 1 carrot diced, stir-fried them together until they were almost cooked then added flour and gradually added the milk, stirred and blended well and smooth before adding more milk to make sure the consistency, omitted the frozen veggies and added chopped parsley and chicken pieces at the very end after the heat has been turned off. I also omitted the thyme and made 4 single pot pies, the size of the ones they serve in restaurant. My brother later asked what ever happened to the leftover and was disappointed that there were none! Am making it again tomorrow! Great recipe! :)

Want to make this great recipe quicker?  I sauteed the cut-up raw chicken with the onion, celery, fresh parsley, & mushrooms – and added various seasonings and a teaspoon of Beau Monde seasoning (I left out the thyme!).  At the same time – I boiled the frozen veggies (I like to pre-cook mine) in the chicken broth with added garlic pepper – then when I drained them (reserving liquid, as recipe specifies) – I added one 4-oz drained jar of pimentos.  I proceeded with the rest of the recipe – but when the sautéing was done – I added the flour, then broth mixture and all the veggies at once to thicken.  The real timesaver -  instead of topping with pie crust – I topped with Stovetop stuffing mix (chicken flavor) and generously drizzled unsalted butter on top. Makes a great crunchy topping!! Great recipe – I just needed to reorganize to fit my time constraints.  Thanks a bunch!!!

Delicious home-style recipe! Loved not using canned cream soup for base. Made from leftover chicken; so I skipped that part and just used the the amounts of milk (used 1% lowfat) and broth as stated in ingredients of the recipe. Thank you reviewers for the ideas! Due to that, I halved the chopped onion, halved the thyme, added 1 tsp. chicken boullion granules, dash of ground cayenne,1/4 tsp onion POWDER and lots of fresh cracked black pepper. I also thought a whole cup of celery was too much, so I halved that too.Came out better than any chicken pot pie I ever had before and is 5 star in the comfort-food department; because it made the house smell wonderful while cooking. Was done perfectly in time that recipe stated. THANK YOU  for sharing this one!

Very good! A bit time consuming, but my 18-month old gobbled it up, so I'll definitely be making it again! My only recommendation: unless you REALLY like thyme, I would use just a pinch or leave it out altogether. It overwhelms the flavor of the gravy.

WOW!  This was the best chicken pot pie I have ever had!  I didn't have frozen vegetables so I used 1 1/2 cans of peas and a cup of fresh chopped carrots cooked in the microwave.  Very simple and very good!  I will make this recipe for years to come!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!   it is so delicious and has been a hit for whoever i have made it for.  i also have tried a vegetarian version using vegetable broth and 2 cans of black beans instead of chicken broth and the chicken....this is delicious as well.  I call it bean pot pie! 
this is the best chicken pot pie i have ever tasted.

Added parboiled potatoes and a bottom crust. The egg wash on the top crust is an amazing finish!  Great , hearty dish.

Have made this a couple of times now.  Very creamy and rich tasting, easily besting my "easy" pot pie.  One of the few things my picky 5-year-old will eat thats not mac n' cheese or chicken nuggets.

Great recipe! I used 2 frozen pie shells (as suggested by someone else) - cooked the bottom one in oven as it preheated to 400 for ~ 8 mins (so it looked almost cooked).  I added fresh broc to the onion/celery mix and used half+half and 1% milk to make up the rest of the 2.5 cups.  It was a fairly think mix, which for us was perfect.  Not runny at all.  I also did a crisscross pattern on the top using the other thawing frozen pie shell (didn't use egg to wash the top). I followed the spices as suggested and just added a bit of salt to my own serving.  Served with a green salad.  I will make this again, for sure!

Very good! I used leftover turkey instead of chicken and  I left out the thyme.  I also used 3/4 C 1% milk and 3/4 C half and half .  I cut the pie crust into strips and criss crossed it on top.  All of my kids and husband loved this. This is my new favorite pot pie recipe.

Perfect flavor. I like to pour it into a deep dish pie crust, top with another deep dish pie crust, seal edges, and brush egg on top. Great comfort food.

I use all fresh vegetables instead of frozen takes quite a bit more time but we'll worth it.I use personal size pie pans instead of one big one..the left overs I freeze so next time it's a snap to make..or just add a little more broth and milk and make a soup. This recipe is very tasty and simple thanks for sharing your recipe

My family and I love this pot pie recipe.  It's a great way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken, and we have most of the ingredients on hand in the freezer.  Sometimes we make individual pies in medium ramekins and other times we make a large one for the whole family.  Either way it turns out very well.  Nice recipe!

The other reviews were right -this recipe is time consuming, but totally worth it if you have the time and energy.  I don't think frozen veggies would ruin it, but I wouldn't leave out the potato.
I used salted water with smashed garlic cloves instead of broth, and for veggies used 1/2 a russet potato, 1/2 cup chopped carrots, 1/2 cup diced bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped green beans (all blanched) then stirred in almost a cup of chopped mushrooms with the celery and onion.   
I even made the filling ahead of time and kept it in the fridge for a few hours until we were ready for a meal.
Also used a premade double crust in a 10" pan, no problem fitting it all in there.  The sauce was creamy, the pie was moist, and I was really happy with the result.  Lots of fresh veggies kept it much lighter than store-bought pies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first time I've ever made a pot pie, and it was really easy.  To me, a pot pie needs to have crust on the top and bottom and potatoes, so I added those in.  I cooked the bottom crust first a little before I added everything in.  I tweaked a couple other things for taste and time, like no onion for me, used more pepper, rotisserie chicken, store bought crust, but essentially kept it as is.  Next time, I will make the time to use my own crust instead.  I am eating it now, and I'm happy.  I'll use this again.  I'm going to play with this one to see what else I can do with it - other spices/herbs, making a veggie pie, maybe a broccoli cheese pie.  Glad I chose this one.

WOW! I used the procedure and basic ingredients in this recipe but adapted it a bit using more fresh vegetables instead of the frozen ones, added diced parboiled potatoes and omitted the thyme. In our family of five it earned ten thumbs up and requests for me to PLEASE MAKE IT AGAIN SOON! The kids are begging for leftovers! I doubled the recipe and it made two 8x8 glass baking dishes and a rectangular glass dish that is smaller and not as deep as a traditional 9x13 pan. We have enough for a full dinner for my family and a separate 8x8 pan to give to my parents for their dinner. Sure to be a regular in our house.

This is an awesome chicken pot pie recipe, and I've tried A LOT!  I didn't have any celery or mixed veggies, but it still turned out DELISH!  I used a crust for the top and bottom. . . I used a basic pie crust recipe, added a little more butter/shortening so it would knead thin, added dried parsley and onion powder to the crust mix.  I used some left over baked chicken I had from the night before, therefore I omitted the salt and pepper since the chicken was already seasoned.  I used frozen corn, canned green beans and added mushrooms.  I used 2% milk, and added sage and rosemary along with the thyme.  For those of you who are getting a "watery" filling. . . make certain you are cooking the filling long enough for it to thicken. . . my filling came out superb using a lower fat milk  (who needs the extra calories? lol)  I will definately be making this again with fresh vegetables and celery!!!

Excellent recipe, I've only made chicken pot pie once before, 8 years ago.  That recipe had called for tarragon and I loved it so I also added 1tsp tarragon here for a gourmet tasty chicken pie filling!  Used a cup of whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk instead and didn't use any frozen vegetables just fresh and chopped. Very Tasty! I also did not use this with a pie crust but made the "Touch of Honey Biscuits" to dip in it instead.  So could use this for pie filling or as a chunky thick creamy chicken stew...

Delicious! We both loved it...I made it in pie shells instead of a casserole dish, and had to make 2 pies with this recipe! So that's 4 pie shells, 2 bottoms and 2 tops. Instead of 2 cups of frozen vegetables I boiled a sliced carrot and a sliced potato for a few minutes, then added frozen peas and frozen corn to make up just over 2 cups. And we didn't have enough leftover chicken to make a pound and a half, but I had about 2 cups of cooked chicken, and that was enough. Very good flavor, go easy on the thyme, though. And of course, my man eats it with ketchup, cuz it tastes better that way! Thanks for the great recipe!

I can't believe I haven't been back to review this recipe! It is absolutely the best pot pie I have ever tasted, hands down. I follow the recipe exactly, except at the very end I cook it in a double crust and don't bother brushing it with the beaten egg. Other reviews will agree that this pie takes a lot of time to make, but it is so worth the time. I make two and freeze one for later, then bake it for about an hour the day we want to eat it. Everyone I've made this for goes back for seconds and wants the recipe. Try it - you'll love it!

Takes a long time to make, but it is really good. If you want a quicker version, try the chicken pot pie recipe that usually comes on a box of Bisquick.

I have been wanting to make a pie like this for a long time. This is a good recipe especially if you can manage a homemade pastry crust. Finally I am able to produce one without a major tantrum. I did add some potatoes and carrots which I cooked about 10 min. Other than this addition I stayed true to the recipe.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal tonight. Which means that I will make this again. The celery was still a tad crunchy so I will sautee longer next time. I would have liked it to have more flavour so I will tinker around to try to improve it in that way. This was quite easy to make and with the pastry topping, looked great. All in all - A success.

EASY! I decided to make it on a whim and was surprised at the simplicity. I modified the recipe slightly, by separately boiling chicken, and I used fresh veggies from the farm: eggplant, squash and carrots. It was phenomenal and finished within 2 days.  Hubby said was the best he ever tasted!

What a great recipe!!! I doubled the recipe and made it  for my PO-KE-No group. I knew it was a hit when most went back for seconds.  I made it a second time because my family was disappointed there wasn't enough left over for them. They flipped! The only change I made was using seasonings we are accustomed to in South Louisiana and chicken breast tenders. My husband announced this is his new favorite dish. Now if I could just get him to clean up the kitchen.. ;-)  It is definitely worth the work. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is a fabulous recipe. Very flavorful. The only modification that I made was I used a bottom crust as well. It came out perfect. We will definately make this recipe again.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did substitute Cavender's Greek seasoning in place of the salt, think I will increase the Cavender's to 1/2 heaping teaspoon next time.  Used puff pastry, cut in strips then made into a lattice.

Yummy. I used the "Buttery Flakey pie crust" from this site and used a deep dish pie plate. Used heavy cream instead of the milk and changed nothing else. Very yummy.

I LOVED this pot pie b/c it does not use condensed canned soup...the flavor was wonderful!  I used a whole organic chicken that I boiled off earlier in the week.  I also used the chicken broth from that.  I think that made the flavor so much better!  I also used a crust recipe I got from Cindy Crawford when she was on Oprah several months ago...it's a super thick crust and it was so good!

This is a great basic recipe.  I had to modify it somewhat because my son cannot have milk, eggs or butter.  That said, I cooked a whole chicken and used just the dark meat, cut up, saving the white meat for a chicken salad. I used 3 cups of the chicken broth in place of milk.  I cooked the onion and celery in Smart Balance Lite butter substitue. I added poultry seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper to taste. I cooked and cubed 2 cups of potatoes and added that to the mixed vegetables.   I pre-cooked a bottom crust at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.  Then added the filling and top crust.  I'm sure the egg brushed over the top would have made a prettier crust but it wasn't necessary for flavor.  My husband and son never missed the dairy products.  It really was a very flavorful pie even with the modifications.  This made two 9" pies at just a fraction of the cost of a pot pie that our local grocery deli sells.  This recipe is a keeper.

My man asked if I could make Chicken Pot Pie and I said, yes. So I ran screaming to the computer and this recipe saved the day. One bite and my man closed his eyes and said, "Superb!" He has never rated any meal that high! Every other bite he said, "Delicious" The recipe makes enough for two double crust pies and we ate almost the entire two pies for dinner! Poultry seasoning is an excellent tip from other reviews.  I cook the chicken with celery leaves, 2 slices of onion, bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, basil and marjoram in 2 cups of water. It creates a very savory chicken broth. I cook a cup of chopped potatoes with the chicken and the herbs season the potato well also. Discard the onion, bay leaf and celery leaves when the chicken and potatoes are done. I have now made this with the cream of chicken soup and w/out, my family likes it best with the soup. Incredible recipe, many thanks!

This was great. I did it a little different though by adding cream of potato soup to the broth in the measuring cup then topping it off with the milk.

Pretty good.  I didn't do all that fancy stuff with the pastry though.  I used store bought premade pie crusts and I used 2 of them cause I like a crust on the bottom as well as the top.  Yummy.

I am trying to improve my reputation as a cook. I would rather be outside building a tree fort or something SO if something is not burnt my kids are all shocked and my husband gives my an encouraging grin. Well, I had one of my first feelings of beaming at my family while they raved over my cooking. It was cold and icy outside and we were cozily sitting around the table with our wonderful chicken pot pie. (I did add lots of frozen peas and fresh mushrooms and didn't ruin it) THANK YOU SO MUCH. I really appreciate this site.

Hey everybody! Omg this dish is to die for. Literally its the best i've ever made. There was little error though when I changed the serving amount measurements, it didn't change them in the directions so you might want to double check. Also if you dont like celery try replacing them with potates...it tastes great!

This was very good. I followed the recipe plus added extra salt and pepper, a little poultry seasoning, and used light cream instead of milk as suggested. The only thing I did wrong was to place the pie crust directly on top of the filling, instead of above it. The crust got soggy and didn't brown nicely when the filling bubbled up.  However, the taste was great and the family enjoyed it.

This is a superb recipe. My first time making a potpie and my son loved it. I will definitely make this again. I used light cream in stead of milk which made the sauce very thick and creamy. I also used a can of diced potatoes, 4oz can of mushrooms, corn, and carrots instead of the frozen vegetables. I added some of the mushroom juice to the chicken broth and the carrots(I wanted them soft)I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms together but used about 5 tbsp butter instead of three.

Wonderful! Comfort food at its' best..without all of the sodium of frozen brands! I used a double crust, and thought the thyme was a super addition...Will use this as my staple pot pie recipe for left over chicken and turkey too. A+

Actually, more like 4 1/2 stars...it does take some time to prepare.  I didn't have a problem with the sauce being runny or watery, mine was quite thick and I even pureed it in the blender for a bit to thin it out.  Next time I will try cooking the mixed vegetables thoroughly instead of simply thawing them (I like my pot pie veggies mushy).  I also used a double crust and it turned out beautifully.  Overall an excellent recipe!

my first time making chicken pot pie, and i'm more than happy with the result!  was quite soupy, but  after reading other reviews, i wasn't surprised - may use a little less milk next time.  flavour was delicious! definitely will be making this on a regular basis.  didn't use frozen veggies (freezing vegetables removes a lot of vitamins), so my 2 cups of veggies consisted of half a green and half a red pepper, plus parboiled diced carrots.  orgasmically good! =o)

This was great!! I used 2 cups cut up cooked chicken and basically started with step 3. I also just threw in the whole 16 oz. bag of thawed mixed veggies. The rest I left as is and yum!! My husband missed the potatoes, so I'll add some next time for him, but this is definitely a keeper, thanks!

This chicken pot pie rocks!  I followed the recommendation of previous reviewers and used a pastry puff for the top crust.  This worked nicely; however, next time I will also use a crust for the bottom of the pie.

I layered the top with phyllo dough as suggested by others. Turned out beautiful! But the filling DOES make a A LOT of pot pie. I would recommend making two pies and freezing one.

Great recipe and I found it easy! I used a store bought pie crust and think it made it too sweet. I will try the puff pastry or homeade crust next time.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was a great hit.  I altered it to make mini pot pies and left out the unwanted veggies and it was just great.

I scaled down the recipe to 2 servings and made 8 individual pies instead of a pot pie. I used frozen puff pastry too. I made 4 on the first day and kept remaining filling in the fridge. I made another 4 pies 2 days later for lunch, surprisingly they taste better!

Delicious Corwynn! I made this recipe in individual crocks and used bisquick to make a top crust only. Very hearty and comforting and especially appreciated during our very chilly N.J. spring. Thanks so much!

This is an excellent recipe.  Chicken pot pie is one of my favoriate things in the whole world & I am so glad to have a recipe that doesn't call for a can of condensed soup & canned veggies.  I always need more liquid to cook my chicken, but all I do is reduce it way down while I'm preparing the remainder of the recipe.  It took a little longer to prepare than I thought, but that may be because I make my pie crusts (I DO A TOP & BOTTOM CRUST).  My husband who only eats chicken pot pie to appease me, LOVES this recipe and asks me to make it.  My pastor, who is a good ol' country boy, said it's the best he's ever eaten. WELL WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT.

this is a wonderful recipe! my boyfriend made yummy sounds all through dinner & mentioned 3 times how "tasty" this pot pie is! the only changes i made were to use dried parsley flakes & to make the filling a day ahead so the flavors would bloom. thank you corwynn, i enjoy making your savory recipes!

This gets 5 stars because of the easy prep when premade piecrusts are used!  I've never been good at homemade crust, so Pillsubry was my best friend tonight!  I cut up the chicken before cooking, and added poultry seasoning to the broth.  I added a bunch of fresh ground salt and pepper to the milk/broth mixture, too, so it had more flavor (might add more poultry seasoning or fresh herbs neext time).  I didn't have mixed frozen veggies on hand, so I diced some carrots and threw them in.  It is much quicker than Betty Crocker's recipe, so I will use it the next time I'm in the mood for pot pie but don't have much time!

I usually never rate a recipe that I've changed but I'm going to rate this one because it's a great recipe.  The changes that I made: I added a bottom crust.  I baked that bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup instead of milk.  Those changed made for great flavor.  It was nice and thick and very, very flavorful.

This recipe was almost identical to the one I usually use, I chose to use it, because of the scaling conversions and shopping list available on this site. I'll use it again!! I made five 9x13 pans with double crust, cooked one for dinner and froze the rest, easy dinner in a rush, MY FAMILY LOVES THIS ONE!!!

This is my new go to recipe for chicken pot pie. It was quick, easy and delicious.  The only change I made,(or added) was a partial bottom crust. I needed to use ready made refrigerated crusts that were close to expiring. I cut the edges off one crust, placed in bottom of 13x9 pan and baked for about 10 minutes or so and then followed the recipe according to the directions.   I cook for a group of 8 men each day and they loved it. Thanks for sharing

It would have been just fine without the thyme. It ruined the dish and I had to throw it out. Otherwise, it was good. Too soupy. I had to strain out a lot of the sauce, but I like the idea of a scratch pie vs. cream of chicken soup. I’ll try it again with a bunch of changes.

We LOVED this!  You definitely need to add some extra salt to the sauce or a bouillon cube or 2.  Mine thickened up nicely and the sauce was not thin at all in the pie, it was perfect :)  Added some potatoes.  Green beans would be great too!  Going to be my go to pot pie now :) :)

This was fantastic!  My first time making a chicken pot pie! One change was that I used fresh veggies instead of frozen (1C each:  Diced potato, celery, carrot, onion and peas).  I boiled the potatoes and carrots with the chicken breasts so I needed an extra cup of broth.  But still added enough milk to make 2 1/2 Cups of sauce per the instructions.  Other than that, made exactly as written, absolutely delicious!  Perfect for a rainy football day! Thank you so much! :o)

You won't regret trying this! It just feels like home! I made this on a chilly spring night for my mom and fiance and it was great! I pair it with Pillsbury biscuits and mashed potatoes. I made the mistake of using a condensed cream soup recipe last time and I will NEVER do that again! We threw most of it away along with that recipe. This will be the only chicken pot pie I'll be making from now on!

Followed everything to the letter. But used pillsbury grands for the crust, and made it in a square casserole dish.  Cooked 375 for 20 minutes. It was great!

This was very, very good!  I used refrigerated pie crust (which comes in a 2 pack) and so pre-baked one in the bottom of the dish for ten minutes.  I used frozen peas and carrots and par-cooked  half a pound of new potatoes, that I then diced up.  Next time I’ll up the salt and pepper, cut down on the flour by a tablespoon and add some sherry as someone else suggested.  Definitely will make again, my husband loved it!

This is one of my favorite recipes. We make this all the time, with very little changes. The biggest change is that I use a rotisserie chicken instead of poaching the chicken breast. Just makes it easier for a weeknight meal. Kids ask for this all the time!

My 9 and 11 year old daughters and I made this per the recipe. It’s easy and delicious. We’re a family of six, so we made serving of 12, which filled up two 9” pie crust tins and we ate both pans at dinner. My boys loved the filling the most. Definitely recommend and be creative with crust. It’s fun and tasty.

Great pot pie - and I like the fact that it doesn't use canned soup as an ingredient.  Made the way it was written, except I added some leftover roasted potatoes from last night's meal. Next time I would add a bit of salt and pepper.  I try to go without salt when necessary but I am thinking that was what was lacking here.

My family loved this pot pie!  It was well worth the extra time and effort to make this from scratch. I used Pillsbury pie crust and made with crust on the top and bottom. I also chose to parboil fresh cubed potatoes and carrots with some frozen peas. I also decided to take other people's recommendations and use cream with the chicken broth and Rotisserie chicken. Taste your sauce and season as you like - I added extra salt and pepper and a dash of poultry seasoning. My husband said it was restaurant quality!  Thanks for this basic recipe.

I made this for my dad, a man picky about his pot pies, and he loved it. I tried to follow the recipe to the letter.  The changes I made were due to the ingredients I had available.  I used a large can of Vegall instead of frozen veggies, making sure to rinse the contents to eliminate any metal taste that might have lingered.  I used dried parsley and thyme.  I added thyme, salt and pepper to taste.  Because I like a juicier filling, I doubled the chicken broth and then added evaporated milk to bring the total liquid to 3 1/2 cups.  I also increased the flour in the filling from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup.  I didn't have any celery, so I omitted that  ingredient.  Next time, I'll make sure I have some celery because I think it will make a wonderful dish even better.  Finally,  I used Chef John's butter pie dough recipe, which I found on this site, for the crust.  It yielded a wonderful, flaky top and bottom crust that was very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!

I par-baked a bottom crust & accidentally doubled the pepper.  Putting it all together felt a little more time consuming than I wanted it to be but it was well worth it.  It was fantastic comfort food!

The taste was very good, but next time I will add more chicken flavoring as the broth did not add enough chicken flavor.  I think the next time I would partially cook the potatoes  or cut them into tiny  pieces.  My husband and I look forward to having it again.  This recipe is a keeper!

I just follow the recipe and season to taste.  I never seem to have fresh parsley on hand so I don't use it.  I've made it in a casserole with a single crust on top,  in individual pots with their own crusts.  I've topped it with canned biscuits torn up if I'm feeling extra lazy and don't want to make crust..... It's in the regular rotation around here. THANK YOU for a wonderful recipe.   Tonight the leftover Costco Chicken is finding a new home..... in the pot pie

I have never made chicken pot pie before and was a little nervous because it seems like it would be so difficult - WRONG - this recipe made it so easy! I followed the recipe exactly except for the thyme (didn't have any). It was a huge hit and I will definitely be making it again! *Note: I only cooked in the oven for 25 minutes and the pastry topping was crunchy on top but still a little soft/gooey on the inner surface which was AMAZING

Loved this recipe.  Made substitutions since I didn't have a couple ingredients.  Added can of diced potatoes and onion powder. 

Kids love it also minus the vegetables ??  

I don't love it the next day though but thankfully my husband does.

Pretty good. I thought just thawing the veggies made them a bit crunchy in the dish. Also, I a bottom crust, but it didn't cook as well as top and next time I would bake it a bit first or omit it as the top layer is enough dough.  I added garlic powder and par cooked potatoes which added to it a bit. A nice comfort food dish.

Have made this so many times, I’ve lost count, and am well overdue for a review. This is the only way to make pot pie - you can use leftover chicken or turkey, or just pluck one from the rotisserie at the grocery store; use pre-made broth or make your own per the recipe; fresh herbs vs. dried, no matter - you cannot go wrong. Five stars all day long!

It was easy and straight forward to make which I really liked! But to be honest it didn't have much flavor. It was just a lot of chicken in a bland sauce. Maybe I had too much chicken or no enough sauce. But I would recommend making more sauce and adding some spices to taste

Love this dish. I like to use chicken thighs since I prefer dark meat. I I 1st cook them in a frying pan with the skin on facing down on low and turn them . I cool them down ,then take all the fat ,bones and skin off. Instead of frozen vegetables , I use fresh carrots and celery and steam them. Peas I use  frozen. I know its more work my way , but I love it & its very flavorful. 5 stars in my book .

This was awesome! The only difference I made were: 1. I cut out most of the seasoning as I don't really care to stock those on the regular. 2. I used mixed veggies: squash, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots. 3. I just used a standard 9 inch cake pan and placed the pie crust around that. It was delicious, super easy, & amazing! I'll definitely buy a bigger pan for the next time I back it but I'll be bringing it to a pot luck!

Just made this tonight and it turned out fairly well. I added carrots to the onion and celery and used frozen peas. I made buttermilk drop biscuits (only 3 ingredients!) instead of using store bought crust because it was easier than making yet another trip to the store. The texture was good but I would've liked a bit more sauce and it also needed a bit more salt. I think it's dependent on the sodium content of the broth. Quite a yummy meal for a chilly night.

This was an easy to follow recipe which turned out very nicely.  The chicken was tender and moist as I simmered it in the broth until almost the broth had been absorbed.  I also pre-cut my chicken before cooking it rather than after.  I then used 1 1/4 cup broth and 1 1/4 cup milk for the gravy.  I also sautéed all of my vegetables together after the garlic and onion were translucent as I used all fresh veggies. I found the spices too weak so I added additional thyme, garlic, and more salt and pepper.  But there was something missing in the spice... I have to figure it out!  I also substituted soy milk for cow's milk due to an allergy.  As there is only 2 of us, I split the recipe and froze one pie to bake at a later date.

I am impressed! My husband and I didn't really care for chicken pot pie...until this recipe. We both loved it!  It could use a tad bit more pepper but it was very tasty!

Followed the recipe, minus celery and it was a family-wide hit!  We are a family of 7 and everyone loved it.  I loved not having to used creamed soup but having an easy, from-scratch recipe.

This was very tasty! I had half of a roasted chicken leftover from dinner last night and I wanted to use it up. Since my chicken was already cooked, I just chopped it into small pieces and simmered it in the broth with the veggies to make it taste fresh again. Then followed the directions of the recipe, except I swapped corn starch for the flour, as I prefer a thicker sauce. I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe (from this site) and it all turned out superbly. I don't make pot pies often, but this will be my go-to recipe for the future.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I used store bought crust (I have not mastered pie crust making skills.) I also added a small parboiled peeled and cubed potato and an extra cup of broth because it looked a little too thick with the addition of the potato. One of the reviewers said that it was too bland, but you can always add salt and pepper to taste, I did and it was delicious!!! I will definitely be making this again. This is comfort food at its finest!! :-)

Very good! Kids loved it (esp with the Halloween cutouts I used) and it was pretty simple to make.  I did use a little extra salt and herbs to taste, but other than that I prepared true to recipe.

Great Recipe!  Made my own pie crust, because I had the time, and added unfrozen vegetables.  The kicker part to this recipe is exchanging the bland, canned broth with homemade dark chicken stock.  The flavor will be light-years ahead of any recipe that uses canned creamed soups, broths, or bouillon cubes.

I had no milk, so I used chicken broth for the total amount of liquid. The pie turned out perfectly.  It is the best chicken pot pie I ever had. Homemade lard crust. A very simple and fun project.

This recipe was AMAZING! I followed the recipe but just added potatoes, fresh carrots, used half and half instead of milk, added more pepper (1/2 tsp total), and made it with a top and bottom crust. Everything turned out perfectly! The taste was exquisite!  I can't wait to make it again! Thank you!

I had to add salt and chicken base.  It really lacked flavor. I think if you season the chicken well it would help a lot.

This was my first chicken pot pie to make and it turned out great. I never like to use cream of chicken/mushroom because of all the un-pronounceable ingredients so I appreciate the sauce in this recipe. My sauce thickened up perfectly. I added a cut up baked potato and added some celery seed for more flavor. I did have to add some salt to it when I was eating...so that's why I give it four stars instead of five.

I used a little less flour to make it juicer. Otherwise, this was the most flavorful chicken pot pie I've ever tried. I used light cream instead of milk and fresh vegetables. Excellent!

Just made this and it was delicious. I added a partially cooked potato, used leftover cooked turkey, and put a crust on the bottom because we like crust. Will definitely make it again!!

OH. MY. GOD!
Chicken pot pie is one of my favorite foods but I've never tried to make one from scratch. (I wasn't even aware I could cook chicken by boiling in liquid!) but I followed this recipe-the only change I made was fresh mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, frozen peas, and canned corn-and it is SOOOOO AMAZING.
BIG though... I couldn't believe there were leftovers and I could hardly get it in the casserole dish!
I wasn't aware I could cook like this! WOW!! MMMMM

I love this recipe because you can make it as complicated or as simple as you want to.  On nights where I am in a rush, I use frozen veggies and pick up an alreaady roasted chicken from the deli department at my grocery store.  Otherwise, I use fresh veggies and blanch them, then bake my own chicken.  I love to make individual portions of these and top it with a flaky crust.

This turned out amazing. I didn't have a pie crust so had to sub in Bisquick for the topping, and I used corn, carrots and potatoes instead of just frozen veggies, but that's just personal preference, and next time I make this I might not have carrots and potatoes so I'll use the mixed veggies and I'm sure it will be just as good as it was tonight.

(Oh and if anyone is wondering, I used the 1 c. bisquick 1/2c. milk and 1 egg plus a little parsley for my topping...it was one the back of my giant box. Cooked at 400 for 30min)

I have made many versions of chicken pot pie.  This by far was the best!!! My husband even made a point of telling me this was the best one I ever made.  I increased the servings to 6 thank goodness, because there was not a drop left from the four of us.  I had to make some adjustments so that it fit in the 2 quart cassorole dish.  I too, used a bottom crust in addition to the top.  I cooked it exactly as the directions stated.

DELICIOUS!! We had turkey for Christmas and I had leftovers so I used turkey instead of chicken and it was still AWESOME!

Thanks for another great recipe! When I saw the name I knew it would be good. :) It was exactly what I was hoping it would be...the whole family ate it and that doesn't usually happen!

Great recipe -- a few comments though -
- I added potatoes; I put them in with the chicken so they cook pre-cook. 
- I did not add the parsley (didn't have any) and I halved the thyme and it came out great. 

The recipe fits in a deep dish pie pan - if you're using a standard pie pan you may be able to get 2 pot pies out of this recipe. 
I will definitely make this again, THank you!

This was really good!  The pie itself was very flavorful with a downhome taste from the chicken broth.  The gravy was perfect.  I probably could have cooked it a few minutes longer though so the frozen veggies would have cooked better.

Excellent recipe!  I used poultry seasoning instead of the parsley an thyme.  I also added about an extra cup of broth.  I like my pot pie to bubble out of the crust, which this one did.  I used a store bought deep dish crust.  It made it pretty sweet.  I will try some other crust next time.

Delicious recipe! I have never been a fan of pot-pie, but my husband loves them, so I decided to make it for him. Now I'm a complete fan of this recipe! Relatively easy as dishes go, and despite the fact that I forgot to put in the herbs, it was still really great.

This was pretty good!  I made a pie crust recipe for 2 9" shells so I could line the top and bottom of the dish.  Looking at the amount of ingredients as I was preparing it, I was glad I chose a 2 qt. dish instead of a 1.5 qt, as it made more than 1.5 qt!  I also had to bake it about 35 min., probably because of the larger dish & extra crust.  Will make again with these modifications.

Maybe I am just not a pot pie type of girl, but I thought it was super bland. My husband said it tasted like paper! I will probably try it again (may wait a while though) and see how I can jazz it up with some flavor.  Definitely has potential, but I need something with a bit more taste...

Classic chicken pot pie flavor, just as I remembered from years ago. I used one onion and then doubled everything else, and used a 9x13 pan. 

I used frozen chicken tenderloins on foil-lined cookie sheets, straight into the oven at 375 until cooked--I don't know... roughly a half hour, little less. Very easy to prepare the chicken this way while preparing the rest of the recipe on the stovetop.

I sliced the (2) pie crusts into strips and covered the rectangular shape of the pan. 

After the onion and celery were sauteed, I pureed them with a stick blender because I have an "onion hater". The sauce turned out smooth and creamy. 

This was a simple, simple meal that turned out great. Thanks!

Really good.  I've only made it once, but it was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a recipe that tasted more like the chicken pot pies that you buy when you eat out.  This was great!

great recipe it is one of our family favs. only thing I would like to add is that you cn use the water you boiled the chicken in instead of the chicken broth. I found myself with out the chicken broth and justed used the water and it still turned out great, since then I have alwayed used the chicken water instead of broth.

This was great. I simmered the chicken in 2 1/2 c chicken broth (enough to cover) and added thyme and sage to the broth. I then used 2 c of this broth and added 1/2 cup half and half to it to thicken the sauce. I used 2 crusts, and cooked it maybe 10 minutes longer. It was delicious!!

This is the best chicken pot pie recipe yet.  Although I vary on the veggies I use, I'm true to the rest of the recipe.  With regards to vegetables I typically use fresh carrots, broccoli, and pea pods.  The vegetables are steamed for about 5 minutes before adding them to the sauce. To me it's no more difficult to use than the frozen.  And for me the big bonus is it's an easy way to get my children to eat their veggies!  They love it!  It's a nice departure from the cream soup recipes that have become so common yet it's very easy to make.  I highly recommend it!

Thank you for this GREAT recipe.  Definitely worth the extra effort.  My kids loved it and my husband who was extremely skeptical said it was awesome!!
I used frozen puff pastry instead of the pie crust and it turned out well.

My family liked this, but we had to add lots of salt (but that's probably not the fault of the recipe, but due to the fact that I boiled bone-in pieces in 2 cups of broth and added enough water to cover.)  I will definitely try it again using all broth without added water!

OH MY GOSH!!! This was wonderful.  I love pot pie, and have always been so afraid to try it home.  I didn't want one that used canned soup.  I used canned veggies (drianed) and omitted the celery and onion step, the celery is already in the canned veggies.  This is such a keeper!!!! Thanks so much!

Thanks Corwynn for the recipe, well worth the time it takes to make this (i'm always slow).
Thanks for the tip Lynn about pre-cooking the potatoes and carrots!

Great recipe.  Use cream of chicken soup instaed of broth.  Just cook chicken in soup and add all other ingrediaents once chicken is cooked through.  Then put in a double crust.

This had such a good taste. I cut slightly frozen chicken breasts in cubes before I boiled it. I also added some cubed potatoes & sliced carrots in the water with the chicken. Didn't have any frozen veggies so used green beans, mushrooms and corn (as well as the potatoes & carrots). Used top & bottom crust and it turned out beautiful and delicious. Next time we're in the mood for pot pie, this will be my recipe. Thanks Corwynn for a wonderful recipe.

This was my first chicken pot pie and it was so delicious!!!  Since I don't like using frozen veggies, I used potatoes, carrots, peas and corn.  I also used half of the recommended amount of Thyme & onions.  In the mix, I also added salt, poultry seasoning, and black pepper.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I did do a two crust, one top and one bottom and it made it even better. My husband loved it and had seconds! This is a keeper!

Positively delightful, not your average chicken pot pie.  The gravy is very memorable, and I've used the boiling chicken in seasoned chicken broth technique on other recipes with much success.

This was OK. The kids nor my husband cared for it. It was very thick even before I put it in the dish. I even added some extra broth but it did not seem to help. Very time consuming. I probably will try a differant recipe next time.

Excellent.  However, I would use poultry seasoning or sage instead of Thyme.  I added both and it tasted great.

This is so good!  I made it with the idea that I'd have lots of leftovers to take to work, but it was gone the same day I made it!  Everyone in the family loved it, more importantly, the kids!

This was a really good easy recipe that the kids like too.  I like how versatile it could be with different veggies.  It's a keeper.
