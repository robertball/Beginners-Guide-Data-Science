WOW!  This is the best cod chowder I've had.  It even beats the recipe in the Yankee main dish cookbook! You just HAVE to try it!

I've tried a few smoked fish chowder recipes, but this is the one I keep coming back to. The parsnip is an interesting change from the usual potato. A winter family favourite.

Fantastic.  Never quite enough liquid, though - we add water to make it a bit more "soup-ey".

This is a delicous soup, but I had to do some adapting.  I couldn't find any smoked cod so I used some smoked trout as well as 1# of fresh trout.  I also had to use dried thyme.  I used 1# of potatoes.  They were organic fingerlings so I didn't peel them.  I didn't bother to precook the fish and just used chicken broth to cook the vegetables.  Then I added the fish and cream and simmered until the cream was hot and the fish was cooked.  Definitley use the fresh chives if you have them available.

This was really fishy and a little bland for my taste otherwise. My husband liked it pretty well though.

Since I stick with 5 star recipes from Allrecipes, there are very few that I find that I don't care for. This is one of them... It may have been that although I love parsnips, I didn't care for them as the focus of this dish. Loved the cod, the broth and the lemon combination. Thanks for sharing.

The cowder is really great but I think the cod is a bit bland. Maybe getting all smoked cod could work, or marinate it in something. In all, good recipe, but something more needs to be done with the cod!

I really enjoyed this soup. I didn't have any smoked cod but i added andoullie sausage which gave an excellent spicy, smokey flavor. My husband loved it as well.

This was a great recipe.  It was very tasty and I will definitely make it again.  One thing.  I didn't have any parsnips, so I substituted with carrots.  It turned out just fine though.  My husband ate four bowls:)

Used 2 salmon patties instead of smoked cod. Added some leek for color.

This recipe was very good, my boyfriend who is a native new englander loved it!  We both thought it did not thicken enough, but it could very well be my cooking error.  I would love it to have a bit of a spicy kick, but I have to remember I am in new england now, and spicy is not a new england trait.  

Great recipe I will definitely try it again perhaps with a bit of bacon.

Awesome!  had this before from a friend of mine from Maine. I had just smoked some salmon so I used that with the cod. Replaced the spuds and turnips with kohlrabi and rutabaga because that's what I had on hand. My friend always added some mushrooms and fresh garlic.

This was really great. I didn't have parsnips or smoked cod available, so I used white carrots and smoked trout. Otherwise the recipe was exact. Served with roasted cauliflower and whole grain bread, it was delicious, great comfort food.
