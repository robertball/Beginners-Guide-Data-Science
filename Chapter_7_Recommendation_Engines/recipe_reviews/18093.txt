OK, the only time I rate a recipe is when it absolutely knocks our socks off.  This one DID!  I read all the reviews and made the following modifications:  I doubled the batch of sauce, making a roux of the melted butter by stirring in 5 tbs of flour to make a paste and cooking it for about 1 minute (to get rid of the "raw" flavor of the flour).  Then added the cream (oh btw, I used heavy cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2).  I also added 1 can diced mild green chiles, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper & substited regular salt for the garlic salt.  I heated this all to a simmer then poured it slowly into the sour cream whisking constantly to avoid the curdling that others experienced.  The sauce came out creamy & perfect.  Other mods:  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion before sauteeing.  I used imitation crab meat.  (This would probably be 10 stars with the real thing).  And also I added 1/4 of the sauce to the crab/shrimp onion mixture before rolling up the enchiladas to keep the insides creamy & moist.  The 9 X 13 pan was perfect but it made 8 not 6 burrito sized enchiladas, tightly tucked in the pan.  Good idea to garnish with either olives or green onions or cilantro.  I didn't and it lacked eye appeal.  The taste however, totally made up for any presentation issue!!!  
Thank you Cathy!  And thank you all reviewers who helped take a wonderful base recipe and make it sublime!

This recipe required several alterations!  

If you like "saucy" enchiladas then you will definitely need to double the sauce recipe.  

I recommend adding minced garlic.  Use Pepper Jack cheese instead for some extra flavor and a little zip.  Use fresh cilantro in place of the dried parsley - and to give the sauce some added flavor - use a small can of diced green chilies, add extra garlic powder, and some cumin.  I use heavy cream in place of half/half and add a little whole milk - makes the sauce creamier.  You can thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch if desired - however the sauce typically thickens in the oven.  
For those who complained about the sauce curdling - you CANNOT let the sauce boil once the sour cream has been added!  Remove the sauce from the heat and add the sour cream at the end.  

Use corn tortillas if you want a more authentic flavor - especially the thick homemade style corn tortillas.

Also, be sure to add a little of the sauce to the shrimp (I used only shrimp) mixture.

Overall with the alterations it was a great meal - but not worth 5 stars.

With a little doctoring, this was great. The 9x13 in dish called for seemed way too roomy for just 6 enchiladas, so instead they went into a 7x11 in dish, and that was more snug--the sauce stayed where it was intended to. No problem with it being too thin, as some other reviewers had trouble with. I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion, and 1/2 cup sour cream into the seafood. I used all (one lb) imitation crabmeat (don't laugh) and it came out really nicely. The sauce needed something...so it got 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp coriander, and a dash or two of cayenne. And before sticking it in the oven, I garnished it with a handful of sliced black olives. Very happy with this one. Yup.

After reading the other reviews, I incorporated several changes.  First, I added two cloves of garlic with the onion and used only shrimp (an entire lb. because it's what I had on hand).  For the sauce I made a double batch and added a little flour to the butter, then added the half&half and sour cream - whisking constantly until it thickened (had no problem with curdling).  Upon tasting it I substituted cilantro for the parsley and added chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes and regular kosher salt instead of garlic salt.  Mixed some of the sauce into the shrimp filling and filled tortillas as directed (could only fill 5 tortillas). Reserved some sauce and poured the rest over the filled tortillas and topped with additional cheese.  Husband thought it was great, kids were so-so, but ate it nonetheless!  Original recipe definitely needs to be kick up-but was a good base to start with.

This was a great recipe. My husband loved these. I did however make some slight variations: used two packages of the imitation crab meat,no shrimp,a mix of shredded colby and monterey jack cheese, and the smaller flour tortillas. Next time I will leave out the sour cream and use just a cream and butter sauce thickened with flour,sour cream causes the sauce to curdle and it is a little thin.

These were delicious with some changes for personal taste. I used 6 green onions instead of white or yellow, 8 ounces white cheddar cheese instead of Colby, 1/2 cup half/half, 2T butter, 1t garlic powder and 1/2 cup green enchilada sauce. Topped each enchilada with 2T parmesan cheese. They came out great. I wanted to cut the butter for obvious reasons, but others had commented that the sauce was a bit bland. Since I agreed, I made these changes. Perfect with modifications.Thanks for the opportunity to use our creativity with this wonderful recipe, Cathy!

I made this for my family, and added 1/2can of chopped olives, 1/2 can of green chiles. This added so much more flavor, and if you really want to jazz it up, add the green enchilada sauce either over the top or on the side.

I liked it but it was very rich. I followed the directions exactly - and I think it could have been less rich and more shrimp added to the recipe because it was not enough! I would double to filling recipe!

It's really good until you get to the last third of the enchilada because it's very rich.

Made this tonight for the first time, and loved it! Found this recipe when looking for something to do with shrimp and tortillas. 
I read the reviews carefully and made the following changes: sauteed two cloves of garlic with the onion; used pepper jack, sliced finely; and only used shrimp, because it's all I had. 
After removing the shrimp and onion/garlic from the pan, I made the sauce in the same pan in order to absorb all of the flavor. I melted the butter first, then added some Wondra flour and whisked until smooth. I then added about a cup of light cream and continued whisking, adding garlic powder, kosher salt, and dried parsley. The sauce thickened more than I wanted, so I thinned it with whole milk. I poured it over the enchiladas, then topped that with the rest of the cheddar jack and one sliced jalapeno. The heat level was just perfect, and my husband couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be making it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  My enchiladas were perfect, and the sauce was to die for!  I used more shrimp, about 1/2 lb, and added some finely chopped fresh jalapeno to the seafood mix, along with a teaspoon of chipotle powder.  For the sauce I used a little more sour cream and about 1/4 cup of clam broth for a "seafoody" taste.  A dash of chipotle powder, too.  I put the broiler on for about 2-3 minutes or so to crisp at the end.  Garnished with fresh avocado, tomato, and chopped cilantro.  A winner!  Great recipe!

These were 5 star after a few revisions...4 stars made as is.  FILLING: I used 1 lb. imitation crab and omitted the shrimp. I added 3 cloves chopped garlic.  For the cheese I used colby jack.  I also added some of the sauce mixture and some sour cream until the filling was creamy.  SAUCE: I doubled the sauce.  I melted the butter then added about 1/2 cup flour to form a paste.  Then I slowly whisked in the half and half.  I added 1 can of hot green chiles, 1 tsp. chili powder and cumin, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste.  After this I removed from heat and added sour cream.  TOPPING: I sprinkled freshly chopped cilantro on the top before baking.

I just came accross this searching in google for a recipe of this nature to try out. I was craving seafood and mexican food at the same time. I had something similar to this recipe at a resturaunt. Wow! This meal was incredible!!! Easy to make as well. I however, had a few modifications. Fresh crab meat is the kicker here instead of imitation crab meat. It is a bit more expensive, but adds more flavor. I cut the tails off the shrimp. I added grounded red pepper and more garlic to the seafood/cheese mixture. I also added a few green diced chili peppers. I used heavy whipping cream so the sauce wouldn't be soupy. Using the heavy whipping cream thickens more as you bake too. I added jalapenos. I used a mexican blended cheese combination instead of colby cheese. I put guacomole a top the enchiladas before the sauce. What I recommed is not to use all of the sauce as it does tend to make the soft taco shells a bit too soft. What I love about this recipe is yes, you can add any garnish a top the enchiladas or any modifications to your liking and it will still be delish!! I am impressed and definately adding this to my recipe box!! Thank you for sharing this!! Very yummy!

The first time we made this I got confused and used cooked shrimp. It was rubbery and not tasty.  This time we used a 1 pound bag of raw shrimp (No crab- did not want to have to split up a bag of shrimp.)  We followed other's suggestions and used corn tortillas, added cumin, a little fresh cilantro, and 1 chipotle with some adobo sauce.  After cooking, I poured some green chile enchilada sauce (the can said "Hatch) on top and garnished with avocado and diced tomato from the garden.  Half-way through the cooking process, we realized that we did not have enough 1/2 and 1/2. We ended up supplementing with buttermilk.  We served this with some packaged green chile cilantro rice from Target (Archer Farms brand.)  The combo was wonderful and tasted like "gourmet mexican." Leftovers were even better!

This was a wonderful recipe...and EASY! I used pre-shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I also used minced onion instead of chopping up my own...my family likes that better.  I took some ides from other reviews and added a couple of extra ingredients.  I added to the onion, 1 tsp minced garlic with its juices, a small can of green chiles. I omitted the garlic salt.  The only other change was about 2 tsp  chipotle chili pepper.  When eating this, I was instantly brought back in time to a favorite dish I loved to eat at our favorite Mexican restaurant when my husband & I were dating...15 years ago.  My only complaint about the dish was the tortillas were soggy on the bottom, possible due to excess butter or maybe the crab meat releasing its juices...it was bagged and ready to eat.  I probably should have drained it well first.  I will, however, make this again!!!!

This was just ok for me. Can't put my finger on what it needs, but I thought the flavor was lacking. Actually, there is very little flavor in the fish, sour cream and half and half, and unfortunately the garlic just doesn't quite take this over the top. I don't think any other spices would help either. So, it was nice to try, but not something I would crave. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! Easy to make flavor adjustments.  I added Rotel and it was a big hit. I also doubled the sauce.

This recipe is five star worthy with some modifications.  I am glad I read the reviews because I doubled the sauce and added in a can of shrimp bisque soup for additional seafood flavor.  I also added some fresh chopped cilantro, chipotle pepper, white pepper, cumin, and coriander.  I mixed some of the sauce into the crab meat mixture and used shredded chipotle cheddar cheese...they were truly restaurant quality!

I didn't care for this recipe, but my husband loved it.  The sauce that covers the enchiladas is not very good, and as another couple of reviewers said, it curdles when the ingredients blend.  The first few bites of the enchiladas were good, but after that, the taste grew old, and I had a hard time finishing even half of one enchilada.  I think this would be better with chicken or beef, and the seafood mixture might taste more appropriate over pasta.

This recipe is very good - sauce was great.  I used a colby/monterey jack cheese blend, used the fajita-size tortillas, and added more shrimp.  WE loved it, and are going to serve it when company comes to visit.

I can't believe I didn't like this at all. Maybe it was because I used canned crab meat. I love seafood but for some reason this was so "fishy" that I didn't enjoy it. My husband thought it was okay. It was easy to make which I liked. I might try it again and see what I can do to tweek it to my liking.

These were awesome.  I took the advice of the previous reviwer and doubled the sauce recipe and did some of my own alterations.  I also used imitation crab... but they were still just delicious.

This is an awesome base recipie!  I followed some of the advice of other reviewers and added a small can of green chiles (chopped) to the sauce, a tsp of cumin and a tsp of chile powder too.  I also doubled the sauce recipe and slowly added the first ingredients to the sour cream with great results.  Used imitation crab instead of real crab with good results!  Yum-O!

I would've given this five stars but the sauce curdled while in the oven.  Any  idea why?  But it was still really really good!  I used imitation crab meat and it was delicious.

These were so bland and uninteresting that we didn't even finish our servings.  I will be using the Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas recipe (which I highly recommend) and modifying it for seafood.

I made a change and it worked well.  
I did not use crab.  I used shrimp & sea scallops.  They were large so I chopped them into small pieces.  I also added diced mild green chilis for some flavor.  This dish was great.  I topped the echiladas with a green sauce.

This was fantastic. I added crab meat, shrimp, scallops and mexi-corn along with one cup of the sauce that goes over the top. (I doubled the sauce over the top) The enchiladas were moist and loaded with all the seafood. Oh yea, one other thing, I added 1/2 block of cream cheese to the seafood mixture and let it melt down for thicker consistency. Delishhhhhh!

5 stars because I simply adore all seafood. I was able to make 7 of these and squeezed them into a 9*9 baking dish so the sauce smothered all of them. If I used a 9*13 the sauce would just run on the bottom of the pan which is why most people double the sauce recipe.

I tried using canned crab meat both times and it was very good, but I drained it with a strainer and squeezed it as dry as i could get it. Bad idea; you live and learn. Next time I'll use fresh crab, but if I have to use canned I'll drain it, not dry it so as to keep the crab flavor intact. 

Aren't great when microwaved

More cheese on the outside than on the inside please. Not too much on the inside.

I want to try adding more spices / vegetables. Maybe use half as much onions and add green onions instead?

These were delicious!  I used heavy cream instead of half and half.  I think that throwing in a handful of fresh cilantro would put it over the top.  Yummy!!!!  Thank you!

A very good recipe that needs a little extra to get 5 stars. A little bland for Mexican food so I spice it up by adding minced garlic, cumin, diced green peppers and cayenne to the filling. Saute these with the onions and add some of the sauce to the filling when adding the seafood.

Kicked up the spices a notch per other reviews. Still these were just 'okay'. Reminiscent of seafood lasagna -it seems like a good idea at the time, but then it doesn't really taste like anything.

This is my favorite meal to make, and everyone loves it. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and I loved it. Since then, I have experimented, combined other recipes, and made so many changes that I have a completely new recipe that fits my taste perfectly. I would like to add that combining a little of the sauce to the inside filling works out really well. I serve this with Rice, beans, Chi-Chi's brand corn cake and margaritas. Oh, and I have always used imitation crabmeat as well.

I've made this a few times, and it's always a crowd pleaser. I usually use 2/3 to 3/4 lb of shrimp and skip the crab, and I've found that corn tortillas tend to be better for enchiladas. I usually fry the tortillas in oil just the tiniest bit to keep them from cracking when they're rolled up. The sauce is delicious, I don't change a thing. It's rich, but not overpowering. I usually top with a little bit of guacamole or avocado salad. Delicious and very easy to make, but everyone who tastes it will think you've slaved all day.

so-so. wasn't crazy about the sauce. thought the filling would be a little blah so i added a can of diced green chilies and some corn. maybe if i tweaked it some i'd like it better. probably would not make it again without some SERIOUS changes.

I warmed the sauce on the stove, (3 on my stove), a low heat. The sauce did not curdle. However, in the oven, it did, due to the high temperature. If I were to make it again, I wouldn't add the sauce until the enchiladas came out of the oven. My husband and I didn't like this recipe, so I won't be making this again.

This recipe was excellent. I only tweaked it a bit, adding chopped green chile  to the shrimp/crab mix. This is a must and i added lots of cumin and cayenne. Due to cost i also substituted for imitation crab which tasted amazing and i can hardly imagine it being any better. This recipe tasted better than any seafood meal i have ever had from a mexican restaurant. This could easily be updated for a low fat approach, by substituting i cant believe its not butter skim milk fat free sour cream soy cheese and wheat tortillas, which i will try if i decide to diet.

I have been wanting to try a mexican dish with seafood and found thise recipe to be exactly what I wanted.  I made a few modifications.  1) I used green onions instead of regular.  I sauteed the white portion with a little of the green tops.  (I saved the remaining green tops for garnish) 2) recipe lacks flavor (thus the 4 stars, sorry)  I added cumin, salt, pepper, paprika and parsley to the meat mixture.  3) I used corn instead of flour tortillas.  4) I used heavy whipping cream versus the half-n-half.  I also, seasoned up this sauce with a little cumin along with the garlic salt, parsely and a dash of pepper and paprika.  5) The key to not getting a curd like sauce is to whisk it.  I actually will make it next time with about 3/4 cup or less of the cream (I thought this was too much) I spooned the sauce over the enchiladas just to get them wet NOT saturated.  I found that there was too much sauce left over (for my taste) and I ended up tossing about 1/4 cup or so out once I used what I wanted.  I then sprinkled with cheese and BAM!.......Once they came out the oven they were beautiful!  I garnished them with sliced olives, green onions tops, avocado slices, a dollop of sour cream and squeezed fresh lime juice for added flavor (GOTTA HAVE LIME JUICE!)  Had I not been so hungry I would've taken a photo to show how lovely they really looked =)

I generally don't do measuring with alot of recipes when it comes to things like cheese, I added to both inside and out.  When it cam

These didn't turn out as great as I had hoped. They were very rich, so rich that I had a hard time eating a whole one. However, my friend who came over to eat with me just loved them and asked for the recipe, so I guess it's just not to my tastes. I also will try a different kind of crab meat if I make these again, as I found the canned meat a bit fishy.

I served it with refried beans and fresh guacamole and chips!

These were really wonderful!  We subbed all low-fat products (sour cream, half and half, cheese), and I thought it turned out yummy.  (We are also used to subbing low-fat or fat free products, so keep that in mind.)  I added the sour cream off the heat so no curdling occurred.  We used real crab meat and double the shrimp--and they were great.  Even with the low fat ingredients, I could only eat one!

Excellent, I used the fat free 1/2 & 1/2 as I do on all sauces. used co/jack cheese. You realy need to enjoy this. So easy and so good. I also used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt to cut down on the sodium.

My wife made these wonder Seafood Enchiladas for us one night. Altering the recipe with our refrigerator contents and personal tastes. She used bacon grease instead of butter and added mushrooms to saute the onion. She used heavy whipping cream instead of half-n-half in the sauce, and cojack instead of colby cheese, it's what we had on hand. She double the sauce and added just a bit to the seafood mixture. I'm very happy that she is making them again tonight, as otherwise I'd be craving them for who knows how long. You gotta try these if you like mexican seafood dishes. :)

These are heavenly! Substituted imitation crabmeat for fresh because I couldn't find any, and it still turned out delicious. Even the people in my family who supposedly hate shellfish loved it! Good to make for a crowd too, and there were no leftovers. This is a definite keeper.

This food goes above your expectations.  I followed some others suggestions and used the heavy cream rather than the half and half and real crabmeat.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!!!!  I have not generally been a seafood person however this is one that I will make again. Also, I added fresh mushrooms to the crabmeat and shrimp filler.

This does not taste like the restaurant seafood enchiladas I had in mind.  I followed the recipe as listed and my husband did not like this dish and asked that I not make it again.  I thought it was okay, but to get it to taste like the 'restaurant' kind, you need a lot of alterations.

Other than the sauce being a little too thin, they were good......and very easy.Maybe some diced japs in the seafood mixture and a little cumin in the sauce would benefit. I topped with diced roma tomato and a little green onion.

Delicious. I don't usually tweak my recipes but I did after reading reviews on this one. To the shrimp I added garlic and a little cumin. The sauce needed help so I added a can of drained diced green chilies, cumin, chipotle pepper powder & cilantro instead of the parsley. I used less sauce because it was so runny and just drained out the green chilies that sunk to the bottom of the pot. Used lots of cheese on top as this seems to help thicken the sauce while cooking. Also no crab all shrimp. Very easy.

My family esp. my husband "inhaled" these up! I made a double batch and I changed the original recipe a little using the previous reviewers suggestions. I made a thin white sauce base using the butter and some cornstarch with half skim milk and half light cream. I let it cool to lukewarn and then stirred the sour cream in. No curdling problem. I also used a bit more garlic. I put a little of the sauce into the seafood mixture to bind it too. I cooked them for about 20 minutes before topping them for the last 10 with the cheese. We like the cheese to be nice and soft and gooey not baked too hard. We will have these again soon. Thanks.

These were incredible and incredibly easy! (Thanks Cathy!)  I didn't have any parsley or cilantro (wish I did, it would have been even better), but it came out super anyway!!  Also, I used corn tortillas for a more  "authentic flavor". I made some with chicken and some with shrimp. Both of my kids (picky eaters) LOVED it!!  This is going on my "foolproof-kid-friendly-meals" list.  The only thing I might change would be the amount of the sauce...we like a lot of sauce! ;)

I can't believe these turned out so good...especially after all the things I did to screw them up. Used skim milk instead of half and half, low fat sour cream, and half the amount of butter. And, I used shrimp and crab from pouches, not fresh. Even after all of that, these were awesome. Excellent flavor. Easy to make, even for those of us who aren't very good cooks.

I have to agree with another reviewer, a few modifications and this was an excellent recipe. 
I made enough filling for 10 enchiladas by increasing the amount of shrimp and yes, the imitation crabmeat (which still tasted great by the way). I used gloves of fresh garlic sauted with the onions instead of garlic salt and used a monteray jack/colby cheese combo. I doubled the sauce ingredients, using fat free half and half and reduced fat sour cream in an attempt to cut down on the amount of fat and calories. I also used cilantro in place of the parsley and added slightly more sour cream in order to make the sauce a little thicker. I only poured 1/2 the sauce over the enchiladas before baking and saved the rest to add before serving. The sauce did curdle as other reviewers indicated that it would, however it wasn't a problem and they still looked and tasted terrific. Thanks for the recipe! My family devoured these and are already asking when I'm going to make them again.

This can be an excellent recipe with a few modifications.  It's hard for me to imagine Mexican or Tex-Mex food made with garlic salt and Colby cheese.  

Cooking garlic with the onion and omitting the garlic salt, using Monterey Jack instead of Colby, and using cilantro instead of parsley makes this a really fine Mexican-style dish.  Also, Mexican crema in place of sour cream is an added benefit.

This was a main course for a Cinco de Mayo dinner and it turned out great. I made it with canned crab and canned baby shrimp (minced in the food processor). The only 'problem' was, as other reviewers stated, the sauce 'curdled'... so I made a second batch of sauce and added to the pan after baking and it still 'curdled'. My mother suggests adding the sour cream very slowly after removing it from the heat - so it's lukewarm. I'll give it a try next time. There will definitely be a next time.

Now one of our 'keepers'! The sauce thickened beautifully, making a rich, creamy base for the seafood and slightly crispy tortillas. I added a 1/4 tsp of red pepper, and will add a 1/4 cup of white wine next time (didn't have any on hand). Bonus- this is SO quick to make if you prepare the sauce while you're preparing the filling. Great recipe!

These were absolutely delicious!  I served them for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  I added several garnishes - sliced olives, chopped cilantro, fresh chopped tomatoes and green tomatilla salsa.  I prepared with Spanish Rice II - which was also very good.  Will definately use this recipe again!

Don't do this recipe with imitation crab meat.  I tried to be cheap and the taste
became disdainful after a few bites.  Other than that, I would recommend this 
to those that love seafood and mexican food.  I had it with mexican rice and spanish corn.

This was very good, although I used garlic powder instead and a bit more than was called for. I also made more of a casserole than regular enchiladas. I layered small flour tortillas in a pan topped with the meat mixture, another layer of tortillas, and then poured the sauce over all. It's a keeper.

Very tasty.  I made some modifications to fit what I had in my kitchen.  Omitted the onion.  I used can crab and shrimp instead of fresh.  I had gruyere and mozzarella cheese so I used that instead of colby.  I combined the shrimp, crab and cheese in a bowl.  I heated CORN tortillas in the microwave to make them pliable.  I filled each tortilla (I used 9) and rolled them up.  I used a 7x11 greased glass dish.  For the sauce, I melted the butter in a sauce pan then added HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.  Once heated, I removed from the heat and let cool for a few minutes.  I then stirred in fat-free sour cream.  I had some leftover filling so I sprinkled it over the enchiladas.  I poured the sauce over the enchiladas and baked for 30 minutes.  I will say that the sauce probably was not enough because the tortillas dried out a bit on top.  Next time I will double it as some other reviewers suggested.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it numerous times.  I added a can of chopped green chillies and sliced black olives.  To save time I have added dried minced onions, which works well too.  Also, I've tried this with tomato based enchilada sauce in the can and it's just as good.  It saves time and calories. Very easy and helps me get my mexican food fix.

This was amazing!! I tweaked the recipe slightly by adding a diced green chile and two diced tomatillos. I also added a splash of white wine. It came out great, the only thing I would change would be to add more spice (perhaps a dash or two of hot sauce) and I would have made more of the enchilada sauce.

Wow!!  This recipe is a keeper.  My husband who generally isn't a big fan of cream-based sauces ate 2 helpings.  As others suggested, I made a few additions to the sauce.  I used heavy cream and a little milk (because I didn't think there would be enough, there was).  I added a small can of chopped green chiles, cumin, cilantro & powdered cayenne pepper.  I also added a few spoonfuls of the sauce to the seafood mix.  I think it made it easier to work with when filling the tortillas.  I used corn tortillas and served it with guacamole and cilantro/lime rice.

I recommend really stuffing the tortillas. The sauce does cook all the way down, so I am glad I had extra sour cream, lettuce, tomato and salsa to top.  Delicious!

Oh My Goodness ..... This was awesome.  Used scallops instead of crabmeat and doubled the shrimp.  I put a tsp of Old Bay Seasoning in the sauce & used pepper jack cheese & garlic in both filling & a white sauce.  Thanks Cathy !!!!

Dont get these if you want spicy enchiladas. They are more of the creamy plain type... good but I will likely not make again.

THIS IS AWESOME! I normally don't rate recipes, but I always read the reviews since it helps me gauge what may need to be tweaked.  I agree with doubling the sauce, adding cilantro, cumin and using heavy cream instead of half-and-half. My son picked this recipe for Father's Day and boy did he pick a winner.  This is a restaurant quality dish! Excellent, excellent.

This recipe was easy, quick and easily modified to your taste. I added cilantro, garlic and a touch of hot sauce in to seafood mix, (used mussels, crab and shrimp). This was a big hit with my whole family for grandpa's 78th birthday. Thanks!!

I just ate this and thought it was really disappointing.  I found it pretty bland- I doused it in hot sauce.  I am surprised that a mexican dish would have so little spice.  I would recommend spicing this up if you plan to make it.  Also, I used jumbo lump canned crab meat.  My grocery store doesn't carry real crab meat, and I've always found this a bit tastier than the fake crab meat.  I wouldn't even bother making this if you don't have real crab meat (the canned didn't cut it.)  On the plus side, my boyfriend liked it and he's not even a big seafood fan.

Sorry...I made this recipe using most of the other reviewers suggestions and was really disappointed.  The only thing I changed was instead of flour tortillas, I used whole wheat.  My family found it to be pretty bland even with all the good seasonings.  The prep time was WAAAAy off!  Didn't think this was worth the cost or the effort.

These were pretty good!  Nothing outstanding (and honestly, I expected more out of it based on the reviews I read). I'll probably fill up the tortillas more the next time.  I made them with both flour & corn tortillas and hubby liked the corn much better.  They were good though and I'm sure I'll make these again!

I have made this recipe three or four times and it is a real show stopper-I recommend using fresh shrimp.  This is VERY RICH, so this is what I do to lighten it up:  use "light" products, especially cream, and I found that putting some light pico de gallo on top as a garnish balanced it out.  Also, you can serve spanish rice on the side, and that way it's smaller portions and the dish goes further.

Wonderful recipe!  Did modify a bit according to other reviews.  Used cumin and chopped green chilis in the sauce, also added chopped garlic to the onion mixture.  Doubled the sauce.  Snipped fresh cilantro on top before serving.  We loved it.

Very good... Like other users I spiced up the sauce a little w/ some paprika and garam masala.  I thought the sauce was a bit too thin so next time I think I'll add some flour to thicken it up.  Instead of Colby I used a 4 cheese Mexican blend.  I'll definetly make this again!!

these are easy to prepare, but are lacking some spice. they're awfully creamy; next time i might throw together some tomatillo sauce or add some jalepenos for flavor.

I was so disappointed with the end result of this dish.  The flavor was pretty good, however because of the consistency of the sauce, the texture was terrible.  I doubled the recipe like many others recommended, but it was too much and the torillas were just soaked.  I will try and make this again, however I will try and find a different variation of the sauce.

I made this recipe for a group of my girlfriends last weekend and the enchiladas were delicioso!  Also very simple because you don't have to cook the crab and shrimp.  The sauce was perfect--nice and creamy and easy to make.  This recipe will definitely be a favorite and I will make over and over.

A+++++! This was so easy to make and quite delicious! To lower the fat content I used used low-fat half & half, low-fat cheese and slightly reduced the amount of butter. I like a little more spice so I also added some red pepper, a dash of chili powder and some garlic to the seafood filling mix. Topped it off with olives and a little green tomatillo sauce.

Very good, and different from the typical ground beef, or chicken.  For those who are fats-concious--I used margarine for butter using about 3 T. for the whole recipe, and skim milk was used instead of half and half.  It still had the rich, moist, creamy flavor in the sauce.

If you like the flavor of green chilies, you'll love this recipe.  I added a little old bay seasoning and mixed it all together, then stuffed the shells.

My husband's favorite foods are seafood & Mexican.  He says these are the best enchiladas he's ever had.  I followed Caren's recommendations.  Thank you!!  I made 1-1/2 times the sauce instead of doubling as cream was low.  I skimped on the butter and used a mix of half-and-half and 2% milk, 5 tb butter & 5 tb flour for the roux.  Not at all runny, no curdling of sour cream and very tasty with added spices and chopped cilantro.  I had no diced green chili or crab.  I used 1 lb of shrimp.  I added a bit of extra salt to taste and topped with sliced olives.   While it set after baking, I spooned on some leftover pico de gallo.  They were beautiful, incredibly filling, and flavor was wonderful.  If you have experience with cream sauces, this recipe is easy!

Good base recipe but very rich as is.  My changes are as follows: used shrimp only sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning and also sauteed minced garlic with the onion.  For the sauce, only used 1/2 cup of half-and-half, subbed cilantro for the parsley, added 28 oz of green enchilada sauce.  For the topping, I used sliced black olives, avocado and chopped cilantro.   Very flavor and tons of sauce.

The flavor was OK - and got better the next day. If I make these again I would add more spice; these were a little bland. My biggest complaint against this recipe is that the sauce curdled and looked pretty unappetizing, as other cooks have found.

This was amazing! Since there was only imitation crabmeat at my store I substituted swordfish. I also added baby spinach and fresh diced tomatoes to me stuffing.

I made this recipe for dinner party last night. It was awesome! I read a lot of reviews and decided to go with Caren's suggestions. After I melted the butter and sauté the onion I did add 5 tablespoons of flour to make a roué . Then I added a cup of half-and-half and a cup of heavy cream, I don't like my food too spicy so I only added a 1/4 teaspoon of the chili powder 1/8 of a teaspoon of the cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, & 1 tsp organic pink salt. I also added some minced garlic to the sauce the flavor was amazing. Next time I will add less flour to the roué  probably only two or 3 tablespoons, as I always put some sauce in the bottom so it won't stick the pan, sauce was a little too thick and my tortillas did stick a little bit to the bottom. I also took Caren's idea of putting some sauce in with the seafood so it wouldn't be dry , that was a good idea I'll do that again! I did top with sharp cheddar cheese and chopped up cilantro and parsley and it looked really nice. A definite crowd pleaser!.

Good base start. Crab over powered the shrimp. Sauce did curdle somewhat. I will use spice suggestions from other reviewers next time. I also plan on using corn tortillas for a more casserole type dish.

One of my favorite holiday recipes; Mom always made her version around Christmas. Changed a few things. Used one pound of shrimp, not 1/2lb. While cooking the meat, onions and cheese, I added about 3/4 cup of tomatillo salsa (store bought). I had some left over meat/cheese/onion mix, so I added that to the sauce once it had warmed. Turned out great! Girlfriend was hesitant at first, ended up loving it!

It looked and smelled amazing when I was finished. The first couple of bites were amazing, but I couldn't finish one whole enchilada myself. My roommate LOVED his, scarfed it right down. I think maybe it was the half and half? it was way to rich for me, ended up needing to eat a couple of tums later on that night. If i make again Ill use a less rich sauce. The filling was perfect though!

This recipe was exactly as I hoped it would be. I served a shredded lettuce salad with finely chopped tomato along side of the enchilada on each plate.   I did not have parsley, but that made no difference in the taste, according to my family.  I Will use less butter in the future, but other than that I will make this again for special guests that visit our home.  If it were possible to give 10 stars, I would do that!    Thanks Cathy. This recipe will get lots of use.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I started by sauteing some shallot with the onion (had half a red onion in the fridge, so I used that), then lightly sauteed the chopped shrimp and a chopped up tilapia fillet. Stirred in half the cheese (used pepper jack) with the seafood and set it all aside for a minute. Made a roux using 1/2 a stick of butter and about 5-6 Tb flour, cooked slowly, then added maybe 1.5 cups of buttermilk (which I also had on hand and needed to use), and whisked while it cooked on low for a few minutes. Then I turned down the heat and stirred in the sour cream and about a cup of green enchilada sauce. I added a couple sprinkles of garlic powder and cumin, while whisking over low heat. Once done, I mixed about 1/4 of the sauce into the seafood mixture.

My corn tortillas refused to bend, and would only crumble, so I made them into a tortilla layer, put half the seafood on top, put half the remaining cheese on top, then another layer of tortillas, the rest of the seafood mixture, another 1/4 of the cheese, then a final layer of tortilla. I poured the sauce over it all, then put the rest of the cheese on top. Baked at 350 for 32 minutes, served with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro on top, with ribbons of zucchini sauteed with garlic and lime on the side.

Highly recommended, despite all my substitutions! I love these casseroles, they are a great way to use up ingredients you need to use!

My favorite Mexican restuarant in Hilton HeadI  made a Chimi del Mar and I've missed it so. This is like it except they added some rice and a little of the sauce in the filling mixture. Thanks for this recipe, it's the bomb!

As written this would have been way too bland for our taste.  So I sauteed bell and mildly hot peppers with the onion, added real garlic to both saute and sauce, added cayenne, chili powder, cumin, and paprika to taste.  Let sit for close to 10 minutes after pulling it out of the oven to help the sauce set, which worked perfectly.

These were OK. Although I was more pleased wtih the outcome than my husband was, I wasn't WOWED either.... Even after making significant alterations to the sauce (upon reviewing the ingredient list, I knew it was in need of serious doctoring), these were still too bland for my liking and soggier than I would have liked. As Caren did, I too made a roux with flour and added diced green chiles, chili powder, cumin and cayenne pepepr to my sauce. I did NOT use whipping cream (I had half-half in my fridge that needed to be used up) or double the sauce recipe and I stuck with garlic salt as directed. My only other change was to add a smidgin more than 1/4 c. of sauce to my seafood mixture to add a bit of moistness (with half of my chilies added to it - the other half went into my sauce). I was just serving two people, so I stuffed my enchiladas VERY full. I was able to make exactly 4 (8 in. size - personal preference) enchiladas with no filling left over. NOTE: Straight out of the oven, these are REALLY soggy. After setting up for 10 minutes, the consistency was much better. Served wtih a sprinkling of chopped green onion and tomato and Mexican rice / refried beans on the side, this was an allright meal. Thanks for sharing, Cathy! :-)

Great base for a recipe!  I used real crab and top-quality shrimp.  I would incorporate many of the changes the other reviewers suggested, including working a can of green chiles into the sauce or the filling, increasing the amount of sauce (don't worry about it being too thin; will thicken with the cheese when baked), adding a little hot sauce to zip it up a bit, serving with avocado & tomato, adding some of the sauce to the filling so it doesn't dry out, and placing some sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding rolled enchiladas.  Ole!

This is amazing! I altered it, just slightly by using a tablespoon of minced garlic and celantro instead of parsly.  My husband loved it!  It's very rich so I served it with a nice green salad and white wine.  This is a keeper.

Soooo good!  Big hit for New Year's Eve dinner.  I used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 crab.  For the filling, I used jalapeno mexican 4 cheese blend and regular mexican 4 cheese blend for the topping.  In the sauce, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, cilantro instead of parsley, added a can of ortega diced  chilis, and a dash of chipotle pepper powder (didn't measure it).  And, I used corn tortillas instead of flour (flour tortillas are typically not used for mexican enchiladas).  Be sure to quick fry the corn tortillas in hot oil to soften them, so they roll easier and don't break.... this is the more authentic mexican style of preparing enchiladas.  Definitely will make these again...soon!  Also, I served it with the Archer Farms (Target brand) Cilantro Lime rice(suggested by other reviewers- thank you!!).  It was a perfect compliment.

I followed many of the reviews and doubled the sauce. I added some sauteed green onion to the filling for color. I also doubled the shrimp.  Perhaps I am weird, but did not care for the crab (even though I sprang for the good stuff) and next time will make them with just shrimp!

Loooooooved this dish!!!! I've been searching in vain for a seafood enchilada dish (home-made, or otherwise) that compared to a Mexican restaurant back in my college days, but have fallen short, till now! I did follow many of the modification tips others gave (e.g., making a "roux" with butter/flour, etc), but quite honestly, it made for a lot of extra work, which I'm not sure was really necessary. Next time, I'll follow the recipe to a "t" and compare the results. Thank you for sharing! Will definitely make this again!

This is pretty good.  A little bland.  I used imitation crab meat though so maybe it's my fault.  If I try this again I will definitely splurge for real crab meat.

It could have used a little more zing - next time we are going to try all or half Monterrey jack cheese.  I also used less margarine and it came out fine.  Also, I used 4 fajitas and a 8x8 pan, and I thought that worked well.

Great recipe! I made six enchiladas and used sea legs (fake crab) and left the shrimp whole. I doubled the sauce and put more of the stuffing in the tortillas. Topped off with a colby/jack mix. Everyone loved it!

I agree with DSHIP2, this recipe is excellent as written.  I recently had this at a local restaurant and searched for the recipe and now I have found it.  Only thing I changed was the cheese.  Didn't have Colby on hand, so used shredded Mexican and it was excellent!  Thank you, Cathy, for sharing your recipe!

One word:  WOW!  This was so rich and delicious.  I used closer to 1 lb.jumbo lump crabmeat from Costco in this dish.  I also added one small can of green chilis and minced garlic per other reviewers' suggestions that the dish needed some "oomph".  Be sure to put a spoonful of the sauce in the shrimp/crab/cheese filling to make it moist.  This is company worthy.  Thanks for an excellent recipe, Cathy!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made it for a large family gathering and now I'm 'on the hook' to make it every time we get together!  I've read the suggestions and even tried a few, but this recipe is delicious just the way it is.  I enjoy the subtle flavors of the creamy, cheesy goodness that surrounds the crab and shrimp.  Fresh seafood is expensive and I would rather taste that than a lot of spices. This recipe is also a perfect jumping off point for a spicier dish, if that's what you prefer.  Thanks for adding a wonderful new favorite to my seafood menu!

The sauce is bland.  It is just ok.  I was disappointed in light of the great reviews.  I even made modifications as suggested the second time and though it was better, it was not great.

With the addition of some seasonings, these were great :)  I used green onions as opposed to white... I don't like the taste of white.  To both the sauce and the shrimp mixture, I added finely chopped garlic, parsley, and salt & pepper.  You really want to beat the "bland?"  Try adding 2 TBs of cocktail sauce to both the enchilada and the sauce... I think that's what really made a difference!

This was very good!  I was very happy with the way it came out. I do like a saucy enchilada so next time I make these I will double the sauce.  I also used an imitation crabmeat, which worked well but the real stuff would have been even better. This one has earned a permanent spot in the dinner rotation.

Watch out...this recipe is RICH! Gave my husband a stomach ache after eating only 1 enchilada. I thought it was good, but only if you eat a small amount at a time. Thanks for sharing though. It was fun to make.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  My husband and I always prepare it for special occasions or when we have guests over.  The only bad thing is that it's so good there are never any leftovers.

These were better than the seafood enchiladas at most of the Mexican restaurants I've been to. I used canned crab and shrimp, but I think next time I will omit the crab (personal preference). I'm sure with fresh seafood, these would be amazing. I added diced green chiles to the seafood mixture, along with some of the sauce so the filling wouldn't be dry. I definitely recommend doubling the sauce - it seems to cook down a bit when baking. I topped the enchiladas with Colby Jack cheese, and more sour cream once they came out of the oven. This is a recipe you can play with - the flavors balance out nicely!

This was pretty good.  I followed the suggestions to make a rue with the sauce but I don't think that I will do that next time. I didn't have any crab meat so I just used all shrimp.  I also used fat free half and half and lowfat sour cream to cut down on the fat.  Even so it still seemed like a very filling meal.  I also used fresh cilantro instead of parsley.  It was a nice to change from the average enchilada.

I would have given this a 5 star, but like one other taster said, needed more sauce!... Delicous though!... Made more sauce for leftovers and was delicious!  I garnished with avacado slices and sliced olives; I always add a lil dash of cayenne to give sauces a kick.  Definitely will make again!

This recipe was very tasty and not too heavy since we eliminated all butter and used olive oil to saute the onions, crab meat and shrimp. I also used many of the suggestions provided by other members. For the sauce I used heavy cream instead of half 'n half, added 1/2 cup of clam juice, minced garlic, fresh cilantro, a small can of diced green chiles, dash of cayenne, 1/4 tsp of cumin and a little corn starch to thicken. I used canned crab meat and mixed the crab and shrimp with a little sour cream in addition to the cheese. All it needs is a little more punch. I will used jalapenos next time.

I made this for my family, and it was an absolute hit even with my hard to please husband!  I added chopped roma tomato, fresh cilantro and chopped green onion to the top before baking, and I used the pre shredded mexican blend cheese from Kraft.  Fantastic recipe.  I will definitely add this to my recipe box.

The flavor was excellent. The sauce was a little runny so I will use cornstarch next time. I had no trouble with curdling.

The only problem is that there are no leftovers!

These were delicious.  My husband loved them.  I even used fat free half and half and light sour cream.  Be careful to not let the half and half mixture get too hot.  My phone rang as I was heating it, and in the few seconds it took me to pick it up, the mixture got too hot and changed texture.  Didn't change the fantastic taste though.

These were excellent!  I made a lower-fat version, using fat-free sour
cream, fat-free half-and-half, low-fat tortillas, and only two tablespoons
butter (instead of four) in the sauce.  It's still got a lot of fat from
all the cheese though... Mind you, if you're going the alternative
ingredient route know your ingredients beforehand (some fat-free sour
creams are really bad, some low fat tortillas don't bend, some imitation
crab is horrid, etc.)  I took a suggestion from another reviewer to
add two chopped green chilies to the recipe to add a little kick.  It had
good flavor both with and without this, though I slightly preferred the
spicier way.  I also buttered the bottom and sides of the baking dish
to prevent sticking. Oh, one last thing: I didn't have a problem with
curdling.  That may be because there wasn't any fat in my half-and-half to
separate.  But even if it does curdle, that doesn't mean it's bad to eat!
I feel really bad for the past reviewers that saw some curdling and threw the
receipt out.  This is a keeper.

This is a great recipe.  The sauce was a bit runny so the smaller pan is perfect.  Using imitation crab will ruin the recipe.  It just doesn't have the right flavor.

good.  I used imitation crab meat.  It was a little to 'fishy' tasting.  I would have perfered a more garlic taste. I'll make it again with some modifications.

Had to edit my review. When I followed the recipe, I didn't like it at all.  I omitted the crab and I LOVE it!  I'm not a fan of crab but I've found that I really hate imitation crab; that was what made the difference for me.

This is an excellent recipe but does need a few modifications.  I used Monterry Jack cheese (2 cups)instead of cornstarch (as others suggested) to thicken up the sauce and I added small bay scallops and fresh minced garlic to the seafood food mix.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks!

This recipe is GREAT inspiration,  I say that because I followed many other suggestions on here and got WONDERFUL results.  I sauted a little minced garic with the onion, made twice the sauce, and added about 1/2 cup of sauce to the seafood mix before rolling in the shells.  Also, I read the notes that this sauce can be thin, so I whisked in 2 Tbls of cornstarch to the 1/2 & 1/2 before adding the sour cream, which thickened it up nice.  Still curddled slightly (sour cream will do that when cooking) but tasted EXCELLENT.  Definately a keeper!

This recipe is absolutly delicious even if the sauce is a little thin and curdels in the oven! I found that by adding some chopped sea scallops or whole bay scallops, the recipe comes out even better. This has become one of my favorite mexican dishes. It is also great garnished with gucamole and sour cream and served with mexican rice and beans.

I was so excited to try this recipe!  My husband never orders anything other than Cancun when we go to Chi Chi's.  I should have listened to other reviewers about the sauce curdling.  What a waste.  I ended up throwing away an entire 9x13 pan.  It was awful.  Still looking for that perfect sauce though!

really great recipe. The only changes we have made is to use all immitation crabemeat, minced and doubled the sauce. We have this at least once a week and the little 3and 4year grand-children love it.

This was an awufl mess!  The sauce curdled and looked terribly unappetizing.  Followed recipe exactly and the whole thing turned to a spongy mess after baking.

Awesome!  I made mine lowfat by using fat-free half and half, light sour cream, fat-free tortillas, and 1/2 cup of the cheese in the mixture, then just a sprinkle on top.  Yes, the sauce did curdle, but to me, it looked like ricotta cheese looks in Italian dishes, so it didn't matter.  I think I might add cornstarch next time to thicken it (was a little thin).  I would suggest some green onions in the mixture, just to give it some color.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband doesn't care for seafood enchiladas and he woofed these right down.  I used imitation crab meat because the only fresh crab available are crab legs (lots of work to get all the meat) and expensive!  They probably would have been better with fresh crab but were still very good with the imitation crab meat.

We used crab in a can, and I think real crab would have tasted MUCH better.  Also, we added salsa to liven up the sauce a bit (too much cream and cheese).  This dish was really easy to make but not very good (could have been the crab in a can), and given how fattening it is, not worth making again.

These enchiladas are delicious...I made a few small changes by (1) substituting monterey jack cheese for the colby cheese and (2) omitting the parsley and using cilantro both in the filling and sprinkled on top before cooking.  Very tasty.

Here are the mods/details for what I did:

* Used ~12oz imitation crab meat /
* ~12 oz Colby Jack cheese /
* 9 soft taco-size flour tortillas (~8-9 inch) /
* Subbed 3 Tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro for the dried parsley /

I doubled all the sauce ingredients and spooned some of it into the mixture before wrapping the enchiladas as others have directed.

This was more than enough food for me and my 2 sons (they can eat quite a bit). I'd probably scaled back slightly to only make 6 or 7 enchiladas. I also think there was too much sauce. Unless you like A LOT of sauce, sticking to the amounts in the recipe would likely be enough.

This tasted a little TOO buttery to me, so I'd maybe scale back on the butter.

Even though I tried to prevent the sour cream from curdling (didn't bring things to a boil and stirred it in later), it still curdled some. Perhaps I'll try whisking it in next time instead of stirring.

Overall, this was decent, not great. I'd probably make it again, and perhaps try real crab meat next time as that might improve the taste a bit.

I had the same problem as others, curdling and overwhelming onion...and I LIKE onion, but I wanted to taste the seafood.  Onions come in many sizes.  I'd say my chopped onion was more than a cup.  I may make this again following advice of others:  stir in sour cream after removing mixture from heat to prevent curdling;  less onion; add some spices, cumin or maybe Old Bay.

I used a very large onion so I did increase the  recommended amount for butter to .
So easy to prepare and so very delicious.  I did garnish with chopped Roma tomatoes and Fresh Cilantro .
Will definitely use this recipe again.

I cooked my shrimp in Old Bay and used fresh parsley. Otherwise I cooked as written and it was really good! I didn't want to use too much seasoning and over power the seafood.

I could not find fresh crabmeat (just whole crabs), so I used canned crab meat.  That may have been the problem.  For some reason the cream sauce did not bake creamy, it seemed to curdle.  I will eat them, but can't rave about them.

This was a hit! I did feel it was a bit rich so I scaled back on the butter a bit. I only had shrimp on hand so I used 1 12oz package of shrimp which equates to the same total amount of seafood the recipe called for. Next time I will use the crabmeat and I feel 1-1.5 lbs of seafood would balance well in this recipe with the richness in flavor. All in all very tasty and Easy

Fabulous! We made exactly to the recipe and it was the best seafood we've made - period! We doubled the recipe and used a 1 lb. can of lump crab and some shrimp scampi. We've made many other recipes such as seafood lasagna and scallops lemon cello and this is by far, our favorite! Reheats well in a 300 F oven for 40 minutes. Yum!

I made an account because I had to rate it. It was awful. I followed this recipe, and even took advice to double up on the sauce. The sauce curdled during the cooking process (in the oven), and it was severely lacking in flavor. I order seafood enchiladas often at many restaurants and never have I eaten anything compared to this. I will stick to buying this particular dish at a restaurant.

My family loved this! I did add more shrimp to this and in the shrimp and crab mixture, I added a bit of sour cream and it added more flavor.  I also cut up some hatch chilies in the cream sauce and added more flavor.

This dish was amazing! I only made a few tweaks to suit my family's tastes and my kids (who don't like seafood much) asked me when I can make it again--before they even finished eating! I followed other reviews that suggested doubling the sauce and I'm glad I did. Some said the sauce wasn't thick enough so when I doubled it, I used 1 cup half-and-half and 1 cup heavy cream. One recommendation I would make is not doubling the butter because after cooking, much of the butter was floating at the top of the dish. I also added about 3-4 Tbsp of chopped green chilies to the sauce and nothing spicy to the filling since we're not a spice-loving bunch. It was just enough. I used shredded Colby-Jack cheese because I like my cheese a bit more creamy and that made it perfect! I will be making this recipe over and over and over again!

Admittedly, I used a combination of shrimp and scallops, which we loved, but the flour tortillas got pretty mushy and unappetizing when baked in the sauce.  I think next time, we'll forgo the "enchilada" part and just serve the sauce and shrimp/scallops over linguine or angel hair pasta.  Definitely will make this again, though.

I didn't like this. I think the canned crabmeat was the turn off. The smell and flavor was not appealing to me.

This is amazing. I made the reviewers requestes changes regarding increasing sauce and I also used heavy cream, omitted sour cream in the sauce and used whole milk. I also added 1 tsp of the following: garlic powder, taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, onion powder, seasoned salt and black pepper to the sauce. This is definatly a make again recipe.

Pretty good, I thought.  Nobody else did, though.  I doubled the recipe and used smaller tortillas.  It made tons of sauce.  I used heavy cream, as others have suggested.  For my taste, I'd half the crab amount and double the shrimp amount.  I used Monterrey Jack cheese rather than Colby because I thought it would go better with the sauce.

I'm not a fan of seafood but my family is,  so I made these. I found myself lacking in shrimp, so I used extra crab. We found the sauce to be too buttery for our taste.  Next time I will use more real garlic for a more interesting flavor and a bit less butter.

Excellent.  Even with fake crab this is fantastic.  The only thing I would change is adding some more salt and spice!  This was almost a little sweet, not as savory as I wanted.  Still tasted great though.  Also, I accidentally used about 1.5x the amount of shrimp called for, plus doubled the sauce and the result was that I needed a second, small pan to fit all the enchiladas in!

This recipe was not good... I read all the reviews and took some of the suggestions.. I thought it was ok, until about 10 minutes after dinner I became sick because of the sauce. Far to much dairy that curdles.  I thought at 1st it was ok, until I caught the texture.  Leftovers went from the fridge, and in to the trash.  Bummer too... I was very excited about this recipe.

I modified it  based on other reviews and they were GOOD, One "purist?" suggested elsewhere on AR that 'flour' tortillas didn't make enchilada's...had to be corn. NOT in my opinion, or those of many others, I LIKE flour tortilla's...sorry. I used TJ's Argentinean Red shrimp and a can of Lump Crab. Quite good when it came out of the oven. Also my 99 yo Dad loved it..."that might be the best thing you've cooked for me". I provide his lunches for the most part.

This is fantastic! I added the sour cream to the sauce after I took it off the heat.  I doubled the sauce, adding a tsp. of corn starch while it was heating, and added a cup to the crab (Imitation) mixture before I added it to the tortillas to make it more creamy. I also skipped the shrimp and did add 2 poached cod fillets (chopped)  to the imitation crab mixture (1 lb.)  I then put the sauce over the top, along with shredded cheese over the top of the sauce. I added about a tsp. of cumin to the sauce mixture, and didn't add garlic salt, but a bit  of garlic powder and fine grain sea salt. I served with lemon wedges and sliced jalapenos on the side. It reminds me of my favorite dish at the local Mexican restaurant....will be making this often! This made 8- 10 inch enchiladas.

I used the recipe more as a suggestion to get me on the right path to seafood enchiladas but ended up making it my own with some modifications. I didn't have enough cream and wanted to increase amount of sauce as others recommended, so for the sauce I ended up using 1/2 cup cream, ~1/3 cup white wine, thickened with 3 T flour, 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies (including liquid), ~1/2 cup vegetable broth, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, and 1/4 tsp cayenne, and left out the sour cream because the sauce was already perfect. I also added a bit of the sauce to the filling and used pepper jack cheese instead of Colby. Garnished with fresh cilantro.

This was freaking amazing. Im giving it 4 stars cuz the flour tortillas were soggy on the bottom so it was more like a wet burrito than enchiladas, next time I'll use corn tortillas. Only changes I made was using diced fresh tomatoes on top after adding cheese and I used the rest of the stick of butter and more cream and sour cream for the sauce, after reading reviews for more sauce and this is so freaking good. It's not spicy so if u want heat add some or hot sauce. Amazing flavor thank you !!! Update::::::: made this again using the corn tortillas and used only shrimp and added poblano pepper and bell peppers on top and used some with the onions. Fabulous Recipe

As written it was bland.  I made it again. Sauteed onions in butter, removed from butter and added to crab mix.  Doubled the shrimp (rough chopped) and added minced garlic, pimento and a serrano pepper with old bay seasoning and 5 oz cheese.  Made roux and added cayenne, heavy cream and complete seasoning to other ingredients for sauce.  Adjusted seasoning for sauce and mixture.  Added 1/2 ladle of sauce to crab mix and bottom of dish.  Rolled, topped with sauce and cheese.  I used about 5 oz mix of monterey and pepperjack cheese on top.  Baked as instructed, let rest for 5 and topped with Rachel Love pico de gallo and crushed tortilla chips.  Made 4 large servings.  Served with lemon pepper asparagus.

These are really good, and almost the same as were once serves at Chi Chi's restaurants.  Next time I will add some lobster meat and juices to the recipe to give it a bit more decadence.  Nice recipe!  Thank you!

I made this for Easter dinner for the family and everyone loved it! I used fresh shrimp, crab and crawfish tail meat since they are in season and have a lot of flavor.  I also doubled the sauce as others have recommended. I put all the sauce ingredients in addition to 1 tsp of cumin, 1/4 cup mild green chilies, 1/8 cup  pickled jalapenos, 1 cup fresh cilantro into a blinder and used heavy whipping cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2. I also eliminated the butter since it is not necessary since I sauteed the seafood in the butter and poured the juice in the blender after i removed the seafood.  To increase the presentation I put sliced black olives and green onion on top of the cheese before baking.

These were delicious! (Though very rich) I used some of the suggestions, namely making more sauce. I  made a roux with 4 T flour and 4 T butter, added a pint of half and half and some cumin, chili powder and cayenne. Heated until it thickened up then took off the heat and added just under a pint of sour cream. It was a bit thick so I added some milk to thin it out a bit.
Used real crab and already cooked small shrimp which I cut into smaller pieces. I used flour tortillas. My trick is to dip the flour tortilla in the sauce  then place in the pan, add the crab/shrimp/cheese mixture, roll up then cover up with the remaining sauce. I had plenty left over after dunking all the tortillas. I ended up with 8 enchiladas.
Then I covered the pan with foil and baked for 25 minutes, removed the foil and added the cheese (I used white cheddar), sprinkled some paprika and cilantro on top for color and baked uncovered for 5 more minutes to let the cheese melt.

Loved these...with my own adjustments of course!  I used shrimp, chunks of mahi mahi and 8 ounces of lump crab (NOT IMITATION!).   I sautéed a whole onion and five cloves of garlic in butter, added my fish and seasoned it all with 1 tsp of old bay seasoning, 1 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Added a mix of shredded pepper jack cheese and Mexican cheese to it and simmered until cheese was melted.  Made the sauce as shown except I added 4 ounces of melted cream cheese as a thickener.  Yum...will definitely make again.

I made it once with the original recipe-but kinda bland but still good.. Was better with the green sauce over it.

OMG! You can not, will not be disappointed! I add a bag of bay scallops to the crab/shrimp mix. I also add creole seasoning. Both of these make it over the top amazing. I have made it as written then changed it up a little. The start recipe is great.

I would give this recipe more stars if I could!  This recipe is simply delicious and would highly recommend it for any gathering from a family dinner to a fine sit down dinner with guests you want to impress.  I followed the recipe with the exception of swapping tilapia for the crab. I LOVE crab but didn't have any available. The cream sauce was fabulous, the dish did not have an over powering seafood smell or taste, leftovers the next day were just as good! My husband is not a huge seafood fan, and my daughter is the pickiest eater EVER and they both couldn't get enough. My daughter actually declared it her new favorite meal ! I would highly recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I have never made seafood enchiladas because I have a famous chicken enchilada recipe but this is definitely a keeper. I added imitation crab with the shrimp because I originally planned on making a seafood pasta salad and scrapped it. My family wasn't excited about the change but ended up eating the whole thing.

This tasted like straight onion even after I cut out more than half of the recipe and doubled the sauce. My boyfriend is from Mexico and he said it tastes nothing like a enchilada and that I have made better enchiladas before. The only one who liked it was my one year old.

After tasting it I figured it needed some kick. So I fried some chili arbols in oil and crushed them up. Then added them to the mixture. The lil heat gave it some extra flavor. I will definitely be keeping this recipe. The family and co workers thought it was a hit.

With the suggestions on changes, this was a hit!  Without the green chilies, cumin and chili powder, this could have been very bland.  Was just perfect with it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

got a lot of props for this recipe at a party!  I think I'm going to add some cod next time.  The recipe can use a lil more crab and shrimp - I would increase the crab and shrimp content by about 50% more each.  Everything else was awesome as is. =)

A very good recipe to play with. I did it as is and I could see using it to make a rich seafood lasagna because the parsely and garlic gave it an almost italian flare. I will use cilantro and maybe use it as a filling to chile rellenos. For enchiladas, it does need tweaking. It needs a little chopped garlic, a good asadero or monterrey jack cheese, cilantro and green pepper of some kind (A poblano, green chiles, or jalapeno). I will keep this recipe but as is I would rate it 3 1/2 stars because its a good base recipe

These enchiladas were great!  I substituted "fake crab" for real crab and used whole wheat tortillas and reduced fat sour cream and it made a lower calorie version but with the same great flavor.

I used all shrimp otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Am I the only one that had the sauce curdle? Next time I will make my usual white sauce with sour cream and spice it up with some chilies.

I have made this dish several times and it is an excellent recipe as is and very easy to modify to your individual taste.  My version needs to have less fat so I use 2% cheese, reduced fat sour cream and instead of using half-n-half, I puree reduced fat ricotta cheese and combine it with fat free evaporated milk.  As other reviewers did, I make extra sauce and prepare it with a traditional white sauce roux.  I add some of the sauce and RF sour cream in the enchiladas along with chopped green chiles.  When preparing for guests, definitely add garnish for the presentation and get ready for rave reviews and mucho compliments about your cooking!

Oh my my.. these were to die for! Absolutely delish! I doubled the sauce recipe and added Cayenne pepper and Cholula hot sauce to give it a nice warm spicy flavor. The sauce is so rich it needed a little spice to counter it. Otherwise it was amazing! We cannot wait to make this again! I also used Fat Free Sour Cream and the sauce still thickened once it cooled a bit.

My husband loved this. I thought it was a little too rich but still good.  I used about 1/4 shrimp and 3/4 imitation crab. Next time I'll probably do more shrimp, as the imitation crab isn't my favorite and the real stuff is just too expensive.  I used flour tortillas as the recipe calls for, but I think I may try corn next time.  Also, next time I'm definitely going to try adding a minced habanero pepper to the cream sauce to add some heat.

Love this recipe.  The only things I changed were instead of dried parsley I used fresh, and I couldn't find just Colby so I used a mexican mix for the top and colby and mont. jack for the inside of the enchiladas.  I plated it with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, salsa and cilantro.  Everyone at dinner loved it!

GREAT recipe! I tweaked to maximize the ingredients I had on hand.  I think the beauty of a great recipe is that it lends itself to tweaking due to ingredients on hand or dietary limitations.  Here's the breakdown: 1 lb. shrimp (omitted crab, didn't have any), used shredded mozzarella cheese (didn't have colby), used 1/2 C heavy whipping cream and 1 C 2% milk (didn't have half-and-half) after making a roux with 1/4 C butter and 5 T flour (recommendation from reviews).  All else stayed the same although I did season the mixture liberally with salt, I think this is an important step not listed in the original recipe.  Even with the tweaking it turned out great.  Enjoy!  (PS-I'll totally make this for friends!)

These were super nummy i used one bag of mini shrimp and 2 bags of 8 ounce packaged crab. i tried but still in the oven some of my sauce curdled :(  which my husband noticed while taking a huge bite of his  burrito. I did double the sauce as some reviewers suggested I did add two tbl. of cornstartch to thicken the sauce which left it with a really nasty smell and taste so next time I wont do that. I paired my burritos with iceberg lettuce and beans on the side. I liked the taste but I will keep looking for a better sauce more like the one at Paradiso in my home town I like that it stays on top of the burrito alot more

My husband, myself, and three of our four children thought this was a fabulous dish!  We used imitation crab...easier on the budget, and very tasty.  Several reviews have mentioned making extra sauce; we served canned green chile sauce over the top of ours, like a restaurant might.  A great combo--added flavor and moisture w/o the fat.

Excellent recipe.  My family raved about the enchiladas.  We eat a lot of Mexican food in our house and this will be one of our favorites.

This is our new favorite enchilada recipe! I didn't have any crab so I used sliced baby protabella in it's place. I also took the advice of another review and used corn tortillas. EXCELLENT!! Will make again and again. Would be great for a dinner party...

This was delicious, even my friends that are not seafood fans loved them!  I also doubled the sauce and made a rue as others suggested.  The other thing I added was fresh tomatillos.  They added a nice tanginess that complimented the enchiladas well.  YUM!!

The onion should be very small. I added 1 tsp. minced garlic, 4oz green chiles, and 1/2 c. sour cream to the seafood filling. To the sauce I added 4oz green chiles and several dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce, just to kick it up a little. I also thickened the sauce with a corn starch-water mixture. In the end, I was able to make 5 enchiladas in an 8x8 pan, and I had extra sauce. I will definitely make these again.

I was worried about how the recipe was going to turn out since it was my first time making enchiladas of any sort and I skewed from the original recipe quite a bit.  I wanted to make enough for 10 enchiladas and I had the PERFECT amount.  I followed Caren's changes to the recipe.  I didn't have enough heavy cream so I mixed it with 2% milk to make it about 2 1/2 cups worth.  I used 1 package imatation crab meat that I shredded with my hands and almost 3/4 bag of jumbo shrimp cut up into pieces.  I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the sauce some.  I didn't add sauce to the enchiladas like Caren did.  I didn't want it any messier rolling them up.  So I just poured the entire amount over the enchiladas ensuring to get the sides.  I was able to stuff 10 enchiladas into the 9x13 pan.  With about 8 minutes left in the cooking process I topped some cheese on top of the sauce and when it was done cooking, I placed sliced avocados on top.  The enchiladas came out VERY tasty and moist!!!  LOVED THEM!!!  I paired the dish with black beans (with sprinkle of cheese on top) and spanish rice.  My parents and husband claimed it was restaurant worthy! They were quite impressed.

This dish is absolutely AWESOME! I used what I had on hand, i.e. clove garlic and I mixed some shrimp, canned crab meat and baby scallops for the sea food part the rest was verbatim and it turned out great.

I think this recipe needs modifications. Use corn tortillas for more authentic taste. I use cream, cerrano chile, lime juice and garlic to make a sauce. I saute onion with shrimp and add lime juice. I place a large spoonful of the mixture into each tortilla, add the sauce, shredded cheese and cilantro. Then pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas.

I had some mistakes, but this still turned out nice.  I forgot to add sour cream (just made a roux with flour (and the butter and 1/2 & 1/2), and also added a can of chopped chilis and 1 tsp chili powder, and salt too it)  I used fresh garlic cloves.  I doubled the seafood, and meant to quadruple the sauce, but accidentally only doubled the sauce.  (which actually follows the recipe.)  Then I ended up layering the dish like lasagna instead of rolling up each enchilada....this was super easy and still turned out fine.  Tastes way better with condiments and garnishes.  Husband though a 5 star recipe.

When I made this the other night for dinner, I had several different palates to feed; so I had Colby and pepper jack cheeses and a can of diced green chilis to add.  The sauce is very rich, but it bakes up very nicely.  You may not want to add anything if you are serving it with a spicy side--which I didn't.  My crabmeat was fishy, so I was wishing I had only used the shrimp.  We felt this was a good recipe but that it needed doctoring.  This has all kinds of possibilities, so thanks for the starting point.

These were amazing!  I followed Serena's rating and would recommend it other than using half heavy cream and half an half for the rest, or half and half for the entire thing as the recipe calls for.  It was very rich using all heavy cream.  Not to mention fattening!

We had leftover crab from our crab feast the night before so I was searching for a great seafood recipe and found this. Amazing! I used the base recipe and all of reviewer Serena's suggestions. I highly recommend reading her review before making these. Five stars with the alterations.

I was really hoping that this would be a 5 star recipe in my book as it sounded so tasty. It was simple to make but we thought it lacked any taste or flavor. I made the sauce exactly as directed and my 1/2 and 1/2 still curled, leaving a weird texture. Leftovers were soggy and the immense amount of butter in the sauce gave each bite a slick feel. Sorry, but I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was great! I made it last night for me & my husband & it is definatley a keeper & something I will make often! I did double the sauce recipe as some other people had mentioned & thought that it was a bit too saucy for me & the original recipe did not need to be doubled. Overall it was a great & easy meal & I will definatley be making these again delicious :)

These were awsome, i made a few changes, i added fresh garlic to the onion mixture, added cheese, swiss and colby to the white sauce and also thickened it with flour. poured that all over the rolled enchiladas and then added grated cheddar cheese on top, i also stuffed them with shrimp, crab meat, scallops and fake lobster. I also added swiss cheese along with the colby to the seafood mixture. 
These i will make on a regular basis my family loved them

Outstanding recipe as is. I customized using fresh 1/4 c cilantro in the seafood mixture. Doubled the sauce mixture adding cumin and a small can of green chilis. Oh yes and as usual I make a casserole instead of rolling the enchiladas. Truly a wonderful recipe!

I didn't like this at all.  I tried some of the enhancements (extra chile peppers, cilantro, chili powder and red cayenne pepper) and still thought it lacked...a lot.  I'm giving it three b/c my SO really enjoyed it and I didn't try the original recipe.  I might give it another try is he insists, but this was not for me!

YUMMY!!!!!! i followed caren's review tips also and it is good! i also used immitation crab meat and topped the enchiladas with olives for garnish. everyone loved them!!!! i do think i would add a bit more spice next time and maybe a little bit less flour for the sauce. it was good, but i think a little thinner sauce would be even better.

Super yummy!!! I doubled the sauce...... it  curdled in the oven, i think i left it in too long (will watch way more carefully next time)-- but it still tasted amazing. Also used imitation crab meat because its all i had on had-- really good still.. Also did not have any colby cheese on hand so I used swiss and Monterey jack.. FANTASTIC. I will make again soon......watching more carefully in the oven! Try this recipe mmm!

I made the Seafood Enchillada Recipe last night that received rave reviews by about 180 people. I loved Chi Chi's Cancun and it was suggested that this was the same or better. I did something REALLY wrong to it. The sauce curdled badly and made the enchilladas soggy. It ruined the whole appeal of the food. The recipe made 8 enchilladas and my family only ate three of them because of the lumpy sauce. I rescued the other 5 and need to find a good cheesy sauce to put over them so all that seafood does not go to waste. My husband doesn't really ever want to see them again if I can't fix them into something edible. I was thinking would Campbells' Nacho Cheese Soup or another Condensed Soup doctored up work?

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these cheesy enchiladas! However.... I used 1 pound of shrimp instead of using crab meat... and added some artichoke hearts to the recipe... it was delicious!

These are extraordinary! Made extra sauce, as some suggested, and put some into the filling mix. My fiance still talks about these and we made them months ago...

A great, different, recipe.

I thought these were pretty good as is, but I thought they needed a little more flavor, so I added some fresh chopped cilantro and that gave them a little more zing. Overall, pretty good.

Good, but personally I think it would be better with corn tortillas. My husband and son, however liked it just the way it was written. I did use the extra spices that were suggested in the reviews and I was glad I did. I think it would have been rather bland without them.

This was good, but I think I need to do some tweaking before I can give it 5 stars.  I like a saucy consistency with dishes like this, so I may follow others suggestions for such.

I really enjoyed these! I am a college student who is just now learning how to cook. I made these enchiladas for my boyfriend and I and we loved them. They were easy and fun to make. I doubled the sauce and that made them perfect!

I cut this recipe in half to feed 2 people and we still had leftovers.  I added some garlic to the onion.  Doubled the sauce, and added to it 1/2 can chiles, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I thickened the sauce with flour and may skip on this next time - it was a little to thick for my tastes once it baked.  I removed the sauce from heat before I added the sour cream.  I also added a spoonful of sauce inside of each tortilla.  My husband enjoyed this more than I did - I think the crab flavor was overwhelming - maybe next time will use less crab and more shrimp.

Very good, will make again.  Edited 6/8/11: Made these for a second time after several years and we didn't really care for them.  I even added cumin, garlic and cilantro and they were just blah.  Not very good at all, I'm trying to think of what I saw in them the first time around.  Changed my rating to 2 stars.

This was an awesome recipe!!!  I followed Caren's modifications and this was a rave hit!!!!  I served this to three generations of my family, and everyone loved it.   I used fake crab too and put in a little more than double the shrimp.  This made about ten 6-inch tortillas. Follow Caren's modifications and you will not be sorry.

This recipe was good. I added a little rice to the shrimp mixture.  I thought it was tasty- I only used 1/2 the sauce since it was so rich.  Since my husband doesn't eat seafood we used strips of steak for his- great results!!  I would make again.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I would have prefered more sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe and include a spoonful in each tortilla before I roll them.  Other than that they were good and we'll try them again!

Ok this was good but even with the adjustments for the curdling the sauce still curdled. We could eat ours it was fine it just was a funny texture. I am thinking the problem was using fat free half and half but I was curious if it would work. I think something other than sour cream should be used. I used dry cilantro instead of parsley (prob should use a little less next time. ) didn't use a whole onion and added spice (cumin, chili powder, cayennne, garlic to the seafood) as well as a can of diced chilis which I further chopped. Ran out of colby because I I added a tad extra to the middle and used some cheddar on the top. Might experiment with other cheeses. A little heavy but we enjoyed it.

It came out really good. I was looking for just crab enchiladas but maybe I'll tweak it to that next time. Adding cumin and cayene to the sauce is a big plus. and of course guacamole and salsa on top.

Very good!  The only thing that I did differently, was I dipped the tortillas in a little salsa and fried in a little butter for a minute or two on each side before I filled them.  I baked two enchilasas in individual little glass baking dishes for convenience!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've always wanted to try & make these at home since my husband loves them at the restaurants. So I made them as a surprise for my husband, one night. And it was a great surprise because he loved them!! I think I've made them 5 times in the past few months!!!

I've made these so many times and have gotten rave reviews. I do use cilantro instead of parsley and Chihuahua cheese. Starkist now sells both shrimp and crab in pouches... an easy staple to have in the cupboard and you can throw these together at whim!

These were VERY rich!  I usually figure on two enchiladas per person.  Not this time.  One was all that was necessary.

I used imitation crab. HUGE mistake. The sauce was super rich, I might try to tone it down a little next time. Has good potential.

Was okay.  Taste's better with cooking or real sherry added to the sauce along with some lobster stalk.

If I were to make these again, I would definitely add more to them.  I thought the sauce was bland and thin.

Yum!  I love 'em.  I learned the hard way to buy already peeled shrimp.  Otherwise, prep time takes FOREVER!  I added some ground red pepper for a little kick.

This recipe was awesome!  This was my first try at any kind of mexican food and it was great.  I used boiled, shredded chicken breast instead of crab meat though because that's what I had.  I also added cilantro, a little cayenne pepper, a little Franks hot sauce, and a little extra 1/2 and 1/2 to the sauce.  I also added a little green pepper and 1 clove of garlic to the onion mixture.  I was just surprised at how awesome this turned out!  Thanks Cathy!

My 7 year old daughter spit hers out. I expected that because I don't think she likes seafood, so I had a back up meal for her. I was surprised when my husband took a bite and said he couldn't eat it. I was really surprised when I tasted them and did not like much. I love crab legs. The flavor seemed off. I don't think the shrimp blended well with this. The sauce was good but it did curdle.

Yummy.  I used LOTS of pepper jack cheese instead of colby for a little "kick" and low carb (wheat) tortillas.  Will make these again.

This is THE best seafood enchilada I will EVER have! I went to a friend's house for dinner one night and HAD to have this recipe! I've since made it twice, and we're having it again tonight (Easter)! It's flavorful, fast and easy, and great for either entertaining or a special dinner at home! You have GOT to try these!!

My girlfriend and I thought these were delicious.  They tasted almost exactly like the seafood enchiladas I have ordered in restaurants.  They are a little too rich for me to make too often, but we will be making these again in the future.

Awesome! I made a few changes/additions, but our whole family loved them! Instead of the garlic & parsley, I added some pesto to both the filling and sauce. I also had a lot more shrimp and a lot less crabmeat. I added extra cheese and used low carb (wheat) tortillas. Delicious!

This was great with a few substitutions.  I used medium-sized shrimp and imitation lobster.  After creating the sauce, I put a can of diced tomatoes and half a can of tomatoe paste to give it a more "salsa" taste, versus the sour-cream taste.  I would suggest using smaller tortillas and perhaps corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  Enjoy!

This was fabulous with a few adjustments.  I added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit and I added a few tablespoons of the sauce to the seafood mixture.  I also used artificial crab since no fresh was available and I substituted aged chedder for the colby cheese. The whole family loves it and there was no leftovers. I will definitly make this again.

Very good recipe! I used more shrimp than crab though (since shrimp is a little cheaper) and it came out wonderfully! I did take the advice of using a little of the sauce in the shrimp/crab mixture and it was very moist! Next time I think I will put more sauce in the middle and less on top since it did curdle a little bit. Very good taste though!

I think this is a good recipe, maybe just afew adjustments will make it amazing. Adding cornstarch to the sauce and adding sauce to the seafood mixture would help keep them from being so dry, which is what was my biggest issue. The ones I like at restaurants are very creamy, so next time I am going to do it differently.

The filling for this recipe was great.  Thank you to whoever came up with the idea of adding green chilis, that was a wonderful addition.  The sauce does need improvement.  I put very little sauce on the enchiladas before baking, and yes it did curdle.  But the big problem is the thinness of the sauce.  I added corn starch, but it didn't help much.  Maybe its because I used fat free sour cream and half and half.  I will keep the recipe for the filling, possibly using it as a stuffing for chicken breasts or served over rice.

I did not read the reviews before making these, if I had, I think my rating would have been 5 stars.   I used Fat Free sour cream and did not have an issue with curdling, but the sauce all was absorbed by the enchiladas while in the oven, so they weren't as creamy and rich as they looked before I put them it.  Next time I make them, I will save half of the sauce for after they come out of the oven, and maybe use some of the additions suggested by other reviewers...green chilies on the inside sound great!!!

The flavor was very good. However, the sauce was thin. Maybe cooking the seafood before adding it to the dish will reduce the thiness of the sauce.

This is a very Atkins friendly dish if you sub the tortillas for low carb tortillas.  I added chili powder and cumin to the seafood mixture.  I also followed previous reviewers suggestions by adding a large fresh clove of garlic to the sauce.  These were very good thank you.

This is fantastic!  I used a whole dungeness crab, 1 pound salad shrimp, 1 clove garlic, and the pepper monterey jack cheese.  I doubled the sauce recipe to have extra to drizzle over the baked enchilada.  YUMM!!!!

"Delicious." - a direct quote from my husband. I did add chili powder to the crab/shrimp mixture and I used real crab meat. Yummy!

These were delicious.  I sauteed mushrooms in with the onions and used home made tortillas.  They were wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe!

Husband loved them.  Sauce did curdle in the oven.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe and save half for the dinner table.

These are very good, but if only they weren't so high in fat.  I will try to use no fat sour cream and lower fat cheese next time.  We had guests that night and everyone loved them.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used fresh crab.  But wow, this recipes sure calls for a lot of super rich dairy ingredients!  So I cut back on the cheese cream and sour cream measurements just a bit to make myself feel better, and it still turned out great!  I also put fresh cilantro green onion and chopped tomato on top.  It was awesome!

Great, however it was a tad bland to me.  I would add more spices, salt, pepper, etc. to it.  Also, DEFINITELY use real crab! :)

First had these at Chi-Chi's in Colorado. I can't tell the difference. They're quick, easy and good.
