Don't you love it when a recipe (like this one) tells you to season "to taste" and then some bright bulb reviews it as "too bland". If you season it *to taste*, then it can't be too bland unless your taste is bland, and then you shouldn't be complaining! People are a riot, aren't they?

This is a perfectly serviceable recipe for roasted potatoes. Just make sure you salt and pepper "to taste".

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I will have to try it again a few more times to work the kinks out, but had a good start tonight.  I must have cut my potatoes too thin, because they only took about 20 minutes to bake.  I just flipped them over and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up.  I also used too much oil.  I didn't bother to measure.  Next time I will use just enough to coat the potatoes.  I also used season salt rather than regular and I like them.  I think next time I will try some powdered ranch.

This recipe is great!  Like some of the other reviewers, I also added a couple of ingredients.  I used onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and seasoned salt.  I mixed all of the ingredients in a ziploc bag and threw the potatoes in there to coat - this was much easier than using a bowl.  I will definitely be making these again.

I have allowed myself to add some BBQ spieces which made it sensational. One mistake though, added more oil than needed. not fatal but less oil, better.

So simple and so delicious! I love it when a few ingredients you have in the kitchen come together to create something so good. I opted for a little kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Although you may feel tempted to add additional herbs or spices, this is really wonderful due to it's simplicity.

This is nice for "on the fly." Definitely don't use too much oil and I added garlic salt, which added a nice flavor. I sliced them fairly thin and cooked about 15 minutes, turning over half way through.

Can't even fathom anybody criticizing this recipe - it's as basic as a "pure potato" recipe can get, and that's not a bad thing. EVOO, salt & pepper shaken up in a zip-lock w/ the potatoes - wonderful! Just as good w/ the addition of paprika and garlic. But really, this recipe is the potato equivalent of the grilled cheese - Simple. Good. Yum. Season to your heart's content, but at the core of this recipe is a moist hunk of potato. Repeat. Yum.

Good standard roast potato recipe there was nothing extraordinary about them, but they were delicious. I dressed them up with salt, black pep, seasoned salt, rosemary, and parsley. I will try it with garlic & onions powders and paprika next time. I cut them pretty thin and it virtually took 20 mins for them to cook nice and crispy.

Excellent!  My mom (who was from England) used to make a variation of these when I was a kid.  I recommend cooking just a little longer per side for a really crunchy wedge! Thanks!

These are so good and such a healthy alternative to fried potatoes.  I added some garlic and onion powders to give them some more flavor and baked at a higher temp. These went great with our burgers. Thanks Vanezza.

These were delicious!  Very quick and easy.  I used only about 1/4 of olive oil and that seemed to work fine.  Baked in the convection oven they were moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Better than french fries!  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been roasting potatoes this way for years.  Didn't know they were considered 'English' though.  I also make my own Italian Dressing and marinate the potatoes a few minutes and then roast so I guess mine could be considered 'English-Italian', huh?  This recipe is fine as is though and is so adaptable to tweaking.  Thanks for this one.

I've made these several times but have not taken the time to review.  They are in the toaster oven and Im having a glass of wine so I thought I'd do it now.  We love these. I'm serving them tonight with East Carolina BBQ's,roasted veggies and salad. I just drizzle XXX Virgin Olive Oil on them after I've cut them(like fries, but not too thin)& put them in a produce bag I've saved from the store. Saves washing an oily bowl and recycles the bag.  I use these for lots of things and even get an extra one every now and then.  I use Celtic Sea Salt and pepper and they turn out great.  I do bake them in our toaster oven (just 2 of us) at close to 400.  Thanks much for the recipe.  Much healthier than crappy old frozen fries with all their additives. Occasionally I sprinkle garlic or parmesan, but tonight they're mostly naked with S & P.  10/6/09  making these again tonight with garlic powder and parmesan to go along with the cream cheese jalapeno popper burgers from this site.  third time i've made the burgers in a week.   i used ground turkey and seasoned the meat and the cream cheese mixture, also added a little shredded cheddar tonite to the filling.  these are great!!!

I've been making these for years. It's a nice easy/less fattening alternative to fries. I like to change up the seasonings every now and then (sometimes I add garlic powder/basil/romano cheese to make them italian... sometimes I add mexican seasoning.) Yum!

Simple and delicious, and healthy. I'll be making these again and again. For what it's worth, I was preparing another dish with this (Crispy Coconut Chicken Fingers) and thus needed the oven @ 450. I placed these on the lower rack and followed the above instructions otherwise...including cook times. They came out great and were not overdone.

Well, my Mom brought over 20 lbs of potatoes last week (and 10 lbs of onions!) so we are practically having potatoes three meals a day, every day! LOL! I coated these with Seasoning Salt and they were great! Thanks for the post.

I added garlic and oregano to red potatoes and ate with ketchup - they were great. They are crispy and make a wonderful alternative to fries.

Can't go wrong with this basic recipe. Try variations like garlic, rosemary or parmesan cheese.

We thought these were a good alternative to fried potatoes, although we do prefer the fried.  I made a mixture of 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder, and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne to sprinkle over the potatoes.  They came out nice and spicy just like we like them.  Some of us dipped them in ketchup and some of us in Ranch dressing.

These were delicious but there was way to much olive oil for my taste.  I will start off next time with 1 tablespoon.  I also took the advice of others and added season salt, pepper,and parsley.  I also broiled them and they turned out so crisp! Make sure you cut them thin for extra crisp potatoes. Will make again! Thanks:)

Really Awesome Basic Recipe! So much better for you than fried potatoes and really tasty. My entire family loved them. I used fresh ground sea salt and ground pepper and baked them for the time suggested and then broiled for about 4 minutes to get them just perfect, just as another reviewer had suggested. Two Thumbs Up!

It's marvellous. I add mushroom and onion with a little bit salt.  The taste is great and perfect as a side dish of my steak.

These were very easy to make...forgot to spray pan and they were a little difficult to get out.  I followed other's advice and used garlic powder.  Overall, pretty good.  Will make again!

I have made these potatoes for years and my family love them. But now I only use Pam to spray the potatoes as it really cuts down the fat and we are all looking for way to cut the fat. Try it with Pam instead and you'll just love them.

I tried these potatoes today and loved them. The only thing I did different was to peel the potatoes since I don't care for the skin. Will definitely make again.

Awesome, but there more like fries, right? Anyways, I add onion powder and garlic salt. I went a little light on the oil just because I was feeling heathly for a change... and I was running out.

Also, I mixed the potatoes in a large zip lock baggy instead of a bowl. It was easier that way, I thought. That way, I could mix anything else I wanted in there with it. :D

This was easy, fast and everyone liked it. I'll so make it again. Thanks for the recipe :3

This was OK.  I added salt, pepper, and Rosemary.  Cooking time was more like an hour, and yes, they were cut into wedges that weren't especially thick.

These were very tasty. Best way to describe them is Baked Potato Fries. I recommending preparing a sour cream/chive dip for them.

I too used only 1/4 cup oil.  They were very easy to make, and had a nice texture when cooked but were too plain for me.  I will doctor them up next time with minced garlic, diced parsley, and a sprinkle of Parmesean cheese.
