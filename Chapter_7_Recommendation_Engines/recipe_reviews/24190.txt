This is delicious and very easy. I use a creamy peppercorn ranch dressing and red onion and it is very tasty!  I serve it with assorted veggies and there is never any left over!  I have made it the day before serving without problems.

Tasty! The creamy salad dressing I used was Ken's Light Creamy Parmesan. The only modification I made to this recipe was to give all the ingredients a good spin in the food processor before chilling. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Quick, easy recipe.  I made this for an office party and it went quick.  I served it with crackers and veggies.

I made this for my son's birthday party, I was pretty hesitant, but it came out GREAT! There was none left. I crushed crackers over the top, melted a couple tablespoons of butter and poured that over the crushed crackers, and baked at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. Will definately be making again! Thanks for sharing :)

Visually unappealing. Flavor okay.  When I made
this (along with another dip) for a gathering, this was barely touched while the other dip disappeared.  No one requested the recipe.

This recipe is unclear as to what "creamy salad dressing" means. My guess would be that it means Miracle Whip, not the kind of dressing you put on salad! I didn't care for this much though.

I MADE THIS FOR A PARTY AND TOOK ONE TASTE OF IT AND THREW IT OUT. I HAD TO RUN TO THE STORE TO GET SOMETHING TO TAKE TO THE PARTY. I ENDED UP MAKING MEXICAN STYLE DIP ON THIS WEBSITE WHICH WAS GOOD. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE BACON CHEDDAR SPREAD. MAYBE IT WAS THE RANCH DRESSING I USED. I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS AGAIN.

This was very good.  I used one cup of mayonaise instead of the creamy dressing.  I also added more onion, garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder.

This came out pretty good after a little additions. First, after reading the reviews, I went with Honey Dijon dressing (my husband doesn't like ranch). I used 5-6 Tablespoons. Making it sweeter, I added a few drops of Tabasco and , about, 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I made it two days in advance and the flavors blended to make it more sweet and spicy. I will make this again...my way.

Easy appetizer and very delicious.  Once my guests actually tried it (because it doesn't look like anything special) they all devoured it.  It was gone within a few minutes.  I made a few small changes to this:  1) half a cup of light ranch dressing and half a cup of non-fat sour cream; 2) added diced onions instead of grated (which gave it a better, texture); 3) threw in garlic & onion powder, pepper, and sea salt; & 4) used 2-3 extra slices of bacon.  I chilled this overnight and served the next evening w/ celery & cucumber slices.  I will definitely use this again!

This was great!  I made it for a party, and before I could even get any it was gone.  So, I had to make it for home, so I could have some.  I did however add just a few diced tomatoes.  I am a tomato person.  It was excellent.  You could add a little of anything you really liked like mushrooms, or peas.  It is great.

This was great!  I swore as I read reviews I wouldn't be one of those folks who loved a recipe then made  a change but I did.. well just one... I split the 1 cup of creamy dressing into 1/2 cup sour cream and  1/2 cup ranch dressing.

Spread was really good! I didnâ€™t put all of the ranch in and added a little sour cream and omitted the onion. My kids and husband loved it! We used blue tortilla chips and celery for dipping. Would have been great with ritz crackers.

Really good. I used peppercorn ranch dressing. I recommend finely shredded cheese, not the more coarser shred.
