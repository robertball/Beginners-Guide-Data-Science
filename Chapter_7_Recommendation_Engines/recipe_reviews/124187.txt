Delicious - and a great way to use up rotisserie chicken! I used half red grapes and half Granny Smith apple. For the "dressing" I used 3/4 Hellman's light mayo and cut that with 1/4 cup of light sour cream to make things a bit "creamier" and less mayo tasting. The longer this chills, the better it tastes as the flavors really blend together. Fabulous served over lettuce leaves or on croissants!

This recipe was so delicious!  To save some time, I used one of the rotesserie chickens that are sold pre-cooked in the grocery store and cut it up for use in the salad.   I actually forgot the almonds when I was serving this and I didn't miss the crunch or taste because the water chestnuts gave it the crunch I thought it needed.  I served this is wraps with spinach leaves.  What a delicious, easy to make recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe and does taste better if chilled overnight.  I have also added a large can of pineapple chunks, drained.  Served on a large platter with papaya and avocado it makes a nice luncheon entree.

This was a great combination of flavors. I don't know that you really need to make it the night before, but it's nice that you can. It tastes great right away, but the flavors do blend together even more overnight. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Substituted the almonds for toasted walnuts, and the water chestnuts for a golden delicious apple.  And only was able to let it sit for 3-4 hours.  Still turned out delicious, will be making this again soon!

I loved it.  I had a couple of friends and thought I would try this recipe and we all enjoyed it.  I gave both of my friends the recipe.

This chicken salad is the best one I've found in years. Three of us scarf it down in one meal. It's addicting! Nice meal for a hot summer evening.
