These turned out very good! I used regular flour and added Panko crumbs because I thought they needed more cohesion. I will definitely make these again.

I haven't made this yet but since I'm a rosemary and chicken freak I'm definitely going to put it on my list!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I made 1/2 a recipe, which was a good amount for 4 people.  I did not have fresh rosemary, so I used dried.  I also used chicken breasts and regular flour.  I used more flour than the recipe called for (1 cup of flour for 1/2 recipe) and it was about perfect.  We dipped the fritters in ketchup, and I served them with a green salad, corn on the cob and fruit.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Used ground turkey; omitted carrot and garlic; increased onion (used red) and added chopped jalape√±os.  DELICIOUS!

Delicious. I did grind all of the ingredients up pretty finely and used coconut flour instead of almond flour. It could use a sauce or dip. I made a dip with mustard, mayonnaise, and dill. I also tried it with catsup. Both were tasty
