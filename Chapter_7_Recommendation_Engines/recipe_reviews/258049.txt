I used sesame oil instead of just regular cooking oil as recommended by another reviewer. I also added mushrooms sprinkled in a little granulated garlic and a dash of ground ginger. We are huge fans of Jasmine rice and when I saw that Uncle Ben's had it available in the microwavable pouches I couldn't resist using it in place of the brown rice. The basic recipe is good and I love that it incorporates a wonderfully colorful array of veggies. It is also easy and quick for a busy week night. I think had it had a little more seasoning in the original recipe and not used the brown rice which is kind of nutty in flavor I would have given this 5 stars. Definitely will make this again! Fun to explore all the options.

8-31-2018 The first time I tried fish sauce at home it stunk so bad I thought surely it must be spoiled so I threw it out. I tried it again this time with a fresh bottle. It stunk too so it became apparent that this is how the stuff is meant to be. I tried not to be influenced by the way it smelled when I tasted the finished dish. I got past the offensive smell ok but was still unimpressed so I vowed never to try it again until I read an article about what ingredients professional chefs could not do without and one said Red Boat Fish Sauce. I then was on a mission to find this and to give fish sauce another try. This coupled with a conversation I had with a Vietnamese friend made me look forward to it. (She also confirmed for me something else I learned that Three Crabs Fish Sauce was also considered among the best and this is what she uses. She also said that when they use fish sauce as a dipping sauce they dilute it with water sweeten it with sugar and add a little fresh lemon juice all of which get rid of the fish stink) I wanted a simple recipe so I tried this one. I thought it was ok. Hubs surprisingly liked it better than I did. He liked the combination of ingredients (I added sliced mushrooms and garlic) but he did add that he found it a tad bland. I did not use the ready brown rice called for choosing white rice instead. Most important I liked it well enough that I have now purchased three cookbooks on Vietnamese cooking!

This is quite delicious. I've made it a few times. Each time I've had to use miso instead of fish sauce due to allergies. I added some fresh minced ginger and a couple of fresh Thai chilies. It really is easy to put together thanks to the ready rice. It saves the day when you need to get dinner on the table. Leftovers make excellent lunches for the next day because the rice doesn't get mushy. Thank you for the recipe.

I had to improvise a lot on this recipe. Just moved and almost no spices and such. For the veggies used an onion and bag of frozen stir fry veggies didn t have fish oil or brown rice so used jasmine rice anyways the point is you can mix this up with what you have and it turns out great. Thanks for sharing??

I did not have fish sauce sesame seeds or sprouts but we weren't missing them. This was fantastic! Next time I make it I'll make sure to have sprouts just because it would be a great addition.

This is a fast and easy meal perfect for those busy nights. I had bought the wrong rice packet but it was still very good. I would add some grated ginger the next time to add a little zip.

Easy weeknight meal! I added in some fresh sliced mushrooms and water chestnuts because I love the texture of them! I did double the sauce as well.

This was an easy meal. Even better two out of my three kids actually ate it! I added an extra chicken breast and slightly increased the water/soy sauce/fish sauce in order to feed five people. Otherwise I made no changes.

This was really good! I left out a few of the veggies because we didn t have them and threw in a pinch of ginger but otherwise followed the recipe. Husband and I both loved it and will make it again.

So simple and delicious. I also added fresh ginger because that makes a stir fry. I always say make it your own.

I did not have bean sprouts and used sliced mushrooms instead. I also used a bit of crystallized ginger and did not use the fish spice. I used Long Grain and wild rice. All very good!!

Really fast and great meal. As others suggested I added garlic and ginger at the beginning. And I had a bottle of Soyaki from Trader Joe s so I used that instead of the fish sauce soy and water. And served it with cauliflower rice. Delicious.

The recipe lived up to it's ease but it needed some more flavor. If I was to do it again I'd add garlic. The green onions helped a lot as far as crunch. It was quick as stated but we found it needed more salt and pepper.

Awesome! Easy! I only made the meat and veggies we weren t in the mood for rice. Added a bit of garlic paste and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Had a few slices of pineapple on hand and diced them up then tossed them in. We will be having this again!

Excellent dish. I made it with thigh meat instead of breast and substituted coconut amino for the soy sauce. So good and it is quick and easy especially with Trader Joe's frozen pre-cooked rice.

We loved this! Although I made the recipe without the fish sauce... after reading the reviews I couldn t bring myself to use it. I substituted more soy sauce instead.

6.15.17 We are not fans of brown rice so I did substitute Uncle Ben s Original Converted Brand Rice doubled the sauce and sliced the peppers rather than chopping for nicer presentation. The only thing that I would do differently in the future is add some cornstarch to the sauce as I would have liked that thickened a bit. Flavor is good and with early prep work this is a go-to recipe for a quick weeknight meal.

I made a few tweaks to the recipe; primarily adding in peanuts for a good crunch and an extra boost of protein. Overall a great quick easy dinner option!

This was yummy and couldn't be easier to make. I did make a few good modifications based on my taste preferences: I substituted sesame oil for the oil I added garlic powder and ground ginger.

Bland! The ingredients list above do not produce a flavorful dish. I just read through the comments above and realized others added garlic and ginger and other flavorings. This is NOT a keeper for us.

Delicious and easy to make we really enjoyed this dish. Everything was spot on for me but others would have like the veggies cooked a little more so I might throw them into the pan 2- 3 minutes before adding the chicken next time around then cook as instructed. We will be making this one again for sure!
