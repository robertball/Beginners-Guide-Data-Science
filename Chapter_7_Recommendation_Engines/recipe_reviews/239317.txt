I did not have challah bread, I used whole wheat bread instead. I also did not have raspberry liqueur, I just omitted it and increased the vanilla extract. I cooked this on my non-stick griddle. This was good but quite sweet--the kids especially liked this, they each ate two sandwiches. The sugar in the egg wash was unnecessary, in my opinion. I would make this again but omit the sugar in the egg wash.

2.7.17  I didn't have challah bread but did use some really good quality homestyle bread from the bakery.  I really couldn't taste the raspberry liqueur, and if I were to make this again, think I'd just use raspberry extract.  It was good, but I'm a PBJ gal, so I knew this one was a sure thing!  >>>>   Tried a new flavor combo today.  Used strawberry jam, skipped the liqueur and substituted a small amount of coconut extract.  Garnished with a sprinkle of confectioners sugar and some fresh strawberries for a tasty breakfast.

I used wheat bread, Truvia instead of sugar, blackberry jam and I skipped the liqueur. I think it's something kids would like. As for me, I don't think I will be craving this anytime soon.

Seriously, why have I never made this before? I really liked it.  I made a few changes, but the idea is just great. I didn't have any liqueur; I used wheat bread; I used 1/4 of the sugar called for, and won't put any next time; and I used crunchy peanut butter. The peanut butter and jelly is all melted between the French Toast--so yummy! No syrup needed, but I did sprinkle on some powdered sugar.
