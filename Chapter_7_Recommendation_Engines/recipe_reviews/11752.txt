WARNING:  DO NOT USE LOW FAT MAYONNAISE.  I made it the first time with regular mayonnaise and it turned out to be the hit of the party!  I couldn't find fresh basil so I even used dried.  Then I decided to make it with low fat mayonnaise and it turned out horrible.  Great recipe...

Excellent.  This is really a full 5 star recipe.... easy, pretty, and yummy.  I followed the recipe, except I used white wine vinegar (since I was out of red).  I'm perplexed as to why some reviewers thought there was too much mayo.  I hate too much salad dressing (always order it on the side!), but this only had a light coating.  I'm wondering whether those people didn't use enough pasta. It calls for 2 cups of DRY pasta, which is actually an entire box, I believe (the box I used had 16 oz dry rotelle).  Anyway, it's the best pasta salad I've ever had!

I made this salad for a baby shower I recently had and received great reviews for it. I used bow-tie pasta and added in blanched broccoli florets, seedless cucumbers, red, yellow, and green peppers as well as fresh Roma tomatoes. For the dressing, I used 1 cup of mayonnaise but added in about 3/4-1 cup of prepared zesty Italian dressing, along with the suggested ingredients. I too was afraid of the large amount of mayonnaise. Regardless, everything tasted great and it got better each day it was left-over. I would make it again because it was pretty looking.

Great pasta salad - perfect for any BBQ! Pasta salads are so easy and no matter what you add to them as long as the veggies are fresh, you use a good quality dressing, and it's chilled - it'll be wonderful. So add what you like. This recipe is a great base. I used a whole bunch of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and added some red and green pepper along with the rest of the ingredients. For the "dressing" I added a little dried Italian seasoning. I also topped it with some shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - delicious!

for all of the millions of pasta salad recipes out there, this is not one of the best. it contains a disgusting amount of mayonnaise, and tastes pretty boring and kind of gross. the best thing about it was all the pretty colors - i won't make this again.

A little variation: Add red, orange and yellow bell pepper, diced; a can of drained pineapple chunks OR a cup of small seedless red grapes, halved. This adds a little sweet touch to the savory and despite how odd it sounds, is very good. 

Black olives, sliced green olives with pimentos, diced sauteed or fresh zucchini or yellow squash... This is a versatile, easy and festive side dish for a large gathering.

This was a great recipe!!  I cooked it last night for the first time, and my best friend's husband who normally doesn't like pasta salads loved it!! I added cubes of Mozzeralla cheese to it, and my friend suggested adding boiled eggs next time as well.  I used dried basil and garlic and it was still wonderful:)

My daughter has declared this her new favorite pasta!! She ate two small bowls of it asking me to make it again tomorrow. I did half miracle whip, half mayo, since I had no olives or fresh tomatoes, I added some chopped celery, green bell pepper and a jar of diced pimentos.  Great pasta salad or as my 6yr old daughter said "mom, this is exquisite" (where does she learn her vocab?). Yes, I'll be making this recipe again!

Pretty good salad...and everyone who tried this seemed to enjoy it.  I'm not big on fresh basil so I could have done without it but the mayo/vinegar dressing was good. This did not have a lot of flavors in it. I used an orange bell pepper and added about 1/2 a jar of diced pimentos.  I think the taste of the bell pepper dominated this dish. Hubby's not a pasta salad fan and my little ones didn't even try it.  Probably won't make again unless the leftovers are to die for.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make, however, I would cut the salt to 1/2teaspoon or omit it.

Great recipe. I made it for 40 people at my daughter's birthday party and got lots of requests for the recipe.  I added a tad more garlic than the recipe called for.  Bad breath but great taste!

I have been making this salad for several years now I can't believe that I have not done a review on it.  This salad is wonderful.  Great for picnics and potlucks.  I know that the dressing sounds like a lot, but don't cut back on it.  This salad really does need to sit in the fridge overnight before it is served.  The pasta absorbs a lot of the dressing and the flavors really marry when the salad is prepared and well chilled ahead of time.  Use whatever vegies you have on hand.  Seeded Roma tomatoes are great in the salad and they hold up well.  I usually double the amount of fresh basil the recipe calls for.  Always get absolute rave reviews whenever I make this salad.

Sorry, but amazed how many great reviews this has received.   To us it is a very ordinary and commercial buffet type salad -  again sorry for the rating, but it just does not have anything that stands out - the only saver is the fresh basil.

This is truly a great recipe but I had to give it 4 stars because after seeing the recipe photos I knew there was WAY to much mayo for me so I cut it in half.  Except for this, which I suppose is a matter of personal preference, this was a real prize winner to me.  My wife hates vinegar and said she wouldn't eat this salad before I made it.  I made a double recipe to feed family coming over the next day and had to make more because my wife ate a bunch of it before it even had a chance to get in the fridge and said "you better make more of that or people are going to be disappointed".... yes, it was that good.  :)

Really good basic recipe! Couldn't give it the full 5 stars though; I followed everything the recipe said, and it just didn't taste right... So I added more minced garlic, about a tbsp of garlic salt, more pepper and sea salt, as well as about 3 tbsp of dried Italian seasoning. Then I mixed in about 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan. Amazing!

This pasta salad was excellent. I followed the base of the recipe but used carrots and celery instead of tomatoes and olives. The garlic is such a great addition to this pasta salad. Even though it is raw, it is not overpowering and adds just the right amount of garlicy flavor. I made this for a cookout and got rave reviews from guests. Even a very picky eater (who never eats pasta salad) ate and enjoyed it. My husband took leftovers for lunch the next day and got many comments about how good it looked and smelled. I will definately be making this again and again!

My family loved this recipe.  I changed it a little.  I used 1 small cucumber diced, green pepper, 3 stalks of celery diced, and 1 can of kidney beans rinsed and drained. I also used tarragon vinegar. Before serving I sprinkled shredded cheddar on it. I did not have fresh basil so I used dried. 2 tablespoons. It was a hit.  Next I am going to leave out beans and add a can of tuna.

Super tasty and very easy - definitely a great dish to make ahead of time as it gets tastier after a day of letting the flavors mix.

I liked it and brought it to a NYE party. Unfortunately, there was plenty left over and in the trash it went. I dont know why people didnt like it more. I did use 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup zesty Italian dressing, and the next morning had to use more as it was dry. Keep searching for the perfect pasta salad.

I doubled everything except the mayo and it was perfect.

Brought to a bridal shower, and got so many compliments. I've made it a few times since then, everyone loves it!

An amazing pasta salad! I still have leftovers from a get-together (because there was a LOT of food)... but it is great and I will definitely share the leftovers. I'll make this again, though I may cut back just a teensie bit on the mayo. AMAZING recipe.

A word to those using light dressing do not add the vinegar.
Those using origin mayo try adding sweet pickle juice instead of the vinegar for fresh new zesty taste.

My husband's favorite.  I love this recipe..I add additional black olives and chicken, because the husband likes a heartier lunch.  Some say there is too much mayo, but I find that it soaks in by the 2nd day.  This couldn't be better.

I liked the recipe, adding a few of my own things in order to make the required vegetable additions.  The only thing negative I can say is watch out for the red wine vinegar.  Mine was a little salty and I had to add some sugar to the salad to make up for it.

This rating is based on my changes.  First off, I used a 12oz pkg of rotini (4 cups dried).  The recipe as is, would be way too creamy if used only 2 cups of dried pasta.  Other changes, used dried basil (forgot to buy fresh), omitted olives, omitted yellow pepper, used a combo of red and green ones, added in strips of salami, and diced fresh mozzarrella.  I would use this again as a base recipe.

This is easy and very tasty. I left out the tomatoes and added diced cucumber and zuccini. I also added fresh cilantro, and I cut the mayo by 1/3 with plain, non-fat yogurt.

Everything was going fine UNTIL .... I added the amount of salt called for.  It was ruined and I had to start over.  In all fairness, if you don't add that much salt (maybe a pinch or so,) you might be okay.

I followed the recipe exactly. I was not a fan of this recipes. I guess it's taste preference but I didn't like the mayo dressing on this and I usually love mayo on food. I will be looking for an Italian dressing type past salad recipe.

This is a great recipe for a mayonaise based dressing.   I have made this salad many times to rave reviews and as far as veggies I always use what I have on hand.  Today I made it with a can of diced olives, a can of artichoke hearts, tomatoes and a cucumber.  D-lish!

I served this wonderful salad over lettuce for a lite summer dinner.  I used some dried basil since I didn't have fresh and omitted the black olives since my family doesn't care for them.  My husband loved it and my 4 yo had seconds which is rare.  This will be a regular on our table this summer.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I chose to make this for a pot-luck for my husband's work because of the good reviews, and then really liked it and had to make some for myself!  I did like some other reviewers and only used 3/4 cup light mayo.  I made it once with red bell pepper instead of yellow.  The dressing is very good and will go well with whatever veggies you might want to use.

Very tasty and versatile recipe.  It does dry a bit when you store it overnight, but that is typical of pasta salads and is easily remedied by adding a dab of mayo to perk it up. I make this all the time because it's so easy and flavorful. One time I didn't have basil on hand and instead subbed dried dill -- worked great and was delicious.

This was delicious and I'm not a big pasta salad fan.  I would make it a day in advance to get the full flavor.  I made some changes based on our tastes - added feta, red onion, sundried tomaotes and cayenne pepper.  Omited olives.  I used a whole box of rotini, I think it's 10oz.  I had to add a bit more vinegar and garlic.  Even though I made a few substitutions, the base of the recipe was the same.  I will make this again.  This is a good make-ahead recipe to bring to a party.

I've made this twice. The first time was made with Miricle Whip and was way to sweet, but it was all I had at the time. Second time I made it I used plain mayo and I got so many compliments at the Baby Shower that I took it to. Plus my husband wanted me to save him some which says a lot because he does most of the cooking around here. ALWAYS USE MAYO!

This recipes was quite tasty for a nice summer dish. I actually used 1/2 regular mayonaise and 1/2 light mayonaise and it tasted great. I also forgot to buy the olives so I substituted 1/2 cup chopped onion. The second time I made it (still no olives in the house) I also added a dash of cayenne pepper which I think complemented the spiciness of the raw garlic. I will be making this again and again...

I used cheese tortellini instead of rotini and it turned out great. The dressing has a nice flavor to it and using fresh garden tomatoes in it is a real treat. Thanks!

This recipe is worth trying just for the dressing.  I was skeptical, but it really is quite good.  I prefer more veggies and fresh herbs, but the basic sauce here is perfect for adjusting to your own tastes.

changed a couple of things because thats all I had.Green olives instead of black,white wine vinegar instead of red.I also deleted the salt completely.The 6 year old wanted it in her school lunch the next day!Everyone loved it.I doubled the recipe and the leftovers were gone the next day.An impressive salad for guests at a BBQ that is super fast to prepare.

Nothing to rave about--This salad DID have too much mayo for my liking. I ended up adding Italian dressing to get a little less pasty taste. I will definitely be trying a different recipe next time.

I needed to bring a dish to a potluck and couldn't think of anything to make.  This was perfect and delicious (almost didn't want to share!)  I read the comments about too much mayo, and when I first mixed it together agreed; however, when you chill it, the pasta absorbs a lot.  I used Calamata Greek olives and I think the next time I make it will add pepperoni as well.  Yummy!  I also used dried basil (just halved the amount)

This was very good.  However, I didn't have the problem with too much dressing, it was a bit dry.  We thought it could use a touch more of the red wine vinegar.  But will most definitely make it again.

For Gluten-Free substitution: do not use quinoa pasta for cold salads... it cools very brittle. I made a pasta salad with it once and it was like eating seashells. I'm not gluten free but my mom is. Maybe rice pasta or rice noodles would work better in this case? This was a great pasta salad recipe!

Really good!  I kept the dressing ingredients the same.  My fresh basil was gone, so I used dry, which was still very good.  Added cucumber, brocolli, cubed mozarella, cubed pepper salami, all in equal amounts....about 1/2 -2/3 cup.  I used light mayo without any complications, so I'm not sure what happened to other reviewers who ended up with a runny sauce.....not enough rotini maybe?

At first I sort of doubted this was going to be that great. I decided to make this anyway for a Mother's day gathering. Made it the night before, this salad ended up being SO tasty that we all kepts eating it and I even took it to work as lunch for 2 days straight. A large batch was gone in no time.    Adjust the tastes to your liking when it comes to salt and herbs - either way this recipe was great!

Love this pasta salad.  First time I made it I found there to be too much dressing for the amount of pasta listed in the recipe.  Now I just make make a bit more pasta to even out the pasta to dressing ratio.

This is the best, most versatile pasta salad recipe I've tasted. You can add salmon, shrimp, ham, or other meat to it, add celery, jalapenas or serranos, or other veggies. It just gets better the longer it ages.

Don't use less than one box of pasta.  Any kind works well.  Optional additions: celery, salami, onion.  I made so much of this pasta and my guests ate it all, neglecting other food items.  Big hit!  Easy too!

I am not a huge pasta salad fan.  I was looking for a recipe for my nephew that was basic, but good... you know how picky kids are.  It turns out that I LOVED this recipe.  In fact everyone at the picnic did.  It was a sensation and my picky nephew who barely eats, had four servings.

I don't think you can give a recipe a 5-star rating when you've changed it substantially. I made this salad exactly as the recipe stated and found it not worthy of serving as is, hence my honest 2-star opinion. The garlic and basil were completely overpowered by the flavor of the mayo (used Hellman's- not some off brand). I used a 16 ozs of noodles, I'm sure that's more than two cups dry so I don't think that was the problem either. It took a lot of tweaking to get this to taste just ok. After two hours of playing with it I ended up with something that tasted more like macaroni salad than I had hoped for but at least didn't taste so strongly of mayo. I think half of the mayo should have been replaced with sour cream or yogurt but it was too late for me to do this at the point I realized the problem.

Very good salad. In addition to the yellow pepper, I added 1/2 cup each of green and red pepper as well. It was a hit at my daughter's birthday party, everyone loved it!

Easy and delicious, what more could you want? I found this to be really good as a light lunch, or double the amount to take to a luncheon, family gathering, etc. Recommended it to friends, and it remains to be tested and true.

I really enjoyed this recipe with a few modifications.  I did add another cup of pasta because it was much too "saucy."  I also used 2 tsp. dried basil and an extra clove of garlic.  I could have eaten the entire bowl alone!

It was good but reduce the mayo to 1/4 cup and salt to 1 tsp.  Added 1/2 cup peas and some chopped ham and 1 red onion.  Also used canned diced tomatoes to save time.  turned out great.

I prepared this pasta salad for a 4th of July party. It didn't go over all that well. Perhaps there was too much mayo. I would make this again but substitute the mayo dressing for an Italian dressing. The mayo hides all the colorful pasta. Sprinkling shredded cheddar cheese on top would've been a nice touch.

This is excellent, our new favorite! Made it for a 4th party and everyone asked me for the recipe. I made 2 days in advance and the flavors were wonderful. I used a full 16oz. of dry colored rotini, doubled the garlic, added ½ cup green peppers and ½ cup frzn peas (thawed), and then sprinkled with shredded sharp cheddar before serving. All I have to say is yummy and thank you!

This is delicous but the amount of mayo is enough for a 16 oz box of pasta. I added pepperoni and fresh mozerella. Make sure you use fresh basil. You can grow it in the summer in a pot anywhere in the USA and/or get it at almost any grocery store.

I really liked the flavor of the red wine vinegar and the basil.  I made the recipe as it was and found like many of you that it was way too much mayonnaise.  I will make it again however the next time I do I will add more pasta at least another cup to see how it goes.  I also found that there wasn't enough pasta salad to feed a family of four.  I would double the entire recipe.

This salad was MUCH better the 2nd and 3rd day.  I made a huge amount and served it the same day, I should of made it at least 1 or 2 days before (as recipe suggested)--the flavor was much better.  I loved the amount of mayo dressing on the noodles (not too much) I did double the amount of noodles as many suggested.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper too.  I will make this again, a nice summer pasta salad.  Next time I'll try adding different veggies.

This is the very BEST pasta salad I have ever tasted.  I have been making this recipe for over a year.  I double the recipe and bring it to every single BBQ that I am invited to and I ALWAYS get tons of complements.  You don’t need to change a thing.  I did make it with fat free mayo one time and that was gross.  I have also made it with half fat free mayo and half normal and that was pretty good.

This is just what I was looking for!  I didn't have tomatoes so I put what I had--pimentos and artichoke hearts.  It was a hit at my work BBQ.

This was great.  I also add some kind of meat, Italian dressing, and cheese.  It is a really good base for pasta salad.  Great flavor.

I used 3 cups dry pasta instead of 2 and it turned out perfect. We loved the dressing and it wasn't too much mayo (like others said) probably because of the extra cup of pasta. I also added more vegetables: green and red peppers, cucumber, celery and a bit of red onion. I will definitely make this salad again and again.

Way too much mayo the way it's written. I did a double batch, only used 3/4 of the mayo and still had to add more cooked pasta (I added 2 more cups dry for a total of 6 cups dry pasta to 1.5 cups mayo) because it was way to much mayo. Turned out really good AFTER the extra pasta and reduced mayo.

Great base recipe to experiment with!!

I changed it up a little based on other people's recommendations. I used the whole cup of mayo, but added a few squirts of zesty Italian dressing, fresh chopped oregano instead of basil, and stirred in some grated Parmesan.  I used Roma tomatoes, yellow bell pepper, and cucumbers for the veggies, then some chopped up salami. Delicious!!

Thank you again :)

Not really a fan of this one. It did not keep well and I followed the instructions to a tee. As you can see from the other ratings, I usually agree with the rest. Not on this one.

This was delightful...we couldn't wait to refrigerate to eat it. I cut out the salt and put in less mayo and it was fine fresh but after refrigeration, the salad needed both to perk it up. Recommend

We really enjoyed this for a change from the usual pasta salad. I did have to make one change due to what I had on hand...I didn't have any yellow peppers, so I used cucumber instead, but that was my only change. This was nice and creamy and had a good flavor. I would make this anytime I wanted something a little different form the norm. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was really good.  I scaled it to 9 and made it as written except that I only used 1 clove garlic (plenty for me) and I used 3/4t. dried basil.  I made it in the morning and served it that evening and it had great flavor.

Great recipe, thanks for posting!    This slight modification worked great too, working with what we had around the apt:    Same recipe   - no tomato   - no yellow bell pepper   - 1 cup chopped green bell pepper   - 1 cup chopped red bell pepper   - and 1 chopped avocado

I followed the recipe pretty much to the T but added some celery and cut back the mayo just a bit.  I also added some onion powder and black pepper.  I thought it was very good, but my husband said the mayo could have been cut back even more!  I will probably make again, but alter the recipe just a bit.

Easy to make. I added more veggies including a zucchini and carrots. I had way more veggies than the recipe called for, but it kept it from being too full of mayo. After trying it the next day, I am really glad I added a ton of veggies. If I made this again I would reduce the amount of mayo and increase the red wine vinegar. I would use the same large amount of veggies.

This was wonderful.  Followed the recipe to a"T" using 16 oz box of pasta.  I can see why  just using 2 cups would make it too soupy.  Using the whole box made it just right.  The fresh basil and garlic gave it just a wonderful flavor.  This will be the only pasta salad I will make.

I LOVE this salad.  It is always a hit when I make it.  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh chopped cilantro instead of fresh basil and left out the olives.

I was in charge of bringing refreshments to a class I am attending and this turned out to be a hit.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  I added quite a few things to the salad, but kept the dressing exactly the same.  I used dried basil and added rotisserie chicken, grape tomatoes, chopped broccoli, minced onion, chopped celery and bell pepper. It was very good.

This was AMAZING.  Made a couple changes...  Left out olives and used only 1/2 T. vinegar; Added 2 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. ground white pepper, 1 T. seasoned salt, 1/2 c. finely chopped onion, and 1 cup finely chopped broccoli.  I could have eaten the whole bowl myself!  I did share, however, and everyone loved it.  :-)

This is my new basic pasta salad recipe. I have made it many times, using different veggies depending on what I had on hand. No substitutes for the fresh basil, you can't replace that wonderful flavor! I put in a bit more peppers & a bit less mayo & it is wonderful.

Way to much mayo, taste like vinager and mayo. Cut down on the mayo add chick peas, sundried tomatoes,mint and fresh parsley. Gave it more of a flavor.

Good Pasta, easy to make. Will make again but will try to find something more striking before I do. I feel it had way to much basil in it. But if you like basil you will love this recipe. Thank you for the good recipe.

Very simple but very flavourful. I loved it. You can add any veggie you have in the house to it. I added cucumbers because I had them. I would definitely make this again. It was delicious. Great with my spicy turkey burgers!

Yum! After our pastor's wife made a similar salad for a church luncheon, I decided to investigate recipes using red wine vinegar. This turned out perfectly.  I did add some small slices of pepperoni and Genoa salami, which made it even better. I plan to use this recipe next weekend for a family party.  My 14 year-old picky eater gives it a two thumbs up....so everyone else is bound to love it, too!

This is a great recipe with a few changes - I added a couple tablespoons of Good Seasons dry italian dressing mix to the mayo and a little extra vinegar.  I also added cooked chicken breast (also seasoned w/ italian dressing), and cubed mozzarella cheese. I also upped the amount of pasta ( didn't seem like quite enough) I left out the red pepper (just not in the mood for it) and the garlic (husband not a huge fan of it). Made a really delicious meal - my husband loved it and my 2 and 4 year olds both ate it up too!

I added 2 extra cups of pasta as there was way too much dressing & added about a 1 tbsp of Italian dressing season mix to the mayo mixture.  Took this salad from "bland" to "grand!"

Pretty good! My changes were: 
Didn't have tomatoes, colored peppers or black olives ( I almost always have them, I was bummed). 
Used instead: green pepper, onion,peas and shredded some carrot into it. I also added a couple of TBSP of organic Italian dressing. Bumped up the spice with a little more basil, added onion powder and garlic powder.  VERY good pasta salad.

I made this recipe for my husband's Thanksgiving potluck at work and it was a big hit! I didn't have any peppers so I used red onions instead and also sprinkled it with parmesean cheese. I will definitely make it again.

Very good. I added some bacon and cooked the pepper before putting it in the salad. The dressing was both tangy and creamy. Leftovers were nice the next day.

Good Salad.  It could have had a tad more flavor to get 5 stars.  I will make it again but instead of plain black olives I'm going to use Kalamata.  They're a lot more flavorful.

After making this salad for a reunion over the weekend, I'm a little surprised it got such good reviews. I didn't care for all the basil even after I paired it down a little. My boyfriend, sister, and Mom didn't care for it either.

I really liked this!  I used dried basal leaves b/c I didn't have fresh basil and I didn't use olives b/c I don't like them.

This is wonderful!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I served this as a side dish at a party and what a hit it was! Using low-fat mayo helps to cut back on the fat while keeping the delicious blend of flavors.

Very easy to make.  Use one 16 oz box of rotini pasta.  I thought this salad tasted amazing without sitting overnight in the fridge.  I didn't add the black olives because no one likes them here except me. Mmm...

I personally could have done without the olives - I'm not a huge fan - but, otherwise, I thought this was pretty good. I really liked the salami in it. It was a little dry the next day, so I stirred in some Ranch dressing (was out of mayo). Thanks!

We love this one. Instead of the yellow peppers, I use roasted red pepper and it adds a nice bit of smokey flavor. And always more garlic!

This is really good!  I love the basil flavor.  I used a little more than 2 cups of pasta and reduced the mayo to a little over half a cup, and it was perfect.  I used light mayo and it still tasted good.  I used grape tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes and a whole yellow pepper rather than 1/2 cup, and kalamata olives rather than black.  I also let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours before eating.  Yum!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I made it for the first time tonight with the following modifications: one whole box of rotini instead of 2 cups, forgot the olives, used pearl tomatoes sliced in half from Trader Joe's, and had rep pepper instead of yellow.  Next time I'll remember the olives and add salami.  This is definitely going in my personal recipe book!  Thanks Jeri!

Definitely too much mayonnaise. Cut the mayonnaise in half or add another cup of pasta. Letting it chill overnight, the pasta soaks up some of the mayonnaise, but not enough. I strongly suggest adding more pasta. I do like the taste the basil and garlic gives. Try adding cheese right before serving. Because cheese breaks down so quickly, I wouldn't add it if you're not planning on eating it in one day.

I really liked this recipe and made a few changes to it.  I doubled the amount of pasta, added crumbled feta cheese and instead of black olives, I used Kalamta olives.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The recipe is great.  I doubled the amount of pasta because it seemed like it had too much mayo and it came out fantastic!  I will definitely be bringing this to all the BBQs this summer.

FYI: Yellow and red bell peppers are a totally different flavor from a green or an orange.
Red and yellow are much milder and sweeter;won't overpower this salad!

This recipe was fantastic.  I had to make a pasta salad for a family reunion and this was such a hit!  The portions were not quite large enough for a large picnic, so I doubled the batch.  I also used minced garlic instead of fresh and it was delicious!  I also used kosher salt in place of the regular type - it blends much better.

Simple, very good pasta salad.  The mayo with red wine vinegar dressing is terrific.  I added 1/2 c finely minced red onion for a little more flavor punch, and omitted the black olives in favor of a family member who does not care for them.  Otherwise, by the book!  You can add nearly any finely minced vegetables to this salad, and it would also be quite tasty with diced chicken for a lovely summertime lunch.

I was low on fresh veggies and trying to find something for lunch that I had all the ingredients for, so I only had tomatoes and green olives to toss in. I may cut back on the mayo next time, but it was very good! I can imagine it would be a great addition at a cook out to some grilled or bbq items!

This is my "go to" pasta salad for family gatherings and potlucks. It's literally a hit every time I make it. It's simple and tasty! I've made it so many tines that I know all of the measurements by heart! You cannot go wrong with this delicious pasta salad!

This salad is EXCELLENT! I have made it 3 times already and my family keeps requesting it. I took it to a reunion and had many requests for the recipe. I made it exactly as written---once I used dried basil and the other times fresh. The dressing is perfect for the salad--not too much and it clings nicely to the Rotini without making it messy. The flavor of the dressing is great!! Leftovers---if there are any---keep nicely for the next day!! Thank you to the original poster for sharing this with us!!!

This was an easy pasta salad, one of my coworkers made it for an employee luncheon and I wanted to tried it she gave me the link to the recipe.  I use yellow bell peppers, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and onions.  I added season salt, pepper, garlic powder, crush red peppers and a little bit of sriracha sauce.  I miss all the seasoning in the mayo mixture before adding the pasta and veggies, from reading the recipe I reduce the mayo and did add a little bit of sour cream, then sprinkle some can corn on top.  My husband who's not a big fan of pasta salad loved it, I would make it again for my household and for events.   I did not give it a five star because if I followed the recipe exact it would have been too much mayo and not enough flavor.

This was a wonderful, quick and easy pasta salad.  LOW-Fat mayo is great. 

I used blanched broccoli and tomatoes as my vegetables.  I've made it like this twice, using bowtie pasta (my favourite) and served it on the same day as well as the day after.  Both quite delicious.

Perfect, just as it is.  Maybe too good, easy to over eat this one.  When make again might increase volume of yellow pepper or olives, just to toy with.

Yum!!!  Made this with wheat-free noodles (Ronzoni) and omitted the garlic (due to sensitivities to both).  Added some green onion, diced raw zucchini, and chives.  SO GOOD!!  This will now be my standard side i take to summer gatherings!

I made this pasta salad without modification.  I thought it was a bit too garlicky for me and the black olives were a bit too overpowering.  I will make this recipe again, but with less garlic and probably green olives instead of black.  I thought it was tasty and I would like to make it to suit my taste buds next time.  It does look pretty too!

I added two tablespoons of cold slaw dressing for sweetness and to take the edge off of the olive flavour.  It gave it a bit creamier taste.   I doubt that I will make it again.  My husband was not a fan.

I found this made a little more dressing than I like. Will probably try again but decrease the dressing

I made this according to the recipe, but I added some chopped cilantro, a stalk of celery, and about 1/2 C black beans - all because I had them on hand.  I just made it, and it is already delicious.  After it has time for the flavors to blend, I'm sure it will be even better!  Next time, I will plan to use 1/2 C mayo, and 1/2 C Ranch dressing.

Add pepperoni, add left over corn, add marinated artichoke hearts, add small pieces of mozzarella or sharp cheddar, possibilities are endless. I don't use mayo in my pasta salad, but do add black olives, the peppers, celery and most anything else I have in the fridge....add meat chopped ham for a cool dinner or lunch entree.

chop and DRAIN tomatoes, or use cherry tomatoes. 
I used gently roaster cherry tomatoes and allowed them to cool. Added a full new dimension of  flavor that complimented all of the ingredients.

I used 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 miracle  whip, 1 Tablespoon red wine vinegar, generous shake of garlic  powder, and added generous squirt of Honey mustard dressing.  Very very good with shake of black pepper I added cheese and green olives making this one heck of a good pasta salad.

I am so sorry to say this, but this was not a hit at all at my daughter's b-day party this last Sunday.  No one really liked it as it looked like only one person touched it and she was a vegetarian and said it was very blah.  I tried everything to spice it up and it was not a hit....:(

This is pretty good, but I think it has too much of a tomato taste, and I love tomatoes.  I don't know what some other reviewers were on about too much mayo -- they must have thought 2 cups of cooked rather than dry pasta was called for.  I used dried sweet basil at 1/3 of the fresh that was called for (1/2 tbsp.)

As much as I love mayonnaise (and I really do!), 1 cup of mayo for only two cups of pasta was way too much for me.  I ended up cooking the entire (12 oz.) box of pasta (about 4 1/2 cups uncooked) and just added more veggies to match the ratio. Didn't have fresh basil so I just added 2 tsp. dried basil to the mayo mixture. The flavor of the sauce is fabulous!  Will definitely make this again!

This was my first attempt at pasta salad! My salad turned out pretty good, but 1 tblsp of salt is a bit too much. Would definitely suggest using  half the amount then tasting; add more if necessary. Lots of sauce, would also recommend 1 cup more of dried pasta.

 I ended up using a half cup mayo, and a half cup of low fat whipped dressing. I substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar, dried basil (1tblsp), black garlic (just because I had some) and added a bit of diced red onion and diced dill pickles, and no olives (didn't have any).

I used low-fat olive oil mayo and added a small amount of red onion and minced broccoli florettes. I thought it was really good. I used about 1/4 less mayo than the recipe called for, this was for a full box of rotini pasta.

This is a wonderful salad! I make it for camping and potlucks! The only thing I changed was adding green pepper, using cheese tortellini for the pasta and omitting the salt. I always get requests to make it again!

This is quite tasty and easy to prepare for a large group. You can find better recipes that are a little more fine tuned for smaller groups, but for a large BBQ this will go over well. Seems like too much mayo pre-chilling. After a few hours in the fridge it balances out quite well.  Added chopped golden onion and chopped cucumber to mine and both worked well with this recipe.

I thought  this had great flavor....the only problem I had was that it was too dry.  I used a whole box of healthy for you pasta and think that is why.  I added some italian dressing to it the next day and it was perfect.  I put black olives, cucumber, red and green peppers, some finely chopped purple onion and I cubed some cheese and put in there as well.  I would of put tomatoes but I was out of them.  My family loves pasta salad and would make this again with more of the sauce.

I halved grape tomatoes and used 1/2 cains reg & 1/2 cains light mayonnaise plus whole wheat pasta. It was fantastic. My husband doesn't like tomatoes, so he ended up picking around them and still loved it.

It turned out very good.  I did forget the basil though.  I used it early for lasagna I made.  But this was amazing.  I used low fat mayo and whole wheat noodles.  I also used canned olives but drained the juice.  This tasted fresh I also liked it warm when I stirred the noodles in.  That's just me I wouldn't warm it up afterwards though.

I used scoobi doo noodles for this :).  I used part mayo and part sour cream to make up the 1 cup - i just didn't want to use that much mayo.  some others said it was too much dressing on the pasta - but i was making mine a day in advance and since i find homemade pasta salad tends to absorb the dressing and dry out a bit when left in the fridge overnight, i left the measurements as is and it was perfect for me by the next day.  I left out the olives and basil only as a preference - and I added chives, cucumber, celery and used red pepper instead of yellow because that's what I had.  I think I'd make it again with my own variations.  Oh and i cut the salt in half :)

Delicious and so easy.  Brought to Volleyball tournament and it got many compliments.  I did not have tomatoes or fresh basil so I substituted artichoke hearts and Persian cucumbers.  The recipe easily accommodated the changes.  Will make this again and again!

This recipe is fabulous!  I'm a huge fan of fresh basil, and this recipe hits that mark!  Everyone who tried it loved it.  Rainbow rotini, with its subtle vegetable flavors and rainbow of colors, really makes this a standout side salad.  I always enjoy finding a recipe that has a fantastic base, but that is flexible enough to add my own twist.  You could add any of your own favorite fresh vegetables and this would still be amazing.  I found I only needed about 3/4 of the dressing, but it was so delish that I saved the rest in the fridge and am going to try it on a green leaf salad.  Thanks Jeri for a wonderful recipe!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I think this is a great recipe. I love the basil element, so I added more than the recipe called for. I'm not a big fan of fresh garlic, so I just added some garlic powder. I think this will be my new stand-by for pasta salads!

This is very good.  1c mayo is pretty standard for pasta salad...I didn't think it was too much at all.  I used a green pepper and approx 1 T dried basil because that's what I had.  I think maybe adding some bacon would put this over the top for me.  It is very similar to the bacon ranch pasta salad from this site that my family loves, but I like the flavor of the the garlic/basil over the ranch.  Now to convince the rest of the family...

I did not have the rotini pasta, so I used regular whole wheat elbows. That was the only adjustment. I doubted the red wine vinegar but it tasted very good. The family loved it!!!

Excellent recipe. Used with rotini pasta and tortellini. Added salami for an extra kick, but otherwise made just as stated. It is a big hit every time!

I made this pasta salad this past weekend for a birthday party and it was delicious.  The whole family couldn't get enough of it.  The basil and tomatoes fresh from the garden were wonderful in this recipe.  I halved the recipe by cooking 8 ounces of pasta and halving the dressing.  Next time I might add a little Parmesan cheese, not that it was needed just for and added flavor element.

OUTTA THIS WORLD DELICIOUS DRESSING!  I was concerned about the red wine vinegar because I'd never cooked with it before but the ingredients combined to create a wonderfully creamy, interesting dressing.  I did have to improvise with the veggies--used a whole red pepper instead of 1/2 a yellow and used two medium fresh tomatoes.  Also I added two cloves of garlic rather than one, simply because we love garlic here.  Oh, and I used dried basil as my plans for a herb garden never came to light, ha ha.  This salad is chilling right now so I can't give any reviews from my diners yet but I anticipate GREAT comments and will be sure to post them here later!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this salad. I pretty much followed the recipe. I used leftover penne pasta and didn't have any olives to add and it was still vary good. I love the tasts of the fresh basil. I planted an herb garden this summer and have been looking for recipes to use them in and this was great. I used my first 2 ripe tomatoes also. Wonderful, definately a keeper!

I really like this recipe. Followed it very closely, including the fresh basil. I did add sliced green olives and small cubes of mozzarella cheese. It was important to put this salad together well in advance so that the flavors could properly blend, and also to give the pasta a chance to absorb the dressing.  I found that I needed to add a bit more just before serving.  Even my husband, who is a self-proclaimed 'meat and potatoes guy' had seconds of this.  That's a home run!

Loved this pasta salad!  It's so easy and fully of great flavors.  I did substitute white wine vinegar for the red because I out.  I also used dried basil instead of the fresh.  I used a full 16 oz package of pasta and didn't find the dressing to be too much or to have too much of a mayo taste to it.  Will definitely be making again and trying different variations, such as adding cheese or other veggies!

This was a great pasta salad.  You can add a thousand different things to this one and I am sure it would always turn out good I added green onion, cubed cheese, fresh steamed green beans, chick peas and a little italian dressing.  Beautiful and delicious!

excellent recipe, super easy and yummy.   It is pretty mayonaisey as others have said and yes, I measured my 2 cups of pasta before I cooked it!  However, if you let it sit just a few hours, it's just right. The vinegar and fresh veggies make this special.  I substituted about 1 teaspoon of dried basil for the fresh and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of Trader Joe's dried oregano.  Will keep this recipe for future potlucks, bbq's, etc.  Thanks :) I made this again and doubled all the veggies and used green scallions in place of the basil.  OMG, way better than substituting dried basil for fresh.  Everyone loved it!

We really enjoyed this.  Made as written, except used Balsamic Vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  A warning to those who do this- it still tastes great, but gives the dressing a gray/brown hue, which isn't very attractive.  But even my picky kids ate it so you know it was good!

This is the best pasta salad I've ever had!!! I quadrupled the recipe for a church potluck and was so glad there was some left over... I've been eating it all day long! I don't like basil so I left it out, and I highly recommend using those tiny sweet tomatoes (cherub or santa sweets) as well as a mixture of yellow and orange bell peppers.  I will be making this again soon!

This was delicious! I didn't have any red wine vinegar and so I substituted it with Balsamic. I've made it both ways now and I enjoyed the Balsamic one more but both were delicious. My Mom who doesn't like Pasta Salad enjoyed this very much and now she makes it for BBQ's all the time.

Every single time I make this, I get requests for the recipe. I love it because it takes a second to make and there is no meat involved. So there is no defrosting and cooking, chopping etc.

If you prefer a more Italian dressing-based pasta salad, this may not be for you.  I really enjoyed it, but my family prefers a less creamy pasta salad, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.

Great base recipe...although I made several alterations. I cut the mayo down to about 1/8 cup, as we're not huge fans of anything overly creamy. I also soaked raw, red onions in a 1/4 cup of sherry vinegar, which was added to the pasta mixture, along with blanched asparagus & broccoli, goat cheese, pan fried prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, and olives.  Wonderful!

As written there is way too much mayo.  I was hoping by the next day it would get soaked up a little into the pasta but that was not the case.  If I would make again, the mayo would get cut down by a lot.

This was really good - my family liked it a lot. Although, I thought it needed a bit more dressing - it soaks in quite a bit over time and becomes somewhat dry. I also added a pinch of sugar to it. Other than that, it's a great salad - so fresh tasting. Perfect summer dish.

This recipe calls for A LOT of mayonnaise. I made about 4 cups of rotini and made the dressing with 3/4 of a cup of mayo and it was overload. I added in tons of fresh veggies and boiled some more pasta (probably around 1-2 cups). I found it to be a nice twist to a traditional macaroni salad with a bit of adjusting.

This is a delicious pasta salad. The ingredients go so well together. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have olives. Really nice flavor and keeps well- great for making for lunch throughout the week. I used an entire box of pasta and there definitely wasn't too much mayo.

This was great---everyone loved it! I used a little italian dressing instead of the red wine vinegar, and I also added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pesto and dumped in some mini spinach tortellini.  It was amazing the next day and even better on day 3.  Thanks!

Really good, however I started experimenting right off the bat. 
I used 4 cups of rotini instead of 2, and I left out the tomatoes, the bell peppers, the basil and the black olives simply because I didn't have any of those ingredients. I also added diced chicken breast to this, and the end result was fantastic.
I will try the original recipe...eventually.

WOW. Absolutely delicious simple dressing! I used this as a pasta salad guideline, because it had such good reviews; I used black beans, bacon, and olives with the simple mayonnaine dressing and it is out of this world. Can't wait to bring it to Mother's Day!

Wow, this makes a lot! I made it for a group of 60 and it was the only pasta salad and had just a little left over. I was concerned about it being bland, so I added extra spices (oregano, parsley, chili powder, garlic poweder, italian seasoning blend) and a couple tbs of italian dressing. I sauteed the pepper for a couple of minutes and added mushrooms. I also cubed up some mozzarella, since everything's better with cheese!

Like other reviewers, I also found this pretty bland.  Perhaps that was because I only used about half the dressing, Using all the dressing it would have been way too "goopy" for me.  I tried adding a lot of other ingredients to pump up the flavor...more basil, a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper, a little bit of my homemade balsalmic vinegar...After much tweaking, I finally acheived something that was okay, but not great.

I thought I made this a long time ago and loved it. Maybe I did something wrong, not sure.  Didn't have much taste at all.

This was delicious! I made this for a Christmas dinner party that my college girlfriend threw for 5 of us other girls. We each had to bring in something, so I decided to make this. I didn't change or alter the recipe (excet for the serving size) and it came out perfect! It had a lot of flavor and the combination of mayo/vinegar made it even more enjoyable to eat. Everyone loved it and I plan on making it for Christmas for my family. Highly recommended.

I thought this recipe was a great base pasta salad with room to create a little extra! I added a 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder along with a 1/2 tsp curry powder and mixed with a whole box of rotini. I also added shredded carrots, sliced olives. I believe I could have still added more pasta to the mixture and it would have had plenty mayonnaise.....or cut some of the mayonnaise out for a smaller portion. I did not add the bell pepper or fresh garlic because I didn't have one. I recieved compliments on the pasta and was requested the recipe! Thanks, will make again.

The taste was absolutely great, but I thought it was a lot of mayo for a small amount of pasta. I ended up adding another cup (50% more pasta) to the recipe and it came out great and my conscience felt a lot better about all that mayo

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe. The second time, I made changes recommended by other reviewers. Both times, there was little flavor, other than mayo. The salad absorbed the dressing rapidly (by the following day). Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I love this pasta salad - I always take it to parties, and every always asks for the recipe.  The only thing I change is that I add a bit more garlic, and when doubling the batch, do a few taste tests when adding the second tbsp of vinegar.

My family loved this pasta salad.  It was a nice change from the boxed pasta salad that I always buy.  My husband said he doesn't want me to make any other pasta salad than this one.  I did notice that I needed more pasta than the recipe required for the amount of sauce, but I guess it depends on how your family likes their pasta salad.

This is one of the best salads I have come across.  For a large party, I used 2 boxes of rotini, increased the garlic to my taste and added a can of chicken broken up and a bag of Italian Cheeses crumbled that you'd put on a salad.  My son-in-law said that this recipe should be patented that it was so good!!!

We made a huge batch of this salad during our housewarming party and people loved it. The fresh tomatoes give it a great flavor and I followed a few other suggestions to add red & yellow bell peppers. I used a bit less mayo than the recipe called for but loved the garlic in there and gave it a bit extra along with more salt & pepper. Will definitely be making this again - we were eating it for days afterwards too.

It was really good, but after mixing the 1 cup of mayo with the seasonings, I realized there wasnt enough pasta, so I cooked another cup of pasta. I also added half a onion, diced and more bell peppers and tomatoes then what was called for. And instead of the red wine vinegar, I did apple cider vinegar. I also omitted the olives because I hate olives. Also added more black pepper The second time I made it I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained and rinsed because I ran out of fresh tomatoes along with 2 cooked chicken breasts, diced. Add dried blueberries or rasins for a touch of sweetness. Really good! Great salad to bring to a BBQ, which I did!

I LOVE this pasta salad!!! It is so easy to make and everyone raves about the taste. It's good made with all mayo, but if you're running low, sour cream makes a great substitute. Also, 2 tsp. of dried basil serves as an adequate substitute for fresh basil. If you're not a black pepper fan, you may want to cut that ingredient in half. I love it though, so I put it all in. YUM! I'm going to eat some more right now! :-D

This was just OK, although I did use light mayo.  I thought it needed a little zip so I added some mustard powder and I liked it much better after that.

Loved this.  I used the 4-serving recipe.  I reduced mayo to 1/4 cup and added extra garlic (3 cloves total) and 1 tsp of cayenne.  I had orange and yellow peppers so I used some of each.  I served it with a little fresh parmesan as someone else suggested and my husband gave this a 10!  He doesn't give out 10's easily.

Despite hating black olives I made this anyway and just picked them out of my serving. This was way too dry and I had to add ranch dressing. I think that the flavor would have been enhanced if I had added at least half of a dry packet of ranch dressing the night before and then ranch dressing itself the day of serving. Thanks for the post.

This is a good base recipe for pasta salad. I like the vinegar/mayo combo; it's very different. That being said, I think it needed A LOT of tweaking. I added a ton of cayenne (as others have suggested), way more garlic, salt, pepper, and basil (only had dried), lemon juice, chopped onion, and peas. I am debating adding celery before I serve it.
Anyway, worth trying but depending on taste, you will probably need to add to this.

We felt this was very bland.  I may have used too much pasta - I used a 12 oz. box?  Loved the flavor of the dressing so I may try this again with half of the box.

I made this for a picnic, It was good, but far too strong for the amount of pasta amount listed, I would add an extra cup of noodles to make it three. I also added some green onion. Beautiful salad.

So far so good! I made it last night for a family dinner today. I had to scale it to 30!!  Last night when I sampled it it was good and if it's like other pasta salads it will just get better.  I did however add some chopped up zucchini and red onion, and the fresh basil at my grocery store looked terrible so I just sprinkled some dried basil over the top.  So far it's a hit.

Abosutely wonderful!  I had rave reviews when I served it at a wedding dinner.  Would suggest that you qualify the pasta amount as cooked and a great substitute for fresh basil is a heaping tablespoon of pesto.  Thanks so very much, I have added this to my list of "famous for dishes".

This was good when I made some alterations to it.  It was very bland as is.  I added about 2 tbsp. ranch dressing to give it some flavor. I  also think it would be good with some cheese in it.

Funny you hear so many different opinions about pasta salad. Well, this is a real nice, delicious recipe. Of course, add or subtract veggies, but following recipe this one is one to pay attention to.

i wouldn't call it the best, but it is really good. i didn't think it was too much mayo myself, and i used a little more than 2 cups dry pasta, which i also thought was just right. a good recipe overall, and a good recipe to play with.

Excellent pasta salad.  My husband and I loved it.  I reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup but could have gotten by with less.  The kids thought it was too much garlic.  We used shell pasta, because we didn't have rotini, green bell pepper, because we didn't have a yellow one.  I can see how they original recipe would have been very colorful.  We will make this again!

The taste was good, but there was way too much mayonnaise; next time I would eliminate at least 1/3 cup of it. Use kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes, and roasted red peppers to make this a little more upscale.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone went nuts.  As other reviewers suggested, I used real mayo.  Since I was making it for a crowd, I used four pounds of rotini versus the three the recipe called for when I scaled it.  I used halved grape tomatoes and added feta cheese - YUM!  Everyone at the party raved about it.

This was good, but not super great! I think my husband liked it more than I did. It does taste better, the longer it sits in the fridge. The dressing is the right amount of flavor. However, it almost seems like it needs something more. I think it would be good with some sort of cheese added to it! Next time I may experiment with it a bit.

I thought the salad was great.  I cooked one extra cup of pasta so that it wasn't too goopy and added just a bit more vinegar.  Adults loved it kids didn't.

Have made this several times now, last time changed to orange tomatoes (less acid to upset my Mother's stomach) and red peppers and it was just as good.  Low-fat Mayonnaise works just fine.

This salad rocks. Thats all there is to it. I leave out the garlic and black olives and use whatever veggies I have on hand. I also add some oregano, cuz it goes so well with basil. The salad looks good, tastes wonderful is great for bbq's.

this was great, make sure you have it pre-made and in the fridge a long time before test tasting. I played around with it and put in red onions and cheese.

This was way too much mayo. Cut it back and it will probably be much better.

This salad is over the top!  Be sure to use very ripe tomatoes or roma plum!  I used a little more garlic than called for and a little more fresh basil.  Cool and refreshing!!!

This was OK.  I substituted dried basil for the fresh & a red pepper (as that's what I had in the house) for the yellow.  I also used whole wheat spirals as I ordinarily don't buy white pasta.

Very important to CHILL the salad before serving it! I tasted it after I mixed it and thought "Yuck and I have to take it to a potluck dinner." (Too creamy).  But it turned out much better after a 5 hr. chill. This is the first creamy veg. pasta salad I have made and it was good, but I think I'll stick to oil and vineger based pasta salads.

This compliments any summer menu with a nice cool side.  I used bow-tie pasta for my kids(which they call butterfly pasta) so they'd eat it and it's a beautiful and tasty dish.
