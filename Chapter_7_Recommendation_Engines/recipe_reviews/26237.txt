This is the author of the recipe, I have noticed some of you had some problems with the cookies from postings on here. For one I use a little extra flour when I bake them also I always use tinfoil (shiny side down) when I bake them. The cookies are also better when you make bigger cookies, smaller cookies tend to be too hard. Hope that helps!

This cookie got rave reviews from everyone when I actually used extra cocoa powder, which not only made a darker, more chocolatey-appealing cookie than the picture, and it also counter-balanced the sweetness of the sugar.  My cookies didn't turn out flat at all!  They came out big and fluffy, and they stayed chewy all week (they probably would've stayed chewy for longer, but people loved them so much, they didn't last that long).

I thought these were a little too sweet, hubby did not. Still, I would reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup if I was to make these again. I used butter for better flavor, upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup, and used 1 cup each of white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips. They bake up beautifully and perfectly--bakery quality looks. For those having problems with flatness, the solutions are simple--do NOT grease the cookie sheets, and chill your dough about an hour or so to firm it up a litte before dropping it onto the cookie sheets.  Do not add more flour to firm up the dough!  A good recipe, but not "the best" as written.

Oh Oh OHHH!!! This is really the best recipe ever! Okay, I tweaked it a little, here's what I did. I used 1/2 a heaping cup cocoa powder, all butter, added a teaspoon cinnamon, and a smidgen of cayenne pepper. It doesn't add spice persay, just some warmth that goes so nice with the sweetness and the richness of the chocolate. I also substituted 2 c. 60% bittersweet chocolate chips, and 1 c. chopped almonds for the 3. chocolate chips. These came out so crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. I baked them for 10 minutes, they were perfect. I used my Silpat instead of greaing a pan.I have a keeper here. I gave them as a hostess gift at my Bunco group last night. She loved them. I love how there isn't a huge long list of ingred., just simple and well proportioned. I have always had trouble making cookies, but this was foolproof. Enjoy!

Oh so yummy.  Use it with peanut butter chips too.  One suggestion, lower heat 25 degrees and don't grease your pan - just use a non-stick cookie sheet.  The greased pan caused the cookies to spread and get burned lacy edges.

I liked the flavor of this cookie, but I only had butter on hand which didn't help these cookies to retain their shape (which they didn't-they flattened out considerably). I halved the recipe and subbed about a 1/2 c of peanut butter chips for some of the chocolate, which added a nice flavor, but I would totally suggest using margarine and maybe even chilling the dough for a while to help them keep from spreading out into pancakes.

They were very good! My first batch turned out fine. But my second batch burned. Be careful not to leave it in the oven too long or it will be crispy. Take it out once you see cracks on the top of the cookie! If you don't have unsweetened cocoa powder, use regular hot chocolate or cocoa mix. Just use 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar unless you like your cookies extremely sweet!

My family loves this twist on a classic favorite.  I make these all the time.  I do add 1/2 tsp salt and hope that adds some lift.  Very good!

Shannon, your friends are right!  This is a great recipe.  I made these today, and they were an instant best seller.  They're gorgeous!  And they taste good!  Thank you!
*****I want to add, I never use margarine, so we always make these cookies with butter and don't have any problems with it.

Wow I cannot believe some of the reviews I have read - did anyone try the original before modifying?  All the comments about too sweet - they are double chocolate cookies- ummmmm sweet is a given!  It's terrible when people modify before tasting the original.  These were perfect double chocolate decadent cookies - the way they were meant to be.  Everyone who has tasted these from this recipe is thrilled and asks for more!

I followed the suggestions below and made a few of my own minor changes.   1. I used peanut butter M&Ms instead of chocolate chips.  That was a HUGE hit with the kids. 2.  I NEVER use margarine.  BUTTER, BUTTER, BUTTER!!!  The secret is to allow it to SOFTEN.  DONT MELT IT IN THE MICROWAVE!  Then you cream you butter and sugar well.  Add one egg at a time then your batter will be very light anf fluffy.  You cant go wrong here. 3. I always throw in an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  One tsp of vanilla is good. Two is GREAT! 4. I increased the cocoa powdered to 1/2 cup. 5. I added a pinch of cayenne.  ( does that enhance the chocolate flavor!  It does not make it spicy.  My kids dont like anything spicy.) 6. I added a rounded tsp of baking soda.  (My cookies were small but nice and thick (and soft!) 7. I baked my cookies for 9 min.  Then left them on the cookie rack to cool. 8. I put my batter in the fridge for 45 minute (I had to take  a break to make dinner) until it was nice and firm.  Then I kept it in the fridge in while the cookies baked.  I only put the batter on cooled cookie sheets.

I have received many compliments for these cookies. But, remember, if you are cooking these on non-stick cookie sheets, you will need to use the minimum amount of cooking time-- I found that decreasing the cooking time by a minute was good.

These were very good and very simple to make.  They didn't run off the cookie sheet, like some recipes, and boy did my house smell good while they were baking.

Very very chocolatey!  I only had butter so I used all butter.  Then I added 1.5 cups regular chocolate chips, 1cup white chocolate chips, and a cup of mini chocolate chips. I then baked for 10 minutes and the recipe made about 40 cookies.  A keeper!
UPDATE:  I took these into work and within one hour the entire batch of forty was gone!  They were well received.

Fabulous double chocolate cookies! Exactly what I was looking for! I didn't have margarine, so subbed 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. Misread the recipe, and added 1 1/3 cup cocoa instead of 1/3 cup...a mistake with delightful results! Did not grease the cookies sheets. Tried baking three ways: rolled into balls, dropped by Tbsp, and rolled into balls then flattened to 1/2" using a cup bottom dipped in cocoa and sugar. The flattened ones came out the best, didn't spread at all, just baked up soft and chewy, with a cracked sparkly top. Lowered temp to 350* and baked for full 10 minutes. Perfection!

Great tasting cookie Shannon.  I do have to say that I subbed 1 banana w/ a 1/2 tsp. of baking powder (which is an egg sub) for the two eggs, but I only did this because my almost 2 year old is allergic to eggs.  The banana added a nice unique flavor.  The cookies did turned out a little flat, but they served the purpose!  My older 2 kids LOVED all of the chocolate chips which sorta masked the banana.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are wonderful - soft and chewy, easy to prepare.  The expression, "You can't eat just one." definitely applies here.  I agree with the others that 2 cups of chocolate chips is definitely sufficient, 3 would be way too much.  I also did not find it necessary ro roll the dough into balls before baking.  I just dropped them on the cookie sheet and they turned out a very nice thickness.  Just be sure to eat them up fast because the quality definitely declines after day 1.

These were the absolute best!! My teenagers ate them all the first day and asked for more the next. I used chocolate chips and white chocolate in the first batch and only milk chocolate chips in the second batch. Both were great. Be careful not to overbake them though. Take them out of the oven before they look quite done.

Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, couldn't be more delicious! I used butter, (it was all I had) and 1/2 cup of cocoa (because I love chocolate). Cookies held their shape just right. Thanks for a great cookie recipe!

These are yummy! The dough wasn't stiff enough to 'roll' (it was more goopey) so I just spooned tablespoons onto the cookie sheet. I cut the chocolate chips back to 2 cups (which was plenty!) and next time I will cut back a bit on the sugar. Very good cookie though!

Overall, I think this is a pretty good recipe.  I added some extra cocoa because I thought the cookies in the picture looked kind of light and I wanted a really rich, really chocolately cookie.  My first batch of cookies turned out perfectly--soft, rose nicely--but my second batch flattened out and got burnt on the edges, even though they cooked for the same time.  The third batch I did turned out pretty good, but not as good as the first.  This might be due, in part, to the fact that I used butter instead of margarine.  I also added cinnamon and cayenne pepper to make the cookies taste more like homemade hot chocolate.  Tasty cookies, but a bit unpredictable.

Great way to satisfy a chocolate craving!  I substituted 3 cups of chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips, used butter instead of margarine, sucanat instead of sugar, and whole wheat rather than all-purpose flour.  Even with the changes, they turned out beautifully.  I will definitely make these again!

These cookies totally rock!! My whole family love them.. the kids, the hubby and I. I think they really are the best double chocolate cookies ever. I only do a few things differently, I always use whole wheat flour and real butter.. sometimes I use coconut oil instead or butter.. sometimes I use carob chips.. sometimes I reduce the sugar by almost half & add in agave nector or date puree for sweetness... it doesn't make a difference at all, they are excellent no matter what. 

Oh, also, DON'T overbake!! I bake mine only 8 minutes, they look almost undercooked, but after waiting 2 minutes for them to cool on the cookie sheet they are totally perfect, soft & chewy with lightly crunchy edges.

Thanks a ton, this is a family favourite now at our house!!

Fantastic.  Used a little less butter/margarine and compensated with olive oil and they still came out fantastic.  Also less chocolate chips.  But this recipe is fantastic.

These were really good. Made 2 batches. The first batch I made with no changes to the recipe. On the second batch I added Godiva White Chocolate Liquor to the batter. Both versions were delicious.

These are fabulous! After reading reviews I also increased the cocoa to 1/2 a cup which helped the color.  I like my cookies soft, so I added 2 tsp. of cornstarch.  A great recipe and I will definitely make them again!

These cookies really are the best - I make them all the time! This last time, I put in 8 oz. choc chips and 6 oz. butterscotch chips - and WOW! These cookies were gone in a heartbeat.

I just wanted to share a tip for those of you who are saying that your cookies are turning out flat. I always, always, ALWAYS refrigerate the dough overnight (or at minimum for several hours) before baking them. While they're still good and cold, I roll them into balls and then bake them that way. If the dough begins to soften between batches, just pop it in the freezer to keep it chilled well. Hopefully that will help. Chocolate chip cookies are an art. :)

Was looking for very chocolately, fudgy cookie recipe and found this. Am just eating my second cookie! I found exactly what I was looking for!! Turns out this recipe is very close to my standard choc. chip cookie recipe from my mother-in-law, which took me many years to perfect, except that the flour is reduced to accommodate the cocoa powder. I gave this four stars because I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup white, 3/4 cup brown and cookies were still PLENTY sweet - oh and that includes after reducing choc chips to 2 cups and adding 1 cup slivered almonds. Also substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for a cup of the white, and 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup of the marg. Added a couple of shakes of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne (per another readers tip). End result is extremely yummy, dark chocolatey, fudgy cookies.    
As to perfecting my mother-in-laws recipe, I learned that the consistency of the fat (she uses 1 stick butter, 1 stick crisco) is critical. It cannot be too runny or too cool. Works best if left to warm to room temp. She swears by making a single "test" cookie first, and then adding additional flour if needed, but I can never be bothered.

Yummy!!!  I would give these 5 stars but they didn't turn out as good when I followed the recipe exactly.  I slightly changed the recipe to make these cookies better.  First, I used butter rather than margarine.  Next, I added a 6oz box of chocolate instant pudding  with the dry ingredients.  Then I only used 2 cups of chips rather than 3.  I got rave reviews from my family!  Will definitely make these again with my changes.

This recipe was really good, I used it for valentines day but I didn't have a chance to review it. I thought it was so good, it was very easy to make and it was crunchy but not too crunchy. It was the perfect texture and overall look as well, my boyfriend adored them :] I made them into hearts as well. I would definitely make these cookies again.

I made these for a get together with neighbors and everyone wanted the recipe! They are heavenly! After reading other reviews I substituted real butter for margarine, used 1/2 cup cocoa, baked at 350 for 14-15 minutes on an ungreased nonstick baking sheet, and used a little extra vanilla.  This recipe is going in my permanent recipe file!

This was good, but I was disappointed by the flavor.  The cookie dough lacked the deep chocolatey flavor I was looking for. I used white chocolate chips because I like "black and white" cookies.  These cookies also spread a lot and end up thin and crispy. I think I will try the suggestion of using melted baker's choclate instead of cocoa powder.  This is a good recipe if you like crunchy cookies instead of soft/chewy; just not a great recipe.

I don't know if I can fairly give this cookie 5 stars since I changed it up a bit, but what I did was delicious!  I added 1 Tbsp Cherry vodka, 20 chopped up maraschino cherries, and about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and put in about 2 cups of a mixture of semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips (what I had on hand).  The result was amazing.  Other than those additions I made them just like the recipe said and they weren't flat at all.  Good cookie recipe for sure.

These are good just as written. And by the way, cookies are meant to be sweet. I thought this recipe was easy to follow, and the finished product was sweet and delicious! My grandkids just love any chocolate cookie, and this was no exception! Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for Fathers Day. Half to my dad and the other half to my boyfriend. Turned out great. I was worried the batter is very wet. I used a tablespoon to drop them onto the cookie tray. I will make them again

Absolutely the best chocolate cookies I've ever made! I read the reviews and added the extra cocoa on purpose (1 cup)!!! I also loved the idea of flattening the dough with the glass dipped in sugar and cocoa. It makes them a very uniform size and they baked to perfection in 10 minutes in my oven. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you!

These are AMAZING! I changed it just a little. Instead of 3 cups semisweet chips, I used a cup of semisweet mini chocolate chips, a cup of milk chocolate chips and a cup of white chocolate chips. Absolutely the best chocolate cookie I have ever had. My brother who does NOT eat chocolate EVER tried one (after a lot of prompting) and ended up eating 3 in one sitting. Wonderful recipe!

These are very rich and very sweet!  If you find that you eat a half dozen cookies when you bake a batch, this may cure that issue.  I couldn't finish a second one. I used a little extra cocoa powder and about 2 heaping cups of chocolate chips and it was plenty. Next time I make these I will reduce the amount of sugar, probably to 3/4 cup of each brown & white, and maybe try white chocolate chips.  I made big cookies, baked for about 12 minutes, and they had a wonderful soft chewy texture. Good recipe!

Good recipe.  I made all the suggested changes:  1/2 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1 tsp. 1/2 cup of cocoa powder instead of 1/3 cup  Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon  For my recipe I used 1 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of Andes Mints baking chips.  Recipe turned out really well.

These Cookies where great! But I did tweak them a little. Heres what I did, I thought there was a little too much brown sugar so i added 1/2 a cup of powdered sugar, this makes the batter light and fluffy, along with a little more taste . I also added  a little bit of cinnamon after putting the cocoa in because i tasted the heavily of cocoa.Other wise this recipe was great i hope you take my advice!

Not my favorite DCCC recipe.  I bake CC cookies all the time, and for whatever reason these were pretty flat.  They need a bit of tweaking.

Delicious!!  I read reviews and DIDN'T grease the pans, they came off fine.  Also used butter instead of margarine and worked great.  Only 4 stars because I think the proportions are a little off: you only need half that amount of sugar (they were plenty sweet!) and 2 cups chocolate chips.  I also increased the cocoa, and they tasted like brownies.   :-)  Yum Yum!

Excellent cookie!  Just the slightest crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside...perfect!  I used half margarine and half butter, a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa and added a half teaspoon of cinnamon as another reviewer suggested.  Positively delicious!

I think that the original recipe had a few flaws that me and my mom fixed. Flaw #1: Too sweet! We reduced sugar by half. Flaw #2: Not enough cocoa powder. The cookie tastes alot better with more cocoa or it just seems like the standard chocolate chip cookies. Flaw #3: (This one isn't a flaw, just an improvement...) Divide the vanilla by half and add the other halves worth of almond extract. The slight cherry flavor REALLY compliments the extra cocoa. Another is replace the standard chocolate chip with white chocolate. The color is fabulous, and so is the taste.

I started making these at work 2 years ago.  The residents and staff love these.  Recently I put all the ingredients in separate bowls and then had the residents add ingredients as called for.  Very easy recipe to make.  They get eaten very fast.  Oh, I do one bag chocolate chips and one bag peanut butter chips.  They are harmony together.

Okay, I made some mistakes the first time around, but I tried again and I'm here with a five star rating, once I did it right.  Don't grease the cookie sheet, duh, it says that already, but I did it anyway.  Flat cookies!  I used butter as well, which might have contributed to the flatness.  Second time around...ungreased cookie sheet+ 2/3 cup cocoa powder+ chilled the dough= excellent cookies!!!

These cookies tasted great, but they were a little flat. I only used 2 cups of chips, because that was all I had on hand, and I forgot to add the vanilla. I also added chopped walnuts to half the mixture because I love nuts and they were very good.

These cookies came out absolutely delicious!  They were not too chocolately, but perfectly flavored and chewy.  I halved the recipe, used caramel/milk-chocolate swirled chips, added extra cocoa powder and stuck with the margarine (rather than butter flavored crisco, as was recommended by a few reviewers).  They were divine!

These are very tasty!  After reading other reviews, I used a heaping 1/2 cup of cocoa, 1/2 margarine 1/2 Crisco, and baked at 350 on UNgreased cookie sheets.  They came out great and held their shape very well, in fact they hardly spread at all.  I added pecans to the last pan-full and they were even better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cookies were great!  My kids just about tackled me to keep me from taking them to my activity.  After reading the reviews about flat cookies, I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets, cut the temp back to 350 and baked for 10-15 minutes watching for the cracks to appear on top.  I added just a touch more flour (1/4 cup, maybe) and just dropped the dough on the sheets rather than rolling it.  They are a flat cookie but not abnormally so.  They came out square because I put them too close together so I would separate them a bit more next time.  There will definitely be a next time!

These cookies are excellent! I can't wait to finish baking them and take them to work tomorrow. My did not turn out flat. Instead of using margarine in cookie recipes I use Crisco butter sticks. They keep cookies from getting flat and still have the butter taste.

This is one of the best cookie recipes i've ever found. I made it once w/my cousin for her birthday and everyone loved them so much I had to make them for 2 Christmas parties and 4 other occasions already(and i've only had this recipe since the beginning of 12/04). The only thing I did differently was I add only 2 cups instead of 3 chocolate chips. I also tried it using 1/2-3/4cup less flour and they still came out great, people thought it was 2 different recipes b/c the one using the full amount of flour was lighter and thicker. 
And the best part, they stay soft and chewy for days.

I was worried at first because the dough was a bit wetter than I'm used to but the cookies turned out perfectly.  I used both a baking stone and non-stick pans with no trouble.  The cookies ended up tasting like something from a bakery.  I followed the recipe to the letter, used non-hydrogenated margarine, and changed the chips to 1 cup chocolate two cups peanut butter chips.  Awesome.

I was dissapointed with this recipie.  The cookies tasted fine, but nothing exceptional.  It was very hard to remove them from the cookie sheet(yes, I greased it).  They stuck, crumbled and tore, no matter how long I let them cool.  What I was left with was more fitting to be ice cream toppings.  They also fell flat while cooling, not apealling in a cookie.  In all, it was a waste of my time and ingredients, I have much better recipies to try.

I thought these were great!  Satisfied my chocolate craving. But veeeery sweet.
Mine cooked perfectly (crispy on outside, chewy in centre), but I used parchment paper instead of greasing the sheet. I think this prevented some of the flatness/spreading that other users described.

my cookies were perfect in the first try! I did follow the advice of previous viewers to cut down the amount of sugar(2/3 cup of each white and brown)and chocolate chips(2cups instead of 3), double the cocoa powder, aldo I subtitued half of the plain flour with whole wheat, baked for 12 min under 350. The cookies were uber super delicious; a tad crispy on the edges and all chewy and soft in the middle! Only regret is that I should have doubled the ingredients because they sure don't last very long!

On the next day we usually warm them up for 20 sec in a microwave, so they taste like they are just from the oven. But these cookies are soooo good!!!! Thanks a lot for the recipe!!!

It's annoying when recipes get rated after being altered from the original but that is what I did...not much though. I rated it 4 stars because only after the slight changes did I think it deserved 5. Personal preference maybe. I cut the sugars to about 3/4 c. each, used butter, cut choc. chips to 2 cups (1 cup mini, 1 c. jumbo chips)and sprinkled them lightly with powdered sugar. Plenty sweet, PLENTY of choc chips. absolutely delicious! Next time I think I will try a little coconut and pecans or walnuts for added texture and flavor.

This is a perfect way to get your chocolate fix. Delicious. This is the second time I have made this recipe. The first time was good, but I had to substitute some of the chocolate chips for walnuts. They were really good. This time I stuck to the recipe but added a bit more chocolate powder as some people said and since it was a bit wet, I added a bit more flour. The results are amazing. This is a very easy recipe but gives excellent results..............Linda

Tasty but too sweet for my liking. I'll decrease the amount of sugar next time I make these. Otherwise, soft and chewy. Good recipe

These were very good.  Only rated 4/5 because they were very crispy the first time I made them.  I used butter flavor Crisco but I think I cooked them too long.  I used parchment paper instead of greasing cookie sheets. I am making again soon so will update after I tweak by cooking less time.

Delicious! Would absolutely make again!  I followed the advice to cut the sugar and I added chopped walnuts with only 2 cups of mini semi sweet chocolate chips and they turned out great! I also used shortening instead of butter. They were soft and stayed soft for as long as they lasted (about 2 weeks).  I use stoneware so no need to grease my pan and they kept their shape.  Speaking of shape, I spooned them onto the pan instead of rolling.  To me this makes a more "homemade" looking cookie.  I also put the mix in the fridge between pans to keep the mix firm.  I even doubled the recipe and it still worked out!

I modified this recipe slightly based on other reviews. I used 1/2 cup cocoa, 2 cups chocolate chips, 1 tsp cayenne, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and had the oven at 350. I stuck to the rest of the recipe. I added the margarine and eggs to the sugar right before I combined the wet and dry ingredients to make sure my margarine wasn't melty? I did not grease the cookie sheet. The cookies turned out fluffy after 10 minutes exactly and they dropped a bit out of the oven. They were crunchy on the outside and chewy and delicious inside. I probably will use a little less cayenne next time though.

This was an especially good recipe.  I didn't have the unsweetened cocoa powder and used hersheys dark chocolate cocoa powder instead. The cookies came out much darker in appearance, and were ...as the recipe says ... very very very good.

Wow! Fresh out of the oven and slightly cripsy and ooey gooey chewy on the inside.  I just loved this cookie. I could only eat 2 and I am a sweet food junkie most days so that's saying alot lol.  They are rich and delicious.  I may put a few less chips in next time but not sure as they were just wonderful even still.  The only thing different that I did was add 1/2 tsp salt to the butter mixture and 1/2 tsp baking powder to the flour mixture.  These cookies were the pefect thickness (not too thin or thick) and they did not spread even without freezing or flash freezing the dough.  That's a great benefit as well.  I froze 3 small logs (enough for each to make 12 cookies) and ate 1 log fresh.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I'll continue to use.  My family loved them.
Update: 2/18/08: I made these for a chocolate fellowship at church last night and the recipe allowed me to yeild 60 cookies total and they were all gone quickly.  Still one of my favorite recipes.

I used 1/2 c. of cocoa powder (like another user suggested) and peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.  I only used 2 cups of the chips and it still has a lot of them per cookie.  I baked them on a dark sheet, so I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked them 5 minutes, then sprinkled some raw sugar on top (to make it look nice and give it a little crunch) then put it back in the oven for another 4 mins and they came out perfect.

The cookies are more cake-like than I usually enjoy but yummy nonetheless!  (The dough is the most delicious part—mmmm!)  I substituted butter for margarine and added coffee granules and a bit of chilled black coffee to taste; the coffee flavor really emphasizes the chocolate.

This recipe tastes gorgeous but it did flatten a lot.  I love chewy, even gooey cookies but this recipe took the biscuit (sorry), Looking forward to substituting the butter with a bit of marg and see if that makes the difference.  I think this recipe is a keeper but one that maybe needs to be worked on to suit your own tastes. MEx

My daughter told me this morning she would like to make Chocolate/chocolate cookies.  I said I would try  and then I found this recipe.  
 I have to say these are very good.  And it's not too chocolate tasting either. 
 I used butter flavored crisco instead of margarine and they were light and fluffy. 
 I would double the recipe though because I made them a little big in size and there weren't many to go around.  
Thanks for sharing this recipe will make them again.

Yum! My roomates thought they were fabulous! I tried using butter (it proved to be overwhelming so next time I will indeed use margarine. Also, I used a mix of milk chocolate chunks and  semi sweet chips and found the results to be great. My roomates and I thank you for sharing!

Since so many of the other reviews said that the 3 cups of chocolate chips was too much, I just added one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  I ended up with a bunch of very flat (but chewy) cookies with giant chocolate lumps.  Personally, I feel that this recipe tasted just like a standard chocolate chip cookie.  When I hear "double chocolate", I expect more chocolate flavor.  This was more of a buttery/brown sugary cookie.

These cookies were unbelievable I found the recipe about a month ago and they have been requested four times since! Instead of semisweet chocolate chips I used mini hershey's kisses. I am a chocoholic and these are definitely the best double chocolate cookies I've ever had.

Wonderful consistency and texture (Chewy). I used one and a half sticks real butter and a quarter cup shortening. The only thing I would do differently next time is try three quarter cup of each sugar instead of full cup as they are a little too sweet for us.

Very good chocolate cookie with crispy edges and a chewy center. I used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and the rest semi-sweet and they turned out yummy.  The dough was a bit sticky and I had to put it in the fridge in between rolling out to put on the cookie sheets.  All-around crowd pleaser in our family.

This is a GREAT cookie.  It has fast become a favorite at my house.  My family can hardly wait for the cookies to come out of the oven, they all stand around waiting for the timer to go off. I definately recomend this recipe.

This is the _best_ double chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made.  I just finished a batch of double chocolate chip cookies made from a different recipe -- they simply do not compare.  Try this recipe out, you'll be the hit of the party.

First time I ever didnt read the reviews first, because I was lead to believe the author had spent 10 years perfecting this recipe?! Nothing like making a double batch of chocolate pancakes.... As for the taste, bland is the best I can give. Sorry to be so harsh, but do yourself a favor and find another recipe, save yourself the time and money :(

These cookies were delicious and now my husband's favorite. I loved them so much I am adding them to my Christmas cookie gift tins!  I added more flour like The author suggested. Thank you for adding that. I also refrigerated for 30 minutes to make scooping easier.

I haven't tried them yet, they smell delicious though. I did have issue with it being to liquidy, so I added more flour, but the cookies still didnt hold their shape very well. The cookies were larger than I had hoped, but honestly as long as they taste good I dont mind too much.

My son loves these and my daughter likes them.  Very, very sweet, even though I cut back to only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of Splenda.  Some other modifications that worked for me were 2 cups of choc chips, rather than 3, as many other reviewers recommended.  And 1/2 cup of cocoa.  I think I might go even lower on the sugar next time.   But all in all, very good.

Awesome cookies! Only tweaked the salt - I used half what the recipe called for. And to be honest I didn’t measure the chocolate chips (who even does that?) and just used the whole bag. Got rave reviews from the family. I took some to work and they were a hit there as well!

These are good, I like the cocoa in them but all the "very's" is way overrated!    After the first batch, they seemed to be lacking something so I stirred in about 3/4 c quick oatmeal and a 1/2 package of milk chocolate (Guittard is all I use)    They were WAY better than the first batch which were thin and not the best of a FULL flavor!

just ok. overly sweet without much flavour. I chilled my dough before baking so they weren't too flat but not chewy at all, crisp like store bought cookies. I won't be making these again.

Overall, this is a good cookie. The dough is very stiff though unless you melt all the butter. I decided to revise this just a bit. Instead of 1C brown sugar, I only used 3/4C.  I also used butter instead of margarine. And I added 2-3 tbsp of milk so that the dough would soften a bit and I could use a cookie dough scooper/melon baller to scoop my dough. They came out delicious and I would definitely make them again. Thanks!

Turned out perfect! I decreased oven temp to 355 degrees and baked 10-12 min on greased cookie sheet. (Coconut oil) . Used only 1 bag of chocolate chips and 1 cup cocoa crispies and 1 cup marshmallow bits.

Very VERY Good!!!! I followed the recipe and baked 10 minutes at 350 degrees. I think it is imperative to leave the cookies cool for 2-3 minutes before removing them from pan to cooling rack. It's a keeper for me! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was very simple with big payoff! My family loves them. I read most of the reviews first & chose to modify the recipe a bit too. 1. I used 1/2 c cocoa powder. 2. I used 1 c butter flavored shortening instead of butter. 3. I used 1 c chocolate chips, 1 c peanut butter chips, & 1 c walnuts... 4. I did not grease (air-bake) cookie sheet but cut temp to 350 & baked a full ten minutes. 5. I scooped dough w/ a mini ice cream style scooper to get evenly baked cookies & they came out perfect! Hope this helps.

These really are the best cookies! I always use softened butter and I also use one whole 12 of bag of white chocolate chips and one whole 12 of bag of dark chocolate chips along with dark chocolate cocoa and bake for 10 minutes. They turn out perfect every time, I've never had an issue or any complaints.  :) I make these every chance I get and they are always a huge hit.

*** Also as a reply to the authors comment that these are better for larger cookies.... If you want smaller cookies just bake them a little less and they're still perfect ??

These cookies taste great and look professionally made, which is quite a feat for a beginner such as myself! Used butter instead of margarine; followed the advice of a previous reviewer and let butter soften at room temp before creaming with sugar. Baked cookies on ungreased aluminum foil, shiny side down. Cookies retained shape; lovely, crackly outside and chewy inside. My fiance couldn't stop eating them. :)

This is a keeper!

Took other reviewers advice and nearly doubled the cocoa powder for that nice dark brown color.  Also added a little extra flour (as I do with all chocolate chip cookies).

I tweaked this recipe ...I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and increased cocoa to 1/2 cup.  Also used peanut butter chips and butter instead of marg. Very good!!  I find the comments really helpful when deciding if I am going to use the recipe and also what changes I might want make...

These are simply amazing. Definitely the best batch of cookies I've ever baked (and I bake a LOT!) I used white and milk chocolate chips, this is the only change I made to the recipe. SO GOOD!

These turned out delicious, and the only difference I made was that I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. But if I ever used this recipe again, I would use a little less sugar. The cookies are pretty crystallized by the amount of sugar.

The best double-chocolate cookie I have ever made… and possibly the best chocolate chip cookie PERIOD. Make sure to refrigerate your dough for 1-2 hours at least-- this solves the issue with cookies coming out too flat. Also, increase that cocoa up to 1/2 cup. 

Fantastic recipe. Will be making again and again.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!! This cookies were amazing!! And addicting!! I reduced both the white and brown sugar down to about 3/4 cups each and doubled the amount of cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey (I also used dark chocolate cocoa powered). I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and substituted white chocolate chips in for the regular ones. This recipe was super easy to make. I made them in a shared college kitchen with very limited baking utensils, and they still turned out amazing! My floor ate an entire gallon zip-lock bag full in about 20 min. they were that good!

These are the best cookies I have ever made!  The texture and taste are to die for.  I used a little more cocoa powder and a little less chocolate chips than it called for. Thanks for these perfect cookies!

YUMMM! I didn't have margarine on hand, so I used butter, plus I increased the cocoa powder to a 1/2 cup and mixed in Andes mint chocolate chips. I saw a previous reviewer's complaint that using butter made the cookies spread, so I scooped the dough out onto a piece of wax paper and put it in the freezer for about and hour, baked only what I wanted, bagging the rest and storing the rest in the freezer for future use. They still spread, but the resulting texture is a nice light, crispness on the edges and chewy in the middle. Will definitely make these again!

Probably one of the best cookie recipes I've ever tried.  I also used butter and had no problems with the shape or chewiness of the cookie.  They were even chewy after being in the freezer or refrigerator.  The only problem I had was mixing the dough because it got really thick, but that was a minor issue.

Very very good! Perfect texture, fluffiness and color. Really love these. Added 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of 1/3. Only wishing I had some nuts....  but I'll be making again for sure!!! (Take out as soon as top gets a little firm, but not cooked all the way though, keeps them soft)

I made it without changing the sugar amount. In my opinion, they turned out just fine. I also substituted 2 of the cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips for white chocolate chips. The cookies taste delicious!! The recipe does actually make 40 good-sized cookies so you may want to make a half-batch.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  The first time I baked them I used an air-bake cookie sheet.  it was a disaster.  They came out like muffin tops.  They were hollow, candy-like, and hard.  The second batch I used a standard cookie sheet and they came out better.  I cooked both large and small cookies.  The large ones were definitely better but not what I'd call great.  I saw the post by the author of this recipe but only after the fact.  The recipe needs to be rewritten with her adjustments so that it comes out right every time.

Absolute perfection.  I did half the recipe.  I used margerine and added a few spoonfuls of pecans and the cookies did not have crisp edges and were not flat. I did bake on parchment paper as I usually do. They were round, attractive and delicious cookies.  This recipe is a keeper and great it is so easy...they disappear quickly.

Yummy cookies! Nice and crispy!  I used butter instead of margarine and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup,they had just enough sweetness. Next time I would add a little more baking soda to lift them, a little too flat.

Now that my cookies are out of the oven and flat and rather no descript in shape I see there was a very recent update stating to referate the dough., I am sure this would make it better. I followed the recipie to the letter and my dough was runny and my cookies are flat. I might try this again with refigeration but was not impressed with the first round.

Talk about the perfect cookie.. We follwed this recipe to the T... They almost actually taste like brownie cookies.. Now the next step is to try some white chocolate or peanut butter chips. :D

Delicious! Everyone loved these cookies. The only difference I made was dark chocolate chips instead of regular. The one problem I had was they were very flat, with crispy edges. Next time I'll add more flour and maybe 1/2 shortening 1/2 margarine.

I can't exactly rate this recipe because I made one alteration that could have changed the outcome-- I used butter... but because I was taught to use butter.  These cookies taste absolutely amazing and rich in chocolate.  I never bake dark cookies, so it was very difficult for me to take them out right when the edges were dark/ a little under-baked (the way I like my cookies).  These cookies were also not very aesthetically pleasing.  But, I definitely thought the chocolate and crispiness of the cookies were fantastic.

I halved the recipe, it worked out fine.  A little too salty, so I will add less next time.

I've been making these cookies for a couple years, but the recipe I have (from a friend) calls for 3/4 cup of cocoa powder AND I use reece's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. It's very popular in my family:)

Mmm yummy. Very nice cookies! I seem to have a problem with making round cookies so mine turned out kinda weird... But they still tasted awesome! Quite close to the subway cookies.

These are awesome and wonderfully chewy and dense. I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and chilled the dough for about 15 minutes before baking. They look and taste great. I threw in some white chocolate chips as well and now I can't stay out of them!

I used 1/2 c. of cocoa and also used 1 c. of butterscotch chips + 1 c. of chocolate chips - which was plenty of chips, 3 c. would be a lot.  These cookies were so good, very moist and chocolatey but crisp on the outside.  They were gone in 2 days!  Can't wait to make them again!

I wanted to make a chocolate cookie and this had good reviews so I tried it with a few changes. I didnt have chocolate chips so I cut up milk chocolate and toffee candy to put in it and I added walnuts. It tasted alot like a brownie. I also used half margarine and half shortening and added slightly more cocoa. 
 It was good, but I wouldnt say better because I dont like chocolate much. I mostly just made these for my husband and he said they were wonderful(hes the picky one) so I'll give it a 5!

I even forgot the vanilla and they still turned out great.  I halved the recipe, because I didn't have enough flour and it actually made about 25 cookies which was plenty for us!  Great recipe I think, I didn't change it at all.

I loved these cookies! They are a little flat, but I think that is b/c I used butter instead of margarine. Also, I used mini m&ms instead of chocolate chips. They have the simple ingredients that we usually have around the house. Thanks!!

Something went wrong...my cookies came out totally flat!  They really were very good though, but for some reason they flattend out.  My dad ate about 15 of them so it wasn't a total disaster.

OK-I so didn't like these cookies...I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough is tacky-even after I chill them.  The cookies then look & taste like brownies!  I prefer a cookie to taste like a cookie-not a brownie!  Sorry-Won't try them again! Thanks for sharing!

I have tried at least 7 different recipes for cookies from this site and everyone likes these the best.  They do come out really flat.  I use a heaping teaspoon for each cookie.  Also used parchment paper to cook them on for easy clean up.  Thanks Shannon!!!  Michele, Cambridge ontario

These cookies were delicious!  My first batch burned as well, I turned the oven down to 350 and moved the rack to the third position in the oven.  I would definately make them again but I would also cut down the sugar a bit as I found them too sweet.

Made these cookies tonight for the first time, after I burned the first dozen, I cooked them the second time around for 7 minutes (I think my oven has issues). A little dry, but none the less very tasty, make sure there is plenty of milk in the house!

Delicious cookies!  They spread out a lot while baking--maybe it was because I used butter since I didn't have margarine.  The taste and texture however were very good. I used 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1 cup of mini m & ms because my daughter wanted to.  Will definitely try these again!

I thought that the cookie dough tasted very much like a regular chocolate chip cookie...the dough would need more chocolate to be considered "double chocolate" for me.

Even though I chilled the dough and added more flour, the cookies turned out to be very flat and candy-like. They burned (even at 350 degrees) after only five minutes. I just didn't like them.

Made these for Christmas 2002 and they turned out pretty good - I did have to add extra flour though, and they still turned out kind of flat.  But they did stay soft for me and were a pretty popular cookie!  Thanks!

I made these cookies for some friends who were coming to visit, and they were a huge hit! Chewy, Chocolatey, and delicious! I've had requests to bake a batch and bring them to college with me when we start up again in the Fall. I originally made a half batch, and later a whole batch for the 4th of July, but the half batch seemed to work out better. Don't know why.

This is definitely the BEST double chocolate chip cookie I have ever had.  Great with a glass of milk.  You can't just eat one.  Thanks for the recipe.
