Loved how simple this recipe was to make, but disappointed in the cake portion.  I made this exactly as written, but I think the bake time is about 10 minutes too long for a 13 x 9 pan.   I was busy and didn't check the cake as it was baking so it baked the 45 minutes.  I most definitely will try this again (and update my results) but I think it would have been done at about the 35 minute mark.  The batter is very thick when you put it in the pan and is a thin layer.  Next time I'm going to bake in an 11 x 7 pan.

I used vanilla yogurt and some lime juice in place of the sour cream. I also added cinnamon and vanilla in the cake and subbed half whole wheat flour for the white. I baked it in a 10 inch round pan since a previoud reviewer said the stated pan was too big. The 10 inch was a bit too small, the cake ended up being really tall. Next time I'll try the stated pan. We will definately make this again!

Batter was very thick, needed to be spread in the pan.  I worried there was something wrong, but the cake turned out tasty.  I used a 9x13, and felt this was right.  I used 3 cups of rhubarb, and would make it again this way.

The recipe was delicious.  I added 3 cups rhubarb and about 1/3 cup chocolate chips. I also baked it for only 35 minutes and it was perfectly done. Great dessert for all times of the day!

Three cups of rhubarb, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts over the rhubarb and baked 35 minutes and this is absolutely delicious. Definitely a keeper in the recipe box.

I used yogurt in place of the sour cream and increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. It baked 35 minutes. I shared it with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it but agreed next time to try increasing the rhubarb to 3 cups. I did mix a spoonful of the sugar mixture in the rhubarb and then put the rest on top.I also might mix some of the rhubarb in the batter.

Delicious! I added an extra cup of rhubarb, extra cinnamon, and baked it in a slightly smaller pan. It is super moist, and definitely a new favorite!

I made this cake last night with a minor adjustment or two. I mixed the rhubarb into the batter and added 1/2 tsp of salt. I also used half whit sugar and half brown sugar to sprinkle on top. I cooked the cake for the full 45 mins and I have to tell you this cake is awesome. Next time I am going to try 3 cups of rhubarb instead of two, ladies try this I am sure you will love it

This cake was OK but I like my original recipe much better. It was nice and moist and I would make it again but I would definitely make modifications. For one thing I would place only about 1/2 the rhubarb on top of the cake (or less). I would also use brown sugar or maple sugar in place of the white sugar.

I used my favorite gluten free flour....Pamela's. It turned out very good. I just would have liked a crispier topping. It got  soft after it sat overnight.

It was OK.  Mine was done at 37 when I checked it.
