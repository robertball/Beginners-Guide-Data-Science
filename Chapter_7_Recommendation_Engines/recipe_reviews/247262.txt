Great recipe and awesome method.  The only thing I did different is to freeze the butter and then use a food processor with grater blade to quickly grate it and then immediately into the flour mixture & toss gently with a silicone spatula.  This works better for me instead of rubbing the butter and running the risk of softening the butter too much.  I cut them into squares, using a floured chefs knife instead of the biscuit cutter.  Thanks for a delicious flaky perfectly buttery biscuit recipe.

These were the best biscuits I've ever made.  Delicious, flaky, and yummy. Yes, they are bit time intensive, but the result is worth it!

I am a novice baker and these were a little scary to make. I wasn't sure if I was following the instructions perfectly enough. These are forgiving and turned out so flaky and buttery! Best biscuits I've ever had. I broiled mine at the end to brown the tops a little.

They were good!  They didn't rise quite right and seemed like they needed more flour, but I'm wondering if it might have been me getting distracted while baking since no one else seemed to have a problem.  Nonetheless, five stars because the kids loved them.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with the most buttery, flaky biscuits.  If you are a butterholic like I am, you will love these biscuits.

So I followed the recipe to a T but mine were flat like hockey pucks. What did I do wrong? The flavor was great, buttery and flakey, but no rise. Appreciate your help!

I've been looking for an easy biscuit recipe for forever and this is it!  I will never by canned biscuits again. Super flaky with a ton of layers.  No butter needed to eat.  I'm imagining other uses for this dough.  Thank you!!!!

Mine were heavy, over-worked, and took forever to lightly brown. I will try this again, though. I am determined to get better results.

These biscuits were incredibly flaky.  I ran out of buttermilk so I ended up mixing 1/2 cup of whole milk with 1 cup of buttermilk, and coating the tops with heavy cream.

I made these twice and both times they did not turn out, it seems like it has to much butter for the amount of flour but my family did love them.

Great biscuit! I've been making biscuits for 50 years, and its the technique of folding and kneading that makes these flaky. Thanks for sharing!

These biscuits were great!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I grated my butter and then blended it in with a pastry cutter.  The dough was just a little dry, so I added a little more milk to get it the right consistency.   They rose up perfectly, then the bottoms flared out at the end.  Not sure what caused that, but the taste is worth it.  Been looking for the best ever biscuits, and I think they have been found!  Will definitely make these again.

So I LOVE this recipe!!! The thing is, I did the serving of 10, and I made like 40!!! I guess it's because my cutter was smaller than the optimal size.... biscuits for DAYS!!!!!!

They were great!   I am now seeing how the dough freezes to make more later.

This was a great Buttermilk Biscuit recipe, I did substitute  regular butter instead of Land O Lake.  Biscuit were light and fluffy and were full of flavor. Best buttermilk biscuit recipe I found.
