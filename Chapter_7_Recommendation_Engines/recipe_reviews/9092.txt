This is everyone's favorite! I have been asked for this recipe many, many times. Everytime the holidays come around, people start asking, are you going to make that candy with the caramel and nougat in it? Truly better than a Snickers bar. And a tip: coat the inside of your 9x13 pan with a thin layer of non-stick cooking spray, then freeze the bottom layer before adding the other layers. That will help it not to stick.

I've made this recipe lots of times and although I would agree it is time consuming, everyone loves it when I make it. 

Just one tip to shorten the time a little. I use the microwave to melt the chocolate layers and the caramel layer. Just check your chips after every 30 seconds (stirring each time you check). Do not overcook chocolate in the microwave!

I hope this helps!

These are very yummy!!!  Suggestion - let them warm up a little before you cut them because the chocolate top will crack and come off otherwise!

Awesome!! After reading the other reviews, I used a smaller pan, it was an odd sized foil pan, about 10x9, this make the layers a little thicker. I lined the pan in foil (just to give me something to lift it out with) and than a piece of waxed paper. When completed, I just lifed it out and inverted it. The waxed paper pulled away really easier. I did cut it one piece at a time in 1 inch squares. They look and taste great.

I enjoyed this.  As far as getting the bottom layer up, I found that leaving it out of the fridge at room temp for 20 minutes helped.  I also wish the chocolate layers were a bit thicker.  The caramel oozed out a lot when left out to serve at my gathering.  Maybe next time, I won't use quite as much of the whipping cream, then it will be thicker and hold its shape.  Overall, it was good.

The candy was delicious, but a bit messy.  Since it must be kept refridgerated, if it was not consumed immediately, the caramel would begin to melt if at room temperature for more then 5 minutes.  I will make again for a party at home, but not to take to work, school , etc due to  the gooey-ness.

This was soooo yummy! Everyone loved them. The only thing I have to disagree with is that it doesn't really taste like Snickers. But it's its own fantastic taste! I skipped the spray and used parchment paper instead. Just take the whole batch out of the pan, flip upside down and peel the paper off. I followed the recipe exaclty. It's a lot of steps and a bit time consuming but it's so worth it and got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper.

I made these for Christmas, and they were a BIG hit!!  Everyone loved them!  My husband thought they were the best thing I made this year. I cut them in smaller squares and put them in little mini cupcake papers (the ones for candy) to dress them up a little. They looked like they were bought at the store! Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll be making it every year from now on!

I have wanted to make this for a while now and finally did.  It does take some time but the results are worth it!  I did what others have mentioned and put down parchment paper in the pan just lift it up and peel off very easily.  I highly recommend doing it this way or else it may be a bit hard once it comes time to cutting and getting the candies out. Make sure you put in frig to set before each layer.  It tasted much better than a snickers and i couldnt believe i actually made them. I would suggest that once the last layer of chocolate is on and is partially set (not soupy but before it gets hard) that you start to cut your pieces in the pan this way the chocolate wont crack once set when you cut it.  You can then go back later and recut and it will be very simple to get out. I put mine in a small 8 X 8 pan and at first didnt look like it would be much but after cutting out a bunch of 2 inch pieces i realized it could be cut even more into about 1 inch pieces, i then put it on a decorative wrapper.  It really is a filling candy.  All in all it made alot and im glad i didnt double the recipe.  I had put in only a cup of peanuts but will use the suggested   1 1/2 cups next time.  Now i wish i only had company over or somewhere to bring these as they are very impressive.  I will definitely put this on my list of things to make during each holiday.

I made this as part of my Christmas baking, and it was a huge hit!  Kind of like a Snickers bar, but much creamier and tastier!  I will definitely make this again.  Yummy!

Yummy! It is a lot of work but it is worth all of it. Next time I make it though I am going to cut back on the peanut butter.

These were very good, although very sweet. They are best cut in small pieces. The only thing about them I don't like is that the bottom layer does not come up off the pan very well...but making sure they are very thoroughly chilled before cutting helps some.

Good, but a lot of work.  They tasted like a very sweet Snickers bar. I made these for Christmas and didn't get rave reviews from anybody.  If I ever decide to make again I would substitute milk chocolate chips for the butterscotch ones and add a little salt to one of the layers to cut down on sweetness.

Super yummy. Didn't have butterscotch chips so I didn't put them in. Also, I didn't have peanuts, so I did cashews on part, almonds for another, and no nuts on another section. Loved the almonds!

This is an outstanding recipe.
I was able to make the bottom layer and the top layer by melting in the microwave for several minutes on defrost.   
This candy makes everyone rave and ask for your recipe !  Thanks Merry CHRISTmas

First off, these are absolutely delicious! However, most people that tried them said they were too sweet (a description that is often difficult for me to understand). They are very sweet. The downside is that they are not a "quick fix" candy. They take time, but are definitely worth trying. They remind me of a Snickers candy bar - only better! If you have the time and want to impress, these candies are perfect.

WAYYYYY TOO SWEET!!!! I didn't have a problem taking the candy out of the pan, however, it is rather thin and messy.  We had to eat it with a fork, my girls who are big chocolate lovers, didn't even finish their small piece.  I won't be making this again, but I would recommend that others try a graham cracker crust or something that allows this to be more manageable.  Each layer tasted great as I was making it, but all together is just too much for me.

OH MY GOD. No one could stop eating this stuff! I've resigned myself to only making it once a year around the holidays so I have the rest of the year to lose the weight I gain by eating half the tray! This is probably the best candy I've ever made. Everyone raved about it.

I followed the recipe and directions exactly, but lined the pan with parchment paper like others suggested so there was no need to butter the pan. They came out great, made about 84 one inch squares, with some excess from the sides that my husband and daughter were happy to taste test. I also pressed little candy cane decorations on the top to give them something a little extra and put them in mini muffin wrappers. They look really nice and will be a nice addition to the cookie tray. And this wasnt as much work as it sounds like. I just made the first layer, spread in the pan, freeze while making the second layer, and so on. And since the bottom and top layer are the same just use two pans and put your ingredients in each at the same time, then wait to heat the second pan until you are on the final layer.

Sadly, I will probably never know how good this recipe is because I’m afraid to give it a second try.  Although I followed the instructions closely, I had a problem with the second layer and most likely overcooked my nougat.  Its consistency falls somewhere between caramel and brittle.  It is very hard to cut, but doesn’t shatter like brittle.  Once I suspected my error, I decide not to finish the recipe and waste more ingredients.  Perhaps the caramel layer would have softened the nougat, but I would not risk wasting more time and ingredients.  I was cooking on a gas range.  Perhaps, the heat needed to be a bit lower.  Oh well, these treats won’t be going in my boxes of homemade candies this Christmas.

This candy is to die for! I did add about 2 T of parafin to the chocolate layers to make it less 'melty', but did everything else exactly as the recipe says. Fabulous!

These are amazing - very, very rich and I'm sure they will be a big hit. The only thing I will say is that they are VERY hard to cut because of the peanuts and the caramelization. If anyone has any tips for this, I'd love to hear them!

This was my first attempt at preparing any sort of a candy.  It was a very easy recipe, a lot of steps, but easy.  I loved them!!  I love snickers anyway, now I can make them myself!!  Definitely going to make these again and again.

This is wonderful!  I make a lot of Christmas candy and wanted to try something new.  This recipe will be added to my candy trays every year from now on.  It tastes like a peanut buttery Snickers bar.  Delicious!

I'm not sure why I didn't get it as I was making the layers, but it was sure a tasty surprise when I took the first bite and instantly thought "Snickers!"  My mom and aunt make a recipe similar to this.  They keep the candy in the freezer until ready to be put out.  Caramel doesn't melt as quickly.  Just be carefult when you bit in!

This recipe (well, very similar recipe) has been in my family and I LOVE it! We call them "Snickers Bars." The only difference I've used is melting the caramels with water. I'll try this version next time I make them. I just wanted to note that if you are thinking of making these bars, they are delish!

Wonderful recipe Big hit over the holidays.  Had problems removing from pan.  Bottom layer would not come out cleanly.  Next time I will make a cookie crumb crust then add first layer.

Very good candy.  Next time I will leave out the peanut butter----but it's very good with it too.  The nougat is what I love!!  I lined my pan with parchment paper and had no trouble getting them out of the pan.  A huge hit at work!

This is absolutely yummy and so addictive.  I am not a fan of marshmallow in candy, but this one is wonderful.  Everyone that has received this as a gift or tasted it, wants the recipe.  If I could give it more stars, I would.

I prefer to give these a 4 1/2 but, that is not an option.  I have made these several years in a row now because they are that good.  the reason I didn't give them a 5 is because of either the nougat filling or the caramel layer.  If these get even slightly warm, the start to ooze.  this year when i make them I might have to dip the whole squre into chocolate to keep them more stable.  As for taste - these are amazing and do taste like fresh made snickers bars.

Simple, and simply divine!  I put the squares in those candy wrappers, and they looked beautiful.  Didn't change a thing, but did put each layer in the freezer inbetween stages to make sure I didn't have to wait to spread the next one.

YUMMY!!!  I can't say enough good things about these!  I added crushed peanuts to the top of one batch.  They are absolutely delicious!!!  I will say that they need to stay flat at all times because the caramel will slide causing a big mess but these are really fabulous... We will definitely be making these in the future, possibly again before Christmas :)  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The size you cut these really makes a difference! They are very sweet so smaller is better. I made them on Friday and it took all day making sure the layers were set, then letting get to room temp to cut them without the top cracking... I was running late to my dinner party. So I cut them quickly into 1''x2'' bars thinking more would be better. No one really commented on these except to say they were very rich and sweet. Like they had to choke them down! After all that work I wanted to salvage them so I cut into 1'' squares like the recipe states, then cut them again diagonally. I brought these to a family get together Sunday and  people were seriously groaning (in a good way) while eating them and SEVERAL people asked me to bring these EVERY year! I am a good cook & baker, but I don't think I have ever gotten a response like that before! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I am known for my sweets ... cookies and fudge, cupcakes...anything sweet I bring around and folks gobble it up and rave about it.  This recipe brought it to a whole new level.  Yesterday I had a grown man tell me that he hopes this is what clouds in heaven taste like!   AMAZING!  They were a little sticky, but it is hot here so we just kept them in the fridge.  OMG I think thins might be my signature candy now!

These are actually easy to make.  I use my microwave to melt the chips/pnut butter layers and caramel layer. I also make the middle layer in the microwave, just watch the time when mixture begins to boil and boil for 5 min  on high or 50-80% power, depending on your microwave.  Does taste like a Snickers!!

Yum! It's pretty rich so I save it for Christmas. Making 8 dozen means plenty for gift giving. Just know before you get started that all four layers need to be chilled before adding the next one. Of course it will take some to get together. Just do something else in between layers. Everyone loves this one. Thank you!

This recipe was rich, but delicious.  My family said it was like eating a Snickers bar.  It's time consuming though and messy to make if you don't have a large kitchen.

This is a fantastic recipe... make sure you have plenty of time to make it...it takes alot of time to let the layers cool. I would do some prep work like opening the carmels beforehand... I took it to a Christmas party and everyone loved it...too good for words. Good recipe for friends to get together and make... doesn't hurt to have someone to help stir. THANKS for the recipe.

This is very good.  Better than a candy bar.  They did get a little melty if left out too long.

Disaster,  first layer was not enough and did not melt into anything usable, 2nd layer Marshmallow, runs at room temp/ 3rd layer caramel also runs/ the 4th layer turned out well i learned to add some evap milk to melt  it and  make it smooth and  easy to apply.  have to freeze it to keep from melting. Need some kids to eat it, won't do to serve it.

very good and popular at the party I brought this to.  everyone liked it but I personally don't love it.  I followed the recipe to a T and while I guess it is impressive to make yourself, I think it just needs something more to make it 5 stars for me.  mine also stuck quite a bit to the bottom of the pan and I both sprayed it with non-stick cooking spray and froze the bottom layer of chocolate.  I'd estimate 25% of the chocolate remained in the pan.  also, it definitely needs to be kept refrigerated, the caramel will ooze out of the squares if it gets soft.  I most likely won't make this again but I appreciate the chance to try it!  thanks!

ok...all I can say is "wow". this is sooo yummy! just finished making a batch with semi-sweet chips...holy moly. in cold weather climes (it's 25 degrees outside), just set it outside for the in between steps, instead of the frige: only needs 15 minutes each time on the porch versus the 1hr in the fridge. this stuff is deadly!

WOW!!! These were even better then everyone made them sound. They really are better then a Snickers. I made two batches and the second one I used a little less chocolate on the top. I liked that better because otherwise the chocolate seemed to overwhelm it (personal taste I guess).  I also used cooking spray on the first batch but I think I over did it because you could taste the "PAM" flavor on some of the pieces.  So be careful to "lightly" spray it.  Next time I am going to try some wax paper as others suggested. I didn't have a hard time cutting them I just used a really sharp knife. Don't be intimated by all the steps. I just filled the sink with soapy water and while I was waiting for each step to set in the fridge I washed everything I had just used. It seems like a lot of steps but they are really quick and easy and don't seem that bad when your into it.  Even if this was really hard to make I would still do it because it is so worth it!!!  Thank you Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

This candy is wonderful!  As everyone has said, tastes like a Snickers bar.  Very intense recipe and time consuming to make and cut up, but worth it.  I'll definately make it again for a holiday or special day.  Put it in a nice gift tin or box and it makes a great gift!

This is AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. I didn't have any trouble with the bottom layer sticking like others did. I used non-stick spray, and it came out of the pan perfectly. Definitely cut it into one inch squares because it is so rich!

These do taste just like a candy bar, only with this fantastic homemade taste. Yes, the ingredient list and instructions are a little bit intimidating, but it's worth it. They are rich so I make sure to cut them into tiny squares. Definitely a recipe to make if you are trying to impress someone who is a candy lover.

I could not believe the response I got from this candy.  Everyone asked for more and talked about how tasty it was.  We nicknamed it "the Snicker candy."  It was a bit time consuming to make just because the layers had to cool but it was well worth it.  The layers looked for beautiful once the candy was cut.  I will use this recipe over and over.  Wonderful!!!

This is a great sweet and sticky candy bar.  Every year I make plates and tins of cookies and candies for the holidays to send to friends and family.  These candies are requested by all.  Well worth the time they take to make.

I thought this took a lot of time to make but everybody loved it. A lot of stirring, melting, refrigerating involved, but it's worth it.

I have been making this candy since 1999 when I first found the recipe. As my children have grown and married, this is the one thing they look for when they come home for the holidays. I let them bring the typical Christmas cookies and I make the candy. There are a lot of steps, but the end result is well worth the effort.  Make sure to line the pan with parchment paper and store in the refrigerator

Absolutely killer good!  Very rich so cut it into smaller squares. And keep it cold or keep ice under the serving dish when out of the refrigerator as it will get awfully gooey when warm. Made this for a snow skiing barbecue with 14 people. It was so yummy that we offered it to other skiers and they kept coming back for more. It's a keeper!

This recipe is excellent, and addictive.  I've made it several times, and have no problems with the layers, etc.  I don't think it's that much work, either - you mainly have to allow the "chill" time between layers, but I just work on other things while I'm waiting.  I make holiday tins for people, and this candy is included for everyone.
