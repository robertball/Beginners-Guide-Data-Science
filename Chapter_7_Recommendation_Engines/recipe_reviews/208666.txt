I liked the idea of shaping guacamole into a wreath for a Christmas party.  I used tomatoes for holley berries and cilantro for the bow.  The only problem was it looked like a runny, green mess once people started digging in.  So only the people that were there first could appreciate what it was supposed to look like.  I used my usual guacamole recipe with avocado, lime juice, jalepenos, tomatoes, onion and cilantro.

This was a cute idea for christmas, but the guacamole was pretty bland. I used tomotoes instead of the red pepper. Very cute will probably use again for christmas.
