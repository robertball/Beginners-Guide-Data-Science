I’m happy to be this recipe’s first reviewer and to offer this glowing review.  I LOVED these; however, I used them as a vegetable side dish, not as an appetizer.  I altered the recipe only slightly – the uncooked spinach is so bulky I knew it would be a problem filling the mushrooms caps, but microwaving it briefly until it was slightly wilted took care of that issue handily.  Since I was serving this as a side dish I was tempted to omit the pepperoni and I’m so glad I didn’t – the flavor it contributed was distinct, delicious and would have been missed.  These were meaty, substantive and flavorful, not to mention an attractive and inviting statement on the dinner plate.

I want to say something before I review this recipe: I have never cooked in my life. Never anything more complicated than ramen noodles and Kraft macaroni and cheese. And I even messed those up by overcooking the noodles to be absolutely sure they were done.

I am getting married in a month and I somehow agreed to cook dinner for my fiancee for Valentine's day. I was so worried about what I would cook. I joked that it would be fish sticks marinated in Spaghettios, but I was really nervous about making something edible.

I found several recipes here and decided to go with this one. I didn't really know what I was doing, but I bought each item and set down in the kitchen to get to work. The recipe is straightforward, simple, easy enough for a novice and incredibly delicious. She was so proud of me and so impressed and it was a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner. I'm attaching a picture (but it was taken after she had already cut the portobello in half).

Thank you so much to whoever created this and thank you allrecipes.com for making it so accesible. I can't believe I made something actually edible by humans, and in fact deliciously so! You made Valentine's Day awesome for us!

These were fantastic! I used salami instead of pepperoni and it was delicious. Also when draining the mushrooms after the first baking round, know that they're extremely full of juice and are fragile from being cooked. I'd recommend a turkey baster to remove the juices and not break the mushroom edges trying to pour it out. Otherwise fantastic recipe!

These were delicious! I only made two but used the ingredients as written for four. I sauteed chopped onion and red bell pepper in a little olive oil until softened and translucent, then tossed the raw spinach on top to wilt it down a bit. Added all the other ingredients, mixed and topped the portabellas. Worked out great. I baked for slightly longer than the amount of time written to get the mozzarella on top to brown slightly. Thanks for this recipe. I'll be making it often. BTW we used this as a main course.

AMAZING! So easy! I have made these 5x in the last 3 weeks. They re-heat really well too so you can make/bake ahead and then refrigerate and reheat. Best advise is after you chop the fresh spinach, put it in the microwave for 45 seconds to let it wilt a little. Then mis with all the other ingredients. I also used thinly sliced Peppered Salami chopped up... so tasty!

Yummy :)   The stuffing has such a wonderful zesty flavor that marries perfectly with the mellow flavor of the mushroom. Very quick & easy to prepare. I served this as a main dish with sides of rice and garlic green beans (from this site as well). Note:probably best to add less salt for seasoning, since pepperoni and cheese can be pretty salty on their own.

Great base recipe... I changed all the ingredients. Used feta cheese & rice combined with ground venison in a "mediteranian salsa" from WholeFoods. (Fresh parsley, lemon juice, kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes & Feta) I also made little aluminum foil "rings" as a base to set the mushrooms onto. (This keeps them from getting as soggy in the pan. It elevated them from sitting in the juices.) And I brushed them with garlic butter instead of dressing.

These were AMAZING! Loved every bite and so did my picky husband! The only thing I changed was the pepperoni...I used cooked bacon instead, because I had it leftover from another recipe. I also used chopped onion and did not sauté it first. It was perfect, and the flavors were wonderful!

Great recipe! but what's even better...I had left over "stuffing" and mixed it with ground turkey, adding another egg, some Worcester sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Amazing turkey balls!!!!

Love love love them!! We smoked them on the grill w wood chips! It gave the cheese an awesome flavor! We also used fresh spinach. Can't wait to make them again. Next time we will try prosciutto instead of pepperoni.

Delicious.  I used a little more mozzarella.  I also added some sauteed onion and red pepper because I didn't have as much spinach as was called for and I thought it would need the extra moistness from the onion and pepper mix.  Turned out fantastic and I think I'll just keep those small changes.

Used the mid-sized mushroom caps and greek dressing as I didn't have Italian. Fresh spinach wilted in a pan with diced stems and garlic. Omitted the pepperoni. Served as a side dish and put in pita bread the next day for a sandwich with some tomato and lettuce. Wonderful flavor!

These were excellent!  I used medium sized portabella caps and served them as a side dish. We will definitely be eating these again! Thank you for a great recipe- I didn't change a thing.

Very nice recipe! I made these as an appetizer by simply cutting each into 6 pieces while they were still slightly warm. The prep was easy. I used frozen spinach, thawed, and squeezed dry so this resolved the problem that some reviewers had with the difficulty handling fresh spinach. Once all of the ingredients were added, the spinach mixture topped the mushroom easily. I could form the mixture to fit. I baked them longer than noted (both the mushroom initially, and then the second bake too). These were wonderful, lovely to serve, and mostly guilt free. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My husband loved it. Super easy to make. Had them in the oven for 15 min instead of 12 because they did not tenderize with that amount of time. Will definetely do again.

Oh. My. Gawd. This was fabulous. My changes: I sauteed the chopped stem with some onion and garlic, then tossed the spinach in to wilt. I think it made it more manageable. Did not even detect the pepperoni so I will probably leave it out next time although it may have been scant as I don't measure. Go light on salt. Only my second 5 star rating.

A keeper for special events, when a vegetarian is joining us!

I thought they were delicious, but I love mushrooms. The real shocker was that my 11-year-old son who dislikes mushrooms greatly tried a bite of one and asked if he could eat the rest of it. The only tweak I will make next time is not to add more salt - I think the pepperoni and cheese are salty enough that extra salt is not needed, but that's my preference. Thank you for the recipe!

WOW! LOVED THIS! I made a couple of changes for my taste. I used Turkey pepperoni (you would barely notice the difference). I used a slice of Mozzarella over the top at the end and no breadcrumbs (I was out). I also sauteed an onion and garlic and added the spinach to wilt for a second. We ate this as a meal- it was wonderful.

I substituted Canadian Bacon for the pepperoni, as pepperoni gives us heartburn. I will make it again, but I will only use half as much spinach. I way overstuffed the mushrooms and have enough left to stuff 4 more. Will add the leftovers to scrambled eggs for breakfast.

I followed suggestions of others and sautéed onion, the gills, and the garlic first then added in the spinach so it would wilt. It was great.

While that unflattering photo accompanying this recipe looks somewhat like a withered and weathered turtle (sorry!) This is indeed a very great recipe and one you can tweak to your liking!  I prefer red bell pepper AND pepperoni!   Thanks for sharing!!!

I did, used Balsamic vinegar which I had, chopped up 6 cloves of garlic, split btwn steamed spinach and mushrooms, used HOt It sausage casing removed and sauteed in same pan as the sauteed onions  also used habanaro cheese grated very small and asiago cheese grated small with 3,  4" diameter portobello shrooms.  Never made this before.  It was awesome!  Will definitely make this again.  I did take a picture,  Posted it on twitter.

Made several changes.  Added a bunch of chopped fresh parsley to the chopped spinach.  Used 16oz ricotta cheese and added another egg.  Substituted the pepper for the pepperoni as suggested.  Added two teaspoons of Italian seasoning.  Used Fresh Expressions salad dressing to brush the mushrooms prior to the first bake.  Got lots of compliments and passed the modified recipe on. Also topped each mushroom with grated smoked Gouda for another layer of favor plus it browns beautifully.

I loved it and will definitely make it again. I did not use pepperoni in it and added paprika to the spinach mixture. I also brushed the mushrooms with basalmic vinegar and olive oil.

I made this recipe using smaller mushrooms as appetizers for Thanksgiving.  They were easy to prepare, although the recipe called for the mushroom stems to be discarded, I  minced them  and added them to the spinach mixture.  
They were a big hit with my  family.  Plan on preparing this recipe again for Xmas Eve.

I found that there was a lot of the spinach and egg mix, so I did 8 mushrooms instead of 4. But it is soooo yummy!

I’ve made this recipe twice. Once with the large caps and once with smaller ones. My large ones seemed to flatten out on me quite a bit as opposed to the smaller ones that kept their shape very well. Tasted amazing both times!

I mixed in some pasta sauce I had on hand and baked each mushroom in a 6" ramekin.  Prepared garlic risotto and served it with them for an entre'.

I switched up the pepperoni & mozzarella for thinly sliced ham & cheddar.  Also added sauted onions & added the garlic & ham to them, removed from heat and then added the spinach to wilt it.  Cooled for a couple of minutes & added the egg mixture & cheddar.

I love this dish.  This is a meal for us.  We are vegetarian so I skipped the peperoni.  Lightly saute the spinach first let cool and then chop.  Also I chop up the stems and gills and used them in the stuffing - no waste.  Add fresh basil if you have some.

I bought the biggest  portubello mushroom caps they had and they here huge and after piling them as high as I can get them there were still a bunch of unused mixture left over. I'm definitely going to make this again but next time I'll used less than half of a bag of spinach. Oh, and I added blue cheese in with the mozzarella/ bread crumbs at the end. Was very tasty.

This was quick and easy and DELICIOUS.   This recipe reminded me very much of how I make oysters Rockefeller and bake them in a oyster shells. This was delicious but I think just for fun I'll try it with a jar of small oysters next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were tasty.  I did use a 10oz box of frozen spinach instead of the fresh(what I had on hand), thawed and drained.  It worked but next time I'll try the fresh.  I also took the advise of the other reviews and left out the extra salt.  True, it didn't need it, enough in the pepperoni and cheese.

This was delicious.  Only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because there was a little too much salt.  I'll adjust a few things next time and it will be perfect.

This is fantastic! I used a little less spinach but made no substitutions. Had leftover "stuffing" and used it with scrambled eggs this morning. This is a keeper!

My hubs said “make again.” I made this as a main dish for 2. I had no fresh spinach so I used thawed frozen, squeezed dry. That was the only change I made in the recipe other than cleaning the mushrooms—for portabella I scrape out the gills prior to cooking, and trim back the center stem to make a slight cavity. The flavor was great, it was just a little dry likely because of the spinach. If I do again I might add something to make the filling a bit saucier.

I sort of combined a couple of recipes. Wiped the mushrooms with Italian dressing. Roasted  gills up for 12 minutes. After resting them I dumped the fluid. I stuffed the mushrooms with spinach, egg, cheese and bread crumbs and continued baking for another 15 minutes. Very tasty.

Family loved it. I added 6 strips of bacon to the mix and used panko break crumbs and added my own Italian spices.  Was very filling and tasted great!

Great recipe and so easy to make.     I omitted pepperoni and used chopped red bell pepper.  I didn’t have Italian dressing so I used olive oil with Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  Excellent!

Made this for the first time tonight! It was the bomb! Will be making this again! I used a little more of the cheeses just because it didn't seem like enough. It was cheesy and yummy! If you plan on having guests for supper you will wow them with this simple recipe!

I used panko as the bread crumbs.   Worked very well.  My guest said we should make this more often.  a 4 star as we though it needed a little ump.  Maybe pepper jack for a little heat.

I made this tonight for dinner. I did not add the pepperoni cause I can't eat any red meat for medical purposes.  My side dish was fresh asparagus (cooked in 1\4 cup butter, 2 fresh squeezed lemons,  2 cloves fresh minced garlic, and three sprigs of dill), and cantaloupe. I highly recommend this dish.

No change is needed as far as the recipe. I will make 1 change and at is to triple the recipe. I didn't come close to having enough. I will definitely make it again and again this was a big hit with the family.

I love this recipe! While this recipe calls for pepperoni I used ground turkey and it was amazing. Like the other reviews said, make sure to wilt you spinach down before you put it on your mushrooms. I mixed mine in with my ground turkey and a little extra cheese.. mmm it was wonderful. Such a delicious recipe!

Other than using a different cheese because I didn't have mozzarella I followed the recipe ... mostly.  I used too much spinach and I didn't chop it first so it was hard to work with but they still turned out great and I will make them again.

I did sub bacon for the pep because I had it in hand and wilted the spinach and garlic in that along with a finely diced Jalapeno. It really did turn out amazing!

What a great recipe!  Delicious.   The only thing I did differently was to add bacon bits instead of pepperoni.  And that was because I didn't have pepperoni in the house but I had everything else.  YUMMY!!!!

OMG, this was amazing!!  I expected these to taste good, but was blown away by how delicious they were.  The only thing I would change is to not add salt.  The pepperoni makes it plenty salty.  Very easy recipe, great directions and the results were fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

After second eating I had to raise my rating from four to five stars. Very tasty! I had baby bellas so I used those and made a big pan using the stuffing over the whole thing. Very easy to make. Great as an entree, side dish or appetizer. Everyone wanted seconds.

We don't eat pork so I used organic, humane certified turkey bacon and turkey pepperoni. I say all that as an encouragement to find meat that is good for the animals as well as people.

Requires breadcrumbs, ugh. 
Set raw spinach on top of sautéed onion to wilt. OR, steam & drain the spinach. Use feta, black olives, sun dried tomatoes, balsamic dressing.

I used only 2 Portobello mushrooms so used 1/2 of the spinach and all of the other ingredients.  I added a few sprinkles of rosemary and 1/2 cup of drained Rotel.

These were alright, nothing wrong with them but also nothing to write home about. I think they're best used as a side dish and omit the pepperoni. Overall, okay stuffed mushrooms but much better than your boring side veggie.

I made as directed with salami instead of pepperoni (preference)  but felt it was still missing something. So for leftovers added fresh basil and more garlic and some sun-dried tomatoes. Serious YUM!

This was a great recipe and the first time I cooked with Portobella  mushrooms caps.  We added some chopped roasted red peppers. Also felt it may be good with feta cheese to give a sharp tang with the richness of the dish.

Loved it, loved it! Used as a starter and they went down very, very well. Added some extra Parmesan piles onto the same baking sheet, which melted and formed tuiles. Stuck them onto the plates, as a decoration. Definitely will be made again, and again!

This is my first review, all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa!

I found these way too salty. It might have been my pepperoni choice though (as I chose a nice butcher brand versus what you might find in a grocery store).  I'm a big experimenter in the kitchen, so i'll definitely make these again, but next time will omit the pepperoni and either go vegetarian with these or choose a less salty meat.

These are awesome.  I bumped it up further by adding some chopped onion, chopped celery and chopped red bell pepper which I zapped for 1 minute in the microwave, and I chopped and wilted the spinach for 1 minute also.  I used chopped salami instead of pepperoni.  Actually I liked this better than Portabella Nirvana on this site.

Great recipe.  Did not have Italian salad dressing so just brushed the mushrooms with olive oil and shook a bit of Italian seasoning on them.  Used Monterey Jack cheese instead of mozzarella.  Great flavor!

I hesitated to review this because 1) I got less than stellar mushrooms at a popular regional grocery store,  2 ) I had no pepperoni, 3) I had only "canned" Parmesan and pre-shredded, bagged mozzarella and 4) I can't put my finger on exactly what's not right about the recipe.  I decided to go ahead and review because we ALL make adjustments/don't have the exact ingredients on hand/etc.  Personally, I'm rarely a stickler for fresh cheeses.  Most recipes that I try turn out just fine with cheese other than fresh, so that's not an issue for me.  The mushrooms that I got were "flat" rather than being pretty and cupped shaped as they should have been.  I used a bit of cooked and crumbled bacon rather than pepperoni.  I couldn't find a 10 oz bag of spinach, so I got a 16 oz bag.  I eye-balled 10 oz, but wound up using the whole 16 oz in the end.  As suggested by other reviewers (and was pretty obvious anyway) I wilted the spinach in a tad of water before adding the other stuffing ingredients.  With the additional spinach, I found that I needed an extra egg.  The end result was disappointing.  The mushrooms weren't as "meaty" as they should have been (maybe because they weren't the greatest to start with).  But overall, this was lack-luster.  Needs something.  Maybe a touch of cayenne?  Maybe a little fat in the stuffing?  (butter/olive oil).   I will try again with better mushrooms and will definitely zip up the stuffing with SOMETHING!!!

It was good. I did not have fresh spinach and that might have made it better as I used frozen.

Did not make any changes to this recipe. Could add some red pepper flacks if you want a little heat. Was really good. Do Portobello's several different ways and this one will be one of our favorite's.

Well, I have to say that I used the recipe as a base and changed a few things.  I cooked a spicy Italian sausage, onions and bell peppers and then added some chopped fresh spinach.  I added those to 1 egg and then added panko crumbs.  I also added 1/3 jar Trader Joes bruschetta sauce and chopped up fresh mozarella  I topped them with fresh parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.  Very delicious!

Very good, but we found the pepperoni a little spicy - it overwhelmed the dish. Perhaps substitute Italian sausage?

This was delicious!! I made it twice in the last two weeks. I'm kind of obsessed! I omitted the Pepperoni and tried it with a couple different salad dressings and it great every time. This recipe is now one of my favorites! Definitely making it several more times! I already have plans to make it for friends and family.

I read the reviews and incorporated a few changes.  We had spicy sausage (delicious) and no pepperoni.  I sautéed onions, garlic and mushroom stems, added spinach to wilt.  Slices of mozz melted beautifully. Honestly, I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but this is as good as it gets. There was so much stuffing I baked some in a ramekin. Delightful.

I bought portobello mushrooms on sale and was looking for a recipe to use them.  I am so glad I tried this recipe - delicous!!  I actually ate 1 mushroom as my lunch; leftovers were just as good after heating up in the microwave.  I did cook 10 minutes longer than stated as my mushrooms were pretty thick/solid.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as stated.

DELICIOUS!  Just made these as an appetizer.  After reading the reviews, I sautéed some finely chopped onion and red pepper.  I added the spinach to the pan to wilt it.  As other reviewers stated, the mushroom caps are very fragile after baking.  I made the stuffing, omitting the egg (didn't  seem to need it).  The edges of my mushroom basically collapsed, so I mounded the stuffing into large balls and placed on top of the caps.  Sprinkled on the cheese and baked.  We loved them!  Was unsure of the pepperoni, but be sure to use it....definitely adds great flavor.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING! I'm a guy who doesn't know a whole lot around the kitchen but found this meal easy and straightforward to make. I substituted the traditional Italian for a balsamic dressing and it really made all the difference in the world. I also used a Pecorino Romano cheese instead of your basic Parmesan and fresh mozzarella in place of your traditional block. I HIGHLY recommend to try this meal. I know that I will again soon!

After having this in my recipe box for a year, I finally made it and all I can say is I wish I had made it sooner. This is a fantastic combination. The saltiness of the pepperoni makes this dish. I used five good-sized portobello's and had a good amount of stuffing left over. I took the leftover stuffing and rolled it together and it made a nice crunchy ball, when baked. Also, I  took the advice of wilting the spinach first and I think it was the right idea. Thanks so much for the recipe and I will be making it again :)

I made one HUGE mushroom for my husband and I to share as a side dish.  It was amazing, and I will definitely be making it again!  It was so quick and easy, I can easily imagine taking smaller mushrooms as an addition to the many potlucks we have during the year!

Delicious!!  Made this pretty much as directed.  As others suggested, I did sauté a little onion in EVOO and then wilted the spinach in the hot pan before mixing it in with the egg mixture.  

Don't leave out the pepperoni!  It really adds a nice flavor.  You just need to use quality pepperoni -- I bought $2 worth of Boar's Head pepperoni from the deli and had enough leftover for a sandwich at lunch the next day.

Served this with warm crusty wheat bread and it was plenty for dinner!  Will definitely be making this again!!

Good dish! I left out the bread crumbs and used olive oil instead of salad dressing. Used real crab meat (obv. most expensive part of the dish). The recipie goes far though -- I stuffed two as much as I could and had a bit left over. Could have easily made 3. Served it with bag salad from the store. Very low carb!

I didn't make any changes whatsoever to this recipe. I made it following the recipe exactly, and he loved it! Last week I made the Thai Panang Chicken from this site and he said this was almost as good as that was. I have to say, so far this site is making me look like a HELL of a cook, thank you!

Good flavor for the spinach filling but I would add chopped onion for a little texture when using mushroom caps. It was also easy to fill a red bell pepper for those that dislike mushrooms and tortilla with left over filling.
My biggest issue was the difficulty of getting enough filling to stay inside the cap.

My first time making portobello. Liked the ingredients. However my porto's produced too much juice in the process of cooking even though I drained them first according to this recipe instructions. So I guess there should be more time to first heat up the mushrooms by themselves in order not to have juicy result which I personally don't find delicious when it mixes with cheese.

I thought it was a gteat recipe.  I used both suggestions from different reviews; turkey baster to remove the juice and frozen spinach vs fresh.  I thought it could use more flavor so I added some crushed reds and another clove of garlic.  I also let the mushrooms rest for 5 to 10 minutes under tin foil just so things could settle down. They were still plenty hot!  We used Jimmy Dean turkey sausage for the protein. I feel the pepperoni or hot italian sausage would have been a better choice.

These were good.  We all enjoyed.  As a vegetarian, I omitted the meat.
Thanks for sharing Jen.

Awesome! Only adjustment was that I pre-cooked the shrooms for longer because they weren't tender enough after 10 minutes.   Hubby & friend said five stars all the way.

Love the recipe, did not add the egg and cheese but it still turned out awesome. Substituted the pepperoni for soy meat crumbles. Get vegan meal.

On our first date (30 years ago) my future husband firmly said - I do not eat mushrooms!  Last night I prepared these and they were a huge hit!  He ate every bite! Just a lesson on good things happen to those who wait (long enough).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and simple - doesn't get any better than that! If you love Portobello mushrooms, you are sure to love this recipe.  I used two large mushrooms and kept all filling ingredients the same, and this was perfect for the main course.

Was looking for something different for meatless Monday and came across this recipe .. The family loved it including the oldest who is not a big spinach lover .. I made a few changes in leaving out the pepperoni, sauteed a little onion with the garlic and spinach in some olive oil, added the breadcrumbs to the egg and then added it to the spinach, garlic and onion mixture .. stuffed the mushroom caps and baked at 350* for about 15 min served with sauteed green beans and sliced cucumbers

This was very good!  Although I used only 1/2 the amount of spinach called for, and had to cook the mushrooms longer than and additional 10 mins, so take this into consideration when you prepare your batch.  I used a combo of spinach and basil and capicola instead of pepperoni, and it came out wonderful!  Better than pizza!

These were easy, but forgettable. Lower calorie and fat than most stuffed mushrooms since no cream cheese.  With the Portobello's we had, these weren't really stuffed - more like spinach piled on top.  Recipe calls for a lot of spinach, had to cook half in a separate dish because it simply wouldn't fit on the mushrooms.

Delicious. I used bacon instead of pepperoni; balsamic dressing instead of Italian; and added green onions to the mix, as well as extra parmesan cheese to top them off. Hearty and tasty.

I didn't have Italian salad dressing in the house, so I substituted olive oil.  I don't think it made too much of a difference.  These were amazing!
