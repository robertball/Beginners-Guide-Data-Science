This is a nice "homey" recipe (even myself and my bf - both of us confirmed mushroom haters!) liked this!  I like the fact that it is a meal-in-one dish.  Be sure to slice your potatoes thin so that they cook all the way through in the alloted amount of time called for, or else your pork chops will be overdone and your potatoes won't be completely cooked.  I seasoned my chops with seasoned salt in lieu of table salt to add more flavor (I didn't pre measure the salt, pepper or garlic powder either - just seasoned to taste).  I also added some minced garlic from a jar to the soup mixture and shredded cheddar cheese to cover the casserole.  This is similar to the pork chop and potato casserole recipe by Wendy on this site (hence the idea for adding cheese).  The pork chops go well with green beans or a tossed salad and dinner rolls on the side.  A cold glass of milk completes the meal!  This one's a definite keeper : ) Thanks!

My family really liked this one. I did use boneless chops and two cans of mushroom soup to one can of milk and used frozen O'brien hash browns to save time which worked better than I thought it would. All in all it was tasty and quick to put together for a busy mother of five.

Delicious tender pork, creamy flavorful potatoes -- this recipe is a real keeper! The directions "until potatoes are tender" are important -- my potatoes weren't done at 60 minutes of baking, but they turned out perfectly with 20 more minutes in the oven.

Overall, easy and good.  I thought 2 large onions would be too much, so I used 1 onion and 1 garlic clove.  Also, left out the potatoes because I served with mashed potatoes (great gravy!) While baking, I left the dish covered for an hour; uncovered it and cooked 10 more minutes.  Very tender this way!

Fabulous doesn't begin to describe this recipe!! I make it at least once a week. I am not that great of a cook so my husband was pleasantly surprised when he came home to dinner to this the first time! He went on and on about how good it was! I am so thrilled to have this recipe, I'm sure it will be in our family for years to come! I wish I'd had this before. I did add some cajun seasoning to the meat. It just adds a little zing to the pork. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and I love it! In fact, I just got done making it again! Thanks so much, J Hilgenberg for sharing this!

Wonderful!  I baked them for an hour, but ended up having to put the dish in the microwave because the pork still wasn't done, and the potatoes weren't tender.  To cut down on the fat, I used only 1 Tbl. butter (turned out fine!).  I also used only 1 onion, and it was plenty!  I didn't bother measuring the seasonings - just sprinkled all 3 on both sides of the meat.  Next time, I may try adding another can of soup, as others suggested, to make it thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok. It needs a lot more seasoning than called for, or maybe more soup. The potatos came out fine without extra cooking as I sliced them extra thin. I'd like to try this again, but I'm going to have to figure out how to zing up the sauce.

Very good recipe. I sliced the potatoes very thinly, and flipped them over halfway through cooking, some were still a bit crunchy but fine. I reduced the amount of onions, and potatoes since I only had 4 chops (had more sauce because of this which was great). Next time I will add chopped mushrooms. 

Even better if you sprinkle parmesan cheese on top before serving.

This was a great one dish meal. The end result was plenty salty so taste before you salt at the table. I really loved the potatoes and the meat was very tender. All you need is a green veggie and maybe some bread to help sop up the gravy and you have a filling and easy meal. Thank you for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe  as written, but by following some reviewers' suggestions, it becomes a full-fledged 5 star delight!  I also used two cans of soup, and added a 1l2 pound of sliced button mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onions, and a clove of minced garlic.  As I was running behind schedule, I was encouraged by the reviewer who mentioned successfully using a package of frozen O'Brien potatoes.  I had a package of cubed potatoes and diced onions that I had been saving for "emergencies."  They also worked very well.  Finally, the raves of my husband, who went back for seconds, convinced me that this was a real "keeper" -- easy, delicious, and the pork chops were wonderfully tender.

I am giving this five stars because I loved it. My husband is old school when it comes to pork chops; he believes the only way to enjoy them is seasoned with salt and pepper, fried, and slightly dry. We will agree to disagree and I will continue to make this recipe and he can kill pork chops when it is his turn to cook.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it came out really good! I saw some of the pictures people put up and their gravy looked white and unappetizing. To add color, I used golden mushroom soup instead of the one called for in the recipe. I made sure that when cooking the pork chops in the skillet that one side was really browned and golden and made that "face up" in the baking dish. I also used white wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the pork chops to add flavor and color to the gravy. The soup and deglazing added such a pretty and appetizing color to the gravy! I sliced my potatoes very thin and it still took an hour, so keep checking your potatoes to make sure they're done. With my own tweaks, this recipe was so good and simple! :) Def. a yummy keeper! :)

OMG!  This was good.  I made a few small changes like adding fresh mushrooms, sliced, with the onions.  Then I added 1/3 cup of sour cream for 1/3 cup of milk.  The pork chops came out so tender and tasty and the potatoes were great.  Since there are only two of us, I cooked three pork chops and made the entire portion of the sauce recipe.  I also used a pork chop spice blend which is always good.

made this last night for dinner and everyone in my family loved it - especially the gravy, onion and potato part. i did add creole seasoning to the pork chops just to give it a little zing. i bet this would be good with chicken as well.

So Yummy - I rubbed the chops in Lipton Onion soup mix and then browned them. The onion enhanced the mushroom sauce making this recipe very very tasty!

I got this recipe in my inbox this morning and was excited. I made it for dinner tonight and it was a huge success. It's so easy and very yummy! The hardest thing with this dish is the wait. I did 2 things differently: I used Half-and-Half for a thicker gravy, and added a splash of white wine to help tenderize the pork during baking. Lovely results. Will definitely fix this again. Thank you! :)

This is tasty but having made it exactly to the recipe, there are a couple of things I would change if i were going to make it again. The sauce was very watery when it was done, so I woud use about half as much milk. I also would add some sauted mushrooms next time, and I would whisk the milk and soup together before mixing it into the onions.

THese are wonderful! I do dip them in egg, flour, and italian bread crumbs before frying. Then I follow the rest of the recipe and bake them. Very very good.

This was a very tasty recipe, but slightly too rich for me.  My husband, however, really liked it and he doesn't generally like mushroom soap recipes.  Hence, the five stars.  I did substitute olive oil for the butter. The pork chops had a fantastic flavor, but I did add more spices (onion powder and Italian seasoning).  I did have to cook the dish for about 15 minutes longer so the potatoes were done, but the pork chops were still very tender.  The sauteed onions were a perfect touch.  Next time I will probably try adding thinly sliced carrots to the potatoes, and mushrooms to the sauce.  The possibilities for add-ins are endless.  As you can tell, I'm making this one again, but may play with the sauce so it isn't so rich.

3 to 4 tablespoons of fresh drippings from a 5-star brand BACON in the skillet is perfect for browning BONELESS pork chops and PAM is great for use in the oven pan. No potatoes? No problem: I used one can each of Cream of Mushroom AND Cream of Potato; another excellent call!  Double or triple the sauce and you can use Angel hair pasta, regular spaghetti or your favorite pasta shell types. When using BONELESS pork chops--watch your time / temperatures; the result should produce impressively tender chops that do come out tasting like a fine restaurant dish!

Very tasty.  Made it my own by slicing onion in rings instead of chopped.  Added paprika to salt, pepper, garlic rub.   In the soup mixture I doubled the soup, added a sprinkle of cayane pepper and added about 1/4 C heavy cream.  In a baking dish I put the cooked onion rings, then chops, then soup mix and cooked covered for 30 mins.  Served over rice.  Good and satisfying.

Made this almost exactly as stated (added second can of soup per previous reviews, and only had one onion).  Excellent!  Chops were so tender, potatoes perfect after stated cooking time, gravy was excellent.  Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was quite good.  I sliced potatoes quite thin, and baked them about 20 min. before adding pork chops and finishing baking.  They still were not overly done.  Used the low salt-low fat version of mushroom soup, and that really diminished the overall flavor and quality of the dish, I think.  Think this recipe has lots of potential.  Will try it again using regular mushroom soup.

Delicious! A tasty, filling meal perfect for winter. I seasoned the chops with pepper & season salt, doubled the soup, sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions, and served it with french cut green beans.  Plan on 1 1/2- 2 hours cook time, the potatoes were still raw after the first hour. Next time I may try baking the potatoes by themselves while I prep the chops and sauce, that way I'm not waiting an extra hour to serve.

Great recipe!  I added sliced fresh mushrooms to the onions; my only modification was to par-boil the potatoes, peel and then slice.  Since I was using boneless center cut chops, I wanted to ensure the potatoes were done.  Actually, the same amount of cooking time was necessary since the chops were pretty thick.  I'll be making this again and again!

This recipe is a great idea for putting a quick meal together, but even after using roasted garlic mushroom soup, I found it a little bland.  I will jazz this up with more seasonings and play around with it next time and it will be great!

Served this on steamed brown rice instead of potatoes. Loved the flavor; pork was tender. My wife ate a full pork chop plus the rice which is quite a statement of enjoying it.

Great recipe. I added mushrooms when browning the opions and sliced 2 potatoes pretty thinly. Only had 4 chops, but cooked perfectly with the amount of time stated. When taking the cover off @ 30 minutes, I added Sri-Racha (the Roosta' sauce!) and left uncovered for another half hour. Easy recipe, tastes great! I wouldn't add salt (as stated by others too.)

The sauce was a little too thin for our liking. I think the next time I try this I will use half the amount of milk.

I did this in my electric frying pan, rather than in the oven which reduced the cook time by about 20 minutes.  I also used 1 cup of chicken stock and 1/4 cup of milk rather than all milk.  I think this added me flavor.

I didn't have potatoes so I just baked the chops. Yum! Super easy, fast, yet tastes like I had time to fuss with it.

I followed this recipe exactly and both my husband and I really liked it.  The only thing was that the cooking time was not long enough for the potatoes even though I made sure to slice them thin.  I had to bake another half hour (covered, so that it would not dry out) and it turned out great!  Will make again.

This was great!  The only thing I did different was I cut the pork chops into long strips, to stretch the dish out longer.  I'm new to cooking and it took me much longer than the posted 20 minute prep time, but it was worth it!

I have cooked this recipe for years and it turns out great every time.  Try mixing a can of cream of celery soup with the cream of mushroom, it adds a nice addition to the flavor.  Top the dish with shredded cheddar cheese and put it back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  Pork chops will be very tender and moist.

As is, this was only ok ~ our family found it pretty bland and the "sauce" is pretty thin and dull.  Eating the potatoes all by themselves required extra S&P for any taste at all.  We pre-cooked the potatoes 10 min in microwave first, which worked great.  An easy recipe with a nice base, but will need some spice additions to make this more of a memorable dinner.

OM Gosh, this is so good and fast to make. As usual I tried a few suggestions other reviewers made.  I had a large package of pork tenderloins.  I used 2 cans of cream om soup, about a cup of white wine, was I ever scared before the alcohol cooked out, the flavor was so strong of alcohol. ( I am new at cooking with wine) 2 tsp of minced garlic, a bit of milk and a couple of dollops of sour cream.  I cook to taste.  I heated this on the stove before adding it to the other ingredients.  I used my food processor to slice the unpealed potatoes and the onion.  Everything went so fast, except browning the chops.  It turned out so nice, the browning bits of the meat combined with the soup mixture gave it such a rich flavor.  I too cooked mine for about 1hr 20 mins in a 9x13 pan.  We all loved it and I think this will be the go to chop recipe from now on.  A meal in one, with some green beans on the side. Awesome !!!

Really easy/quick to make. Would either decrease the amount of milk added, or increase the amount of soup. Found the sauce to be quite runny. Potatoes were sliced thinly as suggested and cooked perfectly within the hour. Would definitely make again.

My boyfriend and son LOVE this. I don't really like pork chops all that much.

My friend from Iowa says this is middle America food at it's finest. For the men in my life this is most certainly the way to their heart.

I use a clove of fresh garlic and the pork is from a local farm where the pig was raised with love.

This recipe tasted much too onion-y for my husband and me.  We could only taste the onions.  It's also very high in sodium.  We omitted the salt since the soup is quite salty by itself.  We may try it again with much less onion and we will add some fresh garlic.

My family loved them! I never cook pork and my 6 yr old told me he wanted pork chops :) I didn't have a problem with the potatoes as previous reviews had. Only thing i will do differently next time is add mushrooms to soup and add shred chedd during last few mins of cooking. Thank you so much for posting the recipe. Deff a keeper!!

This was very good.  I too added another can of cream of mushroom soup and instead of the 2 large onions (neither my boyfriend or I are crazy about onions), I added about half an envelope of onion soup mix.  I sliced the potatoes as thinly as I could and cooked it for about an hour and 20 minutes but some of them were still not quite done.  So next time I will either boil them a little bit first or skip that part altogether and serve the pork chops with some mashed potatoes or wild rice.  The gravy was awesome!  I will make again!  Thanks!!

This was really good, but I did make a couple of changes.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can golden mushroom soup.  I only used about 1/2 soupcan of milk and added some mushrooms to the onion saute.  Hubby really liked it.

This was super easy! I sliced the potatoes very thin and had no trouble getting everything cooked to a perfect "doneness". =). I will make several changes next time...less onion..and I will thicken the sauce, just a bit. Maybe add a few fresh mushrooms in? Would go very nice with asparagus or green beans.

I have always loved this recipe. I personally add extra mushrooms, pepper and a daulup of sour cream on each dish. Browned potato slices already cooked may be an advantage to add at the end of the bake time also. As during cooking some of them stick to the bottom of the dish and disintegrated while stirring. Also cook for 1 hour...

Yum! I sauteed crushed garlic with the onion and I didn't have potatoes so I didn't do that part & likewise only baked it for 1/2 hour. Otherwise, I kept it the same and we loved it:)

This has become a staple in my house.  I always add extra mushrooms to the soup mixture right before it gets poured over the pork chops.

This is a great one dish meal! I used 5 thin sliced chops, 1 onion,and 2 cans of soup. I also used morton's seasoning blend to rub on the chops. An oblong 2 qt. casserole dish worked well for this.I baked 45 mins. covered and 15uncovered.Next time I think I will use golden mushroom soup for a little more color.VERY TASTY!!!

I just finished serving this meal to my fiance.  He loved it.  I didn't have any problems with the potatoes not being cooked.  My youngest niece is the official taste tester and she loved it. I will definately be making this again and again.

This was pretty good.   Next time I would par-boil & season the potatoes prior to placing them in the casserole. I would also use a 13X9 Glass casserole (I used a 2 Qt casserole) so the potatoes might cook and brown better.  I had to cook for 1.5 hours for the potatoes to be cooked thoroughly. The flavor was really good, I also used crushed garlic rather than garlic salt.  Delicious and family ate it all up.

I have made this dish several times and never wrote a review.
I guess I assumed that I did!
This is a great recipe. I actually have it in the oven as I am
writing this. The only addition was ground thyme, which I like with pork, and parsley. I used thinly sliced red potatoes this time.
After dinner update: The red potatoes, with the skin on, worked very well. I didn't have to par-cook as the white potatoes. I will use these from now on.

I made this quick and easy go to pork chop recipe.  It very tasty, and I like the way the milk and soup are cooked together. I always leave out the potatoes.  Tonight for example, we had these pork chops with linguine. It makes a fantastic creamy sauce.

When my husband and I were first married I made this recipe all the time.  Now 20 years later I am preparing it again!  I didn't use the potatoes and made it with rice instead.  I used 1 onion instead of two and two cans of soup instead of one. I also reduced the amount of milk.  I browned the boneless pork chops and sauteed the onions with fresh mushrooms and added garlic and pepper (no salt).  I lowered the cooking temperature to 250 and cooked for two hours (because I had the time available).  The pork chops came out extremely tender and both my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful meal. It brought back memories to when we were newlyweds.

Good comfort food, added my own twist to make it more to my liking.  Added some sliced mushrooms to the onion sautee.  Seasoned the soup and milk with fresh ground pepper and some ground sage. When uncovered, sprinkled the top with more sliced mushroom.  Didn't cook on potatoes but served with rice.

I skipped the browning step because I was concerned about overcooking my chops. Alternated layers of thin sliced potatoes and red onions, seasoning each layer with pepper and a little seasoned salt, with chopped garlic and sliced mushrooms on the last layer. Then I rubbed the chops with a small amount of seasoned salt, dried sage and pepper, and placed them on top. I wanted a creamier sauce so I used 3/4 cup half and half in place of milk, just whisked it together with the mushroom soup and poured over everything. After one hour the potatoes were PERFECT but unfortunately my bone-in pork chops were still too overcooked and dry for us. Next time I would give the potatoes a head start and add the chops in the last 30 minutes. The potatoes were SO GOOD, the BF said it is even worth making without any chops at all.

Excellent, simple recipe that reminded me of home! The pork chops were incredibly tender, so much so that I didn't even need my knife! 

I made very minimal changes to this recipe... I used pepper and Garlic Plus as my rub, left out the salt. And since I only had 4 pork chops, used only 1 cup of milk, which worked great! I used bone-in chops and instead of using potatoes I cooked basmati rice separtely. I cooked the chops for 50 mins covered and 10 uncovered which likely helped them get so tender!

I served the chops and sauce over a bed of rice, with steamed broccoli. It was a hit!

I don't normally like pork chops unless they are grilled, but I have to say that this recipe was so amazing that I can't help but rave to everyone that they need to make it! I grew up eating pork chops that always tasted like leather, but I used thin cut boneless pork chops and I deleted onions but used onion powder to season and the chops came out absolutely tender and juicy!

Not bad at all.  I agree with others reviewers the potatoes need to bake a bit longer. In fact, I put the potatoes in the oven topped w/ shredded cheese for about 30 minutes prior to adding the pork chops and sauce. Then used the suggested bake times. This was good.

This is delicious and a wonderful recipe.  I am new to pork, but I always add chardonnay in any mushroom sauce I make.  I noticed a few reviews said the sauce was bland and my advice IN GENERAL for sauce is to put a little extra liquid (milk in this case), a little parsley and basil and some chardonnay to taste (roughly 1/4-1/2 cup, try 1/4 first), cover on low for about 10-15 to let the flavors mix then take the top off and allow to cook down for a few more minutes.  You always want to spend a little extra time on your sauce.  it pays off in the end

Very good & tasty! I used boneless pork chops and frozen hash browns.  I par cooked the hash browns in the microwave for 5 - 10 minutes to cut down on the hour cooking time in the oven.  My kids aren't big mushroom fans and if it wasn't for the chunks of mushrooms in the soup, they never would've known!  Tasty & a time saver - a win-win situation!

I have been searching for a good pork chop recipe for quite some time.  Have tried several from this site and they just didn't wow me.  Well, I just made this recipe and this is a keeper beyond all keepers.  Extremely tasty.  Little bit more work than I like due to the browning of the chops and the onion but, it is totally worth it.

This was very good and farely easy to throw together.  What I loved is that I already had the ingredients on hand.  Although, I didn't have cream of mushroom for some reason so I used cream of potato and that was very tasty.

This was very good. A down-home style dish. I made two small changes: substituted 1/3 cup sour cream for the milk and skipped the potatoes, preparing mashed potatoes as a side dish instead. This recipe made plenty of gravy, which as excellent on the mashed potatoes. This will definitely stay in my recipe box.

We just finished this. It was a big hit....I served it over a choice of egg wide noodles...or white rice. It was greatl. Next time I will definetely add another can of soup. I used a family size can with 5 large chops and the gravy didn't really stretch. My husband doesnt like mushrooms but he loved this!

Great! My husband loved this dish! Very easy to make, I assembled everything in the morning and baked for dinner. I sliced the potatoes very thin and even then they were not done, I had to bake covered for an additional 45 minutes.

Delicious! I substituted olive oil for the butter when frying the pork chops. Added Lawry's season salt to the chops and only used one onion. Everything else made per the recipe. The potatoes tasted just like my mom's homemade scallop potatoes. Will definitely make again.

With potatoes sliced 1/4 inch thick, everything was done. May add sliced mushrooms next time.

I thought this was good! After reading prior reviews for ideas I did the following: Sliced potatoes thin on mandolin, layered in prepared dish, & microwaved for 6min on 70%, stirring after every 3 min, to help start them cooking.  While they were cooking I prepared boneless pork chops, trimming all fat possible, cut in half (were 1.5-2" thick), rubbed garlic powder, black pepper & rubbed (or ground) sage on both sides (no salt) before browning.  I used Cr of Mushroom w/ Roasted Garlic Soup (extra flavor!) & only about 2/3-3/4 soup can of milk for the sauce.  I cooked the dish 30min covered & 15min uncovered before testing the meat & potatoes.  Since they were now thin chops & boneless I was leery of the cook times noted.  The dish was done, potatoes were great, sauce yummy (not watery or oily), but chops were a tad overcooked.  Will try again with maybe 20min covered & 15min uncovered then work up from there if need be.

I liked this better after adding some modifications.  I used sweet mesquite rub (Costco brand) on the chops instead of any of the spices in this recipe.  Instead of using potatoes, I used frozen hash browns. Cuts the work in half.  I also add more sweet mesquite rub to the milk/soup concoction while it's in the skillet.  My husband hated it the first time I made it, saying it didn't taste like anything, but with the modifications he loves it and it saves me a lot of time.  Thanks!

As most have commented,this does need some extra herbs and such. I went to my herb garden and picked some rosemary and parsley, chopped it up fine and sauteed them with spring onion, celery, garlic powder, season salt, fresh ground pepper and paprika. Then I poured the mixture into the soup and stirred till mixed and then poured over the chops and potatoes. At the very end, I added one half cup Marcella wine and one half cup beef stock. I have been making this for years and it is great.

Perfect comfort food for a southern gal. I used two cans of mushroom soup and cut the onion down to one.  In addition I tenderized the pork chops making them thinner.  I baked them longer then recommended and the outcome was great.  Very tender!

The chops and sauce were delicious, but I probably wouldn't do the potatoes that way again. I will make it again though without the spuds.  Thanks for the recipe. I would have never considered mushrooms and pork, but it was really good.

This was GREAT! it's now become a regular dish in my home. I did a few things diff. I minced some garlic and pread it over the potatoes, and i left out the milk and the onions, just heated up the mushroom soup and poured it over the browned chops and potatoes. it's a wonderful dish. Thanks!

This recipe was very good.  I was really leary of using this recipe, but I had pork chops to use up and wanted to try something different.  I didn't have any onions, so instead I used Lipton Onion Soup?  It really turned out good.  My whole family loved it.  I will definetly use this recipe again.  Thanks

This is what I would refer to as soul food... 
I made this recipe with 4 boneless, organic chops and red potatoes (those thin-skinned  ones that taste slightly "sweeter"). As long as you make sure to slice the potatoes thin enough so they will cook properly, this recipe is idiot-proof! (as demonstrated by me being able to make it, lol) 
I am a relatively slim guy that usually doesn't go back for seconds (or thirds) unless I am *really* impressed. This dish  so good that I not only ran to grab another chop, I almost took a 3rd one! Such an awesome thing to make on a chilly fall or winter night... yummm!

Good. Pork stayed moist even though I had to bake 20 minutes longer than noted because of the potatoes taking their sweet time cooking. Next time I will slice them thinner with a mandolin.

I thought this was an OK recipe. I found it to be pretty bland. The pork chops were very tender. I used a food processor to slice my potatoes and they were done. It just was missing some seasonings and I don't know what to add. I probably won't make it again.

Very easy - love that the ingredient list consists of everyday normal items.  I replaced 1/2 of the milk with white wine and it gave the sauce a nice tangy taste!  I also used low-fat soup and milk but the sauce tasted very rich and creamy!  I will make this again soon!

I'm a 19 year old just learing to cook. I found this was it was fantastic. I didn't bother to measure out the spices, but added until I was satisfied. The potatoes were cooked completely after one hour without a problem. This was the first time making porkchops and there is no doubt- I will most definently  be cooking this again.

I give it 4.5 stars actually. My husband like it and I added more seasoning to the soup mixture as noted before. I had no problems with the potatoes cooking fully within the alotted time. I used boneless pork chops and it was all pretty good.

YUMMY!  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I also used Campbells "CREAM OF MUSHROOM WITH ROASTED GARLIC" soup for extra flavor and added mushrooms.  I will also try this recipe on chicken cutlets.  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe!

About a month ago I decided to cook my pork chops a different way (finally got tired of the same old thing). I came across several interesting recipes and finally settled on this one. What a hit! My picky boys even liked it and let me tell you that in itself is an accolade. When it came time to make chops again I decided that I couldn't pass up this recipe again. When I make it I use boneless pork chops to make things just a little easier. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I really liked this recipe!  One thing I did differently was I substituted a bag of presliced/partially precooked Simply Potatoes instead of using fresh potatoes.  That took care of the uncooked potatoes other mentioned previously.  The flavor of the potatoes with the onion/mushroom soup sauce is awesome!!  

If I was making this for 6 people, I would definitely double the potato part - that way there would be plenty for seconds and thirds.

For those who have a problem with high sodium, I would consider using the lower sodium soup.  I had no problem with the sodium but I can see how some might.  

I definitely will make this again and again.

I read all the reviews first. Nervous about my oven pototoe cooking (see the review on Yuck, pototoes were not cooked). I Par-boiled the pototoes, works like a champ! My other half does not like casseroles so I told him I made oven baked pork chops and scalloped pototoes. He loved the dinner!! He loves browned onions and it was delious so for me the more the merrier. This is a very simple and good receipe and you should try it.

Husband really liked this. I love that it’s a 1 pot meal. I just did asparagus and a roll for a complete meal. Very homey. It’s going into the rotation. Sauce is awesome. The chops got slightly dry. I think I will reduce the last 3 min cooking time and make the potatoes even thinner. Thank you for great recipe!

Made with boneless chops. Left onions out because no one in my family likes them except me. Dinner fed 3, got rave reviews and there were plenty of leftovers. Would make again!

LOVED IT!!! My wife however did not, she's not a pork fan. But she did like the potatoes. I used red potatoes instead of brown, making sure they were thin sliced. I used an extra can of the cream of mushroom soup with a little extra milk to add more sauce. I put it in for the allotted time, and added a thin layer of french fried onions putting it back in for another 5 minutes. Those added even more flavor to it. All of it was cooked PERFECTLY!!! Will definitely be making it again.

I just made this! Very impressed! I used red potatoes and they came out well cooked and lovely tasting.
Wished I would have had fresh Parsley to top it off.
I also added fresh sliced mushrooms while frying up the onions.
As for spices, I used garlic salt, season salt & pepper.
Also added more s&p to the potatos before placing in the oven.
Great dish and will make over and over again!

I thought this was delicious.  I did make some alterations...  I didn't have garlic powder, garlic and pork aren't great together either, so I used Adobo seasoning with pepper instead of the garlic, salt and pepper.  I used half n half instead of milk, it makes it creamier.  I added quartered button mushrooms to the onions while sautéing.  I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the soup/onion mixture before putting it over the potatoes and chops, this made the potatoes a LOT like a mushroom au gratin and they were fantastic.

My husband raved over this and said it was a keeper.  Very easy to make. Instead of plain salt, I seasoned the chops with Applewood Bacon Salt from Beyond The Shaker, which added some unique flavor to the dish.  I also sautéed fresh sliced mushrooms with the onions.  Fresh steamed green beans served as a side perfectly complimented this dish.

This was perfect! I did change the cream of mushroom and instead used cream of chicken and mushroom. I also used two cans instead of one. This made approximately 8-9 pork chops. I kept everything else the same. Great quick and easy dinner!

Have made this several times but no matter what I do something just seems to be missing in the flavour when made as recipe states. My sister made it and added a beef billion cube and it added some zest. Also, no matter how thin the potato slices are, they just do not cook completely all the way through. Frustrating recipe for me anyway.

This is a good recipe if you spice it up. I pan seared my pork chops with a generous amount of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning rubbed into them. I added a little chicken stock into the scrapings, then added sliced portabella mushrooms and onions for the cream of mushroom sauce. It is very very important to parboil the sliced potatoes before placing in the bottom of the casserole. Otherwise they will be crunchy no matter how thin you slice them. Moist and juicy.

Loved this recipe - easy to make and delicous - I added the extra can of mushroom soup and had sliced potatoes that are already cooked so thought this would cut down on the cooking time.  It worked out great - My family loved it -

Followed recipe exactly, except added asparagus spears in place of potatoes to make this more nutritious.

Pork was very tender when the  baking was finished, so that means accurate bake time was specified.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it came out wonderfully. I did have to extend the cooking time an extra 20 min to make sure the potatoes were cooked thru and I added some extra milk so there was enough sauce to cover the entire casserole dish.

Think twice before using two onions!  We made this dish, and it really did not meet our expectations.  It had way too many onions in it.  The potatoes still came out crunchy despite trying to cook for a longer time.  Not a recipe that we will make again.

Very easy recipe that my husband and I really enjoyed. We used extra mushrooms, fresh garlic cloves, and added a serano pepper for spice. Will make again!

My husband and I loved this recipe. True comfort food! I used red potatoes that I peeled and cut with a waffle cutter to give it a little something extra. :) Quick, easy and oh so delicious!

Fell in love with this recipe. Cooks really tender. I like to deep fry the porkchop in lots of batter and then bake it in the cream of mushroom sauce

Very Good recipe.  I used Jamaican rub on the pork chops and also used 1 can mushrooms nalong with other ingredients. Cooked for 60 minutes covered, last 10 minutes uncovered and topped with French fried onions.

I used one onion instead of two because that's all I had, I also added fresh sliced mushrooms and served it with fettuccine noodles (husband is a pasta man) I, on the other hand had it with rice, either way it was a YUMMY recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I used a reduced sodium cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom because husband doesn't like mushrooms. Also, I didn't bother to saute the onions, just put them in raw. I sliced the potatoes using the food processor along with the onions and I baked in a 13x9 deep throw-away foil pan for 2 hours. Wow! Easy and yummy. This is going into the regular rotation.

This is a great recipe.  Easy and very tasty.  I will spice it up a little more and add some garlic the next time I make it.  I made it for 2 people and will add more soup and milk.  A nice everyday meal.

I made this last night to wonderful reviews.  I did however, change a few things...I used sweet potatoes instead, sweet onions sliced vs chopped and carmelized, eliminated the butter (used cooking spray instead), added thickly sliced mushrooms (sauteed first to eliminate some water) and added another can of mushroom soup.  The dish was a hit.  My husband commented that we could even eliminate the potatoes and it would be just as great.

I followed other reviewers and doubled the soup and only added 1 can of milk...sauce was a good consistency but lacked flavor in my opinion. Denny said it reminded him of scalloped potatoes; the potatoes took a long time to cook. I cooked the whole thing in a 2quart casserole and it overflowed; I cooked it 1 hour covered and 1 hour uncovered - by then the small boneless chops I made were dried out. Not a hit for me.

Delicious! I would deffinatly make this dish again. My family loved it! I didn't make any major changes, but I did cut the recipe in half (only used 3 pork chops instead of 6) I also baked it in an 2 quart, deeper round cassarole dish seeing as though I don't have a 9X13.  Turned out probably a little more watery then it would have been otherwise but it was still flavorful. Make sure you cut potatoes thin enough so they're done i the elloted amount of time. It would be good with added mushrooms!

This recipe is scrumptious.  Definitely not bland with freshly ground pepper.  Made no major changes.  I shook some salt & all pepper & onion powder on chops before frying so cut down on a lot of salt.  I sliced the onions because they look better when browned.  I added 1/4 lb. fresh sliced mushrooms to onions just before they finished cooking. I used 10" square corningware dish and put dry layered sliced potatoes into oven (covered) while I browned onions and chops.  The soup and milk I mixed together and heated it with onion mixture until boiling so part of total cooking time was not needed to heat up the sauce.  I removed top 2 layers of potatoes and put a bit of sauce between & then finished as instructed. 1 hour total cooking time was sufficient.  Will definitely make again.

Loved it!  My husband ate two huge helpings and complimented me constantly.  :-)  it's a new family favorite for pork chops.  But for anyone making it for the first time be sure to allow plenty of cook time.  I made it for 8 and it took 1 1/2 hours to bake the potatoes but the sauce keeps the pork chops super juicy so once it was done you have a pretty delicious dish.

Good recipe.  I had fresh mushrooms that had to be cooked so I added them in with the onions to saute.  I used thin pork chops which were okay but a tad dry.  Next time I'm going to use thicker chops.

We love it I cooked the onions with the pork steak during browning. I added more garlic and butter than called for turned out great and will be making this often. Thank you so very much it is amazing what garlic and onions can do to the soup.

I didn't alter this recipe one bit and I LOVED it! Even my daughter liked it and she is super picky. There is a lot of extra "sauce" left over at the end but we poured a bit over our pork chops after we scooped the potato out. It was delicious! The potatoes cooked just fine for me but I used a glazed cast iron baking dish.

This was really good not the best most amazing recipe but good. I followed the directions and added a few pinches of dried parsely to the top. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves this!!! Another one that made the cookbook. I was very impressed with the flavor and the tenderness of the meat. I did only use 4 pork chops, since there's only four of us, and I added another small can of cream of mushroom because I love that stuff, I also used new potatoes....which were also great. I saved the excess "sauce" because the kids liked it so much and thought I might use it for something else.

This is a quick easy meal that my family loves. I use new (white) potatoes instead on russet potatoes.

This dish had a great flavor and the chops were very juicy.I added about a teaspoon of oragono and some dried parsley. I think that next time I make this I will probably half the milk because it came out very runny. Overall I really enjoyed this recipe.

I also doctored it a little.  Sauteed garlic and mushrooms with the onion, and deglazed with white wine.  I skipped the potatoes - we're watching carbs.  A really good recipe.  Thanks JHIGENB.

This was good. I doctored it up a little. I added some mozzarella cheese on top, I used reduced fat mushroom soup, skim milk, added more garlic powder, and I used mashed potatoes instead. The sauce made a wonderful gravy. I used thin lean cut pork chops, so I would suggest 30 mins covered and maybe 10 mins uncovered, maybe less.

These were really easy and I had everything on hand to fix them. After eating this though we all agreed we prefer smothered pork chops over rice instead of potatoes. Mine came out a little soupy but my hubby forgot to uncover them when the timer went off so I think that's why. This was a little bland overall, but not bad.

I was totally disappointed with this dish.  The chops were tough and tasteless.  My potatoes turned out perfect because I sliced them real fine and put in the micro for five minutes.  I added green beans to make a one dish meal, but I ended up throwing most of it away.  My husband who will eat anything didn't finish his dinner.  The concept is good but definitely needs work.  Will not be making again.

Made this 2 nites in a row (cooking for 2), one w/pork sirloin "steaks", one w/chicken. Only change I made: Omitted salt and mixed pepper/garlic powder in flour to dredge meat prior to frying. Similar to using a roux, this helped to keep gravy thicker. Baked covered for 45 minutes, uncovered for 20. VERY VERY tasty, meats were tender and jusicy, quick enough to prepare on a weeknite. Hubbie liked chicken more than the pork, but thought the pork was great, too! Highly recommend sticking to the basics of the recipe and avoid trying to "tweak" before trying the recipe as is!!

So good and so easy. The chops were tender and an hour was great. I gave it 4 stars because without adding garlic and seasoning salt- and some other spices- it would have been too bland. But other than that, it was good and I'll make it again.

Wow.  Was this good!  I had to make a couple of substitions, due to what I had on hand, ie a box of turkey gravy for the mushroom soup...I added in some shitakes. Taking advice of other reviewers, after rubbing the meat with salt and pepper, I dredged it in flour mixed with Italian seasoning, garlic powder and paprika before I browned it. I added a couple of garlic cloves after the onions were almost browned.  I also threw in some celery I wanted to use up before it went bad. I let it simmer a bit to make it thicker. This was soooooo tasty! Served it over rice,  Excellent! Oh, I also boiled and simmered the potato slices for five minutes before putting them in the casserole dish.  I like my potatoes cooked through.  You could probably nuke them for two minutes and get the same effect.  Truly yummy comfort food.

This was a great dish! I usually prefer spicy dishes but my husband can't take too much spice so I try very hard to find flavorful dishes that are not spicy. I thought this recipe would be ok and my husband would like it but it turns out we both LOVED it! This will stay in my recipe box!

i added some more spices besides the salt, pepper, garlic powder. i added italian seasoning. after i browned the pork chops i added rosemary and oregano like what others have suggested. i didnt want the chops to come out lacking in flavor.i added shredded cheddar cheese on the sliced potatoes then the pork chops. followed everything else. had to cook another 30 minutes then the usual hour it stated for the potatoes were not done yet. overall it was a tasty dish. the chops had a lot of flavor.

I loved this recipe!  I had leftover cooked pork from New Year's day, which I chopped into bite size pieces.  I baked the potatoes for 20 minutes before adding the pork and sauce to finish the recipe.  My family loved it, seconds all around!

Instead of milk I used a combination of leftover heavy cream and evaporated skim milk. It was quite good. My husband loved it and a daughter that generally doesn't like pork said she liked it as well.

I followed the directions, except I used frozen shredded hash brown potatoes - thawed!  It was absolutely delicious, everyone loved it, except me!  Actually, the pork chops is what I didn't like!!!  I have grown away from eating them and it just didn't hit it for me.  Will definitely make again except using boneless chicken!  Thanks for such a comforting meal!

Okay, made these according to directions...and i only have 1 irk that led to me making this 4 stars...everything was very good and tender, but if you very thinly slice the potatoes, so that they cook all the way...they actually start to fall apart into the sauce...which tasted DELICIOUS...BUT i look for recipes for my potato loving husband that i can pick/pull the potatoes out of for my carb sensitive diet...and there was definitely no not eating the potatoes, unless you SCRAPPED the sauce off and then, how delicious is naked pork chops? Otherwise, fantastic, just thought I could eat it carb friendly-ish and you really can't...but maybe that's just me.

I made this tonight with 2 fairly thick chops. It Was excellent. I have been having trouble perfecting "scalloped potatoes". My husband was like, "yummm scalloped potatoes!!" I rubbed sage with the S&P. Used 1 onion and 3/4 can of 
1/2&1/2. Will do this again. Ohh by the way i tore up 2 slices of provolone cheese and topped them on the potatoes

This was pretty good, but the pork turned out just a little bland for our tastes. Our favorite part were the potatoes, they were delicious! I omitted the onions, as we are not fans and added a can of mushrooms to the sauce. I also used 2 cans of mushroom soup to 1 can of milk. The sauce had just the right consistency for us. Next time I think I would add some parsley for a little more flavor. It was a nice comfort food dish, great served with garlic green beans. Thanks!

Great recipe.  I would suggest not to cut the potato into thick slices.  Also, I added a dash of paprika on the pork chops for added flavor.  This one is a keeper.  My hubby would have licked the plate if given a chance...LOL

These came out pretty good. I do think that they were missing a "kick" of some kind. But overall, a good and safe recipe.

If it's too bland for you, try what I did.  I only used 4 boneless pork loin and pounded it out thin.  I then took a fork and poked holes into the pork and marinated them for a few hours in a package of Grilltime Marinade (Zesty Herb, made according to packaged directions) and also added Thyme and a bit of Red Pepper, DO NOT USE SALT!  After meat has marinated, pour all of contents into skillet, including leftover marinade; brown pork on both sides.  After pork is browned take out (leave the drippings in pan).  Sautee your onions in the drippings with a little bit of butter.  Meanwhile, microwave 1 can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and 1 can of Cream of Chicken (DO NOT DRAIN THE WATER OFF & DO NOT ADD THE MILK YET) (I suggest using Low Sodium soup as the marinade is already pretty salty).  Tip: Microwaving the soup first straight out of the can makes it easier to get all of the clumps out.  Whisk together until smooth and then add a little milk not a lot, just about 1/4 cup.  After soup is smooth, pour into the skillet with the drippings and onions; add a sprinkle of more Thyme, some garlic powder, and some black pepper.  Stir together until hot, then pour over pork loin and potatoes.  Bake as usual.  This makes a very tasty thick cream sauce, and the meat is very delicious.  I didn't put the potatoes in with the pork, instead I made homemade mashed potatoes so we could use the sauce as gravy, fried green tomatoes and biscuits.  You don't need to bake as long without the potatoes

This is a great starter recipe!!! I added a layer of 'texmex' grated cheeze over each layer of the potatos. I also added fresh ground pepper & a sprinkle of garlic powder to the mushroom soup.  I then added 1 can of corn nibblets & fresh rosemary over the final layer of potatos.  My suggestion is to increase the beginning temperature to 400 and reduce to 350 for the final 'uncovered' cooking time. I hope you like it!!!

I will make these again! It is a homestyle recipe and tastes like something your Grandmother would make. VERY good and I made the recipe exactly as it is written. I heavily seasoned my chops - lots of pepper and garlic powder, and they were delicious!

This dish is extremely easy to make and tastes great! I make the recipe exactly as written; however, I add minced garlic and sliced mushrooms to the skillet before I saute the onions! One quick advice: Don't be scared to season the porkchops liberally! (I use onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and fresh cracked pepper) It's a fabulous, one-dish meal!

This was really good.  I too added minced garlic to the onions for sauteing.  I went to grab a can of cream of mushroom soup and I was out!  So, I used cream of chicken and added some sour cream.  Hubby and toddler liked it too.  The only other thing I did was microwave the potatoes so they would cook a little faster!!  Bravo!  Great recipe!

Yummy! Filling! Wonderful flavor! My husband and three boys loved it! Easy to make, got rave reviews from the fam. Not a one dish meal as one reviewer responded. Well, if you follow the recipe, you have to cook the sauce in a skillet. I also used two cans of mushroom soup and a can of milk, topped it of with cheese. So goooood.

I was going to make plain old porkchop and stumbled across and I am so thankful that I did. It was fantastic. I loved it. My husband loved it and so did our picky children. I followed the recipe....just added some more mushrooms. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! I really don't understand why anyone would say the sauce wasn't creamy; if done according to directions and wisked together, it comes out 100% creamy. My family of 3 loved this meal and the flavor the sauce with the potatoes was fabulous! This recipe is great because it allows you to use basically any seasoning you choose. So if you're looking for a bit more kick, add something spicy; or stick with the basic salt and pepper if you want more of a natural flavored dish. I think this is a great recipe for flavor and great recipe for simplicity... you can't get much better than that. If it helps, I only use boneless pork chops and they did just fine in this recipe. Also, if you happen to be changing the servings to 3 people, it tells you to use 1/2 a can of soup but I found that an entire can was actually needed. Aside from that everything was correctly measured. Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!

Really yummy recipe. I used the "cream of mushroom I" recipe instead of canned soup. Next time I will make this recipe, I will slice the potatoes thinner, as the cooking time was a little bit longer. Delicious, thanks!

These were good chops and potatos!  I was probably a little generous with the onions and added a clove of garlic.  Only other change was threw some frozen mixed veggies on top of the chops before putting in the oven.  Everything came out GREAT.  Good leftovers too.

Really good!  My only regret was not cooking more potatoes.  I think the potatoes were even better than the pork.  I boiled the potatoes first in large chunks.  I cooked green beans with the dish but next time I may add them in.

Changed this a bit.  Cubed the potatoes and boiled til almost tender then arranged them around the chops.  Follow others advice and add extra seasoning - the milk really thins the soup and the flavor (but the sauce it makes is delicious with the potatoes, so don't skimp on the liquid ingredients!).

Pork chops turned out great, although after and hour and fifteen minutes, the potatoes still weren't quite done, but we were hungry so ate them as they were anyway.  Next time I may prebake the potatoes a little in the microwave while I'm browning the chops or maybe even try the dish in the crock pot?  I'll add some other seasoning too, but as it was, my family liked it and I will make it again.

EASY. I added portabello mushroom slices & will add spices suggested by others the next time I make (garlic or cajun seasoning).  The potatoes were really great, but I didn't brown the chops enough so they weren't as tender as I'd like (my fault). Will make on a regular basis this winter.

My boyfriend is anti-mushroom and onion, so I substituted cream of potato soup and dried minced onions instead and ran the soup mixture through the blender to eliminate the potato chunks.  Even though I sliced the potatoes as thinly and evenly as I could, some cooked thoroughly while others weren't quite done.  He said it would've been a five if the sauce was more flavorful.  I suggest extra seasonings and longer cooking to this great recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

Really good, but way too many onions. Also remember to trim the fat off the chops before cooking. But I will definitely make it again!

Will make again. Good flavor and perhaps add more garlic salt. The soup keeps the pork chops moist but don't overbake.

We all liked it!  It's not only a simple & delicious 'down home' dish, but it's also easy to prepare.  I added some Thyme & more garlic, and I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  I also added a handful of sliced Crimini mushrooms which I needed to use  up.  For us, this is a keeper, even though it's not a 'shmancy' kind of a dish.

I made half the recipe, kept the full can of soup, sliced the potatoes thinly, and added fresh chopped mushrooms. Prepared it early, kept it refrigerated, then baked it later in the day. Came out great.

I'm only giving this a 4 star rating since I didn't follow the recipe fully. Since I'm not eating starches, I didn't add the potatoes. However the Chops were delicious. Lady D

Ran out of pork so I sub'd with boneless chicken thighs.  Other than a more seasoning salt to the chicken and sprinkled salt on sliced potatoes it turned out well. 
I was concerned about the amount of onion (I think instead of mushroom in the title it should say onion), holly molly !! But the onion sweet flavor really makes the meal.
Will I try again, YES but I'll probably use red potatoes and maybe white onions.

It was very good! I made it with red potatoes but they didn't really get soft enough.  Might have to add some time while covered. Sauce was very runny too.  Will make again but will be trying some modifications.

I would set the oven to 400 degrees. The potatoes did not thoroughly cook in 60 minutes at 350 degrees.  Other than that, it was awesome and the pork was moist and cut with a fork. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes to this.  While saute'ing my onions, I also added fresh mushrooms and used a part milk and part 1/2 & 1/2. Very flavorful.  I would make again... However, I would use less milk or use an additional cream soup as the dish was more soupy than I would have liked.  I would have liked a gravy consistency.

Delightfully tender pork chops -- probably the most moist I've made in a long time. For thin chops, I cut the time to 30 covered and 15 uncovered, with no potatoes. I also added a handful of sliced, sauteed cremini mushrooms.

I'm pretty easy to please, it's my husband who's the real critic. He tastes with his eyes, if it looks then it's okay. This dish he gave a real tender and quite tasty. Even though he hates mushrooms, he didn't mention them. I think that's all in his head. By the way I loved it too. Simple to make and will definitely make again.

My family all loved it. I too added mushrooms and garlic to it, and used 2 golden mushroom soup for color and one can cream of mushroom( I was cooking 9 pork chops). I heard from reviews that it was on the salty side so I didn't add any salt, but it still was too salty for me. I also precooked the sliced potatoes in the oven, but this ended up being unnecessary, and they ended up all mushy. Oh well,lesson learned. The family still liked it. Oh and I added shredded Monterey cheddar cheese at the end and let that melt all over the top, the family really seemed to like that! I'll make again but prolly try and find a way to cut through all the salt! I'm assuming it's from the soup and garlic, so instead of one of the cans, I'll add sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  I would definitely make this again as the pork was super tender and tasted yummy. 

Instead of onions, I used sliced mushrooms and a dash of shallots. I also used a seasoning mix on the pork chops instead of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. 

I made this dish with two thick bone-in pork chops rather than the six.  I ended up cooking 10 minutes longer to ensure the chops were done.

Was so-so.  Added extra mushrooms.  Had potatoes left over.  Needs more pork flavor, as was on the somewhat bland side.  Not sure if I'll make it again with so many wonderful recipes available.

The recipe is quite good. But if you want to take it up a notch; use golden mushroom soup and add fresh mushrooms when you are adding the onions in the skillet to saute.

Delicious and so easy. I added fresh mushroons and sliced the potatoes extra thin. Ingredients are common so no need to have to buy things I would never use again. Pork chops were so tender and  the aroma filled the kitchen.

The chops were so tender.  Flavor was great.  Only thing different I did was increase the temperature to 375 degrees.  It was taking a while for potatoes to get tender.  I did slice the very thin with the food processor.   Will do this recipe again.

Superb!!  I added some fresh mushrooms in with the onions and, because the cream of mushroom soup is already salty, I did not use anymore salt, but other than that, I followed the directions, and my husband and I LOVED it!  Bravo!

I did change it up a bit, I made the sauce, cooked up some rotini and took half the sauce and mixed it up with the rotini, then put the pork chops on top of the noodles with a spoonful of sauce on each one and baked it. so I had main dish and a side to go with it. It was very good and I will make this dish again. Next time I may try it with cream of celery soup.

Its very good. hubby loved it! I cut the potatoes scalloped style, and cut it very thinly so it cooked faster. I added worstershire on the mushroom sauce to add more flavor. Also seasoned the potatoes with salt and pepper and put butter on top of the potatoes before I added the chops.

Extremely easy to make, this is a definite comfort food.  I  made mine to the recipe except used one onion only , keeping in mind to slice the potatoes VERY thin. (thanks,all, for the advice; it was spot on! An hour in the oven sufficed.)  DH enjoyed it, tho' he's not an onion fan.  My biggest problem was what to serve with it to contrast the creamy richness of the sauce.  I decided on a salad with vinaigrette dressing.   Next time I will make it using one potato per serving, (4 cups sliced potatoes = 2 raw potatoes) and might de-glaze the pan with a little white wine like somebody suggested.  If I make this for my DIL, I will put some hot sauce on the table for her.

It was good... but next time, instead of the salt, I'll add half an envelope of onion soup. I'm sure it will make it much better.

I made it for my boyfriend one evening. Extremely quick and easy to make. Only thing I twisted is I added condensed broth cube to mushroom sauce to make it more flavourful. I did not add any potatoes as I used pork chops as my side dish. My boyfriend even called me the next day as I packed it for lunch and said it was very delicious.

I Think this is a versatile recipe....those that are advance cooks can make it better...those of us that aren't  appear to be great cooks.  I used a peppercorn rub on the chops and added a little sour cream to the sauce.  It was very good.  Will make again and try it with chicken.

This is a good base recipe that you can improvise with.  After reading about the potatoes not cooking fully, I nuked them for 5 minutes after slicing them.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms, some sour cream and white wine to add richness and zing. 
I served it with baby peas on the side. Turned out really tasty.

What I would change is uncovering the dish for only 15 minutes. Not  30.  I found the sauce lost a bit too much moisture.

I give this recipe four stars because my husband loves it and because it requires so much tweeking to make it really good.
    I'm glad that I read the reviews before preparation.  Doing so saved me a lot of frustration.  I added an extra can of soup, used chicken broth instead of milk,  added four buds (finely chopped) of garlic, one tbs. ground garlic, two tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper, two bay leafs,   some red pepper flakes, one tsp. parsley, and a half cup of white wine.    Because others had difficulty with the potatoes, I sliced mine ultra thin and microwaved them for six minutes thinking that might improve the cooking time.  It still took them an hour and a half to bake.  
I will make this again because hubby likes it so much.  Next time, I think I will take the advice of another reviewer and rub the chops with onion soup to enrich the flavor.  I think I might just pre-boil the potatoes to al dente in chicken broth to significantly improve their flavor and to cut way down on bake time.  I think the dish would only need to bake for about thirty five minutes if I do that.  This is a good basic recipe.  There are so many things you could do to improve or to just change the flavor.  I think it would be good with chicken soup and curry also.  If I find any really good improvements I'll post them.

This is very good and easy! The pork chops were tender. I used a mandolin to cut the potatoes thin, and they were cooked fully in an hour.
 Although I usually  follow recipes exactly as stated, once in a while I change things up  due to personal taste and what I have on hand.  I only had two pork chops, so I cooked fewer potatoes. I chopped up one small onion, along with two cloves garlic (love that garlic), and  followed directions in recipe. I didn't have any milk, but did have cream, so I used that, but cut it down to 1 cup. It turned out rich and flavorful, with more of the mushroom soup flavor. One more thing - I only uncovered it for the last 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, as I was afraid it might dry out. 
So this is a very good basic recipe, which can be altered to your personal taste!

This is absolutely fantastic for how easy it is! I followed the recipe for the most part but when I mix the mushroom soup I add onion soup mix. Just gives it a bit more of a pop of flavour. I also add Italian seasoning to the pork. And depending on how we feel cheese on top. I bake it for about 3/4 of the time before adding it. Very very tasty!

My family liked it,  I did add some garlic to the onions and layered that over the potatoes before placing the chops.  I made a larger serving and did use a can of cream of mushroom with a can of cheddar cheese soup, and that was perfect flavor.  I also decreased the milk by a half cup and used a half cup of sour cream from a previous review.  (that is for the double recipe, so about two cups of milk with a half cup sour cream) .   I also used Johnny's on the chops before browning them, and added the pepper into the soup mixture.    The chops were boneless that I used,  I cooked it 40 minutes covered and then 40 minutes uncovered.    I will make it again.

Great sauce.  I started by sautéing some onions, then added the protein (chicken) along with three Rosemary sprigs, and cooked for about 5 minutes on each side.  I removed that to a baking dish, then deglazed the pan with a little white wine, to which I added garlic and mushrooms.  I cooked that for a couple of minutes then added the milk and soup.  I poured the mixture over the meat and baked for about 45 minutes.  We really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing

This dish was ok. Several reviewers mentioned it needed an extra can of cream of mushroom. I used a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup as my "extra" and liked the way it turned out. I love the flavor of onions, but I'm not a huge onion texture fan, so I think next time I will try this with onion soup mix instead of fresh onion. Also, would recommend trimming and de-boning your chops, since you can't see what you're cutting through the sauce. Overall, it was good. I may try it again in future with tweaks, and I probably would have enjoyed it if it was served at someone's house, but, it's not a "home run" by any means. Quick, simple and easy, but just "ok."

The chops were OK, but the sauce lacked flavor--it had just a hint of onion but not enough to not be bland.  I left out the salt on the chops, doubled the recipe but didn't have double the onions, and added fresh garlic to the onions while sauteing them.  The potatoes cooked up just fine.  I used a Mandoline Slicer to make sure they were thin.  This dish has potential, but is not complete.

I made this for dinner for friends and everyone loved it even mushroom haters!! I did tweek the recipe a bit to make it even better I cooked it in a cast iron pot with the lid on for 2 hours stirring every 30 mins it made the pork fall apart and was so Delish! I also did fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I sautéed some diced mushroom and seasoning blend (unions, &bell peppers) and added that to the mix and made mashed potatoes and poured the mushroom pork sauce on top It was so delicious!!

I am a rookie cook. Wife doesn't much care for my experiments, but loved this one! Per suggestions, added 1 can cream of chicken soup, only chopped 1.5 onions, added about 6-8 ounces of chopped mushrooms, and let it bake for 1.5 hours. Voila! Chops were tender and tasty. The potatoes were soft and delicious. Made some stuffing and used the gravy on it. Mmmmmm! Will absolutely make it again.

Only a few things I did differently, I added some white wine cooking sauce to the cream of mushroom mixture and eliminated the potatoes all together~SUPERB~FAMILY HIT! Even my youngest whom is a picky eater finished his entire pork chop :)

Ran across this recipe this afternoon and made it for dinner.  So easy, and tastes wonderful.  One small change was that I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  The chops & potatoes were cooked to perfection.   Mixed vegetables on the side and it made a complete meal.    Will definitely makes this again and again.

INSTANT new favourite. I have had difficulty getting other members of my family to like Pork Chops. This recipe just did the trick! My wife said, we can now do chops more often!  YAY!  Thank you. Super easy to do, but I did only use one medium onion, and it was the perfect amount of onion flavour for us!  I left it covered for the 1 hour of baking.

i don't understand how this received such a high rating. This turned into a watery, disgusting, curdled mess, yet I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes. No-one would eat it, once they tasted it. I have made this before, but it was cooked in a frypan on the stove and only called for 1/2 cup of milk. It was delicious. I will never make this again.

Absolutely fantastic! Such a homey meal on on a cold winters night. We added more milk and cream of mushroom sauce because we knew the potatoes would suck up so much sauce (and they did). We minced the onions and only used one not two (two is too much) and caramelized the onions with the pork chops which gave them a great flavor. We also added a small shake of garlic powder to the sauce and potatoes.  The pork was done before the potatoes so we took the pork out so it didn't overcook and let the potatoes get tender. This meal is a keeper!

I misread and only added 1/4 cup of milk. I found the cooking time sufficient even with normal cut pork chops.  I did add paprika for a bit of kick.

Good, not excellent. Added mushrooms to onion, which I would do again. Will try seasoned salt on chops and 1/2 the amount of milk to make a bit more flavorful.

Great quick simple meal. After I browned the chops and took them out I sauted onions and added added about 1 cup of fresh mushrooms in the same pan and saauted for about 1.5 minutes then added mushroom soup and milk in right into same pan. Poured the mixture over the chops and potatoes. Wonderful meal with a side of green giant frozen peas

Pretty good. Also tried it with the following changes. Added a bag of onion soup mix. Doubled the pork chops. And cooked that on low in the slow cooker.

This is my second time making this dish in two weeks. It's easy and so delicious!  Instead of using the salt, pepper and garlic, I used Montreal steak spice for an even easier prep!  I will be making this dish for years to come.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband and I loved it.  I did add some spice to it by putting all spice, onion powder salt and pepper onto the chops and browning them in fresh minced garlic and olive oil.  I also used campbell's creme of mushroom with roasted garlic mixed with milk and poured over the chops.  I baked the chops covered on 400 degrees.  I left the hash browns completely out of the recipe and served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  It was so yummy and no leftovers!

I made this basically as written, just substituted olive oil for butter and doubled the amount of rub.  The chops were moist and amazing.  The potatoes were a hit as well.

I followed recipes without manking any changes.  It was OK. Not a bad dish but nothing great.  Not as flavorful as I expected.  Will try making again with some of the suggested tweaks and/or some of my own tweaks.

I have never cooked in life, I've never had to. I recently started cooking for myself and girlfriend. This recipe is AMAZING! Made me feel like a real master chef!  I will use this recipe in the future,although i will be sure to remember BONELESS chops next time!  I didnt use the onions because the Mrs's hates them. I added sauteed mushrooms in the soup mix and I believe they really set it off! The timing worked well for me no issues with the potatoes or the pork chops.
 I L O V E this recipe and so does my girlfriend. Thank you !!!

Easy and tasty. I only used one onion but left everything else the same. I think I will season the potatoes a little next time as well. They did not have much flavor. Will make again.

Our family thought this was just ok, not very flavorful.  I may try some of the other suggestions that other reviewers mentioned (Cajun seasoning, maybe more garlic, etc).  The only changes I had made was using red potatoes instead of russet, I only used 1 onion.  

Also, this seems like it would be pretty good with mashed potatoes instead of the sliced potatoes.

My chops came out a bit on the tough side, perhaps due to the extended baking time required to cook the potatoes. Next time I will take the suggestion to either pre-cook the taters or else use the frozen hash browns. Flavor was ok, but nothing to rave about.

My partner and I made this recipe the other night and she -not a meatlover- LOVED it. I loved it myself but I tend to love any meal with meat in it. We're definitely pinning this recipe.

This was VERY delicious and tender!  I used the recipe as a base and just tweaked it a bit.  I used garlic powder & onion powder, salt & pepper, 1 onion, 1/2 "soup can" of milk & 1/2 "soup can" of white wine. I did not measure my seasonings though, I just sprinkled the seasonings just enough to coat the meat and potatoes.  I sauteed the meat like it said but I used cooking spray instead of butter.  Once the meat came out of the frying pan, I threw in the onions to carmalize then deglazed with the white wine and added the mushroom soup/milk mixture. Let it simmer for a few minutes. Layered the potaotes and chops, then poured the soup mixture over top.  Cooked uncovered for 30 mins then covered for 30 mins (this was backwards from the recipe).  The only thing I would change for the next time is to cut my potatoes thicker so they won't be as mushy, I used a mandolin to slice them this time.  Overall, this was a delicious dish and my family loved it!

Very bland. My wife said the best part of the whole thing was the onions. Potatoes didn't really contribute. Wouldn't do this one again.

Excellent and easy to make. I almost fully cooked pork and cooked potatoes for 5 min in microwave. Tossed potatoes in olive oil and roasted at 450 for fifteen minutes before adding the pork and sauce and reduced to 350. Cooked for 30 minutes covered  then 15 uncovered I used fast fry boneless as we don't like thick chops Family loved it. My brother in law asked I send the recipe to his wife :) I also added sliced mushrooms and cooked with the onions. Served with homemade apple sauce and some left over blue cheese dressing made from scratch the night before . Will become a staple meal

Great recipe! I used half of a large onion, 1 cup milk and added an extra can of mushroom soup. Next time I will be adding more seasoning to the pork chops, they were a little bland. Read the reviews and sliced the potatoes thinner and they turned out great.

Delish! Thank you for sharing. Followed recipe for most part. Didn't have two onions; had 4 big chops; topped with panko crumbs at end. Would maybe par-cook potatoes to speed up cook time. Chops were done but taters could have gone a little longer. Everyone enjoyed this dish and will def make again.

It was a pretty yum recipe. No complaints here. it just didn't wow me. I did sub the potatoes for sweet potatoes, and I didn't have milk so I added quinoa milk to the mushroom soup mix. they were very delish and tender. may try it again, if I happen to have all the ingredients and run out of ideas.

Made this tonight and I was surprised my husband asked me to make it again soon. I did add more spices including cayenne. And I also added sliced mushrooms to the onions (left them chunky). Overall it was very easy and these ingredients are always on hand. Good go to recipe, in the winter months.

Like this dish but instead of baking it I used a skillet and did it in one pan on the stove top and served it with fresh yeast rolls. Turned out great.

I love this recipe. If your chops didn't get tender its because they were to thick. Use thinner chops. My family loves it.

Believe it or not I've been making this for 50 years.  I never used a recipe, just made it up... This one is close to mine.  I created many one pot meals on a budget. With three boys my day was very busy. I used regular chops, potatoe chunks, carrots, onions and garlic, and baked.  I did the same with chuck roast and turkey meatloaf. Of course they all take on a different flavor. Cream of Mushroom soup was a staple in my house. My grown up sons still make this to this day.

My husband and I both enjoyed this for dinner. He said they made great left overs, too. Be sure you cut the potatoes super thin, or they wont cook all the way. I added garlic powder to taste. I will definitely be making these again.

I doubled the spices for the rub before frying the chops.  Came out perfect.  Also tried this with 2 tsp season salt instead of regular and was very tasty. Even the fussy one didn't complain!

This was a simple dish that had good flavor.  I did cut my potatoes (I used red) very thin and added shredded cheddar cheese on top.  It was delicious.  I served with black eyed peas.  Thanks!

This was good, I sliced the potatoes extra thin, as suggested and they came out perfectly. I did have to split it up into two baking dishes, because I had five bone-in chops and they wouldn't fit, so my gravy was a bit less than expected. Next time I will compensate with more soup. I also sauteed mushroom's with the onion (and added minced garlic) and added that to the soup mixture. It tasted great!

Simple and basic! Just the way i like my food. You can always add to this receipe, to make it to your liking. My only suggestion is double the sauce,if you like it creamy.

Very simple and very tasty! I sliced my potatoes very thin and had no trouble with their cooking time. Added 8oz of rough chopped button shrooms into sauce just before removing from heat and saute the onions with 2 cloves minced garlic. Wow how good is this! My boyfriend even did his best Homer impression, AH Pork Chops! LOL A Keeper!

I made this recipe on a whim - I accidentally labeled pork chops as chicken, and realized I wouldn't be making chicken after they defrosted! But this was pretty tasty - I had all the ingredients in my pantry. I wouldn't recommend using Yukon Gold potatoes - they always seem to be undercooked no matter how long you bake them. And I never use that much onion in anything - about 1/2 of a small onion is enough for 2 large servings!

This was excellent.  It's like scalloped potatoes and pork chops all in one!  Can you tell this blows my mind! Ha Ha....YOU MUST TRY THIS ONE! It's easy, foolproof if you follow it....and soooooooo tasty.  Everyone loved it.  It was rich and flavorful....and the pork was done perfectly.  I cooked it covered for 45 minutes then 35 min uncovered because the pork chops were really thick cut.  You seriously can't beat this!

this recipe is excellent.  I added more garlic as we are garlic lovers here. I also added fresh mushrooms and about a cup of sour cream to the sauce.  Having more sauce I baked the chops for about an hour and a half.  My husband, a self proclaimed mushroom hater, thought is was delicious.  I will be making this again very soon.

I made this again and i ran out of milk.  I I substituted 1/4 of the milk for chicken broth.  I also added a bit more salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the sauce.  I thought this was delicious.  This is how I'll make it from now on.

This recipe was very good.  I sliced the potatoes with a mandoline, so the cooking time was not a problem.  I also seasoned the potatoes and added shredded cheddar on top of them before placing the chops on.  I also "seasoned" my chops first in Worchestershire sauce and then Emeril's Rustic Rub.  I added garlic powder to the sauce part as well as corn.  I used creamed corn b/c that was what I had on hand.  The sweetness of the corn seemed to add to the dish!  I sprinkled a few bread crumbs on the top w/paprika for color.  I also did not cook my 2 chops for an hour.  I cooked them for 30 minutes covered and then about 10 minutes uncovered and turned off the oven and let them set for a lil while.  All in all, this was a great recipe (even though I tweaked it a lil per other reviews), and I will make again!  Thank you :)

I rated this 4 stars because after following the suggestions of everyone else, it was really good.
I put the potatoes in the microwave all together first for 8 minutes total.  I used only one onion but 2 might have been okay.  I sprinkled shredded cheese over the potatoes then added broccoli and corn.  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp celery seed to the mixture  after I took it off the heat.  I used 2 cans of soup and one extra soup can of milk.  That was good because it was the right amount of gravy.  I sprinkled bread crumbs (Vigo) to the very top of the casserole and then when it was almost done I added 2 slices of bread I had cubed.  I broiled it for the last 3 minutes and the croutons added a lot more than I thought to the recipe.  

The only thing I think is not quite right are the spices.  It needs more variety of them.  I think a half or full pkg of Lipton herb and garlic soup or one of the pkgs of dry salad dressing might help.   Also, maybe a finely diced green pepper and a 4 oz can of pimentos.  I agree 100% with the person who said this is a wonderful starter recipe.

Very good.  I wasn't going to add onions (short on time) but I was going to stir in a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix into the mushroom and milk mixture but  forgot.  I just sprinkled about 1/2 pkg over the chops and sauce and it turned out perfectly!   Very good recipe...will definitely make again.   Otherwise, followed recipe as written and it turned out great.  I used my Presto Salad shooter to slice the potatoes and they were soft and ready to eat in 1 hr.

Pretty good.  I used 1 large potato per person and 2 pork chops per person (teenage boys are not satisfied with 1 chop).  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup to one can of milk.

Came out very well.  Chops were extremely moist and potatoes and gravy were good.  

Can't wait to try this with the frozen hash browns.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I only tweaked it a little bit by adding some seasonings to the gravy.  I also used two big pork steaks instead of chops and it worked well.  My whole family enjoyed it and even my "pickiest little eater" cleaned her plate.

This is really good, my husband who thinks he doesn't like mushrooms loved it. I did change it a bit, I used a food processer to slice the potatoes to make sure they were thin enough.  I browned the pc on top of the stove, then I removed them from the skilled, put the potatoes in the skilled, topped with the soup and milk, added pork chops, covered and they were done in about 30-45 minutes. I cooked at a very low flame and they were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  This a very easy and great tasting recipe.

This was a very yummy recipe. The only thing different  was I  used onion soup mix with the cream of mushroom soup and milk.I like a lot of flavor. The pork chops were very tender.This is a recipe that I will be using for sure. My husband gave it a ten.  Thanks for the recipe:)

My husband cooked this for the family.  He adjusted the recipe for 4 pork chops, and added minced onion instead of fresh onion.  He made sure the potatoes were sliced very thin.  It was a big hit! Even our picky eater enjoyed it.  Fast, easy, and delicious!

Very Good!  I used 4 chops, and after browning them cut them into strips.  The pork chops were laid upon potatoes that I seasoned with Cajun seasoning.  Oh, and I used a large can of cream of mushroom soup and topped with 8 slices of deli American cheeese for the last few minutes..  Very much a comfort food.  Will make again!  thanks

The pork chops were good, but pretty close to what I already make, although I found that browning them in butter was a nice change. The potatoes, however, were disappointing.

A recipe my whole family loves!!!  Thanks.  I make this ahead and instead of sliced fresh potatoes, I use cubed, frozen hash browns.  I put everything together the night before and pop in the fridge.  We take it out to room temp for about 1/2 hour before baking and it's yum!!  I have 3 girls that don't agree on any meal, but when I make this, I get cheers!

I made a couple alterations to this recipe.  I browned the chops (3 of them) in olive oil, eliminated the milk and used Campbell's Select portobella mushroom soup instead.  When I make it again, I will had a hint of rosemary and use fresh garlic when browning the chops.  Overall, I found this to be very tasty.

I would give this 4.5 stars.  I used frozen hash browns instead of sliced potatoes which was a great idea.  So easy!  I used lots of pepper, salt and garlic powder, and added minced garlic to the onions.  I also added broccoli on top of everything else which made it a one dish meal.  I will make this again, but for now I think I'm sick of so many recipes being made with cream of mushroom soup.

Yum! I liked the idea of prepackaged hash browns but I had potatoes to use so I shredded them myself. Followed directions as far as other ingredients and cooked potatoes a total of 1 hr, pork chops only 40 minutes as they were thin. VERY GOOD! Thanks for sharing!

I seldom make pork chops but this recipe proved that pork chops can be easy to make and delicious. For the scalloped potatoes I used seasoning salt, pepper and added some grated cheddar cheese. I also added some garlic powder and paprika to the sauce to give it a kick. Will definetly make again!

Delicious, easy recipe!  Make sure the potatoes are spread out and not piled up to high to ensure they get done in the alotted time!  Added some extra seasoning to the porkchops while sauteing them.  Onions and potatoes were awesome!!  Overall A++++!

This was just okay. Kind of bland. I did slice the potatoes thin and cooked a little longer--everything was done but just kind of boring, esp. the potatoes.

This recipe was great.  I have never found a recipe that I liked until now.  I may actually eat the other white meat more often.  It was a great meal especially for a cool fall day.  Thanks for the recipe.  It was quick, easy and delicious.

I made this for my husband last night who eats just about anything. He ate it but said he would be ok if I didn't make it again. The pork chop came out tasting very bland and the sauce very runny. I added some cornstarch which helped but it didn't change the fact that the sauce looked very unappealing. I won't make this one again.

This is a great recipe!!!  I used other seasonings before browning these and they turned out great.  I also decided to make roasted potatoes(a recipe i got off this site) instead of sliced potatoes.  I give this recipe 5 stars.

This gets 4 stars for flavor.  We all loved the taste, but I still cannot seem to make a pork chop that is not dry and tough.  I even beat the heck out of them thinking that would help.  If you're a pork chop lover this one is great, I'm going to try it again with either chicken breast or possibly another cut of pork.

I cheated a little by slicing the potatoes a little thicker and putting them in the microwave to half cook them.  I also used garlic pepper for extra seasoning and seasoned to taste, not measurments.  But we loved it!  Something I can't wait to make for a family gathering!

This was very good, I made it for my in-laws.
Took longer to cook, 1 1/2 hrs. I turned the oven up to 425' after an hour.

Excellent recipe. Tastes like scalloped potatoes and pork chops that are so tender.

My husband is not a big fan of pork, but he loved these.  I used half and half instead of milk, and if your chops are thick it takes a little longer to make.  This is a great recipes thanks for sharing it.  desertgal
