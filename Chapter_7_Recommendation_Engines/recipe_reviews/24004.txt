Very easy to make and delicious. Lemon keeps it from being too sweet. We substituted canned cranberry sauce for fresh cranberries which worked very well and also made a good side accent. I will definitely be cooking this again.

This recipe was okay but we all agreed that cranberries and blueberries are better left to turkey. The sauce also seeps into the chicken making an unappetizing purple chicken breast.

I used red raspberries instead of cranberries... it was still good. Will try it again without changing it though!

I found this recipe easy to understand and relatively easy to make. I feel that a little more sugar should be added to help sweeten the cranberry taste as it seemed alittle tart. Overall flavor was very good. Would recommend this meal for family and guest

YUM! I took a tip from a previous reviewer and used rasperries because I didn't have cranberries. I think the raspberry sort of overwhelmed the blueberry flavor but they still looked so pretty in the sauce. This was a beautiful little meal that was enjoyed and will be made again in my house. Thanks for the unique idea.:)

I'm giving this two stars because even though I did not like it my husband did. I thought it was much too sour even though I added some more sugar as someone suggested. I couldn't even eat it.

I made this last night for my wife and I and it was delicious! She LOVED it. I read the reviews and made some successful adjustments based on some of the issues people had: 1) Too tart 2) "plastic" taste/smell and 3) pink/red color inside chicken. 1) & 2) Added some frozen blackberries and raspberries. This added additional sweetness as well as a more fragrant fruity smell. Sometimes unsweetened cranberries can give off a smell that is similar to a "plastic" or "chemically" smell. Before I added the additional berries I could smell what some people were referring to. After though it smelled great. 3) Make sure to brown the chicken in the oil like the recipe says. This will "seal" the outside of the chicken. I had no red/pink color on the inside. I hope this helps. Thanks and enjoy!

We did not care for this at all. The berries turned the chicken a very unappetizing purple and the flavors were almost like plastic. Blech!

Not good at all. The purple chicken was very unappetizing and it needed seasoning before cooking. Very bland tasting chicken very tart sauce. I don't think adding more sugar will solve the problems with this dish. I'm glad I served this to family before making for guests. Will not make again.

The sauce seeps into the chicken turning it into an unappetizing color. I was also very glad I had seasoned the chicken during the browning process because otherwise it would have been very under seasoned and just salt and pepper doesn't cut it. You'd be better off making a blueberry cranberry salsa or chutney to go with a great seasoned chicken breast or done on the gril.

This was tasty. The sauce itself wasn't too tart but the berries were. The only mods I made were to season the chicken breasts before grilling (salt pepper and garlic powder) and grilling the chicken a lot more before adding them to the sauce. This kept them from turning too purple as other reviewers stated. It also created a nice amount of chicken drippings for the sauce (which might have helped with the tartness issue).
