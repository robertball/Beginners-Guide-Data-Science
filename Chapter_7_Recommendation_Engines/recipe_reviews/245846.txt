I cooked in the oven, 10 min, turned then about 10 minutes more on 325*. good flavor, remembering it is bison, some gaminess to it. wonderful not having to add egg and bread crumbs.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I don't use bison often, so I really needed to know which seasonings would be best to bring out the flavor.  I also really appreciated the tip on using medium low heat.  I served the meatballs over egg noodles with a mushroom gravy.  Yummy!

This is my go-to meatball recipe.  I have used it for bison, venison, and beef.  I have also used it with a variety of sauces and sides.  They taste great with all variations of meats, sides, and sauces.  I love that they are Paleo-friendly and don't require any processed grains, salt, sugars, cheese, greasy bacon, or other fattening additives to taste great.  Simple, easy, (relatively) healthy and delicious.  This recipe is a winner!

I thought they were really good although I would probably up the seasonings next time. I did use 12oz of bison and upped the seasonings accordingly, other than that I followed the recipe.

These were phenomenal!   I made these for meatball hoagies and the flavor complimented the sauce so well!  It's a nice break from the traditional italian meatball.

These came out perfectly moist with only the very tiniest bit of pink (which we were fine with). You could cook them for another couple of minutes beyond what the recipe calls for if you want a fully cooked center. On my stove and following the time exactly these got 99% of the way there. The meat eaters in our house prefer beef meatballs, but if you like bison this is a great recipe.

Really delicious way to use bison. I omitted the cumin and used fresh herbs and added rosemary.  Big hit with my daughter as well.  Add rigatoni pasta and Parmesan to the pan for a nice pasta dish.

Very nice mild flavor.  I baked mine at 325 - cook 10 minutes - turn - cook 10 minutes more.  Super easy and very tender meatballs.
