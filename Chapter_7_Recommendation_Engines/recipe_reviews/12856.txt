I am from Spain and one thing you must add to this recipes is 1/2 Tbs of Superfinly chopped Garlic (or galic powder will do just fine too) and 1/2 Tbs dried parsley. It adds the true spanish flare to this classic dish. Do this and this recipes will be well over 5 stars. Make some Aioli from this site and WOOOHOOO, mouth watering goodness awaits your taste buds :)

This was one of the best Calamari recipes I've used - and easy!  The key to tenderness is to NOT overcook in the oil - even if it does't look quite as golden brown as you like. Just follow the recipe exactly.  I served the calamari with the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe and homemade tartar sauce.  A green salad completed this dinner.  This recipe is another reason why I choose Allrecipe.com's 5* recipes - just delicious!

Excellent recipe. Very tender. What about a good dipping sauce? Maybe with a little heat. I'll check Back to see if anyone posted one. Thanks. Fortchy

I've found that with this recipe, you dont want to cook the squid for more than 2 minutes, I cook it for 2 minutes with a few pieces in the pot at once ( dont cook to many pieces at once or the temp. of the oil will drop. I cook on avg 8 pieces at a time ). My family just loves this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I always use the following ingredients to season the batter so that blandness is never a problem...2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 cup flour seasoned with 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. baking powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Add enough water to this mixture to make a slightly thick batter. Mix thoroughly. Dip the calamari rings into this batter then coat with plain (unseasoned) breadcrumbs. Then deep fry (in small batches) for 1-2 minutes at about 375*F. Serve with marinara sauce.

This is great!!!!  We love calamari, and a local restaurant here just serves it w/ a nice, spicey marinara sauce - it is a favorite at this local Italian rest.  I love the Classico Sweet Basil Marinara sauce -- but I doctor it up.  I add crushed red pepper(to taste, and we like it spicey), white wine, and a little bit of sugar to it.

My Nana is from Itlay and calamari was one of her favorite foods.  I had no idea how to cook with calamari but I found this recipe and made this for her for her 95th birthday.  I believe it was one of her favorite things she had eaten in recent years.  The only change I made, upon recommendation from my fish monger, was to soak the calamari in milk for 15 minutes after cutting it up but prior to dredging it in flour.  The calamari came out perfect.  I applaud this recipe for being so simple and delicious, and for allowing me to memorialize my Nana on her birthday.  Thank you!

Quick, easy and tender.  It took away my fear of overcooked "rubberbands" with the very first bite.

I have made this twice now, and both times it's come out awful.  After the first time, I assumed from the reviews it that it had to be my fault, but now I'm not so sure.  

Both times I made it, it was lacking flavor.  Really needed more spice or something.  It was like eating a bisquit.

Its best to add the seasoning after frying the squid. It locks in more flavor that way. Just fry it with just the flour, then add the seasonings afterwards. Realllyyy good with linguine and marinara sauce!!

Excellent!!! Whole family loved it.  I added the garlic and parsley as suggested by SpanishPrincess and a little bit of cayenne and cumin for some kick.  HINT - the calamari should be damp before adding to the flour a few at a time.  If not, the flour will not stick and not too damp or it will clump).

I have never cooked calamari before, so maybe I did something wrong, because the dry mixture came off as soon as it hit the pan.   -My kids gobble calamari up at the restaurant, but no one in my family liked this

I got my squid-hating husband to try one, then he asked for a few more. He said they were tender, and I agree. I dipped them in egg, then rolled in panko, then in the flour mix (with less salt in it). Fried in deep fryer for about 2  minutes or less--removed each ring as the panko on it browned.

First off, people have to realize that this is NOT a batter recipe. Do not add water and make it into a batter! This is just a light dusting over the squid to give it a little crunch and flavor. I do suggest adding a little garlic powder and reducing the salt as it makes it taste so much better. I worked in a greek restaurant for a couple of summers as a teen and this is exactly how they made their fresh calamari. Serve it with finely chopped red onion and lemon wedges and you should be good to go! kudos on this great recipe!

I tried this recipe as described first.  It was sub-par at best.  I took a reviewer's advice and added some garlic powder to the flour mix.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I used regular 2% milk.  I dipped the calamari in milk, then the flour, then repeated again. So the calamari was dipped twice in milk and twice in flour.  It gave it a nice thick (but not too thick) coating of batter.  It also cooked to a perfect golden brown in the oil.   I also changed veggie oil to corn oil because thats what I had on hand.  Overall, with a few changes, it came out excellent!

Something is missing from this recipe and have to give it a bad review cause it would have been a waste of calamari. Flavor was good but after reading the complains here, I  saw this on another recipe and decided to follow the advice. Try soaking the calamari anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours in Buttermilk if you have time (optional). Then drain the calamari and save the buttermilk. Coat the calamari with flour, pass thru the buttermilk and then flour again, then fry it. The batter will stay and it won't be wasted calamari.

A new addition to my menu.  This was excellent.  However, based on the recommendations of others I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and I halved the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, an added secret to tender calamari is to combine 1 cup whole milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar and let the calamari soak in this sour milk for 4 hours, then dump the sour milk and add 1 cup fresh whole milk and let set over night.  I breaded my calamari wet in an old bread bag with the breading and shook.  Because it was wet more breading stayed on the calamari which is why I had to half the salt.  Do not bread the Calamari and let it sit for more than 5 minutes.  I serve the calamari with a lemon wedge, marinara sauce and Aioli from this site, however, customers agree that the calamari by itself is excellent.  Last thing, you only need to cook the calamari for 1 minute----Very Important to not over cook.  Follow this and you will have some excellent calamari!

Very good recipe.  I added garlic powder too.  2-3 minutes might even be too long, as others have mentioned do NOT overcook.  This recipe had more flavor than similar dishes I have had in some restaurants.

i knew something was wrong when i mixed all the ingredients together; the batter was way too dry for the calamaris to be coated, but i tried it anyhow hoping the outcome would be great.  what a waste of calamaris!  this does not have any taste at all.  my husband who loves calamaris didn't even touch it, much less look at it.  :(

I put half bread crumbs and half flour. I might even change it to more crumbs. Be very careful as to how hot you have your oil. You won't realize how much it will spatter until you put the first batch in. Cook for a couple of minutes only. I tripled the recipe. A nice sauce is a homemade Tartar Sauce. 1/2 C mayonnaise, 1 T chopped chives, 2 T relish, 1 T seeded mustard, 1 clove crushed garlic.

im rating the technique, i just made this and it was great, i did use other seasoning cuz i know my taste.  I also did not season the flour, why people do this i will never understand and you wonder why it was bland?  i seasoned the calamari with season salt, oregeno, and motreal steak seasoning while it was wet cuz you need it to stick, then i put it in a baggie with flour to coat.  I deep fried it for 3 mins, perfect.  I served it with thai sweet and hot diping sause.  very good.

This came out incredible! First, I found cleaned, frozen squid at my local supermarket. It was only $3.99 for 12 ounces. (This served 2 people). I combined flour, cayenne pepper, parsely flakes, salt and garlic. Wet the squid after slicing them. The flour mixture coats them very well. I agree with others in testing the first one to make sure it is cooked, but not overcooked. I don't think I cooked them any longer than 60-75 seconds, in small batches. My husband was bummed I didn't have any more to cook up, they were delicious! Keeping this recipe! 
For Rhode Island style, cut up some pepperoncini's and mix them into the finished product. YUM!! This is a keeper!!!!

Honestly, I thought the "breading" was a little thin.  I took some suggestions and added the additional spices, but just overall felt like the flour mixture didn't stick well.  I probably will go with the one from FoodNetwork next time.  A little more involved, but better.  Thank you anyway!

For more crunch and the "breading" to stick, I dipped the calamari in egg and then panko. 

Can anybody suggest how to maintain the oil temperature? No "unlikely" aftermath happened on my first attempt cooking. Not that I know of anyways.

Very tasty but I had to triple the flour.  I just kept adding flour until the squid wasn't sticky to the touch anymore.

I added 1 tbs of garlic, 2 tsp of paprika and doubled the flour.  Definetly a good idea to test out a little batch to check cooking time.  Mine took a little under 2 minutes. With the changes I made I give mine a 5!

We had some trouble with this recipe at first because the squid we bought was frozen in ice, so the batter wouldn't stick.  We ended up scaling up the batter to use 3 cups of flour, and then it worked.  This turned out really tasty, but I would use a little less salt next time.  Also, I'd recommend you do a test batch to see how long you need to cook the squid, cause our first batch came out too hard.  We served this with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" as a reviewer suggested, and it was awesome.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Doubled the recipe (not the salt per other reviews), soaked squid in milk, and added paprika, garlic powder, and some cajun seasoning to the flour mixture.  Cooked in batches and didn't have a problem with the coating coming off.  Served with a trio of sauces.  It was a hit.

I bought calamari steaks and I was looking for a simple way to cook them. I am on a special eating plan so I left off the flour and added white pepper. I sliced the steaks into small strips before seasoning and only used 4-5 TBSP of oil for cooking instead of deep frying. It popped and spattered quite a bit so next time I will be sure to pat dry the calamari before seasoning.

Will only take about 30 sec to cook.  Anything longer and it will be tough.  Just great!!!  Did add garlic to flour mixture and sprinkle with fresh minced parsley.  Ketchup mixed with wasabi for dip.  Yum!

Thanks for the great recipe. I made the following dipping sauce and it is so delicious! It's like Thai spicy sauce.   1) 4 tb of olive oil 2) 1 1/2 tb of honey 3) 1 tb of tabasco sauce (spicy) 4) 2 tb of lemon juice 5) 1 chopped pepper 6) 1 tb of chopped onion  Lay some fresh lettuce or sliced carrot first and put your Calamari on the vegetables. Hope you like this dipping sauce!

Pretty good. I love oregano and it smells so aromatic. The only part I hate was cleaning and slicing the squid buy it was worth the trouble though. It goes well with any sauce as well such as aoili, marinara, even buffalo wings hot sauce, and my most favorite is the thai chili butter sauce (AR) that I got from a local restaurant.

Light and tasty. I would suggest dipping the squid rings through some egg before dredging through the flour/spice mixture. The mixture didn't stick on the "fried" calamari until I did this.

Hi, Thank you for the recipe. I wasn’t totally impressed. I did take the previous suggestions and added powdered garlic and cut down on the salt. The problem I had was with them browning at all.  I pulled the first few out after a couple of minutes and they tasted like flour.  I had the oil very high, they were completely covered with oil and they were frying vigorously.  I added more time to cooking them (like 5 minutes) and they were better.

I would just like to add that a good dipping sauce would be a spicy marinara.Just make or buy your favorite marinara and add crushed pepper flakes.Serve the sauce at room temperature or cool.The more pepper flakes the better.The lemon wedges will cool the heat.

I've always been wary of cooking squid because I have a tendency to overcook it, and who likes eating fishy rubber bands?? Not only was this recipe ridiculously easy, I ended up cooking them perfectly for a change. The only thing I did differently was too add some garlic powder to the flour mix. The coating was perfect - light and ever so slightly crispy. These were better than calamari I've had in a lot of restaurants. And the lemon is a must. Thanks!

I LOVE CALAMARI! I didn't realize how hard it is to cut the squid into rings. I put a paper towel under the squid and rinsed off the jelly stuff. It helped to cut it a bit.

I seasoned my flour with italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and a few other of my favorite seasonings.  Calamari only took 1 minute and came out perfect.  I added yellow mild pepper rings and olives.  This was delicious restaurant quality.

A great recipe! I got rave reviews from guests at a recent party I hosted. I recommend also turning your calamari inside out so that all parts get covered in breading.

I made this just as directed, but it was far too bland for my family. I suppose being accustomed to Cajun spices has ruined my family for good ol' food...they want, no they require, more spice. Great for those not interested in heavy spice, though.

I made this with frozen calamari rings from the supermarket. After reading other reviews, I cut the salt in half and added garlic salt and dried parsley to the mixture. Used a deep fryer and cooked for 2 1/2 minutes and they were excellent!

If you follow the suggestions provided by Outback Sweet Treats review, these are amazing and totally addictive. I can't speak for the base recipe because I added the extras, but I can't imagine it being bad since these were sooooo good!

This was very good but a bit too salty for me, so next time I will reduce the amount of salt.  I reduced the amount of pepper because I was serving it with a Parmesan-Peppercorn dipping sauce.  I think it will be very good with the amount of pepper called for if not using a dip.  I needed to double the amount of seasoned flour for 12 calamari.

Delicious. Here is a hint to save some money. Buy your squid at your local asian supermarket I got 2 lbs. of squid for around $5. Had to clean it myself, no big deal, was glad to save a lot of money.

HINT: Make 8 pieces at a time to prevent the oil's temperature from dropping!

I learned this from a previous comment, and it really worked perfectly. This tastes better than most restaurants in Florida!

Great base recipe. I like to add a little cayenne pepper to the flour as well. For those looking for a crispier, more even coating, I recommend following these steps, then dunking the floured squid in beer and rolling in bread crumbs before frying. Serve with an aioli (mayo, minced garlic, lemon juice, and maybe a teaspoon of pesto). Made this two days running due to popular demand!

Turned out well, next time I think I'll add a bit more spice to my taste, but the cooking time was bang on.
I used frozen squid rings, next time I think I'll try fresh I have a feeling they will be much better.

Great little recipe.  Quick, easy and tastes so good.  As another reviewer suggested, I added some onion powder, garlic powder and parsley flakes to the flour. Wonderful taste.  However, it was a little too salty at times.  Next time, I would put less salt.  But overall, really good.  Thanks!

Very good recipe/instructions, just make sure you have good calamari to use, we made it twice and the first time we used high quality calamari and they were perfect, melt in you mouth, the second time was some frozen stuff, seemed more like fisherman quality and it was very tough and had little hard pieces.

Delicious! I added a good shake of cayenne pepper to try to make it like the restaurant where I used to work (not spicy but with a little extra something.) It came out great, light and crispy and not greasy at all. Next time I will cut down a little on the salt as I found it a little too salty, but my husband thought it was great as is.

Good recipe, definately needs the garlic addition though. I accidentally added too much pepper to the first batch and they were terrible so watch out for your measurements. The next batch had the right amount and were delicious.

It's easy and very successful. My boyfriend said it was fresh and have nice thin batter, unlike the one he had in the restaurant that had too thick and oily batter. I cooked each batch just 1.30 minute and it is well done but not chewy at all. He had it for dinner and now he wants it more for lunch the next day.

Flavor wasn't that great...guess oregano just didn't cut it for me. However, what killed this recipe is the amount of salt called for. It turned out really salty. Next time I think I'll reduce the amount of salt by half.

This was okay as written, but it was kind of bland and the color was not too appetizing :(  I needed to dredge the squid in seasoned bread crumbs, as well as the flour...I love fried calamari, but I probably won't make it again at home..it really smelled up my house...I'll go out and order it :)

I followed the recipe to the tee -- except for using Italian seasoning in place of oregano.  This recipe came out perfect...even my picky kids who never ate calamari before loved it.  Thanks a bunch.

AWESOME recipe! It was a hit, my husband said it was the best Calamari he's ever had.  I used a candy thermometer to make sure the oil was the right temperature and set the timer to cook them for 2 1/2 minutes just like the recipe called for.  They were not chewy at all.

I did double the flour mixture and added 2 tsp. dried parsley mixed with garlic flakes.  The only thing I thought is that it had a bit too much salt, and I'm a salt lover, but nobody else complained.

I found it easies to put the flour mixture in a ziplock bag, toss in the calamari rings and shake it in there.  After they were coated I put them on a plate so it would be easiest to drop each batch in the oil at the same time so they would cook easiest and not have to dig around the flour mixture looking for the rings.  Between batches I stuck the thermometer back in the oil to get it up to the right temperature.

I served it with Prego spaghetti sauce cause I was too lazy to make my own.

Great flavor. Took the advice to add in some garlic and parsley. But the calamari got a little soggy  as it sat on the table.

We lived in Sicily many years ago and have loved calamari ever since then. We have never tried to make it at home until now with this recipe. Having a electric fryer makes it much easier to control the cooking time and temperature. The only change we made was to soak it in milk and then add a sprinkle of cayenne to the flour mix. As an experiment, we froze some (like the Phillips brand) and reheated it. Not bad but definitely better fresh. This is really good calamari- well worth the effort!

Another Awesome recipe for a simple calamari dish. I whipped up these sliced squid for a crunchy version of squid on Paella ......... ahhhh sooo good! Used Greek Seasoning with the salt and pepper! You really need to use the heads just as good as the body! This version used with the Okinawan Shoyu Pork recipe made with ramen noodles, enoki and halved 6 minute boiled eggs.

This is great. Though it never browned as much as I’d have liked, the squid was not chewy. A great dip that works for me is sour cream with a bunch of dill and a dash of cayenne and black pepper. Awesome!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added garlic powder and parsley.  We dipped this in marinara sauce and enjoyed it, but will make spicy marinara next time.  The calamari cooks quickly, but if you watch the rings taking shape it's easy to see when they are ready to be turned.  The rings become plump and the breading becomes crispy, and then it's time to turn.  For one pound of calamari I mixed another batch of breading, so would just double next time.

Great recipe. I added garlic powder as one user did. Only took about 60 seconds at 375 degrees and it was just beginning to get a light brown color when I took it out of the oil. Tender and delicious.

I made this using 2/3 flour and 1/3 panko crumbs. I also added some garlic powder and oregano, along with the salt and pepper. I soaked the thawed calamari in milk, which helped the breading stick. I deep fried for about 1 minute, but I cooked one batch for 2-3 minutes and it was crispier. This is as good as a restaurant's! I also served it with best ever marinara sauce from this site which I added a heaping teaspoon of horseradish to....It was great! I will be making this again, making sure to fry each batch for 2-3 minutes.

I added garlic and parsley to the batter, served it with ginger cherry sauce. It was really good, I've had overcooked calimari before and was dreading overcooking it and getting a rubberband consistency. Thankfully it cooked perfectly, a true miracle for me. Delicious.

*A word of caution* if you defrost the calamari in water, allow it to completely dry before cooking, my oil overflowed. this recipe was great, made it just as written, it was slightly sweeter than I expected. It probably needs to cook a little longer than 2 minutes but not much.

I followed the recipe exactly and mostly liked the results.  The only thing I would have improved was that the calamari didn't really have a solid layer of crispiness on the outside - the coating wasn't quite thick enough.  It was, however, very tasty!

I made this calamari recipe for dinner tonight exactly as per the recipe. It was simple but excellent. I really loved it. The other reviewers are right. I took the calamari out of the oil after slightly more than 2 minutes and they were perfect. The batter (which is very light) was not brown so don't expect it to be. I made my own tartar sauce to go with it and it was very good. Great recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I made this recently and it was so amazing that I swore I would never buy fried calamari again. It's so much easier than I thought it would be since I don't think I ever made fried calamari before. Anyone can make this. Making it again today. I did use kitchen scissors to cut the rings, very easy.

It was good.  But I couldn't get the flour mixture to stick to the rings w/o using egg to make it.  How long it is in the oil is SOOOOO important.  Not long enough the squid is too rubbery and too long the breading burns.  A couple times I managed to get it just right and it melted in my mouth.  I wanna say it was 3 min, but it was a while back.  I'll have to try this recipe again.... and report IMMEDIATELY.

Sorry, but I tried this recipe twice. Both times it was a disaster? Really don't know what to say when so many people give it good reviews.

Fantastic! I followed SpanishPrincess's suggestion and added garlic powder and parsley. Really added more flavor to it. We thought it was the best calamari we'd tasted in a long time. Don't worry if it looks like you're loosing some battery while frying. It'll taste great. Definitely will be making again and again.

I havent tried it yet so I will rate when I do. just wanted to mention, I saw people asking about dipping sauce. I dont know if it is a B.C. thing, but people around here seem to serve it only with taziki sauce. I love it so I never thought of another way. It makes a great cool dip, really nice in the summer.

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and chopped some garlic into the oil. The rest I did as in the recipe. I wasn't sure how high I should have the heat because I don't have a thermometer but I started on high heat and then turned the heat down to medium when I felt it was too high. The smaller rings turned out great after three minutes, not tough at all. The larger ones I had to throw back on the frying pan, and added a slice of chili pepper with them. I love my food lightly spicy and the calamari turned out even tastier.

Very good calamari.  I added a heaping teaspoon of seasoned salt to the flour and oregano mixture.  Served with tartar sauce this was a great treat.

I fried a few rings at first to try and this was very bland.  I spiced up the squid with garlic powder, pepper and a little salt then added more garlic and pepper to the flour.
