This is essentially a good recipe. I did make some tweaks tho that I think will solve most of the issues I see. First of all, as with any yolk custard, you want everything ready ahead of time. Do NOT mix the water with the egg yolks. Beat the yolks separately. Use only 3 tbl of Corn Starch. Add the dry ingredients to the pot to the pot, then add the water. Heat on med stirring constantly until thick and bubbly. Mixture will be VERY thick. Temper mixture into the yolks slowly until you have incorporated half of the mixture into the yolks. Scoop the yolk mixture back into the pan and cook for exactly one more minute. Remove from heat and blend in the lemon juice. Then blend in the butter and beat for 30 seconds. I think you will find a better taste and texture with this method.

The recipe has lemon JUICE in the ingredients and says lemon EXTRACT in the directions.  I assumed it was juice because, hey, who would use 2/3 c of extract!  It came out pretty gelatinous (sort of stiff) I may have cooked it too long.  And it had a strong sort of bite to it (could've been the lemons).  I used it for a filling for a white cake so I whipped some whipping cream and used about 1/2 whipped cream, 1/2 lemon custard and it was all the rave.

I wanted to use this as filling between cake layers.  The lemon flavor is very mild, consitency was perfect for a filling, but the flavor was just very weak even after adding extra lemon.

I don't know why so many people have a problem with this recipe because it is delicious! Not corn starchy at all! I did make a few slight modifications:   ~I have made this twice, and the second time used a little less sugar.  ~I beat egg yolks in the bowl, and added the lemon juice and a little zest.   ~In a saucepan, I melted the sugar, butter, and salt in half the water. I whisked the corn starch in the other half of the water, then once everything was melted, added the starch water and cook until desired consistency.   ~Then, I added the sugar mixture to the egg mixture in small amounts until well blended.     I used this to make lemon crepes and lemon tarts. I love it. I tried the lemon flavored jello, and this recipe has a much better flavor.

This recipe was not at all what i was looking for. i wanted something that was like the filling of a lemon doughnut. but this was not it. If you like the way cornstarch tastes. you will love this, because that is what it tastes like, with a lemon twang at the end.

This was very good.  However, I did add 1/2 tsp. lemon extract for a stonger lemon flavor and only used 3 tbsp. of cornstarch.

After following the advise of Scott d BBQ man, I changed the method of adding ingredients. I combined the dry mix with water and cooked till thick. Then tempered in the yolks and cooked about a minute longer. Then added in the lemon juice....and as I'm writing this I realized I forgot the butter!! Oops! After adding the juice, I removed from the heat. This will be my go to recipe every time I need a thick lemon filling or custard! Even without the butter, it's delicious!!!

I used less cornstarch than the recipe called for and it still had a "raw" cornstarch taste.  The balance seems to be off.  It did have a nice lemon flavor. I would adjust the cornstarch again, and try cooking it longer to blend the flavors better.

This did not turn out for me at all. It did not get very thick and it tasted like cornstarch. Maybe I did something wrong? Ended up filling the cake with whipped cream instead.

This was our first time making custard and it turned out great.  We followed the instructions to the letter and were very pleased.  Super lemon taste, slightly tart, slightly sweet - the perfect balance.  My 15-year old daughter made the custard with no help and was very successful.  We used it as filling on a white layer cake.  Wonderful!!

This is a good recipe for a tart or what I used it for, a danish. Very good lemon taste (double the amount of fresh lemon). If you're on the east coast the filling is like a Tastycake Pie or Hostess Pie. I don't think this is for a cake but more so for a tart, pie, danish, or donut. This is a simple recipe I can't imagine what other did to have a poor result.

I've made this stuff so many times, it's a hit with my patients.  I'm a nurse working with severely depressed geriatric patients in a community mental health clinic, and I offer them choices of cakes for me to bake for their birthdays.  This is a top favorite.  Yeah, kinda thick, kinda cornstarchy, but as some leave and others take their place, the word gets around that, "...if it's your birthday, ask for her lemon cake!"

It will turn out better if the cornstarch is mixed with the water first to avoid lumpiness and then add it and the beaten egg yolks to the dry ingredients. I used fresh cut Persian lemons from one of my lemon trees squeezing up to 4 lemon skins after I took the juice and this way I got the lemon oil as well. I highly recommend this recipe. ...ARG.

I followed Scott d BBQ man's advice from May 10, 2010 by cutting down the corn starch and rendering the egg yolks.  I decided that the butter would melt better if I added it before the lemon juice.  It took some time to thicken up, so I think the people who had trouble with this recipe did not stir long enough.  After I made this, I let it cool and then covered it and put in the refridgerator over night.  In the morning I whipped some heavy whipping cream with sugar and vanilla.  After stiff peaks formed, I folded the lemon custard into it.  I then stuffed puffed pastry with the lemon infused whipped cream and strawberries.  WOW.. What a wonderful treat.  My husband and the girls at work loved this!!!

I was craving a lemon custard type dessert and decided to try this with some modifications.  I used 2% milk instead of water and followed another reviewer's suggestions to temper the egg yolk with the milk-sugar-starch mixture.  I added lemon zest in addition to the lemon juice for extra flavor and omitted the butter.  I chilled it for an hour then froze it for another 2-3 hours.  It was refreshing and had a nice texture although perhaps a little too sweet to be eaten alone.   Next time I will try this as a filling.

Yummy! This recipe is great. I modified it a little bit with less cornstarch (3 tbs only) and a little less water and sugar. For two egg yokes I think the less sugar and water make it taste perfect. This recipe is so good and I used one real lemon and squeezed it twice into the saucepan while I stirred the eggs on low heat.

This did not taste good, and even though I followed the directions precisely, as soon as I spread this between the layers and put the top cake on, it went splat down the sides. Not thick enough to be a filling, and not tasty enough either. Had to scrape it off the cake and throw it out. A waste of my time and my ingredients. I cannot recommend this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!! I use this filling with a cream cake recipe I found on this site (Creamy White Layers). I also keep a portion of the custard and fold in some whipped cream to frost the cake. It's makes a wonderful light and tasty lemon dessert.

Made this along with David's Yellow Cake (substituting the vanilla for lemon extract), Lemon Curd and Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting into a 4 layer cake for my Mom in Law's birthday.  She ran away with the cake!  Adjusted it by adding an additional 1/8 cup of half and half and  2 more tablespoons of butter after taking it off the heat.

I used this for a custard filling for a tart. I read about the cornstarch from other reviewers, so used a bit less of that. I'm also into turbinado sugar lately, so used that instead of white (just a bit less than called for for white), and also added LEMON ZEST (about 1 1/2 tsp). Yum!

Came out way too thick for the liquid ratio to the thickening. Not very flavorable. Maybe put some almond or vanilla extract in it and increase the liquid. Not good...should of maid lemon curd instead.

This lemon filling was absolutely divine! I filled a yellow cake with this and covered it with a chocolate frosting that I found on this site, and it was fabulous. I made the cake a day ahead, and this didn't make my cake soggy at all.  It tasted especially good because the cake reached room temp while the filling was still cold and firm. Everyone raved about it. I did add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, though, since I like a powerful lemon taste.

The rainbow cake was great. Did not like the taste of this at all. Too much corn starch! Eish I would have read all the comments before making. A lemon curd filling would have bedn delightful!

Following the instructions I made the delicious colorful cake, didn't need to modify anything.  The cake was moist and full of flavor if you like citrus flavors.  The lemon custard filling gave it that little extra tanginess combined with the orange cream frosting as a whole, the cake was perfect and festive as a birthday cake too.

I added lemon extract and grated lemon peel to up the flavor. Next time I would reduce the cornstarch as it was a bit stiff. It was a very tasty addition to our cake!

I loved it. Only thing it need was some lemon zest and more juice and for extra lemon flavor I cooked it with the rinds!

Tastes great, great consistency. A trick I've learned from previous custard recipes: you want to actually touch the plastic wrap to the custard while cooling. This prevents a film from forming and saves your consistency. Did not taste like cornstarch, had a perfect lemon taste (not too much, not too little). I used organic cornstarch and Santa Cruz organic lemon juice, which is a very strong-tasting lemon juice. I found myself in a bind when I forgot the filling for pastries I was making, and this was quick. I had all the ingredients already and it was exactly what I needed. Thank you!

Used 3/4 cup of evaporated milk instead of water for extra richness. Also used 1/4 tsp. of lemon extract. After reading the other reviews saying that it had a strong corn starch flavor, I lowered it.

The ingredients and the proportions are perfect in my opinion, but for the method, follow the instructions of reviewer Scott d BBQ Man.  You need to mix the dry ingredients together with the water, and cook and whisk continuously until thick.  Keep the beaten yolks separate until the mixture is as thick as you want it to be.  Then put a few spoonfuls of the white mixture into the eggs, beat vigorously by hand, add a bit more, repeat, and eventually put the whole combined mixture back into the pot that's on the heat and continue to cook and whisk for one additional minute.  Then finish by removing from heat and whisking in juice and butter.  Do not stop stirring at any stage or it will clump up.  Believe me, it's worth it.  I wanted to eat the whole thing with a spoon without putting it on the cake. It made enough to make a thick layer between my two cake layers (8" cake) and also a layer on the top (underneath the icing - made it extra delicious!).  Oh and I don't have a double boiler and just used a very thick-bottomed saucepan and it worked fine.

It tastes AMAZING!!! I would definitely make it again,although,it does smell weird and on the directions when it says "take off heat and cool" so I didn't know if I was supposed to put it in the fridge or not. It still tastes great though!

This recipe went from thin to super clumpy in about two seconds. I whisked until I could break most of the clumps apart. It didn't taste eggy so I know the eggs weren't scrambled but it had an odd texture compared to other curds I've made. Perhaps there was a bit too much cornstarch but I was able to use it for my cake filling anyway.

I consider myself somewhat expienced at making custards. This one was horrible with a  strong taste of cornstarch.  It was not edible.
