Really tasty.  Boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts for an hour then shredded.  Also added a few tablespoons of chicken bullion for flavor.

Really enjoyed it......it was a fast and easy dinner especially since I threw the chicken in the crockpot in the morning.  I had never made Chicken and Dumplings before and it came out great!

My first attempt at Chicken and Dumplings and huge success!  I threw some leftover roasted squash, onions,and sweet potatoes in with the chicken to deepen the broth without adding more butter.  Used 3 split chicken breasts in place of a whole chicken.  The dumplings are great but I will double them next time.  Even better after sitting overnight and letting the broth flavors continue to mingle.  A definite repeater!

I was really surprised by this recipe.  I usually add tons more stuff to chicken and dumplings and made this as a faceless recipe for the AllRecipes Allstar faceless recipe challenge.  I really loved it.  I made it as written and I also made carrots, potatoes, onions, celery, thyme on the side cooked in the same broth.  I really liked the original recipe the best (and we love veggies).  This will be my go to chicken and dumpling recipe.  I must say also that I have never fixed flat dumplings, only the round ones.  I had to get help from the Recipe Buzz but they showed me how to make the dumplings.  (they should be rolled out to about 1/8th of an inch.)  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

We love this recipe! I roasted a whole cut up chicken for a bit first to brown it and get that roasted flavor, then cooked it in the crockpot with some dehydrated onion, pepper, and water.  The rest of the recipe I followed the same. We are dumpling lovers so I needed  to double the dumpling recipe.

I made this reciepe because my husband is from Florida and this is one of his favorite dishes that his grandmother use to make. It was so easy and so delicious that I will keep this and use it often.   My husband ate bowl after bowl until it was gone!  It is definitely a keeper, thanks so much!!!

Delicious.  To those who dumplings "fell apart".  Do not stir!  Stirring is sure death for your dumplings.  Also, broth should be at a slow boil when placing dumplings in the broth.

Very easy but I added salt and pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, and celery seed to mine.  Very tasty and would probably add carrots and celery to it next time.

dumplings didnt work out at all. i made it a second time because the soup part was very good- i just peiced up biscuit dough like other reviewers and it turned out great. i also thickened it up a little by removing about 2-3 cups or broth and whisking in flour until it was almost like a dough- it was amazing!

Thank you for your mom’s recipe. It turned out really good. I just used the dumplings from the biscuit box.  I sautéed some carrots and celery in little butter and added to broth. It was delicious. Will do it again.

Love this recipe.  One of my favorite dishes in the world is chicken and dumplings and this recipe is one of the best I have ever tried.   The only change I made is that I added a whole peeled onion (cut in half) and a rib of celery to the pot when I was cooking the chicken.    When I removed the chicken from the pot I discarded the onion and celery.  Anyway....this recipe is OUTSTANDING.

When I made the broth I added thyme, oregano,pepper, bay leaf, carrots, celery, and onion. And when I strained the broth out I added the carrots and celery back into it when I added the chicken back. Every one at home loved it. Even dad who grew up on his moms chicken and dumplings.

I really enjoyed the finished product.  I added some celery to the stock process and left it in for texture, as well as adding some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning at the end...Yum!!
