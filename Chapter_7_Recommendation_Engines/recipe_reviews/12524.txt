I made this recipe pretty much as is except I cut the sugar in half because I like my pies to be sweet/tart. The apricot flavor of the pie was very intense - unfortunately - the sulfur taste had intensified also. I love apricot pie so I put the pie down the disposal and tried again using unsulfured apricots. I had to adjust the amount of water and simmering time because unsulfured apricots are hard and dry as well as being dark. The filling was charcoal grey, which I could have lived with, but it was also bitterly intense.  I wish I could have made it work but I won't try this recipe again unless another reviewer has a suggestion which might help.

A delicious pie, but a bit too sweet. Next time I'll add less sugar. I put in some grated lemon rind for balance.

I added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and used slab apricots which are already cut.  I only had to bake for 30 minutes, otherwise the crust would have burned.  It also may be a little too sweet.  The last touches I made was some sliced almonds on the top of the pie for decoration.

Tried this recipe today.  Substituted hazelnut liqueur for orange liqueur and this worked well.  Apricots were also a bit dry from me leaving the lid off too long when stirring, so I added the juice of one small Meyer lemon.

Apricots I used were home-dried Blenheims, and thus a bit sweeter and drier than most store-bought would be, so the added lemon was a good idea.  Flavor is excellent, but a bit intense for a whole pie.  Would recommend this as a perfect filling for small individual tarts.

A good use of a big bag of dried apricots. One piece is very filling!

I made this for Thanksgiving potluck and everyone loved it (especially me).  It's slightly tart with a deep apricot flavor.  Wonderful.  The only downside was that there were no leftovers.  
Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.
