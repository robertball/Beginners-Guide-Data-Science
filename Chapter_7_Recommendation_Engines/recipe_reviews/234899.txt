This is a really nice marinade.  It won't replace our "go to", which is the standard for earning 5 stars, but it is a solid 4 star marinade (and, who knows, it may be a 5 star in YOUR world)!.  We used it on a NY Strip and 2 small filets Mr. LTH grilled.  I omitted the celery salt per personal preference and realized we were out of sage, so that was left out, too.  Our meat marinated about 5 hours and that was enough time to impart plenty of flavor.  THANKS for the recipe!

I used this marinade on a tri tip I cooked and it turned out great!.  It didn't over power the meat, but have it some great flavor. I am definitely going to use it again!

this reminded me a good deal of Grilled Tri-Tip with Oregon Herb Rub on this site so i decided to give this a try with a few modifications that i felt would suit our tastes.. i cut down on the oil, just giving it a splash.. i used low sodium soy sauce and left the regular salt out all together as i worried it would be a bit salty.. also subbed celery seed for the celery salt and reduced the dill to 1/16 tsp as i remember it being overpowering in the Oregon Herb Rub.. i used this on two large boneless pork chops totaling 1.5 lbs.. i marinated for about 8 hours.. then had bf grilled these up.. i was hoping for something more.. bf said he liked it.. i wasn't too thrilled and actually gave him half of my pork chop.. maybe using all soy sauce instead of worcestershire and leaving out the dill entirely would have worked better for me

Marinade tasted great! It didn't replace my very favorite but it was still very tasty. No extra seasonings or sauces were needed with dinner. I marinaded for about 5 hours and broiled in the oven. It would certainly be tasty on the grill.
