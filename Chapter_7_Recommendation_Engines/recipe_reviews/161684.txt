Made this for my mom for her birthday and I have to say it turned out very, very well!  Frying the onions properly took a bit of work but the rest of the recipe was easily assembled.   To me it comes across as an extremely filling comfort food and that is exactly what my family was looking for.   I'll definitely be making this one again.

This is my second year in a row using Jessica's Real Green Bean recipe for Easter and my family can't get enough. The homemade onion rings really set this dish apart from others.  I recommend leaving out the sugar and adding a dash of garlic salt to the flour and pepper base.
