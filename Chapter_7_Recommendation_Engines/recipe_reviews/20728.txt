Excellent! If you're looking for a classic lime daiquiri for yourself or for guests, this will be a big hit for all. We didn't change a thing for our monthly neighborhood Mexican night, and everyone raved!!

Pretty good.  I rimmed the glass with sugar and decreased the rum to 9 ounces.  I felt that 12 ounces would've been way too much for me.  I prefer the "Best Strawberry Daiquiri" recipe from this site.  If I want a frozen lime drink, I'll stick with the "Margaritas" on this site.  I think that coconut rum, as mentioned by another reviewer, is an excellent idea!

I really liked this.  My husband feel in love with lime daiquiri's when we were on our honeymoon, and has been begging me to make him one.  This tasted just like the ones we had in Mexico!

This was tasty enough.  The appeal of this recipe is that it is really easy.  It is good for a quick throw-together.  The problems the adults in our family had with this was first, it was too sweet.  We ended up adding a lot more ice.  I think the sparkling water one other reviewer used would probably have helped a lot with the sweetness.  Two, it was very strong.  I cut the rum down to 8 oz instead of twelve, and even then it was potent.  I think this recipe is a good place to start, but definitely needs some tweaking.

Update:  I made this again.  I only use HALF the concentrate.  I used seltzer water to make up the difference, plus a bit extra until it was more of a slushy consistency rather than thick.  Again, only 8 oz of the alcohol, not twelve.  I also added in a couple of limes wedges, without peel, into the blender and blended that all in.  Now it is the perfect daiquiri.  I hate rating a recipe when I have changed it up so much.  But this was a good start. Just wrong proportions.
