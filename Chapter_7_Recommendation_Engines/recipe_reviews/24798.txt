A very good recipe!  Not sure why some others found it bland - I found the balance of flavors from the oregano and basil to be quite savory.  Also, cooked for the full 8 hours, and found the chicken breast to be tender and succulent.  I topped it with a few teaspoons of grated parmesan cheese on each serving.

This was easy to prepare but the taste was very boring. It is not something I would make again.

Yummy!  This gets 4 stars because my kids (4 & 18 mo) scarfed it down.  I did add some cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce, otherwise - wonderful!

was very time consuming having to chop up so much stuff.
It came out like soup and tasted nothing like pizza. It just seemed to watery.

I wrote this recipe and have adjusted some things after seeing the reviews and cooking it several more times.  Adjust the seasonings appropriately, more than likely, a tsp of each will be fine.  Forget the water & if the soups are too thick, add some chicken broth or white wine.  Cook in the crockpot only 6 hours at most; I had some turn out tough and rubbery, yuck!  I've also tried this with chicken breast cut into cubes and also boneless thighs, which create a different flavor, but still good.  Fresh herbs work well but only add them the last hour of cooking or they will turn brown and unrecognizable.  
Thanks for all your reviews!  Even the negative ones.  One cannot grow without critisizm!

Very easy to make.  My family loved the pizza flavor.  Over rice or noodles this makes a great dinner.

This was ok. I think that it called for too much oregano and basil. It was a nice warm meal, but I don't think I'll make it very often.

I thought this recipe was bad. Neither myself nor my husband liked it and we only ate a couple bits a piece.  Might be okay if we just used spaghetti sauce, spices and the chicken instead.

It didn't really taste like much. It was very bland. I added some cornstarch to make it thicker and served over pasta. My husband and I think that it is an okay meal, but I wouldn't make it again. The chicken was very dry and I cooked it for 7 hours instead of the 8 hours.

The chicken, after the huge 8 hour stint, was a bit dry.  I took the liberty of adding a few ingredients to make it more appealing.  Overall, I thought the flavor was rich, but very humble with a lack of punch that generally marks slow-cooker foods.  I will make it again, but I will alter the recipe slightly.

I found the chicken to be tender, but tasted dry.  Smelled great, but the kids were not too thrilled.  Not a hit with my family. The overall taste of it was savory, simple to make.

I made it exactly as written, and found the results to be good enough, but nothing special. In my book, this gets a 3-star rating - not bad, but there are better recipes out there. It did come out fairly soupy (or saucy), so I had some of the leftovers on a bed of cooked long-grain white rice. To be fair, it's probably fairly healthy, with the chicken and various vegetables, but it just didn't impress me all that much.

We liked this, but we did make some changes to the recipe. We added a lot of S&P to the raw chicken & we left the breasts whole instead of dicing them b/c we were hoping they would better retain their moisture & they did. We use organic products & for some reason there aren't organic condensed soups, so we used a 15 oz can of cream of tomato soup & a 15 oz can cream of mushroom soup (which is 'semi condensed'), leaving out the H20. We used canned mushrooms in place of the celery like other reviewers suggested. I think if our herbs were fresher it would have had a lot more flavor, but I'll admit it, we're cheap & we're using up what we've got! We took the chicken out of the crock pot, took a 1/2 cup of sauce, stirred in 2T of cornstarch & then poured that back into the rest of the sauce in the crock pot, turning it on high, stirring it occasionally to thicken it. We served this on a bed of penne & we topped it w/mozzarella (our son used goat's feta instead & loved that too). We have quite a lot leftover, so we're planning on working on adding more flavor to the sauce before we serve the rest of it later on this week. I was worried we were getting too liberal w/the S&P, but I think the H20 that comes out of the veggies & the chicken really makes the salt fade into the background, so don't be afraid to use a lot of seasoning.

This wasn't the most exciting meal I've ever made, but it's a good mid-week, kid friendly satisfying dish.  The only thing I did differently was adding a good bit of chili powder to the mix to taste.  It added a little more bite of flavor and added the taste I expected to find when I smelled it.  I used this as a topping for rotini pasta.

Overall, a good meal!

It was okay. Thought it tasted more like pizza BEFORE cooking. Turned out like a thin chili/stew.

Full of spices and delicious.  If you have picky eaters you could half the amount of spices and I think you could even substitute beef for chicken.  A great comfort meal.  I served with baked potatoes and it was excellent.

I was excited to try this new recipe.  If anything tastes like Pizza and is healthy my family will love it.  I decided to add a few more veggies - I added a can of stewed tomatoes and used a bag of chicken tenders (Perdue).  It was very tasty but we all agreed that it tasted a lot like Chicken Cacciatore.  The chicken melted in your mouth.  I will probably make it again but will play a bit with the recipe to actually try to get it to taste like yummy pizza.

I threw this recipe together very quickly and it it turned out great! I didn't have the peppers, but it was good without. 
Some are saying it was bland. It wasn't BURSTING with flavor, but it was nice just the same. We ate it with toast. and next time i'm going to add mushrooms and maybe use a little less oregeno.
Overall, very tasty!!

This was really bad.  We threw it all away.  It was very runny and looked like soup.  We tried to put it on some rice and that still didn't help.  My husband who normally eats everything wouldn't even eat it.  I would not recommend making this.  There are lots of other recipest

Excellent! I am not a big fan of chicken but this was great!  We used chicken legs with backs attached, and substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom soup.

Awesome!  I tried it a couple of times to try to get it right and I found that cooking it for 6 hours was good.  I also served it over egg noodles and sprinkled shredded mozzerella cheese on top.  The kids enjoyed it and so did my husband.

I made it for a group of 10, 6 of which were children 12 and under, and I used thighs  instead of beasts, using 14 thighs. I also in creased to the amount of soups by 2 times as well as the other ingredients. We all felt it needed more salt than I added  but otherwise I will definitely fox it again. And I fixed rice for it to go over.

I made this and it was a huge hit! Instead of tomato soup I used a can of stewed tomatoes and I also used garlic. Instead of cutting the chicken into cubes I left them as is and close to the end of the cook time I added some mozzarella cheese. Full of flavor and my picky 2 year old loved it!!
