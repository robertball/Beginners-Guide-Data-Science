This was my first time ever making frog legs and only my second time to ever try them. I made as written and they were excellent! Not sure how these tasted like plastic to the other reviewer? They tasted like frog legs to me and darn good ones at that. I made these along with fried oysters and fried clams for my hubby's birthday dinner and  he said that these stole the show. I preferred them dipped in cocktail sauce but he liked them with the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site. Thanks for sharing AnimalWhiz!

My husband saw frog legs at the store, gave me that look, and so here we are.  I've never in my life tried or cooked frog legs but I was pleasantly surprised with these!  We followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using corn oil because that's all we had, and they came out nicely.  We served them with homemade cocktail sauce and jumped in (see what I've done there?)  
A squirt of lemon once they came out of the fryer would be good but not necessary.  Great recipe and I'll be danged if I don't actually like frog legs!

Made as directed but left the skin on.  I would never fry chicken w/ the skin removed.  Same holds true to FL's.  Make sure you salt and pepper well, it does make a difference.

My husband wanted frog legs, but if you're not feeling adventurous enough to try them... use chicken with this recipe instead. Wonderful breading for frying. Paired with the "Dipping Sauce" on this site with the horseradish. So good!

I didn't make as many as called for for only two people.  I loved the flavor the saltines gave it.  I did not have cornmeal, and they still tasted delicious.  I did not use as much oil as it called for, way too much.  I sauteed them so it took a little longer and weren't greasy. I cook frog legs often and this will be my new  coating to use. It did not fall off  during frying.

This was my first time making these. My son requested fried frog legs as part of his food 'bucket list', so when I saw them in the store I had to get them. I'm so glad that I decided on this recipe...they were delicious! The kids LOVED these...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect!! I added some Old Bay (because Iâ€™m from Maryland, so of course!) and dressed with Sriracha/Miracle Whip sauce. They were a hit!

Didn't have saltines, used panko crumbs instead. Added garlic powder and szechuan spice, liberally squeezed on fresh lemon before serving.

We made these last night.  They were excellent.  Quick and easy.  For part of the crackers we substituted with some bread crumbs because we were short some crackers.  Highly recommend this recipe.

The only issue I had was I should have cooked all of the legs. They were oh so good!

I modified this for an Egg/dairy/wheat/gluten free diet and added garlic powder & cajun seasoning. To die for!
