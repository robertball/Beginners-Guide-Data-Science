Made these for Recipe Group...We LOVED them! I 1/2'd the recipe, but that was my only change. I have a horrible time making 'stuffed' burgers normally, but these worked out perfectly. Great flavor! I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group Review 6/29/13: Weighed my burger halves and pressed them into circles and followed the recipe as is. Wonderful melt inside the burger and the taste was not overwhelming. Cooked very quickly as each side is thinner. My camera was not available but I can tell you that slicing Italian bread, also grilled, and adding a big slice of roasted Pepper sure did make a pretty burger. Its a keeper.

Recipe Group Selection:  29, June 2013 ~ A delicious burger that I made with bleu cheese in some and feta cheese in the others, for my bleu cheese hating hubby and son.  I added a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce to help hold the burgers together.  Once I put the burgers together, I put a thumb print indentation in the middle of the burger on the top side and the bottom side.  I learned from ‘thebuzz’ that this would help the burgers from shrinking up during the grilling time.  It worked perfectly!  The heat and grill time was spot on this recipe.  They held together very nicely and kept the cheese sealed in the middle.  I served these on bagel thins with corn on the cob and ‘Paige’s Feta Slaw’ from AR.  A great burger that will be made again.  The guys loved theirs made with feta cheese.

Made these for our 4th of July party and they turned out wonderfully. I’m not a huge fan of blue cheese, but everyone enjoyed them so I’m likely to give them a try again in the future!

Made this for Wednesday night dinner I had with a friend. It came out so well! I replaced the salt and pepper with Montreal Steak sauce. It was so juicy and delicious and my friend loved it too! Definitely making it again soon!
