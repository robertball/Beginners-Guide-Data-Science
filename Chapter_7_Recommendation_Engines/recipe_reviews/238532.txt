This yields a very tender roast.  Mine was done in 6 hours, and it fell apart when removing it from the cooker.  I wished for a bit more flavor, and I believe that less liquid would help.  I did brown the roast for better color before putting it in the crock.

I made this and thought it was very flavorful, can’t believe someone said it lacked flavor. This has become a household favorite.  Love all the broth, just added a little cornstarch slurry to extra and it made an awesome gravy to go over the roast and mashed potatoes!

I loved it after I made some changes to the recipe!  First I cut the beef broth down to 1 cup and the vegetable broth down to 1/2 cup and added a heaping teaspoon full of "Better Than Bouillon" to it then I added more salt, more pepper and garam masala and two more onions and 3 more garlic cloves because I love garlic.  I thought it was great after giving it more flavor we ate on it for two nights.

I skipped the veg broth because I didn’t have any, was still delicious!  Fall-apart tender and made awesome sandwiches all week.  (The sandwiches were even better with a little bbq sauce.)

Very tender. I Checked it after 8 hours. It may have been done sooner. I did not have vegetable broth so I used all beef broth. I felt it lacked flavor so I might add some spices and definitely try the vegetable broth next time. I might use a can of golden mushroom soup to replace one can of broth or add a little wine.

Very basic recipe needs some extra spices but other than that good.
