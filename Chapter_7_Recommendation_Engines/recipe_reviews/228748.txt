Very good! I used non-fat Greek yogurt. I marinated it overnight and cooked it on my GF grill since it was raining out. Next time, we will grill it. I can't wait for the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe.

We enjoyed this chicken. To make the chicken more flavorful I made these changes and it was delicious:
 Per 3 chicken breasts, I used a 5oz container of  Greek yogurt and mixed these ingredients right in the container in addition to the ingredients in the recipe. Added 1/2 teaspoon of Cavender's Greek Seasoning, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper (omitted the black pepper) to the yogurt marinade. I put the chicken in a ziploc bag and added the yogurt marinade and coated the chicken in the bag. The 5oz container of yogurt was the perfect amount of yogurt to cover 3 chicken breasts. I grilled it on the GF grill, and then topped with the feta cheese and sliced kalamata olives before serving. The yogurt marinade made the chicken moist and tender and it was much more flavorful with the Greek seasoning. This is definitely a keeper.

Very good!  I added lemon juice and salt and pepper to the marinade and had it in the fridge for 24 hours.  The feta was a nice touch!  Used as the base for pita sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, onion and greek yogurt cucumber sauce from this site, nice weeknight meal!

I did not follow the quantities exactly as I never measure. I needed some inspiration to use up rotisserie chicken I had left and greek yogurt and feta crumbles that were going to expire. I happened onto this recipe. I mixed everything and put over cold rotisserie chicken for lunch. Amazing! I know I will try it using it as a grill marinade and I am sure I will love it too. I am almost positive I ended up using more oregano than called for though and I imagine I would do this again. I loved the garlic and oregano flavor with the yogurt.

Delicious! But I didn't follow thge recipe exactly. It would have been too bland. added salt and fresh basil instead of oregano and parsley. Also cut chicken into thin slices since I couldn't marinade for long (just two hours). Came out very flavorful and feta was a beautiful touch.

Followed recipe exactly. It was just OK. We thought it lacked flavor. It tasted like a garlic chicken. I think it needs stronger spices than garlic and oregano. To go with the yogurt I think some hot chile paste might add some color and heat. It has potential, but with so many good chicken recipes on this site I don't think I will make this again without making major changes

Love this recipe. It was from Bon Appietit magazine back in the early 90's.
