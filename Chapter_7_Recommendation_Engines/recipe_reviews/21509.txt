This sauce is excellent! I used a pork roast and didn't cut it up ahead of time. I just put everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 8 hours. The meat turned out so tender, i just shredded right before I served it - super easy!

OH MAN IS THIS GOOD! I used a 5lb pork shoulder roast, doubled the recipe, put the FROZEN roast in the crock put and cooked about 11 hours. Shredded it and EVERYONE raved! Even my 12 year VERY VERY VERY picky nephew asked for seconds! I'm can hardly wait to make this again!

This recipe made my house smell just like a BBQ restaurant!  I used boneless country style ribs and sliced diagonally, then packed the sugar VERY lightly and used 1 cup BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup. (I used the crockpot method). We ate our sandwiches on lightly toasted bolillo rolls with lots of dill pickle slices.  These taste like the real deal, and would be a very low maintenance, low stress way to feed a crowd.  We'll be using this again very soon!

I was very nervous about making this recipe...it just looked odd in the pot.  I wish I hadn't listened to some of the other reviewers and cut back on the brown sugar.  The finished result was great and was the hit of the party.  Next time I will use the alloted amount of brown sugar.  Yummy! thanks for the sharing the recipe!!!

Absolutely delish!  I've made this 3 times and it comes out perfect every time.  I did make one change.  Instead of adding 2 cups of ketchup, I add 1 cup of barbeque sauce and 1 cup of ketchup to add some spice.  2 cups of ketchup was a bit too sweet for my family.

I seasoned my meat (pork loin & boneless ribs) with seasoning salt, garlic powder, pepper, Accent, and a touch of chili powder.  In the sauce I added about 1/2 cup of commercial bbq sauce, an extra clove garlic, and about 2 t. liquid smoke.  I cooked the night before in crock pot (smell was incredible) and refrigerated so I could skim grease off next day.  Meat was very flavorful and tender.

When I made this for a Super Bowl party, we took it piping hot out of the crock pot and put it on buns.  It was pretty good, but it didn't seem that special.  When my husband went back for a midnight snack and reheated it, he ate it straight out of the bowl and couldn't stop raving about it!  (He had three helpings!) The flavors blended together and the sauce thickened up once it had a chance to cool off.  Next time I will take it out of the crock pot and let it cool down before serving.  Hubby says this is a keeper!

Exquisite recipe.  I used the slow cooker version with a 5lb. pork shoulder and made a little mistake by doubling pretty much everything.  So for those of you who use a larger piece of meat, it isn't necessary to use that much ketchup/bbq sauce as it came a little too runny.  And I did use half ketchup and half bbq sauce...tasted delicious.  

Wonderful on homemade hamburger rolls (recipe is also listed on All Recipes! :) )

OMG.....It amazes me that someone uses chicken breast to make a bbq pork recipe, and then isn't pleased with the results. This is a GREAT recipe just the way it is, but it's also very easy to customize. Add a few different spices or fruits to turn it into any ethnic flavor you like. Mexican...cumin and chiles, Italian...basil and fennil, Oriental...soy sauce and ginger,   Polenesian...pineapple. Very versatile.

I've made this a lot, and it's wonderful! Don't try to slice it until it's done. If it's cooked properly, it will just about fall off the bone on it's on.  I also want to say, that if you aren't doing the recipe, why would you rate it at all, let alone rated it sub par?  This recipe is for a PORK roast, not boneless skinless chicken breasts.  They don't even compare, and can't really be cooked the same. It's NOT the recipe, so how can you review it??? Sorry, had to get that off my chest,lol.  Anyway, back to the pork roast... As I was saying, don't shred it until it's done. I also add a little liquid smoke to mine to give it a more bbq flavor.

This was pretty good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Not sure if I'll make it again.  Taste was ordinary.

I am a professional caterer specializing in BBQ for the past 15 years.  This is a great basic recipe for the stove top or crock pot.  You might want to slow cook the pork with just some beer or broth (I prefer beer)and when finished remove the pork from the juice, pull the pork and add BBQ sauce.  Depending on the amount of juice you may want to mix some back in to keep the pork very moist.  I top this sandwich with our cole slaw.  That's right, right on top of the pork.  Yum

This was SOOO delicious! My entire family loved the smell that permeated my house (I cooked it using a slower cooker) and the sweet, sticky flavor of the final product. I followed the directions for the most part, although I used a heaping teaspoonful and a half of grainy djion mustard instead of the dry and used about a cup of beef stock since I was a little short on ketchup. I didn't slice the pork shoulder either and used a bone-in piece. I cooked it on high for a few hours because mine was still pretty frozen and then turned it down to low for the remaining hours. After shredding the meat (which was amazingly easy) I spooned the extra sauce over and mixed it in. I didn't want too much sauce, so I shredded the pork in a large serving bowl. No leftovers for the three of us!!

This was very moist and flavorful. I had a 7 1/2 lb pork shoulder picnic (bone in) that I used. I put the whole thing in the slow cooker. I wouldn't recommend this specific cut of meat as it was quite time consuming shredding it and yeilds a lot less meat than I thought it would. That said, it worked in a pinch and the taste was great! I had to add a about a cup of  Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce cause I didn't have quite enough ketchup for the amount of pork I had. It's very good and flavorful once you add the sauce back to the shredded pork. I still have alot of sauce left over. :)

My family loved this recipe. I used 1/2 bbq 1/2 catsup as recommended.  If you're new to big hunks of pork, trim the fat if you're using pork shoulder.

I love this recipe!!! I did a pulled pork day to raise money at work. Everyone signed up and loved this pork. I had to give them the recipe! I made a couple little changes though. I find that any Pork cut usually works as long as there is no bone. I used 2 cloves of garlic,2 tsp dry mustard, no salt (I try to cut it out when it is not necessary), and I used 3/4 cup ketchup, and 3/4 cup bbq sauce because I wanted more of a bbq flavour.

Excellent recipe.  My dad loves this and its like pulling teeth to get him to eat pork.  I use bone in pork shoulder for this recipe and I simply take the meat of the bone and cut it into 2 inch chunks.  Then I place everything, including the bone, into the crock pot and forget about it for a few hours. SO GOOD.

This was an amazing recipe! The only change I made was I added a dash (aprox 1 T) of red wine vinegar because my husband likes the little bit of bite it gives. Yummy! I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

This recipe was amazing, by far the best bbq pork sandwich I have ever eaten, and my family loves it as much as I do!  I have made this four or five times this month because my family asks for it, give it a try in the crock pot, you wont be disappointed!

5 stars, this recipe was super simple and relatively quick for the stove top method. I followed this recipe to the letter and it was awesome. It took about 2 1/2 on the stove top, then I took the pork out and pulled it apart with two forks as suggested by other reviewers and then returned the pork to the sauce. Because I like a thicker sauce I cooked the sauce uncovered till I got it to reduce to the thickness I like, no cornstarch required :) Thanks for the recipe!

Me likey.  I also used 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of home made BBQ sauce.  I cooked it in the crock and did NOT pre-cook and drain it like others suggested and it came out great.  I just trimed the fat off before I threw it in the crock.  -Big Jesse

Great! Made with pork loin b/c it was on sale - threw all ingedients, including entire loin, plus lots of extra garlic and onion into crock pot in the morning before work. I shredded pork when I got home and I used more bbq sauce than ketchup and served it on toasted buns. Great leftovers too!

I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the recipe for a frozen 5 pound roast then cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 10 hours. It was delicious! the meat just fell apart. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing!

(Hubby review!) My wife just made this. It's delicious. Let it sit overnight and reheat it, that really brings out the flavour. She substituted 1 cup of BBQ sauce for some of the ketchup for a bit more zip!

Sooooooooooooo good. Can't wait for leftovers. I also did the half ketchup, half bbq sauce because I love bbq sauce and it turned out so yummy. Only drawback is the onions didn't get as cooked as I would have liked them. I will definitely make this again.

**EDIT: I forgot to mention that I haven't actually used this sauce on pork shoulder. Most of the time I throw it on rotisserie chicken meat I've pulled from the bone and I did use it once on pork ribs.

Based on other reviews I used 1c ketchup and 1c bbq sauce.  I loved it!  My husband wants me to use a spicier bbq sauce, which I will do the next time I make this (I have no problem with that request).  The sauce was full of flavor, so much tastier than just dumping in regular bbq sauce.  I served this over baked potatoes with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  I cooked it in the crockpot and it smelled so good that I could hardly wait for dinner.

I have used this basic recipe many times.  Sometimes I use pork, other times beef, both are wonderful.  For substitutions I used:  1 cup of ketchup; 3/4 cup bbq sauce; 1/4 cup vinegar; 3 tbs liquid smoke; 2 big cloves of garlic.  I cooked the pork in my crock pot seasoned slightly with pepper and chili powder in chicken broth.  After about 8 hours, drain the chicken broth, break up the meat and put in the refrigerator in the sauce overnight.  I brought this recipe to a cook off and won hands down.  Everyone was raving about it.

Wow this was incredible!!!! U must try. My house smells so delicious. I made one adjustment since the sauce was almost as perfect as my own sauce I just added a little liquid smoke and lots more garlic bc i love garlic and 1 cup of water with a beef cube. We had it with a can of bush baked beans and a tossed salad with dressing.  Quick and easy. My only suggestion would be double the sauce just in case you would like a little more for the side. My son and I loved it w/o extra sauce but my hubs would want more sauce. Great great recipe. Thank you, I was beginning to wonder if I would ever find a recipe I would like for pulled pork this is outstanding.

I made the crock pot version and cut my shoulder into 1/2" cubes. I also did one cup of ketchup and one cup of honey BBQ sauce instead of two cups of ketchup.  One word: WOW!  The flavor was AMAZING.  We ate the meat on soft potato rolls and gobbled them down.  Next time, I think I'll try using a larger chunk of meat and shredding it after cooking for a different texture.

Also, this recipe freezes extremely well.  Yum!

definitely nothing wrong with this recipe, it is very good.  i gave it 4 stars just because there are other recipes similar to this one on this website that are better.  great recipe though, and extremely easy to make.  the only thing about the pork shoulder is its fatty and i dont care for the extra work of trimming it.  also, the sauce didnt thicken up so even with straining it, it'll make your sandwich soggy.

This was really good. Everyone went back for seconds. I started my roast by cutting it into steaks and grilling them with alder wood chips for a smoky flavor. I then put the sauce together in the pan and cut the steaks into big chunks and threw it in there. I knew it would take several hours to cook but I wanted to speed up the process a bit. I added a 6 oz can of pineapple juice (the enzymes help break down the meat) and a TBS of molasses along with some smoked and regular paprika. The sauce as written was excellent which is why I gave it five stars. If you want it spicier; add more pepper or cut a jalapeno in half and let it simmer with the meat. The additions I made later were good too and were done to speed up the process (I was hungry)  Wonderful sauce as written. Thanks Kimber.

Love this recipe! It's a new staple in my kitchen. I took the suggestion of using 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of barbeque sauce. Use a smokey BBQ sauce for the best flavour... in my opinion!

Very easy- made adjustments by adding cajun spice, a bottle of hard apple cider, a small amount of honey and Spanish paprika, and halving the ketchup with bbq sauce as indicated by previous reviewers. I did slice the pork in large chunks since I had six pounds of pork shoulder and wanted to make sure the liquid adequately covered all parts.  Served with Boudin rolls- very easy for company.

I omit the onions for a light dusting of onion powder and cook on high for 5 hours. The amount of sauce used is perfect and doesn't make for a watery sauce in the end. This is now my 'go to' recipie for pulled pork.

I recently made this recipe with a few changes based on the other reviews.  Since I threw this together before before work for the sake of time I left the pork whole, fat side up.  When I got home from work, I literally peeled the fat layer off (gross i know) and just stirred it with a wooden spoon and it literally fell apart.  After breaking the pork apart I turned the cooker to high with the lid off to allow the sauce thicken up a bit.    I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce and about 1tbsp of honey to give it that extra bbq flavor.  I had seen other pulled pork recipes that added either chicken stock or beer so I opted for a bottle of beer to add some more liquid.   My boyfriend who loves bbq wished it had more of a smokey bbq flavor so next time I may use a different bbq sauce and maybe add some paprika to give it that flavor.  All and all the I thought the recipe came out great.

Good dinner, especially if you don't have time.  Made recipe exactly as called for, but was slightly too watery.  Just took the lid off the crock pot for the last hour and it thickened up a bit.

I make this ALL the time!  I use a roast and don't even bother to slice it first.  I just put all the ingredients in and let it work.  When it's all done I stir it up and the pork is so tender it just shreds while I stir it!  We have eaten this on rolls, over rice, and for the rare times there are leftovers we scoop it up with tortilla chips.

I thought this recipe was very good.  My husband liked it but he thought it was too sweet for his taste.  I put the pork shoulder in frozen and let it cook overnight for about 13 hours.  Easy recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of not slicing the meat before cooking, and using about 3.5# pork shoulder but not doubling the sauce.  This was really good. A thinner, sweetish tomato sauce (not thick like bottled BBQ) accenting melt in your mouth pork perfectly slow cooked. Even my 7 yr old liked it. This one is a keeper for us!  Thank you!!

Awesome!!! I always double the recipe and slow cook it in a crockpot overnight. After shredding the pork I let it cook and soak up the sauce for another couple of hours. Super easy and always a hit on football Sundays. :)

This was really good.  My only problem with it was that the meat was very fatty.  I'm not a very experienced cook so I'm not sure if the shoulder is very fatty or if it was just my cut.  The fattiness I think affected the overall flavor but it was still very good.  I'm going to see if there would be a better substitute to avoid the fattiness next time.

Awesome bbq recipe!  I made this for my son's 10th bday party -I cooked 2 - 11 lb pork shoulders several days ahead of time so I wasnt shredding pork the day of the party.  I slow cooked the pork in the oven with onion, celery, seasonings, then shredded and placed in fridge.  On the day of the party I mixed the brown sugar, dry mustard, salt pepper, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce with the pork in the crockpot.  I just multiplied the amount based on the amount of pork I had.  Absolutely tasty and perfect, tastes just like a great bbq sauce - so if you have a good sale on ketchup, it's a great alternative to bbq sauce!

This recipe is excellent. I used a few tablespoons of spicy mustart instead of mustard seed and tossed in a packet of taco seasoning for pulled pork tacos it came out perfect. delicious.

Amazing!!!  I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, salt & pepper and froze it. Then I mixed up all the other ingredients and put it in the fridge the night before. I put everything in the crock pot before work. 12 hours later the pork was so tender & juicy it fell off the bones. My husband just raved about it!! This will be a staple in our house!

I LOVED this one. I made the portion a lot larger with a 6 pound pork shoulder and cooked it in the crock pot on low for 10 hours. I took the advice of past reviewers and did half ketchup and half jack daniels bbq sauce. My husband and one of his friends raved about the flavor. I will definitly be making this one agagin

Thanks sooo much, Kimber! Your recipe has been a staple for about 2 years. (In fact, this may be my second review—good!-the dish deserves extra praise.) Particularly during football season, when friends gather for games, I'm grateful for the ease of both prep & service, not to mention that everyone adores this, served on top-quality buns with a simple green salad. Three things I'll point out: (1) This is doable with any number of pork cuts--yesterday it was pork loin sirloin, on sale last week. (2) Since the meat will fall apart, (and off the bone if one uses a bone-in cut), pre-slicing may be unnecessary--I don't bother, in any case. (3) This is extremely economical. Yesterday I followed your recipe exactly except for doubling the onion & adding  1 T. chili powder -- despite 6 hungry guests (some of whom had more than one helping), my husband & I have leftovers enough for tonight’s meal.

I used 1c ketchup and 1c Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and I still used the Worcester sauce (don't know if I was supposed to or not!) and it came out GREAT.  A little bit on the sweet side, but that may be due to the BBQ sauce that I used. This recipe was wonderful, and I used pork shoulder country style ribs and sliced those into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces just as the recipe states. Thanks for sharing this, it's definitely a keeper!!!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  This turned out great!!  I made a huge roast worth, so I cut a large pork tenderloin into 4 smaller roasts and slow cooked that way.  I will probably slice down even more next time to speed along the shredding process (we made this into pulled pork instead of the sliced pork).  It was fantastic and I can't wait to try it again!

I cut back on the ketchup like some other users said and I should not have. I also added a little more worchestire, sugar, mustard and a little liquid smoke flavoring and it turned out great.

This was ok. It was very flavorful, but the meat was not as tender as i thought it would be. I did it the stove top way. Next time i will try it in the slow cooker

I couldn't find a whole shoulder at my grocery store so I bought shoulder steaks and just didn't slice them. I cooked it with the bone in for extra flavor, then removed it after cooking. This was fabulous and I will definately make it again and again.

This was a huge hit with my family and guests! I cut some of the fat off the shoulder before cooking - just the really big portions. And I stuck it in the oven for about 20 minutes or so to crisp up the tops of the meat just before eating as I'd seen done in some recipes - so good!

Great recipe!  We took the advice of one reviewer and cooked the pork in the slow cooker with water and beef boullion cubes.  Then we pulled it out, shredded it, and added the sauce.  (For the sauce, we sauteed the onions and garlic in a saucepan, then added the rest of the ingredients and simmered.  We also used bottled bbq sauce for part of the ketchup allotment)  We had a 4 lb pork shoulder and scaled the recipe for 13 servings- however, there was more sauce than necessary.  I'd say use about 2/3 the amount of ketchup/bbq sauce that it calls for.

Used an 8lb boston cut pork shoulder.  I doubled the sauce, as many thought doubling their's for their 5lb meat made it watery, I figured I could afford to double but not triple mine.  I didn't start early enough (I used slow cooker) to let it completely cool & reheat as some said it helped the taste.  But I did take out meat to shred meat & put crock (juices only) outside to cool & seperate the fat a bit.  That decreased the sauce quite a bit, so I replaced the meat in the crock & added additional bottled sauce (I originally used 1/2 ketchup-1/2 bottled bbq sauce to help reduce sweetness---definately recommend.)  Let it reheat on high until ready to serve.  Used during Super Bowl & family LOVED it.  Oh, and I also sauted the finely chopped onions in butter prior to adding at the beginning.

I made this twice this weekend for my boyfriend and me. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used prepared mustard, I used 2x's as much prepared mustard for ever portion of dry mustard). I halved the recipe and it still came out perfect. The sauce was delicious, pork was tender. I definitely recommend this recipe! It was SUPER easy and delicious.

So good.  Used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup BBQ sauce instead.  Also added cayenne.  Gave it a little kick.  Will make often.

The sauce tasted great and gave the meat a nice flavor. Just a helpful hint--if your slow cooker is relatively large, make sure you AT LEAST double the sauce if you plan on cooking it on low for many hours. I came home from work and the sauce was a black tar on the sides of my pot because my husband put it in the slow cooker in the morning and didn't have the previous knowledge to know that you would need more sauce in there. Nothing at all wrong with the recipe, but this could help save people new to using a crock pot!!! I was able to save the meat by shredding it, putting it on the stove and adding some more bbq sauce and broth to bring back some moisture.

I read the reviews on this one and took a detour.    I really did not have time to mix the ingredients listed in the recipe, so, after reading other reviews, I took a chance and just mixed equal parts of Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce and Ketchup; about 1 cup each.  Brushed it over the meat and crossed my fingers.  That's it.    Left it for 7 hours [no peeking], turned it off and let it cool a bit.  The pork shoulder fell apart & was so tender.  I shredded it and mixed with the sauces that had brewed in the crock pot all day and let it set a little longer.  I added a dash or two of coarse salt.   I am telling you it was amazing.  Actually, I could not believe it was that good since I had modified the recipe -- plus, it was even better the next day.  My only footnote is that the sugars in the bbq/ketchup burned a little on the sides of the crock pot, but there was still enough sauce to mix with the meat.  My picky husband absolutely loved it.

I cut up a 3.5 lb shoulder in the crock pot. Put the ingredients in,exact to recipe. It seemed to cook fast. After a few hours, I got hard lumps of pork. Disappointed, I kept it cooking and went out for dinner. Came home that night and threw the whole crock pot in the refrigerator and cooked it for a few more hours the next day. (total about 8.) Let it cool then it shred perfectly and was the most delicious pulled pork sandwhich I ever had!!!

Wonderful flavors and so easy to make using a slow cooker. It was a little saucy for my taste, so next time I'll reduce the ketchup to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup barbeque sauce (I used Original KC Masterpiece and it lent a nice smokiness to the finished dish). Another thing I'll change next time will be to put the meat in the pot last. Then I'll turn it to coat all over with the sauce. Other than that, this recipe is very good. Oh, and I served this on a hearty slice of whole grain buttered toast and a romaine salad on the side. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This was awesome. One garlic clove didn't seem enough so I used 4(small)ones,and we still didn't taste it. I didn't have quite enough worcestershire sauce so I added the missing amount of bbq sauce. The were So good. I will defnitely make this again and I have a slightly tough cut of beef roast so I will try that instead.

OMG this was so good. Perfect sauce/pork ratio. Flavor was right on. Just what i was looking for. I slow simmered my pork on the stove for 7 hrs.and it fell of the bone and shredded easily. No need to pre slice. Will make this again soon!

I've been using Allrecipes for years but never became a member. This recipe, however, is so yummy I joined Allrecipes so I could tell everyone else how good it is!
I've made it numerous times now. Sometimes I didn't have enough ketchup so I substituted bottled barbecue sauce for what I lacked. Most of the time I substituted dried onions for the fresh for lack of time. Freezes well. We serve it on toasted buns with cheese and lettuce. Sometimes even in fried corn tortillas as taco filling. YUM!!

Since we made this recipe, we've been enjoying barbeque pork sandwiches for dinner, three nights in a row now! (How quickly college makes you appreciate leftovers...) I replaced 2/3 of the ketchup with barbeque sauce. Also, my batch was very watery about 2 hours before we were to eat, so I took the lid of my crock pot and it evaporated nicely to become thick and delicious.

This is pretty good.  I made recipe as is and cooked for 7 hours.  Will cut back to 6 hours next time because pork was starting to get dry.  Still great flavor and my 5 year old said "this chicken is good, Mom"!  Ha Ha.  Will definately make again.  Thanks Kimber

Delicious and easy recipe.  I made this exactly as listed and it was great!  The sauce is very similar to the recipe my mother-in-law gave me and we use it on everything we want to grill and barbeque.(Super on grilled chicken).  I never thought to use it with pork sanwiches.  Thanks Kimber, for the great idea!

I cooked as some others suggested, with less ketchup and more barbecue sauce,and additionally then shredded the pork with two forks after 8 hours.  It came out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I also reduced the ketchup to 1 cup and added more garlic.  Tastes much better as leftovers the next day.  My ten year old meat lover wasn't impressed though.

This is delicious!  I start it after dinner (I like using pork loin roast when I can get it on sale--much less fat to trim!) and let it cook on the stovetop at a simmer for 2 1/2 hrs.  Then I shred it and refrigerate it.  Can't get any easier or better than this!

We just didn't care for it. The sauce was thin and we didn't like the flavor.

Super simple recipe. The smell in my house was so delicious. Made it for my daughters rodeo party. It was a HIT with teenagers and adults. I used boneless chuck steak, in oven at 325•  baked for 8hrs, it came out so tender and meat shredded easy. I definitely recommend this, 5-stars!

This is an excellent recipe! I don't have a slow cooker, so I have been searching for a stove top recipe for pulled pork. This one works beautifully! I sliced the pork and cooked it for 2 1/2 hours. The only thing I changed was cutting the ketchup down to 1 cup and adding a cup of BBQ sauce. Delicious! Will definitely be making it again.

Have made this quite a few times.  Follow recipe as written, in crockpot, day before serving.  Shred meat, refrigerate juices till you can remove most of the fat.  Add back just enough juice to keep it moist.  Next day, reheat, adding bottled barbeque sauce as needed.

Yummy! Better than the restaurants!  Instead of 2 cups of ketchup, I did 1 cup BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup as suggested from other reviews . I did not shred it before cooking and drizzled some honey on top of the pork. Will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making pulled pork in the slow cooker and I was looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand that didn't seem too intricate. This was perfect! The only change I made was I used two tsp of dijon mustard because I didn't have dry mustard and cooked it on high for 4 hours instead of 5-6. Great recipe and my fiancee loved it!

My first time making bbq pork and this was an amazing recipe!  So easy to make.  My boyfriend loved it so much that the entire roast was gone the next day.  Some small changes I made were : using loin roast instead of shoulder and didn't bother to cut it up, skipped the onions because I am allergic, and used 1cup of ketchup and 1cup of BBQ sauce.  I always use more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for because we don't like anything bland.  I might use a fattier roast next time though.  The loin roast was really delicious and the meat was tender but it didn't fall apart like I had expected.

Made this recipe tonight. I had a 5 lb. pork shoulder (bone in) and therefore doubled all ingredients. I did not cut the pork prior to cooking it and it easily shred once it was done. I flipped the pork twice, however, I don't think it was necessary.   My guests all loved the recipe and there was even enough for lots of leftovers!

Pretty good, although it too me longer to cook than the recipe stated.  It is important to note that the recipe calls for slicing the meat before placing in the crock pot.  I did not do this because I've never in my life sliced meat before putting it in the crock pot, but the time definitely needs to be adjusted if you don't do this.  Sauce was good but very sweet and sort of reminded me of those store bought plastic tubs of pre-sauced pork bbq.  My husband liked this a lot so it will stay in the recipe box, but I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste.

Absolutely amazing!  I took the advice of others and did half ketchup and half BBQ sauce (I used Jack Daniels).  It was a hit among my guests and my house smelled AMAZING!

This is by far one of my favorite recipes to cook up. I made a big batch for my family and friends and everyone raved about it. I used small ciabatta rolls from Trader Joe's to make little pork sliders and everyone was thrilled.   I actually used a fork to pull the meat apart in order to make it pulled pork. Fabulous!!!

I made this in a crockpot exactly as the recipe was written, except that I doubled it.  It was delicious freshly cooked, and even more delicious heated up after being frozen.

Turned out great. I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce as others noted, and I didn't slice before cooking in the slow cooker. After about six hours, I shredded the pork, then let it continue to simmer on low for another few hours. Very easy and very satisfying. Served it with apple coleslaw on the side, which I also found on Allrecipes. I found it tastes even better as leftovers the next day!

Too easy! I've made this a few times now and it's always a hit! I followed previous advice and used 1 cup Ketchup, 1 cup BBQ sauce(Bull's Eye Original). I use my 4 qt crockpot and 3-4 lbs pork shoulder/butt(whatever's on sale) with bone.  There's enough sauce that I DON'T need to double up. If you use with bone, make sure to wash where the bone is cut or you'll get tiny pieces of bone in your shredded pork and it's annoying to enjoy your sandwich and bite on a piece of bone by surprise! I always use potato sandwich buns or sliders(tiny version of buns).  Yum-Oh!

This was amazing.  I made the mistake of grabbing a bone-in pork roast at the market but that bone just added to the flavor.   I also mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl first, poured a bit into the crockpot and THEN put the pork in.  I couldn't find my mincer so I just chopped the garlic very very fine and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients.  Then I poured the rest of the bowl all over the pork roast.  I let it cook on low for about 6 hours and it just fell off the bone.

Oh my gosh, this smells so awesome when cooking!  I use about a 4lb shoulder and grab them now whenever they come on sale. I don't bother doubling the sauce and use 1 cup of each ketchup and BBQ sauce.  I also use real mustard instead of dried.  I shred the pork a few hours before I want to serve so that the meat has a chance to soak up some sauce. I serve it on Onion buns with coleslaw on top!  YUM!  I brought this to a party and my friends called it the Endless Depth of Meat.  Awesome :)

I made this to the recipe and it was delicious!!! I used a bigger shoulder roast and I sliced it and trimmed off all the fat prior to cooking, it literally fell apart and was so tasty, my hubby had seconds without any bread. This one is a keeper!

YUM! I cooked the recipe as written, and then after it was done, removed a little of the liquid and added BBQ.  It turned out great! I didn't even have to shred the meat! I just mixed it and it fell apart.  This is a great one for picnics and get togethers!

So good! I only changed the ketchup amount because I didn't want to use 2 cups and use up all my ketchup. I used 3/4C ketchup, 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 1/2 c bbq sauce that I don't like to try and use it.  It turned out great!

Very good! I did a 5lb. and did 2 cups ketchup, 1 cup bbq sauce and 1 cup chili sauce. I did the meat whole, then when done, place in a large pan where I shredded it. I then added the sauce from the slow cooker until it was the consistancey I wanted and saved the rest for dipping.

This was really good.  I'm not a big fan of pork most times and I enjoyed this.  Sure does make alot.  I wonder if it freezes well after it's cooked?  I cut back a bit on the ketchup and added about 3tbsps of Heinz 57 sauce.  Very good :)  My 16 mth old loves it.

If you were to serve this in North Carolina or Virginia you would be shot where you stood. No questions asked. It taste like it came from the store or somewhere in the north or Texas.

Yummy, I tested and couldn't wait for dinner time to come fast enough. I also used my crock pot low 7 1/2 hours but I doubled it (big family). I can't wait to bring this to a big party so good!

I've used this recipe before and I have to say my BF and I absolutely LOVE it!  I find it's really versatile in that I can use half BBQ sauce if I have some on hand or I can go straight with the called ingredients.  It's a really easy dish to make and I love how I can cook it all day while I'm at work in the crock pot OR if I need something on the fly I can just make it on the stove top!  Tonight I'm going to try it in my pressure cooker (best Christmas gift ever, btw!) and I'm really excited that it'll cut the cooking time by 2/3s.

This was fantastic!  We loved it.  We served it up on old-fashioned hamburger buns.  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I used minced onion and yellow mustard as substitutes.  This was a huge hit and I plan on making it again.  I'm also passing on the recipe to my family & friends so they can try it out as well.  I used the stove top method to make it.  The sauce was on the thin side.  So I did add cornstarch to it to thicken it.  And it turned out perfectly.

Wonderful! I would do as previously suggested in other reviews, boil the meat beforehand to lend the unwanted fat.
my kitchen smelled like a local bbq joint that my husband and I love.

This is super easy, tender and good. I did what others suggested and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce. The meat turned out tasty and tender. The sauce was delicious. The house smelled fantastic while it cooked in the slow cooker. Next time I will use a pork loin roast instead of the shoulder roast to cut down on the fat. When I shred, I will use the pork shoulder because I discard the fat as I shred. This is cooked sliced, so the fat is more of an issue at serving time if you use a fattier cut of meat. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe, I will be doing this one again!

I made this for Saturday college football and everyone loved it. I made a large roast expecting leftovers but they ate it all. I made it in my crockpot. Remember that the time is an estimate and it will vary based on the cut of your pork (i.e. roast, shoulder, tenderloin) and the temperature of your meat (thawed or frozen). My 4# roast was frozen and I cooked it overnight (approx. 10 hrs.), pulled the meat and put it back in the juice to simmer again for another hour. I've made lots of pork bbq and wasn't keen on the ketchup idea. I was also low on ketchup so I used a bottle of bbq (great value honey bbq) and 2T. ketchup. Also, some other reviewers said the juices/sauce was too thin but I liked it the way it was. It was perfect!

My husband said "this is the best thing to come out of that crockpot!"  We had it for Super Bowl Sunday - served on Kaiser rolls and it was absolutely delicious.  It's perfectly spiced - not overwhelming like so many commercial pulled pork and not overly sweet.  I served it with cole slaw on the side - YUM!!!  This is a huge keeper!!

Instead of pork shoulder, I used 3 3/4 lbs. of boneless country spare ribs and cooked them in the sauce for 2 1/2 hours. Then I removed the meat from the pot and shredded it with two forks.  I put the meat back in the sauce and reheated it.  As suggested I used 1 c. ketchup and 1 c. barbeque sauce.  This was delicious.  Probably the best I've ever made.

Great flavor!  I used very lean pork and it turned out a little too dry for my husband's taste.  I'll use a fattier piece of meat next time.  
I served it with sourdough brown-and-serve rolls and fruit salad and my family wolfed it down.  
Will make again.  Thanks!

I had been experimenting with similar recipes, and this one worked perfectly.  I made 16 lbs (split up, of course) of pork for a Halloween party using the stovetop method, and the pork was so tender, it fell apart as I was lifting it out of the pot.  What a great way to feed a crowd.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

This recipe got rave reviews at my son's birthday party.  As suggested by others, I used half the amount of ketchup, and the rest BBQ sauce.  I also cooked pork tenderloin in the crockpot with just water for about 4-5 hours on low/medium, then removed the fat and shredded.  Separately, I cooked the sauce on low for a few hours, then added to the pork after shredding.  It was delicious!  This will be a regular for my family.

BEYOND EXCELLENT! Used a loin & cut off the fat. Slow cooked the pork by itself, pulled it (less messy this way), THEN added sauce (as suggested by many: half ketchup, half BBQ sauce)& continued cooking. Loved by all: kids, grandparents, co-workers, etc. Not one bad word! Melts in your mouth! I had to make THREE 10 pounders because more was demanded by all (adjust recipe for the amount of meat you're cooking).  Thank you, thank you, thank you! Mmmmmmmmmm!

I prepared this recipe for my daughters graduation party.(Had to 'customize' the recipe for 70 servings) Like others I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce... just got bottled stuff on sale at the supermarket, and added a little chili powder, cinamon and whatever else I thought might taste good...  I used boneless pork tenderloin cut it into chunks, and cooked it in industial sized aluminum pans covered with foil in the oven in at 275 for 6 hours. It was a little watery at the end, so I separated some of the liquid to thicken it, but never ended up using it.
  
I have to say I took a gamble preparing an untested recipe for such a huge party but based on the reviews and my own time constraints I took a shot. This was extremely easy to mnake for a crowd and by far the best dish at the party...  EVERYONE wants the recipe.'Kids, teens, adults and elderly neighbors all loved it. 
And yes, it was excellent left over, just be sure to make more than you think you need cause it wont last long.

I rubbed a pork tenderloin with salt, pepper, and chicken grill seasoning, and browned the outside before putting it in the crock pot. I also followed the advice of others and added 1 cup of barbeque sauce (Sweet Baby Rays), but I also dilluted a 1/2 cup ketchup with 1/2 cup of white wine. I shredded the pork, and then let cook in the juices the last hour. It was wonderful!

Tried oven version as well as slow cooker and the slow cooker definitely was my favorite as the meat was much juicier. Added the North Caroline BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup based sauce to the recipe and it was perfect!

I thought this was okay.  Mine turned out a soupy mess...I drained most of the liquid and added more bbq sauce and then it was fine.  I think if I were to make it again I would cook the meat halfway first and drain the liquid before adding the ketchup and bbq sauce.  Also, could use some more spices - the flavor was very simple.

I made this in my crock pot with boneless country style pork ribs. I foresaw difficulty in shredding the pork, so while still slightly frozen I cut into thin slices. It was delicious. My entire family went nuts for it. It did seem a little soupy though. This was great with the Whole Wheat Sandwich Rolls recipe from this site. What a great dinner!

Great  slow cooker recipe and so easy, I have made it several times and it always comes out perfect and a big hit with everyone.  The only change that I made is I use 1 cup of ketchup and add about 1/2 cup water. Thanks Kimber for sharing this GREAT recipe.

They (my family of picky eaters) liked this one!  I used the Stovetop version.  I bought a 3.5 pound pork shoulder and trimmed the fat from the slices (which took a while but was worth it).  Using 1/2 the amount of brown sugar worked and there was a nice balance of meat and sauce and it was tender and had GREAT flavor!

What could be easier than placing everything in one pan and serving a few hours later?  I cooked this on the stovetop, and stirred every once in a while. I added about 1/4 cup of water towards the end to make a little more sauce. The meat came out tender and flavorful. I didn't say a word to my husband that I tried a new recipe, and he actually remarked how much he liked it. That's all I needed to hear.

This was pretty good, but a little too ketchupy tasting in my opinion.  It was very easy, however, so I'll probably try this method again, but tinker with the seasonings a little.

I used the leftovers of a baked roast and made this recipe in the crock pot. It turned out awesome! I used chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor (and use up the container in fridge) it was a great recipe. Worked well with the leftover roast I used too. Very impressed.

I made this as instructed, except I used a pork loin roast I had on hand so I didn't cut it into slices. I used the stove top directions (using a deep cast iron pot) and I added a cup of broth to account for the different cut of meat. SUPER YUMMY!!!  Husband has already requested I make this again. Leftovers are super good, too!!

Very good! I don't slice my pork and I add sriracha sauce for extra heat, but this is the base recipe I use.

Very good and even better as leftovers! I did take the suggestion from another post to add some liquid smoke because I felt the sauce was missing something.

Really good.  Sauce was nice and tangy.  I used reduced sugar ketchup and didn't think that it was too sweet.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Very tasty recipe.  Big hit with the husband and kids.  I followed others' suggestions and used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup bar b q sauce.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end, and used 3 cloves of garlic.  Will definitely make this again.

I used a 3.5 lb roast but the same measurements for the sauce. There was more than enough liquid. Actually, before I shredded the meat, I removed at least 2 cups of excess liquid. The only other change I made was to use 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup of spicy BBQ sauce as others had suggested, as I wanted to give it a little kick. This tasted good, but nothing spectacular.

Made this last night & it turned out wonderful! Everyone loved it! I used 2 large bone-in pork steaks and just took the bones out before I shredded the meat. A big hit in my house!

his recipe was kind of a downer for me. I went with another reviewer and used a roast instead of shoulder. I cooked it for the time indicated and it came out bone dry. I ended up throwing most of it away as my family would not eat it. The sauce was excellent however, and I may give this recipe another try with a shorter cooking time.

OMG! This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was put in 4 cloves of garlic (think we like garlic?) The pork roast I used was frozen solid when I put it in so I wasn't sure how well it would turn out, but after 7 hrs in the crock pot it was delicious! My hubby's new favorite meal :)

This was easy and delicious!  I had a 7.5 lb pork shoulder with the bone in.  I doubled (not tripled) the other ingredients and cut the meat up into big, thick chunks.  I threw everything into the crock pot on high for about 2 hours then on low for another 3 1/2 or so (while trick-or-treating!)  Pulled meat out and chunked/shredded it up.  Served on kaiser rolls with the sauce - delish!

I do shredded BBQ pork for sandwhiches a lot and to the point we were getting tired of it. I love Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce but this was a great change of pace! My husband loved it and said how great it tasted. He hasn't said anything about the sandwhiches in forever so I know he loved it. We will be making this from now on instead of bottled bbq sauce!

Delicious, easy and inexpensive.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  Simmered on the stove top.  It was done in 3 hours.  I did use 1 1/2 c. of Ketchup and 1/2 c. Barbeque sauce.  I had a lot of sauce left over.  I'm not sure if it was b/c I used the stove top method.

Did as some reviewers said and made this with half BBQ sauce and half ketchup.  I used a pork shoulder with a bone - no big deal- the meat fell off the bone.  Served this on sandwich buns - we have 4 children aged 7-15 - everyone one of them had seconds and then one of them snuck down to the fridge in the middle of the night and ate another!  This one is a keeper!!!

Delicious! The only thing is a 2 1/2 lb pork shoulder was not enough meat for the amount of servings it's supposed to make. Next time I will get a 4 lb pork shoulder and add more BBQ sauce but keep the same amount of ketchup. Was very easy and tasty!

Oh my this was so good and so easy to make. I had a 7lb Pork shoulder so I doubled the recipe and put in a package of slow cook BBQ pork season and it turned out perfect. I just put it all in the crockpot (with out cutting up the pork) set it on low and let it cook for about 15 hours. It just fell apart.. and the taste was amazing. I will be doing this one again. Thank you Kimber

Really good.  Used pork shoulder that  was almost 6 lbs so had lots of left overs.  Used 4 cloves of garlic.  The only issue I had was the layer of fat.  It might be because I didn't take the time to cut off ALL the fat.  Next time I will.  I also started cooking it at 9 am and ended up being out all day and didn't get home until after 10 that night.  The meat was really tender.  I had to take the meat out to shred it and then skimmed the fat off and added some of the juices with the meat.  My parents gave some of their leftovers to their neighbor and he wants to make it now.

I make pulled pork sandwiches all the time but my husband thought this version was the best so far. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is excellent.  Followed the recipe except added additional garlic. Definitely use the amount of brown sugar from the recipe. Used pork shoulder roast and cut in slices as the recipe indicated.  Cooked for 6 hrs in the crock pot. Served with the buns the first night and over rice the next night.  Definitely will make this again.

I used thick boneless pork loin chops and we did not like the flavor of this dish. I slow cooked it in the crock pot for about 8 hours.

WOW! This is SUPER DELICIOUS!!! I followed recipe to T., except added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and chili powder for extra spiciness, reduced brown sugar to 1 1/2 tsp like most reviewers. Cook 1 kg of pork lean meat on HIGH for 2 hours followed by LOW for 1 1/2 hors and the meat just fell apart... So tender, smelling-good and mouth-watering served on soft dinner buns! Thank you so much for the recipe, Kimber. It's definitely a keeper:)

OMG. I don't make anything good. So when I found this recipe on allrecipes, I had my doubts. BUT, this pork is AMAZING! I followed the recipe to the T (with slow cooker) and shredded it with two forks when done, then served it on hoagie rolls with potato salad. I will definitely make it again.

Very good, used a pork shoulder and was hard to get started with the shredding, but well worth it!  I never have leftovers when I make this.

Woe, there was so much juice/grease, my pork was drowning.  I had to drain juice into pot, added some corn starch and cooked to thicken.  Then I added much (but not all) of it back into the pork to moisten.  That was much better and the flavor was good.

Put a pork shoulder with the ketchup in the crock pot; removed the meat when done; removed the fat; shredded the meat and added the other ingredients to reheat in the crock pot.  Very easy and delicious!

I made this on a much larger scale for an outdoor party and it was excellent!  I modified slighly for convenience, but nothing significant.  I cooked the roasts the night before in a crock pot with seasoned salt and dehydrated minced onions.  The next day I mixed up the bbq sauce in a large electric roaster adding about 1/2 of the juices from the cooked roast and only half of the onions, brought the sauce to a boil, reduced to a simmer and added meat.  The meat was probably simmering for 2-3 hrs before we ate.

We had some friends over this weekend to help pour cement. I made this for lunch  and following the recipe exactly. I thought it was a little to sweet, next I will use 1/8 cup of sugar and a little liquid smoke. It was good otherwise, goobled up by all!

This was sooo good! i took advice and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 baby ray's honey bbq sauce. I used a 3 lb. boneless pork loin sliced. I cooked it on high for 4 hrs. then slow for another 4. Perfect. We all loved it!

Made this the slow cooker method.  I loved how tender the meat came out...and definitely loved how easy it was.  The sauce was just all right...not really the type of bbq sauce I llike.  Will make again, but will make some changes to the sauce.

My whole family loved this recipe (even my picky son.)  I have tried several BBQ recipes in my slow cooker, and this one was wonderful.  I do not think it was greasy at all.  I used boneless pork tenderloin and trimmed any extra fat (there was not too much.)  I added a 1/4 C. of BBQ sauce and also a dab of cumin.  It was delicious and I will be making it again.  Terrific served with homemade slaw.

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this recipe yet. I've made it so many times that I have lost count!  It's easy and I can do it in the crockpot during the summer without heating up the house.  4 star recipe as written, but I usually sub half of the ketchup with a cup of bbq sauce.  Freezes nicely too.

Excellent!! Mixed the sauce the night before and just left in the fridge overnight.  If it weren't for the kids, I would add a bit of Frank's Red Hot Sauce to the mix for a little bit of a kick.  But did put some on individual sandwiches and it was amazing!! A DEFINITE repeat!!!!

I made this in the slow cooker and I did everything but the dry mustard and the ketchup because I just don't like ketchup. After it simmered all night to the point I could take it apart,I added some of our own bbq sauce and it came out great! this is a good sandwich to make everybody on a summer day!

Thought this recipe was great, as it is easy on the BBQ flavor, which I am not a huge fan of. However, it was very greasy & had to spoon off the river of grease repeatedly as it was cooking. The only real drawback to this recipe.

I used a 2.5 lb pork roast.  Thought 2 cups ketchup seem a lot, but used 1 1/2 plus 1/2 cup barbeque sauce. Family members liked it, but was too rich for me .  It's easy and good, but I'll use about half as much ketchup and sauce next time.

This was really good. I used a 4 lb shoulder roast and put it in the crock pot frozen before I left for work and it smelled really good when I came home. Instead of all the kethup I used some bottled BBQ sauce. This was really good, didn't have to add any extra sauce after putting them on the bun. Will make this again and again since it's cheap and easy and super good!!! Thank you

Tried recipe today just the way it was written with a 3 lb pork shoulder. Left the shoulder whole and cooked for 8 hrs on low. It was fabulous! I give it "3 T's" Tender, Tasty, and Terrific.  And could not have been easier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic.  I made this for a church luncheon, more to see what they'd do than anything else.  There is always such bland health food there and I get tired of it.  They went crazy for it.  Even the kids loved it.  One of the boys came back and told everyone to leave it it alone because there was hardly any left and it was his favorite dish there.  Like most reviewers, I substituted half of the catsup with something else. Instead of barbecue sauce I used a sweet smoky griling sauce that had a pretty good bite to it because it contained cayenne pepper, jalapeno peppers and crushed red peppers. With the other ingredients in the recipe it toned it down and made a nice flavorful pungent sauce.  They sure liked it and asked me to make it again. I made this the day before in the crockpot(3 3/4lbs). Overnight in refrigerator.  Let it warm up to room temperature in the morning while at church.  Came home and cooked it on the stove for 15 minutes  with the cover off to boil sauce down, removed the meat, started shredding it and putting it back in the pot which was now on very low heat just to keep it warm.  Then took off to the picnic.

What about cooking it until it is about 75% done, slicing it up or shredding it, and putting it back in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients to cook for a couple of more hours. I'm not a fan of slicing up a partially frozen roast and trying to get the bones out at that stage. I'd much rather cook it most of the way through, slice and de-bone and finish it off with the full list of sauce and spice.

I loved this! I always make beef bbq, but this was so good.  I like the fact that the sauce isn't a thick one, just more of a flavoring.  Very delicious and makes A TON.  We've made about 12 sandwiches out of it and are still going!

This was very yummy pork.  I prefer not to use store bought BBQ sauce.  So this was what I was looking for.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  My family was devouring it at dinner last night, and we had plenty left over (although I had about 4 1/2 lbs. of pork).  Really great recipe!

A friend of mine had made this for a potluck and I raved and asked for the recipe!  She had recommended using 1 c ketchup and 1 c bottled BBQ sauce, which I did when I made it.  It is outstanding and even tastes better the longer it sits so it is great for leftovers!  Will definitely make this again and again.

Yummy! I use pork tenderloin which really cuts down on the fat and it comes out so tender and delicious. I also substitute BBQ sauce for half of the ketchup called for and didn't use the brown sugar since we like it spicer versus sweeter. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times and it has been awesome both times. I put it on a hamburger bun with some mustard and fresh tomato. I think you could sell this on the street corner and make a LOT of money...

yum yum yum yum!  I LOVE me some bbq pork.   I pulled the pork after it was cooked and then let it simmer in the sauce for another hour or so.  I also did 1 cup of ketchup, 1 cup of bbq sauce (bulls eye)  I just LOVE this recipe.

Great recipe, but the sauce was kind of thin. Next time, I may add some corn starch to thicken at the end. I thew in a teaspoon of cumin and apple cider vinegar served on onion kaiser rolls. Big hit for the game!

A definite 5 stars!  We loved it.  I didn’t feel like having it on buns so we had it on noodles but that did not work to well, we were all chasing our noodles in our plate.  Maybe we could try it on rice.  I have lots of leftovers so I will be making it on buns tonight. Thanks a bunch Kimber.

Easy and delicious!  I eyeballed the onion (on the extra side) and added about 1/4 c. gourmet barbeque sauce from reading the other reviews.  I think it would have been just as good without it.  I used pork loin (not tenderloin, that would be a waste).  I took some to work to share and my friends enjoyed it too.  Will make again.

My family had an outstanding dinner when I served this!  I put it on San Francisco-style sourdough rolls, and it was awesome.  This one isn't just getting printed out.  It's getting cut and laminated, because I don't want to chance losing it!

Really tasty.  I did as others suggested and added some spicy barbecue sauce I got at a special bbq joint in Arizona.  Just 1/2 cup.  We've been eating the leftovers all week.  one night put it on a bed of lettuce with black beans, corn, tomato, and salad dressing made from half ranch dressing and half bbq sauce.  YUM!  Thanks KIMBER!

We thought this was just ok.  When I made the sauce, I added 1 tsp of liquid smoke to give the sauce a BBQ flavour.  We cooked the pork in a slow cooker set to low for about 10 hours.  The pork was very tender, but there was a lot of fat which was unappetizing.  At the end of the cooking time, we removed the pork, shredded it and added it back to the sauce and used it for pulled pork sandwiches.  While we didn't hate this recipe, we much prefer the "barbecued beef" recipe also found on this site.

My husband loves his barbecue and this is a real winner.  I used the crockpot method, left the pork shoulder whole, shredded it and put it back in the sauce for about half an hour before serving.  I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce. Yummmm!

We loved this! Super easy! We cooked it whole, and cut it up after it was finished cooking; it cooked in the slow cooker for 8 hrs on low. Crowd pleaser! We added bbq sauce instead of all of the ketchup the recipe called for. Delicious.

I combined two allrecipe recipes to make some delicious BBQued pork for our Super Bowl party!  I slow-cooked my pork loin in 14oz beef broth (see BBQ Pork for Sandwiches recipe) for 4 hours on High, then shredded the pork (super easy and very moist!) and added it back to the crockpot with the sauce from this recipe plus some of the reserved broth and a bit of liquid hickory smoke, heating everything through.  Yum!  I got tons of compliments, and the leftovers were even better.

Terrific.  I bought a cheap cut of pork ($.98/pound) and cooked it in the over on 275 for about 5 hours until it just fell apart.  Very easy to shred that way.  Then I added all the ingredients to the crock pot, along with the shredded pork.  I also used half ketchup and half barbeque sauce.  Everyone loved this recipe and said it was the best they had ever had.

Simply the best recipe out there.  I used other's suggestions by substituting some of the ketchup with BBQ sauce and also use the suggestion of not doubling the ingredients when using twice as much meat, works well.  Also, I use the crock pot method, and put the sliced shoulder(the way it comes from the store) into the crockpot the way it is and pull the meat apart after it has cooked.  This reduces the amount of fat in the recipe.  I also put the pulled meat and juices into a pan and simmer until the sauce has reduced.

Had a whole lot of pork I didn't know what to do with! This recipe worked out so well! Never had barbeque pork before, but after trying this recipe I plan on making it again and again! My husband has had it, but saud this was the best he has ever tasted! Thanks so much!! Can't wait to share it with company or to bring to pot lucks! (had yummy leftovers for days!)

My husband LOVED this!!  I cooked a whole, frozen roast in a coffee based liquid.  About an hour before dinner I shredded the roast, added new sauce (minus onions) and returned to crock pot.  Then served on rolls.

I used the slow-cooker version of this recipe.  Meat was extremely tender and shredded easily with just two forks.  I added homemade barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, though, and it turned out just as tasty.  The entire family enjoyed, and it made plenty of food for everyone.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

My husband and I love this recipe. This is the second time I have made it and have not changed a thing other than to use a pork loin--only because that is usually what I have on hand. Thanks!!

I USED THE SLOW COOKER METHOD TO MAKE THIS BARBEQUE PORK. I THOUGHT ABOUT FREEZING SOME OF IT FOR A LATER DATE BUT MY FAMILY ATE ALL OF IT IN TWO MEALS!

This was delicious and easy.  I used a boneless pork ribeye.  I also used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup barbeque sauce.  I put the whole roast in the crock pot and cooked on low for 7-8 hours.  The meat just shredded when I put a fork in it, no effort at all.  Served on fresh snowflake rolls.  Great, easy meal.  Will make for my next party.

Not too bad.  Very easy.  I made it on the stove, and only used 1/2 the ketchup.  It was just a bit salty, but will definately make it again. Thanks.

Very easy & tasty.  Tasted even better the next day.  I did use 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of honey barbeque sauce.  It turned out great.  I served it with egg noodles.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I don't cook that often, but when I do, it's either a hit or a miss.  This was definitely a hit!  My boyfriend, who is a wonderful cook, even loved it.  I used boneless pork chops instead of shoulder, which made the meat simply flake apart by itself when it was done.  The sauce was a sweeter sauce, but delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!  I have been looking for a good pork barbecue recipe for a year and a half.  And this is the first one my family really likes.  Everyone kept raving about how good it was and went back for seconds and thirds.  My search is definitely over!  :-)

followed recipe pretty much exactly. It came out great.  I did upsize the meat (and scaled up the other ingredients).  if you really use a 2 1/2 cut of meat, you are going to have 8 skimpy portions.  I used a 3.5 lb shoulder.

This is absolutely delicious!! Made it for Super Bowl and was a hit!  I had a 3.5lb pork butt and and followed the recipe but added a little more of each ingredient. Cooked on High for about 5 1/2 hrs and it was perfect! YUM!!

Even with the sauce, it's a bit dry. I added a little more ketchup, took out the Brown sugar, and it was pretty good. I will make this again.

This was absolutely beautiful. I served with a bread roll and spicy beans and rice. I'll be eating pulled pork sandwiches for days (but that's just fine!)

I made this in the crock pot  and was very happy with how it turned out. I made sure to add it to my recipe binder for future use. A must try! Super simple.

My whole family said that this was the best pulled pork recipe out of all the recipes I have tried!  I did everything per the recipe except I added a few dashes of liquid smoke also.  Thanks so much!

Made this for a picnic and got rave reviews. Like a previous poster, I replaced 1/2 of the ketchup with bottled BBQ sauce. Very good.

My family LOVED this pork recipe, and it made the house smell so good!  I doubled the sauce recipe based on having a larger boneless roast.  I'll be making this again next week.  I think this time I'll make pork tacos for a change of pace.

This is delicious bbq pork.  We sub half bbq sauce for the ketchup and don't use quite as much sugar as it calls for, but other than that we follow the recipe and it tastes great!

I use a package w/ two pork tenderloins.  I put all of the ingredients in the crockpot along with 1/2 bottle of KC Masterpiece bbq sauce (it makes sauce a little thicker) for 6-8 hours on low.  Serve it on buns w/ pickles.  YUM! and EASY!

I used the slow cooker method and let it cook on low for 8-9 hours.  I cut the meat into large chunks and then shredded with a fork after it was cooked and it fell apart.  I will definately make again.

We used the stovetop method for cooking. Thought it was pretty good the first night, but didn't like it so much when we had it for leftovers the following night. It seemed like the sauce got too sweet when it had been sitting for a day or so. The meat was definitely tender, but the sauce was just a little syrupy for our tastes. I did use the ketchup/bbq sauce combo mentioned by other posters.

It is real yummy and easy.  It is perfect for mom with few kids.  I would be rather to use loin instead of pork shoulder.  It is a bit greasy to our family.

I used a cup of ketchup & a cup of BBQ sauce. I did cook in a slower cooker. I found it to be very nice, but not the best flavor.

Don't change a thing in this recipe!  Outrageously good!  I used boneless pork loin slices.  After 6 hours of cooking on low it was easy to remove the small sliver of fat on the side of each piece and pull the pork to make shreds.  I then cooked on low for another 2 hours. Perfecto!  Husband said I hit the jackpot with this recipe.

Yum!  I did mine in the crock pot and did 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup bbq sauce and omitted the brown sugar since both have a lot of sugar in them.  I cooked the whole shoulder and when it was done cooking, I shredded it with a fork, which was extremely easy to do.  I made the onion rolls recipe from this site too and served my hubby the "best loose meat sandwiches of his life".

This was so good, and easy. All my kids ate it and asked for more, even the one who only wants McDonalds cheeseburgers for every meal. My husband likes my cooking, but this earned me shopping spree with no grumbling, lol. Thanks much and Merry Christmas.

I cooked my pork shoulder whole for about 5 hours and then shredded it and put it back in the sauce to rewarm.  I also used 1 cup BBQ and 1 cup Ketchup.  This was wonderful and is my new pulled pork recipe!

Absolutely delicious -- I'd give it more stars if I could!  My entire family absolutely loved this (how rare is that!) and I will certainly make again.  The only change I made was substituted 1 cup barbeque sauce for 1 cup ketchup.

This was pretty good.  The cut of pork kind of grossed me out - I didn't really like it.  I think I will try shredding a tenderloin or something next time and slow cooking that in the sauce.

I was a little prepared not to like this recipe very much, but it was a real surprise!  I did the same as the previous reviewer and used part bbq sauce and adjusted the ketchup accordingly.  Very tender and tasty!  The only thing I might change next time is to either make less sauce or cook more meat.

I used 1/2 cup BBQ sauce and reduced ketchup by that much.  It turned out delicious.  When tender, I shredded all the meat.  Great for sandwiches, with cheese melted on top!

FANTASTIC!  This is my first successful crockpot recipe!  And it is great!  I almost passed it up because I didn't want to wrestle with a partially frozen roast trying to cut it into slices.  But the butcher did it for me, no charge!  The recipe was really easy.  Super yummy!  Plenty of sauce to handle a bigger roast if you want.

Awesome and Delicious! Definely slice the pork all the way through before cooking and it will get so tender it will fall apart. No extra BBQ sauce is needed, recipe is absolutely perfect!

I did not care for this recipe.  I found the pork dried out and over cooked after six hours in the crock pot, the sauce was too sweet and there was too much of it.  This was my first attempt at slicing the pork before cooking.  I usually make pulled pork and will continue to do so as I think it works better and the meat does not dry out as badly.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup BBQ Sauce.  It turned out great!

At first, I didn't think the recipe would be all that special - was I ever wrong!!!  The shoulder meat was sooo tender, and the BBQ sauce was fabulous!!  In fact, my husband finished it off - I think it's the most he has ever eaten in one sitting.

I am a huge fan of crockpot recipes and this one is definitely a keeper.  I used two 1 1/4 lb lean pork tenderloins and shredded them to serve on sandwiches.  Delicious!

My husband said I had to review this recipe.  My husband doesn't get excited about much, but he LOVES this!  He tells everyone that it's better than any restaurant.  My kids and I like it too.  I add 1 c bbq and 1 c ketsup as others suggest and I add a little extra brown sugar and bbq sauce about a half hour before it's done.  Very good- thanks Kimber

Super yum! Used an entire Pork Shoulder in the crockpot (with fat). Initially added just water to the Pork for 20 minutes, drained and then added 2 cups of store bought barbeque sauce and then 2 cups of ketchup and the rest of the ingrediants in the recipe. It was tender, juicy and really enjoyable....I heard from one of the reviews that it freezes well, so I will try to freeze the leftovers.
 Great recipe!

This recipe is the absolute bomb.  All I did differently was cube the pork, instead of thinly slicing it and I used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 bbq sauce.
Thank you for this, it's a keeper!

Worth every one of its 5 stars! Best pork barbeque I've ever had. Made it whole in crock with half ketchup and half BBQ sauce, then shredded it and left on warm for half hour. Put in a little extra brown sugar too.

My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it! Soooo easy to prepare! I took the suggestion and used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 bbq sauce and left the roast whole and just shredded at the end of the cooking process. I also boiled down the sauce to make it a little thicker...Yummy!!!

Great BBQ pork recipe.  It's easy in the slow cooker, and makes for great leftovers.  I used pork sirloin and shredded after cooking, added the 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 BBQ sauce combo and threw it back in the slow cooker for an hour or so on low.  Served on Miami Onion rolls with provolone.  OK, so it's not traditional, but tasty nevertheless.

awesome! i used a pork picnic cut and the stove-top simmer method for 3 hours. i modified by using 1 cup bbq sauce and 1 cup ketchup (instead of 2 cups ketchup) and only 1/8 cup worcestershire sauce (so my little ones could eat it). LOVED IT! definitely a keeper. thanks!! :)

My husband love this recipe.  He said is like eating ribs without the mess.  I used half the ketcup and bbq sauce like the other suggested, it was great.  I just use a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I didn't want the worcertershire to overpower.   Thank Kimber

I had a hard time replacing the catsup with BBQ sauce, because I wasn't sure which other ingredients to keep and which to omit.  I guessed wrong (I kept the worcestershire and it was overpowering).  But I think the cooking method is extremely promising, and the texture turned out fantastic even though the flavor was off because of my changes.  BBQ pulled pork is truly my all-time favorite meal, and I think by either following the recipe exactly, or by just using pork and your favorite BBQ sauce, this will be a great recipe.

I recently tried this in the crockpot.  Excellent seasonings.  I didn't have any pork shoulder but used boneless pork ribs that I had in the freezer.  After 8 hours, the meat was very tender and easily shredded or "pulled".  I would recommend this to anyone who loves bbq pork or pulled pork sandwiches.

Excellent barbecue.  I used 1 cup bbq sauce and 1 cup ketchup, omitted the salt, and added a little Tony Chachere's.  I made it in the crockpot.  The only thing I did differently was cut the pork into chunks to cook.  After 7 hours on low, I removed it and shredded, and added it back in for another 45 minutes.  Very very good!

This was really good, but similar to many recipes I've tried already.  I ran out of ketchup, so I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce.  I'm glad that I stuck with the called for amount of brown sugar, as we didn't find it too sweet at all.

This is a great sandwich for football parties and such.  Make sure to use hoagie or sub rolls, or kaiser rolls depending on size of pork pieces.  For more barbeque flavor, add a 1/2 cup more ketchup.  Very good, nonetheless!!

I bought a very fatty cut, fortunately I had followed others advice and slow pre-cooked it.  I tried Sarge's recipe on this website using beef broth and brewed coffee (it had a great smokey smell & flavor)then drained the fat. With the pre-cooking you might not need to cook so long the second time.

This recipe was so easy and tasty.  I used a pork tenderloin roast that I sliced and layered with the sauce and let it cook all day in the crockpot.  I removed the meat and shredded it and reduced the sauce in a pan on the stove for about 25 minutes and returned it to the meat.  I also added about a cup of prepared honey barbeque sauce.  We used the meat for barbeque sandwiches.  Great recipe!
