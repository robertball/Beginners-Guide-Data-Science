This has to be one of my favorite meals of all time.  I've been making cha gio ever since my tour of duty in Vietnam. I must  admit though that I've never added fish sauce to the ingredients. I've always used it to make a  nouc cham (dipping sauce) for the cha gio.  As the submitter suggests you can add different ingredients. I like to add bean sprouts to the mixture.

These taste just like our favorite Vietnamese restaurant (only cheaper!)    My husband and son will not eat any others now.  The ones in the store and FF places are almost ALL cabbage and NO FLAVOR. (However, we still really like JITB ones!)

They freeze well, BUT, make SURE you cook them BEFORE freezing.. my first time, i found they got sticky and ripped when I defrosted them and attempted to fry.

 Fish sauce really smells AWFUL & I found you HAVE TO USE IT to get the correct flavor.  I dislike oysters, but I love oyster sauce!

If you're leary, find a large oriental market to find a small bottle of the fish sauce. I got a 1.5 oz bottle the first time.

Everyone in my family thought this was very good. I added about a cup of shredded cabbage. We used lumpia wrappers that were about 7.5 inches square and thought they were the right size. We used about 3 heaping tablespoons of filling per wrapper. If you use more than that you risk having a  blowout (personal experience). It's fun to get everyone sitting around the table rolling them.

I use italian sausage instead of pork for a little extra flavor.  Decent recipe.  I'm gonna try an air fryer next time, though, to see if they turn out as well without all the extra oil.

I was hoping these would taste like the traditional ones that employees where I work bring in would taste like.  They are close but not quite the same.  I would also recommend pan frying these as the rice paper wraps I purchased didn't really brown the way I would have expected in the deep fryer and some even "blew up".  I used fresh oil that night and I think they actually would have cooked better in older oil for the deep fryer but would still recommend pan frying.

This is similar to my mom's recipe and it's nice because it uses both pork and shrimp.  i love her egg rolls and this is pretty much spot on. we  don't add sugar to ours being that we use sesame oil,  egg and a few other ingredients in place. great recipe though

This recipe is just what I was looking for! Tastes exactly like the ones you get at your local Vietnamese place. I made a large batch and froze them and they kept very well.
