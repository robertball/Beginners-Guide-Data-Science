No need to buy all different flours. 2 cups of gluten free multi purpose flour works wonderful! The muffin itself is not sweet enough so I used the icing which I thought was necessary. It made 12 large delicious  muffins..

Couldn't tell it wasn't made with wheat flour.  I made a couple substitutions, though.  Rather than sorghum flour, which I cannot find, I used that much more tapioca flour.  I also changed the brown rice flour for using homemade almond flour.  The almond flour was leftover from making almond milk and I left it with some fairly large bits so there are bites of almond throughout, yum.

These are delicious and kid-approved. My 3-year old loves these for breakfast or anytime. I keep a batch on hand in my freezer. Instead of the mix of flours listed, I use 1 3/4 C all-purpose GF flour from Trader Joe's and 1/4 C Bob's Red Mill Flax four. I also add chocolate chips to the mix instead of making the glaze topping.

I made this for my son, who has celiac disease. I was pleased with the muffins, but used a gluten free flour mix instead of the different flours. I didn't use any baking soda, as I've had poor luck with the gluten free cooking and soda. I used the same amount of baking powder, and they rose beautifully. I didn't use the frosting, as I had some cream cheese store bought frosting in the house.

Tried these the other day and I liked them.  I used the flours as written but had to sub out canned pumpkin because it isn't available to me.  I made my own.  I found the muffins to be good but the icing isn't for me.  It tastes like butter which is unpleasant.  I then made these again today with some changes as the submitter suggests in the description to use alternatives for milk.  I used coconut milk and found they came out a bit better tasting so it is definitely worth trying out as amounts and method are right on.  I also used fat free greek yogurt instead of butter and milk for the icing and it was pretty good.  The recipe as is yields a moist, somewhat dense but not heavy texture, rich in flavour and colour it resembles a pumpkin pie in some ways.  Not too sweet and not really savoury not dry and holds its shape well.  Thank you Michele for sharing your recipe.

These muffins turned out great even at the high altitude. I did not make the glaze. Without it the muffins are mildly sweet. They did make very tasty cupcakes with my vegan buttercream frosting. I did the following substitutions: ghee for butter, coconut milk for regular milk, and a mix of xylitol and coconut sugar for brown sugar. I'll be making these again. Thanks!

Came out wonderful!  Everyone loves them.  I also used my all purpose gluten free flour mix (2cups) for ease and added some maple syrup to the glaze.  They tastes great!

This was a solid base recipe for gf muffins, and the other reviewers were right; not too sweet but you'll come back to it again & again. Texture and crumb were very similar to wheat flour muffins. Hooray for another gf winner on this site!

My only alteration was switching out half the pumpkin for banana; helps with the sweetness.

Just made the muffins!  Outstanding!  As my granddaughter says, "we jazzed them up".  My husband has Celiac and loves pumpkin, anything.  So, the alterations we made were; added 2 TBS (yes that much) of cinnamon and just a little more of each of the other spices, used Evaporated milk instead of regular milk - you used evap. milk in pumpkin pie, so why not in this recipe?!  It absolutely works and remains gluten free.  We also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  The big addition we made, was 1 bag of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips.  Oh, the aroma in the house is amazing!!  The regular recipe sounded so good, but we always try to make it our own.  Kudos to the original recipe!

Loved it, read reviews first and doubled sugar which turned out perfect and added chocolate chips AWESOME!  Also added a couple table spoons of coconut oil and messed with some different gutenf fee flours like yam flour and coconut flour along with the brown rice flour.

I added raisins and nuts, as well sprinkled organic palm sugar on top as most other reviews said they were not sweet enough. Used my fresh pie pumpkin puree too. Uu

The texture of these muffins was really great.  I substituted 1/2 c. of oat floar and used 3/4 c. of all purpose gluten free flour.  But I agree that they aren't sweet enough for me.  Has anyone made changes that fixed that?  I would hate to ruin the texture by messing with the ratios!  I also added some maple to the glaze and that was really good.
