Yummy. I cooked my squash whole in the slow cooker all day on low so it would be ready when I got home from work (just add a cup of water and poke some holes in it). Only other thing I did differently was to skip the vegan sausage. Thanks!

This recipe was excellent! Just what I was looking for! My changes: I microwaved the squash for eight minutes to save time (it comes out fine), and used an entire package of Tofurkey sausage that I sliced and added to the sauce. Yum!

Winter Red Sauce over Spaghetti Squash Haiku: "Who needs the noodles? When the sauce tasted so good. (And healthy, to boot!)" I only changed a couple things, such as reducing the sugar and salt by half, and putting the squash into the oven whole, rather than cut, for a little over an hour. (I didn't feel like hacking it in half uncooked.) Otherwise, I was faithful to the recipe, and was really delighted w/ the results.

My bf and I really liked this recipe.  I didn't make it with vegan sausage or bell peppers and I added dried oregano and topped with shredded parmesan it was delicious.  Will def make it again.

This recipe misses the mark. For one, a 6.5 ounce can of tomato sauce is less than a cup of tomato sauce. One cup is not enough for four servings, let alone a whole spaghetti squash. In addition, 2 whole teaspoons of salt is far too much salt, especially when most tomato sauces that you can buy at the store (I used Contadina) already have salt added to them. One or two pinches are really all that is needed. And finally, this recipe does not need sugar! Besides the sugar already present in the tomatoes, spaghetti squash is already sweet - it is a squash, after all. 

What I changed: I used 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, 1 15 ounce can of tomato sauce, no sugar, no bell pepper (personal taste - I don't like bell pepper), and 2 medium stalks of diced celery. I guess I made my own recipe, but this recipe was the inspiration.

Delicious.  This was a wonderful vegetarian alternative to spaghetti with meat sauce.  My meat loving husband also enjoyed.  The only changes I made were 1 can of diced tomatoes, boiled down to get rid of the water and I omitted the tomato paste.  Can't wait to have the leaftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I am rating this recipe based on the concept. I never thought to use spaghetti squash as actual spaghetti but what a fantastic idea! I baked the squash as the recipe calls for then pulled it apart and fluffed it up. I covered it in my own homemade meat sauce and it was fantastic! My boyfriend and I both love pasta but are trying to cut out carbs. This is a low-calorie, no carb, yummy alternative to spaghetti and meat sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing this creative idea Ginger!

This sauce was delicious exactly as written, however next time (and there will be a next time) I will use a little less of the all the spices.  That is just my personal taste.  As far as the person that gave this a one star, they never even tried the recipe as written.  They are completely wrong - this was enough for 4 large servings and the small amount of tomato sauce and paste was perfect.  I loved it!

Yum! Instead of making the sauce I used a jar of marinara. Even my meat eating husband liked this dish.

Definitely needed to cook the squash longer. Used regular sausage and the sauce was super spicy even with minimal use of the spice. Good alternative for low carb though.

Not a bad base with a few changes -  cut salt by half and eliminate the sugar entirely except as necessary to balance the acidity of the tomatoes ( use a 15 oz can and not a 6.5 as others have suggested.  As written the sauce is incredibly sweet.  Added fresh basil and (not being vegan) parmesan shaved on after plating.

We love spaghetti and meat sauce ... and this was delicious! I took other ratings and lowered the salt ... and I used Spolumbo's Chicken sausage and removed the casing ... It's a keeper! I also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because I never have tomato sauce =p .... 3 of us ate and still have enough to at least enough feed another 5 more people yet

Really good!  Cut the salt down to 1 tsp, and didn't put in full amount of pepper, and it was PLENTY spicy.  I was worried that there would not be enough sauce after reading the negative review, but there was just the right amount (and I used a big spaghetti squash).  Probably my favorite spaghetti squash recipe so far.  And very easy!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it is definitely a keeper. But for our taste I will cut back on the water and cut back on the brown sugar. Otherwise it is wonderful! I have been doing spaghetti squash with a bolognaise and was looking for something new and this is a great alternative.

This is the best tomato sauce I have ever made or eaten..My husband asks me to make it all the time!  I addded 1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow swash chopped fresh basil and used half the salt....otherwise exactly the same.  The brown sugar really makes all the difference.  The squash always turns out perfectly.  Yummy!

Really liked the recipe. I used a pork sausage instead, and added more vegetables, and my roommates and I really liked this. Would definitly make this again.
