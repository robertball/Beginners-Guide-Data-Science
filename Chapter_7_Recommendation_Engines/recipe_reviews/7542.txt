If you're looking for the definitive buttercream recipe, then look no further. Here are a few reasons why this recipe rocks my world: 1) Consistancy: It's PERFECT. Not too gloopy or too stiff. Just right. EVERY time. 2) Flexibility [part 1]: You can easily adjust ingredients to suit tastes of the cake-eaters. Butter instead of shortening is unbelievably rich but a firm favourite for older eaters. The shortening-only version tastes a lot like bakery icing, so popular with a younger crowd. And a mixture of the two gives you the best of both worlds. 3) Flexibility [part 2]: Recipe here makes a shedload. Great if you need to ice cupcakes for a couple thousand of your closest friends, but proportions are such that it is easily halved (to ice one normal sized cake) without losing any flavour  or needing a degree in calculus to figure out what the measurements would be. Make it. You won't regret it.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to take a chance and follow the recipe *exactly* - that's right, NO changes - and it was absolutely delicious! 5 Star all the way. I've taken the Wilton decorating classes, and I used to use their frosting, but from now on this will be my staple Buttercream recipe. I've been looking for a Bakery Frosting replica for years, and this is definitely it! Not only is the flavor wonderful, the texture is *perfect* for piping decorations! I made this with a hand held mixer, and my only tip is to REALLY beat the crisco to get it as light and fluffy as possible before adding the powdered sugar, and then beat it as much as possible after adding the sugar, and again after adding the remaining ingredients. If you're looking for a copy cat bakery frosting recipe, this is it! A+ (Exactly as written!)

I made a huge birthday cake for 50 people yesterday and wanted to try a different buttercream recipe. I made 2 changes based on other reviews.  (1) I used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I didn't use more butter because of potential problems with softening/melting.  (2) I added 1 tsp Wilton's butter flavoring.  I left everything else the same.  What a great icing!  It was very spreadable and great when piping shell borders, rosettes and lettering.  It also tinted beautifully.  I did have to refrigerate the pastry bags after a minutes of use because the heat from my hands was too much and the icing became very soft.  At the birthday party, I had 4 guests who bake tell me that this was the best icing ever--that it was so buttery and not too sweet.  I will definitely use again.

I tried two variations of this recipe so far. The first time I tried a variation I read in the reviews because I didn't want the frosting to have a greasy after taste. I used 1 c. butter and 1 c. shortening, and only 4.5 cups of powered sugar and 4 oz of heavy cream (along with the other ingrediants). This tasted great and wasn't too sweet. The only problem is that it tended to be a bit more runny that I liked and I had to refrigerate it often because it was getting too soft for my decorations. The 2nd batch I made was 1 1/2 c. shortening, 1/2 c butter and the rest of the ingrediants according to the recipe. This batch came out fabulous! It was sweet (as expected) but with a great consistency for piping, star tip design, and other decorating techniques. I don't care for really sweet frosting, however, I didn't have a problem with this frosting at all. I think from now on I'm going to stick to the 2nd variation for my cakes!

This is the best buttercream recipe I have ever tried before, but I read the reviews and substituted 1 and 1/2 cups of the shortening with butter (having made buttercream that tasted "greasy" before) and only added 1/2 a cup of shortening.  It was phenomenal!!  I froze the extra so that I can use it for any decorating needs in the future - perfect decorating consistency, but tasty also.  I also needed to make a lemon buttercream icing, so I substituted the vanilla with lemon extract.  I could not stop "taste-testing".  Didn't give it 5 stars just because if it was made as is with 2 cups of shortening, I do believe it would be too greasy-tasting.  This is a keeper!

While this recipe is really good, it is definitely not for cakes to decorate in the Wilton fashion.  It is too soft to hold up intricate work.  Also, because of the cream, refrigeration is necessary.  Another reason to not use it on a large elaborate cake, unless you have a lot of room in your frig. But if you just want to frost a cake this is really delicious. I don't usually like to lick frosting, but this one is lickable.

This really is a GREAT RECIPE however I STRONGLY recommend using half unsalted butter for half the shortening and only 5 cups sifted powdered sugar (otherwise it would be much too sweet).  I also used real vanilla powder (less color than extract).  With the heavy cream, it becomes a terrificly light, fluffy frosting that spreads beautifully.  You could beat in slightly more sugar to part of the finished frosting if you want to use it to pipe roses (but don't use that much sugar to cover the whole cake).

After reading several reviews and seeing all the changes everyone made to this recipe, I looked for the opinion of someone who actually followed the recipe.  I followed it exactly and it is the best frosting I've used.  Fluffy, easy to work with, delicious and a beautiful white color.  Thank you, Rick!!

Yum!  This was the frosting for my daughter's first birthday cake (cake was Creay White Layers, filling was Lemon Filling-- both also on this site).  Wonderful, pretty, tasty frosting.  Here were my modifications, based on other reviews:
- I used 1 c. salted butter, 1 c. shortening, and omitted the salt; 
- I used only 4.5 cups of powdered sugar; 
- I used only 1/2 cup (4 oz.) heavy cream. 
Next time, I will only make 1/2 a recipe.  That would have been enough to liberally frost my filled 9-in. 2 layer cake.  I think it would be enough even if I were using this frosting to fill the cake.  Not that there's anything wrong with leftover frosting-- it's great with fresh strawberries and vanilla wafers!

I've tried any number of similar buttercream recipes from this site and most have been very good - after all, with minor variations they're pretty much the same.  This  recipe, however, sets itself apart from most others. First, it's reliable - the frosting comes out exactly as it's supposed to following the recipe just as written, so you can feel confident that very little, if any, tweaking is going to be required.  Second,  I like the addition of the salt, which noticeably heightens this frosting's flavor, as well as the heavy cream, which contributes a fresh, dairy taste, important when you're using shortening and imitation vanilla.  It spreads or pipes beautifully, LOOKS beautiful, and the bonus is that it tastes good too.  No wonder this frosting is such a hit on this site!  I used this to frost cupcakes made from the "Butter Pound Cake," recipe, also from this site.  It was like they were made for each other!

I was looking for a buttercream frosting recipe to use for my brother’s wedding cake and after trying several other recipes, and found this to be the best.  I reduced the amount of shortening by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup unsalted butter.  I also used real vanilla, not the clear vanilla, and the frosting was still very white in color.  This frosting was not only eat with a spoon good, but was a dream to work with and it held up very well to piping.  The frosting received rave reviews from wedding guests and from the bride and groom.

This is an amazing recipe! The only thing I changed is used 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter, and since I didn't have any clear vanilla extract I used Almond extract and it made all the difference! I used this to frost cupcakes that I took to work and EVERYONE went nuts over the frosting!

I first used this recipe for a shower cake and it was a big hit. My daughter wanted it for her wedding cake in May. It has such a smooth creamy taste unlike other buttercream. The wedding cake was done in the basket weave  and it turned out great. I even used it again for my neices wedding cake last week.It can be used for most decorating but not the very detailed.  Its the only buttercream I use now in my bakery.  Thank You for sharing it.

I;m not giving this recipe 5 stars because I did change some things with PHENOMENAL results!!! I used all real unsalted butter and real vanilla extract. It made some out of this world delicious buttercream! I also used only about half of the heavy cream so that the icing wouldn't get too soft for what I'm using it for (basketweave piping). It is perfect, rich, and melt-in-your-mouth. I suggest using butter and real vanilla. I could not stop licking the bowl :P I used this to fill and ice David's Yellow Cake (which is also scrumptious!).

This is THE BEST buttercream frosting!  I've been trying to decorate cakes for a couple of years and haven't been able to "perfect" the buttercream recipe.  THIS IS IT! I had no idea that you could whip up shortening all by itself just like that even with a hand mixer.  My husband almost ate a spoon full of just shortening because it looked so delicious!  It decorates a cake nicely, pipes well, and tastes great.  If you like a buttery taste, you may want to substitute a bit of butter in the recipe, but it was good for me.  It crusts a bit too so you can smooth it using the paper towel trick to look like fondant... everyone thought I used fondant.  So easy, so delicious. I will never use a different recipe again.

This a great recipe! I use it for cakes that I sell and never fail to get compliments. I do make two changes...I use only butter (shortening is an abomination) and I use REAL, high quality vanilla. My white frosting isn't necessarily brilliant white, but it's white enough that no one ever notices.

This recipe is terrific!  I have been skeptical of any recipes that call for crisco, but I substituted 3 parts butter and 1 part crisco, and it worked out great.  Any advice on how to store the frosting if I'm not going to use it for a few days?  Fridge, countertop?  How far in advance can I use it to make buttercream roses if I leave them in the fridge?  Thanks!!

I am one of the world's pickiest people when it comes to frosting.  Whenever I move to a new city I will try out all the bakery's until I find the one with the best frosting.  I was very skeptical when I made this but I am pleased to say that it deserves 5 stars for sure!  It was incredibly easy to make and yeilds a TON of frosting.  I used butter flavored crisco and though it came out slightly yellow (obviously), it colored nicely with food coloring.  This frosting is exactly what I was looking for.  For a thicker frosting only add 6 oz of the whipping cream.  For a lighter fluffier frosting add a couple more oz.  Be sure to only stir in the 6 called for oz first and THEN slowly add the other if desired.  It spreads easy, pipes easy, and tastes fabulous on everything!!!

This is the perfect buttercream frosting recipe!  The consistency and FLAVOR were exactly what I was looking for.  It's easy to mix up and easy to work with on cakes.  I took the advice of using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and it was delicious!  This is now my favorite frosting recipe!

I very rarely leave reviews, but I just have to say this frosting is AWESOME! OMG so good! I followed other reviewers tips to use 1-1/2 C shortening and 1/2 C butter, only used 7 C powdered sugar and it turned out great! Will be using this recipe from now on, thanks so much!! YUMMY!

Tasted like sickly sweet shortening. I was looking for a true buttery flavor, but didn't have enough butter so I thought I could use this recipe instead. It doesn't taste like a buttercream at all. Tastes like the filling of a Suzy-Q.

This is the most non-nasty greasy mouth frosting recipe ever! I hate buttercream because it's like eating a stick of butter or a spoon full of crisco!! But this was really great!!!! 
I did take a lot of people's advice and did 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter... I might do more 1 1/2 C butter and 1/2C shortening next time just to see if it would work.. Only because the thought of eating crisco nauseates me!!!
I sifted the 8C flour and it came out 9 cups.. I only added 8 Cups after the sift and it was fine fine fine. 
I also only added about 4oz of the whipping cream just to ensure that it was stiff enough to not go anywhere. I did add a dash more of the vanilla too. 
Overall this is what I will use when I need to do a kids cake from now on!!

I put my own twist on the frosting, rather than using all shortening, I used half the amount and the other half I used unsalted butter, it really made a nice frosting.

I've used this recipe for several batches of cupcakes.  The first time I made it exactly per the recipe.  The next few times I added a teaspoon of Wilton butter flavoring and a teaspoon of almond extract.  It was great both ways! I tinted my icings several colors and used the bag striping technique to decorate my cupcakes.  Great every time!

This frosting was pretty good - I read the reviews so I di d some the changes used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup butter shortening - I used a lot of confectioners sugar to get this to be pretty stiff it was quite runny - I do wish I has more sugar bec I would have liked the frosting to have been a bit more stiff for the cakes I was decorating all in all it was pretty good.

I have started decorating cakes and am working on finding good recipes for cakes and frostings. I have been using another buttercream recipe, but this blows it out of the water!! I followed the other reviewers and substituted butter for half the shortening. I also added a little almond flavoring. The result was the fluffiest, most buttery, melt-in-your-mouth frosting I could have imagined. I can't wait to have my co-workers sample this next cake!!! Thank you!!!!!

I use this for all my cakes and cupcakes, I use all butter, sift the icing sugar and double the vanilla, usually I start with 1/4 cup of the cream then add as needed depending on the season,  great for decorating and frosting.
If I want a softer frosting I use half butter and half soy margarine.
Full batch frosted 75 cupcakes with 1M tip and had about 1 cup leftover.

I did not enjoy this frosting at all! I was really excited because of all the great reviews, but I did not care for it at all! I felt like I was eating pure Crisco! Maybe it would be better if was butter flavored Crisco? I I don't know it left a terrible taste in my mouth!

All I have to say is yum. This icing piped perfectly, and made my cupcakes look better than the store version. Wonderful recipe. I may try half butter half shortening next time, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is OUTSTANDING!! It tastes EXACTLY like the frosting at the bakery. I needed a durable frosting for cupcakes for my son's school and this was it! Thank so much for sharing!
Oh, I halved the recipe b/c seriously - it made a LOT of frosting and I didn't need THAT much! But it came out perfect - I forgot to buy heavy cream & used 2% milk (b/c that's all I had) Perfect fluffy frosting is what I got!  I will not be looking for another recipe - this will be my go-to frosting from now on. Will never buy yucky canned frosting again!!

Definitely an amazing buttercream! Definitely taste like the local bakery. It did have an bit of a heavy shortening taste. I would follow another reviewer's advice and use half shortening and butter. I also only had 1/4 cup cream so I used milk and all was good!

Not bad, if you don't mind the taste that comes from all shortening and no butter.  Holds up really well in the heat, but I won't make it again...love real butter buttercream too much!

Very good, 1 used 1c shortening and 1c butter.  Was not too sweet and not too bland, just right!  I frosted 3 layers and had enough extra to do a rosette border around the top and bottom, rosettes and dots all over the sides and still had over a cup of frosting left.  Perfect!

Awesome recipe!!  Really easy to make.  Don't get Confectioner's sugar (powdered) and Granulated sugar mixed up though, like I did.  I agree with other people that less sugar should be used.  I used 6 cups of sugar and it was pretty sweet.  I should have actually used less sugar since I made this for my son's 1st birthday cake.  I love frosting anyway, so I'll just have to eat the rest.

This was my first trial at the buttercream and this recipe totally rocked!! I sifted the confectioners sugar as per one of the tips in some other recipe which took a lot of time. Otherwise, I will  use this recipe everytime I make cupcakes or cake!!

The texture was perfect, but the taste was not for me.  I ended up tossing the whole thing.  It tasted just like shortening.  My kids tasted it and didn't care for it either.

Hands-down best basic, WHITE frosting!  Like other reviewers mentioned, it's so universal and can be easily modified. Sometimes I don't have shortening or I don't have butter.  My best mix is 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. It doesn't taste too much like a bakery frosting, but it's not too rich, either.  I've added coloring/flavoring and each time it gets tons of compliments.  This recipe is easily cut in half or doubled depending on your needs.  I store leftover frosting in a tupperware or even in freezer bags and it always tastes as great.  Perfect consistency for spreading and can easily be adjusted by adding more/less cream.  I've also used milk when I didn't have cream and got great results. Thanks for the recipe!!

I can't understand how this recipe got 5 stars. I followed directions exactly as shown and it was so greasy tasting. It tasted like sweetened grease. I'll never waste my time and money on this recipe again.

Excellent frosting!  I used regular real vanilla (not clear) and it worked just fine.  I put the leftovers in the fridge, and it seemed to get even better the following days.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I don't think this recipe really needs another glowing review, but here it is.  This was wonderful, tasty and easy to make.  I used 1 cup of butter and 1 of shortening.  The color was creamy white and easy to spread.  This is a keeper.  I am not a Wilton cake maker so I need a frosting that is pretty and doesn't need special tools to make a pretty cake.

This was really good! I followed everyone's advice of using half butter and half shortening, and im glad i did so. even with a full cup of shortening AND a full cup of butter, the bowl still smelled greasy. the important part was that it didnt taste greasy, so definitely use half butter, half shortening. Also, DO NOT USE 8C SUGAR! i used 7 and it was too much, so i had to add more heavy cream. i'd advice using 5 and a half cups of sifted powdered sugar and then add to your personal taste. the clear imitation vanilla extract has too many unnecessary restrictions. my vanilla extract was alcohol free, meaning it had a thicker consistency and was dark brown-ish but my buttercream still came out snow white. i advise using pure vanilla extract. good luck! :)

I have used this recipe multiple times.  Everyone in the family always asks for a piece to take home.  Do as users say 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  And there is a flavoring called WEDDING BOUQUET.  They call it the baker's secret.  And it is!!!  It makes cakes and frosting taste amazing!   ENJOY!!!!

Great recipe! I just finished making this a while ago and finished decorating my friends Bday cake. I only made half of this since her cake isn't large. Instead of shortening I used butter (I'm not a big fan of shortening). The recipe called for 4 cups of confectioners' sugar. I only used two and already, that's as much sweetness as I needed (and probably a tad too much). I also made it into chocolate buttercream frosting. I added 1/4 of a cup of cocoa powder to 1 cup of butter 2 cups of sugar 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream (half of the recipe with 2 cups of sugar omitted) Great recipe nevertheless. I will start using this every time I make a cake.

Awesome frosting and so versatile. I have used this for both cakes and cookies and licking off the spoon for girl time. I have used the heavy cream but have also substituted half&half as well as whole and 2% milk. So easy to play around with

I used half shortening and half butter (love the butter taste, but shortening seems to set better) and it turned out perfect.  It was delicious and set well.  This is my new go-to recipe for buttercream frosting, thanks!

This is the last buttercream recipe I will ever try.  I tried is with 3 parts shortening and 1 part butter.  It tasted exactly how I wanted to.  If you do all shortening, I think it would taste exactly like bakery icing.  If you want a more buttery taste, it's easy to adjust the ratio.

This was great for a piping or decorative border. The taste isnt so great. If you use 1/2 butter  1/2 shortening the taste is much butter for icicng.  I added some melted white chocolate ...that was very good !!!  Frosted a cake for a wedding shower ...it was loved!!

This buttercream frosting is awesome, with some of my own changes.  As is the recipe works fine, but I prefer my buttercream frosting to actually use real butter, so that's what I did.  I substituted real, salted butter for the shortening and omitted the extra call for salt, although the adding it wouldn't have hurt.  I also used non-fat milk, but that was only because I didn't have any heavy cream in the fridge.    The key to making this, or any frosting, is to first cream your butter and then add the confectioners sugar slowly.  If you add it all it once, you'll end up with a big clumpy mess.  Adding the sugar slowly allows time for everything to come together.    Very smooth frosting and very tasty.  This is my go-to buttercream frosting recipe from now on!!!!!

This recipe tastes just like the buttercream frosting they use at bakeries and grocery store bakeries. Easy to make, delicious and PERFECT for decorating. I recently started a cake decorating business...this is my go-to recipe for icing for all of my cakes. Add some cocoa powder to make it chocolatey, or flavored oils to give it any flavor you like...orange, lemon, rasberry...YUM!

I'm very picky about frosting, but this was a keeper! I read many reviews prior and noticed a bunch of people recommended using part/all butter as a replacement for shortening. I used butter flavored shortening and wish I didn't. Despite it being 'buttercream', it had an overwhelming butter taste. I had to add additional vanilla to mask the taste. I recommend using regular shortening!

I first tried it with all shortening as the recipe stated and felt like it just tasted like greasy shortening. I had leftover ingredients so I tried a second batch with half butter as recommended by others. It wasn't much better. What a waste of time and ingredients :(

Really good frosting. Not too sweet. I halved the recipe and did half butter and half shortening. Came out perfectly
and was super easy to spread.

I paired this frosting with a dark chocolate cake I also found on this site.

I tried this recipe straight up, followed the directions to a tee, and without any ingredient alterations.  I LOVED the texture and how well this frosting stood up to all the piping I do.  This recipe makes A LOT of frosting, but it is ok.  The frosting gets better with time.  A week later I used the leftovers on some cookies, and it was AWESOME!!!  One change that I have made on my next batch was adding 1 tsp. of butter extract and it was even more scrumptious.  GREAT recipe!!!

Instead of shortening, I used butter (1 1/2 cups) and then 1/2 cup shortening.  I make all the birthday cakes for my family and have taken cake decorating classes.  This is BY FAR the best icing I have made.  The whipping cream makes all the difference in the world.

I am a big baker and this was my go to frosting for years.  Until I learned about the extreme health hazards of trans fats (~ shortening).  This is about the worst thing you can eat healthwise (10x worse than animal fat).  I've thrown all of it all of my house and you'll notice that the best bakeries all use butter, not shortening, frosting.  Plus butter based frostings taste better.  I shutter that so many people are still baking with it and eating it.  If you don't believe me, then look at NYC and California who have banned this from restaurants.  This is what fast food restaurants use and manufacturers use to extend the shelf life of food.

Hands down excellent recipe. I normally use another one on here, but decided to switch it up a bit. Light and airy, and really creamy. I'm pretty pleased with my overall batch. Used this to make Turkey bird cupcakes and really ones. TY I will use this again.

I could only give this 4 stars because I altered the recipe. I have a problem with a frosting being called "butter"cream when there isn't any butter used (and it doesn't remotely taste like buttercream - to me at least). I did what someone else did, I substituted 1 cup of butter for 1 cup of the shortening and it came out with the "butter" taste. Although I make real buttercream frosting, this is so easy and most wouldn't even know the difference, so this will be my frosting for everything except the specialties for which I will stick to my real buttercream recipe. Enjoy.  This is good with 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter.

Cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 cup shortening 1/4 cup butter and almond extract instead of vanilla... SOOO GOOD! I don't care for frosting and it was amazing! paired it with one bowl chocolate cake from this site and raspberry preserves in the middle. Was better than a bakery.

Delicious! I made it almost to recipe. I used 1.5 cups shortening and .5 cups butter. i wanted the richness butter gave but without the buttery flavor. i also only added .5 teaspoons vanilla-i didnt have any clear and i didnt want to taint the color, but it gave it just enough of the taste. I havent put it on my cake yet, but i think it will work wonders! 5 stars from someone who doesnt like icing? *points to self* is a really good icing.

Wonderful!!! I used half shortening and half unsalted butter. I used my Kitchenaid and whipped the heck out of it :) I also used regular vanilla extract, not clear, and my frosting was very white so I was glad I didn't make a special trip to the store for the clear :) Very delicious buttercream frosting and I will most definitely make this again!

I'll agree with everyone that by using this recipe as a guide -- making the adjustments that suit your preference for buttery flavor and coloring or shortening consistency and clean hue -- that it is indeed special. Buttercream frosting will forever be the top frosting, but I never realized what was missing by settling for a few tablespoons of milk rather than heavy cream.   I was in a hurry when I made it this first time, but I know I could have increased the flavor with more attention. I was slightly disappointed myself and didn't particularly like the flavor (too shortening-like), however the birthday girl was happy, so that was the okay signal to stop fussing.

Yum-my. Just like the stuff you get at the store, but not quite as thick. Frosted on David's yellow cake from this site. I recommend this more to cover cakes, not as much for decoration since it is not as stiff

This was my first attempt at buttercream frosting. I didn't have whip cream so I just used milk. That's probably why I was slightly disappointed with this. I was hoping for something with the taste and texture of the buttercream frosting from  Publix grocery store. If anyone knows of a recipe like that, please let me in on the secret!

I'm a rather novice cook and even less of a baker. I made this yesterday for my two-year old's birthday party. I halved the recipe to frost a 13 x 9 cake. I had about a cup of frosting leftover. I used other reviewer's advice and made it with half butter and half shortening. I cut down on the salt because I used salted butter.  

At first when the frosting was done it tasted a little greasy, but I decided to go ahead and use it anyway. I had to stick it in a fridge for an hour before I could frost the cake.  That must have helped because after I frosted the cake, it was delicious, light and sweet. I will definitely use this frosting from now on.

Okay.  First, let me say that the consistency, texture, and overall flexibility of this recipe gives it a 5-star rating.  What drops it down is the greasy aftertaste tha I cannot seem to get rid of.  I did read most of the reviews for this recipe and I tried it both ways.  Using all vegetable shortening, doesn't give me the rich buttercream flavor that I like, but it's great as it is.  I tried the recipe doing half vegetable shortening and half butter flavored shortening and I love the flavor, but not the greasy after taste.  I am hesitant to try all butter because I know it won't hold up as well as using shortening.  I haven't found the Alpine shortening, but I will keep looking.  So, the recipe is great, but it's not what I'm looking for.  I'll keep trying once I get the Alpine shortening and post a second review.

When my daughter asked for white frosting on her birthday cake I was disappointed because I basically think sugar without chocolate is a waste of sugar, but was I surprised at this frosting!  It was GREAT!  It makes a lot, even cut in half we had plenty leftover after frosting a two-layer eight inch cake, so be warned!  I also didn't use any shortening, only (salted) butter, so I left out the salt, which was perfect for us.  If your butter is unsalted, then shake away.  Overall, a terrific buttercream recipe!

Yum! I am not a huge frosting person, but I was able to lick the bowl completely clean! It has the taste of bakery buttercream frostings. This recipe makes enough to frost 2 layer cakes. I happened to make two cakes on this occasion, but for future times I will half the recipe.

Rick, you rock!  I made this frosting to go over a vegan chocolate cake for my daughter's first b-day, and got rave reviews.  So easy and yummy!  I split the shortening with butter, half and half.  I also put in only about 6 c. of the sugar.  So good I'll never buy frosting again. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! I have been using this recipe for over 3yrs now and have never heard a complaint. I also add 2 TBS of Wilson Meringue to help stiffen the frosting for decorating. I will not use any other buttercream recipe..

This is by far the most exquisite buttercream I've ever worked with. I run a cake business from home and have researched and researched for a buttercream icing that i will find satisfactory. I didn't. so i've been working with swiss meringue buttercream for two years. the problem? it's expensive and time consuming. I'm so glad I found this recipe though because it's now going to be replacing my swiss meringue. To tell you a little about the icing, it's exactly as the reviewers have been saying it: it's light and fluffy and doesn't have an artificial flavor to it. I had no problem's icing my cakes and readying them for fondant. This recipe is very forgiving, I used 1.5 c. shortening and 0.5 c butter. I wouldn't have given it five stars with all shortening though. I also used a cup less sugar as I don't like my icing overly sweet and upped the vanilla by another tsp--so adjust to your liking basically. Try this recipe, you won't regret it. Thank you for posting this and changing my life!! I'm soo thankful.

This is great, especially if it can sit for a day for the flavors to meld.  We used it to decorate a graduation cake.    It holds color beautifully, and holds up well even in humidity.

Add the butter, it needs it.  However, I will say that it worked great for decorating.  It just came out tasting a little too much like shortening.  But in other ways, it was a great recipe.

This was perfect frosting. I made this to put on a baby shower cake and the response to it was great.  Better than bakery is what I was told.  I did follow the suggestion of switching out half the shortening for unsalted butter so I didn't follow it exactly but close enough for me to feel comfortable rating it 5 stars

Sorry, I just thought it was tasteless - it did remind me of grocery store bakery frosting, which I don't usually care for...  I ended up adding an extra teaspoon of salt and a package of softened cream cheese and then it tasted great.

I was hoping for a thicker, richer buttercream, like Trophy cupcakes or similar. This buttercream is a bit light and greasy. Tastes fine, but doesn't have the denser texture I wanted.

It tastes VERY good but it doesn't hold its shape too well unless just out of the refrigerator. It does say that it's ideal for "frosting & borders" which it's great for so I gave it 5 stars + it's delicious. I agree with the others that you can sub. some of the shortening with butter (unsalted) and if you don't have cream you can sub. whole milk or half & half. It does taste pretty awesome, so if you're using it for a simple cake (or like we did, on a cookie "cake") it'll work perfectly & be yummy. It is definitely not a good "glue" nor stable enough for more intricate designs & detail.

I am very sorry to be one of the few reviewers that did not like this. To give it a fair review, I made it exactly as stated and it does undoubtedly make an excellent spreading icing that could be piped easily. I just personally did not like the flavour at all, it tasted more like the kind of icing I'd expect to find on a supermarket bought cake rather than a homemade one. Next time I shall use all butter...but then using butter at all would make it a different recipe!

Made this frosting this morning for a very special cake, my son's going away party (heading to Fort Benning, GA next week). After reading several reviews and personal preferrence I made a couple changes. I used sweet cream butter instead of shortening, omitted the salt, changed the sugar to 6 cups (my husband doesn't like super sweet frosting) and used between 5 & 6 ounces of heavy cream. WOW!!!! This is the best buttercream recipe I have come across, way better than anything I've had out of a bakery. I used about 1/2 cup of the frosting, thinned down with cream, to use as a crumb coat...worked perfectly. I know I changed the recipe, but I still give it 5 stars...was a great recipe to work with. =-)

This is delicious, but I completely agree with other reviewers who have recommended to split the shortening half-and-half with butter (1 C. each). The consistency makes it much easier to work with and it doesn't taste so greasy. Yum!

::Update:: Just used this frosting again for an owl cake. It works fantastic in a frosting tube! I just bought a nordicware cupcake froster. The frosting flows right out of it. Wonderful!

Absolutly delightful! I hate,HATE,hate the Wilton buttercream frosting recipe. I was using another with all butter for a truly "buttercream" icing. It tastes wonderful but gets too soft for decorating details. This is the best of both worlds. I now have a buttercream recipe that I can say that I love! Also, the first batch I made was with the cream which is a great addition, the second batch I didn't have the cream so I made it with milk. It still came out perfect, although not quite as rich tasting. So, FYI, if you don't have the cream, still try this one with milk. You won't be sorry!

Holy cow!! This is the best frosting ever! It's so rich and so delicious. It just ramps up the tastiness of anything you put it on! It's so creamy and light.  Fabulous recipe. My new go-to frosting. I usually half the recipe though because I hardly ever need 7 1/2 cups of frosting...not that I mind having that much on hand. ;)

This frosting is by far, the best!! I read the reviews about making with butter vs. shortening, and I made mine with butter flavored shortening!  I did not have any heavy cream so used half and half instead.  I also cut the recipe in half and half again since I only had 24 cupcakes to frost, and it was the perfect amount.  I used one box of powdered sugar (16 oz) and did have to use a little more cream.  Perfect consistency and also had a nice sheen to it.  Not too sweet either.  Will definitely be my go-to frosting from now on!

It's a KEEPER!  Thank you Rick!  My husband and I have been watching Cupcake Wars and he decided he wanted to try and find the most moist chocolate cupcake recipe and the best frosting (that tastes like our favorite bakery).  This was the first time I ever made a cake or icing from scratch.  The chocolate cake turned out good and moist (my nanna's recipe), but could be a little more chocolatey -- we are still working on tweaking that, but the icing recipe my mom gave me (that was her sister's) flopped.  It was awful.  But, of course, it didn't come with all of the wonderful tips from reviewers to help assit me in my first 'from scratch' endeavor.  I was really skeptical but HOPEFUL when I found this recipe and all of the reviews.  I didn't want to make a huge batch in case it didn't work out, so I adjusted the servings to 18 and based on that and the reviews: I whipped the  out of 1/2 cup shortening, then added 1/2 cup SALTED butter, and continued to beat it like crazy while SIFTING 4 Cups Confectioner's Sugar and blending into the mix, then added 1 teaspoon clear Vanilla and 1/4 Cup + 2 Tablespoons Heavy Whipping Cream.  I blended it all and then turned the sucker on high.  I did add 1/4 oz more of the whipping cream.  I did not use salt since I used the salted butter.  It was still a little thick and could probably use more cream, but my husband couldn't wait to taste test it for me.  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!

I made this EXACTLY as listed and it was a great frosting for decorating. It was too sweet for most of the adults at the party but my 3rd old, who doesn't finish cake, asked for a second slice. Wonderful for children, maybe a tad sweet for adults unless you are serving very small slices and something with the cake to tone down the flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again for my children's cakes and cupcakes. Next time I will use the 1.5 cup crisco and .5 cup butter though.

This frosting is amazing!!!  It tastes like frosting from the bakery with the perfect consistency for pipping.  At the recommendation of other reviewers, I took the shortening to 1.5 cups and .5 cup butter.  I did not use 8 cups of sugar, more like 7.  It turned out excellent.  This is my new go to frosting recipe.  One word of caution, it makes a LOT of frosting.  I made 24 cupcakes and still had about half the frosting left over.

This was a great recipe! I used half butter and half shortening and added some instant Chia Tea mix to make chia tea buttercream!  Excellent! I always find its much better the next day, for some reason the sugar seems to blend in more so its not grainy, so I always make and frost the cake/cupcakes the day before I need them.

I'm giving 4 stars because the frosting went over big with my daughter's birthday guests, but I myself - a pastry chef-in-training - didn't care much for it.  My pastry mentor told me that I could sub butter for the shortening next time, so that's what I'm going to do.  I think shortening has a wierd aftertaste, so hopefully the butter sub will eliminate that.  I am happy, though, that it made a big enough batch to cover a 2 layer cake, plus a crumb layer and a filling layer.  And it piped beautifully.

I took other reviewer's recommendations and used 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter.  I also used pure vanilla extract, but used a little less than 2 teaspoons.  I used a little bit more salt and about 1 cup more confectioners' sugar than called for.  (It came out perfectly white, no problems).  Make sure you beat this for over 5 minutes.  Let me tell you, I am an icing junkie and this rates up there with the best!!  It tasted exactly like icing from the bakery.  Thank you for the recipe, I'll definitely be making this again!!!

This is fantastic and easy.  I did substitute and use 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening.  I frosted 24 cupcakes and put the extra in the freezer.  I love that it made a lot.  My family loves this recipe.  Last night at bedtime my son said, "That frosting was really good, Mom!"  Awww.

I really like this buttercream, though it isn't as sweet as I thought it would be.  It made a lot and I actually stored the remainder of it in my refrigerator for over a month and was still as good as the day I made it.

This is a very functional recipe as I have been in the cake industry for some time.  The secret is to beat/beat/beat the frosting for at least 10 minutes to thorougly dissolve the powdered sugar.  You can use popcorn salt (finer ground) for the salt as this cuts back on the greasy taste.  Great Tasting

This recipe is the absolute best I've ever made.  Like others before me I made modifications due to personal taste & used 1 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, which yielded a great consistency & awesome taste.  One suggestion for those who have had issues w/ this recipe: Use a stand mixer and mix the ingredients for at least 10 minutes.  There's no such thing as overmixing with this recipe. I will continue to use this recipe as I haven't found one that even comes close to its quality.  No greasy after taste with this one.  Thanks Rick!

I first tried it with the half shortening/half butter option that many people were raving about, and it still left that icky film on the roof of our mouths.  Then I tried it with all butter and no shortening, and it didn't stand at all!  Granted, it was August, and hotter than Hades, but still, even after leaving the cake in the fridge all day, my meticulously piped stars ended up shapeless and bloated.  Maybe it would have held better with the shortening, but who wants to eat greasy frosting, no matter how beautiful it looks?

this was really great to work with and tasted good. I do like something with a little more flavor though so I would probaby use this again for decorations and boarders only but not as the main frosting.

This recipe is enough to frost 4 dozen cupcakes. You can half it if you like. I love this recipe and have been using it for 4 years. I have also added lemon extract to make a delicious lemon frosting. This is an excellant recipe!

If  I could  give  this more  than  5 stars, I  would.  It  is  PERFECT  frosting. I am the  cake  decorator  in our family and I make  all the  b-day, wedding, special occasion cakes  for all family members and friends. They say my cakes  beat  the  bakery hands  down, and  they LOVE  this frosting. Those  who say  this  frosting tastes like shortening....well its  made of  shortening, ALL buttercream frosting is, but  if  you beat the shortening really  well, you will have a less  greasy frosting.

Yum Yum Yum!  This is so good!  I used 1/2 butter flavored shortening and 1/2 real butter and real vanilla extract, not the fake stuff.  It was so good!  I am very proud of myself and my fam was impressed.

This was so good!!! I followed the recipe exactly and my husbands homemade chocolate cake looked beautiful with this icing! I even got out a cake decorating set we received as a wedding gift last year and decorated! The icing spread beautifully. 
Thanks for this recipe!!! A keeper. My family raved about the cake, especially the teenagers.
As a relative cooking novice, can someone tell me the reason for using half shortening, half butter? Thanks.!!!!!

I have used this recipe before and tried something new. I added about 12 fresh pureed strawberries to the cream to add a hint of strawberry. It balanced very nicely with the strawberry ice cream center of my daughter's birthday cake. I also toyed with the idea of adding strawberry Quik to the cream but didn't. My one recommendation is to please make sure you us butter or ensure the margerine is soft enough. I used smart balance this time because I forgot to buy real butter as I usually use and it left chunks that I could not beat out!

This is a very good recipe.  When I first made the icing it was very sweet but after a couple of days it changed.  It had more of a whipped cream taste after being placed in the refrigerator.  I liked it a lot and so did my family.

I decided to try this for a friend's wedding cake, and it was a huge hit! It was really light and creamy, and not too sweet.  The only change I made was I used half butter and half shortening. This will be my go-to frosting recipe!

I rate it 5 stars with the exception that you use REAL salted butter. There is a reason is is called buttercream! The best frosting EVER. I have used it to decorate several cakes and it holds up nicely. I really was not a frosting person until this frosting found me! Not too sweet or waxy tasting (with the butter!) I get so many compliments on it. I like using coconut extract to flavor it...delish over chocolate cake layered with coconut pecan filling!

I made this with half butter, half shortening the night before a Memorial Day party--half of the recipe was still enough to frost a two-layer cake with fruit between the layers, with some left over.  The frosting did melt slightly in the 90-degree heat and un-air conditioned car, but in general held up quite well!  Absolutely delicious and was devoured on arrival.

The perfect frosting recipe! I have even used it to make cream cheese frosting with this recipe as a guideline substituting half the butter for cream cheese(more if you want a stronger cream cheese taste).

I ADORE this frosting.  However, it didn't seem sweet enough for my family.  They said it tasted a little like cheap Wal Mart frosting, so the next time I made it, I did it with half butter and half shortening. Made all the difference.  Use lemon extract instead of vanilla, and yellow food coloring and you have a great lemon frosting for spring!

This was a great frosting to work with!  I took the advise of a few other reviewers and used 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups shortening.  I also cut it in half to use to frost one double layer 9" cake...big mistake!!!  I did not have enough frosting.

I used half butter have half Crisco, but next i think i will use 3/4 butter and 1/4 Crisco. 
I also added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp almond extract it was perfect. I can’t wait to make this again.

This is so light and fluffy and not too sweet, I cut the recipe in half since I'm covering the cake in marshmallow fondant. took out half the frosting to dirty ice the cake and added crushed oreo cookies to the remaining frosting for a cookies and cream filling.

This is a great recipe, as written. This recipe by this submitter appears on this site as "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting" and I would warn you that that one has incorrect ratio of fluid:sugar. I halved the recipe and used all shortening (even though butter would taste better -- I need this frosting to set up without being refrigerated nonstop) and thought the cream lent the shortening a rich mouth-feel (as opposed to the milk-shortening buttercreams, which have a sort of greasy mouth-feel). Thanks for the recipe!

just be aware that shortening is FULL of trans fats. with 2 cups, this recipe is loaded. Butter is not great for us either, but certainly less toxic and a better ingredient in baked goods than trans-fat loaded shortening.

Perfect consistency, not too sweet but just right. I used 1 1/2 cups of crisco and 1/2 cup of butter. I needed chocolate frosting as well so I just added baking coco powder to taste (about 3tbs) to half of  the mixture and it was wonderful. Also note the original recipe makes a ton. You could half it and have PLENTY for a whole cake.

This butterbream was absolutely fantastic. I did however substitute 1 cup of shortening with 1 cup of butter as per other reviews. My entire family loved it and all agreed it was the best buttercream I've ever made. This recipe is a keeper!!

AMAZING!!!! I'll never have to search fr another buttercream icing recipe. THANK YOU! After reading the reviews the only thing I did differently was use 1 1/2 cup of Shortening and 1/2 cup of butter vs. 2 cups of Shortening.  PERFECT.  PERFECT. PERFECT.

I loved the texture of this frosting because it is great for decorating and it holds well in warm temperatures. However, the only thing that makes me not so crazy about this recipe is that is really has no flavor. Buttercream you need butter flavor so maybe adding a litttle butter extract would help. You can substitute half butter for the shortening but be aware that it will melt a lot faster.

great to work with, didn't have to add any extra cream.  After being chilled overnight in the fridge it didn't melt after 2 hours  in the heat of July for my son's birthday party, and I have had a lot of frostings melt off the cake!  I used regular vanilla extract, just makes it slightly off-white, but I colored it too.

This buttercream frosting is like the kind you get from bakeries; very light and fluffy and not too sweet.  It colors really nicely too.  When you mix the butter/shortening and icing sugar, it will look crumbly at first, but just keep blending and it eventually it becomes a thick paste to which you add the whipping cream and vanilla.  Believe me, the extra blending time is worth it!  Delicious.

I used this recipe to make the frosting for my kiddo's birthday cake - SO yummy.  I did use unsalted butter versus shortening; we don't use shortening for a whole lot, and I'd have to buy a big tub of it (we'd buy Spectrum's if we did buy some, and that's the only size they sell) - but everyone loved it just the same!

This has got to be the best buttercream frosing hands down. The only slight change I made was 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. Aside from that don't change a thing and your cakes will be the talk of the town! It's my go to recipe from now own.

After reading some of reviews and having made a buttercream frosting before, I did make some changes. Like adding 1 cup (2 sticks) of unsalted butter, with 1 cup of shortening. I did reduce the cups of sugar to 5. However, I didn't have any confectioners' sugar left after the 2nd cup, so I just refined cane sugar, just not enough. It made of kinda of gritty. I did add 2 tsp of pure orange extract to go with the ghirardelli dark chocolate cupcakes. People loved it, but I just didn't care for it, I think the shortening doesn't go very well because its greaser than butter and cream cheese.

i tried this recipe as written first and really disliked it. the taste of the shortening was just too artificial for me. i salvaged it with some butter and cream cheese but ended up with way more than i bargained for. the next time i used this, i used all butter instead of shortening, halved the recipe, added half a cup less sugar, and full tsp. salt. sooo much better. it was delicious! this will be my go to recipe from now on.

I used 1/2 cup shortening. 1 cup butter, 4 cups sugar, 1/2 tsp salt1 tsp real vanilla, 1/3 cup heavy cream. It probably would have been way too sweet for me if I had used the full amount of sugar.

This is a really good frosting and the consistency was great, however, I used all shortening and I think next time I would try substituting maybe half of that with butter. Had a little bit of that taste to it where it coats your mouth (if you know what I mean) all in all though it was good and I would probably make it again.

not too sweet if you use 6 c icing sugar instead of 8; consistency is just right!

I use this frosting regularly, as written, with half butter/half shortening, and with all butter. Each has a slightly different texture and taste; all are delicious. Half the recipe will fill and frost a 2-layer, 9" cake, but it also keeps well, so feel free to make the whole batch. An all-around great recipe.

The BEST buttercream icing I have ever had! My mom & I are both professional bakers & have used the Wilton Buttercream frosting for years. On a whim, I decided to try something new and came across this recipe. I used 1 1/2 cup shortening & 1/2 cup butter instead of 2 cups shortening & used a total of 10 oz heavy cream to give it a thinner consistency. It was AMAZING and Everyone LOVED it. It turned out to be my best cake ever!!

This is an amazing frosting, it's easy and tastes great! I added some chocolate and peppermint to make it taste like a "Junior Mint". FANTASTIC! Doesn't get much better than this!

Great texture and easy to pipe with, but not a lot of flavor since there is no butter. Would probably be a great base if you add extracts, crushed oreos, etc. I will probably make this again and add something to give it more flavor.

I used butter in place of the shortening and used skim milk instead of heavy cream.  Turned out great. I piped onto cupcakes.

This recipe makes a lot of frosting so if you need it just to decorate a 9 inch double or rectangle cake then i would suggest cutting it in half. This frosting is actually quite tasty and not too sweet like I thought it would be. It has has great texture and works perfect for decorating :) I had a bit of raspberry extract to mine for a nice flavor

Loved the recipe-  cut it in half to 18 servings and was able to frost about 20 regular sized cupcakes :) Definitely would use 1/2 butter next time, since it seemed to lack the buttery taste due to using the shortening-  loved the texture though! Thanks so much~

I love the frosting on the cakes that I buy from the bakery. So for my sons first Birthday I decided that it would be special if I made his cake. That said, I was on the search for the perfect bakery frosting replica. Tons of frosting videos and recipes later I found this. PERFECT! Even on my first try this frosting was GREAT!! Highly recommended for those with a SWEET Tooth!

This is a wonderful frosting recipe! I used butter flavored shortening but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will probably use half butter flavor shortening and half regular shortening as it was a little too buttery, but my guests said it was perfect as is...you be the judge.

Yum Yum Yum! I halved the recipe for a 9x13 cake. Also, I use a little less sugar. I have made this several times, and have tried replacing the heavy cream with 1% milk and with water, and it turns out great no matter what.

This was my very first time making homemade frosting.  I followed the directions of some of the other reviews and did 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter....I used only 5 or 6 cups of sugar...it turned out wonderful!! I made strawberry cupcakes with this icing for my hubbies bday and the icing piped out wonderfully....and it was very tastey...thank you so much

This frosting was ALMOST perfect- the texture was spot on, it spread well, and most importantly it didn't taste like crisco! The only problem is the salt. I was suspicious when I saw that on the list but I decided to add it anyway and let me tell you- salty frosting is less than appetizing. However, it was awesome otherwise and I highly recommend it. Just leave out the salt!

I'll definitely use this one again, and I'll likely give it 5 stars next time. The problem: the weather is too hot! I used all butter, and let it sit out to soften while I was at work. By the time I returned home, it was partially melted. I had to add extra sugar to get a decent consistency. I thought it was a tad on the sweet side but my siblings loved it (and considering it was a birthday cake for one of them, I think their opinion counts more anyway!).

I have one tip. Do not use butter flavored shortening! I thought I'd change up the recipe a bit and use butter flavored crisco. Mistake! I tossed the whole batch. All I tasted....was butter - and it was gross. I re-made it as-is and it was great! Yum.

Best.  Buttercream.  Ever.  Exactly what I wanted.  I generally use real butter (instead of the shorting) for taste.  Yummy!

I am the kind of person who sits down to a piece of bakery cake and immediately removes the frosting. Icings are often too sweet or greasy for me, so I usually don't eat them. Today, I was looking for a frosting that would hold up in my first attempt to decorate a cake. The ratings and reviews  convinced me to try this, especially since so many reviewers found that it held up to decorating. I took reviewers' recommendations to cut down on the shortening and add some butter and to cut the sugar to avoid excessive sweetness. The reviews have been accurate in that this frosting went on well and made great decorations and writing. Unfortunately, it left a greasy taste in my mouth. I even used the whole 8 cups of sugar thinking that this would disguise the greasy mouth feel. No luck. The reviewers are right: this tastes just like a bakery frosting. The rating above reflects that; if bakery frosting is your thing, this recipe is great. If you don't like that sort of icing, you will not like this one.

This is tastes just like the bakery frosting. Wow - Excellent!!   It was great to work with to decorate my Super Bowl XLIV Cake and I used disposable pastry bags.  I also tinted the frosting.  It held up well.  It is not necessary to refrigerate the cake after frosting.  Cover cake and store in a cool dry place works great.  I put fancy frill toothpicks so the clear wrap wouldn't touch the frosting to store.  Half of this recipe is enough to frost and decorate a 9x13 inch cake but if I was going to slice in half and fill I would of make the entire recipe.  Thanks Rick - been looking for a great frosting recipe for a long time - this is Definitely It!!

Used 1 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter, and reduced sugar to 5 cup, otherwise kept true to the recipe. It's consistency is excellent, and the only complaint I have is knowing I can't assemble my 50 cupcakes ahead of time, because I just don't have the room in the fridge, and I'm topping with a little bit of fondant. I might take the chance if it were January....but it's August, so...last minute put-together it is.   The flavor is good too. Kids love it, and it will go in my box as THE buttercream recipe to use when I don't want to cook.

I love the taste of this buttercream!!!   I followed the suggestion of others to use 1c shortening and 1c butter and only 5/6 c sugar.  My only issue...a little too soft compared to what I'm used to.  Any ideas on how to stiffen up some?

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was perfectly delicious. I did make a minor change. I really don't enjoy the flavor of shortening based frostings so instead of using plain white shortening, I used the butter flavored shortening and a couple tablespoons of real butter.I could've used all butter in place of the shortening but I wanted to do some decorations so the shortening was necessary. I decided to make this a lemon buttercream so in place of the vanilla I used lemon extract and few teaspoons of lemon zest. My 80 year old grandmother who is the expert baker in my family asked me for the recipe. It was a hit.

Easy and tasty! I didn't want the greasy taste & texture of just shortening, so I used half butter and half shortening. I also halved the recipe and it still made more than I needed. Easy to work with -

Fantastic!!  Just like the bakery's frosting... I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups shortening and 2 lbs. of sugar.  I'll never use another recipe

I used 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening. It is amazing the next day! Also if you are having trouble with the frosting separating and being greasy, make sure that the shortening that you are using has at least 1 grams of trans fat in the ingredients (therefore not Crisco). If it has 0 trans fat then there is nothing to hold the frosting contents together and it will slide off of the cake. I found this out the hard way. Anyway great recipe! Will use over and over again.

This is the best buttercream I think I've ever had.  I did substitute half butter, half shortening, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  8 cups of powdered sugar seems like it would make the icing sickly sweet, but once you add in the whipping cream and get it whipped up nice and stiff, the icing balances really well with the sweetness of the cake. I used it to ice cupcakes for work and it iced 30 cupcakes and I still have enough leftover for at least 10 more.  This will be going in my family recipes book.

This was pretty good frosting.  My mother-in-law pointed out the fact that it didn't taste like butter and I should've used butter flavored shortening... but all in all I thought it was tasty and it got compliments from other guests.

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I used it to make my daughter a princess birthday cake.  It was great for piping and decorating.  I made a four layer cake and there was even some frosting left over.  It's probably not the healthiest frosting, but it's okay to eat once in awhile :)
Added note:  I made this again for a 9x13 sheet cake.  If you halve this recipe you'll have enough frosting.

mmm, taste-free frosting! groos, what a greasy mess. even with the alterations of extra vanilla and 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening, it was NOT the buttercream frosting i expected!had to go to the store for more sugar after this one wasted it all so i could make another recipe since i refused to serve my guests this hot mess.

I did the recipe just as it was and it was amazing. I could eat it all day. The frosting is very white so if you are not into the white white then use the regular vanilla extract to give it an off white look. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!

Totally satisfied with this recipe although I did not follow the measurements or the ingredients..Ok, so I'm really satisfied with what I came up with..  I cut the measurement down to my needs and omitted the salt and cream and used margarine instead of lard... Beautiful!

Excellent texture for decorating.  I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter which gave a light butter color so could only use for colored decorations.  Next time will use all shortening and add butter extract to use for frosting.  Definitely better than Wilton recipe ... doesn't dry out and crack.  This is my new standard buttercream!

I used half butter and half shortening.  The first time I made this I didn't whip it long enough.  The second time I let it whip for much longer and the texture was much improved.  I used a half recipe and had enough to frost a 3 layer cake (with leftovers).

I took the advice of other reviewers, and used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter. This was Awesome! It was just like the frosting in the bakery! I needed a lot, so I made a second batch just in case. The recipe makes quite a bit, and I ended up with about 1/2 batch left over...but who's complaining. I'm sure it will get eaten!

Oh My Gosh!  This is quite frankly the best frosting I've ever made.  I have a favorite standby thats a cream cheese frosting I lighten up with whipped cream.  I thought nothing could beat that, but this really does.  I only needed half so I used a stick of butter, half stick of the salted butter crisco sticks and omitted the salt.  It was light, fluffy, creamy and delicious.  I'd made other buttercreams in the past that got real firm after setting.  Not this one!  It really was awesome.  I'm so glad I found this and would encourage anyone looking for a new frosting to try it out!

This is IT for frosting!  like others I used half shortening, half butter, and it turned out fabulous.  Tip: Don't over mix, or you'll have alot of bubbles to smooth out while icing.

I am a huge fan of buttercream and this didn't do it.  I followed recomendations of using butter flavor crisco and half butter - really bad
!  I may try it with plain crisco next time.  I like buttercream recipe better

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I altered it, the texture is perfection.

For a 3 layer cake{Undecorated}I use 3/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup shortening, 4 cups pwd sugar, 1 Tbls. vanilla and 2-3 Tbls cream or half and half. I use this on Devils food and other super rich chocolate cakes, YUMMY. 

I rated this recipe because it was these proportions I used when changing to real butter as opposed to shortening, the ratio of fat to sugar is perfect and I added the bit of shortening just to make it silkier.

It's impossible to make this recipe and not lick your fingers..or the bowl.. or the beaters.  This is by far, the very best buttercream frosting ever. I consider myself to be an expert in the "taste area" of frostings. I've made it on two different occasions so far. It even appears to freeze well too.  Try it, you'll love it.
The bad part: The confectioners sugar kicks up quite a mess from the blender.

I scaled this to 18 servings and was able to generously frost 9 inch cake.  I used real vanilla extract, half unsalted butter and half butter flavored Crisco. I only used half of the ammount of salt it called for.  Anymore I thought would have been too much.  IT WAS AWESOME!  I cannot believe how much like a bakery this tasted. A+++++++++++++++++++++++

The Best! Over the past 3 weeks, I have tried 3 different frosting recipes looking for the perfect one for my daughter's first birthday. I will never buy can frosting again. Everyone at the party said the cake was great and the frosting was sooo.... good. I did use half butter and half shortening and added almond extract. Even with the butter, the frosting was pure white.

This frosting recipe is awesome!!!  I made it for my daughter's birthday cake, and I also made two shamrock cakes for my kids to take to school on St. Patrick's day!  All of the teacher's wanted to know where I bought the cakes!!  It tastes great and is very easy to decorate with.  Thanks Rick!

Depends on what you are looking for.  Easy to work with, easy for kids to spread, won't run off the sugar cookie.  But it has the taste of bakery shortening icing.  Next time I will try with butter since I really did not like the taste of this one. Not sweet enough, just very rich.

This recipe was great!  The frosting was light and creamy, and my son won a cake bake-off with it!  I also substituted 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter, and used orange extract instead of vanilla, it is a nice complement to chocolate cake!

This was easy to make and easy to work with.  I tried it on my first "professional" layered cake for a gathering and it stood up well.  We were all sampling it even before it made it on the cake.

This recipe is the BOMB BABY!  I followed the advice of others..  I used 1 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shorting.  I also added a little more salt to cut the sweetnees.  Now it was not wedding white, but I figure if you get that land o lakes white butter it may work.  I'm going to try it again.  I'm also going to try many other combo's with this.  

If you are looking for a creamy/whipped buttercream icing.  This is it.  It is nothing like Publix's, Ingles, Cubs, Sams, or Krogers (Krogers changed their recipe..theres used to be sweeter..now it is not)...whipped icing.  I'm from a place were icing is supped to be sweet or at least have a hint of sweetnees....and no grease...... THANK YOU RICK MAZZUCA... It is the best.

This frosting was outstanding!  I received many compliments on how delicous the frosting was when I prepared it for my son's birthday party!  Delicous and so much better than store-purchased!  Thanks for sharing!

This frosting is wonderful!  I was looking for a good frosting for birthday cakes and this one is perfect for my taste.  The consistency is great, very easy to use.  My hubby and five year old son even made it for my birthday cake. This is definitely the recipe I've been looking for!

I followed the recipe exactly, and am totally happy with the results! It tastes like my favorite whipped frosting from the bakery. The one unintended variation I made was to the flavoring: I ran out of vanilla and subbed almond extract for one teaspoon. It tastes great!

Had to laugh at the review that says this isn't buttercream because there's no butter. Tell me, how do YOU think butter is made?

I'm not a big fan of buttercream frosting, but I needed to use it for a cake decorating class I was taking.  For the 2 cups of shortening, I use 1 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup cream cheese.  I used the cream cheese because I ran out of vegetable shortening.  OMG!  It was soon good!  It doesn't taste like cream cheese frosting, but it cuts the sweetness down and it was far more tasty.  This small change has changed my feelings for buttercream frosting.

Oh my! This IS the best buttercream I have tried! It isn't too sweet, just right! I did alter the shortening; I used 1 cup soften butter and 1 cup shortening and used 7 TBS evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream, amazing! This will be my buttercream recipe! It piped and crust very well and enough to frost & decorate a 9" three layer cake! Thanks for sharing!!!

So like many others I read the reviews and used half butter it came out perfect and delicious. It was also very easy to work with and this is coming from someone who uses genache almost exclusively. 

However I used salted butter, for two reasons. I needed a smooth finish you should never add regular salt to buttercream as it leaves the final product somewhat grainy popcorn salt would be the way to go.  Overall this is an excellent recipe

This is a great recipe, not too sweet and very fluffy if you beat shortening and sugar several minutes (I beat mine around 5 minutes). It tastes just like from a bakery. Try this, you will enjoy it!

I've wanted a buttercream recipe for quite some time that wasn't too sweet and this is it. It's the best recipe I'e used yet. The only changes I make to it is I use half butter and half shortening which gives it a great taste. I also don't have clear vanilla extract on hand so I use the regular one (brown) and even though the frosting isn't bright white, it is still white. It makes a very large amount so I only make half the recipe and it is enough for a batch of cupcakes or a cake.  A few helpful tips. Put your butter on the counter a while before you make your frosting so it is room temp. That way you don't have chunks of butter in your frosting that won't blend in. I also put the frosting in a zip lock bag, cut off one corner and pipe onto the cupcakes.

I use this recipe for everything. LOVE IT. It holds decorations nicely. I also use it as my crumb coat, I just add regular milk to thin it down a bit. I have tried several other recipes and always come back to this one and everyone loves it.

I worked in a cafe' that specialized in cakes and everyone raved about the frosting. This is the same recipe except it needs to have 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter. That is why I rated it 4 stars, with the butter it is 5 stars plus. For chocolate just add a can of Hersherys Cocoa and 2 more oz cream. Perfect!

This tasted great but I had a problem with it being too runny & melting. I took some of the advice of other reviewers & I made half a batch and used half crisco & half butter. I'll try it with all crisco next time.

AWESOME recipe just as is!  You can also add a bit of butter flavoring and almond extract for a more bakery like taste.  Or cocoa powder to make it chocolate.  YUM YUM YUM!

I made this with a yellow cake w/lemon filling.  I read other reviews and decided to use one and a half cups butter and only a half cup of shortening.  I also used four and a half cups of confectioners sugar.  Instead of the vanilla I wanted to have a hint of raspberry flavoring so I used raspberry extract in place of the vanilla extract.  Everybody LOVED them!! They were all gone and people were asking 4 the recipe.  Thanks!

I rate this recipe 5 stars with modifications.  ile other reviewers I used a combination of butter and shortening because I find using all shortening to make frosting greasy.  I also didn't use all 8 cups of sugar - I only used about 5.  This is the best buttercream frosting not only that I've made, but have ever tasted. It is light and fluffy without being too overly sweet.  Great recipe.

It looked beautiful, but I personally did not like the flavor. Greasy tasting (created film on the roof of my mouth) and was greasy feeling when I was cleaning up (lots of soap needed).  I tried another buttercream recipe with butter and was more satisfied. Just not for me.

I have made this recipe twice, and both times it has turned out perfect! I have added the cream slowly, and I have not needed to use it all.  This frosting is very light and fluffy, tastes great, and looks beautiful.  This is the only buttercream recipe I will use from now on.

I made with 3/4 Crisco and 1/4 real butter and it's greasy. It left a film on the roof of my mouth and my tongue. I can't imagine how much worse it would be with 100% Crisco. I don't understand the rave reviews unless if they're by people that have not had truly good buttercream. I don't have time to make another frosting before our guests arrive and I'm truly embarrassed to have to serve this. 
The only positive thing I can say is that the texture is nice.

This frosting was so sweet that I had to stop putting sugar in at 5.5 cups. I would advise anyone who makes this to taste while you make it. I would also use butter instead of shortening. To me, shortening has an off taste about it but that's just my preference. Overall it turned out okay...but not what I was expecting.

I thought this was an amazing buttercream recipe, could be flavored very easily by adding extracts, I used butter extract as I just wanted a rich buttercream frosting- makes a ton of frosting though! Hale it and you will still have plenty for a large cake, or refrigerate the leftovers if you bake a lot.

great frosting rick! i'm not accustomed to using heavy cream in frostings, so this recipe intrigued me.  I did enjoy it, although i think the recipe calls for far too much sugar (instant toothache).  i'm just not sure that the heavy cream made this frosting extra special or unique, other than adding a great deal of fat to the icing.  I think there are better buttercream recipes on this site that have the sugar:butter/shortening ratio perfected, and use skim milk so as not to have as much fat.  i probably won't use this recipe again, but thanks for something different!

After reading a ton of reviews, I made this frosting using the exact recipe.  The first time I must have done something wrong because it was very airy.  The second time, due to lack of sleep, I forgot to sift the powdered sugar, it turned out fantastic.  Great consistency, flavor and texture.  Will definately use this recipe again.

I made this to frost a birthday cake. I used half butter, half shortening.  At first, the frosting tasted greasy so I added more sugar.  Thanks Rick for the good frosting.  UPDATE:  I've made this several times using equal parts butter and shortening with no problems.  It pipes well and forms a desirable crust.  Thanks Rick!

I have mixed several AllRecipes buttercream icings. They are ALL the same, which is delicious.  Tweeks here and there in the comments. They are all fat + powdered sugar + cream/milk and a bit of vanilla. But any experienced baker can taste pure lard in these recipes. Holds up well, pipes and spreads well...but they're all lardy-sweet. I happen to have mixed this one last night and just finished a breakfast cupcake. I'm not a pro baker, but this icing mounds up and spreads with a luscious swirl using a butter knife :)

Best Frosting I have ever made, Thank You.  I didn't have 2 whole cups of Crisco so I made with butter and shortening.  Very Very good and great consistency.  Remember to whip until fluffy.

This tastes absolutely amazing and  is an awesome way to build your upper arm muscles! Be prepared to whip the mix atleast half an hour to obtain the light fluffy texture perfect for topping cupcakes but the time is WELL WORTH IT!!

Made this tonight for some New Year's Eve cupcakes and it was fantastic. Halved the recipe and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening half. Also added a smidgen of almond extract to enhance the flavor. Best buttercream I've ever made!

What a wonderful recipe! I made two batches and added a little less salt the second time and it was better that way. This frosting would be good for cupcakes, cakes and even frosting cookies! Put it in your recipe box :)

Very good, but I'm only giving 4 stars since I used a lot less sugar....I cut the recipe in fourth (I needed just a little to frost some cookies) but still only used 1/4 cup sugar.

Let me preface this review by saying that I am a butter girl.  I was very skeptical of and reluctant to use shortening in a frosting recipe, but since my last butter-only frosting was a bit disappointing, I decided to just try it.  Wow!  This recipe produces an incredibly fluffy, delicious frosting that rivals that from any bakery!  I used slightly less sugar (~7 cups) and this made  enough to frost 24 cupcakes with about 3 cups left over (in the freezer until next time!).  As with another reviewer, I kept "sampling" the frosting because I couldn't believe how good it was!  And it's not as sickly sweet and overwhelming as frosting made only with butter.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!

Awesome!  The only thing I did different was use half real butter in place of half the shortening and used regular vanilla instead of clear.  Very very good flavor, thanks for sharing!

This buttercream frosting is not good as is! I did half the recipe following the recipe EXACTLY as written, and it just had no taste, no flavor. It was just bland. I ended up adding 2 TBSP total of vanilla flavoring, 2 TBSP butter flavor, and an additional 1 cup of powdered sugar. It still did not give me that bakery taste but was a lot closer and had more flavor than the original recipe. Next time i will use butter flavored shortening and try that. I did like the texture it gave me, so that's why I'll continue to work with it and tweak it for my own liking.

Awesome frosting. Easy to whip up, easy to spread, easy to pipe, and wonderful tasting. 

I scaled down to 24 servings and did 1/2 cup butter, and 5/6 cup shortening (1/2 + 1/3). 

Added some red and yellow food coloring to make orange frosting for chocolate cupcakes, topped with creepy chocolate trees for All Hallow's Eve :)

This was a very easy to make recipe, and the texture was perfect. I thought it was way too sweet though!! If i were to make it again, i would probably only put 5 cups of confectioners sugar in. On the plus side, if you need a lot of frosting, this is the recipe. Since i found it too sweet, i only put a very light layer over my cake. I think i could have frosted two cakes fully with it.

I just iced my second wedding cake using this recipe.  The only change I made was adding half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was perfect and enough to ice a 16x16 inch square cake without decorations.

This is the absolute best recipe ever! I was looking for a buttercream frosting recipe for my son's birthday cake because I had an edible cake frosting sheet and it stated that they work best with buttercream frosting, I never expected for it to come out so good, not only is it delicious, but extremely easy to work with.  I will never buy frosting from a can again and I will never use another frosting recipe, this is the best, I can't say enough about it, Thank you for posting this

I made this recipe to go with my champagne cupcakes. Using other reviews, I cut back the amount of confectioners sugar. I believe I only used about 4 1/2 cups and that suited my taste just well. I made 12 cupcakes and an 8x8 cake so there was plenty of icing to freeze. I can't wait to break it out in a while and try it on some different cupcakes.

This frosting was excellent! Just the perfect consistency and exactly the bakery buttercream flavor I was looking for. I used lemon juice instead of the cream for a triple lemon cake (homemade lemon cake, lemon curd and lemon buttercream wedding cake.) it got many compliments!

Did it according to recipe but only made enough for 24 servings which was still more than enough for the cake I made. The icing was delicious and fluffy and there where only two pieces of cake left at the end of the day.

Too greasy.  I will find a frosting that does not call for shortening next time.  It does frost and freeze well though.

So rich and creamy and was a breeze to make!  I used it with David's Yellow Cake and turned out fantastic!  I dyed it different colors and made it into our Easter cake.

I have used this a few times now, I love it because it's not too sweet, and it has a great consistency... easy to adjust to your needs as well, add a little this or that or tweak it however.. its a keeper

I had to make this a couple of times for it to turn out right. The first time I used butter flavored shortening and that was a mistake. Icing had great consistency but tasted like a glob of butter. The second time I used regular shortening. The end result was great consistency but hardly any flavor. I ended up adding almond extract and a little milk in the end and it was great!

I halved this recipe and used 3/4 cup shortening, 1/4 cup butter because of what people had recommended and the amount of shortening I had left, and it didn't come out!  I don't think it was just me because I otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and I'm usually a pretty decent baker... I tried adding more cream and milk at the end, but it was already just too sickeningly sweet / cardboardy tasting... I think there was way too much confectioners sugar.  It ended up being the worst icing I've ever made.   I would definitely not recommend it, unfortunately.

This was my first attempt at buttercream frosting. I followed some other ratings and used half butter, half shortening and I made a 1/2 recipe as well. For fun I chopped some strawberries and added them to some of the frosting for a filling, it sepreated a little (which I expected) but tasted great. I am thinking next time I might add some cream cheese to cut the fat a little.

This is a great basic buttercream recipe I use it as my standard go to for icing. I am experimenting right now off a picture I recently saw of a blueberry pancake cupcake with mapl/bacon buttercream. Breakfast in a cupcake so as soon as I have it perfected I will come post it.

I made this frosting for a carrot cake and made the mistake of substituting 4 cups of splenda for 4 cups of confectioners' sugar to try to cut back on the sugar. Don't ever do that people.  The icing still managed to be fantastic, but not as smooth.  I made it again to the letter and it was marvelous; smooth, sweet and easy to work with.

A marvelous buttercream very like the kind the Nantucket bakery uses on my brother's favorite birthday cake. I love that it doesn't require any fancy steps like boiling water, perking coffee, or waiting 6 hours for it to beat. It's a little lighter than store bought. Made plenty to frost my cake with three cups left over. This will be my buttercream from now on.

I love this recipe. I did change a few things but the texture and flavoring of this frosting is much better than others I've tried. I substituted half the shortening for half (salted) butter and also added 1 tsp of butter flavor extract with 1/4 tsp of salt. I also added 1 tsp of meringue powder. It has just the right amount of sweetness to it without being sickening sweet! Thanks so much!

Didn't make this as written so I won't give it 5 stars...I made it with half butter and half shortening, and it turned out fabulous!  Not at all greasy and nice and fluffy.  Perfect.

I just made this again using all butter and it turned out even better, if that is possible.  I love this recipe.

I made this last night with the shortening and it was whey too greasy and it tasted awful. I read the reviews and substituted 1 and 1/2 cups of shortening for butter and only used 1/2 cup shortening. I added 1/2 tablespoon of real vanilla extract and it was much better. I am still on the search for that healthier no grease or butter buttercream frosting recipe.  Overall it piped well and decorated my cupcakes good, just don't keep it in your hands too long bc it begins to soften.

The end result of this recipe tasted like a tub of shortening.  I followed the recipes exactly as is, but will not be using it again.  The only reason I gave it two stars, versus one star is because the frosting was stiff enough to pipe onto my cupcakes without losing form or melting (e.g. a pure butter frosting).  Otherwise, this was a fail.

OMGI am not much of a baker but I used this recipe because of the reviews. It was so easy to make and use. Read the comment about using half butter so instead I used half Butter Crisco. I had so many people at my little girls party ask for recipe.

This was a perfect frosting. I am not a big fan of frosting but this was extremely good and I got alot of compliments. I followed the recomendations of doing half unsalted butter and shortening.

This is a perfect decorating icing. I used butter flavored Crisco which I thought would make it taste even better but I have to say I think it would've been better using the plain, I subbed 1/2 c of shortening fo butter & I think the fake Crisco butter taste was just too much.  I used it to ice my son's birthday cake (oreo ice cream cake from this site which I doubled) & I still had a sandwich container of icing left over.

I was so excited to try this out when i saw the rave reviews but this recipe just didn't work out for me, i don't know if this had something to do with the weather here since it is really hot here,but the texture wasn't nice!it just tasted like powdered sugar, i even put more than the required amount of vanilla but still tasted like powdered sugar!i guess i will just stick with the swiss or italian buttercream

This was an ok basic recipe for frosting, but the shortening made it a funny texture and left a waxy feeling in my mouth! Maybe it's just personal preference, but next time I will use butter! If you needed to pipe the frosting, this would certainly be firm enough for that.

Great recipe!  It tasted just like my favorite bakery. I used this to fill and frost two nine inch rounds adn I thought this might be a little too much for what I needed so I decided to cut the recipe in half. As it turns out, half was perfect!  We are a frosting loving family and I was able to be pretty generous.  Also, I could not find clear vanilla extract so I used the darker color that I had and it was still stark white.  I will absolutely use this recipe over and over.  Thanks for sharing!

I like it better than others I've tried, I still don't care much for frosting but this one isn't bad and I used it to make a Barbie Wilton cake. :) (Oh 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening with no other changes).

very good.  My consistancy was a little off but it may be because it was so hot in my house that day.

This was really good.  It was smooth and yummy.  I added some strong instant coffee, creating a coffee flavored frosting for the Black Magic Cake recipe.  It was really good.  Will definitely use again.

This was very tastey.  It wasn't too sweet like some frosting recipes.  The only problem I had was that it was not stiff enough to decorate with.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of cream.  I also used butter instead of shortening because I prefer butter.  I will try it again, very good!

I just made a half batch for 2 dozen cupcakes and it was just enough for all of them.  I thought it was really easy and I put it in a pastry bag and it was the right consistency.  Perfect - will definitely use the recipe again.

by far the best buttercream recipe I've ever used. I did replace 1/2 of the shortening with butter, and it was absolutely wonderful.  It held together well for decorating, and wasn't super greasy.

This frosting will make you just go "yummm"! I made with half butter and half shortening for a cake, which was awesome, and 1-1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter for filled cupcakes with strawberry filling, where I did not want such a buttery taste and they came out tasting like zingers! I prefer less vanilla though, and will decrease it some next time. Definitely a keeper!

This is my 'go to' frosting from now on. I did make some changes, based on other site reviews: 2 sticks margarine & 2 sticks butter, only 4 cups Confectioner's sugar, no salt, & 5 oz. heavy cream. My family loved it. It's creamy, not too sweet, and buttery goodness. We couldn't stop licking our fingers. The Sweet 16 Topsy Turvy Cake was a big success.

Wonderful! I used 1 1/2 cups of shortening and 1 stick of unsalted butter. Wasn't too sweet. I also used a long tip and filled my cupcakes with the frosting then tinted the rest of the frosting hot pink with color gel and piped it on cupcakes. Too cute!

The best frosting I have made thus far! I only used 4.5 cups of confectioner's sugar and it was perfect. The whipping cream makes all the difference :)

This recipe is the only icing recipe I'll be using from now on.  My husband who only likes store bought icing loved this recipe as did my brother-in-law who only likes homemade icing.  So, it's definitely a crowd pleaser!  I used both shortening and butter.

GREAT - best ever icing!!!  I used expired whipping cream, but did the taste, look, and smell test and it appeared alright so I went ahead and used it anyways. I have had awful luck with frosting in the past but this was so great! thank you Rick!

Easy to make and use.  Came out very good.  I didn't have clear imitation vanilla extract so I used what I had which was pure vanilla extract.  The frosting still came out nice and white.

This was my first time to ever make buttercream frosting (we generally make cream cheese for cupcakes) and I am so pleased with how this recipe came out (as were my husband and son - it's their new favorite).  I followed the advice of many reviewers and used 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter and it was perfect.  I also did not have any clear vanilla on hand...but pure vanilla didn't seem to change the color - it was beautiful!  Thanks so much for the recipe - it is definitely a keeper :o)

This is the TRUE BAKERY FROSTING recipe I've been looking for. I've made several other recipes on here that claim they are "bakery or grocery store" frosting, but, quite frankly, did not taste good. I made this recipe exactly, I did not try to halve it, or adjust ingredients. I love the consistency, but most of all, TASTES GREAT, even the next day!

Good consistency but tasted too much like lard for me.  I'm not a big fan of frosting in general, so it's probably just my personal taste.

This frosting was good but had a strong shortening taste.  After adding a bit of butter it was delicious.

Although this was my first attempt at making buttercream decorations, I followed the advice of previous comments and replaced the 2 cups shortening with 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I have to say, it kept its shape really well, even during its few hours outside of the fridge! It's delicious as well and I can't imagine what it would have been like without butter in it.

This was super easy to make!!!  The only changes I made was; 1 cup Crisco and 1 cup butter as suggested by others rating this recipe.  I did not add any additional salt due to the butter already being salted.

The best buttercream ever!!  I made it with all shortening, 1tsp of vanilla because I ran out and 1 tsp of Wilton's butter flavor.  It was for my son's 3rd birthday cake.  I iced the whole 9x13 cake, did top and bottom border and printed and still had left over icing.  I will try next time with half butter and half shortening just to see if it can get any better.  The cake was almost gone and I am going to have to get a bigger pan and make more next time.  This blow's Wilton's buttercream icing out of the water.  I did refrigerate my iced cake since the icing had heavy cream in it. Thanks!!!!! Awesome and I am recommending to a friend for her kids birthday cake!

Love it! I did 1c. Butter and 1c. Shortening and it was perfect for piping...it was the first time I made homemade frosting and this one is a keeper! I love the use of cream instead of milk! (I actually bought whipping cream by accident but worked great!) I also added the full amount of sugar if not more and I did not find it overly sweet at all. Thank you for the great recipe Rick!

I agree that this is a bakery replica.  I did do half butter and half shortening.  Because both of my boys birthdays are in January I have made this twice this month.  I really don't like having any left over because it is just too good on a spoon.  Not so good for the Weight Watchers....

If I could give this more stars, I would!  This is super simple and easily one of the best buttercream frosting recipes I have ever tried.  I used half butter, half shortening and the end result is a "to die for" taste!

LOVE this recipe! I was worried when everyone said it was exactly like bakery icing because lots of bakery icings are way too sweet for my taste. But think BAKERY bakery, not GROCERY STORE bakery. I halved the recipe to make enough for one batch of cupcakes, but only had to use 2 oz of cream. I didn't have quite one cup of shortening so I topped it off about 1/4 cup butter and it was excellent. Hard to believe buttercream icing could be this tasty without hardly any butter. I will use this from now on!

Variations that I chose between that work just as well: 1 cup shortening + 1 cup butter, 2 cups butter, 1 tsp almond + 1 tsp vanilla, 6fl oz milk/water

This is a wonderful recipe!  I use if for everything now.  I did cut the 2 cups shortening to 1 cup butter, 1 cup shortening and this works great.  I have found that it works better if it is refridgerated for a bit before frosting things, firms it up a bit.

This is by far the best buttercream frosting I have found! I have made it exactly as written which was very good and I have made it with a change of the recipe to fit my family's preferences. The change I made is to use 1 cup of shortening and 1 cup of butter. I feel so bad for the people who buy that yucky frosting out of a can from the grocery store. If only they knew about this recipe...

I used all butter and only 5 cups of powdered sugar - insanely delicious.  I'm sure it would be great with the full 8 cups of sugar too!

Only change I made was to use butter flavored shortening.  Absolutely fabulous frosting.  Just like the bakery and easy to make.  A half batch even gave me left overs when frosting cupcakes.  Just wondering about how long it can sit out with the whipping cream in it?

Excellent recipe. I didnt change any of the ingredients, however, I did mix it on high for quite a while to get that lighter consistency.  Was perfect.  Will use again.

Didn't have enough shortening so i used butter for half and it turned out great. You can make it really light and fluffy by whipping it on high for a long time, it made it less sweet that way and was perfect on chocolate cupcakes!

This has to be the best buttercream recipe I have ever tried, and I've  tried a lot of different recipes.  The texture of this frosting is great for decorating and frosting cakes.  My only recommendation would be to replace one cup of shortening with one cup of butter.  It tastes just as good as the buttercreams in the bakery!!

This frosting was easy to make and delicious. It piped very well. It was very versatile, easily thinned out with more cream or stiffened up with a little extra powder sugar.  I started with a little less cream which worked well for the border. Um Yummy.

People, this is an awesome recipe.  I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 regular crisco.  I made three variations for a luau.  I added lemon zest and a tbsp of lemon juice, key lime zest and key lime juice, and coconut extract. Additionally some cupcakes were iced in vanilla.  All four flavors got great reviews from my guests.  This is my go-to frosting for evermore.  Love it!

This was the first time I EVER made homemade icing and it was wonderful! I did what other reviewers suggested and used 1/2 butter 1/2 crisco and 5 cups powder sugar and 4ozs heavy cream.  My hubby who loves sweets said it wasn't sweet enough for him but everyone else loved it. I'm not a huge sweets person so 5 cups was enough sweetness for me. It makes a TON of frosting I did 12 cupcakes and a cake w/ frosting left over. This is a keeper THANKS RICK!!!!

Woohooo! This is definitely the definitive buttercream icing. Texture is perfect and the taste is exactly what I have been looking for. I used half butter and half Crisco. I had no heavy cream, so I used half and half. This will be THE icing recipe I use from now on. Thank you, thank you!!!

This is a great recipe. Easy and delicious. I rated only 4 stars because I think it calls for way too much powdered sugar. 8 cups is about 4 pounds. I used 1 whole 2 pound bag and it was probably still too much. Plus it makes a ton of frosting. If your only planning on doing a single cake and not changing colors to do decorating and stuff, then you could easily half this recipe and still have plenty for one or maybe even two cakes from a box. I used butter falvored shortening and substituted half of it with real butter. Make sure you cream it well before you start adding the sugar. If your using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment until after the cream is thouroughly mixed in then switch to your whisk to finish beating. And don't get discouraged if it gets really heavy like a cookie dough consitency. When you start adding the liquid it will loosen up and whip very well.

Here are just a few things I did differently . . . 1. I cut the recipe in half and it frosted 24 cupcakes (generously) and had about 1 cup left-over. 2. Used a hand-mixer - if you do this, make sure to add extra beating time. 3. Added one cup of powdered sugar at a time, beating until smooth after each one. 4. I added the liquids in with the last cup of powdered sugar and beat the heck out of it! 5. Make sure you have extra vanilla and powdered sugar on-hand in case you want it a bit sweeter. I ended up adding more of both.

I had been looking for a good buttercream recipe for some time and stumbled across this GREAT recipe! I did modify it quite a bit after reading other reviews but mostly because I did not have enough of some of the ingredients (conf sugar and heavy cream)-I also wanted it to be chocolate buttercream. Here is my modified recipe: 1 1/2cp shortening, 1/2cp room temp butter, 5 1/2 to 6cps conf sugar, 2oz whipping cream, 1oz milk, 1/2tsp salt, 1tsp vanilla extract, 3teaspoons cocoa powder.  I used my whipping attachment on my stand mixer. The results were a very fluffy, not to sweet, mildly chocolate buttercream. It made enough to heavily fill and frost a 2 layer chocolate cake with about 2 cups left over! I can't imagine using all 8 cups of conf sugar in the recipe, you'd have enough to frost 2 cakes. I had never made frosting using shortening but this recipe suprised me by not being "greasy" at all. This is by far the best frosting I have ever made!!!

AMAZING! Exactly what I was looking for. I substituted butter and omitted salt because I used a salted butter. Otherwise followed proportions exactly. Very rich and perfect consistency. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My daughter made this frosting for cupcakes on my birthday, and I must say I was really impressed. And I was a prof. cake dec. for 24 years. This was good icing.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because it beats up nice and fluffy; plus, it is easy to spread.  However, this is the greasiest frosting I have ever eaten.  I even substituted part butter for some of the shortening, but it was still way too greasy.  If I were to make this again I would use  1 c. butter in place of 1 c. of the shortening and reduce the amount of whipping cream as well. (replacing what is reduced with either milk or water)  I frosted a dark chocolate cake with this so we were able to eat it, we simply used a fraction of what it actually made, on the cake.

subbed milk for cream and it was still tasted good and worked well for decorating! hint-add liquid gradually to achieve desired consistancy.

I just made this and am not fond of the shortening in it - I can definitely taste it and it is a bit 'greasy' to me. I do use recipes for frosting with shortening in it but it is usually boiled, maybe that makes a big difference in the crisco flavoring. But it looks nice and spreads well. I am going to make an all butter one for the cake I just made and put this in the fridge for something else instead.

I've used this one a couple of times - butter flavored Crisco gives it an excellent "buttercream" flavor, so as long as you're not looking for pure white frosting, I think that's the way to go.  Easy to work with and pipes nicely!

This is the best frosting!!  I followed other reviews suggestion to use 1 part butter (1 stick) and 3 parts shortening.  It whipped up fluffy and light, and spread like a dream!  It worked well in a decorating bag.  Hubby liked it because it was creamy but not too sweet. This is my new frosting recipe!

I liked the consistency for this frosting, however, I did not like the after taste the cream had. After sitting for a while the flavors of the sugar, vanilla, and cream blended so it was good. I don't think I'll use cream again...I'll use whole milk instead.

This is the first layer cake I've frosted. I followed what some people said and used half butter (unsalted) and half shortening.  I also halved the recipe, but I should have made the whole thing.  I made 2 9" round cakes to layer, and had "barely" enough to do the middle, sides, and top.  

The frosting is really good. My husband is picky about frosting being "too sweet" and he liked it.  He is spoiled and picky, so that says something!

I liked that I didn't have to cook the frosting, to get a buttercream frosting.

Sooooooooooo good. I made this for my sisters wedding cake. I had a ton of icing left over and it was a 3 tier cake! The only modifications I made were 1.5 cups shortening and 1/2 cup salted butter and omitted the salt. It really is the best frosting I have ever tasted. I took some of the leftovers into work and everyone raved how good the icing was. I even shared the recipe with a girl who is making cupcakes for her friends baby shower. :)

It was my friend's birthday at work and I forgot to order her cake, and a box cake is boring, UNLESS you top it with a fabulous, homemade buttercream frosting!  This was fabulous.  I can't imagine what it would have tasted like if I had used all shortening...I used 1 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening and it still had a little strange after taste.  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla and about 6 C powder sugar.  I also used some food coloring to make it almond color.  Topped a boxed triple chocoalate cake mix- made two rounds and layered it.  It was to die for.  Thanks!!

This made a lot of frosting! It was delicious and was a perfect frosting for decorating. It was extremely easy to make as well. I also used 1/2 cup butter to 1 1/2 cups butter crisco. It was fabulous.

I am so happy with how this frosting turned out. So light and perfect. I to followed others advice and did half crisco and half butter. I also halfed the ingredients and still had some left over! I frosted chocolate cupcakes so I added cocoa powder to the recipe. Turned out delicious! So simple and easy. I'm definitely going to be using this recipe all the time.

I have been decorating cakes for awhile now and I turn to this recipe again and again.  Works wonderfully.  Decorates like a bakery icing without the high ratio shortning.  I always get compliments on any cake or cupcake I use this icing with.  BRAVO!

Wonderful! I use butter flavor crisco and I usually add unsweetened cocoa powder to make choc frosting and it helps eliminate a little of the sugary taste, so it isnt so overpowering. Don't understand why some people areg etting a greasy taste to this. There was NO greasy taste since i used butter flavored crisco.........best frosting recipe I have ever used. Everyone raves and asks me for the recipe!

This is an excellent frosting made with modifications!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup unsalted butter, 1 cup shortening, and 5 cups sifted powder sugar, 2 tsp. clear vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt and added the heavy cream until it got to the appropriate consistency when whipping it.  Awesome stuff!  Highly recommend.  THis is the BEST!

I used this on my sister's wedding cake and it was perfect. There was not ONE slice of wedding cake left from a 3 tier cake, and none got thrown out. For those who complain of the Crisco,look for a recipe using butter. This is BAKERY type frosting and shortening is what bakery frosting is made from. YOu can order a special shortening called Sweetex online and use it in place of Crisco in this recipe. This frosting is NEVER greasy when I make it and I make LOTS of cakes, by request. Thanks Rick for making my cakes taste SO great!

Slightly altered, it makes a good buttercream frosting. I've used this exact recipe for the last 3 years and every time I make it, my family fights over who gets to eat what's left in the bowl.  I've altered the directions myself as the suggested 2 cups of shortening will create a super lardy tasting/textured frosting requiring a lot of extra powdered sugar to straighten out.  I start with a very scant cup of Crisco and  about 1/4th cup of Brummel and brown. The Brummel and Brown gives the frosting a nice buttery taste. If you prefer to use Crisco, I suggest you use a scant cup to start and then spoon in a little at a time, stopping  to check taste and texture. I also do not use salt as the Brummel and Brown provides just the right amount.   The rest of the directions I pretty much follow except I also use real vanilla like others here suggest. If you want a good vanilla flavor, use the real thing because imitation vanilla tastes like imitation vanilla. All in all - good recipe.

It tastes just like bakery frosting, though I'm not totally fond of the slight shortening aftertaste.  I like the Wilton recipe better; 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.

Oh, my goodness! The frosting is AMAZING!!!!!!!! It's that bakery type frosting that the pro's use! 
I NEVER bake okay, and I've been really wanting to bake a cake/frosting from scratch. So there is a birthday coming up and I decided to make a "test cake" before the real deal. I paired this with "Pound Cake III"
It was funny sorta while making this, although it's a very easy recipe I guess b/c I'm not used to making things from scratch I was not very prepared in the sizes of my bowls. This recipe makes a HUGE batch! I ended up with one huge mixing bowl, and 3 med. size bowls FULL of frosting! hahaha 
I made one of the bowls chocolate with some cocoa powder (yummy!) Half way through mixing the original batch, I had to stop and pull out more bowls, and transfer half. It was all well worth it in the end. I learned some things about baking from scratch, and i learned that I might need to upgrade from a hand mixer! I've stored the left over in a tight container, and have since made cupcakes with some of it. It held up great. Oh, yeah I had enough frosting to frost and decorate a cake (Wilton Wonder Mold), make those cupcakes, and still have a bowl left.
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This is the best decorator frosting I've ever had.  It stays soft and creamy even after being refridgerated.  I does melt kind of fast so you have to stop occasionally to rechill your bag but the end result is worth it.

This is a fabulous recipe. It is not too sweet or heavy. I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and only 5 cups of icing sugar. The consistency is excellent and very delicious. I will be throwing away my old recipe and replacing it with this one.

I made this recipe twice before writing the review: once with regular shortening (actually half butter, half shortening), and once with butter-flavored Crisco. The butter flavor version was much tastier, but if color matters, it's not white. This is a very good recipe either way, and stays creamy (no hard "shell") over time. Thanks, this is in my permanent file.

Pretty good.  I'm very hard to please when it comes to frosting.  Good recipe.  I even made it a peanut butter frosting by melting chips and adding.

This was a good recipe.  It was very simple to make, and tasty.  The only change I would make the next time would be to use half butter, half shortening, as other reviewers suggested.

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE FOR BUTTERCREAM FROSTING THAT I HAVE EVER MADE.  I LEFT EVERYTHING AS IS, EXCEPT IN PUT ORANGE OIL INSTEAD OF VANILLA EXTRACT.  IT WAS GREAT.

I was looking for a great buttercream recipe for my husband's birthday, and I think I found it!  I followed the other suggestions and used 1 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C. shortening.  But, I did add more vanilla extract.  My only problem with this frosting was that it got gooey and warm really quickly. (and my kitchen was quite cool)  If you are using it to frost and decorate the cake, I suggest you put the frosted cake in the fridge while you are preparing the icing for decoration, i.e. tinting and placing in pastry bags.  I didn't keep the cake in the fridge and the icing practically melted off the cake as I served it. Otherwise, it was a wonderful recipe!

I thought this was tasty, but kind of oily tasting. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't like a buttery frosting, but I won't use it again, its just not my thing.  It decorated well. Thanks!

I made this icing for my son's 2nd birthday.  I received lots of compliments, including older seasoned cooks asking me how I made it so well and others commenting on its superiority to store bakery's icing.  BUT ONLY USE ABOUT 5 CUPS OF SUGAR!  That was perfect.

This frosting recipe (made with 50/50 mix of butter/crisco) combined with the white almond wedding  cake recipe from this site (almond omitted in favor of vanilla) is hands down the best cake I have ever made, and probably  ever tasted.  I put strawberry or raspberry jam between the layers, and people go crazy for it.  I've been asked for the recipe countless times.  A dense, rich cake and perfect icing.

I think I love it so much as it reminds me of my own wedding cake, and brings back great memories.  Don't skimp on the heavy cream...it gives the frosting a wonderful taste and light texture.

I used half shortening & half butter as I read in many reviews - awesome!  Make it & I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!  Full disclosure....I had some of the extra frosting in the  fridge....one of my son’s came by for a visit  & took it out, thinkin’ mmmm, mashed potatoes to go with dinner...    Well...noooo - but when I told him what it was he chunked off a piece (because it hardened up) & said it tasted like a fudge-like candy!

This is the ONLY buttercream recipe that I use now! It turns out perfect every single time, and the consistency is perfect for piping & decorating. I’ve seen some reviews complain about it still having a “shortening” flavor, and I remedy that by using butter-flavored shortening and an extra tablespoon of clear vanilla. I make a lot of cakes & cupcakes for people, and they LOOOOVE the flavor of this frosting—they say it’s even better than Publix! ??

If I could only use one word to describe this frosting it would be GREASY. I'm not really sure how it got so many good reviews, the frosting just isn't good. Well I guess I do know how... 99% of the reviewers tweaked and most completely changed the recipe and then rated it 4 or 5 stars. I really hate when people do that. If a recipe is not 5 stars without tweaking than it isn't a 5 star recipe. Plain and simple

I have been searching for the perfect "buttercream" frosting for a long time.  Most are too sweet for my taste, and I live in a hot humid climate that must be considered, too.  All the reviews are AWESOME and so much help!!!  I decided to substitute part of the shortening with salted butter.  I used 1 1/2 c. shortening and 1/2 c. salted butter.  I also started with about 5 c. of confectioners sugar.  I did add a bit more through the whipping process to get the right consistency, and it still wasn't too sweet.  One note I  made - if I had added the whole amount of heavy whipping cream it would have made the frosting much too thin.  I added about 3 oz., a little at a time.  This resulted in a beautiful white, light, fluffy, not too sweet frosting that held up on a hot humid day in Florida!  People raved over my beautifully frosted cupcakes, and even I was pleased with the taste.  This from a girl who really only likes the Publix whipped frosting!  Try this one.  It's my new go-to frosting recipe.

Edited to add:  If I had halved this recipe, it still would have frosted 24 cupcakes with some left over.  This makes a LOT of frosting!  I did freeze some, and it froze well, defrosted well, and tasted just as great  later.

I just made this for the first time and it is truly the BEST tasting and easiest recipe for Buttercream I've ever made.. You won't be disappointed. That said, I did replace 1 cup of the shortening with butter so it had the creamy buttery taste we've all grown to love. Enjoy!, and thanks for sharing.

I’ve made this a couple times now, and this is excellent! I like the combo of half butter, half shortening. I also like to make my frosting chocolate by adding about 2/3 cup of cocoa, then adjusting the milk as needed.

Best I have ever made, very easy. I mess frosting up constantly , this came out great. I cringed when my son said he wanted homemade, I HATE baking, hate cake making. Even was going to go against his wishes and order one, but the woman that answered the phone was not helpful or friendly at all so I said ya know what forget it lady I will make it myself and thats that, will use again for sure if  I am ever forced to make another cake.

Great recipe, very forgiving for this momma who's never decorated a cake before!  I added 1/2 cup butter and 2 more cups of powdered sugar to this recipe.  It was a lot of frosting, but I was making a 2-tiered 8" cake and 24 cupcakes.  When decorating make sure frosting stays chilled, it's easier to work with...my hands kept warming up the piping bag.

I used 1 cup of crisco,  3 cups of sugar, 2 tbs of cocoa powder, 1/4 cup almond milk, 1 tsp vanilla to make a vegan light and less sweet vegan version.
I'm yet to try the recipe as is.

I tried to follow the other reviewers recommendation and follow the recipe exactly. My blender wasn't big enough to use 8 cups of sugar so I only used 4. Even though I cut the ingredients in half, it still made enough frosting for two cakes and I still threw some away. Taste was great though. Not too sweet and consistency was perfect for spreading. I will definitely use this recipe again.

great recipe i added imitation rum flavoring to it and a few more tablespoons of powdered sugar to balance out the texture and keep the frosting stiff. tho next time i think i will try substituting some real unsalted butter for some of the shorting to give it a smoother flavor!

The consistency of the frosting was good, but it tasted really salty to me. Next time I would leave out the salt and see how it turns out.

I used 1 1/2 cups butter shortening and 1/2 cup butter in addition to only 6 cups confectioners sugar.  Eating the frosting on its own I thought, meh but when it was on a cake, WOW!  It had just enough sweetness because the cake was sweet too.  I will be playing with this frosting with different flavors.  This recipe frosted a cake and 24 cupcakes and I still had some left over.  I will never buy store frosting again!

Made this for Christmas yesterday due to the 900 mostly good reviews. I like sweet but thinking this might be too sweet reduced sugar by 1/3 and it still was similar to eating a spoonful of sugar. Had to adjust recipe.

Absolutely the best!!  Consistent each time. I do add two sticks of softened butter & half of the listed shortening.  Versatile too.  Have used is as a base for Pineapple, Lemon, Chocolate, Hazelnut and more.  A keeper for sure!

I am dissapointed, considering the amount of ratings and good reviews this recipe has. I have noticed that buttercream that contain all Crisco or half Crisco and half butter will for sure have that Crisco Flavor and that greasy feel in your mouth once you taste it. So, like many other reviewers, I used 1 1/2 C unsalted butter + 1/2 C Crisco instead. This buttercream turned out TOO soft and TOO sweet. The buttercream looked good albeit sweet BEFORE the whipping cream but I thought I should follow through with the recipe. I added 1 oz of whipping cream and it became soft. Definitely not the recommended consistency if you're wanting to pipe with this buttercream.

I'd use less sugar (2-3 C less), and 1 TBSP of whipping cream, if not any at all.

Excellent! I made this for my daughter's bday cake. Used 1-1/2 c butter flavored crisco & 1/2 c butter. Tinted to a beautiful shade of blue! Guests raved about how light and delicious it was! Had enough icing for a small three layer cake and at least that much left over. I froze the leftover for future use. Thanks!!

This is the first homemade buttercream recipe that I tried that turned out perfectly the first time.  I have used it on probably 50 projects throughout the past year and I could not ask for a better result each and every time.   Some days I have tweak the sugar/liquid ratio depending on the temperature in my house that day but it still works like a charm!

Used 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter. Texture was stiff enough for rosettes on top of cake, but not so great for the sides. Taste was delicious!

WOW!!! This is THE best frosting I've ever made! My entire family loved it. You can totally use this recipe to decorate cakes.. you can play with the thickness by adding just a teaspoon more cream or vis-a-versa with the confectioners' sugar. I used this recipe to decorate both my daughters birthday cakes (used fondant on it, as well), and also created 16 cupcakes with it. I'm printing this one for my book so I can hand it down to my kids someday. :)  A+++

This is definitely the perfect recipe for consistency. I didn't have any regular shortening but did have the butter flavored shortening.  I thought it was a bit too rich but my family loved it!

Really good start...I have searched and experimented for a recipe that isn't sickeningly sweet, but will hold its shape for frosting cupcakes--even in warm weather for outdoor birthday parties. I used this recipe as a base, substituting 1 c. of the shortening with butter, and creamed them together until very light and fluffy before adding sugar. I cut back considerably on the powdered sugar (I probably used around 5 cups total), adding about a cup at a time until the texture was a bit thicker than I wanted it to end up, then added the salt & liquid ingredients (I also just eyeballed the cream, adding until the consistency was good). Even then, it was almost painfully sweet and a bit powdery. So I creamed 1 pkg. cream cheese in a small bowl until it was light, and mixed it into the frosting. The end result was sweet with just a hint of tanginess. The texture was perfect, and held up in 85F temps for a birthday party at the park.

Followed the recipe somewhat, but only used a 2 lb bag of powdered sugar and 1.5 cups unsalted butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. Tasted pretty good, somewhat greasy but I think everyone will like it.

Only made 1/2 recipe. Used 1/2 Crisco and 1/2 Land-o-Lakes margarine. Came out just as described. As for the comment on If it doesn't have butter, it's not buttercream. I believe if you whip cream long enough it becomes butter, so technically it can be called a buttercream recipe. Definitely the recipe I was looking for.

This was my first attempt at buttercream icing so I made this last night to icing two dozen cupcakes (Strawberry Cake from this site) and the Chocolate Cake II from this site.  To be honest I was skeptical in regards to using shortening as I thought the taste would be off but I was pleasantly surprised.  My son does not like cream cheese icing so I decided to give this one a whirl and he loved it!
Other than halve the ingredients (as I read all the reviews that said it makes tons) I did not change a thing and it was an easy recipe, great for piping, and great tasting.  I will be making this one again and I think I may take some reviewers suggestions and use half butter/half shortening to see how it changes the flavour.

Made this for my 1st attempt with piping & it was very easy to work with. Only change I would consider is using different flavored extracts according to what your topping.

This recipe is SO easy to make and it tastes absolutely delicious. I made it exactly like the recipe stated and I think it is amazing. I noticed that some people swapped out some of the shortening for butter, I'm not sure how it tastes like that but I can tell you that this recipe is amazing without any alterations!

Here's what's awesome about this recipe....it's not fussy! You can make it exactly as written and it's wonderful, but you can also tweak it to be just what you want it to be. I have made it as written. I have also made it with half butter half shortening, and with a variety of different flavor extracts. It turns out amazing every time! My one word of advice...if you are serious about decorating, cut down a bit on the cream to keep the icing a bit more stiff. This is one for your recipe book...an easy delicious go to for all your icing needs!

I'm taking a decorating class at a bakery where we learned using the creamy smooth frosting that the bakery makes everyday. This frosting has the same smooth texture as the bakery's frosting. Now I know how to make it myself. It tastes pretty good too. I decorated a cake in class today using this recipe. My frosting had the best texture for cake decorating in the whole class, thanks to this recipe. This is my new favorite!

The texture was great.  I should've read other people's reviews before making it; I assumed it was a great recipe.  It tasted like mildly-sweetened shortening.  Next time, I'll use half butter and half shortening, and see if it'll taste better

Fabulous!!! We switched out the shortening for butter, simply for personal taste preferences, but followed all measurements to a tee! Love this. Family favorite from now on!! We beat our butter for 10 mins, then beat the sugar & butter for another 15, then the sugar, butter, cream, etc for another 5.

I needed an eggnog flavored frosting, so I used this basic recipe substituting the heavy cream with eggnog.  It worked perfectly!  I did have quite a lot of frosting...enough to frost 2 two-layer cakes with a little left over.  This frosting is rather sweet, but if you are not havey handed with the fristing and your cake isn't too sweet it works well.

There are a million recipes for buttercream...well not a million :)  I was attracted to this recipe because of the use of real cream.  I did however, use butter for 1/2 of the shortening.  The shortening gives a fluffy white texture (stuff inside a Hostess cake) but lets face it, shortening is not a real food.  It is a manufactured processed item that survives on the shelf forever.  Next time I make it I will try all butter and cream (hey!  thats what is in the name!) and see how it holds up.

terrific, but I added two sticks of butter, more conf. sugar, and vanilla, and a bit more cream to make more frosting and give it a more buttery flavor, a more home made flavor, but the texture was CREAMY not gritty like usual, and i really liked it.

Fantastic buttercream recipe, turned out tasting just like my favourite bakery's cakes. I added in an extra tsp of Vanilla for a little more flavouring.

Great frosting! I made some minor modifications:  
1. used butter flavored shortening
2. used almond milk instead of heavy cream.
I just let my mixer go for a while with the shortening, then after the powdered sugar, and then again after the other ingredients. It spread great, and the whole family thought it was the greatest frosting ever!

My family and I think this is the perfect recipe for buttercream frosting. I've been trying several different recipes for our favorite white cake and buttercream frosting and I think this one is it. I made the recipe exactly as is and I wouldn't change anything!

Made this tonight using 1 cup of salted butter and 1 cup of shortening. Everything else I left the same. My husband FINALLY liked a buttercream that I made. He usually only likes Sam's Bakery kind, so this is very exciting! Thank you so much for a delicious recipe:)

I made this with the 1-1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter variation as suggested in some of the reviews. It came out perfectly! It really does make a lot though, so consider cutting the recipe in half.

Thought I would chime in because the reviews were old.  This recipe is great as written.  Butter always makes things better but the consistency is great.  If you are not a cake decorator or don't expect to make lots of cakes soon, 1/2 the recipe.  I used this for a "ho ho cake" a clone of the Hostess treat, to fill layers.  It was a hit! I replaced 1 tsp of vanilla with 1 tsp of almond extract just because I love the flavor. Also used 1/2 and 1/2 because that is what I had.  Awesome.

This is great! I gave it 4 stars because I did have to make modifications, so in it's original form I think it wouldn't have been as great. I did half butter and half shortening and about 7-71/2 cups of confectioners sugar. It's a little on the sweeter side so I could even go with less sugar. Using half the butter really gives it that nice buttercream taste so I do think it's necessary to make that adjustment. I tasted it before adding the heavy cream and it was really good, but still added the cream. I think it's great as is but I think I liked it better before adding the cream so next time I might try it without that.

Great taste, but not spreadable very well. I recommend putting it in the microwave for a minute or two. On a personal note, I don't like the fact that you can feel the grains of sugar while you are eating it. But other than that I love and recommend the recipe :)

Okay, I made this just as it said too.... I definitely couldn't get it to combine with all that powdered sugar using a blender, so I mixed by hand and then added milk because it was still too thick for my project.  
Honestly..... the taste was terrible.  I'm a major lover of butter cream frosting.... Ridiculously so. Like, I love only the corner piece of cake, and I hate whipped cream frosting, so I was super disappointed by the taste!!!  Try all the suggestions people give in the other reviews because this does not taste anything like buttercream you get on delicious sheet cakes from your local grocery.

Very good for piping-I agree with others to use 1 stick butter and 1-1/2 c shortening...i also have either added extra vanilla or flavored with orange flavoring or orange juice concentrate (if you don't mind a very slight orange tint)

To me, this recipe is all form and no flavor. It is the ideal consistency for  a nice buttercream. But it tastes like . .  Crisco! A giant spoonful of Crisco with each bite. I definitely prefer a buttercream made with butter (or at least some combination of shortening and butter). Can't give it more than three stars.

I don't know why I decided to use a different recipe than I usually do.. But i did. And eh. It tastes weird, too sweet and weird. I used earth balance, powdered sugar, according to the directions I actually didn't add the finally 1 and 1/3 cup of sugar because it was already too sweet. I put the salt, and real vanilla extract, and instead of heavy cream, almond milk and rice milk. But so sweet!! even adding unsweetened cocoa, it is still way too sweet.

YES! This is exactly what I've been looking for. Kids were not in favor of cream cheese frosting, so I had to find another one to frost their Xmas cupcakes for class. They loved it! Thanks for such an easy, yet tasty recipe! Very versatile too!

I had only a 1/2 cup of butter, so quartered the recipe, added more sugar than was called for, and the frosting turned out beautifully - I made it for the Sam's famous carrot cake. Very forgiving frosting, easy and changeable. Thanks!

I am giving this a 5 even though I think that I improved it by using half butter flavored shortening and half unsalted butter. I also used clear vanilla flavor since I needed white frosting. When I don't need white frosting, I use vanilla bean paste which is my secret ingredient. It takes it over the top in my opinion. My entire family thinks that I am the best baker, but all I am is a home baker that has some really great recipes and basic cooking skills.

I was looking for a chocolate buttercream recipe, and decided to customize this one.  I ran out of confectioner's sugar at the 4.5 Cup mark and added 2 cups cocoa powder for the chocolate.  I also used milk instead of cream since I didn't have cream on hand.  
I will say that with my modifications, all my  kids loved it, I found it to be the perfect sweet taste. If however I had followed the recipe as is, I think it would have been PERFECT.  So this recipe is now going to be my stand by recipe from now on.

OH MY FABULOUS!!!  I tried it before putting on the cupcakes.  I had to make myself stop - it is sooooooo good!  I did use 1/2 butter shortening and half real butter.  Definitely will make this again and again.

This really is the BEST Buttercream Frosting I have ever tasted! I don't like using shortening, so I used 1 1/2 cups of salted butter (did not use the 1/2 teaspoon of salt due to salted butter) and only 1/2 cup of shortening. This makes a TON of frosting, so I froze what I did not use. I couldn't stop tasting this...YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!

I like the texture and how thick it is for decorating and frosting with tips, but it's a bit rich in my opinion.  I used butter flavored Crisco...don't know if that had much of an impact on that or not.  I will still use this again, but with a few tweaks (like a bit more sugar) next time.  Overall a good base frosting recipe.

OMG...if you haven't tried this recipe, DO.  don't think about it, just do it.  i love to bake & decorate things...cookies, cakes, etc.  i've always had compliments on the buttercream i use, but it's never been a good frosting for decorating.  however, i never want to give up flavor for the sake of something being pretty.  this frosting is PERFECTION!  i did do half the shortening/half the butter suggestion and used real vanilla, but i'm sure following the recipe would also yield yummy results.  seriously, just try it.  you won't regret it and you'll have everyone begging you to frost anything in sight :)

So yummy!  One recipe frosts about 24 cupcakes.  I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco as well as a little less sugar and milk vs. cream and it was delicious and smooth!  Worked very well for piping frosting onto cupcakes.  This will be my go-to frosting.

Excellent buttercream in a hurry.  I needed one quickly and this one was easy as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Very tasty.  Since it was a layer between cake and fondant it didn't need to be pure white so I used butter flavor Crisco sticks and (my favorite) Nielsen-Massey vanilla paste. That added nice butter-vanilla flavor.  Not as smooth as some I've seen, but still, I'd mke this again as it was soo easy and tasty!

Made this exactly as written. This rivals any bakery's frosting. Holds up well and piped easily. I'm not gonna lie, I licked the bowl after my cupcakes were frosted! Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe...this is my go to frosting from now on!

If you are looking for the frosting you get at bakeries or grocery stores, this is it!  I love baking from scratch, but every once in a while, I would break down and buy a cake from our grocer's bakery just for the frosting.  I was never able to duplicate it at home, until now!  Thank you for sharing!

super easy, my 8 year old made it with the Kitchenaid & it turned out perfectly (unaltered). the only thing we did differently was to use all butter. Fantastic & simple.

Wonderful Wonderful recipe...everything I hoped it would be. My boys compared it to tasting like cookie dough, which in this house is a huge complement!  I, too, substituted a little butter (1 stick).

This is awesome!  I do a ton of baking and this is now my go to frosting recipe.  I cut this recipe in half this time since I did not need a boat load of icing.  I used 1 cup butter, left out salt since I use salted butter and 4 cups confectioners' sugar.  I did not have any whipping cream this time, so I used milk.  It is good but cream is the best.  I used this on cut out cookies and it works wonderfully.

I used half shortening and half butter in the recipe and it was still a bit greasy...only used about 3 ounces of cream but all of the sugar. I loved the sweetness of this frosting because I am a frosting person for sure :). I will try making it in the future using all shortening versus all butter to see which I and my family prefer.

I've FINALLY found a buttercream recipe that works! I had to make a big birthday cake and it worked beautifully! I followed it exactly and other than being kinda hard to mix towards the end of the powdered sugar, it was super easy! Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Easy to make and tasty.  I used .25 c butter to 1.75 c shortening... consitency was good for cupcakes and held up in Texas heat.  However, but not buttery enough for me.  Next time I will use more butter and less shortening.

I didn't care for this. I definitely tasted the shortening and did not like the texture in my mouth. The next time I made a buttercream frosting I opted for actual butter. It was so much better.

This is the BEST icing I have ever made or tasted!!  Now granted, I made a few adjustments--subbed a cup of salted butter for shortening and almond emulsion for the vanilla, but it turned out beautifully and was so easy.  I have never used a buttercream recipe that calls for heavy cream, only just a tablespoon or two of milk, so I was a little skeptical, but it made it so creamy and light.  This is it from here on out.  I will never use another icing recipe again!

I made it with 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter. The taste is really yummy and it spreads very well. I found I could pipe many intricate details, but not those that had to hold themselves up. It would need to be a bit stiffer for that to be perfect. But for "frosting and borders" as described, it is spot-on.

It had a nice taste to it. I used half butter and half shortening. I did have some problems with it holding its shape, next time I will do all shortening for piping.

Absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used genuine vanilla extract as I did not have the clear imitation extract. I suspect the main difference is in the color of the icing, which in this case was a creamy white rather than a snow white. Fabulous ... I'll be using this as my go to white icing.

Amazing! I cut the recipe in half and had plenty for a small cake and 48 mini cupcakes. The only thing different I did with the recipe was use whole milk instead of the cream (only because I didn't have time to run to the store) and I used regular imm. vanilla. Color didn't matter because my daughter wanted purple frosting. This was a hit with all of the preschoolers and adults!

Wonderful frosting! Made it exactly as instructed (or close to, because I never use a measuring cup!) I frosted 50 cupcakes and still had a little left over! Will definitely use again and again!

This frosting was ah-mazing. It was the best homemade frosting I've had. I only used it for a layer cake, so I didn't do any piping or detail work, so I'm not sure how it would hold up to that. Using the clear vanilla left the frosting really, really white, and that made it really easy to add color to. This will definitely be my go to frosting from now on!

We are VEGAN here at my house, so I used 1 cup smart balance, 1 cup short., the rest was the same but the heavy cream. I replaced it with 4 ounces of Silk. Worked excellent- I even added key lime juice to one half and 4 TB of Peanut Butter to the other half to frost two types of cupcakes. :)

Good thick frosting. I am more of an "all butter" buttercream frosting kind of girl as far as flavor.However, I used this for a baby shower cake,wanting a frosting that would hold form well.It did did a good job.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it! It's not as rich as the previous recipe I was using which was what I was looking for. I did use more cream and even added milk to help thin it out. The taste is really great and I love that it's pure white since there is no butter! This will be the recipe I use from now on!

FANTASTIC! I didn't have cream so I used 2% and it's probably not as fluffy as it should be but still delicious. I also didn't add the salt because my butter/shortening was salted. Can't wait for my guests to try it.

This frosting is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly ahead of time and then let it sit out for about a half hour before using.  It became very soft while working with it so next time I don't think I'll set it out before using.  Also, it makes quite a bit. I frosted a 9 x 13 cake with trimmings and only used half of the frosting.  Keep that in mind when making this recipe and half or double as needed. Great tasted.  I had a lot of complements on this frosting.  I'll always make this frosting.  No more store bought frosting for us.

I suggest using the Crisco butter flavor for this recipe.  Make sure to add the powdered sugar in slowly, it gets very thick before adding in the heavy cream to give it a frosting consistancy.  The Crisco butter flavor gives it at great buttercream flavor!!  This also holds frosting coloring very well, so you don't have to use as much!!!  Loved it!

I made it to ice gluten-free/vegan cookies... I used 3/8 cup coconut milk and squeezed 1/2 a lime in it... YUUUMMMM! Will definitely use this again! I agree with the other comments, I beat the crisco with the lemon juice and milk a while to soften it up before adding sugar - it came out light and fluffy and PERFECT! and i usually screw up EVERYTHING! :)

Great recipe.  I used half (1 cup) shortening and half (1 cup) butter because I did not have enough shortening.  After reading other reviews, I did not add the salt.  Tasted great!  Came out with a great consistency and tinted beautifully.  I only needed 2 ounces of heavy cream.  I used pure almond extract instead and gave it a nice flavor.  Held up very well in humidity and heat.   Thank you!

I just made this frosting following the recipe but the shortening tasted bland, so I added some melted butter (once i used partially frozen butter, only, without the shortening - turned out clumpy, but I had to use regular suger so maybe that's why), about half a stick, and some sugar and it tasted awesome! It is so easy to spread and the shortening AND butter version has great taste AND the consistency is the best! We spread the frosting on a cake (there was about half the amount left over and I'm saving it for the nest cake). We also made designs on the cake out of frosting. This frosting is VERY good, tasty, and easy to make!

This was really good!  I used it twice--once to make some cupcake frosting for some birthday cupcakes, and then again to put the inner layer of icing on a fondant cake for my son's birthday.  The first time I used milk because I had no cream, and it worked fine, but I had to use less to get the icing to hold its shape--it had the same flavor, though, and it was good!  Sweet and creamy and tasty, oh my!

I made this frosting with half shortening and half butter, it was AWESOME!  Although i put it on my son's chocolate birthday cake, i used a sheet cake recipe and the cake turned out kinda dry almost brownie like i don't think it went together the best, but everyone said it was good.

There is really no need for me to rate this, as so many people already have, but I will anyways! I have really been looking for a great recipe to remind me of home(now living in Austria, and they just don't frost cakes like this here at all!!) and I have finally found it!! I like all kinds of frosting, but when I want the ones that remind me of the bakery's at my local grocery store, I will go for this one!! Thanks for sharing! I followed the recipe to a T, except that I did half it! :)

this frosting was delicious! however, I did use half butter in the recipe instead of all shortening. I halved the recipe, which would be a wise choice unless you're making a wedding cake or cupcakes for a small army. downside is that the dessert has to be refrigerated because of the butter and cream.

This is now my go to frosting. I do substitute butter for shortening because that is how I was raised. It does make a lot which is ok if you are doing some decorating. It also keeps well in the fridge. I am glad I found this recipe so I don't have to buy frosting in the store.

Followed he recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I dont like frosting (unless its cream cheese) so I wont tell you what i thought of the taste.  Doesnt matter what i thought anyway, i used it on my daughters 12th bday cake and what matters is what SHE thought.  She LOVED it!!  I had a hard time getting all 8 cups of sugar mixed with the shortning, but i did add about 7.  The texture was a bit grainy so i added a bit more cream.  Let the Kitchen-aid do all the work for a good 8 min.  It was so easy to work with.  I will DEF use again!!

This frosting tastes so good!  And it was easy.  Seems almost fool proof.  I did the recommended 6 ounces of cream and the consistency is perfect.  Used 1.5 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter as recommended by others.  I think next time I will try splitting the shortening/butter ratio to half and half.  But no complaints as is.  Used real vanilla so it's not pure white but I just cook for our family so I don't care.

I wanted to eat the whole batch out of the bowl.  Screw the cake!  This was sooooo good.  I made this with a yellow cake for mothers day and got so many compliments.  It was the best cake they ever had.  It did make a lot, but next time if I make cake it'll be a double decker just so I can use more yummy icing on it!

Just a cooking snob comment or observation, if you will.  But IMITATION VANILLA???  You would admit that in a public forum?  Get yourself some real vanilla. I'm not sure why they even sell the fake stuff.  Why buys it?  Oh that's right, you do!  LOL

I make this with butter rather than shortening, and it turns out very nice. I had to down-scale it a lot for my typical 9x13" cakes, but it does very well so thanks for sharing. A few spoons of cocoa powder make for a nice chocolate icing, and balances the sweetness very well. Sometimes I use instant coffee granules mixed with a very small amount of water instead of some of the heavy cream. That makes a very nice mocha flavor.

This is exactly the kind of buttercream I wanted - sugary and stiff, just like the bakery.  I substituted about 1/6 of the shortening with butter.  The frosting has a really good flavor.

It's delicious. If you are going to color the icing, dissolve the salt in the cream first. If you don't, you will get little white spots after the color sets.  Otherwise, it's not too sweet. I would advise to follow the recipe as is. Adding all the sugar gives it a good consistency. Believe it or not, it does not add to the sweetness. If you think it's too sweet after adding all the sugar, add a little salt to cut the sweetness. If you think it's too dry, add a little water in small amounts. A little goes a long way.

Always turns out great, especially when you use butter instead of shortening and REAL vanilla extract! I almost always use 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and it still turns out wonderful.

I used this recipe for the first time a few weeks ago for my son's first birthday and it was beyond fantastic.  I used 1.5 cups shortening and 1/2 cup unsalted butter, but the consistency was perfect for spreading and it made enough to decorate my very large cake (4 9X11 cakes) with some to spare.  I have never had so many positive comments about my baking as I have about this icing.  My sister has even requested that my mom make her a cake with "Jessa's icing" (she knows i'm not the one who created the recipe, just that I know how to make it).  So easy, not enough can be said about this icing.

Because of a few reviews I subbed 1/2 of the shortening with butter.  This was a great recipe, though maybe a little too sweet--I would add less powdered sugar.  Made a LOT of frosting.

very good and easy to make. i made this twice (once in a practice run and once "for real") for the practice run i used butter flavored crisco and in addition to the vanilla added a bit of almond extract. the second time i used 1 1/2 C butter crisco and 1/2 C unsalted butter and only the vanilla. both batches were very good and held up well to decorating. the batch with real buttter did go a little soft after being at room temp for a few hours. i will use this recipe again.
update: made again, used only butter this time. turned out good (but think will be too soft for intricate decorating), but it should be fine for "piping and stars" decorating

What a Wonderful Frosting! Easy to make, easy to work with and tastes great! I also whipped the shortning for approx. 20 min. Approved by my five year old (who chose it over another homemade icing) and my husband who is picky when it comes to sweets!

This is the BEST buttercream frosting recipe!  It tastes just like bakery frosting!  I follow the recipe exactly when I am decorating a cake, however when I am simply frosting cupcakes or cookies, I use 1 cup of unsalted butter and 1 cup of shortening instead of 2 cups of shortening.  It turns out wonderful each time I make it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Followed recipe as written.  Very good.  I add unsweetened cocoa to a portion of the the frosting and that was even better!  It covered a two layered 8 inch round cake and 24 cupcakes and there was still leftovers.

Awesome Frosting!!  You have to make it with butter instead of shortening though!  It's so good you don't even need cake, I'll just eat it straight up!  Leave out the salt if you use salted butter.  I always add extra vanilla, but that's a matter of taste.  Let the mixer whip it for a long long time and it's the fluffiest creamiest frosting ever!

I have been decorating for 10 years now and I always used the same buttercream recipe, it worked great with a type of shortening ment just for cake icing. We moved to a very rural area where all I can get is crisco now. I made this 3 times in the last 2 weeks, everyone loved it. I did make a few changes. I can't get clear vanilla here so I used 1t real vanilla and 1t imitation. I let it mix for about 10 minutes at the end. I made it with 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter and it was firm enough to make flowers and ice cakes but I used fondant over the top. I haven't tried to decorate with it in any other way but when I do I will edit this review. All in all great buttercream icing. I will be using it from here on out.

I used this recipe to ice a red velvet cake. I usually use a cream cheese frosting, but buttercream was requested. I was initially skeptical about the quantities, but after reading several reviews i modified the recipe somewhat. 1 1/2 cups butter flavored shortening, 1/2 cup butter, and approximately 6 cups. (I added one cup powdered sugar at a time until reaching the right consistency.) Then I added the salt, 2 tsp real vanilla extract, and about 7/8 ounces of heavy cream. The result was perfect. This makes a lot of frosting. probably enough to do two whole cakes, but the cake I made was 3 layers. Red velvet cake crumbs easily. so I did a thin layer of frosting to trap them, and placed the cake in the freezer for 20 min so it could set. then I added the outer layer of frosting. This frosting holds its texture well, and I believe it could be used for decorating if you used the whole 8 cups of powdered sugar.

WOW is all I can say. I have never made buttercream frosting before and I'll never look for another recipe after making this one. After reading other reviews, I nixed the shortening for unsalted butter and kept everything else the same, apart from using real vanilla extract.   I made the entire recipe, and it was way too much for my cake so I have a whole tub of leftovers! Next time I'll cut it in half for my chocolate cake.  Thank you so much for this recipe. You made me look like a culinary genius and my family LOVED the cake. This is my go to dessert from now on.

This is the BEST buttercream frosting.  I halved the recipe and used half shortening (crisco butter flavored) and half unsalted butter.  It is so good, not greasy tasting and not too sweet, just the right amount of sweetness.  I did added alittle more heavy cream to thin it out alittle and 2 tablespoons of light corn syrup, this helps it soften more and gives it some shine, I will use this from now on, way better than the wwwaaayyy to sweet bakery icing.

This recipe is everything you can ask for when looking for the perfect buttercream frosting. I halved the recipe and it was plenty to frost a 2-layer 9inch cake. I used butter flavored shortening ( that's what I had on hand), so it didn't stay perfectly white, but that's not the recipe's fault.  I have also added different flavors ( lemon and coconut are my favorite) and received plenty of compliments every time. I do add a couple of tbs. of light corn syrup so the frosting is smoother. This way it is easier to frost big areas of cake without any "bubbles/holes" and the surface becomes much smoother and prettier.  Will be making again!!

this recipe was great! since i needed to cover 1 half-sheet, 1 quarter sheet, a 1 baby cake and make roses i changed the recipe to yield enough for 75 people. i started out with 2 cups pre-creamed shortening, 2cups unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon of vanilla,6 ox cream and by the time i added my second bag of sugar( 32oz each or 8cups) it was way too sweet! so i pulled out my cornstarch and began adding 1 tablespoon of shortening and 1 tablespoon of butter until it was just right. this was a very easy buttercream. it had to be easy since i was working with the bare essentials= a hand mixer, a bucket, a plastic serving knife and a scraper. *** side note pre-creamed shortening makes the frosting a little softer. thank you rick and everyone else who added their two cents!

This frosting is so smooth it's not even funny! I added a little more vanilla and sugar to suit my tastes, but I did end up halving the whole recipe to frost the top of a 9x13 cake. Delicious.

This is a yummy frosting. I never made frosting before but it was better than the birthday you buy at the store. I sub 1/2 of the shortening for butter and use milk (that was all we had) instead of heavy cream. It was good. thanks.

This is a great frosting for decorating cakes.  I have used it for 3 cakes so far and am very happy with it!  I like that it is so easy and I won't have to buy frosting from the bakery to decorate birthday cakes with from now on!  It also makes a large batch. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 crisco and 1/2 butter. That's the only alteration I made from the original.  Thanks!

I loved this frosting! The only substitution I made was I used butter extract in place of the vanilla. It didn't get 5 stars because it didn't yield as much frosting as it says in the recipe. I ended up having to make more to complete my project.

I used 2 C butter instead of shortening, piped half the frosting on home-made cupcakes, then added 3/4 C cocoa to the rest of the it to make chocolate frosting. The frosting held up well indoors for at least a day. Cupcakes didn't last past a day, so I don't know how well they would have held up past that.

I don't know if it is because it was humid when I made this, or if it was because I used half shortening and half butter, but this turned out waaaaaay too soft. I couldn't do anything with it when it came to decorating. But it did taste delicious  :o)

OMG!! This is the best frosting ive ever had, very comparable to bakery frosting, and so easy. Made the night before, and it was just as good the next day. I did use 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups shortning.

Exceptional. I used it to do the fancy frosting swirls on top of cupcakes. I did the coconut cream pound cake as cupcakes and frosted with this but instead of vanilla extract in the frosting I used coconut extract and it was AMAZING.

It tastes a lot like bakery frosting. It was very hard to mix if you follow the instructions because the powdered sugar and shortening (even softened) becomes to hard to mix with a beater. The first time I made the recipe it broke my hand held mixer so try the other reviewers suggestions. Overall, I like it.

I tried the recipe exactly as written, and it had an overpowering and unappetizing shortening taste. It also left a heavy shortening film on everything. Because of everyone else's high reviews, I will try it once more ... with half shortening and half butter, though.

I've tried a few other buttercream recipes and this one was by far the best. I made this for my daughters 4th of July ice cream cake and it was delicious! The only adjustment I made was used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cups of shortening. My hubby even liked it and he doesn't even really like anything sweet. He told me not to change a thing about it. It's such a great & easy recipe that I'll never buy store bought frosting again. Thanks Rick!

Very good!  Also known as Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting here.  I used half butter for flavor.  My only concern is that the frosting has cracked a bit where I put the toothpicks to keep the plastic wrap from touching. Hopefully I can smooth it out a bit before the party tomorrow.  But it does taste great--the heavy cream makes it creamier (go figure!) than store bought frosting, or bakery cakes.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it is amazing!!! The most delicious buttercream frosting ever!  The recipe makes a large quantity.  Enough for frosting a layer cake plus decorations.

I love this frosting as is, and half butter/half shortening! It colors so well, pipes easily, and spreads smoothly. Thank you for a great recipe!

This frosting is fabulous!  I made it exactly as is, and it got rave reviews!  I've used it on both confetti and butter pecan cakes, and it complemented both very well.  I think this could be used on almost any cake or cupcake.  It piped well and was easy to color.

I'm giving this 5 stars not becuase I liked it (I hate buttercream icing) but because it really did taste like bakery buttercream and it was great for decorating a very elaborate cake I made. The people who do like buttercream loved it though.

There were compliments on this frosting at the party I made the cake for but personally I found it greasy.  I used the suggested 1/2 cup butter to 1 1/2 cups shortening.  I think the only thing that saved it was the flavor.  I used almond, 2 tsp. and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I think next time I'm going to use something else.  But...I tried:)

This was the best frosting I have ever made! I did use 1 cup of butter in place of 1 of the cups of shortening. I also added 1 teaspoon each of vanilla, almond and butter extracts, which I highly recommend adding to any frosting recipe. It held up really well for piping (I actually did a basketweave pattern). It has great consistency and a wonderful taste. Everyone should try it!

Wow this is awesome!! This was my first attempt at making and decorating my kids birthday cake and this frosting not only tasted amazing, it was so easy to work with in regards to decorating with the wilton tips. I did use all butter, otherwise kept the recipe the same. I could only make 3/4 of the batch at once in my kitchenaid, it does make alot but it sure goes once the family gets a taste. I did find letting it mix for like 5 minutes made it much fluffier and even better.

I normally try not to deviate from a recipe if I plan to review it, but I couldn't resist on this one. I did not have shortening, but did have unsalted butter on hand, so I substituted that instead of the shortening. Other than that, I followed the recipe precisely. This was my first attempt at buttercream frosting and I think I need to look no further. I used it with the Simple White Cake also on allrecipes and it tasted just like a cake I would pick up at a grocery store bakery but since I made it myself, it was a fraction of the cost. I think from now on, I'll save my $20 and use these 2 recipes whenever an occasion comes up when I need a frosted cake. This frosting was so easy to make, easy to spread and easy to pipe on. Goodbye Betty Crocker frosting, it's time we parted ways.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY to the letter and it came out light, fluffy and delicious!  I had tons left over after frosting a 9 inch double layer cake and my family couldn't keep from tasting the leftover icing!  If you are looking for a fantastic Buttercream Icing recipe, look no further.  Thanks Rick!

It was so sweet. I had to mix it w/ another recipe of whip cream and cream cheese just to cut the sweetness. I gave it a two star instead of one only because I was able to ice the cake as a base frosting- no decorating.

Made this exactly as stated in the recipe. Tasteless and bland, and way too soft for piping/decorations. Will look for another buttercream recipe.

This was a simple and easy recipe!  I used half butter and half shortening to get the feel I wanted and whipped it for 20 min. in a Kitchenaid mixer.  I added 1 1/2 tsp. of CLEAR butter extract and I added an extra 1/2 tsp of CLEAR vanilla for an awesome taste. The frosting does leave just the slightest greasy feeling in your mouth.  Next time, I will do a 3/4 butter 1/4 shortening mix to see if it helps with the greasy feel.  This frosting beats any bakery or store bought frosting for taste!    I used it to make a 6 car train cake for my 3 yr. old.  The frosting colored well (I used Americolor gels) and held it's shape fairly well.  After I frosted the "cars", I added another 1/2 cup of sugar to stiffen up the frosting so I could pipe the decorations on the train.  I felt I could have added alittle more in hindsight and may try that next time as well.  I used this frosting as "glue" to hold the various items on the train and it performed quite well.  All in all, anyone could make this recipe and do splendidly with it!  Try this one; you won't regret it!!

This was my first attempt at a buttercream frosting.  It was wonderful!  I read several of the reviews and decided to go with 1 1/2 c. butter flavored crisco and 1/2 c. butter.  To save on money, I used about 1/2 can of 5 oz of cream instead of whipping cream.  I might should've used a little more to make it more spreadable.  I had made a cake for my 5 yr. old's b-day party.  I got RAVE reviews!  The icing made enough to frost 2 13x9 cakes.  I did not have enough left over to decorate...had to make another 1/2 batch.  I was so pleased with it.  Fantastic!

Used half butter, half vegetable shortening and I added 3 teaspoons coconut extract and it was phenomenal. I added an extra ounce of cream which made mine VERY easily spreadable.

This was really great. And it made a TON! I made it to decorate a cake for my son's birthday, and I thought I might have to make a little extra. But it made more than enough for the whole job. Took color well also. This is going to be my new icing recipe. Oh, I used half butter, half shortening.

This was really good. Nice and creamy. I didn't use whipping cream, but instead I used hazelnut coffee creamer and it gave it a different flavor. Next time I'm going to use vanilla flavored coffee creamer and leave out the extract, too!

This is my first review on AllRecipes and I regret that it is a negative one. I followed this recipe as written, except I used 1/2 cup butter and 1-1/2 cups shortening. There is no butter flavor at all, and it is sickening sweet. Also a tad greasy, but another reviewer mentioned that Crisco should not be used, and that is what I used. I'll be sticking with my old buttercream recipe. This was a disappointment.

I've done it with half butter and half crisco and then I've done it with all crisco.  My family likes it either way, but there not as picky with their baked goods as they are with cooking.  But I will use this recipe from now on.  Easy and delish!

I made this frosting back in August for my grandsons 3rd birthday.  I made a train cake and used this frosting to decorate a 3-D Thomas train and a loaf and cupcakes.  It was easy to decorate with and the intricate details held up under the humidity.  The only negative about it was the taste.  I thought it tasted a little greasy, although everyone else thought it tasted good.  I used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  Next time I'll try 1/2 of each.

AWESOME frosting!!  I have been trying all of them on this site lately and this has been my favorite!!  I did as some suggested and used 1 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup of butter and used butter flavoring as well as vanilla.  So good and I got soooooo many compliments.  This recipe does make A LOT.  I had a lot to frost so it was great for me.  I was able to frost 33 cupcakes and 2 bundt cakes and I still had enough left over to do a few dozen sugar cookies. Please try this recipe, its great!!

This icing is AMAZING! I looked at the recommendations from others and made the following changes. I used 1 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1 cup of butter. I also added 1 teaspoon of butter flavor (I'll probably use 2 tsp. next time) I piped icing and made decorations with no problem. I was licking the icing of the spoon like ice cream, because it was so good.

I subbed 1/2 cup salted butter and cut the shortening to 1.5 c. I also used only 6 C of powdered sugar.

I whipped the heavy cream first before adding any ingredients until still peaks formed (10 minutes), then I mixed the shortening/butter together in a different bowl before adding it all together.  The frosting is stiff, firm, yet smooth and flexible.  Absolutely amazing.  I personally think it's way too sweet, but my hubby says it's the best frosting he's ever tasted

Great consistency, and taste. It also looks good. I frosted a chocolate cake with this and it held up the whole day with no problems. It didn't harden or lose its fluffiness. I would recommend this frosting if you like butter cream. I think I might also use this recipe to frost my sugar cookies.

This is the best BC frosting out there. I have tried many others.  The flavor is wonderful without the butter in the recipe.  The whipped cream in the recipe makes the difference. Never forget the whipped cream!!

Wow!  So much better than store bought frosting, everyone loved it- added bonus, no trans-fat, which is why we decided to go with homemade in the first place.  I made a few changes based off the other reviews: Used all butter (unsalted) and only 6 cups of sugar which I sifted.  I also used a pinch or two less salt than called for (since I'd cut back on the sugar).  Turned out great!

I tried it the first time as written and it was yummy but a too sweet for my taste. I would add 1 tsp butter extract for a buttercream taste and also use pure vanilla extract. It gives you just a bit of ivory instead of stark white icing which I prefer.  The consistency was kinda soft too. The second time I made it with the some other reviewers recommendations and Yummy Yummy YUM! I used 1 1/2C shortening and 1/2C butter and used only 5C sugar. I also used real vanilla extract.  It was very delicious, but quite soft. I also had an issue with melting. I think I would need to add a few cups of sugar and use less cream to actually make it useful for piping and being intricate with designs.  All in all its a good recipe because it tastes great (with the adjustments) and its adjustable. I'll have to play with it a bit more before I commit to only using this recipe.

This frosting turned out perfect. I made a lemon cake for my husband's birthday and chose to make this frosting. I subsituted the vanilla extract for lemon extract and it turned out perfect!!! A little on the sweet side but not too sweet if you know what I mean. I will be using this again!!!

Oh wow!  This was spectacular!  This was the first time I have ever made frosting and I found it to be just perfect as is in the recipe.  Not too sweet, not too greasy, just perfect! I guess that I did not get the shortening creamed well enough before adding the sugar so I ended up having to add the remaining 3 cups after I put in the heavy cream but it was a HUGE hit!  I even have about a cup of frosting left over in the fridge!  Think I will make sugar cookies for it!  ;o)

This was a pretty good frosting.  I dont really think it tasted like buttercream as much since it didnt have any butter flavor in it.  But it was very easy and I had the stuff on hand to make it.  I was really wanting to make it an almond flavor with some almond extract, but I ran out.  I put this on top of an almond wedding cake recipe on zaar.  I halved the recipe and it was well more than enough for a 9x13 cake.  I had a lot of extra even halving it.  I ended up having to use 6 oz. of the cream to make it nice and smooth.  Next time I make it I am definitely going to put in the almond extract.  If I wanted a real buttercream taste, than I would take others advice and use half butter or even all butter in place of the shortening.  Great frosting recipe!

I have been making cakes for years but was tired of the traditional crisco frosting.  I made one change, I used one cup of regular crisco and one cup of butter flavored crisco.  It gives it more of an off white color but I love the whipped cream texture.

This is the best!  I cut the recipe in half.  (1 box of sugar, 1 stick of butter 1/2 cup of shortening, 1 teaspoon of real vanilla, no salt, 1/4+ cup of cream.)  This was the perfect amount for a two layer cake.  The frosting tastes great and it tints very well.  This is light and not "gritty".  My children loved it.

My first time every attempting a buttercream frosting and I found the recipe to be very easy and user-friendly - that's why I'm giving it five stars (it was also pretty good)!!  Next time I think that I will try half butter and half shortening as suggested by others.  I used this for the Coconut Cream Cake I recipe on this site.  I halved the recipe and it was enough to frost a two-layer 9-inch cake and to use for the filling.  Even though I halved it I still ended up using all 6 ounces of heavy cream - I think if I had only used 3 oz. that it would have been too stiff and difficult to spread.  I will also cut down slightly on the amount of sugar in the future.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, but decided to try it since I had a dozen banana muffins to frost.  I cut the recipe into thirds and used:  1 stick of butter, 2 C powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla extract, and 1 T of milk and it was perfect.  I was shocked, actually.  It tastes like the stuff you get at the store, but better.  Thanks for the recipe.  It really does work.

This was very delicious! I did want a little buttery taste, so I did alter the recipe by using 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 1.5 cups shortening I made cupcakes for my daughters playgroup with this frosting, and they came out beautiful. It tints very easily, and also pipes well. comes together very fast---I used my stand mixer. It does yield a huge amount of frosting. More than I needed for 24 cupcakes. Definitely will make again---so much better than store bought frosting and so easy!

Absolutely delish!  Easy to work with, even when making a round soccer ball with "grass" on the bottom.  Worked perfectly and very good taste.  Highly recommended.  I used dark vanilla since I was going to color it anyways, and just added a bit more for taste.

Very easy to make and perfect consistency for frosting cakes, piping details, and frosting cupcakes or cookies! Mmmm!
As a personal preference I use butter instead of shortening.

Okay, I have to admit I was a little weary of this recipe since it calls for shortening, but since I am a beginner I stuck for the recipe ;)  Oh, and I am glad I did!  I was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used this on a cake (also from this site) for coworker’s birthday.  Everyone loved it :)  I am so proud of myself (sorry beginner)!

This is "wedding cake" frosting. I used it to make "ice cream cone cupcakes" for my son's pre-school class. The theory being, "They only eat the frosting anyway, so let's give 'em three inches of messiness to sugar up on!" 
Seriously, a delicious recipe and VERY EASY to make and use. I used Butter Crisco quarters and it worked perfect and completely NOT too greasy.

This was a great recipe for decorating cakes. I tested the texture before I put it in the frosting bag, make sure it is not too thick. This was a really good choice.

First time I had ever made frosting.  Turned out great.  A little too sweet the first time so cut back on the confectioners sugar by 1 cup the second time.  Tinted well and was easy to pipe the frosting out.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!   
I do make some changes... If using shortening, I use butter flavored Crisco.  But usually I do this recipe using 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 unsweetened butter.  I just whip the Crisco and butter together first until it is a very light color.  :)

This frosting is fabulous.  I used another reviewer's suggestion for 3/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. shortening, 1 t. vanilla, & 3 tbsp heavy cream - turned out perfectly for my half a cake for my daughter's 6 month birthday. Thank you!

I love this recipe!  I add almond extract along with the vanilla extract and I did have to add more heavy cream too.  What I like most about it besides the great flavor is that it makes a ton!  I am able to frost a whole sheet cake including the border plus cupcakes too!

I thought this made for a really great decorating frosting.  The consistency was spreadable and easy to dispense in decorating bags and it wasn't too sweet or heavy.

Edited: Actually, I found out I added almost a whole teaspoon of salt by accident. Either way, the salty aftertaste disappeared overnight; it tasted great. The buttercream spread beautifully and tinted to lovely pastel colors. Everyone loved it, they said it was delicious and the birthday girl took spoonfuls and ate the frosting alone :) Thanks for the great recipe!

Make sure you do the first step in a big bowl over a place that's easy to clean up and add the sugar a bit at a time! My little brother dumped a lot in at once and we could hardy stir without the sugar flying all over the place XD.

disappointed by this recipe.  It tastes like shortening, not butter.  It gets two stars because it has a frosting consistency which would at least get one by in a jam - meaning, it will lay on a cake and look like fluffy frosting.  But it is not good for a birthday cake for someone one likes.  And it is does not help the reputation of the person who makes it as a good cook.  Like I said, disappointing.

Having read previous reviews and being of the younger crowd I thought this recipe sounded like exactly what I wanted.  I do think this recipe is fantastic, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted.  It was too buttery, not creamy enough, and a bit on the sweet side.  With that said, and with what other reviewers have posted, I am not scrapping this recipe but will try to alter it specifically to what I want.

Beware, I halved the recipe and it iced a cake and I have enough left over for at least three more cakes.  We shall see how well this stuff keeps.  :)

After searching for the perfect and easiest buttercream (not too sweet), I have finally found it right HERE!! I followed the modifications of another reviewer to use 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, 5 cups powdered sugar and 4 ozs heavy cream. I did add the salt. However, I used cake/icing shortening which gave a clean, non-greasy aftertaste as opposed to regular (crisco) shortening. The piping came out excellent! However, I will try to use 4-1/2 cups powdered sugar and 5 ozs heavy cream for a softer, less sweeter tasting buttercream filling for a cake roll. No need to take forever making Meringue buttercreams anymore. I think this recipe is way better!

Awesome!! Really easy, MUCH easier than other white frostings i've made-the shortening makes it more stable than butter...I did use 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, but made no other changes- made a castle cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday...was a HUGE hit...People asked me where we bought the delicious cake! I am making another cake for a friend towmorrow...will be making another batch of this for sure!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Wow. I just made this the other night for my son's birthday cake and cupcakes. 1) It was SO easy compared to the meringue buttercreams I used to make 2) It got rave reviews from EVERYONE and 3) Did I mention how easy it is to make?  I used 1c of butter, 1c of vegetable shortening, and 5 cups of powdered sugar. The first batch i used 6 oz of cream but found it was a little too light for decorating (it just softens quicker).  I also added a little salt the first time around but I don't think it needs it. Every once in a while I would taste a little salt here and there.  The second batch I made the buttercream using 4 oz of cream and omitted the salt. It was DELICIOUS!  It really is as good as the meringue buttercreams if not better because it has a smoother, lighter, creamier taste. I'm definitely using this recipe from now on.

Great Frosting recipe!  I made this recipe for my daughter's sixth birthday party because I did not want to serve an artificially flavored frosting to young children.  As an American expat living in the UK, it was a bit of a challenge to find a Crisco alternative, but I managed.  Trex did the job, along with butter, to make this wonderful Buttercream Frosting.  Thank you for sharing this with the world!

While this frosting tasted good, it was a little too "greasy" tasting for me.  We prefer the recipes made with butter instead of shortening.

I thought this frosting came out great, and it wasn't gross like some buttercream frostings are. The only problem was that it came out a little to liquidy, but I put it in the freezer for a minute or two and thickened it up perfectly. I will probably be making it again.

This is the best frosting that I've ever made especially for decorating a cake.  I've used it over and over again just the way the recipe reads and now I'll give it a try with half butter.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Rick.

This is the BEST buttercream frosting EVER!!!  I found it on the net, read the user suggestions and replaced 1/2 white Crisco with unsalted butter.  Unbelievable taste.  I used it to make a 25th Anniversary and a 50th Birthday cake.  The guests LOVED them.  All of my cakes will be frosted with this icing until they pry the spatula out of my hands.

Delicious!  I used it to ice sugar cookies.  I used all butter (no vegetable shortening) and replaced the cream with evaporated milk.  This made the frosting a little bit runny, which was what I wanted to glaze cookies.  I will definitely make this again!

With some modifications, this is a very delicious recipe. I make this recipe with half-butter & half-shortening, 6 cups of icing sugar (instead of 8) and regular pure vanilla extract. Sure, the icing comes out kinda of cream-coloured instead of bright white, but it still tastes and looks delicious!

At first I thought this would be gross, using Butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  However, the creaminess and flavor were awesome.  Didn't finish frosting cookies, put it in the fridge and frosting was just as great the next day!  I will never use a different frosting ever again!

Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Although this is not technically a "real Buttercream", the shortening makes this taste like a frosting you would get at a bakery.  It is also great for decorating - it has the perfect stiffness.  Everyone loved it when I used it for my 4-year-old's birthday cake.

Fab-u-lous! Best buttercreanm recipe I've ever tried. Didn't change a thing and it came out perfect. Loved how eventhough the cake was refrigerated overnight once it was left at room temp. it softened up again. Will definitely keep onhand to use with other cakes. I used a vanilla bean paste and it didn't change the colour of the frosting, it just added little specks of vanilla thoughout which I like.

I found this not good at all. It was plenty sweet, but still tasted like shortening to me, and I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening. I gave it three stars because I ended up using it on my red velvet cake and people still seemed to eat it. Will be trying the land-o-lakes recipe next time.

This recipe is O.K. But, I use half shortening and half butter, I also add the equivalent in powdered egg whites (2-3 whites)  That is like the bakery kind of frosting.

Sweet and fluffy.  I used 1 stick butter and 1 stick butter flavored Crisco.  This may sound strange but as a compliment to a not so sweet cake the frosting was a little too sweet.  I think that on a sweeter cake it wouldn't have tasted so sweet.  The frosting itself; a five star recipe.

I decorate many cakes for my family and I draw on the cakes with frosting. So I need a fluffy, easy to spread frosting that holds its shape. This frosting worked better than most I have tried.

I also used the suggestions for 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortening.  It turned out great.  I used it to make flowers and other decorations and it was fine. But I did put it in the refrigerator for 1 hour before decorating and it hardened up nicely.

I took a cake decorating course and one of the items we were taught to make was buttercream frosting which was very good, but I thought this was better.  I used 3 parts white crisco to 1 part butter and 7 cups confectioners sugar and it was excellent.  Will try different things based on other reviewers.

I have been making this buttercream for a few times now.  This is a great recipe.  This weekend, I made it with 6 1oz choc squares (make sure to use the unsweetened-melt it in a double broiler, then add it to the batter in between the sugar additions) to get a choc buttercream to frost my choc cake.
YUMMY!   Thanks Rick!

Great recipe.  I substituted Coco Lopez cream of coconut for the heavy whipping cream and even added some coconut oil and flakes to twist this into a truly INSANE coconut frosting. I want my frostings really light so I did an entire can of Coco Lopez and added almost a cup of heavy whipping cream as well. I have also replaced the vanilla extract with peppermint oil and created a sweet peppermint frosting that gives a great Christmas flavor to the frosting. This one goes in my permanent recipe stock!

I used the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening version of this recipe for a sculpted cake with a lot of detail.
I made sure I used a smooth knife dipped in cool water to spread the frosting and used many different decorating tips.  The frosting behaved very well for all uses and tasted great.  I beat the second batch at a higher speed for a slightly longer time, resulting in an even smoother texture.  I will use this recipe again.

I liked this icing but i think i would have added a bit more of the sugar.  I only added six cups and although it was rich and delicious i just wish it was sweeter.  I have a sweet tooth so when i indulge...i like to indulge! It did ice my son's dinosaur cake very well and was easy to work with.

Giving this five stars but I did make an adjustment. I made it the first time with all shortening and it was ok but had a greasy taste. I followed some other reviews and used half butter/half shortening and the taste was excellent. I also added extra vanilla just due to personal preference.  It piped onto cupcakes beautifully too.

I really hate to rate a recipe low, but I really feel that I must here. I absolutely ADORE bakery buttercream frosting! It is my favorite sweet indulgence. I’m always the odd duck out when people ask, “Don’t you think it’s too sweet?!” I always answer a resounding, “NO!” So, I can’t believe I’m going to write this, but this frosting is too sweet! I thought this was similar to another recipe I had made from this web site before, but it wasn’t. I’m not a decorator

I made my cakes the night before so they were cool and ready the next morning to decorate. This buttercream is so, so thick! as I tried to spread it on my cake, it just tore it apart and the icing wouldnt stick to my cake. This would be good for decorating, but forget spreading it onto your cake before thinning it out. Now I'm trying to salvage my son's birthday cake!

It turned out amazing! I did it exactly as written, and it turned out beautifully. I used it for a friend's birthday cake, and everyone loved it. The recipe makes a lot; I had enough for a layer of icing in the middle of the cake, to cover the whole outside of the cake, to draw decorations on it, and still had a little left over which a couple people just scooped out of the bowl and ate by itself even. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future, probably a lot.

Really liked this frosting, not to sweet and good texture.  I did half butter half Crisco which came out fine,  I did it with all butter.  Either way I think this is a pretty fool proof recipe, but liked the all butter flavor more.

To be honest I rarely write a review. I made this to frost a large a large 4 layer cake for my sons birthday. It turned out great (though I was add slightly less of the heavy cream next time around as it ended up just a tad too soft.) I added 18 crushed Oreos to about a third of the frosting to put between the layers of the cake. Best decision I could have made! It took the cake to a whole other level!!

I have used this recipe for over 25 years. It is delicious; I almost always use it when making wedding cakes.

The only problem I have is that the consistency is soft. It's lovely for icing the cake, and I've been able to pipe borders with it, but it doesn't hold up to making roses.

I am making a wedding cake later this month. I think I'll try the substitution of part butter and see if that gives the frosting a bit more structure.

It was ok. I put an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract.  And used 3 more oz of cream. I don't think I'll make this recipe again. Just not exactly what I was looking for, but not bad.

This frosting is amazing! Like others I use half butter half shortening. I also pipe a little of the frosting into the middle of the cupcake to fill them. The key is shipping it really well. Deliciously fluffy! I get raving reviews. Thank you!

I followed some other users' suggestions and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter-flavored shortening, and I also used 1 less cup of powdered sugar.  Flavor and spreadability were great!  If using for piping, the heat of your hands does cause the frosting to get too runny after a while, I just popped it back in the fridge for 10 min. or so before starting again.

Amazingly delicious and great to work with (can frost base immediately, but refrigerate first before making flowers, etc.), as written and that's what my rating is based on. But, I have made it using coconut oil margarine (homemade from a popular website), and it's even wonderful that way, with a hint of coconut flavoring. Point is, this is great, even if you want to tweak with some of your own flavors.

I just recently made this frosting for my granddaughter's first birthday and it came out amazing and delicious. I used no salt butter  for the shortening and added about 1/2 cup more of confectioners sugar to make it a little bit more stiff. I did one recipe to generously frost 34 cupcakes and still had about 3 cups of leftover frostings. I will use it to top my banana cake. From now on, this will be my go to frosting.Thank you for the delicious recipe.

I made this exactly as written. I thought it is an excellent recipe. My first time making icing. This is a keeper. I almost regret not adding food color just to make it extra special.

Loved this frosting. I will add that I'm glad I took advise and cut it by half. It will still a lot more frosting than I could use for 24 cupcakes. Next time I'll only need about a 3rd of what recipe calls for. But definitely my new go to frosting!! I used half butter and shortening. Not super sweet. Reminds me of frosting from a really great bakery. Glad I took a chance. Thanks

Perfect for piping decorations and the taste and consistency is perfect!

Update. I noticed that I didn't mention that I used all butter for this recipe. I have never used veg. shortening to make this but for certain if anyone is wonder this recipe works great with all butter and holds its shape for piping.

I substituted butter for a portion of the shortening as some reviewers suggested. Followed the recipe. It was fine and held up till I added the heavy cream. I did not add the entire amount shown in the recipe and still it became droopy. Not sure where I went wrong as many raved about it. May try it again without the heavy cream.

Lovely light, creamy frosting. Recommendations: (1) Substitute all or a large part of the shortening for butter for icing the cake, but keep the shortening ratio high for piped decorations. This will help them maintain form. (2) Add 2 teaspoons butter or other flavor. This helps with the strong powdered sugar taste. (3) Alternate adding powdered sugar and cream. Otherwise you end up with a thick sugar dough that threatens to burn out the motor on your mixer.

I liked it but it wasn't as good as the kind from the bakery. But I followed the recipe exactly this first time so now I can make my own little variations based on what I didn't like. I'm thinking no shortening, I'm going to use real un-salted butter, and only 5 cups confectioners sugar, and real vanilla instead of imitation. 
But before you decide not to try out this recipe at all, you should know my husband and his buddies thought it was great and ate the whole cake that night!

I use half butter and half butter-flavored crisco. Absolutely delicious. Cut recipe in half and that was plenty to frost and fill a layer cake.

I made this exactly as written. My mom and son both did not like it at all. I was ok with it but I think using all crisco gave it a kind of greasy taste. I will probably try the recipe again using part butter.

just made this for a chocolate sponge cake. came out a little thick, and wouldn't work in my decorating supplies. on a side note, I made a 1/4 scale recipe, and added a teaspoon of cocoa powder, and it came out excellent, just thick. would recommend adding additional cream, or heat it slightly.

I made this substituting one cup of butter for the shortening, decreased the cream to 4 ounces, and only used 4 cups of powdered sugar. The flavor was excellent but I think if I’d used all the sugar the recipe calls for it would’ve been way too sweet. Still, my family raves over it and said it was their favorite frosting I’ve ever made!

I love this recipe and will be using it in the future. Nice thickness and holds its shape. Frosting started to get a tiny bit soft after I frosted about the 80th mini bundt cake (for work in buffet) but it still held its edges. I will be big watching this and putting it in my mental recipe book. I did not add color to it at this time, but cant wait to the next time I make it!

Please never use clear imitation vanilla extract.  It's a chemical mixture made in a lab.  Spend the extra money and get REAL vanilla extract.  You will taste the difference.  And skip the shortening while you're at it.  Use REAL butter.  Who makes buttercream with shortening?  C'mon folks....

It made a lot more than I expected, but that's great because now we have some for my next batch! It's really sweet and it's one of those types of frosting that have to be paired with something to taste the best (eating it plain isn't as amazing). I added a bit of extra heavy whipping cream and it was definitely a good move. I'd say that I would use this recipe again in the future.

I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening. I really liked it but I am gonna try it with the 2 cups of butter and see what I like better. and maybe change the flavoring. It didn't pipe as well as I thought it would. not sure why  ..

I used one cup of shortening and one cup of butter, and it was still way too greasy.  I started over with two cups of butter, and it was so soft it was impossible to shape, but at least it tasted good.

This recipe seemed to have too much shortening so we used 3/4 of the shortening recommended and added 1/2 cup butter instead. While mixing we noticed it was still heavy so we added 2 more oz of cream. The frosting was still too thick to use piping bag. The flavor, however; lacked greatly. It had a strong Crisco aftertaste. We added two more teaspoons of vanilla for flavor. It helped a little, but the Crisco taste was still there. I would not recommend this recipe.

When heavy whipping cream is whipped long enough, it turns to butter, so, Monique Andrews, technically it does have butter in it. So did you even make the recipe so you could give it an honest review? Or did you simply leave a snide comment? It's nice to be able to read real reviews from people who have taken the time to actually make the recipe and leave an honest, experienced review. That being said, I was nervous to make this by just adding the whipping cream to the previous ingredients, as my experience has taught me that heavy whipping does not form soft peaks if there is any sort of shortening, oil, or grease involved. However, I still made it as written. I'm guessing that the whipping cream worked more like milk does in your basic buttercream recipes rather than actually creating any sort of whipped cream within the frosting. But it doesn't really matter, because the frosting turned out absolutely wonderful. I may try to whip the heavy whipping cream separately and by itself next time, and then fold it into the rest of the recipe, just to see if it makes any difference - better or worse. But all in all, this was a great recipe, thank you!

Perfect density. I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla. It was delicious frosted my cake beautifully. There was more than enough for one cake - mine was 3 layers!

This is so good. I would not hesitate to use this again. One note though it makes a huge batch but I have frozen what I did not use. I checked on line it apparently it freezes well.

Very good!  I followed the recipe with two exceptions, replacing the shortening with butter and using real vanilla extract.  It was delicious and easy to use for frosting and decorating.  It makes a large amount - enough to frost and decorate a double layer cake.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this with organic butter and REAL Vanilla extract.  Why on earth would anyone use imitation extract?  Do you know where it comes from?  Look it up!  The anal glands of beavers!  Honest!

Fantastic recipe!!! I followed the advice of several other reviews and used half unsalted butter and half shortening (after making a small batch as the recipe is written, very good, but I liked the extra flavor the butter added!). I even ran out of unsalted butter when I was on the last of multiple batches, so I used salted and omitted the salt from the recipe. That turned out great also. Love the texture and flavor, it worked really well for a wedding cake I made. Lots of compliments on the frosting, and I even got a request to use it again for my dad’s birthday cake coming up. Thank you!

I've made this twice and really like it.  Fluffy and light - not overly rich or sweet.  I don't think of it as buttercream, since there's no butter, but I still thought it tasted great just as is with the shortening.  I just used regular Vanilla rather than clear extract, and it still was white and looked great for the clouds I did on one cake  I used it to pipe on cupcakes and edges of a layer round cake, and it worked equally as well for filling between the layers and  to spread it on the cake.  I think it would be great for sugar cookies too

This frosting is the bomb!!! I used it to frost cinnamon rolls. I followed the recipe which is perfect, the only addition I made was to add 1tsp of cinnamon to top off the cinnamon rolls. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this on a chocolate bunt cake. The flavor was wonderful!! The only thing I didn't like was that after being on the cake for a day it began to get kinda greasy. I followed the recipe exactly. This was my first time at making frosting so I don't know enough about frosting's to keep this from happening. Or how to change the recipe up and use something else. I will keep looking for another recipe but this one does have a great flavor!!

This is hands down the BEST buttercream frosting recipe!!  I did use 1 1/2 cups Crisco and a 1/2 cup butter.....after all it IS a buttercream recipe. Will never use another recipe again.  You will most likely have extra frosting, which is perfect to dip strawberries in.

1. Cut the recipe in half, and only used half of the sugar.
2. Use 3/4  of it as white frosting on top of the chocolate cake, add 1/2 TBSP coca powder to the left of 1/4 for the wording of the cake
3. The frosting is pretty good, but I'm not sure if the sugar I used is not good, will try different sugar next time

This holds up really well for decorating. I did make some changes. I did 1cup shortening and 1 cup butter, instead of 2 cups shortening. I also used a little less powdered sugar and an extra tablespoon of heavy cream. I strongly dislike super sweet frosting, so I tried to make some adjustments and still get it to hold together. Overall, I would make it again. The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

This recipe is awesome. The frosting is the perfect consistency for piping and spreading. It tastes amazing (except mine tasted a little bit salty, but I think that was my fault). I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone and this recipe goes amazing with this white cake: https://goo.gl/GNlMvR

It's a great recipe! I however will not let shorting into my house it's terrible stuff. So I just use real butter and it tastes just awesome without all the trans fat.

It is the first time I make buttercream frosting so I give this recipe the benefit of the doubt. I did only half of the recipe and I replaced 1/4 of crisco for salted butter and didn't add any salt. Everything else was as directed.
It didn't turn out overly sweet as others had said, the texture was great for decorating a cake, the taste was good but it was greasy....maybe next time I will replace with  1/2 butter instead of 1/4.

I didn't have shortening so I made it with butter. It was a nice pale yellow which worked well on the banana cake and had a great flavour!

Made for a baby shower and turned out perfect following recipe exactly, except for extract flavor (1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp coconut & almond). My mom made cakes for a living for many years and that was her "secret" to perfect icing. I also used butter flavored shortening because I was coloring the icing and did not need it white. Light, fluffy and smooth!!!

I have made this recipe twice. This first time  i made it as written. It was good but nothing special. The second time I used 1/2 butter half shortening and it was perfect.  I beat the butter shortening for 5+ minutes until it was light and fluffy. then i added the powder sugar and beat that for another 5 minutes. finally i slowly added the heavy cream to the right consistency . Turn the mixer on high and let it go for at least another 5 minutes.

This was a great recipe.  I used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup butter and it was delicious.  Made a white cake mix that I doctored up to be a very dense cake - like wedding cake.  This makes a lot of frosting so I froze half.  Freezes well.  Definitely will make this again!

It was wonderful with my chocolate cupcakes. I split it in half and used purple and pink food coloring to make pastel frosting. The purple I made regularly, but in the pink instead of using vanilla extract I decided to try something and use peppermint extract. I really liked them but unfortunately no one else did. The vanilla was a hit though.

A wonderful buttercream frosting!  I made half a batch as I was using a thin layer of this for a wedding cake to be covered in fondant.  This had a wonderful taste and I can't wait to make it again.  The only thing I did was to replace a small amount of the shortening with butter as I had run out of shortening.  It turned out great.

This is absolutely delicious frosting.  I made 2 batches (which is way more frosting than I needed for my cake).  The first time, I followed the directions exactly, using only shortening.  Then, when I got done, I started reading the reviews about replacing half the shortening with butter.   That sounded better to me, so I went back to the store, and re-bought my ingredients.  I did 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and made my family do a taste test.   We all agreed that the one with butter was the best.  It has a slightly different (more buttery) flavor, and it is not as greasy as the all shortening batch.  However, both are very good, so I don't think that you can go wrong either way.  I ended up icing my entire almond cake with the butter frosting, and using the all shortening frosting to pipe flowers onto it.  The consistency of both was great.  I highly recommend this recipe.

If it's buttercream frosting, butter is a necessity, so I added it.  I used 1 stick of butter and 1 1/2 cups shortening.  The frosting was delicious and easy to work with.

Will definitely make this again! I did replace 1/4 cup of shortening with butter, just to give it a slightly buttery taste, but I don't think it was necessary.  I've always found buttercream icing made only with butter was too rich (even my sugar loving kids think so), and this was MUCH better!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It turned out wonderfully. I actually didn't get around to reading the reviews until after I was all ready finished with my project. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers make sure to cream the shortening exceptionally well and when you add the other ingredients before the heavy cream make sure it's throughly mixed. Then after you add the heavy cream whip until it's nice and fluffy. I will definitely be making this frosting again.

This was so easy to make and held up very well for piping even after it was warm from my hands. I made 1/2 a batch since I just wanted it for bordering a cake and only used 2 cups of sugar so it wasn't overly sweet. Since the sugar was cut I also cut the cream and it came out perfect. I will use this from now on when I need to decorate a cake or cupcakes

There was way too much salt in this. It turned out incredibly salty.

I love this frosting!!! Hard to spread but pipes great. I made half a batch using 3/4 Crisco and 1/4 cup real unsalted butter.  I also used almond extract but you could use any kind to give it a different flavor.  It makes a lot of frosting. I would recommend doing half because it's easy to make more if you need it.

The frosting tasted like crisco, as many reviewers had said. Also the recipe will make a lot of frosting so be aware.

Amazing! I used one cup of shortening and one cup of butter to make it an actual buttercream... I added a touch of peppermint extract and it was so light and fluffy with the whipping cream! this is just what I was looking for! I will use this recipe from now on! the second time I made it, I used 1/2 c shortening, 1/2 c butter and 8oz cream cheese. It was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. I would NOT use only shortening - that's just not right to call it buttercream...

Tried half shortening, half butter. Excellent! Is a little soft - can't stack decorated sugar cookies, but I froze them in a single layer, then stacked in one container. Ready to pull out of freezer on Xmas eve.

I've made this a few times now, tweaking it a bit each time. The recipe is great, you can make it exactly as written, and rest assured you will have a great frosting for your cake. But I think substituting butter for the shortening was even better with a much richer flavour. I also tried cutting back on the icing sugar as well which was excellent as it produced a less sweet more buttery frosting. The best part about this recipe is how it can be tweaked to your individual tastes and still turn out to be a frosting that is delicious and easy to decorate with

Great tasting. Simple to make. Easy to adjust measurements. My guests couldn't decide which they loved more, the cake or the frosting! This is my new favorite recipe. (One change, I used all butter...I couldn't envision it any other way. )

This is IT! I've finally found the perfect buttercream frosting! I'm not a pro; I'm a home baker and I have tried multiple buttercream frostings for homemade cakes and cupcakes. None of the recipes have ever been quite right until this one! The consistency was perfect, even after adding food coloring. I'm so glad I read some previous reviews that mentioned that the recipe as-is yields a ton of frosting. I halved it and it was more than enough to generously frost 24 cupcakes. For this first batch, I used half butter and half shortening and it was awesome. I'll fiddle around with all butter and all shortening for future cakes.

I've always wanted to make  bakery-type frosting/icing and this is it. 
I made it exactly as directed but next time will use butter in place of some of the shortening as suggested by other reviewers.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is an amazing recipe.  It does make a generous amount of frosting.  I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening.  I whipped the butter for 5 or more minutes in order for the butter to turn white.  I also added one package of white chocolate hot chocolate mix just for fun. I will definitely use this recipe again and have already recommended it to friends.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe, except I subbed in some butter as others suggested.  It is creamy, buttery, not overwhelmingly sweet and holds together really well.  I have not tried adding any colouring to it, yet.

I have made this on 2 occasions now.  The first time I made it I made it with all butter instead of shortening.  I assumed making it with shortening would give your mouth that greasy coating you get with store-bought cupcakes.  All butter tasted fantastic and for applications where it is not going to be hot or you don't care about making designs then it was perfect.  This time around I made it 3/4 shortening, 1/4 butter and so far it has been great.  Seems to hold its shape better, and no greasy mouth feel.  I used pure homemade vanilla and it was pretty white, but I tinted mine both times so being pure white wasn't a concern of mine.  Be aware it makes a TON.  I have done 18 cupcakes with it already, and will be doing 3-4 dozen more this weekend.  It stores well in a covered container.  My go-to buttercream now.  Thanks!

I used 1 cup butter with 1 cup shortening, regular vanilla since I was coloring a 4-story tangerine ombre cake. It was fantastic. I didn't pipe although I did use a frosting comb. My go-to butter cream from now on. Thank you for the great recipe.

It turned out REALLY nice, BUUUUUUT, THERE WAS WAAAAAAY too much confectioners sugar.  I ended up cutting the recipe in half. Ok. Fine. Then I added a half cup of confectioners sugar (icing sugar) and slowly started mixing and blending. Oh my goodness! What a workout! It was brutal trying to mix this. I ended up only putting in 2.5 cups of confectioners sugar, instead of 4, because I just couldn't stir it anymore. It was WAY too hard to stir. I also had to add 3 tablespoons of 10% cream (I didn't have "heavy" or whipping cream so I used what was on hand) and that made it the PERFECT consistency. 

Yeah, to be honest, WAY too much confectioners sugar. And mine turned out to be the perfect sweetness.

I didn't change anything but the frosting was still a little soft and also a little too sweet for me. Made Angel Food Cake with strawberry filling and fresh berries(filling also from Allrecipes) with this frosting. Nice combo.

I used this recipe exactly as it was for my cousin's hot August outdoor wedding.  I made a three-tier wedding cake and tinted the buttercream for her cake.  It turned out fantastic.  I made it three days before her wedding and stored it tightly in containers for travel.  I frosted her cake the day of and put the cake parts back in the fridge in between...then added my gumpaste flowers.  It held up nicely in the hot August heat and of course, the most important part...it tasted delicious!  Everyone who ate it said it tasted like the professional bakers' secret recipes!  The key....let the mixer do all your work and walk away.  I let the shortening "fluff" for about 10 minutes and I let it fluff for a long time after each addition.

I only modified slightly by swapping a half cup of the shortening for a half cup of unsalted butter, and just dumping a full bag of powdered sugar (bag says approximately 7 1/2 cups), rather than measuring out the 8 cups that the recipe calls for. Used it on my Easter Lamb Cake, 2015! Will use for everything!!! Lamb: I canola oiled my lamb mold with a paper towel, crisco'ed, floured with a sifter until NO bare spots, and chilled the pans in the freezer. Once the batter was ready, I filled him face down, to just under the rolled edge of the pan, and carefully used a spatula to fill the ears. I added a couple of toothpicks, laid across his ears, and a "cake pop" bamboo stick from his head to his neck (like making a letter T) to add structural support. I tied him tightly together with baking twine, and placed him on a cookie sheet for baking. My aluminum lamb mold only has one steam vent, am going to add one. It was hard to tell when he was done with only one whole to poke a straw into.  Laid him face down, steam vent side up, to cool. Cooled for 15 minutes, then took off the back "butt" side of the mold.  Cooled for another hour and a half, cut all around the edge with a sharp knife, and carefully took his face side out of the other half of the mold. Cut the bottom ridge of his belly off, so he would sit flat, brushed off his loose crumbs, frosted my cake plate for an adhesive, slathered him up with a solid coat of white, then added thin squiggles. No face. :) Picture added.

Even following the suggestions of others - 1 1/2 shortening to 1/2 butter - I found this frosting to be rather greasy and soft, rather than buttery and capable of hcading a design.  Not very good at all.

If you are looking for bakery like frosting, this is it!! Per other reviews I substituted half the shortening for butter. Frosting is delicious, tastes like the birthday cakes from childhood! Very easy to work with, even for self taught decorators like myself.

Tasty! I used almond extract instead if vanilla to compliment my cherry chip cupcakes. Yum! I halved the recipe and used half butter and half shortening. It was a tad.... Melty. I might add just a smidge more sugar and less half and half next time. (I had to sub half and half for the heavy cream. That might have been my problem.)

I did half butter half Crisco like some other reviews said and it turned out perfect! A great frosting for piping and decorating cake.

This recipe turned out pretty good. I did, however, use real vanilla and butter instead of the imitation stuff. Turned out great. When I made it, I halved the recipe to frost a double layer 9-inch cake, and still had enough to decorate it. This is a great multi-use icing, and I would definitely make it again

I made this with butter (in place of shortening) and heavy cream. Half and half also works just as well. This is hands down the best frosting recipe ever! I quartered the recipe (using 1 stick of butter, etc), to make just enough for one 13x9 cake (not much for tasting, however), and added 3 tablespoons of regular Hershey cocoa (it would be 12 tablespoons if you make the original quantity) for a chocolate version. My husband doesn't have a sweet tooth, but even he commented on how delicious this frosting was! Thanks for sharing, Rick!

When I took over the frosting making in my family, I was 12. I had watched my mum and all the neighbor ladies make it and did'nt know what the big deal was all about! Of course there were no measurements except for "2lg scoops of Crisco or "fluffo" beat it until it looks fluffy - then start sprinkling in some confec sugar then a little milk -more sugar, more milk until the box (1lb,) was empty. Now 2shakes of salt and 1-2caps (from tha vanilla bottle) of pure vanilla,and finally beat it some more. Choc frosting was made the same way except 2-3Tbsps of cocoa powder was added. Try this recipe as is, and add vanilla or choc. as you like. Thanks for the memories! (This was enough to frost the middle, top and sides of a 8-9in layer cake)

This made frosting for decorating 36 cup cakes it held up well. I just think buttercream has come a long way from the crisco buttercream days and I just can't see this on a cake.

This is my go-to frosting, I love it! It's very simple, but delicious, and complements a wide-range of sweets from dark chocolate cake to pumpkin ginger cupcakes. I made a few alterations to the recipe - I use 9 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup whipping cream. This just works a little bit better for my needs and taste, but to each his/her own! Thanks for sharing!

I followed some suggestions and used 1/2 c. butter with 1 1/2 c. shortening. I probably could have added another cup of powdered sugar to make it a bit stiffer, but that's just being nit picky. I made the full recipe and it was more than plenty to ice a two layer nine inch round cake.

I'm a frosting fanatic--could skip the cake and just eat the frosting. I made this twice, once using half butter, the second time using 3/4 butter to 1/4 shortening. Both times, it came out terrific. I think it's a matter of personal taste, but something about the shortening definitely gives it that bakery flavor. I used real vanilla, and it didn't negatively impact the color of the frosting while significantly adding to the taste. Finally, the heavy cream gives it a wonderful texture. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty buttercream. I used half unsalted butter and half vegetable shortening. Wonderful smooth texture and held frosting color great. Consistency was a little looser than I like, but that was fixed by a tad bit more powdered sugar. Overall, this recipe is very yummy, will make again.

Well I did everything to the T and I just didn't like it. You could really taste the shortening leaving a thick oily film in your mouth. It was fluffy, however it was very low on flavor.

Delicious!  I have another frosting recipe that I normally use, but after reading all of the reviews for this one, I had to try it.  I am so glad I did - it mixes up beautifully and the texture is perfect.  If anything though, I may try all butter next time, since this is a buttercream... and I generally prefer to use butter instead of shortening if I can help it.  As is, this is a great recipe - I will definitely post an update if I try it again with the butter!

This may just be my go-to frosting for cake decorating from now on.  It was so easy to make and was delicious.  I'm not a big fan of super sugary frostings but this one wasn't too bad.  Besides, I use it for kids' cakes and they love the sugar.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully white and fluffy.  Perfect consistency for decorating.  I hate shortening and the greasy feel, but based on the good reviews I gave this recipe a shot.  It came out great!  No greasiness at all!  The secret is to really beat the shortening well first, and then beat again after adding the cream.  And folks who commented how this doesn't have butter in it...well, it has heavy cream, and you beat that long enough...you get butter!  Thanks for sharing!

this is delicious!!  I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup shortening.  I also add 2 tsp almond extract, but that is just because I like almost extract.  I have used this 3 times for rather large cakes I decorated, and I had enough icing to spare.  If you are going to be using this for decorating/piping, I recommend not using more than 1/2 cup of butter.  Great recipe!

I'm a beginner at baking.  I made it for my little girls 2nd birthday cupcakes.  This was super easy and everybody raved about how good it was!  I did tweak it a bit.  1/2 shortening 1/2 butter and 2/3 heavy cream and 1/3 sweetened condensed milk.  I just made it for a second time for my big daughter's 7th birthday.  I'll let you know how people like it.

This is actually quite good and super easy,  I actually use Mexican Vanilla that I order online and it is my secret ingredient for all my baking. It truly makes all the difference to use quality vanilla extract.

Don't even think of trying another frosting recipe--this one is perfect!  Thanks to the hint of other reviewers I used half real butter and half shortening, and I think it's the addition of cream that makes this frosting tops.  This frosting handles beautifully, takes like a dream.  It DOES make a boatload, but it can be covered in an airtight container and the remainder used in a couple of days.  You won't want to waste this. I received tons of compliments on this and when paired with my favorite cakes, well just let me say, happiness abounds. The addition of butter and the use of real vanilla extract brings this from a bright white to an antique white color, but I much prefer the flavor.

Incredible! This is now my (and my family's) favorite buttercream frosting. I followed the video's possible substitution of 1 cup of butter for 1 of the cups of shortening and the flavor is amazing.

Well first off this recipe makes a LOT of frosting. Could make half of it to cover a normal cake. Second I had a bunch of issues with mixing the sugar and shortening together until "well blended". What a disaster. It was so hard and dry, so I just added the heavy cream before the sugar was blended and it turned out just great. This is the type of frosting that needs to sit a day to really enjoy the flavor. I love this recipe and plan on using it often....but hopefully no more disasters in the kitchen! lol

This is a great frosting, but do I need to refrigerate my cake now?  I have never made a frosting with milk before and dont want my cake to dry out in the fridge before serving, but also dont want my guests to get sick if the frosting needs refrigerating.

I gave my sister a surprise birthday party tonight and used the scratch strawberry cake recipe from allrecipes.com made in a 12 inch pan and this frosting recipe tinted pink. I used a French Vanilla cake too and cut the layer in half. I frosted the top of the vanilla layer, added some heavy whipped cream and sliced strawberries, then stacked the strawberry cake on this and repeated the frosting step. Topped the cake with the other vanilla layer and frosted the top and sides. It was sort of like a strawberry shortcake taste. The family raved about it. I've been doing cakes off and on for about 38 years and love doing them. I'll make a wedding cake for my youngest daughter's wedding reception next week-end. I love this frosting recipe.

I just made this to use on my mom's birthday cake and it was SO easy and tastes SO good! I followed the recipe (although I halved it) and it wasn't greasy and just perfectly sweet. I am saving this one for sure! I can't wait to try it with different flavour extracts! Thank you!

Fantastic! Not only was it the best tasting, but it was the best icing I have ever used to top cupcakes! The only change I made was using 3 cups of the sugar because that was plenty sweet enough for me lol. This one is in my recipe box and my go-to cake decor icing.

I give this a 2 stars only because it didn't really work on the cupcakes that I was making...which I think is actually my fault. I did use as suggested the 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortening and actually doubled the recipe, however it still turned out quite greasy. I also didn't add enough icing sugar (which was needed because I was making cupcakes for my 3 years pre-school class hence they were not sweet enough). Had I been baking a cake and needed to ice it or create borders, this icing would have been perfect, but I did not find it to be a good  cupcake topping. I was actually quite disjointed, but since I am not a baker, I lived and learned.

I just finished making this frosting. Literally, I am taking a break from washing out my mixing bowl to write this review. This is amazing! It is so creamy and fluffy and definitely not too sweet. I substituted 1/2 cup of butter and used shortening for the rest. I only had 1/2 tsp of clear vanilla left so I used it and 2 tsp of clear butter extract left and it is delicious! I can't wait to frost my daughter's birthday cake!

GREAT recipe that everyone will love! I substituted the shortening for butter and added a few tablespoons of cream cheese. This recipe was to die for!

I love this recipe!!! I have been decorating cakes for a while now and any other decorator knows how hard it is to find a dependable frosting. I do however ad a tad more heavy cream and the tiniest bit of milk to make it a little less firm. It comes out perfect every time!!  And it tastes amazing! It even holds up to humidity and you need that living in wisconsin!!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Very good recipe.  Nice and smooth presentation on a cake.  Recipe also makes a lot which is great.  One drawback is that you need to have heavy cream on hand.  I made the recipe as is the first time but found the following modifications perfect the recipe:  use 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening; use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract (cannot imagine buttercream without the almond extract, makes the recipe pop); and use no more than 6 oz of the cream for medium to thin consistency icing (the whole 8 oz was just too much, can't imagine anytime I would need to add that much).

Absolutely a great recipe!  I did use butter instead of shortening and added a tad more cream, but really, you need look no further for a buttercream recipe!

Ok, I, too balked at the shortening in the recipe but after reading others' review, I decided to use half butter and half shortening.  It turned out awesome!  The frosting tasted light and fluffy (Yay! to the heavy cream!) like marshmallow cream except not as sweet.  I do like the clear vanilla extract because it's really a bright white so when I'm ready to color the frosting, I'm guaranteed a pure hue.  Thanks so much for the recipe......love it!!

This frosting was the BEST frosting I ever made!  I made this frosting for my daughter's birthday party.  I gave each guest thier own little pastry bag full and put some differnt sprinkles on the table and let them deocorate cupcakes for themselves.  The 8 year olds asked if they could have the recipe because it was the best thing they'd ever tasted!!  I agree!  I followed the recipe to the T, and it came out perfect!

Just made this frosting...i made a half batch and it was plenty to fill and crumb coat a 3 layer 8" cake with some left over. As previous reviews suggested I used half shortening and half butter (i always make buttercream with just butter).   As a variation I used a 1/4 whipping cream and about 3-4 tablespoons Khalua to add a different flavour. it was very light and fluffy...but VERY sweet. I generally like sweet frostings but I found this a bit sweet still. Tastes very similar to "grocery store frostings" as many others said.

I followed this recipe to frost my mom's birthday cake and I was worried it might turn out greasy. (She only gets the best!) It was better than I expected.  It's soft, fluffy, great for decorating and has a great flavor!  This is the first time I've made a buttercream frosting with cream and I was really impressed.  Usually she doesn't take all the cake home.. but she did this time.  I might use this to make an upcoming wedding cake for my sister.

Holy smokes- this is exactly like bakery frosting.  I cut the recipe in half for a 9x13, and used 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C. shortening.  I have searched and searched for an easy bakery frosting, and am so glad to finally have found it.  Thank you!

This was awesome.  I did something that probably not many of you have done and I used these on Clone of a Cinnabon from this site.  I used less sugar though, as the buns are pretty sugary already but everything else was the same.  I did not find this too greasy as it was, and neither did anyone else that tried these.  I gave some to my husband to try before I coated the rolls with them and he gave me that "This is really good stuff" look.  Also, I usually never do it, but i found myself trying the icing quite a bit, you know, to make sure its ok ;) lol.  It's those kinds of things that make you realize you found a winner of a recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

i made this with half shortening and half butter like many had suggested and the taste was great! i just had a hard time using it with any decorating tips. i could only use it for making straight piping lines and letters. it hardens really well without being too hard. i will be using this again for sure :)

Good frosting. The closest to bakery frosting that I have made. Husband likes this frosting. I experimented and added cocoa powder. It was okay but a little dry so I added peanut butter. Really good! Also I divided the recipe in half because it makes so much. For a single layer cake this amount works best.

This has been my "secret" recipe for years. Everyone else I know uses the Wilton recipe or fondant these days. I always get great compliments for my frosting. I have no problem making borders, roses, and other simple decorations with it. Sometimes you might need to stiffen it up a little with a little added powdered sugar for the roses.

I've made powdered sugar icing before and it's always turned out too thin and transparent. So, I had my doubts that this would turn out anything like what I'd seen in the pictures. I'm very glad to say that I couldn't have been more wrong. This was amazing. I made it exactly like the recipe calls for and used it to frost over 6 dozen sugar cookies, plus had enough to decorate them. My kids kept trying to eat it out of the bowls and piping bags! I will definately use this as my primary icing recipe. No more store bought icing in our house!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. This stuff is to die for! I am so grateful to have come across it, I've been searching for that perfect buttercream and I have found it! It is a tad salty for some reason but otherwise, perfect.

My new favorite frosting!  Easy and delicous.  I used 1 cup butter flavor crisco and 1 cup butter.  I used leftover frosting to make my own "oreos" - a great creamy center to 2 cookies sandwiched together. Awesome!

Perfect, delicious, and easy! I've been making buttercream for years but decided to look up a new recipe (because everything I find on here is SO good). This recipe is fantastic. The heavy creamy really makes a difference. It's easy to spread and sets nicely. This recipe was enough to frost a two-layer cake and still had enough to frost a few cupcakes. I just don't understand why people buy frosting in cans when the homemade is so easy and delicious!

I am NOT a cake decorator, I'm just looking for a great tasting, easy to use frosting so I can "pretend" I'm a decorator when I bust out my tools.  I used half butter, half shortening and next time I think I'll use 3/4 butter and 1/4 shortening.  I like the real butter flavor, but I know the shortening has better consistency.  I did not add the salt since I used salted butter.  I did not have heavy cream so I used half n half; it worked fine, but like I said, I'm NOT a cake decorator.

This recipe makes a ton of frosting and is perfect for decorating since it holds it's shape.  I only made a small change, I added about 2 tsp of almond extract.  It gives it a richer flavor.  I also added about 1/4 extra of cream to make it less "oily" tasting.  Otherwise it's a fantastic decorating frosting recipe with a rich creamy flavor and texture.

FANTASTIC!  Wonderful basic recipe.  I doubled it to frost a 9" round layer cake and had some left over. Used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter for a richer flavor.  Also, because I was using this to frost the Lemon Chiffon Cake from this site, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract instead of vanilla.

I've been looking for a new buttercream for awhile and I just love this one.  I followed the suggestion of others and use half butter and half shortening and just whip it for at least 15 mins.  It turns out great everytime and has a great flavor and consistency.

I really enjoyed this frosting and will definitely make it again with a few modifications.  I wished that I had followed some of the other reviewer's advice and used at least some butter instead of all shortening, but I was in a hurry and my shortening was soft (and the butter wasn't).  I used more powdered sugar than the recipe called for and was glad I halved the recipe as some suggested for frosting a regular 2 layer 8" or 9" round cake.  It spread wonderfully.  Next time, I'll try to pipe with it! **Update** I have made this frosting a few times.  Most recently, I made it with butter. Following the recipe porportions exactly, it tastes a little oily, but I kept adding about a quarter cup of powdered sugar and then a tablespoon of cream (or milk) until I had the consistency I wanted and the frosting lost the oily flavor. My husband and I couldn't stop licking the bowl!  This is my go to buttercream recipe!

This frosting recipe is wonderful!  I've used it lots of times with decorated cakes and cupcakes and usually use the recommended 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and since I usually buy butter flavored shortening, thats what I use.  The perfect buttercream frosting!

Held its shape really good. Made an Easter Basket Weave Cake. ***UPDATE*** Used this to frost my husband's 43rd B-Day Crazy Cake. I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and the taste was much better than before. It had a sweeter and less Crisco taste. I'm not a big fan of buttercream but this was still good.

This is a really great recipe. I don't even like buttercream frosting and this was just too good. I received ALOT of compliments on this one. This is perfect for frosting a cake. Not so great for decorating edges but if you omit the butter and add butter flavoring like others have suggested then you get a 'stiffer' frosting. I will save this one for sure!!!

This turned out beautifully.  Colors well, easy to make and work with, not too sweet.  Yum.  I modified the recipe to use 1/2 Crisco and 1/2 butter, and left out one cup of the powdered sugar.  I also added extra vanilla, but that was by accident.  This makes a LOT of frosting.  Enough for 3 boxes of store-bought cake mix.  Next time, I'll cut it in half.

THIS RECIPE IS WONDERFUL!!  I read the other reviews and used 1 1/2 cups shortening and 1/2 cup salted butter and about 6 cups powdered sugar and beat my mixture until it was really, really fluffy, and I agree with other viewers who wrote previously that this recipe is truly lickable!!  It almost didn't make it to the cake I wanted to frost; my family kept coming in and sneaking "swipes".  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!!

Great recipe!! I did only make half of the recipe, because it was just for an everyday cake. I can see making the whole batch for borders, designs, etc. Will be using again, maybe with a little color.

I took the advice from some reviewers and used half shortening and half butter. Everyone loved it! Easy to make and tasted great.

Great Frosting ! Try adding real vanilla bean (dried or fresh) instead of the extract. For those that like more than just a "sugar" flavor, this will be the ultimate real vanilla frosting then. The vanilla "dots" did bother me - very small.

On the up side, it took coloring fantastically!  I was making a ladybug cake and it actually came out red and black.  I don't know if it's just too big of a batch...  I couldn't fit it in the bowl for my stand mixer, and my hand mixer started smoking.  Maybe I should have added more cream, but it was a dry, dusty, smoking mess!  I may try it again and only make half at a time to go a little easier on my mixers.  It tasted fine, no compliments, no complaints.

I am giving this recipe a 5 because I loved the taste. Even tough it left a greasy feeling on the lips. I did half the recipe to frost an 8 inch, 2 layer cake. I used 1 cup of butter flavored shortening. The taste was amazing. I might follow some suggestions about using butter next time. Anyhow, my family loved the taste of the frosting.. they agreed that the greasy part was "wroth it" compared to the taste.  I frosted a chocolate cake they love, and they barely payed any attention to it, They were too busy telling me the frosting was good. I like this recipe! I might tweak a few things in order to get rid of a bit of the greasy part, but other than that.. PERFECT frosting.

This was VERY good and super easy.  It sure does make a lot - I easily covered over 50 cupcakes and still had enough for another 1/2 dozen.

I used it for my 2 daughters' birthday parties and got rave reviews - people thought I bought the cupcakes from a bakery.

Enjoyed it a lot and will be referring to it again in the future.  Thank you!

I was looking for something other than frosting out of a can for my sons birthday cake. Admittedly this is the first one I tried because the ingredients could not get any easier. Well, Im glad I did because this frosting was so fluffy and easy to spread and for piping, too. It was not too greasy either. Great frosting and it definitely goes into the recipe box. Thank you!

I changed the recipe to be 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortning and I didn't have electric beaters so we did it by hand. Therefore I don't think it got as fluffy as it should have, but it was DELICIOUS! Even my best friend who usually scrapes frosting off was stealing the extras out of the fridge to put on cookies!

It's good, pretty frosting. Way better tasting than supermarket cake frosting. It does not get 5 stars though, because I am in love with the buttercream frosting from the Dutch Bakery in Victoria, Canada and I'm saving my 5 for one that tastes like that if I ever find it. This was a little too heavy and sweet to be perfect, yet it's wonderful to work with, beautiful and it is much tastier than anything store bought!

I made a last minute birthday cake for my sis today with the supplies I had in the pantry because I didn't want to go out in the rain for groceries.  I made this recipe with 2 cups Parkay, 1/2 cup regular Crisco, 2tsp vanilla, and 8 cups powdered sugar.  I was going to use milk to replace the cream but didn't even need it.  It turned out great and the taste was amazing!  It was just the right amounts of buttery flavor and sweetness.  Not too sweet.  I worked perfect for spreading and for decorating.  Everyone loved it!  I'm not much of a baker so I was very pleased with the ease of making it too.  I just used a box cake mix but with the flavor of the icing it tasted like homemade.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I did change this based on other reviews, 1 1/2 c shortening, 1/2 c butter and added 1 tsp Wilton's butter flavoring. This frosting is awsome! Great bakery flavor! Definately a keeper!

This was PERFECT! I needed a frosting that was easy to make to decorate a cake for my parent's 25th wedding anniversary party. This was a perfect consistency for decorating. I did not have shortening on hand, so I used butter as suggested by other reviews, and also halved the recipe as I only needed this for decoration. It turned out perfect and we had plenty left to lick the bowl. Another option for you cream cheese lovers- sub the shortening or butter for cream cheese and you will have the best home-made cream cheese frosting ever; just like my grandma's!

This was sooo easy to make! I followed a previous suggestion and used 1/2 salted butter, 1/2 shortening, and omitted the salt. Not only did it taste terrific, but it held up to coloring, multiple layers, and lots of moving around. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I try a different frosting recipe every time I make cake but the search is over.  Even my anti-frosting really liked it.  Just added cocoa powder to make chocolate.  I also added one tsp of butter extract.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Not overly sweet and not greasy in my mouth.

I don't usually like regular buttercream. I usually make Swiss meringue buttercream because it's lighter and not as sweet. However, this buttercream frosting is perfect! It's fluffy and not TOO too sweet. I used butter flavored shortening.

Fantastic!  However, I followed another person's suggestion , to use 1 cup of butter in place of 1 of the cups of shortening, only 6 cups of icing sugar and 1/2 cup of evaporated milk.

Frosting turned out great, just a little too greasy for my taste but no one else seemed to mind. Will use again if in a pinch and need something quick and easy. I added more powdered sugar for piping and everything was a-ok.

Extra yummy!  We made pastel colors and decorated Easter cupcakes.  I think we have more icing than cupcake - however the girls would just eat the icing off the spoon and pass on the cupcake.

I lost my Wilton recipe for buttercream...I sure am glad that I did!  I used half butter and half shortening and it was absolutely magnificent.  It made the prettiest roses and without breaking!  Since Crisco changed its recipe, all of my roses have been breaking around the edges...not with this icing!  Thanks a bunch!

Very buttery...but perfect consistancy to ice cupcakes. Put it with butter pecan cupcakes and halfed the recipe and still had icing left over. i did double the vanilla...because i do like a stronger tasting vanilla icing. Very simple and better than store bought.

This frosting was wonderful!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and halved the recipe, I only ended up using about 3.5 c of powdered sugar.  I also used 1/2 butter flavored crisco and 1/2 butter for the fat.  I whipped it for about 3 minutes on high at the end and it was amazingly light and fluffy.  Great flavor, but I think next time I make it I will increase the butter a tiny bit more.

Mm.. I made a few changes to make it a 5: used 1/4 butter and 3/4 shortening as other reviewers suggested, and i only used about 3/4 of the sugar amount stated and it was plenty sweet. I think i ended up adding more cream just because i was trying to frost the cake while it was still a little warm so i needed a softer consistency, but i'm sure i would have used less otherwise. Really good and easy!

This recipe decorates so well that you would not expect it to taste so wonderful.      It's light but firm.  I used half butter and will never use another recipe again.

Thank you.

Loved this frosting! I used half butter and half Hi-Ratio shortening, you can buy this at cake decorating supply stores, it doesn't leave any greasy aftertaste. I used 6 cups powdered sugar and a butter vanilla flavoring. This came out really smooth and was so easy to work with.

This was WAYYYY too sweet for my liking. It did however work well to decorate with as it stayed soft but kept it's shape. I would probably use this again just for decorations and not to ice the cake with as well.

I love this recipe.  I use it for every birthday cake I make.  It has a wonderful flavor and yet is thick enough to make directions.    My kids birthdays are all in the summer and I always leave the cake  in the freezer until party time though, as ti does have a tendency to melt some.

I tried this today and loved it. I did as others suggested and put 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortening, it was awesome. My husband even liked it, and he's pretty picky sometimes!  My only advice is to try not to let it get warm while you make it. I made the mistake of having the mixer sitting on top of the oven while my cake was cooking, and it softened a bit much, but was easily fixed.   This recipe made just a bit more than I needed, but my son didn't mind!

I used 1 c butter, 1 c shortening to keep a solid consistancy w/o that gross shortening flavor.  Firms up nicely; is forgiving and smoothable.

Wonderful!  I've made this twice in the last week.  First, for our neighborhood block party, where my cupcakes were a HUGE hit.  A teenage boy took the time to come over and personally compliment me on the cupcakes with the delicious frosting!  Made them again tonight for my son and his friends.  I only made one alteration - I used Butter flavored Crisco because I didn't have regular. While it didn't give me a perfect white frosting, it tastes perfect.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cups shortening and added 1 tsp of clear butter flavoring.  I did not have any clear vanilla, so I used regular and was still white enough for me.  It was a little humid the day I made it and I should have used less whipping cream as it was a little softer than I would have liked.  (I ran out of powdered sugar and didn't want to run to the store for more.)  Great taste, nice and fluffy.  I loved that I didn't have to sift all that powdered sugar too.

I've been searching for a buttercream that is creamy, not too sweet and not greasy.  This is the perfect one.  I've been baking for a long time and this is the best buttercream I've ever tasted.  It pipes well too.  I did use 1/2 butter instead of all shortening.  I like that it makes a large amount too.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful, easy recipe.

I also rated this five stars, though I followed the advice of others and did half butter, half Crisco.  It is really tasty and stiff enough for piping.  The only thing I think I'd change is maybe next time cut back a bit on the Crisco and kick up the butter.  I don't like any kind of greasy after taste in my frosting, and Crisco seems to always do that.  If you cut it back a little, I'd imagine it'd be perfect!  Yum. I'm definitely going to continue to use this.

I took most others advice and used 1 c shortening and 1 c unsalted butter.  I only used about 4-1/2 to 5 cups of sugar and just added enough heavy cream to get the right consistency.  I thought the texture was wonderful!  My fiance said that next time I should use more butter and less shortening to get more of a 'butter' taste.  Overall, good and easy.  I'll keep tweaking it till I get it perfect for our taste.  Thanks!

Pretty yummy frosting.  I halved the recipe & used half salted butter & half organic vegetable shortening.  I left out the additional salt.  I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla because I was making a coconut bunny cake for Easter.  The taste was great, not too sweet, but the texture was a little soft.  I may have to use less butter next time.  Will definitely make again.

This is good, I did half butter and less sugar (6 cups).  The texture is exquisite, it is melt in your mouth smooth and creamy.  Literally melt in your mouth.  The taste is great at first with a not so great after taste.  I am going to let it sit overnight because some of these reviews say it's better the next day.  I think with all the sugar it says to use it would be too sweet for my family, but that is a very subjective opinion.  I would make this again.

This is my new favorite frosting recipe.  It's worth the extra time; so decadent!  I used it for sugar cookies, and it was the perfect complement.

I was in a hurry to make frosting and I skipped checking out the reviews, which would have been helpful. I don't like the way the shortening tastes in the frosting. Definately cut it back a bit or half-and-half it with butter.

This frosting was ok. I used butter flavored crisco as my shortening, maybe that was a mistake. I liked the texture of the frosting, but not the flavor. It tasted a lot like crisco.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I also used real vanilla extract and once I added the cream I still had a very white forsting.  I truly enjoyed the flavor of this one I will keep this as a staple.  I am consiering maybe using half butter flavor shortening and half regular shortening I may experiment some more

Love it...I change it to be 1 cup short., 1 cup butter, 1 tsp butter flavor (clear),6 3/4 cups sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. almond...
Everytime I decorate a cake with this everyone oohs and aahhs... and it actually tastes awesome!  When it crusts (I usually put the cake in a fridge for a bit to get it to crust) you can smooth it with a Viva papertowel and it's comes out nice and smooth...thanks so much Rick...this is just wonderful!!!!!

Not quite perfect, but good.  I substituted 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavor shortening.  Otherwise, followed proportions to a T. Flavor is decent. I would agree that the shortning flavor is a little distracting in the background, but not awful. The consistency is excellent! The taste was a bit better after the cake was refrigerated a day or so. I think I'll try all butter next time because it's pretty good otherwise. Not at all gritty.

Love this frosting!  I am the baker in the family and found this recipe for my nieces frist birthday cake, she just ate the frosting and didn't want any cake!  So now when I make a cake I ask if they want Emma's frosting or my old recipe, they always request "Emma's"!!

Wonderful buttercream frosting only if you use unsalted butter and real vanilla extract (hence, the 4 stars).  I made 1/2 batch of frosting and had just enough to fill and frost a 9" layer cake, splitting both of the layers and filling.  Next time I may just cut down on the sugar so it's not as sweet.  Excellent frosting for your favorite chocolate cake.  Thanks for sharing!

Totally idiot proof.  It looks wrong when you get done whipping in the sugar with the shortening but it comes out perfectly - you just have to trust it.  So good.  I did half the recipe and had more than enough to do a whole two layer cake - including the filling - with some left over.  I recomend it!

I made this recipw using butter instead of shortening and Splenda that had been run through a food processor to make it sugar-free and it worked wonderfully. I had to run it for a while in the mixer to get the texture right, but i think that was because of the Splenda. Vey yummy!
