I took it to a party as a Mexican side dish, but everyone thought it was a dip for tortillas! They loved it!

I scaled this to half as there was only four of us....it still made a ton!  This is a great 'make once eat twice' meal.  Great as a taco salad!

I had to tone down some of the spice for my daughter who has reflux. It was tasty to her and happy to have another recipe she can enjoy. Next time I would use more of the taco packet than I did to make it for her.
