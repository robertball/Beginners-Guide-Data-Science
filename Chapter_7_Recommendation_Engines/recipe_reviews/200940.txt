This is an amazing salad that feels like it was tailor-made for me. An unexpected combination of flavors comes together beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly, but used jalepeno instead of serrano because that's what I had. I made this about an hour before dinner and it was perfectly blended and chilled.  Thanks Soup Lover-Sue! :)

AWESOME!!! Everyone raved about this one. I use all different kinds of fresh fruits in this one. & Some times use lemon grass.
