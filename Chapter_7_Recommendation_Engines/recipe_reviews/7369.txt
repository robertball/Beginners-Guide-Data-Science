I have made this recipe for years - except I do mine a little differently..  I take the cake out of the oven poke holes in it and pour the glaze all over the cake while still in the pan.  Then I let it sit at least two hours before inverting it.  The whole cake is infused with the glaze and the top is nice and crunchy.

This cake was very easy to make and was a big hit.  My only suggestion to the recipe is to let it sit overnight once it is glazed.  My husband and I tasted it right after the glaze was put on and the rum taste was overpowering.  After it sit overnight, the rum had soaked into the cake and it was absolutely delicious!

A friend of mine baked this cake and I loved it so much, I asked her for the recipe. However, I just want to point out that the directions for the glaze are somewhat misleading. I would suggest NOT boiling the glaze for 5 minutes. I did mine on moderately high heat for 5 minutes and it got very dark brown and I think burned. I would suggest on low heat for only a couple of minutes. That should really be noted in the recipe. If anyone else can suggest how they really make the glaze for this one, it would be most appreciated.

I have made this cake a number of times now and it still a crowd favorite. I personally like to use more rum (typically a cup). The response from that is mixed, but the cake is always gone :).

Super cake.  I usually make cakes from scratch, however this came out great.  I used white cake, banana cream pudding and Captian Morgan's Spiced rum.  What a HUGE hit!  I made it the night before and let the glaze soak in overnight. Super moist and tasty.  This is a keeper.

I used a good quality cake mix with the pudding already mixed in and it was perfect.  Tips for the glazing, use chopsticks to poke holes into cake and pour glaze into empty bundt pan then reinsert cake to absorb glaze.  

Good dessert for Christmas.

YES!!  This was so delicious.  I served this after a delicious dinner and it was such a hit.  I can't believe how easy it was to make.  I did make one change.  I didn't have instant vanilla pudding however, I did use a box of instant butterscotch pudding.  Butterscotch and Rum go VERY well together.  I also DOUBLED the glaze recipe.  Also, prior to inverting onto a plate. I drizzled about a 1/2 cup of the glaze onto the plate so when I inverted the cake, I knew the bottom would get moist with the liquid gold.  Result was a very moist cake all around.  This is a keeper.

I think the person missed a key element...The cake glaze needs to be drizzled IMMEDIATELY on warm cake, NOT after it cools. Every recipe I have seen uses this method. This allows for better soaking into the cake for setting.
Just like another person said, even though I tried to use a little more flavor in the cake, it STILL tasted like the 'box cake' it was made of.

Amazing!  It only took about 40 minutes to cook in a convection oven.  I made double the glaze and slowly poured it on over 3 days.  I used a butter knife, stuck it down in several spots and let the glaze pour slowly down the knife into the slit.  Don't want to refrigerate it, then the glaze won't soak in as well.

Take to work on a Monday when everyone is tired and lazy , You have just become the energy drink of the day .   ( You will here all day I loved that cake )

Sometimes I mix up the flavors of the cake mix to get better cakes. Like strawberry cake mix with coconut rum, spiced or carrot cake with spiced rum. You can even use chocolate cake & change the rum to Kahl√∫a or Baileys. The possabilities are endless. The only booze I would not recomend is Vodka.

I am not much of a baker, nor am I a cake eater and on top of that, I do not care for dark rum.   But, I have a brother in the service in Saudi who requested I send him Rum cake or rum cookies.  I located this recipe and picked it because it looked the easiest to make and had excellent reviews. I doubled it to have enough to test before shipping.  What a great choice!  Not only do I have to make more for the holidays because everyone I let "test" it wanted more, but I found myself "testing" it a little more than necessary.  Thanks for the easy delicious rum cake Mariann.

The absolute best doctored cake mix (and we don't like cake mixes).    Have made the exact same recipe for years and DEFINITELY put on glaze while hot.   This cake gets better with age and will last for a week, covered, in the fridge.

I have used this recipe for years for both a rum cake and an orange coffee cake.  To make the coffee cake, just substitute orange juice for the rum in both the cake and the glaze.  It is always a big hit!!!  I actually make the coffee cake more often than the rum cake.

Yummy!  My friends beg me to make this cake.  My recipe addition ... spray the pans with a good baking spray and then sugar them instead of flouring them.

I have made this recipie several times! And it comes out perfect everytime. I use Myers rum and even have tried to use a little extra rum for a stronger taste and its still comes out great. Instead of the vegetable oil I also like to use butter, this makes the cake extra moist and yummy!

Wonderful recipe!  I made it exactly as the recipe said the first time, and then the second time I combined a different recipe with it and it tasted even better.  Here are the optional adaptations:  chocolate cake instead of yellow, 7 oz. chocolate fudge pudding instead of vanilla, and I doubled the amount of water, oil, and rum (bourbon tastes great, too!).

Excellent recipe!! The only change made was pecans instead of walnuts. (Personel preference.) I used a cake tester to poke the holes but will use chopsticks next time, as suggested, so that more of the glaze is absorbed. I stored the the covered cake in the fridge to enhance the flavor. My husband & I couldn't wait for the company to arrive to taste this cake, so we tried a slice (okay, 3 slices) the day before. So yummy!!! This will be next years neighbor Christmas gift. Thanks for sharing Mariann!

I make this rum cake all the time and everyone LOVES it.  I get requests to make this for every function that I go to and people will literally sneak pieces to take home with them. My family prefers pecans instead of walnuts but that is the only substitution that I make.  Just made one for Easter and now I'm making another one tonight for my son's birthday.  Best cake ever!

This is a tradition at my house for Christmas.  It freezes well, so I make it ahead and add extra juiced up icing before serving. Have also baked in small individual size bundt pans and served 6 or 8 around a pretty Jello mold on a platter.  I shipped 3 out to family this year. Protect the cake by double wrapping in aluminum foil in a pretty tin with a tight-fitting lid. UPS does a great job delivering with no damage.

I actually found this recipe someplace else but it's exactly the same. This cake is so awesome I didn't even want to share with anyone. I had to change it becuase I didn't have the exact ingredients it called for so instead of a yellow cake mix, I used a double choc cake mix and instead of vanilla pudding, I used choc pudding and intead of Rum, I used Southern Comfort! I also recommend you let it sit over night and eat it the next day so the flavors come together. And when your pouring the glaze on....make sure you pucture the cake all the way to the bottom so the cake is moist throughout and not just on the bottom after you invert it.

Delicious.  I cooled the cake for about 5 minutes. Then took it out of the pan, added the glaze in the bottom of the pan, and placed the cake back in to soak up the glaze. I also made a strawberry kiwi rum glazed (sugar, butter, rum, strawberries and kiwi) that i serve on the side (chilled).

GREAT RUM CAKE!!!!  VERY EASY to make and VERY YUMMY.  Suggestion for the glaze:  As it cools it will thicken,  I put it in the fridge for a few minutes, just a few.

I have never taken the time to rate a recipe, but this cake was can't stop eating it good. I used light instead of dark rum and pecans instead of walnuts. I forgot to put my butter in the glaze, but i melted it and spread it over the glazed cake. I also used a regular pound cake pan. It was as the kids say "off the chain"

I made this cake exactly as instructed except I used butter instead of oil and used half white and brown sugar and it came out perfect and tasted great. Will definitely make again.

This was a very easy way to make rum cake.  I added a little extra rum, skipped the walnuts, and mixed chocolate chips in with the batter.

It was good. I agree with other users that the rum was a bit overpowering so next time i'd cut the rum in half for the glaze. My mom and I both thought that it tasted better cold than warm~

I made several of these for Thanksgiving, first one was as the recipe said, but the rum on the glaze was a lil strong still, so i recommend using 1/3 of a cup for the glaze if you arent much into alchohol. Other than that, I loved the original taste!

Absolutely delicious! I only gave it four stars because I too, agreed with other reviews and poured the glaze over the bottom of the cake while it was still hot.  I also made a second batch of the glaze and poured it over the top of the cake once it was right side up.  I think anything less and it wouldn't have had as much of the rum flavor. . .however it was a wonderful Thanksgiving dessert.  Thank you!

Loved it! Lighter than I expected, but was wonderful and not overpowered - just the right amount of rum flavor. I'll make this one again!!!

Great recipe, easy and delicious. I omitted the nuts and used Myers rum and french vanilla pudding mix. I've made chocolate rum cake before...no glaze though so this was basically a first for me and it was so easy. The cake is very rum flavored but its not to much, although there is a lot of that flavor....its just perfect.

This cake was a big hit with my family and friends. I made it three times over the course of Thanksgiving Day weekend :) I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, except when I made the glaze I added some rum while it was cooking and then I added some rum once it was off the heat. I also did the glazing method in which I poured some glaze in the bundt pan and re-inserted the cake.

I've had this recipe for at least 20years, and had forgotten I had it till I was rummaging around in my old recipe box.  Without nuts, it tastes exactly like rum cakes we bought in Barbados.  I think the nuts are a bit distracting.  This is such a delicious cake, and easy.  It was a big hit at an end-of-the-year college class party.  My kids loved the leftovers,too.  I recommend it.

Just made this tonight and its AWESOME and really easy too!  I love rum cake - ever since we went to the Caymen's and I bought almost $100 worth of Tortuga rum cakes to bring home.  I will be making this all the time now!  I doubled the glaze mix so I could really saturate the cake and have some left over to drizzle over the indivdiual slices...doubling was a bit too much...but maybe making 1/3 more would be perfect.  Thanks - this was the perfect dessert for this holiday weekend!

I was looking for a recipe to replicate an Italian Rum Cake that a local bakery made, 30 years ago.  After some minor changes, this is a delicious facsimile. The only changes I made were to bake it in a square pan and, after glazing the cake, I cut it into 4 layers.  I used vanilla pudding as a filling between layers and made whipped cream frosting for the top.  It made a beautiful, tall cake. I wrapped parchment paper around the cake to keep the layers together before cutting it.  Really delightful-tasting cake.  I almost omitted the glaze but am glad I didn't because it really made the cake.  The pudding seemed to cut the sweetness of the glaze.  Thanks for sharing your recipe. It's a keeper.

I consider myself an average to good baker and I was very disappointed in the way this cake turned out.  I used a tube pan as I didn't have a bundt pan and followed the recipe exactly using good ingredients.  The cake looked great in the oven; right after I pulled it out the cake fell to over half its original size.  I have no idea why.  Then the glaze broke as soon as I tried to stir in the rum; I ended up with 'rum soup' instead of a glaze.  The final result has an ok flavor but nothing I would rave about.  I wish I had read all of the reviews before baking; some of the alternate suggestions could have saved me a cup of walnuts and good rum.

This was the perfect ending of today's Cuban feast. It was so perfect, I had to have two pieces (one with whipped cream and one without) just to make sure I was experiencing real perfection and not a mere facsimile thereof. And to think I used to turn my nose up at boxed cake mix! This recipe certainly elevates the convenient to the sphere of the divine. (That's the rum talking.)

Rum not for the light weights out there.  Cooked Perfectly in 50 minutes. Used Pecans instead of Walnuts.  Next time I will serve ala mode.

Very good recipe.  I doubled the glaze and soaked my cake upside down for awhile and then turned it over and poured the other half of the glaze on top.  Best to let set for 24 hours.

A super dessert--always a pleaser. I use banana instant pudding rather than vanilla and it adds a special flavor. I also boil the rum in the microwave to remove the excess alcohol prior to adding other glaze ingredients(which makes the "raw" flavor).

Love this one.  I've become famous for it at work and parties.  I've taken a little twist on it and have substituted Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum (not such a harsh rum taste) for the rum and add in a banana for flavor.  I usually leave off the nuts, too.

I went to Grand Cayman at one time and thought they had the best rum cake in the world and have been searching for a comparable recipe for years.......I've finally found it and it's too close to the taste to know the difference! I made it for my speech class and I got rave reviews!

I made this rum cake after someone had brought one to work and I fell in love with it. She used Capt. Morgan's spiced run which I did also. Instead of taking the cake out of the bundt pan, while warm; I poured the glaze on the cake from the bottom and it soaked it up and was wonderfully moist and great when eaten warm.

This was fantastic .... took it as the birthday cake for a friend and everyone raved over how light and moist it was.  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and combined all the wet ingredients before adding to the dry.  I didn't change anything about the glaze, but did sprinkle a little bit of powdered sugar on top.  I also made fresh whipped cream, added a little bit of powdered vanilla rum, and served it on the side.  It was a nice touch.

Love this cake! I let the eggs get to room temp and mix that with liquids prior to dry mix, seems to come out fuller. For glaze, add sugar slowly instead of all at once cooks the grittiness out better and thicker. I let cake cool completely, poke holes with kabob sticks and use turkey baster to drizzle over top. Soaks it all up! Yummy.

I've made this twice now and both times it was a huge hit! The only things I did differently are I used Malibu Rum &I doubled the glaze. I also poured the glaze into the bundt pan and put the cake back into the pan.   When the cake cooled I drizzled more glaze onto the cake with a turkey baster. So much easier that way.

First time making Rum cake and it turned out fantastic! I made it for Christmas day and all the company over raved about it. I left out the nuts. Other than that I followed the recipes exact. Easy and delicious. I will make this again and again.

My family and I loved this recipe, however I used pecans instead of walnuts. It turned out looking just like the picture and the crunchy topping was a hit. I agree with the previous reviews allow it to sit for an hour or longer before eating. Great! Great! Great!

Wonderful recipe. Made for Thanksgiving. I had Vanilla rum and pecans on hand so I made those changes but otherwise followed recipe.  This was great and loved by my family.

Very good cake. I used slivered almonds for the nuts; and the only thing I did differently is when it was time to glaze it, I poured half the glaze into the bundt pan, put the cake back in it, and poured the rest of the glaze on top then just waited until it was soaked into the cake.

Simple and fantastic--I have gotten rave reviews every time I've baked this cake.  As a garnish, I top the cake with a blend of powdered sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of ground ginger.

Delicious!!  Very strong rum odor.  Not appetizing for family who don't drink but very good.  Being made from a cake mix made it sure to be delicious.

This was the first time I made rum cake and it was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely make this again.  I used the suggestion of coconut rum and coconut with half nuts.  A definite recipe keeper.

An easy and yummy recipe.  I used butter and sugar (instead of flour) to coat pan to prevent sticking. I also used a 5 oz. pudding mix as opposed to a 3.5 oz. pkg.  This was a real hit at the birthday party for a friend!

This cake is one of my favs!!!  I initially tried it  in 2008 and my boyfriend (who is a huge critic) liked it. Then I made it for my family at Christmas and my daddy raved about it so much that I sent half of it with him home! :) I totally enjoy this cake!! It is one desert (along with my my mama's carrot cake and a red velvet cake recipe) that I always make exceptionally well... I always add a little extra rum to the batter and use pecan instead of walnuts as I am a huge pecan fan and not at all big on walnuts. If you want a good classic moist cake, please make this!

I thought this cake was great!!!  It was a last minute decision to make a cake, so I used what I had in the pantry, which was butter pecan cake mix, Capt Morgan's rum, and sugar free vanilla pudding mix and a small amount of banana cream pudding.  My grandmother who doesn't drink---LOVED IT!!!  My mom keeps asking for the recipe.  My husband didn't like it, but he only like peanut butter and chocolate (so he doesn't count):)

This cake is absolutely amazing.  We recently went to Jamaica and bought a rum cake and it was fabulous.  Since then I'd been looking for a recipe and found this recipe. Everyone who had the one from Jamaica agrees that it tasted like it.  To make it more healthy, I did use splenda, sugar free pudding and eggbeaters - I tried it with all different types of rum too (Brugal, Bacardi, etc.) and they have all been excellent.  The last one I did I experimented by injecting some of the glaze into the cake - you have to be very careful because if you inject too much it will get a sour like taste to it if it is too much.  Everyone enjoy and thanks for the recipe!

Great cake! I have made this recipe several times over the last holiday season and it turned out perfect everytime. I used Golden rum (it was what I had) and let soak before serving as sugguested. It's a keeper!

This cake was ok. I poked holes and let the glaze soak in overnight as was suggested but it still seemed pretty dry. I also put rum in the batter as was called for but the cakes still just tasted like regular boxed cake. But my family ate it all so it definitely wasn't bad.

wow! this cake was fabulous. i have been searching for this recipe snce a co-worker brought this cake in and wouldn't share the "family secret." The woman at the liquor store gave me a great tip: after pouring half the glaze in the pan and reinserting the cake, she puts the second half of the glaze in a salt shaker to sprinkle the glaze-a great idea. the glaze is more evenly distributed. Thanks for the recipe mariann!!

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  A tip for the glaze- after adding the rum leave the glaze to cool a bit to thicken before drizzling over top of cake.  Also the idea to poke holes in the top with chopsticks so the glaze soaks through is an excellent one.

I just now got finished baking the cake and I must say that when I made the glaze for the top of the cake, I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a big mess.  It did not work out at all.  Now I have this cake with no glaze to put on it.

My family can't get enough of this. I use little loaf pans. It's a great size for a snack. I also add a little more rum than called for. I fix this at least three or four times a month. Thank you Mariann. I hope you will share more.

My Husband loves this cake it is by far one of his favorites-  I did add a few changes I used ducan hines butter cake mix WITHOUT the pudding added I used FRENCH vanilla instant pudding mix I added 1/2 cup of milk. I used 3/4 cup Bacardi Gold rum in the batter and for the glaze i used Malibu Red. I too poured half of the glazed into the bottom of the pan and reinsert the cake for about 2 hours, I also poked holes using a fork and poured the rest of the glaze over the cake. PERFECTO! I read other reviews that claim that you call tell this is a box cake thats not true well not in my case I believe the half cup milk may have made all the difference and no I did not subb the milk for water I still used 1/2 cup of water I just by mistake added the 1/2 cup of 2% milk and boy I am glad I did...also for the glaze I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar..I hope you guys enjoy this cake as much as me and my hubby did.

INCREDIBLE!!!! I followd this recipe exactly and it was so yummy. I found that this is not really kid friendly. Almost got a little tipsy eating two pieces of this cake. Just be careful of what kind of rum you use and the proof. I used only an 80 proof and it had my 250 pound father feeling a little funny too.

Easy and delicious! Friends think I spent hours baking this cake.  As per suggestions, I poked numerous holes in the cake still in the pan, then I poured the glaze(double the recipe). Very moist!

I have been making this for a while now. Everyone loves it. I use pecans instead of walnuts and I make holes in the cake and pour the glaze on the cake while its still in the pan, to keep it from spilling. This cake is always a hit and its always gone in an hour!

This cake is AWESOME! Yet another recipe my mom introduced to me back when I was in high school, and I've carried it with me for the last few years, bringing it out especially during Holidays! It's a huge hit with all of the family!

The best and easiest recipe ever!!!  Everyone wants me to make this.  I have tried inverting the cake back in with the rum sauce and everyone still likes it.  However they prefer the drizzled on sauce.  They like to gather the drippings from the plate.

Never made one before and I did it!  Easy to make, looks beautiful and tastes great!  My husband asked for one and thinks I really did it this time!  I followed the directions to a T.  Now I will make another one with chocolate cake mix and see how that goes.

Very tasty, but add 1/4 c more rum. My grandfather said that this was as good as his mother's rum cake, and he is not prone to praise... so this recipe is a winner!

Awsome cake. Great idea for any occasion! The rum isn't too strong, but nice enough to get the taste. It was very moist, and left a great after taste, making you want more....

This came out pretty good. I had to substitute Brandy for the rum and I also used a spice cake for a richer flavor. I added the sauce while it was hot and packed it into the fridge overnight. I could tell it was a box cake though, thing is, it wouldn't keep me from making this cake again, so thanks!

This cake surprised me by how good it was. I didn't think it was possible to have a box cake turn out with such substance. Great flavor, color, and presentation. Truly delicious.

I can't give this 5 stars because it does not knock my socks off.  I love the rum sauce, but the cake itself is just ok.

This is very similar to the rum cake my mom made every Christmas, which was the best rum cake ever!  So, I'm very happy with the cake.  My cake did not turn out as moist as I would have liked, but I didn't poke the holes into the cake as recommended for the glaze.  The taste was wonderful and I'll make this again!!

I have been making this cake 3 or 4 times per year, for the last 3 years. Everybody loves this cake. And the recipe is just wonderful. I made one last night, I forgot to let it cool, and it split in two, if this was a frosted cake I could cover up my screwup. hahahaha, try it you'll love it.

I followed the recipe cake exactly, HOWEVER...after making this recipe several times, I tripled the glaze recipe. I used a stick and a half of butter, a 1/4 + 1/8 cup of water, a cup and a half of sugar, but reduced the rum to a 1/4 + just a little over an 1/8 cup.  I poured 1/3 of the glaze into the bottom of the pan, reinserted the cake, poked holes with the end of a wooden spoon in the bottom of the cake, which was now upside down in the pan, then poured the remaining 2/3 of the glaze into the holes and around the bottom and edges. This is a killer recipe!

I have made this several times and it is a smash everytime.  I add 1/8cup of rum to the glaze and let the cake sit over night so it can absorb all of it.  I also add dried cranberries and crushed walnuts on top before bathing it with the glaze.  It gives it color  and extra taste/crunch. I sometimes let the dried cranberries sit in rum before using them for an extra punch. Guess you can tell I love rum!!

I made this Rum Cake I with Rum Glaze for my family dinner on Christmas day; it was incredibly moist, fragrant, and good for any season. It transports well and is full of booze which makes it perfect for any holiday or potluck gathering.

This recipe seems to be the same as my mom's, which was a favorite in our family.  I have to agree with other reviewers who suggest adding the glaze while the cake is still hot in the pan.  I add part of it then, and the rest after taking the cake out and inverting it on to the serving plate.  Also, 5 minutes of boiling the glaze is way too long!  The first time I made it I didn't trust my instincts when it suddenly turned dark brown, and almost set off the smoke detectors in my house! :-)  But the second time around I boiled it for about 3 to 3.5 minutes and it was perfect.  Took it to a pitch-in at church where it was gobbled right up.

This recipe is a crowd pleaser every time .  I like to use a GOOD dark  Caribbean  rum preferably Virgin Islands, St. Lucia Or Barbados.  This cake is perfect for the holidays or any occasion or just plain anytime!  You won't believe how moist it is.

I really liked how good this cake came out. I made it last Thanksgiving and plan on making it this holiday. The only change I will make is to buy a better quality dark rum. I purchased a Trader Joe's dark rum which wasn't bad but it wasn't as sweet tasting as I think some other brands are. Very eash to make and looks gorgeous sitting in your cake display (I almost did't want to let people cut it).

I have made this recipe three times and each time the cake has collapsed.  I have no idea why.

yummy!  I doubled the sauce and poured half of it over a finely pricked (I used a bamboo skewer) cake while it was still hot in the pan.  I let it sit for an hour before inverting.  Then poked the other side, and brushed some more of the glaze over it several times.

I made this for a potluck and it was wonderful.  I didn't have almonds, but I had pine nuts.  It made it taste even more buttery. Sure HIT.

This was very good, delicious in fact! I'm holding out the 5 stars for the next rum cake I make, which will be "Golden Rum Cake" from this site. I have higher expectations for that cake now!

I left out the topping and used powdered sugar.  It was a good cake and really moist with lots of flavor. I froze it for 3 days and let it thaw out during the day.  Really good!  Thanks!

Great for the holiday and I always put a little more rum than it required.
Enjoy for the holidays.

This is a great cake.  I always use Bacardi Select Dark Rum, it cost a bit more but the flavor of this rum is incredible.  The only reason I din't give it 5 stars is I still must perfect my recipe for my oven because sometimes I get a lopsided cake.  It's so good people don't care weather it's lopsided or not though.

This is the only place I've been able to find a rum cake recipe that's as good as my aunt's (who won't share her recipe). Rum cake has become a Christmas tradition is our family. It's excellent with rum-spiked whipped cream.
