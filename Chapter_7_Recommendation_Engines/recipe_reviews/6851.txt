I did not care for this bread.  It isn't sweet, it doesn't taste like coconut OR pineapple, much less pina colada.  I also did not care for the consistency.

Not as tasty as expected. My husband loves pineapple, but he was disappointed.

This is one of the best bread recipes I've tried! I used coconut flavored rum and sweetened coconut because that's what I had and OMG is this a yummy bread! It smells wonderful, has a light fluffy texture and is so moist!

Excellent bread, only change I did was to put coconut into a coffee grinder to make into powdered coconut and then dry roasted in a pan to bring out its nutty character. Kids love it but be aware the bread make alot of 'crumbs' (from the powdered coconut I think)

This loaf came out really nicely for me. Instead of water, used coconut milk for a bit more flavor. Used Bacardi Gold as well for more flavor instead of a light rum. May have used slightly more toasted coconut as well. DH said the real flavor seemed concentrated in the crust, but he really liked it too. Will make this one again. Thanks Michelle!

We found it very bland and not very sweet. I don't think I'd make this again.
