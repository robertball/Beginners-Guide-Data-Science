This is really a "no brainer" recipe!  I was glad this one didn't explicitly mention using a bread machine.  These were easy and delicious.  I topped them off with a cream cheese icing. (1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup softened margarine, 2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 teas vanilla, and 1/8 teas salt) YUM!

Very easy and really took only 90 minutes!  I tried them both with muffin pans and in an 11 inch square pan.  I liked them better in the square pan, they were not as dry but they took longer to cook (about 30-35 minutes instead of 20).

The reviews say it all - this is an easy, delicious cinnamon roll recipe!  Only thing I did differently was to melt extra butter, sugar and cinnamon to pour on top of the cinnamon rolls just before baking.  They turned out very soft, sweet and gooey.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

***BAKE WITH CAUTION- MY OVEN CAUGHT FIRE WITH THIS METHOD OF MAKING CINNAMON ROLLS*** I thought it was clever that these cinnamon rolls are actually made in muffin tins- but it turned out volatile. The sugar and butter mixture bubbles up and oozes out of these as they bake and rise in the oven; so much so that it oozed all over the oven bottom and caused an oven fire in my home. These would be fantastic, but the instructions should be in bold face: YOU MUST PLACE A LARGE COOKIE SHEET UNDER THE MUFFIN PAN TO CATCH THE DRIPPINGS. 

Please, anyone trying this recipe, note this and do this to avoid any fires in your kitchen.

I absolutely love this recipe!!  I make them for brunch every Sunday and they are always a hit.  I can mix them up in the KitchenAid and let them knead while I clean up the   kitchen Saturday night.  Roll them up, put them in the muffin tin (I spray the tin well with cooking spray) cover with plastic wrap (also use cooking spray on plastic) put them in the refrigerator overnight and they are ready to go.  I just let them set out on the counter for 30 minutes before putting them in the oven and this recipe has never failed me.  I usually substitute the brown sugar in the filling with white sugar and add whatever spices and zests I feel like.  These are so good there are never any left!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to write a review because I don't know when I've been more pleased with the results of a recipe!  Soft, tender, delicious cinnamon rolls in half the time of standard recipes.  I added chopped walnuts with the raisins, cooked the rolls in a 9x13 inch pan instead of in muffin cups, and topped them with cream cheese frosting and they were just delicious.

So delicious! Be sure to put another tray underneath the muffin tins though - the yummy gooey cinnamon and sugar mixture bubbles up and out. :-D Soft and fluffy.

Excellent recipe!  I've tried several recipes for cinnamon rolls, and this is, by far, the easiest, quickest, and most delicious "from scratch" recipe yet!  To shorten the process, I used a 2 cup Pyrex cup to heat the milk in the microwave, then added the butter and water to the milk; when butter is melted and liquid is 120 -125 degrees, add to the flour/yeast mixture.  If any hotter, it will kill the yeast, if any cooler, the yeast will not activate.

FABULOUS!! I subbed shortening for the margarine, as I find there to be little discernible difference in your product between using margarine, butter or shortening in yeast doughs. I do, however use only softened butter in the cinnamon sugar mixture that gets spread over the dough before rolling up. That's where the flavor matters. I baked them for only 18 minutes, and they were absolutely perfect. Light in texture, and they baked up super high. Put raisins in half of them when rolling the dough. We're not fans of cream cheese frosting on cinnamon rolls, so I made a plain glaze (see picture) out of 1 Tb softened butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, a dash of vanilla extract and 1 Tb milk, so that it was fairly thick. Topped each roll with a small dab (go easy so as not to overwhelm the rolls with megawatt sweetness) when they were just fresh out of the oven, which melted and drizzled over each roll attractively. I took them to a quilt guild cutting party, and they were scarfed up, the silence of collective eating punctuated only by appreciative moans. As good as any roll that takes 3 times as long, and so easy you can throw them together to make any weekend morning a delightful event for the family.

Yummy!!!
So it took a little bit longer than 90 mins, but who cares...The end result was worth it. I'd been searching for a cinnabun recipe where a bread machine was not required and this was perfect. Having read previous comments I decided to bake in a 13 by 9 pan and they came out fantastic. I do not kid when I say they were gone in 10 mins. By the way, I slathered cream cheese frosting over the buns making it all the more SINFUL.... Thanks Debbie!

Fabulous! First time making a yeast roll and this was pretty easy. Revisions: Used 2 1/4 tsp. dry active yeast (not instant) dissolved in the water (warm) before adding to the flour mixture.  Added 3/4 c. more flour to get the right consistency  (rainy day) while kneading in my KitchenAid mixer (7-8 min.). I cut back on the brown sugar a little and added 1 tsp. more of cinnamon for the filling. After spreading, I sprinkled it w/ raisins & chopped nuts. Cut & placed the rolls in a parchment-lined 13 x 9 metal pan, covered w/ plastic wrap & refrigerated overnight.  Removed from fridge 1 hour before baking at 365 degrees for 25 min. While the rolls were baking, I made a simple glaze of conf. sugar, vanilla ext., water & lemon juice. After removing the rolls the from oven, immediately spread w/ the glaze. Boy, were these ever good still warm w/ a hot cup of java! Will definitely make again as they are pretty simple & quick to put together and I'm no longer intimidated by making these from scratch.  I will never purchase the refrigerated variety again.

This recipe was so delicious. I made the cream cheese frosting that was suggested by another reviewer and I received rave reviews. My family can't get enough. Thanks.

fantastic, I was not sure about the instant yeast since i had active dry yeast, I just used one .25 active dry yeast packet in 1/4 cup of warm water
and added it after 10 minutes.. to the flour, egg salt
sugar, milk mix, the rolls came out great, I did them in a 9x13 pan baked for 22 minutes (Tip) take them out of the pan while warm or they will stick to the pan.
(Update) I use parchment paper under the rolls and soon as they come out of the oven i flip them upside down on another cookie sheet with parchment and pull off the parchment paper on the top and they are beautiful with all that goey stuff on top, no mess in the pan to clean up :-)

This is an absolutely wonderful cinnamon roll recipe!  The dough is so easy to work with and rolls out beautifully, and the finished product is tender and delicious.  Plus, it's so much quicker and easier than my old recipe.  Thanks!!!

First time i made cinnamon rolls.. these were GREAT..  I used ACTIVE dry yeast, let the yeast proof with warm (1/4 cup) water, added warm milk and butter, sugar, egg, and 2 1/4 c. flour, beat with a wooden spoon, added 1/2 cup more flour, then put on lightly floured table, and kneaded in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour (and maybe a bit more) . Let rise 1 hour, punched down, rolled out, put the sugar/butter mixtuer (used 1/3 cup butter) rolled up leaving 1 inch of the edge without the mixture, put some water on it with my finger to seal. Cut into 12 pieces, placed on lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Let rise another hour (both times next to the warm oven,covered). Baked 15 minutes.. do not OVERBAKE. brushed with 1 tbsp melted butter and sprinkled a bit more brown sugar. Iced with cream cheese frosting (1 cup powder sugar, t tbsp butter,4oz cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp milk) Second time using yeast.. this was easy once i got help from some of the girls from the exchange! not sure why but i only got one swirl or whatever you call them. next time i will roll out the dough bigger

I love this recipe and have made it before but I'd like to issue a WARNING: Do not double recipe. Follow the recipe pound for pound, word for word, otherwise you'll end up with X-TRA large cinnamon blobs. It takes at least 7 cups of flour or more to make 20 of these things and then you end up losing flavor in the end. If you want to make more than 12. Then just make 12 to begin and 12 more later. Its not worth the mess. I tried to make 20 with only 6 and half cups flour and it was impossible trying to get the dough to stop sticking to everything, my hands, the rolling pin, etc. I even used a wet towel and rolled the dough out on that and it was working fine to begin with, but as the towel started to dry, the dough became stickier because it sucked all the moisture out of the towel. I will make these again, but never more than a set of 12 at a time. And make sure you have extra flour on hand in case you need more. After 6 and a half cups flour, I ran out and suffered greatly for it. Other than that, if you make them right, they are the easiest and best cinnamon rolls made without a bread machine. Good luck.

Awesome recipe.  This is the first no-fail yeast recipe for me. My tips for success: 1. Add 2 T. flour to filling mixture, so it doesn't run too much.  2. I added a handful of pecans to the heavily buttered pan.  3. I put a hot damp towel on top of the rolls after they came out of the oven, to steam the top about 15 min.  This ensures a soft top.  Next, I inverted the pan with the towel onto a tray to allow the filling to seep back into the rolls- about 2 mins.  I made a simple icing using the same bowl that I made the filling in, incorporating what was left of the mixture.  I glazed the tops with this cinnamony blend.  Best rolls ever!  The rolls were still soft the next day straight from the fridge.  Thanks, Debbie.

I have made these rolls twice now (twice in ONE week!) and absolutely loved them both times. The rolls came out perfectly cooked and so easy! I created a few substitutions of my own in the recipe - I added a bit more brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter than the recipe calls - for for the filling because I love my cinnamon rolls very gooey and yummy. As an added twist, I also added in about 4 ounces of cream cheese into the filling as well (after letting it soften, I mixed it into the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon, then spread it onto the dough). The second time I made the rolls, I had some extra filling left over, so I decided to make a custom form of cream cheese icing for the rolls. I took the filling, added the rest of the package of cream cheese into it (the remaining 4 ounces in the package), a dash of milk, some powdered sugar to taste and mixed it all together by hand until it came together into a thick frosting consistency. After the rolls came out of the oven, I slathered it on them and let it melt all over - super gooey and delicious! In my opinion, way better than Cinnabon! (I would provide measurements of my substitutions, but I just add in what looks about accurate for my personal tastes and go with it - don't be afraid to experiment! These rolls are very forgiving and stand up to anything that I've tried!)

Baking these in a muffin tin, while indeed faster than a pan, resulted in a HUGE mess with the filling bubbling up and spilling out all over my oven - which I had just cleaned. With the majority of the filling gone, the rolls were hardened and dry. These probably would have been much better baked in a pan, as it seems most positive reviewers did. It doesn't add much time, so I would recommend doing it.

This recipe was my first baking with yeast adventure.  Although it probably took more than 90 minutes to make, the recipe was easy to follow and not as time consuming as I thought it would be.  I liked the idea of baking in muffin tins for nicely shaped and controllable cinnamon rolls but the importance of putting a baking sheet underneath the muffin tin was not mentioned.  The butter brown sugar mixture overflowed all over my cupcake tin and into the bottom of my oven, at one point starting a small fire, which made for a very smokey kitchen that afternoon.  However, the end result were delicious, fluffy and satisfying cinnamon rolls that I will make again, probably in a 9x13 but for goodness sake, put a sheet tray under your muffin tin when you make this recipe!

YUM!!!!  I loved these cinnamon rolls.  My family
gobbled them up.  I think next time I will cut them
before I roll them so they don't get squished.  I 
made icing for them by mixing 1/2 cup icing sugar
with 1 tablespoon of milk.  I am 13 years old, I 
love to cook and I can't wait to make these again!

AMAZINGLY easy and tender! I've made quite a few recipes and this one is the best and easiest so far. Don't let the 90 minutes scare you - it tastes just a good and gooey as the longer versions out there. Other doughs are usually harder to roll out and shrink back, but this dough rolls out so easily and keeps it's shape. The end results are a tender, moist, gooey cinnamon roll. Definitely bake in a 13x9 for moister rolls. I did brush the rolls with butter before baking and it creates an extra layer of moistness. Nothing better than eating these with cream cheese frosting. Will be my master recipe.

WOW! This was so easy and delicious! I took another user's advice and dabbed the top of each roll with 1/2 a spoonful of the cinnamon/butter/brown sugar mixture before baking...and I didn't think they needed any icing! They were sweet and gooey!

Mmmm, these are wonderful.  They've become a staple 'special item' in our house.  It's easy to cut down the fat dramatically by using a light butter or even substituting some of the fats for applesause.  Then you don't have to feel quite so guilty, yet get the same wonderfully gooey, tempting results.

This was my first attempt ever at making Cinnamon Rolls. I could not believe how easy these were to make. One bite and my husband says "these don't have a chance in this house". Everyone loved them and these will be a regular in our house. It has been two days since I made them and the family has requested them again.

These are incredible!  The best cinnamon rolls I have EVER had!!!  Ten times better than cinnabon.  I used butter instead of margarine and reservered about 1/4 of the butter/sugar mixture and spread it on top of the cinnamon rolls before putting in the oven - they came out really moist.  For the frosting I mixed 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 1/2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 Tbspn. butter, 1/4 tsp. vanilla, and 1 1/2 Tbspn. milk and poured a spoonful of the frosting on the top of each cinnamon roll once it was served.  Oh, by the way, I cooked the rolls in a 9x13 glass pan instead of muffin tins and they turned out excellent.  Mmmmmm.

Good, fast and easy.  Could probably be made even easier if you simply rolled out the dough, and sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on the dough and then dabbed butter throughout.  Definitely a keeper.  They loved 'em!

Great easy recipe with pretty good results. I wasn't wild about the filling though which was a little overly sweet while still being a little bland in terms of other flavours. I modified it by adding a half teaspoon of salt and cutting the sugar by about 20%. I also added about 50g of pecans and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The results were dramatic and improved an already great roll.
By the way use butter instead of margarine and you'll enjoy a much fuller flavour without all those nasty hydrogenated fats.

Oh, mama!  How do I give this recipe 10 stars?!  Quick and easy to make, and definitely worth the "trouble."  My son was shocked to learn that cinnamon rolls don't have to come from a can.  With this great recipe, he won't have to eat those canned rolls again.  Thanks!

They were good.  I used the cream cheese idea from another recipe.  My only complaint is that the sugar from these dripped off the muffin pan and burned onto my oven.  The smoke filled my kitchen with that awful burnt smell and now I have to deal with getting the burnt stuff off of my oven floor....not real happy about that.  If you are going to try this for the first time, think about putting these rolls into a 9 x 13 pan to save yourself the extra cleaning!

I made these today and my family went WILD!!  They think I should open a coffee and cinnamon roll shop.  : )  I did add icing to the top, but this recipe is wonderful.  The rolls are soft, sweet, (but not too sweet), and flavorful.  I could not be happier.  Thanks for sharing.

These rolls were quick and fun to make with my 5-year-old. I like that they are made in a muffin pan, so they make individual servings. I think the filling recipe makes too much, as it bubbled over while baking. I plan to make a half recipe next time I prepare these.

I just finished making this recipe for breakfast. I have never made cinnamon buns before so I was a little bit nervous. However, these turned out wonderfully. I used soy milk in place of regular milk and they were still great. The entire family loved them. Thanks Debbie!

The rolls weren't as quick rising as I thought.
However, they were very good and the right amount of filling.

Okay, maybe they took a little over 90 minutes -- but who cares? They're just about perfect .  During baking, the brown sugar/butter-based filling caramelizes beautifully. I added pecans and raisins to the filling and topped them with cream cheese frosting -- man oh man, they didn't last an hour.

I doubled this recipe for a bunch of high school girls, they LOVED these! The changes I made were: I kneaded in a standing mixer (kitchen aid) vs by hand, I did not mix the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon mixture-instead I smeared the butter on the dough, then sprinkled the brown sugar and cinnamon and pressed this into the butter.  Also I baked in a 9X13 inch pan instead of muffin tins as I like center cinnamon rolls. Im not sure why the first listed butter or margarine has to be softened...it gets melted with the milk, no need to soften! I topped with cream cheese frosting, Yummy!

Truly the BEST cinnamon rolls I've ever had!
I did not have instant yeast, so I used regular yeast. So it took a lot longer to rise but it was DEFINITELY worth the wait. Add a bit of nutmeg to the cinnamon mix! It makes it even better! They came out ooey gooey and so yummy! For the icing I recommend using Cinnamon Bun Icing by Asilmarie, loved it!

I would give it 5 stars but the recipe didn't include frosting. I mixed 3T butter, 1 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1t vanilla and 3T milk in a bowl and frosted the rolls after they came out of the oven. Also, when they're baking it's a good idea to put a baking dish on the rack below them as they tend to spill out of the muffin pans.

This dough was so easy to work with;  this makes me happy, because I hate difficult dough! As per other reviewers, I increased the cinnamon to 2 tbsps. I just spread the 1/2 cup softened butter directly (and thickly) on the sheet of dough, and I didn't have any crunchy sugar problems. As someone else mentioned, cut your dough with dental floss! Thanks, this will be my standard cinnamon bun recipe.

This was a great recipe and so fast and easy.  The dough is easy to handle and rolls beautifully.  They are even yummy the next day.  The rolls were too huge for my muffin pans, but I just have the regular size.  Next time I'll bake them in a 11x7" size pan.

This is the BEST cinnamon roll recipe I have ever come across, and I have tried plenty of them! So easy and the rolls truly are ready in the 90 minutes. It says 20 minutes in the oven, and that was exactly right. I was a bit worried to make them with no frosting, but you don't need it. They are moist and perfectly sweet. I did take the suggestion of another person. I melted about a half stick butter, with a 1/4 c. brown sugar and a couple tsp of cinnamon, drizzled it over the rolls right when they came out of the oven. PERFECT. My husband who hates all homemade cinnamon rolls, he loves the ones you buy at the mall, loved them. Had to make a second pan!

In how many languages can you say AWESOME?
This is a new household favorite.  I made these exactly how the recipe read with the exception of allowing the yeast, sugar and water sit for about 10 minutes, and I had no problems whatsoever.  My only suggestion is, if you are unsure about the temperature of the milk then purchase a kithchen thermometer it will become your best friend.  I made sure the milk did not go over 115 degrees.  I am slowly getting into the bread making hobby and this is one that will become a staple in my home and at work. Thanks for the recipe.

this is a great recipe. i cook it and it comes out perfect every single time. i would suggest using more flour if the dough is too sticky. this is the best recipe. it looks hard but once you do it it seems easy because it is. let it rise for a better outcome. TRY IT TODAY. it is really easy.

These were so easy to make, very delicious, and froze very well! Tip: The filling leaks while baking and sticks terribly onto the pan, so you might try lining the bottom of whatever pan you use with wax paper to save yourself from some serious pan-scrubbing later.

By far the easiest/best recipe I have tried.  I also combined 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar, brought to a near boil, removed from heat and stirred in 1/4 cup (give or take) cream.  Then poured that in the bottom of the pan, added the buns, let rise for an hour (half an hour wasn't long enough) and baked for 30 minutes. (at 20 they weren't quite done) Let sit for a few minutes then flip the buns over onto a tray.  Perfect cinnamon buns.

This comment is most likely going to be lost in the abyss of five star comments, but I couldn't resist the temptation to leave my up most appreciation for these delightful treats. You can't mess these up! I made them last night, and put them in my fridge. Then in the morning set them in the sun to rise a bit before popping them in the oven. As I devour this incredible roll of goodness, I slowly melt with the butter and brown sugar godliness!

Quick, easy and delicious! I am so intimidated when it comes to using yeast and the whole process, but this recipe was super simple and I received rave reviews from my husbands co-workers. I placed the buns in a 13X9 inch baking pan and finished them off with a cream cheese frosting. A defenite keeper, thanks!!

some bakers were commenting on how the cinnamon mixture was grainy. the solution: use butter instead of margarine. most margarine has too much water in it for good baking. I think if you're using margarine you have to use the cheap block margarine, not the healthy kind!

This is a great recipe, I would recommend it to anyone.  I didn't have confectioners sugar in the kitchen, so i used the vanilla ice cream caramel recipe from another recipe to replace the icing.  They turned out amazing.  I would suggest using the caramel to anyone who wants to try something a little different.

These came out great! I actually got 16 rolls out of this recipe. I made the following changes: I used my kitchenaid mixer and added 6 additional tb flour during the 5 minute kneading with the dough hook. I rolled it into a 10 x 16" rectangle and cut into 16 pieces. I also doubled the cinnamon, and frosted with a cream cheese and butter frosting someone else posted in a review. I baked them in a 10" square aluminum (wilton) cake pan for 20 minutes, but I think it might be better to cut the temp down by 25 degrees.

Also, I'd probably cut down the brown sugar to 2/3c or 3/4c next time as it was a little much, but still delicious anyway.

i followed the directions exactly, but the dough stuck to everything, and the filling mixture was more like a paste that oozed everywhere when i tried to roll this mess up. i even double checked the ingredients and amounts. this was an absolute mess that i will never ever ever try again. the only thing that stopped me from introducing it to my trash can is the fact that i spent so much time on it. so, we will soon see if it tastes as bad as it looks.

The dough was easy to work with, and they didn't take as long to make as other cinnamon roll recipes; however, I think the dough could have been sweeter, so next time I'll probably increase the amount of sugar. I made an icing with two ounces of softened cream cheese mixed with about 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, a tsp of vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of milk.

These were awesome.  My one regret was adding  a cream cheese frosting as some posters did.  It was way over the top and overpowered the flavours in the rolls.  Will be making these again with just a simply glaze.

I love this recipe! They come out the best with a cream cheese frosting(powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla). One thing that I found this past weekend, is that if you let the dough rise for about 25 minutes they come out even better, the melt in your mouth. Either way there are awesome but my aunt told me I should let everyone know.

Overall, they were tasty. However, it seemed like the cinnamon mixture mostly ran out and there was not enough in the rolls themselves and the bread was a little dry. Also, if using unsalted butter instead of margarine, I would suggest adding a little extra salt or your bread will taste flat.

I LOVE this recipe!  It produces a yeasty roll that you would expect to take much longer to make.  I always combine this with my personal favorite sticky bun recipe - 1 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. butter, 1/4 c. honey, and 1/4 c. bourbon brought to a boil and mixed with 3/4 c. chopped pecans - and place the sticky bun sauce in a 13x9 pan before placing the cut roll dough on top.  I follow everything else in the recipe as written.  A wonderful weekend treat!

I prefer the traditional rolls, made with yeast and left to rest and rise. BUT this is all right only when you have time:-) if you are in a hurry this is the reciper for you: no resting to speak of and a great result all the same. My kids are not crazy about cinnamon, so I filled the dough with the chocolate of the Easter eggs and the result was quite appreciated!

I've been using this recipe for cinnamon buns for over 2 years and I have yet to have a horrible experience with it. I too liked that these didn't call explicitly for a bread machine, although I do use one (now that I have one, that is) for the dough and they turn out right every time. I'm also a bigger fan of using the 13x9 pan, as I find they spread out and up a lot better than with a muffin tin, and they also don't bubble over with the delicious innards.

After two tries, dough did not rise. I baked it anyway. The flavor was good, but you can't really go wrong with cinnamon bun flavor. The dough was heavy. I'll keep looking for a better recipe. I didn't think this one was anything more than fair.

I've made these twice and they turned out spectacularly both times. I omitted the raisins, used a square pan to keep them super gooey and moist, cut them a little thicker (9 rolls instead of 12, to fit the pan better), and topped them with a simple cream cheese frosting another reviewer recommended. FANTASTIC. If my waistline would forgive it, these would be at least a once a month regular. As it is, they make it in twice a year at least! Very well received and highly requested! Just as easy as it seems. Great recipe, thanks!  (Tip for under equipped cooks; I used a wine bottle wrapped in parchment paper the first time, since I didn't have a rolling pin yet!)

This recipe was so good. The buns fluffy and soft. I was a bit nervous at first being to bread like but I was wrong. It was fun and very easy to make this recipe. I will definatley make this again and again. Who needs to go and get it from a Cinnabon shop when I can make it on my own and get praise from my family. Highly recomended. Plus I made my own cream cheese frosting to go on top. I was hit that day...

These were excellent. I made them for my Thursday morning playgroup. I made them then cut them and put them in a 10" round baking dish. Then put them in the refrigerator over night with a damp towel over them. In the morning I took them out of the frig. and let them raise. Then baked them when company arrived! Super thank you so much!!!

These were fantastic!  I've never made cinnamon rolls before.  So this was a challenge I wanted to take on.  With time off during the holidays I wanted to try new things.  My whole family loved these rolls!!  They were easy to make and came out darn near perfect.  
I'm not sure if my yeast was "instant" or not.  It didn't say that on the package, it just said yeast.  This being my first time ever even using yeast I was unsure.  But they still came out great.  I used dental floss to cut the cinnamon rolls after trying one first w/ a knife.  The floss worked like a DREAM!  I also baked these in two 8 inch round cake pans.  I actually came out with 13 instead of 12.  After they were done I topped them off with the cream cheese/butter frosting recipe that MPCHARVAT, another reviewer had mentioned and that just made these rolls EVEN better!

Adding just a few pinches of nutmeg and a pinch of ground orange peel in with the cinnamon made these very good.  Cinnamon was still prominent, but the other spices added interest and produced a decadent smell from the oven.  I placed these on a 9X13 and got along fine.

OMG! These sweet delights are a sure winner! I would consider myself an experienced baker, but like a few posters have admitted, I am SO intimidated by anything at ALL having to do with Y-E-A-S-T! And, I'll be the first to tell you, I have made some total F-L-O-P-S in the past when it comes to cinnamon rolls. But this recipe was easy and with very pleasing results. I actually let mine rise way longer than the suggested time, almost an hour and a half! But those babies got SOooooo big, you wouldn't believe. I kept them moist by covering them with damp papertowels. And when I popped them outta the oven, my sister ate one before I had a chance to ice them and she loved them; saying they were like sticky buns! (And my sis is my tuffest critic!) The only thing is, I wished I had a pic to add. By the way, mine looked exactly like the pic at the top of this recipe. So if you're on the fence about this one--don't be. You'll be amazed at how fast they disappear!

I've been looking for a good and easy recipe for cinnamon rolls because my husband loves them.  These are GREAT.  Or, as my husband called them, KILLER, lol.  I did make a few changes that were suggested.  I used butter and added chopped pecans. I didn't have enough brown sugar so I substitued half with white sugar and added the recommended 2 TBSP of cinnamon for the filling.  Baked them for 15 minutes on two cookie sheets and I'm glad I did because they got huge!  Absolutely fantastic.  This is a wonderful recipe.

I made these the yesterday morning. Put 12 in a 12x9 pan... there's only 4 left! Oh my! Iced some with cream cheese icing, and the other half with some lemon icing I had left over in the freezer. Made for an interesting flavor!  Baked for 15 min, then checked and let it go 2 more. Flipped the whole pan out upside down and iced the bottoms. Cooled. Then slid the whole thing back into the pan (cleaned) and snapped the lid on for storage. I used regular yeast (not the instant). I let it soak for 15 min with the 1/4 cup of water and 1 tsp of the sugar. Everything else the same. Next time I might add a drop of vanilla.

These cinnamon rolls are super easy and truly delicious, I added golden raisins as well as walnuts to mine , I substituted the milk with Almond/Coconut milk since I don't use regular milk - my kids, parents and husband are pleading for me to make more, needless to say I totally endorse this recipe , thanks for sharing !

These turned out perfectly! I was worried they'd be dense, because of the rising time (and because I used half white whole wheat flour), but they're gooey and fluffy.  They also had amazing oven spring! Going in the oven, they were tiny and pitiful (I have terrible roll-shaping skills), but they came out about twice as large. Great recipe!

Made these for Easter breakfast. They are soooo good!! In an effort to be a bit healthier, I used 90% fresh ground white wheat flour, and replaced white sugar with sugar in the raw. I used butter rather than margarine & eliminated the raisins. I used my dough hook to mix dough. The dough was easy to work with, and rolls turned out beautifully! Will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing!!

I am inexperienced with yeast doughs, but this recipe turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (made them in a 9x13 pan), but found that it needs more cinnamon and could do with less brown sugar (as other reviewers suggested).  I'll make these again, but with some adjustments and cream cheese icing.  Overall, it was a fantastic first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls and very easy.

Great recipe. I was looking for a recipe that didn't involve waiting overnight and this was it! I was afraid of how this would turn out at first as I have never made cinnamon rolls before and I am addicted, as are the kids and hubby! My daughter made me make extra to take back to college with her! I will never use prepared again. I followed other suggestions about 9 x 13 pan and cream cheese frosting and they were wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

These were good even though mine didnt double in size. (old yeast) I also over cooked mine by 5 minutes. The kids still loved them.  Will try again with fresher ingredients and not let the "doughy" apppearance keep them in the oven longer than needed.  Even with my mistakes these were good and easy with no bread machine.

These were amazing cinnamon rolls that my entire family adored. They were gone in no time and I couldn't help making more! Who wouldn't with such a quick and easy recipe? The only changes I made was to use 3/4 cup of half and half (I was a bit low on milk) and using Blue Bonnet spread (we don't use margarine often and I was out of unsalted butter). I drizzled each roll with a cream cheese icing [1 cup of powdered sugar, 8 ounce package of cream cheese, 5 tablespoons of butter, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract (stirred together from a softened, room temperature state)]. I did use a muffin tin and I had no problems with the filling bubbling out like other reviewers. The rolls are so pretty and they taste even better. Absolutely fantastic!

I admit I was skeptical when I saw 90 minutes to make cinnamon rolls, however my curiosity got the better of me. I’ve made many recipes where the yeast was added directly to the flour and not proofed and they came out wonderfully so that didn’t concern me.    I had much the same experience as reviewer Mominmi. After 30 minutes, they were still pretty much the same size.  I waited an additional 30 minutes, saw no visible results, so I popped them in the oven.  During the baking process they did double in size.  The rolls have good flavor but are a little more dense and therefore I will stick with my TNT cinnamon roll recipe, however if you are in a time crunch and yearning for a cinnamon bun this would work very well.

My dough did not rise. As others already stated DO NOT add your yeast to the dry ingredients. Proof it first then add it. The flavor was bleh too. I'll keep looking for another CR recipe.

The best ever! These were so good. To make less fat in the whole thing but just as moist, just whip 1/2 stick of softened butter and 1/4 cup water (make sure you add the water in gradually while whipping). Use half the butter mixture in the dough and half with the cinnamon sugar. It worked beautifully, and it cut the amount of fat (from the margarine/butter) from 7.6 grams to 3.8 grams. The only other thing I did differently was to put the rolls in a 9x13 inch baking pan. I decreased the oven temperature to 350 (25 degrees less) and cooked them for 20 min. The centers were cooked and the tops were not charred. :) Delicious.

I tried this recipe twice because I figured I had it wrong the first time since the reviews were so amazing.  However, the second batch was just like the first - the dough was really dense and didn't rise well.  I don't know what I did wrong - I followed the instructions exactly, and the second batch I let the rolls rest for an hour and half before cooking them.  My yeast was brand new.

Made this and followed the recipe almost exactly. The bread turned out to be really soft and moist and the filling was perfect!  I found that a lot of times, the filling will leak out during baking so I added 1/4 cup of flour to the filling during mixing and the filling stayed inside. The filling tastes wonderful so the flour didn't affect the taste, just the runnyiness (if such a word exists...).

This was fantastic, and I didn't even have to add icing! I did use the active dry yeast instead of instant, but just proofed it before adding it to the mixed like others suggested. I halved the recipe because the recipe makes rolls that are rather large. It is important to note that the milk mixture (and the water you use to proof if you are using regular yeast) is lukewarm and not hot. I messed up my first version by using liquids that were too hot-- they killed the yeast. This second (successful) time, by accident, I raised the dough before shaping it into the cinnamon roll shape, so that when they rose a second time in the pan, they came all unformed. Next time I will make sure to rise the dough only once time. But those are my errors. The recipe is great. Those cinnamon rolls are delicious! I will make this again.

I read several reviews so I decided I would make these for breakfast this morning. I have mad many batches of Cinnamon rolls for at least the last 20 years. I have had a batch with this texture. I am not saying these were awful but they weren’t exactly brad like either. I found them to be more biscuits like and taking over the 1 1/2 hours to come out of the oven I would say I would use my recipe for quick bread and have almost the same thing in less than an hour. I think I will stick to my regular recipe and they don't don’t have that much more work. Yes they have to rise twice for almost an hour each time, but I but I do other things during that time, so really I am multitasking. I will say my husband enjoyed them. I didn’t use all the butter called for in the recipe so I didn’t have a messy oven and I use unsalted butter in most all of my cooking and baking makes for a "truer" flavour and I am on a salt restricted diet so I save the salt where I can. I did let this recipe rise for 30 minutes the first time because it just seemed so dense and like the gluten hadn't relaxed enough and the second rising almost an hour. Yeast still takes time to develop. I do use my oven to rise dough’s, I turn my oven on till it reaches 100 degrees or less turn it off and leave the light on keeps just enough heat so bread dough’s rise beautiful and away from drafts.

SOOO good! I wish I could say mine came out as pretty as the picture, but I didn't take them out when I should have (busy w/ the kids) and they were a bit dark. But still, amazing! I frosted them w/ cream cheese frosting. Mine took longer to rise (about 50 min) but that's ok. Will be making these again for sure!

These rolls were awesome! They came out soft, gooey and delicious and I found that I enjoyed them better without added the frosting (I frosted half and left half plain) I also lined my muffin pan with holders before baking and placed the muffin pan on a cookie sheet in the oven. This worked very well because some of the brown sugar mixture did flow over the edges and I removed the rolls with ease from the muffin pan and simply removed the holder, they looked beautiful and tasted great! I put lots of raisins in mine and I enjoyed them a lot. Will definitely make again!

I got up this morning and began this recipe at 8:00 a.m.  True to the recipe title, they were done in 90 minutes!  The dough was soft and flavorful and not too sweet.  Much of the brown sugar mixture melted out of the rolls so next time (and there will be a next time!)I'll reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 c.  I'll bake them in a 9 x 13-inch pan and but place a few chopped pecans in the bottom before I put the rolls in.  When the brown sugar mixture melts out, it will combine with the pecans and make a "sticky bun" cinnamon roll. Then I'll invert the rolls onto a serving platter.  I can't wait!

Fast, easy and they even look like Cinnabon..

The rolls were delicious and I loved that it didn't take hours to prepare and raise.  They were easy and quick for a sudden craving for cinnamon rolls.  I wouldn't use this recipe for when you are making more than just a few rolls though.

the first time cinnamon rolls have turned out for me! I've made them at least a dozen times already! I prefer to bake them in a regular pan, not muffin tins, they keep a better shape that way. And they don't take me much longer 90 minutes!!! Love them!!

This recipe was overall very good.  The dough is very soft and moist, perfect for cinnamon rolls.  I think the trick is to knead it a long time.  Instead of kneading by hand 5 minutes, I let my KitchenAid mixer knead it for 5 minutes and the result was what I've always wanted in a cinnamon roll, but have never been able to create until now. The reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of five is because the brown sugar filling was still very granular after baking, and I definitely prefer an ooey-gooey filling.  I will keep this as my recipe for the dough and figure out some alteration for the brown sugar mixture.  Very simple:)

This recipe was excellent/rose high/and also fast and easy to make. Grandchildren loved it. I have made many cinnamon buns through the years but this is fabulous. Only cooked for 15 minutes, waited until browned. Make sure you keep an eye on it.

I made these yesterday.  I had to use regular yeast, so mine took much longer than 90 minutes.  I added the salt and sugar to the milk and butter.  I proofed the yeast with very warm water and a teaspoon of sugar for 5 minutes or so.  Then mixed together along with the flour.  I added a glaze when i took them out of the oven.  The glaze was powdered sugar, a little butter, vanilla, and a tiny amount of milk. My husband really liked these.  I did find, however, the next day they were not as good.  They were already getting hard, despite my having packaged them as soon as they were cool.  I'll keep looking for a cinnamon roll recipe that will hold up for a few days.

NEED TO USE INSTANT YEAST!!!!

As a novice baker, this recipe seemed like a good place to start. Like many others, my dough failed to rise. After doing a little detective work, I discovered that I had used ACTIVE DRY yeast, and not the INSTANT YEAST called for in the recipe. I had no idea that there were two different types of dry yeast packets, as they all look the same to me. I think the recipe would benefit from a clarifying note about yeast types.

I'd also agree with other users that the muffin trays are too small, I'll use a normal pan if I try them again.

Easy to make - Tasted great, added powered sugar glaze on top - You lose some of the filling as it melts towards the bottom of the muffin pan, I let them cool for 5mins then transferred them and spooned some the cinnamon sugar back on.  Will make again!

I have made oodles of cinnamon rolls over many years. These will be THE recipe forever now. I made them in a 9 x 13 pan because of all the warnings about the filling spilling out. I did add some fresh nutmeg to the filling, about a half tsp. Next time I may add a whole tsp. I made them the evening before I wanted to serve them and put them in the fridge overnight. Let them sit out about an hour before baking them. Oh, and I let them rise the first time about an hour instead of the 10 minutes. That was because the yeast I used said "rapid rise, active dry yeast" instead of "instant" on the pkg. I wanted to make sure it was fully hydrated. These were fabulous.

Followed the instructions except made in my kitchen aid with a dough hook.  Instead of needing by hand ran for 2 min on level 2.  Used a Pyrex pan instead of muffin pan and baked for 25 min.  Really happy with how they baked up not overly dry or gooey but just right.  Left out the raisins.

I did not like this recipe at all. I'm not sure what I did wrong, because this recipe has so many other positive reviews. 

First of all, the recipe does not call for nearly enough flour. I followed it exactly and the "dough" was more of a watery paste. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour, but the consistency was still extremely thin; I couldn't knead it without adding yet more flour in the process. I thought about just scrapping it at this point but I didn't want to waste my ingredients.

The taste of the dough was really off. It was not sweet in any way, even though I added extra sugar to offset the extra flour. Basically, it was tasteless. I did make some cream cheese frosting as another reviewer suggested and poured that over the top...still very underwhelming.

These were less than impressive, which is sad because I was so excited for cinnamon rolls in just 90 minutes! The two stars are because they did come out of the oven as bread-like objects and because they smelled really good while cooking...but I won't make them again. :(

Crust was dry, dough didn't really have much flavor.  Consistency of bread was almost tough and heavy.  Didn't like it.  Not worth the time.

Notes: I used a 9" round cheesecake pan however I don't think this caused the problem.

Okay, so I MUST have done something wrong but I don't know what. I almost never follow recipes exactly, but because I'm new to baking, I made sure I followed everything to the letter. Everything was going along fine, until I went to knead the dough. It was SO SO SO sticky, it stuck to the floured surface, my hands, everything.  I had to add at least another 1/4 cup of flour to get it to work. When I finally rolled it out to 12" x 9", I found that the amount of filling was WAY too much, like by 1/3 to 1/2 too much. When I rolled up my dough, a ton of it gushed out and made a huge mess. This took me about 2 hours altogether, and the texture was not "gooey" at all but more like a cross between bread and a proper cinnamon roll. I'd really like to try this again, because almost 1000 positive reviews can't be wrong. I wish I knew what happened!

AMAZING!! I usually make quick, no rise cinnamon rolls, but never again!  These were fantastic and my family loved them!  I iced them with icing made from 2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c softened butter, 1 t vanilla, 1.5 cups powdered sugar, pinch salt. Frost while warm...seriously good stuff!

OUTSTANDING! I am a good cook but a poor baker. this recipe made me a good baker. I did change it: substituted butter instead of margarine and let is rise longer than the recipe based upon my experience making bread. I used my stand up mixer on the stir setting mixed it longer. I cannot believe how light and professional it came out.

I will have to try it a second time, with the correct yeast.  I didn't have "instant" yeast, so I used regular yeast, adding it along with the dry ingredients, which I thought was strange.  Of course, the dough didn't rise.  I went ahead and made them anyway, thinking I'd throw them out.  They were dense, but good.  A friend came to my house as I was pulling them out and announced they were "out of this world."  I can only imagine how great they would have been had they risen. :)

Easy, outstanding recipe. I made these with some cream cheese icing and prepared them in a 9x13 baking dish. I had to bake them about five minutes longer than prescribed, but they came out amazing - perfectly gooey and sweet. The whole family loved them. They taste like what Cinnabon used to before it became the processed, chemical monstrosity it is now.

These were amazing! I made as directed except I doubled the cinnamon and used sweetened unsalted butter to spread on the dough. Then I sprinkled with the brown sugar mixture and raisins. I also baked them in a 9x13 baking dish. I ended up with 13 rolls and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing!!!

Wonderful recipe - went together easily. I used 2/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 AP flour. I also added chopped almonds to the raisin/sugar mix. Turned out beautifully. We flipped it to serve so all the goey goodness was on top of the rolls.

I have made this recipe almost every day for the past week.  My family absolutely loves it.  I made a cream cheese topping for the top.  Also laid them on a cookie sheet close together.  It works great.  Am making 4 recipes of it for a hockey party for one of my kids.  I am raising the dough for 40 mins and then freezing it so I can cook it fresh in 2 days.

Cause i cant do 4.5..... recipe was perfect i was looking for something to make with instant yeast i had and these we DELICIOUS.... i added toasted pecans as well as raisins. Also i made a quick butter+brown sugar+vanilla sauce that i added to the bottom of the pan (13 by 9) before i placed the sliced dough before i let it rise, made a sticky bun if you will..... it was gone within the hour but would have been gone sooner if everyone was awake when i made them :-D

These were quite easy to make in the muffin tin.  The cinnamon turned out gooey.  It was delicious.  I only used butter, not margarine in all parts of the recipe.  I have experience making bread by hand which I think helped when it came to kneading the dough.  Just sprinkle flour as you go to eliminate wetness.

I used this recipe for the first time and it turned out great! I found the sugar to be too much and cut it down to 3/4 cup brown sugar, and also used brown sugar in the dough instead of the white sugar. I didn't put any cream cheese frosting, the rolls were sweet enough! I sprinkled cocoa powder before rolling the dough, it gave an extra layer of taste.

OMG this is the most delicious cinnamon roll Ive ever took a bite out of. I searched and searched for the perfect recipe and none of them were good enough and Im so happy I came across this one. It is definately a keeper. The only changes I made was I added more white sugar to the mixture and more cinnamon to the filling cuz I love my sweets to be very sweet! I baked them in a 9x13 pan and had no problems. Amazing!

These cinnamon rolls are to die for.  My husband could not stop raving about them - he said they were even better than rolls we used to buy at a gourmet bakery.   I had tried other recipes in the past but none compares to this one.
I used a 9X13 pan instead of a muffin pan, and I also took someone's modified recipe suggestion of 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 brown sugar for the filling instead of the 1/2 cup of each.  This is definetely going to be my only cinnamon roll recipe from now on.

These were just okay.  My family definitely prefers the old fashioned long rise sweet dough.  They kinda have that cinnamon roll in a tube taste rather than homemade goodness.

Delicious bread, rose well, too much sugar mix so it got too goopy. I ended up making a loaf instead of rolls and it tastes yummy. I will just cut down on the amount of spread and roll the dough out more thinly next time.

I love that these rolls are so fast AND delicious! I frosted with MPCHARVAT's icing: 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup softened margarine, 2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp salt. YUM!

Very simple & delicious recipe!  I used Sucanat instead of brown sugar and added chopped walnuts.  It took ~ 45 minutes of proofing in a warm location for the rolls to double in size.  The 9x13" pan worked very well.

Very good, very fast compared to other recipes and tasty. Just add a few drops of vanilla extract to the dough and don't make the mistake of rolling them too thin like I did as they won't rise/grow too much. Over all very good.

These are pretty simple if you've worked with dough before.  I made mine in an 8x8 inch pan and they turned out great.  I topped them with icing right after they came out of the oven.  I baked mine a bit longer then the recipe called .

These were simple and delicious.  They were a tad bit too sweet, but still 5 star worthy because that was likely due to adding frosting.  Next time I will keep the frosting and only use 1/2C sugar in the filling.  For the frosting, I used: 1/4 C softened cream cheese, 3T milk, 2t lemon juice and 1C sifted powdered sugar.  I then poured over the hot rolls and let cool before eating.

Incredible recipe the whole family loves!  Almost have it memorized I have made it so often.  Just recently made a double batch and put half in the freezer.  Put dough in fridge over night to thaw and followed directions from #4 on...came out just right!  I only use butter however and haven't used raisins.

I love and recomend this recipe. It was extremely easy to make, the pastry tasted lovely, my family loves them.  The only change I made to this recipe was for the filling of the rolls, I used about 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 1/2 cup of margarine, and they came out just fine, also added the optional raisins, they made them so moist.  Ty for this recipe, is a keeper.

Wonderful yeasty tasting traditional recipe. I've made it several times & we like it best in a large 9x13 baking pan or 12 inch springform pan, so that the rolls form soft sides up against each other. For more crispy sides use the muffin tins.  I like to use a sprinkling of pecans or sliced almonds in the rolls, and top with a simple cream cheese frosting (not too much!) or powdered sugar glaze (hot milk & powdered sugar).  I generally make the recipe the night before --  as far as placing the rolls in a pan, then refrigerate to stop the rising. I take them out the next morning & bring to room temp, then they will rise per recipe (this takes about 2 hours or more). Then you can bake them per recipe & serve fresh as tho you got up at 5 am to make them. Don't forget the drizzle of cream cheese frosting.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe.  I kept thinking I should use a rectangular pan instead of muffin tins, like many other reviewers did, but I wanted to follow the recipe the first time.  The dough didn't seem to rise a whole lot, but I popped them in the oven anyway - they rose beautifully while baking, and the muffin tins gave them a nice shape, the centers popping up slightly.  However, virtually all the cinnamon-sugar mixture melted away...and bubbled over the tops of the muffin pans...and onto the bottom of my oven.   Smoke detectors blaring, I realized the muffins themselves were not burnt, just the leaking sugar mixture, so I removed them from the pans to see if they could be salvaged.  They could, but only with icing.  The flavor was good - not as soft as I was expecting, but the dough part is not overly sweet at all - had the filling managed to stay in the buns, I think these would have been great.   But next time, I'll try using a baking pan!

I hate to be the lone dissenter here (and normally I pretty much agree with the consensus), but I tried these and found them way too sweet...so sweet that I couldn't eat one whole.  If I try again, I'd cut the sugar literally in half.

Wonderful. If you dont have instant yeast do this : use the same amount for active dry yeast mix it with the water (warm) and add a little sugar. Then add it to flour and the rest of the ingredients that way u activate the yeast.  I baked mine in a 9×12 pan  I don't recommend baking them in cupcake pan because the sugar cinnamon mix will bubble up and spill plus they will come out softer.

These cinnamon rolls were well worth the extra work. I followed the recipe exactly. I was a little concerned that my rolls didn't double in size when they were rising on the counter, but once they went in the oven they poofed right up. I also topped them with cream cheese frosting which made them extra special and yummy.

Big hit and relatively easy! If I were to make this again, I would try adding yeast to the warm milk and margarine mixture.  Compared to "Clone of Cinnabon " besides being faster, I liked 'tear-away' texture of the roll whereas my judge & jury preferred the bread/bun taste of clone. Even those without sweet tooth will enjoy these.

Followed recipe as written, majority of the cinnamon filling ran out/over flowed while in the oven resulting in rather dry and bland little cinnamon buns. I may try and make them again to see if I was off, as they seem to have gotten great reviews from many others....

I have tried the most popular recipe for rolls on this site, and I dare say this one is better. It is quick, and produces nice, soft cinnamon rolls (I had a problem with the hard texture that the rolls from the previous recipe had). This is my go-to recipe from now on. The rolls came out so yummy, I had 2 in one sitting (and had to try really hard to stop myself from having a third one)! I made no modifications.

Nothing wrong with this recipe- just not as gooey or moist as I would have liked.  Fit well in a 9x13, but I cooked it for 30 min. at 190.  Next time I will place extra pads of butter on top to make more moist.  These demand a glaze on top so I used the one from Overnight Cinnamon Rolls I.  Also, next time I will roll them really thin and long so they get more rotations in them.

Well, these are pretty fantastic.  I used my kitchen aid bread dough hook, worked perfectly.  I even put another 1/4 cup butter in the dough, but it still tasted great!  Glazed em with orange glaze.  My 16 year old ate three and thought I was a god.  Only was to talk him into getting started on his homework early today!  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at a cinnamon roll ever, I haven't even made a bread before (with yeast).  I actually did this with no trouble, it's simple and really only takes 90 minutes TOPS!  I put them in a 9X13" pan to bake and I also made the cream cheese icing that was suggested.  They were very loved and gobbled up!

I tried baking it in a pan instead of in a muffin tray and it turns out beautifully.One comment thought I might add that this dough is incredibly wet when I tried to knead it,so I ended up adding perhaps another half of cup of flour.Great recipe!Delish

For the time spent preparing these cinnamon rolls, it is a great recipe. I did change the margarine to butter (I never bake with margarine).  Also, I baked the rolls in a 9x13 pan instead of muffin tins because I've always liked the inside rolls versus the hard outside edges and I was afraid the outsides would get too hard in the tins.  All in all, this is a good fast recipe when you're craving cinnamon rolls.

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and butter.  The rolls had good flavor but were heavy.  I am going to try other recipes that let the dough rise for a longer period of time and see if that would make the roll lighter.

The reason I tried this recipe was because of the ninety minutes - which does hold true.  I baked them in a pan rather than the cupcake tins (I'm not sure which would be best to be honest).  I found them to be more of a heavy, cake-like texture than light.  All of the spread pretty much melts right out when they are baking which left them a little bland (probably why a lot of people put the frosting on them).  The ninety minutes seems like a good thing but I should've known that you just can't rush a good dough.  I won't be trying these again.

I was pretty impressed by the way these turned out, they were delicious!! I added some walnuts into mine instead of the raisins and baked them in the muffin tray which is a great idea instead of trying to tear them apart from eachother. I would suggest putting a tray under the muffin tin while baking though because the filling tends to bubble over quite a bit. I think next time I'll cut the filling back to 1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar, but I'll keep the cinnamon the same.

These are very good for quick dough rolls. It did take about 90 minutes, and it was well worth it if you're short on time for a tasty breakfast treat. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dough. My only complaint was that the sugar filling became hard after cooling and they weren't gooey.

This recipe turns out delicous every time!  I like to put a very thin glaze on top when they are warm which only improves the wonderfull ooey gooeyness.

These didnt take quite ninety minutes which was great! They turned out beautifully and my guy really likes them. I cant believe how big they got in the oven, I thought you all might have been exagerating!! Pretty good overall, I would add more cinnamon next time though.

The best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!  I mixed the dough with the dough-hook on my kitchen aid and never kneaded it by hand.  I had to add about 1/4 c extra flour because the dough was very sticky, but it was also a humid day. I also used  butter instead of margarine, and omitted the raisins. I baked them in a 9 x 13 buttered pan and they turned out great.  Took a little longer than 30 minutes to double, but continued to rise during baking.  I topped them with a powdered sugar icing and they were great!  Got rave reviews from my husband and brothers :)

Great EASY recipe, perfect for beginners.  I added a bit of nutmeg and vanilla to the recipe, and added a simple icing made of confectionary sugar, milk, and vanilla.  You can't buy any better from the store!

These are amazing! I can't make enough! I don't have a large muffin tin, and an earlier attempt in a smaller tin left me with a mess in my oven. So, I resorted to using a 13/9 baking dish. The results are still excellent! I found a recipe on this site for cream cheese frosting that makes these extra special. My family, friends...everyone loves these.

I doubled the filling and made six giant rolls from the recipe.  I made a glaze of 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 Tbsp. corn syrup and some half & half to thin it out.  These are definitely best when eaten the same day.  Thanks for the recipe.

The best recipie EVER!  Almost foolproof.  I took others advice and halved the filling part of the recipie plus added a dash of nutmeg.  I also topped it with cream cheese frosting using 1/4 C butter, 3/4 C. powdered sugar, 1/8 C cream cheese and 1/4 t vanilla.  Mmmmmm....de-lish!  I ate three myself after they came out of the oven.

It was a pretty good recipe; the filling was delicious, but the dough was just bland. No flavour,  no sweetness, just bland dough. The filling was really needed. I personally did not think putting them in muffin liners would work(maybe because mine were somehow bigger than the recipe said), so I put mine on a cookie sheet instead. Now I see that was a better choice. The butter in the filling melted everywhere! It would of completely soaked the muffin liners. And one small note- DO NOT MAKE THESE WITH WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR!!!!!!!! :) Probably why mine where so bland! ;)

Made these yesterday and they were AWESOME! Everyone ate them up in minutes. Even my boyfriend said they were the best thing Iv ever made from scratch, and he never eats sweets. So good a second batch in the oven now. I do suggest a 9 x 13 pan the sugar tends to bubble up a lot.

I wish I had more stars to give. Found this recipe 4 months ago, & I make a new batch every week since. Perfect recipe. I've tried it with butter,tried it with margarine,tried it using half of each...It's perfectly perfect can't screw up. I add cinnamon to the dry ingredients,because I'm special like that Lol,but this is my joint point blank and the period. Didn't care for the raisins in it. However I do think I'm going to try adding them to the dry ingredients &no filing...just like cinnamon raisin bread...yummmers

These taste Delicious and come out so tender soft.  I always get compliments when I bake them.  I use butter instead of margarine and use a 9x11 baking dish instead of muffins cups. ***I make sure the butter is squishy soft now because my arm about fell off with shoulder attached when it's not.  LOL*** Plus, I use the inside of the butter wrapper to butter the baking dish.  I prepare the recipe and place it in the baking dish, cover dish with Saran wrap, and let it sit out on dining room table overnight. In the morning:  I preheat oven, remove Saran wrap, and bake them.  PERFECT every time.

I've made this a couple of times now, and it's super easy (for a yeast bread recipe, that is) and the rolls came out fluffy and tender. Only change I made was using butter instead of margarine as that is what I had on hand. I also did the 9x13 pan instead of the muffin cup. I made a cream cheese frosting for after they came out and the rolls were better than Cinnabon. (Cinnabon is way too gooey/undercooked in the middle of the roll--these aren't)

I'm going to try this dough for monkeybread. I don't see why it wouldn't work and would be a lot easier and faster than other homemade recipes for monkey bread.

I baked these In a 9x13 greased and lightly floured pan.  I added a small amount of frosting after rolls cooled.

Really terrific recipe ! I  used butter instead of margarine , and I added chopped pecans instead of raisins.
These are soft , moist and taste very very good. Not sugary sweet, and they don't have an overpowering yeast taste to them like many cinnamon rolls and sticky buns do. I was careful not to over bake. So I baked initially for 15 minutes, then checked every two minutes until each was golden brown. I baked each one in separate lightly buttered parchment paper cups. The bottoms developed a nice thin gooey caramelized layer from the brown sugar ! An unexpected plus !
I'll make these again and again. They take a little effort ( 5 mins of kneading) and you need to give it a little rising time, but these are worth every minute of effort . Excellent ! 
Note: I HIGHLY recommend " The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing " recipe by Cara. It really is perfect and easy... Not too sweet and it has a wonderful creamy flavor and body to it.

I have made this recipe twice and both times was amazed by how well these come together. I love that these are homemade-worth the time it takes. If your a new cook don't be afraid to try this, be sure to follow the recipe exactly, you will surprise yourself.  
Tip - chop walnuts to add to filling instead of raisins for a different flavor. Since there are only two in the household and my husband will eat them in two days if I leave them out, I am freezing these in sections of four to have as a quick breakfast or afternoon snack. I hope they freeze well. Will let you all know how it turns out.

Very delicious, my family devoured all 40 cinnamon rolls within 24 hours. I doubled the recipe. There are ten people here. I iced a few and left the rest un-iced and they were delicious either way. I will definitely be making this again, it's a fantastic recipe!

Edit: I recommend using parchment paper on the bottom of the pan rather than spraying it with cooking spray. I made one pan with the cooking spray and the other 3  lined with parchment paper and the one with cooking spray was caramelized on the bottom, still tasty though, the ones made on the parchment paper were perfect.

This is a great recipe!  The cinnamon rolls were delicious, and I mean were because they are practically gone! I followed the recipe exactly and then added some icing (powdered sugar and a few teaspoons of water mix).  Yummy!  They rise up to a nice size and bake at that size, no shrinkage.  My Hubby had three in one sitting!  Delicious.  Would definitely recommend.

These cinnamon rolls turned out perfect. Soft and chewy.  I loved the filling.  My family ate them so fast and wanted more.  I will be doubling the recipe next time. Thank you for a winner!

Fast!  Fun to work up!  Learned a lot about making a nice, quick dough.  This filling is very nice - but when I make these anymore, I use the 'clone of a cinnabon' filling using raw sugar isntead of this recipe's filling...., either way has resulted in rave reviews, I just prefer the other filling.

This was best recipe for cinnamon rolls, but took it a step further! Omitted the sugar, added garlic powder, parsley and oregano. Made pizza sauce. Rolled out like recommended and instead of cinnamon mix I used pizza sauce, topped w/ mozzarella and toppings (mushroom & pepperoni) rolled up, sliced and baked like recipe! Came out delicious!! Used pizza sauce as dipping sauce!!

I always read a recipe and the reviews before I make it. This one has a method which calls for putting the yeast in with the salt. Salt can kill yeast according to my bread machine book and Julia Child. I believe the failures (1 star reviews) originate from the salt/yeast issue along with the small space allowed by most muffin tins. I held out the salt until the yeast had been incorporated and baked in an ordinary 9" by 11" pan. I also used more cinnamon and some pecans along with the raisins. This made good cinnamon rolls.

Way too much filling and the dough came out a little tough.  Use the 1/2 C in the dough and the 1/4 C in the filling and it should come out perfect.  I'll try it again and update the review.

I usually make a cinnamon roll recipe that rises overnight in the refrigerator for Christmas morning, but in the hustle and bustle this year I forgot to make them.  I woke up about 2 hours before the kids and realized I'd goofed.  I found this recipe and thought it was worth a shot.  I received so many compliments on these - my nieces and nephews argued over the last couple of rolls. They were tender and soft, perfectly cinnamon-y and rose to be light and fluffy.  I'm switching recipes permanently!

Very easy and fast! I made them just as described - in an extra-large muffin tin. I did use half and half instead of milk because I had it on hand. I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from some cupcakes made earlier in the week. This is a fantastic recipe.

oh my!  These are the best cinnamon rolls!  This was the first time I tried cooking with yeast and I don't have a bread maker so I was a little nervous, but they turned out amazing!  Have made them twice and plan on making them again this week as my family can't get enough.  I baked mine in a 9x13 pan as some other reviews suggested and they baked perfect.  I added a delicious cream cheese icing (also from this site) and I think they're better than cinnabon!  This recipe is a must try in my opinion and I will never buy canned cinnamon rolls again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

- continued from previous post.
... The filling didn't have a cinnamon taste that was over powering, and the actual doughy part of the rolls were moist, and sweet. Not bland or too doughy. It tasted and kind of looked like the actual cinnamon rolls you get from the shops.

Of course it takes longer than 90 minutes to make (it took about 2 hours for me - plus cooking and kneading time), but this is the quickest cinnamon roll recipe you'll ever find that will give you good and delicious results.

Try it!

Oh by the way, instead of using a damp tea towel/cloth to cover the dough/rolls when they are rising, just spray some cooking spray of vegetable oil over some cling film, and use that to cover a bowl with the dough/rolls, and also put some damp used kitchen roll over the cling film. It rises just as well.

I absolutely loved this recipe, it was so easy to make and they turned out delicious! I took a lot of people's advice and cooked them in a baking dish and that worked extremely well. My husband loves sweets and was very excited to try these, I'm sure I will be making these quite often. I left them sit in the refrigerator overnight too since I got into baking them at a late hour, and they still turned out perfect. Yummy yummy recipe!

These were really good. I added pecans and diced up apples to the butter brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. I made them the night before, and used a 9x13 pyrex dish. The next morning while they were baking I made a cream cheese frosting. Everyone in the family loved these! I will be making them again for sure!

yes i have tried this and it is so easy. I have made cinnamon Rolls before but never in 90min. so yea it was great, my family made sure they didn't last long though. As for the drip tray underneath while in the oven, well it does mention that in the video, but i have one in the oven all the time for no matter what i cook. saves cleaning.

Followed to a "t", this recipe yielded a spectacular cinnamon roll. I drizzled a cream-cheese glaze overtop the rolls and the end-result was magical.

I love this recipe. 
I've made it at least 4 times now 
and its the only recipe that actually works for me. 

I let the dough rest 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes
and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

So scrumptious! They are fluffy, just the right texture and so easy to make! I took other reader's advice and used a 9x13 pan to bake them in and they turned out wonderfully! I can never roll cinnamon rolls correctly and always cut them really badly, and I did the same here too, but when they rose in the pan they all ended up the same size and looked devine! I have always used my mom's old fashioned recipe for years, where I have to let the dough raise, punch it down and let it raise again, which is fine, but takes forever (and the rolls sometimes end up dry), but this recipe took a lot less time, were very easy to make and are just delicious! My 4 year old shared one with me too and said they are the best cinnamon rolls I ever made! (I had some cream cheese frosting for them too, but I ate mine without it because they are just that good!) Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Wonderful.  Very simple to make, and I always have the ingredients on hand.  Simplicity makes this my go to recipe.  Very tender.  I would suggest adding this cinnamon glaze after baking: 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, 1/4 cup of butter, melt over medium heat in a saucepan.  Add a simple icing if you like fancy.  I would also suggest baking in a 12 in round pan to keep them even more moist and tender insad of the muffin pan.

This cinnamon roll recipe is my GO TO recipe for this treat!  These are soft and moist and I covered mine with foil and sat them on the kitchen counter with the oven on low. I let them rise about 3hrs and they were HUGE when I put them in the oven! I baked them at 350 until they were golden brown. Great great GREAT cinnamon rolls!

I made these and it took me a bit longer than 90 minutes, though prep time was short. The cinnamon roll was moist and soft, and kept soft after sitting on the counter for a few hours. You can just warm them up in the microwave. Also, this recipe makes an excess amount of filling, but it oozes out during baking and makes a great sauce on the bottom of the pan. Also, because of that, use a 13 x9 pan. Works very well. 
More modifications:
-Doubled the cinnamon
-Let the rolls rise for a little more than an hour until they actually doubled
(could be my weather or my yeast)
But I followed everything else to a tee and it was great! I might try browning the butter next time, found the idea on a blog.

WOW. These (and my family can agree with this) cinnamon rolls were the best I've ever had! I followed the directions the the T and my my my... these were yummy. I ate 6. Seriously. 

I made my own cream cheese icing, but the rolls were the life of the party. Soft, warm, and fluffy. I did use a little bit of condensed sweetened milk, and  real butter instead of margarine. 

Anyways, this gets 5 stars. I'll definitely make it again!

This was simply outstanding. I have made many cinnamon rolls from this website and none are as soft and fast as these! Thank you so much!

The only thing I would recommend is adding a bit of corn syrup or honey to the sugar and butter mixture because it still was a bit grainy. . But maybe that was just my oven since it runs alittle cold.

Don't over bake these and for me a 9x13 is the best way to bake. Well worth it for Sunday after dinner dessert! My husband and I could not stop eating them! Thank you : )

Loved this recipe.  I am VERY new to baking with yeast and I was pleased as punch with how these cinnamon rolls turned out.  I made as written and opted out of using the raisins.  The results were a soft, gooey, delicious roll.  My DH couldn't believe that I had made rolls.  Served these with "It's Chili by George!!" from this site.  Most certainly will be making these again.

Easy recipe and tastes good too.  My first batch of dough came out a bit tough.  Will add more liquids or reduce flour by a bit next time.  Also, will add cinnamon sugar glaze to bottom of pan before adding rolls as the amount indicated in the recipe was just not enough.

I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed and only 2 cups all-purpose flour and it still tasted delicious!  Topped with the cream cheese icing another reviewer suggested and it was a masterpiece!

Simple and delicious! The only things I did different were that I added a package of instant vanilla pudding, used a 9x13 pan, and topped it with a cream cheese icing.

BY far the BEST recipe ever! SO SO SO YUMMY! The dough was PERFECT...I made my own rum icing to go on top...My hubby walked over to were I had the recipe hanging on the frig and said, "You need to look up more recipes from GOOFYDEBBIE!" My little boy ran around with the print out recipe and was yelling, "Mommom made these, Mommom made these!" Yes I think they were a hit...LOL...Only difference was I scalded the milk...by accident by whatever awesomeness it was...is...hope to be again!

This recipe is simply easy and delicious. I hadn't made bread for more than a decade, but seriously, it's a no brainer with this recipe.

As I do not like margarine, I substitute with butter. At the bottom of the pan, I added cinnamon sugar before placing the rolls. I also let the dough proof for 30 minutes before kneading (with the mixer) and rolling it out.

Thank you so very much for this recipe ...

xThese are some of the best rolls I have made.  I can't ever get the dough to rise if I put the yeast in with the flour first. I just added the yeast to the water warm. Heated the milk and butter together, mixed it all together and did the rest like it says. I also used a 9x13 pan. I ended up only cooking mine  for 15 minutes and they were perfect. BEST EVER!!!

Love 'em! Super easy, and way quicker than the traditional recipe - and just as delicious :) I used this recipe mainly because it was faster and didn't use bread flour, since I don't have that. 

Following another suggestion, I poured some extra butter/cinnamon/brown sugar over the tops before baking. I also wanted to add something extra since I seem to have trouble making recipes as-is, so I also sprinkled a few butterscotch chips with the cinnamon sugar for a few of them just to try, and they were even better!! People LOVED these, and fought over them until every single one was gone. 

I think they are great without icing, as they are perfectly sweet, not overwhelmingly sweet (but warning: this makes them even more addicting!!).

I just made these and they came out pretty good! I watched the time on them though because people said they were burning and I think one batch is a little doughy. Only complaint I have is that it about broke my hand mixer so I did them by hand the second time :)

These where pretty easy to make. Although they did take about 90 mins to raise. Making them in muffins tins was a wonderful idea. They taste good but nothing to write home about.

I generously grease my 12" x 9" pan with the stick of butter and use the remainder for the filling, baking for 15-20 minutes. This has become my go-to because it's simpler and quicker than other recipes and makes perfect cinnamon rolls every time. I suggest fat free milk and white whole wheat flour.

My son and I just made these and are eating them now! They taste great!  We too used the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar icing-- great too. Only problem we had was them rising.  Finally put outside, covered in 100 plus temp and they did rise.  So it took longer than 90 min. for us.

These turned out perfect and weren't difficult at all.  I was afraid they weren't going to rise since they hadn't doubled in size by the time I was supposed to bake them, but once they were in the oven they came out perfectly.  Paired them with the perfect cinnamon roll icing for my girls sleep over & they were a big hit.

Perfect with a cup of coffee. They had a nice flavor and were very tender. They also rose nicely.

I'm not quite sure yet how they hold up against longer timed versions, but I want to see before I come back and revise my review. 

Overall, very VERY rich. I would make this again, but cut the spread by half. I don't know how these could be gone so quickly unless you have a large household or taking these to an outing. 

Would make again, but only when I have company to enjoy them with. They are definitely an occasional treat.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I literally just made a batch of these to take to a BBQ, but I baked two little ones for me and my boyfriend to try...WOW. Like others I used cream cheese frosting (1 3/4 package of cream cheese, 3/4 a stick of butter, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup a milk, and a splash of vanilla...my variation on the usual proportions,set to my taste) I also made a syrup to drizzle on top making it extra yummy (1/2 stick butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, set on a low heat until it thickens and gets gooey, make sure to constantly stir the mixture so it doesn't harden) 
definitely a keeper!

So easy and the most delicious recipe for cinnamon rolls I have ever tried. I have never gotten so many raves for a recipe before! I followed the recipe, except I used chopped walnuts instead of raisins. I also topped it with a glaze of 1/3 cup evaporated milk and 2 tbsp brown sugar heated to boiling, whipped that in my mixer with 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. I drizzled that over the top of the rolls while hot. Awesome!

Awesome recipe! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I'm a novice baker and this recipe came out really good. I've tried another cinnamon rolls recipe and it didn't even come close. I highly recommend this recipe. Easy to follow and the resulting cinnamon rolls have really good texture. Thank you!

These were a huge hit in my family. I had a little bit of trouble, not making a mess doing the cinnamon, sugar and butter. But after you taste one, it doesn't matter. I went ahead and did a cream cheese icing ontop, which my family loved! They were easy, and tasted very good... perfect!

excellent for non rising rolls. very sweet, very quick, very good :) I prefer the kind that you let rise, they are alot lighter, these were fairly "heavy" to eat......still good, and didn't stop us from eating them right up!

Easy and delicious.  You will never buy canned cinnamon buns again, I also added the cream cheese icing and everyone loved them.  I don't think they actually doubled in size before cooking, but they came out delicious. I would make these again.

Fantastic, easy recipe. The dough turns out absolutely beautifully (though I did add a bit less fat - a combo of butter and margarine). I iced with a cream cheese icing and they were so delicious!

Really nice texture!!  The first time I made these, I did them in the stand mixer and added all the flour at once (because I forgot to only add part and it was too late to take it out). I also used almost 2 packages of pre-cooked bacon in there before I rolled them and used a maple flavored cream cheese frosting at the end. Those were excellent. Bacon, brown sugar, raisins and maple are fantastic together! Salty and sweet! YUM!  But this time, I followed the directions, adding only part of the flour at the beginning and let the gluten develop as the mixer did its job. I added some freshly grated nutmeg and substituted orange juice for the water. The dough itself came out nice and soft and very resilient.  I soaked the raisins in some hot orange juice while the dough mixed and rested.  Mixing the brown sugar and cinnamon with the soft butter then spreading the mixture is a big help and keeps the filling inside the rolls better. I also added a little nutmeg to the filling.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting with orange juice and orange extract to compliment it.  The texture of this dough is fantastic. It has that soft and slightly "stringy" texture that is so tender but still holds together nicely. Give these a few minutes out of the oven to rest and soak the gooey filling back up, then flip them upside down on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper so the rest of the filling goes back in and also glazes them.   Excellent Recipe! Thank you!

Making cinnamon rolls has always been daunting, but after making this, it has now become a weekly tradition on Sunday. I love this recipe. The only thing I do different is I bake them in a 13 x 9 pan.

Incredible.  They take me a lot longer to make though -- more like 2 and a half hours.  I am not an expert in baking though.

It wasn't the buns it was me....The cinnamon buns tasted great but I spread them out in a 9x13 when I should have squished them into 2 9" rounds and because the sides of the rolls weren't touching my filling leaked out... :( They still were salvagable and my son loved them -- so all was well!  I gave them a hefty dollop of homemade cream cheese frosting so nobody suspected the centers leaked out.

These are fantastic, and SO easy!  I make them with butter instead of margarine, and I also use a 9x13 pan as other reviewers suggested.  I didn't, however, need to increase the baking time as others mentioned- 20 minutes in my gas oven and they come out perfect!  These can also be made the night before and baked in the morning- just cover your pan and put in the fridge immediately after rolling/cutting the dough (before letting it rise).  Then, in the morning put the in a warm place to rise (takes a little longer to rise since the dough is chilled- about 45 minutes) until doubled, and bake according to the recipe.  This is a fabulous recipe for first-time cinnamon roll makers!

These were absolutely delicious! I can't believe that you can make high quality cinnamon rolls in such a short time.  The dough was extremely easy to work with and they rose beautifully.  The finished product was perfect. I added a powdered sugar glaze to top them off.  Cream cheese frosting would be even better.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow! This recipe is fool-proof! Used just half the yeast and dumped all the ingreadients in a bowl to mix all at once. Halfway through kneading the dough by hand, I realized I forgot to add the egg. So, whisked my egg with some melted butter and a bit of flour to make a paste. Added this to the rest of my dough and continued kneading. I let this rest in the fridge overnight and baked the next day with pineapple jam and coconut flakes for the filling (other half got red bean paste)  to awesome results! This recipe is a keeper.

Debbie you should be slapped with love these rolls are so good gurl! My bf Chef is a cinnamon roll fan and he prefers home made to buying some from Cinnabon or in a pinch buying Entenmann's Ultimate 4 pack. Nevertheless, he has officially crowned this recipe as NUMBER 1, even better then his own from scratch recipe. Each time I make this, I use butter instead of margarine, I make extra filling, melt it all together and drizzle on top before baking, I also make a nut topping with crushed walnuts, brown sugar, soft butter and cinnamon that I put on top of the Cream Cheese Frosting II that I use with this recipe. YUMMY! I also bake these in a Pyrex glass 9 x 13 dish.

I make these regularly. They are delicious, easy to make, and my kids go nuts over them. Now if only I could figure out a way to cut the dough without squishing the perfect spiral... ;) I make a simple glaze to go on them - 1 tablespoon of butter, bit of vanilla, bit of milk, and powdered sugar to a gloopy consistency. Perfect.

These were AMAZING!  They were extremely delicious and my husband talked about them for days.  I added a little icing made from powdered sugar, milk, and a splash of vanilla.  These took some work but were worth it!

These are delicious especially with some buttercream frosting on top!  I would only suggest that you make sure you use the right type of yeast or else you'll be waiting a while for it to rise.

I'm not much of a baker and this recipe is very forgiving.  These came out perfect, no adjustment required.  I did add a glaze icing on top as others suggested.  I served them warm, a la mode.  Heaven.

First time making homemade cinnamon rolls. The family loves them! They were good to me but not the best. When I first started working with the dough it was very sticky and I had to add quite a bit more flour to even work with the dough. I think the additional flour took away from the overall flavor as the dough was not as sweet as I would have liked. I didn't cool the milk/butter mixture and I am thinking that might have a lot to do with the stickiness. Overall it was a great recipe. Uses everyday ingredients and I had everything on hand. Topped with a powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and butter icing. All in all I will make again and try cooling the milk/butter longer. I also used a 9x13 pan. Even though the flavor lacked a little for me, they sure were pretty!

Wow, these are incredible.  I used a well-greased 9x 13 glass pan and baked only 17 minutes.  I also used a little water to seal the dough into a roll. I made a thin cream cheese frosting for outstanding results.  From the photos, it seems like the muffin tins are a mess and the rolls do not keep their shape.  For those who had problems, I think you should check the yeast carefully on the next try.  You must have the right temperature for the warm milk/butter mixture.  It should be 110-120 degrees.  Too hot and the yeast is killed, too low and the yeast takes too long to rise.   Thanks for a super recipe.

I tried about five cinnamon roll recipes before landing on this one, which is PERFECTION. I've tried Pioneer Woman's recipe, Alton Brown's overnight recipe, a recipe I got from Sunset magazine, and a few others. Finally I went in search of the perfect recipe. Pioneer Woman's recipe took too long, Alton Brown's recipe was too eggy, and the Sunset recipe had no eggs and I thought the cinnamon rolls didn't have enough flavor.   These are perfect, but I think they're even better if you make them the night before and stick them in the fridge. Some of the sugar crystallizes and it's delicious. You just need to pull them out about 30 minutes before baking them.   Also, adding a cream cheese glaze/frosting is a must. I use 2.5 oz cream cheese, 3 TBS milk, and 1.5 cups of powdered sugar. Mix it up with a mixer (I use my hand mixer), pour on top of the cinnamon rolls when you pull 'em out of the oven, and don't expect to have any cinnamon rolls left, even if you're all by yourself.

Excellent recipe, baked them together in a round cakepan instead of muffin tins because I figured this would leave them more moist, had great results.  Used the cream cheese icing recipe left in the comment by the first review listed after the recipe, first time making it and it was good but next time I'd add more cream cheese.  Delectable rolls even after they've cooled.

Too much butter!!! I would cut the amount of butter in the filling by half. Also, make sure you DO NOT put these on a cookie sheet, they flatten out, definitely use the muffin pan like suggested!!!

Pretty yummy. I ended up making them in a 9x13 glass baking dish. The dish was a wee bit too big, so the end buns were able to expand freely - and thus dried out during baking.  Next time will try making them in a smaller spring form pan (to keep all the yummy juices together)

Really delicious and very easy! Yes, they took exactly 90 minutes! Amazing. I would definitely make them with the cream cheese frosting; it adds a nice complement of flavors (sweet and tangy).

Fantastic! They were probably perfect already but I did jiggle these a little by adding 1 tbsp flour to the cinnamon mixture to stop it running out of the buns. I also made them Christmas eve (after letting the dough rest for about 15mins) , put them in the fridge covered with clingfilm. In the morning I put them in a cold oven with a dish of boiling water underneath for 30mins beofre taking them out to warm the oven and cook for 10 mins (longer would have been too much). They were such a hit I made them to take to company the following day but discovered I had run out of cinnamon at the last minute. I just used 1 tsp mixed spice, some grated nutmeg (abt 1/2 tsp) and added a handful of raisins & chopped walnuts and about 3 tbsp of mincepie filling to the butter and sugar for the filling. I made the rolls up and put them in a dish. They were fine in the fridge until ready to cook for about 10 mins. I also made an icing from 2 tbsp marscapone cheese (only cream cheese I had) about 3/4 cup icing sugar and a little warm water mixed to drizzle over warm buns. This was the hit of the Christmas and everyone wants the recipe. Thanks!

These rolls are amazing...although it always takes me more than 90 minutes to make them.  I also found that using real butter through out  the recipe is much better than margarine.  Also I make a frosting with 1/2cup butter softened 3 oz cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanillia, pinch of salt and 1 /12 cups powered sugar. Mix that all together and spread over hot out of the oven rolls...man o man they are amazing.

These are wonderful, just like the ones my Mum used to make.  Adjust the amount of brown sugar to taste, 1 cup is way too sweet for us, I like to taste the bun, not just "sweetness" I smear butter on the dough, then sprinkle on the sugar and cin.  That's also why I would never frost them either!  Use butter! (don't get me started on butter vs margarine ha) The dough is quite sticky, but just knead in more until you can manage it, should still be somewhat sticky tho. I let them rise for about an hour before I made them into rolls, and have also put them in the fridge over night after there are in the pan...very versatile recipe.  I also made in a pan to avoid the muffin tin mess.  Rather than cut with a knife, use a piece of thread, about 18 in long, slide it under the dough, bring up over the top, cross the threads and pull, voila'!

This recipe is awesome! I really do love to make this with my girls. It's simple and effective AND no bread machine!!!! YAH!!  The only thing, I noticed was that it every time I have made it, it always needs about 3/4 cup more flour than stated in the recipe. Other than that I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn to make cinnamon rolls and/or just wants a fast recipe! Thanks Debbie!!

I found the recipe two days ago and already pulled my second batch out of the oven a few minutes ago! These cinnamon rolls are delicious! I made some icing I found from another recipe which made these rolls even more delightful! My picky husband loved these and said they were just as good as Cinnabon's! Thanks for the recipe :)

Whoa ,,,, these were better than the clone of a cinnabon recipe ! They were more fluffy and gooey. I baked at 180 c for 19-20 mins on bottom shelf of oven. I made them the night before, let them rise, put in baking pan, covered and popped in the fridge till morning. In the morning it went straight from the fridge to the oven. Excellent ! T

Delic recipe. They are not quite cinnabun level delic, but who knows, they probably add crack to the ones in the mall.  I used the frosting from this recipe:  Cinnamon-Rolls-II. Will make again.  Also, to get it to rise, I preheated my oven for a minute or two, turned it off, opened the door to let most of the heat out, and THEN put the covered cinnamon rolls in and closed the door. I made sure it wasn't too hot in the oven though, just warm (or else the yeast would be killed). The rolls finally did rise this way,

Even though it was a bit of a headache, I halved the recipe (but didn't bother trying to half the egg and put the whole thing in instead) and was still able to make six huge cinnamon rolls that filled a 9" square pan.  

Based on other reviews I also made a few modifications - 

-subbed 1/2 wheat flour
-used butter instead of margarine, and used half as much butter for the filling than indicated in the recipe.
-baked in a square pan instead of a muffin pan.
-added chopped pecans instead of raisins for the filling.
-Baked for 25 minutes at 375 degrees.

Whew!  I know that was a lot of modifications, but I'm glad I only made half because there is NO WAY we'd be able to eat all 12!

They did turn out a little bread-like and fluffy, but I think they actually tasted better that way.  I found these just the perfect amount of sweet, but I suppose you could use a tangy cream cheese frosting if you really wanted to indulge.  Overall, great recipe!  The taste is wonderful, and I don't feel as guilty eating these cinnamon rolls compared to those heavier kinds filled with a ridiculous amount of calories!

Oh, and like other reviewers, I did have to add quite a bit of flour when I was kneading it because it was super wet and sticky.  I just added it little by little because I didn't want to add too much extra flour.  I would say I added almost 1/4 cup total of extra flour when I was kneading and rolling it out, and I was afraid this would make the dough too tough, but it still rose fine,

They turned out nice.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Also, I left the rolls in the fridge over night, since I prepped them late.  Then took them out in the morning, let them rise at room temp and  baked them for 15min at 350F.

These are so addicting! I've already made them twice in one week. It was my first experience with using yeast but, it was very easy. The only mistake I made the 2nd time was melting instead of SOFTENING the butter that you mix the brown sugar & cinnamon in for the filling. It gushed out as I rolled it. I had to spoon it back in after it was cut. Very messy but, end result was amazing anyway. I baked them in a round cake pan and had 7 big rolls. Very good with icing from another recipe: 1 tsp milk, 1 1/2 cups conf. sugar, 4 tablespoons softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla. End results is even better than big chain cinnamon roll companies. Try this recipe you won't be disappointed:)

Wonderful!! These cinnamon rolls are amazing and so much fun to make. I've made them twice since I have found this recipe and they have been very successful with friends and family. My sisters boyfriend ate about 3 of them at a time.

I tend to tweek the recipe alittle when making these. I am alittle more generous on the brown sugar and cinnamon. Also when 'beating' the flour with the hand mixer it tends to come out more stiff so i whisk it and smooth it off by kneading it for a longer period of time. They come out much softer and even tastier!!! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!

These are wonderful!  I was intimidated to make cinnamon rolls from scratch but they were easy!  I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the all purpose.  I cut down on the butter (instead of margarine) by a couple of tablespoons, I doubled the cinnamon and used about 1/4 c. less of the brown sugar.  Everyone loved them!!

These are indeed pretty quick to make and produce a yummy cinnamon roll.  I used active dry yeast, rather than the instant, and baked them on a parchment lined sheet, rather than the muffin cups.  I think next time I'd use less butter in the cinnamon filling because a lot of it melted out onto the parchment.  But - these are very good and worth making again.  =)

This recipe is SO easy !  The bread turns out so soft.  I like a sweeter bread when it comes to sweet rolls so I upped the sugar to a half cup.  The recipe still turned out wonderfully.  It is a must try for everyone.

Very tasty, and easy to make. They had a slightly heavier texture than I would have liked for 5 stars, but still quite good. I baked them in a muffin tin, and you do need a baking sheet under it to catch the melted sugar drips.  I think next time I would try them in foil muffin cups to cut down on mess.  I eyeballed an icing for them-- equal parts softened margarine and cream cheese, stir in powdered sugar until you reach the desired consistency, add vanilla.  They're very tasty.  Best warm and fresh from the oven-- I don't think they'd store well more than an hour or two.

Very easy recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for baking the rolls in a 9x13 pan. Using the dental floss to cut the rolls was a brilliant idea as was the addition of the cream cheese icing from an earlier review. I added orange extract to the icing and also plumped the raisens in the microwave with a little water before adding them to the filling. Excellent recipe!

I made these and followed the recipe. They were great! I paired this with a cream cheese frosting and everyone raved about them. Dough very easy to handle. I used my kitchen aid with the dough hook rather than mixing by hand and worked much better. I doubled the batch, so it did take a bit longer than the 90 minutes, but only baked about 15 minutes.

Seriously delicious.  There are 2 of us in my household and we struggled to get these to last even 2 days, they were so good.  I popped all of the ingredients in a bread machine and then rolled it out as instructed.  I did make a powdered sugar icing and poured this over the hot rolls right out of the oven. Scrumptious.

Very nice, easy and quick!  I will try this again. It's not too sweet which is nice when you're not in the mood for too sweet and gooey. I can make this for my kids and not worry about them boucing off the walls later!

I love this recicpe, fast, easy (I used my bread machine to do the dough) and versatile. We also use this dough to make savoury rolls - fillings of sauteed mushroom, onions, carrots, cheddar / mozarella cheese, bacon, ham.. the possibilities are almost endless. And of course, don't forget to spread butter generously before you throw on the fillings. I usually do a double batch, one is all cinnamon rolls and the other savoury rolls.

I made these cinnamon rolls last night because I was craving cinnamon rolls and I wanted something that was quick and easy to make (I'm not that great of a cook, actually).  The only change I made was that I cooked them on a cookie sheet and not as suggested in the recipe.  I only made 6 cinnamon rolls (I cut the recipe down) since only my bf and I live here and I don't want us to turn into porkers. lol  Anyhoot, he loved the cinnamon rolls, so I'm making more now to bring to a party we're going to tomorrow.  This recipe is easy to make and tastes great!!!

I loved it! I just finished baking them and they were the hugest success at home! The dough was sooo easy to handle,I think you should knead it for more than 5 min, more like 10. Cutting it wasn't any trouble at all, I just used a really, really sharp brand new knife. I actually left them ready in the fridge overnight, woke up at 7am and let them rise at room temperature for 30-45 minutes before baking them at 375 F for 25 minutes. They started browning at abou 20 min but since they were so huge they sticked together and the sides were still a bit raw. I thought they wouldn't rise anymore but as soon as they got in the oven they became HUGE! I think next time I'll use 2 9 X 12 inches pans. Oh and by the way, they're great just as they are, no need for some frosting or anything, they're sweet enough! I read all the reviews and used butter for the filling and I doubled the amount of cinnamon (2 tablespoons) They're truly magnificent!

I made cinnamon rolls a couple years ago and they came out terrible. Ever since then I have been too afraid to try again. But when I saw this recipe, I had to try. This recipe made it SO EASY. I followed the recipe word for word and the only little problem was that half way through the baking, some of the filling exploded making a bit of a mess.

I've made this recipe multiple times for different groups and they are always a hit - and they're easy! I like to chill the filling mix so when I'm cutting the roll into pieces it doesn't squish out. I also use a cream cheese icing to top them off. My cinnabon-loving husband is so grateful for this recipe, especially since we're now stationed overseas! Thanks Debbie!!

This recipe is awesome! I always use it when we are craving cinamon rolls. The only things i do diffrently is i dont use muffin cups..i just lay them in the bottom of a baking dish and they work out just fine. I also make double the filling...we like a lot of the cinamon goodness. 8-)

VERY GOOD! I set my bread maker to mix and knead (total time 6 minutes); that saves meddling with gooey dough and adding excessive flour to this excellent recipe. I also set my oven going at its LOWEST temperature for 5 minutes so it gives the dough a warm place to rise (about 1 hour), with its door ajar. It rose really well and I ended up with HUGE buns!!! I baked the buns in a 9x13 dish (they turned out soft and MOIST) but I would use muffin cups when I make them for a party (and I probably will bake it for NOT as long). Sugared buns are my husband's second religion and he certainly couldn't stop nibbling on these buns all day!!! **********YUMMYLICIOUS**********

I would rate these rolls 3-4 stars when baked immediately, but 5 stars when baked a few days later. Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I split the batch in half, baking one pan right away and making mini-rolls I baked later. I covered them and kept the unbaked rolls refrigerated for 3 days before baking them. They were delicious--not nearly as heavy as the first time around. I also baked them in a Pyrex pan rather than in muffin cups to add to their moistness. I don't think I'll ever again make them in 90 minutes...3 days is about right! Another thing: as some reviewers said, the rolls did not double in size during the rise time.

These are absolutely AWESOME!!! I added chopped walnuts instead of the raisins and I didn't use a muffin pan, I just put them in a greased 9x13 glass cake pan, let 'em rise and they turned out beautifully, only needed to bake for about 15 minutes though. They stored great in the same dish (one of those pyrex ones that comes with the plastic snap on lid) and stayed moist for the following 3 days. Thanks for the great recipe!

Please give this recipe a try--I served it to guests on the weekend and everyone raved.  They don't even require the full 90 minutes from start to finish.  I doubled the recipe and baked the rolls on a cookie sheet (with sides). Delish!

The first time I made these, they didn't turn out very well but I'm not experienced at cooking with dough so I decided to try again.  I allowed more time for them to rise to double the size which worked well, put them in the muffin tins and they did taste really good.  However, they grew beyond the muffin tins so I think I'll use a pan next time and place them next to each other.  I also made icing to glaze over the top and that turned out well.  In addition, I always end up adding more flour in the process of kneading and rolling to prevent it from being too sticky.

This recipe was pretty good, except when i baked them the sugar mixture bubbled up over the buns and onto my pan! by the time the baking was done ther was barely any sugar left insinde. I think next time i would use a regualr cookie sheet instead of a muffin tin.

My first baking!  I read the reviews, and decided to add extra filling to the tops before baking. Topped these with chopped walnuts right out of the oven & offered the cream cheese icing from another review.  I was very nervous that my co-workers would give me a less-than-perfect review, as they're all great bakers, however they were quite pleased!  Yay 90min Cinnamon Rolls!

Even is these rolls weren't delicious (which they are!), they'd be worth the effort just for the WONDERFUL smell when they're cooking!  I thought these were relatively fast and easy to make and very good.  This is one of the few recipes I've found that I didn't feel I needed to alter in any way.  My husband and I enjoyed them very much and will definitely be making them again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Just a tip: The ingredients are perfect, but if you use Rapid Rise Yeast and a mixer with a kneading attachment, it's even faster (and easier!) No need to proof Rapid Rise yeast. Mix your dry ingredients in mixer bowl. Warm milk in microwave for 1 minute. Add butter to milk.
Add the egg, water, and milk mixture to flour and mix well. Knead with hook for 5 minutes.
Thanks Goofydebbie for this wonderful recipe! The rolls are soft and so delicious and I didn't spend hours making them!

I loved this cinnamon roll recipe! They were super good! I just used a simple powdered sugar, butter and milk glaze on top.

My Son told me...Do not mess with the perfect .... I was wondering out loud if I should vary the filling just for fun...
 these Cinnamon buns seem to be the only ones working for me, so I will stick with them... I make at least double batches - the are magic- they have the ability to vanish the second they are baked...
I tried to bake other recipes ( clones of the famous kinds...) nope     This is my one and only! Thanks for posting this been making them for years :)

The BEST EVER recipe for making homemade cinnamon rolls!   I've never made cinnamon rolls from scratch and this sounded so easy (which it was!)  I only made a couple of "changes" when I made these:  (1)  used dried cranberries instead of raisins and (2)  I rolled my dough out larger than recipe called for (roughly 16 x 10).  I found by rolling it larger, it enabled me to tuck in both ends so I wouldn't have anything oozing out when I sliced it.  I also don't spread the mixture out to the ends; leave a 1/2 inch edge so it makes it easier to tuck in.  It also gives me an extra roll or two as well!  I also baked in a glass 9x13 which worked very well!  Would recommend this recipe to ANYONE...novice or expert!  Thanks for sharing this with us Debbie!

I was a newbie to cinnamon rolls, and this worked great. I misread the recipe and used a pizza cutter to cut dough into strips right after I spread the butter and sugar on it--before rolling up. Honestly, I think it worked better that way!  No squishing with the knife. I used the glaze suggested in the reviews with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 T butter, 1 T milk, and splash vanilla. Thumbs up.

OH MY GOODNESS these were wonderful!  Relatively quick and easy to make, with the results being out if this world!  I used butter instead of margarine and can't remember if I made any other changes to ingredients.  I baked these in a 9x13 pan rather than a muffin tin 

I fed these to some family members and everyone agreed they're a keeper!  Will definitely make again

I used half and half as a milk substitute. I also used real butter for the actual dough and the margarine for the filling. I actually allowed sit over night in the fridge then popped them in the oven overnight. These turned out amazingly. I made a cream cheese glaze and added crushed walnuts to top it once done. This was my  first time doing homemade cinnamon rolls and I think these were relatively easy. ***I didn't used the muffin tin method. I actually cut these and placed them in a foil baking container. I think for me it turned out better this way.***

I baked them in a regular 8"x11.5"x2" glass pan at 350 instead of the muffin tin after reading other reviews stating the filling makes a mess in the muffin tin.  The dough was very sticky, so I had to use a lot of flour to roll it out, but it makes for a light cinnamon roll.

This was my first  time making cinnamon rolls and they came out delicious! For the SUPER novice in baking like me, you need to make sure the milk is luke warm (120-130 degrees), not too hot or cold, so it activates the yeast (the yeast is alive) and doesn't kill it. Also, place the dough in a bowl and put the damp cloth on top of the bowl for it to rise.

I have made this twice.  I do not add raisins, a personal dislike for raisins. The second time I added chopped pecans. I didn't use muffin tins, it's just less hassle to make them in a baking pan. Next time I am going to add orange zest at my husbands request.  I love the recipe, and love making the dough and rolling it all up.  I do not add the excess sugar of cream cheese topping or etc. It just doesn't need it, IMO. It's JUST sweet enough as it is with a cup of coffee.  I'm passing this one down to my kids. :)

I was looking for a quick and easy cinnamon roll recipe and this fit the bill! I put 12 rolls in a 9 inch, round cake pan and the 2 end pieces in glass custard cups...for taste testing! I smeared a touch of cream cheese icing on the 2 rolls for my husband and I to try. The rolls are going to a men's breakfast in the morning, so I will frost them with cream cheese icing just before my husband leaves the house with them. The only change I would make would be to add more cinnamon to the filling...about double the cinnamon (think Cinnabon!). The dough was a bit sticky, so I will probably add just a touch more flour to make it easier to work with. Al1 in all, a very good recipe!

Great, even on my first attempt! Used rapid rise yeast, and did not proof. However, it took about 20 minutes for the dough to double. I used butter instead of margarine and dark brown sugar. Finally, i used a glass 9x13 pan, they were done in 20 minutes.

Easy,  delicious recipe!  A quick, easy way to cut the cinnamon rolls is to wrap a piece of dental floss around, crossing the pieces until it easily slices it. I don't like cream cheese frosting,  so I used another reader's recipe for icing using butter, vanilla, powdered sugar and milk. I doubled the recipe and put them on a jellyroll pan. They cooked perfectly that way! I will definitely make these again!

TAYLOR SWIFT APPROVED! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RECIPE. Made it for my cafe and they sold out within minutes. I have a Tumblr account and Taylor Swift commented "I am actually screaming" so if that doesn't convince you on making them, then I don't know what will :) Also super delicious with a cream cheese icing :)

Great recipe! Believe it or not, I forgot to add the cinnamon to the recipe and almost cried once I realized it. Though I caught the error when the rolls were rising before baking, so I just sprinkled the cinnamon on the top before baking and it still turned out great. I added raisins and walnuts and used a 9X13 glass pan instead of the muffin tin. I just added 10 min to the total time.  I also made a glaze that consisted of: 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp milk, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Just heat the glaze in the microwave and pour over the top. My husband loved these!

Good recipe considering it is fairly easy to follow and only takes 90 minutes. Regardless of the fact mine didn't rise, the over all results did taste good. I do have a few criticisms. 

1. Do NOT put these in muffin tins. Fortunately, I had an oven liner, but it still smoked and burned.

2. The first listed measurement for butter is for the dough. The second listed measurement is for the butter/brown sugar combo. 3. I'm not sure if my dough did not rise as a result of slightly older yeast .

Awesome recipe!  I put these rolls in a 9x9 greased pan and baked for 20 minutes.  I wanted to make a glaze but with no powdered sugar on hand I used a some store bought vanilla icing. I melted it and drizzled  over top when done.  Kids loved these! And so did I.   Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe didn't work for me. The brown sugar mixture was oozing out of the cupcake pans all over the place and went on the bottom of the oven. Tthat caused so much smoke I couldn't open the oven, otherwise the smoke would come out so the rolls were completely overlooked and hard as a rock.

Best one yet, it was so easy to follow and the rolls were great. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of butter to the filling and an extra tablespoon of cinnamon. Perfect for a valentine brunch.

I've tried this recipe one and they were delicious! Although, they didn't have enough filling and they were a little bit dry. This time I'm going to make them with more filling. I hope they're a little better next time...

So easy and delish!.. Little tip if your rolls aren't rising it might be because your milk mixture is to hot and might be killing the yeAst.. I let mine cool to about 110 degrees ..

The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars (and I can't believe I'm saying this) is that they had a little too much cinnamon. I love the stuff, but I think they would have been a little better with maybe 2 tsp. of cinnamon. The dough was amazing and they really took me about 90 minutes. I put them in a 9x13 pan and they were perfectly cooked after 20 minutes. Pretty dang delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I think this was easy but miscalculate in sized. It rise greatly but it is more than the muffin can.

For me it is super sweet i can't bear the sweetness and the filling is too sweet for my liking. Will cut half the sugar and see how does it taste

I was definitely pleased with the outcome for these rolls! I do think that the dough could use a little bit more flavor, and I added 1 1/2 TB cinnamon to the inside. I also did a cream cheese icing, 1 1/2C powdered sugar, 1/2C butter melted, 2oz 1/3 fat cream cheese, 1TB vanilla extract, and just a pinch of fine sea salt. They turned out well cooking in a round baking dish, but next time I'll make a few adjustments.

These were delicious. It was my very first attempt at making cinnamon rolls. They weren't very pretty (as I apparently had way too much filling which oozed all out while rolling) but they tasted great! I know to cut back next time or attempt to stretch the dough more. I also made a glaze off AR (Vanilla Glaze) to go on top which paired perfectly with it for those who don't like cream cheese icings.

These do rise well and quickly, but unfortunately, they were a disappointment. I have been wanting to make my first yeast cinnamon rolls for a long time. I kept coming to this recipe, because they could be made in 1.5 hours. Yes, they will spill all over your oven, so I put foil in the bottom and just threw it away, but unfortunately they lacked tremendously in flavor. I did use Splenda in the flour, but haven't noticed Splenda taking away from the sweet flavor in other items I've baked. Neither my husband nor I could taste any cinnamon--too much brown sugar. I'd modify the recipe, and in the future not use brown sugar (nor will I add raisins) for the inside but real white sugar instead and use double the sugar or Splenda in the flour mixture.

I loved these! So easy to make. You can really taste the difference between store bought and homemade. I loved mixing the sugar cinnamon and butter into a spread I liked how it handled and tasted. I made a powdered sugar milk and cinnamon glaze for he top and we eat all twelve. Great recipe. Oh, I used rapid rise yeast and added baking soda and powder to the dry (1/2 teaspoon each.)

Loved it! They were fluffy, ooey, gooey and delicious! Will definitely make again. The recipe was super easy and using my stand mixer for everything made it a much quicker job. I didn't use muffin cups, just a square tin pan so the inside rolls would be softer. Definitely no danger of an oven fire for this recipe, though ;) Butter instead of margarine, and I topped them with butter cream cheese icing. YUM!! Awesome recipe!

Perfect! Even for a first time sticky-bun baker!  Baked in a 11" square pan. Next time will use a 9 x13", to make more servings. No dripping of anything .... recipe came out like a dream!  I whipped up a little cream cheese, butter, confectioners sugar, pinch salt, pinch cinnamon, for the icing, after the buns cooled. Absolute perfection!

Hit it out of the ballpark with these! Absolutely amazing! I did bake them in a 9x13 @ 350 degrees for 20 minutes and drizzled just a bit of cream cheese frosting on them when they were still warm but even without the frosting these would be wonderful! I made them to the point of putting them in the pan, covered and put in the refrigerator overnight. Took them out for 30 minutes, let them rise for another 15 minutes using the "dough rising" cycle in my oven before baking. The biggest problem I see with this recipe is the addictive nature of the finished product!

I love this recipe!  It's easy to follow and quick. I do wish that the instructions mentioned which butter to use since you are using butter in the dough and in the filling. Some people may not know which to use, but that's just me. Over all a no fail recipe. I don't use the muffin tin. Instead I use my super large cast iron skillet since I read that some folks had issues with it spilling over during baking. Worked like a champ and cooked evenly.

SUPER easy recipe and DELICIOUS!!! I also used this recipe for onion bread--instead of filling the middle of the cinnamon rolls with cinnamon/brown sugar/margarine, I made a mixture of olive oil, caramelized onions, garlic salt, and garlic powder. So it was like a onion roll bread recipe. SUPER YUMMY!!!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted.  They are so soft and delicious, and they are fairly simple to make.  I made four batches for a large group of people and they were gone in no time.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made them in two large foil pans instead of muffin tins and baked them for 30 minutes.  I topped them with "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing" recipe, also found on Allrecipes.

Made this recipe for a girls sleep over for the morning. It was very fast and easy and I used a cream cheese icing recipe to top them. Gonna make again.

Wonderful! Can you believe these are the FIRST cinnamon rolls I have ever made?!? I sliced into 9 pieces and put them in a 9x13 pan and had nice sized rolls. Left the recipe as written, still baked for 20 minutes.  I covered them with an easy, thick glaze/frosting: melt 1 stick of butter, add 2tsp vanilla (or more to taste) and 2 cups powdered sugar, wisk together and add a couple of tablespoons of milk as needed, but don't over-thin. I plop it on top with the wisk.

Followed the directions exactly (omitted raisins). The final product was delicious! I did have some issues though. My dough was too sticky and I had to keep adding flour in order to knead it as well as when I had to roll it out. Then when I rolled the dough up, a lot of the filling came out. Cutting the dough was difficult and resulted in the rolls falling apart. I scooped up the filling and dabbed it on top of the rolls in the muffin tins. At this point they looked terrible but thankfully they tasted great. Oh and in a convection oven they only took 15 mins.

WOW!  I will NEVER buy store bought again!!!  My family raved about these for days and I have to admit, these were fun to make (and not too hard, in fact, I did them in our camper while up north (WI) - just premeasured the dry ingredients before we left). I omitted the raisins and baked them in a muffin pan (perfect!). I used "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing" from this site.  Love the fact that I KNOW what is in these rather than the laboratory stuff.  AMAZING!!

I have been using this site for YEARS and this recipe inspired me to finally create an account so I can rate/review. I've made this recipe twice within one month. Had never made cinnamon rolls before. The dough is the easiest dough I've ever worked with---first time with mom's stand mixer, second time just elbow grease. The first time I followed the recipe instructions exactly re sitting/rising times. The results were very good. The second time I let the dough sit and rise for about 2 hours once the rolls were cut and put in the baking dish (have not tried muffin tins). The results were even better!!!  So if you're short on time and have only 90 minutes, follow the steps exactly and you will not be disappointed. But if you have some more time, let them sit a bit longer and  you'll be even happier. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is a very easy recipe to make.. my 6 yr old loves them fresh out of the oven. I put them in a glass 9x13 pan and they turn out wonderful!!!!! 
Update: now that I have 2 more boys and a husband, they don't last long at all around the house! :) they pretty much inhale them whenever I make them lol
UDATE 2 ;) : I found that if i put them on a cookie sheet to raise and bake, they turn out nicely. They tend to go outwards instead of raising up, which makes it nice for the boys to eat them. Just don't let the sides touch and you'll have a nice round cinnamon roll :D

This is the easiest cinnamon bun recipe I have ever tried! I had to make a few substitutions. My husband is allergic to dairy, so my three year old and I used Earthwise margarine and coconut milk. I used pastry flour, as that's all I had on hand. Even with these subs the buns were delicious. We brushed more of the margarine, sugar and cinnamon mixture on top of the bus before baking. Yum, yum, yum!! I can't wait to try these with normal flour, then I'll probably raise my rating to five stars!

Perfect and delicious! My very first time making cinnamon rolls and they came out great. My boys could not wait to eat them as soon as they came out of the oven! I didn't even have to make icing for them they were that delicious. I recommend watching the video a couple times and also while you are mixing up the ingredients just to make sure you are doing everything right. Loved them! I used Gold Medal Better for Bread Flour.

These turned out great. I used a 9x13 pan and I was very impressed. It was an interesting technique to cream the butter, sugar and cinnamon together like a spread. I had always melted the butter and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar combination over it. I think the spread technique kept the cinnamon where it was supposed to be. Great recipe. Thanks :)

Best abs easiest recipe ever! And SUPER YUMMY! 
I usually use 2 tbs of cinnamon instead of 1 because I like my cinnamon rolls extra cinnamony lol 
Also I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of regular in stead of 1 cup of brown sugar. I found that it doesn't clump up as much when it's baked.
But other that that I find these soft yummy an so worth making!! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I doubled it and made them bigger (ended up with about 18), but I still only needed to cook them for about 16 minutes.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I'm currently making these rolls for the second time. They are great. I made them in a 9x13 pan this time. Last time I used an 11" pan, which was not big enough. I think you could roll the dough out a bit larger than 9 x 12. Also, I used butter, not margarine. I did NOT use a full 1/2 cup of butter for the filling. I had to use extra flour since it was quite humid here. I used the cream cheese frosting suggested by another reviewer. Perfect. They are delicious!

We liked these a lot, though messy to make.  Used the "perfect cinnamon roll icing" recipe and spread on while still warm.  Kept well in the refrigerator.

This is my second time making these rolls. I too use a 9X13 pan, lightly greased.
These are the BEST ever! Thank-you for the awesome recipe. There is never enough in my household! They don't last long! :)

Wow. I doubled the recipe and I was able to make 28 good sized rolls. I used two 12 hole cupcake tins and one small square pan. The centers rose quite high while baking on the rolls in the tins. I'm not sure why, but it didn't matter. These are wonderful. My EMT class will enjoy them for breakfast in the morning, that's for sure! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I've made this recipe several times this winter on snow days.  And took it to a Sunday School breakfast potluck tonight.  The rolls were a huge hit and several asked me for the recipe.  I make them as per the directions, using my dough hooks on my KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough.  I use the proofing option on my oven to help the dough rise but, because I like the rolls to be fluffy and light, I let them rise 60-70 minutes rather than the 30 minutes recommended in the recipe.  Use the Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing from All Recipes and you will be set!

I tried this recipe two times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  If I were to rate it based on that first experience, I would have given it a three out of five stars.  The rolls came out well (tasty), however, the texture of the dough felt off.  I tried it a second time with King Arthur’s bread flour and the rolls came out incredibly well. The texture of the dough was amazing.  If you haven’t tried using bread flour, I would definitely recommend you try it at least once.  

Tips: You don’t need to let them sit for 30 minutes.  They’ll rise in the oven regardless.
I also separated the cinnamon/brown sugar from the butter.  I melted the butter and painted it on the dough, then stuck the sugar mixture to the buttered dough.  Make sure to pack sugar onto dough to keep it in place.  This method simply made it easier to apply the mixture without the filling becoming sticky and hard to apply to the dough.  
Thirdly, I would refrigerate the uncooked dough until you absolutely need them (especially for events).  The cinnamon rolls are the best when warm, fresh, and the filling is in a liquid-like texture.  If not fresh, microwave the rolls for 15-30 seconds.  Easy way to emulate fresh cinnamon rolls.  Very good recipe.

This is a great recipe! Fairly easy, and much quicker than other yeast cinnamon rolls. I have never used yeast before, and they turned out pretty much perfect! I used a 9x13 metal cake pan instead of muffin tin. And I made them the night before, refrigerated them right after they were cut and put in the pan, and let them sit out in the morning for 45 min before baking them. I baked them for 25 min and it was the perfect amount of time. I also made sure the milk/butter mixture was 125 degrees before mixing in the batter, which is the right temp when using yeast. The rolls probably doubled in size over night in the fridge.  I made frosting with powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. It was actually a little sweet for me. A cream cheese frosting with a little salt would probably be better. Wonderful recipe!! My husband said, "These are better than Cinnabon!" That's quite a compliment. :)

The second part of the recipe should specify WHITE sugar or BROWN, also, did not rise probably because of that. Too dense, not gooey or sweet enough.

I have a cinnamon roll recipe already but it takes hours to make so I found this instead and thought I'd give it a try! I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was interesting that the yeast was added to the dry ingredient mixture instead of being poured into warm water and left to foam. I was a bit hesitant because even after the 40 mins of proofing, the rolls still looked small! But goodness, stick them in the oven and let them bake! The house smelled delicious and when I pulled them out, they were puffed and sizzling!

I did NOT use a muffin tin. I just thought that was strange because I felt you were restricting the puffing of the rolls. So I baked these in a 9x13 pan. It was perfect! Now to find the perfect cream cheese frosting recipe...

I am just learning to cook and bake, so I worried that this would not turn out well. I followed the instructions to the letter with the only exception, I used butter instead of margarine and I added a small pat of butter to the top. These turned out very well! I may have overcooked slightly because I forgot to turn on the timer, but they were still soft and delicious...and I am not a big fan of cinnamon rolls. My son says they tasted just like the ones in the mall. This recipe is a keeper!

I've finally found my cinnamon roll recipe! I never thought I would get such nice results with quick-rise yeast. I used all butter instead of margarine in both the dough and the filling. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat (may try 1 cup next time) and the dough was still fluffy and chewy. I baked in a small rectangular glass dish instead of in muffin tins, and although they were a little too packed in, there was no negative effect on the finished product. They were chewy and gooey, sweet, and buttery--the perfect cinnamon rolls.

Wow. Sooo super easy and sooooo yummy. My son said better than Cinnabon. He told me I need to make them all the time. Can't believe I've been making the can kind. So glad I found this recipe. I did pour some melted butter, cinnamon and sugar over them before I baked. I also used a rectangle glass dish instead of muffin tins. Made some yummy cream cheese icing and put just a dab on each when still hot. Sooo good.

Yeah, these are pretty great. Used a 9x13 pan instead of muffin pan. I had expired, active dry yeast, so I had to proof the yeast and let the buns rise for quite a bit longer. They still turned out nicely. Topped with cream cheese icing. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  My family loved these 90 minute cinnamon rolls.  They are so easy to make and full of flavor.  I didn't use the muffin tin, just the 9X13 pan.  I am going to try the muffin tin next time.
Truly a great recipe for this busy mom.
Thanks...Denise'sKitchen

I am a total baking rookie but this recipe sounded easy enough to tackle. It was kind of a disaster. I couldn't find instant yeast & had to use a packet of regular that I let sit in the warm water for ten minutes. My dough was so sticky that when I tried to roll it up, it stuck to itself & all the filling gooshed out the top. I was working on a floured surface with floured hands, but didn't want to add extra flour to the dough in case in screwed up the chemistry. I cut the "rolls," placed them in a greased 13x9 pan and let them rise. I spooned some if the filling over the top since it had fallen out.They didn't really rise, even after 45 min. I had given up at this point & baked them anyway. Absolutely delicious!! Even after all of my mistakes, these were amazing. They fluffed up in the oven & were gooey & soft. Yay!

It was tasty, but not spectacular. Hence the four stars. It tastes best the day they're made or else warmed up in the oven/microwave if eating in the next day or two because, like most home made breads, it loses the fluffiness.

I made this with my 9 year old and we loved it!  We used butter instead of margarine and baked in a 9x13 glass pan.  We iced them using "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing" from this site.  Also, being the first time trying this recipe and the first time using yeast, it surprisingly took close to only 90 minutes!  We'll be making this again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe  :)

This was my first shot ever at making any kind of cinnamon rolls not from a can and i found it very, very easy to make.  There was actually probably too much butter sugar mixture.  I had to modify the recipe slightly to fit my circumstances and it was fine.  I love that about this recipe!  I was out of egg and had no raisins, so i just skipped it and didn't replace it, but these were still heavenly, like OMG, heavenly good.  i did let it rise an extra 25 minutes and did the rise in a microwave with the light on and the door closed.  Also, i added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon to the butter sugar mixture.  For the icing, i made a cinnamon buttercream frosting.  It tasted divine.  Seriously, I can't believe I ever bought the cans!  I have been depriving myself.

Absolutely wonderful!  Made the recipe the night before serving and put them in a 9x13 cake pan. Left them uncooked, covered in the refig overnight.  Took them out to rise about 2 hrs prior to cooking them (warm summer morning). Then baked according to the instructions. Huge hit with the breakfast crowd!

Amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing and so easy to make,apart from the fact that  I didn't roll the dough thin enough n added a bit of extra butter to the cinnamon and sugar mixture, the rest was fine,it didn't change the taste though.all in all a good experience. Definitely recommended.

Absolutely best recipe ever! Very easy to make without a stand mixer. These tasted fabulous, even 3 days later. Am making them again 2nd time in a week for company. Might become a bad addiction!

I just finished making these, and they came out amazing :) I baked them in a 9x13 and did 1 and 1/2 times the brown sugar mixture to get a really gooey cinnamon roll, I made the cream cheese icing from the clone of a cinnabon recipe on this site and they are amazing, I will never make another can of cinnamon rolls again, these taste way better and really quick and simple to make :) Thank you Goofydebbie for an amazing recipe! :)

I made this recipe exactly as it says except using the muffins tin , instead I used regular baking sheets and they turned out great. I made icing on top after they cooled and it was really delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I have made these now three times in a 9x13 pan. The first two times followed ingredients accept the filling, I was short on brown sugar – so used half brown and half white. The second time I attempted to make smaller and ‘more’ individual buns so there would be more to go around. These disappear FAST in our small group at church. The attempt making smaller ones – they sort of went wild when baking in their dish. The third time making these I substituted ¼ c oat bran ¼ c of oat flour for a half cup of flour. I did not have regular milk – had buttermilk on hand – so used it. The third time – they definitely tasted ‘healthy’ not as light and fluffy. Still good but next time I’ll see if ½ c oat flour would be less heavy than oat bran.  One of the young recent college graduates who got her first job far away – one of the things she wanted before leaving was this recipe, “The best cinnamon buns I ever ate” she said with glee! So this has been a really five star recipe!

I was not thrilled with these cinnamon rolls. I have baked quite a bit and I made sure my milk, water, egg mixture was between 110 and 115 degrees before I added it to the flour/yeast mixture because some of the reviews had mentioned issues with the dough not rising. My rolls turned out to be like a heavy bread. They did rise a bit but not nearly as much as I think they should have to give a lighter quality to the buns. Perhaps if I had proofed the yeast my results would have been better. My search for a cinnamon roll recipe continues.

Great basic recipe!  Very similiar to one I've been using for years.  My family loved them! I used coconut oil in place of the butter for the dough. To cut down on some of the fat.  But used regular butter for the brown sugar/cinnamon spread.  I also baked mine in a greased 13x9 pan.

I agree with Jeanne.  My kitchen and living room were all smokey.  I put a cookie sheet underneath, but the sugar and butter had to burn off the bottom of the oven.  Thank God I caught it before anything more serious than a dirty oven happened.  Rolls were yummy.  Made them the day before Mother's Day for my two daughters.  They loved them.

Fantastic, used 1.25 cups of wheat flour and rest white flour.  Was very good.  My family didn't notice.  Will be using this recipe for many holiday breakfasts.

Wonderful recipe! Quick if you purchased the quick yeast (which my husband did not) but really delicious if you let rise overnight and then bake.  I also smeared the butter first and then made twice the amount of cinnamon/brown sugar and sprinkled.  Great!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is! My family couldn't get enough of them and they made for an excellent Sunday breakfast. I used chopped walnuts instead of raisins and I put homemade cream cheese frosting on top, garnishing with the left over walnuts. I agree with many of the other reviews that you need to put an extra pan under the muffin tin. My cinnamon rolls puffed up over of the top and the cinnamon oozed out and over the sides of the tin. Charred cinnamon and brown sugar are stuck to the bottom of my oven now. It was definitely worth it though!

Made these today, they are easy and delicious!  I put walnuts and raisin in mine; also I used a 9x13" glass pan, lowered oven temp to 350 degrees - they were done in about 35 minutes.  

I will be making these again.  Thank you.

These were incredible.  I always read the negative reviews first just to see what problems I might run into, and I can't figure out what they were talking about, although I did put them in a 9x13 pan just to avoid any spill over, as well as I would hat to lose a single drop of that wonderful cinnamon filling.  Frosted them with The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing from Cara (this site) and they were gone.  Beautiful soft texture perfect amount of cinnamon, and so incredibly easy.  I'm betting these become a family staple.  Thank you!

Super delicious & simple. I've made them a couple times, they're really yummy with cream cheese frosting and pecans. Definitely use a pan instead of a muffin tin.  Using a muffin tin causes the majority of the brown sugar mixture to melt out of the rolls and go over the sides, even if you have a cookie sheet underneath it the sugar will burn and become smokey.

I made these today for Easter breakfast and everyone loved them. My family said they're the closest to Cinnabon that they've ever had and I've emailed several of them the link to this recipe! I made a cream cheese icing that topped off the warm cinnamon rolls perfectly!!! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe that I will be making at least once a month for my family!

I'm always looking for the perfect recipe for whatever I try to make...and for cinnamon rolls, this is IT. I swear they taste just like Cinnabon. I brought this to a breakfast party and everyone flipped out. They're also quite a bit easier than a lot of other recipes I've seen. Hands down the best homemade cinnamon rolls I've ever had. I topped them with AR's "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing", try them, you won't be disappointed!

Ok...so I made these a couple weekends ago, for the family as a comfort food breakfast...turns out my husband nearly demolished the entire batch. I didn't put them in the muffin tin, I saw that part after I already put them in a glass baking pan...someone also left a wonderful cream cheese frosting recipe in their review...I used this to top off the rolls...all I can say is YUM...from 2 weeks ago till tonight, my husband has been bugging me to make more...I told him the things I needed to complete the recipe, more flour, room temp butter...he had everything laid out so I could make them when I got off work...I giggled..."they must be really good if you laid everything out for me..." he nodded and said "these are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten!" So making my 2nd batch right now...waiting for the milk to cool to add to the flour...he is salivating! :)

I have tried a couple different cinnamon roll recipes from this site and I had to rate this one. It is just too easy not to try - not to mention delicious!  My new go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls. Going to attempt them in a mini muffin pan next. Thanks for posting....

Delicious and oh so easy!  I took them from the oven and thought I should make some type of icing (a la Cinnabon) but tried them as-is.  These really are great, with no intervention required on my part (a rare event, since I like to "tinker" with recipes). I will definitely be making these again, and again, and again.....

I followed the direction but wrapped the dough in wet cloth for twenty min, let the roll buns sit for 45 min in a glass 9x12 glass dish covered with plastic wrap for a 50 min and cooked for twenty minutes. Used powered sugar, butter and milk for icing which I poured on rolls immediately once they came out oven. Kids loved them soft and flakey. They rose perfectly and I will keep this recipe. It didn't call for shortening as other recipes which I never buy.

I used a 9x13" pan and I had spread my auntie Tammy's "goo" recipe evenly in the bottom, 1/4 cup margarine, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and a little over 1/4 cup of corn syrup. I let the buns rise on top of this goo and they turned out perfect!

Best and easiest cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  I didn't change a single ingredient!  I did accidentally fail to read closely and put all of the flour in the bowl right from the beginning, but these came out so light, fluffy, and delicious that I can't imagine what that step actually accomplishes.  Baked them in a 9x13 pan and added a simple butter, powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla glaze for topping.  This recipe is a keeper.  :)

I put my cinnamon rolls in a 9X13 pan and baked for 20 mins at 350 degrees.  Turned out fantastic.  I'm a convert to these rolls... Forget all that long baking nonsense!  This is my new favorite!  (I do make my own cream cheese butter cream icing though... with a touch of cinnamon)

Good if you like more of a buttery/pastry type cinnamon roll.  I prefer gooey, more bread-like cinnamon rolls so was a but disappointed.

Fool proof, easy and great results! Just watch the baking time, 30 mins in a 9x13inch tin was too long for mine, second time I tried it I baked for about 20 mins. To keep crust soft I brushed with milk after 15 mins. They were so delicious I didn't wanna share. This is my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls from now on!

I made these cinnamon rolls just a few days ago and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe and was very pleased with the outcome. I added a pinch or two of kosher salt to the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture to really bring out the sweetness, and to create a bit of a salty sweet combination. And kosher salt has bigger granules to give you that salty sweet taste. For a topping I made a brown sugar glaze: 1 cup of brown sugar and butter, 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and another nice pinch of kosher salt. Bring this up to a simmer in a small saucepan at medium heat. Once melded together nicely, take off the heat and add 1 heaping cup of powdered sugar and whisk together until you achieve the glaze consistency you desire. Again, when you take a bite you may meet a bit of the  kosher salt in both the center of the cinnamon roll and glaze which really makes this cinnamon roll pop.

This is a quick and easy recipe, I substituted 1 cup wholewheat flour, I spread butter directly to the rolled out dough, then sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar, then roll them up,bake in a 9X13 pan, also at the last 5 mins baking, I drizzle corn syrup over the rolls, delish!

Very good. I added chopped pecans and almonds inside the rolls (personal preference). Also, I dusted the counter with powdered sugar and then kneaded/rolled the cinnamon roll. I also spread vanilla cream cheese frosting over the top. These were so good. Would definitely make again.

I think the recipe was very easy and delicious.... my dough didn't rise like it should have, but I'm guessing that was something I did.  I will be trying these again!!!

LOVE this recipe!! Instead of baking the rolls in muffin cups, I used a cake pan (good thing, too, because they were HUGE!!). Also, I sliced the dough before rolling because it was easier to roll that way (and a lot less messy). I didn't need to use all of the cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture while making the rolls, so I used what was left over to put ON rolls, and it's AMAZING! I'm eating one of the cinnamon rolls right now!

These were super easy and because i used quick rising yeast (Makes things rise 2 times faster), they took only about 75 minutes. Everyone loved them and i didn't make any changes except didn't make them in muffin tins, i used a 9 by 13 inch pan.

Sounds like a great recipe except for the margarine. I will use butter because the body likes butter but not margarine.

Fantastic! I enjoy baking cakes, but I don't often use yeast or bake breads so was a little anxious, but this recipe was SO easy!
For any Brits out there, the .25 ounce of yeast it calls for is just your regular 7g sachet of Allison/Hovis "Easy bake yeast".
The only thing I changed after reading the reviews was to only make up half of the stated filling quantity and found that it was just right. I also didn't use a muffin pan -to keep them softer on the edges as others suggested- so I used a 10 x10 inch square pan instead and filled it with the rolls. I made around 14 rolls and it was perfect!

Another handy tip I saw on the TV the other day for cutting dough rolls into slices- is to use either dental floss or thin embroidery thread! Honestly it is a brilliant method! 
So once you have the dough in one long sausage shape all rolled up, slide the floss under the roll at the place you want to slice...then tie it in a knot on the top of the roll (so the thread is now around the whole diameter of the roll) and gently tie the knot tighter around the roll until it completely cuts through it! Perfect slices every time! No need to stand there for ages trying to gently cut through it with a knife!!

First time making cinnamon buns and it worked out great! Really easy recipe and they turned out great. I used the "perfect cinnamon roll icing" recipe found on here and they are so yummy. One thing I noticed though is that cinnamon/sugar filler recipe made way more than needed, almost double what was needed. That and the filing mostly came out of the buns when baking (but the cinnamon buns still had a nice amount of filing in them in the end). All in all, really happy with this recipe and will definitely make these again.

I thought this recipe was really good and was easy for making cinnamon rolls from scratch for the first time. The only thing that i did not enjoy and it may have been something that i did was that the filling tasted gritty. Any suggestions to help with it? I would love to make them again if i could fix that

I do not usually give recipes 5 stars, but this recipe deserves it!! For the ones that had trouble with the cinnamon/sugar mixture falling out during baking, if you spread the butter (I used 1/4 of a stick, not the whole 1/2 cup called for) on the dough after rolling out and then spread the cinnamon and sugar on top of the butter it is not such a mess. I also put my rolls in 2 9 inch round cake pans and they turned out beautifully (They cooked in 20 minutes)!! I made them for our traditional fathers day breakfast and my husband told me that he liked them better then Pilsbury's in a can!! and he is a die hard cinnamon roll lover.

I made cinnamon rolls once, and they were a hit.  I was sure it was this recipe. I have made the recipe two more times now, following the instructions exactly (I thought), and both times the cinnamon rolls failed to rise. I used active dry yeast, and now I see that the recipe says "instant" yeast. So it appears that this was probably my mistake, and maybe the same as others reviewers that had the same problem. The taste was still there, they were "ok", not awesome.

First off let me just say that I did modify the recipe.  And not because it didn't look delicious!  The dough part of Debbie's recipe is VERY yummy.Here is what I did different:  I used a 9 x 13 pan, cut into 15 rolls, in the bottom of the pan I put melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, added walnuts before I rolled it, cooked for 25-30 minutes, after inverting to a cookie sheet I covered with a mixture of cream cheese, little milk and powered sugar mixture.  I also let it rise in the pan for about an hour.  Thank you Debbie for a wonderful easy cinnamon roll!

These are much easier than I thought.  They have more of a bready texture than I am used to in cinnamon rolls, which typically are more dense and pastry-like.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. However, the first time I made these, the cinnamon sugar dripped over the sides of the muffin tin and burned on the bottom of the stove, causing a lot of smoke and a bad smell. The next time I made them, I put some aluminium foil underneath the muffin tins to prevent this. With this fix, this is a great recipe that I will continue using! Thanks!

These were really good rolls. I upped the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup in the bread. I kept everything else the same. Simple recipe with really good results. Thank you for sharing!

These were FANTASTIC, and surprisingly easy to make. I used butter instead of margarine, because that's what I had at hand, and used muscovado sugar, which brought great taste and texture. Also, I used more flour than the recipe calls for, in order to have a workable dough, but that's normal in baking, just add the flour if the dough is too mois and sticky. I also made a batch where I used peanut butter, sesame butter instead of margarine, muscovado sugar and no cinnamon (some of my guests didn't care for cinnamon). I formed the rolls, put them in an oiled baking pan and left them rise in the refrigerator overnight. I baked them in the morning, and they came out perfect. I will definitely be making these again and again. Thank you so much for the recipe !

Delicious. My first time making cinnamon rolls. I baked them in a 9x13 inch pan and put the pan on a cookie sheet lined with foil. When I took them out of the oven I flipped the pan over onto the foil lined cookie sheet so all the gooey mixture was on the top of the rolls. I then made the cream cheese icing. No problems. Just darn good.

Made these this morning and O M G, they are fantastic!  I didn't use a muffin pan though, I set them all in a deep pish dish which was able to handle the bubbling sugar mix.  I also added the cream cheese frosting recommended by another member and the end result was fabuous!!

Turned out great! Changes I made: almond milk for regular milk, Xyla for sugar, egg beaters for egg, low cal margarine. For the brown sugar I used Xyla, only 1/2 cup, 1/2 the margarine & cinnamon. It turned out great!! So delicious.

Not a fan.  Seems simple, but actually a very sloppy recipe.  Dough was way too sticky...almost a batter...needed far more flour that called for.  Also, could have let rise quite a bit more...feel like I messes with the yeast by rolling it out after such a short rest.  And the cinnamon filling should reduce the butter to 1/3 or 1/4 cup.  Then at the end realizing that these are actually muffins...What a mess.

Great recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and poured a little extra butter/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top after allowing the rolls to rise for 30 minutes. I baked them in a 9x13 pan for about 28 minutes and swirled some homemade cream cheese frosting on top after allowing them to cool. Absolutely perfect! I'm hanging on to this one.

So good! I used 2 1/4 tsp dry active yeast (heated the milk in microwave for 1 minute, added butter, then yeast) tripled the cinnamon & baked in glass 9x13 for 20 minutes.  Topped with vanilla cream cheese frosting.

Worth the time, most definitely. I added 1/4 cup chopped pecans, and cut the raisins to 1/4 cup. Cream cheese frosting on top! I didn't use the muffin tins, just the baking dish.

Fantastic! I assembled these and then refrigerated them overnight in the muffin pan, and let them warm up a little while the oven preheated. I added a simple cream cheese/powdered sugar very similar to "Cinnamon Bun Icing" by ASILMARIE. I think I'll make the gooey cinnamon filling a little thicker next time so less goes to the bottom of (or overflows over) the tin cups.

Great cinnamon rolls!  Wish I would have put a pan under the muffin pan though.  My oven is a mess!  Next time I think I'll cook them in a 9x11 pan so they will be more moist.  Not looking forward to cleaning my oven....

This is a great recipe but I had a DUH moment when I melted the butter because I didn't want to wait for it to soften.  You want it soft in order to form a paste with the brown sugar.  If you melt the butter and then try cutting the slices of dough, it oozes out all over the place into a big mess.  It was a very tasty mess, though.  The end result was fabulous.  I didn't think I could make cinnamon rolls that would turn out this good!

EASY and Tasty!   Not a baker, but my 8 and 10 year old daughters and I were a big hit at our family Christmas Brunch last week when we showed up w/ these!  Family couldn't believe that we made these from scratch.  We drizzled about 1/8 (or less) cup of melted butter on top and sprinkled w/ a shaker of cinnamon/sugar prior to baking.  Also, we made mini ones by cutting the dough in 1/2 longways.  The baking was right at 20 minutes for the mini rolls.  This is a keeper! Thanks!

Wow, these are really awesome.  I followed the recipe except I always use butter, not margarine, and they were quite amazing!  But watch out, they are also dangerous - I have eaten almost the whole pan by myself because my husband isn't home yet!!!  :)  Very tasty, moist, and delicious.  Definitely use the glaze described in other recipes if you aren't much of a frosting person.  It is the perfect topping, in my opinion.

These were perfect! The only thing I changed was that I used butter flavored Crisco instead of margarine. Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. We had them Christmas morning, and I think we have started a new Christmas tradition. Thanks for sharing!

One note; dough was very moist following the recipe, so I needed to add extra cup or so of flour to adjust.

Easy, fast, delicious!  Bloomed the yeast in the water before adding to dry ingredients.  Recipe was a little confusing, it has 1/4c butter (or marg, I used butter) IN the dough,.and 1/2c ON the dough (w/ brn sugar and cinn). I had too much of the filling mixture so I smeared it on top before baking, haven't wanted to ice them this way! No sticking problems, greased a pyrex pan with crisco, no problems at all! Buns were done @ 20 min using the pyrex pan. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for breakfast night a few weeks ago.  Took more than 90 minutes, for sure, but worth every second!  I'm making them again for Christmas breakfast, but plan to put them in the pan and refrigerate overnight as other reviewers have mentioned.

oh so yummy!! As soon as it popped out of the oven I gobbled one up right away! I initially misread the amount of margarine as 1/2 cup for the dough instead of 1/4 cup and therefore added an additional 1/4 cup softened butter into the dough. Still worked out perfect though!! I was wondering how this recipe used up so much of my butter! I also added cream cheese frosting on top. 1/2 cup confectionary sugar, 1/4 cup cream cheese and 2 tbsp butter was sufficient for my frosting, as the buns were already sweet. Omitted the raisins.

I don't consider myself a great baker or cook, but I looked like a champ when I put these out for the family.  My kids compared them to their favorite local bakery's cinnamon rolls...they were easy and scrumptious!  I made it exactly like the recipe states...dangerously delicious!

Awesome!! The cinnamon rolls were huge. I used raisins and the kids gobbled these up. I had some frozen icing left over from Schwan's mini rolls. This icing was delicious drizzled over the warm rolls.

FANTASTIC! I loved how quickly these came together, and how elastic and soft the dough was to work with.  No temptations to add unneeded extra flour. I used only 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon for filling and it was still very sweet.  3 tablespoons of soft butter over the dough was enough for sugar/cinnamon, raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to stick to. Baked in a 12 x 8 1/2 well-buttered pan 20 minutes. No problems with sugar running out and sticking to the pan because I kept changing pans until I got one that the rolls fit into with just a touch of room in between for rising during baking. Wonderful!!!!

These were delicious.  I made a simple cream cheese icing to glaze the top and they were very yummy (cream cheese, vanilla, milk, butter, powdered sugar)!  The dough never really "rose" that much during the resting periods, so I dont know if that made much of a difference at all.  I used a 9x13 pan, but there was extra room in the pan, meaning that some of the gooey center oozed out into the empty side of the pan, and then baked hard onto it.  Next time, I'll try an 8x10 pan, or muffin tins.  :)

I made this recipe as is and it was fabulous, I already have requests to make it again.  I was feeling creative and did a savory roll and replaced sugar mixture with butter, garlic and cheese.  This too was delish.

I made these tonight, they were very easy to make and tasted great. I didn't use a muffin pan, but a regular sheet pan instead. I spaced them too far apart so they were huge, lol, next time I will put them closer together. Other than MY mistake, this is a quick, easy, tasteful recipe to try. I also added a cream cheese icing, recipe found on this site as well. My children & hubby all liked them, so 5 stars from me. Thanks for sharing.

Just made this today! We love it! It is so easy to make and tasted like the ones we buy from the bakeshop.  

We made a few adjustments though. We added a bit more flour because it was still hard to handle.  We also decreased the cooking time as it was starting to burn already halfway through cooking time. But maybe because we were using a small electric oven. 

Will definitely make this again! Yum!

Awesome, quick recipe. The only things I would change the next time would be to use more cinnamon in the filling and reduce my baking time to 12-15 minutes. I covered with cream cheese frosting and they were delicious!

Rollin’ Rollin’ Rollin’
Waking up in the morning to a warm ooy gooy cinnamon roll, dripping with cool cream cheese icing is always a perfect way to start any day. This is one of the best cinnamon roll recipes I have found. This is a must try ninety minute cinnamon roll recipe. I am normally intimidated by yeast breads, but this recipe turns out perfect every time. Not only is it a quick and simple way to get your sugar fix, but in the end, the result is sweet and subtly delicious. Yeast bread seems to be an all-day process, but this will be ninety minutes of your life well spent! If you want to treat your family and friends to a special treat, delight them with these delicacies. This recipe yields twelve servings….and believe me you will want to double, if not triple this recipe; these go faster than speedy Gonzalez. Although this recipe is delicious on its own, don’t just stick to this basic recipe; add some of your own spices such as ginger, ground cloves, nutmeg, and a pinch of cardamom to the cinnamon mixture for an extra kick. This will not only add warmth and depth to the filling, but also fill your house with a heavenly aroma. Once completed indulge in the incredibly moist delicious cinnamon rolls! Thanks for the recipe!

I loved these cinnamon rolls. Very easy and fast to make.This is a very nice dessert if you dont have alot of time or for the morning, to enjoy with a nice cup of coffee. Do not wait to eat these later, for theyre best tasted hot from the oven. 
Tip: Place the rolls tightly packed, for they come out puffier that way.

very good! My husband thought I had found a Cinnabun recipe.  They were very simple to make, the dough was softer than I expected, but the finished product was great.  I made a cream cheese frosting that topped it off!

I give this 5 stars, because it was so easy to do. Did somebody say cupcake papers. Now where did I put them things. Oh yeah. Didn't use them. I used real butter instead of margarine too. I will use margarine maybe on the 3rd time. Now if anybody can give me the secret to timing recipe so I can keep them from burning on the edges next time. Or maybe a new pair of glasses. By the way they did not burn that badly but hey I would like some perfection in life. I made a youtube video of the results on my alldoorsopen youtube channel. Thanks Raymond D. Sweet

These were fantastic! My kids loved them! They were super easy and fast. I used real butter instead of margarine. I will probably use more butter and brown sugar the next time I make them. I used an oval pan that was 12X5. Will definately use this recipe again!

This was not very good at all.  I was very excited about making these because they took such a short time to make, but I will be going back to my usual recipe because these are dry and taste like they came out of a box.

We loved this recipe! Ramadan is coming up for the muslims  and I plan to make this atleast twice in the next month for breakfast. The only things I would and did do differently were to use only 1/4 stick of butter. I baked mine on a cookie sheet (these were too large for muffine cups, even before baking) and add about 3 tbsps more white sugar so I can skip the frosting. Otherwise they were perfect.

These were AWESOME... I used margarine because that was all I had, but will use butter next time in hopes that the cinnamon filling stays in the roll better; with the margarine the filling was a little too soft.

I didn't have enough brown sugar for the filling so I substituted with part white sugar and these still came out great.  I also cooked them in a 9x13 pan.  Mine were still done in just about 20 minutes.

I NEVER rate recipes but I had to on this one! This turned out great! I had to add some more flour to the dough but other than that, I did everything exactly like the recipe. Picture perfect cinnamon rolls!

Not impressed. The cinnamon mixture was way too much for the dough and I ended up doing away with half of it. Once baked, what mixture I had put on the dough essentially disappeared and I was left with baked dough balls. I have a recipe that takes about 3.5 hours to make delicious cinnamon rolls. I was hoping this would be easier and just as tasty in half the time. Unfortunately, I wish I had gone the 3.5 hour route.

This recipe took me about 3 hrs to complete. I was a bit confused about the different amounts of butter and at which part you added which amount? I also had to use 2 13x9 glass pans because for some reason the dough was enormous lol. But the final product was absolutely delicious. I was worried that they'd need icing but they were so good without that I'm not even worried about it. Great recipe-Thanks for sharing!

Very good but wondering if there any way the dough could be made in the evening and then refrigerated until morning so I don't have to get up at 6am to make them?  Would I do everything, even letting it rise the last 30 minutes and then put it in the frig overnight?

really easy to make, and it tastes perfectly, even it's my 1st time making cinnnamon roll.  Instead of using muffin cup, I arrange the 12 pieces in a 8.5" square pan, it comes out like a bakery-buy cinnamon roll.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy and the rolls turned out great.  I used the dough hook on my mixer to knead, and I doubled the cinnamon and added some pecans.  The dough was very easy to work with.  Made a cream cheese frosting as well, and everyone loved these.

These are easy and tasty.  I make them more often than I would if they took longer. I often find myself adding more flour, but other than that I keep everything the same.

These are so good, and so easy!   I added just a smidgen more flour to mine, for a high altitude adjustment.   I made 3 batches last night....one with just the cinnamon/brown sugar/butter mix in the center, one with some chopped pecans in the filling, and one with chocolate chips in the filling.  All were awesome!   I topped all of them with the cream cheese frosting provided by MPCHARVAT, and they were amazing!  I sent them to work with my BF this morning, and his crew demolished them.  This recipe is definately a keeper!  :)

Excellent, made it using my kitchen aid was easy peasy. The only thing I did different was to use butter and not margarine, as we only ever buy butter. Also I used fresh yeast in place of dried yeast. I was skeptical about the dough because it looked like a hard block but I rolled it out, was not difficult at all. Spread the cinnamon mixture over it, rolled it up cut it, and placed it in a 9x13 inch pan as many others have suggested. When the 30 minute rising time was up, they totally filled the pan. They looked wonderful and were not too sticky icky gooey but a real cinnamon roll! I put a bit of cream cheese on top mixed with a bit of powdered sugar and vanilla sugar. Excellent! Will make these again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  I made them tonight and they are delish!  I didn't use a muffin pan, but instead spaced them out on a 12x9, and made them a touch bigger and it yielded 9 buns, instead of 12.  They tasted fantastic with a little icing glaze (icing sugar, dash of vanilla and a couple tablespoons of cream).  The only change I would make is that when I make them again I'll use a smaller pan so they stick together and become a bit more gooey.  All in all, a wonderful recipe that I'll be using again!

These were good, but not great. Very easy to make though. I would suppose the frosting/glaze used would make the difference in taste.

i didn't think i was going to like this recipe, but it had good reviews so i figured i'd give it a shot. i was skeptical near the end with the way they looked when i rolled them up and baked them. then i ate one. and they are AMAZING! i added chocolate chips and brought them to work - they were gone in a flash! i will definitely be making them again. oh, one thing. i baked mine in a pan, and tried a few in a muffin tin. the ones in the muffin tin burned. :( so i'd use a regular pan! other than that, awesome and delicious!

Thank you, GoofyDebbie, for this recipe. I now use it for a similar recipe handed down to me from my grandmother: it's a German sweetbread. It never came out right because the milk/water was never the right temp. for the yeast. Every time I use your recipe I never have a problem w/ that. I give it 10 stars.

These are delicious and easy!  I made the recipe exactly as directed, with the exception of using butter in the dough instead of margarine and I left out the raisins. In the filling, I used 1/2 c. of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and it turned out absolutely fine.  Like some other posters, my dough never rose until I actually put the rolls into the oven, but that wasn't a big deal.  I baked these in a round cake pan, and there wasn't a ton of room for them to expand so they did look a little ugly when they came out of the oven.  They weren't stuck together though, and they looked absolutely fine after I slathered some glaze on them (just powdered sugar and milk). If I were making these to impress someone, or to take them to an event, I would use a 9x13. Making them as a Breakfast Night dinner for my family though, I'd use the cake pan again. It baked for about 30-35 minutes, and they were incredibly moist and gooey. Even the leftovers tasted just as good the next day. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the dough needed several more heaping teaspoons of flour added to it...it would have been way too sticky to roll otherwise.  I did everything in my KitchenAid...used the beater attachment first and then switched to the dough hook when it needed to be kneaded.  Once put together in the pan, I threw them in the fridge for a few hours before I baked them, and they were fine...just let them rest for a 1/2 hr. on the counter before they go in the oven.

Great rolls!!  Everyone needs to try these!!  I made 3 pans (1 to keep) and 2 for a slilent auction for a benefit.  One pan brought $25 and the other $20.  I couldn't believe that you only had to let them raise once.  What a time saver

Great recipe!! I used a 9x13 pan and then added a glaze after they got done baking.  Glaze= 1 cup powered sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 2tbsp milk. Mix together in small bowl and drizzle on top of rolls.  I doubled the glaze recipe because i like lots of glaze.

This was my first attempt at Cinnamon Rolls and I was so pleased. They came out perfect!! I did add pecans, and a really light glaze, but I don't think those things should affect the rating. Wonderful recipe!!!

Because I am allergic to milk, it is hard to come across recipes that can use alternatives. I followed this recipe using non-dairy margarine and soy milk. These turned out great and were easy to make!

I had to modify these a little because my son is lactose intolerant. I used a soy based butter substitute and Vanilla flavored Almond milk. Instead of the cream cheese icing, I just stirred some of the Vanilla flavored Almond milk with some confectioners sugar to make a nice icing to drizzle on top. My son loved them - he said to make sure I hid them from his Dad!

Simply incredible. One of the best items I have ever baked. I used unbleached flour, organic eggs and organic cane sugar to make it a little healthier. That all went out the window when I made the Cinnamon Bun Icing from this site to top the rolls with, but oh well! These beat a certain famous cinnamon roll bakery chain hands down. Serve them to your non-baking friends - they'll think you're a genius.

This recipe is a keeper. Cooked them for breakfast this Christmas morning. Only change I made was adding half a cup of walnut pieces along with the raisins. My family all gave this two thumbs up! There were no leftovers. Thanks for sharing.

Good, but nothing better than what we already make so won't be doing these again. For those who don't have a roll recipe you might want this.  We didn't like the way the recipe called for the yeast mix in with the other dry ingredients.  Yeast does better with warm water & in some recipes the sugar. Then, let it work into a foam better adding dry ingredients.

WOW!  These are quick, easy and delicious!  I will DEFINITELY make these again!  They were good without the frosting, but I did top half of them with a store bought vanilla frosting...the fam loves them.  One note....Put the muffin tins on a cookie sheet, or place a cookie sheet below them...they puff up and overflow!  (but worth the mess.) :) thanks for sharing!!!!!

I would have rated these as a 3-star recipe, but my husband and kids thought they were great, so I'm rating it as a 4-star recipe. My dough never rose until the rolls were put in the oven, the filling made a drippy mess (so definitely put a catch tray underneath), and they were really dry on the top. I will give these one more try, but use a 9"x13" pan instead and see if the outcome is better...

It's hard NOT to like cinnamon roll recipes.  I used this one to try out using part whole wheat flour (substituted one cup).  They were dense, rising didn't happen very much.  The outcome was pretty good.  I added homemade cream cheese icing (see the 2nd or 3rd review).  I would try them again for sure!

This was my first time making anything with yeast. They turned out perfect! I made them in a Pyrex 9x13 rectangular pan and used baking paper to line the pan. I also made a little extra of the cinnamon butter sugar mixture and spread on top right before baking.  I used a vanilla glaze recipe from the site. I made the batch and my boyfriend LOVED them! He said: "Babe, these are better than that place in the mall. I can't even remember the name." He was referring to Cinnabon! lol After they sat in a the cake container over night, I froze some in an airtight container. They still taste great 2 weeks later! I take one out of the freezer and by the time I get to work its defrosted enough to warm in the microwave to have with my coffee. Great recipe!

These tasted delicious hot out of the oven.  I like the quick rise yeast method of adding the yeast with the dry ingredients. I thought the filling was perfect in taste, but it baked out onto my muffin tin and was a bit messy.  I think next time I will cut the rolls to fill about 2/3 of the tin and make a second pan if needed.  The way the middles pop up out of the rolls makes for a beautiful cinnamon roll.  I reheated them this morning and topped with butter, still yummy!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it's always a hit. My only suggestion is that if you are baking them in a muffin pan cut the slices thinner than you normally would because they can almost double in size by the time they're done baking. Great recipe.

ive made this recipe a few times: by hand, and by standup mixer. they are very tasty and rise well. i recommend using a standup mixer. your dough will be much more soft and fluffy. i put the yeast in 1/4 cup water and add 1/2 tsp sugar. let it sit until foamy for about 5-8 minutes. i add it in with the other wet ingredients. let the dough rise and need it.  add a little brown sugar and butter to a rectangular pan and bake.I also make a simple cream cheese frosting, and drizzle it over the  hot rolls. oh so delicious :) BIG HIT !

Great easy recipe.  Dough comes out larger than the 13 X 9".  I doubled the sugar/cinnamon topping and added 1/2 c. white sugar in place of 1/2 c. brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 3 - 4 oz. cream cheese for filling.  I used 3/4 of mixture for filling and dribbled the remainder over the top before throwing in the oven.  Then I baked until golden brown.

These are not worth the effort. I was hoping with all the extra time (as compared to canned cinnamon rolls) these would be great. I prefer the canned ones. The dough really lacked any flavor at all. It was much heavier than I expected. The cinnamon mixture just ran out all underneath the rolls and only left a trace inside the roll. I will continue my quest for awesome homemade cinnamon rolls.

i made this so my husband could take it into work today for Mother's Day and all his staff loved it!! i followed the recipe to the T, but the only difference i did was instead of baking it right away, i cut it up into 12 equal pieces and placed them in the lightly greased muffin tins then i covered it up with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. before putting it in the 375 degree oven i let it sit out for about 30 minutes then baked it for 17 minutes and frosted them with the frosting from the "Savory Cinnamon Rolls" recipe. of course i will making this again, but only on special occasions..my husband and i can't eat all this by ourselves!!

My husband, who is the "baking goods specialist" in our home, loved this recipe. They came out gooey and delicious. We added chopped walnuts and extra cinnamon to brown sugar mixture, but it would have been great even without them.

Ackk! They burned! Oven temp too high, I guess, and maybe in too long (25 min in 9x13 pans).  May try again, but definitely bake at 325 and watch closely!

Good flavor, but mine didn't rise and were a little rubbery. Won't try this one again, but it could have been my yeast, not sure what went wrong. Followed the directions to a T, but the results weren't very good.

Tips for making it even better!--Roll the dough very thin, spread the filling out thinly, put it into a pan, and TURN THE PAN UPSIDE DOWN immediately after taking it out of the oven--that way the syrup will not all sink to the bottom.  I put mine in a 9x13 pan, which worked great!  I also made the cream cheese frosting from the "Clone of Cinnabon" recipe on this site.  All in all, five stars!  Excellent the first day, hot out of the oven, and excellent the second day, warmed up in the microwave!  Yum--I'll be making these again!

Excellent!!! Very easy to make, these were so good, my husband and I couldn't stop eating them. The next time I make them I'm going to add chopped pecans to the cinnamon topping, that should make them extra tasty.

i completely followed the recipe, so i'm not sure why these didn't work for me; the dough was SO stiff - too much flour!  perhaps because i'm in a dry climate... but these turned out more crusty than fluffy.  won't make these again.

I'm not a huge cinnabon fan but my husband is so I decided to try this recipe since the reviews were so good. I had NO previous experience using yeast and was pretty clueless about what I was about to attempt. My mom had some active dry yeast so that's what I used. I kept to the recipe except for using a 9x13 pan instead of the muffin pan. Since I never made anything with yeast before I wasn't sure how much it was supposed to rise before baking. It didn't seem to rise very much during the first "resting" period. They did spread out in the pan before baking so I felt better after that. I then made a simple powdered sugar/milk/vanilla extract icing because my husband likes things sweet although it wasn't overly sweet even with the extra icing. Everyone loved them. My husband ate 2. Would definitely make again.

Wow!  Thank you!  This is the first time I've made cinnamon rolls, and they turned out wonderfully!  I was a little worried because they didn't quite double. But, they turned out fluffy, moist and gooey!  I added cream cheese frosting on top, sensational!

These are delicious! The only thing I did differently was just before baking I put more of the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. Next time I'll probably double the mixture because one can never have enough. I made some cream cheese icing to go with these and boy were they wonderful!

This was the quickest and easiest cinnamon rolls ever. I was always intimidated by cinnamon roll recipes but this one was so easy, we will be making it again every Christmas morning. I gave it 4 stars not because of anything wrong with the recipe but it was slightly harder than I thought it should be. I put them in the frig overnight and sat them out for an hour before baking, they were wonderful but not as soft as I had expected, other than that, perfect!!!

I mixed these up last night, and put them in a 9X13 pan in the fridge overnight.  This morning, I set them out for about an hour and baked for 25 minutes.  I frosted them with the cream cheese frosting suggested by MPCHARVAT.  DELICIOUS!!!  And very, very easy--the dough was the easiest yeast dough I've worked with.  Not too sticky, but still tender.  I will definitely use this in the future.  Thanks so much for a delicious Christmas breakfast recipe!*UPDATE* Tonight I made these as regular hot rolls--after the 10 minute rest, I shaped them into balls, baked for 20 minutes in a 9X13 pan and brushed with melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven.  Also delicious, and so easy!!!

I've tried many cinnamon roll recipe they never turned out right. I finally found a good one! The dough even doubled! That had never happened in the other recipes I had tried. Very moist.  I made them just as indicated, but I didn't have muffin pans so I just placed them on a cookie sheet for the same amount of time.  My boyfriend at 3 in a row and 2 more in the evening.  They were all gone in the same day!!!!

i am making 2 dozen of these right now! my son turned 5 today, and he didnt want bday cake..he wanted these cinnamon rolls. my 70 yr old mom told me these were the best cinnamon rolls she has ever eaten. they were really moist. i poured a little bit of melted butter over the tops of them after baking. i also added raisins and nuts to the inside. since i didnt have any quick yeast, i used regular and just gave them a little bit of extra time to rise better. these were pretty easy to do.

This was my first attempt at making my own cinnamon rolls, they turned out amazing! Very moist and delicious. As suggested before, I baked them in a baking dish, and i also added a little bit more melted butter, sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. For the frosting I used a recipe from this site that calls for 1 (3 oz) package of cream cheese, softened; 1/4 cup of butter, softened; 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar; 1/2 tsp vanilla extract; 1/8 tsp salt. Just beat all together and spread of warm rolls.

Loved these! I made mine a bit smaller (24 instead of 12) and froze half. They are gret even after freezing! I made a powdered sugar icing and topped the warm rolls with it. Will definitely make again!

I'm eating this right now and had to write the review immediately. These are AMAZING. They took me just under 2 hours though (because I tend to not prep ahead of time), and they actually rose kind of funny in the oven, "tim burtony" describes them. I put them in a 9x13 pan and baked for 25 minutes, took them out when brown on top but still soft (not doughy) inside. I thought 1 tbsp cinnamon wouldn't be enough but it's perfect!! I topped them with cream cheese frosting someone else mentioned on here and they're delicious. I don't think I've ever had a cinnamon roll this good.

These are the best rolls I have ever made.  They really are tender and moist.  I did cut the brown sugar filling in half as some others suggested and they came out very sweet without being overwhelmingly so.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the fill.  Frosted them with a buttery vanilla white glaze. This recipe is a keeper!!

Very good, sweet enough to not have a frosting on top but... what's a cinnamon roll without the cream cheese topping?!  Here's how I make my frosting:    2oz cream cheese 1.5t. vanilla 1/2t. salt 1T. white sugar  This recipe also really only took 90min.  The rolls didn't seem to rise as much as I hoped simply because they really weren't given much time to rise, but after baking them they had taken on the size I was looking for.  (Oh, and the raisins are a must!)

I make these every time someone asks for cinnamon rolls, it's gotten me a bit of fame in the neighborhood, as well as amongst my friends and family. The texture is light, and heavenly. I like to top them with a cream cheese glaze, or a plain vanilla glaze.

INCREDIBLE. I have made a lot of cinnamon buns in my day... and this one nailed it! Thank you so much. I thought there would be too much filling but it worked and the rolls pulled from the pan so easily! I put them all in a 9 x 9 pan.

I made these cinnamon rolls last Saturday and my family really enjoyed them, except that they were too sweet.  I will make them again and cut down down on the sugar.   This was my first time making cinnamon rolls from scratch and it was much easier than I thought.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have always liked homemade cinnamon rolls alot better then store bakery ones, and these ones were realy good. I will be making them often. The taste was great and the bread was good. I topped mine off with a caramel glaze, made from 1/4 cup of milk and a couple Tbls of brown sugar boiled on the stove then removed and added a tsp of vanilla and powdered sugar till a nice glazy consistancy.

These were very good, and fairly easy!  I baked mine almost 20 minutes, but it depends for everyone depending on the size of the rolls.  I used cream cheese II from this site, and it was very good with it!  I also used butter, not margarine.

Can't really give much of a suggestion on how to improve this!! I'm an icing lover and thought no way can I attempt these and not make icing - but honestly none was needed. I cooked mine in a large baking dish (which I buttered and floured) as I like to pull the rolls apart. Good suggestions earlier re: dough being sticky, no icing needed. This is a genuine 5 STAR rating!!!

I have to start off by saying-- these were the most delicious cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten. However, there were a couple small problems. I would recommend putting them in the oven for only 15 minutes, and checking on them then. Ours were perfect by 17 minutes. Plus, there was some cinnamon-y liquid that ended up in the muffin cups after we took out the rolls. I don't know how to fix that, but there must be some way. (flip them over after about 8 minutes?) Anyway, these were abolutely FANTASTIC.

I was originally going to give this 3 stars because my dough was extremely sticky and uncooperative, even after adding another 1/2 cup of flour. However, the end result was amazingly good! But I used active dry yeast instead of instant, so it took longer than the 90 minutes. I also added some of the recommended cream cheese frosting and they were to die for. I actually think I like them more than cinnabon... and I LOVE cinnabon.  EDIT: I made these again for a bake sale (still with active dry yeast not instant) and this time my dough was very easy to handle and they came out great.

I made this for my family on Sunday and they loved them.  I used 100% Stone ground Whole Wheat flour as well as Active dry yeast packet (verus the instant)- the difference is that you use the 1/4 cup water with some sugar to activate the yeast before adding it to the dry ingrediatns. I also used real butter. Very delicious!- My husband and daughter couldn't even tell that it was whole wheat!

i made these for my dad for father's day and he was totally suprised and loved them! They took me longer than ninety minutes, but that probly just me. I thought that the filling was maybe a little too buttery, but everyone else said that they liked them the way they were. i was glad that these didn't call for a bread machine. i just served them plain and they were a great success!!

These are awesome cinnamon rolls! Like other reviewers, I found the dough to be very sticky, and ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour in the mixing bowl, plus an additional 2 tbsps while kneading. Fortunately, the additional flour didn't seem to affect the finished product which had a soft, not-"bready", texture. The type of yeast I used was one package of Fleischmann's Rapid Rise Yeast. I took other reviewer's suggestions and increased the "filling" ingredients as follows: butter to 3/4 cup, brown sugar to 1 1/4 cup, and cinnamon to 1 1/2 tbsps. (Plus I sprinkled with the suggested 1/2 cup raisins). After rolling up the dough, I sliced it into 18 slices which I placed side-by-side in a 9 X 13 greased pan. Baked for 15 minutes, and they came out beautifully. They were sweet enough (with the "filling" changes) that they didn't need a glaze. However, next time ---in order to cut back on calories-- I'll try the original filling and after baking, will drizzle a light powdered-sugar glaze over top. This will be the cinnamon roll recipe I use from now on.

Easy to make & very gooey. I did  melt extra butter, sugar and cinnamon to pour on top of the rolls before baking. Recommend topping with cream cheese icing. I've made them the night before and placed them in refrigerator after rising as well as same day and they turn out the same.  Great!

I woke up one morning with a craving for cinnamon rolls and being an impatient person, I didn't want to wait all day for them to be ready. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. We had homemade cinnamon rolls on the table before you knew it and they were really good too! Thanks!

I was nervous about making these because I had active dry yeast instead of instant and I had never worked with yeast before....My rolling process was a little messy...But the end result was fabulous, they looked and tasted great...Thanks for a great recipe, I will be making these at least twice a month.

I was so impressed with this recipe, that this is my first written review.  I've had my share of making cinnamon rolls from different recipes and almost all of them would never turn out right.  But this recipe came out perfect-wow!  I don't know what I did right, but I did tweak the recipe as I try to use whole wheat flour in my baking.  I used 2 cups of white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and left out the extra 1/4 cup.  I used 3/4 cup of rice milk since I have a daughter who is allergic to milk, and used 2 eggs since the wheat flour absorbs so much liquid.  I also added about 1/2 tsp more of yeast.  It rose great and turned out just like the picture!  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe. Thank you so much. I have added nuts, raisons, and cinnamon in my glaze. My only problem is if i don't transfer the buns as soon as they come out of the oven, the brown sugar that is on the bottom will cool and become a sheet of sugar glaze. Anyone else have that problem? I posted a review and pics many months ago, but have know idea why they were not there. Thank you so much.

Just lovely, fast and friendly kind of recipe. I didn't change a thing and only have one suggestion...at the end if baking in a dish, flip them over to cool (I believe someone else suggested this first) It works like a charm, anything that's ooey and gooey drips back on the rolls.

Perhaps it was my fault, as this recipe is highly rated. I followed the directions as written.   My dough barely rose (but I didn't kill the yeast or anything). It rose plenty in the oven, but the result was a hard, dry dough.

FABULOUS!!! No joke! I can't begin to tell you how many times I have tried recipes only to be horribly disappointed in the final product. This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I had tried several other cinnamon roll recipes and they just didn't make the cut. I added a few finely crushed walnuts along with the raisins. I used a simple icing (even though the buttery rich gooyness made the rolls sweet enough to eat alone). Rather than baking them in muffin pan I placed them in a 10inch round cake pan and let them rise in the pan. Watch your baking time so they don't overbake. I will definitely make these again, and again!

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls.  My 10 year old daughter, her friend, and I made a batch this mornings.  The girls said it was the best they ever had in their lives.  It was super easy to make.  I did let it rise twice, 1st time after kneading and the second time after cutting the rolls out with dental floss.  I used a basic glaze of 1/4 c butter, 3 T fat free milk, 1 T vanilla, and 2 c powdered sugar.  It definitely gets you on a sugar high!!!

A wonderful way to start the day!  I'm rather inexperienced with making these, so I ended up leaking the filling all over the counter, but the end result was still delicious!  I make a cream cheese frosting to top them and the kids AND my husband gobbled them up!  I would recommend putting an extra pan under the muffin pan to catch the drippings as the butter did drip all over the stove.

Wow! Simply amazing! They were very tender and delicious, the perfect combination of flavours. The only changes I made was that I added some cinnamon to the dough itself, I let them rise for about an hour before baking, and I baked them in a cake pan. I only baked them for 17 minutes, and they were perfect! I also mixed some brown sugar and milk together and poured it over the buns right before baking. It made them nice and gooey, and they didn't dry out at all! I will definitely make this recipe again. Over and over again! Thanks!

Perfect! I made 8 larger ones instead of 12 and baked them in a 9x9 dish for 30 minutes. I also topped them with a milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla glaze.  Easy and quick to make and oh so yummy!

My kids helped make these for breakfast, and they were delicious! Ours took a little longer than 90 minutes, but that was because I didn't have any instant yeast. I used dry active instead, mixed it in 1/2 cup water, let it foam for about 10 minutes, and then added it to the rest of the ingredients. After letting the dough rise about an hour, we prepared the cinnamon rolls as directed and placed them in a 9x13 pan. The second rise took about 40 minutes. My kids were thrilled to see the rolls puffed up to fill the whole pan! We baked according to directions & frosted with cream cheese icing. We will be making these again and again. Thanks!

These were an absolute hit with everyone! They are pretty easy to make - I made the dough in the evening, cut, put in pan, and then left in refrigerator overnight. Baked them in the morning--everyone raved! Will definitely make again! (It was even my first time making cinnamon rolls from scratch!!)  **Used cream cheese frosting from Clone of a Cinnabon recipe, spread on warm rolls. YUMMMMMMMMMMM!

I could not believe the success I had in making these! I wasn't sure if I had to proof the yeast first, but I just added it in the mixture dry and they came out fine. Only problem was that the dough didnt double as quickly as it was supposed to, but I had time. I think I'll substitute coconut milk and add semi-sweet chocolate chips and coconut flakes the next time I make these. Be careful with these when in the oven. I wanted to check them after 25 mins and didn't get to them until after 28 mins, and that was all it took to overcook 'em. THey were still great, just a tad browner.

Very good.  I did not add nuts or raisins but will next time.  I will also add a bit of flour to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture to keep from melting to the bottom of the pan.  I used the cream cheese frosting recommended by another poster which was a wonderful addition to the recipe.  Hubby said "make these again!".  And I will.

One word: mmmmmmm! This was our first time baking cinnamon rolls, and they turned out great. We added 1/4 walnuts in the filling then sprinkled another 1/4 on top. They did take a little while longer than expected to rise, but the results were definitely worth it.

Really quite good, though I did let them rise a bit longer than the time suggested here. Also, about topping: The filling is actually rich enough to make frosting unnecessary, so this recipe really is complete!

Without question, the very best cinnamon rolls I've EVER had. Totally easy to make, I made them with quick yeast the first time and the next day made them with regular yeast (I was out of the quick kind) and just let it rise, kneeded it again and then put it in the fridge overnight and baked in the morning. I used the cream cheese frosting suggested in the first review. So good!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok so I jsut started the whole baking from scratch thing thanks to my sister in law. I found this recipe the other day and i thought hey why not. I made it tonight with my husband and it was GREAT! I made an icing with confectioners sugar and milk and drizzled it on top of the rolls when they were done. I think it was a great recipe to start out with. Two thumbs up!

First time making Cinnamon Rolls.  REALLY YUMMY recipe.  I made the dough in the food processor and the dough turned out great.
I would recommend rolling the dough out larger than 9x12.  They were thicker than I would have liked but delicious nonetheless!

These truly are fantastic!  They are very quick and the sugary middle is just right.  I baked them in a 13x9 and drizzled extra butter, sugar and cinnamon on top.  They turned out perfectly!  Thank you, thank you!!

Just delicious and decadent!  The kiddos helped me and we had a blast- they were easy and turned out just like the photo!  We made a simple sugar glaze for the top but it was not needed- so sweet as it is, truthfully.  Will surely do this one again for a Saturday treat!

First time I've ever made cinnamon rolls...and they turned out GREAT!!  Next time...and there WILL be a next time:)...I will try to roll tighter and cut the rolls out by using string around the roll.  The cutting part was a bit messy and I had to put it back together somewhat when I was laying the rolls on the tray.   But after resting and then baking...They looked fabulous.   They were nice and fluffy and tasted great.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe!  I read some of the reviews for tips.  Make sure your milk temp is on point and the humidity is key. I had to add more flour because I didn't realize that point til after the fact.  I used a casserole dish to bake.  Which was great because the sugar got nice and gooey all around the buns.  Great recipe! It's a keeper for sure.

These tasted really good made them with my youngest son. Although it took longer than 90min it was worth it. They didn't last to long.
I now make this all the time in  a large baking tin just as stated. My kids love this!

I have made these cinn rolls 3 times already since finding it!  I have NEVER attempted to make my own dough for anything I have ever made before! BUT it turned out great!  Don't forget about your dough rising though-- I did on one of the batches.  It wouldn't kneed out. ALSO- make sure your butter is softened when making the cinnamon goo for the inside.  I accidently melted mine, and it went EVERYWHERE except staying inside the roll when I rolled it up.  Just follow the directions and enjoy. These are awesome!

These were so quick and easy. I usually make the Cinnabon clones but I actually prefer the texture of these. I made a frosting with 1/3 cup margarine, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar,1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tbsp milk. I will make these again.

These cinnamon rolls are ok.  I have made them two times now in good faith, but the dough is just too dry and fluffy for me. I even reduced the baking time the second time so that they were barely golden. I prefer cinnamon rolls to be moist even a little on the dense side and sticky. I won't make them again.

Good and pretty easy, does take longer than 90 minutes, more like 2 hours, still, if you do not have a bread machine this is perfect. I followed the directions exactly, except I added a cream cheese frosting. The frosting is 4 oz. of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of softened butter, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, pinch of salt, 1-2 tablespoons of milk depending on desired consistency.

Have made these one to many times! We are out of control we cant stop at just one! I used "Clone of Cinnabon" icing. I had to use extra flour when it came time to knead. Also as you can see from my photo I did not use a muffin pan.

Excellent recipe, of many that I tried in my quest to make a cinnamon roll! I replaced 2 c. of flour with golden buffalo whole wheat flour and they came out amazing, I just had to increase the rise time for the yeast to act against the heavier flour.
I was also able to make these vegan without a hitch. I used Earthbalance vegan buttery sticks, and Tofutti vegan "cream cheese." I've made them both vegan and with "the real thing"...butter, eggs, all that good stuff. I prefer the real thing, but the vegan ones are quite popular with the alternative croud here. Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a good cinnamon roll recipe that didn't require a bread machine...these came out great. I used the dough for this one and made the filling and icing following the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' recipe.

WONDERFUL!! Absolutely delicious - so gooey and sticky and .. mmmmm!
I am usually hopeless with yeast cooking but these worked out brilliantly.  I put mine on a 25 x 35 cm pan at 150 / 160 degrees C (fan oven) and in about 11 minutes they were lovely and golden.
I made a glaze with milk, icing sugar and vanilla, although they were already sweet enough for most people's tastes! Try this recipe!!

These werewonderful! I followed the recipe as stated, but then put them in 2 round cake pans. I refridgerated them overnight and put 1 pan out early the next morning to come to room temp. and rise. They cooked up beautifully and the guests I had over for coffee LOVED them. I did use cream cheese frosting, but not too much, they are sweet and yummy alone! I used the other pan the next day - 2 days of cinnamon rolls! WHAT COULD BE BETTER? The dough was fantastically easy to work with (I used my KithenAid mixer to knead it) and something I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

this is my first time makeing cinnamon rolls. I made them in 12 rolls in a pan. A lot of my filling ended up at the bottom of the pan and I had a hard time telling if the dough was cooked all the way through. Is there a special way to roll these?
I also topped them with cream cheese topping recipe left by another reviewer.
Over all I thought they were pretty good. I will try them again with some modifications

I've always been told that cinnamon rolls are really hard to make.  These cinnamon rolls were easy!  They taste great and have a bit more of a real food kind of feel instead of dessert.  I can eat one and actually feel satisfied (but who eats just one after smelling them bake!)  Definitely something to try, even if you have never made cinnamon rolls from scratch before.

My family said these were the best cinnamon rolls they've ever had.  I made them up the night before, and put them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and set them in the fridge.  I went to sleep thinking of how gorgeous they would be baked up in the morning....  I got up, let them rise, and well, they all opened up into very lose pinwheels and were very funny looking.  We decided next time to put them in a 9x13 baking pan close together. We decided I should make these every Saturday night for a Sunday mornig treat.

I've tried a few other cinnamon roll recipes, which were much more difficult and time consuming than these, but these were by far the BEST!! This is a simple recipe that produces an outstanding cinnamon roll. Add the frosting, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup softened margarine, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp salt...and it's to die for. I don't have cream cheese but the frosting is good without it. These don't last an hour in my house. I do like to bake 9 of them in a lightly greased round pan and the other 3 in the muffin pans. I've already given this recipe to my sister...who loved them...and my mother...who also loved them. Thanks for the recipe, Debbie. It's a keeper for me.

Excellent. HOWEVER,  I DO NOT take the time to stuff them into muffin cups. I line them up on a large baking sheet. I found that when I tried stuffing them into the muffin cups they rose (popped up) right out of the muffin cups. Better to place them on a cookie sheet IMO. 
DELICIOUS!!!

these are "finger lickin good"  the only trouble i have found with these is that when you roll them they get very messy very quickly.  the cinnamon filling oozes out and i would recommend that you only do about 3/4 of the mixture on the dough and save the rest to pour over before you bake.  mine ended up very very delicious.

These were absolutely wonderful.  It was my first time to make homemade cinnamon rolls.  I was very surprised how "easy" these were.  I also really liked that the recipe did not use a bread machine.

These were very delish.  I added an additional 3/4 Cup of the cinnamon and suger mixture on top and bottom.  Need to make more as family ate them so fast, I cooked, they ate, I washed pan.  And this all happened within 8 hours.  What can I say, "We're all the piggies around here"

These were really fun to make, and easy too! Simple to make! Like someone else said, I would put a pan under the cupcake trays- I have a big sticky mess to clean up in my oven! I made 14 and almost 2 minutes after I frosted them, I was left with only 3! Very delicious. The only thing about these is that... the cinnamon sugar gooey insides always bubble out, and I'm left with cinnamon bread. I can't figure out how to keep the ooey gooeyness inside the roll.

YUMMY, EASY...
Healthier Option(for dairy intolerance):
soymilk for milk
margarine for butter
definitely add pecans/raisins
I had ZERO problems with this recipe!

Our family loved these and I have to say I used 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast in place of the instant yeast packet and that seemed to do the trick thankfully.
I was skeptical but I'm glad I did it anyway. I also used my kitchenaid mixer which was a nice help.  Afer making these last night I decided to only bake 4 of them to see how they'd come out (because of the yeast alteration) they spread apart too much and didn't hold together in shape well but the others I left in the freezer overnight in the pan covered in plastic wrap and pulled out and put directly in the oven for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  I let the rest as someone else suggested for a few minutes to cool/firm up.  They were absolutely great and perfect in flavor.  Thanks so much for an excellent/easy recipe.  I would imagine that pecans would be great on these.

Delicious and fast!  I used butter, and rolled, cut and let rise in jelly roll pan.
It's best to not over bake since this can dry them out.  Also, let the rolls rest on the baking pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This helps firm up that butter, sugar and cinnamon filling.

Great recipe.  I put them in mini bundt pans and they turned out great!  I've been looking for a cinnamon roll recipe that doesn't take hours and hours and this one is perfect.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook attachment-which worked well.  I needed to add a tablespoon more butter (didn't use margarine) and another tablespoon milk to get the the right consistency. Don't be afraid of using yeast on this one-it couldn't be easier!

These are soooo good!  I consider myself "yeast bread" challenged and these turned out fantastic!  I feel there's hope for me yet.  This might already be noted, but I heated up the butter brown sugar mix and it was oozing out when I rolled them up.  Next time I won't do that.  Also, I might make them a little thinner next time.  Oh yeah, I also used cream cheese icing. Yum yum yum!

Thank you for this recipe!

LOVED it! It took a little longer to raise but it was a little cool here. I put them into 2 fudge/enchilada pans and baking them for 20 min. was too long. Otherwise perfect!

Excellent recipe!  I've made these twice...this last time I substituted 1 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 c wheat germ for some of the all-purpose flour just to make them a little bit healthier and they were just as excellent.**update 2018** these are my “go to” cinnamon rolls. I have made these for years now. I always make them per the recipe in a 13x9 pan. I have never had an issue with the cinnamon mixture leaking out ever because the pan keeps it contained.. I’ve never made them in a muffin tin nor would I because of the mixture in the middle. These turn out perfect every time whether I use all white flour or wheat. We love them!! I also bake them at 350 not 375. But my oven tends to run high on temp.

I don't know if I did something wrong or if it's the recipe, but these didn't turn out well. The sugar/cinn. mixture you sprinkle on the inside of the cinn. rolls was waaaay too much because after they were done baking, it was just a runny mess and the sugar burned so they were all crusty on the bottom. I was very disappointed. But we ate a few of the tops and they weren't too bad.

Very easy to make with everyday ingredients.  I had everything in my kitchen to make these.  They came out wonderfully!  Nice and sweet but not overly so.  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because they need an icing.  Then they'd be perfect!

Excellent quick and easy recipe.  If you want a quick cinnamon roll recipe this is perfect.  It was 90 minutes start to finish and the only thing I did add was a cream cheese frosting when finished.  I preferred it without the frosting but my kids have more of a sweet tooth than me.  I also used butter in place of margarine.

Mmmmnnnn....I used small ramikans instead of a muffin tin because I only made a couple then froze the rest.  I took someone's suggestion and spread the margerine (not a 1/2 c., just as much as i needed) over the dough then spread the dry cinnamon/brown sugar mixture over the dough.  I lined the ramikans with some shortening and extra of the cinnamon mixture.  I also made a quick glaze with milk/shortening/powdered sugar. YUM!

These are fabulous. I used butter instead of margarine, and I put a glaze over the top. The dough does come out soft--not dry like some recipes. Be sure to put a pan under these to catch the drips in the oven!

Hey there!!  They were wonderful... simply wonderful!  I generally stay away from recipes that call for yeast... but after reading Verena's review below, I decided to give it a go - and i'm extremely glad I did :o) they turned out beautifully.. I can't express my joy at seeing them rise - Thanx Debbie! :o)  Also, this is a great basic recipe for buns... you can just add loads of herbs and call it a herb roll too :o)

Very tasty, probably high calorie when combined with the cream cheese frosting recipe.  I wasn't able to do it in 90 minutes but then I wasn't really trying.
   Will definitely make this one again.

These are awesome!  I prefer using butter rather than margarine for the cinnamon filling, it tastes better. I forgot to soften it first, however I used a pastry blender to cut it into the sugar & cinnamon and it worked fine.  Super easy to prepare.

YUMMY! Either these are really good, or I'm just excited because I rarely eat this kind of thing. My goodness, they're wonderful -- the dough is light and the cinnamon-butter inside is perfect. Plus, they really don't take very long to make!

Wow--these were awesome! I even screwed a couple of things up and they still turned out great. So they get extra points for being idiot-proof, ha!
My husband and I really enjoyed them a lot--especially after I added some cream cheese frosting and sprinkled the rolls with crushed up pecans. YUM!!

Cinnamon Rolls and I forgot the cinnamon! It was still very good. Next, time I won't make the raisins optional- I think their needed. I put the cinn. rolls in the oven to rise, by turning the oven onto low and once it "beeped" or reached the temp, I turned the oven off. There is to much margarine for the mixture, it bubbled over and smoked up the house. I would cut it down to 1/4 cup and keep the brown sugar the same. These seem like their only good when they are warm, we will see. I used a old high school home ec recipe (8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tsp lemon juice and 1 T milk) for cream cheese frosting and it was good. This time I would give it only 3 +, but I forgot the cinn. And with adding raisins and decreasing the butter, I think I would give it a 5. So I will give it a 4 to be fair. Thanks for the recipe!

the first time i made this - just rated it a 4 - mainly b/c yep - they are easy to make but i think really the only thing they are lacking is some frosting... therefore - still a 4 rating - but i make them twice now and will probably make again - and just add some simple frosting to top them off.

For cinnamon rolls, I have had much better.  These were not sweet enough - the inner mixture did not permeate the remaining dough, so you ended up with sugary filling and nonsugary bread.  Whole process is not difficult, but you end up with cinnamon muffins, not rolls.

They were very good while they were still warm.  Yet, after they set over night they were hard and crunchy.  I will not make them again.

Really, really liked this recipe. I am scared of yeast and breads but it turned out great!  My kids loved it. Husband said presentation was lacking but it was my first try....kinda messy to put in muffin pans. I just put it in the 9x13 pan and that allowed the yummy sauce to pool at the bottom for all rolls to share.  It was really good. Thanks!

Pretty easy. I had to add a bit more butter with the sugar and cinnamon to spread, which made it bubble out. I also used sprayed baking cups, which only stuck with the goo, after cooled. Next time I'll just put them in the muffin tins with spray and pop them out immediately out of the oven

Baked them in a 9x12 pan and i made an extra batch of the gooey stuff and put it between the rolls in the pan before baking. I baked them at 360 for 20 minutes.  My guys friends loved them at my lil b-fast party!

Over the months I've made some minor changes to these:  a quarter cup more flour so the dought is still soft but easier to handle, milk instead of water (personal preference, I find that milk makes bread dry out quicker), butter (instead of margarine) in the filling reduced to a quarter cup (takes a bit more time to spread).  The rolls rise up nicely.  I am far too lazy to prepare muffin tins so usually make these in a parchment-lined cake pan.

These were delicious!  Only change I made was using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white for filling, only because I ran out of brown sugar.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.

These were amazing! I ususally pass by anything that uses yeast, because it scares me, but my husband REALLY wanted cinnamon rolls. These were perfect! The only thing I changed was adding 1/2cup more brown sugar to the filling. I also just put them in a 9x13 pan instead of muffin pans. I used the icing recipe from the Cinnabon Clone recipe to top it off.  I'll never use another recipe.

These were great.  I'd never put cinnamon rolls in a muffin pan before--what a good idea. No more flat, spread out cinnamon rolls.  The only thing I changed was I only used 6 T. of butter in the cinnamon filling instead of the 8 T. called for.  I also drizzled a butter/powdered sugar glaze over them when finished.  They were awesome. Will definitely make again!

AWESOME recipe! I TRIPLED the recipe, added chopped walnuts, replaced the raisins for dried cranberries (all I had at the time) and viola! TASTY and MOIST! Everyone at church LOVED THEM!!! I made a cream cheese, butter, vanilla, confectioners sugar and salt (mix all together) frosting for the top. THANK YOU for this E-Z and very good recipe! I do agree that 20 minutes is TOO LONG to bake them. 15-16 minutes in a perfectly calibrated oven is definitely enough time. Just keep an eye on them...when lightly golden brown...THEY ARE DONE! :)

u have to keep adding flour otherwise the dough is ridiculously sticky. With the additional flour that needed to be added, i found the dough was too breadlike.

These are really very delicious.  I might try to make them all in one pan in the future so that there are fewer browned edges.  I used white rather than brown sugar for the filling.  And a powdered sugar glaze is great on them.  But this recipe is basically terrific!

I reviewed this recipe a few weeks ago and gave it three stars because the dough was so difficult to work with and the timing seemed all wrong.  Oops!  I tried it again, and these cinnamon rolls came out UNBELIEVABLY good.  I must have made a mistake with the first batch.

This is an awesome cinnamon roll! I have tried close to 20 different recipies looking for the "right" one  and these are they.  They were nice and fluffy and even moist.  I used 2 8x8 pans and kept one in the fridge and made one for now.  I just pulled the ones out of the fridge a few days later and let them rise and cooked them up and they turned out even better than the first.  I did add a cream cheese frosting what can I say Cinnabon has spoiled me and now I can make my own!

This is an excellent recipe for a girl in a hurry. I have used this dough with the caramel sauce I found in another recipe on this  site -- 1/2 c butter/margarine, 1/2 c vanilla ice cream, 1/2 c brown sugar brought to a boil over medium heat and boiled 5 mins. Pour into bottom of greased 9x13 baking dish and allow to cool while preparing cinnamon rolls. Place rolls in dish to rise and bake. I find it useful to bake the rolls covered in foil for 15 mins or so and then uncover the remaining time. This allows the rolls to be cooked through while preventing overbrowning. The caramel sauce is really what makes the recipe. I've received nothing but compliments and requests that I make more.

I'll give this five stars because these looked perfect and tasted great. The only thing I would say is these where done before the twenty minutes was up so keep an eye on them while there in the oven .

Very good & tasty.  About the only thing I did differently is I put the cut rolls into 2 glass pans lined with aluminum foil.  They rose perfectly & are delicious!

I had a problem getting these rolls to rise, and I followed the recipe perfectly.  I was kind of disappointed after reading all of the great reivews.  I will try again, maybe I did something wrong the first time.

These are great and easy to make.The only thing I did different was to use pecans instead of raisins,I hate raisins.The first time I made these I used a muffin tin and I had a mess to clean up in the oven,the margarine and brown sugar oozed all over.The only thing I really don't like about these are they're too good and I eat them until none are left. :-)

These rolls are wonderful!  I wanted something special for Sunday morning breakfast since that seems to be the only time my teenage children have time to sit down with their parents, and these rolls definitely were a hit!  They were very easy to make Saturday night and reheat Sunday morning. I made a powdered sugar glaze to top them. Now my family wants me to make them at least once a month!

I had a problem getting these rolls to rise. They stayed pretty flat. They tasted pretty good but weren't as tender a dough as I'd like and if you are hoping for a puffy, light cinnamon roll - this isn't it.

These were pretty good. The only change I made was to top them with powdered-sugar "frosting". They were actually more moist the second day, after I topped them with a little butter and heated them in the microwave. This was my first time making cinnamon rolls, and it was a pretty easy recipe. Nice not to have to make them a day ahead, too. Thanks!

This is a terrific recipe.  I was looking for a perfect cinnamon roll recipe and this was it.  I made this for my family this morning.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine in the dough and salted butter in the filling instead of margarine.  I didn't add extra flour and just kneaded the good and sticky dough between both hands.  More flour would have made this dough tough and dry.  I baked these in a deep baking dish, as I would any prepackaged frozen roll.  Didn't have any problems with the filling oozing outside of the dish.  I did top with a thin icing of cream cheese, milk, vanilla and powdered sugar.  I will make this one again and again.  YUM

Wonderful and extremely easy!! Yeast and I don't usually get along, but anyone can do this one! Everyone loves these--they go fast! I use a cream cheese frosting recipe thinned with milk so it's more like a glaze. Love them!!!

My cousin and I made four batches of this recipe one day.  We baked them till they were just starting to turn brown then took them out and froze them to eat on Christmas morning.  We let them thaw out while we opened presents and then baked them about ten min. to heat them and let them turn brown.  Took them out and topped with cream cheese frosting....DELISH!!!  I have been asked to make them again and again since Christmas!  Wonderfull!!

I made these for my parents yesterday.  They were quite quick and easy.  I was worried that they wouldn't rise enough, making them packy.  But, when they came out of the oven, they were light and fluffy.  I added a frosting to the rolls. Great recipe!

My husband is a cinnamon bun fiend. He cannot pass a Cinnabon without buying one. I tried this recipe and he loved it. I don't usually bake much, cooking is more my style, but I have made these several times and each time they taste even better! I always used chopped pecans instead of raisins. Also added lots of icing (cream cheese, confectioners sugar, almond extract & butter)NO More Buying Cinnabon. This is definately a keeper! My husband applauds you!! Four STARS

Wow!

A great yeast bread recipe that doesn't turn my hair gray!  With this recipe you can wake up at 8AM and have hot fresh cinnamon rolls for your wife before she gets up at 10! (Guys... *this* is the way to a girl's heart!).

Of course you will want to top it with an orange glaze to make it really tasty!

These were awesome.  My husband doesn't like my old recipe, as he thinks they are too bready.  These were perfect and won his approval!
I used bread flour in place of regular flour and used 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans instead of raisins.  I don't know if they took 90 minutes or
not, I'm usually not to concerned with how long a recipe takes because I love to cook and bake.  I baked them in my Deep Dish Stoneware Baker
and they turned out wonderful and nicely browned.  I may use less filling next time, they were almost too sweet.

I loved it! It was my first time to make fresh home made Cinnamon buns and it was easy! It tasted great! I placed them in a round baking pan next to each other and they were a lot softer.  SOme I placed in the baking cups..well they didn't do so great. But over all it was a great recipe!

Loved it but I think I used too much butter in the filling sunce the sugar pooled at the bottom and made a crunchy caramel kind of bottom. Still good though and will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I would recommend: if you prefer fuller, puffier cinnamon rolls, let the dough proof longer until it has doubled in size, about twice the amount of time said in the recipe. This is what I did, and the cinnamon rolls came out fabulous, like gourmet quality. When I was coating the inside of the dough with the cinnamon mix, I actually had really soft butter (I softened in the microwave) which made the mix very wet. This actually worked in my favor. Yes, the dough had become very messy when rolling and cutting, but it added so much flavor to the finished product. I didn't put these in muffin tins either; I hand-rolled each one due to the messy cinnamon mix and put them on parchment lined baking sheets, spread far enough apart so they wouldn't stick together. For glaze, I just had 1 part milk to 3-4 parts powdered sugar for a thick glaze. I didn't measure, just had a larger amount of powdered sugar to milk. I drizzled it on top of the cooled cinnamon rolls and it made a huge difference in the appearance. I had a lot of people tell me these cinnamon rolls were so amazing, they never made it home!

These were quick and easy, but they must be consumed the day they are made to be great.  By Day 2 they had dried out, inordinately, and felt heavy, even after zapping in microwave.  Day 3 was not worth bothering.  Strangest thing to dry out so quickly.  They were well-sealed in storage with a lid on the container.  Sad.

Followed the recipe except used butter for the middle layer instead of margarine. Baked the rolls in a 9X13 pan and added cream cheese frosting. Delicious.

Give this a try.  It is the easiest recipe for cinnamon rolls I have ever tried.  Best part is it can be  assembled the night before and brought to room temp and baked the next morning with no ill effects!  It can be modified to ones liking.  I bake in a 9x13 inch pan rather than muffin pan and add nuts and/or raisins as I like.  So forgiving and always successful.

Turned out great took less time than the ones I typically make in my bread machine and tasted just the same.  I made this recipe as is, but next tine would roll out more dough wider and put chopped pecans in the cinnamon mix.  Also I would use brown sugar mixed with regular sugar.  But that’s if I’m being super nit picky this recipe was excellent as is!

Y’all... I do NOT know where I went wrong.  My rolls didn’t rise, and the filling was such a gloopy mess that it all squished out of the dough as I rolled them.  With all of these amazing reviews, it must have been something I did, but even with my mistakes, I still slathered some frosting on my little cinnamon pucks and they were actually still tasty!  I still can’t stop laughing at how badly this went for me. Ha!

I love  this recipe. It is my go-to for cinnamon rolls. They always turn out nice and fluffy. This week I taught my daughter to make them and they turned out perfectly delicious. I always bake them in a 9x13 pan and usually put a glaze or cream cheese frosting on top, depending on what I’m in the mood for. Also, sometimes I’ll add dried cranberries or raisins to the filling. Thanks  for a great recipe!

I wish I would have read the reviews about the sugar and butter bubbling over. What a nightmare.  The recipe worked well up to then. This recipe needs to be updated to prevent people from making this mistake.  My lungs hurt from breathing in all the smoke. It smells like I had a house fire.

These were very good! I will definitely make these again! I mixed up a glaze for them. My glaze recipe is:
     1 and 1/2 Cups of powered sugar
    3/4  teaspoon vanilla
     2 or 3 Tablespoon milk

Thank you for this recipe. This was my first time making cinnamon rolls. Actually this was my first time ever making dough of any kind. I made them Christmas eve night and popped them in the oven Christmas morning. I followed the recipe to the t and they turned out absolutely wonderful. My family gobbled them up as soon as they were ready. Ive already been asked when am I going to make them again.

Absolutely delicious! My kids helped me make these and I couldn't be happier. the bread part is soft and fluffy and the flavor is perfect. We made cream cheese frosting for the top. I did have to bake a bit longer using the 9×13 pan.

This was my first adventure in Cinnamon Roll making, and this recipe made things easy! I was a little confused by the recipe listing 3 1/2 cups of flour in the ingredients and only 2 1/2 in the recipe - but I ended up adding about another 1/2 cup of flour to make the dough less sticky while kneading.

Five stars as far as taste goes but holy moly... how about a warning that these were going to explode all over my brand new oven?  Put the muffin tin on a baking sheet so you don't end up scrubbing the bottom of your oven like I had to!!

Fantastic as written. I then made a few changes, based on ideas here: mixed in stand mixer with dough hook attachment (added a bit more flour); proofed dough in the Instant Pot; added raisins before rolling up; poured a molten butter-brown sugar-cinnamon mixture over top. Also delicious!

Great recipe, the directions can be a bit confusing but luckily I followed it in the correct order. Just read it top to bottom and add ingredients as they’re listed. I had a little issue with the ends of my cinnamon rolls being just plain dough with little filling. No biggie I just discarded those pieces. I did have to increase my baking time by about 10/15 minutes but that’s probably normal depending on your oven. Overall these were excellent and I will make them again.

I am kind of a hit or miss Baker, but these were so easy even I could not mess them up. My only wish would be that they were a little softer the next day. I made a glaze of 1 tablespoon butter a touch of vanilla, 1 tablespoon milk and 1 cup powdered sugar

I follow this recipe nearly to a T. (I use butter instead of margarine).  These have the taste and texture of what I want in a cinnamon roll.  Perfect sweetness.  Great tender texture.   Super easy and very quick too.  I have even stopped at step 4 and put them in the fridge overnight so that I could have fresh cinnamon rolls with coffee in the morning.  I just take them out of the fridge and allow an hour to rise.  They are always done exactly at 30 minutes in the oven.  I love how reliable this recipe is.  It’s my go-to cinnamon roll recipe.  These work well with cream cheese frosting too.  Sometimes I put cream cheese frosting on half and the traditional butter, milk, powdered sugar frosting on the other half.

Made these and the boys loved them. I used a casserole dish to cook them in. The rolls did spill over a bit and had to clean the oven.

As an experienced cook and baker, I tend to dismiss recipes that claim to be fast or take short cuts. I decided to try these on a whim and I was proved wrong. These are simple and delicious and wonderful for a quick treat. My only suggestion would be to make them in a pan. I put mine in a cake pan and that kept them moist. My fear is that the muffin tons would dry them out and over cook them, but I could be wrong. I hate raisins so I sprinkled chopped pecans in mine and used whole pecans to decorate the top.

Turned out very soft on the inside! I used active dry yeast so I made it a little different. First, in a Pyrex measuring cup I mixed the milk, egg, water, sugar and butter. I melted the butter in the microwave and made sure that the temperature was around 100-110F. I transferred it to a mixing bowl and it lost heat so I had to reheat some of the mixture and mixed that back in. Next time I will heat the mixture to 120F so when I transfer it, it’ll be perfect for the yeast. I sprinkled the yeast on top of the mixture, mixed it, and let it proof in the oven with the lamp on for about 10 minutes. I sifted in the flour and salt and had my Kitchenaid with the dough hook knead the dough until smooth. After, I took it out and put the dough in the oven with the lamp on, towel over the bowl, and let it rise for around 45min-1hr or until double the size. You can make the filling while it rises. I sprinkled flour on the surface before rolling out the dough (don’t roll it out too thin). After, I spread on the filling to the very ends of the dough. I rolled it tightly. This step is very important for your dough to keep its swirl. Use string to cut the dough. Placed them in my buttered glass containers, then they rose for 45 minutes in the oven with a towel over and the lamp on again. The oven preheated to 350 while it rose and I put it in for about 30 minutes. Next time I will lower the heat as the middle cooked slower and so there will be less crunch on the outside.

I have made these *numerous* times.  We love them.  I have given them as gifts many times.  I have always been given rave reviews when I take them anywhere.  One friend I gave them to always gives me back the pan and asks for it to be refilled! I make the cream cheese frosting that one reviewer mentioned (first review on "most helpful").  I have never had a problem, they have always been beautiful.  I put the yeast in with the dry ingredients, I do not proof it.  The only thing I do differently is I use butter, not margarine. These are amazing and I'm addicted to making them! They have made me famous among my peers LOL! I would also add that buying quality ingredients is helpful.  Don't skimp on the brand of butter or yeast.  When I make the cream cheese frosting, I use Kelly Gold Irish Butter.  Sure, those ingredients are more expensive, but they are worth it for a better outcome!

Easy and fast, as promised. Of course, when I started I suddenly realized I didn’t have milk and that my yeast wasn’t instant! No problem, as it turned out. Activated the yeast in water and some of the sugar, and used plain Greek yogurt heated 30 seconds in the microwave instead of the milk. Delicious!

Most delicious and easiest cinnamon rolls I've ever made!! My toddler asked for cinnamon rolls out of no where this morning so I was trying to find a recipe that didn't require a bunch of prep or a trip to the store and I'll honestly never use a different recipe now. I DID add 1t of vanilla to the filing, and I kept adding cinnamon until I could actually taste it. I opted for a baking dish instead of muffin tin and I have no regrets there. After greasing the dish I smeared a layer of the filling in the bottom like you do with lasagna, and after placing the cut rolls in it I put more filling on top of them before covering it to let them rise. I baked them in the oven uncovered for 20 minutes and they came out PERFECT!! I just topped them with a basic powdered sugar & milk glaze and served them warm. They are now a family breakfast staple in my house

I didn’t time this. Probably took me 2 hours. I would suggest either a 5-10 degree less bake or 18 min bake. The caramel in the bottom baked in too much. Good bake.

These were delicious and easy to make. Next time I will bake them in a baking pan as some of the gooey filling spilled out of the muffin tins. My husband loved them. I used the perfect cinnamon roll icing recipe for them.

Tried to make these and they are definitely some I'll make again. Rave reviews from my kiddos and husband. I added a mixture of a cup of brown sugar, a tablespoon of cinnamon and a stick and a half of butter to the top of the rolls before baking. When I make it again I'll lessen the topping butter to just a stick (8 tablespoons). They're soft and gooey and very filling. Great for a brunch or lazy breakfast morning.

Recipe is way to sweet if you are planning to top the cinnamon rolls with frosting or glaze. I recommend cutting the sugar for the filling down by half.

These are SO good! My husband polished off 4 in a row while I wasn’t looking! I followed the recipe exactly and used my Kitchen Aid to do the hard work for me. I didn’t bake them in muffin tins though (because I hate cleaning them). I used a greased 9x13 pan and they filled it beautifully. I drizzled a simple icing sugar mixture over top once they cooled a bit. These were super easy and fast. This will be my go-to cinnamon bun recipe!

These delicious cinnamon rolls have become a regular weekend breakfast treat at our house.  In terms of ingredients I follow the recipe exactly, though in terms of technique I follow a few suggestions from other reviews that I think are worthwhile: 1) I do about 30 minutes in a warm place for both rises, not just the second one.  This leads to softer, fluffier rolls.  If I’m pressed for time, I use the microwave rise method, which cuts the time of both rises about in half.  2) Instead of mixing all the filling ingredients together, I melt the butter and brush it over the dough, then sprinkle the brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins.  I find this results in a more even spread of the filling.  3) I use dental floss to cut the rolls.  4) I cut them into about 15 rolls, and bake them together in a greased 9x12 pan.  For my oven, the baking time is still about 20 minutes as suggested in the recipe.  5) I let them cool then frost the whole lot with cream cheese frosting.  You don’t technically have to let them cool before doing this if you want them really warm and gooey, but it makes for a much nicer presentation (great for potlucks!), and I actually prefer eating them cooled.

Easiest homemade cinnamon roll recipe out there. Dough is easy yo work with and when cooked,  delicious! Ratio of dough to filling is just right. I cook these in a pan and use a string to slice for nice, round rolls. 
Look no further for your cinnamon roll recipe. It's right here!

I substituted  1/2 cup oat flour in the flour measurements and used pecans in the roll mixture!  Yum.
I would use 1/4 cup less brown sugar in the roll mixture next time as it was a bit sugary for me.
Baked in a glass pan at 375 degrees F for 18 minutes in a convection oven.

Excellent recipe. Moist, good flavor. Followed recipe, baked in square pan instead of muffin pans. They had to bake slightly longer. I like cinnamon rolls with a lot of fillings and these are perfect. I will make again.

I added a little more sugar and 2 packs of yeast to the dough, simply because I like a sweeter dough, and I love the flavor of the yeast. They came out wonderfully. The best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made, and I’ve been making them for 40 years.

Absolutely delightful. I took another lady's  suggestion and made a cream cheese icing.  Holy cow. They didn't last long.
 I didn't use muffin tins,  just put them all in the cast iron skillet and let them rise by the fire.  They cooked perfectly in it and the mixture didn't bubble out.

These were really good when I made them. I did make the following adjustments:

- Instead of mixing the yeast with the dry ingredients, as suggested in the recipe, I mixed it with the water and half the sugar, leaving the rest of the sugar with the dry ingredients

- I kneaded the dough until you could stretch it to the point where you could see light through it

- I proved it for an hour after kneading, and 45 minutes once I shaped them, before baking

I hope my suggestions are useful!

I absolutely love this recipe! Pretty easy and no bread maker needed. The only change I made was butter instead of margarine and cooked them in a 13x9 pan. They came out great and I topped it with a cream cheese icing!

Delicious and much quicker than other cinnamon rolls. Took advice from others and baked in a 9 x 13 metal pan and topped with cream cheese icing when they came out of the oven. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe!! Only change I made was to cut them into smaller portions before baking. Fabulous dough to work with, lots of give and stretch. Flavors exceeded our expectations and they weren’t sickeningly sweet!!!

Tasty and easy to prepare. Just make sure you have the time to let the dough rise completely. I chose not to use the muffin pans, but rather put them into a medium sized round baking dish. Liked the fullness this option gave me and reminded me of what my mother used to make.

Followed recipe to a tee other than I allowed my stand mixer to do the kneading for me. Next time I make these I will change up the cinnamon sugar butter portion. I’ll use my mom’s method of melting butter and spreading on the dough then sprinkling the sugar cinnamon mixture on top of that. Chalk that up to sentiment, nothing more. I baked in a 9X13 pan. Delicious!

Amazing and easy! Used a 13x9 instead of muffin tins,I overbaked a little bit so the sugar caramelized too much. I ended up doing 35 minutes...28-30 would have been sufficient. I used active dry yeast instead of instant, so I didn’t put the butter in the yeast for proofing, added it after. Added a cream cheese powdered sugar icing after about 15 minutes out of oven. So good and so easy to follow!

Turned out Yummy!!  First I have to admit when it comes to baking and using yeast, for some reason it usually doesn’t turn out for me. But with this recipe I made 4 different batches for my oldest granddaughters end of senior year breakfast at sunrise. 2 out of the 4 seemed to rise properly and the other 2 only a little.  I went ahead and baked anyway and even though they were smaller, the flavor was the same.  The kids loved them.  Will continue to make them and learn how to get dough to rise properly.  But it’s good to know that if they don’t rise all the way, they are still very good and will not have a problem getting eaten.

Very good. The only change I made was adding a splash of vanilla to the milk and I also backed in a 9x13 pan so they’d get nice and gooey. No one likes a dry cinnamon roll.

Before I make any recipes from ALLRECIPES I read the reviews and break them down to fit my needs. The reviews for these cinnamon rolls had many concerns about sticking to the pan & overflow in the oven. To prevent the problem I did the following:  I used a 9x13 “high edge” cake baking pan. I sprayed it with cooking spray then put parchment paper in the bottom. Then sprayed the parchment paper. ....I did Not have any problems with overflow or Cinnamon Rolls sticking. I even cooled them in the pan. And clean up was very easy.                                                       Added note: This is an excellent recipe!                                                      I did make them the night before then set them out in the morning about an hour before putting them in the oven. As suggested from one person to add 2T of flour to the filling, I wanted to do that but forgot. So while sitting out before cooking some filling leaked out looking a bit runny. This was not a problem but the flour could have helped.

They turned out perfect. Instead of a muffin pan I baked them in a 9x13 pyrex pan. They were incredibly moist and delicious. I added a very simple buttercream frosting (those were the ingredients I had on hand). I have a large family and doubled the batch with no problems. I will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious without modifications to the actual recipe. I used a basic cream cheese frosting for top. To avoid spillage, I put on parchment paper on a cookie sheet. No mess and easy cleanup.

Great recipe, got amazing cinnamon rolls. However I also got a small fire in my oven because I didn't put a cookie sheet under the muffin tin. The syrup fell and got on fire. We got rid of the fire quickly but please put a under your muffin tin to catch the syrup and check the oven  from time to time. Someone else suggested this as well.

My dough became too gooey by the way, so what  I did was spread the dough in a rectangle, spread the cinnamon butter and then refrigerate for some time. Then I was able to roll it up way better.

Made my very first cinnamon rolls with this recipe and oh boy, they turned out very well.  I baked them in a 9x9 pan for around 32 minutes and mixed in some flour in the filling to prevent it from being too runny. Would add pecans or walnuts next time for some crunch. All in all, great recipe.

You MUST bake this in a 13x9 pan. Do not bake them in a muffin tin.  In the muffin tin the filling bakes and spills over. It causes a mess in your oven.  I wish I read the old reviews first... Besides that the recipe was super easy to follow and I will do them again.

Absolutely delicious and easy. Made the cream cheese frosting another review suggested and it was the perfect compliment.  My daughter made these with supervision and they are that simple to make. We all loved them!

I have not one complaint on this recipe.  Super easy and delicious!!!! I do not do any substitutions, and maybe I roll mine a bit tighter, but I generally get 13-15 rolls, and I wouldn’t put them in a muffin pan, always a pan with sides.

I make this all the time, especially when I want to impress ;) it NEVER disappoints. Also, the more often you make them, the easier it gets. Strongly recommend this one.

I added a 1/4 tsp of clove and a dash of almond extract to the filling. I also added a bit of vanilla to the dough. Turned out wonderful and fluffy. I think there was too much sugar mixture for the rolls, but next time I will keep the butter cooler and not melt it. Lastly, I think these would be too sweet with cream cheese frosting, but that’s a person taste issue.

They were awesome right out of oven. I used a new spice, maple cinnamon  gave it great taste.  The next day they were a little dry, but out in micro and heat a couple of seconds they were great  again. I will try this again.

Quadrupled, made 4 enormous cinnamon rolls. I was sad that I didn't separate the batches for the first rise. But it baked for 40 minutes and every one (8 kids 2 adults) loved them. No icing.

Finally found a cinnamon roll recipe we love!  Made with half -n- half instead of milk and used 2 1/2 tsp of Saf Instant Yeast. Cooked in glass baking dish instead of muffin pan.  Made homemade cream cheese frosting to top.  Fantastic!

Next time I make it I think I’ll just use a regular Pyrex 9x12 pan instead of the muffins or making more muffins.  The muffins ended up overflowing a tad bit. But these were very easy to make and very yummy!! Especially with the frosting that is on Allrecipes!

This was a great recipe! Super easy to make and much faster than traditional cinnamon roll recipes. I didn't change anything except used a 9x13 pan instead of muffin tins.

I made and used frosting in these because that’s how I roll. That disclosure out of the way, these were tasty easy and QUICK to make.  Will make again when time is short and we are in the mood for cinnamon rolls. I made them exactly as directed but immediately after taking them out of the oven, I tipped them over onto a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper so they wouldn’t stick in the pan.

Omg!  Easy and fabulous!  It took longer than 90 minutes because I made a second batch of  rolls to freeze on a sprayed cookie sheet to take out, thaw, and raise at a later date.  I spread the butter first on the rolled out dough and then evenly spread the sugar/cinnamon on the butter.  After rolling it up , I used floss to cut them and they turned out so pretty!  After baking, I made a simple powder sugar, milk and butter glaze.

SO GOOD!! They are quite a bit of work and involve some patience but they turned out amazing.  We baked them traditionally in a pan rather than a muffin tin and I probably won’t bother with the muffin tin way. I made the frosting as others suggested and it also was delicious. Totally will make these again!

The best recipe ever. Every time I make it, everyone enjoys it. We personally didn’t like the raisins and I tried substituting with nuts but we like it just with  the cinnamon and nothing else. Wouldn’t change a thing.

These are so good and easy to make!  I did put them in a 9x13 baking dish and baked them 33-35 minutes.  I made a cream cheese icing that was just right to top the rolls.  
I will definitely be making these again!

The only change that I made to the recipe was to bake in a 13x9 pan.  Excellent recipe that I have made many times.  My family loves them.  To be honest, it takes from start to finish, about 2 hours and 15 minutes.   Worth every minute.

This was my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls and I'm so very glad I decided on this recipe! Thank you very much! I did half without icing because they were absolutely perfect as is the other half I did a simple white icing. I'll definitely be making these time and time again.

Doubled the recipe to make for a large gathering, and these turned out so delicious!

I had to work the dough a lot to be able to roll it out long enough... but that might have been because I doubled it. 

Made my own icing from cream cheese, powdered sugar, and water as I saw in another comment. I'll definitely be making these more!

Great recipe! Easy to follow. I did not have Instant Yeast, so I used Active Dry yeast, and they did just fine. The dough did not rise much, and I was worried they would stay flat because of the yeast, but in the oven they poofed out nicely! I did as other reviewers and baked in a 9x9 baking dish rather than muffin tins (easier to clean!)   So delicious!  Easy to throw together a glaze for the top -- milk and powdered sugar, or a cream cheese frosting, depending on what's around.

I think the rolls came out bland and yeasty. My son doesn't like raisins which I think would have made a difference. However, they're attractive and light. I added sliced almonds. Next time I will try adding walnut oil as a substitute for part of the butter. I will add a lot more cinnamon and almonds as well plus some type of dried fruit.

I made these today having never made cinnamon rolls before and they were a hit! I used two round pans instead of the muffin tins and topped with homemade buttercream  icing while they were still hot! They were so yummy!

These are amazing!! I’ve made them a few times now and every time they are devoured! My family said they are to die for. The changes I made were to make it dairy free, because of lactose intolerance. Everything else I followed exactly and they turned out great!

I did as others and made this in a springform pan rather than a muffin pan. Baked for 25-30 minutes (larger springform = more time). Made "The perfect cinnamon roll icing" to go with it. Takes like a cinnabon.

First time I made it, it came out perfect.  The second time,  there was a dough issue--I bought marked down fast-acting yeast and got what I paid for because the dough didn't rise right and I had to throw it out.   Trying again tonight with new yeast and so far everything is looking great.  I use a baking dish, not a muffin tin.

Super easy compared to a sticky bun recipe I made from this site a few weeks ago. Sticky buns and cinnamon rolls are similar except sticky buns have brown sugar butter mixture at bottom of the pan and can be more ooey gooey. I was looking for a recipe that didn’t take 3 hours to make. These weren’t too time consuming if you start early enough for your family to enjoy for breakfast before lunch if you had to wait. I made 6 big cinnamon rolls in a circular metal pan. Needed to bake about 25 mins. I made cinnamon roll icing without cream cheese and couldn’t find any from allrecipes so I used a recipe the the spruce.com, these were delicious, not nutritious as I say about baked goods that taste amazing but aren’t the best for the waste line

Excellent recipe! I wanted a recipe that did not require bread machine or hours of time. I didn't make in muffin tins for preference - used a greased 9x13 glass pan. This is a keeper! Delicious  topped with a cream cheese frosting.

I didn’t like this recipe. The yeast should put into the lukewarm water. Therefore my dough did not rise and was not fluffy. There are other better recipes like Betty cocker one.

This was a great recipe! I'd never made cinnamon rolls before and they came out great! However the dough was much too sticky and I could not handle it  without adding a lot more flour than the recipe called for, also I halved the ingredients (so I should've gotten 6 rolls) and I got 15 small rolls, which were very nice in size. I will be making it again!

I made a small change- since it’s fall..... I made ‘caramel apple’ cinnamon rolls. I peeled & chopped (very small) up 3 md/lg apples and added them to the cinnamon, sugar, & butter mix. Then I also added a cup of butter scotch morsels. You might want some vanilla ice cream to go with it.

This recipe is perfect. I have made it twice and it turned out really well both times - I do however put mine in a 9x13  pan because i don't like the edges to be hard like they would be in a muffin pan. I used 4 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup butter mixed with powdered sugar until it tasted right for me to make the icing. It is my new go to!!

Amazing!
I do need to mention the second time I made them I increased the brown sugar to 1.5 cups and the cinnamon to 1.5 TBSP. I also used a 13X9 pan and baked for 30 minutes. Once I pulled them out of the oven I flipped the baking pan over onto a cookie sheet and let them sit in the goo for about 15 minutes, iced them, and served them. My 9 year old went back for seconds.

Easy and yummy! Followed dough recipe exactly, filling added more butter, 3/4 cup chopped toasted pecans, vanilla soaked raisins, and teaspoon of cardamom. Did not use muffin tins, baked in 9X13 glass baking dish. Please note, still needed cookie sheet underneath to catch butter drips

Used a baking tray and baked for 25min. The texture was not too dry, in fact, the outsides were crisp and the insides were soft. My friend and I were amazed and how good it tasted. We made icing to go with and used the recipe given by PAULA (1 ½ cup of powdered sugar, ¼ cup cream cheese, ½ cup margarine, ½ tsp vanilla, ? tsp salt). The icing is really worth making and it takes the cinnamon rolls to a new level!

Awesome, my son and I made it this morning.  We substituted half the flour with whole whet flour and the margarine for real butter.  They were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had.  I topped them with just some powdered sugar water and vanilla icing.  Perfection!!!!@

Really great and easy to make!!! I've made them twice. The first time they were a little dry, so note to self, they are done before you think they are done. The second time I added cinnamon into the dough as well as the filling for a little more punch. Also drizzled some butter in top to help with the browning and drying out. Yummy.

Pretty impressed! However, my husband and I probably would have been better off with melting the butter for the cinnamon mixture instead of it just being softened. The cinnamon mixture oozed out of the rolls while baking. Regardless, the taste was great and the dough was perfect & it baked nicely.

I love this recipie, I have tried many cinnamon rolls and this is the best!! It's not sickly sweet and it's not tough. The cinnamon rolls stay soft for a long time, the only things I would say is to proof the dough in the oven and to make a glaze  ( powderd sugar, milk, and vanilla extract)!!!!

I added some baking powder which made them fluffier. Also, I dipped the finished buns in the vanilla pudding so they became moist.

4 16 17 ... Happy Easter! ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17006/ninety-minute-cinnamon-rolls/ ... 'Not first time using yeast, but it's been quite a while; first time yeast cinnamon rolls.  This is a good recipe, but it didn't knock my socks off.  I had to add more flour, more than expected & still not enough so I had a stickiness problem.  The cinnamon filling was either too soft or too much; maybe both.  It was messy.  I put blinders on & just kept going.  I attempted to cut in two then each half three times for twelve.  The filling slopped the dough so much, I just cut three of each half - so six very large rolls.  I literally scooped them up with help from a spatula & placed on a jellyroll pan & baked about 20 minutes.  They filled the pan & taste good, but not so pretty.  'Made 'em to eat, not look at anyway so "we good"!  Sum up:  The dough is soft & good.  I may find another dough recipe I like better, but this one's good; the filling, I'll keep looking; but it is good, too.  Thanks for sharing with us!

The recipe was easy to follow.  But the buns were not as gooey as I expected. What can be added to make the buns gooey.

The batch made in muffin pan was a lot drier than the one I made in a baking dish.  Why is that?  Apparently I saw a few comments with this remark.

Dough turned out really sticky and was difficult to roll out. Theses cinammin rolls are amazing fresh, but soon after become more of a biscuity texture. If you just want a really quick recipe this works, but I'd rather just spend more time and have them turn out soft and easy to work with.

This is the best recipe I have come across.  They are so easy to make and the whole family gobbled them up in ten minutes.  The only problem I had was the time it took to let them double in size,  I let them sit a couple hours before they were ready to bake.  Other than that they are fantastic!  I'll be making them again soon!

These  were amazing.  I did add a handful of cinnamon chips to the filling and they came out great.  I put them in a greased 9 x 13 pan and baked 25 minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Made this tonight. It came out great. My husband even gave me two thumbs up then licked his fingers. Lol I followed the recipe to the letter and altered it on the cut and roll amount. We wanted larger ones so I did eight instead of twelve. Lowered the heat to 350 and baked for ten mins longer. Also made cream cheese topping to drizzle on while hot. I have to say it was AWESOME! Extra note, requires a large glass of cold milk. lol

Not too hard and my 12 year old was able to help quite a bit. These don't take too long, and yet they rise pretty well. Ours were quite tall and didn't fit well into a 12 cup muffin pan, so I would recommend slicing them a bit thinner and make more like 14 or so. The cinnamon mixture oozed out and dripped onto the bottom of the oven, so it would be helpful to place the muffin pan onto a baking tray first. Pretty tasty and a bit crispy. We added nuts as well.

This really is a simple and delicious recipe. I did not make them in muffin tins because that didn't really make sense to me, so I made them in a standard 9x13 baking dish. Additionally, the recipe calls for the use of softened margarine for the filling, but I found the consistency too soft making it hard to hold together while I was rolling it up and cutting. The second  time I made these I used slightly softened stick butter instead and it mde the roll and cut much easier. All in all the dough is rich and delicious and the recipe is easy

I never made any bread product before or used yeast, but after simply following the directions everything turned out delicious!  It was a little challenging cutting the cinnamon rolls AFTER rolling up the dough.  The second time I made them, I cut the dough into strips after applying the brown sugar.  Then rolling each roll up individually seemed easier to me and a little less messy.  And I did make the cream cheese icing found in another review.  Everyone said they were bakery quality and ate every bit!

Great recipe! Because I hate cleaning muffin tins, I baked them on a baking sheet and they turned out irresistibly perfect.  My whole family loved them!  I made the dough the night before and refrigerated them promptly after slicing.  In the morning, I pulled them out and let them rise for about 45 minutes before baking.  Will make again!

Delicious. Followed the recipe as written except for the following changes:
I used regular yeast that I let bloom in the 1/4 cup of warm water for 10 minutes. Milk was warmed in microwave. Added both raisins and walnuts. Took a little longer to rise. Baked in 9 X 13 pan using parchment paper (as suggested by other commenters) and turned out onto another piece of parchment when done. My second attempt at a yeast raised dough and both were successful. Possibly a little too sweet with the 1 cup of brown sugar - I used demerara so maybe that made a difference - but I will definitely make again.

These were very good and made my kitchen smell heavenly! I would also agree with the reviewer who cautioned to watch out for the filling bubbling over and spilling all over the oven, as that happened to me too. 

I honestly didn't love that these were made in a muffin tin--they came out with a weird shape. Not sure if that was user error on my part, but when I try these again, I'm going to put them in a jelly roll pan instead. 

Great flavor, though, and my family loved them.

omg.... LOVED these!  So easy to make!  I used butter instead of margering and did not mix the butter in - spread the butter on the dough and then sprinkled with the filling and walnuts.....  I barely had time to frost them (made them in a pan, not in the muffin sheet).  These are a keeper - excellent texture and flavor.

Love at 375ºF! Excellent recipe! 
The only unique touches I added are:
1/2 tsp nutmeg & pinch of cardamom in the dough.
I chose to bake in a 12"x9" pan - opting out of the muffin pan method, although that sounds interesting.
Since the recipe gives no frosting, I chose a cream cheese frosting. (4oz cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1 c powdered sugar)
Omitted the raisins and added pecans in their place. 

The dough was splendidly easy to make & directions a breeze to follow. Since these ones are almost gone already, I am certain to be making them again very soon!

Loved this recipe. It didn't take a long time to make even with having to let it rise. I did use  Bob Red Mills organic pastry flour and it gave them a light fluffy texture that I love. Additionally I grated an organic Fuji apple and added organic blueberries and put it on the rolls out dough on top of the butter/cinnamon mixture.  I used a glass casserole pan instead of the muffin tins.

I chose this recipe because it doesn't require a bread machine as most recipes seem to need.  I'm a novice when it comes to bread making and was afraid to try and convert the instructions. I made the rolls the night before and put them in a 9x13 pan. Brought them to room temp to rise a bit more before baking on Christmas morning. They rose beautifully, the rolls were light and fluffy. I gave it four stars because the filling was a bit dry. Next time I will increase the amount of butter to 3/4 cup and perhaps double the filling recipe so I can put some in the bottom of the pan. We wished they were a bit 'gooeyer', but still they were a success.

Followed suggestions by others. Made the rolls the night before and refridgerated them overnight. Allowed time to rise in the morning. Used a rectangular glass pan (but had lined the pan with parchment paper) so I lifted the buns out of the glass pan to rise in the AM and put them back to bake. No icing, they are sweet enough. Used butter instead of margarine. 

They were a hit!

I am generally not a baker and if I am, I love my bread machine.  This was my first attempt with a yeast dough by "hand".  And by that I mean, my Kitchen Aid got a workout ;-)  I mixed the yeast with the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl.  I used a 2 cp Pyrex to heat the milk in the microwave about 2 minutes.  To that I added cold butter and warm water.  I beat my egg separately then tempered with some of the milk mix, keeping an eye on the temp.  Right around 122* I added that to the flour/yeast mix and let it go.  I ended up needing about 1/2 cp extra flour to make it form (don't panic with this, it all depends on your house, the weather, the flour, etc)  I cut down my brown sugar to about 3/4 cp, mixed it with 1/4 cp melted butter and spread it on the dough about 1/2 inch from the edges.  I added 1/4 chopped pecans and rolled it.  I purposely cut it into 6 rounds, put it in a 9x13 glass Pyrex (greased with butter) and let it sit on top of my fridge (the warmest spot in my house when the oven is off) while I did other things.  The rolls did not rise UP, but out, which I fully expected.  Popped 'em in the oven for 20 minutes after brushing with a little melted butter and ta-da!  Yes, I realize by the time it was all said and done I probably used a full stick of butter, but it is SO worth it.  But I suppose if you're looking for 'diet' recipes, you're not making cinnamon rolls ;-)  I also glazed with some powdered sugar, vanilla and milk.  Cinnamon rolls are the only thing I

this recipe was perfect! I did a couple things differently and they were still amazing. I was out if milk so I used water and I only had traditional yeast not quick rise yeast. I combined my yeast, the white sugar and 3/4 cup of warm water and let sit until frothy to activate the yeast. I melted butter rather than matgarine and stirred it with the 1/4 cup of water beat an egg into it. Then combined all wet ingredients and poured over the flour. I used a stand mixer to knead the dough which was a huge time saver! I used the tip from other reviews to bake in a  pan rather than muffin tins and did not regret it! just make sure to us a 9x12 pan with a baking sheet under it! I mixed extra butter sugar and cinnamon to top the rolls with too :) I will definitely make these again.

This was my first try at making anything with yeast from scratch. It was so easy and they tasted so good!!!. I had extra filling so I spread it lightly on top after I had them in the 13x9 in pan. No icing needed they are fantastic.

I made this recipe with a cream cheese frosting and they're good! Next time, I will cut down on butter for the brown sugar filling- the butter melted and caked at the bottom almost burning them. Other than that they're hitting my pregnancy craving spot on!

Made it as directed. Like the "90 minutes" aspect. They are baking as I review, so I can't review the taste, but they seemed to rise as they were supposed to, so I'm happy about that.

This recipe is perfect. I didn't change any ingredients but put them in a 9x12 glass dish and added another mixture of the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon to the top. I baked them on the convection cycle at 350 for 22 minutes and they were sooo delish! Thanks for the recipe. This is my go to from now on. ??

Excellent rolls--i will definitely make these again. My family and I liked them a lot. I left out the stick of butter called for in between layers, just spreading the rectangle of dough with cinnamon sugar and raisins and pressing them in with a rolling pin before rolling up the dough. This resulted in much less messy rolls that still tasted plenty rich and buttery.
    I also left off the icing, and we didn't miss it.
    To boost nutrition a bit (we have a growing son who is vegetarian and a selective eater) I added 1/4-1/2c instant dry milk, 1/4c ground flax seed, and 1/4c whey protein powder. All were healthful, unobtrusive additions.

These were wonderful!!!! I have been craving Cinnabon for a while and I can't have it due to an allergy. This was a FANTASTIC substitute. So mouthwatering. My only thing is that the cinnamon butter oozed out pretty bad. I'll try it again but I Amy cut the butter back to a quarter cup in the brown sugar mix. Over all VERY SATISFIED!!!

I have to admit, I was very skeptical as the dough did not rise after kneading or rolling, but they did not disappoint when baking. Make them as 9 rolls in an 8 x 8 dish and and they plumped right up and the family loved them!

Awesome recipe.  I did not make it in muffin tins but rather a shallow glass pan.  Also, I chopped pecans and added it to the filling.  In all else I followed the recipe and the rolls were excellent.

I make these rolls regularly for my family. The only way I vary from the recipe is that I bake them in a 9x13 pan instead of muffin tins and I drizzle cream cheese frosting over them. They are delicious, quick and easy. Also, they freeze really well: instead of placing them in the pan to rise, place them on a cookie sheet and freeze. Pop them in a ziplock back and pull some out the night before baking to thaw and rise in the baking pan. Bake as directed. Delicious!

IT WAS AWESOME! My family really liked it and it was rich and flavorful. Using brown sugar in the filling was a great idea. I let it ferment/rise for a bit longer (around 40 minutes) and I think that helped contribute to the amazing fluffiness of the rolls. Also, seeing other people's comments I baked the rolls in a flat dish to account for their explosive growth. Definitely our new family recipe for comfort sweets!

These were unbelievable!! Best rolls ever!! So easy too! The only changes I made was use butter in place of  the margarine.  Just because in my opinion butter tastes better in any recipe every time. I also made cream cheese frosting for them...magnificent!!! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

Loved it , Tasted absolutely delicious . Just the dough was a little too soft or I made a mistake of rolling it out to thin because while cutting the dough ,it was kind of falling apart but I managed ,it was  really easy to make !! First time making cinnamon rolls and came out just perfect,well kind off . Got about 24 rolls  using this recipe and finish less than a day for a family of 5 LOL ! 

Definitely gonna make this again !!

The recipe itself was a bit confusing- it never said when to add the egg, for example. The dough was a bit dry, and it ultimately wasn't very cinnamony. I did tweak a couple of things; I used a few tablespoons of coconut oil in place of some of the butter, and I also spread some of the cinnamon mixture along the bottom of the pan, producing  a delicious crispy bottom.

Great and so much faster and easier than with a bread maker, if you can believe it! I added about 1/2 c. nuts to the filling and made up a big bowl of icing (powdered sugar, milk, lemon juice) and slathered the rolls with it when they came out of the oven. Oh, and I didn't use muffin cups but crammed 'em into a baking dish - it took about 3 minutes longer to bake this way, but I prefer the pull-apart kind!

Oh I love these cinnamon rolls! This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and wow! They were VERY easy and couldn't have been more delicious! I let them rest about 20 minutes instead of 10 because I got busy but that didn't affect the form or taste. I also used chopped pecans instead of the optional raisins (because I don't like raisins) and I frosted with some cream cheese frosting I had left over. Everyone loves them. I should have made 2 batches. Better than Cinnabon, better than any cinnamon roll I've ever had. Thank you for this recipe!!

I've made this many times now only difference I use 9x13 pan instead because I make a mix for carmel on bottom so it melts and cooks with the buns . After about 3 mins let rest I turn over and let the dripping run down and top with sea salt . These are always a big hit .
Just add I made it my own recipe with the standard use of this one . I let the dough set longer like 3 hours and 1 to 1.5 hours after rolled in the and set in the pans :-)

Great for when you want to make quick, REAL cinnamon rolls. However, does not get done in the middle. Try baking at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes, they turn out better and not so doughy in the middle. Also goes great with a good cream cheese icing.

Delicious! Easiest cinnamon rolls ever. Tried using the bread machine for the dough first and dough was too tough. Tried again by hand and the rolls were soft and delicious. This will be my go to cinnamon recipe from now on!

Super easy! And they taste great.
I halved the recipe and it made about 8. They fit nicely in a cake pan.
I also let them rise an extra 10 minutes (so 40 minutes total).

these where great! and super easy. I did some modifications bc of what I had on hand...used butter instead of margarine bc I didn't have margarine, I used a 13x9 casserole glass dish, and I used less of the cinnamon sugar mix in the roll but now i wished I had added more AND added more cinnamon. Overall these were great! I made a cream cheese icing to put on top.

This was delicious and easy.  As other reviewers suggested, I made them the night before.  Set them out for 30 minutes in the morning and then baked.  Perfection.  Thanks for the great recipe!  (I made them in a 13x9 pan, not in muffin tins)

Awesome recipe my kids love them. I take a bit of time to proof and adding chocolate chips instead of raisins. For the frosting I make a chocolate cream cheese icing. A+ in my opinion!

Skipped the muffin tin, and just used a large baking dish.
Adding pecans which everyone liked.
Cinnamon rolls didn't need icing.

I've made this recipe twice now, and not had any trouble with it.  I follow the directions and ingredients as written with the exception of using a 13x9 instead of a muffin tin.  It has worked both times.  I like that it's fairly quick, and doesn't take days of kneading.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a fairly easy recipe.  I have problems with my hands, and can't knead the dough, so I had to do that part in my stand up mixer.  Other than that, I followed directions up to the end.  When done I put a brown sugar glaze on one side, and a cream cheese frosting on the other.

Quick and easy recipe! The only changes I made was to substitute half of the brown sugar for white sugar and I made only half the recipe in a cake pan instead of a muffin tin. Came out great! I also added a simple icing of powdered sugar and water for a little extra sweetness.

Perfect, yummy, easy. A breeze w a Kitchenaid. This is my official recipe now. Updating my previous review: first time I made these I chilled overnight and baked them straight to the oven- there was very little "goo" that seeped out the bottom. Today, I did it overnight but let the rolls warm on the counter. This time, a lot of filling oozed out and created a sticky Carmely bottom & had to e flipped into a baking sheet. This wasn't a bad thing- my oldest son preferred the sticky but I did not. So, same concept as refrigerating cookie dough- the filling stays firmer with less spread if the dough is chilled. Delicious either way!

Delicious recipe even without anything added or changed! I am not very skilled at all, so this recipe took me much more than 90 minutes, but the end result was amazing! Just to experiment with icing, I looked over some recipes, but they all seemed to make way too much icing. I threw together a spoonful of cream cheese, a spoonful of powdered sugar (not sifted), a few small shavings of butter (not softened), and poured a little bit of vanilla. I added a little more powdered sugar later for taste and texture. Mixed together for about five minutes to really get those powdered sugar and butter chunks out. I ended up with the perfect amount (maybe a tablespoon or two of icing) and the texture was how I wanted, sticky but very consistent. Good luck!

Used regular yeast (2.5 tsp). Pour/spread melted butter on rectangle and then sprinkled sugar/cinnamon on top. Used thread to slice.  Placed in glass dish and let rise 30 min prior to putting in the oven.  Sprinkled with toasted slivered almonds. Drizzled with powdered sugar/milk/vanilla icing. Yum!!!

Easy Peasy!  I rolled the dough out to about to 9X12 the first time and it was awfully thick.  The second time I went to 12 X16 and the dough wasn't as thick.  I also cheated on the rise time (15 min)as I wanted to have the cinnamon buns ready for the  children before they went to school and it still worked out perfectly.

I thought this recipe was easy and didn't take a lot of time! Its so nice not having to wait for them to rise 2x, 1 hour each like most bread recipes. This dough is easy to make with a stand mixer. I used a 9x13 pan instead of a muffin pan and they came out nicely. Quite honestly, I'm not sure why you would use a muffin pan for these. I made these for easter and everyone really enjoyed them! Next time I will bake these for a little less than 20 minutes because mine came out a little too brown (the tops were hard and crispy). But that  is probably the fault of my oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Now I will make these more often now that I know it doesn't take a long time to make.

I believe these rolls would be best if baked in a slower oven, say 350 degrees;  the lower temps allows them more of a lofty rise.  My family (and neighbors) love these rolls!  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!

The muffin tin was a mistake. They oozed out and resembled muffins instead of cinnamon rolls. Left them in for 18 minutes and they were overdone. Put a cream cheese frosting on them and will microwave each one before eating to soften them up. Again, the muffin tin was a huge mistake!

There was too much flour and couldn't knead it all in.  For the filling the margarine was too soft and it oozed out the ends of the roll.  I did NOT like this recipe.

I really messed this one up! I'm sure next time it will be better. I know what i did wrong, first I didn't read all the way through like I usually do. Soo.. I put an extra cup of brown and cinnamon. It wasn't firm at all when I mixed it all together. So rolling was a lot of fun. Well some how I did get it kn the pan, but mistake number ?? I didn't let it rise the 30 minutes before baking. Lol. Well I figure what the heck I might as well bake it. It's still in oven turned off. It's early here I started it around 4-4:30 am. Well he will be up any minute and I tempted to not mention it. I doubt it will go unnoticed. Well it was fun but I am looking forward to doing it again, hopefully with a little more idea what I'm doing. Hope you all have a great weekend, and stay safe on east coast with all the snow. Lucky we are missed again. Take care and happy baking. Oh I put three stars but I have no idea how it will taste.??

This was alright...the bottom was a bit burnt, so next time I would watch them carefully when they pass the 15 minute baking mark. It was also a bit too sweet.

I actually melted the butter a tad bit and hand mixed the sugar mixture and added a little extra cinnamon. I also used a round nonstick pan to bake them in. 
One more thing, the way I rolled the dough, it made 20 even & perfect sized cinnamon rolls. And they are great without icing ! I will definitely make them again.


P.S, Active Dry Yeast works perfectly fine with this recipe

I have used  All Recipes for many years now.  This is the first review I've left.  I wouldn't classify myself as a cinnamon roll lover... But these  Cinnamon Rolls are amazing.   I found this recipe bc I needed a breakfast dessert for a brunch party.  They  are very easy to make.  I baked in  13x9 pan as recommend by other reviewers.   Instead of raisins I added  chopped pecans.  I also made cream cheese frosting but I prefer it without it.  However, it is  pretty fantastic with vanilla ice cream on top.  Heavenly!!  I can't wait to have it with my morning coffee. 
This will be a holiday go to recipe, or just because I love good pastries recipe.  :)

Delicious! The recipe itself is a very good cinnamon roll dough to be creative with, today I had 3/4c of heavy cream to use up so I used that instead of milk and omitted the egg, I also used white whole wheat flour, a spreadable butter instead of margarine, let the dough rise until double, rolled it out, spread a thin layer of Nutella, a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar, an extra sprinkle of just cinnamon, used floss to cut into rolls, put them in a buttered square baking dish, let them rise, baked 375 for 20 minutes( first time I made this I spread the dough with butter & cinnamon sugar & sliced almonds) both times the rolls turned out great

They did great, I see alot talking about how sticky it is,but seems they don't  know to add a little more flour. I live in a wet environment and i am always needing to add flour to it, also the brown sugar mix is great. I am making these from china and it is hard hard hard to find some ingridients,but i can find everything here, though the taste may be different with what they have.

Perfect recipe for a quick cinnamon roll.  Have made these many times and the are so yummy!  I finish them off with a powdered sugar glaze when they come out of the oven.  Will continue to make this recipe over and over!

Love this recipe!  I tweaked it a little by warming the milk in microwave, then adding butter to warm milk. I beat two eggs and used the warm milk to temper the eggs, then combined together with a teaspoon of vanilla for a richer dough. I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup  and  increased granulated yeast to 1 tablespoon.  I baked them at 375 for 20 min in a 9x13 quarter sheet pan and flipped it over onto another sheet pan covered with parchment then drizzled with powdered sugar glaze. Been making these at least once a month and holiday mornings for a year now and my family loves them. Warm,rich and gooey. TERRIFIC!

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I don't ever use the muffin cups, but they still come out perfect every time. I was once told that my cinnamon rolls are better that the ones sold at Pismo beach. This recipe is a winner.  Thank you.

First time to give a review on this site because I was so satisfied with the recipe. Followed the instructions as it is. Made two batches. One batch went to a square baking pan. The other went to the muffin cups. Put them together in the oven. They both came out beautifully and deliciously. Will make many more of this. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Though these were great right out of the oven, as they began to cool they got tough and they weren't really storable. If eaten while fresh and hot they are great. Topped mine with cream cheese icing and chopped walnuts.

"These are like the best things ever." Quote from 11 year old. I am so making these about 400 more times. These things are incredible. I rolled them out and out 13 in a 9x13 glass dish that was sprayed with oil first. Baked at 350 for about 35 minutes. Heaven. Heaven.

I made these for a christmas breakfast for family and guests and they were a huge success. I put them in a 9x13 pan instead of a muffin tin due to other reviews and baked them a little longer.  My husband said they were better than Cinnabon. Will definitely be making these again!

Excellent recipe. I followed everything as followed, but substituted equal parts butter for margarine (as I do not use it). I baked them in a 9x 13" pyrex, yielding about 12 rolls. Once baked I just flip the rolls onto a baking sheet. I finished it with a vanilla cream cheese frosting. Do not let the relatively short "90" minutes be a turn off, these are as the best I have made and possibly the best I have ever had. Try them for yourself and see, you will not be disappointed.

Followed this almost exactly and they were perfect! As many suggested, I cooked them for about 22min in a 9x13 glass dish. I also made them the night before, refrigerated them overnight, and let them rise for 30 min while the stove preheated in the morning. I also made the cream cheese icing shared in another review. Perfection, and very easy!!

These came out great. I accidentally put in 1/4c of butter into the milk mixture-instead of the 1/2c- i don't think it made a big difference. Definitely going to make these again!

My family is OBSESSED! I have to make them AT LEAST once a year and I'm about to whip up some for Christmas morning. I like baking, but I'm not a huge fan of baked goods. However, these cinnamon rolls are delicious. This is one of the few recipes that does not require a bread machine. And I love how my house smells while working on them.

Yummy but take longer than 90min and took so long to rise I had to turn oven on lowest setting for a minute, turn oven off, put in rolls, and put in small pan of water to keep moisture. I left them in there for about 20 min. They rose quickly that way. I also cut butter for brown sugar mixture in half and it came out fine. Overall yummy!!!!!

Great recipe. I don't advocate using a muffin tin, though, because I think the rolls get a little dried out. I like the rolls to touch each other so the sides stay soft.
I use my Kitchenaid mixer/dough hook to knead the dough, and that made the process very, very easy.

Baked in 9 x 12 pan for 20 minutes. Perfect. Made cream cheese, milk, vanilla, powdered sugar glaze and drizzled over hot rolls.

This was a success. A bit too much filling since it does overflow. I really never thought of the muffin pan to cook the rolls and it was amazing! It makes the cinnamon rolls like a cupcake and it's really cute. I used one of the icing recipes in the reviews and my friends loved it.

What a huge success! I didn't have muffin tins, so I simply lined them up in bread tins and they came out very well. My husband called it a home run. I made a quick glaze with butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and water. But these certainly didn't need the glaze - I just know my husband. I felt like quite the Suzie Homemaker. Will make this again for sure.

I baked it at 375 for approximately 15 min when I noticed smoke.  They were dark brown on top and black on the bottom.  My husband and I diligently peeled the outside layers off and ate the tops of the roll centers.We could tell the rolls  would have been great if they hadn't burnt.  I say lower the oven temp or cook for no more than ten min.

I made this in less than the 90 minutes posted by using quick-rise yeast, rising them in a 100 degree oven, and baking them in the convection oven.  I also iced them with a confectioners sugar/butter/vanilla/milk glaze.  YUMMY!
(I followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting a cookie sheet underneath while baking and glazing to save on mess)

I like these because they are quick and easy, but they are kinda "grainy" ( cinnamon mixture)  I use real butter so i don't know what could be the cause..maybe dark brown sugar that I used ( all I had at the time). I think next time I might warm the butter spread it then add the sugar and cinnamon and see if that helps.  Oh and I just put them into a 9x13 pan, easier for me then the cupcake pan.

Here is what I did to make it faster. Heat up 3/4 of the milk then use the other fourth to cool it to lukewarm. Melt margarine then brush on dough followed by sprinkling brown sugar and cinnamon. It's easier and faster than trying to spread a thick filling over the dough.  Also if you don't have brown sugar you can use white sugar mixed with a little bit of molasses. If you want to be exact with that substitution you can find a recipe for that on the internet.

Super Easy!! My 17 year old made these for us & was very surprised how easy it was.  We will have to double as we ate most of them as soon as they came out of the oven. We did not use a muffin tin. put them on a 10x13 cake pan. perfect size for this recipe.

I did not change a thing with the recipe and it turned out perfect. So nice to have a dessert that my kids can eat and enjoy. With so many food allergies in this household, it's hard to buy anything pre-made.  This is a great treat!

I made these yesterday and they were delicious. I opted to melt some butter and spread it directly onto the rolled out dough with a brush and apply the brown sugar and cinnamon combination out by hand. (It's not as dense and I felt like the distribution was a lot more even this way.) I also didn't use a muffin tin and put them into a deep dish baking tray and they came out heavenly. I made a quick frosting out of cream cheese, icing sugar, milk and vanilla. They went fast in my house!

So, so, SO good, and easier than I ever thought cinnamon rolls would be. I made mine in a 9x9 square pan so that they would stay softer, and baked them a little longer. Topped with a homemade whiskey-caramel sauce, these were truly mind-blowing.

The first time I made these was my first time handling yeast. I even got the dough to jump on the hook of my KitchenAid mixer the first time, which I found out isn't an easy feat. Topped with cream cheese frosting...they were snapped up in no time.

Added some pecans to the filling and they came out better than rolls from the local Amish bakery.  Best cinnamon rolls ever.

Loved this recipe, easier than other recipes I've tried and a huge hit with my family.  I added some raisins to a third of the roll after I sprinkled cinnamon mixture (before rolling of course) and diced apple to a third. Scrumptious and soft, a pleasure to make and to eat. Even on second day just pop them into microwave for 10-15 seconds to freshen them up. Drizzled with the suggested vanilla/butter/confec sugar and looked and tasted amazing.  Would post a pic but can't seem to find option but take my word for it, yummy.

I rarely bake with yeast,but did wonder how it could work going in dry with dry ingredients-but followed as written. It doesn't. I'll try it again mixing the yeast with warm wet ingredients.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls and they turned out great! I'm so happy I found this recipe, it was a quick and easy process. I had extra time so I mixed the yeast with the milk and butter then added it to the flour mixture after letting it develop for 15 min.The dough itself is delicious , I had leftover dough and decided to form them into buns and throw them in the oven as well.Just brush it with an egg yolk and you get beautiful golden brown and glossy bread buns.Since I had only a bit of butter left I decided to fill part of the dough with the cinnamon mixture and the other half with a chocolate cinnamon pecan concoction containing semi sweet chocolate,condensed milk,cinnamon and chopped pecans. I let in set in the fridge before spreading onto the dough.Soo good!! This recipe will definitely be my go to when my family and I are in the mood for some cinnamon rolls!

On my first try I did everything by the recipe (except for the muffin tin thing) and noticed that they didn't really rise like I wanted. Baked them anyway and made an icing from another recipe. They were pretty darn good in spite of the lack of rise.

Proofed the instant yeast on the second try and I can't explain, but it worked a little better Really didn't need the help.  Wonderful rolls!

OMG these were soooo good.  The dough was perfect and made soft delicious cinnamon rolls and the recipe is quick and easy.  Love everything about it.  I followed another reviewer and proofed 2 1/4 tsp active yeast in 1/4cup warm water than followed the recipe putting it in the bread machine.  My family devoured them.

This recipe makes for extra special Saturday morning brunches!! The only changes are that I use real unsalted butter and a drop of vanilla in the dough. While still hot from the oven, I drizzle with a light glaze -- mix 1/2 cup 10x sugar, drop of vanilla, pinch of cinnamon and enough milk to thicken it (2 tsp - 1/2 TBS).

Perfect! The only substitution I made was using butter instead of margarine. I made a batch of my favorite cream cheese frosting but after trying these plain I realized they didn't need frosting. Perfect on their own. Will add chopped pecans next time.

I love this recipe and so does my family, I always use a 9x13 pan and it makes for nice soft buns, I also, allow the rolls to rise over night once rolled and cut into sections and placed in pan, it makes for really fluffy rolls, but like them as well as followed on recipe

Yummy! Wonderful recipe and super easy. Made the recipe as is with butter instead of margarine. Excellent buttery taste and not too sweet. I will add more cinnamon and a little less butter and brown sugar next time. Overall easy and fast and loved by all!

these were really, easy, and quick. very good. my suggestion, is to make them in a 9 / 14 inch pan. then all the sweet gooeyness stays in the rolls, instead of dripping out of a muffin pan.

Best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I prepped these the night before (formed the rolls and put in a greased 9x13" pan), covered and put in the frige until morning. Took them out 30 minutes before baking and topped with cream cheese frosting post-bake. Very sweet, but paired them with some fresh fruit! I will definitely be making these again.

I've already made this for an N number of times. I tried the original recipe first before making substitutions so I could compare. The original recipe is already good as is. Today I ran out of milk, so I used full cream milk powder and some hot water; I did increase the milk in the recipe  to 1 cup though (so I don't have to scale down to 3/4 cup). I also tried subbing oil for the butter in the dough (not doing it again unless I run out of butter or margarine). I would change nothing in this recipe... well, except for the amount of milk.

I have made these 90 min cinnamon rolls several times now.  I've added rasins, walnuts, cranrasins, or left them alone with the cinnamony goodness. Love this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Sooo delicious! And so easy! But because of the carbs, we save it for special occasions. Like another suggested, I added 1/2 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. I also bake it in a 9x13 pan.

These were excellent. I used active dry yeast though and followed someone's recommendation to mix it with lukewarm water. I did that for 10 minutes and then added it to the flour and added all the other stuff ... egg, milk, margarine. I also topped it with icing right after removing them from the oven (1.5 cups icing sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tbsp or so of milk, 1 tsp vanilla).

Excellent cinnamon rolls.  I substituted 3/4 cu chopped pecans instead of raisins and they were delicious especially since I topped them with cinnamon icing.

I made these this morning and they were wonderful.  I used cream cheese icing to top them off.  If any complaints I thought they were a little too sweet.  But nobody else said anything.  A keeper for sure.

I am giving this one five stars because the dough and filling are perfect.  The method of baking is not.  I tried baking them both in a 13x9 dish and in the muffin tins, as the recipe suggests.  The ones I baked in the dish came out gooey and moist.  They only lasted two days.  The ones in the muffin tins came out very dry, and it was a struggle to get my family to eat them.  Plus, the filling overflowed from the muffin tin and is even now stuck to the bottom of my oven.  It smokes every time I preheat it.

I did everything the recipe called for and they did not rise. The bad thing was I cooked them for the community center breakfast. I really have no idea where I went wrong.

Great recipe! I've made a few times and they came out yummy but a bit heavy until this last time, when I used self rising flour instead of all purpose. Magic! They came out fluffy and light. Like other reviewers, I too topped them with a cream cheese icing (1/4 c butter, 1/2 c cream cheese, about 1 c powdered sugar).

This recipe is wonderful. Very simple and versatile.  As I am prone to do, I added a tsp. Of vanilla to the dough, filled them with walnuts, raisins and chocolate chips.  My boyfriend went crazy and I baked the ends first which made for a fun preview to the real deal. I topped them with sugar to give them a professional appearance. THANK YOU FOR POSTING!

Oh my word!! I have always wanted to try my hand at making cinnamon rolls. I live in a rural area and do not have access to fancy bakeries. I cannot begin to tell you how easy this recipe was to follow. My daughter gave me the best compliment ever by saying these were better than Cinnabon! Knowing that I was able to make these using organic ingredients make me so happy.

Wow these are good.  I modified my oven temp to 350 and left the muffen cups out.  Instead I baked the rolls on a baking sheet, and made an icing for additional sweetness.  Devine.

Amazing cinnamon buns! Made all the changes suggested in the reviews. Heated the 1/4C water till lukewarm (110-115F) then added the yeast and made it sit for 10 mins. I also baked in an 11"x 8" pan which was lined with parchment paper. About 5 minutes before they were done, I took a pastry brush and spread the cinnamon sugar butter mix on top of the buns to make them even more moist! Soooooo good! Thank you GOOFYDEBBIE!!

AMAZING! I skipped the muffin tin and used a baking dish. I also added finely chopped pecans to the sugar mixture and I'm stunned they aren't part of the original recipe, it just adds a wonderful flavor and texture. I also didn't use a full cup of flour as instructed, the dough came together wonderfully with just the initial 2 1/4 cups (and even that was bit dry), which was weird. Oh, well. 

But seriously folks, try this with the pecans! You won't be sorry!!

In my country, we don't eat cinnamon rolls. In fact, I didn't even know they existed, but know I think I'm addicted to these delicious things. I REALLY loved this recipe, I'm glad I founded it.

This was the easiest recipe for cinnamon rolls I ever made! They are so good too! Everyone in my house said WOW at the first bite!

My only issue is that the dough is so soft, it is hard to roll and form it. My batch came out all funny looking. I think next time I will chill the dough some after it rises but before I roll it out.

these are awesome! I put them in a greased pan because I didn't want to deal with the cupcake tin and it worked fine. Had to let them rise about 17 minutes longer but i think my kitchen was just a bit cool. They also cooked a bit longer but again that may  be due to the change in pan. I topped them with a simple sugar glaze with vanilla...everyone wanted more!

First time making this- first rise didn't happen but after cutting up the roll and letting it sit 30 minutes- the rolls popped out of the baking dish. Tasted great- very easy to make. Didn't have frosting ingredients, but will try again with cream cheese frosting. Follow the instructions and these rolls will come out fine. 
Use a bigger catch pan underneath- overflow will occur!

I make these a lot in the 9 x 13 pan.  I have changed it a little in that I spread the butter over the rolled out rectangle, then sprinkle double the brown sugar/cinnamon over the top of the butter.  I use floss to cut them to put in the pan. Everyone loves these and always wants more!  I use the Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing with them.  As we love cinnamon rolls these are always a hit!

Didn't rise at all. I followed the directions exactly, except for giving them extra time to see if they'd rise. Disappointed, that's for sure!

Tried this recipe this afternoon for after dinner dessert - as a company to watch winter olympics with hubby. Turned out it was a big success (to me as a very beginner). He was loving it :D Got a big compliment as well (which is not easy to get from him!), saying like "wow,finally my wife makes this after 7 years of marriage..it's better than cinnabon!" lol.. not sure if he was exaggerating :p I only care that he loves it as a special treat. He even said, "you can also sell this, hun!". Unexpected to hear from him. :D

Enough of the bragging, lol.. anyway, I made some modification. I put glaze (not on this recipe) which is from; confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla essence, and...a little mixture of water and cornstarch to thicken the glaze since I don't have cream today. Turned out pretty good!

The dough, I noticed the video version calls for 'active dry yeast', while the written version calls for 'instant dry yeast'. I didn't have 'active yeast' so I used 'instant' one instead. Turns out well - I've no complain about the dough. Rising perfectly. I tasted a bit stronger yeast taste, but not annoying. Just tasted like how bread is.

The butter for filling, instead of softening it, I melted it then mix it with the mix of brown sugar and lots of cinnamon (I put extra cinnamon cos hubby loves it). Turned out, it was a bit too watery but I feel it's easier to spread on the dough. But I think I'll prefer the 'soften the butter' way for next time so it won't give wet final result.

CINNAMON ROLLS IN 90 MINUTES?? YESSSS!  These turned out just great!  My husband said they were better than the Cinnabon at the mall!  (That's saying a lot.)  I made a simple powdered sugar and butter frosting to top them. If I make the again,  I'll only divide them into 10 instead of 12.  I'd just like them to be a bit bigger.

So simple to make, with ingredients I keep on hand. My sons LOVED them.  Made them in a muffin pan as said, and they rose to twice the height of the pan.  Topped them off with a milk/powdered sugar glaze for an extra touch of sweetness. LOVED THEM!

I did as recipe stated except I used butter instead of margarine and luckily did not use muffin tins. I just baked in a baking sheet with high sides. 
The flavor ended up being good, my kids loved it. But the dough was VERY sticky! It ended up only making 8 decent size rolls. I think next time I will use more butter and spread on the dough then sprinkle the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on it seperately. Then after its rolled up brush with more butter and brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on the outside the dough just seemed bland on the bare parts. I fixed that with some cream cheese frosting though.

My compliments to the person who submitted this! I followed exactly and came out with AMAZING buns that have my family and neighbors thinking I'm the bomb! No more overpriced, overhyped buns from the mall. This is a permanent
staple recipe in my home now. Very easy.

Made these for Sunday brunch.  Perfect!!! I didn't have margarine so I  used half butter and half shortening instead. Also, at the suggestion of other reviews,  I melted a little extra butter mixed with sugar & cinnamon and drizzled over the batch just before baking.  I used a 9x13 glass lasagna dish, and topped rolls of with cream cheese icing.  Amazing!

Easy takes a little longer than 90 but worth the wait, you don't have to bake these to dark to cook them thru, very nice dough. I had some Carmel and nuts so I made a few sticky rolls too. As for them boiling out of cupcake tins.... Use the big ones not the standard size. And always put a pan under anything that involves cooking sugar that's coming sense ;)

I LOVED this! Very easy and simple, anyone can make this! 
Tips-definitely make sure to put a pan underneath the rolls, the cinnamon mix drips a lot!
         When you make the cinnamon mix make sure not to melt the butter (I accidentally did), because it                drips a lot and makes it messy when cutting the rolls.

This is an awesome recipe for anyone to make and although I didn't add a cream cheese topping, it was delicious (if you do add the topping it will be nice too…although this can't get any yummier then it already is!!!! :)

Definitely try this…You won't regret it!

These turned out great! But instead of using the cupcake pan  I put them together in a 9x13 pan. They puffed up in the oven and fit perfect! I also made my own frosting for these using powdered sugar a little butter and milk.  Let's just say they didn't sit on the counter long ;-).

This is simply amazing! So delicious! I paired it with a recipe for cream cheese topping for cinnamon rolls. Never have I had a better roll! Didn't change anything. Made as stated. It took longer than the 90 minutes but worth the extra time. simple to make and divine to eat!

Incredible!!!  busy mom, work full time. easy, fast and delicious!!!! took 30min to cook and did them in a glass 9x13 pan. added whole pecans to filling. that way the one person in the family who doesn't like pecans can easily pick them out. there was a request for cr cheese icing to be added so I will to half of them next time since i found them sweet enough as is.

This recipe made the best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted! I did use my dough hook on my heavy duty mixer instead of hand kneading and baked them in a 9X13 pan. Thank you, Debbie, for sharing this great recipe.

Hubby couldn't believe this was my first attempt at making homemade cinnamon rolls. Delicious! I followed another tip and baked for about 30 minutes in a 9x11 pan and served them with a cream cheese frosting. I also added pecans to the cinnamon mixture. Next time I will make a double batch and freeze some as suggested.

These were delicious. Very soft and when the sugar mixture melted it made the bun super sticky which I loved.  I'll be adding more cinnamon the next time I make these though maybe its because I just like cinnamon

Very delicious and quick.  I used whole wheat white flour, and it worked perfectly.  Also baked them for only 11 minutes (just until lightly browned) because I like mine a little gooey.  Thanks for a great recipe!  ?

Made this recipe exactly as given. It was fabulous!! This was my first try at making cinnamon rolls, and I brought them to work.  To quote a coworker "divine!". The dough was sweet, but not too sweet, and easy to work with.  Paired it with The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing from this site.

Made these this morning and loved them.  I especially love that I can make them on the same morning I decide I'd like to have them.  Skipping the first rise is excellent.  I didn't have instant yeast and used used active dry yeast instead. No problems resulted at all.  Baked them in a 9 x 13 and they were perfect.

As is this is a perfect cinnamon roll.   The dough is easy to work with and so tender.  I personally like nuts in my cinnamon rolls so instead of the raisins I use chopped pecans.  I also like to top them with the cream cheese icing from reviewer MPCHARVAT.   This recipe has quickly become a family favorite and I make them about once a month.

These were the BEST cinnamon rolls I've ever made!  They were so easy!  I did let them rise about 45 minutes, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the cream cheese frosting recipe from another reviewer.  My kids loved them!  I'll definitely be making these again.

WOW!! I made these for Christmas morning and they were a HUGE hit! I made 2 batches and since my husband is a diabetic I used Splenda in one batch and Lite brown sugar for the cinnamon mixture, and the other batch was as the recipe is written. Both batches came out tasting wonderfully delicious! I surprised my husband with them and he was more than excited to try them! The cinnamon rolls turned out so light and do in fact taste like the ones you can purchase in the mall as one of the other reviewers stated, except I think these are better! They are simple to male and the aroma from the oven is pure heaven. Do make sure you have something in the oven to catch the oozey goodness. Not much, but some! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will definitely be baking them again soon!

This turned out beautifully, but I did slightly change it. The quantities are all the same, except I made 1.5x of the filling. Also I warmed up the water and added 1Tbs of the sugar, and let the yeast bloom for 10 minutes. Also I let it rise for 30 minutes near the oven vent before rolling it out.

The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because my son likes them. 

I couldn't find my usual cinnamon roll recipe so I tried these. They are bland and the filling is like cement.

I made these rolls two mornings in a row! What a hit with the entire family! I didn't change a thing other than I did bake them in a 9x13 rather than muffin tins. I also frosted them with cream cheese icing just because of out preference. Awesome!

I loved these! Soft and delicious.  I used a glass baking dish like other users because I like the pull apart buns better.  Other than baking in a glass dish for 25 minutes and brushing with butter before baking, I followed the recipe exactly.

Homemade cinnamon rolls are always so much better than store-bought. These worked great! Everyone loved them. I made them a second time adding mixed dried fruit to the dough and that was good too, but with the icing it was possibly just a little sweet for breakfast. Next time I might just try finishing them with a thin jam glaze or some sifted icing sugar.

Just pulled these out of the oven and OMW! Heavenly! I almost didn't make them because I saw the 1 star reviews, but I don't know what is wrong with those people! I have made many different Cinnamon Roll recipes, but none of them had the perfect texture/flavor I craved. THESE HIT IT PERFECTLY! They don't even need icing - they are THAT yummy. My husband said they were the best I've ever made, and we both agree that they are way better than Cindy's in the mall (Those never taste as good as they smell).  I followed the recipe exactly.  Remember, depending on where you live and the weather on the day you bake, you may need more or less flour.  The weather today was very mild and dry here, and I used the exact amount of flour called for. I baked them in a 9x13 glass pan, on top of a jelly pan in case of overflow (none actually occurred,) for 30 min. Watch the video.

This is a fine recipe that was quickly & easily prepared.  Needed a "fast" recipe & this fit the bill.  I do think that the filling was a little thick... either too sugary or not buttery enough... I will play around with it when I make these again.  Thanks so much for posting!  Made my daughter's birthday breakfast A+ in her book!

Delicious!  It took me a few attempts because I couldn't find the right baking pan.  I settled on a large lasagne pan (a Corningware Creations stoneware, 4qt) with high sides, and I bake them for 30 minutes.  They turn out perfectly every single time, and no bubbling out of the pan.

Making these this am for the umpteenth time!  Love this recipe!  I do use the large pan instead of the muffin pan because I like pulling them apart and they are all soft and gooey.  This is a fam fav at my house!

Easy enough but mine stuck very badly to the muffin tins. I was a little at the start with using the muffin tin and I was right. In terms of taste, they are ok but not really my thing. The cooking time was also a bit too much- mine were overdone with 5 minutes less.

Followed the recipe just about straight on and they turned out wonderful.  I've had bad experiences in the past with hard or flat cinnamon rolls but these are wonderfully light with a good chew to them.  The only thing I did differently was to use a little more brown sugar in the filling.

My first time making cinnamon rolls and I was very impressed with the results.  The only mistake I made was that I used active dry yeast and I just threw it in with the flour instead of letting it rise in warm water. After doing a "google" search to fix this mistake, I just let it rise an extra half hour and it was fine. I looked at the other reviews for helpful hints and I baked it in a 9 x 13 glass dish and brush it with melted margarine.  I also used my stand mixer for kneading the dough which was a great help.

I followed the recipe but the dough did not cook correctly. Maybe it was because I did not put them in individual muffin pans...left in the oven for extra time because...I might have rolled out the dough too flat...

The only down side is that I would say that the recipe doesn't call for enough flour so its a bit sticky but I just added more as needed and it worked out fabulously and I baked them in a regular pan rather than a muffin tin and worked out just as well. Will be using the same dough with a jam filling :)

These were absolutely the worst cinnamon buns I have ever had. Not only are they not much easier to make than traditional cinnamon buns, the muffin tin method pushes all the sugar, cinnamon, and butter filling out of the buns and onto the pan and oven. The end result? Burnt sugar buns. And the buns aren't very tasty to begin with! The picture even shows them made in a glass pan!

This recipe was very easy and fast. It tasted pretty darn good but not as good as the cinnabon clone recipe. I baked in a 9x13 for 20 min. Flipped it over on a pan when it got out of the oven. Ate it with cream cheese frosting! 4 oz cr cheese, 1/3 c butter, 2 c powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Yum!

Wonderful and soft! I put them in a 12x 13 pan, and wish I had spread them out to two pans.(I did not have a muffin pan) They def double in size and got rather misshapen so crowded. Delicious! Subbed oil for the margarine in the dough, and used about half the amount of brown sugar.

I made this with my 6-year-old, and we made it with my lactose intolerant son in my mind specifically. To make it non dairy, I subbed melted  coconut oil for the butter and used almond milk instead of cow's milk. I didn't have brown sugar, so I mixed some molasses into regular sugar. We baked it in a 9x13 pan, and it turned out great. We sprinkled a touch of powdered sugar over the top and served it up!

I think the instructions for placing in a muffin pan, is a bit odd since it will make a mess in your oven if not careful.  Instead of a muffin pan, I used a large deep sheet cake pan.  I placed each roll about one inch apart from the other.  Very good and I will make these often, I am sure.

5 stars all the way!  Just made a pan of these rolls and they live up to the hype.  Recipe is spot on. Dough was velvety and easy to work with. Filling to dough ratio was perfect.

Using a baking pan gave them soft edges. The muffin tin gave them baked edges all around, but they rose to a gorgeous spiral peak.  I'll be baking them both ways. Topped them with a little smear of simple cream cheese icing.  Can't wait to share these with coworkers at my elementary school. Teachers love good food!

This recipe was just a dream! Quick and tasty! Couldn't stop eating them. For the filling I used a 1/4cup margarine and a1/4 cup ghee in order to get that buttery taste. Great recipe !

Yummy! Agree that you should put a pan underneath the muffin tray to catch the drippings.

There was too much filling.  The taste was great, but it was a huge mess.  I topped them with a homemade cream cheese frosting and . . . wow!  These will be made with a few modifications next time.

This was my first time scratch-cooking any kind of dough. Everything came out really gooey and wonderful! I used a 9x13 glass, and baked mine for about 25 minute total.

Wonderfully easy and divinely delicious! Like others, I used a 9x13 instead of a muffin pan and part way through baking I brushed rolls with melted butter. I also made the suggested cream cheese icing given by MPCHARVAT and it was wonderful!

I was bored one night and decided to try this recipe. It's AMAZING! I covered them with a butter icing and my family loved them! I did not cook these in muffin tins I just placed them in a large baking dish and it worked great.

Great recipe!  Easy to put together and easy dough to work with!  The only difference I made was to spread the butter across the rolled out dough, then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture. Lower rating than 5 because it was easier to spread the softened butter across the rolled dough than to fight with mixing thoroughly with cinnamon/sugar.  I've already eaten 3 and they're still burning hot!

The recipe is perfect, I've made this recipe a bunch of times and everyone loves it every time. I've also been trying to find the right combination. I finally decided that it's best when you use a 12x9 pan. If you do decide to use muffin tins, which are fine but I do not recommend, make sure you put a cookie sheet underneath the muffin tins to catch the gooey filling that spills over the edge. Also if you don't have a 12x9 pan that's very tall, use a pan underneath that as well. Also, depending on your oven, you may want to leave them in a little longer than 20 minutes just to give them a bit of colour. Just make sure you keep an eye on them! Great recipe, highly recommended, thank you to whoever put this up!

The rolls didn't rise like I expected and the filling stayed dry and crumbly.  Will try with new yeast and butter instead of margarine.

There's nothing wrong with them, but I've had/made much better. The bready part isn't very fluffy.  
 Cinnamon rolls take so much time and resources to make it's disappointing when they aren't amazing. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe that doesn’t require a bread machine. Any time I make these, people RAVE over them. I put them in a buttered 9x13 glass pan instead of muffin tins. I usually make the rolls the night before and put them in the refrigerator overnight to slow rise. In the morning I set them out for a few minutes and then put them into the oven WITHOUT preheating it. I turn the oven on at 375 and they always rise perfectly while they cook. I make icing with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 1/2 tablespoons milk. I put the icing in a ziplock bag and in the refrigerator overnight. I set the icing out while the rolls cook, then cut a corner of the bag and drizzle it on the rolls when they are done in a cross-cross pattern.

I've never made cinnamon rolls from scratch before, but I thought I'd give these a try based on the many positive reviews. These were some of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. I was so proud of myself! I followed the directions exactly, baked them in a 9" x 13" pan, and made the cream cheese frosting mentioned by another reviewer. They were simply amazing, and I won't hesitate to make them again. I did use the proofing setting on my oven to let them rest/raise both times as it was a cool and rainy day here. Next time, I will add some chopped pecans per my husband's request. Thanks for a simple and wonderful recipe!

I started this in my bread machine and baked then in a large, round, greased spring form pan -(it's easier to remove the buns from this than a square pan!).  Finished them with a gooey cream cheese icing - just to add a few more calories!  I always have one of those "spill pat mats" at the bottom of my oven for easy, if necessary, spills.

This was amazing. They looked great and tasted even better. I set the cut rolls in an oven tray lined with foil, sprayed with cooking spray. I had no problems with butter/sugar mix oozing out. I also had no problems removing the rolls from the foil after baking. The one thing I did differently was to use butter instead of margarine. That took it up a notch in flavour. I used raisins and it was just heavenly. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Its super simple and can make a lot.  You don't even need any icing and honestly the icing would be too much.  I would recommend cutting them so that when they are completely baked, they are only 2 1/2 inches to 3 inches in diameter.  Otherwise, its too much sweet for my taste anyways.  But with that said, I'll never do cinnamon rolls out of the can ever again.  If I can't have them this way, I'll just pass.

So, so yummy! I loved them and so did my family. The muffin tins were too small for them, so they kinda puffed up, but it didn't really matter. It also took me longer than 90 minutes, but it was totally worth it. And I added 4 tablespoons of cinnamon.

my ten year old tried this recipe, it turned out great although we made a few tweaks to make it easier (and longer). :)I told her that kneading and mixing the dough was hard so we put it in the bread machine for an hour and a half, we used dry yeast, and i dont know whether we were supposed to or not but we used cake flour so the roll in the end was much more moist. In all this was a great recipe and i will definitly try it again

Very easy to make, I recommend just making it in a pan because they get REALLY big and it looks a tad bit awkward in the muffin tin. This recipe made exactly 13 cinnamon rolls, which is perfect! I also recommend making a thinner longer roll so that you get more cinnamon buns, because my 13 cinnamon buns got extremely big in the oven. They might look like they didn't rise enough, but dont let that deceive you!

My husband made this recipe today. He doesn't know much about baking, so the fact they turned out GOOD (not great) is probably an indication that the recipe is fine. He baked them in a 9" round non-stick (metal) pan, and they were done in 22 minutes at 375 degrees. I think other reviewers who cited longer cooking times must have reduced the temp below the recommended 375. I think 350 or even 325 might work better. His were a bit on on the dry side. I'll bet the cream-cheese icing would have made them just about perfect.

Havent finished it up yet so I do not know how they are going to taste, since the quanities are not listed in the directions, and I think I used the wrong amount of butter in the batter. Maybe someone can update this recipe with the amounts listed in the directions for half asleep half blondes like myself.

These are awesome.  I have just started baking my own breads and this was easy.  I did the cream cheese frosting that another person suggested putting on the rolls.  They were butter and sweet.  Yummy! The best part is that my grand kids loved them.

Just made these this morning and they were delicious! I only made one alteration - I added about 3/4 c. more flour, because I didn't knead by hand (I used my mixer with the dough hook). It needed a little more flour to "climb the hook" and clean the bowl. The balance of butter, sugar, and cinnamon in the filling was great - they weren't too sweet. The flavor was excellent! On the recommendation of others, I did put a rimmed baking sheet under my muffin tin, to catch drips. Oops, I lied - I made two alterations; I used butter instead of margarine.

This was very easy to work with other than due to a mistake on my part. I used 1C bread flour and the rest white whole wheat because I don't buy AP flour. I used the stand mixer for the mixing and kneading. I misread the instructions and melted the butter for the filling and it made a total mess. I lost a lot of filling out the ends and when rolling because it was too liquid. This made it very hard to cut and get into the muffin tins so the results were less than even. However, they turned out fine and I will definitely try these again. I was surprised how easily the popped out of the muffin tin and had fully expected them to stick but very little of the filling leaked out.EDIT:3/12/13  Tried these again as planned and they are a huge mess as written.  Perhaps it's written for jumbo muffin tins but the center of the roll rises up in a cone shape and the filling leaked over (and under) making a big smokey mess. They taste really good right out of the oven and came out of the tins fine but I would not use a muffin tin again.

Good starter. I used non instant yeast so I cut out most of the water and added vanilla instead. Also, I'd recommend not mising your brown sugar/cinn with the butter. Rather spread the butter and press the mix into it - makes for a better roll and cleaner cuts

I tried this recipe, deadly sweet, I adjusted the margarine that was mixed with the brown sugar and cinnamon to 1/4 c instead of 1/2 c.  It did not seen to to anything to the recipe.  Personally I would make this again but somehow eliminate some of the sweetness.  Maybe reduce the brown sugar that was spread over the dough by half and instead of raisins I will use dried cranberries.

This recipe is excellent. Very easy to make and very delicious to eat! The only thing I did differently was to make them in a pan versus the muffin tin. Bread is light and airy, and hands down the best cinnamon roll filling.

This recipe was AMAZING! I didn't even let the rolls rise after cutting them, I just popped them in the oven right a way and they got enormous! The butter and brown sugar inside the rolls leaked out a lot on to my pan but I didn't care because it made this delicious caramel-y treat which I ate gleefully. I am definitely making these again and sharing the recipe with all my friends.

First time I ever made Cinnamon Rolls were by using Alton Brown's recipe. But I was looking for something as delicious but less time consuming. THIS IS THE RECIPE! Me and my husband couldn't stop eating them. They are best warm out of the oven. I did use a cream cheese frosting. I can't wait to make them again! 2018 update-still my go to recipe!!

I liked this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe without a bread machine.  Other recipes were a bit hard for me (a beginner with bread) but THIS ONE WAS EASY!  I didn't even knead it for 5 minutes.  And they were still REALLY good.  They were a little heavy but yummy.  I'm going to attempt it again to see if kneading helps with the heaviness or not.  Otherwise with the homemade cream cheese icing...they were a HIT!

Very easy recipe, it mention cooking them in muffin pans, I had never tried it before so I thought I would, it makes them look beautiful but I find the outside of the bun is a little to hard, so I'd probably cook in a cake sheet next time to try and keep some moisture in the buns.

Made this for a New Years Day brunch and it was a big  hit. I have never made anything with yeast before and I was very proud. I doubled the recipe and baked them in four 8x8 disposable pans since I had to travel with them.  This recipe also gave me a chance to use my dough hook on my stand mixer which kneaded the dough into a perfect ball.  I think the next time I might add a little more butter to the dough but the recipe as is is AWESOME!!!

These cinnamon rolls were very good!  The kids and myself loved them.  My only complaint is the instruction for using a muffin pan.  The filling tends to bubble out causing a sloppy mess on the tin and drips onto the bottom of the oven. I almost got smoked out of my kitchen by the sugar mix that caught fire. Some of you might think to put a cookie sheet under to prevent that, but as an inexperienced cook, it wasn't on the 'how to' so I didn't do it.  Next time I will use a pan and cook them longer to prevent such an occurance.

These were very good for the 90 minutes it took.  Actually I had baked a Paula Deen recipe I found on the internet a couple days before and these tasted better, but the actual bread part was not as good as the Paula Deen ones which had two separate times to rise.  So if you have time, do the two risings, and use this recipe.  I think why we liked it much better than the Paula Deen was that this one uses brown sugar and Paula Deen uses white sugar.  The brown sugar has the best flavor but the 2nd rising is what makes the lightest and fluffiest cinnamon rolls

Made these, they are awesome! I added some slivered almonds and a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips to the brown sugar glaze and it's delightfully delicious!

You can't go wrong with these... I made them for Christmas morning it only took about 90 minutes... I made a quick butter cream glaze and plopped it on when they were warm. Raves. Absolute RAVES. All the flavor and half the work of other recipes! I made mine in a 13x9" pan and decided to forgo the muffin cups... they came out perfect! Thank you GoofyDebbie!

I did not like this recipe.  The dough was too dense and the filling dry.  I also had spill over into the oven.  If you make this recipe, put the rolls on a deep cookie sheet or put the muffin pan on a cookie sheet.  You will have overflow and the sugar will burn.

I have always been intimated by any kind of recipe where dough is involved until I made these absolutely yummy rolls (watching the video was extremely helpful)!  After reading other reviews, I used a 9 x 13 glass dish and baked the rolls for 20 minutes.  I also added chopped pecans to the cinammon/butter/brown sugar mixture.  My husband gave them 5 stars!

Made this tonight and wish I had put a cookie sheet under them while baking or baked them in a pan. The sugar mixture gets pushed up and out as the rolls expand. It dripped down onto my oven (pain in the butt I have to clean it now) and nearly caught fire. Smoked out the whole house. I wish I had read the reviews earlier as others have had the same problem. The recipe should be re-written.
Also, I added the raisins and the rolls, although fluffy and soft, are too sweet to eat. I will make these again but use 1/8 cup of sugar in the dough and make 1/2 as much cinnamon goo, omit the raisins, and bake in a pan.
I also will roll the dough out to a 24"x 30" sheet before rolling. The recipe says to roll it out to a 12x9 rectangle but at that size mine was about 3" thick still.

Would be a 5 if she'd said to  make it in a larger pan all together.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and they were too dry.  This time I made them in a 9 by 13.  They look perfect at 30 mins baked.  Making cream cheese icing for these!  Yum.  (:

Fantastic cinnamon rolls. I too used a 9x13 pan instead of muffin tins. Everyone loved them. Now I have to make them at least twice a month. Best recipe for cinnamon rolls I've found. Very easy recipe.

These were terrific. I froze a few portions and after a few minutes in the toaster oven, they were just just like fresh baked. Can't wait to make them for Christmas morning.

Tried it last night as my first attempt at cinnamon rolls! They came out great, my boyfriend loved them, and our apartment smelled wonderful :) I used a 9x13 Pyrex baking pan instead of muffin tins, and since I like thinner dough I rolled it out to a larger size and ended up with closer to 20 rolls. Loved 'em!

FANTASTIC. My first cinnamon roll recipe, and now the only one I will ever use.

Do put in a baking dish, not muffin tin, and frost with cream cheese frosting. I cooked them at 350 for about 20 mins for perfectly soft, but cooked, cinnamon roll centers.

I made a few substitutions... almond milk instead of regular milk, butter instead or margarine, Stevia instead of sugar and coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and it still came out AMAZING!!!! My family begs me to make these all the time. Something I have found that puts them WAY over the top is that if you are going to make icing for them, instead of vanilla extract add butter flavor...Seriously to die for! I do think they are a little dry the next day but if you reheat them in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds per roll it solves that problem.

I don't usually review but I thought these were so easy and quick.  I have another recipe for cinnamon rolls but these are going to be the recipe I use now. The only thing I would do different next time is brush the rolled dough with butter and sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon on top because all the filling was on the bottom of the roll...........but they were delish and I will defineatly make again...I did put them in a 13x9 pan and cooked for 20 min.........GREAT

This is a good, solid recipe, that is easy to follow. The cinnamon rolls were very tasty, although I wish they came out fluffier. The fact that they didn't may very well have been my fault, as I'm a very novice baker.

Finally a recipe for dough that I can make using yeast! I was skeptical but took the plunge because I was desperate for a cinammon roll and we are 45 minutes from a mall!
I think I will try making this without all the sugar and see if I could have a home made pizza this way, now that I am brave enough to use yeast!
I too made it in a round pan which worked fine, and by mistake only used a half stick of butter for the filling. THE USE OF DENTAL FLOSS TO CUT THE ROLLS IS A BRILLIANT IDEA WHICH SOMEONE ELSE OFFERED AND WORKS WONDERS!

This is a great recipe, really easy to follow. I used a muffin tin to bake the rolls but if like me you have a  gas oven that heats from the bottom and doesn't have a fan to distribute heat you will have to turn them upside-down halfway through cooking to make sure they're cooked through. They taste great and I will definitely make them again.

These were oustanding!! The only thing I did different, was use to use butter. This is my first time making homemade cinnamon rolls, and these were foolproof.  Just followed the directions, and they came out perfect.

I really liked the time I saved making these cinnamon rolls. The kids loved them. As  MPCHARVAT suggested, I used (1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup softened margarine, 2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 teas vanilla, and 1/8 teas salt)  for the topping.

Very easy dough to work with. We live at high altitude so it didn't take as much flour to get a smooth dough. Only about 2 3/4 cups plus flour for dusting the work surface. Baked in a 9 x 13 dish.

I substituted the milk for skimmed milk, Unblanched whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and half of the margarine in the filling for 1/4 c of applesauce. Delicious!

Wow these were great, and really truly 90 minutes from start to finish! Hoorah!
I smothered mine in cream cheese frosting (1/4c butter, 1 1/2c powdered sugar, 4oz cream chz and 1tsp vanilla).
My husband gave the cinnamon rolls a 5 and said that the added goodness of frosting pushed them to a 6 (out of 5). 
Thank you for a great recipe! =D

Awesome recipe.  I am very much a amateur baker and this recipe could not be easier. I followed the recipe as written but I did take others suggestions and used baking pans rather than the muffin pan.  I am glad I didn't make the icing because the rolls are very sweet by themselves.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls.  I was a little nervous about this recipe because it took so much less time than others I had read.  To my pleasant surprise, they came out AMAZING! They were fluffy and moist...and far exceeded my expectations.  I went with the 9X13 pan as opposed to muffin tins as others had mentioned, and also did extra cinn/sugar/butter before baking, topped with cream cheese icing.  Fantastic!

These are incredible! The only thing that I did different was add more brown sugar and a lot more cinnamon (personal preference). Everyone that has them loves them!!! Thanks for this great recipe!

These cinnamon rolls were very easy and relatively tasty for the effort.  They weren't quite as rich and satisfying as another recipe I have, but that recipe takes almost all day to make.  I might try adding another egg yoke and using brown sugar (and increasing the amount slightly) in the dough itself, to see if that deepens the flavor a bit more.  Also, a large portion of the cinnamon filling melted out of the rolls when baked.   Maybe that is why the recipe says to put them in individual muffin tins to bake, which admittedly I did not do.  But if you are looking for an easy, quick, almost fool-proof home-made cinnamon roll recipe, I would recommend this one.

Delicious! They turn out every time! I sometimes frost them with a thin sugar frosting that hardens when it cools, and when I'm feeling especially decadent, I make a gooey cream cheese frosting. Either way, they are scrumptious!

Mmmmm, I substituted Butter for margarine I used half a stick in the dough and half a stick in the filling, I also upped the cinnamon and brown sugar, I used a baking sheet which allowed some of the filling get loose. I used crushed walnuts instead of raisins. The family loved them! Excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe. My first ever attempt at cinnamon rolls turned out perfectly. I did need to add extra flour to the dough to make it rollable, and next time I might add more cinnamon to suit my taste. Also, I forgot the raisins! So those will go in next time for sure. I love finding nice, simple recipes that don't involve bread machines (I don't have one) or fancy ingredients (I live in Asia, and baking ingredients can be hard to track down). Thank you for this!

Fantastically easy recipe! I was looking for a fast recipe that is delicious and this is it.  I used a 9x13 pan. I added nuts on the inside as well as the butter/sugar mixture but also poured a nut mixture over the top before baking(1/2 c of d. brown sugar, 1/4 c soft butter and a capful of van flavoring, put in micro until melted) they tasted just like the ones in the mall! The cook time for me was exactly 20 minutes. They came out brown, soft and yummy. Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper!

So easy and delicious!  My dough seemed a little sticky at first but when I rolled out I used parchment paper and it rolled out just fine.  It is really cold right now so I had to soften my butter in the microwave for the filling.  I ended up melting it and pouring it over the rolled out dough before sprinkling the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top.  this worked out fine, though the butter ran over the edge a little bit.  Cooked in foil pan b/c I don't have a muffin tin.  Came out beautiful!  I have limited baking supplies so I eyeballed the salt, but I think it could have had some more.  It would have been nice to have a little saltier dough to go with the really sweet filling.  Still, enjoyed by the entire family!

Excellent recipe and I was glad to find one that doesn't use a bread machine, because I don't have one.  I followed as written except that I used a 9x13" pan and they turned out nicely.  I see the advantage of using the muffin pan since they won't stick together.  I think the step where you let the rolls rise for 30 minutes could have been omitted, because mine didn't rise at all and they do plump up  nicely in the oven.  I used a powdered sugar/butter/milk/vanilla extract glaze for icing.  Yum!

I'm not a baker by any means but I did make these and was very proud of myself! They were soooo good and really pretty easy. They only thing I did differently was not adding nuts, they are pretty rich but then again they are cinnamon rolls!

I have never made cinnamon rolls from scratch. And I have to say that these were easy and scrupdilliocious ! I will make these again and again. I did use a few tips from others. Adding the additional mixture on the top and when pulling out of the oven, I put a damp towel on them for 15min then turned them out upside down in a container. Gobbled them up. Next time I am going to try walnuts or pecans and drizzle them with the cream cheese icing. Thank you.

The dough for this recipe is wonderful. The problem is when you roll it out to a 9X12 shape and then roll it up. The 12 rolls are too big to fit into a muffin tin. I ended up making 24 rolls instead. I also will plan on cutting back on the cinnamon next time.

This is a great recipe. I've made cinnamon rolls a couple times before and they were a total flop, but these are very tender, moist, and not too sweet. In my opinion they don't need a glaze or icing. The only complaint is that they took much longer than ninety minutes to make - more like 2 hours start to finish. But that being said I never would have made them if I thought it would take longer, and I'm sure glad I did!

These are my new favorites!  I made them with Orange Filling instead, but the rolls were so tender and soft.  Absolutely wonderful. (I did bake mine in a 9x13 since I prefer the inside pieces best) Thank you for a wonderful and quick recipe.

I absolutely love these cinnamon rolls! I have made several kinds and these are the best! I have made these 7 times now and each time they come out perfect! Everyone who eats one falls in love and can't believe how amazing they are. I drizzle extra cinnamon sugar butter before baking and top off with cream cheese frosting. Thank you for such a fantastic recipe. These give you respect in the kitchen after your peers eat one bite!

Easy recipe! Had fun making it. The only draw back was when I put the cinnamon mixture on the dough and rolled it... it made a mess and oozed out a HUGE mess. Rolls turned out ok. I had to put a cookie sheet below the muffin pan and thank goodness, but it seeped over the side. Overall very tasty :)

i tried this recipe this morning, and wondered if I should follow the instructions and put the yeast in with the flour mixture as opposed to dissolving it in the warm milk

i followed the recipe and mixed the my active dry yeast in with the flour and it didn't 'dissolve' into the dough - i could see the tiny yeast balls whilst kneading, I proceeded baking and it looked pretty ok but inside was dense and sort of like dry bread pudding... still edible...

i will try this again but will mix the yeast in with the warm milk before mixing it into the flour...

Delicious, accidentally made 8 cut, sat to rise, but didn't rise much, but came out fantastic. Will probably make another recipe to finish off the cream cheese frosting I have left over.

Oh my goodness these were si good! My husband thinks I should win some award for making this! I baked them in a 9x13 and put pecans inside instead of raisins. I inverted them and the melted butter and sugar with the pecans made a delicious drizzle. These were amazing! I started them at 1:30 and my kids had a wonderful after school treat, so fast and easy! I will be making these again and again!

Absolute perfection!  I've been baking for many many years and this is one of the easiest, yummiest cinnamon roll recipes I have come across.  I double the recipe, knead for 5 minutes in my mixer, used two 9" x 12" pans and topped with just a little bit of cream cheese icing (We enjoy the bread taste more than the sweet). I've made them 3 times now and each time they have been a family favorite. Left overs cut in half make for wonderful cinnamon french toast :)

These were great!  I wish I would of stuck to the original 20 minutes instead of 25 like recommended by some reviewers, they were a tad bit over done on the bottom.  Great cinnamon rolls though, I topped them off with a cream cheese icing!

My best friend and I made these last Sunday for a trat, and they were amazing!!! I had to subistitute brown sugar for white sugar becasue we were out, but they turned out just fine! These took more than 90 minutes, but were so worth it. One hint though? FOLLOW THE RECIPIE! PUT THEM IN MUFFIN CUPS! I was an idiot and didn't. They were still really good, but the yummy sugar and cinamin oozed out the bottom and hardened into the worst hard candy I have ever tasted. We scraped the bottoms off, and tried the last half in the muffin cups. MUCH better. Also, they do expand A LOT in the oven, so don't worry if your rolls are small! :) Yum!

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls and my husband and I thought these were pretty good! The only thing for me was that they were a little too sweet for my taste. And after putting on the brown sugar mixture and rollng them up, it was very messy. But it is definitely a recipe I would use again and just tweek it a little bit.

These cinnamon rolls are perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked them in a casserole dish instead of a muffin tin. In response to those who said the cinnamon rolls were dry, try baking for just a couple minutes less.

I've made these many times, and they are always fantastic!! I get rave reviews. I add a ton more raisins than the recipe calls for. The more the better! Little pieces of apple in with the raisins is also just divine! Of course you must top this with cream cheese frosting.

I actually put them in the refrigerator overnight to rise and bake in the morning. They're rising right now. So far so good :D
The only thing is some of th filling liquified onthe bottom of the glass pan I'm using. 

Crossing my fingers!!! Will add photos. 

Honestly was kinda scared bc of the negative reviews...

Super easy and super yummy! I used whole wheat flour and turned out perfect. It was a bit sticky to knead but I just keep on adding flour while kneading until it came to a nice dough (it will never be smooth with whole wheat). Also, I let it rest it rest after lining up in baking pan for 2 hours because I wanted to bake them right before we sat for dinner. Result: warm, soft rolls for dessert. Had it with choc sauce.
Love this! thank you for the recipe, GD!

These are great cinnamon rolls. I wanted a more gooey sticky bun so instead of cream cheese frosting or a powdered sugar frosting i made a brown sugar goo  with macadamia nuts and poured it in the bottem of the pan. I placed the rolls ontop of the goo. Let rise like the recipe says and baked. Mmmmm is all my 6 kids and hubby could say. I will make these time and time again

These are excellent! I only made a few changes. Instead of instant rapid yeast. I used active yeast. I had to dissolve it in the 1/4 water (warm) for 5 minutes instead of adding the yeast directly in the dry ingredients. Also I didn't use the entire sugar/butter filling since I also spread icing on top after it finished baking. Yummy!!

Good and easy.  I made the recipe almost exactly as is (I used butter and added raisins).  And then put a glaze over it.  The only regret I have is not reading some more of the reviews first.  I put 6 of the rolls into a large muffin pan and the other 6 in a 11x7 pan (because I didn't have another large muffin pan);
The ones in the muffin pan did rise a little, the ones in the 11x7 flattened out then rose a little.  The ones in the muffin pans browned way too much, the ones in the 11x7 came out perfect.  Will probably make this again but use a 9x13 pan as others did.

4 stars for easy recipe, only 2 stars for taste. Made these in about 1.5 hours. After I put the yeast in with the dry ingredients with the lukewarm milk, the dough did not rise as expected. But the rolls baked well. Used melted demerara brown sugar, a couple of splashes of vanilla extract, and butter for icing. BF said they were "meh" - not bad, but too doughy. I agree. Maybe next time I'll use a thicker layer of the icing.

These are wonderful and have become the traditional (and MUCH requested) Christmas/Thanksgiving breakfast at our house!  They take me longer than 90 minutes (only because they don't rise very fast in my cold kitchen) but are well worth the wait.  I top with cream cheese icing - YUM! YUM! YUM!

one of the most easiest recipie for cinnamon rolls ive found and they are very GOOD. The only thing i changed was adding more cinnamon 1 tablespoon wasn't enough for us.DO NOT melt the butter or you'll have a big mess, it should be a thick paste.

This is by far the BEST and ONLY cinnamon recipe I use. Everyone absolutely loves these. I find giving more rising time and kneading VERY well until the dough puffs back immediately when you press it down. With these rolls, I don't even have to worry about doubling the brown sugar and butter aspect of the roll, these have an adequate amount. The only thing I'd add is a cream cheese frosting for on top!

This recipe is amazing. I made it about a month ago as a surprise for my fiance and a couple of his friends. After looking at the pan, I decided that one batch wouldn't be enough. So, I made another. I ended up having way too many, and so our neighbors ended up getting to have homemade cinnamon rolls as well. I'm making these again tonight so that I can bake them in the morning. Wonderful recipe! (Note, the first time I baked them, I made the rolls up the night before, and I covered them with plastic wrap and let them rise in the fridge overnight. Perfection!)

My daughter, 15, who never cooks said this morning, "I want to make cinnamon rolls". We never made before so I printed this recipe since it said 90 min. and looked fairly easy. Followed recipe exactly. However, used a 9x13 glass pan spacing the 9 rolls so not quite touching. Also she wanted frosting so we got from recipe called "Clone of Cinnabon". Rolls ended up big and fluffy like 4-5". I read review that had problems with the dough not rising, could maybe water been too cold or the milk cooled down to much and yeast didn't activate??? After we added the warm milk the dough definitely started to look alive! By the time the oven was preheated they had expended in the pan quite a bit. Grew even more during baking. When 20 min. were up, they looked perfect touching the sides of pan and each other. Moved rolls to a serving plate, then spooned any melted filling left in the pan over the rolls so not to waste. Topped with frosting. YUMMMM!!! These were melt in your mouth with a little bit of crunch and the best thing I think I have ever tasted! My daughter could not even finish one because she said it was so sweet. I think the frosting looked nice drizzled on top but maybe was overkill on the sweetness. But that's good because then we won't eat too many!  Next time I will make w/o adding any frosting and maybe even try a little less brown sugar in the filling. Thanks GOOFYDEBBIE for a great first experience making cinnamon rolls w/my daughter!

These are EXACTLY like the Cinnabon rolls. I have made them about 8 times now and they have turned out perfect every time. I can't rave enough about these rolls, they are awesome. I added chopped pecans and they are best when Dark brown sugar is used. I also added extra cinnamon. I didn't use baking cups, just placed them close together in a 9x12 baking dish and they are the best! Topped them with cream cheese icing and WOW

as others have said, the cinnamon center oozed out in the baking process. i would have liked for it to stay inside the rolls. granted, i did bake them on a cookie sheet. i will be trying this again, but i will also try other recipes for comparison. i did enjoy that i was able to go from zero to a sweet treat in so little time. i, also, added a light frosting (powedered sugar and a touch of milk). not sure it needed it.

This was an easy recipe to follow, except in the steps you tell us to add margarine twice, and it was a tad confusing at first.  I also think that this recipe would be better if you cut it into 9 rolls and placed them in a brownie pan instead.    Great recipe, though

Excellent! I only gave it 4 stars because I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, so I don't know how it would've came out without it. But I love it; it's so quick!

I found this recipe fast and easy and the cinnamon rolls tasted amazing! (Despite not having frosting.) I will be making these again.

This is the first time I tried to make cinnamon rolls and this recipe is awesome! I baked them in a pan rather than the muffin. Topped with a cream cheese frosting So Good!

I've made this recipe many many times. We loved it. they are great. We add the rasins to the dough while we are mixing the dry ingridients as well as ground  cinnamon. We love raisins  and cinnamon.

These cinnamon rolls turned out very pretty. They rolled up very nicely and looked like they'd come from a bakery when they were done. However, I'd have to say they were sort of dry. I had a feeling they would be somewhat dry before I even baked them, because the recipe only called for 1 package of yeast. I have tried other cinnamon rolls recipes before, which also used only 1 bag of yeast and came out sort of dry. However, these tasted pretty good. I did added some frosting to spice up the sweetness. Some people might want to eat these without extra frosting, as they still taste great without it.

These were perfect! They were perfectly soft and delicious! The only problam I had was that I had to add quite a lot of extra flour to be able to roll it out, but I might have just put too much milk.

First time ever I've used yeast and these turned out YUMMY! I also used a 9x13 pan but everything else I followed to a T. My mixer has a kneading attachment which helped a lot. I had a can of cream cheese frosting on hand and a dollop of that made the rolls just wonderful,  thanks so much this recipe is certainly a keeper!

I made this just as written, except for baking in a 9X13 pan.  The dough came together flawlessly, and I did not have to add extra flour like some.  I made this in my KA mixer, kneading for 5 minutes and then just having it rest in the same bowl.  It was one of the easiest doughs to roll out and cut.  But after 30 minutes, they were still pretty much the same size.  I waited another 10 minutes, but needed to bake since these were for my kids before school.  I popped them into the oven and hoped for the best.  Somehow, when these started baking, they rose up and looked like beautiful cinnamon rolls.  I have actually never had rolls that turned out so perfect looking in the pan.  And they taste just as great, if not better, than most recipes that take at least twice as long.  Will make these often.  Thanks!

My first attempt at using a yeast recipe and it was a total success. I made a cream cheese icing and added that while they were still a bit warm and YUM! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Yummy!!! Since it was my first time baking these cinnamon rolls 'cosmetic' part didn't look so good.. one was bigger than the other and so on... but hmm, hmmmm, it was delicious!!! My husband, who is a huge cinnamon roll fan absolutely loved it! But these do have lots of calories, as my husband put it thus making me laugh: "yummy to my tummy and calories go to my bummy"

I threw everything in my bosch mixer and let it knead for 5 minutes on low.  I let them rest right there in the bowl.  They turned out great and were quick and easy. I also topped with a cream cheese frosting.

I always forget to rate these! These were really good and quick. And lucky for me I had some cream cheese in the fridge and I made the cream cheese icing and frosted them. But oh my God! I made a mistake! I accidentally MELTED the butter (I used butter instead of margarine) instead of just letting it get softened. When I took out the butter from the microwave, my sister was telling me that it's usually not melted (the butter), and after they were baked, I looked at the recipe again and she was right!  No wonder why it was so messy to cut! (I did use thread though) I also put them in a 9x13 in. glass pan.. just put them together.. not far apart. Butter melted or not, the result was amazing. Definitely wish I could make them again if I wasn't lazy!

A breeze to make and they taste fantastic. They also freeze well. Suggest putting some baking powder in to combat the sour taste of the yeast.

YUM.  Delicious cinnamon rolls.  The dough for me was still quite sticky after adding the rest of the flour (total of 3 1/4 cups) so I added another 1/2 cup and then used a LOT of flour for dusting when I was kneading it.  Was worried this would make the dough dry, but it didn't at all.   I baked them in the muffin cups, but next time, I think I'll use the Pyrex 13x9. And as another user said, DEFINITELY put a tray under these, I didn't and they were dripping so much that there was a lot of smoke in my kitchen! They cooked in 15 minutes.

This was a very easy,tasty recipe.I used a bit more flour while kneading,because iI felt the dough needed more structure,rolls spread quite a bit while baking.The butter-cinnamonmixture was more than enough,I had enough to add after rising,made them more delicious but hard to remove from pan after cooling..I would make this again and again.Maybe add some vanilla to the dough for extra flavor,not so bredy.

These rolls are definitely best on the first day, when they're nice and warm from the oven.  Thankfully, they're so good that you probably won't have the problem of leftovers.  I used a 9x13 pan and actually made 16 rolls to feed a crowd.  Tasty!

This recipe resulted in some cinnamon rolls that were better than okay, but not what I was expecting after reading other reviews. They tasted as if something was missing. Never could put my finger on it. They tasted a little bit better after I made a powder sugar icing to go on top, but still had that aftertaste that something was missing.

I have made quite a few cinnamon rolls from this site, and these ones were good, but not the best.  I see no one else has mentioned this, so perhaps it's my oven, but I baked these for 20 minutes and they were a little dry, and I didn't think there was enough filling.  Also, took me closer to 2 hours to make them.   Overall good, though.

These were okay.  For the amount of work required, I expected them to be spectacular.  The dough was a bit 'doughy" even though it was fully cooked and the filling was so-so.  We prefer other recipes from this site like the "glazed cinnamon biscuits."

We made these for Breakfast today and they turned out great! The only thing we did different was we added the yeast to the water ( warm water ) and let sit for about 7 mins. then we added it in to the mix at the same time as we added the egg and Milk mixture. They were a huge it... I tried one of the cream cheese frosting. I liked it! But the rest of the family said that they would have liked them better with out. We will be making these again for sure!!!

The cinnamon roll itself is really tasty!  My boyfriend at them without the frosting--however, it would be good to add in an icing recipe, considering as a first-timer, I didn't know that icing was really a cinnamon roll "requirement".  Otherwise, they're very good!

Well, these live up to their name, they do take almost exactly 90 minutes - start to finish.  That being said I feel there is too much filling, I know it's supposed to be gooey but for us it's just too much brown sugar, butter, cinnamon flavor.  The dough had almost a raw taste to it but it was cooked completely through.  I'm not sure I'll waste the ingredients by making this again, Id rather just do the real rise type of cinnamon rolls, using my bread machine.

Very easy and simple!  I buttered the bottom of a casserole dish and then placed mines in the bottom.  They turned out really buttery and caramelized on the bottom.

Best Recipe I've ever come across.  They came out beautifully, and I have tried several different recipes.  This was by far the easiest one with perfect delicious results.  The dough was so soft and tasty.  I just can't say enough about this recipe.  I can't believe it....dough that actually rised for me.

These Cinnamon rolls are just PERFECT!! This is the first time I write a response but I had too..Yummy! I did do them in a pan as others suggested and that worked out well, but with a little bit extra time (30-35 min).

Absolutely fantastic!  Has to be the easiest and best cinnamon rolls i've ever made.  Made them in muffin tins and baked them for 17 minutes instead of the 20 as they were turning brown.  Ended up so soft and squidgy, like cinnabons!  Used chopped walnuts instead of raisins and topped it off with the cream cheese icing as suggested by MPCHARVAT in the first review.  Excellent and definitely a keeper!

This was the first time I made cinnamon buns and it was DA BOMB!  This recipe was so easy, but I think I messed up somewhere along the way because the rolls didn't stay as... rolls.  They expanded somehow, but they were delicious regardless!  They were still swirly, but didn't keep together as they were supposed to.  Hm.  They were good with or without the icing.  The only change I made was baking them on a 9x13 inch pan, as was suggested and they were fabulous~  I would definitely make these cinnamon rolls again!

Very very good! They were chewy and delicious! I put them in a 9*13 pan and they turned out wonderful! I did mix some extra brown sugar and butter together and poured on top just before baking. One other thing I did a little differently was to mix the yeast and warm water together before mixing with the flour, sugar and salt, just to make sure the yeast was active.

This is the first time I have ever made cinnamon rolls from scratch. I was sooo excited. These came out so soft, fluffy and delicious. I made cinnamon cream cheese frosting to top it off. I can't wait to have another one with coffee in the am. Whats wonderful recipe!! Thank you!

These are really good and definitely a keeper. The recipe is good as written and very easy to follow. I do think that they had just a bit too much sugar/butter filling which made them so sweet everyone only ate one small cinnamon roll. We also made cream cheese frosting which is tasty but completely unnecessary. I think the rolls are better without any icing.

Wow! The dough for these cinnamon rolls is PERFECT. Soft, lightly sweetened, easy to knead, fluffy. It was my first time working with bread dough/yeast and it was easy for a beginner.   I knew I wanted to make them a bit more special, though, so I used the caramelized pecan topping from "Overnight Caramel Pecan Rolls" from this site, but other than that, I did not change a thing.  One note, though: I put these in the oven at 375 F, hopped in the shower, and when I got out of the shower, I could already smell a hint of burning. I rushed to the kitchen and checked on the rolls and they were already done after 12 minutes! Next time, I'll either lower the baking temperature or just take them out early. Thank goodness they weren't actually burnt - these were delicious.  Note - they did take me 2 hours to make (not counting baking time). I don't think that's all just because I'm slow!

Wonderful recipe! If I could rate this 10 stars I would! The only things I changed were I used soy milk instead of regular and I added more brown sugar to the raisin sugar mix. They came out beautiful and delicious! What more could one want!?

SO GOOD! i made this to impress my friends, and i followed the recipe exactly, and these came out superb.  the only complaint i have is that they didn't hold very well (the center kept falling out when i picked them up) and they became kind of messy when they baked, but they were still delicious.  i recommend eating them in a hot tub :)

OMG! To think I was scared to make cinnamon rolls. I seriously thought it was going to be harder than I expected. I dumped all the ingredients into my bread machine on dough cycle. I didn't place in muffin cups, instead I did the traditional method and greased a 9x13 pan and placed 12 rolls in there. I let rise and then baked for 15 minutes, now as for the frosting, I used clone of cinnabon frosting recipe. OMG I ate two of these in one sitting.

I used 1 egg plus one egg yolk  I used milk instead of the  1/4 cup water I added 3/4 T cinnamon to the dough ,  And a simple glaze butter conf sugar vanilla and a little milk,  Very easy, raises nicely and just yummy according to the crew around here.

EXCELLANT recipe, EASY, Quick and delicious! Followed the recipe exactly the first time and for our taste the filling was alittle too sweet so the next time I made them I omitted the raisins and I cut back on the BROWN sugar and used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and  1/2 cup of WHITE sugar, instead of all brown sugar! And they were perfect for our taste!

this recipe was great. the rolls turned out perfect. they did rise quite a bit and i had to put a pan in the oven to catch the cinnamon filling. they were soft and gooey. will be making again soon.

These are the BEST in the world!  For years I have tried to master the cinnamon roll!  But always to fall short- you see they weren't like the cinnamon rolls my husband and I remembered in junior high.  They were the ones I have always tried to duplicate.  Well the first time I tried this recipe, my husband wasn't home until after I left to bring them to a potluck.  Well when I came home my husband put up a sign on the door that said, "YOU ARE THE CINNAMON ROLL QUEEN!"  I still have that sign because it is on the back of this recipe!  My family loves these!  I did everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  The secret is to knead in the mixer and you want the dough to be in the shape of a full water balloon. I omitted the raisins and made a cream cheese icing to put on after baking.

Ok, I don't understand the other reviews that said these were not as good as the recipes that took a longer time to prepare. These were awesome. I am not a baker and this is my first time using anything with yeast and mine came out so good. They taste very similar to the Cinnabons in the mall. I have a few suggestions for others that are new like me to baking breads and rolling things. Watch the video on here about making the cinnamon rolls so you can see how they get a nice tight roll and there little tricks. I did use extra filling as one other reviewer suggested and I think that is a great idea! I used a basic cream cheese icing with them. Other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. I will definitely make these again.

I was worried they wouldn't rise well since the recipe doesn't specifically proof the yeast, so I let the warm milk and flour mixtures sit together for a bit before I added the egg. I also let the cut rolls sit longer to rise. The dough turned out really great - moist and soft. My filling was good, but a little hard. It was probably because of my own adaptation to spread the margarine on the dough and then sprinkle the sugar/cinn mixture over top. I think the margarine/sugar ratio wasn't quite right. I think if I follow the recipe more closely next time I'll be fine. Thanks for the recipe!

I have just baked them. These are my first cinnamon rolls- but this is something! In my native country there was a small cafeteria where flat cinnamon rolls are sold, one of my favs. Couldn't find them here in Mauritius! and now I got them! hanks a lot! it was very easy and tasty! PS: I think you also can add some nuts, will add some additional great taste !

I think the cinnamon rolls that take longer to make come out much better than these BUT for the short time they take to make them these are pretty good. I would make them again if time was an issue.

I made these cinnamon rolls yesterday.  I personally thought they were doughy, but my family loved them..next time I will let them rise a little longer and take previous advice to put flour in the filling for it not to overflow.  I added a half of cup of sugar to the dough and almost a full tablespoon of salt to make sure the dough is tasty as well. overall they were pretty good and fast.  I will make again. Thanks

Excellent recipe.  I put icing on them and they were even more decadent.  I used to make the Cinnabon knock-offs, but these are just as good and waaaaay more easy.  I also put them in a baking disk.  I think they come out nicer that way.  I will be making these again soon.

I have loosely followed the recipe and really liked my results. I didn't have milk, so I used 2 tsp. powdered milk as a substitute and used water. I also used bread flour and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose flour. The addition of orange zest made these really special. Thanks for the recipe, I highly enjoyed it with my changes, but I know it would have been delicious if I had followed the original recipe.

Should I say SUPER YUMMMMMMMIEEEE!!!!! This is my first time making Cinamon Rolls and they turn out just Perfect. My Husband, my kids and I end up licking our fingers. I made some small changes, I put all the ingridients in the bread machine on the dough setting and let the machine do all the work mixing and proofing; it took longer but it helped me out a lot, and I fallowed one of the reviews tips and rolled the dough more, also I mixed white sugar with the brown sugar and about a 1/2 teaspoon corn syrup. they came out very big and super delicious. Yummm Yumm YUMM! thank you

These were very good, the way I made them I would consider it a 4 start recipe but I changed it up a bit so it's only fair to give it a 5 because I think recipe as is would have been a 5.    I made it in a round pan and I think it didn't give them enough room.  I had a difficult time getting them to cook in the center.  Outside ones were very good but the inside ones were doughy and the filling was liquidy.    I will try again because they tasted great but I would try on a cookie sheet or in muffin pans as listed.    I would also use less butter because it made the filling run out of the rolls and added to the gooeyness.  The taste was great and the dough was easy to make for someone who doesn't make dough that needs to rise.

These are delicious! I made them in a glass baking dish. The sugar mixture crystallized at the bottom of the pan, I'm not sure why. That would be my only minor complaint. But otherwise, these are amazing. I added a cream cheese frosting and did not find them too sweet. Perfect!  Has anyone tried preparing these the night before or freezing them beforehand? Just curious...

These were delicious for the amount of time they took-- and they were all ingredients I had on hand, so I could make them on a whim in the height of this snowstorm!     I substituted butter for margarine-- very delicious but it all melted down to the bottom of the rolls-- don't know if that would have happened with margarine.  I cooked some squished together in a pie plate and some in muffin tins as suggested... I liked the muffin tin ones better, surprisingly... you just have to get them out of the oven a little early.  These would have been perfect with cream cheese frosting!

it was easy, and we both liked how it had more of a "bread" feel than the usual gooey ones found in stores.  Thanks a bunch!

I made these the other day and was a little bit scared because they didn't rise at all before cooking but I decided to put them in anyway and they did end up rising, these turned out good, my husband loved them and I thought they were just ok, but I am picky! :)

I've never made cinnamon rolls before as the whole idea of yeast usually scares me. These were SOOO easy! And they turned out absolutely delicious. They were instantly devoured and are frequently requested in our house! Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

Very good and fast for a risen dough.  Texture was bread-like.  I topped them with cream cheese, butter, sugar and fresh vanilla bean icing.  They were delicious!

I made these rolls last night, my son ate 3 of them.  These were easy, almost too easy!  I made only one change to the dough recipe.. I substituted almond milk for regular milk. We like ooey gooey rolls, so I melted a topping of 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream while the rolls were proofing.  I poured the topping over the rolls and baked for about 18 minutes.  This made the rolls very decadent!   I would recommend using a pan instead of a muffin tins.  Also, make sure you use a pan underneath to catch the overflow.. and they will overflow!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is crazy - a 5-star cinnamon roll that even *I* can make!  Thought maybe I had screwed it up when it didn't rise much during 30 minutes.  But once in the oven, they rose perfectly for the 9x13 pan.  I do agree that - if you like to add frosting (and who doesn't?) - you might cut down on the brown sugar mixture.  I'll make the adjustment in my next batch.  And the way the pan is emptying, I'd better get started on that 2nd batch right now!  Thanks for such an easy recipe for something I am so proud to serve!

It came out great! this was my first experience with cinnamon rolls and it worked. It was a bit messy when i had to roll it because of the margarine/brown sugar mix but all in all, good recipe. my sister ate twice and my dad even tried it (which is a first on both parts). also added cream cheese frosting which made them delicious. good work!

Tasted great, (my oven is a piece of junk though and burned the top a bit). Made them in the 9x11 dish. Use the other review for the cream cheese icing and it was great. Might pour a bit of melted butter w/ sugar over top next time to make more "gooey". Otherwise, it really did take about 90 min. maybe a bit more.

Very good!  Soft and yummy but best when warm and fresh, of course.  I added cream cheese frosting but I don't think they need it at all.

Good, needs a little tweaking for the baking.  Using the full recipe in the muffin cups made a smoky mess in my oven, and rolls rose too big for the cups.  Very tasty!

Does this recipe really need another review?  I guess so ! ! !  My husband loved this so much (we all did) and said to NEVER make another recipe for cinnamon rolls again.  Followed the recipe.  No deviations.  No problems.  Okay, slight deviation...make this in a 13 x 9 pan for ease of baking and did not have the yeast called for, so I used regular instead.  Always use butter. Fabulous !  Thanks for such a good fool proof recipe.

Quick and delicious.  I everyone loved these, especially the ones that were a little doughy.  I added thinly sliced apple on top of the dough before I rolled it to make an even better treat.

Great recipe!  Tender, chewy, and delicious!  Easy to follow recipe and quick to put together.  One IMPORTNANT suggestion..  Put a pan under the muffin tin to catch the butter and sugar drippings!!  I made quite a mess!

Simply AWESOME!!...My 5 1/2 yr old son LOVED these.The only changes I made was, instead of using margarine, I used butter,and did not mix it with the cinnamon and sugar. I smeared the softened butter over the dough,then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the butter. I also rolled it out to about a 15x11 inch rectangle. That made 16 cinnamon rolls.This recipe is definitely a keeper for my family.

PHENOMENAL CINNAMON ROLL RECIPE!!!!!!!  THANK YOU, GoofyDebbie!  :-)  I have been looking for a recipe for cinnamon rolls for two years, and THIS is it!  I will never go back to those inferior recipes that turn out such hard rolls.  These make moist, gooey rolls, and they are so easy to make.  Following the recommendations in other reviews, I baked them together in a 9 x 13 pan instead of individually in the muffin tin.  After baking I spread a thin layer of sugar icing: 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and just enough milk for the consistency you want.  Absolutely fantastic cinnamon rolls.  I've got some yummy in my tummy!

OMG. These are awesome, better than Cinnabons! They puffed up nice and mine were done just before 20 minutes. Watch them carefully the last few minutes of baking. They were very messy and gooey to make, but delicious when done! I baked mine in a glass 13x9 dish. I used the icing from Cinnamon Rolls II and it was great. Like... almost too good :D

Very good, pretty easy too! Our only complaint, too sweet...will reduce the sugar in the filling a smidge next time :) Also, we tried a cream cheese frosting which we thought overpowered the taste of the cinnamon roll, switch to a light glaze...much better! thanks =)

This is one of the best recipes I have tried for cinnamon rolls. I make the rolls just like the recipe but bake them in a 13x9 pan. While still warm I frost them with a thin icing of powdered sugar, water and vanilla. They are delicious and disappear quickly!

BEST. CINNAMON. ROLLS. EVER!!! WOW -these were just great!  I did use fresh buttermilk that I had on hand and used 75% butter and 25% shortening.  I baked them in a small glass baking pan and frosted them with some cream cheese frosting.  These went super quickly at my house!

These were very good...only reason for 4 stars is the bottoms of them were slightly firm and crusty from the brown sugar mixture melting out of the bottom...I will try them again

this isn't the best cinnamon bun i've had, but considering they only take 90 minutes i'm impressed with how they turned out.  they were good warm, but once they cooled down i made cream cheese icing for the ones that were left.  yummy!

OMG the rolls came out great! Although the dough was hard to work with, they came out great! I added the cream cheese topping and they are a great substitute to Cinnabon!!! will make again,  maybe even tomorrow!

I used this recipe as my first attempt at cinnamon buns, and they were a huge hit! I put the buns into a prewarmed oven for 30 minutes to help them rise and they came out huge! I had brought the buns to a potluck bbq, and one of the guests (a self-proclaimed cinnamon bun connoisseur) stated that these were the best she had ever tasted! Thanks for this EASY recipe!

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls. They are very hard to make and mine looked very messy, but they tasted fantastic. I didn't bake them in muffin tins because it would have been even more messy so I did it in a 10x13 inch dish. After making them this morning, I only have 3 left! Although very unhealthy and buttery, they are VERY VERY delicious.

These are well worth the time it takes to make them.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully.  I didn't add any frosting and I can't say that we missed it.  They were perfect plain.  They rise up beautifully and are really gooey, but a perfect balance of chewy outside & gooey inside.  I've made these twice, both successfully.  I didn't use a muffin pan the second time around since they ended up rising too much and exploded out of the wells.  I used a baking dish the second time around and that worked out much better.

This is the only cinnamon roll recipe I've tried so far cos it's so easy to make! However, is it only me who finds the dough a little too soft to handle? I have difficulty transferring the cut rolls from mat to tray!

this was a good recipe, although I took off 1/2 cup of flour, and put the same amount of brown sugar in the dough than in the filling. Will also add vanilla icing, and not cream cheese. Mmm mmm good!

First time making cinnamon buns ever and they turned out great.  The only issue I had was probably more my mistake then the recipes mistake...the pan overflowed with cinnamon/sugary goodness and burnt onto the bottom of the oven.  It was more caramelly then I'm used to, which I liked, but it made a huge mess.  I will probably use less margarine next time.

This is the best small quantity dough recipe I have found. A couple of things to keep in mind: Know your weather and oven. Our dough yesterday was mixed in a Kitchenaid Mixer and needed only 6 cups of flour. And that was plenty. Flour amounts can change with the humidity. Also keep in mind all ovens are different. For the filling I simply brushed the dough with melted butter, sprinkled some brown sugar to cover and sprinkled cinnamon. Then I rolled the mixture a bit to seal it on the dough.. Also baked this in a 9x13 pan in a convection oven at 350 for about 13 minutes. Then glazed the top a bit when still warm. Excellent buns!

This was my first time making cinammon rolls, they were easy to make and they came out "perfctly delicious" my family loved them. They were moist, fluffy, and sweet.  I will definitely make this again as often as possible.

There was a little something missing from the dough (salt or sugar maybe.) but overall a very good recipe. The filling was great and makes up for the lack of "something" in the dough. Worth trying!

Delicious ! I replaced the egg to veganize the recipe, and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon in the dough out of pure greed. I must practice my rolling abilities, i placed all the rolls on a baking tray (with a sheet of paper) and part of the filling fled from them. Next time i'll use a dish.

These turned out very well. I'm not sure if there's a difference between 'instant' yeast and 'quick acting' yeast, but I used the quick acting kind and it took more than 30 minutes for the rolls to rise. More like 4 hours. But they were worth the wait. Will make again.

These were just scrumptious!  I also made them in a 9x13 pan and iced them with cream cheese icing.  Next time I would definitely turn the rolls out onto a platter upon removing them from the oven.  We lost some of the yummy filling when it stuck to the bottom of the pan. My kids raved that these were the best cinnamon rolls they had ever tasted!

I veganized this recipe and also made it a bit healthier. I substituted the egg with two tablespoons of applesauce, and I also used soymilk instead of milk. I substituted some of the flour for white whole wheat flour, and used shortening instead of butter. It turned out delicious!

Fabulous recipe!  I let my dough rise a little in the pan before I baked them, and it seemed to add the fluffiness.  I also just spread the butter on the dough after rolling, combined the sugar and cinnamon, and then sprinkled on top. Since my husband wanted something close to cinnabon, I doubled the amount of sugar and cinnamon used here, and whatever didn't get sprinkled in the rolls got sprinkled on top. Everyone thought these were delicious!

This cinnamon rolls was quick and delicious. The only thing it is missing is a glaze on top. I mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar and covered each one. They came out gooey and delicious!

These were really good, took me between 90 and 120 min. and rose beautifully. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I thought there was a little too much butter in the cinnamon sugar center. However, it maybe that it was because I did use butter, not margarine as called for. Other than that followed the recipe. Bread part of it was GREAT!

Wow!!  These were great!  So easy to put together. I did put mine in a  cake pan to bake.  They came out very tasty but my filling ran to the bottom of the rolls. So, I just flipped the pan onto a serving platter and let it run back over the rolls.  Maybe using the muffin tin helps stop this.  I can't wait to make this again.  It was a big hit.

Loved these rolls.  They were so easy.  I did bake in 13x9.  You can't go wrong with this much brown sugar and butter! Yum!!!  I drizzled with powdered sugar and milk, the cream cheese frosting would have been over the top for us.

These were easy to make, and "okay". But we weren't too crazy about the huge amount of filling. In the future, I will  do my usual filling of sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of brown sugar. I will use this recipe when I want a quicker cinnamon roll. Otherwise, we much prefer our family recipe of Potato Cinnamon Buns. Also, I baked them in a 9 x 13 pan, rather than the muffin pan. Just seemed easier for me to stick to my usual method.

VERY GOOD!!!! Chewy yet soft. I put the icing on while hot so it would melt....they were yummmmmmy! Although I would say to make them the day you plan on eating them. Best served warm. I baked them the night before and we had to micro them for about 10secs to make them warm a little. otherwise??? A perfect connamon roll!!!

I made this on the weekend but I have no idea how they taste as I gave up flour for Lent, but they were gone before the weekend was done so I am going to say they were a hit. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe and I don't think I'd use another when I want to make good, basic cinnamon rolls.  I absolutely love the dough - it's light and sweet and would make very nice french toast from loaf form.  Thanks!

I've never made home made cinnamon rolls before.  These were so easy & so yummy.  I loved that I didn't have to use a bread machine.   I made these the night before & put them in the fridge overnight then baked them in the morning - delicious!  I made a batch for my husband to take to work - they raved about them!

The first time I made this yummy rolls, I made it exactly as written. LOVED IT!!But the second time, I wanted to try low fat so I subbed the margarine in the dough to applesauce and the margarine in the filling to honey. It tasted pretty good for low fat, but I like the original way better! I guess I'll have low fat, that is "if" I have to :p

The only thing i would recommend in doing is not baking the rolls in a muffin pan. They will overflow and drip. Otherwise they were excellent and my family loved them! I'm still learning and these were doable for me.

I have terrible luck with bread but these turned out perfectly. Easy and so delicious! Following the advice of others, I too used the icing from the clone of cinnabon and used a 13x9 pan.  I put crushed nuts on half of them before I rolled the dough. Highly recommend.

Excellent! Next time I will make sure the kitchen is warm enough so that the rolls rise in the 30 minutes. I think the slow rise (1.5 hrs.) caused the filling to fall out of the dough and baked on the bottom of the pan. My mistake, the recipe is great.

They were great!  Thanks for an authentic but fast and easy way to make cinnamon rolls.  Loved them and loved that they don't require a breadmachine or overnight rising!  Will definately make again.  BTW, I topped them with the cinnabon clone frosting-yummy!

I thought the dough part of the rolls was quite good, but the filling sort of "crackle-ized" on top of the rolls, so they had a crunchy glaze.  I was hoping for something gooey.  Don't know if I did something wrong, but these weren't what I was looking for.

Our family is allergic to cows milk so I used the soft goat chevre which is similar to cream cheese.  This worked great! I also added the nutmeg and oregano that was recommended by others which added to flavor.  I added a little cream sherry (1 tsp) since the goat cheese is not as sweet as cow's milk cream cheese.  Love the recipe. Thank you!

I think I may have cooked these a tad too long at 20mins, but slathered in vanilla glaze (found on this site)no one could tell they were just a bit too brown. This was my second time making cinnamon rolls. This recipe was far easier and the results came out far better.

Wow!  I am SOOOO glad I tried this recipe!!  I have been making the "clone" off of this site, but have never really been completely satisfied with that recipe (although, my son would disagree!).  These were just what I wanted--soft and light.  I made them exactly as directed, although I did need a little more flour than the recipe called for. Plus, they don't take nearly as long as the other recipes.  Thank you a hundred times over for this one!!

This is a the best and easiest cinnamon roll recipe I've tried as of yet.  These were what I was looking for, the big, fluffy, yeasty cinnamon rolls I remembered from childhood.  Compared to many sweet roll recipes this one was a snap.  I put an ordinary sugar glaze on them and my husband absolutely raved.

Sickly, sticky sweet!  But what are cinnamon rolls without the sugar?  It was the first time I made those and this was a great desert although I won't make it often since it's badddd for the waistline.  Just make the rolls, let rise while you're having dinner, pop into the oven and twenty minutes later you have fresh-baked delicious little rolls that everyone will enjoy.  I ate three and now I wanna puke - they're just way too good!

So delicious.  Definitely turn buns over once cool enough to handle so cinnamon filling can drip back through the entire bun...makes a huge difference in end result.  

I also made a sugar icing and drizzled over the top.  Couldn't even get a picture before half of them were gone!!!

Wow!  That was a rewarding project and I would highly recommend these rolls as a Sat morning activity with your kids.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't put them in muffin pans, just a normal rectangular dish.  They began to rise and burst over the edges of the pan, again, kids would probably love making these with the help of an adult.  I did add a cream cheese frosting at the end which was worth it, they look fantastic and taste just as good!  My experience is that one package of a light cream cheese, with a splash of vanilla and adding powdered sugar to taste is perfect (and healthier than 2 c. of sugar plus butter.)  Oh, last thing, I found the short video on 'all recipes' showing how to prepare the rolls very useful, I would highly recommend it!  Happy baking!

The recipe was easy to make, but no one really liked how it turned out.  I was really disappointed on how it tasted...or the lack of taste.

I thought they were really good for a fast cinnamon roll. My family didn't complain, but no rave reviews. I think they would be a lot better if baked at 350 degrees. They were a little dry.

These were excellent, moist and delicious, i have no idea how this could be dry.  I made half the recipe and the only change was i added 1/2t of vanilla.  I also made the frosting from clone of a cinnabun, to me that recipe is a 10, this one is a 9.5.  so easy and so freaking good yumm-o

This was THE BEST Cinnamon Roll recipe I have found yet.  It did take me a little longer than 90 min., but that was probably just me.  I tried the cream cheese frosting from one of the other reviewers, and it was just wonderful!!!

This is an awesome recipe.The only thing I do differently is I seal the edge with water instead of pinching. Also I place them on a cookie sheet and let them rise until they are just touching before I bake them.
This is absolutly the best I've ever made !_!

My son said "This is the best tasting thing I've had in long time."  They were easy to make, I used my Kitchenaid instead of hand kneading.  They are very messy so definetly use something to catch the overflow.  I also used a simple icing recipe of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3 Tablespooons milk. Yum

This made my entire apartment smell heavenly! It was pretty quick, and tasted good. It may have been my fault and not the recipe's but the dough was very dense. I skip any frosting because it would be way too sweet that way.

This was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls and these were AMAZING!!! Not only because they were fast and low maintence, they were so good. Anyone worried about finding an excellent cinnamon roll recipe should be sorry they haven't found this one. Used a 9x13 and frosted with cream cheese icing. Mmm!

Yummy pretty much sums it up. Recipe was very easy to follow and carry out. I did add 1tsp more cinnamon though cause I didn't think it smelled cinnamony enough, and placed them in an 11x9 pan. Great texture and flavor, will defiantly make again. I did bake them in a pan and just used thread to cut them into rounds and had no trouble with bubble over. Thanks
.

For those having problems - if your dough does not rise, there was a problem with your yeast or liquid temperature and if your dough is sticky, add more flour - baking is a mixture of art and science and sometimes you need more flour and sometimes you need less.

these were good! Made a homemade orange icing to glaze them with. Didnt put in muffin pan, but used a 9x13. I may continue my search for a better cinnamon roll, but am keeping the recipe and may use again!

These are awesome!  I made them for two separate parties and everybody loved them.  They're good even without icing (without being too sweet), but if you like decadence and rich sugar overloads try them with some cream cheese icing.

This was a good recipe to learn how to make the rolls, but I'll make some changes in the future. It was my first roll, so I stuck to the recipe. Husband loved them, but to me, they were lacking sweetness (weird, I know). They tasted more like bread than gooey cinna rolls. Next time I'll chill the rolled dough before cutting (it was a mess!!). I'll also add nuts before rolling. These can't be eaten without icing (not part of recipe), and I made the cream cheese icing from another post, which turned out too buttery -- needed more powdered sugar.  I too made them as one in a 9x12 pan instead of muffin tins, which was good, but ended up cooking too long and kinda hard on top and bottom.  Good base recipe with a few tweaks.

In reality, this took longer than 90 minutes to prep, mix, raise and bake.  Good buns!  Not sure I like baking them in the muffin tin.  I think I prefer just baking in a pan.

Super easy!!!!
Regarding the muffin tins, instead of making 12 rolls, I made 24. Once I started to put the dough in the muffin tins, I noticed they were practically full already, and needed to double and bake. Then I read reviews that some of the filling had overflowed on some cooks, or pooled at the bottom. So, I cut each roll in half vertically and just pinched the edges--same thickness, just smaller diameter. After rising and baking, I had 24 beautiful muffin-sized rolls with no overflow and VERY minimal filling at the bottom of the tins. 
Very nice presentation.

Great recipe! Easy to make. Dough is easy to work with. I bake them in a 9"x11" glass pan until golden brown on top.  Be sure and put a cookies sheet under them as they sometimes bubble over in the oven.  I use the Glaze part of the Crispy and Creamy Donut recipe from this site and pour all over the top as soon as it comes out of the oven. They stay warm for hours! YUMMY!!!

These cinnamon rolls taste pretty much like pain de leche, or 'milk bread'. This kind of bread is very flexible, and can even be made without the cinnamon, as bread buns. If you like, you could even brush on some egg mix to brown the bun tops. Warning: *These rolls are quite large, one or two could make you full*.

I tried these a few months ago, and it was my first time making cinnamon rolls. They turned out great, everyone loved them!! They took me longer than 90 min, but it was probably because I'm not a baker. I also added more filling than called for.

Loved em'.. The only thing I changed was putting them on an ungreased cookie sheet about an inch apart and not putting the rolls in muffin cups.

I make these all the time and they always disappear in minutes! They are delicious but I shudder to think of the muffin tin clean up, so I make then in a normal pan.

These are the best!  Very easy to make, quick, and we love them.  The bread is soft and moist with wonderful flavor and the cinnamon filling is just right!  These cinnamon rolls are delicious with or without icing...depending on your mood.

Amazing!!! I made a little extra filling, which was great but make sure to put a pan underneath to catch the drippings!!!!  Added a slight bit of frosting but they didnt really need it.  Will definitely make again!

EXCELLENT! I baked them on a parchment lined cookie sheet just slightly touching.  Remember to pinch the seam to seal or they unroll a little. But no biggie.

They took forever to make but it was worth it.  I used whole wheat flour which made them "meatier".  Also I used the cream cheese icing from this site with it.  SUPER!

These were wonderful and easy.  I did decrease the butter inside the cinnamon rolls a bit and put them in a 9X13 pan.  Drizzled with powdered sugar glaze.  Fantastic.

I ended up having to make these with whole wheat flour and Splenda because of a] lack of white flour and sugar in the house and b] a diabetic mother, for whom I was originally making these... but they still turned out wonderfully. =) And actually only took 90 minutes!

My only problem with this recipe is that the icing was spilling out the side when I attempted to cut them. Very hard to actually cut them with that, and t ended up leaving a pile of it on my kitchen counter. >=[

It was really fast to make and the taste was perfect. I did the pan way instead of muffin pan, it took the same time cooking for me. The only thing I am going to do different is to half the filling next time. It was a bit too sweet for me personally.

UPDATE: Wow! Still delicious, this time I used butter. Hubba hubba. 12/25/2007 Awesome!!! I couldn't figure out how to use my hand-me-down bread machine, so I made these last minute Christmas morning with a cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved them at the Christmas brunch I attended. I saw these were the recipe of the day when I logged back on, I'm eatting one right now!!

These are absolutely AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly, only I cooked them in a 13x9 baking dish with a little parchment paper under them. I took the advice of some others and cut them with dental floss. This is so simple and the results are fantastic...I can't stop eating them !! I did make up an icing of powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk, but if you don't have a big sweet tooth, they  are perfect as is !

These were great...I changed the recipe by letting the dough rise twice (once after kneading and then once again after I shaped them into rolls) I did add pecan pieces to the center cinnamon mixture.  I also just put them in a 9x13 parchment paper  glass pan.  They did burn a little so I reduce the heat to 325, but my oven cooks hot so It could be that.  The dough itself turned out very light and airy...I topped the rolls with homemade cream cheese frosting and they are perfectly gooy! great recipe.

These were great.  I allowed my daughter and neice to make these and they loved them.  We did leave ours to rise again while we went swimming.  Great recipe to use with my girls and they didn't make it to the next day.

These were 'fantabulous'. So quick and easy. I used the suggestion of others and made a cream cheese icing. My husband is a cinamom roll junkie and needless to say, he thoroughly enjoyed them. I forsee making these again, and again, and again.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls, and they came out AWESOME.  Im so proud. The hardest part was rolling up the dough with all the filling, a bunch fell out and i got a hole in the dough and it started oozing out.. but other then that it was fine. They came out perfect and oh so pretty.  I used floss to cut mine too, works great and fun too.  I made a glaze topping for mine, just made it up, it tasted real good on it.

just put a half a cup of milk in a pot, heated it and added some margarine, about 2 tblspoons then put powdered sugar until it was the right consistancy.  probably about 1.5-2 cups.  

YUM YUM YUM.

Way better than I expected. I think that I may have let them rise too much, but I definitely got no complaints.

I thought these rolls were really good.  It took me longer than 90 minutes to make, but they were worth the wait.  The only problem I had was that a lot of the cinnamon filling oozed out during the baking, but we just scooped it onto the rolls.  They were very light and not overly sweet.  I added a cream cheese frosting to them.

I made these for a school function and they were a big hit! The only thing I changed was I made more filling to make them extra gooey.

so easy to make and so yummy, too. the icing recipe makes these rolls complete. i baked in round cake pans and i saw them rise more during the baking process than when i let them rise previous to baking, so look out, they get big! family and friends LOVE this recipe.

I think the cinnamon filling itself is dry. The sugar did not melt in the oven so when I took a bite onto it it was kinda "crunchy". I followed the instruction to the last letter that's why I'm wondering what have I done wrong since all the other reviews didn't seem to think so. Anyway, this one is good enough and with the time total to bake, it's definitely a recipe keeper.

Tried this recipe for first time at weekend and it was FABULOUS! My husband thought it was the best cinnamon roll he'd ever had! Top marks! Made a glaze up as I went along to drizzle over the top and it worked really well! 1 tbsp syrup, 1 tbsp milk, 1 oz soft cheese, icing sugar! Lovely recipe thanks!

Awesome! These rolls are super moist and delicious. The only thing I did differently was I put the rolls in a spring form pan and just before baking I crushed some pecans and mixed them with maple syrup and added some to the top of each roll. Yum Yum.

I love this recipe! I use it as a base and always expand on it. I add nuts and nutmeg I never measure the spices I add to taste and then I frost with cream cheese icing! YUM! I have even left out raisins and added chocolate chips before. ALWAYS a Hit!

This recipe is alright. I think there are better cinnamon roll recipes out there. I had a real tough time trying to roll the dough with the sugary spread in it.. most of it oozed out the ends. Instead of a muffin tin I put them in a pan, I think thats the solution if you don't want "muffin" cinnamon rolls. I topped mine with a cream cheese frosting. I probably won't make them again, but this is a good and easy recipe for those looking to make cinnamon rolls.

This is one of my favorite cinnamon roll recipes. The changes I made was using 1/2 spelt flour instead of all all-purpose flour, and I used dark brown sugar for the filling and I did not include nuts. The end result was super delicious and the pan was clean in no time.

This was a very tasty recipe!  I added some walnuts to the butter/sugar mixture and cooked in a 9 x 12 pan.  I made a cream cheese frosting to go on top, per my husband's request.  My rolls didn't rise very much, but I think this was due to an error of my own.  They were still yummy despite not having risen very much.

It's a great recipe, I even put it in the muffin cups.  Everything turned out like in the picture.  But I will cut down to 1/4 cup butter to spread with the cinnamon mixture.

These were sooooo good.  They were soft, and gooey.  The only problem I had was the filling bubbled up and out of the pan.  But even that didn't take away from how easy and good these are.  To the person who said theirs turned out dry, it's probably because too much flour was used in the dough.

I really didn't like using the muffin pan to bake the rolls. It took a lot of time to cleanup. I would reccomend eating these fresh from the oven. I made them the night before and ate them in the morning and they were pretty dry. I also used the frosing from Cinnamon Rolls III. Overall they were delicious.

These were just okay. I baked them in a 9x13" pan, and while the filling was fantastic and gooey, the dough was dry and lacked flavour. I'll stick with my slightly-altered version of Savory Cinnamon Rolls (also from this site).

LOOK NO FURTHER!! This is the BEST recipe EVER for cinnamon rolls! (and a lot of fun to make too!) My boyfriend absolutely loved them - he immediately ate 4 rolls right out of the oven (I was waiting for him to get sick but he didn't :P) I will deifnately keep this recipe as my secret weapon this holiday season. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I love these rolls!  I make home-made rolls every week for my cafe & these have been a huge hit - rivaling the Amish bakery cinnamon rolls we used to get!  I love the shortened time needed to make these.  I omit the raisins & add about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the cinnamon mixture.  Pair them with White Cake Frosting I by Amy Parsons for a terrific breakfast!

I did not put these in muffin cups as indicated, instead I just placed them on a cookie sheet to bake.  They definitely do not need to bake for 20 minutes... I cooked them for 16 and that was way too long.  Overall, they were pretty good, although I thought they were a little cake-like in texture... might be better if they had not cooked for so long.  They taste was really very good... a lot like Cinnabons if you can find a way to make them not so cake-like.  I also added a cream cheese frosting, which they definitely needed!

This recipe was so easy and so yummy. my whole family loved them, i know i'll be making more very soon. Very delicious the second time around, just reheat in the microwave. Only improvisation i made: i liquified the brown sugar with a bit of water in the microwave because my brown sugar had gone rock solid. Still turned out great!

These weren't bad at all for being 90-minute rolls.  I do prefer a different kind of roll, but I would definitely make these again if I needed something quick.  I didn't have milk so I used 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/4 cup of water to make up the required 3/4 cup of milk.   I also took a previous person's recommendation to make the glaze from the Overnight Cinnamon Rolls I.  That made it really scrumptious.

Very good reciepe although they were not quite as fluffy as the ones I usually make.  Might have been my own flaw though.  Would recommend.

Very tasty, basic recipe.  The neighborhood kids devoured all of them in less than 15 minutes.  You could add cream cheese frosting, but it's not necessary.

These cinnamon rolls are great! They're a little tough to make since the cinnamon filling oozes out when you roll the dough, but oh well. A bit time consuming too, but worth the wait.

This makes a real nice-to-work-with dough, and easy to mix up.  I was glad to be able to make them so quickly, yet I think they could have raised a little longer.  I used the glaze from Overnight Cinnamon Rolls on this site as I think cinnamon rolls need a frosting.  Taste was good but not to die for.

This recipe was good, but could do with a few improvements.  The rolls have a better texture, if most of the sugar mixture is put in the bottom of the pan (like sticky buns.) The addition of nuts adds a dimension to the flavor.

This recipe is so easy and super delicious.  I even made a mistake the first time making them and forgot to let them rise the 30 minutes before I put them in the oven and they still came out perfect.  Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe.  My husband always begs me to make them.

These turned out very good.  Soft and fluffy.  I made an icing for them but it made them a little too sweet.  Next time I will make them without icing.

Oh my gosh these rolls are perfection! I have made them probably about ten times for my family, and they have been gobbled up every time! It really is very simple to make these, and it doesn't take hours and hours to prepare! Thank you so much Debbie for the divine recipe!

These were super-easy to make. I must make one note though. DO NOT USE LOW-CAL MARGERINE!!!! It melted and made the dough hard to roll.... otherwise, perfect recipe.

I bake A LOT and this one was GREAT and easy. With that cream cheese topping, it tasted similar to a cinnabun but when it's homemade and straight out of the oven, these buns were INCREDIBLE!

I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with some "okay" cinnamon rolls. Not as great as some of the reviews, but they are quick. I will give it one more try to be sure I did everything right, but to be honest, they were just okay. The kids liked them.
