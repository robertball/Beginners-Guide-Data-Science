I think it's missing simple syrup? Maybe not plenty of variations, followed the recipe except I added 1 ounce of simple syrup

It's an OK drink, but it's not a vodka gimlet. It's missing the Rose's lime juice.

Great classic UNSWEETENED Gimlet, BUT a typical Gimlet you will find in most bars will use something to sweeten. Personally I used 1 1/2 oz of Vodka or Gin (or one jigger), 1 1/2 oz of sweetened lime juice, and 1/2 oz of simple syrup garnished with lime wheels.

I liked it although I think many people would find it too tart. I didn't have any ice cubes so I threw in some frozen pineapple but that did not sweeten it much. Tasty though!
