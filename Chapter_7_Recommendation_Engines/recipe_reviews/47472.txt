Throw everything into a crock pot. That's what I did and it came out wonderful.  The only only only difference is that I used 6 cups of chicken stock vs the 4 cups water and 2 bouillon cubes and 2 cups of shredded cabbage.  We came home to delicious hearty soup thick soup.  P.S I didn't even saute anything ahead of time.

I used turkey smoked sausage and didn't have head cabbage, but used a portion of a bag of 3-color slaw I had (which is mostly shredded cabbage anyway). I used half the cayenne and it was still plenty spicy for my taste and petite diced tomatoes. Hearty, good soup...I will make this again.

Yummy!  We varied this a bit, though.  We used 4 cups of chicken stock, Healthy Choice smoked sausage, and cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp.  Great soup for a chilly winter day and so easy to make!

I've looked for a favorite lentil soup recipe for years and this is it! I use 4 Boca Smoked Sausages browned in a little oil and thinly sliced, and I add a little more cabbage. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe to use as a guide; easy to customize. A keeper! I suggest eliminating the boullion cubes. Use instead 4 cups of broth as a substitute for the cubes and water... it works wonderfully. If you don't care about it being vegetarian, I suggest using (Mexican) chorizo sausage in place of vegetarian "sausage" (another hideously artifical invention). Chorizo worked great (cook it first and add at the end) and made it super spicy! If you want vegetarian soup, add an extra cup of onion for body and leave out the veggie sausage.

WOW!!!! This might be my new favorite soup! It's a toss up between Italian Sausage Soup and this one. My soup hating husband even said he'd try it next time I made it because it smelled so good! The only change I made was to use kielbasa instead of the vegetarian sausage. Delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe, my husband and I loved it. I used a pork garlic sausage instead of a vegetarian one and it was great.I would recomend this one.

This was great soup.  I did make some changes.  I used turkey sausage, added carrots and I didn't have any cabbage so I used brussles sprouts.  Very yummy and quite filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I liked this soup, and my boyfriend loved it.  He said it was as good as the chicken tortilla soup recipe we found on allrecipes and I think that soup is one of the best ever.  Anyways, I made the recipe as is, except for that I added a little sugar to compliment the tomatos.

This is an excellent recipe. It lends itself to many variations (vegetarian/meat sausage and stock/boullion). You can make it as a thick stew or a thinner soup, spicy or not, and can experiment with other ingredients and proportions. I've used kielbasa, smoked sausage, and linguica (precooked). I've used canned or homemade broth and I have used vegetable, turkey, chicken, and beef better-than-boullion. I use more vegetables (up to an entire head of cabbage) than the recipe calls for, and less tomato (I don't buy 16 oz. cans), I've used Pico de Gallo seasoning in it instead of cayenne, and I don't use salt and pepper, preferring to allow the individual to season their own serving. Basically, as long as you add enough liquid to cook the lentils, it's hard to go wrong.  We really love this soup.

I have now tried this twice, once with lentils and once with split peas.  I also used regular smoked sausage. It is OK but I think I will try again without the thyme.  It just doesn't have the right seasoning for me.  I thought it was the lentils, but I think it is the thyme and my taste of course.  Good texture though and I did like the cabbage flavor

This was a very good soup, thank you. I used spicy smoked sausage, lots more garlic, and a combination of kale and collards since I didnâ€™t have cabbage. I also added a bit of hot pepper. The soup was even better the next day.

I thought the cayenne pepper overpowered the soup; I would use half as much if I made this soup again. I would definitely add more cabbage too. I used turkey kielbasa sausage instead of vegetarian, but doubt that altered the taste much. I have made many lentil soups and find this one to be very ordinary, so I am unlikely to make it again.

I made this tonight. I didn't have any cabbage on hand so I used some celery instead.  I also used sun-dried tomato instead of diced tomato.  I omitted the cayenne as I'm cooking for my family with different tastes.  My 6 year old said "This is actually good", after examining it, prodding it with her fork and finally taking a bite.

This was tasty!  However, I did add a 1/4 tsp. of basil and a 1/4 tsp. of oregano in order to quiet the pungent taste of thyme.  I too added shredded Parmesan on top of each bowl of soup once I served it.

Very good.  Used Tofurky vegetarian sausage (which by the way is made w/ real food ingredients and not loaded w/ chemicals).  Topped w/ parmesan cheese. Will make again.  Thanks!

I doubled the lentils and water, and I used a cup of cabbage.  I used one sweet italian chicken sausage and one hot italian chicken sausage that I broiled ahead of time then cut into chunks.  My wife and I loved this and there was enough to feed two of us twice. Plus I froze some for later.

We liked the soup, but next time will use less (if any) cayenne pepper - it was very hot - but we intend to have leftover soup for lunch.  I like the idea of using the veggie sausages, It's a great Lenten dish, no pun intended.

Delicious, restaurant-quality soup.  My husband was astounded by how great this soup tasted, and how little time it took to prepare.  He said that he had a soup like this just the other day at a five-star restaurant that had andouille sausage in it instead.  So next time, I might substitute the turkey sausage that I used for andouille sausage.  Also, if you don't like your food too spicy, I'd say forgo on the cayenne pepper, and just add more garlic.  Great recipe!

This is a very good soup. Like others, I used smoked Kielbasa (1/2 pound for 4 servings). I had never made anything with lentils before and sure appreciate how quickly they cook.  I used only 3 cups of water - we like our soup very thick. Thanks for the post!

I made this for a group of 10.  I also wanted to have enough leftover to last for several days so quadrupled the recipe.  The guests liked it and there was enough left over to last us probably most of the week.  I'm trying to be healthy so we cut the olive oil in half and used low sodium veggie-based soup broth instead of bouillon and "no-salt added diced tomatoes".  I doubled the garlic and cabbage and cut the cayenne pepper to 1/4 of the amount recommended in the recipe.  I thought the soup was still quite spicy, but that could be partially because I used Mexican Chipotle flavored veggie sausage links made by the Field Roast company.  If I had to do it again I would probably cut the amount of Field Roast sausage and increase the lentils, since the crumbled sausage was the dominant flavor and texture.  I also used fresh thyme instead of dried.  I like lots of spices since I use little or no salt when I cook and this soup had lots of good flavor.  I will probably make it again, but try a different flavor of  veggie sausages.

This soup is simply delicious!  To all you non-vegetarians out there, don't be afraid of the soy sausage-- the texture is really smooth, making it the perfect ingredient for soup.  On their own, soy sausages can be hard to love, but here, they're heavenly.  Trust me!

I have made this a couple of times with a few minor changes and have really enjoyed it.  I leave out the onion because I don't like them. Also, I use turkey smoke sausage and extra cabbage, along with 2 extra cups of chicken broth.  Last night I used Rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes to give it a little more spice.  It was really good!

I sautÃ©ed the onion on high, stirring until soft, and then let it soften on low until translucent.  I then added a chopped green pepper, one chopped carrot, and an entire 1-lb bag of lentils with the garlic and a jar of sauerkraut instead of cabbage.  Note that I ran the sauerkraut under cold water first to get rid of the extra saltiness.  I then added 6 cups of water (since I used 2x the lentils) with the bouillon cubes, brought it all to a boil, then reduced it to a simmer for one hour.  Oh, and I added one ham hock instead of the sausage and shredded the meat off of the bone once it was done.

This was delicious! I used turkey kielbasa instead of vegetarian sausage. I only used 14 1/2 oz. diced tomatoes because this is the size of a regular can.

This was a very good soup for a cold day.  I doubled the recipe and put everything in a crock pot for six hours.
Made cornbread and we had a delicious meal on a busy day.

Yummy Vegan soup!  It would have been delicious with Vegan Field Roast Sausages, but I am trying to reduce the salt in my life so I left it out.  Still very yummy.  We didn't shred the cabbage.. just chopped.. 'cause that's how we roll.

I felt obligated to write a review for this. It was really good! I made it two weeks ago and my boyfriend has "mentioned" it 3 or 4 times since so I'm making it again tonight. First time I used turkey sausage; this time we're going to try the tofurkey sausage. I like to use a half a head of cabbage shredded and two cans of tomatoes. I think diced potatoes might be good in it too..

Excellent hearty soup.  I also made a couple changes. I subbed in 6 cups of chicken stock and used a pound of Andouille Sausage.  Really awesome!  I would recommend cutting down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp or  maybe 1/8 or eliminate it altogether.  My wife and I thought the 1/4 was perfect, but it was still a little too much for our spice sensitive children. They ate it, but every bite was followed by a gulp of milk.  ;-)

Wow! Intensely delicious and healthy! I used 2 spicy italian sausages instead, and omitted the cayenne as my husband doesn't do well with really spicy food. Skip the oil - just throw it all in the pot. Lentils burned a bit when I initially cooked them so I gave up on that step, dumped in the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for a while. Came out great! After having a bowl I also decided I liked the tomatoes and there weren't enough in, so I added the rest of my 28oz can. Also used chicken oxo instead of veggie bouillon, and used 6 cups of water instead of 4. I think this was necessary because I used more cabbage than was called for.

Yummy! This came out wonderfully!  I used 1 (14 ounce) smoked sausage, without MSG, gluten or added nitrites. 1.5 cup of cabbage. 2 cubes of vegetable bouillon (I like Rapunzel Vegan with Sea Salt & Herbs because ingredients are organic & non-hydrogenated). 5 cups of water. 2 bay leaves. Everything else is the same as the recipe.

I thought it was good but the kids didn't enjoy it every much, and they normally like lentils. I used smoked turkey sausage instead of vegetarian sausage, and added about 1.5 cups shredded cabbage as I wanted to bulk up the veggie content for the kids.

I recieved this soup in a dinner exchange and just loved it!  It freezes well, and cooks just fine when tossed in the crockpot. I added just 4 cups of chicken broth, but that wasn't enough liquid to make it into a soup.  It was salty enough (though my husband liked it), so next time, I'll probably add another 2 cups of water.   I also cheated and used the coleslaw mix.  Us young mothers have to fake it till we make it. (can't make the stars work: this is a 5 star for sure)

I wasn't sure how I felt about lentils, but I thought this was delicious! Even more surprising- my boyfriend loved it! We doubled the recipe so it would last a couple days (we also froze the leftovers, which held up very well). We are meat eaters, but wanted to try making this vegetarian used Field Roast veggie sausages (found at Whole Foods, recommended to us by our vegetarian friends), which were surprisingly delicious. We used the Mexican Chipotle flavor, which were very spicy, so we halved the cayenne (and we like spice!). The only other change was to add 2-3 times as much cabbage as called for- it's so good for you (and yummy)!. Thanks for a great recipe that will be added to our vegetarian collection.

My family loves this recipe.  I have tweaked it a bit to suit us: turkey sausage instead of vegetarian use chicken broth instead of water/bouillon I use about 2x as much cabbage I use half the cayenne pepper, and add about 1/2 teaspoon of Paprika   Served with homemade cornbread - so yummy!!

Great! So easy and very tasty. I threw everything in the crockpot for a few hours and it turned out awesome. Also used Turkey sausage instead of vegetarian. According to MY taste, it also needed quite a bit of salt. Will definitely make this again.

This is a fast and tasty soup. I didn't have cabbage - which I think would have been really good. Anyway, I added carrots and celery instead. I also used mild Italian sausage. I think it would have been great wity spicy sausage, but my kids would not have eaten it. It's a hearty soup with lots of flavor.

This is a great soup!  I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable bouillon and chicken sausage instead of the vegetarian sausage.  Also cut back on the thyme & cayenne for my taste.  Rave reviews from my husband and even from my daughter who is not usually enthusiastic about lentils.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a fantastic soup that I have been making for a while. I have thrown in celery, chorizo and even used saurkraut instead of the cabbage once. It is an incredibly flexible recipe which will carry off whatever you have lying about in your fridge / pantry. I usually use turkey sausage and have to increase the water quite a bit, otherwise it would come out too thick and stewy. Love it!

I thought this was an excellent recipe with changes I made to fit my tastes.  I tossed out the veggie sausage and used 2 links Hot Italian Sausage & 2 links Mild Italian Sausage.  I also used Tony Chachares cajun seasoning which has cayenne included in it.  I had to let it simmer for an hour before the lentils were done.  I live in high altitude though.  It was spicy, just how I like it.  So if you are sensitive to hot food don't use hot sausage and cut back on cayenne.  Great for the cold temps we've been having.  mmmmm

We didn't have any onions (ran out) or cabbage on hand, so I made this with carrots, celery, and some red bell pepper in their place.  This came out absolutely delicious.  We sprinkled a little grated Romano on top, which made it even better.  I used Andouille chicken sausages.  This was an awesome variation on our usual lentil soup!

I made several modifications, but loved the recipe!  It was very flavorful and very easy.  When I was at the store, I forgot that it called for cabbage.  I had some carrots at home, so I included those instead.  It was GREAT!  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of one (because one clove of garlic in a nice stew is pointless), kielbasa sausage, and low sodium chicken broth.  It didn't need a lot of salt because the sausage provided so much flavor.  You could do so many variations with this, using whatever is on hand.  A keeper!

This was my first time with lentils. I really liked this soup. The  changes I made were that I used 4 cups of vegetable stock instead of the water,turkey smoked sausage (one link), the diced tomatoes that had jalapenos in them and added some fresh corn cut off the cob. I let it simmer on the stove for 2-3 hours. I took the leftovers to work and they all enjoyed it as well. Very good and very filling!

I used 1-16oz bag lentils, onion, celery, carrots, 1 large can diced tomatoes, half cabbage, chicken bullion, 1 Hillshire Farms lite smoked sausage diced, and 9 cups of water. Threw it all in the crock pot on low in the morning and wala, we had an amazing meal when we got home. Comfort food at it's best.

Yummy recipe. I followed another reviwer's advice and din't saute anything (so didn't need the oil) and threw it all in the slow cooker. I used a smoked turkey sausage, because that's what I had. Thanks for a great and healthy post.

One of my favorites. I do, however, make some adjustments:

I use turkey sausage instead. It is helpful to just use cole slaw mix instead of shredding the cabbage. I put in about 2 cups of this.

I like mine spicy, so I add 2 teaspoons of cayenne. Also, I found that there needs to be more water, so I put in about 6 cups.

Love it!

The spices were spot on! In my case I used real andouille sausage rather than vegetarian ones, so I added them right at the beginning with the onions. This is even better if you overcook it a little so that the lentils are falling-apart-tender. The initial stage of frying in olive oil and the addition of cabbage make this soup special. Thanks for the recipe!

I tossed everything but the (turkey) sausage, onions and garlic in the pressure cooker for 20 minutes. Then sautÃ©ed the sausage, onions and garlic and tossed in the mix. Came out great and quick. Served with the country white bread recipe on this site. I did omit the oil put in half broth and was generous on the spices.

Wow!  This was soooo goood.  Is has that robust flavor that you usually don't get until it's been sitting in your fridge overnight.  And it was so EASY!  I love that.  FYI, I used Turkey Sausage and leftover red onion, and then topped of individual bowls with a squeeze of lemon.

Wow- this was fantastic!  I didn't have any cabbage, and subbed healthy choice smoked sausage for the veg sausage, but other than that (and letting the soup simmer for a few hours) I kept to the recipe.  Its even better after it has set for a day or two to develop the flavors. This recipe is a keeper- thanks for sharing!

I really like this soup! I used regular smoked sausage and I also added strips of green pepper and a little less cayenne pepper. I also added 1/4 tsp of oregano and 1/4 tsp of basil. YUMMY! :)

This was a really good starting point. I used 16oz of lentils doubled all the spices and then added some more and when I couldn't get the taste "just right" I used my last resort and dumped in a package of Lipton onion soup mix...and it was perfect.  I also wouldn't add the sausage next time...it really didn't add anything.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a yummy soup. I didn't have tomato can, so I chopped 2 fresh tomato and added like 2-3 spoons of tomamto paste in it. I used turkey sausage too.

Love lentil soup, but this kicks it up a notch!  I doubled+  the lentils and just used the whole 16oz bag, a whole but small head of cabbage, 2 cans of tomatoes and the turkey smoked sausage I had on hand.  Doubled all of the other ingredients.  A wonderful stew, thick and just a perfect heat from the cayenne that you usually don't have in lentil soup.  LOVE IT!

Wonderful flavor (with some of the changes suggested). I used 8 oz. of sliced keilbasa and 6 c. of chicken broth along with 2 c. of shredded cabbage. It was fantastic!!! 
I gave it 4 stars because of the changes made.

Fantastic!! I used 1 lb. of country style sausage, doubled the garlic and cabbage and cut the cayenne pepper in half. I also used two 14.5 oz. cans of vegatable broth and about 2 cups of water. (I wanted it to be more of a soup than a stew.) It was a huge hit with everyone ... I will definitely make again!

Pretty good soup!  I used turkey smoked sausage and low sodium chicken broth.  If I make it again, here is what I would do differently...twice as much cabbage, 2 cans of tomatoes, no cayenne (even 1/4 tsp was too spicy for the kids).

I used Healthy Choice sausage, but left everything else the same. Very good! My husband ate 3 large bowls and I had 1 bowl - it was gone FAST! If you have small children I recommend using less Cayenne.

This is a great soup! The Soyrizo Crumble that I used made it look more like a chili...so I served half of it over Spaghetti, my husband thought that was awesome! Will make again with out crumble sausage next time.

This soup is delicious! I have made it many times in the last 10 years and I am finally reviewing it. The first time I made this soup, I had no lentils in the house, so I substituted barley. I have continued to make it that way and it is a family favorite.

I really liked this. After reading several reviews, I used regular smoked sausage, because I am a meat eater. Also I used chicken broth for extra flavor. I did add carrots for more color. It simmered on low until the lentils were done. This recipe had a lot of lentils compared to the rest of the vegetables. In the future I will use 1/2 the lentils and 7 ounces of smoked sausage with chicken broth.

Good, lentil soup is always good, hearty, filling, easy. I eliminated the cayenne and also the garlic as it over powered the flavor of the sausage, the onion is adequate.  I add more vegetables carrots and some chopped spinach or whatever I have on hand, even a handful of cooked pasta the last few minutes. I found that the lentils took longer to cook than indicated.  This freezes very well.

Love this! A tasty hearty soup for a cold day. Like others, I made changes. I used beef sausage, so instead of vegetable or chicken broth I used beef broth. I also added sliced carrots to ramp up the veggies. I love spicy food, so I didnâ€™t decrease the amount of cayenne pepper.

Good recipe as a guide, but changed it to make it not-vegetarian! First I did add some chopped carrots and a little more cabbage than the recipe called. I also doubled the garlic. I used chicken broth instead of the water and veggie bouillon. I used two Hillshire Farm's smoked sausages instead of veggie sausage. I added 1 tsp of black pepper towards the end of cooking, for a little extra kick, and also added 1 tsp of salt.

This went over really well with my daughter & husband. I wasn't crazy about my first bite but after a few bites I realized how good & hearty this soup is. I tried to double this recipe to use up my lentils as I had a bigger bag - next time I may measure this out.  I too am not a spicy person so I only used 1/4 tsp of the cayenne pepper.  I used tequila lime chicken sausage as this was what I had in the fridge.  I think this is a recipe one can use alternatives quite easily to suit ones taste buds.  I will be making this again but next time I might throw it in the crock pot.

First time using Lentils and Cabbage together.  It was very good.  3 out of 4 of us liked this recipe and we will make this again.  We used Andouille sausage, Banana Pepper in place of Cayenne Pepper but you could if you wanted more heat.

This soup was awesome. I changed it up since I didn't have the vegetarian options on hand.  I used chicken broth and regular smoked sausage.  I also added a leek and shallot.  Great flavor and the cayenne gives it just the right kick.

Best Lentil soup I ever made.  I doubled the recipe but went heavier on the lentils using the whole 16 oz bag and used beef polska sausage with beef boullion instead of the vegetable cubes. I froze the leftovers and it was even better the second time around for lunch at work.

Good flavor. Since I'm not a vegetarian, I used Hillshire Farm Beef Smoked Sausage which I had on hand. The sausage should be listed by the lb, not quantity. I had to double the recipe and not knowing what 2 sausages were, used a package (1 lb) of sausage. If I make this again, I will used about 2 lbs for a doubled recipe.

I made this however in the crockpot and I used real smoked sausage made with pork and beef. The soup was more like a stew and it wouldn't have turned out a very good soup.

My family really enjoys this recipe. We are not vegetarians, so we use regular smoked sausage. I also generally subsitute ham base for the vegetable base. 
I have made the recipe without the sausage to make it very economical and that works really well too.

I used fresh thyme, Emeril's chicken sausages, and a bit more garlic.This is a husband and kid pleaser for winter nights.

I didn't make this vegetarian, using smoked turkey sausage instead. I waited until about 10/15 minutes before serving to add the cabbage so it retained some of it's texture.

This soup is really filling and has a comfort food feel to it.  My grocery store did not have meatless sausage, but to keep it on the lite side I used Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage.  I tripled the amount of shredded cabbage, doubled the thyme and cayenne pepper.  I found the liquid needed to be increased as well.  My husband went back for seconds and plans to take it for lunch tomorrow.  Great recipe!

This was yummy - I followed some suggestions and made my own additions:  used small french lentils instead of regular and the 4 cups chicken broth instead of 2 cups water and bouillon cubes.   I increased cabbage to 1 cup, and sliced very thinly instead of shredding finely.  Used 1/2 smoked turkey sausage coil, 1/2 turnip diced, 4 baby carrots sliced, Herbes de Provence instead of thyme, red Mexican chili pepper because I had no cayenne, added some Hungarian paprika,  and 1 Bay leaf.  Everyone liked it.  Meant to add some chopped Swiss chard but forgot.  Will add it to the leftovers tomorrow - that should make it even tastier!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I shredded the cabbage in my cuisinart and substituted vegetarian sausage for turkey sausage. I also used chicken bouillon and might use chicken broth next time. I simmered it for double the time and the lentils held up wonderfully and absorbed the flavor well. We will make it again. Doubling the recipe tastes just as good!

Excellent with a few variations.  Used 3 cubes of vegetable bouillon, and polish sausage and extra cabbage.  My husband and I loved it and enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Did not add any more salt.

Made this last night and everyone liked it. I used mild Italian sausage from a local Italian market instead of the vegetarian sausage. I did not add salt as the veg. bouillon & the canned tomatoes are salty enough. When the soup was done, I stirred in the cabbage and let it cook for a few minutes; as a result, the cabbage retained some of its crispness and was a nice texture element. The cayenne really looses its zing in all that water, so don't worry about it being hot. Served with Jiffy brand cornbread muffins, and the sweetness of the cornbread is a great compliment to the savory flavors of the soup. This is a great basic recipe to customize.
