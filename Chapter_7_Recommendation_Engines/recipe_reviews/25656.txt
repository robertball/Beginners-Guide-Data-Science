This was the best dried soup mix that I have found.  Since I don't care for lentils I substituted dehydrated carrots and it was wonderful.

This recipe was very fast and easy.I used this recipe for Christmas gifts. I baked fresh bread and put a pot holder and a spoon with it. The soup it's self was a little week and I thought could have used some more chicken broth. But it was a great idea and I plan and doing it next holiday season.

We used this recipe to sell at a craft fair and it sold very quickly.  We also made a sample for the buyer to taste, it was great!

This is an excellent soup mix!  I always make extra containers for my own use throughout the year.  

I have however made 2 slight adjustments.  I started using the 3cup round Ziploc containers instead of 1pint jars.  Recipients of the gift don't feel obliged to give back the container after they've made their soup.  You can also fit more than just 1 cup of egg noodles in the container.  

The adjustment I make when preparing the soup is to replace 12 - 16 ounces of water with turkey broth.

Oh, and if you donâ€™t have a fresh turkey meat, try adding a can of chicken.  It makes this recipe even simpler.

Haven't actually tried this myself but I made up a bunch of jars to go in my Christmas baskets.  It looked really nice layered.  The only thing I did different was that I added extra egg noodles to fill up the jars (I used 1 quart sized jars) I sure hope it tastes good and not justs look pretty!!!  Once I try it myself I will update.

It's Great as is. I think I'll try it with pot Barley instead of Lentils next time.
