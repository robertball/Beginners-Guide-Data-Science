just EXACTLY like I remember eating as a child when my mom would make this!  I've tried over the years to make this - but could NOT get the proportions right!

I wanted to see if stewed tomatoes are still as discusting as when my mother would force me to eat them as a child.   To my surprise, I enjoyed this dish!  my mother always used white bread, but I only had 12 grain bread on hand.  I halved this recipe, and used only 1 tablespoon sugar.   I really liked the 12 grain bread in this, I think I will always use it to make it a tad healthier.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made this yesterday with some stale french bread needing to be used.  It was absolutely delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and ate the whole dish.  Only change was to saute some onions in the butter and add to the dish.  (I eat onions in everything!).  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the second time I have made this dish and each time it is better than the last time.  My brother used to make this when he had his restaurant, but this is so much better.  Only thing I did was cut the recipe in half.  My husband liked it very much also. Makes a great side dish for fried fish.

These stewed tomatoes were better than the kind my Mom used to make, sorry Mom!!
The only thing that I did different was lightly toast the bread.  And maybe next time I may add some sauteed onions.
Can't wait to make these again!!

I'm another woman who STILL cannot control the child within. I always thought this dish was a punishment for something I'd done. My mother finally gave up saying she could'nt stand the awful faces I made (they ruined the dish for her and she'd eat anything!) Fast forward 6 decades - Holey moley batman! These taste really good!! Although Mum always put sugar on tomato-anything ( it's a fruit afterall ) I'm pretty sure that she would be perfectly happy with 1/3 C of sugar. in this recipe. Thank you X3!!   P.S. I'm pretty sure she's above us all with a satisfied grin on her face.

Yes I tried it and I liked it! I had not heard of baking stewed tomatoes. I substituted fresh garden tomatoes in season for the canned tomatoes and turned out good. You might add a little water when using the fresh tomatoes.

I just made this for my mother and mother in law, who used to make this growing up. They thought it was the best they had ever eaten.  I revised a little, 1/4 c sugar, will use even less next time.  I had one can  of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano.  It added just the right amount of seasoning.

I was hosting my FIL's birthday dinner and decided to make stewed tomatoes, since it's one of his favorite side dishes.  Having never made/eaten stewed tomatoes, I wasn't sure what to even look for in a recipe.  This one needed a *face*, so it caught my eye.  The 2/3C sugar scared me, so I took the advice of prior reviewers and went w/1T and it was perfect!  I didn't even think I liked stewed tomatoes and I enjoyed these!  THANKS, for the recipe, Clotho!

Not too bad.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c and it was still way too sweet.  The bread gives it a very "bready" taste so I think I'll try saltines or a mix of both next time.

This recipe only received fair reviews from my wife and dinner guests.  Most of them were probably used to savory stewed tomoatos and said they found it too sweet.

I don't know how to edit my own recipe, so I'll just add this note here:

Please use your own discretion on the amount of pepper.  I tend to use a lot.

Oh Man!!!  I couldn't even remember what this was called, but wanted it today, so began to search, and here it is.  For dietary reasons, I cut the sugar way back, left out the butter and salt, and boiled 6 fresh plum tomatoes in a little water, toasted the bread a bit and then served it with bow-tie pasta for dinner.  But it was the texture, the flavor, the side dish I wanted.  I know many say that means I didn't make the recipe, therefore shouldn't evaluate it.  Sorry, but I use this site for inspiration more than imitation.  And this inspired me.  Thank you for posting it.

My mom grew up during the depression,  she was raised on this dish and so  was I.  Her family was from the midwest. She used several cans of "stewed tomatoes", they are already seasoned and had sugar added so she never added  the extra sugar. She never added the butter either but that might be good, or a couple teaspoons of olive oil.  Everything else is the same and as an adult I still love this dish.

I fell in love with Stewed Tomatoes after being served them at my elementary school. I love eating them with Black Eyed Peas. This recipe is so simple and delicious. It's also so easy to modify to your custom tastes.

Tasted just like my mother used to make.  I did take the advice of others and used less sugar.  I used half of a 1/3 cup measuring cup and it was just right for our taste!  I also used less pepper since we don't like that much pepper.  Thanks for a really easy and tasty recipe.

This is an easy recipe that tastes great.  I made it twice so far, first exactly as the recipe states, but I did think it was to sweet and I LOVE sweets.  The second time I cut the sugar in half and it was better, but next time I am going to cut it in halft again.  Any way you cook this it is good, fast and a one bowl recipe.  

I did add cooking time (60 instead of 45 minutes) so that the tomatoes were softer and the bread on top a little chewy, it is delicious.

An old girlfriend's grandmother used to make this for family get togethers.  I had never had it before we started dating 35 years ago and my love affair with the recipe lasted longer than my relationship with the girlfriend!  Have tried to replicate it on my own a few times with no success.  Glad to find a winner.

I substituted a gourmet medley of tomatoes instead of using canned. One cup of chicken broth was used for the liquid. I found the broth a bit too sweet, but the tomatoes were nice and tender with good flavor. When I make it again, our use less sugar to suit my taste. Overall, very easy to make and a nice side dish to serve.

Very delish. I did add/take away from original recipe (I know some ppl detest this, sorry). I used garden tomatoes for this. I used 1 T of sugar instead of original amt.  I used left over baguette. Added garlic powder, onion powder, Everything Bagel sprinkles, truffle salt, ground pepper. It was so delicious. My husband just kept eating and eating. I'm not a real fan of stewed tomatoes but this was very good and man did it make the house smell good. Highly recommend, but I don't think you need all that sugar, especially if you're diabetic.

This was really good. Taste just like my grandma's stewed tomatoes. I will be making these again next year for New Years.

I made this for a ninety something year old gentleman who was wishing for some tomatoes like his mother used to make on the farm when he was young. His family had tried other recipes without any luck. This was “the one”.

Its great even not baked and with less sugar and butter....its all the food I get from the food bank! I mix with ramen noodles....if I get lucky....I add a can of roast beef chunks from food bank or dollar store. This makes food bank food healthier!

This is really good, but you CAN make it with fresh tomatoes!  I used the same weight of fresh tomatoes from the garden, peeled, and DID use this much sugar.  I did add some water to make up for the liquid in canned tomatoes - it was delicious!  Due to the sweetness, when I used these in the Slow Cooker Pepper Steak recipe, I skipped the sugar that recipe calls for.
I have made this twice now, and it is a GREAT way to use up extra tomatoes from the garden!

We ate sweet stewed tomatoes when I was growing up but I thought it was some made up dish created by Mom to feed a house full of kids.  When a neighbor gifted me a bag of tomatoes from his garden I went searching for a different way to use them up and found this.  Delighted with the outcome!  Only thing I did differently was to butter bread on both sides and cut to fit the pan (instead of mixing bread cubes into the dish).  This resulted in a caramelized, almost pie-like dish that I've so far sampled with chicken.  I'll be serving this often, especially at Thanksgiving.

Mum would make this on a cold day for lunch. It still makes my mouth water.  My aunt made it with crackers, not so palatable, had to choke it down with lots of milk.

Made this last night for my in-laws  They loved it. I like to have it with green beans and IF we have leftovers the green beans and stewed tomatoes go in the same dish. , Makes an excellent side  for the next day.  I did cut the sugar by 1/3, still plenty sweet.

Absolutely yummy!  Didn't use the full amount of sugar and sauteed some onion in the butter but followed everything else to the letter.  Going to eat it with mac and cheese!  Thanks for the recipe!

I searched high and low for this recipe.  I had stewed tomatoes once when I was a little girl and haven't had them since.  Very simple, quick, and easy to modify.  I made this as is, and thought it was a bit sweet.  Made it again cutting the sugar to about half to 2/3 the amount called for and it was just right for my taste.

On second try I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and lost the pepper. That amount of pepper overwhelmed the dish. Now tastes more sweet/Southern like we eat in VA. Also used Martin's Potato Bread. Very good with slight alterations.
