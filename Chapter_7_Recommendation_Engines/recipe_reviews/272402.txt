The nutrition facts on this page MUST be wrong. As Denice Rayburn said, 33 carbs seemed way too high to me for a recipe with almond flour, butter, erythritol, etc. Where were the carbs coming from??


I used my own "Nutrition/Macros Spreadsheet" and came up with these results. Note that everything is right in line with this page's stated nutrition facts, EXCEPT the carbs, which are considerably lower:

Serving (1/12)
Calories:   455.02 kCal
Fat:   43.009 g
Carbs:   5.593 g (NOTE: these are NET carbs, I deduct the dietary fiber in my spreadsheet)
Protein:   11.787 g


So my calculations show about 6 times LESS carbs than is listed, which makes sense to me because, as I said above, where would the 396 total carbs (33 * 12 servings) be coming from?!


Erythritol has ZERO net carbs, since it's not digested as a carb by our bodies.

I made this but the crust turned out very dry and fell apart very easily. Next time I will be adding more butter to the crust itself to make sure it hardens up and baking the crust about 10 minutes longer to get a more genuine feel. I also added lemon juice to the fruit topping and that turned out amazing! My fianc√© love it.

While it's a REALLY good cheesecake, at almost 33 grams of carbs I can hardly call it a "low carb" cheesecake!  Still, it really is tasty and almost undiscernable from the "real" ones!

Used strawberries and halved the recipe to fit in a pie plate. Got thumbs up from the whole family, keto dieter and non dieters. Will have to lessen the bake time for crust as my oven darkened it fast!

had I been served this cheesecake in a cafe I would have never believed that it was Keto friendly or low calorie. I will make this cake even after I stop doing the Keto diet. I cannot say enough how good.
