The custard is way too salty.  The eclair shells cooked up like crackers.  I ended up using the "Eclairs II" recipe on this site and it worked great.  Don't bother with this one.

If I could give no stars, I would. I remade them 3 TIMES! None turned out right. They always burned and turned to a crumbly mess. I lowered the cook time, amount of ingredients, oven temp. Nothing worked. I do not like this recipe and I would NOT recommend it. It was a waste of time and perfectly good ingredients.

Custard is ok, but my crusts turned out like the other ladie's--crackers!  I think the recipe needs salt in it.  Batter is runny.

Recipe for the Pate a Choux... Normally 1 c water, 1/2 c butter, 1 c flour, 1/4 tsp salt, and 4 eggs.  The 2 tbsp should be 1/2 c  water since she is halving it. Technique for making it is correct. 

As for the custard, 1/4 tsp would be enough salt. IF you correct the pastry, it turns out ok.

As others have stated, custard is too salty and the pastry did not puff, they turned out more like a biscotti.  I tried making the pastry twice.
