I was disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor of the cheesecake was OK, the sauce was sort of bland.  The directions did not indicate greasing the springform pan, so I didn't.  The crust (which was tasty) stuck to the pan.

this is a holiday keeper!! it was very tasty, it tastes just like the eggnog that you pour into a glass, very easy to make, mistake proof! i made 2 in the same day and took 1 to work,my co-workers loved it, gave away 3 recipes for it(thats always  a good indication), A HOLIDAY TRADITION HAS BEGUN!!             p.s. try CHOCOLATE nilla wafers.

This was a GREAT hit!  Perfect cheesecake for the holidays.  everyone wanted the recipe and there was no pieces left.  When I made the second, I found it and the rum sauce tasted even better the next day.  next time I make this for company, I will make the previous day.  Thank you for posting!

This cheesecake was wonderful. Easy to make and even without eggnog in it, with the dark rum and nutmeg, it is awesome. Thanks.

This is an excellent cheesecake for Christmas. I omitted the brown sugar glaze and added green and red edible glitter. The church people loved it and disappeared like a miracle. Thank you JJOHN32.

It was OK.  The use of cornstarch in the sauce gives it a gravy consistency, which I didn't like.
