I personally love fresh mint, and was excited when I was recommended this recipe on the "Recipe Buzz". I followed the recipe exactly, however I wasn't very impressed. None of the mint flavor shone through, but maybe I'm not used to the flavor of cooked mint.  I usually use it fresh.  I found it too salty as well.  It was OK but I will try something else next time.

I really enjoyed the mint flavor that came through here.  I used a combination of pineapple mint and spearmint that I had growing in the garden.

I am giving this fish a 4 on account of the family really did not care for it but I did.The mint was not very prominent, I added 2 bunches of fresh mint for 2 1/2 lbs of fish.  I used cilantro instead of the parsley. It was easy and quick. I tought it tasted really good! Thanks for an interesting take on salmon!

This recipe will knock your socks off.
I made this tonight and it was fantastic.  It definitely is a keeper.
I served it with steamed Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes.

This made the most succulent salmon I've had in a while.  I used wild caught sockeye and marinated for about 3 hours before cooking on the grill.  I was concerned that the mint might be overwhelming, but it just tasted herbal. This took quite a bit longer to grill than the recipe indicated, and I did not pull it off until it was looking a little overcooked (it was wonderfully moist and delicious).  I did skip the brushing with butter - that would have added uneeded extra calories.

I've made it twice.
The first time it was fantastic.  The second time wasn't as great.  I think it was the choice of honey.  Making it again tonight!

Absolutely D'lish!! I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee (except I don't measure, so there may have been a pinch more or less, but not by much) I did take into account previous reviews for more mint and not enough flavor, so I used more mint and more salt! Oh, i also didn't use parsley, but only b/c I didn't have any on hans, but I'm not really a big fan, so i prob would have skipped it anyway. I also don't have a grill or grill pan and hate pan searing (to much greasy cleanup) so I broiled it, 5 min, no flipping. Since I used the broiler, I put a small slab of butter on top of each filet to achieve a nice slightly charred glow! I couldn't shovel it in fast enough!!! This will totally be my go to, and I'm so glad I have another use for mint! THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE! :-D I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow, people will be jealous.... ;-)

This recipe makes a delicious flavorful salmon.  Use half the amount of salt, though.  I used the amount suggested and it was way too salty!

We tried this recipe tonight. We used a skillet with non - stick cooking spray instead of grilling the salmon.  
The salmon came out moist and very flavorful. My husband especially enjoyed the carmelization of the herb mixture on the fish.  We will definitely try this one again.

I made this because the mint would help my wife's stomach settle (chemo). I forgot the parsley so I subbed a cupped handful of herb de provence, and the same of basil. I blackened it and it melted in our mouths

This was delicious, although as others noted, it wasn't very mint-y. I didn't have parsley so I only used mint, and I had no idea how much mint makes a "bunch". I cut the lemon juice in half but it still ended up as liquid with the bits of mint and garlic, which were enough to still coat the top of each piece. I marinated the salmon in the fridge for 1.5 hours and it was fine. Forgot about removing it from the marinade so we just baked it in the marinade. It was tender and juicy and flavorful. Next time I'd use even less lemon juice; I think it had enough mint. Omitted the salt and butter as others recommended.

Loved this recipe. Probably the best salmon I've had. I did skip on the salt, and it didnt need any added afterward. I didn't have parsley, so I just doubled the mint

I didn't care for this that much.  To me, it was like eating salmon while having spearmint gum in your mouth.  I would probably like it leaving the mint out.
