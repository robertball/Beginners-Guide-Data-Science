Such a fresh flavor! I loved using real ingredients instead of bottled mix, and grilling everything made the flavors richer. The color was much lighter than I thought it would be, but maybe it's because the tomatoes were fresh instead of canned. I can't wait to host a brunch and blow everyone's mind with this.
