There really is no need to precook the veggies.  They steam up quite nicely in the parchment paper.  I used grape tomatoes (halved), artichoke hearts (quartered), sliced mushrooms, red onion, garlic, fresh oregano and fresh parsley.  I laid the red snapper on a bed of couscous and wrapped in the parchment paper.  30 minutes later, dinner was served, all wrapped up in a nice little package.

It was a bit time-consuming to prepare and i didn't have a lot of luck with the parchment paper - it didn't seal properly and thus didn't puff up. But the flavour combination was very good. Peeling and seeding the tomatos was worth the effort. Next time i will simply fry the fish and top with the tomatos, and serve with the lemony mushrooms on the side.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  Be careful to cook the fish only a bit on the stove before putting in the oven or else it will dry out.  The thyme and bit of wine really made it out of the ordinary.

I made this exactly as stated. It was okay, but a lot of steps involved. I may have used too much egg white wash to keep parchment together and it never puffed up so I baked it longer than 15 min. The flavor was okay but I had never used thyme on fish so thought it unusual. I have never used parchment to bake fish so I  am grateful for a recipe in which I could learn how to do it. I discovered you don't need a lot of egg white to hold it together.

I was dissapointed in this recipe.  The flavors didn't meld together very well.  It just tased like cooked tomatoes with some fish thrown in.  Not sure what I could have done wrong, but I won't be trying this one again
