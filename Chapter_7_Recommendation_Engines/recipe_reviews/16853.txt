We loved this. I did REDUCE the amount of butter to ONLY 1/4 cup, that maybe why some reviewers gave a lower rating because it was to soggy. Reduce the amount of butter & it will turn out Perfect! I also added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg to topping when mixing it. This is a keeper!

This recipe is excellent with some slight modification.  I used 2 granny smith and 2 gala apples to balance the tart and sweet, poured only about 1/2 the maple syrup on top of the apples (didn't mix, it all blends when baking).  I would use a little more if using all granny smith, less if using sweeter apples.  For the topping, I cut the butter in half, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was DIVINE served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Had a subtle taste of maple without being overpoweringly sweet.  Threw out my old apple crisp recipe on the spot.

I did this recipe twice, once with just maple pancake syrup, not to bad. And once with pure maple syrup, a definite improvement. I would recommend using the pure maple syrup and half the butter. Worked out perfect

This apple crisp is sooo delicious.  The amount of butter seemed to be a little too much so i lessened the amount to 1/4 of a cup instead of a whole cup.  I melted it and then added the butter to the mixture and it came out nice and crunchy when done.  I love this recipe.  Thanks so much!

Maple Syrup (REAL) adds such a nice taste to this old favorite. I added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg to topping when mixing it. This is a keeper!

EXCELLENT!  I have apprx a 30lb bag of apples from our apple tree that NEED to get used up and this is a PERFECT recipe! I used more apples so I could bake in a 9x13 dish but only 1/2c maple syrup. In addition to doubling the "crisp" part of the recipe - I also added some finely chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The maple taste is subtle but the overall taste is great! I already plan to make a second batch! Thanks Crystal!

Really good and super easy. I didn't add as much maple syrup as it called for. I did had 1/2 c. of chopped walnuts and some cinnamon to the topping though. Yummy.

I had severe reservations about this recipe going in, but all the positive reviews lulled my instinctive reaction. Unfortunately, instinct was correct. Adding maple syrup to apple crisp - outstanding idea. Subjecting the syrup to prolonged high temperatures . . . not so. Maple products lose their flavor at high temperatures, which is why it takes so long to make the syrup - the boil must be controlled in the low 200 degree region. Made as posted, there was barely a hint of maple flavor. I made it a second time (see custom recipe) and it was much better. When cooking with genuine maple syrup, low and slow is the way to go.

Loved this!!! I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and also didn't use as much maple syrup, just drizzled it over the apples. It was REALLY good!

A great & simple recipe (easy to remember too). The maple syrup is a nice change from the standard cinnamon/nutmeg flavor of most apple crisp recipes. That said, I didn't use the suggested 3/4 cup of maple syrup. Instead I drizzled maybe 1/2 cup on the sliced apples and discarded what was left on the bottom of the bowl.

This apple crisp is really delicious. I made it for a family supper and everybody loved it. The only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is because it didn't really taste like maple.

Fabulous recipe just the way it is!  I don't like it when people make changes to the recipe and then rate it based on their variations - they aren't really rating the recipe then are they??

I love the sound of this recipe but wanted to read through reviews I read a post by a reader that I had to address first before even making this recipe.  It read "Maple products lose their flavor at high temperatures, which is why it takes so long to make the syrup - the boil must be controlled in the low 200 degree region. Made as posted, there was barely a hint of maple flavor."  This information is not true I produce maple syrup for a living and high temperatures are exactly how we get maple syrup, pure maple syrup comes in different intensity's hence the system of labeling it;light medium and dark.  The lighter the syrup in color usually the lighter and more delicate in flavor and the darker the syrup the more robust the flavor.  Grade B syrup being the most robust and is typically used in cooking.  Most people are familiar with maple flavoring and they don't realize maple syrup really doesn't taste anything like that. If you like that strong flavor I suggest you put in a couple drops of maple flavoring. The only thing high temperature does do to maple syrup (if you don't burn it) is make it thicker and darker.  I look forward to trying this recipe as is. I love spices so I may experiment with cinnamon and nutmeg on subsequent tries. My only other thought is that the poster may have been using imitation syrup or a imitation blend I can't speak to that.

This turned out very good! I had gala apples I needed to use that weren't the sweetest to begin with, so I doubted this recipe would turn out. I thought there was too much syrup once I put it with the apples so I added some brown sugar and a little of the crubmle to the mix (I also used light pancake syrup not the real-deal, maple syrp). Also threw in some cinnamon and splenda on top before adding the crumble topping. For the crumble I added wheat germ, ground flax seed and subed 1/4 a cup of whole wheat flour to 1/4 of enriched.  I think if I make this again I'll put less syrup or add a little cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Or maybe splurge on real maple syrup! I think it would be really good with some nuts sprinkled on top too. Maybe dried cranberries or a little something else mixed in as well. Overall really good!

This will be our standard Apple Crisp recipe from now on. As other reviewers stated, I cut the butter for the topping in half and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to it. But, then I made an additional half batch of topping as I know my family likes that part. I also coated the apples in flour before mixing with the syrup. I only used 1/2 C of maple syrup and added about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to that syrup. I baked in a deep-dish pie plate (Grandma Bonny's from P Chef). Next time, I might even cut the syrup down to 1/3 C.

LOVE this recipe!  My wife and I use it when we need something quick/easy that everyone will love.  We also cut the butter down to at least a quarter cup and use only about 1/3 - 1/2 cup maple syrup.

This was such a quick and easy recipe. There are only two of us, so I used three apples (plus, that's all we had).  For the topping, I used 6T of butter and 1/4c brown sugar, and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also used sugar free maple syrup.  I'm sure the full sugar/fat version is also full of a lot more flavour, but even with these alterations it's very good.  Not too sweet or rich, but still very tasty!

Warm tasty dessert for a cold night.  I reduced the butter by half, and added slightly less than 3/4 cup pure maple syrup.  It was still very runny, I often have that problem with apple desserts - maybe my apples are too juicy?  Next time, I will add some off the topping in between layers of the apples to absorb some of the liquid.  I did add spices to taste (cinnamon, nutmeg) as I'm not one of the 'recipe purists', and enjoy tweaking recipes to suit my tastes.  Excellent, easy way to use extra apples!

What a wonderful combination of apple and maple flavors!!  I used Gala apples and should have cut the brown sugar back a little as it was too sweet.  I followed the advice of other reviewers to reduce the butter to 1/4 cup and I'd recommend that as well since it still has a buttery taste with less calories.

As written, it tastes pretty good, but there is not enough topping and too much butter in the topping. I tried making it again following others suggestions and used half the apples (I used golden delicious by the way), half the butter and kept the rest the same and it turned out perfect! If you're in a rush (or are just feeling lazy), you can skip peeling the apples. I always leave on the peels and it tastes fine.

I love this stuff!  Ever since I saw this recipe I use the basic ingredients to make apple crisp.  I only gave it a 4-star rating because as-is I think the recipe calls for too much sugar (especially maple) and too much butter.  I don't measure anything, but I cut up the apples (sometimes I peel them too) then drizzle some maple syrup over them (sometimes I add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples).  Then I mix roughly equal amounts of oats, flour (wheat), and brown sugar (a little less) with a bit of salt.  Then I add enough butter and oil to dampen the topping.  Spread over apples and bake until the top starts to brown. I can't eat it without ice cream... DELICIOUS!!

Great. I didn't have good apples though. I replaced the oats with Special K strawberry cereal, works in place of oats and tastes good. If I make this recipe again I'd make it with Special K.

I made this recipe today following the suggestions of some of the other reviewers to reduce the butter and maple syrup by a tad.  It turned out great.  I took it to a pot luck brunch today and served it with real whipped cream.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  It's all gone!!  Boo hoo!  Guess I'll have to make it again.  I only got one serving.  LOL!

This was super easy to make and very tasty! I think the serving size is way off though. The first time I made this in an 8x8, the servings would have been way to small to feed 8 people. Also, I think the baking time is off...needs to bake longer so it isn't mushy and so the top coating gets crunchy/crisp. I added more apples and made in an 9x13 this past time...and it was great. I served it with french vanilla ice cream while it was still hot. YUM!

Followed recipe except for the addition of 2 cups of blueberry and extra apples I wanted used up. Doubled the topping. When warm there was a lot of liquid from syrup and apple juice but this thickened up someone when cold.  I served this with Cereal Cream.  The raves of guests were unbelievable, best Apple Crisp ever.  Thanks. I'll be making this again in a few days to use up the bags of sliced apples on hand.  I can't control myself I have it breakfast, lunch and supper.

Wonderful - I've made this many times now, with a few modifications. I always use real Maple Syrup but I cut it down to about 1/4 cup. I also double the topping but keep the 1/2 cup of brown sugar the same - otherwise I find it wicked sweet.  And I sprinkle in some cinnamon and nutmeg into the topping. It's heaven.

I've used this recipe several times and whenever I find organic granny smiths, I buy them just to make it--it's that good.    I don't even bother measuring; I just pour maple syrup over the apples and use equal parts of flour, butter, oats and brown sugar till I have the amount of topping I need.  The one and only change I made was to add pumpkin pie spice to the topping.  That took it from four stars to five so if you have any on hand, try it.  I found an organic pure maple syrup that is thicker than most and find that it makes the perfect consistency.  This is definitely one of the best recipes I have ever found.  Thank you, Crystal!

This was quite a tasty recipe, but I didn't get much of a maple flavor out of it.  I will definitely make it again, but maybe add a tsp or two of maple extract on top of the maple syrup.

I think this is a very great basic recipe! I made just a couple simple modifications and it was truly fantastic.

I know I like a generous amount of "crisp" topping, so i used 3/4 cup each of the flour, oats and brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp baking powder to the flour. I kept the butter at 1/2 cup. 

I sprinkled the apples with about a tbsp of corn starch, then tossed them with the maple syrup. Helped to thicken all the juices a little I think. I then sprinkled a tbsp or so of cinnamon over the apples before pressing the oat topping lightly over the apples. yumm

Absolutely amazing! Mine didn't turn out very crispy, but I blame me and not the recipe. Still tastes awesome regardless. This is a new favorite dessert!

This was a great hit - and easy, too! Like some other reviewers, I cut down on the butter with great results. However, it was a little too sweet, even after cutting back a bit on the maple syrup. Other than that, it would be a 5-star; still, this is a great keeper.

Delicious!  The more tart the apples, the better, or it can be overwhelming sweet.  Like every one else, I halved the butter and it turned out perfect.  Also, about 5 minutes before it's done, I stir the oat mixture in with the apples to moisten it a bit.

I used the same amount of maple syrup, eyeballed the dry ingredients, and cut in the butter while still cold, didn't have time to soften it. I was in a rush so I just added a splash of water to get things together. It came out soooo unbelievably delicious! Apples were beautifully caramelized (I used golden delicious apples). Possibly the easiest, fastest most delicious apple crisp ever!! thanks so much for sharing!

This was such a perfect fall dessert, it has the taste of the season but none of the cookie-cutter "pie spice" flavorings most fall desserts have. I am docking a star because I feel 3/4c syrup and the 1/2c butter as written do make a very soggy (but still delicious!) product. I will start with 1/4c maple on the apples and toss until they are coated adding more if needed. As for the butter, I kept the amount but added 1c of walnuts to the topping, which we LOVED. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was excellent.  I cut the maple in half as others suggested and melted the butter before adding it.  I also added about a 2 tablespoons of maple syrup to the crumb topping and I also doubled the topping and made it in a 9" X 13" pan.  I used very small apples that my kids and I got apple picking so the amount of apples may not have been the same I covered the bottom of the pan with one layer.  Needless to say for my first ever homemade apple crisp this was awesome.  Everyone who tried it loved it.

The taste is good.  I feel it needs cinnamon.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It is way too soupy.  Might try it again and cut the butter in half as others have suggested.  I will definately add some cinnamon next time.  Not overly impressed with this recipe.

I made the recipe as is using a 9 x 13 pan.  This was delicious.  I drizzled the liquid in the bottom of the pan over ice cream.  Make sure you use very tart apples to balance the sweetness of the sugar and syrup.

Wow! Soooo yummy!!! I love Fall and the foods associated w/ the season. This recipe captures the essence of both. I needed a dessert to serve w/ dinner 2nite (my fiance & I invited my parents over). Even tho my fiance opted for ice cream for dessert (he is not a fruit fan), my parents & I polished off all but 1 serving of this (w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top)! I pretty much followed Crystal's directions to a T except for adding a t cinnamon / 1/2 t nutmeg to my crumb mix. You can use any baking apple you choose (just be sure it's suited for baking...). I used 3 Granny Smith / 2 Golden Delicious apples (the latter were lg., so I used fewer of them). NOTE: You MUST use PURE maple syrup! Imitation pancake syrup is NOT the same thing!!! SECOND NOTE: I was hesitatnt about using a full 1/2 c. of butter since many reviewers suggested using 1/2 this amount. I noticed that my oat mixture wasn't as crumbly as I hoped w/ only 1/4 c. of butter, so I used the full 1/2 c. called for.. TIP: It helps to cut COLD butter into sm. pats & then incorporate w/ a pastry blender (DO NOT melt your butter!). I am VERY glad I did this. My crisp turned out perfect! My only changes for next time will be to a) decrease the amount of apples to 3-4 total, depending on sze. (my baking dish was FULL, and I think this is why some of my apples didn't cook thru to my liking...) & b) reduce the amount of syrup (there was waaay too much of it). Thanks for sharing, Crystal! :-) This is a winner for sure!

By far one of the easiest and BEST apple crisp recipes I have ever made!  The nice thing about this crisp is the Maple flavor.  I used 6 apples, about 1 cup of Oats and 1/4 cup butter. I used 1-2 T of cinn to the flour mixture.  I used white sugar instead of brown sugar b/c this is all I had on hand. This crisp came hot out of the over right as the bus came home, My five year old loved it. My 2 year old asked for more and my husband said to me..stop being supermom this is delish. Little did he know this was SO simple to make. I topped the crisp with store bought whip cream.

Deprived Gluten free folk -rejoice! I left out the flour, increased the oats, and triumph! All the good things about apple pie, with none of the hassle of rolling out a crust. (Or, in my poor guy's case, the discomfort associated with wheat products) I added spices to the filling and the oat/butter mixture, and served it hot a la mode, and it was just devine. I don't know why nobody told me about wonderful crisps and crumbles sooner! Thank you for this simple, wonderful recipe!

Very good!  My only complaint would be that the topping is never enough, so I needed to double it both times I made it.  I recommend switching the oven from bake to broil for the last 5 minutes or so to get a really crunchy topping :)

Very good recipe with a few tweaks! Added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice since we like more spice. Reduced the maple syrup but also added a couple of tbls of flour to the apple mix - prevents the "runs" and the juices set up like a sauce. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for posting...

Very tasty. I agree w/ others, though, that this is maybe a little too sweet. I know desserts are meant to be sweet, but this one may be a bit much for my personal taste. But I don't think it's from the syrup because it wasn't the filling that was too sweet.  I think next time I'll try increasing the oatmeal in the topping & maybe decrease the brown sugar slightly.  LOVED the maple flavor.  Right out of the oven, it is a bit 'saucy', but if you can let it sit for a few hours before serving, it thickens up quite a bit.  Overall, very yummy. I'd make it again.

Wow, fantastic! I only had about 1/2 the recommended amount of maple syrup, so I used honey for the rest--incredibly delicious! I added raisins, too, and they plumped up really well. I look forward to making this many, many times in the future. :)

Excellent and light recipe.  I used 1/4 cup margarine; added a bit more flour and oats (3/4 cup).  I would NOT recommend reducing the amount of maple syrup b/c otherwise the apples will take MUCH longer to cook as there's no liquid to make them soft.  I used light maple syrup and used splenda for sugar.  Excellent guilt-free recipe.  Thank you!

What did I do wrong? I reduced the maple syrup a fraction and added a bit of flour to the apple maple syrup mixture to absorb moisture. The result was less than I hoped. It was relatively tasteless and the crumble on the top was clumpy instead of crumbly. I don't plan on trying this recipe again 
:(

This was simple and delicious. All I had was gala apples on hand and it still turned out great. I just drizzled the maple syrup over the apples once I put them in the dish instead of using the measured amount. I added chopped walnuts and a handful of flax seeds to the crust mixture. Also topped it off with a dusting of cinnamon before baking. Apples have a lot of water in them, so expect the juice to cook out. That's just part of it, and it makes a good drizzle over ice cream.

This is my go-to recipe for apple crisp.  When apple season come here in Upstate NY my husband and I pick about 40lbs.  Most gets made into apple sauce to be canned for the winter, but most of the rest is made into this delicious dish!  I measure nothing except for the topping.  I do use less butter than it calls for and omit the salt because I can't notice the difference.  I just drizzle the maple syrup over the sliced apples once they are arranged in the dish.  And I use nothing but grade B syrup (none of that phone pole syrup).  If anyone cares for crisp, they will love this one!

HEAVENLY!!!  The only change I made was to double the topping because it is that good.  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Definitely a keeper.  I used granny smiths by the way.  I will be making this regularly as it's so easy to make and the results are wonderful

Absolutely delicious!! Very easy to make too! I only made 2 changes. I used 4 large apples and added a little cinnamon to the topping. Topped it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Will definitely make again!!

Excellent apple crisp!!  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of maple syrup to 2/3c and next time I would decrease a little more as I found it quite runny.  The taste was excellent and everyone loved it!  Thanks!

I love this recipe, but instead of halving the butter as other people have suggested, I doubled the rolled oats. It made more topping, which I prefer. There is no need to add extra sugar or anything to the oats because the syrup is already sweet :)

Loved it. Followed everyone else's advice and cut the butter down to a half a stick + 2 tbsp, and also sprinkled the top with some cinnamon. It was a tiny bit soupy, but not enough to bother any of us. I would change the serving numbers, though - even though this recipe said enough for 8 servings, we only got 6 out of it.

This is delicious, however, I followed other posts and cut butter in half to 1/4 cup. I think next time I will ad two more TBS of butter, still not quite as much as recipe calls for.  I added some Craisins and it added a wonderful tartness to help balance the sweet.  I did have syrup/juice left in pan but put it over vanilla ice cream...delicious, ties it all together.  I also added pumpkin seeds for some added saltiness.  I add these to things now instead of nuts sometimes and it's nice addition/change.  Very yummy, will make again!

This recipe should not be called a "crisp". It was soggy and more like a soup. The apples in the center did not cook properly and there was a ton of syrup at the bottom. I thought that once everything cooled, the syrup might just soak in, but I was wrong. I will drain the juices out, eat what's left and then never make this again.

So yummy. This was easy and delicious! I will be making this again and again. My 3 year old loved it. I just changed one thing. I used 1 tablesppon lemon juice first on the apples and then layered them in the dish and then topped with syrup then the topping.

delicious after the following modifications! 1. decrease the butter to 1/4 cup 2. add cinnamon and nutmeg  i have also replaced the maple syrup with about half of a bag of unwrapped carmels. these melt as you cook, so no need to warm/melt in the microwave before baking. perfect for fall!

You don't get much better (or easier) than this!  I realized about halfway through the process that I didn't have any oats, so I substituted 2 single-serving packages of instant oatmeal (Maple & Brown Sugar flavor).  I only used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar since the instant oatmeal was already sweetened.  I also cut back the butter to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested.  I drizzled a little extra syrup on top before putting it into the oven.  Awesome!!!

Very good! I read several reviews and tryed with only 1/4 cup of butter- perfect! I think the true beauty of this recipe is its versatiltiy, you can make just to your taste! I like to add 1/2 teaspsoon vanilla or almond extract, walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg and cut the maple syrup with honey (about half).

I loved this recipe and thought the maple syrup was an inventive idea. My topping came out not so crisp when I used the recommened amount.  Next time I made it, I lightly sprayed the top with a little Pam and it turned out very crispy!

Delicious! This is my new Holy Grail apple crisp! The maple syrup adds a nice taste note, be sure to use a good quality dark one. I will be doubling the amount the topping next time since we are both crumb lovers

The top turned out nice and crispy.  I thought it was to much maple syrup.  I used real syrup, which is not at think as the fake stuff and this might be why it was to runny.  Next time I will just coat the apples in the syrup.

This was very good!  I changed it slightly, and used 1/2 cup of maple syrup + 1/4 cup of honey.  There wasn't such an overpowering maple taste that other reveiwers commented on.  I do wish that there was more of the crisp topping though; next time, I will increase the amount of oats and sugars to make a thicker topping.  Overall though, so delicious!

Delicious!  I brought this to dinner at a friends house and it tasted phenomenal--big raves from everyone.  I followed others' suggestions by using only 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also used 3 Granny Smith apples and 2 Yellow Delicous apples to balance out the flavors.  It did have a little more liquid after it had been baked, but this did not affect the taste in the least bit.  I can't wait to make and serve this again!

A great crisp!  To increase the nutrient value, I add 1/2 cup of wheat germ, 1/3 cup of flax seed meal, and 1/3 cup of slivered almonds.  It's the perfect dessert!

This turned out great. I really couldn't taste the maple flavor, but it was still a very good apple crisp. I used Jonathan apples from our local apple farm, and tossed them in a couple tsp. of lemon juice. This provided a bit of tartness to the apples. I cut the maple syrup to 1/2 cup because that was all I had left. I used only 6 Tbsp. of butter in the topping.

This is a yummy recipe.  I didnt have maple syrup but I did have a butter pecan syrup.  I used only 2/3 cup of that because I was worried about it being too sweet.  I also only used about 1/4 c. butter for the topping.
Overall though this is a nice change from the average apple crisp.  Its a keeper here.  Great for fall.

I love maple syrup and this recipe is so simple and delicious. Made extra topping. Very sweet, however the sweetness seemed to be less prevalent the following day which made it even more fantastic! 
I'm sure this would be perfect with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe.  I added a bit more brown sugar and oats to make more topping but kept everything else the same.  I also did not measure the maple syrup but just added it until it looked like enough.

This turned out pretty well.  My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it!  The apples became really soft and mushy, like apple sauce.  I only wish that there was more of that great crumble on top!  I will make this again for sure!

This was probably the best dessert I've tried off this site. I brought this to a gathering and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to add an extra apple since I used a 9x9 baking dish. Like some reviewers mentioned, the maple syrup could be cut down to 1/2 a cup since it was kind of runny. The flavor was amazing, though. I will definitely make this again.

This was really simple and turned out delicious.  I didn't have quite enough topping to cover the apples, so I doubled the amount of topping the second time I made it.

OMG!!!  This was SOOO wonderful!  The maple syrup really makes this recipe and the flavor was so good!  I served it with vanilla bean ice cream.  My hubby thought it was too rich but it didn't stop him from eating it!!

Good stuff!  Made it one evening and took it to work the next day.  Warmed it in the microwave at work, uncovered, and the topping stayed crisp.  Everyone loved it.

This is delicious! I had to add about 2 tsp- 1 T of cinnamon. . . apple crisp just is not right to me without cinnamon. The flavors complemented each other very well. Amazing taste for how simple this is to make.

The topping did not get as crispy as I like, I think because of too much butter.  The maple syrup was very good, and not too sweet.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe as written, even reducing the amount of syrup and brown sugar as suggested in Allrecipes Magazine, which is where I got the recipe. I wound up with a good, typical apple crisp topping, but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan. I did use pure maple syrup, not the fake kind, so I have no idea what went wrong. It was just barely ok, not great by any means.

The taste was decent, but the crisp was really runny.  When I read the recipe, I wondered how it would thicken, but with so many positive reviews, I assumed I was just missing something.  Nope, followed the recipe as written and it was quite watery.  Maybe I just had really juicy apples?!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was a runny mess. The topping was nice but the insides did not thicken at all. When I was making it I was wondering if I was supposed to dredge the apples in flour but this is not indicated anywhere. As I made it for a company dinner I was very disappointed.

This was amazing.  I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and I doubled the flour and oatmeal, only used 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/3 cup of maple syrup.  I also added a splash of vanilla to the apple/syrup mixture.  It took about 45 minutes to bake with the added ingredients.  Yum.

I thought the maple flavor would be a nice complement to the apples but the syrup just added to the juice the apples let off and made a soupy mess in the bottom of the casserole dish. This was ok but nothing special.

Excellent recipe!  I personally substitute the regular rolled oats with quaker's maple and brown sugar flavoured oatmeal.  Very good with any apple crisp recipe!

Maple syrup makes this recipe expensive but does little to add to the flavor.  Topping only okay.  Family agreed that they like other apple crisp recipes better.

I cut the maple syrup to 1/2 cup and the butter to 1/4 cup.  However, there was alot of liquid on the bottom of the pan.   I used Fuji apples and I know they are not baking apples.

Excellent recipe; I make this with the addition of 1 cup of cranberries along with sweet apples - everyone loves it!  I also add the cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.

This was the perfect way to use up some apples! I did add just a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping, and cut down on the butter like other reviewers suggested! I would def make this again!

Yum! I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some apples and this was a winner. I reduced the amount of butter, sugar and maple syrup and added a bit of cinnamon to the topping mixture. Baked for 30 minutes. It still turned out very, very sweet, so next time I will choose a tart apple to see if that balances everything out.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as it's missing cinnamon and nutmeg (2 crucial ingredients I believe).  Other than that; this recipe is fantastic!!! The apple mixture is not too "mapley" if that's even a word...but it's a good way to get the sweetness into the apples w/out using tons of sugar...although I'm sure the sugar measurements are the same...the maple syrup adds a great component to this apple crisp.  My "crisp" part I crumbled on (had consistency of dough when mixed) on top of the apple/syrup mixture and I used a bit more apples than suggested but they were small apples...I tripled this recipe knowing it would go quickly! I also added in a bit more oatmeal than called for as I like the consistency of them in a crisp.  The apples cooked perfectly and the syrup did not over power this recipe.  I will definitely be using again!  Make sure to add in some cinnamon and nutmeg for the spice to this great recipe!

I am not known for my baking...of anything! And this seemed simple enough even for me. I got lots of compliments.  The maple syrup was subtle but so tasty. I did cut back on the butter  but only for dietary reasons.

I like crisp, so i doubled the topping, used whole wheat flour and added a bit of cinnamon, oh and i forgot the salt.  It was delicious, crispy.  There was some liquid at the bottom, maybe I used the wrong apples but I spooned it over icecream.

It's a nice idea, but with the recipe as is, it's too wet. I cut back on the butter as other reviewers suggested, and will also cut back on the maple syrup in the future. I am curious if the extra moisture can be resolved by adding corn starch to the apples. I love the maple!

Loved this recipe and so did the whole family. We used our families dark maple syrup (nice having your own trees to tap) and added pecans to the topping.

It was wonderfully delicious.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose, since it was all I had on-hand.  It definitely didn't hurt the recipe at all.  I also followed the recommendations and reduced the butter by half.  All and all, it tastes fantastic but there ended up being a large amount of liquid when it was done cooking.  It tasted like apple cider, but I was pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen.

I give this 5 stars for flavour and ease of preparation. My topping was still floury after 35 minutes and the points were starting to burn. I have a convection oven so maybe I set the temp  too high and thus couldn't cook the topping long enough to become crispy. Lovely flavour though.

Excellent Apple Crisp recipe.  My husband loved the crisp (and he's picky on his crisps (not that he won't eat anything ;)))  I added more apples because mine were small, and a touch less butter.  In future, I'm going to try 1/4 cup of butter.  I found the crisp more tea biscuit like and less crispy as is.

Took the advice of others and cut the butter by 1/4 cup worked out well.  It was a bit too sweet for us so I will cut down on the brown sugar next time.  I added pecans, raisins and cinnamon also.  Very good recipe I really liked the Maple Syrup with the crisp.

I think that maple syrup is totally the way to go when making a fruit crisp. I'm trying to cut back my consumption of pure sugar, and maple syrup is a great option. Very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

There's just something about putting apple and maple together - mmmm!  I made it with a 1 1/2x the crumble to make sure the apples were all covered.  I also greased the pan lightly with butter.  It IS a bit more "liquidy" than some crisps but the flavor is excellent (and I eat it with a spoon so I don't miss out on any of the maple/apple juice.)   The flavors/textures do blend and it does get better the next day if it lasts.  Very easy to make.  A little vanilla ice cream on the top of the warm crisp makes it even more perfect.  Thank you.   Fall, 2010 - I make this regularly now because everyone likes.  Have found that using several different varieties of apples makes this more interesting.  I slice each one separately and then do a layer of each kind.  I've been using some cinnamon as well. About 2/3 through the baking I take a fork and lightly pierce through the topping so a little of it gets mixed into the apples/juice; that way the topping doesn't dry out nor is the bottom too liquidy.  Happy Fall!

I followed several other reader's recommendations, and used slightly more than half of the butter the recipe called for.  After I cut it in, mixed all the dry ingredients together, and dumped over the apples, I found that I still had loose flour in the mix.   I drizzled a little melted butter over the top to make sure it was all covered. The final result was a layer of maple syrup at the bottom, not-quite-cooked apples in the middle, and not-crispy oatmeal mush at the top.  It was tasty, but not what I was shooting for with apple crisp.

I tried cutting the butter in half as some reviewers recommended. I don't think that is necessary. I think I will make this again and leave the recipe exactly as is. I used 8 apples but they were small ones. I also used quick cooking oats. Very Very good!

Because I like my apples a little more tender, I cooked them for a couple minutes first.  Drained them.  Placed them in the baking dish.  Gave them a sprinkle of sugar and poured on the syrup.  Then topped and baked.  Served with ice cream.  Excellent.  This one I'll keep for another rainy cold day!

I had to bake it quite a bit longer than called for - the syrup didn't quite thicken and the topping didn't crisp as I had hoped - maybe I did something wrong.  Great concept though!  I love maple!

I thought this recipe was good with a few of the changes suggested by reviewers.  I used a mixture of gala and granny smith apples.  I doubled the crumbled but DID NOT double the butter.  I used a little bit of lemon juice and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I did not have pure maple syrup so I used a light maple syrup which didn't really give much maple flavor.  I have since then bought PURE maple syrup and will have to try this again--maybe this time adding some cranberries to the mix. thank you

Really, really good!  I added chopped walnuts to the topping and halved the butter as others mentioned. Oh and I used real maple syrup and a few drops of vanilla.

Yes, very good. I did add a half tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and one melted tbsp of butter to cut the sweetness and thickness of the syrup. I used granny smith apples for this crisp, I like the tartness of the apples against the sweetness of the topping. (I used half real maple syrup and half homemade.) I did add another 1/4 cup each of flour and oats to the topping mixture only because it was quite a bit more clumpy than it should have been. I thought about adding more, but I'm really glad I didn't. That looked super buttery and a little too thick for a crisp but it turned out just right. VERY good and a nice change from your basic crisp. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream.

This was SO easy & SO good!  I was a little worried it was going to be watery because I was using thawed apples from our freezer, but I measured out 2 1/2 c. (about 5 apples), and it turned out fine!  Cook time ended up being about 45 min.  My husband loved it topped with vanilla ice cream & sprinkled with cinnamon sugar!  YUM! :)

Great dessert served with French Vanilla Ice Cream. I made it ahead of time and then just warmed it up prior to serving. As other reviewers suggested, I used 3 gala apples, 2 granny smith and then doubled the crumble. I reduced the amount of maple sugar and butter. Even though I doubled the crumble, I used 1/2 cup of butter total and probably no more than 1/4 cup of maple syrup. I just used enough syrup to lightly coat the apples. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumble.

This apple crisp is overwhelmingly sweet and buttery. I may try making it again, however, the next time I will use half the amount of butter and maple syrup that the recipe calls for.

I've always made my grandmother's recipe for apple crisp which used only flour, butter and sugar (no oats) but I wanted to "healthy" it up a bit.  I loved the recipe with the suggestions of using half the amount of butter and cutting back on the brown sugar a bit.  I made it again last night, cutting out another 2 tablespoons of butter and only using half the maple syrup, and adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  As a result, the apples weren't as soft and the topping wasn't as good.  Next time I'll try making it with half the amount of maple syrup and an equal amount of apple cider, and will use 2 tablespoons of apple sauce to replace 2 tablespoons of the butter.  As I said, I did love the recipe as is (with the suggested changes) but would like to cut back on the calories/fat a bit more so I can make - and eat - it more often.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it tasted wonderfully. However, it came out too liquidy and the apples weren't cooked through. So next time I'll cut the amount of maple syrup to 1/3 cup, cut the butter to 1/4 cup, and cook it 10 minutes longer. But the taste is amazing.

Very yummy!  I reduced the sugar by half, the butter to 1/4 cup, threw in 2 extra apples and some pecans.  I also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  I would increase the spices next time.  Delicious!

Very yummy! I also added in a little less than a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of nutmeg - turned out very nicely! I found that the recipe called for a little too much syrup - the first time mine came out very watery. But overall, a great recipe!

Excellent flavor and crispness. I did a little change and added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the apples. Then added some cinnamon to the topping. Served it with Breyers Snickers ice cream...awesome! Thanks for the great recipe - will use this again.

What a delicious apple crisp, my husband and I were both blown away by this. I doubled the topping because that is the best part of apple crisp and I baked it at recommended time and it came out perfect, so if you really love the topping, go ahead and double it!
I used real organic maple syrup and I added some cinnamon to the top before baking and for serving I drizzle caramel on top, if I have vanilla ice cream, I sometimes will serve it with that. I have now made this numberous time, no need to search for another apple crisp recipe again, this is it.

This was pretty good, but if you're not a maple-lover this may not be the recipe for you.  The maple cooks down and makes a sticky, thick coating on the apples almost like caramel sauce.  I love maple and thought it was good.  My husband who is only okay with maple felt it overpowered the apples and didn't care for this crisp.  Also, could have used more topping.  I'll probably use a more traditional recipe in the future even though I really did enjoy this recipe.

After reading several reviews whose authors appeared to lament the lack of maple taste, I decided to use a darker grade of maple syrup.  Typically the lighter grade is what you would find as most commercially available.  The darker variety is quite strong tasting (too much for pancakes) but stood up well to the competing flavors.

The result:  Outstanding apple crisp with unmistakable pure maple flavor.

I used 1/2 the butter (couldn't bring myself to use 1/4 as often described).  I also mixed the dry ingredients (sans oats) with a few pulses in the food processor, with COLD cut butter added right in.  I didn't over-over do the food processor (8-10 1 sec pulses) then hand mixed in the oats to keep them whole.  This way the butter was really nicely incoporated.

How to make it better?  The syrup is a little thin as a medium...I think next time I'll try to add some sort of thickener.  One solution might be to finely grate one sacrificial apple and wring out the fluid (apple high in natural pectin) and then add a little acid to activate (maybe bit of lemon juice / zest...I'll have to test), after pre-heating the syrup.  Maybe this will cause it to jell slightly, making it less soupy.  If this method works in the future, I'll post an update.  The crisp portion was spot on and perfect.

So, all in all:

Flavor 5/5
Ease of Recipe:  5/5
Expense:  $$$ (maple syrup isn't cheap!)
Consistency:  4/5 (a little too soupy in current form, but this is a minor point.  The flavor is the compel

I work in an assisted living residence building and I made this today for dessert, it was AWESOME!!  I didnt change much, just the amount of butter I used.  I dotted the top of the crisp with cold butter before baking.  I served this warm with a dollop of whipped cream.  The residents loved it!  Thanks!

My husband's favourite dessert is Apple Crisp though he's always maintained that no one's is as good as his mothers. When I made this it was gone in one evening and he asked me to make it again for the next day. I just used table top syrup as I didn't have pure maple syrup and the hint of maple flavour was fantastic.

I doubled the topping but kept the butter amount the same and added cinnamon. LOVED this recipe. Thought it was going to be runny but it thicked up. This would be perfect with vanilla icecream.

I agree with some others about halving the maple syrup, I thought it was a bit much.  My wife liked this recipe more than I.   I thought the topping (oatmeal, flour, brown sugar) was really great.  Just too much syrup for my taste.

Fantastic!!! So delicious and partly healthy with all the oats and apples! I too like others reduced the amount of butter to ¼ cup, and increased the oats and flour to ¾ cup. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples. Using 100% real maple syrup and Fuji apples made a difference to me. Served warm with non other than Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. I'll make this again soon as it was well received. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the suggestions of the previous reviews: halved the maple and the butter and added some cinnamon, I also drizzled a few drops of lemon juice on the apples for a bit of tartness, but I still found the apple crisp to be too sweet, I would reduce the maple to 1/4 cup next time and maybe use granny smiths instead of a red and sweeter apple.

GREAT RECIPE!! I didnt cut the butter because the dry ingredients didnt "crumble" and stick together. Turned out AMAZING. My mother in law is probably going to be mad at me when she finds out my wife loves this version better than hers.

This recipe was a real crowd pleaser and I will definitely add it to my list of repeat deserts.  I listened to the advice of others and only used about 1/3 cup of maple syrup--perfect.  And I used 3 Granny Smith apples and 2 Red Delicious.  I am glad that I did because the slight tart taste cut the sweetness well.

I used the apples from our yard, (no idea what kind they are, some kind of royal gala/jonagold mix) and the maple syrup my mom sent me from Ontario, a number 2 amber made by Mennonites, and I have to say this was great. Way to impress the new in-laws! I did add a bit of cinnamon to the topping, because I just couldn't imagine apple crisp without it. Otherwise followed the recipe and wow!

Made this exactly as it says to and definitely need to decrease butter to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. It still turned out good but not crunchy. Very yummy!

I first made this last Thanksgiving and my mom declared that she was throwing out all of her old recipes for apple crisp, "This was the best!".  I did not cut the syrup in half. I doubled the apples & syrup, trippled the topping then added half cup flour and half cup oats more. I believe the solution to the syrup being a little runny and sweet is to make more topping.  I have made this recipe (just last month) exactly by the instructions and the only thing I would change is to double the topping, there just isn't enough of it. People who think it is too sweet must not use maple syrup often. The point of the recipe is MAPLE apple crisp. It tastes just as it should.  This will be on our holiday menu for years to come!

Yum....this was so good. I used Grade A, dark amber pure maple syrup from a recent visit to Vermont. I have to say that I didn't actually taste the syrup, but I don't care because it was delicious just the same. I wanted the topping nice and crunchy, so I added much more of the oats than called for. I also felt that this needed cinnamon, so I used it not only in the apple mixture but also in the topping. Thank you so much, Crystal!

It's so fun to prepare foods that make my diners moan! "Mmmmm, mmmm, yummm, ah this is great.." was the response I got when I served this to my family.  I only used 1/2 the required maple syrup becuase that's all I had.  I didn't find the outcome to be too sweet, as other reviewers did, so maybe less syrup is the ticket.  Don't cheat yourself and use fake syrup; using that stuff might be another reason reviewers are saying the concotion was too sweet. Yum, yum, yum.......this will be a recipe box staple.

My version turned out great. I used 1/2 cup maple syrup, may even use less next time. I made double of the topping, at first, I made what the recipe called for and it only covered half of the apples so I made a second batch. I added cinnamon to the top right before baking.

LOVE IT!!  We only had 4 apples and it was still wonderful.  We did reduce the butter by half and used sugar free syrup.  What a great recipe to be able to make small adjustments and still have a great dish!  THANK YOU!

This turned out just okay - would probably search for a different recipe next time I have extra apples on hand. Although we enjoyed it, it is not something I would make again - far too sweet, and a bit runny.  Liked the idea of maple syrup though.

I thought this was good. I was hoping it would have had a stronger maple flavor.  The first piece was a little runny.  After I poured out some of the liquid, it was much better.  It could be the kind of apples I used.  I did add some cinnamon to the apples.  Next time I think I will add some walnuts to the topping.

Pretty good.  I added about a half a tsp of cinnamon and about a cup of fresh cranberries.  Next time I think I'll add some nuts.  Good basic recipe.

This was so excellent.  I wouldn't reccommend using fake syrup (but then again, I wouldn't reccommend it under any circumstances) and it did thicken up some after it had cooled.  Everyone loved it.

I really liked this recipe.  I changed it a little like other reviewers--I used more apples to make enough for a 9x13, 3 large granny smiths and 4 medium cortland apples.  I used a cup of flour, oats, and brown sugar and a stick and a half of butter.  I also added about 2 tsp of cinnamon (it could have used more) and chopped pecans.  Like another reviewer suggested, I didn't measure the maple syrup--I drizzled just enough to coat the apples.  I didn't think that this crisp was too sweet.  It browned up nicely and wasn't mushy so I think it helped to reduce the butter a little.  I also made a ramekin for my diabetic father.  I coated the apples in a sugar free maple syrup and took a little of the flour/oats/butter mixture and put a little splenda in it.  He really enjoyed it.  This recipe is a hit!

Yummy and Easy.  I didn't measure the maple syrup, I just used enough to coat.  I divided the sugar and used half brown sugar coating the apples and the other half using white sugar for the crumble.  Made in ramekins and topped it off with whipped cream.  I will make this often.

Excellent recipe.  This has an excellent flavour and is really easy.  Everyone I have made it for thinks it is the best apple crisp out there!

I like this recipe but it is a bit sweet.  The first time I made it I used raw apples as the recipe called, but my husband and I didn't like the raw taste of the apples. Second time I made it I cooked the apples in the maple syrup and about 2 cups of water, just until the apples were translucent.  It may not be considered a Crisp anymore but we preferred it this way.  I would recommend for anyone with a sweet tooth.

This is recipe is really good and really easy.  I'd never had apple crisp with maple syrup.  Definitely a plus!!  I didn't use 5 apples though.  I thought it was too many and I prefer the 'crisp' part of apple crisp anyway.  I've used this recipe a few times and will definitely use it many more!

Made this today, i tastes sooo good!  
I did make a few changes though. My spouse doesn't like oats in a crisp topping, so I left it out and doubled the flour. I added 1/2c chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the topping, plus 1/2c dried cranberries to the apples.  
 I cut the maple syrup to 1/2c based on other reviews, but still got a runny crisp.  
Even though I reduced the amount of syrup, I still got a nice maple flavor. Probably because I used real, Vermont-made, grade A Dark Amber maple syrup, which has more intense flavor than lighter grades.  
Next time, I will dredge the apples in flour before adding the syrup and topping. Hopefully that will thicken the excess juice.  
And I will skip the cranberries and cinnamon, as I didn't really taste them.   The predominant flavor was a lovely combo of apples, maple, and buttery streusel.  And that's more than enough.

This is a great little fall dessert.  My dad loves it, the first time it was made it ate almost all of it himself!  I have made this both according to the recipe, or if you want a little extra kick, also added 3/4 cup maple syrup to the crumble and double the dry ingredients for some extra maple flavor.

I added spices--ginger for peaches and cinnamon and cardamon for the crumble. It still lacks flavor, and the peaches were way over cooked and the crumble still not done. We'll say this recipe is a disaster.

Followed a few suggestions in other reviews.   Used 1/4 cup butter in the topping. Used 1/2 cup real maple syrup.  Sprinkled cinnamon over the apples because I love cinnamon.   I wish recipes would put apples in cups of sliced apples instead of "5 apples".  I used some wild apples from my farm and of course they are much smaller than a grocery store apple.   So I just winged it on the amount of apples.   This finished product was fantastic.  I could really taste the maple.  I will definitely make this again.

Very nice, classic apple crisp recipe that is not too sweet. I took advice from other comments to reduce the amount of butter used to make the topping. The topping was nice and dry. Would make again.

I have done this recipe twice now and it is delicious. It is a bit sweeter then I like but found if I cut back on the Maple syrup it is better. I like to use tart apples as well as this helps tone down the sweetness for me.

Really good. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used ground almonds and walnuts instead of oats (didn't have any). For this reason my topping didn't get very crunchy but it was still delicious. The maple syrup was a nice addition. This was sinfully good with vanilla ice cream! I would certainly make this again and make it a point to have oats on hand :)

This was a simple and nice apple dessert (tastes great with vanilla ice cream!).  My only problem was the cooking time.  I cooked it for 40 minutes, but I think next time I'll put it in for more like 50-60 minutes.  My apples weren't very soft and my "crisp" not very cooked after 35 minutes (disclaimer: i'm at altitude--cooking is weird here).  I thought 1/2 cup (instead of the 3/4 cup) of real maple syrup was a perfect amount, but I regret having cut the butter down to 1/4 cup as was recommended by so many reviewers.  Next time I'll stick with the 1/2 cup (it wasn't bad with 1/4, but I think the crisp would have a nicer texture and taste with the full amount).  I also dropped a little cinnamon into the crisp, which I thought was a nice addition.  I used gala apples and those worked fine--next time I might mix fuji and granny smiths and see how that tastes.  I'll be making this one again.

This recipe is absolutely delish! When I first made this  it came out real runny, still tasty, but I prefer a thick apple crisp. So after I chop up my apples, I always use granny smith, I toss them in cornstarch before putting the maple syrup & topping on. It really helps to soak up the juices and give it a thicker texture. Another twist to this recipe I sometimes do is add 2 cups of fresh blueberries with only 3 apples and it is just as delish if not better!! I call it Maple Appleberry Crisp!! Just made one tonight, hubby's been begging me ever since our local farm started putting out the fresh picked blueberries!

Easy & delicious!  The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter.  The 2nd time I only used 1/2 cup of maple syrup & 1/4 cup of butter & it was still delicious.  My daughter said it tasted better warm but I served it room temperature & it was fine.

I have made this many times.  My son just came out of the kitchen after eating half a pan of a double batch.  "It was so good; I just couldn't stop.  My brain told me to stop but my taste buds overrode my brain."  Friends ask me to make this frequently.  I use a little less maple syrup with good results.

This was yummy and yummy both hot over ice cream and cold in a cup.  It helped me get rid of some apples that were rotting!

Although I haven't tried this recipe, my best apple crisp recipe uses 1/2 c butter with 3/4 c. each of flour, br. sugar, and oats, plus a pinch of salt.  The topping does not taste like too much butter.  It's perfectly balanced and when anyone tastes it, I'm constantly asked for the recipe.  Don't forget to sprinkle cinnamon over the fruit, and I also add a bit to the topping too.  CINNAMON works well with other fruits too - you can use just about any fruit or fruit combo in a crisp.

My family loves this.  I use 8 apples and bake it in a 9x13 pan.  I use 3/4 cup each of the brown sugar, oats and flour and only 1/4 cup of butter (to reduce fat).  I cook it about 45 minutes to brown the top.  Don't have any problem with it being soupy.

The taste was delicious...I think next time I will double the topping recipe.  Then put half on the bottom and the rest on the top.  I'm hoping it absorbs some the the liquid.  The ingredients are spot on!

Made this in a 9x13 pan with 5 granny smith apples, 4 times the topping (but only 2 sticks of butter). I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping and walnuts on top of it all. The nuts burned some, so next time I wont add those until toward the end of cooking. It cooked for almost an hour and came out great. Served with vanilla ice cream/whipped cream. Giving 4 stars because I don't think there is enough topping as written and I think you need to add some spices, but a very good dessert.

first off let me say this: I did enjoy this recipe very much. It is simple, tasty and perfect for a cold blustery fall day, but it doesn't taste close to traditional apple crisp (which is what I wanted) but I will keep it for the next sugar craving I have.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit, I used pure maple syrup and it was great, I also used all gala apples because I love sweetness, I did make this the week before and one step I messed up on was soften the butter I ended up melting it that's a no no

This is a favourite in our house. It's so easy to do, and aside from being absolutely delicious, it makes the house smell wonderful! I've never tried with cinnamon, but will try to remember to take that suggestion from all the other commenters.

This was very good. I made this recipe for 6, and it was more than enough. However, I think next time I will add a little more oats.  Other than that, I liked the hint of maple flavor.

This was amazing!!! I was so excited to find a way to cook with my apples off my apple trees (not much of a cook). I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a capful of vanilla extract on the apple/maple syrup mixture! Tasted great warm and topped with french vanilla ice cream! Will DEFINITELY pass this on and keep using!!!

This turned out REALLY good.  I used just shy of 3 lbs of apples that were already chopped, but with skins on - didn't make a difference in the end though.  I doubled the crumb topping and used only 1/2 c butter total.  This dish tastes really good, but there is more juices in the pan than I thought there would be.  It's not all bad, since some of it softens the topping while you're eating it, but I thought it would be more of a "solid" dessert overall.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled the topping and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Had to bake it for 1 hour to get the topping nice and crisp.  My son asked if I can make this more often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS! This didn't have an overwhelming maple taste, but enough to notice it was 'different'. We doubled the topping because to us, the crunchier the better ;) This was sooooo good with vanilla bean ice cream on top! MMMmmm!

Very good apple crisp. Used 1/4 cup butter as suggested by some and the topping was great.  Other than that made recipe as written.  Next time I might use a little less sugar and a little less maple syrup to cut the sweetness a little, but we really enjoyed it.  Easy too!

I read previous reviews and followed what some of the others did. For example, did 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and ground cinnamon, and tossed my diced apples in 1/4 cup maple syrup, and I "lightly" drizzled each plate with the 100% pure maple syrup before serving. One thing I would do differently next time is double the topping as I felt I had more apples than crumbles! Nonetheless, this is a winner. Thank you :)

UPDATE:
I am also a big fan of fewag rasberries and peaches and could not get over how easy this was to make and how delicious the crumble was, so I doubled everything except the butter. I also added fresh rasberries and used canned "light" peaches. The outcome was a nice suprise! I got extra crumble with my fruit :)

I had a lot of apples but no cinnamon. So this recipe was perfect.  I cut the butter in half as suggested by reveiwers and next time I follow the recipe exact cause my topping was a little dry due to lack of butter.

Fabulous recipe..followed suggestion-of mixture of gala and granny smith apples, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and cinn. and cut the maple syrup (used real stuff) in half. Light and simple taste.  I doubled the topping, because I love it!!! So, the butter portion of this recipe worked for me.  Will definitely make again.

It was good, but I couldn't taste my delicious maple syrup. Also, I would go with 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup - it definitely felt heavy on the butter.

It is very good and very easy to make, I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on top and cut the butter in half.... it is a bit to sweet for me and I probably should have listened and cut the brown sugar down a bit..... but still good.... i will make again with a little less sugar :)

Comments: This was a delicious, albeit far too runny.  Perhaps it needed to bake a bit longer, but the topping was already starting to brown, and I didn't want to risk burning it.  Reducing the amount of maple syrup (per others' suggestions) would probably do the trick, but since I enjoy the maple flavour, I'll probably try tossing the apples with flour or corn starch instead.  That said, it was bordering on too sweet, so I'll probably cut down the amount of brown sugar, too.  Modifications: Like others, I reduced the amount of butter by half.  I also added cinnamon to the topping.  An apple dessert just isn't right without it! ;-)  Bottom Line: Although it didn't come out as desired, I plan on making this again.  If the runny juices can be resolved, this would make a wonderfully easy, somewhat healthy dessert.

this was super easy but WAY too sweet, even using only a drizzle of syrup over 8 apples.  it overpowered the natural deliciousness of the apples.   BUT the flavor is good and my husband has gobbled it up.  would probably make again but halve the topping and try for even less syrup for a more natural taste.

My wife and I absolutely love this.  I've made it the past three weekends.  Like some other posters, I've cut back a bit with the butter, and I've added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.  Great stuff.

I made this with honey crisp apples and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  It was SO good!  The maple was really subtle, but added just the right amount of flavor.  A pinch of nutmeg was aded, too.

When I made this it came out very watery and although the apples were sliced thin, not all cooked through.  The only part that looked ok was the topping.

I prefer a more chewy topping though, which this is not.

I had a lot of firm pears, so I used them instead of the apples. The taste was fine, I added nutmeg and cinnamin and cut the butter to 1/4 cup as others suggested, but it was very watery. Next time i will add cornstarch to the pears or apples before adding the syrup. Hopefully this will thicken the juice. I find that real maple syrup and pears are delicious together. My family really liked this recipe overall.

I love maple and this was quick, easy and absolutely delish! The maple syrup(use REAL maple syrup, everyone) imparted a flan-like base and the butter and brown sugar infused this with a rich caramel flavor. I gave just a sprinkle of cinnamon-sugar before baking. The topping had a good crunch to it, too. A perfect autumn dessert.

This was fantastically tasty, I will definitely make it again! 

I followed suit with several of the other reviewers and only used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2. 

I was making this for a chocolate lover, so I added about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to the flour/sugar/butter mixture. It was excellent hot with some vanilla ice cream on top.

It was decent, but I had a lot higher expectations.  Used Pink Lady apples.  Added in Penzey's Apple Pie Spice.

I used Cortland apples for this recipe.  I reduced the maple syrup to 1/2 cup and added some nutmeg/cinnamon to the apple mixture. I substituted the white flour for brown - just to make it "healthy".  This is a recipe I will definitely use again and again when I have spare apples needing to be used (mine were abit bruised - and the kids wouldn't eat them).  Little did they know that the apples in this crisp are the ones they went "yuck" at a few days ago!

This crisp is so delicious and easy to make, it's almost ridiculous. I followed the recipe and had no problems with sogginess.  I used all Granny Smith apples and just poured the syrup on top of them once they were arranged in the dish - there is no need to toss them.  My husband and teenager really liked the subtle flavour of the maple syrup and appreciated the "twist" on regular apple crisp.

Great desert!  I added a little more brown sugar, and I ran out of oats and didn't quite have enough so I ended up using a little bit of yellow cake mix on the top as well.  Turned out really great!

This was a great recipe. I only enhanced it a bit. I added peaches because my son loves peaches and apples. Also, I added cinnamon. Great recipe! Thank you.

Good!  I did add some cinnamon to the apples.  I used real maple syrup. For the topping, I used 2/3 c. oats and 1/4 c. flour (gluten-free flour for us) and only 1/4 c. butter.  I really liked the flavor of the maple and apples.  The only thing I didn't like is that it was very runny.  Maybe next time I'll add a little flour to the apples.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the maple syrup by half, and added 1/2 cup of dried cherries and a bit of lemon zest to the apples.  I also mixed a few walnuts into the topping.  I think it would have been very good without any changes, and I really liked the subtle maple flavor.

Very very good!  After reading other reviews, I modified this recipe according to other suggestions.  Lots of reviewers said less syrup and butter and more "crisp".  So with that info, I used only 1/2 cup real maple syrup and used half again as much of all other ingredients for the crisp and 6 tablespoons butter.  Serve it with vanilla ice cream and it cuts the sweet to perfection.  My family loved it!  Thanks!

In place of the butter, I used apple butter and I also added some allspice to the flour mixture. I used real maple syrup so it is really sweet but really yummy. I don't think I'll add as much syrup next time, it's a bit runny. I add milk to it when serving and that takes a bit of the sweetness away. Will definitely make again.

This turned out great!  I would probably not use quite as much maple syrup, as it became a little runny.  I made it for a party and someone told me that it was best crisp they had ever had.  Was stoked.

I was not as impressed with this recipe as I thought I would be.  The apple flavour was sufficiently strong enough that the maple flavour was largely masked.  As such I was dissapointed that other apple friendly flavours were not present like cinnamon or nutmeg.  I think next time I'll stick with using sugar and leave the syrup for my pancakes, and add in extra spices.

i have used this recipe for many years now, and no matter how i alter the recipe, it always turns out to be a winner.

presently, i use 5 apples, 1 cup of maple syrup and double the rest as we enjoy a very crispy apple crisp.  we used golden delicious and braeburns in this crisp.  we also added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves into the apples and maple syrup.  this is my favorite way to use apples in the fall and winter.  simply delicious!

Slightly too sweet for me and my husband's taste, but still, it had a good texture and if you like extra sweet stuff, this is a good one for you.  I think I'll stick with  regular apple crisp in the future.

It was so so... I love maple syrup, that is actually why I made it.  But for some reason I just didn't love this.  I might try it again with different apples, maybe that was the problem.

The apple and maple flavours went so well together! I loved the delicous topping too.  I served this with some vanilla ice cream after Sunday dinner and my family really enjoyed it.  Next time, as I found it to be a bit runny, I will add a little less syrup(about 1/2 cup)but add some brown sugar(about 1/4 cup)to keep it sweet enough.

I don't know what is wrong with people who think this is too sweet...it is a DESSERT which is SUPPOSED to be SWEET.  If you don't want sweet, then don't make this...obviously, with syrup and sugars, don't expect something mild.  It was great.  I used light pancake syrup (Aunt Jemima) and used a little more because I used a little more apples, but still used the smaller pan so it would be thicker.  Worked like a charm.  I LOVE SWEET STUFF.  If you like sweet stuff you'll like this apple crisp.  Those of you who don't, maybe you should leave out the syrup and replace it with some water.

I should've read more of the reviews before trying this.  It was OK.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon and I still could've added more, as well as nuts or some flax seed for a nuttier taste.  The butter is too much as well, the apples got too soft during baking.  This is a good basic recipe, I liked the maple flavor but next time I will use less syrup, much more topping and less butter, as well as adding some spices and nuts.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a good starting point.

This recipe was pretty good. I just poured some maple syrup over the apples. Probably about 1\2 cup. Next time I think I will use less because it was still pretty sweet. I loved the subtle hint of maple flavour though. Mmmmmm. Oh, and I cut down on the butter too. I added just enough melted butter so that it stuck together a bit. Maybe 1\3 cup or less. Thanks, I will definately use this recipe again!

It was very good, the maple was a little overpowering, next time I won't use quite as much of it. But, I will be making it again.

I rated this a 5 for how simple, and easy and delicious it was. I did double the recipe and put it in a 9x13. Next time I might cut back the amount of butter in the topping. Need a last minute dessert....no problem!

Very good and super easy.  I wasn't sure about the maple in the apple crisp but it's really good.  I didn't use the expensive maple syrup.  My kids prefer the cheaper fake maple syrup.  Followed recipe exactly.  Definate keeper!!!  Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

We liked this.  Like others, i doubled the topping, and added extra apples so i could make a larger size pan.  i just poured enough syrup to coat without measuring.  Nice and easy.

Absolutely delicious! I make "regular" apple crisp quite often in the fall, but this is a super twist to the recipe with the maple syrup. Very sweet, so maybe not for everyone, but my family loves it!

Tastes delicous!  It seems very liquidy for some reason.. not sure if it's something we're doing wrong? But it's still wonderful!

I usually make this for company and it always goes over well. I double the crumble topping. When I serve I give choice of  scoop of ice cream or dash of fresh cream to go with.

I only had Aunt Jemima pancake syrup on hand, so I substituted 1/2c. of this for the maple syrup.  I doubled the crisp and added 3/4c. of slivered almonds to it.  DELICIOUS!!!

I think the topping was pretty good but really too sweet. I had to serve the dish with vanilla icecream to tone down the dessert. The apples were too bland for me. I used 100 % real vermont maple syrup. I think if I make it again I would rather use some white suger for the apples instead. I also added cinnamon to the apples b/c apples and cinnamon go hand and hand.
