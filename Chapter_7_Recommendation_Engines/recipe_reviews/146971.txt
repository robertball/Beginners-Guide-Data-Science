I made this recipe with melted white chocolate and it was really good.  But I'd be absolutely delighted if you could tell me is where to find the white chocolate flavored syrup??? Thanks Mackenzie!

Not a fan of chocolate drinks in general, but white chocolate is something I do like and this turned out great!  Chefsazy - I get my syrups from http://www.guidoscoffee.com/supplies/ Oh, and I would definitely go for the whipped creme option!

Thought this was a great recipe.  It will save me many trips to Starbucks!  The only thing I changed was just adding strong regular coffee instead (don't have espresso) and it still turned out good!

I haven't actually made this recipe but I just wanted to let people know where to buy white chocolate syrup. You can buy it from Cost Plus World Market, Smart and Final, and if you didn't know you can actually buy syrups from Starbucks! (Granted if they think they're too low on that particular item they won't sell it to you since it's taking away from their stock, but if they say their too low I suggest asking when they get their stock shipment in and go again that day!) Hope this helped!

I placed Torani sugar free white chocolate syrup in a mug. I heated and frothed (used an immersion blender) soy milk and added 2 packets of Splenda and poured into mug. I then placed mug  in my Ninja Coffee Bar, cup size, specialty brew and topped it off with fat free whip cream. Really enjoyed this low cal mocha.

Delicious. I don't own a fancy steaming pitcher or steaming wand; instead, I microwaved the milk and then whisked it in a big bowl. 

I also used white chocolate chips instead of the syrup because Starbucks' caramel syrup I bought was disgusting! I am now scared to buy another one of their syrups.

I buy the white chocolate sauce from the Starbucks website. I use fat free or 2% milk for the best foam; I pour the milk into a mason jar  put the lid on, and shake for 30 seconds, remove the lid and microwave for about 45 seconds, and pour it into your coffee. Embrace the foam! 

Yummy! 

Also, if you feel like adding a pump of peppermint syrup (I also buy straight from the Starbucks website), it's amazing!

Made this for my 21 year old daughter. Didn't have white choc syrup, so I dropped in one white choc morsel at a time in the hot coffee (in order for it not to seize), gave it a good stir after each one, and it worked perfectly! I used about 10 white choc chips. Sprinkled some cinnamon on top! Really delicious!

I've made this with Green & Black Organic White Chocolate with Madagascar Vanilla bean....OH MY.  I haven't been able to find white chocolate syrup around me but would definitely try that too.  I used whole milk, no whipped cream - we were happy with just the foam and some more white chocolate grated over the top.  Grumpy LOVES white chocolate and he enjoyed a cup of this with me this morning!

I donâ€™t have any fancy coffee equipment. Only an Aeropress and a micro. So I nuked the milk, added the white chocolate syrup (which I bought from Smart & Final)  and espresso, and a teaspoon of peppermint syrup: viola! A great white chocolate peppermint mocha = goodbye Starbucks. Less syrup  for my taste next time though. But this is personal choice.

I used a double shot, two tablespoons of syrup and a little more than a cup of 2% milk.  It was awesome.
