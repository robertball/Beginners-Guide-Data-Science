A first time effort in making a Banana Cream Pie--glad I chose this recipe. The chocolate crust was different and delicious. I'd use in other pie recipes. But we couldn't wait 2 hours to dig in and the pie "ran", but the next day ---wow.....It was perfect. And not too sweet. 
It will be The Birthday Pie for my husband from now on.

Good but I am not sure it was worth all of the work.  I doubt I will make this again.  However, I will make the crust again and use an alternate filling.
