A very tasty dish that gave life to French cut green beans.

Followed recipe exactly.  Easy to make and delicious.  Not too much butter.  The pecans added a nice crunch.

Nice change from our regular version. I added a little extra butter after adding the green beans and a little pepper too.  it hit the spot. Thanks for the recipe.

Green beans don't get any easier than this recipe.  I don't have a steamer, so I just microwaved the beans, drained and proceeded with the recipe.  I served these with 'Chicken Shawarmas' and 'Good for you Greek Salad' both from AR.
