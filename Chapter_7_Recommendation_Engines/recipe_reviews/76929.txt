The fact that I spent nearly a year searching for this recipe after I lost it should tell you how many RAVES I get each time I make it!  I use whatever beef and pork cuts are on sale and cook them in my slow cooker over night, making it a snap to cook the next day.  This is the ONLY chili my husband will eat without the beans!

I made this last year for Super Bowl and we all liked it okay. I froze what was left and took it out this year. I added  an additional can of black beans, kidney beans, two cans of pinto beans, frozen lima beans and frozen corn. It was amazing!!! I had originally discarded the recipe thinking I probably would not make it again. I was glad to find it again. I would have given it 3 stars, but the second time around with the changes made it a 5 star for sure!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday last year and it was a big hit! The gang has begged me to make it again this year. It's more involved than the usual chili recipe, but well worth the trouble. Great leftovers.

As a Huge chili lover, I have to try this soon. I will however smoke my chuck roasts and ribs and try it that way. I have always used ground beef and sausage in my chili, but this sounds better. Will let everyone know how it went.

I use 2 pork shoulders in place of the ribs, increase the seasonings and time in the oven.  The result is a huge amount of tender yummy chili.  Love this!!

I've made this 3-times and get raves about it. My wife doesn't like the flavor of chocolate in this. One time I made it without chocolate and it still got raves.

I made this for New Years eve and everyone really liked it, but I did add cayenne to it until it had some real bite.  It is more work
than the usual recipe, but with extra heat it is really good.

My husband actually gave it a thumbs up which is not typical of him.  He just asked for it to be spicier but w/kid I have to make it more neutral.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I blended up some cherry tomatoes from my garden and supplemented with a mild salsa.  It turned out pretty well.  I also just used some leftover pork roast and a can of beef chunks.  I'd make it again.

This recipe was a big hit with my Super Bowl crowd. The only problems I had was that the meat was not soft enough from the recommended oven cooking time. After 90 minutes it was still not fork tender so I lowered the temperature to 325 for an additional hour and it worked magnificently.  The seasonings were perfect.  This recipe made a huge amount of chili and my guests were all able to take home leftovers. By the way I made this chili the day before to let the flavors develop and then reheated it in my slow cooker for game day.

I've made this recipe for years and was surprised to find it here.  However, this recipe has some errors from the original published recipe from 2004.  The chuck roasts should be 2, 4 lb beef chuck roasts and 2.5 pts of country style pork ribs....for a total of 10.5 pts of meat.    I generally slow-roast the meat at 300 for 6 hours but cooking at a high temperature also works well if you are in a hurry.    Great for a cold winter day when you want to add a little extra warmth to you house while cooking

This is an excellent recipe! The first time I made it just as it's written to see what we thought.  We absolutely loved it.  I do love the chocolate in it. I almost  didn't put it in, but was really happy that I did.  It just magically woke all the other flavors, and put it over the top delicious.  I made it tonight, and added diced tomatoes because it's what I had here, and also some corn for color and added texture.  I had some cooked leftover taco meat (sausage) that I added as well.  I'm telling you, you can't hurt this recipe.  Just put in what you like and omit what you don't.  Just wonderful!  If you don't like fussing in the kitchen, it may seem time consuming.  I look for recipes like this though because I love to play in the kitchen.  I'm so glad that I  found this recipe!

This is my favorite chili recipe. My kids request it all the time and I recently had to give up my "secret" recipe to my adult son who begged for it. I make it exactly as written but usually double.  I set up a buffet bar with all kinds of chili topping. Do NOT try to use ground beef. I was lazy and tried it. Take the time and use the suggested meats.

I have made this Chili for many years beginning with a Super Bowl party and have reduced it to half due to the volume. Never disappointing and I have eliminated the oven meat cook with the advent of a smoker where both beef/pork receive the added taste of the smoke. Since I like hot spice, I always throw in a Jalapeño/reaper sauce.

I have been making this chili since I found it In USA weekend magazine in 2004. We call it Clint Eastwood Chili because he was on the cover. This is THE best chili, I always get raves when I make it. Its perfect as is and is perfect for Superbowl parties. Love it!

This is the 5th year I have made this chili for my halloween party.  Every year I get asked if I'm making it again. Always a big hit & well worth the time.
