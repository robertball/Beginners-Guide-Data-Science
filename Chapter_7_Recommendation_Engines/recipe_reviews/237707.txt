Help!  Mine flattened in the oven!  These are my favorite cookies but I can't eat butter so I really want them to work out but they got flat!

As far as taste goes. These are in point. I love these cookies cause they are so easy and simple. I traditionally make them with butter, but I’ve noticed that lactose hurts my stomach so looked for an alternative so I could make during the holidays. 

I too had issues with the cookies being crumbly. A couple of fixes: made  a flax egg and added that to mixture, and also cooled the cookies before baking so they wouldn’t flatten out. :)

I purchased a large jar of coconut oil and was looking for a recipe to use some of the surplus. The flavor was good but I found the dough a little crumbly. I added a few teaspoons of water to make the dough hold together, but the cookies were very delicate even after cooling completely. Thanks for the inspiration!

I did not have cake flour, so I substituted 1.5 cups of flour plus 1/4 cup of corn starch.  The cookies flattened out a bit while baking, but I was still able to roll them in powdered sugar.  I had to be delicate, as they crumbled rather easily.  Otherwise, they were good and everyone seemed to like them.
