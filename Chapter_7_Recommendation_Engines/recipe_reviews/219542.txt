I used one package of FROZEN california blend vegetables. This was okay. Seemed to be a bit on the salty side for us. Two of the flavor boost packets was too much for one package of vegetables. I might make this again but I'd play with the recipe a bit.

Definitely quick, but heavy on the flavor...  I used a steam in bag of broccoli and used only one flavor packet.  While it's nice to enhance the flavor of vegetables you certainly don't want to cover them up completely.  Very simple recipe, but keeping in mind that this is concentrated only use enough to taste.  I do like the options in the footnotes to add a little variety.

This was my first experience with the Swanson Flavor Boost Concentrated Vegetable Broth.  As a flavor enhancer, it works pretty well.  For this recipe though, I need to make a couple of comments.  First of all, prepare your vegetables the way you usually do (I believe the recipe notes offer another cooking method, along with options for other vegetables and various add-ins).  If you steam broccoli, continue to do so.  I use a pressure cooker for carrots, because in my opinion, boiling them reduces their flavor.  I don't believe I ever boil a fresh vegetable, so the first step of this recipe doesn't work for me.  My second comment about this recipe is to sample your vegetables after adding only one packet of the concentrate and tossing well.  For us, 1 and 1/2 pounds of carrots only needed one packet of the concentrate,  and no other seasoning.  I believe that two packets would have overpowered the vegetable flavor.  Though heavy on sodium, there is very little fat, so the calorie count is low.

I steamed some petite baby carrots in the microwave for 6 minutes. I let them sit a few minutes, drained them, and then added the flavor booster. I am so glad I read the reviews first! I have flavored many foods with broth or stock, but have never tried this condensed broth before. My honest opinion, is the predominant flavor is "salt." I made 1/2 recipe or 8oz of vegetables. I did only 1/2 tsp of flavor booster for 1/2 the recipe instead of the full pack suggested for that amount of carrots. 8 oz of carrots came to close to two cups, so this stuff is strong. I would not add anymore than 1/4 tsp per cup of vegetables. I thought it would glaze the vegetables too, but it didn't. I added about a tsp. of butter with canola oil along with it and the two together elevated plain steamed vegetables. I may use the rest at that ratio, as it is easy. However, for the sake of your vegetables, add it to taste only. More can always be added, if desired. It's more difficult to reverse adding too much.

I am SO glad that I read the reviews on this before following the recipe exactly...As written, it would've been waaaay to overpowering and salty, just as others have said. I only ended up using  a 1/2 packet of vegetable base, and that was pushing it...I didn't care for this at all, but hubby and little guy thought it was ok, so I would've given it a 3 if the directions were accurate.

I used broccoli, cauliflower, and a zucchini close to its expiration date to get 'em out of the fridge.  I also roasted my veggies before adding the flavor boost.  I have to agree with others - watch how much you add and beware the salt.  As a veggie lover, I like the taste of fresh vegetables to shine.  Unfortunately, the flavor boost overpowers the dish and tasted a bit too processed for us.

This rating was given by my hubby because he's the one who ate the carrots I fixed.  He would like me to prepare these again for him.  I took one carrot and sliced it, lightly boiled it in a small saucepan, drained it, and just barely gave a swipe of the flavor booster over the top of the carrots with a dash of pepper.  It was just the right amount of flavor for him.

The recipe ingredients call for carrots or green beans, but the directions only mention broccoli.  I assume ANY of these 3 vegetables would work (or other vegetables).

This was alright, but far from great. To me it was a little to salty for my taste. I think it would be better if maybe using less of the boost. Willing to give it another try.

I used baby carrots for my veggie. While this was an interesting change, I'm not used to my carrots *not* being just a little sweet. Not for me, but I think others might like it better.

This was the first time I used the Flavor Boost. I never really think of adding broth to veggies. I will from now on! My kids ate them like they were going out of style.

Using fresh baby carrots, recipe was easy to follow. But have to say, it was okay for us, not really disliked but not totally in love with it either.

The package states to add 1 or 2 packets per pound of vegetables, and sadly this recipe seems to have missed some editing.  I used a broccoli, cauliflower, and baby carrot blend, steamed them, and added one packet of vegetable flavor boost.  Any more would have been overly salty.  We did enjoy the flavor it added to our veggies, and they needed nothing else.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise!  It was super, super easy to make and added a nice flavor.  I only started with one packet of the Flavor Boost based on previous reviews and that was perfect for us.  It added just enough flavor without too much salt.

This was quite good.  Definitely quick and easy.  I had to use the chicken flavor as none of our stores carried the vegetable flavor.  DH and I both love salty tastes so it did not seem too salty for us.

I cooked my 1/2 lb. baby carrots in about 1/2 cup of water and when almost done I added 1 packet of the vegetable broth, cooked until done and let it sit until serving. No need to add additional flavorings. Very tasty, and for a first, hubby tried and didn't add more salt!

I made mine with a 12oz package of frozen "steam in a bag" broccoli and one chicken-flavored Flavor Boost. Quick and easy; it turned out great, and I'll make it again on a night when I'm looking for a quick side.

This was OK if you use the Flavor Boost sparingly due to the sodium content.

As written these were a little too flavorful.  I ended up making again and boiling the carrots with one packet and then once tender I sautéed them a bit in a half a packet.  We enjoyed them with the changes.

This was just OK. I took the advice of the other reviewers and only used half the amount of Flavor Boost. Any more would have been too much.  I also found the vegetable boost to have an odd flavor. I think I would have prefered to use the chicken flavor. I even tried drizzling the carrots with a bit of olive oil and topping them with dried cranberries to try and add some "ooomph".  I won't be making this again.

First off, I have to state that I used Chicken Flavor Boost as neither of the two markets I checked carried the Vegetable Boost. That being said, I had a 12oz package of fresh cut broccoli & carrots. Boiled until crisp-tender, drained & tossed with One packet of the Boost. They turned out quite tasty - so I feel sure 2 packets for 16oz would certainly be too much (assuming the Veggie Boost is like the Chicken). So, my advice, try it with the Chicken Boost & just one packet!

First time using Swanson Flavor Boost.  I used it with some fresh baby carrots and thought the flavor was very powerful.  Will probably only use half as much next time!

I should have read the reviews first. Season to taste instead of following the directions otherwise it is a bit too much.

Lives up to the title expectations. I don't agree with the reviews of it being too salty. Don't use canned or overcook your carrots and you shouldn't have that problem. 4 out of 5 because I prefer the brown sugar butter carrots better than this.

The flavor boost for me wasn't enough. I did sprinkle some other seasonings on the broccoli which helped it out quite a bit!

I oven roasted my veggies as I do not like them steamed. I added garlic. The flavor of the boost was good..just not knock your socks off great.

These were really good carrots! I did add about a tablespoon of butter at the end of cooking them.  I really like the flavor booster and look forward to trying on different veggies like zucchini and green beans.

I actually liked this recipe a lot.  I used baby carrots (the recipe calls for carrots or green beans, then says, "Place the broccoli..." which was a little bit confusing).

I thought the baby carrots worked well (I used fresh ones, not frozen) because the salty Swanson Flavor Boost Concentrated Vegetable Broth offset the sweet of the carrots.  I actually have been craving this and I know that I'll definitely make it again!

I added the Flavor Boost to my honey-glazed carrots recipe for Thanksgiving, and it really did wonders. The flavor was rich and delicious.

These came out good! I used broccoli and only one packet of FlavorBoost. It definitely enhanced the flavor! I really enjoyed it!

LOVED IT!  I used a half package 16 oz. frozen peas and carrots and 1 packet of Chicken Flavor boost.  I microwaved the veggies for 4 minutes then tossed with the flavor boost.  It couldn't have been easier and I found it very tasty.  I will make this again.  Thank you Campbell's Kitchen!

These vegetables were awesome!  I chose to use 2 lbs green beans (because of other reviewer's comments) and I added in some sliced almonds to dress them up for Thanksgiving.  The results were fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this with green beans - it enhanced the flavor for sure, but I still prefer steamed veggies, and this made it kind of salty.

Not a bad change for us from the regular green beans but too salty for us. I read the reviews that stated to cut it down, however, trying to rate the recipe itself with no modifications, I'd highly suggest cutting it down for anyone who wants to change it up.

I personally wish I had not read reviews prior to making this.  Because I did, I was afraid the recipe would be too salty.  Quite the contrary.  I roasted asparagus and mushrooms with olive oil and fresh thyme.  I did not season the vegetables because I felt seasoning them would cause them to be too strong.  I will make this again, will not season my veggies, but instead of 1 packet, I will go ahead and use the two packets the recipe calls for.  This is a case of not following the instructions and paying for it by not having as flavorful a dish as I may have had if I had made the recipe as stated.

The kids and hubby enjoyed it, but all I could taste was packaged sodium.  I used 1/2 of a packet of the Veggie Boost to a little over 1.25lbs of baby asparagus.  As a family, we definitely prefer a little butter and garlic over this dish.

This was better than expected.  I used steamed carrots, broccoli and green beans.  I added the Veggie Flavor Boost in increments so it wouldn't be too salty as others mentioned.  I also added Italian seasoning and topped with Parmesan as suggested in the footnotes of the recipe.  This was a quick way to flavor steamed veggies, and hubby ate all of his broccoli ;)

I steamed fresh carrots, cauliflower, and frozen green beans. My family and I all felt it was way to salty tasting and would have been happier with just good ole steamed vegetables. I won't use this recipe again.

These were much better than I'd anticipated, albeit a tad on the salty side (and I love all things salt).  I used sugar pea pods and baby carrots and beef flavor booster since veggie apparently isn't available in my area.  I enjoyed them, but can't see myself making them again simply because there are many other ways to make veggies we enjoy more.  Thanks for the recipe, Campbell!  (I do love the flavor booster, though; my favorite use is when making soups!)

I went to two different stores and couldn't find the concentrated vegetable broth (couldn't find the product at all at one of the stores), so I bought the chicken broth. Like others, I needed considerably less than what the recipe stated, but it's very easy to add to taste preference.

I steamed some green beans in the microwave and sauteed a few sliced mushrooms.  I read the reviews, approached the amount of the vegetable flavor boost cautiously, giving the packet about three short squeezes.  Yes, it is salty tasting, but it did add a nice flavor to the fresh beans.  I think the key here is to just not overdue it.  Start with a small amount of the flavor booster and add more until you reach the taste that suits you.
