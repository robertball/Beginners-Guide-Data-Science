Definitely not too bad for tofu substitute. I am a meat eater as well, this is obviously not chicken. But still a good tasting snack that you don't have to feel as guilty about.

Even though you are not fooling anyone as the recipe submitter states, these still turned out good and tasted amazingly close to a wing. Even more so the next day. You lose the crunch but the flavor of a wing is more dominant. The only thing I would change next time is to double the bouillon. I am not vegan but wanted to give these a try and I'm glad that I did.

These are super delicious! After making them once, I decided to try to make them less 'wings' and more 'nuggets' so I could put them on top of a pasta dish I was making, and they turned out great! I didn't achieve quite an even coating all around the nuggets - if I were to do it again, I would lay down a thing coating of the breading on a baking pan, place the nuggets on that, and then sprinkle the rest of the mix on top to try for a better coating. But they were delicious, crunchy and soft!
