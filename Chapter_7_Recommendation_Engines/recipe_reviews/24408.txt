Good recipe. If u would like to convert to cream of tomato soup: make sure u puree tomatoes thoroughly, reduce amt of broth by 1/2 & then use half & half, milk or Land O'Lakes Fat Free half & half as a substitute for the other 1/2 of the broth.  Tip: The Land O'Lakes fat free half & half is an incredible product.  It makes wonderful cream soups while cutting fat & calories, a great compromise & I usually lothe fat free products.

Fantastic!  I've officially outlawed any canned tomato soup after eating this.  As recommended by several others, I added a bit of sugar to it.  I also brought all of the other ingredients to a boil before adding the cheese, and it melted instantly and completely incorporated itself into the soup.  I'd suggest doing that rather than adding it in along with everything else.  It was very smooth, and the flavors blended well.

This soup is very comforting and yummy on a cold evening, and leftovers freeze very well.  It's a very easy way to have an extra-tasty homemade meal (We had our first batch for dinner with grilled cheese, and had the leftovers today with salad and garlic bread).  My only problem was not being able to get the cheese to completely melt - I used the finely grated cheddar, and even gave it a whizz with an immersion blender, but still had tiny cheese granules in the end result.  No one seemed to mind, though - everyone gave this a thumbs up!!

I loved this recipe, I added in pesto sauce instead of tomato paste. I also strained the tomatoes after pureeing them to avoid having seeds in my soup. I added in some heavy cream for a creamier soup and didn't put the cheese directly in the soup, I let it be used as a garnish. oh and I put in garlic for some extra flavor.

This soup was delicious and so simple to prepare! I cut the recipe in half and followed the advice of some other reviewers by adding 1 TBSP sugar and bringing the soup to a boil then adding the cheese...it melted instantly! I served it with toasted sesame bagels with cream cheese! My husband and I enjoyed this satisfying lunch! I will prepare this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really great.  My daughter and I loved it.  Warning though, doesn't work well in the crock pot.  I tried this and the cheese forms a glob.  Next time I will simply take the time to make on the stove top.  I also added about a tablespoon of sugar.

I halved the recipe and made it for my daughter and son-in-law -- it got rave reviews!  I didn't have tarragon so I omitted that and added fat-free half-and-half to make it a cream of tomato soup.  The cheese melted easily and gave a nice flavor to the soup.  I will definitely make this again.

As written, I give this a three - ok, using canned is incredibly convenient, but the flavor is rather flat, plus the consistency is watery. What I do is to make this when I have a bunch of tomatoes that need using up. I halve the amount of chicken broth, and use the fresh tomatoes (peeled and roughly chopped) with the canned. I then puree it all with a hand blender, and if it needs more liquid, I add more broth. This really improves the flavor. Anyway, this is a good basic recipe to adapt to personal taste. Thanks, Sara!

Sal, this soup was Really good and fresh tasting. I chopped up onions,carrots,celery and sauteed them off. I added a bit of flour to tighten the soup up a bit. I pulsed the tomatoes just a few times to break them down, not looking for a Totally smooth soup. I did take the suggestion of one reviewer and added a cup of 1/2 & 1/2 to it to make it more creamy. I have never made my own tomatoe soup before and now I will be able to do it again, thanks to you Sal. No canned for me!!

Delicious!  The only problem I had was the consistency; the cheese didn't melt in properly (thus the 4 stars instead of 5).  Next time I'll try the suggestion given by other reviewers to bring the soup to a boil before I add the cheese.  I did tweak the recipe a little based on the reviews I read.  I added about 2T sugar, which seemed to cut the acidity from the tomatoes perfectly.  I also used water and chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth, and I only added about 2 cups of water at the beginning.  I added about a cup of half and half to make the soup creamier, and near the end of cooking I added water until the soup looked right.  I doubt that I used the full 5 cups.

This soup was even better the second day!  I, too, used regular shredded cheese and kept waiting for it to melt completely as the recipe directed -- but it would have taken days!  As a result, I had interesting little tiny cheese "pellets" that certainly added texture to the soup but were kind of weird.  Next time I will be sure to use the fine grating attachment on my grater and add a bit of sugar to taste.

I made this recipe and substituted asiago cheese and it tasted almost like Panera's tomato asiago soup.  Excellent! And easy to make.

It is great except that we find it acidy.  We added about 3 tbsp of sugar to smooth it out.

This soup was really good, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was great. If you're following the 8 serving default recipe, you'll need to add about 3 T sugar to soften the sharpness of the canned tomatoes.

I kicked this basic recipe up a bit. I started by sautéing onion,carrot,celery and garlic in olive oil until soft. I then pureed them with some chicken stock and added to the pureed tomatoes. I also dropped the chicken stock to 4 cups and added a cup of heavy cream. I also added 3tbsp sugar and a good shot of Chalula hot sauce. As other reviewers have said, I added the cheese after the soup came to a boil. The cheese blended right in. This is one of the best tomato soups that I have had.

This was incredible, but I used 4 cups water and 2 cubes chicken bullion instead of the broth, and I used 1 1/2 cups nacho cheese and one cube fat free cream cheese instead of the shreaded cheese.  I also added a few tablespoons of splenda.  It made a huge pot of soup.  Way better than Campbells. Wow.

Not so good, too tomatoey, perhaps sugar would have helped. Tried more cheese and cream cheese to salvage this recipe but it still didn't work for us.

Lots of tomato flavor and very easy to make. I used half no-salt added tomatoes and half fire-roasted tomatoes, and that tasted great plus I didn't miss the salt. Like other reviewers commented, the cheese stayed kind of grainy so based on the appearance I probably wouldn't serve it to company. But that didn't bother me and it still tasted awesome, especially with some grilled cheese or breadsticks for dipping.

This is only OK. I followed the recipe exactly, and my cheese never melted completely. Taste was OK, but nothing to rave about. I will probably not make this again, I will stick with the Creamy Tomato & Cream Cheese Soup from this site.

Really great soup.  I use about 2/3 the cheddar then I use about 4 oz of cream cheese OR dollop each serving with sour cream to make it richer!

A very warm and soothing soup that's just perfect for a cold, wintery night.  When I made it, the cheese didn't want to melt and stayed pretty stringy through the soup, but I blame that on the fact that I used mild cheddar instead of sharp.  I'll certainly try this recipe again!

Now this is what I was looking for.  I used home grown tomatoes that I stewed ( using Italian stewed tomatoes recipe from this site).  I didn't add the broth because the fresh tomatoes were plenty watery, so I added chicken boullion to compensate.  I added sugar as well.  Thanks for the great recipe Sara!

Super easy to make. I halved the recipe and it still made plenty so I can't imagine how much it'd make otherwise!  Had a great flavor and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

I thought this turned out good, except that be sure to use the finely shredded cheese.  When we mixed the cheese in the regular shredded cheese it did not melt.

I have been searching for this soup! It was Tuesday's and Thursday's soup at University - my favorite! I have finally found it! Mmmm... I would've gone back to school just to taste it again... almost:)! 

 It is a perfect "Sunday Evening" soup. A big hit with company! I've made a half batch and a full batch and both worked out very well. I highly recommend this soup.

This is so very easy to make and it is simply delicious. One time I didn't have the tomato paste - even without it - still delicious! Takes no longer than opening a can of soup - why would you when this is so easy and tastes sooooo much better. You can use your own tomatoes as well.

It came out ok - I had a hard time getting the cheese to really blend into everything else - I felt like it needed something else to make it creamier.

This soup was all right.  It was pretty runny, and we had to add corn starch to thicken it up.  Could have used some heavy whipping cream to add body to the soup.  But overall it is a decent recipe.

It was not as good as I thought it would be.  I had to add a little sugar and that helped.

Loved this soup!! Added some minced garlic but otherwise went by the recipe. I let it cook on low all day in the crockpot instead of stovetop. Made baking soda biscuits to go along with it. Yum!

I usually hate it when someone reviews it and says they changed everything.  BUT, I was out of canned tomatoes and used Diced Tomatoes with Chilies and Spices instead.  YUM!  Since I didn't know how the spices would work together (with my already spiced tomatoes) I didn't add the ones listed.

This recipe is so good. Made it several times but added jalapeños. You can blend it after cooked in a blender for a smoother look. Perfectly fine if you don't. Serve with grilled cheese sandwiches

Awesome!!! I did add some sugar but that was because I always do with any tomato recipe, helps with the acidity. Will definitely make again & again!

Lovely, quick soup! Spicing was excellent. Mine was a bit thinner than I like tomato soup, so I added a little flour-and-water to thicken it. Or, I could have added a 1/2 tablespoon or so of rice during the simmering phase, and used an immersion blender to smooth it out after it was cooked. (That's a Chef John trick for bisque, I believe.) I grated a bit of Parmesan and added fresh basil for serving. Delicious!

Added a bit of sugar to cut the acid. Brought it to a boil, then reduced to a simmer. Added the cheese at this point, but it didn't incorporate completely and left with a bit of an odd texture. Overall flavor was ok.

I really loved this, but make sure that you really get fine chunks out of your stewed tomatoes because large chunks were not too appetizing with my crowd.  So mix it up good!

My children (22months & 3yrs) are VERY picky eaters but loved dipping bread pieces into this soup. They ate full bowls!  My husband & I also thought it was great.  A definite addition to the recipe box.
