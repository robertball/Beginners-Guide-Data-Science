I substitute smoke flavoring for soy sauce. Been making this a couple years now, and I would have said 4, but my husband requests it so much and can't get enough, so I have to give it a five.

I had ground beef, mushroom soup, and brown rice and needed a recipe to use what I had on hand.  PERFECT!  Was so easy and the worchestershire and soy sauces gave it a lovely flavor.  I did saute chopped regular onion with the beef and added a bit of garlic.  I asked my husband if I should make it again and he said, "Definitely!"

My family loves this recipe. I use onion powder instead of green onions and minute rice instead of brown rice...just for ease of cooking. It's fast and easy to make and doesn't taste like it's out of a box!

When I visited friends in CA over twenty years ago, my friend's mom called this "Slop". I thought it was so incredibly delicious!!!! Years later, it is still a comfort food for me, not to mention quick and easy to throw together!

This was great for a quick meal. I made a low-fat version using ground turkey and low-fat cream of mushroom soup. I used white onions instead of green onions and added canned mushrooms. I also double the sauces for extra flavor. It was served with orzo and fresh cucumbers. 
The trick with this recipe is layering the flavor, I added each ingredient stirred and cooked and added the soup last.

Enjoyed it very much, there was none left.  It was a great "quick" but very tasty meal.  I added frozen peas and carrots to add the vegetable to it.

We have made this for years--but we call it "hamburger mush".  Never thought of using soy sauce in  it before though and like the taste with it in it.  We also add some garlic or garlic powder.

This was an easy dinner, I doubled the recipe and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery. I added 1/2 cup of milk to make it creamy. I omitted the green onions and added my own seasoning blend. I also used white long grain rice because that's all I had. The dish came out flavorful and I would make it again. The only thing I didn't like was the look of it.

I used a mix of regular onion and green onion, and instead of cream of mushroom, I used one of those new mexican cooking soups in creamy tomato. I added some corn to the mix. Overall, I thought it needed more spices, more rice and the corn will be better as a side, as suggested. I will make this again, but not without some tweaking.

This was very good.  Although I did add one can of mixed veggies since what is shepards pie without some veggies mixed in.  I also used instant white rice since that is all I had but I dont think it changed anything.  I will definately make this again.

This was okay to eat one night, but I wont repeat the recipe.  It was too salty and just tasted too...something.  I couldn't really put my finger on it.

I didn't have green onions so I caramelized a whole white onion and then toasted some almond slices (sat both aside) then browned the meat and added all the other ingredients plus the onion and almonds and a can of corn.  It was pretty tasty.

This is a great recipe and my husband really loved it. However I would suggest doubling it if you plan on feeding more than just four people.  I thought it would make a lot, however it did not. I think next time I will add green beans to it, or even ram-en noodles. My husband said it reminded him of hamburger helper beef Stroganoff.

This is homemade hamburger helper. It was ok for a quick fix. Next time I will just cook the rice in with the other. I also added frozen corn and green beans to the hamburger mixture.

This was very good, and easy.  I was happy to find a "comfort food" recipe that included brown rice.  The only change I would make next time is to add some garlic, to spice it up, and something green, like peas or green beans, to make it a meal.  Even so, as is, it's a keeper.

My husband told me not to fix this again...sorry... I think maybe it was either too bland or something. 
He said instead of rice, pour it over biscuits.

It tastes good and it's easy.  My husband and I were just grateful for something a little different than the same old meals.  I think I will probably make it again.  I did add chilli powder and garlic to give it more of a kick.

Good and very filling.  Had leftovers for days!  Will probably make again, but not too often.  Somewhat bland so next time I will probably experiment with spices.

Great dish for kids to help with.  This is one of my favorite dishes from childhood.  Flexible too, I have always used yellow onions instead of green.  The missing ingredient here is to put crunchy chow mein noodles on the top for the last part of the baking process.  We always made it with the noodles on top and it really seems naked w/o it!  This casserole is not elaborate by any means but if you want simple comfort food I think this is the greatest!

This was barely ok. I would not recomend it unless you just need to use up some brown rice. There are better recipes with hamburger and mushroom soup.

My father used to make a similar meal when it was just him and my brother and me. White rice cooked as directed, ground beef cooked and drained, and cream of mushroom soup from the can not diluted. It was always good, filling, tasty. Your recipe, with green onions, sounds better. I'm not sure about the corn, but it can't hurt. Good job

Very delicious!  I used sweet italian sausage and omitted the black beans because my kids would throw a fit.  Added 2 cups pasta instead of 1.  Otherwise followed recipe to a T.  My entire family loved it and we will definitely be making this one again!

I didn't have brown rice, only Jasmine. I doubled recipe (a 15 & 20 year old VERY active kids in the house....they can EAT) and took a tip from C. Kronenberg, and rather than all soy, I did 1 tsp soy & 1 tsp liquid smoke. Family loved it, I loved it....was definitely a low-effort change to a standard pie

I love this recipe for poor man's pie; aka, Shepard's pie.   I like to use chives and basil, as well as salt and pepper to taste.  Yummy.

Loved this dish, it  was vaguely reminiscent of hamburger helper, but yummy  nonetheless. I used white onion as I did not have green onion, I also used instant brown rice. Turned out delish. I did take from other reviews and added garlic to the onion and beef. Next time I will use ground turkey and instead of rice a mini macaroni. Worth making again for sure!
