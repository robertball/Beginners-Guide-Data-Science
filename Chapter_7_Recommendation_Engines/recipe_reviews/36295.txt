MMMMMMMM!  EASY AS PIE! THE ONLY SLIGHT ALTERATION WAS THAT MY PROPANE RAN OUT SO I BAKED IT IN THE OVEN FOR 15 MINUTES ON 400 DEGREES, I ALSO PUREED THE TOMATO SALSA TO MAKE IT GO FASTER.  NEEDLESS TO SAY MY WIFE WAS IMPRESSED.

Loved this recipe...easy and delicious. My husband HATES fish and usually only tolerates eating it. He actually loved this dish and requested that I only make fish w/this recipe!

I used diced canned tomatoes and baked in 350 degree oven.  It was so good my husband and I ate a whole pound of it for our dinner.  This recipe is so simple and carefree it would be perfect for a weeknight, too.

Since orange roughy is so delicate, I put these on a fish rack on the grill so they wouldn't fall apart.  This was wonderful, plus it's quick and easy!

This is such a fantastic recipe! The taste is out of this world and it is SO VERY EASY to make! I'm always looking for a "different" way to make the same thing and this is it! My husband loved it!

I LOVED this recipe with the orange roughy. It was simply and yummy. I used canned tomatoes which worked great, and I used a little more Montreal seasoning than it called for. I tried it a 2nd time with Mahi Mahi and it wasn't nearly as good -- I recommend sticking with the orange roughy.

I'm not a big fish eater but I LOVE this recipe!  I've made it several times now.  When I don't have a tomato on hand I just substitute a can of diced tomatos and its just as yummy.

I love Orange Roughy and this is by far the best recipe I have tasted. I have both grilled the fish, as stated in the recipe, and baked it for 15 minutes. I prefer it baked. This recipe is a keeper.

I was surprised how good this was! I just wanted to try something different with fish and this was wonderful. Used diced canned tomatoes without some of the liquid & baked @375 for 15-20 minutes.Very,very good.

This is a fabulous recipe after a long day.  Quick, easy and delicious.   We are definitely throwing this one into the "regular rotation!"  Made it as is, and the entire entree took only 15 minutes start to finish.  We cleaned our plates.

This is by far one of the best grilled sea food recipes I've found so far. The flavors of the grilled roughy and the salsa blended harmoniously. I personalized the recipe by adding a little yellow bell pepper and cilantro to the salsa, delicious! I also found a side dish here at Allrecipes.com that went very well with this dish, the Zucchini Saute`,(again I added Yellow bell pepper, sliced, to add color and flavor). You absolutely must try the two together.

This is great!!  I had company over and made this for them and they loved it.  Even my husband liked it and the only fish he will eat is fried catfish.

I really liked this!!!  Even my 5 & 2 year old practically cleared their plates!!!  I used a heaping teaspoon of the steak seasoning and I cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes in the oven.  I used a glass casserole dish that I sprayed a little olive oil in.  I then served it over brown rice.  YUMMY!

My husband loved this, the seasoning gave it a good kick. I added mexican corn and green beans for color to the salsa. I also added bread crumbs on fish and sprinkled some grated sharp cheese just before taking it out of oven. This would be even better on a heartier fish.

We enjoyed this treatment of orange roughy. I think it can easily be used on any fish fillet. I used a Villaware indoor grill; it was quick, easy and very tasty.

This montreal salsa is so delicious, it's hard to believe it's so easy.  I have used it on cod, as well as mahi mahi.  I have done as other reviewers and at times add bread crumbs or parmesan to change it up....but it's always a winner.

I thought this recipe was pretty dang good, and my husband commented positively afterwards without even being asked...(no small thing!)  I did change a couple things: I did not grill; I poached using the salsa as the poaching liquid.  I also added some pepper jelly to the salsa-makings, and this gave it a sweet-hot taste that we liked.  Also I sauted some sweet onion chunks in the poaching pan, just for an added vegetable.

I had this recipe in my recipe box for a while. Then we recieved a free sample of Montreal Steak Seasoning in the mail, so I decided to try it, and I'm so glad I did! I also used canned diced tomatoes. DELICIOUS...Thanks!! I've made this so many times now. It's good with fresh tomatoes, too.

My family loves this.  I love how easy it is.  Even my pickiest eater who doesn't eat fish unless they're in sticks ate it.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  Simple and delicious.

Easy, easy, easy and delicious! I was looking for a way to get my husband to eat fish without smothering it in tartar sauce. Well this is it! He loves this dish and so do I. It's now one of our favorites. Thanks!
