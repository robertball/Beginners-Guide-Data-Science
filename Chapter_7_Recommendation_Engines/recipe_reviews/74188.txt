The basis of this recipe is really good but you can go through a few more steps to jazz it up. First, instead of boiling your chicken cook it in a little lemon juice with onion, green onion and a few extra spices-chili powder, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprike. Then, when your filling your tortillas use about a spoonfull of suace to each one. The las palmas sauce is just about the best thing, next to making your own suace. Serve with sour cream on top and your set to go!

Las Palmas green sauce, in the can, makes these taste great. I find other sauces to runny. When I am in a hurry, I cheat and use Rotissere Chicken and it is super quick to put together. I like to stir about 1/4 cup of the sauce into the chicken and cheese mixture. If you want it hotter add pepper-jack cheese.

Simple to make and very good tasting.  My husband wished they were more zippy - we added half a can of chopped green chilies to the sauce, but next time I'll add sauteed onion and garlic too.

You need to shred the chicken after you cook it, then recook in oil, garlic, hot sauce. You can make it the day before. You're going to neeed some onions and black olives. Don't make gringo food.

I wanted to find a verde enchilada dish without using soup or sour cream. This one was just what I was looking for. I did cook 3 medium chicken breast, and I'm sure it was more than one pound, in a pressure cooker with cumin, garlic, pepper, and paprika and diced some onions. Hint: used the broth for Mexican rice. Then I shredded the chicken and added a large can of diced green chilies to it. I filled 10 flour tortillas with the chicken and cheese, which fit into a 9X13 pan perfectly. Used the Las Palmas canned green sauce over the top, also added more shredded cheese, slices of pickled jalape√±os and black olives to the top. They cooked for 30 min. and I let them sit for about ten before cutting them. These enchiladas were so tasty, you just kept wanting to eat them even though you were stuffed. And they didn't even need any sour cream. So much healthier. Thanks Shackl

I love this recipe, it was quick and easy.  We had guests over and they loved it.  I have a picky husband and he loved it too.  
I did modify the recipe a bit though.  In the Mexican culture we don't typically make enchiladas with flour tortillas so I stuck to the usual corn tortillas.  I dipped each tortilla in hot oil for about 20 seconds each and drained them and then dipped them in the Las Palmas Green Chile Sauce (large can).  I then added chopped, cooked chicken (I boiled the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt and pepper), adding pepper jack cheese and a heaping tablespoon of green chile sauce into each tortilla, roll it up and when all are done pour the remaining sauce over the top, and finish just as the recipe asks.  When they were done cooking I sprinkled, from a small can, chopped green chiles and chopped green onions.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Very good recipe but with a little tweaking it comes out perfect.

Instead of Monterey jack cheese, I subbed cream cheese, mixing it with the chicken until it was melted and pouring a little bit of the sauce into the mixture. Topped with a colby/Monterey jack cheese shredded mixture. This was delicious and easy to prepare. I cannot wait to make again. Served with sour cream and refried beans.

This is a great recipe. I use almost the same ingredients in my enchiladas, but i add about a half cup of salsa to the recipe. Here is a crock pot version of this recipe: mix salsa, enchilada sauce (another reviewer mentioned las palmas.. ill second that.. its delicious! each chile verde enchilada sauce tastes different. las palmas is one of the more flavorful ones). so mix salsa and sauce till combined. add chicken. cook on low for about 4 hours. shred chicken. keep on "keep warm" setting for 30-60 minutes.. this makes the flavor much stronger. when ready, follow the directions stated in the recipe. Thanks for sharing! VERY good recipe!!

This was sure easy and pretty tasty.  I used rotisserie chicken, mexican blend shredded cheese and whole wheat shells.  Will make it again because it was so simple.

So, I don't normally give anything 5 stars that isn't completely from scratch.  But I just have to say, this is by far the easiest way to make TASTY enchiladas without that gross cream of ___ soup ingredient. This enchilada sauce really is great!  Perfect for "one of those days" around my house.

I make this recipe all the time. My family loves it...but I too add a couple more things.  I make roasted chicken and then shred. Saute white onions and then add a can of mexi-corn and diced green chilis, and then the roasted chicken and a 1/4 of the can of green enchilada sauce. I then lay a layer of the sauce at bottom of pan and roll tortillas up with chicken mixture adding black olives and chees (whichever you like) mexi-blend is what I usually use. Then pour rest of any additional chicken mixture, sauce, olives and cheese onto top of the rolled tortillas bake and tada...enjoy!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I heated the enchilada sauce, and shredded the chicken into the sauce with a handful of the shredded cheese, and simmered it for a few minutes, then filled the tortillas, pouring the remaining chicken enchilada sauce ontop. I also heated the tortillas over a gas flame to get them a bit crispy prior to filling them. Helped to make the final result a tad less soggy. I used pepper jack cheese.

UPDATE: 10/19/2011 - Made these again this time shredding the chicken (I added some chopped onions and some shredded cheese, along with a bit of the enchilada sauce) --- filled the tortillas, and baked them for approx. 15 minutes. After they were a little crispy, I then added some spoonfuls of enchilada sauce on top, followed by some shredded pepperjack cheese, returned to oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.

Las Palmas green chili enchilada sauce is the way to go. It is delicious! I live overseas & had friends carry it in country because we missed it so much.
I heat my tortillas on an ungreased teflon skillet to warm them & make them softer & easier for rolling. Be careful not to make them crisp.
Also, I do not fill my tortillas too much & can easily make at least 15 enchiladas, filling a 9X13 & an 8X8 pan.
I also do not grease my pans but pour a little bit of sauce into each pan to cover the bottom before I start rolling the enchiladas. I then roll my enchiladas in the sauce & some of the sauce goes inside the enchiladas.

I have made this before and it is yummy.  I use a pre-cooked chicken that I get from the deli if I don't have any left over chicken.  I also mix a can of cream of chicken (or mushroom) soup with the green echilada sauce. I quickly dip the flour tortillas in hot oil, shake them off, then into the green sauce mixture.  Then fill and cook as directed.

Here in Texas we make sour cream chicken enchiladas.  Stir some sourcream in with the enchilda sauce (red AND green) and pour over the top and then add more cheese.  To the chicken you can add some black beans or canned refried beans for extra fiber.  Throw in a dash of salsa and there's your tasty, tangy dish!

Awesome!  This is a great base recipe.  With a few adjustments this goes to super awesome.  I made these using "slow cooker carnitas" from this site (with chicken).  Also added about 1/2 a cup of sour cream to the sauce.  I bought a larger can of sauce for a few adjustments.  It's easier to make the tortillas pliable before filling.  To do this you can add some sauce to a skillet over medium low heat, and then coat the tortillas in the warm sauce one at a time, adding more sauce as needed.  Also I like to add a maybe about a 1/3 cup of sauce to moisten the meat.  Yummy!

These green enchiladas are so delicious! My husband(who is quite picky)told me over and over how much he loved them. I used the Las Palmas sauce as recommended and liked it so much I will not try another.
I seasoned the chicken, added a little more cheese and mixed some of the enchilada sauce in w/ the chicken to make sure the sauce was even throughout the dish. 
Try this recipe because I think you'll be impressed

ALMOST like my favorite Mexican restaurant serves! I used corn flour tortillas instead of flour because that's how we usually do it here in San Antonio. I also chose not to boil white meat (saved it for grilling). It took about 45 min. to boil thighs that I happened to have on hand. I think it added more moisture than it would have if I had used white meat. The corn tortillas were briefly heated on a dry griddle to make them more pliable. I also lightly seasoned my chicken with a little bit of cumin, garlic salt, and pepper. Very simple, very good. Will make again. DON'T SKIMP ON THE CHEESE& offer a side of sour cream :D

My husband and I enjoyed this as a meal instead of going to the obligitory Mexican restaurant for Cinco de Mayo. I used a rotisserie chicken, and the Las Palmas brand green enchilada sauce. I also sauteed a package of the frozen onion and three pepper mix, and added it to the chicken mixture. I then added a dallop of cream cheese, 3/4 cup quesadilla queso, and maybe 1/4 cup of the green sauce to the mixture. Then I finished the dish as directed (but still used quesadilla queso instead of the Monterey Jack).My husband and I both thought it could have used a bit more spice. He does NOT like spicy food, so that should tell you how mild this dish is as written. Next time, I will add some green chiles and cumin to the mix. My husband also thought the consistancy of the flour tortillas were gummy once they soaked in the green sauce. His personal preference has always been corn tortillas. I think he just thinks that flour tortillas in general are gummy, so I don't fault the recipe for that. I personally enjoyed the consistancy, and think the dish came out well. Will definitely make this again, with the added tweaks to make the dish a little spicier.

Very easy to make since my stove is broke at the moment.  I used to big cans of chicken, added a can of spicy diced tomatoes and chopped green chilies to spice it up a bit.  I think made as is would have been to bland for me.

I live in the southwest and enchiladas are always made with corn tortillas. It makes the world of difference!

Very good recipe, but if your making enchiladas they are made with corn tortillas not flour, and they taste better. After they were done i put some cilantro on top of the enchiladas and cubed avocado & half a fresh jalapeno for taste. My bf loved them (and hes not a fan of enchiladas)! Thanks!! =)

After reading reviews was worried that it would be bland.  Made a few changes to make sure that it wasn't.  Boiled the chicken in water with mexican oregano, sodium free chicken bouillon and ground pepper.  At the end when I added the cheese to melt, I also sprinkled green onions on top.  This was hands down the easiest and best chicken enchilada recipe I have ever tried!  We were all fighting for seconds!  THANKS!

i'm giving 4 stars because i changed it a bit (of corse!)i think it would have been a bit bland for my taste if i hadn't.  1) i used corn tortillas, which i charred for a bit on open flame, for softness and flavor.  2)per other suggestions i sauteed 1/2 can of green chile, 1/2 brown onion and 1 fresh minced garlic clove. after i sauteed them pretty well i threw in a few spoonfuls of the green sauce (las palmas) and let that simmer for a bit. then added my 'saute' mix to chicken & cheese before stuffing. 3)after the inital 30min bake, before the additional cheese, i added more green sauce on top because they started to seem a bit dry.  they turned out great and flavorful! will make again

This was really good! I was pleasantly surprised. I used boneless thighs instead of breast so I didn't have to worry about them drying out. I boiled a couple of cups of chicken broth and added chilli powder to it, when it was at a full boil I turned it to low and added the chicken thighs and let them simmer for 20 minutes, then I shredded them. VERY juicy. I also used pepper jack cheese for a little extra kick. I don't care for corn tortilla so I loved that these were made with flour.

I especially liked this combination which has less sodium due to the fact that there is no condensed soup involved!  It is a great start to a lot of varieties of more authentic Mexican tastes.

This a great starter recipe.  I boiled the chicken, shredded it and then mixed it with some sauteed onion and garlic.  I then mixed in 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup of the sauce to the chicken before I assembled.  I will definitely make this again!

I would have rated these a five star, but followed recommendations of others on here.
Used a rotisserie chicken cooked, mixed with pepper jack cheese and hot pepper cheese (for more kick), added cumin, garlic salt, pepper and also mixed in half the cheese and sauce.  Then I filled the corn tortillas with the mix, added sauce and cheese on top.  Cooked 30 minutes.  
This was wonderful. I usually use creamed soup and sour cream, but this was way better.  I topped it off with a dab of sour cream and chopped tomatoes.  Wonderful!!

Great base for enchiladas! I jazzed it up by adding chopped green chilies to the chicken along with some garlic, onion powder, chili powder, and shredded cheese. I topped the enchiladas with more shredded cheese and cilantro. Wonderful!

Loved this basic recipe. I too like to chop chic breast, saute with onion & garlic + mex spices I put some of the sauce & cheese inside the tortilla and then pour over the green sauce & then sprinkle dried cilantro & paprika on for color. I make two 9x13's & freeze one. Why make the mess and not make 2 batches  :-}

This is the easiest and best and most versatile recipe! I wanted the chicken to go farther, so I added some black beans, corn and a little rice to the chicken and some green sauce.  My husband only likes corn tortillas for his enchiladas, so I steamed some of those and used them.  My kids and husband gobbled them up!!!!  I like to make my own sauce with tomatillos -- easy and yummy, too!

I used shredded Mexican blend cheese, shredded the chicken (I marinated it in a Tequila/Lime/Chile mix and then grilled it) and added 2 small cans of Salsa Verde in lieu of more sauce...and made Spanish Rice as a side dish...all in all it turned out pretty good.

I will definitely make this again with a few modifications.  It was easy and tasty but there is room for a little improvement.  First, I filled only 6 of my tortillas.  I didn't want to bite into an enchilada that was more tortilla than filling.  Next time I will use 2 lbs of chicken and will add some of the enchilada sauce to the chicken/cheese mixture.  I might try others' suggestions and add other seasonings to the chicken, top with sour cream, olives, green onion etc.  Easy recipe to tweak to your own liking.

This is the best recipe! I took the adivce of others and added green chilies. I used Trader Joe's green salsa, I thought it tasted better than when I made it with the Las Palmas. I make this almost every time we have friends over for dinner and its always a hit!

I made some changes to this and it was a huge hit for my husbands bday dinner party!  I basically meshed this recipe with the Campbell soup recipe. I used a baked chicken shredded and sauteed it with olive oil, onion, garlic and a little chopped jalapenos. I mixed light sour cream with 98%FF cream of chicken and green salsa and a little paprika and cumin. Then I added some of that mixture with the chicken mixture and a little Monterrey jack cheese. Followed the rest of the recipe as is.  I kept it in the fridge until time to bake, then viola!  Very delicious!

excellent. tastes very authentic and delicious. i did heat the corn tortillas in the microwave to soften, and then dipped in my homemade enchilada sauce. 1 chicken breast shredded was plenty for 10 enchiladas, if not still a little much !

We thought these were really good.  I added onion powder, garlic powder and cumin to the water I cooked the chicken in and then used a little of the broth to moisten the shredded chicken.  I used las palmas brand sauce.  It was good, but not sure I will use that brand again as I noticed it has msg in it.  Used a combination of pepper jack and marble jack cheeses.  Added a little more spice to the dish.  These were really fast and easy to prepare.  Will be making these again using my changes, but I am sure the recipe as written is good also.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My first attempt at Mexican and it was really easy.  A good base recipe.  Next time, I think I'll use more cheese (maybe 12 oz) than called for.  I added fresh spinach to a few which worked were great.  I had fun experimenting and not making all 12 the same, trying adding this or that to this one and that one.

I took the advice of others and added a soup spoon of enchilada sauce to the tortillas.  I didn't have green sauce, so I used regular red enchilada sauce.  I added hot pepper flakes to the sauce as it was mild. I sauted the meat with chili, garlic powder and cumin. I also sauted onion and green peppers adding them to the tortilla's.  Any left over filling I spread on top of the enchiladas.  Turned out very good - will make again.

these came out great. I made my own salsa verde from sratch. I cooked up 1 diced red onion and mixed it with the chicken, along with some salsa and cheese. I topped it all with the salsa and more cheese. Went over well, and leftovers didnt last long!

Excellent. I seasoned my chicken after boiling and shredding adding some green onions and some sauce.  After filling the shell I added a lil more sauce to the meat then added cheese. For some I also filled with olives. Came out great.

This basic recipe is easy and good. I boiled my chicken in water seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder and cumin.  Diced red and yellow bell pepper, green onions and sauteed with some spinach. Added this to the shredded chicken with some of the enchilada sauce. For vegetarians, I sauteed mushrooms and diced zucchini and diced bell peppers.  Added some green sauce before rolling along with non-dairy cheddar cheese. Delicious!

This was tasty but could have used more bite.  Next time I'll adjust it to spice it up a bit.  It was very easy to prepare.  I topped it off with chopped green onions, sliced ripe olives and fresh cilantro after baking for decoration and taste.

This recipe is so easy and so tasty! I have even made these enchiladas without chicken for a cheese enchilada version (I just added a bit more cheese than I did with the chicken enchiladas).

I pan fried the chicken with a large can of medium heat diced tomatos(garlic/oregano flavored). Then shreded the chicken and used both chicken and tomatos in the tortillas which gives this recipe a added flavor, but great foundation to the recipe.

I love this recipe, tonight is probably my third time doing this. I use either canned chicken and brown it in the skillet or like tonight I did the same thing with the boneless skinless chicken and shredded it as it was cooking in the skillet. Added some green chile sauce and adobo seasoning. I also use wheat tortillas instead of the flour or corn. It is scrumptious!

This was a good starter recipe.  But, a little too bland even for my mild taste buds.  So, after shredding the chicken, I mixed in a small can of green chiles and the cheese.  Then I rolled the enchiladas with the mix and topped it with the green enchilada sauce and cheese.  Don't bother waiting till 5 mins before it's done. That just means your cheese won't be melted completely in most cases and your oven will lose heat because you opened it.  It was still very mild, so we will likely be adding some hot sauce to the chicken next time.

This is a great start...but here are a few ways to add some zip.  You can use spicy jack cheese or use 1/2 Monterey Jack 1/2 spicy jack, a small spoonful of canned green chilies, olives add a nice salty taste to it as well.  Top w/cotija cheese and/or cilantro

These are SO easy and delicious! Fast if you use a rotisserie chicken. A STRONG five stars!!! I agree with a few of the other reviews that suggest Las Palmas green enchilada sauce, Muy Bueno!!! I also tried this recipe with lean pieces of pork cooked all day in the crockpot with onion and spices (rather than chicken), very nice :) Great recipe, thanks!

Very good, easy recipe.  The only problem I had was using flour tortillas.  Authentic tortillas use only corn and the difference is taste is very noticeably better.

I actually tweeked this alot because I was short on time.  Used costco precooked carnitas instead of chicken. Heated carnitas per directions on box. Poured a little green sauce in casserole, then dipped tortillas in green sauce a little in pie plate) and added carnitas, refried beans straight from the can, a sprinkle of cheese and rolled.  Made about 12 an put in 13 x 9 casserole and topped with remaining green sauce and more cheese.  Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Family loved it and was really fast to make (like 10 minutes plus bake time).

These are great easy chicken enchiladas. I used a can of cooked chicken, but added some diced white onion in each tortilla when rolling them up. I used two small cans of salsa verde which was plenty for the 6 tortillas that I made. I also added some diced white onion to the top and left off the black olives. I used a colby mont. jack cheese mix. I would make these again!

Very easy and surprisingly tasty. I was afraid that they would be bland because of only having chicken and cheese on the inside, but that was not an issue at all. The enchilada sauce gave them great flavor. I took others' advice and used rotisserie chicken and heated the tortillas before working with them. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is very good as is but it can also be a start for some of us.  I combined many reviews with this recipe!  I boiled the chicken in water with about 2 lemons cut in quarters (squeezed out the juice and place the quarter in the water), seasoned salt, chopped onion, chilli powder and pepper.  The chicken tasted great after that. ( Gotta create a recipe)  Anyhow, I toasted my flour tortillas on a flame for about 5 seconds a side.  Coated them in green sauce and filled them with cream cheese, lots of chicken mix with boiled chopped onions and monterey jack cheese and rolled them up.  After that I poured green sauce over them and topped with Colby, Monterey,and a lil cheddar cheese.  Sour cream and Guac on the side to compliment  Side effect:  Delicious mom!

I love these, although I love them with red enchilada sauce better.  We tend to break up a four pack of chicken breasts.  We usually grill two breasts for topping on pasta and then we boil the other two to use for these.  Works great, and then you can boil the chicken and use it the next day or day after.  DEFINATELY ADD SAUCE INSIDE the tortillas.  It makes a huge difference!!  Using 2 chicken breasts we usually can make about 8 enchiladas.

quite good and easy to make...i cooked chicken breasts and then shredded them but i imagine canned chicken would work just as well and be quicker and cheaper....

i added sauteed onion, garlic and green pepper...was going to add a jalapeno but i'm glad i didnt! the sauce was spicy enuf! had i added more than the salt/pepper it would have been too spicy for the kids...

all in all we really enjoyed this recipe!
Thanks!

Pretty good, considering how easy it is.  We used red sauce because that's all Trader Joe's had, and also added a little bit of sour cream inside each tortilla.  This is nothing spectacular, but it's good for a quick easy meal you can have on hand. Thanks!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. The only change we made was adding some of the green sauce inside with the chicken and cheese. Really tasty and easy! Thank you!

I bought the las palmas sauce that other reviewers recommended. Didn't realize until I got home that it has MSG in it. Bummer! Still my family loved the dish (I seasoned and saut√©ed the chicken per other reviews and added a little sour cream under the cheese as well as some green chilis). I will definitely make this again assuming I can find some sauce without MSG.

I made this tonight for dinner.  I used leftover baked chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It went together very quickly.  It was wonderful!  I thought I would have enough for someone to have lunch the next day, but we loved it so much we finished it off.  This recipe has already gone into my recipe box.  It's definitely a keeper!

Slightly underwhleming.  I appreciated that there was no sour cream or cream cheese in the recipe, but it wasn't very tasty.  Probably good for children, but not someone who wants authentic flavor.

Great base for a recipe. Try boiling the chicken for 18 minutes with some "Slap yo Momma" seasoning. We use it in our crawfish boils.Low sodium and good and spicy. Also add in some sour cream to the chicken fillin' and top with sliced black olives. You talk about good!!

This recipe was simple and great. I added sour cream to the filling, and poured just a little sauce in the bottom of the pan. They were a big hit with my husband and very picky son.

Wow. Probably the best recipe I have found on this site. Whole family loves it. I used Las Palmas sauce as suggested. I did add a little extra cheese on top.

I added green chiles and spices such as cumin and garlic, but we still found these enchiladas slightly bland.  Perhaps it is because we live in Arizona and are used to mexican and new mexican cuisine.  They were okay but would not make this recipe again.

Super easy and very good.  I did throw in some spices when cooking the chicken (chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper).  I also halved the cheese and used the larger 28 oz can of sauce.  Lastly, I always use corn tortillas for enchiladas -12 will fill a large dish.  Served with black beans.  I will definitely be making this one again!

My twist on this: After chicken is cooled and shredded, I used Kirkland(Cotsco) brand salsa and mixed it in with the chicken as well as a little of the green sauce and a little cheese. I also, before rolling enchiladas up, put green sauce on a plate and dipped tortillas in the green sauce before stuffing and rolling.

Great base recipe!  I love the green sauce instead of the red.  You can afford to jazz this up a bit if you try it.  I shred rotisserie chicken and saute it with a salsa of my choice.  Sometimes I add green chiles to the mixture as well.  I serve mexican corn on the side.

I was afraid the filling was going to be too bland, but once again, I've learned that simplicity often makes for the tastiest food. I doubled this recipe and froze a batch for later. They freeze beautifully and may actually even be better. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

This was so easy to make, which is always a plus, and my husband really liked it!  I sauted the chicken with garlic, onion and some spices.  I also took others' recommendations to add a bit of sauce to each of the enchiladas before rolling them.  I'd make this again!

10 STARS!  As suggested I used Las Palmas brand enchilada sauce and corn tortillas- dipping them in hot oil is the key.  Instead of Montery Jack, I used Sargento brand 4 Mexican Cheese reduced fat- about 12 ounces.  I poached the chicken in my slow cooker and used thighs- to this I added approx 1/2 c lite sour cream and 1 c Rosarita brand no fat refried beans.  This recipe is out of this world- 5 people ate the who thing in one sitting!  Best enchiladas I ever made!!

This had a good flavor. The grocery store only had the green sauce in the yellow can and it was way too mild. Next time i will try a different sauce. Very quick and easy.

These were great enchiladas.  I did substitute pepper jack cheese for the Monterey Jack.  It did make it a little spicier, and no extra work.

El Pato has a new green sauce that is wonderful.

Add cream cheese to this to make it exceptional!  Cook the chicken in low sodium chicken broth, then after it cools, dice or shred and add cream cheese to the chicken along with spices of your choice and heat in a skillet until cream cheese melts.  Then fill with corn tortillas, not flour for a much better taste!  Before filling the corn tortilla, dip it in hot, hot oil for about 5 seconds to soft it up.  Every time I make these I get at least 10 people that want the recipe.  I also prefer Old El Paso green chile enchilada sauce.  Enjoy!

I changed this up quite a bit, based on what I had on hand. I sauteed a small white onion & 4 cloves of garlic. Added ground turkey, cooked & drained. Sprinkled with cayenne pepper, chili powder, and cumin. Put that mixture in 8 medium sized whole wheat tortillas along with spoonful of Las Palmas green enchilada sauce & monterey jack cheese, and chopped, pickled jalapeno peppers for a jolt. Topped with more sauce before baking and finally, the cheese. Served this with refried black beans and roasted corn. Hubby said this must be added to our dinner rotation! I will definitely be making this regularly!

That was wonderful! I took the advice from some others and cooked the chicken in onions, paprika, garlic. I added more green chiles to the green sauce. Then added pepper jack cheese to the monterey jack. Topped with olives and sour cream when it was done and had my family coming back for seconds.

This is a really basic recipe.  You can add a few things to make this even more delicious without complicating things too much.  I boil the chicken with peppercorns, a halved lemon, and a quartered yellow onion.  I mix the shredded chicken with half the can of enchilada sauce, a small can of diced green chilies, the onion cooked with the chicken, and PEPPERJACK cheese and use that to fill my tortillas (I use corn instead of flour). The rest is the same.  Here is a good tip, this is a good dish to assemble, then bake later.  It always turns out, I left the chicken out of some and my vegetarian loved it too.  I serve with ‚ÄúMexican Rice II.‚Äù  Mmm Mmm.  Enjoy!

Great recipe, i did tweak it to the tastes in our family, i made my own green sauce using tomatillos,fresh garlic,serrano chilies and cillantro. I added a can of diced green chilies to the shredded chicken and used pepper jack cheese instead of regular jack,they were spicy and delicious, i have made them with both flour and corn torts, and making my own sauce is a plus because the tortillas tend to absorb the sauce that comes in a can, when making your own sauce its easier to control the consistancy of the sauce so  they don't become dry later on. My hubby enjoys them the next day as well!

This is a very simple traditional recipe! very hard to improve on the classics, but my family always preheats the sauce in a medium sauce pan with a small can of cream of mushroom until sauce thickens. this eliminates the need for a specific brand of green sauce. if you do not like the cream of mushroom just preheat whatever brand of sauce you are buying. it will thicken making it easier to work with.

So simple & my 6 year old loved it!. I really can't ask for more than that. I added black olives on top, & I will probably add black beans in with the chicken next time.

Very Good recipe.  I shredded Rotissiere chicken and filled the enchilada instead.  I also mixed in some green chiles which added a nice extra to the filling.

Use corn tortillas that are heated in a little oil.  Also make a roux of flour and oil to cook the green sauce in.  Makes the sauce less watery and gives a great depth of flavor.  Well worth that little extra step.

This is such a good basic recipe for Enchiladas. I added a few things to it. When I boiled the chicken I added jalape√±os, a diced red bell pepper, cumin, garlic salt, chili power, pepper, and cayenne pepper. When the chicken was done, I strained it all so that I could still use the jalape√±os and the peppers in the enchiladas. I then combined the jalape√±os, bell pepper, diced tomatoes, green peppers, black beans and olives in a bowl. I used corn tortillas because they tend to not be as soggy. I put the veggie mixture in the tortilla first, then some cheese, and then the shredded chicken. All the veggies that did not fit in the tortillas, I just put on top of the enchiladas. I then put las palmas green enchilada sauce on top because I saw another reviewer recommended that brand, and I baked it as recommended. It was really good and had fantastic flavor throughout the dish not just in the chicken. It has been a favorite with guests. I might add some corn in the mixture next time as well. I will definitely make again. This is a good basic recipe, especially if you enjoy experimenting with the texture and taste of a dish on your own.

A rotisserie chicken shredded , chopped, easy peezy. 28 oz. can of Las Palmas green or red enchilada sauce. Add 2 diced green chili's, diced onion, and good shakes of ancho and chipotle chili pepper. heat in big skillet w/little olive oil. Add 8 oz. cream cheese. Spoon into corn or flour tortillas, i do both, with shredded cheese. Spray 8x13 casserole dish, add small amount of enchilada sauce first so tortillas don't stick. Lay enchiladas seam down and fill dish. Add more cheese please and cover with rest of sauce. 30 min. in oven @ 350 and i like to brown the top under the broiler a few min. Rosarita refried beans and Rice a Roni, mexican style, all topped w/ chopped spanish queen olives, more cheese? Why not? And Juanita's tortilla chips on the side.  Couldn't be eaiser, will taste better than resturant , and feed 6 or more for $15. Add different amounts of ingredients to make it your own. Wife and kids love it!

The chicken was bland even with added spices (boiling did that) and the flour tortillas ended up mushy. I should have used my instinct and used corn tortillas instead. Next time I will also fry the chicken with spices before shredding. This recipe just needed a lot. Very surprised by its high rating!

Will definitely make again and again. SO easy, SO quick and SO good for a quick "fix" when you just "need" enchiladas.  I roasted my chicken breasts but will also use rotisserie chicken from the store as well. I think there's more flavor when you roast them vs. boiling. Thank you for the recipe but also the method!

(Note to self - try with carnitas.)

I made recipe as is except that I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used Cheddar instead.  Hubby raved and raved while eating it.  He asked that I include this in our rotation of meals.  It was excellent and easy to make.  Hubby liked his cooked longer so that the tortillas were a little crispy, so I raised the rack and temp to 400 degrees for an additional 20 minutes.  Yummy!

The initial recipe seemed a little to basic for my tastes so I followed some of the suggestions that  raishelle made in their review regarding cooking the chicken.  Definitely do not boil the chicken.  It is much better to cook it in a pan with the onion (I omitted the onion), lemon juice and some chili powder.  Also, more importantly for my tastes, I shredded the chicken in a large bowl then mixed in two cans of mild green chiles and a can of sliced black olives.  I do plan to make this again but with some extra suggestions from the Mrs.  I'll be using two cans of hot green chiles next time and instead of Monterey jack cheese, I will substitute pepper-jack cheese.  These all go into the bowl of shredded chicken.   Just as raishelle stated in their review, use Las Palmas Green Enchilada sauce and don't be shy about adding it to the insides of each enchilada before you roll them up.  Buy extra if you need to since the chicken may be dryer than you anticipated.  Definitely you'll want to pour lots of the enchilada sauce on the top along with lots of cheese and olives.  We stay away from onions in this household but they would also add to the zip in the flavor.  Overall, the initial recipe was a good starting point and with a few easy modifications, this recipes turns into a 5 star meal.  Don't for get the frijoles and Mexican rice as the sides!!

This was easy and good. I added some whipping cream to the green sauce.   Put a little of sauce inside each tortilla (about a tablespooon.  Topped with some sliced black olive for color and sour cream on the side. Goes well with a green salad as a side or s skirt steak.

I doubled the recipe because I was serving a group from church.  I also used steamed corn/flour tortillas and Mexican blend cheeses.  I did not have any leftovers!!!  They were served with Spanish rice,  charro beans , bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos and guacamole.  I will be making this recipe over and over again since my son is a fan of Mexican food.

Very easy especially using canned sauce.  I de gringo'd it a bit by adding some flavor ie: Peppers, onion,garlic,  cumin, etc.   I also made my own tortillas because I was too lazy to go to the store.   Note:  to the lady offering the Crock pot option - that's a good idea but to leave the mixture to sit even longer so the flavors will blend seems redundant as they have already been blending  for the last 3-4 hours.

I made with rotisserie chicken, cheddar cheese and mixed  in black olives. The family LOVED it! Made 2 with portobello mushrooms for my husband and he loved them. I garnished with lots of cilantro and spicy habanero salsa. Will make this a regular meal. So easy and delicious

Yummy and easy to make. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth and added some cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and a little chipotle to give it a bit more flavor. Was a hit for my family.

Loved it!  Only made 6 tortillas, used leftover turkey, added chopped olives and onions to top and will use 3 packages of sauce next time.

I made this recipe with a few additions.  I added saut√©ed onions and peppers as well as canned greened chilies to the chicken mixture.   Cumin and fresh garlic salt instead of garlic.  I was surprised how well the flour tortilla held up in the sauce. Absolutely delicious.

Made this! I did a 4 star since I did some modifications because otherwise the recipe just seems too bland and non enchilada like... I cooked the chicken with hot sauce, onions, and garlic like someone had mentioned in the comments. I then added olives on top and inside the enchiladas, and I just added cheese in the beginning and didn't melt it at the last second since there's no need to and I just cooked it for 35 minutes straight. Was delicious!! First time making them and I'm so happy I tried this. :) Cannot wait to make for the husband.

Loved this recipe!! I did change a few things to jazz it up.. I used corn tortillas instead or flour... I cooked the tortillas in the same olive oil I used to saut√© the veggies .. I saut√©ed onion, peppers and jalape√±os to add flavor to the chicken breast.. Along with topping it with some green chilies!! Pepper jack cheese made it amazing!!

I did warm up the shredded chicken with some garlic & hot sauce, then mixed in a bit of cream cheese, so adapted the recipe a bit, but it was absolutely delicious! Served with sour cream, chopped onion, and sliced black olives.

I appreciate having this recipe to use the canned Green Enchilada sauce rather than making it homemade for a weeknight dinner.  However I did make a few changes to improve the dinner which I'll note here.  I used Corn Tortillas and Pepper Jack Cheese which added a nice kick.  Also I heated some sauce in a small skillet and dipped each tortilla into it on each side before filling it with the chicken and cheese (and cumin seasoned) mixture.  Also there is nothing wrong with using a Rotisserie Chicken, the chicken is moist and flavorful and saves some time and clean up.  Instead of greasing my large glass baking dish I spooned some enchilada sauce on the bottom.  I served them with a plate of shredded lettuce, cilantro, chopped tomatoes and avocados, and a bowl of black beans.  Everyone loved it!

A simple recipe that can be awesome with a few extra ingredients. I made these at my fire station and managed to feed 4 hungry firefighters who were cleaning their plates afterwards and looking for more. I added an onion and some cilantro for a little more flavor which made this is a real winner. I have had people ask me for this recipe several times.

I used pepper jack cheese sliced thin, and added 1 homegrown jalapeno pepper to the chicken. This was smoking hot. I only had mozzerella and six italian cheese blend, but that was fine. We only had Old El Paso 28 oz green enchilada sauce available, but it was good. The package of tortillas had 8 in it, so the individual enchiladas were very big. Still, even though I overdid it on the heat, they were great. Easy to make, and very good.

These were la bomba! Used Las Palmas green enchilada sauce, first cooking the chicken as another member had suggested...with herbs, onion and garlic. Also sauted diced zucchini and added that. Used less cheese, and a lite mexican variety from Trader Joes. So good!

These were excellent. The only change that I made was that I put sauce inside the tortilla as well as coating the outside. I also added olives and used the large burrito size tortillas instead the 10in ones. I also cheated and bought a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling the chicken! they are also excellent with turkey, instead of chicken

I have made this 3 times now and it is a constantly requested dish both at home and at work.  I use the Chi-Chi's pre-shredded chicken in taco seasoning and add onions and jalapenos.  I also use a combination of Monterey jack / Pepper jack cheese to add extra kick.

Super good!  Here were my mods: used 4 cups of cheese (3 in the filling, 1 to top), added 1 T minced garlic, 1/2 cup enchilada sauce and 4 oz diced green chiles to the filling, and topped with a large can of sauce (32 oz?).  I made the tortillas using the whole wheat recipe on this site (which I highly recommend).  Even my picky brother loved them, and my hubby thinks they're the best.  These were by far the best enchiladas I've ever made!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe, especially for picky eaters.My daughter who's diet mainly consists of top ramen and hot dogs even ate it and liked it. The best part was how simple it was to make.

I was skeptical considering the simplicity, but they were very good.
