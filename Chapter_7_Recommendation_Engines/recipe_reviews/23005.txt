This is the best - we had this in school when I was growing up and I've been trying to recreate it forever. The day we had this was always my favorite! It's great without the nuts too! (they didn't put nuts in in school because of potential allergies) It sounds simple, but try it, it's yummy!

This was delicious!  I had to alter it a bit - I used instant pudding, so I had to melt the marshmallows before mixing them in, then I also added an extra half a cup that wasn't melted.  I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I used tidbits, and everything was so good!  I wish I would of doubled it, between my 3 daughters and I we devoured it all in one sitting!

I thought this was tasty.  You can really vary the recipe too...add a touch of lemon or throw in a few cherries.  This can also be made lighter by using sugar free, fat-free ingredients, but still tastes great.

Though I tweaked it a bit (I added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg), I have searched for the perfect rice pudding recipe forever - seriously the best rice pudding I've had since I was a kid. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!

my family loved this, but i thought the pineapple was overwhelming.  i think i was expecting something closer to rice pudding than what this recipe offers.  it's still pretty good though !

This was awesome! I made some modifications for our family's taste buds. We did not add pecans as we are not nuts people. I also did not add as much pineapple and added the marshmallows whole. I tossed in some coconut and it was delicious!Thank you.

This should be called pineapple rice dessert because that is all I could taste.  I liked the marshmallows being mixed in the pudding but did not like the pineapple taste or texture. Will not make again.

Very good.  To make it a little healthier, I used fat free pudding and fat free milk and no one even noticed.  I'll definitely make it again.

made it with vanilla flavored rice milk, instant vanilla pudding, and skipped the marshmellows. it was a bit too sweet for me, but the rice-pineapple-fresh pecan combo was amazing! ill probably make this again without pudding and milk.

It was just awful for me. Couldn't taste the rice because the pineapple was overwhelming.  Won't be making it again, sorry.
