The taste of these bars was good but I feel the amount of ingredients are not sufficient for a 9 X 13" pan.  I really had to spread the crumb mixture thinly and then had a problem getting the coconut/milk mixture to spread on top of it.  I ended up using almost 2 cups of morsels to make a decent layer of chocolate and I spread the nuts on top.  I would make them again but would try using a 10 X 13" jelly role pan.  You may have to check for baking times with this alteration.

I've been making these for 20 years! You don't need the white sugar in the crust, it is overkill. I've always doubled the toppings. Those can be changed to suit your own tastes. Use butterscotch, peanut butter, or milk chocolate chips for a different taste. I usually use pecans but almonds and walnuts are great too. Make your life easier by lining the pan with aluminum foil. Let the bars cool after baking, then just lift them out.

Love these, but they are very rich. Went with the advice of others and used a smaller pan, which did made them thicker bar.  Next time I may not use a whole of sweeten condense milk to cut down a bit on the richness.

I did use a smaller pan 7x10 brownie pan and I thought the height of the bar was good thanks to previous reviews. I used graham crackers that had sugar on them so I reduced the sugar by 1/2. Using a butter knife helped spread the cond. milk mixture. The chocolate chip layer did not harden up very fast at all, even outside in 35* weather. But eventually got there.

I think these bars tasted great also, however, based on Julies review, I doubled the whole recipe. The crust was then too think. Everything else was nicely proportioned when it was doubled, but i would make just a little more crust if the regular amount isnt enough. But i would still double the middle and top part. It is very sweet. Thanks for the recipe

I had a half of can of sweetened condensed milk to use up.  This was a nice recipe to use it on.  They are VERY rich, so I'm glad I only made a small pan.  I took them to Girl's Night Out and they all enjoyed them.

The sugar  was not needed, too much crust or not enough chocolate.

WadieS is right.  I have been making these for more than 30 years.  Walnuts work fine.  Hazelnuts are excellent, also.  The butterscotch is grand.  Of course, I am a chocoholic so I prefer chocolate.  I live in  Senior Citizen housing and, although I am almost 80, I bake for many people here.  I make these four or five times per year.

Made these for my brother-in-law's surprise party and there were such a hit! So many people asked for the recipe! I made exactly as written and yes they were a bit on the thin side but they are so rich you really don't need them much thicker. Will make these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Love these! I took them to an event and had several ladies ask for the recipe, my husband absolutely loved them as well! I did notice that the ingredients were a little scarce for the 9x13 size pan. This time I will try a smaller pan, or maybe I'll just double the recipe, I want to make sure I have enough as they disappear fast :)

These were a bit too gooey for me. I like a truer bar form because these were just too messy.

Easy to follow.  I would increase the amount of chocolate chips.  I would also spread the chocolate first and then sprinkle the nuts over all.

we liked these bars; they are rich so no problem with the thickness. It's certainly true that if you want thicker bars you'll have to double the amounts. We didn't use nuts as we have an allergy problem at home but my family didn't miss the nuts!!

This recipe really needs to be doubled for the 9x13 pan, or use a smaller pan (especially to look like the photo)!  Other than that, it is so much better than the Magic Cookie bars mentioned in another rating.  I will make this again!
