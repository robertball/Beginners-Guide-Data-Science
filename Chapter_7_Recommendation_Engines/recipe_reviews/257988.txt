Good basic base.  First time I made these was much better using highly flavored chicken taco meat..(chicken tenders cooked stove top with taco seasoning pack).  This time I used rotisserie chicken (in pic) and really had to pour on the lime juice and spicy pico de gallo.  I also just used avocado slices.  As a previous reviewer stated..you definitely should use seasoned meat!

Nice use of leftovers--I used cilantro lime chicken from this site. I liked this taco with its toppings as a change from the traditional lettuce tomato shredded cheese etc. that I usually use.

I like carnitas in my street tacos but the chicken worked well. Will make again when I have left over chicken.

The recipe submitter mentioned in the footnotes that steak or pork could be used instead and that is what I did. I had leftover steak and onions from another recipe so it worked out perfectly. This is a good recipe. Basic but good. The one important thing to know is that whichever meat you use it HAS to be seasoned first. If you just boil a chicken breast in water and chop it up to use for this you will be very disappointed. I prefer using grilled chicken or steak that has been marinated in Sazon and Corona but any of your favorites will work.
