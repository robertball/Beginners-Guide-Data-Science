OK, here's my "improvements".  I used basalmic vinagar, and here's the best part...craisins!  They make this really, really special. I got this recipe from a close friend which included the craisins.  Also, per her suggestion, I "melted" the vinagar with 3Tblsp. sugar in the microwave before adding the mayo.  Makes for a smoother dressing. I promise, those little cranberries make the difference. I now omit the raisins all together.  Try it. It's great!

I didn't have green onions, so I used half of a red that I had to use or lose.

For the dressing, I used half sour cream instead of the full mayo and cut back the vinegar to 1/4 c. as I wanted a thicker dressing. I also added garlic powder and basil. I also threw in a good
sized handful of fresh parmesan cheese in
with the dressing too, for extra zip.

I took a taste. Really good. I bet it would be even better after sitting for a while.

EDITED TO ADD: This was so good. Both
my husband and I ate seconds of this. There were no leftovers! I'll make this again for sure!

My husband actually ate this and liked it! I followed another poster's advice and blanched the broccoli for 3 minutes followed by an ice bath to soften it and brighten its color.  I also used basalmic vinegar and a little sugar, craisins and some shredded cheddar and red onion.  I give it only 3 stars because I changed it so much, I feel it's a whole different recipe. But, hubby ate it (kids wouldn't touch it, no suprise there) so I will be making this again and again.

I make broccoli salad often and I love it, I would suggest adding 1/3 cup of white sugar to the dressing to counterbalance the vinegar.  I also substituted shredded cheddar cheese for the carrots and I think it taste best when made the night before as it softens the broccoli slightly and the flavors blend.  Be sure to toss salad again before serving.

This recipe is good and I find it more to my liking when I changed two things about it. 1.)I chop my broccoli and put it in a metel strainer and placed it in a large pot of boiling water for 3 minutes and not more than that because if you leave it in longer than that, it will cook it too much and be gross. The I remove it from the hot water and plunge it into a pot of iced cold water until broc is cold, and then drain it well. This makes the broc a nice bright green, mellows the bitterness, and is still crunchy.  2.) I use rice vinegar - nice and mellow but still vinegery.  * once for a party -- I was out of rice vinegar so I used about a tsp +/- of sugar in the vinegar & mayo and stirred it until the sugar was disolved. Then to the salad I added half a can of drained shoe peg corn (thin white corn) and I got a lot of raves on it from guests!  I never use the raisins because we do not like them.

A great way to get your broccoli!  As another reader noted, substituting half sour cream for the mayo makes a creamier sauce (this works great for potato salad, too).  Also, using apple cider vineger instead of white adds a touch of sweetness and more flavor, too.

The dressing is too tart.  Like italian salad dressing
The vinegar to mayo ration is way way to high.   I suggest cutting the vinegar to 1/4 c and the dressing needs sugar.

Edible but I won't make this again.  I think it's missing milk and sugar and the vinegar/mayo ratio seems off.  Sorry.

This recipe is such a summer staple. I've found that adding pecans or sunflower seeds for an extra crunch is really tasty. This is the perfect side dish to bring to a cookout!!

This was okay, but not as good as the one I had growing up with red onion, cheese and sugar also in the recipe.

For anyone who, like me, gets it in their head to substitute the cup of mayo with a low calorie salad dressing: do not add vinegar!  I was livid after spending an hour chopping, blanching, rendering, and mixing only to end up with a sour salad.  Then I read some of the reviews that advised adding sugar to counterbalance the vinegar.  Thank you so much for your sage advice!  It's not the best salad I've ever made, but at least it's no longer the worst.

WARNING!  Cut the vinegar in half!  The flavor is good, but it's too watery.  I subtracted the carrots onions and raisins and added celery slivered almonds and cranberries.  I also used 12 oz of bacon in stead of 8.

AMAZING!!! It was my supper this evening, so tasty and smooth --- though I cooked the broccoli for 5 min and cooled it with cold water before mixing it with the carrot and raisins.

I love this recipe. It's super easy, especially with microwavable bacon. I don't like vinegar much so I cut it in half and it came out perfect for me. My husband actually ate the leftovers before the next day. Thanks!

I did as another cook said, I did 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream, I also halved the vinegar to 1/4 cup and threw in a healthy cup of shredded cheddar...
It is perfect for me.

Good base but next time I'll cut the vinegar in half at least.

*******Loved This Recipe However I used Sour Cream, Cream Cheese w Chives & Onions, Mayonnaise, Cinnamon & a little Honey for the mixture. Broccoli Florets, Shreaded Carrots, Sunflower Seeds, Chow Mein Noodles, Peas & Dried Cranberries For Main Ingredients Was so yummy can't wait til tomorrow to eat more.
