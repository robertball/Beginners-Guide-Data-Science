Loved this.  Omitted the peanut oil and used the sesame oil for stir-frying.  Omitted the peanuts.  Used edamame instead of canned peas and added matchstick carrots and a little egg substitute.  We will definitely make this again.  By the way, it made 5 side dish servings.  Thanks, Verona.

I couldn't rate the kids part because I don't have any, but I liked it.  I made it for my boy friend who loves fried rice, so we'll have to wait and see after he tries it.  I tried it and it had great flavor.  I used edame ( soy beans )  instead of peas because that's what I had on hand and I would use a bit less soy sauce next time, just cut down a little.  Overall though it was great and I can't beleive i've had this recipe in my box all this time and have never made this.  It's the only fried rice recipe iv'e found here that's totally vegetarian and luckily it's a good one.  Hopefully now more people will discover this now that someone has finally tried it and given it a good rating.  Thank you!!

I used basmati rice because I find brown rice quite heavy.  So...I didn't use 3 cups of water.  I followed the cooking instructions for the rice on the pkg.  I also used frozen peas because I didn't want the peas to get mushy.  I also added 2 stalks of finely chopped celery.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This recipe was appreciated by my family sine they were getting tired of plain rice.  I added red peppers, celery, onions, garlic, hot pepper flakes and 2 eggs. I substitued the peanut oil for olive since that's what I had on hand.  So, our recipe was a variation, but still worked well.

Some recipes, like this one, don't need to be dissected.  "D"  good just as is -  I could eat a bowlful.  The sesame oil should not be omitted as it takes this from good to great.  (I used long grain converted white rice rather than brown rice but it turned brown with the soy sauce.  Does that count?)

I used olive oil instead of peanut oil, and added one egg. Tastes great! The peanuts add a nice kick! I'll make this again.

It really needed some carrots so when I was all done I chopped up some carrots and stir fried them seperately and added them to the recipe!  I also used frozen peas instead of canned (more nutricious) and added them with the onions and pepper!  Next time I might put half of the pepper flakes just because my kids thought it was spicy but it wasn't too spicy for me and I'm not big on a lot of spice!  I also added some chicken for some protein and we had this as a meal instead of a side!!!  It was so very yummy!  Even without my adjustments it was really good I just thought carrots would add nutrition and some bulk since it was the only course!!!

****Now that ive made this ohhhh I don't know....100+ times I wanted to add a few things!  This recipe is so easy to adjust to your liking!  First of all if you aren't vegan you can take 1-2 eggs, beat them and add them in last then stir fry until eggs are cooked!  Be sure to get the veggies in there right away once chicken is in there or you will end up with crunchy veggies... unless of course you like crunchy veggies!  I put chopped chicken in and imeadiately start chopping and adding veggies!  We also use brown rice!  I cook 2 cups dry rice seperately in my rice cooked then just blend it all together before adding sesame oil or seeds!

Easy enough were my 10 yr old daughter made it.  My family likes the rice a little more on the dry side so she increased the rice by Â½ cups.  she then added carrots,green beans, mushrooms and red pepper for more color.  Will make again.

This was pretty good, but I had to make a lot of changes due to lack of ingredients.  Did not have brown rice, so I used white.  Did not use green onions, dry pepper flakes, or peas because I don't care for peas.  I added some baccon grease for flavoring.

Very good.  can't wait to make it again.  I added some tofu that have been marinated in a mix of soy, garlic and ginger then cubed and browned and I added some egg.  Next time I will leave out the sesame oil bc I liked the flavor better without it and I will add some been sprouts and broccoli to make it more of a one dish meal.

This is a great recipe. The simple seasonings fool you into thinking it won't be very flavorful, but it is.  The sesame oil really makes the dish. I did add some organic frozen mixed vegetables to the peppers and onions and used canola instead of peanut oil bc I didn't have any. I also left out the green onions bc I don't like them. I used one bag of the Success Boil-in-Bag brown rice and it was perfect. I added one egg just to give it some protein since I was giving it to my kids for lunch. This was quick, easy and flavorful!

This was really good.  I used vegetable oil and a little bacon grease to saute the chopped onion.  I also added chopped carrots & frozen peas.  The dish was delicious served along side baked salmon.

I wasn't sure whether to rate this recipe, as I changed so much of it.  But it was a good base from which to start.  I used the brown rice, but followed the cooking instructions on the packet.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil, but did add a tblspn of peanut butter.  I used red bell pepper instead of green, and added frozen peas and corn, which went in with the onions and garlic.  I was out of soy sauce, so I used teriyaki and I omitted the green onions, sesame oil and peanuts.  this was still an awesome dish and the red pepper flakes added just the right kick.  It was a hit with my family and I will be making it again, with the changes I made.

This is my first review! Yay!  I have experimented with cooking for a few years, but after altering this dish and having everyone love it, I felt like a real cook!  I used olive oil, because that was all I had, and used instant white rice.  I didn't have any peas, peanuts or any sesame oil.  I substituted with carrots, asparagus, and extra olive oil and two eggs that I beat up.  I also used extra garlic and extra red pepper flakes.  I like it spicy.  I didn't add extra soy sauce, but put the bottle on the table for people to use.  I did feel like it needed more salt, but I wanted people to add soy sauce/salt to their own liking!   I will definitely make this again, and will experiment with more veggies and maybe even shrimp or chicken!

I used brown rice, just because I always do for health reasons. Added finely chopped carrots and a Jalepeno pepper + an egg at the end, and about 2T lemon juice to brighten it up.  VERY good!!!  Will make again!

Used La Choy Teriyaki about 1/4 cup (to taste), and a can of mixed peas and carrots, added 1 scrambled egg, and sometimes chicken, leave out the red pepper as the sauce has it in it. Fantastic!!

I used minute brown rice for this recipe. I had a red bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper, used frozen peas instead of canned, and used the same teriyaki sauce I used for the hawaiin chicken that I served the rice with. Turned out great!

I really like this recipe!! Love the addition of nuts, red pepper flakes, and peppers - most people don't add peppers.  I also added: 1 egg, 1 chopped up chicken breast I had left over from grilling out the night before, and 1 julienned carrot.  I also used a red pepper instead of green for the color.  My husband raved about this batch of fried rice when I made it 2 weeks ago and am actually making it again tonight. Am thinking of making it with Hot Chili Oil as my husband loves hot stuff and the red pepper flakes were barely detected last time.

I didn't have any peanuts so I left them out, but this was still very good. I also stirred in a couple of eggs near the end of cooking. This is an excellent basic recipe that you can add anything to.

This was ok but a little bland, probably because I did not have peanut oil or sesame oil. Added corn and cashews.

This was very tasty! My rice turned a bit mushy near the end and I blame having too much water. So, next time I try this, less water I guess. I also added one egg and used red bell pepper instead of green for more color. At the end, we all dapped some more soy sauce and it was delicious!

I used brown basmati rice that I cooked in organic chicken broth instead of the water and quick cooking rice. I used a large yellow pepper (we don't care for green peppers) and I increased the garlic. Instead of canned peas, I used a mixture of organic frozen peas and carrots I had in my deep freeze. This was a quick side I could throw together and it went well with Christian's Killer BBQ and Grill Marinade on the chicken I had to go with it. This was an inexpensive meal that made enough for my two hungry boys, one hungry husband and I plus it made enough for lunch for my husband tomorrow.

This didn't taste anyting like the fried rice I'm used to from the Chinese food take-away since the rice had a different texture and it had no eggs, but it was still tasty. I especially liked the addition of the peanuts on top.

I had a medley of leftover vegetables from the night before which worked great in this dish. Due to allergies I had to skip the peanut oil but canola did just fine. Good recipe and thank you!

YUM!  I was looking for a quick breakfast and a way to use up the rice pilaf left over from last night's dinner, and this was perfect!  Great way to use up leftovers, plus it works great with frozen veggies too-  I used a pepper/onion frozen stir fry mix and used frozen peas and frozen edamame.  For a little more protein- and just because I like it- I added an egg at the end and mixed it around.  So easy and so good!

My advice for ANY fried rice: Make the rice at lease 8 hours (or even a day) ahead, spread it out on a sheet pan, and refrigerate uncovered to dry. This will give your finished fried rice a lovely, non-sticky texture. I think it's critical. I'm also partial to fried rice with addition of scrambled egg.

Loved this recipe! I made a few changes...started with using my rice cooker for the brown rice. Also substituted the veggies for a zucchini, carrot, and green beans purchased from my local farmer's market. I used gluten-free soy sauce to accommodate for my son's special diet...when all was done, we absolutely enjoyed!

this was pretty good for a basic veggie fried rice.. i've never had fried rice with green bell pepper or without carrots, but i wanted to give this a try.. omitted the peanut oil and only used the sesame oil for stir frying like THYMEFORME.. didn't notice the red pepper flakes and at the end i wanted a little something to make the dish pop so i sprinkled some chinese five spice powder on it and enjoyed the results.. ty for the recipe

This was my first attempt at fried rice.  I used half a bag of mixed veggies, one onion, and three garlic cloves.  I loved the nutty texture of the brown rice in this, versus the usual white rice.

Great Recipe!  The only thing that I do different is that I love edamame so I substitute frozen edamame for the peas.  I also add a little white pepper to kick the spice up a notch and leave out the peanuts to cut the fat a little.  Also, safflower oil makes this a nice light dish.

This was very tasty.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil since that's what I had on hand.  I used chili sesame oil which is spicy, so I omitted the red pepper flakes.  And instead of canned baby peas, I used half a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  Yummy!

Overall I liked this... but thought it was quite bland.  It needed quite a bit of soy sauce to give it more flavor on the plate.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly but I loved the results.  I omited the red pepper flakes, the peanuts.  I used all sesame oil instead of peanut oil.  I didn't have any green peppers and I used frozen peas and carrots, thawed.  I also used white rice instead of brown; it's all I had.  I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce; don't care for soy sauce at all. I read the reviews and tried sauteing my rice before hand but the results were mushy.  I think I will try another suggestion of cooking the rice a day ahead of time and letting it sit in the frig.  Regardless, the taste was great!  Definitely the best fried rice I've ever made.  This recipe is a keeper!

We loved it though we did add an egg along with the peas as other users suggested.  I also added carrots with the onion and reduced the peanut oil by 1/2.

Very good, and very easy to make! I added water chestnuts and mushrooms, which were both tasty additions. Next time, I probably won't use green peppers, because they were a little too bitter, and I might add an egg or two. I made my rice in a rice cooker, which let the rice be sticky enough for chopsticks.

Thanks so much. I really don't know why people feel compelled to rate a recipe when they totally butcher the recipe.  This is very, very good.  My first attempt and I'm carrying it to Church tomorrow to share with others. The ONLY thing I did was increase the recipe and add carrots, corn, and peas. Thus, I adjusted the peanut oil and other ingredients accordingly.  Thanks so much. Excellent and EZZZZ

I really like the taste of this recipe.  It's mild, not at all over-powering.  I used all the ingredients listed, added some corn, and it turned out great.  The recipe makes a lot, so I've got plenty of leftovers to eat for lunch over the next few days.  I add a small drop of soy sauce to each serving only to enhance the flavor, but I could also do without it.  All in all, a recipe I plan to repeat!

Yum, yum, yum!!!  I tasted it when dinner started and nearly made it my entire meal.  I used red bell pepper and olive oil because that's what I had.  It hit the spot; I couldn't face another white rice dinner.

I didn't have any peanut oil so used olive.  And I don't like used canned veggies, so just chopped up what I had in the fridge - broccoli, green pepper, green onion, carrots and celery.  Brown rice really made this tasty and healthy.

I wasn't too happy with this. I felt it was bland. I added sliced mushrooms and I didn't have baby peas  so I left those out. I also used sesame oil for the peanut oil because it was all I had on hand. Still, I ate it all and the leftovers also.

Used Sesame Oil to stir-fry and added all the fresh vegetables, I had, those listed as well as red onion, zucchini and summer squash.  I never ever used canned veggies.  Frozen works well.  Will use light sodium soy sauce in the future.  Great for use of leftover brown rice!

This was excellent. I used Near East whole grain brown rice and made it well ahead of time.  I'm not a big fan of can veggies so I cooked Birds Eye frozen peas instead.  GREAT RECIPE.  Thanks.

Flavor was a bit bland.  Not sure what it is lacking...  I would cut the soy sauce in half next time.  Maybe add a little ginger to the mix as well.

This was nice, though I felt it was lacking flavour. Maybe it needs more herbs and spices. The only change I made was in not adding the sesame oil in the end, because I didn't think the dish needed any more oil! This recipe would make 4 main dish servings.

I love this recipe and I will love making many more fried rice recipes.   There seems to be no end to the variations of ingredients that can be used.  Since I sometimes have a hard time eating enough vegetables and fiber, this recipe and many similar ones fit very well.  I like reading the reviews of others who know more about restaurant style fried rice than I do.  Thank you.

I didn't use peas but added mushrooms. The colour wasn't as bright as the version with peas but the taste was delicious. I have been looking for a fried rice with a kick and this recipe was it.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this and loved it. Except 3 cups of water for the rice was way too much. Maybe it was the rice i used. I would use a cup and a half. I also added two eggs. So good!!!

This is a great start! I used grape seed oil instead of peanut, added minced ginger, daikon radish, and cabbage and bok choy near the end. I scrambled 2 eggs with a pinch of sugar and salt and poured them in after the peppers. Also, I used cashews instead of peanuts, and sprinkled on sesame seeds. It was just my perfect idea of what fried rice should be, and my husband agrees!

It came out quite good, for my first time making fried rice! :)   I didn't have some of the vegetables (like the peas and green onions), so I added in a broccoli, cauliflower and carrots mix I had in the freezer.  Then added some flavored tofu I got from whole foods.  Came out quite delicious!! :)

This was pretty good. We also added 2 eggs. I cooked the rice in veggie stock/water mixture. I used frozen mixed veggies, plus fresh green pepps and oninon. I needed a bit more soy sauce to have enough flavor, but that may be because I left out the red pepper flakes for a dinner guest who cant eat spicy food.

This is a great recipe.  It's a great way to use up extra veggies.  I used brown Masbati rice per the recipe.  For veggies I used green pepper, eggplant, peas, onions, peas, and garlic.  I also added firm tofu, cubed, and scrambled eggs.  My husband had THREE servings.  He's never had three servings of anything I've made.  Definitely a keeper

I am giving it a 5 with the changes made. Little more soy sauce, rice under cooked a bit, no peas but I used carrots, onion, garlic, 1/2 green bell, corn and crushed red pepper. Very good this way.

This recipe was OKAY... Will make again but with major tweaks. Onions were completely unnesessary, made rice gooey and weird, cut the can of peas/carrots to half, made too much. Extra soy sauce, kind of bland. and under cook rice, because if fully cooked, once added to pan, becomes over cooked and way too mushy. My finace loved it. Just didnt get me

I used chopped red peppers and cayenne powder instead of crushed red pepper, 1/2 the amount of oil, and sliced the garlic. Great hot, and cold.  I think I will serve this as a salad next time!

While I'm only so-so on this dish, simply because I'm not big on green peppers, I still make it at least once a month, usually twice a month. Why? Because my two year-old LOVES it. Maybe I'll try it with broccoli, which would be better for me. ;)

I substituted veggie broth for water. The flavour from the broth really enhances the recipe. Also do add the peanuts they give it a crunch but wait until the last minute to do so.

Made this as a side to go with my ribs and potstickers for dinner. We liked it! I substituted  the brown rice for Minute Rice. I did add one scrambled egg, and some chopped baby carrots, zucchini, and summer squash. Will make it again.

we made it with mushrooms, and instead of green bell peppers we used red, yellow, and orange that  i had in the freezer.  I'm sure i will make it again, i just wont use as much sesame oil.  BTW, it freezes and reheats great.

I added two scrambled eggs to the vegetable mix prior to adding in the rice to keep it like a traditional fried rice.  I also replaced the bell pepper with an orange (sweet) pepper due to flavor preference.

I used white rice  instead of brown, I also did not have any sesame or peanut oil so I had to improvise! I also added 2 eggs and chili powder- overall pretty yummy and would make again!

Used lima beans instead of peas (last-minute substitution) and added chili sauce for sweetness and zest.  I only used a half onion, but should have gone with the full.  Colorful and satisfying dish.

This fried rice came out great! I used sesame oil to cook all of the vegetables and I added crushed nuts to add some extra flavor once the dish was done cooking. I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce at the end as well, just because thatâs what I had on hand. I absolutely love it and I am definitely going to make it again!

I didn't put chilli flakes and peanut. I used chilli oil for frying the vegetables and I added one shredded carrot and fresh been sprouts. I also seasoned with ginger powder. It tastes amazing.

This was really good! I used regular brown rice, added 2beaten eggs, mushrooms, 1celery stock, frozen mixed vegetables and about 4 leaves of Napa cabbage. My husband loved it too!!!! It'll be one of our regulars.

I didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil. Also had cooked white rice on hand so I used that.  I went a little heavy on the garlic, but it still seemed to lack flavor. Good, though.

I made this for my very finicky vegetarian daughter and she absolutely loved it!  She wants me to make it every day!  I stayed true to the original recipe except added a couple different veggies and omitted the peppers.  Will definitely make again for finicky 17 year old!

I made it but I had no sweet peas so I substituted snow peas cut into one inch pieces. I added more amino acids and a little salt and pepper to taste! I will make this dish again because it is a delicious side dish!

I added fresh carrots and broccoli toward the end. The only thing I'd change about this next time is omitting the sesame oil.  It added a flavor to the dish that I did not enjoy!

So delicious . We went exactly by the recipe because I've never made fried rice before. The only difference is I used basmati rice because it was what we usually have at home . This recipe is so easy to try I also added mixed veggies instead of only peas I like the corn and carrots in my fried rice.

This was a hit! My husband loves Chinese food so I wanted to try making it instead of doing take out. We had store bought sesame chicken and I made the fried rice. I had all ingredients except sesame oil, so I substituted with peanut oil. Turned out great! I would suggest to add the soy sauce in increments - pour a bit then stir and repeat. I ended up not using all of it because it would have soaked the rice and overpowered the great flavors.

I use butter and you have to add sesame seeds! I learned this recipe by watching the teppan guys in the restaurants. I also use a frozen veggie mix.

Great! So much so that my vegetarian hubby (who has always refused to eat Japanese or Chinese) loves it and asks when we are having it again! I use jasmine rice rather than brown rice.

this was great! i used brown basmati rice, and added mushrooms and a frozen peas, carrots and string beans medley. i also only used one teaspoon of peanut oil. i like my rice a little hard so i left it in my cast iron pan for a little while. it was delicious and easy.
