I am from Texas and love fresh green beans and red potatoes. I did this dish for Christmas dinner instead of the traditional green bean casserole.  It was a hit! I'll be making this more often for sure.

I was thrilled when I found this old fashioned green bean recipe. I've never cooked fresh green beans before and I made the beans without the potatoes for Easter dinner. They have so much flavor from the bacon and garlic. This is a keeper!

I love, love, this recipe and so does my family.  Ironically I've been cooking it long before I saw this one. I make it a few times a month at minimum. But, I have a few quick tips for those who need to get it done a little faster.  First, I use frozen green beans, the are just as healthy and good. Also I use prediced onion from my grocery produce section  or  frozen onions. There is also something known as season blend vegetables that I sometimes use. Next, I use ready made bacon which I slice in bite size pieces. I get the full bacon flavor without all of the excess fat & no salt chicken stock so I can control the sodium amounts. You can also use canned potatoes or if you're not a fan use mini red or yellow potatoes.

I came upon this recipe and enhanced it a bit! We LOVE garlic so I actually used about 6 cloves of garlic. I only had a quarter of a yellow onion so I used that with a shallot. I used a bag of the fancy fingerling potatoes (with the purple and red potatoes) and had a carton of portabello buttons. I added the mushrooms with the potatoes at the end. Oh and I used almost a pound of bacon (the kids kept swiping it) and added a bay leaf and some Emeril's seasoning. Very flavorful and yummy!

This was good and I will make it again.  Today I only had gold potatoes and that's what I used. Next time I will only put a small amount of garlic in this recipe.  This was way too  garlicky for me but my husband seemed to like it that way.

I love this recipe.  Green beans and potatoes have always been my favorite vegetable combination.  I've always cooked the green beans with bacon in a slow cooker but I was looking for something a little quicker but just as tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

I made a half version of this with farm stand green beans, russet potato, and thick-cut honey-cured bacon. It is wonderful.

this recipe is made for fresh green beans and not frozen chopped onions. This is basically how my grandmother would make them.  Delicious~! And yes, garlic is always welcomed in my house!

I have tried this recipe before with using turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and with out using chicken stock. For this recipe I used French style green beans and thick cut pork bacon. This is a really yummy dish especially if you add a little spice to it. I think the spice evens out the saltiness this dish gets from the bacon. Definitely worth it trying this recipe!
