Very good. I managed to get it way too spicy though. Next time, I'll go a little easier on the creole seasoning. I'm definitely going to try this again.

YUMMMMM!  Absolutely delicious. I haven't been able to taste alfredo in 6 years due to a car accident (its usually too weak tasting). But this is just perfect. Its sooo good.   Just a suggestion... use Tony Chachere's for the cajun spice.

We found it delicious. I had to use mushroom alfredo, it was all the store had, so I was a little nervous how it was going to work together, but it was awesome. It's fast and easy to prepare. My only complaint is the pasta to sausage ratio, there's just so much more pasta. Next time, I'll either cut the sausage pieces in half or add more. I seriously recommend trying it. We now have this at least once a week.

Delish! I'm not sure why, but I didn't seem to have enough sauce when I poured it over the pasta. Next time I will toss the entire pot of pasta with the sauce/ sausage mixture before serving.  Will make again, maybe I'll use more hot sauce next time or even a mild or hot smoked sausage.

This is one of our favorite throw together skillet meals. This works well with whole wheat pasta and I really prefer to make a homemade reduced fat Alfredo sauce. This also works well if you want to double but want to stretch your meat as well. All you do is throw in chopped veggies--we like spinach, broccoli, zucchini, peppers and onions. This rewarms well for those who want to portion out for lunches/dinners for the week.

Made this for dinner tonight, couldn't find fusilli so I used Rotelle, added an extra pack of Sausages, and used Garlic Alfredo Sauce. Very good recipe, family loved it. Next time I will add some fresh mushrooms and minced garlic.

I really liked this recipe. Perfectly spicy (although I did add a bit more spice than was noted) without being TOO intense. I used regular spaghetti noodles because that's what I had in my pantry and it turned out great.

I first I was a little skeptical about the combination but it was really good.  Instead of fusilli pasta, I used tortellini with cheese.  Overall, it was very good.

Woo Wee! This was reeeally good! I didnt use as much cajun seasoning because my fiance is a wimp when it comes to spice. Classico also makes a light alfredo which is just as good as regular! I like my pasta with a lot of sauce so I did not include the entire package of pasta!  I will make this again Faa shooo!!!!!

Nothing spectacular but tasted good and was easy so I'm sure I'll make it again! I used turkey smoked sausage and Tony's for the seasoning.  Next time I'd like to add some veggies.

Used the cajun seasoning mix from this site and the fettuccini alfredo II from this site.  Awesome dish.  Can be a little spicy so watch your seasonings!!

This was pretty good. I suggest using half the parsley and purchasing a second jar of alfredo sauce; use the extra sauce for reheating leftovers that dryout in the microwave. Keep the hotsauce out for those who like xtra kick.

I made this with some minor changes: I forgot to purchase fresh parsley, so I substituted with 1/3 cup dried parsley. I also added some chopped onion, which I cooked with the sausage until it was tender and the sausage browned.
Because I like a more saucy pasta, I used a little less pasta so I could taste the sauce! 
I loved the simplicity and speed to make this delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Dice an onion and a red bell pepper.  Add a half-teaspoon of mince garlic.  Saute together with sausage 10 minutes before adding the alfredo sauce.   Use 2 jars of sauce.

Very good and an awesome weeknight meal. Like many others we added some sauteed veggies and made home made alfedo sauce. I also used creole seasoning blend from this side for the cajun seasoning, I added a tbsp of it b/c I miss read the directions and it wasnt to spicy.

This was such a simple yet completely delicious meal!  My husband and kids loved it!  I used Gemelli pasta, dried parsley and blackened seasoning  b/c thats what I had on hand.  I also omitted the hot sauce b/c we don't like things too spicy.  There definitely is more pasta then sauce but I just used the left over pasta for a salad or other small meals.  Thanks for this great recipe.  As my husband said...this one is a keeper!

Great weeknight meal.  I like that it had a bit of kick with the hot sauce and Cajun spice!   I used penne pasta because that is what I had on hand and I didn't have fresh parsley so sprinkled some dried parsley instead.  I will definitely make this again.

I love to cook, and I love to bake. Being from the North East,  these are flavors I would never have thought of putting together. My husband has asked me to PLEASE make this at least once every two months. Nothing sooner as he never wants to get tired of it. He is in LOVE with this! I have my own alfredo sauce recipe that I make that includes a lot of fresh minced garlic and fresh grated parmesan.  I quadrupled (probably much more than that) the blackened seasoning to the smoked sausage since my husband LOVES anything cajun, but omitted the hot sauce as he is not a fan of that unless it is on wings. I  also knew the alfredo sauce would mellow out the seasoning....thus more. I realize it can be annoying when someone alters a recipe then gives a review....but this was an amazing combination of flavors. Thank you so much!

Delicious meal. Double the Alfredo sauce unless you like your pasta dishes on the drier side. The Cajun season can be as much or as little as you like, but will get saltier as you go. I used Slap Yo Mama Cajun season and it tasted great.

Recipe was good quick and easy to make but the spice I was hoping for wasn’t all there. My family loves spicy dishes but it didn’t satisfy us in that department but I added some red pepper flakes and it was much better. I also didn’t use fresh parsley instead I put in dried parsley but only a little sprinkle. Other than that the recipe was very good and I will be making it again.

This was really good. Like someone already said, I was skeptical about the unusual ingredient combination, but it turned out really good. I had a green bell pepper that I needed to use, so I finely chopped it up and added to the pot with the sausage. It added a really nice flavor to the dish. My husband, 4 year old and 1 year old all loved it.

Very delicious! This was a real family pleaser. I used polish sausage& adjusted the creole down for us. I used a healthier Alfredo from this site. Had with steamed broccoli. Mmmm!

Great - family really enjoyed this.  I made as per recipe with exception being that I used 1/2 the hot sauce.  Next time, I will increase the alfredo sauce and probably use the full tablespoon of hot sauce.

This is delicious! Very easy for a weeknight meal if you need one: very little prep! I used light Alfredo sauce, green onions (I had those on hand instead of the parsley), and andouille sausage.  That made it a little spicier, so avoid that sausage if you don't want it too spicy! I think we'll be adding this to our rotation!

Since I don't eat meat, I have to rely on good recipes when preparing dishes for others. This was so simple that I was actually a bit doubtful whether it could be very good, but I had a small range of ingredients and needed to cook dinner for my family. My 15 year old son is very honest about how good food tastes, or doesn't. When he tasted the finished dish, he said, "This might be the best dish ever!" I used another recipe for Alfredo sauce made from milk and Parmesan cheese and I used a couple dashes of cayenne instead of hot sauce AND I used smoke sausage with peppers already in it. Yes, we like it pretty spicy. I was so impressed with my son's reaction, that I ate some of the sauce and pasta without the meat and it was absolutely delish! In fact, I am in the middle of cooking it tonight and will make a larger batch so we will have some leftovers for tomorrow as well. Thank you for a great dish!
