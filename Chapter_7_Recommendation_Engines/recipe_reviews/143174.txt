This is a delicious potato salad! The olives give it an extra kick! I prepared this for a picnic at Wolftrap Park (a US Park for the performing arts). Everyone enjoyed it. My congratulations to the person who submitted it!

I don't know what seems strange about raw celery and onions. I've never made a patato salad that didn't have a variety of raw veg in it - onions, celery, peppers, etc. I've made a similar recipe to this one and my family really likes the variety of a potato salad w/olives and oil; versus traditional version mayo, mustard, etc.  As far as "onion-y", that can easily be  adjusted to taste.

Yummy ... the picture accompanying the recipe appears to have cherry or grape tomatoes in it, so I added them.  This is such a well-rounded side, almost can be a full meal with a few other crisp veggies tossed in as well, i.e., defrosted frozen peas, crisply cooked green beans, even canned kidney beans.  I stuck to the recipe, but think I just may make some additions next time I try it.

This is a traditional Italian potato salad that my grandma makes except she adds hard boiled egg whites and green onions instead of red. So good!

A welcome change from mayo based.  I add fresh green beans, cooked crisp tender or canned if I'm short of time.  Hubby likes it better warmed, not hot.  The ingredients are staples, not exotic-a real go-to recipe.  Thanks for submiting this!

It seemed like eating strangly raw ingredients, and very onion-y.

Turned out surprisingly well, since I didn't have red onions or enough red wine vinegar. I used a lightly sauteed yellow onion and a mix of red wine vinegar, white vinegar and lemon juice to replace the rest. Turned out great

This was excellent and my kind of potato salad. I cannot stand traditional ones that are suffocated in mayo. One thing I will say is that 5 stalks of celery to 5 potatoes seems like overkill. I love celery but 5 stalks would overpower the potatoes. I used 3 and will only use 2 next time. Use your own judgement on the amount of onion you put in. Red ones have been really strong this year and I should have only used half. Overall great recipe and one I will definitely make again!

Fast and easy recipe! I didn't have pimiento stuffed olives so l substituted garlic stuffed olives. Everything else was the same. Tasted delicious! Would definitely make again.  ( I think jalape√±o stuffed olives would work also.)
