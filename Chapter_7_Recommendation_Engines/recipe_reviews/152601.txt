I've made this recipe a few time now and given it out to many people.  It's always and hit.  Very easy to assemble and looks impressive like you've gone to a great deal of trouble.  Great taste!

Excellent dessert. I made a few minor changes since my family LOVES the chocolate... I used Peanut Butter Oreos...YUM!! for the crust. And I used Smuckers Hot fudge sauce instead of the Bakers chocolate...  This recipe is sooooooooo easy and best of all DELICIOUS!!!!!

This is such a delicious combination of flavors for a dessert. It looks pretty, its pretty easy to put together.  It's a little time consuming, but it is so worth it. I get raves from everyone who tries it.

I TOO would give this dish 10 stars if I could. I'm a HUGE p'nut butter chocolate fan and this was such a fun new way to combine the two flavors.   EXCELLENT. HUGE hit.

Wonderful recipe.  I have made this many times now.  Love the texture.  Tried nutty bars as a substitution for the cookies, accidentally of course, and my husband liked it better, but I prefer the cookies.  Either way, it was great.

In a word "awesome".  This dessert is a hit anytime you serve it, who doesn't like chocolate and peanut butter together!

This was so yummy!  I made it for a holiday sock exchange at work and everyone loved it.  I don't think I'd change one thing about this recipe.

this was great!  You normally can't go wrong with cream cheese in a dessert.  My 4 year old daughter loved licking the bowl!  Everyone who ate it loved it!!

I made this for my husband's office celebration.  Though I thought it a little too sweet, there were numerous compliments and requests for the recipe. I topped it with halved Oreo peanut butter-filled cookies and drizzled melted chocolate over the top and sides.  Everyone thought it was beautiful. Thanks for a great recipe!

If you are looking for a dessert that is rich and decadent, this is it.  Not to mention, the presentation is very attractive. Easy to make with an icecream-like consistency. Great with a warm cup of coffee.

This is an awesome dessert! Easy to make. I love trying something different and this was it. Had to sneak a taste before the 4 hours were up but waiting until it's completely frozen is well worth it!
