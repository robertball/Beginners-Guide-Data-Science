This cake is very good. Although personally, i would double the ingredients for the filling, and not put any walnuts. I will try it like that next time.

This recipe did okay for me. I would have preferred a little more bite in the icing but the cake itself turned out very moist and tasty. The only problem is that it didn't seem to keep for very long. I kept it in the fridge and it dried out pretty quick. But this is overall a good recipe.

You need more filling AND add more pineapple and nuts to existing filling recipe. 1/2 cup of pineapple and nuts is not enough. I barely had enough to cover ( the glaze ) the two cakes. I would double the recipe.

My 3 layers did not look that thick like her picture. I used 9 inch pans like the recipe said. Maybe if you used 8 inch pans, you would get this. I would increase the recipe to get thicker cakes.
