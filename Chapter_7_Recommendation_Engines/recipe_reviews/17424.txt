Used a 9" deep dish pie crust and regular breakfast sausage (Jimmy Dean) a little more cilantro and WOW - excellent.

I have just begun to make quiche and this one is by far the best.  I was a little leary of what my husband would think of it, but I have ever seen him eat the entire dish of it in one night.

My Husband loves chorizo. I used a basic pie crust recipe, instead of the tortilla. This made it more like a traditional quiche. We loved the recipe, alot of flavor!  Mindy-Dallas,Tx

I loved this recipe!  But I ate it for dinner since it had a spicy punch.  
Instead of chorizo, I used chicken italian sausage from Marketday for a 
healthier, reduced-fat version.

Was really surprised how easy this recipe was and how quickly it went together and how GOOD it was.  My husband liked it too.  We'll use it again.
