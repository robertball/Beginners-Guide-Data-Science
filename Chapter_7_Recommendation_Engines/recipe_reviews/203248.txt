Loved these! But we love Old Bay so of course we loved these. I couldnt grill these so i baked them in the marinade @ 350 for 40 mins. I will be making these again. Thanks!

This recipie was fantastic - the only thing I did different was I used dried basil instead of fresh as I did not have any. I had 6 boneless pork chops left over and needed something to do with them - I did a search and found this recipie.  I actually cut my pork into cubes and marinated in a ziplock bag for about 5 hours then sauteed them in a heavy skillet over medium high heat and then used the pork to make pork tacos - my wife and kids loved them - I will definetely do this again!!!

I thought this recipe turned out very tasty!  I was a little hesitant b/c I really only use Old Bay for when I cook salmon, but the flavors all blended so well together.  I only had dried basil, so I used that instead.  Mine marinated for only 3-3.5 hours and it was GREAT!

I didn't like the smell of the marinade.  I didn't like the way the pork chops smelled when they emerged from the marinade.  And I didn't like how they smelled as they were roasting (Hubs wasn't feeling well so at the  last minute I had to throw these in the oven rather than grill them).  If all those clues weren't enough, the one taste I had sealed it for me.  Somewhere along the line the taste of those beautiful Porterhouse chops got lost in the unpleasant tang of vinegar and lime juice.  I can't remember the last time I disliked something so much.

I admit that I was pretty skeptical about this one because of the number of reviewers who thought the vinegar flavor was too strong.  Well, let me just say, we REALLY, REALLY liked this.  I did proceed cautiously and made 1/2 the recipe using 3 T. of vinegar and a heaping 1/2 T. of Old Bay.  I marinated this for 5 hours and then Hubs grilled it to perfection!  We'll be doing this one again!  Thank you RMT!

I just made this last night and it was delicious!! I left the pork chops marinating in the ziploc bag in the fridge overnight.  The only difference from the recipe is that I didn't have fresh basil, so I used ground basil instead. When I got home from work around 6pm, I threw the pork chops in the oven at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Served the chops with rice and voila! A truly yummy meal. :)

Wonderful flavor. My family loved this and already asked about the leftovers. I did use 1/2 the amount of vinegar this recipe called for and also used double the Old Bay seasoning. Perfect!

Weak on the Old Bay flavor, and very strong on the vinegar.  On the plus side, they were tender.  Other than that, not much to recommend them, unless you're very fond of vinegar.

Excellent - very tender and perfectly seasoned. I didn't notice this recipe called for a lime until I was putting it together, so I had to use a lemon. I used dry basil in the marinade and topped the chops with fresh basil when they were done. I didn't find this at all "vinegar-y," but I'm a pretty big fan of vinegar so maybe I'm immune to the kill of it.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

So I love Old Bay seasoning and thought this would be an interesting marinade the pork chops I had in my fridge.  After reading the other posts, I was nervous about the amount of vinegar so I reduced it slightly.  Then after smelling the marinade, I decided to add about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  This may sound a little strange, but it worked!  We only marinated the pork for about 1 1/2 hours and then grilled it.  Next time I'll try to marinate for longer -- possibly overnight.

These were just OK in my opinion. A little heavy on the vinegar. I did like the Old Bay, so I may try to make this again with less vinegar and somehow incorporate butter instead!

Maybe it's because I'm not from the east coast, but I can think of a hundred other marinades and rubs that I would rather use on my pork chops. This marinade seems to conflict with the flavour of the pork instead of enhancing it.

Marinated chops while we were at work and grilled them when we got home.  The chops were very tender.  Was a bit concerned about the amount of vinegar called for.  Though it tasted ok, will use a little less next time.

I didn't get any Old Bay flavoring in these chops at all.  The marinade made a nice tasting moist pork chop but definitely not worthy of the name Chesapeake Bay in my opinion.  I was actually worried about them tasting too much like a crab or something but they literally had no old bay flavor.

These were really tender and delicious pork chops.  I just used 1/4 cup oil and !/4 cup vinegar for four boneless pieces.  I doubled the Old Bay, strange thing, barely noticable!  Love the stuff and the flavor so next time I'll triple AND sprinkle a bit before grilling.  Loved trying this, though.  Thanks for sharing.

We LOVED this marinade recipe. I was a little nervous because one person rated this very bad but I figured since the majority of people liked it I would still try it and honestly I think the person who disliked this recipe messed it up because it was awesome. We will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  Used olive oil and red wine vinegar and prob twice the fresh basil- other than that everything else was the same!  Put chops in the marinade that morning before work - grilled them over charcoal fire that evening!

We love old bay, so this recipe caught my eye.  I made it following the recipe and it was a big hit! We loved it!  However, I have a habit of taking a recipe and putting my own twist on it.  I used balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, and a nice size squirt of key lime honey. Thank you! It was awesome!

The only flavors I really tasted were lime juice and basil.  Couldn't taste the Old Bay at all.  Don't think I'll make again.

Just made this and the whole family, even the two year old ate it and L O V E D it!!!!!!
No one seemed to think the vinegar was too strong. Only thing I did different was used dry basil because I didn't have any fresh. I also 1/2 it for 4 chops. I can't say enough good things about this.

This recipe was not good!  I followed the recipe, scaled down for 2 servings, but marinated only for 3 hours.  Thank goodness because even without the full recommended marinade time all I could taste in the meat was apple cider vinegar!  If I had marinated the full time I'm sure my husband and I wouldn't have been able to eat it.

This was awesome! I made a couple minor changes. I only used 1/2 of the vinager and added a couple dashes of soy sauce to help balance the sour from the vinager and lime juice. Then when I grilled them, I used applewood smoking chips with my charcoal...that really took it up another notch - these chops could compete with any steak around! Thanks for the great recipe!

Should have read that this is a grilling marinade. Doi. I missed that this morning, when I made this while I was drinking my first cup of coffee. I marinaded these all day and broiled them. My husband and I will try this again when we're ready to grill again. As it sits, it was an okay marinade. Let this be a lesson to you.....read through all the directions!

VERY MOIST AND FLAVORFUL!  This was a nice change from barbeque sauce.  The cooking time was perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Hubby and I both really enjoyed them.  Thank you RMT for sharing this very moist and flavorful recipe!

Easy and very tasty!  Marinated the chops in ziploc bag Sunday afternnon.  I used thick bone in chops and broiled them in the oven for about 8-10 minutes each side.  If you spinkle just a little paprika on the top of the chops they will blacken like they were grilled and taste a bit grilled.  I normally always use a bit of paprika when I broil - especially on chicken.  Makes it look so good!  Don't overdo the paprika because the food will come out charred.  Thanks submitter.

I thought this was awful.  The vinegar taste was overpowering, nowhere near enough Bay seasoning to make it really taste New England-y.  Didn't like it at all.

I was only able to marinate these for about 2 hours. I cooked them on my George Foreman grill and they were wonderful. They had lots of flavor and still very tender and juicy. Thank you for another pork recipe to put into rotation!!

Very good.  Although I love vinegar and don't have a problem with it as a marinade, bf can take a dim view of it, so I halved the vinegar part and replaced it with some more of the oil.  I marinated this for 2 days because I ended up not being able to make it as planned.  It still turned out wonderfully, especially with fresh basil on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had 4 sirloin bone-in pork chops and I fixed the marinade except I used juice on one lemon instead of the lime.  Marinated for 4 hours.  Grilled them on low/med heat till the temperature read 160, about 7 to 9 mins. per side.  They turned out great!  I will use the recipe for other things like chicken, steak and salmon.  The flavors went all through the meat.  This is the best marinate I have found.  Thanks for sharing!   Cookin In WV

A hit with my family. We all really enjoyed them and will make them again.  Per other reviews, I cut the vinegar in half and that was perfect for us. I will either add a little more Old Bay to the marinade next time or take the author's advice and sprinkle it on during grilling. Chops were juicy and flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

Unique taste for pork chops. I personally felt there was too much vinegar, and with the lime, it had a definite tart flavor. If I make these again, I'll half the vinegar and omit the lime.

I really enjoyed this. It was so simple! The lime and cider gave a certain tang. Since it's winter I did bake mine in the marinade and it was still good!

Made these for a group of friends and they said it was the best pork chop they had ever had. Very delicious and flavorful, the marinating left them very juicy and tender. I did use balsalmic vinegar rather than apple cider, though I think either choice is equally good.

Man, this was some good stuff!  I did not have cider vinegar on hand, so I used balsamic vinegar instead, and used dried basil instead of fresh.  It was absolutely delicious and hubby said the same after just one bite!

These were really moist and delicious!  My old bay seemed to have dissappeared on me so last minute I added cajun seasoning.  They turned out great but next time I will try with the old bay. Very juicy!

I made these for my husband and we couldn't believe how tender and moist these were! In addition, even though we like pork, they tasted much like steak!  Only complaint is that I thought they would be more "Old Bay" tasting...I even added a bit more than recipe.  If you aren't really expecting a strong taste of O.B., you'll love this recipe!  OR...sprinkle it on after cooking!

I made this just last night for my family, and oh my god they were great. We had some pork chops that needed to be used, and my mom wasn't in the mood to cook, so when in doubt I hit up Allrecipies in hope for something tasty, and boy did I find it. I used a splash of orange juice and a touch of lime zest. Also I kept the marinade and heated it up in a pan to go over the meat when it was done grilling. Delicous, moist, and easy. I will be sure to make this again!

These were fantastic!!!  I don't like vinegar, so I thought for sure I would hate these, but made them for my family.  I had one or two bites where I picked up on the vinegar, but not too strong.  Even my 2yr old grandson gobbled these down.  Really moistened up the meat.  Definetly will make again.

I was looking for a recipe for pork chops and made these because the wife really likes seafood seasoned with Old Bay.  We both really liked these.  She said it had that really great grilled flavor that you get when you order a grilled meat entree at a restaurant.  I don't think the vinegar or the Old Bay Flavors were too pronounced.  I thought it was a nice, flavorful, "goes with anything marinade".  I am sure I will make this again.

I always love finding new ways to make pork chops.  I followed this recipe to the T except that I only used 4 pork chops.  So many times it seems that the chops never quite absorb the flavor of the marinade, but this was perfect!  I'm a big fan of Old Bay, and this was spot on.

I really don't like pork chops so I am writing this review on what my husband thought of it and he really liked it. The lime juice added a lot to the mix. I added some extra Old Bay and garlic to the mix just to jazz it up. I'm thinking that this maybe a good recipe to use for chicken as well.

Juicy, but dull.  No flavor.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  Recommend adding more spices to chops as you're grilling them.

Just a tad strong on the vinegar.  The garlic and Old Bay were great.  I did marinate over 24 hours so this may have been my fault.  I will make these again with less marinating time or less vinegar.

Wow incredible flavor and aroma . This will be make again and again and again.  Separately I'd love to make the marinade alone as a light salad dressing after filtering out the garlic slices.  Just don't forget to throw a pinch of sea salt onto each pork chop before cooking.  It really brings out the marinade flavors.

I didn't necessarily dislike these, but I was completely underwhelmed. If I'm going to marinate for an afternoon, I expect better. Frankly, these probably would've been better if I'd just sprinkled them with Old Bay prior to cooking. Will not make again.

This was excellent. I had to make my own seafood seasoning using another recipe, but the vinegar was the perfect amount for me (for what it's worth, I LOVE salt & vinegar potato chips, so I'm a fan of that taste!). I marinated the pork chops about 4.5 hours, and the acid actually cooked them a tiny bit. I grilled them on the George Foreman, and while they didn't get the nice char marks from an outdoor grill, they came out perfectly anyway. Juicy, and very flavorful. Easy to make. I will again. I served them with mashed potatoes.

Have made this twice now and we love it. Easy and excellent. The spicing somehow is great. Best with thick, high quality pork chops and not overcooked.
Will definitely make this again, probably several times.

These were really juicy and tasty.  I didn't feel that they were too vinegary like others said.  I did add two tablespoons of brown sugar like another reviewer had done.  This was a good move because it balances the marinade into a proper brine.  Make sure you don't overcook the chops!  If you let them rest you will get some nice juices to add on top of the pork as you eat.

I'm not usually a  huge fan of vinegar, but these were very tasty. Due to a snow storm,  i followed another reviewer's advice and baked in a casserole dish in the marinade,  and they turned out fantastic. Perfect amount of tart and seasoning

I thought these were delicious. I could taste the vinegar but thought it added a nice tang to the pork. I will try this again and add a little more old bay for a little added kick.

We loved this recipe.  I only marinated about 20 minutes.  I cooked it in the marinade in the oven.  Turned out great.  I didn’t use all the vinegar but I will next time and I used more Old Bay seasoning.  I will be making this again!!

My family and I liked this dish a lot. I halved the vinegar as other recommended and am glad I did. Also used lemon instead of lime and baked it for 40 minutes at 350. We love Old Bay, so I did sprinkle some on top of the chops before baking. Will certainly make this again and recommended it to a neighbor!

Took other suggestions & used white wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I also used 1T instead of the 2 listed. Definitely use fresh basil, but we couldn't really tell it was there so next time I'm going to try 1 tsp & see if it makes a difference. Hubby said you don't want the flavor of the basil to over power, but I couldn't taste it at all so a compromise is to increase the little bit. I did marinate for close to 6 hrs & may try overnight next time to see how that works.

I followed the directions and I marinated the porkchops for 24 hours. Then I slice d them up and marinated them for several more hours. there was very little difference in taste. Certainly not enough to warrant the amount the time I put into the meal. I won't be making this again.

Yummy!  Also took the leftovers the next day and any juice left on them, cut them up mixed with diced tomatoes, finely chopped shallots, a little more Old Bay and a little fresh cilantro and heated it up in microwave. Ate it with some of that 90 second rice and it was yummy for the second day! Can't wait to have it again  - and make extra for leftovers!

Great flavor, and very unique! I grilled these on medium-high in my countertop induction oven. My chops were less than 1/2" thick, and I over-cooked them a bit (my fault, not the recipes), so be sure to keep an eye on them, and check the internal temp with a probe thermometer.

After reading many reviews, I made some changes to the recipe to better suit my family’s taste. I used 3 tablespoons of the vinegar, added 3 tablespoons of chicken broth, 4 tablespoons of oil( 1/2 cup seemed a little too much for me), decreased lime juice to approximately 1/2 teaspoon and a splash of white wine to the marinade. I used a tablespoon and a half of the Old Bay Seasoning and could of used a little more. My husband and son loved the recipe and I will definitely make again. I baked the pork chops @350 degrees for 30 min and increase heat to 425 for about 10 minutes more.

only differences were I reduced by half since I had fewer chops.  Marinated them for about 2 hrs then cooked on grill. They were so juicy and moist as well as being done to the proper temp.  I think the marinade acts like a brine and plumps and tenderizes.

These were excellent  without having an overwhelming taste of any one thing, just really good pork chops!

I made this with bone in chops last night.  It was delicious!  I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar, cut down the amount of balsamic to 1/3 cup.  It was a big hit with the family!  To those of you who say it doesn't have any flavor,  I don't know what you did, the flavor is amazing!  I always tweak each recipe i try to what I have on hand and what i like!  That is part of the joy of cooking!  Sprinkling some extra Old Bay on the chops while grilling is a must!  These are the best chops I've had!  Thanks for the recipe!

We made these for dinner last night, following the recipe exactly.  They were very tender and juicy, but basically tasted like pork.  Neither the lime or Old Bay seasoning stood out.  If we make them again, I will double the lime and Old Bay to see if that helps, or maybe sprinkle additional Old Bay on just before grilling.  Thanks for the recipe - I love trying new recipes!

We enjoyed it because we were tired of our other pork chop recipes.  But I can see how it would not be for everyone.  It is tart from the vinegar.  I served it with noodles and pork gravy with a little sour cream added.  That mellowed it out some.  I will make it again.

My husband gave this four stars. It was very moist and tasty. I grilled 2 chops, so I adjusted the measurements but used too much apple cider vinegar. (My husband is not a vinegar fan.)  I seared on an indoor griddle then finished in a 325 convection oven for about 6 minutes. I will make this again!

Terrific marinade!  After reading reviews I made the following changes to suit our tastes...  Cut the apple cider vinegar in half, add 1/4 cup of water and double the Old Bay Seasoning.  Sprinkle with Old Bay Seasoning before broiling on my George Foreman!  The chops were tender and delicious.  I will try this on chicken very soon, adding a tbsp of Soy Sauce!

I followed recipe except for only 1 teaspoon Old Bay and maybe one extra garlic clove. Cooked exactly as written: medium high grill for 7 minutes per side. They came out perfect! Moist, tender, and delicious. A winner at my house.

This recipe was very good. I had to improvise on the Old Bay seasoning to the best of my recalling. I only made 3 chops and despite the fact that I didn't marinate it for many hours they came out actually very good. I don't have a grill so I seared them in a cast iron grill pan and then baked them for about 10 minutes at 350F and for the last 5 minutes I broiled them. By the way, I added the marinade right after they were seared and then baked the chops with it. It was very good and the smell was as usual from vinegar based dishes except that it was not overpowering in flavor. I served it with American Italian Pasta Salad from this site and it was great pairing!

I only made 2 chops so I halved the marinade.  They were very good.  I boiled the rest of the marinade and served it with the chops.  Would make again.

We really enjoyed these!  I may add a bit more old bay next time, but will definitely be making again.

Despite not realizing the minimum marinate time of 4 hours, we felt these were good. I only marinated for about 1.5 - 2 hours and did not note a strong vinegar or lime flavor, but did feel a longer time in the marinade would have been better as directed in the recipe. I used Jan's Old Bay Seasoning Substitute from this website, which is excellent! We'll definitely make these again and marinate for at least 4 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

Made as written, except used dried basil instead of fresh, and baked in the marinade at 350 for 40 minutes instead of grill. Sprinkled some paprika on top before cooking, based on other reviews. This had some heat to it, and was great served over rice with the saucy bits we scraped up from the pan. It was actually a bit spicy for me, so I didn't even try serving it to the one year old.

I liked this recipe.  I thought it was just a bit too much with the vinegar.  But the vinegar flavor wasn't so strong as to detract from the dish.  I would probably just cut down on the vinegar a bit if I make this again.

We do the same with chicken Breast on the bone with skin.  I like to grill with cherry or apple wood.  It's a sweeter smoke to complement the Old Bay and the vinegar.

We usually like everything in this recipe but for some reason the combination just didn't suit our tastes. The vinegar was a little strong but I'm not sure that was the problem for us.

This was such a fail.  no one ate it.  It may have turned out better if i had grilled it, instead i fried in a pan.  The flavor of the vinegar was not overwhelming.  i would have liked more old bay flavor.

This recipe is so easy and so flavorful!  We made the recipe exactly as it was written, with the exception marinating the pork longer, and the chops came out so moist and juicy after grilling.  I never make pork chops on the grill because they always come out dry.  Not these!  We'll definitely make this again - and again!  The marinade would also be great on shrimp, I'm sure.

Great Marinade! This one was really good! Hard to find great marinades for pork chops that you will make again and again. This one fits the bill. Flavorful, easy, and not expensive. We are from Maryland and this gets our endorsement! Only change/modification/suggestion. A tad more Old Bay Seasoning and it's perfect!

I had two thinner boneless chops and decided to try this recipe. I prepared exactly as written, adjusting only the servings.   I marinated for 6 hours in the fridge and cooked the chops on a stove-top grill.  (I did not care for the smell when they were cooking.  Assuming it was the vinegar.)  They cooked quickly and my (very picky) husband loved it.  There was no "vinegar" taste.  Just a good flavor.  Thanks for this very quick and easy way to make pork chops delicious!

This was quite good! Didn't have any lime juice, so used lemon juice instead, but want to try lime in the future. Very easy, and very tasty. Served with rice. Hubby agreed it's a repeat.

Spectacular! I was very skeptical after reading some of the other comments about how strong the vinegar flavor was but I didn't find that to be the case at all. Yes the marinade smelled of vinegar but that burned off while cooking.  Everyone raved and wanted more.

No I did not, nor would I take a good piece of meat (steaks, pork chops, lamb, chicken, etc) and ruin a perfectly flavorful meat with a marinade.

Keep it simple.  A little dash of salt, pepper and possibly one other dry spice and grill.

Even smoking meats, no marinade or prolonged exposure to spices before smoking.  Only time I do prep is for cold smoking salmon with maple syrup and kosher salt.

Only myself, my boyfriend and one of my sons ate it.  We all liked it but it wasn't amazing. I only had time to marinate for just over an hour.   Our family likes sauce so I heated up rest of the marinade with some corn starch and some brown sugar. It was great and I loved the sauce.   I would for sure make it again.

I pan fried these rather than grill.  I poured the marinade over the top as they cooked.  Wonderful flavor

Excellent. I substituted lemon juice for the lime and a spicy mix for the Old Bay, as I did not have those two ingredients and it was still excellent. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly. I am sure it will still be even better.

so very tender and moist - as other reviewers recommended, halved (white balsamic, cuz that's what I had) vinegar and oil, doubled Old Bay, used lemon juice (didn't have a lime) & teaspoon of dried basil (no fresh right now) and then baked in the marinade...and so easy!

I made it like bellepepper made it. I only could marinate it for a half hour but it turned out delicious. I may add minced fresh ginger next time though.

My husband really liked these pork chops. I didn't want to pull the grill out so I broiled with the oven rack all the way on the bottom. Cooked 6 minutes on each side. I marinated 4 hours. Happy husband, happy life. :)
