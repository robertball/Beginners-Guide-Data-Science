MLALAK, thanks for sharing this recipe. I had bought several rib steaks on sale and they were as tough as shoe leather.  Grrrrrrr  So I searched for a simple marinade recipe and decided to try yours.  My husband reported a marked difference in the steak and announced how good it was.  I had never marinaded steak before (too lazy) but will use your recipe again in the future. Oh  Thanks to your Dad, also.  Margene

Such a great simple marinade! I used reduced sodium soy sauce, but made no additional changes.

This is pretty good for a quick marinade using ingredients that most of us probably have on hand. The only changes I made was to use olive oil instead of vegatable oil. Also added fresh lemon juice from 1 lemon. This is a good base for a marinade... but add some spices for a little bolder flavor like basil, oregano, salt & pepper, and a little cumin! Perfection!

We used the cheap ranch steaks.  Added minced onion to the mixture.  Other than that, made exactly as written.  Only had time to marinade 3 hours.  Next time will marinade over night.  It still had good flavor but would be even better next time around.  Except for the red wine, we had the other ingredients on hand.

Very, very good! I used red wine vinegar instead of red wine and my whole family loved how good our steaks came out! I am getting ready to marinade some steaks right now with this recipe.

I used olive oil for a little bit of a healthier twist. There are better marinades on this website, but this one was fine. It helped tenderize the sirloin steaks my wife purchased. It has all of the elements for a successful marinade, but nothing that makes it stand out over and above the standard marinade. Good though.

Great flavour. May be a bit too salty so next time I'll cut both the soy sauce and Worcester in half. 
Made a half recipe for 1 large steak

We did not have Worcestershire (Thank god for spell correct) sauce, so I used HP instead but everything else was by the book. It was pretty darn good. I learned a trick to remove all the air from the marinading Ziploc bag by immersing the bag with the meat and marinade in it, in water which pushes all the air out. submerge until just before the closing end as you zip it shut. :)

Did a nice job tenderizing a sirloin steak. Flavor of the marinade was good but not over-powering.

Liked the flavor it gave the steak but was hoping it would tenderize it and it did not do that. I did not change the recipe except used white wine instead of red wine . Did not have red wine

I searched through several other marinades, and they seemed too complicated. I decided on this one because it was simple and easy. 
I let my steaks sit in the marinade overnight, and it was well worth it. The flavor was impressive. They tasted so good! 
I substituted with olive oil, and I used a thick balsamic for the wine. 
The ease of soaking them in the Ziploc was great too! 
This hasn't received as many  reviews as some of the others, but it will in time! I highly recommend it!

I used this as a base recipe. Replaced veggi oil with olive oil, red wine with beef broth. Omitted the garlic. Added a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt & lemon pepper. We'll see how it comes out tomarrow. I really cant rate it cause I changed it so much. The recipe sounds great & I will have to try it as is sometime. I didn't have red wine & really didnt want to chop garlic right before going to sleep & I dont like veggi oil with meat, just tastes weird to me. I already have this recipe memorized though.
