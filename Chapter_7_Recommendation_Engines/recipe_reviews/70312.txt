I will never buy refried beans again!!! The only thing I did different was using 1/2 Black Beans & 1/2 Pinto. My family thought they were better than anything bought!
If you want to make a large batch of bean dip, after mashing the beans add:2 C.salsa, 2C.shredded Co-Jack cheese, 2C. shredded pepperjack cheese,8oz. creamcheese, 16oz. sourcream, 2T. chili powder, 1/2t. ground cumin...mix and let cook a couple hours longer so flavors can blend.Makes a huge batch so just freeze leftovers :)

I make refried beans all the time and I thought I had my recipe down, but I have to say that though more simple with less ingredients than my own, these beans are THE BEST!  The only change I made was I used chicken broth instead of water, which I believe made for richer and yummier tasting beans.  Because of the chicken broth, I also reduced the amount of salt.  This is how I will make my beans from now on!

These beans were delicious!  I used to cook them in the Pot for 4 hours with only onion and salt...but WOW...THIS IS MY NEW RECIPE!! I only added 3 teaspoons of salt and will add only 1 tablespoon of garlic next time.  I cooked them on High for 8 hours as called for in the recipe and they came out great!! After they were done cooking,I served a bowl to my husband ( frijoles de la hoya)and then I transferred some of the beans (along with some juice) to a pan and mashed them.  I added a little bit of lard, a tad of milk and some cheese to make them creamy.  The beans were PERFECT without adding lard,milk and cheese...I only added those ingrediants because I am mexican and that is how we have been refrying beans for generations.  I couldn't break the habit :)  I think next time I will try subsituting 2 cups of water for 2 cups of chicken broth.

Salty! Oh my gosh this is salty-3 tsp would have been enough. In the restaurant I use to work at we added 1 TBSP sugar and 1 TBSP chili powder (along with 1/4 cup oil or lard) Good way to cook them but wish I would have cut back on the salt.

Try using a hand blender to "mash" the beans while in the broth..you can ladel off some of the broth first if your concerned..you can use it to reheat/thin the bean another day. Freeze refried beans with the extra broth on top in a jar. Good way to have fast refried beans later.

These turned out really good.  My family ate them in bean burritos last night with chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar, avocado, and sour cream.  I omitted the jalapeno, otherwise they would've been too spicy for my 5 year old.  To clarify, the halved onion completely disintegrates while cooking--I was worried about having a hunk of onion, but it works just the way it's written.  Also, I used 1/2 of the salt--you can always add more salt once they are done, but I didn't.  Once cooked, I poured the beans into a collander and allowed some of the juice to drain off, otherwise they would have been too wet for burritos.  I then mashed them with a potato masher several good times, and they were great.  Next time I make these, I'll try the black bean/pinto bean combo that others have suggested, and I may also add some reduced sodium taco seasoning instead of salt for more flavor.  These are a fabulous substitute for canned refried beans, and I plan on freezing the leftovers for another meal--this does make a lot!

Delicious!  I cut the salt to 2 1/2 tsp. and added a can of green chillies in place of the jalepenos.  It turned out great!  I will be making this often.

Having lived with a Mexican family (Jalisco) for over one year, I know what REAL refried beans should taste like, and this recipe takes the cake!  Some changes I made to make it taste a bit more authentic is I did 1 whole jalapeno instead of half, 1/4 teaspoon cumin instead of 1/8, and added 3 tablespoons of paprika, and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.  I also cooked the 2 lbs of beans for 10 hours instead of 8 hours on high.  Mi familia LOVED it!  We will be making our "refried" beans this way from now on!  ^_^

Also forgot to mention, the broth alone is fantastic for those whom participate in long-term water or juice fasting!  Lots of natural protein, it's liquid, and it's delicious!

5 star recipe!  I've made this a couple of times when I planned on serving tacos or enchiladas.  Great time saver using the crock pot and a very simple recipe that yeilds fantastic results.  Of course, every cook personalizes a recipe to accomodate their family's taste so here's my changes:  add three slices of bacon, upped the cumin to 1 tsp, chicken broth in place of the water, cut the salt and adjusted to taste at the end.  In place of the water, I used the broth remaining from parboiling chicken for Chicken Enchiladas I from this site (fabulous recipe BTW) consisting of chicken stock, celery, green ortega chilis, garlic, cumin, chili powder, tomato sauce, black peppercorns, oregano and onions.  This gives the beans an absolutely superb flavor!  It's wonderful without my stock, but using it gives this recipe an added boost.

Very good.  I left mine in for about 9 hours and mashing them was a snap.  The flavor was just right; actually we found it to be very close to the canned variety (which we like).  But we fried the leftovers with a little olive oil the next day and they were amazing!  If you have the time, definitely give that route a try because it's twice as good.  Also, this makes a lot, as most slow cooker recipes do.

Excellent.  Life saver.  Thank you!  My Mom forgot that she was going to make the beans for my Mexican "Fiasco" and I ran to my local pantry and picked up the pinto beans.....threw these in the crock pot 10 p.m., the next morning....mmmmm smelled so good.  I used 1 cup of the reserved liquid, stuck them in the kitchen aid to "mash" them and they were perfect.  Got many compliments on this very easy recipe!  Thanks CHEFCLAUDE!!!!!  Your my new favorite!

I love this recipe.  It's healthy, without the fat.  I added garlic salt, and less salt.  Didn't even chop the jalapeno, left it whole.  When beans were done, I took out the onion and jalapeno.  Seperated the beans and liquid.  Mashed the beans, while adding the liquid.  Loved it.  Hubby says the beans had a punch.  It's a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

I have made these beans many times.  They make for great leftovers so I always make a lot!  The recipe is excellent as it is, but I still found myself tweaking it a little each time until I found, what I now believe to be, the perfect formula.  I use 3 cups low sodium chicken broth and 6 cups water.  Adding too much chicken broth, as other posters recommended, tended to overwhelm the natural flavor of the beans.  3 cups seems to be the right amount for my tastes.  I use 3 tablespoons of fresh garlic and 1 ½ medium size jalapenos minced with seeds and all.  I do not add any additional salt beyond what is already in the chicken broth.  Sometimes I’ll start the beans the night before on “warm” and let them cook all night and then throughout the next day.  These beans always come out great and everyone I’ve ever served them to absolutely love them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I never thought I can make refried beans and this recipe made it possible for me. I would've given it more stars if it wasn't sooooo salty. We only used 3 teaspoons of salt and it was still pretty salty. So, I think I'm going to try for just 2 tsps and I've also heard adding milk makes them creamier.

These are the BEST "refried" beans I've ever had. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and made a few minor changes. Instead of the jalapeno pepper, I used a whole can of chopped green chiles. I used two full cartons of chicken broth (8 cups) instead of the water, and I did not add any salt until the end (because I didn't know how salty the broth would make the beans). The beans were pretty good after cooking overnight. They were darn good after they were blended and I added salt to taste. They were to die for the next day when I reheated the refrigerated leftovers. I will never buy canned beans again. These were too easy and too tasty to not make. 

BTW, this makes a pretty big sized batch. What we do when we have a lot of leftovers that might not get finished fast is we put some in a Foodsaver bag, seal it up, and freeze. Then, when you want to heat them, you throw the whole bag into boiling water and let it heat. You then pour the contents into a bowl to serve. It's a great way to deal with large batches of food, and an excellent way to reheat the beans without having to worry about them sticking to the pan when reheating them.

Addicting. Granted, I LOVE legumes. And there are so many ways to use these! In tacos/burritos, over rice with leftover meat (rotisserie chicken, sausage, whatever). Add a couple Tbsp tahini for a delicious hummus. Add colby cheese & cream cheese & sour cream & salsa & cilantro for a killer dip. Stir into soups for a creamy thickener. When health food tastes this good, why eat junk?? :) Also, per personal taste, add at least 1 tsp cumin. Lime juice is also a bright, refreshing addition.

This recipe is the best! Anything I can do in my slow cooker (which I've had since 1980!)makes my day, or actually my night since I have the habit of throwing things in and letting them cook overnight. Call me wierd, but waking up to the smell of a pot of beans starts my day off right! (I also highly recommend the Slow cooker pozole recipe from this site.. it's fabulous!) I cut the recipe down to 5 servings but used chicken broth instead of water (and omitted the salt in the recipe), a whole jalepeno (seeded and membrane removed),a nice big clove of garlic minced fine and a Tbsp of EVOO. The only other addition that I made that I haven't seen others mention was to add a packet of Goya Sazon. It didn't make sense to me to loose all the great flavor in the broth (which at that point just covered the beans), so I did not drain the beans, but mashed them with the liquid and then simmered, stiring almost constantly, until they were the consistency of gravey or loose mashed potatoes.They will firm up a little more as they cool down. Beans rule!  Thanks for a recipe that calls for whole ingredients instead of the sodium packed canned goods many recipes use. Flavor and nutrition CAN co-exist in the kitchen.

These beans are excellent, healthy and easy. I froze the stock from 2 batches. Today I thawed it, added corn, black beans, tortilla strips and leftover chicken. It made an incredible soup!!!

The recipe itself is somewhat bland and too salty. I only put in 3 tablespoons of salt and to make it tastier put in 3 slices of turkey bacon on the bottom of the slow cooker. I also put in 1/4 tsp. of cumin instead of the 1/8 tsp. Also, I only cook the beans for 6-7 hours, as too much water evaporates in my slowcooker after 8 hours. Helpful hint - spray the inside of the slow cooker with vegetable spray then you won't have a ring around the slow cooker!

This recipe, slightly blended with another, is a staple at our house. The difference: I use a bottle or two of beer on the beans, and sometimes add a bit of bacon, or a ham bone, which gives a bit more depth. In normal refried bean uses, I wouldn't, but when we do beans, we eat 'em as the main course, so those beans have to carry a lot of the meal, flavor-wise. One other thing I do: brown the onions, and then quick-saute the garlic (1 min. or less) to make the flavor really pop, before adding to the beans- it makes a big difference! Good recipe- thanks, ChefClaude! :)

Wonderful! I have made these twice and made a refried bean eater out of my husband. They have so much more flavor than anything out of a can. I did add more jalapenos than stated, 3 seeded and halved. My crop this year was milder than normal. Also added 3 giant cloves of garlic, equal to apx. 2T chopped. Add the salt AFTER cooking the beans, you shouldn't cook beans with salt, makes them tough. I only needed to add 2t, not 5. Yummy, yummy. Can hardly wait to have Mexican night again!

I have made this recipe many, many times and it is the best and easiest way to make refried beans from scratch (which is the ONLY refried beans I serve.) Do yourself a favor though and cut back on the salt and add it after the beans have been cooked and mashed. You want the beans to break down, and adding salt while cooking will only preserve their shape, which you don't want. In my opinion, one teaspoon salt works well for this recipe. I usually also increase the cumin to at least a half teaspoon (if not more).

This is one good recipe that also freezes extremely well, that said, I would heartily recommend doubling the recipe so you have extra to freeze for later (If it lasts that long.).

After making this many times in the slow cooker, I now make my refried beans in 90 minutes by moving this recipe over to the pressure cooker and making a double batch. To do this, double everything in the original recipe except the salt (only 2 teaspoons total), and water (9 cups total). Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to keep the beans from frothing too much while they cook. Bring up to pressure and cook for 90 minutes. Release pressure and ladle beans and water into to a blender or food processor to break down. Do not drain any water off unless you want your beans the consistency of mashed potatoes.

Either way, make up a batch (or two) and you will never buy canned beans again.

Cumin isn't an option its a must and much more of it!  I add almost 1 tbsp of it along with 1 tsp of taco seasoning for more flavor. Love refried beans (all recipe search enchillada sauce for a topping, and add a tbps of cheddar and you've got pintos and cheese) freezes well, a great meal, a great appetizer, etc etc love it!

Great recipe!  I did adapt it a bit to use what I had on hand.  I only used half an onion and I went ahead and roughly chopped it.  Also, I used 2c. of homemade chicken stock that I had in place of 2c. of the water called for.  I cooked the beans overnight on low (about 10-12 hours).  When I mashed them I added a pinch more cumin.  These turned out WONDERFUL!  Definitely better than canned refried beans and much less expensive since this yields so much.  Thanks for a great recipe!

P.S. I read a few reviews where people omitted the jalapeno for fear that it would be too spicy, the amount of jalapeno called for does not make the beans spicy at all!  My 1 year old son thoroughly enjoyed these beans.  So, actually if you are wanting a little bit of heat I'd definitely add a whole jalapeno and maybe even leave in some of the seeds and ribs.

Made these tonight for the second time. The first time...I found them a bit bland (followed the recipe to a T). This time, I added a little more jalapeno, 10 large cloves of garlic, an onion, 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder, the recommended salt and pepper and subbed 4 cups of the water with homemade chicken broth. These were a million times better and so flavorful! The base of this recipe is great, and the cooking method is amazing, I just needed a little more "zing". Thanks for an easy recipe!

Very delicious! I made about two cups of dried pinto beans' worth of this recipe (and adjusted the ingredients to match) in my pressure cooker, instead of a slow cooker, since i don't have one of those. Added all the ingredients to the pressure cooker, and cooked on high pressure for about half an hour, took off the top, and checked the water level. I added about a cup more water, replaced the lid and brought it to high steam (high heat) then lowered the heat to med-low for about an hour and a half.  The beans mashed up beautifully, and truth be told, I may never buy canned refried beans again! Thanks, ChefClaude!

Yum!  I did not change a thing.  Talk about walking into the house to an awesome aroma.  I am used to buying the canned stuff and this is as good if not better.  I actually left half the batch as is, and mashed the other half.  These freeze very well.  So, in a pinch, I always have some on hand.  The recipe makes about 12 cups.  This is definitely a keeper.

I love these beans.  I throw ingredients in my crockpot and let cook overnight and they mash up perfectly.  I also add salt towards the end of cooking.

I cut the recipe in half and used only 1 teaspoon of salt, which was plenty. This recipe is delicious. I won't buy canned refried beans any longer (unless time is of the essence, of course). I made these on the stove top instead of the slow cooker. I simmered for 2 hours on my simmer burner and more than one cup of water did evaporate, but the recipe was fine - not dry at all. I tried to mash with my immersion blender, but it met it's demise in the process (no fault of the recipe) so I finished by using a fork. I like knowing what's in my food so thanks for a healthy alternative to canned refried beans!

I also only used 2 tsp of salt and threw in a whole jalepeno, and some olive oil at the end. Yum! I'm so excited to make my own beans now!

I have been using this recipe for quite awhile and like others, have tweaked some things (tried using chicken stock, didn't change flavor much, decided to save the $$ and not use it).  I use a dried large chili to add a little heat rather than jalapeno, don't use salt until after beans are cooked.  I've mixed black beans with pinto with great results.  I'm at the point where measurements don't really matter, just throw in some stuff and let it cook.  It is that easy.    I use a stick blender to blend everything together because I'm lazy and don't want to hand mash.  Use small plastic containers to freeze the beans, then pop them in plastic freezer bags for easy stacking in the deep freeze.  The beans freeze extremely well.  Yummmmm

I have read discussions about these beans for long enough.  It was time I try them and get over my fear of using dried beans.  Wow, what a simple and tasty recipe!  I added all the ingredients (only used 2 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 whole jalapeño, and added the cumin) to the crockpot and at about hour 6 the juices were at a slow boil around the edges of the crockpot.  I just let them boil as there was still plenty of juice.  I drained them at the 8 hour mark, saving the juice, and mashed them.  The first night we had them, no extra juice was needed as the beans were warm.  After refrigerating them and reheating I needed to add some of the extra juice I had saved.  My DH, who isn't a huge fan of refried beans loved these.  I froze 3 containers for another time.  A fantastic recipe, simple to make, and one that I will use again.

I am making these delicious beans for the second time. As another reviewer stated "I will never buy canned again"! The flavor and texture are perfect, and it's so easy. I freeze in smallish containers so I never run out. Thank you Chefclaude for sharing.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes on this site.  I cut back the salt to 3 tsp, add a whole chopped jalapeño, and several healthy shakes of TJ's Chili Pepper Sauce after they're cooked.  Cooked on high, these will be done in a lot less than 8 hours (mine 3 to 4 hrs).  Seldom will you find my freezer without at least one container of these beans.  And trust me, once you try them, you'll never buy canned refried beans again because they just don't measure up!

These beans were tender in 4.5 hours on high. I seasoned with 3 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. cumin and reduced the black pepper to 1 tsp. which is plenty. After beans were cooked, I ran them through the food processor, adding just enough of the bean liquid to get the right consistency. I also added a 4 oz. can of mild green chili's. This stuff is SO good!! You will NOT miss the fat...trust me. Wonderful consistency and fresh taste. It puts the canned refried beans to shame!! Warning...this makes a LOT of refried beans.

Great recipe. I didnt use a crock pot. I soaked the beans for 4 hours. After soaking the beans I out al the ingredients in to a medium pot on medium-high heat for 2 hours. Mashed them up and my family couldnt believe refried beans could taste so good. They hated refried beans until now. Thanks.

I've made these beans several times now and they're awesome!  Next time I'll try adding chicken broth like another reviewer posted.  I used them in a quick and simple burrito recipe I've made up, about 2 cups worth of these beans, all the chicken from a rotissery chicken shredded, and 8 ounces of pepper jack cheese.  Wrap mixture up in flour tortillas and top with enchilada sauce. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or so, until bubbly.

Finally!  I've been searching and trying lots of refied beans recipes and yet they were all okay, this one is awesome!  I highly recommend this one to people who have kids that might be used to the beans in the can because these taste very similar.  Next time I might experiment w/ a little less salt, as it seemed pretty salty.  But very edible non the less.  Thank you for submitting a great recipe!

I didnt mash these up as the recipe instructed, I decided to keep them as  frijoles de la hoya.  The taste was very authentic and traditional without all the work of having to keep on eye of the pot of beans.  It was much easier to make them in the slow cooker.  I cooked them overnight and the beans were very tender.  I made huevos rancheros for breakfast and served the beans as a side dish topping them with cotija cheese.  My hubby gobbled them up with tortillas and salsa ranchera.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

These are so fabulously delicious my family were spooning them straight out of the pot before I even got to mashing them (they create the most amazing aroma while cooking and had everyone's mouth watering all day long!) I took the hint from a few reviewers and used chicken broth as the cooking liquid, while reducing the salt to 1 teaspoon. That made for a knockout broth. I wouldn't want a single bit of it to go to waste and since this makes such a big batch, next time I plan to serve the beans and broth over rice first, saving the leftovers for mashing. I had no idea home made pinto beans were so delicious!

Hands down, my most requested recipe! A regular staple in my kitchen, my family and friends all love these beans, and swear that they just cannot eat those canned, pasty versions now that they have had these.  I regularly feed my teenage son and his friends these in burritos, and they just keep coming back for more.  A crew of hungry teenagers will go through an entire crock! I only do a few things different ~ I omitted the jalapeno, I just didn't have any on hand, and when I did and I added it, we didn't notice much of a taste difference.  I also bumped up the cumin to a full tsp., and I throw in a good tbs. of Taco Seasoning as well.  I chopped the onion up more, just to distribute it in the crock.  I use the Trader Joe's frozen garlic cubes, about 4-5.  When the beans are done, I simply drain out the liquid (but reserve a cup full), and use my immersion blender to give em a a good whirl for a few minutes, and drizzle back in the reserved water until the desired consistency is reached.  This way you can serve them right in the crock so they stay warm.  We like them creamy, but you can leave them lumpy by just not blending as much.  They do not taste overly salty, as that salt water is all drained out at the end.  If you want a little kick, any type of chile added is great. I added some Albuquerque Hatch green (hot) chiles that a friend gave me to the last batch and it was outstanding!

I learned the hard way through this recipe that you SHOULD NOT cut jalapenos without using gloves!  My fingers burned for literally two days!!! 
That said, this is one of the few recipes on this site that truly deserves five stars as written.  I followed the recipe exactly (using less salt) and it turned out absolutely amazing.  I have a new cuisinart slow cooker, so I cooked them on "high" for about five hours and stirred them.  I then turned it down to "simmer" (one notch below the low setting) and cooked it for another five hours.  I removed some of the liquid and pureed them directly in the slow cooker using an immersion blender.  It was so good I was eating it cold right out of the fridge. We ate the whole batch as "soup" before I could use it for cooking, but I'm going to be making another again to use in Mexican enchiladas.   I will NEVER buy canned refried beans again!

Super easy, really REALLY YUMMY, crazy cheap!! Love throwing these together in the morning and having them for dinner that night and for other meals for the next week! 
And I did something I RARELY do (Drumroll please...) I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO A "T"!!! The only thing I found was that I didn't have any water to drain off, so I just mashed away. My whole family loves them! And they freeze great too!  :)

Don't throw away the leftover broth when you're done!  I leave it in the crock pot and add 4 chicken breasts, 1 small can of chopped chilies, 1 small can of chopped jalopenos, and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Let cook until you can shred the chicken about 4 hours on low.  Then add 1 can each drained corn and black beans and whatever seasonings you want and cook for about 1 more hour.  Makes a delicious soup for lunches the next week!

I have never made any beans from dried beans, this is my first attempt. I did substitute some of the liquid with my homemade vegetable broth for extra flavor, only used 3 t of salt, a tablespoon of Cumin, and a big wooden spoonful of chopped pickled jalapeños since I had no fresh. I also minced the onion. It smelled so good while cooking, I cooked on high for a good 7 hours. There was quite a bit liquid, I didn't need to add any of it when mashing the bean, I hand mashed them. My guest couldn't stop telling me how good these were, we made burritos with them. They all wanted the recipe.

I've made this about 5 times since finding recipe a few month ago.  So simple, just put everything together in morning and its ready after work.  I do like a bit more spice and flavor so I use 2 seeded quartered jalapenos and 1 tbs cumin and reduce salt.  This makes a lot of beans and there is only 2 of us.  I make bean dip out of the leftovers.  I finely chop 1 jalapeno and 1/4 to 1/2 an onion and sautee in olive oil.  I add this to warm beans along with some chopped tomato and cubed velevetta cheese.  I also add leftover taco meat or ground beef I have on hand.  I've been told its the best bean dip ever!

Loved it!  I also added some chili powder.  Didn't add the peppers.  Turned out great!

These were excellent and so easy.  I didn't have a jalapeno pepper on hand, so I added chipotle tabasco sauce when the beans were done.  My second time making these I added about 3 drops of liquid smoke.  Don't know what will happen.  BTW - No gas with these!!

I was really excited about these and then a little let down.  They were super easy and that was great.  But I thought they needed way more flavor.  I made half a batch and still put in the whole jalapeno.  I couldn't even tell there was any jalapeno, onion or cumin.  I added salt after I tasted it, as I do not like overly salty foods.  Next time I will use chicken broth as others suggested and add the onions and pepper more towards the end so there is some flavor.

These are delicious, just like the ones my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant makes (except they add some bacon grease somehow...). Highly recommended! You can make this overnight if you keep the slow cooker on "low." Happy cooking!

Came out super-fantastic!    I added only 1TBs of salt at the beginning and left in the jalapeno.   I also thought that 1/8 tsp of ground cumin was way too little so I guestimate I added about 1.5 tsp.   After cooking, I did have to add a little more salt, but that's ok by me because they weren't ruined by being over-salty (thank you reviewers for your advice!)  With my huge crock pot, things have a tendency to get way too hot & burn since my only options are low, hot, and off. (The bigger the crock, the more heating area I guess) so these were done in less than 6 hours on high for me.  I will certainly be making these again, and will probably let it go overnight on low for a longer cook time instead.  nom nom nom nom :)

Loved it! It smelled soooo good after a few hours in the slow cooker. I like things spicy, so I used a whole jalapeno, 1/2t cumin, 2t pepper, and a few dashes of Chipotle Tabasco. Also, I only used half the salt (plenty), and added two packets of low sodium chicken bouillion. Perfection! Frozen leftovers reheated well but needed a little extra water. I saved the leftover bean cooking liquid to try out as a base for taco soup. Yum! *Update - makes great soup simmered with tomatoes, jalapenos, chili beans, corn, rice, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, oregano, pepper, lemon juice, and cilantro.

Easy to make, but nothing outstanding about the taste. I halved the recipe, and still had so much left over from dinner for 8.

I have made this recipe like how many times since 2009? I can't remember why I never left a review maybe because I was so excited about the results! ---I increase the cumin to 1/2 Tbsp and also add 1/4 tsp garam masala, it rocks.  This is is my go to recipe for beans, refried or not.  Thank you ChefClaude!

WONDERFUL Flavor! I added 3 strips of lightly fried bacon  during the simmering process, and removed them when the beans were done. I also substituted 1/2 cup milk, plus the 1/2 cup broth.
Tasted so authentic... just like traditional Mexican home-cooked beans should!

This came out perfect. Very easy to make. I had to add more water for the first few hours until it boiled down some. My husband suggested more seasoning, maybe chili powder but that's the beauty of this dish: you can spice it up as you like. Thank you!

These beans are fantastic! Note: if you soak the beans over-night then you only have to have them in your slow cooker on high for 5 hours. Also, don't add salt until beans are done. Adding salt beforehand can make the skins on the beans remain tough. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were great!  Thanks to all the helpful reviews I learned to cut back on the salt, so I used some chicken bouillon cubes instead of plain salt.  Instead of manually mashing the cooked beans, I put them in the Kitchen Aid mixer with the whisk attachment (and a little lard), and they turned out good and creamy.  I don't think my family believed that I actually cooked them.!!  I was told multiple times that they were 'restaurant quality'.   This recipe goes in the keeper file!

The first time I made this was a disaster.  The beans were still hard after 8 hours and I had big chunks of onion.  The second time I soaked the beans for a few hours and sliced the onions.  Turned out wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

I worked at Taco Bell in the 70's and I came in early to cook the beans and meat for the day.I used beans,water,armour lard and salt.That is it.They were cooked in 2 big pressure cooker's.When done I used a big electric whisk to finish them.We never re-fried them.I don't know what they do now but these are better.I love the addition of cumin to them.

The reason the dish is called 'refried' is because they are twice-cooked beans: first the boiling, then the frying (or baking if preferred). This is just mashed up boiled beans - and it's the second cooking which gives frijoles refritos their texture and taste. Sometimes shortcuts don't quite work out -  I'm glad I tried this with only a tiny bag of beans.

Great recipe. I added a cup of grated Monterey Jack cheese after it was finished, and let it melt. Also, after you've made the beans, you're left with a fair bit of liquid. I was making tacos at the same time, and used this liquid instead of water in the ground beef seasoning, and it was amazing.

We make these just about every time we cook Mexican food. The only difference I make is I use chicken broth instead of water, or either I add a little chicken buillion paste to the water. Sometimes they are so good any flavorful we just eat the beans whole without mashing them. They freeze well that way too.

I stuck to the recipe except for using chicken broth instead of water, and omitting the salt (until serving), and reducing the liquid by 1 cup.  I just thought it seemed like a lot.  I cooked on low for about 14 hrs, and then mashed.  I added a bit too much of he liquid back in, and they were a bit soupy for me, but that was my own error.  The next day they were better.  My BF who doesn't even care much for beans even liked these a lot.  My son couldn't believe these were homemade.  haha  Will make again for sure.

the only reason why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because i think it calls for way too much salt (and pepper for me).  i would only add 2 tsp salt and maybe no pepper next time (due to personal preference - not a fan of pepper).  i would be curious to see how it turns out if you cooked it in a beef broth instead of the water - or maybe 3/4 broth and the rest water.  good, healthy recipe otherwise and easy to make.  thanks!

These were the best and so easy, too.  The thought of 5 tsp of salt scared me, so I only used 2.  Next time, I will try 3 tsps of salt OR put in some chicken base.

These are so good! I haven't bought a can of refried beans in months. I've made these several times with great results, this recipe makes a lot (which is a very good thing) so you'll have plenty to freeze for later. My husband loves to spread the beans on a tostado along with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. A yummy cheap meal (which is also a good thing!) My thanks to Chef Claude for this 5 star recipe!

These are great vegan beans! I did add more spices than listed: 3-4 tsp cumin, 1 jalapeno, 4-5 cloves garlic, cayenne to taste.
Since many reviewers said it was too salty, I only used half the salt in the beginning, but it ended up being bland. In the end, I added the 5 tsp salt listed.

I have made a similar manner for years, but I add dried chili peppers instead of jalapeno when I make them and use two BIG onions. I dont add any other seasonings at this point.  When they are done, I freeze containers of them (2 cups each).  Then when I am ready to use I add seasonings.  I vary the seasonings - sometimes is it cumin only. sometimes it is curry only, sometimes a combination of them.  Any way if you dont add a lot of seasonings they are super versatile and so good for you. With all the seasonings I dont feel they need salt, but I generally dont salt food. One other thing, I do mine in a pressure cook and cook on high for 90 minutes.

Great recipe as is however due to personal preferences I would reduce the black pepper to 1/2t next time.  I did this recipe in my pressure cooker on high pressure for an our and the beans turned out great.  Next time will pressure cook about 15 minutes longer to get the beans slightly softer.

This is definitely a keeper! With the reviews, I made these changes: 1 small can diced green chilies (for our taste), part chicken broth instead of all water, and decreased salt to 2 tsp. Just perfect!  If you have a small household, scoop out meal-sized portions of beans onto a wax paper-covered cookie sheet. Put in the freezer until frozen, then transfer to a freezer bag for long term storage. Then just pull out a portion each time you need it.

Chefclaude these are divine. I did take note of others and reduced the salt by half.I also increased the cumin to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I  did not mince the garlic. I just threw in about 8 small peeled cloves of garlic with the onion. I drained the beans and then pulsed them in the cuisinart. These things are addictive. Silky and NON FAT!!!!!

I will never buy canned beans again!  This recipe is so cheap, so easy, so flavorful and SO MUCH BETTER than the canned stuff!  I like to add more cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and a can of diced green chiles right before mashing.  I also add a dash of cayenne for a little extra heat.  Delicious!!!!!

These are incredible. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I didn't measure the garlic (I used 5 - 7 cloves)and I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I used a can of diced green chiles. I also used 2 or 3 chicken bullion cubes to cook the beans in broth and omitted the salt because there's plenty of sodium in bullion cubes.  The beans are so good! They're super easy to make and take no prep time at all. It's nice to know exactly what's in them and that they are fat and perservative free. It makes me feel like I'm eating a little healthier.   At first we just ate them plain as a side dish, but they were so good that we used them in tacos and burritos. Super YUM! Thanks Chef Claude! This recipe is a keeper. We ate the last of the first batch last night and I've already got more cooking in the crock pot this morning.

I can't believe I haven't rated this before! I make this all the time and it tastes much better than the canned store bought type.  Only, I like my beans really mushy, so I do this a little differently than what the recipe states. I soak the beans in the crock pot overnight, then turn on low in the morning and leave it on that day and through the night.  By the next day, they are mushy enough for me to squash w/o too much effort. Then, I put them in zip lock baggies to save for later.

These beans are worth the effort. I made them for a work function and many people said they were the best beans they'd ever had. You won't miss the fat either.

Entirely as good as any of the canned ones, with no unpleasant affects later on in the evening. I would like more onion flavor next time, so I'll be sure to use a huge onion, or a couple smaller ones.

I've made this several times and it never disappoints! So easy and delicious. I also add a little chili powder and sometimes some red pepper flakes for a touch of heat. Leftovers freeze very well, and are a snap to defrost for the next taco night.

My husband and I really liked this recipe and he normally doesn't like beans AT ALL!  I did omit the jalepeno - the hubby doesn't like it in anything, and I doubt our almost 2 year old would like it.  I thought the recipe called for too much ground pepper so I only used 1 tsp and I still thought it was wayyyyyyyyy to peppery for my taste.  I'm only going to use 1/2 tsp next time around.  Remove some of the broth and use a hand immersion blender until your desired consistency.  I've used that method for years.  I have always made beans on the stove, but wanted to try the crockpot so when I came across this recipe, thought I'd change my normal recipe too.  I'm gonna stick with this version.  I never got any complaints about my old recipe, but I like this one (minus the extra pepper).

I have made this recipe about half a dozen times. So delicious, easy, and nutritious. I have used it in burritos, or as a side with eggs in the morning, or as a dip with chips as an appi. Freezing them as burritos with cheese has been a delicious emergency lunch too.

I am done buying canned refried beans now that I've tried this recipe! I made it exactly as instructed and it was delicious. I prefer things more salty so I added salt to my portion instead of making the beans oversalty. It was a huge hit at an office potluck. Cheap, flavorful and healthy. A+ on this recipe.

Delicious but can be salty. I follow the recipe almost exactly. I chop onion, reduce salt to 3 teaspoons and cook it in a Dutch oven (so I reduce water accordingly). It's really good and freezes well. So it can be cooked well in advance.

This recipe is awesome! Excellent results with minimal effort! I reduced the salt to about 3 teaspoons, and I added a whole, de-seeded jalapeno. I used the food processor to mash the beans, which made it even easier. I did add about 2-3 teaspoons of safflower oil when I was mashing because I prefer low-fat to fat-free. I froze half of the beans in a quart-sized Mason jar and served the other half in bean burritos. (I also froze the leftover "bean broth" to use as a soup base or to cook rice.) They were very good, but I have to say that the beans tasted best the second day (they didn't make it to a third day...) because sitting in the fridge overnight allowed the spices to stand out more. Next time, I think I will add some more cumin and another jalapeno. Even though I added a whole red jalapeno, I couldn't taste any heat at all. I will definitely make this again! My boyfriend is already requesting a second batch with a reserved jar for him to freeze, since he doesn't have a slowcooker of his own.

Exceptionally tasty! My one year old loved them, too. I modified the recipe using suggestions from 100daysofrealfood.com. I changed the beans to 2 cups (which is one bag and much easier than having half a bag open), 6 cups of water, slightly more cumin than suggested (hearty pinch), 2 garlic cloves instead of the 2 tbsp, and I left out the jalapeno because I was feeding this to a baby. I did need to add a little more salt for my liking. It is fantastic with a little shredded cheese on top and slices of avocado. Yum!

I had lots of dried pinto beans and was looking for a recipe without all the fat.  This one fit the need just perfectly.  I was a little skeptical about not chopping the onion but I followed as directed and found it cooked up nicely and also mashed perfectly with the potato masher at the end.  I used 1/2 jalapeno as directed but think it could easily have handled a whole pepper w/o overpowering.  Did not add any salt until the end and then just used about 2-1/2 t which seemed to be plenty for our taste.  Cooked in my slow cooker as directed, never needed any additional liquid - drained a lot off when they were done.  They reheated nicely the next day too.  This recipe will be used again and again at my house.

Just a note from an old bean cooker.  DO NOT add salt, nor salt laden products to the cooking beans until they are nearly done cooking.  If you add the salt, the beans become tough and take much longer to reach a "cooked" state.  I will not use the recommended salt for this recipe because I am on a salt restricted diet; but I can add some at the table, or hot sauce and peppers which eliminate the need for salt flavoring, almosst.

We halved the recipe and it was plenty.  4 hours on high and 4 hours on low was MORE than enough time, it probably would have worked at 8 hours on low.  After mashing I baked in the oven with shredded cheese on top.  Delish.

These are good!  We ate as burritoes for lunch with sour cream, tomato and cheese.  Bf said they are just the same as canned beans and the only thing he added to it was salt and pepper (I didn't salt mine, thinking we could always add it if needed) and 2 teaspoons of lime juice.  I did put in about a teaspoon of cumin in and added taco seasoning--about a teaspoon and a half--at the end.  I used two chicken bullion cubes and used about 3/4 teaspoons of pepper just in case it was too much.  I wanted to use all pinto beans, but the bag I had only had 2 1/2 cups, so I added a 1/2 cup of black beans.  When all was said and done, I had 3 leftover cups of water, so 6 cups were absorbed into the beans.  I'm freezing the water for soup.  I was able to mash them easily with a potato masher in the crock pot.  I have a programmable crock pot, and it doesn't have a 8 hour setting on high, so I put them on low for 10 hours and they were perfect the next morning.  These are easily modified to taste, and so easy to make.  This recipe does make a ton, so I'm freezing the rest.

First of all, I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO STORE BOUGHT REFRIED BEANS! I do think it's completely necessary to cut back on the salt -- 3 teaspoons is sufficient! They are WAY too salty otherwise. I use my electric mixer in the crockpot (after draining most of the liquid; adding as I need more moisture). Our favorite variation is to use all black beans. Yum!

i was disappointed at the lack of flavour ... i think 9 cups of water was way too much for my slow cooker, because there was so much left in the end. it seemed like the water absorbed the flavour and not the beans.

Since I needed the beans in 15 minutes, I mashed a can of beans that look like pinto beans (different one, but tastes just like it), added about 5 finely chopped slices of pickled jalapenos and 1/3 of very finely chopped red onion, the garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and voila! I had the most delicious refried beans on a budget - and they tasted better than the ones you buy in a can :)

This recipe was incredibly easy and tasty.  Like others, I reduced the amount of salt and also added a little taco seasoning.  I used them to make beef and bean burritos, freezing them for easy lunches.  Will make again!

Good for a healthy version, but just not the same flavor without the added fat.

OMG- these were SO good!! I added a little chicken stock, but otherwise followed the recipe. Since it's just my husband and myself, I cut the recipe in half- now I wish I had made the full recipe!!

I've made this a few times.  I was skeptical about being able to put dried, unsoaked, beans in the crock pot and have them turn out ok for this recipe, but IT WORKS!  This recipe is truely a no-fuss recipe and it makes a ton!  I added some dried chipotle seasoning for some extra kick and taste.  My family uses it for burrito filling.  You can also make your own frozen burritos with this mixture.  Just add any ingredients you want for your burrito, wrap it in parchment paper (or cling wrap), place in a freezer bag until ready to use.  When ready to use, take your burrito out of the freezer, unwrap, cover and microwave on high for about 2 minutes (or until hot in the center.)  Enjoy!

I cooked this on low since I was gone more than 8 hours then turned it up on high when I got home so the final mix was soupy but absolutely wonderful. This would make a good bean soup or if thickened further as it was intended, serve as a side of refried beans.  Love it!Love it! Love it!

I made these for a Mexican potluck lunch at work.  It is a very easy recipe and was very good, the only changes I made were to use half water and half low sodium chicken broth, and cut way back on the salt, added it later to taste.  I think next time I will make a few more changes.  I will add one to one and a half jalapenos, double the garlic and the cumin.  Definitely a good recipe, and can be adjusted easily to one's tastes. And, definitely do not mash the beans too much, leave them a bit chunky, a much better texture.

When you're making refried beans, it's best to not put the salt in until after the beans have cooked, otherwise, like corn, the beans stay pretty hard.  I found that out when this sort of thing happened to me, and I looked up other recipes online and one said this.  So, as long as you keep the salt out till the end, and reduce it a little, this is a great recipe!  Just enough jalapeno to give it a little zest, but not enough for it to be too spicy.  Thanks!

Our new favorite recipe. Because of sodium restrictions I use salt-free seasoning instead of salt. Sometimes we mash them into refrieds and other times we just leave the beans whole. Turns out perfect every time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy and very delicious. We made burritos with cilantro lime brown rice, and a little bit of cheese.

I upped the cumin, used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth and 5 cups water. I ladled out the liquid instead of trying to strain it from a hot slow cooker. Save the liquid, you may need to add some when warming up leftover beans.

I will make this recipe over and over.

Loved it!  Goes great with Taco Salad or Cornbread.  I did not mash the beans and they were just as good.  I used 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth, 5 cups of water and 1 tsp of salt.  I used 1 tsp of cumin and chopped jalapenos from a jar.  I served it with sour cream and chopped green onions. Chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce would be great in this. Next time, I will use a tblsp of Cajun Seasoning instead of the Cumin for variety.

First off, I live at a high altitude (a bit over 7,000 ft.) but the beans were still done after 8 hours, which is awesome. I didn't use jalapeno, which I think I will next time as these were bland. Also WAY too salty, probably 3 teaspoons (or less) is enough, especially if you are eating it with cheese, as that adds salt anyway. I doubled the cumin (in another recipe I have it calls for 2 tsp. with this many beans).

SO good!  I use this recipe to make cheesy rice and bean burritos, but it's just as tasty eaten on its own as a side dish.  My changes: I mince the onion instead of halving it so I'm not left with large parts of onion in the end result.  I only use 2 tsp of salt.  I omit the jalapenos.  And 1/4 tsp of cumin is absolutely necessary to keep it from being bland!  I've found that 6-7 hours is enough time for the beans to cook.  I like them to be the same consistency as mashed potatoes, so I don't add any of the drained bean broth back into the mashed beans.

I made this recipe for 10 servings. I so wish I had made it for the default 15 so I could have more leftovers. As others have stated I substituted 1/2 of the water for chicken stock. We used them on tostadas and the beans got rave reviews from my family of hungry eaters. I usually eat much later than my family does and adding the cooking liquid as the refried beans cook down only made them more flavorful. I will never buy canned beans again! This recipe was so good that I finally decided to write a review even though I have subscribed to this website for many years and have found many other excellent recipes.

I grew up with Hispanic friends and had a elderly Hispanic woman living near me who taught me to cook real Mexican food. I also measure a Mexican restaurant by their rice and beans that being said I have never had refried beans with Jalapeno in them.

Very simple, cook the beans in chicken stock period. You can add the spice of your choice ie cumin, chili powder, garlic or pepper. When the beans split open then mash until the thickness you like is achieved. This is a case of simple is much better.

overall the taste is really really good, but it is salty.  Next time I make them with half the salt, but that's the only bad thing I can say about it....you can always add more salt, but you cant take it away

Loved the recipe and would have given it 5 stars but I made it with some changes. First, I only used 1t salt, 1 1/2 cups pinto beans and 1 1/2 cups black beans. Finally, I put it on low for 8 hours.

So yummy!  Fortunately I made them too spicy for my kids, so there is more for me!  I only used about 3 t salt & added about 4 t sodium free chicken bouillon.  Using remaining broth to make smoked sausage & bean soup.

I followed this recipe as stated with one exception and that was to add the salt at the end of the cooking process.  That way you can use the amount of salt that suits your taste.  Mine was less.  Also I want to note that my beans only took 6 hours on high to soften.  If you should need to add extra water, be sure to add hot as cold will sometimes turn the beans dark.  The next time I will cook them without the garlic, just personal preference.

My go to bean recipe every time.  Very good.  I forgot the jalapeño pepper this last time but was still good.  I used an emersion blender in the crock pot at the end to make it even easier (did drain it a bit).

Very good recipe, used less salt as other reviewers suggested.  These beans turned out great and were so easy to make!  I don't suggest making these overnight, they smell so good you'll be wanting to get up from bed and eat!

Really very good!  We like pinto beans, so we just drained the beans and ate them as is instead of mashing them.

So easy, so good. I usually just add a small can of diced green chiles instead of the jalapeno because my wife can't take the heat. I use to food processor to mash up the beans after cooking. I have noticed that a little salty (3 tsp is about right). This is the only recipe you'll ever need!

Good idea to use slow cooker... don't add any salt til after the beans are tender... I've always heard & read that salt hinders the beans' reconstitution (or rehydrating) process... wait til after they are tender to liking & then season.  It's also a good idea to presoak the beans or do the quick soak method first as it's scientifically said to reduce gas...

GREAT! I have been wanting to make these for a long time, glad I did today! I removed  2 1/4 cups liquid too much and the beans were still a litle runny. Forgot the jalapeno. Used some onion/garlic salt, reduced total salt amount. Added 1 tsp chicken bouillon. Used more cumin. Next time I think I will add another cup of beans. Oh, and I used less pepper.  Im going to heat them tomorrow to go with Lime Chicken Soft Tacos and Mexican Rice II. Also I used only 1 tsp pepper and my dh said beans were too peppery. I didn't.

Good but wayyyyyy to salty.  I wish I read others' comments about the salt.  I'm amazed at how much flavor comes from so ingredients.

I just put on the 4th pot of these beans.  This time I've mixed pintos and black beans.  I did adjust the salt by half and added more cumin for our tastes.  We have never made refried out of these beans.  We end up eating them as bean soup and the leftovers seem to disappear in lunches.  Thanks for this great basic recipe.  It's wonderful!

Much more yummy than canned refried beans.
I cooked this in my pressure cooker for 25 min and they came out perfect.

Just delicious!  I made them exactly as written.  My husband and I both felt they did not need any additional liquid and they were perfect.  For the leftover, I added juice because I know they'll need it since I froze 3 packages.  As others have said, I'll never buy canned again.

Perfect!  I did use 2 jalapenos and kicked up the spices.  Had them on a crispy tortilla with melted cheese, chopped tomatoes and jalapenos.  Just loaded the freezer with about 14 individual servings.  Thank you.

These are great!  I used a whole jalapeno and onlly 3 tsp. salt. I also added 2 slices of bacon; cooked them in a slow cooker for about 8+ hours. They were delicious the way they were w/out mashing them too! I portioned them into freezer bags and froze them. Thank you so much for the recipe!

These were fantastic.  I too will ONLY make them this way -- when I have time.  I saw recipe & went right to the kitchen with the recipe on my Android phone.  I put it all in the crockpot & went to bed.  I live in a small, 1 story home & I smelled them ALL night!!  only make during the day - the heavenly aroma will consistently wake you up otherwise.  

I had them today after a 6 mi. run. I had a cooked baked potato I diced & sauted a small amount of 
green pepper.  Put a mound of beans in a saute pan with the peppers & potatoes, flatten a bit - sprinkle on some chedder cheese & broke an egg in the middle & covered till egg set. This made me last 5 hours before I was hungry.  MMMmmm.  For dinner I took plain corn tortilla chips, put some warmed up beans on them - shredded cheese & salsa - zapped it in the nuker & put it on a bed of spinach.  Good thing I live alone!!

Someone wrote that the onion totally dissolved. Not so but I took most of the onion & diced it up very fine & added to the beans. 

This recipe is a keeper

Love this! Cook it almost every other week. One caveat: 5 teaspoons of salt made it grossly salty. Drop it down to 2 or 3 and it's perfect. I also put in a whole jalapeno to give it some extra kick.

Really great. As good as it gets for being fat-free.  So much better than the canned.  I added the whole jalepeno (with seeds) and did not think it was too spicy.  After straining I mixed it with my stick blender right in the crock pot.  I blended after only 6 hours on high and it was fine (Next time I will do the full 8 hours, but it was dinner time and we were ready).  It makes a lot so I will freeze the rest.  This would be great for a seven layer dip.  Thanks!

I was extremely concerned that the dry beans would not cook, but these were great.  We thought they were better BEFORE they were mashed, so when I make them again, we will eat them as whole beans.  I did use an entire jalapeno and a little more cumin; HOWEVER, I will definitely reduce the salt to to at least half.  I have also found that 7 cups water is plenty.

FIVE teaspoons of salt!?!  NO!! Cut it down to 1/2 teaspoon and add some Mexican oregano and adobe seasoning.  The bean flavor shines without the sodium mask.

Very good and much healthier than many refried bean recipes.  I used one can of low fat beef broth in place of 1 cup of the water and added the whole jalapeno pepper.  I also added 1/2 a dried ancho pepper and 1/2 slice of bacon for flavor.

I've made this several times with several variations...I'm very happy with:  I make a double batch of this once or twice per month..(1/2 c./day is good for lowering cholesterol)..I degass the beans, [bring to boil rinsed beans on stove for 2 min., remove from heat, SLOWLY add 2 Tbsp baking powder while stirring, let sit covered for 2 hrs....rinse well 2 x's]  I proceed on stove with:  no onion, 1 whole fresh jalapeno for flavor, reduce pepper a bit, cumin, no salt, chicken boullion, garlic powder instead of fresh, onion powder.  Cook on low for 2 1/2 hrs.  I set most aside and mash a little for my daughter...delish!  Freeze in small quantities for later.  Thanks for the recipe ChefClaude!

Taste is good, way too runny. Had to add a cup of dry beans and let it simmer in crock pot in order to thickeDidnt add the salt since the main reason to make them was to cut out salt from my diet...added whole jalapeno and a little extra garlic.

Tried these the first time as written.  Excellent, but not quite exactly what I was looking for.  Looked around at other recipes and I now use this with the addition of a TB or so of bacon fat, a little corn oil  and upped the cumin to 1/2 tsp.    I also add salt (just 1 TB for us) near the end of cooking time just to make sure they are tender when I'm ready to serve.  Salt added at the beginning can increase cooking time in dried beans.  Pre-soaking will help reduce the less than desired side effect of eating beans as well.

I'm stumped. I followed this recipe exactly, but there is just something weird about them. I think it must be the smell, because the beans themselves are bland, and even eating them as a thin spread between homemade tortillas with Mexican rice, habenero sauce, sour cream lettuce and tomato is still making my stomach turn a little.  I don't think I'll even bother saving the leftovers. The recipe is too basic (beans in a slowcooker) to even give it some credit for being a good base.

Great recipe (with proper seasoning) and darn near foolproof. Only changes I made was add more a lot more cumin and chicken broth in place of the water. After tasting it, I did add some dried oregano and a bit of ground coriander. This is one instance where I'm thankful I kept my old fashioned potato masher. I will NEVER, EVER buy canned refried beans again. EVER!

I have tried so many bean recipes and this is the best....and the simplest.  I used half pintos/half black beans.  1 T. canned diced jalapeno.  I soaked the beans overnight so it did not take 8 hours in the crock pot.  I used a potato masher to mush them up.  It made the healthiest, yummiest bean burrito.  Oh...and don't add the salt until the beans are fully cooked.  It seems better that way.  Thank You!

I love the idea of making refried beans from scratch.  I used a weak chicken broth instead of water and added a bit of chili powder (1 tsp.) and doubled the cumin.  Only added a little salt while cooking so I could taste and add as needed after.  We don't like things too hot so I used some pickled jalapeno rings diced up in place of the fresh jalapeno.  I think green chiles would be good too.  The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars is because I felt the beans needed to cook WAY longer than stated here.  I started it at 8:30 in the morning thinking I'd be ready to mash them up by 4:30 that evening.  Luckily, I didn't need them that night because they needed more time.  At that point I turned my crockpot down to low and let them go overnight.  After cooking all night the color had deepened and they were a nice texture.  I didn't get around to mashing them till that afternoon and they were perfect.  They are in the fridge now to be used in a recipe later this week so I saved some of the cooking liquid to thin them if necessary on the reheat.  They tasted really good!

Second time...Based on past recommendations, I also cooked with 8 cups of chicken broth (all that would fit in my crockpot) and one tsp. of cumin.  I completely omitted the salt and added 4 strips of bacon (took it out before I refried).  I also swapped the jalapeno pepper for a 7 ounce can of mild green chiles and only used 1/2 an onion because I have little ones.  We did try black beans in place of pinto the first time around, but my family of 6 loved the pinto beans much more. Definitely the end of canned refried beans for us!  Excellent recipe with the minor changes.

As mentioned by others, I will *never* buy canned beans again.  These are killer. Finished in my crockpot in about 4 1/2 hrs.  They also freeze well.

These beans are awesome!! I grew up in So. Cal., but it took me a few years after marriage to figure out what to do with dried beans. I thought I had my perfect refried bean recipe until I tried this one....so easy and delicious!!! 
The 1st time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, but the next time and the many times there after, I tweaked it to my family's liking....I use chicken broth, add just enough salt to taste if needed,added a half of a seeded Serrano pepper, and extra cumin, a little chile powder and sugar. Save and use the reserved liquid from the beans also. I mash them right in the crockpot with a electric hand mixer, even less cleanup which is always a plus :)
My family, friends and anyone who tries these love them, and they are so easy it's ridiculous. I would give 10 stars if I could. Thanks for a great recipe!

My crockpot gets very hot so last night right before bed I got this ready and cooked the beans on LOW for 8 hours. Perfect! I mashed these in the crockpot with my hand blender to save on cleanup, and didn't need much of the reserved liquid. Much better than canned beans, will make again.

These were so good!! and easy! They're a little too spicy for my 2 yr old (loves RF beans!) so next time I will cut down on the jalapeno. This will definitely replace the store bought beans! I simmered them on my stovetop b/c my crock it too tiny.

The flavor is INCREDIBLE!  We added the juice of one lime and a pinch of bacon drippings to the original recipe.  Thank you so much for an incredible recipe!  We will NEVER use canned refried beans again!

I made this recipe yesterday and used 4 cups of chicken broth, 5 cups water.  Cooked for 4 hours on high, 4 hours on low and these beans came out fantastic!  Even my extremely picky 10 year old gobbled them up!! We don't like spicy things, so I left out the jalapeno, and I still though they were great!

These are so, so good! I'd give it more stars if I could. I left half the beans as is because I don't care for refried beans. My family loves refried so I mashed half. I can't believe these taste so yummy without any meat. I did use 1 can of roasted garlic chicken broth in place of some of the water. I will enjoy pinto beans & cornbread tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe.

These retried beans are great, will never buy canned retried beans again.  Followed recipe and only omitted the jalapeños so the kids would eat them and they ended up having two servings each.

I don't like biting into onions so I thought should chop them up but I trusted the recipe instead..with the beans cooking for so long it was as if the onions weren't even there....I loved this super easy recipe.

I made these beans exactly as written (with the optional cumin) and they were delicious!  They were so good that I made tacos with them.  I used warmed corn tortillas with beans and shredded cheese.  I will be making these again for sure.  This recipe is so easy to just throw everything in the crockpot and forget about it for a few hours.

This recipe is way too salty and has too much pepper.  I made the recipe as written, should have read the reviews first.  I guess it is a simple fix so 2 stars instead of 1 star.

I was raised on beans with pork, my mom was from the south. These are by far the best beans I have ever had. I am now a vegitarian and the flavor in this recipe is wonderful. I did decrease the salt when I made them. Theses will go into my frequent rotation. Yum!

It takes hours to make the refried beans (Mexican way), and the beans doesn't come out; well; like beans.  This recipe is easy and the beans is very flavorful.  My hubby loves this recipe, no more making bean the traditional way.

I doubled the recipe for a party.  After it was cooked, I strained the liquid off into another pot and then mashed the beans in the crock, adding the captured bean water as I went. Two things I would've done differently are:  cut down the salt and add a lot more liquid than I thought I needed because the warm setting on my crock pot really dried up the beans.  Great recipe!

I tried it and it came out so delicious. I added bacon grease and it gave it amazing flavor. (so I recommend the bacon grease.)
Also be quite careful about the salt in this recipe. It is WAY too much! Add less salt or add salt slowly and gradually until you get the taste you desire.

Loved this!   I did take recommendations from other reviewers. I used tomato paste, and chicken broth in place of water, and just because I love it, I threw in a chipotle pepper.  I can't help but echo,  I'll never buy a can of sauce again!  Ty ** I like to add a couple drops of liquid smoke as well.

I have made this many times. It's easy and economical, and leaves plenty of leftovers. I always think I'll freeze them but then they end up getting eaten. The only change I make is to add a full tsp of cumin, oh and I also decrease the salt to 3 tsp. This one is a keeper.

This is delicious!  I double the recipe and used 5 cups of chicken broth (all I had) and the rest water and filled the crock until it was about 1" from the top.  Then I just stirred occasionally throughout the day.  I left out the jalapeno and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  When the beans were done, I put them in my food processor with only a little of the juice until I reached desired consistency and also added in a little sour cream which really seemed to set it over the top.

So easy, so good!! My husband even LOVES them! I I used black beans first couple batches. Tasted great even with jalapeno out of jar. I used about 4T himilayan salt - 5 would have been too much I think & I am a big salter. Made a batch and froze in 2 cup portions - won't be buying refried beans anymore! No cheaper or better way to have organic "refried" beans!

I like beans but I just don't like refried beans. When I go to Mexican restaurants, I always ask them to leave them out because I just don't like them at all. 
We've been cooking/eating Mexican food a lot lately using slow cooker and after seeing how many reviews this one had, I just wanted to try it for my husband cause he likes refried beans.
To my surprise, I liked them very much, too. They were really good and I thought they completed my Mexican meals. I am looking forward to having them again with my slow cooked carnita(which is also from this site) for dinner tonight(we had them for lunch as well). I think just simple bean burrito with some rice and cheese would be good, too.

Delicious, but makes a lot so have containers on hand to freeze extra. I love having extra beans saved away for quick nachos or burritos.

DELICIOUS! 8 hours on high was perfect cooking time. As advised, I used 9c chicken broth instead of water. I put the whole onion (cut in half not chopped up) in there and it almost fully dissolved. I added in some oregano, cumin, cayenne, & chili powder in with everything. After everything was cooked I drained out the liquid & big onion pieces, transferred the beans to a saucepan, added 1c shredded cheese and 1 packet taco seasoning to it, and mixed with a hand mixer. I will never buy canned refried beans again! Featuring this recipe to my blog thank you!

easy recipe to fallow!! throw in the crock pot and wait.  I substituted 1/2 the water for veggie broth and added more peppers and cayenne pepper to jack up the spice.  Then I froze half of it because it's just me and it froze great.

Loved these beans!!! They were so easy to make and so tasty!  Nobody could believe they were homemade! So much better than opening a can.  I definitely recommend using chicken  broth or add chicken bouillon to the water  in place of plain water.  It really helps kick up the flavor.

I love this recipe. Make it every week. We use chopped green chiles instead of jalapenos. Instead of mashing them we blend them with our stick blender. They are so perfect. Better than any Mexican restaurant.

Subbed chicken stock for water. Used a can of green chiles in place of jalapeño. Need to eliminate salt altogether if using stock! Ran beans through food processor which made them creamy & delicious. Served with Cojita cheese sprinkled on top. Big hit at my carne Asada party.

I've been cooking my beans in a slow cooker for years.  This is a good recipe.   One of the greatest attributes of  allrecipes.com is the comment section.  It is so helpful to read other's suggestions and experiences in cooking a specific recipe.

My father-in-law is from Mexico and taught me how to make refried beans 40 yrs ago and my family loved them, but I tried this recipe and they thought these were the best they've ever eaten (and we eat them about 4 times a week). The only thing different I did was add a piece of meat while cooking it really adds that little extra flavor. Love these beans!!!!

I'll never buy canned refried beans again! This was incredibly easy and sooo tasty! I made this exactly as written, with one exception - I used the whole jalapeno not just half. Next time, I'd use less garlic and less salt; however, I say that as I'm eating my third helping today. ;-) I started this out on high and it boiled over...so I dropped it to low. All in all, it was on high for about 3 hours and on low for almost 10 - I fell asleep and turned it off in the morning. These beans are creamy, totally flavorful, mash well, and reheat beautifully! Definite keeper!!

I rarely write reviews for recipes but this is the exception. If I could give these 10 stars I would. They were better than any can beans by far. I ate them breakfast, lunch and dinner. I kept sneaking spoons out of the slow cooker. These are the best refried beans I have ever had. The only change I was that I trippled the cumin because I love the taste. Great recipe.

I really thought these were perfect. I was concerned about cooking them for 8 hours on high but they were phenomenal. I soaked the beans overnight with a piece of kombu before cooking them (and cooked the kombu in with them). I also upped the garlic to 15 cloves and used garlic parsley salt instead of plain. Yum!

These are the BEST refried beans I've ever had that are fat free. I made mine on the stove because I had soaked the beans overnight. They cooked in about 90 mins. When they were done I took some of the liquid out and put my immersion blender right in the pot. So easy and quick. I love the ingredients and they all go together so well. None of the flavors are overpowering. This is a keeper.

Don't think I will ever use canned refried beans again! I used half chicken broth and half water and used a whole jalepeno. It had some kick for sure! Next time I will only use half a jalepeno, as it was a bit too hot. The salt content was right on. This is easy to prepare and makes your house smell so good!

EXCELLENT!!  I make this all the time!  Everyone loves it and it is so easy to make!  You do have to start it early in the morning in order for it to be ready for dinner but it is so easy.  Even my very picky 7 year old loves this in bean, cheese and rice burritos.  My daughter is very sensitive to spicy but the jalapeno is not spicy at all when the beans are in a burrito.  I buy my pinto beans in 1 pound bags so I use 1 pound of pinto beans and 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the 9 cups water.  I don't add salt until the end and do it to taste, not the 5 tsp.

FABULOUS recipe!  will never buy canned refried beans again!  Super easy, just toss in crock pot and walk away then come back 8 hrs later and hit with a hand mixer = DONE.  Tastes just as good, if not better, than anything I have ever had out of a can or in a restaurant.  its vegetarian (bonus!).  I used a whole seeded jalapeno and I didn't find it to be spicy at all.  My 2 year old was gobbling them up!  I also cut the salt down to 3 tsp and next time I will only use 2 as less salty suits my tastes better.  makes the equivalent of about 2 large cans so i used half and froze the other half.  Love that this recipe doesn't use (or need) lard for texture/flavor and you can control the salt & spices PLUS you don't have to worry about BPA lines cans!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!

I roasted my jalapenos, to remove the skin.  Nice to see another poster used chicken broth instead of plain water (as I did).  Didn't use nearly the salt called for, as we usually put so much other stuff in our burritos/enchiladas/what-have-you that the salt actually gets made up for.  Yum.   : )

I have made these about 1000 times, it is a great recipe!  I usually cut the salt by about half.  It is so easy to portion it out and put some in the freezer for an easy weeknight meal!

I have made these beans many times and I will never make them any other way.  It's so much easier and less messy than boiling them because it isn't necessary to keep an eye on them and they are ready to eat once they are done cooking (whereas if you boil them, then you still have to season and cook them).  I don't mash them up right away, but rather just keep them whole so that  I can use them for anything I want.  The flavor is great!  If you have hard water, then it is recommendable to add a tsp. of baking soda to the water so that they will soften better.

The strength of this recipe is in the process, I think. Using a slow cooker is a great time (and pots/pans/tools) saver. 

I pre-soaked the beans overnight in the crock pot (turned off), then drained them the next morning. 

After the pre-soak, I drained the beans, then added the other ingredients as listed. I only used enough water, however, to cover the beans with about 1/2 inch or so of water above them. I turned the crock on high for about four-and-a-half hours - essentially until I could taste that the beans were soft and the onion cooked. 

Instead of using a potato masher (which I started to use, but it was taking too long), I used my hand blender, which worked perfectly. 

Overall, I found the beans to be a bit bland, but a little hot sauce on top picked it right up. Before blending, I  tasted a sample of the beans atop some jasmine rice prior, and they were fine (with hot sauce). 

Then I blended the remaining beans in the crock pot and they worked up perfectly. This will be my favorite process for refried beans in the future. Easy peasy. 

But I do think that they're a tad bland for my taste. I'm going to experiment with seasoning in the future - maybe by adding a package of taco seasoning or something. Not sure yet, but it needs a bit of kick for my taste. Otherwise, it would be real good served with something else, like in a tortilla or burrito with cheese. I'm going to serve it to my husband tonight atop rice and with some chicken cubed on top.

So cheap and easy. I will be tweaking the spices to my preferences, as would anyone, but they are pretty tasty as is. I mashed them in my stand mixer (the same way I mash potatoes) making this just about the easiest process imaginable. Love.

As another reviewer said, "No more canned refried beans!" This recipe is easy, economical, and tasty. I made it as is, except for the following: I used 3 tsp salt, as most suggested, and used 1/3 canned chopped green chiles. One big thing to note:  SAVE the broth when you drain the cooked beans! I thought it looked like too much "water" was in the cooked beans, so I drained them all, then mashed them...adding some butter, cheese, and milk. However, they were still too dry. So I used about 3/4 cup of chicken broth and they turned out perfect. WHEW!!

OMGOSH!! these are YUMMY!! Tried this recipe once before and it was horrible (not sure what I did wrong) tried it again today and WOW!! Even my 7ry old who eats NOTHING, was eating a bowl full of this. I do NOT like Jalapenos OR Onions but as another reviewer had mentioned, they DISSOLVE when you mash them!! No need to pick them out even if you don't like them (I think taking them out they would lose flavor) I did use 3tsp salt as others suggested, but needed to add more after it was done. These are sooo good. I will be making these alot more often now!! Oh and I did not use a whole onion though (again, do NOT like onion) I think I only used maybe a 1/4 onion and still the flavor was great!!! so easy and so yummy!! If you don't like the flavor the 1st time, don't give up and adjust the seasonings to your preference... you will NOT be disappointed :)

UPDATE: Used the water from the beans to make the Mexican Rice II from this site (had no chicken broth) and it was devine!! My kids devoured their rice/beans/cheese burritos!!

As good as the reviews say! I used 2 tsp of salt and didn't think it was enough, but it's easy to salt later and impossible to unsalt, so I might not add much more in the future. Tasted just like my father's and were very easy. I did drain off quite a bit of the liquid, as suggested, and would drain more next time, because the mashed beans were quite thin and I had to put them in a skillet to reduce. Might try skipping the garlic next time, as the broth was a bit bitter and I think that's the culprit. All in all, though, deserves its five stars!

These tasted just like some I had at a mexican resturant recently but I added 4 cups chicken broth and 5 water, only 3tsp salt because of the broth. I would add a little less pepper and be careful with the cumin.

I cooked the beans on the stove top, because I didn't have enough time to do them in the crockpot.  They came out great!  I used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh (I thought with less cooking time, the garlic and onions wouldn't have time to "disappear" into the beans.  I also used powdered jalapeno peppers because I didn't have fresh.  I wasn't careful with the measurements, just added seasonings to taste. I did have to add an extra cup of water every hour or so.  Near the end of the cooking time, I though they might come out to saucy, but after using a potato masher to mash the beans a bit, they came out perfect. I love refried beans and I always wanted to make my own, but I thought they were hard to do.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

GREAT RECIPE! I did use chicken broth instead of water and cut the salt to a 1/4 teas. Also to cut down on the cooking time i mix everything the night before and placed in fridg. untill 6.00am in the morning - then cooked on high in crock pot..for 5 yrs. .The flavor and the ease of making this recipe is everything you could want.thanks for a great recipe!

The best ever!!!!!  I have never made refried beans before and I thought I would give it a go, well I am now on a second pot because we ate the first one so fast.  Do not buy store bought again.  This is easy and will be the best ones you have ever tasted.  I use 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water to give them a richer flavor.  Also remember that these do not need lard or butter which makes them actually good for you.  Great recipe.

amazing! never buying store bought again. I cut the recipe to 2 cups of beans/6 cups water because my slowcooker is a tad smaller than others, and also instead of cumin i used 2/3 tsp of a home made taco seasoning that has cumin in it. also used chicken bullion instead of salt. came out FANTASTIC!!!!

4.5 stars - 1/2 a star off due to amount of salt called for. Should also add salt at end of cooking so beans soften. I normally use 4 C's of dried beans as I freeze in portions for later uses. I do soak pinto's overnight and use stockpot to cook them. Anyway...I typically use more jalapeno but not minced. I cut in half, de-seed and toss em in. Upped the garlic, added a couple chopped up grn onion and 1/2 C rough chopped Cilantro. A versatile recipe you can add in other flavors easily.  Since I like mine "re-fried" - once I drain beans (step 2) I moved on to another recipe posted here 'Buffy's Refried Beans'. I definitely prefer making my own vs buying canned at store. Simple yet easily modified recipe to suite your own palate! Freezer friendly which for me is a bonus...thanks for the post~

These are pretty good. I like the addition of jalapeno pepper. Definitely adds a little something special. I doubled the recipe too.

Excellent recipe!  I made it as listed but substituted a can of low sodium chicken broth for the same amount of water, reduced the salt to 3 tsp and didn't mash all of the beans so it would still have a little texture.  Thanks for adding the advice about saving the bean liquid for thinning the beans, I did need to use almost a third of it.   Family loved it so I'll be making  this again.

My whole family loved these beans!! They were SUPER easy to make (just toss everything in the crock pot!). Great flavor, too. Mine seemed pretty done after 7 hours, then I switched my crock pot to low for the last hour.  I would definitely reserve the liquid, like they said. One, for making the beans the consistency you desire...and two, when you reheat leftovers, you can add more liquid so they don't dry out. I will always have these beans w/my Mexican dishes in the future!!

I've made these several times.  Easy and delicious.  I'll never by canned again.  I add more garlic, onion, and taco seasoning for added flavor.  They heat up well as leftovers too.

These were great. All three of my teens love refried beans so I was looking for a recipe that was easy, cheaper than store bought and one they would enjoy. This matched all my needs. They loved these. The only thing I did different was a hot soak on the beans before putting them in the slow cooker.

Extremely tasty and I would never guess they were not fried with fat.  If you pre-soak the beans overnight you can cut the slow cooker time in half.  Thank you for this recipe!

I forgot to add the salt to the beans and didn't have any jalapenos which may have affected my rating. I will revise it when I have tried it according to the recipe. However, I did have to add a lot more cumin since the flavor cooked off during the long cooking time. I may add some fat next time since it just didn't have that lush flavor.  Course how can the added calories really be that important.

I always make my beans this way... there is no reason to refry it is much healthier and you truly wouldn't know. A few tips/ideas... soak beans overnight for faster cooking, saute the onions and add at the end after mashing for more flavor.

the theory on these was good, but they were way too salty & peppery for our taste and didn't appear anything like the refried beans we enjoy at our favorite authenic mexican restaurant.  i would have much preferred la preferida authentic refried beans straight from the can!

I halved the amount of beans and water, but didn't change anything else. They weren't spicy at all and I think I'll increase the spices/seasonings next time. It also took *very* little of the cooking water to get them very creamy. Good stuff and I've got enough to eat a lot and freeze that much more.

I mad this as directed but with only 4 tsp. of salt.  They were great right then and even better the next day.  When I put them away I mixed in even more of the reserved liquid which I think not only kept them from being to dry but also added to their flavor.  I can't wait to try this with black beans!

Very good!  Thank you for the recipe.  I made these today, and then used them for bean and cheese burritos tonight.  Made 12 burritos, some to freeze, and still had beans leftover to freeze.  My changes, less salt, 1-4oz can of diced chilies and 2 mini red peppers thrown in whole.

very delicious!  i put the beans on low before i went to bed.  when i woke up i put them on high for 3-4 hours-the beans were perfect!  i waited until i had drained the juice to add the dried seasonings (and i only put about half the amounts of what the recipe called for)  this is just a perfect refried bean recipe because it has flexibility in it to where anyone can make it!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is nice to have control over fat/sodium levels in food.  I mixed these with my turkey burrito filling and the burritos were awesome.

Okay, this was really really good.  And talk about easy.  Gotta plan ahead though.  But it does make a ton, so you'll have plenty of leftovers for the next few days.  My family is now disappointed if we have frijoles from a can.

Love making these with half chicken broth, half water, and adding a tad of chili powder, basil, cayenne pepper, and extra cumin, and a couple sticks of celery, and then eating some as a bean soup (picking out onion and celery chunks) before mashing the rest up. Really yummy for a winter day, and I think it's so tasty when it doubles as a soup!

These were wonderful!  I took hints from other reviews and used 1/2 the salt.  I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, but I had a fresh serrano and I tossed it in (whole).  I used a hand blender to mash them.  The aroma in my house was heavenly all day!

Loved this recipe..so easy and delicious. I use with homemade chips [baked tortilla sprayed with oil and salted]. First layer refried beans, chopped tomato, green onions, chopped, jalapeno chips and top with bits of pasturized cheese. Heat on microwavable dish. Also, can add all the toppings you desire. Delish!

This recipe is awesome. I make this often. I don't use the salt and use low sodium chicken broth. There is enough sodium in the broth to flavor the beans.

Excellent flavor!  I soaked the beans overnight (add water to about 1-2 inches above the beans).  And then in the morning I drained the water.  And then I added 5 cups of (fresh) water (instead of the 9 cups that the recipe suggests).  If you decide to add chicken bouillon, either leave out the salt or add it to taste at the end, but only if you find it’s not salty enough (otherwise it’ll be too salty).  I also just threw in whole garlic cloves (instead of minced) - yum!  I checked on them throughout the day and stirred them occasionally to make sure they weren’t burning or drying out.  You could always add more water if you think they’re getting too dry.  And then boil them longer if there’s too much water.  And then when they were “done” (soft enough), the mixture was still quite watery but I just beat them to death with an electric mixer (I found I had to beat them for a while) and then they mashed up real nice and were just the right consistency.  If you find them to be a little dry, just add some (hot) water and beat them some more until they get to the consistency you like.

I will never buy can beans again. So simple to prepare. I did as others mentioned and used 1 cup of chicken broth for extra flavor and I added some extra jalapeno and 1 tbsp of chili powder.

This is GREAT!  So easy and so YUM!  I do agree with a previous review writter though.  5 tsps salt is waaaaaaay too much.  I used half that and it was more than enough.  Also, maybe my crock pot is hotter than others, but I cooked this on high 3 hours and low 4 and it was done.  Didn't need the whole 8 on high (i think it would have burnt if i did that.)  Overall---awesome recipe! definitely a keeper.  Freeze the extras for later.  Yum!

Great recipe overall, I substituted 3/4 of the water with chicken stock and doubled the onion and garlic. I also added two bay leaves. I didn't add salt until the beans were pretty much cooked and even with that I used probably 1 teaspoon of salt as the chicken stock has salt in it as well. This recipe is a keeper and will no longer be buying refried beans in a can. This is a tasty alternative.

I've been making this for a long time, and I didn't realize that I hadn't reviewed it before now.  This is a great bean recipe.  I usually start this right after dinner the day before we'll be eating it.  Before I go to bed, I add smoked ham shanks.  In the morning I remove the bones and shred the meat.  I usually don't measure anymore, and I use onion powder so I don't have to fish anything out.  I also use chicken bouillon cubes in the water and don't add any other salt.  After these slow cook for about a day, I skim off the extra liquid and mash, adding liquid back in as necessary.  I get requests to make these with homemade cornbread all the time, especially during football season!  People like them whole, mashed, and refried, so I tend to divide this up after it's cooked.  I do refry some of these for burritos in a skillet with a touch of bacon grease, splash of milk and a sprinkle of cheese.  Wonderful beans!

My first time doing refried beans that didn't include a can and I was delighted with the finished product.  I had enough to serve it with a meal and freeze some for later.  The jalapeno made me nervous, but it wasn't too hot at all...just added flavor.  THANK YOU!  Great recipe!

Soooo good!  I never needed to ad any more water while the beans were cooking and they came out perfect.  I would say I added close to 2 cups of the reserved liquid to get the perfect creaminess.  Thanks Chefclaude for the great recipe!

I love, love, love this receipe. Like most of my cooking it's not an exact science and I follow it as close as possible. A little extra salt and fresh lime juice adds just the right flavor. Born & Raised in California.

Mucho Gusto! Perfect recipe. Lots of room for variation with the beans.  I've used 1/2 black and 1/2 pinto, all pinto and also with all white peruvian beans.  An immersion blender works well to mash the beans. Highly recommend!

So good, so good, so good!  I made these today to go with mexican rice and grilled chicken and they were delicious.  I could have eaten them on their own in a flour tortilla they were so flavorful.  My husband couldn't get over how good the beans were.  I used 3 tsp. salt per other reviews and 1 tsp. cumin just because that's what we like.  Great recipe and cheaper and so much better than canned refried beans.  Worth the effort too.

I make this probably once a week.  I soak the beans the night before, rinse the beans in the morning and replenish the water, add all of the other ingredients, plus some chili powder and cook them on low for 10 hours.  When I get home from work they're ready to finish.  We love them in a bowl with brown rice, shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes, salsa, and maybe a little dollop of sour cream.  Great in burritos or on tostadas or nachos as well.  I can never eat canned refried beans again!

I was really disappointed after eagerly waiting all day for these beans to cook. They were unbelievably bland and try to doctor them up after the fact helped but there was still a weird aftertaste. The consistancy was fantastic which made having to discard them even worse.  I love refried beans but these were so bad I wont even try to alter this recipe and do it again.

I used black beans.  This recipe is SO easy and it tastes just like a Mexican restaurant.  I will NEVER buy canned beans again.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I have been looking for a way to feed my family cheap and this was perfect! I cooked the beans all day and served them over rice with cornbread for dinner. Then the next morning I smashed the leftovers which was still quite a bit and we had bean & cheese tacos for breakfast. I know that doesn't sound too good to some people but in South TX people eat tacos for breakfast. :) The only difference is I didn't add the jalepeno, I didn't have one on hand & I think it would have been too spicy for my kids. Thanks again!!

These were great. Based on others reviews I only used about 3 teaspoons of salt. Also I added the entire jalapeno, which added just enough spice to taste but not so much that I, as a true Minnesotan, couldn't eat it. And as a bonus, the crockpot was easier to clean than I expected! Thanks for a wonderful submission.

The only thing I don't like about this recipe is the color of the finished product, the more I mash/blend the lighter it gets.  I now simmer 3-5 California Chili Pods in chicken broth, blend, drain the beans and use the chili/broth mix to mash/blend.  This results in a beautiful deep, rich color.

Delicious!  These are so easy and so good.  I can't believe I ever bought canned refried beans.  I added a tiny bit of chili powder to the beans as they were cooking.

These beans are wonderful!  Okay so yes, I did make some slight changes. I reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp seasoned salt... and because my husband doesn't like onion I have to sneak it into recipes in the form of onion powder ... and then I added a whole chopped seeded jalapeno. I like this recipe because I can use it just like the canned beans and I think these beans have a better flavor than the canned varities.  Other people have said that these beans are bland...have you tried the canned beans? They are worse than bland.  These beans are the only thing I will use.  In fact ... I'm making a double batch so I can store extra in storage bags in the freezer to have on hand for burritos or dip or anytime we are needing refried beans. This is definately a keeper in our house.

These were wonderful and so easy to make! I'm used to soaking my beans before cooking and wasn't clear based on this recipe if I was supposed to do so. I soaked the beans overnight and they were done in the crockpot in about 3 hours. A big hit at my recent Southwestern-themed party!

This is great and very easy. I made a couple small changes.  I subed 1/2 chicken broth for water and I deseeded a jalepeno then diced it and put it in the crockpot all at same time. Was a bit spicy for our taste but the hubby loved the heat it gave.  Flavor is great

Love it!  This is a great recipe that will make its way to the top of your recipe box.  So easy, so tasty.  Don't be afraid of the jalapeno, it doesn't add any heat at all, just fresh flavor.

With so few ingredients, I had doubts about this. But it turned out fabolous - better than any other refried beans I've ever tasted! I put the whole jalapeno in since other reviewers said they could barely taste it, and you can still only barely taste it, which is perfect for me.

What an awesome and healthy recipe.  These are so good that I'm going to keep them in the fridge all the time even for an after school snack for the kids.  They loved them and had no idea how healthy they are.  These are super easy to make.  I used just water because I didn't have chicken broth and they were super tasty.  I think 15 servings cost me a whole $1.25 total.  I cooked them on high for 4 hours and then switched to low for 4 hours and then they were on warm for about five hours.  I mashed them about half way and then finished them with about a minute in my mixture.

This recipe is a true winner.  Thanks for posting it.

Best refried beans ever... I used 5 cups chicken broth and 4 cups of water. We love onion so I diced it up instead of halved. I used a whole jalepeno instead of half. I was a little concerned that a whole jalepeno would be too much spice but it left no spicy taste at all. I may use 2 peppers next time! After reading a few "too salty" reviews, I did not use any salt but they did need about 2 teaspoons of salt after cooking. Apparantly my slow cooker cooks very hot on the high setting so after the first 3 hours I did need to add an additional 1 cup of water so I turned the cooker down to low and cooked for another 7 hours which was perfect. Instead of straining the beans, I spooned off the extra juice on top with a large spoon which was easily done, then mashed them and kept them warming in the slow cooker.  Topped the beans with shredded jack or pepperjack cheese which was awesome! We had invited a few friends over for dinner, the beans were the perfect side dish and burrito filling with the Carne Asada, Spanish rice and tortillas which we served! I will never use canned refried beans again! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I used half the salt, a small can of green chilies instead of jalapenos(didn't have jalapenos), and no cumin(afraid it would give it more of a 'western chili' flavor).  Best I've ever had and my son says os too.

Amazing! I used all of the salt that it called for, and it was too salty- next time I'll cut the salt in half.  THe recipe still gets 5 stars!!  I didn't have a jalapeno but I used crushed pepper flakes.  I also cooked it all night on low and continued for part of the day today.  I strained off much of the liquid and I mashed them with my hand mixer (left them a little chunky).  I used black beans, and I can't wait to try other kinds of beans.  My husband is standing at the crock pot dipping tortilla chips into it!

Great recipe!  I cut it down to 5 servings in order to use 1 cup of beans, as it was all I had.  I also used black beans.  I cooked these on low overnight and all of today until dinner.  Pureed with my immersion blender, but left a little chunky.  Didn't use all the salt called for, and for one of the cups of water, I used chicken stock.  These went very well with our Mexican meal tonight! **** Made again using pinto beans and I liked it even better.

Amazing! These beans reminded me of the beans served at a restaurant I dearly miss back in my hometown. 

I substituted 2 of the cups of water for a can of chicken broth. After the 8 hours of cooking, there wasn't much need to mash them so I did not. There was  a satisfying mixture of naturally 'mashed' beans and whole beans. 

I froze the leftovers in small sized storage containers and pulled them out for easy lunches during the week.

I make this recipe at least once a month now, usually more. I cut the salt in half and that's  plenty salty for me. Lately I've only been mashing half of the beans in a separate container because I like them whole with a grilled Anaheim pepper and a side of scrambled eggs, my new favorite breakfast.

Very good!  I love bean and cheese burritos.  The rest of the family wants meat-of-any-kind burritos.  Making these beans and freezing in batches for me works great!  The flavor is spot on.  I just use water as written so I can serve these along side Mexican food entrees when friends come over - I have vegetarian friends so can't use chicken or beef broth.  Great recipe as written, however my own preference is to use a whole jalapeno and a bit more cumin.   :)

When the beans cook, they smell great and about drive me nuts. Having them right out of the pot is wonderful. I put these low fat 'refried' beans and lower fat Mexican cheese into burritos, freeze them and have for a late (or two lazy to cook) dinner. Add some salsa and awesome!

You can also use canned beans for this.  Not quite so good, but fine if you need them in a hurry.

I was eating at a restaurant down south once and they served up a small bowl of refried black beans along side my breakfast. It was delicious. So I was searching for a recipe to try. I saw this one made with pintos and decided to try it using all black beans instead. It. Is. Delicious. I cut back the salt to 3 tsp and I used an Epicure chili garlic sea salt. I added the optional cumin as well. The jalapeños give this dish just a little bit of kick and all of the ingredients together taste wonderful. The best thing about this is its a great way to get healthy slow carbs into your diet. Love it.

What a great recipe!  I followed the advise of several other reviewers and (a) reduced the salt to 1 tsp and (b) included 6 strips of bacon.  I was able to reduce the prep time to 1 hr. 15 mins. by cooking the dry beans in a 12psi pressure cooker for 1 hour.  While the beans were cooking I fried the bacon then cooked the onions, jalapeno, and garlic in the bacon fat.  I blended all the pan ingredients and added them to the cooked/drained beans for mashing.  Definitely not as healthy with the bacon but, my gosh, they were awesome!

These beans are wonderful. For those who are worried about the jalapeno making them spicy, it doesn't. If you remove the seeds, none of the heat from the jalapeno comes through, just great flavor. I make these all the time for my family (including small children) using 3 seeded jalapenos and they are not spicy at all.

AMAZING!  A huge hit with the family!  I did add a little milk to make them creamier (thanks to a previous review).  Will be making these again and again!

This recipe is so easy yet so very tasty.  I make this recipe as whole beans not mashed and I like to use black beans.  I like the others use broth instead of plain water and use only about 1-2 tsp of salt.  I'm constantly asked for this recipe. Definitely one of my go to recipes!!!!

This recipe definitely has potential. I did read a lot of the positive and negative reviews to get a feel for the results. Based on others feedback, I did cut back the salt to 3 tsp, which was plenty for me.  The onion is key, and does blend right into the beans.  Definitely drain off the liquid thoroughly - I scooped out the bulk of the liquid but left some in and used my immersion blender to blend - it was runnier than I was looking for, but again, my fault for not getting out all the liquid.  Still a good taste.  I thought the jalapeno got lost, so I may put that in after they are cooked or near the end next time I make these.  I'm also not a huge fan of cumin, so for me the recommended amount was good.  It only took about 4 hours in my crock pot on high. For my first time using dried beans to make anything, I'd call this a success!  Thanks!

I think the glowing reviews got my expectations out of line.  It was ok - just, you know, beans!  Glad to know I can make it from scratch.  Just one word of advice - they dry out quick, so be sure to save plenty of the broth!

I have made these beans multiple times, my family loves them. After serving them to my parents my mom now makes them also. Half the time we don't even mash them up but leave them whole and eat with corn bread. I'm only doing 4 stars because I've never had them with the jalapeno since my husband doesn't handle spice to well.

These are incredible.  Like so many others, I will never buy canned refried beans again.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't add the salt until I was mashing and I only used about 2.5 tsp.  That was plenty.  So simple and yet so wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe for non re fried beans. My son and I have this at least every other week. Just pop the leftovers either in the freezer or fridge, and cook em up em later.. The only tweak is mixing a cup of black beans with two cups pinto beans, and of course not to add the salt. There is plenty of flavor with the ingredients already. You can always season to taste after their cooked. 5 teaspoons of salt is waaay to much for anyone watching their sodium intake. this is definetly my go to side dish after a long day at work. Thanks Chef Claude!!

I halved the salt to 2.5 teaspoons but it was still VERY salty. Otherwise, a good recipe. I shall make it again but with only one teaspoon of salt and probably add extra cumin.

These beans are amazing! I made them for the first time today, and my 4 and 6 year olds inhaled them! We couldn't get enough. Seriously. We almost ate all of it before my husband came home. I left out the jalapeño because of an allergy, but otherwise made the recipe as written. Forget canned beans with all the preservatives and sugar. This is a great recipe!

This was awesome.  Will definitely be making this regularly.  Great with some jalapeno jack cheese and sour cream.  I had a roasted chicken carcass available so I boiled that in about 10 cups of water for a couple of hours and then had the 8 cups of broth left to use for this instead of water.  I drained off about 6 cups of liquid and then used an immersion blender.  It was not as thick as I think most people would like, so probably better to follow instructions and add the liquid back in as you blend/mash them.  But leftovers did get thicker.  I then used the liquid I pulled off to make Spicy Black Bean Slow Cooker Soup (from this site).

We make these beans all the time. Everybody has different tastes. So for my family, I had to make a few adjustments.  We like our beans less salty and with less pepper. Use 1/2 the salt, only add 1/4 tsp. of pepper, 1 T. garlic, no cumin, or jalapeno. Kids will eat the beans.

5 tsp salt is definitely too much. I cut it to 2 tsp and that wasn't quite enough. I'll try 2-1/2 next time--and there WILL be a next time. You can't beat the texture, and the hint of jalapeno and onion were perfect. For those who like any amount of heat, at least double the jalapeno. We prefer things mild, and the flavor was there without any real spice.

Love this recipe. I use 1-1/2 Tbps minced garlic from a jar, 4 fps salt, 1 Tbps bacon grease, 1 diced jalapeno, 2 diced green chilies, only 8 cups of water. Then I removed 2 cups of water and it is the perfect thickness.

Love these beans!!!! I'd give the original recipe 4.5 stars if I could. Great flavor for not being refried. The only suggestion I'd make is go easy on the salt and black pepper! The first time I followed the recipe as is...way too much salt and pepper!! Now I use chicken broth instead of water and salt/pepper to taste. These freeze great, too! I've even boiled them on the stove for at least 5 hours without soaking them first and they still turned out great!

SALTY!  I almost threw out the first batch because we couldn't eat it, but I'm cheap and decided to make a second batch without salt and mix the two.  I haven't tried it yet but my DH said it was great and to keep the recipe. Next time, I'll cut the salt down to 2 teaspoons. Tonight: beans and rice!

Insanely good. I put the slow cooker on the 8 hour setting, which translates to low. The beans were no where near cooked. I just popped them in the pressure cooker for about ten more minutes. The seasonings were spot on (I went with the reduced salt recommendations). No more canned beans again! Next time I may just try all pressure cooker, just to seen

Good and easy.  I used a whole jalapeno but removed the seeds and ribs.  It gave the beans a nice mild zip.  Reduced the salt to 2 tsp since we watch our sodium and it was fine.

This was certainly easy.  Following the reviews of others I cut back on the salt (figuring I could always add more later) and added a little more cumin.  I over blended using my immersion blender so in the future I'd prefer more whole beans.  Next time I'll set some beans aside and blend the rest in the crock then combine.

I have been making this recipe now for approx 6 years! It is so good I haven't bought refried beans since. I make the full batch and freeze them in containers big enough for may family. I use an immersion blender for half then add the rest before freezing. excellent recipe. thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly. They smelled amazing throughout the entire day and the turned out delicious! Thank you for sharing. It is definitely a recipe you can adjust based off your own taste preferences (if you want more jalapeno or you want to add some different flavors via seasonings, etc.). I can't say I won't ever buy a can of refried beans again, but when I plan enough in advance, I will use this recipe!

Next time I will add less salt. I should have read the reviews. Other than that they were so good. I like the idea of adding different ingredients to change up the flavor from time to time. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)

Amazing!!!! Will never buy can beans again. My daughter loves them and she doesn't like beans. Did as others suggested 3 tsp of salt and 4 cups chicken broth and 5 cups water. Thank you for a great recipe!!!!!

These are awesome!!! Really needed a new way to make beans! Thanks for posting! I used the chicken cubes also and just omitted the salt. Highly recommend the cumin. It makes it!

I tried this one tonight, and everyone loved it! I followed one of the other reviews and used a can of green chilies instead of a jalapeno. Instead of mashing, I threw it all in the blender after I drained, with a little of the juice added in, and--bam!--we were in business. Will definitely be making this again!

I am giving this recipe for starts because it gave me a great base for refries in a slow cooker. I wanted to follow the recipe to a "T", but couldn't do it.  After making these for years with an old family recipe I couldn't totally ignore the bacon grease. At the end - needing some flavor I added about 2 tablespoons and stirred in. Plus the tip I got for using the hand immersion blender was worth the whole four stars. Don't know why I never thought of that before.  Here are my adjustments for anyone interested.  Definitely use at least 2 cups of chicken broth instead of all water and wait until the end to salt and just salt to taste. I also used a whole jalepeno, 1 1/4 tsp. ground cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder,and no black pepper.  Again, just my taste.  Anyhow my husband and I have been sitting here eating them after taste testing.  Oh, I did NOT take out all of the liquid I just scooped out as much as I thought I wanted to and blended away.  Enjoy.

I couldn't find refried beans on the island - thank goodness for allrecipes! And thank goodness for this recipe! These are killer! I was tired of chopping so I threw in a small can of green diced chilis - I think it's actually a bit too much kick. I'll stick with the jalapenos next time. I diced the onion, not noticing the directions. Four cloves of garlic. A hand blender is a great way to mash! These are so much better than canned beans!

Great, easy recipe.  Plus we're sure it's gluten free, which we can't always be sure of with the canned stuff.  I make this at least once a week with a doubled recipe.

I cut the salt to 2tsp maybe 3. The salt seems to come out more once it cools. I added about 1 tbs of cumin. Couldn't be easier made it twice now and it freezes well.

This recipe tastes just like how my mom used to make them! I read some of the other reviews and made these changes: 3 tsp of salt and added a extra tbs of garlic. These came out sooo good, 10x better than canned beans, yuck. I will be making these again :)

Delicious and easy! This is also a great recipe if you just want pinto beans -- they tasted great before mashing to make them into "refried" beans. I was a little worried about cooking them without pre-soaking, because I have always thought you had to soak dried beans, but these turned out perfectly by following the recipe exactly as written. Traditional refried beans contain lard. This recipe will give you a delicious alternative without the animal fat -- no one will ever know it is missing!

I absoluely love these beans!  Sometimes we make them and don't do the "mashing" to serve with cornbread.  The flavor and method work wonderfully.  We have also made black beans using this same recipe and they turn out great as well.

I love this recipe. Although I soak and rinse the beans for 2-3 days. To let them out gas. No gas for me. Rinse and drain beans before adding beef stock instead of water Yumm!

So simple and good. I add 1/2 tsp chili powder and   2-3 cups of chicken broth. I usually use both pinto and black beans. Freeze some for future use; also freeze a small container of the broth if needed after they are reheated.

These turned out great. Since I'm the only member of the family that can eat beans, I froze in smaller portions in freezer bags for whenever we have a "taco night". They froze really well.Now that I have a smaller crockpot, I'll do this again but halve the recipe.

These beans are not only super easy, they are so delicious! I will not buy the canned beans ever again. I used these for three or four months and ran out so I opened a can of beans I had and they were so gross compared to the goodness of these! Not lying everyone who tries them wants and uses the recipe! They are so yummy!!! I often use black beans mixed with pinto. Sometimes I add kidney beans or red beans as well. The black beans are a bit more salty so I use a tsp less of the salt. I also add chili powder and more cumin though I cook with love (in other words I don't measure.)

I have used this recipe four times now, each time modifying it to try and get it exactly where I want it. This is how mine is different:

I only use the following ingredients:

* Two teaspoons of freeze dried Jalapeno (probably the equiv of two - three fresh ones)

* 4 Tablespoons of minced garlic

* 1 bunch of Cilantro (just pull off all the leaves and put in pot)

* 1 large Walla Walla sweat onion

* 1 teaspoon black pepper

* 3 Cups of dried pinto beans

* 1/8th teaspoon cumin

* 1/4 teaspoon chili powder

* 2 tablespoons salt (I think I will use 1 tablespoon next time)

Dump it all in, cook for 8 hours. When you drain, use a strainer because the liquid base is excellent for a noodle soup or to cook rice in. Once you strain it, get the larger pieces of onion, large leafy left overs out, mash and enjoy.

OMG, these are fabulous! Wish I'd read the reviews about adding less salt though. They are just a tad too salty for my taste, so I'll reduce to 3 1/2 teaspoons as one reviewer suggested. But the flavor!! Heavenly!

This is the best refried beans recipes I have ever come across.  My husband grew up having mediocre beans, and I told him, no, you need to try this.  He did, came back for seconds and now BEGS me to make this every other week.  He's the one who lets me know when we're getting low on the beans in the freezer.  LOVE IT!!!

So easy and delicious! I would add more jalapeno next time, but will make this over and over again. Hubby loved it.

I have been making this recipe every other week for over a year now and it hasn't gotten old yet! Can use these beans in a million different ways (mashed in burritos, tacos, 7 layer dip - or whole in any recipe that calls for beans).

I thought these beans were great.  I've never made homemade refried beans before.  I made it how the recipe calls but used a whole bag of beans instead. Used  2 onions and 1 whole jalapeno pepper.  I added a slight amount extra of the spices to account for the extra beans.  Used my hand held mixer to blend it up and they were great.  Never gonna go back to canned beans again.  Who would of thunk it that a simple kansas girl could make some down right mean refried beans!

SUPER BEANS!  I usually hate making beans into anything, but this is so simple and really a great and healthy result.  I still can't believe there is no oil or fat, because they end up with such great taste.  I was reading the other reviews for adding tons of cheese, but they are PERFECT on their own.  Thanks for sharing!

Was concerned they would not be tender enough but at exactly 8 hours they were perfectly cooked. I made for kids and grandchildren (vegan) for burritos and we devoured them all in no time! We will be making these often. Highly recommend this recipe.

Five stars even for an excellent go-to recipe, even though I reduce the salt to about 1 tsp, and the pepper to 1/2 tsp. (the original amount was too strong for us) then I may add extra to taste. Also the addition of at least a half-tsp. chili powder and, sometimes, a bit of bacon grease for a more authentic flavor.

Tried this recipe this last weekend and all I can say is WOW!  It is great.  I used unsalted Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock (5 cups) along with 4 cups of water.  I used a large seeded jalapeno chopped half of it and left one half whole to be taken out with the large pieces of onion at the end.  I used one tablespoon (= 3 teaspoons) of Kosher salt and that was fine.  I think the type of salt used (Kosher versus table salt) will make a huge difference in the saltiness factor and five teaspoons may be just fine; three was a bit light but nobody felt the need to add more either.  

I also added about 3 tablespoons of ketchup to add a bit of tomato to the flavor.  Next time I will use one jar/tub of salsa in place of 1 or 2 cups of water to add flavor and get that bit of tomato flavor I wanted.  I also think that I will chop the onion next time to be able to leave it in.  The large onion pieces quite possibly would work fine with vigorous smashing at the end but chopped onion wouldn't require that.

I soaked the beans overnight and then cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Although a bit bland as written ( like most traditional refried beans), fantastic base recipe and very economical.  Make sure to drain thoroughly before mashing.  I used an immersion blender and left a bit too much liquid in the beans so they are a bit runny but the perfect consistency for hot bean dip.  Make sure to save your cooking liquid if you're making soup or chili in the near future because it is very tasty.  I have made this many times since my initial review.  This time I used 4 cups of dried beans (what was in my bag) and uped the spices accordingly.  For once I actually drained the cooking liquid from the beans and whipped in a food processor (in batches).  This really left me with a stiff bean mixture, just what I was looking for since I plan on freezing a good portion for later uses.  Thanks for the easy and fantastic recipe.

This is a super easy yummy recipe for home cooked beans.  My 2 year old daughter loves beans and rice so I made this for her.  The first time I made it with the jalapeno, with chicken base, and it was WAY too salty and spicy for kids.  Scratch the chicken base and only add 3 tsp salt for pinto.  The second time I made it without the jalapeno and only added 3 tsp salt, no chicken base and also made it with black beans.  I had to add about 2 more cups of water for black beans and it turned out perfect!  Delicious recipe!

This recipe is great.  My bag of pinto beans only had 2 1/2 cups.  I used the same measurements of the other ingredients execpt only half the salt.  I cooked it on high for 9 hours.  After mashing the beans, I stirred them to get the thick beans stirred throughout.  I let it sit for about 20 minutes.  It came out the same consistency and taste as our favorite Mexican restaurant!  It made about 4 pints.  Plenty to last the 2 of us for a while.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent basic recipe...add more spice until it's exactly the way you love it. I soaked my beans overnight and then discarded the water before proceeding with the recipe. It's always a good idea to do that when cooking with dried beans.

This is a terrific recipe with one caveat: too much salt. I'm Southern and not at all afraid of salty foods, but the amount in this recipe was overwhelming. I will definitely make this again, but will half the amount of salt.

These are WAY TOO SALTY.  Other than that they are fantastic.  I am cutting the salt down to 2 tsp, and I confess to adding a bit of milk.  They are amazingly good, but the original recipe has far, far too much salt.

Great Beans! Used less salt. Next time could use part broth to cook in. Could use more seasonings. Never add tomatoes til beans are cooked, acid prevents softning.

This recipe is a million times better than I expected!  I`ll never have beans any other way. 3 tsp of salt rather than 5, other than that I just followed exact directions and total refried beans perfection without the refried!  A million thanks to the creator of this marvelous recipe!!

I made this with Organic Cranberry Beans and it came out wonderful. Used part of it to make a 7 Layer Taco Dip (this site) for Superbowl weekend, all of it was a big hit with the hubby. Will make again soon and often.

I followed this recipe exactly with two small exceptions.  After reading the reviews, I chose to use 4 c of chicken broth in place of some of the water and to cut the salt back to 3 tsp.  But, something was very off with the flavor.  There was some sort of chemical taste to the beans.  The texture was perfect, but we believe that the garlic was to blame for the weird taste. I can usually pinpoint how a recipe can be improved, but I just cannot on this one.  Not sure we'll finish the batch.  We'll see how it does after resting a day or two.

I made modifications to this recipe and found it to be bland, but that b/c I left out the salt (big mistake, I don't add salt to anything, but this NEEDED at least 2 tsps at the end) and my jalapeno was not spicy at all!  After everything was cooked, I added some cayenne pepper and more cumin, as well as 2 tsp. of salt (remember, I didn't add any to begin), and now I think these beans are pretty great :)

Very good. As other reviewers suggested,  I used chicken broth for half the liquid.  I also only added 2 tsp salt (vs. 5).  I also left out the jalapeno and added 1/2 tsp. cumin (vs. 1/8).  At the end,  I added some shredded cheddar and mixed it in.  It was delicious.  I was wondering what would happen with the onion...  it just chops up with the beans when you mash them.  You can't even tell it is there.

Delicious!  I have done this in the slow cooker a few times, but I have also done it on the stove top - combine beans and spices, cover with water (or chicken broth) and boil till tender, adding liquid as necessary.  I did black beans on the stove top for burritos (skipped mashing them), and they were delicious!

I have been using allrecipes for years now with a pretty good success rate.  But it is this recipe that has made me sign up as a member so I can leave a review.

Thank you, thank you thank you.  This recipe is a standby in our house now.  The only thing I have changed is to omit the jalapeno.  Actually I am getting ready to make the "Refried Beans Without the Refry" right after I complete this review.  Thanks again!

These were good. Omitted all the salt the recipe called for because of diet restrictions. Would have been better with the salt, but was great in our burritos. Super, super easy thought. Will definitely make again, and again.*Have made these so many times now, I'm not even sure how many. These are our go-to "refried" beans! Love how easy they are with only a few ingredients and not a ton of chopping and prep either! I usually add a whole jalapeno and extra cumin because we like our foods a little spicier. Also, sometimes I'll add a little cajun season in place of some of the salt. I have even learned to save the extra juice and use it in my rice cooker when I make rice to go with the main dish of rice and beans.

This recipe is great! I wanted to start making my own since I am trying to get away from using canned goods and my husband loves refried beans. I started looking for an easy lowfat recipe and this is it!! I followed the directions exactly but the only thing I didn't have on hand was the jalapeno so I left it out. It still turned out great and I will never by refried beans again. We froze some of it so that we would have it ready to use whenever we need it. Thank you for the recipe.

I made the beans in a big pot and cooked them on the stove, it took about 5-6 hrs.  After I mashed them, I put some shredded monterey jack cheese on top of them and melted it.  They were a hit at the Taco Tuesday dinner party!

I gave this five stars even though I agree with others that it has too much salt.  The reason I still gave this five stars is that even over salted it is clear this recipe is a keeper. I should also mention I am a salt lover, so if I say something is too salty it's probably way too salty for most people.  Next time I will try 3 tsp of salt and see how that goes.  Also I did not have a fresh jalapeno, so I put about 6 jarred "rings" in.  I removed the onion before mashing; but, I left the jalapenos in.  If your family likes salty food this might be ok. I'm sure my son will not eat this batch though, so next time I may only put 3 rings in and remove them before mashing.  I did not need to add any reserve liquid for mashing.

LOVE this recipe. This dish tastes a lot like the beans from El Cholo in Los Angeles. The only change I make is to use a pressure cooker, I am just too ADHD for slow cooking. I soften the beans by pressure cooking for five minutes, then rinse them and follow step 1, but with about half the water. It takes about 30 minutes for the bean mixture to cook in a pressure cooker. Be careful not to burn the beans, keep the heat just high enough to keep a good pressure. I also take them off and rinse the cooker with cold water occasionally to reduce the pressure and stir. When the beans are done, take off the cooker. You can boil off any extra water if it's too runny.

I discovered this recipe about 2 months ago. Since then, I've made at least one batch of these beans per week. They are so delicious and easy to prepare! I've tinkered with the recipe slightly and made the following adjustments: I use 5 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. Also, I use one whole jalapeno (we like spice), cut back on the salt to 3tsp, and reduce the black pepper to approx 1 tsp. Voila! Absolutely amazing, and better than anything store-bought. Give these beans a try - you won't be disappointed!

Pretty good, easy, subbed 2 c of water for chicken broth & reduced salt. Might try putting in some chicharrones next time for that extra flavor burst.

These are the best crock pot beans I have ever made.  I love how simple it is.  You don't even have to cut the vegetables.  Just throw them in.  They literally just disintegrate into the beans.  Yummy.  This recipe has been a staple in my household for over two years now.  It is made at least once a month and when it was shared with company...they approved wholeheartedly.  

I would recommend using only 1 tablespoon of salt.  It was too salty for us.  And it works out just fine adding chili powder (to taste) if you don't have jalapenos.  For a bit of an added flavor kick--especially if you are going to use these for dip, add more cumin.  I usually use 1/2-1 tablespoon.

Loved it!  I used 6 (15 oz) cans pinto beans, 6 cups low sodium chicken broth, 1 tsp salt (based on recommendations), 1 tsp cumin, and two small cans dices green chiles in place of the jalapenos.  Cooked on high until the liquid was thick and pinto bean colored (about 8 hours).  Took out the onions, strained out some of the liquid and reserved it to add if needed, then mashed with a hand mixer.  Family loved it -- no more salt needed.  Served hot topped with Mexican white cheese.  Yummy!

The recipe by itself is good but my family thought it was a little bland so we added some extra spices and that made it fantastic! Love that it is such a healthy version of this common mexican side dish.

I save a lot of time and make this using my pressure cooker.  I omit the salt and add 6t of Caldo con sabor de pollo (chicken bouillon, which has tons of salt in it.  Takes about 45-60 minutes after it comes to pressure.  Freezing leftovers makes it really fast and ready for the next meal!

These were just what I was looking for! I have a little 2qt crock pot so I changed the serving size to 5 and went with the updated measurements. The only thing I added different was chicken broth in place of half of the water, a little cayenne pepper and a squirt of lime juice. I just put the cooker on high and let them go for about 9 hours. I omitted salt completely until after I blended the beans, and then only added a pinch or two. I like my beans smooth so I put all of the beans along with some of the reserved liquid into my Bullet Blender and blended away until they were perfect. These were great on the Chalupas I made tonight! I love that it's so easy and healthy!

These were reall good.  For the amount you get and the cost to make it, I will never buy canned again.  The only problem was that mine had a weird after taste.

LOVE IT!!  This was my first experience using dried beans.  I found it to be a little salty for me (and I'm kind of a salt junkie), but that can easily be remedied.  I threw about half of the batch into my blender for convenience.  It is PERFECT.  Froze all of it in single-serving portions.  Reheats like a dream!

I would love to give this recipe five stars, but I did have to modify it a little.  After reading all the other reviews, I cut the salt down to 2 teaspoons (this is plenty for me!) and after some experimenting, I also cut the water down to 8 cups.  I like using all the water because there is so much flavor there I don't want to waste, and I found using 8 cups gives me the consistency that I like. I never use the jalapeno pepper (never have any on hand) and I cut the black pepper down some as well (my kids don't like it).  
Otherwise, this recipe was a fantastic find and I never buy canned refried beans anymore, these are delicious.  I make a batch, divide it, and freeze it so I always have some on hand.  Thanks for the great submission.

WOW! I followed the directions pretty closely this time. SHOCKING! especially for me who looks at recipes as guidelines. These beans were WONDERFUL!!! I cut the salt back to 3 tsp. you can start with 3 and then see if you'd like it saltier. I also didn't cut up the jalapeno. I left it whole and then took the whole thing out before mashing the beans. This recipe is worth repeating and one that I will enjoy making for years to come! How's that for a review :) I can't imagine ever buying refried beans after trying this recipe!

Outstanding!  I make this all the time and use it for multiple meals.  Sometimes I mash the beans but often I don't and they can be used as a side dish one night and then put into quesadillas or enchiladas the next.  Great with chips, too!  I modify the recipe just a bit -- less water (about 7 cups) and more jalapeno. Oh, and I use black beans because they are so pretty.  Enjoy!

This is most definitely the BEST way to make refried beans! I added more garlic and seasonings and a whole jalapeno. I put it all in the slow cooker and went to bed... although I will say it wasn't the most pleasant smell to wake up to!

Officially changing my refried beans to these now...I love how low in fat they are and so tasty.  I also used 3TBSP of salt.  totally delish.

* I made these in the crock pot, cooked on low all day and turned out great.

These were pretty good, a little on the bland side, but definitely have potential with some tweeking.  I will most likely add bacon and bacon drippings next time and use shallots instead of onions per the recommendation of a friend.

Made the recipe mostly as written (except sauteed the onion in half a stick of butter before adding, and used roasted garlic) but there is way too much salt.  It still tasted delicious despite this, just salty delicious.  Halve the salt from the recipe as written.  The cumin was a nice touch, recommended.

Very tasty (minus the jalapnos for us). I loved the cumin and added a bit of chili powder. Just before serving I stirred in some Cheddar/Monterey Jack blend shredded cheese. To celebrate Cinco De Mayo, we had these with the Green Chicken Enchiladas here on this site. I love Mexican food!

YUM!  I kept the onion in the beans after they were done cooking, and ran the entire thing through my food processor along with some N/F sour cream and a bit of the homemade taco seasoning from this website.  My son made some baked tortilla chips (also a recipe from this site) and we've been dipping away!  FANTASTIC!

I have little ones so I use mild chilies instead of jalepenos. a little less salt and more cumin, but it is a very good and healthy recipe for refried beans, also works well with black beans too!

I have shared this recipe many times since finding it a couple weeks ago.  My family and friends have been amazed that I am making my own refried beans in a slow cooker (without soaking!), well we are ALL amazed with how great it turns out!  We have all sworn to make them ourselves from now on.
Today I am making it with a teaspoon less salt, to soften it a bit.  We will see. : )
I haven't had Jalapenos from the garden yet so that has been missing from mine.  This summer I am very excited to have a good use for them.

These were heavy on the salt, so I will cut back next time. Overall, the flavor was very good. It makes a lot so I'll put some in the freezer for another meal. Smelled great while cooking!

This recipe is easy and inexpensive. I followed it exactly and had to add extra spice at the end, but we like our beans spicy. Will definately make these again. Goodbye store-bought beans!!!

I grew up and live in the Chile capital of the world called Hatch New Mexico.  I have eaten "refried" beans for decades.  This by far is the best I have ever eaten.  Don't be afraid of the jalapeno it does not make this hot after cooking.  Try this recipe, it is perfect as a bean dish, or mashed for refried as directed!

Excellent and easy.  Much better than canned refried beans.  The only thing is it makes soooooo much, the  only thing I will do differently next time is half the recipe.

we have made this twice in the last 2 weeks so I thought I would review.  EASY, DELICIOUS, works every time recipe!  THANK you for a recipe for my vegetarian daughter who is just 14 and can put this together for herself.  I have one extra tip (for those who are not vegetarian.) Hispanic friends always add a tbsp of lard in their beans for extra level of flavor.  I added a tbsp of bacon grease (I know-yuck...) but the taste was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  We are never buying canned beans again!

I have made this recipe over and over again.  I make this often when I attend potluck luncheons and everyone who has eaten it loves it!  Normally I don't even mash the beans but use them whole over rice or tortilla chips or in tortillas with shredded cheese for homemade bean burritos.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe Chefclaude!  I let the extra beans cool down and I freeze them in quart-sized ziplock bags for a quick and easy meal or side-dish later on.  This is great for once a month cooking or freezer meals.

well, let me start by saying WOW!  These were fabulous.  This is the first time I have ever made pinto beans without having some form of meat in it.  Typically, I make them with bacon or salt pork.  These were by far the best pinto beans EVER!  They smelled wonderful cooking in the slow cooker and after about 4 hours I couldn't resist trying them.  They tasted awesome!  My 12 year old daughter came home from school and immediately wanted to know what was cooking and if she could taste! She loved them!  My 2 year old son ate two heaping serving spoons full of beans for dinner.  I took about half of them and made them refried nd served with tacos, and the remainder I left in "soup" form for my husband and son for lunch.  It was really great that these didn't even need to be soaked overnight.  Just threw them in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients and ..viola....yummy, delicious goodness!  These were perfect made exactly as the recipe states!  Can't wait to make again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Took a couple times for me to get the amount of water you leave in the beans right so the consistency is right after you smash them... but once I did that they were excellent!  I follow the recipe exactly (which is unusual), I have added a whole jalapeno which makes it a little spicier but still not crazy spicy.  My suggestion for the amount of liquid you leave in the beans... push the cooked beans flat then ladle off excess liquid until the beans are just covered.  Also, it makes quite a bit, so we make bean dip and a couple days later chimis or enchiladas etc.  Excellent!

I rarely will comment but these beans are really worth trying.  I actually made these in my pressure cooker-so easy.  Used 1 1/2 C. pinto 1 1/2 C. black beans-have made it several times and it's a favorite.

This was a hit with my picky eaters! Very flexible to add what you want in the cooking process. I cooked it over night but you might want to put the crockpot on low, my liquid was almost gone and the beans scorched a little. Again, I cook mine while we were sleeping so the time was a little longer.

I really liked these but wont give them 5 stars due to the amount of salt in the recipe, I used just one teaspoon and though it was enough.

Crazy good! I added 1 tbls butter and about 3 tbls bacon grease and mashed. Didn't have a jalapeno so I didn't use one. We loved these! I froze the leftover beans and they were wonderful. I won't ever buy another can of beans again. These are easy and tasty. I can't get a better refried bean anywhere!

Excellent flavor - but please do not soak beans prior to making or they will be too runny. Also, you can substitute half of the water with Chicken broth for more flavor.

Could NOT be any simpler! Very flavorful. I'll be using this method forever now. I'll also buy pinto's in bulk to always have on-hand.  I did not have any fresh jalepeno on hand so used small dried chili's; 3 - 4.  Before smashing the beans I removed them.  We were feeding a toddler too. It was NOT spicy. Just very flavorful.  I also added some cubes jack cheese while smashing.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Much tastier than the canned stuff.  Was concerned at first that the water wouldn't absorb but at the 6 hour mark, things really started to thicken.  Best part was as it cooled, there was none of the congealed gunk that is normal in canned beans. Will make again, maybe toss in a can of green chili.

I changed the recipe around to how I normally make beans and the end result is pretty tasty! I put the onion, beans, garlic, pepper, and cumin in the crock pot and cooked them on high for about 8 hours then strained the beans (reserving the cooking liquid) and refrigerated them overnight. I'm a sucker for refried beans, so I did end up refrying them the next day. I heated a cast iron pan with about 1tbsp of oil and got it to a high heat and added the beans and some of the juice and mashed them with a potato masher. I added half a can of diced jalapenos and added sea salt during the mashing.  I love the undertones of the cumin and onion. Thank you for sharing!

These were delicious and very easy. I did use 4 cups chicken broth and 5 water to add more flavor. I also used only 2 teaspoons of salt. I misread the directions and used a whole jalapeno instead of half and after smelling it cooking all day I was scared it would be too spicy for my kids but it wasnt at all. Makes a lot more than it sounds.

This recipe is awesome!  The beans taste just as good as the commercial stuff in the stores and it's less salty and greasy.  Prep is simple and this recipe is easily adjustable to suit tastes or experimentation.  Also I love how this not only makes refried beans more healthful, it's very economical too since you can buy a big bag of dry beans- I used red kidney beans because that's what I happened to have- for about the same price as the reduced fat canned food.  :-D

I leave adding salt (& less than the recipe calls for) until the beans have cooked so the beans will not be tough.  Salt inhibits the cooking process like something acidic, e.g. tomatoes, does.  Otherwise, a great recipe.

Made this for Cinco de Mayo 7 years ago and have used this easy tasty recipe ever since.  Everyone raves!  I will always use this as my go to bean recipe!  I have also made  it with black beans and was a hit too! I have made it with half black beans and half pinto and my family likes it but I don't know if I would serve that to company coming over for a meal. This recipe is so easy to make that it makes sense when you have other dishes to make and serve with it, like enchiladas etc. Any leftovers freeze well too. And if you don't like salt (we don't) then don't use much or any - common sense here.
Make this ten or more times a year and it is requested by my family. Doesn't get better than that! Try it - bet you'll like it too!

Oh.  My.  Gosh.  These beans are amazing.  I scaled the recipe to serve 25 and that yields a 2 lb package of pinto beans exactly.  I let them cook overnight in the crock pot on high at first then turned to low before going to bed.  I mashed them with my mixer.  So economical - I think I'll call them Dave Ramsey Beans!

Wow, these are amazing.  I don't even like refried beans normally, but I had a bag of pinto beans that I needed to use.  I thought it wasn't going to be flavorful enough with just water and a tiny but of cumin, but the end result was phenomenal!  Use as a dip with chips or mash with some milk. Any way you make it, these are great!

Oh yum!  And no worries of BPA in my food from the canned version.  Made the following alterations: used 1/2 black beans as others stated, and only used 8 cups of water by accident, but that was plenty.  Also used a whole jalapeno.  Next time I will add more seasonings.  These are incredible and I can't wait to try with other beans!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  Have made it exactly as written and good but have done a few things lately that have made if fantastic!  I do a mix of black beans and pintos, at the end right before serving add a good amout of fresh squeezed lime juice and fresh cilantro.  Heavenly!

Awesome!  I cooked mine for 10 hours on low in the slow cooker and they were peftect!  Used a hand mixer to blend them as others had suggested - splattered everywhere, but still easier than mashing, I think!

Excellent!! I used half low sodium chicken broth with half water and added salt to taste when done. We like them a little more spicy, but some added hot sauce worked just fine. I ended up with a lot of broth so I drained the beans before mashing and didn't need to put any liquid back in. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I have made these several time and they are wonderful.  I freeze them in individual meal sizes and defrost them when needed.  I always omit the salt (because of dietary restrictions) and garlic(taste).  I increase the cumin and add chili powder.  I have slow cooker simmering right now.

These were Goooood!  I left them in the crockpot for a little over 6 hours...any longer and I was afraid the beans would disintegrate into the water.  I used several slices of pickled jalepeno, 1 very large garlic clove, 3/4 of an onion, 1 T each Garlic Salt and Onion Salt.  I didn't have any cumin but I really wanted a lot of spice in these so I added a little taco seasoning mix.  I strained them, and used my hand mixer to "mash" them.  Turned out beautifully and I only needed to add 1/4 C. of the liquid.  Delicious, I'm glad I made them!

I made this recipe exactly as written and my beans came out pretty well. After eating these, I will not be buying refried beans in a can anymore. I used my handheld immersion blender rather then smashing them, and they came out so wonderfully light and fluffy! My fiancé said they reminded him of mashed potatoes. I added enough liquid to get to the consistency that I wanted. When I finished blending, I started scooping into small ball jars and topping with some excess liquid to put in the fridge, I got 8 of them filled out of it and still had enough beans left in the cooker for the two of us. I decided to add the rest of the liquid I had reserved to the remainder of the beans, and I really wish I hadn't because I guess that is where most of the salt was concentrated. The beans we ended up eating were not inedible, but you could tell the salt was just a bit too much for the amount of beans that I had left in the pot. The ratio wasn't right. Next time I make these I will make it a point to add more of the liquid in canning to get a better balance. I'm freezing my leftovers which should last me a while! Other reviewers said they hadn't put in the jalapeno or adjusted the amount of salt. I say don't. I actually didn't even taste the jalapeno and next time will probably do a full pepper. Also, like I said the salt is mostly concentrated in the liquid so it really doesn't need to be reduced unless you plan on using it all. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best refried beans.  They are easy to make and are not laden with fat.

Amazing! I don't know how people compare these to canned. I try to buy the best canned refried organic beans and these are so much better. No comparison. I did, however, fry these with olive oil. It really doesn't add that much more fat - just a couple of TB's of olive oil for a TON of refried beans. I also sauteed about 1/2 an onion in the olive oil until soft prior to adding the strained beans. I didn't use a potato masher, just stirred and mashed with wooden spoon. I added reserved cooking liquid as I stirred and added some shredded cheddar. Delicious. I will never buy canned again.

This was my first time EVER making beans from scratch. I have to say even my hubby was impressed and his moms beans are amazing! I did add some cojito cheese and I did not do the cumin or the jalapeno because my babies were eating this as well. Also, I lowered the salt. I would recommend that you take the liqued out and add it back in slowly as you mash to get your desired consistancy I left it all in and it was a more runny than I would have preffered.

I haven't tried other Refried Bean recipes, but this one was really easy and the best I've tasted! Some refried beans have very little flavor, but these are delicious! I made them the day before and stored them in the fridge covered with cooking liquid (as suggested by another reviewer) then reheated them the day of. They were a lot thicker than when they were first mashed. So next time I will either make them thinner or have more cooking liquid on hand to 'loosen' them up.

These are the best refried beans I have ever had!  I had never considered making my own.  They are really easy and delicious.  Mine took longer to cook because I put my slow cooker on low while I was at work, the beans were still undercooked 8 hours later, so I put the cooker on high for about 3 more hours and they were perfect.  I did have to add about 1/4 cup more water.  I didn't chop my jalapeno, so they weren't hot at all (next time I will chop it though, I like a little heat).  I followed another reviewers advice and substituted half black beans.  I will making these from now on instead of buying canned beans :)

These turned out great.  I actually made them the day before and reheated in the oven with a little cheese on top before serving.  The only thing I changed was to only use 2 tsp. salt, which I thought was plenty, 5 would have been way too much.

This recipe was great!  I only used half the salt and substituted 4 cups of water with chicken broth.  I added 2 slices of hickory-smoked bacon and discarded it after cooking. It was AWESOME!  The bacon only adds a little fat, but it adds a LOT of flavor!  Thank you Chef Claude, I am ranting to my family and friends about this recipe!

these are awesome!!  I usually just buy refried beans in a can.  Never again!!  I did do this a little differently.  I used chicken broth and since I didn't find the recipe til after I started cooking the beans I used a pot on the stove for around 4 hours but I could've cooked them a little longer.  They are still the best beans I have tasted and will use this recipe over and over!!  Thanks!!

Excellent basic recipe. If you were negligent and didn't read the reviews beforehand that warned you about the salt, just strain the beans (they absorbed enough seasoning) and use fresh water to thin it out while you mash.

These were just OK.  There's something weird about cooking peppers in the crockpot all day - I thought it was just bellpeppers, but clearly it's jalapenos, too.  They give off a funky flavor that permiates every bite.  If it wasn't for that, I'd give this 4 stars as it was overall a bit bland otherwise.  I will defnitely use this method again, but next time I'll add only salt and water and refry the cooked beans with diced jalapeno and finely minced onion and garlic.  Thanks for the inspiration and I will continue to make beans from scratch instead of over paying for the canned kind.

These are excellent!  I cooked overnight in the crockpot since we were having company for lunch around 1:00 and I knew they wouldn't have time to cook otherwise.  I used an immersible blender to "mash" them when they were done and left them in the crockpot on warm.  Also, I like to add shredded cheddar cheese when mashing them.  This even makes them creamier!  Yum...

This is one of the best slow cooker recipes I've come across. No fear about it going dry or burning - I could have left it running the whole day at work without fear. Unfortunately I had to make some modifications due to ingredient availability - substituted red onion for regular, red chili for jalapeno, added some taco seasoning and chicken stock powder in place of 1/2 the salt (per some of the other reviewers) and used berlotti instead of pinto beans (the good bean store was closed). And the darn things STILL tasted good - still had to add some more salt (maybe a teaspoon) at the end, but far better to have room to add at the end than trying to take away.  Instead of straining the beans, I used a soup ladle to remove most of the cooking liquid, then mashed the beans in the crock pot and kept them warm until dinner was ready. These are a definite keeper! Can't wait to try them with pinto beans. Thank you so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Unfortunately, I followed advice of another reviewer and removed some of the liquid and used a stick blender to save washing another bowl... i left way too much liquid and it became Refried Bean Soup... not appetizing and all my fault.  The recipe was great, would give it five stars, but had to reduce the salt to 1 Tablespoon.  Also, try soaking the beans the night before to make them more digestible.  Just make sure to use filtered water or the skins will be tough.  Remember to use twice the water as beans when soaking, they take quite a bit of water and puff up considerably.

This is the third change to my original review since the first one over 6 years ago. I live in Southern California, and have had a lot of pinto beans!  This is the BEST way I've ever made beans at home.  The only thing different I do is to substitute a small can of diced chilis in place of the fresh--and only because it's what I always have on hand.  Otherwise, I actually measure out this recipe to make sure it turns out just the way it's written.  Delicious as a bowl of beans with tortillas, or refried as the original recipe intends.

Yummy!  I didn't have jalapeno but followed another idea and added taco seasoning and chicken bullion to the mix.  In my slow cooker it took about 4 hours.  Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing :)

Awesome!!!!! I used chicken broth in place of the water and omitted the salt entirely. I also sauteed the onion and garlic (5 cloves) in olive oil. Added it all to the crock pot and threw in 5 slices of partially cooked bacon. YUMMY!

These are seriously FABULOUS - and so, so easy!  The only thing that I changed was to reduce the salt to 2.5 tsp. (glad I did!), and use 1.5 tsp. cumin instead of 1/8 tsp.  This was just right!  After I drained the beans, I didn't have to add any of the bean water back in.  Used the potato masher until the beans were just chunky enough to our liking.  SO GOOD!  Like so many others have said, I'm done with canned beans!  Oh, and I love that these are so healthy AND vegetarian!

Simply fantastic!  A very simple recipe with simple, every day ingredients that's bursting with flavor. I followed the recipe exactly.  With the delicious flavor comes very subtle heat from the jalapenos.  If you like more heat, (you know who you are and probably already doubled the jalapenos in the recipe in your head just reading over the ingredients) it could benefit from some nice roasted anchos or guajillos for a little extra kick.  Thank you ChefClaude for a seriously delicious and healthy alternative to canned.

Delicious!  I used the whole jalapeno as we like things kind of spicy.  I also used my immersion blender to mix the beans and it worked perfectly.  We had bean burritos for dinner that night and I froze the rest for later meals.  I LOVE this recipe!

This was really good and flavorful.  I used a whole jalepeno instead of half and I cut the salt down to 3 teaspoons.  I cooked the beans for 9 hours, stirring consistently throughout, and I didn't have to mash or strain them.  Came out perfectly.  Also, I chopped up the onion in with the beans.

This was excellent! Did not add the pepper because we didn't have one, so I put some red pepper flakes in it instead. I TOTALLY messed up and put in cinnamon instead of cumin! Oh my! So be sure you watch which brown spice you use :) Before mashing, I split it into two bowls to be able to serve some as whole beans and some as "refried" without the refry! Thanks for the recipe...

So easy! You don't have to chop anything because after 8 hours everything totally disintegrates when you mash it. I put in two chili peppers with seeds and didn't find the beans even mildly spicy. Next time I'll try 3. Way better than canned.

I have tried several crockpot refried beans recipes, and this one is by far the BEST and the EASIEST!! Next time, I will put in the whole jalapeno since we like spice and half did not spice it up, just flavored it well.

I made this quite a bit over the recent months & learned that it's quite good if we leave the pepper out altogether. Even cutting it down to a quarter we were still overpowered by the taste of the pepper.

A good recipe.  I did however make a few changes.  I used 1/2 chicken broth instead of 1/2 water for a little more flavor.  Also omitted the jalapeno. And I'd use a little less regular salt and substitute with season salt and/or garlic salt.  Other than that, it's a great recipe.  I used have for burritos and the other half I reserved the liquid and had over rice.  A keeper!

These are wonderful!  I have made them several times now and my whole family (even my toddler) loves them.  I double the recipe with a 2 lb. bag of pintos and freeze them in containers so I always have them on hand.  I chop the garlic, jalapeno and onion in the food processor and I use less salt.  Delicious!

Made this to use up a pound of black beans that I found in my pantry. I did soak the beans overnight before putting in the crockpot. My house smelled like beans all day! This was a very easy and economical way to make dried beans, I will be using this technique again. Thanks!

Finally!  A refried bean recipe that worked for me!  These were delicious. I didn't chop the jalapeno - just quartered and sliced into 2 pieces.  I soaked the beans overnight - that wasn't clear in the recipe, but I did it, and also waited until the last hour of cooking to add the salt, to keep the beans from getting tough.  Perfect!  Thank you!

I halfed the recipe, but still added more spices then listed. The texture was great, just like the Mexican resturants, BUT there wasn't alot of flavor. It tasted good with feta cheese and salsa in a burrito! It almost seemed like it needed cheese, cream cheese, or something to add flavor to the beans. This would be a good way to make a dip.

This was very good. And you really can't tell the difference between the taste of this recipe and "refried" beans. Always happy to find a healthy alternative that tastes as good as the original. Good job!!

If I could give this more then 5 stars I would.  I will NEVER buy store bought refried beans again!  I did not strain the beans when I mashed them.  I was even eating them while they cooked.  SOO GOOD!!!

Wow! These were excellent.  I made the recipe with 1 cup black beans and 2 cups pinto beans.  I tasted the beans before mashing, and they tasted great just like that.  So I think they would be just as good as beans or refried beans.  Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this recipe several times now and my family just loves it. I use less salt and add a ham bone, amazing taste.  I also add more water and cook on low for 10 hours. Perfect every time. I make bean and cheese burritos or Indian tacos out of this.

I am a big fan of canned refried beans and was very excited to try this recipe!  I followed the instructions for the most part; however, I used a hand mixer at the end to reach desired consistency.  I would definitely add more jalepeno next time and maybe roasted garlic instead of fresh.  Good recipe base, thanks!

I did cut back on the salt and found these to be very good and very easy to make.  If I make them again, however, I will probably use some chicken broth rather than straight water. Considering the fact that they are not loaded with fat, this recipe is a great find!

I thought these were great! I used less salt on the recommendation of other reviews, and it came out great. I also used a bit more of every other spice than called for, and I'm glad I did because it was delicious.

Oh my goodness! Hubby and I were so impressed with these beans, the flavor and texture are great. I haven't bought a can of refried beans for some time, I've been just heating up a can of pinto beans and then mashing them. This was so much easier and the end product is so much better. I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, but I did throw in a canned chile pepper. I loved that the pepper and onion were soft enough that they just mashed right in with the beans. Hubby, baby and I loved these, but we didn't love trying to get them out of baby's hair!)

These are AWESOME!!  The only changes I made were suggestions of other reviewers...I used 3 tsp. salt and 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 water.  I did cook them on low and it took about 12 hours but I was afraid to leave it on high while I was gone because my crock pot cooks a little hot on high.  I was concerned about the halved onion...to remove or not to remove...it cooked up really soft and mixed in just fine with the beans (I used a hand mixer).  I did end up draining off about 4 cups of 'broth' that I haven't been able to bring myself to throw away (it's really good).  I think I will use it in place of the chicken broth in another recipe I'm going to try from this site (Mexican Rice II) and see what happens with that.  If it works, I'll make this recipe again and again :-) with the recommended amount of liquid and use the broth in other dishes.  If my 'bean broth' idea is a flop, then next time, I will reduce the liquid to 2 cans chicken broth and 2 cans water (about 7 cups).  Cooking the beans on high would most likely require 9 cups liquid, but I cooked on low.  A word of caution…after smelling these beans cooking, I got a little anxious to taste them and immediately started dipping out of the crock pot after mashing the beans…they are hot and will burn the roof of your mouth LOL…no matter how good they smell, take a moment to blow on that first bite to cool it off LOL.

This makes amazing beans - to quote my kids, "This is better than Del Taco!" I looked at my hubby and said, "Is that a compliment?" LOL! Seriously - these were amazing! The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 chicken stock. I will make again!

I have never seen pinto beans before so subbed with red kidney beans and was very pleased with the results. Next time I will increase the spice, as we like things "hot".  These freeze very well, so we always have them on hand.  Many thanks to the submitter

Fantastic!  I did change a few things, but this was delicious.  I used 2 cups pinto beans, 1 cup black beans.  I also added chili powder and lemon juice and vegetable broth.  I also cooked it on low, and used only 5 cups water.  (To cook this on high is a little ridiculous) Very Delicious!  Much better than any other beans I have ever had.

These were wonderful.  Next time I will not add as much salt.  Try these with the Spanish Rice II recipe on this site.  Both are better than anything I have ever had in a Mexican resturant.

best refried beans EVER. i make these at least once a week. the only changes i have made were using chicken broth instead of water, reducing the salt (since i used chicken broth), increasing the pepper (i like my beans peppery), and adding two slices of bacon for more flavor - i just take them out and discard them before mashing the beans.

made this x4 for a camping trip.  Made up to the mashing point, and put in ziplocs. Warmed on a campstove at the campsite and mashed.  Worked very well, and got lots of compliments.  Also made Mexican Rice III and Fajita Marinade I (also prepped before hand in ziplocs).  Great change from brats and burgers, and dinner for 30 was ready in under an hour.

These are AMAZING. I have used pinto and black beans so far with this recipe. I also substituted 3 cups of the water for some beer and OH MY those are tasty beans. I can't believe how good, cheap, and easy these beans are. I can't go back to canned at all now. WOW. WOW. Did I say WOW? WOW!

I made these for a Mexican themed burrito night, and I have to tell you everyone loved them. The kids went back for seconds and thirds. I made mine with low sodium chicken stock, and used a little canned jalapeno, so I could control the heat. A little hint for some of you who like extra flavor.(My husband accidently warmed up the left over taco meat with the beans, and said they were even better than the first night)

What an excellent way to make homemade refried beans!  These were very tasty and easy to change up to suit the needs of any family.  I made mine with 1lb (about 2 cups) pinto beans, soaked overnight and then cooked in the crockpot all day with 4 cups canned chicken broth and 2 cups water.  Then drain well and mash away!  I did save all the extra liquid because they got a little dry for left-overs.  This recipe makes a nice, big amount, and you would never guess there is no lard or re-frying involved!  thanks for a great idea.

DELICIOSO!!  These beans are super simple.. it took me less than 5 minutes to throw the ingredients into the pot-- and then you wait.  The house smells amazing while these are cooking.  ***Make sure to either add a little extra water, or really keep an eye on these.  I added over a cup of water to mine, they kept drying out.  They turned out perfectly.  Just kept them in the crockpot and used my potato masher to mash 'em up.  I will reduce salt next time I make these.

Very, very good!  Also can be made with only 1 c. of beans- which is perfect for 2 servings!

I LOVE these beans!  I finally got smart and saved the reserved liquid to add back to the leftover beans as they tended to dry out over the next few days.  Next time, I might add 3 or 4 jalapenos to kick it up a notch.  Overall, these beans are as good in quality as the ones served in any good Mexican restaurant.  And MUCH better for you!!!!

So simple to make and delicious. I substituted half of the water with chicken broth and they were delicious. I can't see me ever buying the canned stuff again.

I have made these beans once a week since I found it on this website. They are so healthy and I believe they are responsible for lowering my cholesteral. (move aside oatmeal!)

Super easy!  Tried it once with chicken broth, and once with water.  We prefer water as it we like our refried beans, with no frills.  Will make this 2-3 times a month.  Freezes well too.
Thanks so for sharing!

These beans have become a standard dish in our house. I cook them at least once per week. Everyone likes them, including the baby and the super-picky 4-year-old. They are so simple and quick to throw together into the slow cooker. Prep takes me under 5 minutes. The beans freeze well too.

Finally - a great, flavorful refried beans recipe!  This one isn't bland or gloppy.  These are great as a side or for bean burritos or as a base for bean dip.  They're yummy and quite simple.  I've been looking for ways to cut down on the canned foods that we eat to be healthier, and this is a great way to do just that.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've never made refrieds before, thought it would be to much trouble. Well this recipe changed that. Couldn't be easier.The only change was added another seeded jalepeno. When done i thought i had to much liquid left and  was afraid of loosing to much flavor but as you start mashing they soak it up. Thanks for recipe

These beans are great!!! They are healthy, tasty, and easy to prepare. What's not to love!? I do cut back on the salt by about half, and use about 4 cups of fat-free chicken broth. I use two whole jalapeno peppers - my husband likes the spice - but that doesn't even make them that spicy. This makes a big portion - I usually freeze half of it. They defrost well too.

I had never made refried beans before.  These were so easy, I let them cook all night, and so tasty I'm eating them for lunch.  I like that they are fat free.  I did put a little leftover pork roast in with them while they cooked.  Yum.  I also made some bean dip out of some of them.  Also really good.  I'll definately make them again.

I make this very often. I follow the recipe but add a package of taco seasoning in the beginning, which adds a lot of flavor. I don't have a potato masher so I don't even bother with that part but they are still great. Usually I just put them over rice and eat. Yum=)

Easy and tasty!  I left the jalapeno half intact and removed it after cooking.  Next time I will dice half the onion and blend it in at the end for a little extra flavor.

Jumping back to say that I made these differently today and still love them.  I did a double batch with half black & half pinto, one diced onion, no jalapeno ... and they're wonderful!!  

This is such a good recipe and an easy one to tweak.

substituted half the water for chicken broth, put in a whole jalapeno, added 2 TBS chili powder and topped with cheese.

Very flavorful.  Beans are hard to flavor, the gravy or juice is flavorful but the bean is dry.  I live in south Tx where everyone makes refried beans and I can't believe that this is actually as good as everyone says.  I followed the recipe except for the water.  I added enough water to cover the beans and added water throughout the day, as per other reviews saying too much water, etc.  I tasted the beans whole and they were ok, but once I mashed them, they delivered!  I can't rave enough.

Way too much pepper! 1/2 - 3/4 tsp is enough. I cut back on the salt (to 4 tsp), cut back to 8 cups of liquid, and used 2 cups of vegetable broth in place of some water (as read in the reviews), but even after doing this, I couldn't eat it the first time because of the high pepper content. Once I made it again with less pepper, it turned out MUCH better. Someone made a great suggestion about putting in the entire half of the chili so it could easily be removed once done cooking. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned the amount of pepper recommended.

My first time making refried beans, couldn't have been easier and they tasted fantastic!  I followed other reviewers advice, used chicken stock instead of water, added taco seasoning, and added a whole jalapeno.  I am going to add another jalapeno next time, it was not spicy in the least with one.  I added a whole chopped onion in the beginning cooking stages, which gave the beans some nice texture.  I used no salt, didn't need it.  Loved these, I will never open a can again!

I use a variation of this recipe, but had to comment! This is a GREAT way to make refried beans minus the fat and and minus all that hard work! Black beans work good here too, even a mixture of the 2. I dump off the excess liquid and only need to add a very small amount back in, if at all. I use a stick blender right in the crock and much more cumin. A dash of taco seasoning seems to round out the flavors a bit. EXCELLENT- healthy, versatile and easy recipe!

These were pretty good. After reading the reviews I thought I was going to be in "refried bean nirvana" but I wasn't overly impressed.  I added a bunch of taco-flavored seasonings because onion and a tiny bit of cumin sounded really bland to me.  With the addition of all the extra spices (chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, etc) I was able to significantly cut down on the salt.  I can get 784 mg's of sodium per serving out of a can.  Why would I prepare homemade food the same way??  In the end it was just a big pot of beans all mushed up.  Way better than a can but not the best I've ever had.

The taste is really good. I made this after I read a lot of the reviews. I used beef broth instead of water, extra onions, no salt and no hot peppers. I mashed them right in the crock pot.

This is the best recipe for refried beans.  I make these all the time for my family of 8 and everyone loves them.  The only thing I change is I use chicken broth instead of water (using the chicken base sold at Costco), and I omit the salt.  Not only do these taste awesome, they are SO easy!

Yummy! I reduced the salt as recommended by other cooks. Probably could have added the whole jalapeno - I don't like spicy food but it could use a tiny kick. This recipe was excellent.

Excellent flavor.  Not too spicy.  The stuff in the can doesn't even compare.  I used a small can of green chilies, omitted the salt and used 2 cup chicken broth 1 bottle of corona and 6 cups water.

My first attempt at refried beans & they turned out great!  I made the following changes based on the other reviews:  Used all chicken broth instead of water and no salt.  I cooked them for 7.5 hrs on low in the crock pot (it cooks hot and more than 1 c of water had evaporated) and then put them on warm for 2.5 hours.  I ended up pulling all of the onions out and using my small mixer on the beans with about 1/2 of the reserved juice.

I felt the garlic flavor was too strong in this recipe, though the texture was good. For refried beans, I prefer to taste mostly the beans, and not the other ingredients. I might try it again next time with much less garlic.

I love this recipe!!!  Mexican food is my favorite food.  I made this for a dinner party I had, they were a big hit.
they tasted so good.  I made them a week befor and put them in the freezer, then took them out to defrost reheated, strained and used my mixer to "mash" them.  I will make them again. Thanks for a great, no-fat recipe.

Awesome! I thought 5 tsp. of salt was a bit much, especially since I added enough chicken boullion granules to make two cups of broth, so only added 2 1/2 tsps. Other than that didn't change a thing. As good as the ones which I love at our local mexican restaurant!!! Definitely try this recipe, you won't be sorry.

Made this in the instapot and it turned out so good. My husband doesn’t like refried beans but loves these. I made it as per the recipe and cooked for 45 mins in IP. Removed a couple cups of water after cooking and puréed. These freeze great as well. Also good in a layered bean chip dip.

I made this in the insta pot, cooked for 1 hour then blended it.  This made a ton, about 8 cups.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.  Also, I will make a broth to cook it in rather than water and omit the salt.

Super impressed! Strained after 8 hours and didn’t need any additional liquid after they were mashed. TONS of flavor, seasoned exactly as the recipe called for. Came out very creamy.

My husband loves refried beans so I was looking for an easy recipe to make at home. I scaled this recipe to 20 servings as my bag of pinto beans was 2 lbs and I wanted to freeze the leftovers. I always soak my beans overnight before making them in the crockpot as I have had bad experiences in the past with them not cooking fast enough, I also had always been told to add the salt at the end not the beginning.. I reduced the water to 6 cups, I used salt free vegetable broth, tomato sauce, tomato paste and water to make up the 6 cups of liquid,  I had these leftover from making enchilada sauce.  I doubled the onion and garlic which was perfect for us, I added only 1 tsp of salt after mashing the beans and it was salty enough for our tastes. My beans were ready in 6 hours on high, I did not need to drain as the liquid was the perfect amount for the consistency we like. They were a big hit, thanks!

I too will never again buy canned beans!! These are so good. my family loves just having the beans with cheese and sour cream for burritos. Makes for an easy weeknight dinner. Also have a coworker who begs for a tub of leftover beans with shredded cheese on top to eat with corn chips!

I've been making this recipe for several years. Eat 1/4, freeze 3/4 in glad containers. I usually add extra jalapeno, cumin, and some chipotle chilli powder. After mashing the beans I whip them with an electric mixer to get a smooth texture.
Very nice.

These were some of the best refried beans I have made.  Enjoyed them on burritos, tostados and even as a dip.  I will be making these again.

Thanks for a hit, Chef Claude. I haven't even thought about buying a can of refried beans ever since I came across this recipe. As a matter of personal taste, after first making the dish as directed, I made the following adjustments: I used black beans, only added half the salt and omitted the jalapenos. I also found that the beans can be cooked in a Dutch oven on the stove, uncovered, at medium heat for one hour and 10 minutes. But watch your water level throughout the time (there will be very little left). Also, the beans won't be super-soft, but they will mash easily. My kids like them that way. You can also substitute 1 TBSP of onion powder in lieu of a fresh onion and 1 TBSP garlic powder in lieu of minced garlic in a pinch. Whether I'm making the full or the "pinched" version, these beans make frequent appearances at my table.

I have been using this recipe for years!  Like anything you make often, I have played with it a bunch and made it my own.  

For me, I use pickled jalapenos because I always have them on hand, also I use less salt.  Every time I make it with the amount of salt recommended I feel like it is too salty, and have been told by others its a little salt heavy as well.  I also use broth, half broth half water.  Cayenne is good too!

Super easy and delicious! My husband LOVED it. We won’t need to buy canned refried beans anymore. I added chicken broth and combined with water. Also reduced salt and used sea salt which has more flavors in it. It turned out great. I’m sure I’ll cook it again and this recipe will be added to my family favorite meal lists!

These beans were excellent.  I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, but did have a 7 oz can of Herdez' Salsa Verde.  It only took 4 hours to cook on high in the slow cooker, and I used my Cuisinart hand blender for a smooth consistency.  The best part, as mentioned in the recipe, it is fat-free which is unlike refried beans in a can.

So, I made this recipe the first time and found it to be way too peppery for my taste... and I like pepper!  I dumped the first batch and waited a couple months before trying it again.  The second time I cut the pepper in half and still found it was too peppery for my liking, but definitely much better than the first time.  I ate about a quarter of the batch before I couldn't do the pepper anymore.  When I try it again, I will just start with a sprinkle of pepper and add it to taste.  But once I get the correct amount of pepper down I believe this recipe will be a true keeper, which is why I gave it 3 stars.

As per other reviews, I cut the salt from 5 to 2 tsp. I used the whole jalapeno instead of just half and I increased the cumin to heaping 1/2 tsp instead of only 1/8.  They had a bit of 'bite' but not too much - really flavourful!

Outstanding. Who knew authentic frijoles were so easy? I have made this 5x now and it comes out amazing every time with very little prep time. 

I only used 2 tsp salt, added about 50% more garlic, 1 full Jalapeño, and used 1 Tbsp fresh cumin, 1 tsp paprika plus 1 tsp bacon drippings. I probably added 3 cups more water too since I like to drink the extra broth separately. I cooked about 10 hours. 

After the beans were cooked I drained off and reserved most of the liquid (the broth really is amazing as a warm comforting morning drink). Then I transferred beans to a med-high cast iron skillet with about 2 Tbs melted lard and a bit of broth. Then I proceeded to mash them with a slotted spoon since I don't have a potato masher (it only takes about 5 min to mash and fry and I leave them slightly lumpy). I then fried them for 2-3 min more then removed form heat and served. 

I do not add cheese in the beans since I think they taste great without. I only add cheese if I am assembling a dish with beans that calls for it (burritos). 

I tried an immersion blender one time but it obliterates the beans and leaves no texture and they no longer felt authentico. 

I have tried them twice with some chicken stock powder (no MSG) but found while still very good they lose a slight bit of authentic taste from my San Diego upbringing and months spent traveling in Mexico. So I normally leave chicken stock out (unless I have some stock unused in the refrigerator).

Won't be buying canned refried anymore.  Tasty and you can make only what is needed.  I end up throwing most of the canned stuff away after using it for what I wanted to make.

These beans were so delicious and SO easy to make. Instead of chopping the jalapeno, I threw in a whole one and threw it out with the onion after the beans were cooked. I drained most of the liquid out and used an immersion blender. It took barely over a minute to get the desired consistency.I reduced the amount of salt as some users suggested and I added some butter once they were mashed. I'll never buy canned refried beans again.

These are better for you, and the flavor is exponentially better than any refried beans I've ever had. Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful recipe for refrieds without the frying. The second time we made it, I added a large can of roasted green chilies and it was even better. We poured off the liquid at the end, smoothed with a stick blender adding liquid back in a bit at a time so we could get the consistency we wanted. This recipe is going in my "Go-To" recipe file!

Great slow cooker recipe.  Use chicken broth instead of water and omit the salt. Use leftovers for bean dip later.

This is our go to recipe for refried beans. It's easy to throw it all in the crock pot and let it cook. I reduce the onion and add a slice or two of bacon or a spoonful of bacon grease. The amount of salt seems like a lot, but don't be tempted to reduce it, as most of it doesn't end up in the final product anyway. These beans freeze wonderfully and we like to make and freeze burritos with them. One pot usually yields about 12-14.

This recipe is great, but a bit mild as written. I use 3 jalapeños in mine - it add flavor without being too spicy for my kids.

I've used this recipe for a few years now and we love it! So simple, tasty and much healthier than canned. I use 1/2 black beans and 1/2 pinto and about 1/2 the salt and an unseeded jalepeno since we like it a little spicy. But overall a really great recipe. I can't count the number of times friends and family have requested the recipe. I'll never buy canned again :)

I halved this recipe and used my smaller 2qt crockpot. When I got home, I found all the liquid gone! I added more water/chicken stock and waiting a couple more hours. They still turned out great! Next time, I'll use at least 2 cups more liquid if I half the recipe.

Very good recipe and a lot more healthier than either making refried beans or buying them in a can. A couple of things to consider. Hold the bean juice longer than you think before you pour it down the sink. The longer the beans sit the harder and more crusty they become and you will want to add more bean  juice to keep the consistency of the beans more like a restaurant style of beans which are usually right on the borderline of being soupy but they are taste very fresh. Also, considering not adding any add or cutting the salt by at least half to the recipe. As other have noted if  you make this recipe as is the result are very salty beans. Also, unless you think hot tasting food considering leaving the jalapeno out too. Gives the beans a nice warm flavor but could be a problem for people who are sensitive to heartburn. I cooked them all eight hours and the beans are very easy to mash down and eat right away after you strained them and then added back the bean juice. They do reheat well and taste even better the day they are initially made.  Overall, great recipe for people who love refried beans but don't like all of the oil involved.

This recipe was so easy!  I only used 3 teaspoons of salt.  I would say to add back about 1 cup of the liquid while you are mashing the beans.  Everyone in my family loved these beans!

Deliciously simple recipe, will continue to make this side dish treat for years to come. Decreased the salt to 3 teaspoons, gotta watch the ole sodium intake. We like our beans with a bit of a kick so I added two jalapeños with the seeds, BIG pinch of red chili powder and cumin. Yum!

These are the most amazing "refried" beans we have ever eaten!! My bean hating husband loved them, and my refried bean obsessed son gave them double thumbs up as well (and he's PICKY!!). I omitted the jalapeño and the onion (because I didn't have any onions on hand). I will never buy canned refried beans again.

Wonderful flavor. Will probably use a hand blender for a smoother texture if I prepare it for guest, but the potato masher worked just fine for my family.

I've used this recipe several times now and it has become the standard way that I cook beans. I recommend only using 3 teaspoons of salt, then adding additional salt, to taste. I also add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. The beans will be awesome, either way.

Fantastic base recipe for pinto or black beans - very tasty as is, and amenable to variation for taste. My family doesn't like heat, so I subbed in green chilies for the jalapeño to get some of the flavor without the kick.  Thanks for a keeper!

I changed the recipe a little bit by using black beans instead of pinto beans.  I used only 2 1/2 tsp of sea salt and chicken broth instead of plain water.  I also added a few small slices of ginger root to help with digestibility.  These were the best "refried" beans I've ever had!!

Wonderful recipe! I omitted all salt due to my spouse having salt restrictions for heart reasons. We took the advice of another post and when mashing the beans added a bit a of lard and 1/4 cup of milk. Still very flavorful. We serve it with just a dollop of sour cream to add a touch of more flavor.

This is wonderful!  I used 2 cups black beans & 1 cup pinto and left out the jalapeno.  I also followed the advice of others and didn't add the salt until I was mashing the beans.  Only used 2 teaspoons of sea salt.  Didn't add any more liquid during mashing however a day or two later the beans thickened up in the fridge so next time I will make them a little thinner.  I will also try low sodium chicken broth in place of the water to see if/how that changes the flavor.  My Hubby who doesn't like refried beans loved these and is all ready asking me to make them again!

Great recipe.  I made this for a family dinner.  The beans were so delicious, I decided not to mash them.  The family raved over them.  I made this recipe several times since.  I did also reduce the salt like others suggested.

Amazing!  I love refried beans but I don't often buy the cans because frankly - it looks like something Fido would eat.  These were delicious and creamy.  I did tone down the salt a bit and reduced the amounts for our small family and I used 1/2 water and 1/2 homemade beef broth.  Definitely worth the time!

This recipe is amazing and simple. My apartment smelled so good that I had to serve a bowl of beans at 6 1/2 hours and they taste perfectly tender. I still leave them in until 8 hrs because they mash wonderfully at that point. I've doubled the recipe using half black bean half pinto and they mash soo creamy and delicious!

I have made this 2x now and each time has been great. Refried beans in the can  are not available where I live and this recipe is a prefect replacement. I made them in the pressure cooked since I don't have a slow cooker. Be sure to soak the beans overnight to reduce cooking time. I cook on low-medium for an hour+ (my cooker is too small,too full to give the full whistles). Following suggestions from other reviews: I cooked in chicken stock (homemade from a recipe on this site) and I added some kidney beans. I used hot green chilli instead since I have this on hand and enjoy the heat! Thanks for the great recipe.

First effort came out sooo delicious!!I didn't salt until it was done because we eat a low sodium diet and didn't want it to be too salty. I used chicken broth as was recommended by others and also used whole jalepeno. I thought using the whole jalepeno might be too hot but it wasn't at all and since we like a little heat next time I will use 2 or 3. Just as a reference we like a "medium" heat salsa and this was definitely mild with the 1 pepper.  I also used my hand held immersion blender and mixed to our desired texture. I won't be buying canned ever again!!!

I haven't eaten refried beans in years simply because of the lard, even though I really like them.  I was amazed at how much these taste like the lard-loaded traditional beans, with none of the "bad".  Really, really good recipe, thank you so much ChefClaude!

I've made homemade beans for years.  When I saw this I had to try it.  I followed the recipe as written with two changes: one less teaspoon of salt and I added 3 slices of raw bacon.  It turned out delicious.  Bacon was always a necessary ingredient when I made beans just like my grandma did.  I know this recipe is supposed to be low fat but if that is not of concern to you then add the bacon.  You'll be glad you did.

Never had a lot of luck making beans until this recipe.  It's just right for our taste.  I make a pot and then freeze in serving sizes with juice.

This recipe was so incredibly easy.  I love the crock pot method so much more than other methods I have tried (stove top).  The beans came out so deliciously tasty!  I thought I would make a whole batch and freeze leftovers... but there were not any!!  Will definitely again.  Thank you!  :-)

I didn't have any because I was in the middle of a strict diet but I literally had to stop my kids from fighting over them!  That's a hit in my book!  My (very thin and very active) daughter ate 9 of them when she came home from school!

This is a staple recipe in my house. We eat the beans and "sauce" before I mash them. I've made this with all black beans, half and half, any combination comes out perfect. I've subbed fresh ingredients for jarred salsa, sometimes I use chicken broth, once I used vegetable broth on accident, wouldn't repeat intentionally, but you just can't go wrong. It freezes well, too. I tend to use less cheese when I make dip, and plain Greek yogurt is a healthier alternative to sour cream, and once it's mixed in you won't know the difference!

We love this recipe.  Perfect as is, but have also used 1/2 and 1/2 black beans and pinto. YUM! Made a double batch to have plenty in the freezer! SOOO much better than canned stuff.

I gave this recipe a 5 star because it turns out great following the recipe minus some salt or adding additional things to it. It is cost efficient, healthier and delicious! I make it on a regular basis and my children love it. Thank you for a good recipe

This was an awesome dish! I read other reviews, and decided to use 3 Cups chicken broth for liquid, and only 2 tsp. of salt. 
So easy and awesome, not any leftovers at the family gathering.

A bit salty, I should have read the other reviews, but really easy and tasty nonetheless . A refried taste without the high fat content. I'll make this recipe again but will reduce the salt !!

This recipe was great. I was skeptical of the flavor at first but the end product was exquisite. I cooked mine on low overnight and only added 3 teaspoons of salt instead of 5. You can always add more salt at the end if you needed. This recipe is so much better than what you buy at the store, Thank You Chef Claude!

I like so many of us would buy canned refried beans. After looking at the cost difference in making from dry vs can, I decided to make from dry. This a GREAT recipe. The good thing about making these 'beans' is that you can make them and freeze them if not going to use all at once. (we have some type of with beans dish atleast once a week) and the kids use then for breakfast tacos.  I have over time adjusted the seasoning to our tastes but with those listed. Thank you

This has become a staple in our family. It is so simple and delicious. I take out some of the liquid at the end and just mash them with a potato masher. Excellent!

For the most part, I followed the recipe to the T.  The only thing I did was cut the salt in half according to every user who gave a review on this recipe.  I still found it to be a tad bit salty.  Also, instead of mashing the beans I threw it in the blender.  Awesome healthier alternative to refried beans.

Family loved these beans. Super easy to make. I was concerned about the amount of liquid and getting the correct consistency so I removed a lot of the liquid after the cooking time was up and added it back in as needed. The second time i made them I also cut down on the salt and no one seemed to notice.

Here's what I did: I halved the salt. I only had a 16 bean soup mix at hand so I used that instead of pinto beans (turned out great anyways). I used one whole jalapeno pepper and I also added some chili powder. At the 6 hour mark, my beans were already nicely cooked but there was still a ton of water/soup left over. I decided to drain the beans and mash it with half of the "soup" and then I poured it into a large ramekin, and baked it uncovered for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. The resulting beans tasted a lot more flavorful after baking. Next time, I will decrease the added water a bit and will probably add more jalapenos since I love the jalapeno flavor; however, I will definitely continue using the mixed bean variety and will also keep baking it at the end!

Wonderful! I will never be satisfied with canned refried beans again. Since I was short on time I used canned beans in a pot on the stove. Also, I used a bell pepper instead. Even my kids liked it!

awesome!! Cant believe making beans could be so simple!  Rinsing them and sticking them in the slow cooker on low over night was awesome!  Flavor was fantastic and the fantastic thing is you can change them to suit any flavor.  I will never buy another can of beans.  THANKS!!!

Amazing!!! I soaked them in a bowl of water for 2.5 days and then boiled them for and hour or so until they were soft and then let them simmer in the seasonings for longer. Best recipe of flavors!! Family loved it.

These were so much better then canned.  And I love that these are vegan for some family members!  Woot!  I used 3 tsp of salt and it was perfect.  I also used two onions and 6 small garlic cloves.  I drained off all the liquid and added about 1/2 cup of water back into the beans after I used my hand mixer to mash them.  We used these in burritos tonight and some ate them as a side and we had no leftovers.  I think these are a new staple in our house.  Thank you!

I love this recipe. There is alot of wiggle room for how you season your beans, do not be afraid to tweak the flavor. I've made this countless times and each time seems better than the last. You can not go wrong with this foolproof recipe!

This is my go to recipe for no-refried beans. Easy to throw together before heading off to work in AM on low.  Have some for dinner and freeze the rest in ziploc baggies.

This is my favorite recipe on this site! It is so easy and the resulting beans are so versatile.  Not only a stand alone refried bean dish but I've used this recipe as a base for soup, chili and the greatest bean dip ever. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is so versatile for any meal of the day. I pre-soak the beans which helps with digestion, trust me ;) I use 3-4 teaspoons of canned hot jalapenos since the fresh ones from the store are sometimes very bland and not spicy. I also put a full teaspoon of cumin powder and cut the salt to 2 1/2 teaspoons as others noted. I eat them for breakfast with corn tortillas and a fried egg on top, and for lunch or dinner it's perfect with shredded lettuce, salsa, and cheese. Love that the recipe is healthy and tasty too!

Trying to be more healthy, but frugal, I purchased several types of dried beans.  I didn't know what to do with pinto.  I found this recipe and tried it.  Like other reviewers, I cut down the salt and used half black beans and half pinto.  They were not bad, but not "to die for" either.  For the cheapness of beans, I will make again, but will keep experimenting for more flavor.  The leftovers, I chose to freeze.

Perfect recipe for refried beans. Serve them with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, sour cream and fresh salsa on top and it is a wonderfully healthy ( and very cheap) meal!

Everyone seemed to really like this.  I used canned green chiles, added more cumin to taste, and altered the recipe for the stovetop using canned beans.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because of the excessive salt. Thank goodness I read the reviews before I made it for the first time, and cut the salt in half. I also took the advice of adding salt after the beans have cooked. I used chicken stock in place of some of the water, for a little flavor boost, but it's still great with just water. Thanks for the healthy and delicious alternative to canned beans!

Canned beans aren't gonna cut it after making these. After trying a few different ways I found a few changes made a big difference. I add a can of whole tomatoes, 3 chicken bullion cubes and cut the pepper back a half of a teaspoon only using 1 and 1/4 teaspoons.

These beans were amazing!  I cooked them on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker and it took approx. 2 hours to cook them.  I then used my kitchen aid mixer to mash them up!  The only thing I would do differently next time is cut down on the salt, maybe add 3 tsp instead.  But they were delicious and I will be making these from now on instead of buying canned refried beans!

Cheap, easy and best of all... tastes great!  I do agree w/the comments on salt.  Start out with 2 or 3 teaspoons.  You can always add some later if needed.

Love this recipe!!! I followed the recipe exactly, no modification at all, and it turned out wonderful!  No canned refried beans anymore!  As others said, this makes a huge meal, so I am freezing some for later use.  With this recipe and some other Mexican recipes (Mexican rice and chicken enchiladas), whenever I want to eat Mexican, I just simply make one at home :)

I went with 2 1/2 tsp of salt, 7 cups of water and added 1/4 tsp of chili powder.  Once I drained the broth off after cooking, I put the beans in a food processor and added about 1/4 of the broth back.  These were perfect for eating that day.  Added a little bit of the extra broth for the beans we saved to eat later.

Everyone loved them like this!

loved this, simple and delicious! Doubled the jalapeño and onion, used chicken broth instead of water and omit the salt. Used my kitchen aid to “mash”.

Made these at the recommendation of a friend and I am SURE glad I did. The flavor is perfect and what a wonderful thought knowing I am not feeding my family unnecessary additives or preservatives. This recipe makes it so simple that it is for sure going to become a regular staple in our diets!

I make these all the time.  Only difference I do is add a little more cumin.  The best thing about it is my stepdaughter telling me I make the BEST refried beans.  Even better than her hispanic grandmother. Now that is a compliment!!!

The best beans ever! So easy and delicious!  Will never buy canned retried beans again. These freeze well and taste even better after freezing. I always soak my beans over night, after rinsing well. I usually triple the batch. Don't be afraid of the jalapeño, they are not spicy beans.

So easy and so good!! My husband and I have nachos with all the fixin's including refried beans probably once a week and these were so much better than any canned beans we have tried. The only modifications I made were to add the whole jalepeno pepper (you are seeding it before chopping it so it is only adding flavor not heat) and a little more cumin, probably 1/2 teaspoon. I froze some in small containers, one of which was thawed last night, and they still tasted great so I can confirm that they freeze well. Hubby loved them....goodbye canned refried beans. Thank you for the great recipe.

I started making this recipe when we were living overseas, and refried beans were very difficult to find and very expensive as well. I liked it a lot as written, and since I am watching sodium, I halved the salt. It works well with other beans, too. When elecricity was iffy and beans didn't completely cook, I finished them in a pressure cooker in few minutes. We are back in the states now and I still make them, but I add a small can of chipoltle peppers. Much better than canned, all the way around. Sometimes I cook them in chicken broth and beer and omit the salt. You don't have to mash them. I use this recipe for black beans to replace canned beans in recipes for much more flavor.

These are terrific.  I added no salt until after cooked and then only 1 1/2 tsp.  I added extra garlic and will add even more next time and also a little more cumin.  Loved how easy and creamy and delicious these turned out.  I too will never buy canned refried beans again.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

For a dip for chips that is even better than FRITO LAY dip, drain and mash per recipe and do not add back water, but 2 or 3 cans of Ro-Tel HOT diced tomatoes and green chilis.

Great beans!  It is a very easy recipe.  I made them as is except I upped the garlic a little.  Next time I would use a whole fresh jalapeno with the seeds in.  I think that would add a little more spice, plus I love the taste of fresh jalapeno!  I plan to use this in the “Seven Layer Tex Mex Dip” by Ginny.

Very good and super easy!  I left the salt out at the start and salted after the beans were cooked (according to taste).

I would have given this 5 stars if it were less salty. Otherwise, the flavor is really good and it's super easy to make. I used 3/4 tablespoon of granulated garlic in place of fresh (out of pure laziness), and a seeded dry pepper in place of a fresh jalapeño (for a little more heat). I also replaced about a third of the liquid with chicken broth, and reduced the added salt to 1 tablespoon (the broth has about 1/3 teaspoon worth of salt per can, and I used two, so the *total* salt content was reduced by about 1 1/3 teaspoons).  I also don't have a potato masher so I smashed the beans for a few minutes (with about a third of the liquid) using my sturdiest whisk, then used my electric beater on low for about two more minutes.

This is a keeper for sure.  I followed the recipe except that I used the whole jalapeno with seeds and I omitted the salt because I have to, however I did salt at the end to taste, which was much less than what the recipe called for.  My slow cooker is on the small side so I had to add water as it was absorbed however the 9 cups were used by the end of the eight hours.  We made bean burritos tonight.

A bit too salty for my taste.  Still, looks and tastes pretty good.  I would cut back on salt in the future.

No more caned refried beans for me. This recipe is the most delicious beans I've had,and I am a lover of refried beans. I went strictly by the recipe, and it came out perfectly. I'm making them again tonight and may add a couple spices and herbs that I am partial to. Really, no changes at all. Thank you for sharing this one-of-a-find recipe that can be used as a side dish, a main dish for burritos, tacos, tostado, lettuce wrap, and a dozen other fabulous food creations.

These are great and easy.  I followed the recipe to a T and they are great.  Next time I will add more hot peppers, onions and possibly some meat. We eat fajitas a lot and like refried beans on the bottom like glue to hold everything in. Yummo!

This is FANTASTIC.  Perfect just as it's written, but if you want (or need!) to change it up, you have endless options for doing so.  We make these and just keep them in the refrigerator for very easy, very fast burritos whenever we want. High in protein, free of fat, extremely flavorful -- what a winner of a recipe.  We tend to skip the jalapeno and instead use four hot red peppers from our garden (very spicy!), and I also leave in the broth and mash it all up with an immersion blender.  It might seem slightly wet at first, but after a day in the refrigerator, it's just right.  THANK YOU!

I love these beans! I keep beans on hand and I also have about three or four in the freezer ready to go when I think about it at the last minute. For the freezer packs I have all the spices, pack of beans and one of the nine cups of water; place this into slow cooker and add the additional water - voila!

Not to alarm anyone, but you are actually supposed to soak the beans overnight and toss the soaking water. That will make for less bean related gas...
The beans I cooked are delicious but very VERY gassy.

I love how easy this recipe is and how much it makes! My whole family loves these beans and they're so cheap to make this way. DO NOT add all the salt, though! I actually don't add any until it's all done cooking, and then just 'to taste,' since my toddlers don't need much salt. I freeze at least half of this each time and that works well - they taste great even after being frozen. Enjoy!

Unbelievably easy and delicious. I made the recipe as written and I could not be happier. As a 22-year vegetarian, married to an omnivore, I have finally won the argument that you do not need a fat/lard to have delicious beans. My husband agreed that these beans were amazingly good.

My son loves refried beans and wanted me to make a more authentic bean dip. This recipe fit the bill. I did make some small changes. I reduced the salt but added chicken bouillon for added flavoring. I also added 2 tsp of olive oil. When it was done cooking I put the beans (onions, garlic, jalepenos) through the food processor for a smooth consistency. It was more like our favorite restaurant. Easy enough and delicious!

This seems like just a quick and easy way to throw together a nondescript side dish. But these will surprise you. They may become the star of your dinner like they did mine. Of course, refried beans are never pretty, but these have an absolutely beautiful texture. Delicious!

Easy, good tasting refried bean recipe that is a better alternative than canned beans and taste better than a lot of restaurant refried beans.  Goes well with the other Mexican dishes I have tried from allrecipes.com.

The best!! I like spicy so added a whole jalapeno with seeds and cut back a bit on the salt since using chicken broth. you can add but can't take away so add salt when done. Bacon fat is the finishing touch! Fresh pico de gallo and top with Cilantro Lime Chicken from this sight and you've got a winning combo! Don't forget the guacamole!

They only left out one important direction. NEVER pour cold water on hot beans. Heat it up in the microwave first. If you forget this be prepared for hard beans. Goes for all dried beans. I learned this the hard way more than 50 years ago.

I make these frequently, and I love the recipe, but I do make two changes: no jalapeño, and the salt I reduced to 3 1/2 t. instead of 5, which seemed like to much and I experimented several times to conclude my new measurement. :)

I’ve made this a few times and it always turns out so delicious. I will never go back to store bought due to this recipe.  After making the beans for the first time, the only thing I changed was the amount of salt. I reduced it by at least 1 tsp. Thanks for posting :)

I have had this saved for the longest time, and finally tried it...it is sooooo good!  Unfortunately I did not have any jalapenos and will most definitely add it the next time, but it is hard to imagine these being any better!  We simply loved them!  I may cut back on the salt just a tad the next time, but that is just my personal preference.  No more canned beans for me!  Thanks for a terrific recipe :)

Simple and delicious!!  My husband is not a huge fan of refried beans and he thought these are great. These are even better than my grandmothers beans that I grew up on because they are not filled with the traditional lard she made them with. I am looking forward to making them again!!

Ehhh, these beans were just so-so. Not enough flavor, even with extra spice. I didn't salt them until the end of cooking (salt can make dried beans take forever to soften.) I adjusted the recipe to 2 cups of dried kidneys (10 servings.) I used a tablespoon of cumin, a whole jalapeno, extra garlic, extra onion and black pepper to cook them, then added MORE garlic  and smoked paprika after they were cooked. I soaked the beans overnight, then cooked them on high for 7hr in the crockpot. An easy way to cook dried beans without having to watch the stove, and I will use this method again....but really they are just that..cooked beans, nothing special. No need to save the cooking liquid, the mashed beans were thin enough (the water is the gassy part, anyway!!)

These are awesome.  I made as directed, added chili powder & more cumin but they came out delicious & I had enough left over to freeze.  I also used the "broth" for vegetable soup.

These were incredible! I won't ever buy canned beans again.  The only change I made was to use fat-free reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water, and they turned out amazingly well.  I may use black beans in the future, as well.  I used the beans in a cream cheese based bean dip and it was heavenly. Thanks!

I served this as a side dish to veggie fajitas and it was ok.  Most of the flavor it had came from the salt and my husband even said it was bland.  The recipe makes a LOT, but this works for me as I portioned it out and froze for later use in bean burgers, burritos, and dips.  As a stand-alone dish though, it was just average.

This is a GREAT recipe well worth trying!!!  Decided to give this recipe a try since I use 2 or 3 cans of refried beans a month and have a slow cooker I hardly ever use. I followed the recipe to the letter except (lol) I tried TIGERHAWK's review suggestion of using half pinto and half black beans.  When the refried beans were done cooking and we tasted them they were really excellent but a little something was missing...just a slight important difference from the canned refried beans.  I checked the ingredients on the canned beans and noticed they contained vinegar.  At that point my husband, who can't cooked but knows what appeals to his taste buds said...."ohhh, use a few tablespoons of the vinegar brine from the jarred banana peppers".  Wow...what a great idea...really added a wonderful boost to round out the flavor of an already great recipe.  I then took half the batch of refried beans and added the ingredients suggested by TIGERHAWK to make a batch of bean dip.  Since I was only using half the refried beans I halfed the amounts of suggested added ingredients.  That's another winner.  No need to buy refried beans OR expensive small cans of bean dip again.  Thanks so much to both CHEFCLAUDE for a wonderful recipe AND TIGERHAWK for a really helpful review.

Wow! I served this at a party and folks were in heaven. This recipe was simple and fast to get ready for the party once it had cooked. I made mine with less jalapeno since my daughter can smell spicy and won't eat it. She loved it! Thank you for a fabulous recipe.

Really good flavor, but MAKE SURE TO HALF THE AMOUNT OF SALT!!!  I added more cumin because we like the flavor.  I omitted the jalapeno because none of us like the heat.  The suggestion of green chiles would probably be good.  I did the full amount of salt and had to add some plain black beans and half a pound of browned (unsalted) ground beef to try to save it and it was still super salty, but at least edible if eaten with something else.  I tried some on a corn tortilla with chopped green onion and sour cream; it was really good.  I cooked mine on the stove because I needed it done quickly.  My beans were soaked ahead of time, so they cooked quickly.  I love the slow cooker idea and will try that next... but with way less salt!!

Good, but too salty for my taste, and I even used kosher salt.  Next time I'll use 3 teaspoons.

I cooked mine for 7 hours on high in a relatively new 6 quart cooker, and the doneness was perfect.

Excellent!!! I did follow other reviews and used chicken broth instead of water.  As a preference I used a whole chopped seeded jalapeno, diced the onion and added more garlic.  Skipped salt since I was using chicken broth.  Only thing I wish I had done was after mashing, save the remaining left over broth because beans sometimes dry out in the fridge....I just reheated with any chicken broth I had.

Fantastic recipe.   If you like 'chunkier' beans--just don't mash them much.   I (and most of our guests) prefer beans chunkier.    I've made this recipe numerous times for guests and it always gets rave reviews.   Plus it's healthy and easy.   If you're pressed for time you can do it outside a slow cooker--just do a 'quick soak' of dry beans--pinto, black or whatever type you prefer.   Then cook them on the stove top with the suggested ingredients and enough water to barely cover and suit your tastes.

Wow!  I was a little skeptical it could really be that good w/ absolutely no added fat, but I have to say it was incredible, even though I accidentally mixed up the cumin and the cloves!!  You'd think it'd have been disgusting but it was still good so I can only imagine how perfect they'd be with the right spice.  I don't think I added salt if any, figuring I could always add more later.  I even mixed in some of the leftover bean water w/ some beans to make a great soup.  Excellent.  Will try adding garlic and maybe some New Mexico Hatch Chili next time but I won't look any further.  Was even better than the stove top recipe I made from the Mexican restaurant down the street, and I live in San Diego - home of the best Mexican food!  Thanks for sharing!

These beans are delicious! Much better than from a can with added fat. My family and I have been devouring them in breakfast burritos and lunch/dinner quesadillas. Very easy to make. I will add fewer onions and more peppers next time.

This was my first try at making refried beans and it was a hit with my family. I used a can of green chilies instead of jalapeno and minced the onion. And because I used chicken broth, I didn't add much salt at all. At 7 1/2 hours it wasn't quite done and rather soupy and I was ready to serve dinner, so I transferred it to a cast iron skillet, mashed the beans while it finished cooking down [about 10 minutes.]

I made this multiple times and it always turned out so delicious. This is a simple, quick, and cheap recipe. I don't also have jalapeno, and usually use dry pepper flakes and it still taste great! Also I add lots of cumin--I like spices. It's freezes well too.

So very good.  I used a blender wand instead of mashing them by hand.  This worked very well, for me.  I too, used half the called for salt.  If more is desired it can be added.
With the little that is left over I make up one cup individual containers half rice and half refried beans and freeze them.  These are handy to have on hand to round-out quick, yet tasty, lunches.

These were so good!   Really easy to put together and cooked perfectly in 8 hours.   I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, I used 5 cups low sodium chicken broth and 4 cups water.  Much fresher tasting than what you get out of a can.

So incredibly easy and healthy, I'll probably never buy a can again. I used chicken broth instead of the water/salt mixture others said was too salty, and it gave it nice flavor. Fine without jalapeno for kids that don't like spice.

So yummy! I cut back on the salt and garlic for my taste and diced the onion. Mine were ready to mash in about 6 hours and they turned out perfectly! No more canned! A very good recipe!

These beans were delicious and so easy to make. I have always loved Ducal refried beans and wanted to try to re-create them at home, so I used black beans instead of pintos. I only used 2/3 the amount of water because that was all my slow cooker would hold, and left it on low all day. I didn't drain any of the water before pureeing with my immersion blender. The resulting mixture was a little soupy at first so I mixed some in with some rice and made black bean soup, which was awesome. After sitting in the fridge overnight the leftover mixture thickened up to a perfect consistency. This made A LOT so I put half in the freezer to use later. I did not find them to be too salty and was surprised how good they were with no added fat. I couldn't taste any of the jalapeno so I would recommend using more if you want it to be spicier. I will be making this again!

I no longer eat food from a can...so this recipe using dry pinto beans was exactly what I was looking for. It's amazing how hard it is to find recipes using dried beans. Anyway, I was really happy with this recipe. I've made it a few times now, and sometimes it requires a little more water than others, but you can always dial it right in after mashing. This is my family's go to refried bean recipe now.

This recipe was amazing!  My picky kids even loved it and we will never go back to canned beans again.
I did make a few changes, I used 6 cups of chicken stock and the rest was water.  I added more jalepeno (we like it spicy) and I left them in large chunk so I could take them out and my kids wouldn't complain there was green stuff in their beans!  I also added a little chili powder and some other seasonings to the salt, pepper and cumin.  And I definitely took the advice of so many others and cut the salt in half.  This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!

While these beans had a great consistency, they were lacking in flavor. I used the ingredients and added more cumin and Sazon seasoning. They were still bland. I was disappointed in my results.

Delicious! I cut the cooking time in half by boiling the beans with all the ingredients first. I then placed everything in the crock pot. I also reduced the salt to only 3 tablespoons. I was out of jalapenos so I used ½ can of Rotel (mild green chilies with tomatoes). Once done I refried the beans with a hand blender while still in the crock pot. You may need to take some broth out depending on how creamy you like them. Reminder: check your beans for rocks before rinsing them.

These were fantastic!!!  i read many of the reviews so i changed a few things, but im sure keeping to the original recipe would be just as tasty, and probably a little healthier than what i did :)
i substituted 1 box of low sodium chicken broth (4 cups) for the liquid, and used water for the rest.  i also added about 1/2 a small bag of bacon pieces to give it a little flavor, along with parika (lots) and also some chili powder.  Next time i might cut down on the salt a bit, though the full amount didnt hurt.  I used the full bag of beans which turned out to be 4 cups (not 3)...so i adjusted the spices accordingly.  YUMMO!!!!  i will make these again and again!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Best beans ever! And you can also enjoy the pinto beans with all the delicious juice and call it a soup! I used only 1 T garlic and about 3-4 teaspoons salt to a one pound bag of beans and they were PERFECT!

I like to  use a food processor instead of a hand masher (I broke that) as it's easier. I don't use cumin and use less salt, powdered garlic. Anything you would put in salsa works in refried beans. I make a large batch and put part in a large zip lock bag in the freezer for later use.

GREAT beans!  I made as directed except I used the whole jalapeno because otherwise I would've just thrown it away.  They were a little salty, next time I'll cut down the salt.  But overall, I thought they were super simple and great tasting.

I have never made Refried Beans before and these were so easy, and so yummy I will be making them over and over!  I split the recipe in thirds and froze two.  They defrost and still taste wonderful!

Loved this recipes, very easy.  I used half black beans and half pinto beans.  I soaked them over night to help with the cooking.

i added a hamhock to the crockpot and cooked on low overnight.  hamhock gave a nice smoky flavor (i left out the salt because hocks can be salty).  i will never buy canned refried again, so good!!

Made the house smell good & it wasn't hard at all to do since you use a slow cooker.  I will reduce the pepper though with my next batch.  Oops, I just realized while looking at the recipe that I forgot the alapeno or serano substitute pepper.  Oh well, they still tasted good when sampling.  I did soak the beans overnight so it only took half the time to cook.

I love this recipe.  I do make a few modifications.  Instead of jalapenos (i dont usually buy them) I add an 8oz can of green chiles.  I omit the salt completely and add 2 packets of goya seasoning.  I also add some adobo seasoning.  I freeze servings and use as needed.  I just made them today and decided to chop up bacon fine and add bacon grease to the dish.  Havent tried it yet, but I assume it will be wonderful.  Delish!

Oh my gosh these are good!  Wow, I ate them breakfast, lunch, and dinner and even saved the broth to use for a veggie soup base.  Really outstanding.  I did add several slices of thick cut smoked bacon that I cooked lightly beforehand to the crock pot.  I also used only black beans which I soaked first overnight in the fridge.  Will make this recipe again and again.  In fact, I may make again today.

Delicious! I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and I used the whole jalapeno since I didn't feel like saving 1/2 of one when I knew it would just go bad and end up in the trash. Then I made the bean dip someone posted in the reviews which was also amazing. I'm going to make more of these beans to have with our tacos soon.

Excellent!  Since I didn't have fresh jalapeno on hand, I used pickled jalapenos...worked well and added a little heat.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added less salt than the recipe called for and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

After making it the first time according to recipe, I made a  few changes due to my 3 and 4 yr old not being able to handle spicy foods, the following is what I did to compensate: 1/4 jalapeno seeded, 1/2 tsp cumin, no salt, chicken or vege bullion instead of water, 3 Tbs of garlic, and a pinch of cayenne.

Wonderful!!!  I had a BIG mishap though--my crockpot died midway through cooking so I had to finish this on the stove.  It still turned out great!! I only used 2 teaspoons of salt.  I put the cooked beans in a colander and then added back a little bit of the liquid while mashing.  I also added some kosher salt and mexican blend shredded cheese. My family RAVED about these beans.  I will never buy canned again!

This recipe is delicious, and very easy to make. I have made it several times, and each time it gets compliments. The only modifications I made were to cut the recipe down to 5 servings because of the size of my crockpot and to use 1/2 a jalepeno or serrano, whatever we had on hand, because we like spicy food. I use it as a side dish for burritos at night, and as a filling for bean and cheese burritos the next day for lunch. Great every time.

One of the best refried bean recipes I've found. Super easy!

I love to make these for bean burritos, because it makes so much I can make a huge batch of burritos and freeze them for later.

Full of flavor! I accidentally put in crockpot on Low instead of High for 7 hours. Caught it and bumped up to high for last hour 1/2. Was a bit lumpy, but very good. Next time will put on high the whole time.

I halved the recipe, but still used the whole jalapeno, scraping out the ribs and seeds to control the heat. I also did half pinto, half black bean cuz thats all i had! i added 1tsp of cumin, and decreased the salt. You may need to season after cooking, but i'd rather add later anyways.

They're good, but nothing special. The wait+mashing+cleaning probably isn't worth it. The onion should be chopped, not halved.

Next time I'll use chicken broth instead of water, and add cilantro & lime juice after I take it off the heat.

Enjoyed these!  I only used 3 tsp of salt.  I woul only sub 2 C of water for chicken broth.  Due to the people being served, I did not add jalapenos at all to keep mild.  I cooked for at least 10 hours.  I may have preferred to puree the beans instead of mashed, due to texture, but they were WONDERFUL! :)

The family loved it. I did only put 3 tablespoons of salt, and added more cumin. Other than that it was perfect.

So good and so much better for you than what you get in the cans!!  I used dried pink beans, added 4 chicken bouillon cubes to the 9 cups of water at the start of cooking and used jarred jalapeno rings because that is what I had in the house.  Otherwise, I followed recipe as listed and this made a delicious side dish for fajita night.  If you have the ingredients and the time, this is the way to go with refried beans.

Delicious recipe!  So easy and fool proof.  I added a small can of diced chilis instead of the jalapeno, but only because somehow the jalapenos did not make it in our cart.  Just two of us, so it was a lot, but the beans were great with everything.  Thanks!

I made this recipe in a pressure cooker. It took about 30 minutes. Just throw everything in the pressure cooker (with about 1 inch of water OVER the height of the beans), once the pressure cooker 'needle' goes up, cook for 30 minutes. Let cool. Drain. Throw the cooked bean, onions, etc. into a food processor, add spices to your liking. Next time I'll add more jalepenos as my husband thought it needed more 'kick.' Oh- I also used pinto beans that I soaked overnight in water. FOLLOW UP: Maybe cooking the beans for 8 hours was the way to go... the pressure cooked refried beans will continue to remind you and anyone in your vicinity that you recently ate beans. Toot-toot!!!

I used canned black beans, skipped the jalapeno, salt, and water. I used a submersable blender and hit a few times to thinken the beans. I cooked it for 6 minutes with the garlic, pepper, and cumin.  I used this recipe with the Beef and Bean Chimichangas recipe from this site. Wonderful!

Excellent and so easy! Will never buy canned again.  Didn't have fresh jalapeno so I used canned. Would probably use more garlic next time. Overall, a keeper!

I am never buying canned refried again.  this is great, tasty and better for us!!.  I freeze in bags according to how I might use it, basically, if I were to buy a can, I freeze about 2 cups in a container or freezer bag.  Easy to make up, throw the beans in the crockpot Saturday night.  Make something using them for Sunday Dinner, bag up the rest!!!

I have made this recipe over and over, my family including picky eating boys love it. Use this as a base for burritos, tacos and salads also for a dip. I have used a whole onion and mole jalapeno instead of a green jalapeno since I didn't have a fresh one.  I also add in more garlic since I love garlic.  Everyone raves when I make this and nothing is ever left.  This is so easy to make the night before. I cook on high for 4 hours and than on low for another 6. Only because I start it the evening before and don't mash everything till right before dinner.  A food processor is also great for giving the smoother consistency.

Delicious and easy. I will be making these all the time. I diced the onion, and didn't add the salt til near the end, then only added 3 tsp. Didn't use nearly that amount of black pepper. (Maybe 1/8 tsp). Added 1 Cup chicken broth. Next time I'll add the entire (seeded) jalapeno, diced, rather than just half. I brought the beans/water to a boil on the stove while I got everything else into the crockpot, then poured it in so it wouldn't waste any time getting up to cooking temp. It still needed 9 hours. Next time I'll probably double it or 1.5x it, whatever I can fit in my CP, then put the extra in the freezer.  I served it with (modified) Beefy Spanish Rice from this site, with salsa, sour cream, and tortilla chips. Yummy!!!

This recipe is out of this world! It makes a LOT, though so be prepared! They are good as a dip, on flour tortillas, etc. Excellent recipe, but I add more jalapenos than it calls for- we like them spicy- I also add cheese to the top- wonderful! I alos have added a very hot ghost chile to the pot instead of jalapeno and it;s great! This is one of my all time favorites from this site and I even gave the recipe to my 23 year old son who requested the recipe after he had it at my house. And he is no cook- but he really likes to make this too- as a topper for rice (it;s cheap!),

There were fantastic although a tad salty for my taste.  I was worried that there was too much liquid but once I had mashed the beans they were perfect.  My big blunder was forgetting to wash the beans first!  When I rinsed the rest of the beans from the same bag, they were filthy.  I was so sad to have had to through my yummy refried beans out and start over.

I've been trying to make refried beans that had some flavor, and these really do the job!  I made a couple of small changes:  doubled the jalapeno, and increased the cumin to 1 tsp.   Next time I will decrease the salt by at least a teaspoon, as my family agreed it was too salty for our tastes.  

I made a full batch of this recipe and put away leftovers in the freezer, where they kept very well.  I'll never buy canned refritos again.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Great tasting recipe and easy to make. Only downside: too much salt for us. I'll try 3 tsp salt next time.

I love refried beans and I was excited about the possibility of making a healthy homemade version. THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!!!! Best part, very little work required. I put them in the crock pot overnight and mashed them in the morning, fantastic. New family favorite for sure. Also, they freeze really well!

These are so much better than any canned refried beans even than most Mexican restaurants.  My son loves bean burritos but the whole family loves this.  I use chicken stock, instead of water, that I freeze from boiling roasted chicken off the bones.

Amazing. I am having a hard time putting the spoon down to write this review...these beans are THAT good. I used half black beans, half pinto, and used pickled jalapeno slices (probably the equivalent to a whole pepper) since that was all I had. Instead of salt, i used chicken bouillon, and probably only 2 1/2 tsp. I halved the garlic, since I only had enough for half, but I think I would do it again if I had the choice. Cooked for probably 16 hours on low in my crockpot...so worth the wait!

Delicious! No need to buy store bought when you can make this for a fraction of the price. Good on chips, tacos, burritos, etc. I have even substituted the water for homemade chicken stock. Super Tasty : )

These turned out perfect and were really good!!  Used 3 large cloves of garlic and did it on high as directed (even though I never turn mine on high) and they turned out perfect.  I did end up adding much of the liquid back in after mashing up the beans because they were pretty dry without it, especially after they sit for a bit.  Definitely a keeper!

I love these, so does the whole family!!! I no longer buy canned refried beans, these are sooo easy. I have made these many times now, and I am making them again for my husbands Mexican themed birthday party. The only thing I do is use a whole jalepeno and a bit more cumin.

This recipe is simple, but with a complex flavour that can be used for a large meal, or for a few days for a couple of people (dips, sandwich/wrap spread, breakfast with eggs and toast, etc...).  
I actually change it a little.  I use less than half the salt, because it doesn't need this much, and I add cilantro/coriander spice while it is cooking and some cilantro/coriander leaves when it finishes.  Also, I don't strain the liquid from the beans at the end.  I just stick my hand blender into the slow cooker and blend it altogether.  I love this recipe!

I've made these several times now.  I've learned to soak the beans overnight beforehand.  I also use lots of garlic and a can of rotel with diced chilis while it's cooking, and then 1/2 stick butter (rather than traditional lard) and mozzarella cheese after mashing them.  Love these!!

I've made these about 6-8 times now changing up a little each time.  I add only 1 tsp salt instead of five, then season to taste after their cooked and mashed.  Also, added 2 tsp of chili powder and instead of using just the stock to moisten, I added homemade chicken stock.  Finally, it's perfected!  If using the ingredients to make 15 servings that makes it 1/3 cup per serving, but I consider 1/2 cup a serving so we get 10 servings from this recipe.  Excellent recipe and easy to freeze leftovers!

I cut the salt back to 3 tsp as suggested.  Next time will add a few boulion cubes to the the water.  I will also cut back on the black pepper a little.  It over powers the taste for me..  Good recipe.

I did soak my beans overnight before making them. I only used 8 cups of water at the begining and I still had to drain 2 more cups to make it like a thin soup. We didn't mash them just scooped them in a bowl topped with cheese and sour cream and ate them like that. It was delish!

I ought to write a good review since I have been making this recipe every other week. When this bean is done, I am ready for several meals; burrito, bean dip, quesadilla. I always have garlic and jalapeno pepper all chopped and minced in individual bags in the freezer. I would like to put 1C black beans & 2C pinto beans. 1/2t cumin.
I don't  strain them, but scoop out the liquid. And mash the beans in the crock pot. I LOVE THESE BEANS! Super cheap and excellent taste. Thank you for sharing! 
Update 7/26/15 
Improved, simplified version (if using the pressure cooker, 5-6 cups water, set for 55 minutes) 
2 cups pinto /1cup black beans 
7-8 cups water 
1 onion, cut in half
3tsp sea salt 
1tsp cumin
1 1/2 black pepper 
Handful whole garlic
1 whole jalapeño with a slit on the side
After done cooking, take out onion & jalapeño, drain juice and add enough green enchilada sauce (1cup) and mesh. Add chicken piece cooked in olive oil and garlic. Now, it's bean dip and much more.

I made this as written (except halved it) and it turned out great. I drained the liquid after cooking but ended up putting it all back in after mashing. It turned out to be just the right amount of liquid. A great healthy recipe. As good as any "re-fried" beans that I've ever had. I forgot to mention that these were a little on the salty side and I had already cut back a little on the salt when I made them, so, I would cut the salt to half the amount next time. You can always add more later.

Excellent flavor and so easy.  I used my submersible blender in lieu of mashing by hand.  I shared the recipe with my daughter, who is a busy mother of three and she was blown away.  We have both sworn off canned refried beans forever.  Thanks ChefClaude!!

Perfect! I always wondered why the canned beans are so sticky *lol* No lard in my fresh made refried beans! Since refried beans are not very common here in germany I don't have a big choice in our stores. To be exact only one. I found dried Pinto beans in a store in my home town and thought, I am a good cook and why not try to make refried beans fresh. Then I found this recipe.  The puree is so creamy! I didn't use cumin and jalepno's but I guess the spices are optional to personal taste. 
I soaked one german pound (500 grams) of pinto beans in water for about 15 hours, be shure to use a big bowl, they will at least triple their amount while soaking. Then I cooked them with the other ingredients for about 3 hours. Mashed them with a potato masher and seasoned it to my personal taste. It will be plenty and I have some left to freeze for our next burrito dinner. Five stars, thanks for this fabulous recipe.

I'm Mexican-American and loved this recipe. That is how my grandma made it, refried without oil, just in its own natural juices, yum! I added less salt. I am making this again for second time this week, and am going to experiment and add oxtails, to make it a one-pot supper. Topped with fresh salsa and cheese, it has all 4 food groups!

I make this all the time! Yes, cut down on the salt, but I make this with all kinds of beans, especially black beans. You can mash these for refried beans, or leave them whole for frijoles.    For extra kick, I even pour some juice from the jalapeno jar in it. WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

I didn't end up using the jalapenos or the ground cumin... I did however add in 1 can of chicken broth to give the beans a little flavor & my kids loved the beans! Put the beans in a tortilla & cheddar cheese... it was an instant hit. So easy to prepare & make! I'll definitely make this again!

This was so easy and tasty...gives me enough to make a batch of bean/cheese/rice burritos and freeze them for lunches later in the week.  I added salt at the end of cooking, and used the food processor to make them creamy - left in the onion too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I like this bean recipe very much: easy and healthy. I used to make my mother's bean recipe, then tried several other recipes on this site, and this is my favorite now. The beans don't take 8 hours on high to cook in my slow cooker, so adjust your cooking time accordingly. You can easily spice up the beans according to your family's preferences, and I don't bother mashing them. Superior to those nasty canned refried beans!

Very good beans. I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I cut back the salt and pepper. Did add some chili powder as my jalapeno was a bit on the mild side. I never realized how easy it was to make refried beans. I will keep a can in the pantry for emergencies but this will be the go to recipe for me now. I would like to try it with chicken broth next time.

This has become a staple in our home! Half of the salt is enough. I divide each huge batch into meal-sized portions for our family and freeze them for use in Mexican dishes throughout the month.

this was very easy, recipe which is why I am giving it 3 stars. But I  just did not like the flavors. The beans tasted just like beans out of a can and that is not a compliment to me. I am thinking that it was the onion, so next time I am going to try this with out onion. When I cook beans the slow way I just simple cook the beans with salt pork or bacon and then refried them in bacon fat or oil and those are the only flavors we need. But I will try them again

We love these....I can never buy canned refried beans again, and my husband wants these to always be in the fridge.  I have made some changes to better suit our personal tastes, but would still rate this 5 stars based on the basic recipe.

These were the best refried beans ever.  The first time I made them was for Christmas dinner of enchiladas and tamales and everyone raved about them.  I have made them several times since then, as they are so easy to make.  I followed the recipe as is, and it was perfect, but the last time I lowered the salt to 3 tsp. and it was just as good.  Thank you for the recipe!

I agree with all the other reviewers. 5tsp salt is way too much. Try halving it. I also added a piece of kombu seaweed for flavor and digestibility. At the end, I mashed it with about 1/4 C pastured pork lard. Muy delicioso!

I've making my refried beans like this since 1970. I had one of my Firefighters, who was of Mexican decent show me  how to do this. His Mother taught him the recipe.  And unless I'm in a big hurry that's how I still make my beans, refried or otherwise .

These were really as fabulous as everyone says. Read the reviews, some minor changes may be necessary based on your tastes. I don't like too heavy of an onion taste and want my kids to eat them. So I used 1/2 an onion, but it was large....and I I used 3 tsp salt. I figured that was safe as I also used a couple cups chicken broth instead of water. Next time I would back off on the pepper a bit too. But the recipe was sooooo easy and I put the beans in my food processor with a little of the broth and it made the BEST refried beans I have ever had. And it was just too easy to ever buy refried beans again.

Wow, this delicious. I chose to leave out the jalapeno pepper for the sake of my stomach, and only used 2 teaspoons of salt - which was plenty. Why would I ever use canned stuff when this is so much better??

Very easy, good recipe.  Used less salt and omitted the jalapeno to suit our tastes.  Used an immersion blender to mash the beans which worked great.

I've reviewed this before back in 2013, but I just want to reiterate how awesome this recipe is.
A number of times I've forgotten to write it down and still managed to get awesome beans every time. You can also not mash them and have amazing pintos, which my Mexican in-laws absolutely love.

Just remember the 3:9 ratio of beans:water, and then salt, garlic, onion, cumin. Last batch I added 4 jalapenos going bad (with seeds), and thought it'd be super spicy. It had a little kick but oh man, those flavors!

This is a great recipe.  There is too much salt and pepper for my taste.  I have tried with water and chicken broth, and they are both good. I leave out the salt and pepper and season to taste after cooking.

I've been making these for about 2 years now, but forgot to write the review, sorry!  These are the greatest refried beans ever!!!  I have made many of the recipes suggested by other reviews using the basic recipe.  We also just eat them without mashing as a meal with fried potatoes, cornbread and chopped onions.  The flavor can't be beat!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made them the first time original, they were good but tweaked them a little. I used 4 cups of chicken broth as part of my 9 cups, and I cut the salt to 3 tsp. I did fry up half a package of bacon, finely chopping bacon and reserving pan drippings. After mashing I poured bean mixture in bacon fat and simmered for aobut 5 minutes, adding bacon when done.  This recipe rocks!!!!  I make it all the time with tacos and burritos and rarely is there any left. I am getting ready to mash some beans up as I type, and man they smell delicous! Just freeze up your leftovers or calculate different servings to your family size.

I wasn't crazy about these beans.  It says that cumin is optional and I put it in there.  All I could taste was the cumin.  If I ever make these again, I will leave out the cumin.  Hopefully they will be better that way.

These were exceptional! I added NO salt (my grandma told me beans get tough if you salt them before they are tender), but seasoned at the end of the cooking. I had leftovers so I dehydrated them and put the dried flakes in plastic bags for future use. TADA..instant non-fried refried beans!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. Made as is following the seasonings and flavorings but omitting the optional cumin, I find them too peppery and salty. On my 3rd attempt, I did the same but reduced the salt to 3.5 tsp and the pepper to 1 and 1/4 tsp. I think, next time around I might further reduce each 1/4 of a teaspoon. My crock-pot can only fit 6 cups of water, so 1 1/2-2 hours later I add an additional 1 1/2 cups of water as some evaporates off. It doesn't need the full 9 cups. The beans are better than any I have eaten at a restaurant. I like their homemade quality. They are good on a quality tortilla with a little sour cream, cheese, and hot sauce. They work well in any recipe calling for refried beans. I have also put extras in the freezer and it works well too, from freezer to microwave. ty

Simply delicious. Start with less salt (2.5 tsp) and add remaining incrementally to taste. Also, mix beans them in the food processor for a creamier texture. YUM!

This was my first time making refried beans and I do not need to search anymore!  Made this last night to go with the Slow Cooker Carnitas I was making.  The entire family loved them.  I only had beef broth so I used some of that and I did it on the stovetop since my slow cooker was already in use but I will be using the slow cooker the next time I make this

What a delicious, cheap, and healthy recipe!  You can make a pot of this for easily less than $5 and eat it all week with some melted cheese and salsa.  I recommend this to all my friends cooking on a budget and get requests from coworkers for it constantly.

I over-cooked a huge batch of pinto beans, so I came to this website to find a recipe for refried beans. I added all the ingredients after the beans were cooked and it still came out pretty tasty and creamy.  I used dried onion flakes instead of fresh because everything was basically already cooked and my kids don't like the taste of raw onion. Super easy.

A little salty so I'll hold back a little next time, but love it as is. Easy to do and not a lot of work, which is a huge plus! I just threw out what was left of the onion after it was done cooking. I will NEVER buy canned refried beans again.

My family loves this recipe, I can control the texture of the beans and give them so much more flavor than canned!  Chicken broth makes a huge difference and the beans freeze well.

Delicious! I had planned on making this today to last through the week, and then this morning realized I didn't have pintos in the pantry. No worries, I had a bag of black beans, and wow they turned out great! I'm looking forward to having them in burritos this coming week. The only thing I added was one chili pepper in adobo sauce (smoked jalapeno in sauce) to give it some kick -- but only because I had them in the fridge anyway. Without it, they would be great anyway.

Great recipe!  I used half the salt listed and used some sliced pickled jalapeno peppers but those were the only changes made.  I should have drained off some of the liquid before using the immersion blender as the beans are a little runnier that I would have liked for my burritos.  I used a third of the recipe for the 4 burritos I made and I have 2 more casserole dishes in the freezer for next time.

I had to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. These are the best refried beans ever, and the easiest to make. I've made them with canned diced jalapeno and fresh and didn't notice any difference, added some cooked bacon with grease once, but didn't think about it until near the end of cooking time and it didn't add much flavor. I'll try again but add at the beginning.

Yummy, yummy, pretty darn good. Great taste, a little dry when you are used to canned refried beans, but have loads of flavor!

I used peruano beans instead of pinto beans, without the jalapeno ( I don't like spicy foods) and I added the salt at the end when the beans were done cooking, before straining them.

I did not have pinto beans on hand so I substituted pink beans. I also did not have the Jalapeno Pepper so I substituted a whole Anaheim Pepper instead. I also reduce salt to 2 tsps.  We had a Cinco de Mayo celebration and the beans were a bit hit!  The house smelled wonderful all day as the beans were cooking. So easy and so delicious and so much more healthy!  Thanks!

A few changes and it flies off the table! I didn't use as much salt as this called for and I thought it was too salty before I added some of the extra stuff that I did. First off, I like spicy, so I used a whole jalapeño and one and half onions. I cooked them more than the recipe says too. Then I drained the liquid, put a little in, and mixed the beans with my hand mixer - SO much easier than mashing that many beans with a potato masher! Then I added a tbsp of butter, two splashes of milk and a lot of "mexican blend" cheese and mixed it together. I also added a little mild salsa. I didn't want any more heat, just a little more salsa-y flavor. It turned out so creamy and delicious. I took it to a potluck taco bar and it was the first thing gone. Yum!

Following the recipe exactly will give you a wonderful pot of beans!  I will reduce the amount of salt, however, next time I make them.  Five teaspoons was just too much for me; I'll start with two teaspoons next batch. UPDATE: That was yesterday.  I pitched that batch and made another with 2 tsp kosher salt, and think they came out perfect.  Used about 3-1/2 cups beans the 2nd batch (end of the bag).

Fantastic frijoles refritos.  I didn't have a jalapeño on hand so I added in an extra can of green chiles.  I also added in a dash of peanut oil during the mash/immersion blend, but only about 2 tbsp for the initial 2 lbs of dried beans I used.  This was a great party hit, and super easy.

I make this recipes atleast twice a month. I do a few things differnt. First I add a whole jalapeno and half an onion. Also I use a creole seasoning(Tony Chachere's) instead of the salt, pepper, and cumin. I also add 3 cubes of chicken broth. If you want to make these salt free this seasoning comes in salt free. I love these whole instead of mashed. I will never buy pinto beans or refired again. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I just made these and they turned out great! The only thing I changed was that I stopped at 3 teaspoons of salt because five seemed a little much, and I put in more jalapenos because the ones I had weren't very strong. I also didn't have cumin, so I added chili pepper instead. Fantastic!

This is a great recipe for what it is - a healthier version of refried beans.  Of my family of 4, 2 of us like it, 2 don't.   I think it is worthwhile to keep in my rotation as it is so much better than canned beans, and I don't want to make the high-fat lard-laden version.

Pretty good beans recipe.  I added a ton of cumin and lessened the amount of salt.  I cooked the beans for about 5 hours on High setting.

Outstanding! The flavor was just out of this world.  I halved the recipe and only used about 1 teaspoon of salt and that was plenty for us. Also used half chicken broth and half water. Thank you so much! I will use this recipe again and again. :)

Really good recipe! I made a few changes and they turned out great. My aunt is Mexican so I did how she does and added 2 strips of bacon and a bay leaf (remove both when draining).  Cut the salt down to 4 tsp.  Also added a handful of shredded cheese at the end just before serving.  MUY BUENO!

These bean were great, I didn't drain them fully before I mashed them so i ended up with a bit too much liquid that i had to strain out later.  Next time i will fully drain them before mashing!

I added everything (except jalapeños) AFTER the beans were drained.  The amount of salt is too much for this method, but overall delicious. I finely chopped the onions.  My many guests loved it.  This is the bean recipe for me.  A little Turmeric adds a nice flavor too.

These were so good!  The only change based on other reviews, is I decreased the salt.  We made bean & cheese burritos.  These are so healthy and better than the can! I did not have to add any extra water after cooking.   I did feel something was missing, maybe more Jalepeno, chilli powder, more cumin?  Either way I can experment a little next time, but will stick to this basic recipe adding spices to our taste!

Mmmm... tasty!!! Tonight's dinner was Mexican-themed - Picante Chicken Rice Burritos (IDIEHMARIE77), chips, pico de gallo and mojitos. I like refried beans, but never make them since my fiance isn't a fan. I've had this recipe on my "to try" list for some time now (in the event that I hosted a Mexican-themed party), but because I had a taste for beans NOW, I decided to give this a "test run." My fiance is gone on business this coming week, so I see lots of uses for leftovers in my near future! I pretty much followed CHEFCLAUDE's directions to the letter with the exception of a few changes. My modifications were: a) substituting chicken broth for water and 4 oz. can of diced green chilies for a fresh jalapeno, b) reducing salt by half and c) adding two slices of smoked bacon (which took this over the top, IMHO). I cooked everything on HIGH for 8 hours as directed with excellent results! I found that I only needed to add about 3/4 cup's worth of liquid (saved remaining liquid in a separate container as suggested by others) for my beans to reach a creamy consistency. I didn't miss the "refry," especially since I added bacon (which lent a subtle, yet delicious smokiness). One thing to note: Most of my onion and bacon dissolved completely, so don’t worry about “chunks.” I will definitely be making these again, even if my fiance doesn't like them. Just look what he's missing lol! Thanks for sharing, Claude. :-)

These were good, but I thought they could have used more flavor. Maybe the addition of some cooked bacon w/ the fat. Didn't make these in a slow cooker, made them on the stove top. I'd make them again w/ some more flavorings.

Wow!  This really worked, and you truly don't have top soak the beans.  My house smelled like a Mexican restaurant!  This one is a keeper for those occasions when you can't be home to cook beans all day.

WOW! These are amazing! Super simple, flavor full, and fat-free. I only mashed some, and have been eating the beans mixed with rice for lunch this week. SO good! Oh, and the onion looked like a lot, but it actually disolves into the beans. If you like beans, MAKE THIS RECIPE!!

Put this in the slow cooker last night, and it wasn't quite done this morning. My slow cooker is really old and has two settings: super hot and barely warm. I went with the latter. Anyway, the beans weren't cooked enough to be mashed, but were cooked enough to pack with some rice for lunch and oh my gosh are they good! Don't omit the cumin! That's what makes it for me.

I gave it 4 because I made a couple of changes. I don't like jalapeno so i didn't add it. And I was out of cumin so i didn't add it. Instead of those 2 things I added 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons chili powder.  Next time I will dice my onion up becasue I didn't want to mash up just cut in half. As recommended by other reviewrs i used 1/2 black beans and 1/2 pinto beans. But this recipe was very easy and very tasty. My whole family loved them I will make them again and again. Thank you.

If I could give this recipe, 4.5 stars I would.  Prepared as is, this recipe is much to salty for me.  Beans definitely need salt to bring out their flavor, but this was just too much.  I continue to use this recipe all the time, but I just add a small amount of salt while cooking and then add it to taste at the end.  I also use this to make refried black beans.  Very yummy!

my sister and I are the only ones who eats refried beans.  So what we do is measure out how much we use and freeze them in little containers.  We have taco night.

These beans are just great.  I had a couple of bags of pinto beans and had no idea what to do with them so I tried this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  We ate some and I froze the rest in pint containers and they are perfect anytime they are needed.

So easy! I made these to go along with a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada recipe from this site. I was afraid to use all 5 teaspoons of salt, so I only used 4.5, but I did end up having to add a little more to taste at the end, so I'm thinking 5 would've been right on. I didn't have to add any extra water during the cooking process.   Tasty, healthy alternative to the fat-laden refried beans you'd get at a restaurant. I'd make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I've made this recipe a few times now.  The only change I make is to decrease the amount of salt.  I usually decrease the recipe since it's only two of us, but I may make a full batch next time and freeze the leftovers.

Don't forget to cut back on the salt!  First time I made it, I added can of Rotel and did not use jalapeno.  Could go for about 2.5-3 teaspoons of salt.

I have made this recipe many times.  It is so easy.  I do not add all of the salt that it calls for and I have tried many of the variations suggested in other reviews.  It always comes out well and I have shared the recipe with many people.  I freeze most of it in cup-size containers and use it to make breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs, sour cream, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese wrapped in flour tortillas.  I have the tortillas divided in small packages in the freezer and can make these with very little notice using the microwave to thaw out the frozen items.  Be careful to thaw the tortillas at a very low setting so they do not become tough.

This was a great recipe and was loved by all.  I cooked in a pressure cooker and shortened the cook time to 25 minutes.... that wasn't quite long enough so I will make again increasing the time to 30 minutes.

I love this recipe!  Everyone looks forward to me bringing a 7 layer dip to functions, and when I tell people that the beans are homemade, everyone asks for the recipe.  I would agree with other reviews that if you use chicken broth instead of water, to lower the amount of salt.

I could not believe how much they are charging for a can of refried beans. I was at the store and said - that's it, and googled a recipe which led me here.  The family loved it.

Yum!  I made this recipe just as written, except I did not have any jalapeno.  I used a couple of chipotle peppers instead. It gave the beans a delicious smoky flavor.

My family enjoyed this recipe! I have a 2 year old and decided to not add the jalapeno...too spicy. Also I do suggest only adding 1 tea. salt to the slow cooker, then once the beans are done add the salt to your liking. I thought 5 tea. of salt is way too much for this recipe. Other than that this turned out to be great in burritos. I added chopped tomatoes, chopped avacado, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sala! Yummy!

Easy, great flavor, makes a lot.  The leftovers seemed quite a bit drier, so saving some of the liquid to add back would be necessary.

These are definitely delicious!!  However, I agree with the other reviews that it is a little salty.  I would take it down to at least 3 tsp...other than that, it is really delicious.  :-)

We've used this recipe so many times I had to come back and give it a 5 star rating.  You'll never want to buy a can of refried beans again!  We like to add a little chicken base and chili powder to the recipe.  I also add at least 2 jalapenos or a serano pepper.  It's not too hot, just adds a little more kick.

Great recipe that's easy and authentic!  I made this for a party to go with my home made enchiladas.  It was a huge hit and there were no left-overs.  I'll try with black beans or a combo of black and pinto next time like others have suggested.

If I could give these 6 stars I would.  I made this exactly as stated in the recipe with the exception of only mashing about half of them (they were great both whole or mashed).  My boyfriend said they were better than his grama's, which is a huge compliment beacause she's a great cook.  This is my new go to recipe for dried beans.  I can't wait to make them and serve them whole with some homemade cornbread.

I found this to be very very good. Healthy. Read the label on refried beans and you will be happy to make your own the way you want too. Any recipe can be altered but not a can of something. You can use any kind of dry beans that you want. Black beans turn out just as good if not better. God Loves!!!

Phenominal! Great taste, better than most restaurants. I don't know why everyone doesn't make them like this. :-) I did add a chicken boullion cube with the water (just one) to give it an extra punch.

These were as good as the beans we had on the snorkel trip in Cabo.  They were wonderful and soooo easy.    Definitely stick to 3 tsp of salt.

We absolutely love this recipe and made it a permanent addition to our personal cookbook. I chose it for two reasons. One was the fact the beans are not actually fried (loved that) and it called for no lard or added fat. Secondly, it was the ease and no fuss to making refried beans, other then the little time it takes in mashing them once they’re finished.    I did tweak the recipe slightly but without compromising the recipe I believe.   I cut the salt back to 2 ½ Tsp. of coarse sea salt and I used a whole jalapeño with the seeds. The other tweak I did was I used our Magic Bullet to pulverize several fresh garlic cloves (maybe 5 or 6 cloves), the onion and whole jalapeño with a little water added. I then stirred that into the beans and added the water required in the recipe. The permeation of those ingredients in that state of pulverization I feel gave the beans an outstanding, permeated flavor.  The leftover liquid (which ended up to be approx. 1 ½ quarts) after slow cooking for the designated cooking time, was used to make soup. Using a whole jalapeño rather then ½ a jalapeño seeded, obviously kicked up the heat and make the soup’s heat index quite hot. We have a fair tolerance to the pepper’s heat so we were good with it. It was actually the soup that held the heat and I suspect it was because of pulverizing the added ingredients, while the beans were able to balance the heat of the whole jalapeño.

Loved this recipe without changing a thing. We have used this recipe for the entree and not mashing the beans. Family loves the taste.

The best refried beans I have ever had in my life!  And I'm not the best cook, but hands down these are the best.  I skipped the jalapeno as my 8 year old with autism is a huge refried bean lover and I was fearful that he wouldn't eat them if they were too spicy.  They were delicious and will definitely be a staple in our house.  Thank you!!!!

These are the BEST!  They also freeze well...we place them in quart size ziploc for 1-2 serving size.  We have them as a side dish with cheese and chopped sweet onion on top or use as a spread on a burrito with all the other condiments.

This was an easy recipe and reserving the liquid I thought was the key other wise mine would have been too thick. Thanks for sharing.

LOVED it. Couldnt even tell the difference between the traditional refried beans that is actually fried in oil. I will continue to make it like this from now on.

Great recipe.  I left out the pepper because I'm not really into spicey food and wished I had.  Now matter, now I just add in the spice and stir.  Thanks!

THese are fantastic beans. I did decrease the salt and left out the jalapeno due to preferences at our house. I was amazed at how easily they mashed up...including the onion. I think next time, again due to preferences, I'm going to increase the garlic and maybe increase the salt just a bit (I had used the 2 tsp others had recommended). I love that these beans are so much more cost effective than canned refried beans. And they couldn't be any simpler. Thanks for the recipe, Chef Claude! Our burritos were fantastic (and our nachos will be great tomorrow)! ;)

I've changed my eating habits big time, and need beans, and I love refried beans. I couldn't find anything at the store that is low enough in sodium. Obviously, for my own reasons, I didn't use nearly as much sodium as the recipe suggests. But YAY for having beans I love, that are even cheaper than the store brand beans!

I was tired of buying the salty canned beans from the store so I tried this recipe. OUTSTANDING and I can customize it just how I want it.  I eliminated all the salt and used 4 cups of light chicken broth, which added a tad of sodium. I also left out the onion (don't like them much) and added tons of fresh garlic (whole cloves) and, (the best part, I think) rosemary. When eaten with some Tabasco sauce, it adds just enough salt.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

VERY yummy and easy to make recipe!  Served 9 people with leftovers and all raved about it.  I used 2 cups chicken broth, then 7 cups of water and added the cumin. Thanks to other reviews I only used 3 tbsp. salt and added some Mexican blend cheese into the final product. I will never eat canned refried beans again!

Awesome!  I will make these many times in the future.  Following others advice, I used 6 c. of chicken broth and 3 c. of water for the liquid.  Since the broth would increase the salt taste, I only put in 2 T of salt.  Next time I would increase jalapeno to 1 full jalapeno w/ some seeds for a bit more spice.  I also did not need any of the leftover juices once mine were mashed.

These were really great!  This was the first time that I have made beans from scratch and it was super easy.  Love how I can mash to the consistency that I like.  I didn't have any fresh jalapenos so I added a half of a can of green chiles.  We had a lot of leftovers because only two of us but I have froze the other half and can't wait to defrost.

I used a pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker and the beans are delicious! Great recipe and much healthier than the canned refried beans. I will never buy a can of refried beans again.

Firstly, I gave this 5 stars because despite the problems I had...it turned out and tasted great. I had to double the recipe for a party I was having...it made A LOT. I could not use a slow cooker due to lack of room so I used a roaster on 250 degrees (the temp high would be if in a slow cooker). At 8 hours the beans were far from done. At 13 hours they were just starting to soften. I shut the heat off and let them sit overnight. I never made anything with pinto beans before so I was unsure how soft they would be when done, so the next morning I assumed they were. After mashing them they were SOOOO grainy! I put the heat back on, added about half the juice reserved. About 2 hours later they were great. My husband swore something was missing, so we added some homeade taco seasoning...even better. I am going to try this again but in a slow cooker and half the amount of this recipe as we can not eat that many beans.

Oh these are sooooo good! We fry up corn tortillas in vegetable oil in a cast iron pot for tostadas and use these refried beans on it. Then layer it with hamburger meat, etc. I used to buy El Paso brand refried beans for almost $2 a can. We make double the amount of the recipe for lunch the next day so I was having to buy 2 of the cans which ended up costing me $4 just for beans. No more! I just put the beans in the crock pot in the morning and by 4pm they are done! Never buy refried beans again!

I was nervous about adding the salt in at the beginning (might make beans tough), so I added it about halfway through the cooking and I used veggie boulion cubes instead.  I added a couple drops of liquid smoke as well.  These were delicious!  I scooped out some liquid at the end and then pureed with my immersion blender and ate more as a soup with rice.  I did not add as much black pepper as the recipes calls for.  Just did a couple grinds from my pepper grinder.

This is the best refried bean recipe I think I've EVER made. I made these to make the Hot Bean Dip on this site and boy was it a hit! I really believe these beans are why. I would definitely recommend then hey, make the dip with them. You will get nothing but praise for your effort. I promise!

Okay...so I started the slow cooker last night before bed and woke up to a great smell wafting up to my bedroom! I used 6 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water and added NO salt until this morning when I mashed them with my stick blender (still in the crock pot). UNBELIEVEABLY GOOD...No need for my cereal...I've already had my breakfast!  I keep going back for another spoonful and really have to stop so that there will be plenty for my party tonight!

I've made this several times.  It is so easy and good.  I don't worry about chopping up the onion or pepper.  I just quarter the onion and seed the pepper.  Then I throw them in and they get chopped up in the end.  I also don't put as much salt as recommended.  It's just too salty that way.  But I at least double the cumin.  We love that taste.  I use my Oster hand blender to chop the beans after they are done cooking.  I would guess that I remove about 2 cups of water from the beans before chopping them.  I normally make a double batch and have extra burritos for left overs.

I know this recipe has high stars, but my husband, friends, and I did not care for it. They were a bit too bland and we the consistency was strange. I followed the recipe to the 'T' and it sure smelled good, but the taste was disappointing.

Awesome and easy.  I got all the stuff out to make and realized I didn't have a jalapeno pepper.  So I threw in some chopped orange pepper I had on hand and some chili powder.  I also used two cans of chicken broth for some of the water.  This was fabulous and I will definately make again....with the jalapeno!  Thank you for sharing.

These were so easy to make and so good.  Hubby and I thought they are better than the store bought.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were done perfectly after 8 hours in the slow cooker.  I made them a day ahead, mashed them and saved some of the liquid for reheating before serving.  The flavors of the onion, garlic and jalapeno really came together from sitting overnight.  I will make these again.

These refried beans were wonderful! I didn't have any jalapeno peppers, so I stirred some chili powder into the finished beans instead. This recipe also calls for way to much salt. I cut the amount in half (2 1/2 tsp.) and they tasted great! This is such a wonderful and easy recipe!

Super easy and way better/cheaper than canned refried beans. I cut the recipe in half but still used the whole jalapeno and it still wasn't spicy, so don't be afraid.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't use jalepeno, but did use red pepper flakes to add some heat.  This tastes so much better than canned refried beans and is painfully easy - I don't think I'll ever go back to canned refried beans.  Update - just made this, using about 2/3 chicken stock and 1/3 water.  Makes a BIG difference!

These were great! Made as written except I added 1 whole pepper with seeds and reduced the salt to 3 teaspoons as recommended by others. I cooked these on the stove for about 3 hours. After mashing and tasting, I had to add salt.I think the 5 teaspoons would have been right for us. I use coarse Kosher salt and that might make a difference. The beans made some wonderful tostadas for my husbands birthday. This is how I will make my beans from now on! Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have onions or jalapenos (or any peppers for that matter), but I did have green enchilada sauce, and I added about 1 cup of the sauce. It added just the right kick. It was great.

I have made these beans over and over again and they are the best and easiest bean I have ever made. I always make sure that I have some prepared ahead and in the freezer. Perfect the way they are or add more spice if you like either way you won't be disappointed.

I'm giving this recipe only a 3, because I feel like there's a taste missing from it.  I don't know if it's the lack of fat, or because it is quite bland re: seasoning.  I'm glad I adjusted the servings by a third, because I think I'd be disappointed to have so many bland leftovers.  It's not that the recipe is bad, but it is boring.  I used fresh pinto beans, cooked on the stovetop for 3+ hrs on low heat, added 3 de-seeded jalapenos, used half "no chicken" (vegetarian chicken flavored) stock, doubled the cumin, added oregano, bay leaves & chili powder, added extra garlic, decreased the salt as suggested, but still the flavor wasn't "there."  I even added fake bacon bits at the end, to give it more depth of flavor.  I think I'm going to make this again and, like, quadruple the spices and throw in a green pepper, a few Thai bird chilis or a serrano, and add some corn or vegetable oil to see if that punches up the flavor.  To use up my leftovers, I'm going to toss in a can of Rotel and some shredded cheddar or pepper jack and make a dip, and then make some bean and cheese enchiladas with the rest.

Wow... I can't believe how easy and healthy this is! I cut back on the salt initially to 3 tsp as others suggested, but then found that I wanted to add a little bit back after I had put the beans through the food processor. Also, added chile powder, the other 1/2 of the jalapeno, and more cumin as others suggested. Appreciated the other reviews that pointed out it will cook just as well on high heat in 4 - 4.5 hours... just make sure you stir it occassionally. It does make quite a bit, so I froze 1/2 of the batch with extra liquid on top as others recommended. You can also freeze the leftover broth to add back later as needed. Very yummy and I'm so happy it's as healthy as it is! Will make this often! Thanks for the recipe!

These were the best beans ever!  The only thing I did differently was I did not mash all of the beans, so there was some texture to them.

What an easy and inexpensive way to make your own refried beans-and low fat to boot. We like lots more cumin and garlic. I never have a fresh jalapeno handy but pickled jalapenos work just as well. I've also used half black beans a few times. Awesome recipe!

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because it was bland.  It is a good basic recipe but we have to add extra jalapenos, garlic, spices (pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, etc) and onion. Edited to add that the last time I made them I used an entire unseeded jalapeno and we all enjoyed them much better.

Great recipe!! I never use dry beans because they take too much time and effort to make, but making them in the slow cooker with this method is amazing!!!  Used black beans instead of pinto and took advice of others and substituted chicken stock for the water therefore I added no extra salt.  Other than that, followed recipe and these turned out soooo great!! Yumm yumm yumm and so easy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I doubled this recipe, but only used about 14 cups of water.  It was still a bit soupy when the 8 hours were up, so I took the lid off the crockpot and cooked the beans on high for a couple more hours, stirring occasionally.  They turned out WONDERFULLY.    I took them to a potluck dinner and served them topped with enchilada sauce (Enchilada Sauce II on allrecipes) and shredded cheddar cheese.  There were at least 4 other refried bean dishes at this potluck, and from what I could tell, this is the one that disappeared first.    Delicious!

I really liked this recipe- although I made some changes. I used 2 upsc pinto beans and 1 cup red beans, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp salt and 4 chicken buillon cubes in water (4 cups) + 5 cups water. I also added 1 tsp cumin and some red pepper flakes and some chili powder. They came out tasting a lot like Old El Paso refried beans, only with more of a kick. I am definitely going to start making my own from now on. It seems more healthy, organic- and flavorful that way!

I used crushed red pepper instead of jalapeno, and it was great.  I would use a blender if you don't have a potato masher.

I had alot of pinto beans and wanted to find a good recipe for them. This is the one. I used my own chicken stock and the flavor was phenomanal. Thanks to TIGERHAWK's suggestion for bean dip. Made the bean dip for a baby shower and it was a hit. We have been eating bean burritos for two days now. Am making another batch today.

Wonderful beans! Big hit for everyone. I used a whole jalapeno, more cumin and garlic. Also used chicken broth instead of water. I added a little extra of the juices when mashing because I knew they would dry out. Seemed watery when I was finished but by the time I got to the party I was going, they were perfect. Served with grated cotija cheese and green onions. Oh, I also took the advice of another and froze some with a bit of the juice on top. Works great. It is so much cheaper than buying it canned and can store it in whatever portion size needed. There's only two of us and a whole can is too much so this is wonderful.

By far one of the best tasting refried beans I have ever ate...and I LOVE refried beans.  Whenever I go to restaurants I would feel guilty eating them because of the content of lard and cheese they have.  This recipe makes the bean taste like the ones with the lard and cheese without the guilt.  For that cheesy texture I added more liquid in the end.  BEST BEANS ever, thanks Claude

I still don't know what refried beans are but all I know is that this was one bloody salty recipe.  I cut down the salt to 3 teaspoons and it was still dead salty.  I mashed the beans (by the way I used two cups kidney beans and one cup black beans since I didn't have pinto) with about 3/4 cup tomato sauce, added enough tabasco sauce to give it some zing, and it was very good served with whole wheat tortillas.  Oh yes, and I cooked only about 5 hours, it was good enough since I mashed them anyway.  A smart way to make beans - way cheaper than bought in cans at the store!

Great flavor to the beans. As a Mexican we eat a lot of beans. I always wondered how to make them in the slow cooker but never quite got them to turn out right. Thank you for a new way to cook our beans. I no longer have to worry about them burning when I have to leave the house while they are cooking.

Despite the reviews, I must admit I was a little skeptical.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  These were easy and fantastic.  Picky hubby even agreed. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and made a few changes.  I used 1/2 pinto and 1/2 black beans, I left out the japalenos since we aren't fans, I used 4 cups chickens broth and 5 cups water so I used only 1 tsp. of salt and I also added approx. 1 tsp. of sugar and some chili powder too.  I also used a hand mixer to get them nice and creamy.  This good and this easy, I will definitely be making again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Who knew you could make refried beans without the lard? I didn't have jalapenos, so I threw in a 1/2 can of diced chiles instead. (4oz can)  This is how I will be making my frijoles from now on.

These were delicious. I used less salt, a couple of chicken bouillon cubes, and as another reviewer suggested 1 tablespoon of sugar and chili powder.  When they were done I put them in the food processor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good.  I'm not a fan of pinto beans and this is a great way for me to eat them.  I did not use the jalapenos and added about 1/4 cup sour cream.  After I mashed them with the potato masher, I used beat them with the electric beater.  Made them very light.  Yum.

Flavor isn't quite what I expected.  I don't honestly like it very much and I love refried beans.  May try again with some different spices.

This was a good starter for refried beans for me. Most time I do not think about soaking beans before I use them so this was great. I didn't have any fresh jalpenos, so I used the ones form the fridge, I also didn't use as much for the kids sake, however next time I WILL! And I reduced the salt to 3 teaspoons and not teh 5  These were good, I think they were missing something, which could have been more heat, that is the reason I only gave this four stars, othere than that these were great. I used these as the bottom layer for taco salad. Tonight I plan on making bean dip out of them. Thaks for the recipe Chef!! Next time I will use other reviewers suggestions and try half black beans and half pintos,as well as using stock as oppsed to water. Either way I think these were definatley better than store bought.Thanks again.

I did not have any jalapenos, so I made this recipe without. These beans a very good. I used chicken base instead of water, and some bay leaf,but other than that, followed the recipe. Topped with cheddar cheese and served as a side with Carne asada from my page. Thanks for the recipe! I hate store bought beans...too salty...

Great recipe and so easy!  I removed all the onions and peppers, prior to mashing the beans, pureed them with a little of the remaining water and added them back to beans and mashed.  I didn't want to lose all that flavor, but my family wouldn't eat them if they were too chunky.  I used the leftover cooking water for some rice, and it was soooo good.  A great companion for the beans.  Thanx for posting the recipe.

These beans are so delicious, so easy, and fat free! Perfect!  Thank you so much!  I did use 1 tsp chicken bouillon granules for each cup water, added chili powder (equal to cumin) and cooked on low for 10 hours instead of high for 8 (me paranoid of leaving the pot unattended on high).  Love it!

This was really good! I did half pinto/half black beans. I think I might do 75/25 next time. It smelled really gross near the end of cooking, but after I mashed everything with a potato masher and tasted it, it was really tastey and didn't smell funny anymore. It made about four meals worth, maybe three cans worth? (We don't use up a whole can normally, do I make any sense?) We froze the leftovers. They thaw well.

What I love about this recipe is that you can really make it your own.  I followed recipe exact, but once I had the beans mashed (the immersion blender worked great for this...), I found I wanted to 'tinker' with the seasonings a bit more.  I started out with reducing the amount of salt based on previous reviews, but wound up adding garlic salt, more cumin, and  pinches of italian seasoning and cinnamon.  This smelled so wonderful as it cooked all day. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Due to time, I had to make these on the stove.  It was still simple and turned out great!  I did a quick soak on the beans and cooked them with all of the recipe ingredients for about 2 hours.  I thought there was too much onion so I removed some of it before I mashed the beans.  These weren't exactly like the beans I eat at our local Mexican restaurants but they were very good and so much better than canned.

You will have to add a lot more anions, garlic and cumin to give some taste otherwise it's too bland. I also added some chili powder.

I put the beans in the crockpot overnight added 1/2 tsp. chili powder, bumped up the cumin to a tablespoon and used a whole jalapeno quartered. Cooked on high of 6 hours and turned out great. I might add some cooked ground beef with taco seasoning to the pot to make it a meal. Thanks!

5 STARS!  Yum Yum YUM!  I did follow another recommendation to use 1/2 black beans and 1/2 pinto beans.  And I didn't have time to chop up onion, garlic and jalapeno so I just used powders.  VERY GOOD!  And were great with burritos!

Wow. My husband wanted me to duplicate his favorite meal from a restaurant he used to frequent in South Florida.  Steak tacos served with rice and refried beans. I couldn't imagine refried beans NOT coming from a can, but since we aren't a fan of those...I wanted to give this recipe a shot. I was AMAZED that 8 hours after just dumping the easy ingredients into my crock pot that I could come up with something so delicious. The recipe made a ton of refried beans and I LOVE that this a great tasting receipt WITHOUT the lard or bacon grease many others call for. I followed the receipe to a T and decided to add a little of the cumin too even though it was optional. I loved that I had plenty of the flavored liquid reserved to add back into the beans so we could have them the EXACT consistency we wanted.  Awesome recipe! Thank you!

My crockpot had it cooking for an extra hour and still not done.  Probably needed a couple more hours.  Taste was good, but beans still grainy.

I was really bummed out after reading all of the wonderful reviews. I made the recipe exactly as stated except for adding the entire jalepeño for a little extra kick. My batch turned out so bland I ended up throwing it away.. The recipe really does give the final product consistant with canned beans, just not enough flavor.. Perhaps will modify and try again!

Delicious! Who knew refried beans could be soooooo much better than the store's? I didn't have a jalepeno so I used a few drops of habenero hot sauce. It cooked on its own for 7 hours and then I used a hand mixer. So easy, so good.

I just made this and followed the others reviewers suggestions about it being bland, so I pureed the garlic, 1/2 onion and serrano pepper and added it to the pot. I doubled the cumin and added chicken boullion cubes 3, to the pot and no salt. Well it was still salty, and spicy. I have started the second batch according to the recipe without salt, and 2 boullion cubes, no puree of onion or pepper. I'll see if this can tone it down a bit. I used one less cup of water since the first batch was soupy. I do think it does miss the fat, but if cheese is added, that should help out.

This was an easy recipe.  I forget to buy refried beans and this recipe was just perfect.  I didn't change a thing.

looked like refried beans and tasted fine with some taquitos and guacamole, but these beans were really bland in flavor on their own.

This is an amazing recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been so salty - I decreased the salt to 2 1/2 tsp after reading other reviews, and I still found it to be a little too salty.  Next time I think 2 tsp will be perfect.  I love the flavors, and it's so easy to make!  I did it on the stovetop because sadly, once I had loaded my slow cooker with everything and turned it on, I found that the poor thing had broken and would no longer heat.  So I fished out the vegetables, chopped and sauteed them, and then soaked & cooked the beans.  Added the veg and seasonings after thebeans were cooked and mashed the whole thing up.  DELISH!  I love this on brown rice with a sprinkling of pepper jack cheese.

This is delicious and SO easy!  I read through the reviews first and reduced the salt since my hubby isn't a salt addict like I am.  (Edit - I have since increased the salt up to at least a tbsp for our tastes.)  These beans are fantastic!  My husband asks at least once or twice a week, "When are you making beans again?"  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's a staple in our house now. :)

These beans are unbelievably good!  I would give them 10 stars if I could.  They are soo easy and the amazing thing is that there's nothing unhealthy in them! (if you don't count the salt =).)  I like to add a boulion cube or two.

This is the best refried bean recipe I have tried.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  I also soaked the beans overnight, this is something my hispanic grandmother always did when making beans.

I can't believe this worked!  They are so good and so easy.  My husband loved them.  The only comment was they were a tiny bit too salty.  I love salt but it was a bit much.  I will lessen the amount of salt next time.  Other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper.  Yum!

This recipe was so simple and the beans were delicious. The best thing about it, I actually knew what I was eating. Canned items have so many preservetives that I am afraid to use them much. This takes the worry away without taking away the taste. Thank you!

These taste fantastic! My husband and son don't like beans or refried beans at all but they both loved these. I kept the seeds of the chili pepper for extra flavor and added beef broth instead of water. Very good. I'm making more today.

Delicious! Took the advice of other reviewers and used broth (chicken and veggie) in place of all but 2 c. of water, then reduced salt by more than half (don't remember how much exactly). I felt it needed a tad more spice, next time I'll add a whole jalepeno. This will be a go-to recipe from now on!

This recipe was very easy and very good.  I would reccomend cutting down the salt and garlic though.  You kind of had to babysit the slow cooker and make sure your water didn't run out, but the end result was really good (that was when I used my bigger slow cooker.  This last time I used a smaller one and actually had to remove some water at the end of the cooking time).  I would definately make again if I wanted the restuarant taste without going out.

Fabulous.  Try using chicken stock for all/part of the water.  Great both ways.  Also, consider leaving some of the beans whole after cooking - they're delicious too!

This is a keeper!  Your salt recommendation is perfect.  I added 2 jalepenos, oregano, and thyme.  Served with cornbread panckaes and honey. Even my daughter who is so picky, requested to make this a regular.  Thank you!

I LOVE this recipe!!!  It's tons better than any can of refried beans I've ever had, plus every person in my family not only eats these beans, but love them too.  I've made them with the jalapenos, and with the canned green chilies like another reviewer mentioned.  We prefer the jalapenos.

This is the first time I have ever made refried beans of any kind.  It was very easy.  The texture was good but I felt like mine needed a bit more flavor.  Next time I'm going to do the chicken broth instead of water or add diced chiles like other reviews suggested.

This is so easy.  The recipe as is works very well.  I have used both ways of half broth and all water, either works very well.

This was excellent.  We  usually make huge batches (8 pounds of dry beans) of refried beans and freeze them.  They're good, but it makes a huge mess.

This was easy, they came out very tasty, and no mess.  Will definitely do this from now on.

Wonderfully easy. The final product could have used some more seasoning but good. I used mostly stock instead of water.

Great!!! I made them with beef broth and water (6c broth 3 c water) They were wonderful, my 3 year old had a blast mashing them!!! I also chopped the onion before adding it. These are way better than anything out of a can and SO EASY!!!

My first time making beans that werent out of the can.  I, like many suggested used only half of the salt and 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 water.  Everyone loved them.  Thank you for a great, healthy "refried" bean.

I also used about chicken broth (6 cups broth/3 cups water), and left out the jalapeno (too spicy for my kids).  It was pretty good, but next time I will use less onion.

Best receipe.  Will make this often.  I added hamhocks to this receipe and instead of regular salt I used sea salt. I also added a little bit of chii powder.  Awesome receipe with a lot of flavor.

I only used HALF of the salt, but since I used chicken broth instead of water, it was still WAY too salty.  Next time I'll omit the salt completely.  Also, I minced the onion instead of simply halving it.  Very tasty though!

These are great!  I did use 3/4 chicken stock and 1/4 water as well as cutting the salt in half.  We won't be buying beans anymore.  Also tried with Black pintos, no problems there either.

OH MY GOSH!  I hosted a mexican food themed couple's shower and to save money I had the fajitas catered and made the rice and beans myself. Everyone raved about these beans - they were a huge hit.  People were saying they were the best they'd ever had.

These were really good and my husband LOVED them.  I gave it 4 stars b/c it was really messy to make.  I put the beans in the blender which made them a nicer consistency but created a huge mess.  I will also cut down on the salt next time.

No need to eat out when it comes to Mexican food.  These beans are far better than any I have tasted in fine Mexican restaurants.  This is a keeper.  And the best part is that they are so easy!

The best refried bean recipe ever! I make a batch on Sunday, and then have low fat bean burritoes the rest of the week for lunch. Tasty and economical!
UPDATE: Instead of adding the onion, garlic, and jalapeno I save more time by adding 1 cup spicy jalapeno salsa. It tastes heavenly after being slow cooked all day!
3/25/12 update- I also add a chipotle pepper. It adds a smokey "meaty" flavor almost like bacon or churizo.

We thought these were pretty good but am sure glad I didn't add but 2 teaspoons of salt even though hubby added a touch more at the table.  I omitted the jalapeno and added a few roasted green chilis, chopped, and didn't add the cumin because the rice I was making to go with my meal had cumin in it.

This was so easy to make and the results were amazing. I needed to add a fair bit of salt at the end to bring out the flavour, but otherwise it was very good. It makes a whole lot, so its a good thing it freezes well.

I don't think I will ever buy refried beans from a can again! These cooked all day in my crock pot.  Everytime someone came in the house the asked what smelled so good! I processed these in my blender and added about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Excellent! I got the double thumbs up from my super picky boys!

Ridiculously easy—put this on low for 10 hours in the slow cooker. Great consistancy, but waaaaay too salty. I had to add a can of tomato sauce just to make it edible. I'll definitely do this again, but will cut the salt in half.

Super!  Also a great, meatless bean recipe to serve with rice or cornbread if you don't cook them quite so long and don't mash them.  We loved the flavor and I loved the healthiness of them!  I made no changes.  Great as is!  Thanks!

The few extra ingredients make a huge difference. Lots of flavor! I cooked them overnight for 10 hours on low.

A very good recipe! This was the first time I tried this and it's easy enough with a slow cooker. I used some ideas from other reviews, like adding a little bacon (two strips was enough), and reduced the salt a bit. It has nice flavour, keeps well in the freezer, and can be modified as you go.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. I did follow the recipe to the T the first time. Today I made it again and used 2 jalapeño’s, 1 tsp of ancho chili powder and 1/3 cup of lard added to the recipe. I like beans a little on the spicy side.

I`m fairly lazy, and it is just so much easier/faster to go buy a can of refried beans than to make them at home.  These beans are just so much better than the grocery store beans, however, that I`ll just have to work through my laziness and make them often.

I didn't add the chili pepper because I like things mild. I also, put the beans in the food processor after they were cooked for a very creamy consistency. Also, I thought it was funny they didn't say to take the onions out after cooking the beans. I took out the onions. I'm not sure if that was what I was supposed to do. I did notice people said the recipe was too salty, but I didn't think it was. Overall, the recipe was very yummy!

I used a poblano instead of jalepeno because I just prefer the flavor. I was worried these beans would be bland since they are fat free but they were not bland at all - better than any refried beans I've ever bought at the store!

I added more spices to our liking and did the half pinto and half black bean mix and it was amazing.  I froze some, used some for a Mexican dip AND some for a vegetable soup.  To mix it up I am making it today with also some great northern beans and a can of chipotle peppers.  So versatile!

I've been making these beans for about 5yrs now. They are the EASIEST and TASTIEST beans! My large family eats them up without any issues. Normally I leave them whole but sometimes will mash them. Cooking for a family of 10 can be challenging at times but having something so easy to cook as a staple makes everything so much better! Thank you for this recipe!

I’ve been using this recipe for about 10 years now. It’s fantastic and everyone asks for the recipe when I bring them to an event. Sometimes I use black beans instead. I add chicken bouillon to the water and cut the salt way down but everything else I leave as is.

This has become my favorite bean dish, I added extra garlic and jalapeños, used 3 tsp salt. I love to use leftover bean sauce to add to other recipes like pork stew or Alfredo sauce, nothing goes to waste. Thank you!!

After reading others reviews, I made mine with chicken broth instead of water, used 1tsp salt, half of a jalapeño because I didn’t want it too spicy, and used 1/2tsp cumin.  Let it cook somewhere between 8-9 hrs. The beans were easy to mash using a potato masher, and I used  all the liquid that was left. Turned out so good, Like others I will not need to buy refried beans again. Great recipe. They also froze well, and I just reheated in the microwave. Mm-mm good.

Way to much salt.  I'll try it again with less salt.  After they were done I added 1/2 pound diced, cooked bacon with the grease. Dried beans in the instant pot were done and very soft in 45 minutes.

I like it spicy so added 3 fresh jalapenos, 2 1/2 tsp salt was more than enough (I salt soak my dry beans) and I also used a whole tsp cumin and added a heavy squirt of lime juice or two after I drain the beans.  I've made this over and over again it's my go to!

So easy! I did reduce the salt to 2 and a half teaspoons and I didn't have a jalapeno on hand but it was still tasty. I used a bean masher to mash the beans in a large bowl. Will definitely make again.

These are the best! I've made them so many times and they are my families favorite!! Leftovers don't last long! I follow the directions except for the salt. I took the advice of other reviews and add the salt to taste when they are done cooking. I also followed the reviewer who suggested using the blender to mash them. I LOVE this receipe!!! I LOVE bean & cheese burritos and these beans are the BEST!! And much better without the lard!!! FABULOUS!!!

My wife loved this, but for me it was just ok.  Texture was off and not much flavor in my opinion.

Made as is substituting chicken broth for water. Cooked all day on medium and they were done perfectly. Next time I will add more cumin, jalapeno, pepper and maybe a little chili powder.

I make these beans all the time and everyone comments on how flavorful they are! If you aren’t married to the vegan-ness of it you can replace 1/2 the water with chicken stock for even better flavor - just cut the salt in half too or it’ll be too much. Tastes better thick so better to add more water if needed than having to remove it at the end.

I used a little more cumin and it could have used a little less salt, but it turned out great. Substituted some chili flakes for peppers as I had some on hand.

Perfect! We don't like jalapeno, so we substituted a small can of green chiles. Also wound up adding more water. 
I was surprised at 8 hours on high, but they were the perfect texture.  Thinking of using the remaining broth for a soup. Any ideas?

I did it in my pressure cooker, using dried pinto beans. I only used 1 tsp of black pepper and no jalapeno or seranos- wanted to make sure grandkids could eat it.  Nice flavor ! I will freeze in small containers 12 oz. Or so.
Thanks!!!

Very nice recipe.  This can be fat-free and vegan.  I've been making this for several years now.  I use a 5 qt crock pot and use 4 cups of beans.  When the beans finish cooking, I transfer the beans to a mixing bowl with a spider and mash them up with a potato masher, adding the broth from the pot as necessary to keep the overall texture moist.  Pour  the mashed beans in 2-cup plastic containers and freeze until tostada/bean burrito night.  Just defrost the frozen container of beans overnight in the refrigerator or  in the microwave defrost setting (30% power) for 15 minutes.  Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.  When reheating you can add more spices, like cumen or chili powder, or mix it into sauteed onions on the stovetop if you like.  Sometimes I don't mash the beans, but store them with some broth in 16oz containers.  Should fill about seven to eight containers.  In the morning, reheat a containter of beans in the microwave with a teaspoon of chili powder for homemade chili beans.  Put in a food thermos and take to work for a 50 cent cheap, flavorful and vegan lunch.  Maybe a dollup of sour cream and a PB&J 'wich on the side.

I make green chili ALL the time (I'm talking a few times a month) and these beans are perfect for burritos. I use a can (sometimes two) of chicken broth when I make these. Also, instead of 5 teaspoons of salt (yikes!), I use 2 1/2-3 teaspoons of KOSHER salt. I'll never buy canned beans again.

Definitely the easiest refried beans I've made. I only put in 1 tsp salt after all of the other reviews, and used my own chicken bone broth and it turned out great. Used it for nachos and everyone raved.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it. Usually I'm giving jars of beans away every time when I double the recipe. One thing to note, you can greatly reduce the salt when making several batches at once.  also, some  people are very sensitive to the cumin taste, so you might want to reduce that too.  I like it and cumin gives a unique Mexican flavor, but some people just don't like the taste of cumin.

This is a great recipe for those who are vegetarian or do not eat pork! This recipe tasted great and was sooo easy to make! A few notes: the cumin should not be optional! I actually increased the amount of cumin to 1 tsp and I feel like this dish may be a little bland otherwise. I listened to the reviews a reduced the amount of salt to 4 tsp and it was almost still too salty for me, however, my boyfriend disagreed and probably would have been fine with the 5 tsp, so it just depends on your personal taste. I also skipped the jalapeño and felt it still came out fine.

I made this and found it to be bland.  I didn't have a jalapeno, so maybe that was it.  I'm going to try again since all the reviews are so great.

I have been making this since 2013 and my family loves it and it freezes very well. After making original recipe I made the following changes. I used 1lb bag each of Pinto & Black beans and I soaked over night and drained before cooking. I use 1 carton of Chicken Broth, and this fill to top of cooker. Still cook for 8 hrs and add water if necessary andstir about 1/2 way? I use 1 TBSP sugar, 1 TBSP chili powder and only 1 1/2 tsp salt After beans have cooked and 1/4 tsp Cumin. I then use an old fashioned potatoe masher to slightly mash. Cool then fill  freezer containers .

I didn't use enough salt since we don't eat a lot of salt in our house so I think this is why it didn't turn out as good as good as everyone else's.  It definitely needs the salt.  I will try making again in the future and add more next time.  This is very easy.

These are very good and you can eat them as is, with cheese or use them in multiple recipes.  I love to use them in what I refer to as tacoless salads.

I make this recipe in my instant pot and it cooks up perfectly in about an hour. I dice the onion instead of halving it and mash it up with the beans at the end of cooking. I lowered the amount of salt to about half as recommended by others. Great recipe! My husband didn’t believe that they were homemade!

We make these at least once every other month! So delicious and great to have on hand as a protein packed side to meats and fish. I use chicken broth instead of water and they always come out so flavorful!

I've made this several times, although never the full process of putting in the slow cooker. I've just made it for one - putting a can of FF beans in a small pot, adding seasonings and heating. Great to eat by themselves or in an enchilada! Yum Yum!!

These are my favorite refried beans, homemade or restaurant! It makes a lot so I put serving sized quantities in ziplock bags and freeze them. Even though there is a jalapeno, these are not spicy at all.

Will never buy canned again.  Made a few times. Cut salt to 2.5t. Used 1/2t black pepper (not fresh ground). Grocery store out of jalapenos so used red bell pepper and honestly didn't notice a difference. The first time I made as instructed, with 2T minced garlic. The second time I just crushed a couple of cloves and removed them prior to mashing; although they were so soft I probably could've mashed them with the beans and they would've incorporated fine. I did not notice a difference in taste (minced vs crushed) so I would suggest skipping the hassle of mincing.

Way better than store refried beans!  I make it often and freeze the extra in Food Saver bags.  Reheats very well.  I use my KitchenAid to mash them quick and easy.  Be aware will impact the smooth glaze in your crockpot.

I think these refried beans are great without all the lard and oil. I add more garlic, and less salt. I put in chicken broth, or paste, or bullion cubes, or chicken base powder, which ever I have handy. It adds flavor as well as a little more sodium. That's why I use less then half the salt it ask for. This is great tasting, it also is great for making Spanish bean dip for tortilla chips.

I like less salt but otherwise delicious. Play with the liquid amounts based on how thick I want the beans to be, keeping in mind they thicken in the fridge.

Definitely will make again! So easy, sooo good! It smells amazing too. 
I used chicken stock in place of half the water, double the cumin,  about 1/2 cup of prepared salsa, and added a large chunk of side pork/fat to give it that really authentic taste. Delicious. My kids even wanted  these beans for breakfast this morning!!

Delicious! I used chipotle chili pepper instead of black pepper, and felt it needed a bit more salt. Definitely competes with Taco Bell when used on a burrito. Loved it.

Very good and easy!  I used only 3 tsp of salt and swapped veggie stock for the water.  After mashing, I left the crock pot on low for serving and realized that the beans eventually dried out a bit and I should have just saved some more of the reserved liquid that i threw away after the final step!  But I just rehydrated with more stock and it was great !   I like that with making your own beans, you can control the consistency unlike when you get them in can (I like them lumpy).  I'll definitely make again!

I add 1 pound of salt pork (quartered). After the beans have cooked, remove the salt pork and seperate the fat from the meat and discard the fat. Shred the meat and add to the beans before mashing.

Fantastic recipe. It makes quite a bit of beans though so I usually cut everything in half when cooking for two.

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy to make and so flavorful.  All I changed was jalepenos.  I used two whole jalepenos and it didn't seem too spicy.  I do like spicy food though.  I used my hand mixer to mash the beans and it was so easy.  I don't like beans with no texture, so I leave some barely mashed. This also makes very good pinto beans-just don't mash.   I will be making my own refried beans from now on.

I make these all the time with a few adjustments which everyone loves. 

3 cups pinto beans,
4 slices applewood bacon,
1 whole chile de arbol (fresh, sliced & deseeded),
2 tbsp minced garlic,
1 whole onion, sliced,
2 tsp Himalayan pink salt,
1 tsp ground black pepper,
1 tsp ground cumin,
2 tsp chicken bouillon,
9 cups water.

The beans turn out perfect once cooked and everything is mashed together with an electric immersion blender. Add the reserved liquids, that were separated from the cooked beans, as needed. So good!

gigantic hit! i did decrease the salt and increase the cumin the next time i made it. i also minced some of the jalapeno seeds to add heat. i'm going to try chicken broth, but not necessary!  SO EASY. i get requests for this all the time for dinner. after ready reviews i will save the leftover liquid for other uses! thanks chef

Very tasty recipe.  I left out the salt and used Anaheim pepper.  I froze the leftovers.  I've made this recipe twice the first time I had to add water.   The second time I added the extra water at the start and it was too much and had to cook it down.

I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love these beans.  I adore refried beans, and was extremely excited to make fat free refried beans.  Blech.  My family would not eat them, I had to heat up lard and add to the beans. My husband said they tasted like Rosarita beans from a can.  I'm a born, bred and raised So Cal girl, so I'm wondering if people who never had REAL refried beans are the reason fro the 4.5 stars.  
If you want real refried beans, you have to use a little lard.

I used 2 cups of beans (1 bag) and 6 cups of water. Just for me and my husband. I used half a chopped onion, 3 crushed and chopped garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp reduced sodium taco seasoning, 1 extra large beef bouillon cube, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp cumin,  and about 3 soup spoons of marinated jalapeno slices. I cooked on high for 6 hours and low for the last two. It turned out thick stew consistency so I could just mash them and add cheese. They are SPECTACULAR ! They are quite spicy so we'll be eating them with our Juanita's tortilla chips today! GREAT, EASY recipe!

I really enjoyed these beans except they are too salty.  I would halve the amount of salt next time and add in a tablespoon of chili powder.

Delicious ...absolutely the best beans I have ever made with such little effort... I used 4 teaspoons of salt..next time I think 2  would be fine then add  if desired .  I didn't understand the onion part in the recipe , so I just chopped and added 1 onion. I did add one splash of smoke flavour it worked beautifully. Everyone in our household agree ..excellent. Now part of my vegan  menu.

We've made this at least half a dozen times. I find the salt is too much for my taste, so i usually drop it down to 3 tsps. The last time I made it I used a full jalapeno pepper, not wanting to waste the other half and thinking it wouldn't much difference. Was still delicious, but too hot for my taste.  I won't be trying that again.

Absolutely delicious. After reading reviews about it being overly salty, we decided to double the jalapeno it calls for and add only 2 tsp of salt. It's DELICIOUS, and it holds a great pinto bean texture if you don't want to mash them.

These beans turned out very good!!! I did make one small change to the recipe by cutting the amount of salt down to 3 teaspoons and added 5 chicken bouillon cubes. It really enhanced the flavor. So much better than canned beans. I also reserved the juice for the freezer. I thought if I got in a pinch and had to use canned refried beans, I could add some of the juice to the canned beans for better flavor. Definitely a keeper !!!

I made these beans as the recipe says and they turned out really good. The only thing I'm doing different for next time is to cut the salt down to 3 teaspoons because they were a bit salty. But other than that they are so good.

Love this recipe! I've tried with half pinto beans and they were also good. I usually switch to Low after the first 2 hours because I noticed they were simmering pretty "angrily," but my crockpot runs hot. Makes a lot, freezes fairly well, good for use in black bean or bean and rice patties.

I've been making this recipe ever since i found it here on AR a few years ago..This is hands down the best re fry recipe  I have made.It's so good that nobody in our family wants the canned stuff anymore (no flavor).This should get an extra star just for the ease of making the recipe.I now make a double batch every couple months and freeze the left overs in small containers.Like others I did cut the salt to 3 teaspoons.Thanks for sharing recipe.

I've used this recipe many times, and it works well for basic refried beans. As written, I find it slightly bland, but it's a great place to start and then season as desired.

New Family favorite! Love going to Mexican restaurants n ordering the refried beans. We are meat free and know that most authentic places use lard- n honestly it makes them. But this recipe is so authentic with no meat or lard. I used Chipotle pepper in adobe sauce instead of the Jalepeño. 
My 13 year old son couldn't get enough.

Super easy and yummy! I forgot to add a carrot or potato, as Mom used to do, to reduce the "effect" of the beans.

My husband loves these beans! And he's a picky critic especially with mexican food as he compares it to his mother's cooking. 

I normally cook black beans but wanted to try pinto for the first time. For the 2 of us, I dropped it down to 6 servings and followed the recipe except I used chicken broth instead of water and I did not add additional water. I slow cook it in my crockpot for 7-8 hours. They are super tasty! Someone else suggested using an immersion blender in the crock pot so I do that at the end. I do not drain it either. Made this twice and we always eat the whole batch up!

6 servings gives us 2 quite a few meals for the week. I have frozen beans as well in a zip bag flat if i make too much.

This is perfect all on its own for a low sodium recipe. For a little extra salt, add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.

Ummm....this is amazing! I always have cans of refried beans in my cabinet because....who doesn't? It never even occurred to me to make them myself. So when I was looking at my daily allrecipe feed, this recipe popped up. I said to myself: What? Is this truly a possibility to make my own refried beans?!?! Have I been hiding under a rock my whole life? I followed the recipe as written and it was SUPERB! Super duper big thank you for sharing! Will never purchase a can of refried again ????

Delicious!  I did use 1/2 pinto 1/2 black beans, used 4 cups chicken broth and the rest was water and just 1 t of salt.  Very good!  So easy and so good!

Yum! I used the blender because mashing all this up takes too long. Plus--you can blend the onions in with it too! I saved the water from the pot to add to the blender to get the right consistency.

Absolute perfection. The first time I made it exactly as described. Since then I've modified a bit, in that I use black beans and cut back the salt to 3 teaspoons. Also, I no longer mash them to make refried beans. Instead, I leave them whole and eat them as is (sometimes with sour cream and/or shredded cheese), over rice, in fried burritos, etc. A vegetarian friend raved about this recipe, and she says she now makes ALL kinds of beans with this recipe. Like me, she doesn't really care for spicy stuff; that said, the jalapeno isn't noticeable but definitely contributes to the overall flavor.

Delicious recipe! Well seasoned and just as I'd hoped them to be!  Easy peasy and so worth it!  I used half black beans/half pinto beans and it was a delicious combo!  I used one jalapeno instead of a half, and the heat was just right for a mixed crowd.  Thank you so much for the yummy recipe!

My husband was very apprehensive when I told him we were making refried beans for Mexican night.  When we threw everything in the crockpot and didn't touch it again until a few hours before dinner the next day, he became a believer.  We received nothing but praises from our friends.  I will never use can refried beans again if I don't have to.  I used only 1 tbs of salt since everyone said that it was too salty and I used broth instead of plain water, and 1 whole jalapeno.  I will actually use 2 next time since it wasn't spicy enough for me.

I used sriracha sauce instead of the jalapenos. It turns out great!

The downside to this recipe - my family won't let me cheat and buy the cans anymore...

My husband really liked these, I liked them, but thought it was missing something. They were easy to make and I think a great base recipe that I could change up to my tastes, however, since my husband is the one who loves refried beans, I will probably leave them as is and just add a little hot sauce or something to my portion. I did cut the salt back to one TBSP instead of 5 teaspoons, it just seemed like a lot to me.

This is a great recipe, but I tweeked it a bit to make it the bomb for my family/friends.  Instead of salt, I use chicken bouillon (like Nor Suiza).  Also, I eliminate the cumin since I don't really like it.  Instead of water, I use broth & I put raw bacon.  Use the cheapest stuff, since it's usually the fattiest.  It gives it flavor until there's no end!

These are the most amazing refried beans! I have made traditionally refried beans with lard and all that jazz but nothing compares to this! The flavors are just amazing and the whole family was so pleased (we are a tex mex loving family, so this is saying something!). As previous reviewers noted, I did find it a tad salty, so I will reduce the salt by a Tbsp. next time. I also found that there was maybe a bit more liquid left over after they were done, but I maybe had some old and stubborn beans on hand (beans get tougher and need longer cooking times as they get older; when you're buying beans from the store there is no way to guarantee how old they are). I used my stick blender to "mash" them directly in my crock pot and I froze my leftovers with great results. This is a must have recipe and I know that I will never buy refried beans again.

This is the easiest and most economical way to make refried beans. We like a little more flavoring and spice in our beans so I added 1Tbs of both cumin and chili powder to the mix as well as doubling the jalapeño. These beans freeze really well so there is no reason to run out!

Delicious! I waited to add the salt until my beans were ready to mash. Salt can make the skin tough and keep the beans from getting soft. I minced, not halved, the onion and added 1/2 tsp. Allison's Chili Spice Blend which consists of chili pwd, cumin, garlic, oregano, coriander, cloves, allspice, salt, celery seed, yellow mustard, paprika, cayenne,  and many other spices. I forgot to put the pepper in so I added 1 tsp. after it was all made and it was still amazing! The pepper gives it a little more kick; next time I will add the pepper in the first step.

I was really hoping that this recipe would be great using the crock pot, how much easier could it be?  It wasn't good.  I followed directions with exception  of using less salt.  They were as hard as could be even after cooking all day.  I tried using an immersion blender and when that wasn't enough, had to put them in a blender.  It took forever to blend and had to do it using very small batches.  The beans used were fresh so you can't blame the beans.  Will be looking for a more traditional recipe.

What a great way to season Refried beans!
I used canned refried beans and added some lime juice.
Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I used about 1/2 a minced chipotle pepper in adoba sauce instead of the fresh jalapeno.  Per dietary restrictions, I eliminated the salt during cooking.  I pureed the onion separately after cooking & added that into the mashed beans.  I thought it could used more flavor so I added some garlic powder & 1 tsp. of Bragg's Liquid Aminos  to the mashed beans..

I have made this 3 times. The first time I used chicken broth for extra flavor and the 2-3rd time it was with water. Both are wonderful. It is so easy and I don't have to wait for the liquid to boil down. I just remove most of the liquid, then use a hand held blender and only add extra liquid if the beans are too dry. I also have used small red beans instead of the pinto beans. Both are wonderful. I even shared the recipe with my dad. He loves them!

Important tip: add the salt when they are nearly done. This will help cook the beans faster and you will better have an idea of how much salt to add once after all other flavors have melded.

This is fantastic and easy, be sure to pick out the bad beans and rinse them well. This can be made portioned and frozen for later use in portion sizes. Great for taking to work for lunch.

This is the Go To "refried" bean recipe. Lots of good suggestions from reviewers. The most important being cut the salt. I added some bacon fat w/o the bacon and as much Jalapeno as I wanted. Not sure one can tell the difference between 8 and 10 hours in the slow cooker. High cooks the bejeezus out of the beans for sure. Up the cumin and add spices of your desire.

Best beans I have ever made! I took the advice of another review and put in a whole seeded jalapeño which I removed at the end of cooking. I mashed them in a pan with a little butter and olive oil along with the bean water with great success. This will be my go-to from now on.

Second time making these. Followed the recipe to the letter, except  I used my own combination of seasonings (cumin, ancho chili pepper, and an Adobo seasonin)  and the taste is great. My only problem is the texture. 9 cups of water is way too much and my crock pot tends to run hot. My current batch is still soupy and I only used 8 cups.  Next time I'm going to start with 5 cups and add as needed.

These are so good, and are really easy to make! I have used a fresh jalapeño before, as well as a can of diced jalapeños.  The can was spicier, but I actually preferred it.  I also use chicken stock instead of water to infuse a little more flavor.  I increase the cumin (personal preference) and use about a tablespoon of salt.  My husband loves these, and as another person commented, these really are so much better than using a can.

Way too much pepper for me!  I've been eating a lot of refried beans, so I thought it might be nice to make some and freeze it.  I followed the recipe except no jalapeno.  My pepper is fresh cracked, so maybe that makes a difference.

I made these today to go with my carne asada tacos. It's easy peasy to put together and love the fact that you just walk away and let it cook most the day. I did use 1/2 of the salt asked for. I was worried it would come out too salty. After they were done I wished I had used all the salt required, because they were a bit bland for my liking. I also didn't think they were spicy at all with the added jalapeno. Next time I may use more jalapeno and add some bacon for flavor. As is, this recipe is very good and so much more healthy than canned or the refried beans made with lard. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Easy and good!  Made with chicken broth (vs. water) and eliminated the salt.  Did not add the jalapeno (too spicy for hubby), but other than that followed the recipe.  When it was done, I ladled out all the liquid I could and then started mashing.  Didn't need to add any back in and saved the 4 cups remaining liquid as a beany/chicken soup stock.  Having some beans with Spanish rice tonight - melted cheese on top.  Simple, but delish.  Bean burritos another night.

These taste perfect and there isn't any fat/lard in them! Since so many people said they were too salty, I only put one tsp in the crockpot and then added more salt to taste after mashing. I also added a little chicken broth in lieu of the water because I had some in the fridge. I used a can of diced green chilies instead of the jalapeño because I didn't have one. And I cooked the beans the day before, let them cool, put in fridge overnight, drained and mashed beans before heating the following day. I usually heat a can of Rosarita retried beans to eat with our tacos, but my family asked that I write this recipe down for future taco nights.

Made this recipe as listed. Yummy. My wife who makes beans all the time by soaking overnight and then preparing said this is the only way she will make her beans from now on. May try adding a little bacon next time.

Ive made this recipe a few times now, and it never disappoints! I no longer buy the canned stuff. This recipe is just too good! 
I add diced onion instead of onion halves. I thought that the diced onion gives more onion flavor.

OMGEEEE!!  I love refried beans you get in a restaurant, but hated the ones in the cans. My first try at making my own for cinco de mayo.. and they are fabulous. I will never ever ever buy another can. I don't know what took me so long to try making. Could not be any easier....I did lower the salt as others suggested and ended up putting in the rest as I was mashing... so stick to the recipe folks.. I am so happy. Thank you!
As a side note.... I made the first batch Wednesday... today I doubled the recipe and am making more. This does not make as big a batch as you might think.  Dinner for 5 Thursday night, 3 bean burritos last nite... and a small container left. Doubled the batch today (Saturday) so I can have some to freeze.

I've made this several times.  After spending many years in the southwest I find myself in NY state, and the only way to get authentic Mexican food is to make it myself!  The only thing I add is a couple packages of Goya brand Sabor A Jamon de Cocinar (basically ham bouillion).  It gives it a flavor like it was cooked with meat!

I've made this recipe at least 20 times now. It's easy and costs so much less than the equivalent in canned beans. Tasty, too! I usually add a bit more garlic and a whole jalapeño (rather than the recommended half), but those are oersonal preferences I've discovered over time. The recipe is perfect!

I made this and it was incredible! I also used chicken stock and water.  I removed some of the liquid prior to mashing the beans. I used an immersion blender to mash up the beans and the texture was similar to bean dip.  I have a "secret recipe for bean dip and plan to try it with these beans.

As good as any restaurant!  I used 3 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper and it's perfect!  You can use a potato masher if you want to leave some bean pieces but if you want super creamy, use an immersion blender.

I made this without the jalapeno, simply because I didn't have one.  I also reduced the salt to two teaspoons which for us, was perfect.  Served it with chicken enchiladas.  It was a big hit.  Have made it several times since.  The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the salt the recipe calls for.

Super delicious. I made a big batch (5.5 cups of dried beans) and still only used 3 tsp of salt. It was still a little salty. I upped the cumin to 1 tsp. I also used Serrano peppers instead of jalapeño and they turned out great if you like it a little spicier. The only thing I felt was amiss was there was waaaay too much black pepper. I don't feel the need for the black pepper at all. It overwhelmed the flavor of the beans and turned me off these otherwise perfect beans.

This was terrific! I will NOT be paying for the canned stuff any more. And, I froze half of the recipe as it makes a lot. It worked out beautifully! I omitted the peppers, but that is the only change I made.Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this recipe.  This does not last long in our house.  I use it for Nacho's, burrito's, taco's, and just plain with melted cheese on top.  The only change I made to the recipe was the amount of salt.  2 to 3 teaspoons is fine for my family.

I have made these refried beans at least 50 times, I make a double batch and freeze them.  They are amazing if you haven't tried them you should.  I make my own adjustments to make them spicier.

Awesome!! I followed the recipe but added an extra 3 jalepanos, a teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of cayenne. Pretty darn good!! Might want to cut the recipe in half, it's a lot of beans.

These are my absolute favorite. I use 8 cups of chicken broth instead of nine cups of water. I put in two whole Serano peppers and double the garlic. I also put six slices of raw bacon into it. The bacon gives it great flavor and my dog is happy when she gets to eat them when the beans are done!!!! I also add 1/4 cup lard and a teaspoon chili powder. Soooo yummy

Wonderful, first time making. After reading reviews substituted 3 cups chicken broth for 3 cups of water and put in no salt until after tasting.  Cut the onion up so it would incorporate also and cooked overnight.  Ended up with none because the kids split up and took it home with them. Need to make again right away. I only needed to add 1 tsp salt at the end.

Instead of adding salt and using water I use low sodium chicken stock. I've tried this recipe several times, including with half pinto and half black beans. There's a weird consistency when I add in the black beans...almost gritty. I stick to only pinto beans now.

We have made these for years and years and just love them.  Great easy low fat way to make refried beans.  We use any dried beans.  We make them in chicken broth and don't add the salt until they are done.  Also, I usually use one lb bag of dried beans with about 7-8 cups of water.  Remember, you can always add more seasoning when they are done so don't worry about salt until the end.

I've made this multiple times & it's always a hit with my family. I usually soak the beans overnight & use chicken stock as the liquid. Sometimes I just strain the beans & don't even mash because it's delicious either way. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used chicken broth instead for half of the water.  Might want to cut water back by one cup as it is a bit runny.  Great flavor that my family & friends loved.

I'm vegan, so I used water and not chicken broth, and these beans turned out awesome!!  Even my husband, who's a full-on carnivore, loved them!!  I followed the advice of one of the other comments here, and (after initially mashing the beans with a potato masher) used a hand mixer to get the consistency that I desired.  I made them yesterday, and will be using them today for Super Bowl "7-Layer Dip"!!  YUM!

fantastic ! They do turn out pretty runny so I often ladle off some of the liquid before blending with an immersion blender. if they are too thick when they have cooled, I will just stir some of it back in before storing them in the fridge.

love this recipe and make it once a week for my family. I do use vegetable broth to replace some of the water and add some cumin, cayenne, and paprika to taste at the end.  Adding the broth and spices is the only reason it isn't a 5 stars but that is more a matter of taste.

I listened to the other reviews and reduced the amount of salt and added a little more stock. Also, I used a whole jalapeno pepper instead of a half. Definitely  going to make this again!

Very good!  I've made these a couple of times now and  I'm going to have to start doubling the recipe - we just eat these up too fast!   I sub shallots for onions and throw in a whole jalapeño, roughly chopped, seeds and all.  I do cut down the salt to 2 tsp, like many reviews suggested, and we find that is salty enough.  My husband and my picky teenager both enjoy these as well.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I've been using this simple recipe since I found it on Recipezaar.com many years ago.  Sometimes I combine black and pinto beans together, and most often, make a double batch.  I use these beans (drained and rinsed) in my Friday Night Taco Salad, adding them to my meat mixture.  I just added them (drained and rinsed) into my Tortilla Soup recipe in the crock pot.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

I didn't end up having 8 hours so I switched to a covered pot after 4 hours.  A gentle boil for another two hours or so and everything worked out fine.

I've been making these for years, in fact it's the only way I know, to make "un- refried" beans.  The batch I made this weekend, has Jalapenos, roasted garlic, green chilies, onion,broth, cumin, EVO, and a little pico de gallo  that needed to be used up, and no salt. I cook mine on low for 2 days, then I don't need to mash the beans. Such a great recipe !! It's very flexible, so add & subtract ingredients at will. It will always turn out delicious!

Too salty. I should have gone with my gut and added the salt at the very end. Other recipes I've tried have said to wait until the end and I think the beans have cooked faster.

I love this recipe!! I did add only 2 teaspoons of salt...it calls for 5 tsp. and that makes it WAY too salty. I like to make burritos out of these with cheese and whole wheat tortillas. You can make these vegan also by adding brown rice and spicy salsa. I wrap them up in parchment paper and freeze them. Great to throw in the lunch box and heat in the microwave for a quick and inexpensive meal.

Really Really Good.  The first time I made them they were OUTSTANDING  (like call all your girlfriends over and break out a bag of chips outstanding).  The second time... good but not quite like the first time.  The third time... really good.  I haven't quite figured out what changed (or if I have just become accustomed to great beans).  I caramelize my onions before adding.  Also, I make a big batch and then freeze to use in place of canned.  They freeze great. Highly recommend!

We never buy refried beans anymore.  Love this recipe and it's so, so easy.  We do back off on the salt a little and up the cumin but that is just our personal preference.

Great base recipe, but far too much salt.  I used 2 tsp for  12 oz bag of beans  and it was plenty.  Salt is important, but too much ruins the recipe.  With that said, the jalepeno, onion and spices are just right. Could easily add more jalepeno or a cayenne for more spice

Reading the reviews, I used my pressure cooker to make this recipe.  I cooked it for 95 minutes and let it naturally release.  I blended them in the food processor adding juice to make the perfect consistency.  Everyone loved them!

I have made this many times. I use black beans instead of pinto beans and like it very much.

I also use an immersion blender instead of a potato masher. That gives it more of a dip consistency than a refried bean consistency.

Yummy! I have a large family that gets together for Sunday lunch. I made the beans, and EVERYBODY loved them! Only change I made after reading the reviews was adding about 5 chicken bouillon cubes. I also added 3tablespoons of garlic salt and no other salt. There are 23 of us and this made enough for all. I used a 2 lb bag of beans.

This recipe was really easy and I enjoyed it because I could control the salt, which I reduced.  It's nice to have an option for low sodium and low fat refritos.  I would doctor it up with additional seasonings next time, as I eliminated the jalapenos because I was cooking for small children.  As such, it was a bit on the bland side, but still tasty.  Thanks!

Gotta give 5 stars!  These are truly fantastic and couldn't be any more simple!  When the beans were done and supper was almost ready we decided to try them with a couple of tortilla chips while other stuff was finishing up - we could hardly stop eating them so that I could serve them for supper!! DH loves refried beans but I've only ever served canned. He was thrilled. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!  Oh - a tip: I started a little short on time, so to jumpstart things a little I followed part of the "quick soak" instructions on the bean package (which is to boil the beans for 2 minutes...).  I pre measured the water to boil them in according to what I would need for this recipe, boiled for the 2 mins, then put everything into the hot crock pot. They were done in about 5.5 hrs.

I have used this recipe many times in the last few years and it is great!  The only change I make is to skip the jalapeno, sometimes I used some green chilies instead; either way it is a very tasty, easy dish to make.  Family loves it.  Can't even compare it to the canned stuff.

Made this a number of times and just use salt for seasoning, once done a quick whip in the nutribullet and use half/freeze half.  Cheaper, healthier and much, much tastier than canned!

Still cooking in the slow cooker... After reading reviews, I'm thinking it may be too salty.. Thinking of adding a peeled potatoes to absorb the excess salt... And maybe a T. Of sugar!

I will never have a can of nasty canned refried beans in my cabinet again, These were incredibly easy and wow they are tasty. I followed some of the suggestions and cut the salt to 2 tsp and used 2 cups of chicken broth + 2 cups of water. Only needed to add another cup of water to the crock. I used my stick blender to mash them to perfect creamy consistency with some small chunkies of bean pieces. I used a split of 50/50 red beans and pintos because that's what I use for my chili recipes. Made pork carnita tacos to go with them and it was a huge hit.

I have been making all my beans in a slow cooker for years. I increase the ingredients some, add chili powder, and replace the water with beef stock  I also use my hand-held mixer rather than a potato masher. Its quicker and easier. If you add a little cooked ground beef or turkey after mashing them and increase the liquid, you have an excellent burrito filling too.

Love this recipe! I don't put the salt in until the end and. After I get it to the consistency I want, I add a couple of cups of shredded mild cheddar! Delish! Thank you Chef Claude!

We went ahead and soaked the beans overnight in cold water, then cleaned and rinsed the next morning.  Never have done dried beans any other way, so??  But followed recipe almost exact: Naturally cut way back on Salt*!* Didn't have fresh Jalapenos, but had one big can of sliced jalapenos, so used some of those, instead.   Added a pinch of sugar, per one reviewer, since salt/sugar do go together to bring up flavors. Can't wait to try this w/homemade chicken stock from Jill's recipe! &/or the Roasted Chk Stock from Chef John (both video's)   Loved mashing them by hand.   ENJOY*

Delicious! I will never buy canned refried beans again! The only issue I had though was based on other reviews I cut the salt back to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I found that it needed more salt and I normally don't salt my food. Next time I will try 2 1/2 teaspoons.

I have been making these refried beans every week since I tried the recipe the first time. I cook them on the stove to cook faster and 1 stick of butter to add a little more flavor.

As advertised! I'm surprised by this recipe. Thank goodness we followed advice and used only 2 tsp salt instead of 5. It is every bit as good as store-bought and is better for us. Plus there's much potential for experimentation by adding more/less spice, jalapenos, vegetables, cheese... We reduced the salt but increased the cumin to 1/2 tsp. We stuck with 1/2 of one jalapeno. It had a tiny zing to it but our 7-month-old baby ate it without pause. We also drained the water but left the onion in and pureed it. We'll be adding this to our regular rotation. No more canned refried beans. Thank you!

I tried this recipe with the only change being half water and half chicken stock. It was very salty. It could be because we don't eat a lot of salt in our house. Next time I will cut down the salt to 2 1/2 teaspoons. Otherwise they were great! Wonderful flavor and consistency. We will freeze some for next time. I may never buy canned beans again! Thank you.

Was looking for a way to get the refried flavor without having to cook it the way my mom taught me. Found this recipe and absolutely love it! So much flavor that I could it the beans alone. Will definitely be adding this to my recipe book and share with the family.

Wonderful and so easy. I mash in the onion for extra flavor and increase the jalapeño. I also add in a little cheese and milk for extra flavoring. I never buy canned refried beans anymore.

Adjusted the serving size to 5 and it was a perfect sized helping for just two people. They turned out so good, I made another batch the next day for my daughters family. We both agree no need to look any further. This recipe is "the one".

My only issue with this recipe was that it was a tad too salty. An easy fix. These are better than any canned refried beans and pretty much as good as or better than) any I've had in Mexican restaurants.

I loved these beans AND they were super easy to make!!! The only change I made was using half of a jalapeno because I like my food pretty spice. I am going to use 2 jalapenos next time because it still wasn't very spicy. Thank you for the delicious recipe!!

I made these for refried beans, but had a lot leftover, so before mashing I put just a drizzle of maple syrup on them and ate them just like that... soooo good!

Made these for my family and it definitely is a great recipe. The only thing I had to look out for is the difference in slow-cookers. My slow-cooker's temp was so high that the beans cooked in 4.5 hours.

Very authentic. I used some liquid smoke and a bit (2 tablespoons) of bacon grease. I also used an electric mixer.

made per directions except without the jalapeno as I did not have one.  If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would as I also thought it a little too salty.  Otherwise good!

Amazing recipe!  So healthy and wholesome - we will never buy refried beans from a can again.  The joy of this recipe is that the beans cannot cook too long as long as you add water if necessary.  Perfect!

Came here looking for spice suggestions rather than technique.  I dumped a can of Great Northern beans into my little Handy Chopper, then added jarred roasted garlic, cumin, salt and pepper (I have jalapenos but they're in the garden and I was pulling this together for a late, LATE night taco salad) and a bit of the canning liquid.  Pulse 'til mushy.  Easy-peasy.  I usually cook beans in the slow cooker (according to Jacques Pepin, if you start out with cold water, you don't need to soak them beforehand), on High for 3 hours or on Low for 8 hours; after 8 hours on High as per the directions, I doubt much mashing would be needed. Might add some onion next time!

Great and easy recipe! I simmer in my Dutch oven over low heat instead of the slow cooker. I've used as a side dish and in burritos.

Followed the recipe except I didn't have a jalapeno. This recipe tasted like tree bark covered with mud with WAYYY too much garlic. Pinto beans have to be the worst bean to use in this kind of recipe. I'm going to try it with black beans and cut down the garlic and salt by about 3/4.

This recipe helped me find the flavor that I was looking for with my Grandmother's beans. But pressure cooker is the only way to go. 2-3 hours vs 8 hours. So efficient.

I love these beans, I make them once a week.  I use 1 less tsp of salt for our taste.  If you aren't in the mood for spicy beans, it still is a great recipe omitting the jalapeno.

These were really good.  I wish I had listed to other reviews and not added the salt until later as they were a little tough - but I will know for next time.  The flavor was great without the calories.  I think I will add a little more jalapeno and some sour cream next time but this is definitely a keeper.

Great pinto beans!  I added some spices to increase the heat factor, we like it hot.  Cayenne pepper, serrano peppers in place of jalapenos, a few shakes of hot sauce and more cumin than directed...very good.  I even forgot about the beans and they ended up cooking for 11 hours instead of 8...they were still good.  We made a bean dip with ground beef, sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa.  We dipped tortilla chips into the dip and enjoyed it very much.  The remaining beans were packed and frozen for future uses.  I will make this one again and again.  No need to pay for canned beans ever again.

I tried this recipe, using less salt. It was fair, but lacked flavor, and really couldn't "stand on its own." Next time I will use some fat in the recipe.

Have made these a few times. Usually just buy the canned so it is nice to have fresh. They freeze well.  Would like to alter a bit to see if I can get a flavor I like even more.

This tastes so much better than canned refried beans. I do put butter in it for a better taste but I still consider it much healthier than the can.

I doubled the cumin and reduced the salt to 2 teaspoons. Used my stick blender at the end just a bit, but still left plenty of whole beans in there, too. They turned out fantastic! No more store-bought refried beans for me!

This is very good, and I will be making them again, but since I had to doctor them up quite a bit I gave the recipe 4 stars.  I added a whole jalapeno, and next time will add 2.  They are very good with additional seasonings added, and bland as written.  But still a very good basic recipe that I will be following in the future.

These are delicious.  I soak them overnight & then drain in the morning to eliminate any bothersome stomach problems they can cause:-)  Also, next time I will cut down on the pepper and cumin.  I left the beans whole; just my preference.

OMG! I will never ever go back to canned refried beans after trying these. After quartering the recipe (there are only three of us), I added two beef bouillon cubes for flavor, and instead of regular salt I used jalapeno salt, which eased the salty flavor everyone was talking about. I used a whole jalapeno (we like it spicy here, lol) and I actually let the beans cook for 10 hours longer, it helped make a bit creamier. My family freaking loves loves loves the amazing flavor and so do I :) Will definitely be adding to the recipe box, lol :)

This is such an easy recipe.  Such a hit.  I was told they were just as good as the Taqueria down the street but were so much better for you.  I will probably never by canned beans again.

These beans didn't get smash for they were so good. That I just fry hamburger meat season with garlic salt and add beans to meat. I did add tablespoon of bacon grease at the start of cooking than after 4 hour of cooking check taste. Decided to add one chicken bouillon cube,some whole mexican oregano,and that cup of water. Also cook on high 4 hours and low for 2 hours .

I used canned beans if I run out of time. I am allergic to soybean oil so this is a great alternative to store bought. Good, easy to make, thanks!

I needed a quick burrito filling and decided to try this recipe. Started cooking at noon - ready by 4:30. I did not have dried beans so I used one can of pinto and one can of black beans, drained and rinsed.  I used 1 small onion, 1 T jalapeno from a jar, 1 T minced garlic, 1 tsp ground black pepper, only used 1 tsp salt, and 1/8 tsp cumin.  I used only 1 cup of liquid which was chicken broth.  I put all in my crock pot on high for 4 hours then just mashed everything right in the crock because the liquid to bean ratio was just right. We ate at 5 and OH MY!!  It was absolutely delicious!!  I couldn't stop "sampling" them after they were mashed - So Yummy!! I will definitely try this recipe as written but for now I'm very happy with my results.  Thank You - No need to ever buy refried beans again!!

WOW!  I just made this recipe.  These were great!  The only changes I made were--I only used half an onion, I used half a can of green chilies, (I didn't have jalapeno), cut salt to 1 teaspoon and I tripled the cumin.  YUM!  I bought canned refried beans just in case.  No need.  I will donate them.  I will be making them from scratch from now on.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

so good. never going back. i use dried black beans bc we just prefer black. I freeze the remainder in a thin layer so we can just break off however much we need for a quick meal. Each batch lasts our family about a month. Talk about economical and the best tasting beans ever!

Flavor, flavor, flavor! couldn't be happier with this recipe. Dropped the salt to 4tsp. since several commented on that and subbed 2 c. chicken broth and upped the cumin to 1/2 tsp. Only issue I had is that my onion did not disintegrate completely as others had mentioned but was simple to dig out before mashing. Very filling and delicious.

This recipe is a staple in my home. I eliminate the salt entirely as it impedes the cooking of the beans (and it's easy enough to salt to taste after they're done).  I also usually swap a small can of green chillies for the jalapeno pepper.  Mine cook on low for about 10 hours and never fail to turn out well.  After mashing I freeze the beans in one cup portions. You can't beat how economical and healthy this recipe is.

The only thing I changed after making this the first time, was I made more the next time!! LOL, everyone loved them. Once I took them to a church pot luck, they went over well. Super easy, and delicious. Since I have made them several times, I just guesstimate the seasonings now. Great every single time. Thank you for this recipe!

I used vegetable broth instead of water and lessened the salt. I cooked in a skillet for a couple of hours (after soaking the beans overnight) and it came out so wonderful! Next time I'll make a bigger batch.

OMG - this is the best beans ever! My 6 year old calls them 'world famous' and loves them in his bean burritos. They are so good, I just eat them in a bowl with some cheddar over top. I will NEVER buy canned refried again!

The best! Much better then any refried bean recipe I have tried.  I have made this twice now and will continue to make it.  You need to reserve the liquid (or keep stock on hand) to keep the beans moist.

It was hard to mash so I put them in the blender with a tad more water.  It came out too watery so the next day when the beans absorbed all the water it was at the right consistancy.  I did not put the last stars because there was something about it that I did not like.  I am not a picky person, I eat ALL types of food.  It is really a 3.5.

I cut WAY back on the salt and added a LOT more cumin since I like cumin.  Next time, I'm going to cut out the salt altogether and use chicken broth or maybe even beef broth instead of just plain water.  The consistency was good though and it's very easy to make.  Just far, far too much salt in it.

I used this recipe as a base, but needed the refried beans in a pinch. Instead of dried beans, I just used a can of pinto beans and estimated the amount of the other ingredients. I omitted the salt, as I am on a low-sodium diet, and the jalapenos since I was mixing it with hot salsa anyway. I used about a cup of water. I just mashed the beans in the pan as I cooked them. It took about 10 minutes. They were delish!

I will NEVER buy refried beans again! This recipe is easy and simple. Instead of using a half an onion, I cut it up so I can incorporate it in with the beans when I mash them. I used less salt and pepper for my taste. Ohhh so good!

These were so easy to make. The hardest part was smashing them bcuz I didn't have a potato masher. I used serrano chiles. I think it needed more flavor. Will add some bacon at the end. I kept it bland because of my little ones, but will definately make again. I reduced the salt. My onion didn't desolve like others mentioned. Will also try cilantro too. Thanks for posting.

YUMMY. I wish I could give this a 10 star as it is so good. Had "the girls" over and they inhaled it. I make a double batch and freeze it. When company comes over it is ready to be heated and eaten!

These were very good.  Next time I will cut back on the black pepper a little bit.  Cooked them overnight on low and they were perfect.  On the advise of others I cut the salt back to about 2 1/2 teaspoons and I thought that was just fine.

LOVE these beans!!  I followed the recipe the first time I made them with the exception of the Jalapeno pepper...didn't have one so used some from a jar.  I have made them since and tweaked spices to taste.  I use a blender to prepare them to desired consistency depending on how I am going to use them.  SOOOO good!!!

Made just as called for and they were SO delish! I added back in about 2c of the reserved broth to get it to the thickness that we liked and still had plenty left over. As this made quite a bit, I froze about 1/2 of it. Will def make again!

This is easy to make. I followed the suggestion to use chicken broth for a portion of the liquid. I used 4 cups since I bought a four cup container and used water for the other 5 cups. I also only used 2.5 tsp of salt. I removed the onion and jalapeno before mashing, but I regret it since I would have liked more flavor in the end result. I will make this again and keep the onion and jalapeno in next time, and perhaps add a little more salt. The beans cook very well and are super easy to mash. It feels good to have control over the ingredients going into my food, so making this dish is well worth a little more effort than just opening a can.

The beans were tasty - very good flavor. Skip draining the liquid and add a little more seasoning and some veggies and you've got a nice bean soup. 

I took a star off because the cook time was way off. The unsoaked dry beans were perfectly cooked after 4 hours on High in my slow cooker - that's half the time called for in the recipe. After 5 hours, I turned it down to low and cooked for another hour and the beans ended up very soft. I know slow cookers vary and mine may be hotter than most. If you knows yours also runs hot, I would recommend checking your beans at 4 hours and again at 6 hours to make sure they don't overcook. With 8 hours on High in my slow cooker, there would have been no need to mash the beans before serving as they would have turned into "refried" beans with a few stirs.

My son is a great cook. He used to spend days making some fantastic black beans. After tasting these, he said he'll never make them the old way.
Great recipe, make a big batch they freeze well.

Fantastic Recipe. I have been making these beans for several years.  After cooking we freeze in small bowls to be used through out the next few weeks. I no longer purchase canned beans and not only do I save money, but I know exactly what I am eating. You can't miss with this recipe. Thanks ChefClaude!

These are wonderful, much tastier than their canned counterparts. I love the recipe as is, but I do change a couple of things to suit my family's tastes. I use beef broth instead of water and so I don't add any additional salt. I also used jarred jalapeno's instead of fresh. I don't use jalapeno's much, so I keep a jar in the fridge for the few times I do need them. I also don't ever end up needing to drain the beans before mashing them. The small amount of liquid left just makes them creamy. YUMMY! Thanks for the great recipe!

Incredible recipe.  I never was a big fan of refried beans, but these, I love!  I have made these several times.  First, they make a lot - enough for 3-4 servings so plan accordingly.  I make it with 2 Mexican dishes as a side and also 1-2 dishes using it as an ingredient in a dish such as burritos/enchiladas or tostados.  Another option is to serve as a dip.  There's a good recipe in these reviews somewhere.  Lastly, this is too salty for my tastes and I love salt.  I use 3 teaspoons and it works great for me.  Besides, you can always add more salt later.

Texture wasn't what I expected, but I am sure there is a reason that those who used black beans used only half black half pinto, unlike me who used all black.  Very tasty, but will try it with half/half next time.

Fabulous - so easy, quick and cheap!  You could do so many things to tweak this recipe to your own tastes, but I find it delicious as written. If you need more flavor, squeeze some lime juice into it or add more cumin. Don't worry about the jalapeno and kids.  My kids are both wusses when it comes to spicy and they don't even notice the jalapeno.  If you like it spicy, add more than one, or keep the seeds.  In our house, we eat the whole batch in about a week.  It's great to have them around when in a rush for quick burritos, nachos, quesadillas, etc.  Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out SOOO good! This recipe makes a LOT of refried beans. I left out the jalapeno and reduced the salt to 4 tsp, and I think it could have even used less salt. Very good recipe.

Really easy.  Really yummy.  WOULD CUT THE SALT THE FIRST TIME YOU MAKE THIS, AND ADD A BIT AT A TIME.  it was odd, cause I've added salt to cereal and ice cream before, but I thought this dish was terribly salty, though my family, who does not have my salt addiction, thought it was fine??  Anyway, I'd still recommending adding salt to taste.

Great flavor . I used the chicken broth and a pinch of canned jalapeños, but had to cook them longer than 8 hrs. I also did a mix of black and red beans.

This is a good base recipes, but needs adjusting to preference. First of all, the jalapeno adds no spice at all and I used a whole one. You'll have to add seeds if you want heat. Also, it is way too much salt. I would say maybe 3TB would be good.

I have used this recipe several times and it's a definite winner! Watch the water to make sure the beans don't dry out, and I usually add a little olive oil and a few bay leaves just for fun.

Perfect, easy, healthy, better than canned!  I make this regularly in large batches, freeze it, always have some on hand for quick meals.  The only change I make it I soak the beans overnight, use a little more cumin, and jarred pickled jalapenos with some of the juice instead of fresh.  so good

Delicious "refried" beans! My husband was raised on authentic Mexican food in El Paso, TX and he loves these. I am trying to make as much as I can from scratch these days with whole, natural foods in order to skip the preservatives in convenience foods, and this recipe makes one regular staple in our house very easy to make. The leftovers freeze beautifully; I add a little of the reserved liquid after draining and mashing to the top of each container to mix in when I reheat them to make sure they are just the right consistency the second time around. I reduce the amount of salt and garlic in ours as personal preference.

My family LOVES these ! We make them about 3 times a month. After having these there's NO WAY we could ever go back to canned. I DO make a couple small changes....I reduce the salt to 3 tsp, I use half chicken broth in exchange for half the water ( sometimes I use boullion) and sometimes if I don't have fresh Jalapeno I use canned. Comes out AWESOME!!!

Much better than canned!  We made as described in the recipe with the addition of a large amount (8 to 16 oz) of pepperjack Velveeta (added after beans were mashed), only 2.5 tsps of salt, and used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water, than put in tortillas with ground beef, pico de gallo, onions, salsa, shredded lettuce, avocado, some shredded Mexican cheese mix and plain greek non-fat yogurt.  Best refry bean tortillas I have ever had.

These turned out to have the perfect texture. The only problem is that it is a little bland. Needs more pepper and spices. other than that, great recipe!

Easy, great tasting recipe!  My husband doesn't eat beans, but when I made him taste these he couldn't stop eating them.  I made them for my son's birthday taco bar party and everyone loved them.

These were wonderful!  My husband said I am never to buy canned again.  I only had to add a 1/2 cup water during the cooking and didn't have to drain them at the end.  Just picked out the jalapeno and onions; mashed them up and served them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These beans are excellent and so easy! Since I love onion, I pureed it with some reserve liquid in a food processor to help get my desired consistency while mashing the beans. It turned out great.

Delicious! Used a small tin of diced chilies instead of the jalapeno and didn't add any salt until close to the end of cooking which I did on the stove.  My crock pot was way too small.  This recipe makes a lot!!!  At the end I drained the beans and pureed them adding bean liquid as needed for the right consistency.  I gave lots away to friends and froze a lot.  Next time, I will try using some chicken stock and add in a little lard or butter.  Once you try these you will never buy those expensive cans of refried beans again!

Deeeelish.  Actually forgot to strain them (ha!) before mashing, but we all enjoyed dipping our tacos in the soupy/creamy beans.  YUM.

This is our go-to recipe. I never buy canned refried beans anymore. I always have the ingredients on hand and now buy dry pinto beans by the large bag. I use 1 teaspoon cumin. I also use jar jalapenos and garlic. I tried using less salt and my family did not like it as well. My old crock pot can handle four cups of beans. I decant off the water when I'm done cooking the beans and use a stick mixer to blend everything. If I use a crock-pot liner, clean up is a breeze. This is the BEST! Thank you, ChefClaude!

These beans are delicious! Better than canned and better than many restaurant's beans. I reduced the salt to 2 tsp and then added about 1 tsp after I had mashed them. Also, used a hand blender and added a dash of cayenne pepper. But they were great without the cayenne pepper, too. I will never buy another can of refried beans.

The recipe is fab!!!  Super easy to make and my family loved them.  However I didn't strain my beans which was a mistake.  I ended up with "bean soup".  I froze the leftovers and when I heated them back up the consistency was perfect.

I didn't know refried beans could be so delicious!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  My boyfriend isn't a big fan of beans but he RAVED about these and asks for Mexican night all the time!  Seriously worth the it - and almost as easy as opening a can.

These beans were SO good! Easy as pie (or beans, rather) to make.  Just put them in the crock pot and when they were done, they were delicious! Full of flavor, and so glad to know it is a healthier option than canned.

Simply delicious! So easy to make also. I also lowered the salt to about 3 tsp.  Thank you from a refried bean lover!

I tried this recipe twice and they did not turn out at all.  I soaked pinto beans over night and cooked them for 9 hrs.  next time I tried a black bean/pinto mix again soaked them.  They turned gray and were really gritty when I put them in my food processor.  I love refried beans and all the reviews say how wonderful and easy these are, so i am soaking black bean right now and am going to try one more time.  I think I need to cook them longer.

YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! 10,000 x's better than the store bought stuff. I'm never ever going to buy the canned  again. Will double the recipe next time to have more leftovers. My boyfriend ate them way too fast!

This is an AWESOME recipe. I love it. I made it for my husbands birthday for 18 and everyone raved about it. I think it's better than the bought stuff now. If you want to make it more of a dip, you can add sour cream. Delish

Very good!!!  Made this last night in my 3 qt slow cooker.  9 cups may have been a little too much water because I had to scoop out about 1.5 cups of liquid in the morning.  Then I used my immersion blender to blend the beans.  Next time I'll use the potato masher because they turned into a puree but it still tastes really good!  I'll add more garlic, cumin and jalapeno next time because the flavor is subtle.  Maybe some taco seasoning next time!

This was excellent!  My husband loved them and thought they were just as good as the restaurants.  I followed everything exactly.  I didn't have 8 hours to let them cook, but they were done after only 4 hours on high.  This is a keeper!!

This was wonderful!  I use this as a basic receipe for beans, adding extra jalepenos and using different kinds of beans.  It freezes well, has no fat and as much salt as I choose to use.

Sounds wonderful but can't review yet. I don't have a slow cooker and was wondering if I could use a dutch oven instead. If so, at what temperature and for how long? Thanks

This worked out just fine but WOW!  Way too much pepper for my taste!  I left out the jalapeno and only put in 1 tsp of black pepper, as I wanted my kids (1&5) to be able to eat it.  As it was, I had to add some sour cream as well as a can of store-bought refried beans and it was still spicy :(  I prefer to have milder beans and the individual can spice it up with Tapatio if they like.  I will try it again, as it was good tasting and very easy, but probably will start out with 1/2 tsp. pepper.

Tasty, but I felt the need to add more salt to the finished product.  Or at least some more flavor.  As a comfort food, this is really good over buttered toast in the morning. Mmmm.

YUM! We ate the beans whole with some Mexican Rice I found here. Made lots, can freeze, or use in several ways. Think huevos rancheros for breakfast, burritos once you've mashed them, or just beans and rice. Very good. Thanks.

I used vegetable broth instead of water & chile peppers as that's what I had. My husband isn't a fan of refried beans, but he said it was passable; he needed more food. I served it with Jasmine rice, which he mixed in with the mashed beans. I didn't eat it as I can't have nightshade vegetables, which are tomatoes, peppers, eggplant & potatoes.

These are excellent!  So much healthier than what you would get from a can or in a restaurant!  I waited to add the salt until they were cooked so I could taste and adjust.  I also used about 4 cups of chicken broth in combination with the water to add a bit more flavor.

Too much salt! Otherwise a great recipe.
I did 5 cups of beans and used 2.25 tsp. LESS salt than called for, and still way too salty. Cut the salt by 1/2 and it will be plenty.

Must reduce amount of salt or wait to add salt in the end - salt to taste. It would be a waste to toss it out after 8 hours of cooking! I had to correct the saltiness by adding some lemon juice and sugar just to rescue it!

Incredibly easy and delicious! I substituted chicken broth for the water and doubled the recipe.  My family loved them - and they're picky!!  Didn't even have to "re-fry" them because they were so thick and delicious right out of the crockpot!  No more canned beans for us - thanks for a great recipe!

Healthy AND delicious! I am not a big fan of onions so I added half an onion instead of a whole and it was still strong. I did not chop the onion up, and removed it from the beans after they were done cooking. I used a hand mixer to blend the beans. THey turned out creamy! YUM!

Made these last night, on LOW for 9 hours, put jalapeno in whole and pulled before mashing.  Mashed 3/4 of beans with hand mixer after ladling out excess liquid then added back in. Shredded reduced fat MJ cheese and perfection!!! I did alter the spices/s/p to our taste. YUMMY!

Great beans.  This is the best and easiest refried bean recipe I've tried.  I reduced the salt to 3 tsp, the black pepper to 1/2 tsp, and put the whole jalepeno in.

I only made half a batch. Still used a whole onion, used hot chili powder instead of the jalapeno (not too much, as my hubby-to-be doesn't like spicy foods), maybe 1/2 teaspoon of salt, used the optional cumin and substituted part of the water chicken stock. It was pretty bland. Used as a 'sauce' on a Mexican pizza and you couldn't taste it at all. Should there be a next time I will season this differently.

These were my first attempt at homemade refried beans.  They tasted great except that I only used 3 tsp of salt and they still seemed too salty to me.  I would start with less and add to taste at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

User error, I seriously over salted this and it was uneatable.  I know you should always error on the side of less salt, but I'm going to be extra cautious next time I try this.

Wonderful!!  I decreased the salt to 2.5 tsp (as recommended by other reviews).  Instead of 9 cups of water, I used 2 cans of vegetable broth and 5 cups of water.

I made this with a slight recommended variation:  I used 2 cups pinto beans and 1 cup black beans, and followed the recommendation for 1/2 the salt.  In my opinion, it should probably have the original amount of salt, as I added it after cooking & cooling.

Wow, these were fabulous!  I didn't have dried beans, so I used a can of pintos. Added adjusted portions of remaining ingredients, plus a healthy pinch of hot chili pepper.  Simmered on stove till all was soft. Then I put it into the processor and had the best refried beans! Thanks for the recipes. It's a keeper!

These beans were so good and creamy. Even my picky daughter was dipping here fingers in it over and over again. The only thing that I found was that it was a little too salty, but hey that's an easy fix.

In Costa Rica we  eat beans almost everyday! The easiest way to cook them is on the pressure cooker.. It's not the most traditional way to do so but if you wanna enjoy them without the 8 hours cooking period then use the pressure cooker! Usually once you hear the whistle of the pot  is around 30 min! I love to add Carrots, celery and stuff like that because we eat them as a soup with rice sometimes. Skip the jalapeno it can be a bit too overpowering in my opinion! Buen Provecho!

My husband and I thought this had the best flavor. I used a whole jalapeno pepper since we like it hot, but even using that it wasn't to much heat. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

This may be the best recipe I have found on this site.  Loved these!  I used a 1# bag of pintos, did NOT soak them, and cooked for about 4 hours on high in the crock pot.  I used about half the garlic, the whole jalapeno, 3 cans of chicken broth in place of the water, and no extra salt.  The beans were wonderful whole and I plan on mashing the leftovers and adding to nachos.  Superb!

I thought these came out very nicely! I was only able to fit 7 cups of water into my slow cooker with the beans and veggies, and anticipated some trouble from that, but it didn't happen. I didn't need to add more water (in fact I should've strained them at the end like it says to, but I misjudged the amount of liquid) and they didn't boil over. They did bubble up and make a racket so don't overfill your slow cooker like I did :-) In the end I found these beans to be rather bland, so I added 1 Knorr brand chipotle cube and that solved the problem. I didn't subtract a whole huge pile of stars for blandness because I mean...c'mon, they're fat-free pinto beans. If you were expecting the lard-soaked restaurant kind, you're doing the recipe a disservice. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I get rave reviews every time I make it. It seems there is always someone who says these are great and I don't even like refried beans. It's easy too which it especially great when everything else on the menu is pretty time consuming.

Amazingly easy! I was very impressed. I don't usually make beans anymore because I didn't like the constant checking of water level. This recipe solved the problem. I did use Knorr chicken and tomato boullion cubes with the water instead of the salt. Amazing flavor. I used the blender but this resulted in runny beans and then had to reduce on stove. Next time will use the potato masher method since that is the authentic way.

I used a 2 lb. package of beans that were in my pantry awaiting to expire.  I cut the salt in half as other reviewers mentioned but I think it would have been better with the additional salt.  There wasn't anything extraordinary about the taste of these beans but I like the no fuss cooking method.  Now, what to do with all these refried beans!

I left out the jalapeno for the kiddos but will try it next time. I feel it's a bit on the salty side and will cut that back to about 1 Tbsp next time. Otherwise, fantastic and definitely will keep these on hand at all times!!

I love these. They taste better than the ones in the can, plus I know exactly what the quality of the ingredients are. Very easy. I cook these overnight.   Oh, and if you use black beans instead of pintos, and keep enough of the juice when you mash them, this makes a fantastic vegetarian black bean soup.

Wow, this turned out great, and it was so easy! The only change I made was to add roasted green chiles, because living in New Mexico I always have them on hand. This made great burritos, and I layered it with guac and hot sauce for a nice dip.

Great recipe for beans.  My husband and I are both originally from New Mexico and grew up on the pinto bean.  Now living in New York we sometimes just want a really good bowl of beans.  Well, we found it.  I put this recipe in the crock pot before I go to work and when I get home, voila, perfect pinto beans.  I did nothing to the recipe and the beans turned out perfect!

These are so good and so easy.  I put in crock pot before bed and they were perfect in the morning.  I just drained and mashed them, put them in small containers and froze.  Very tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used to boil the beans with pork salt and/or bacon in an olla. After I tried this recipe, I converted to this healthier alternative. My mother said the beans had a nice, spicy kick and was surprised how flavorful they were despite no pork additives.

My husband and I both loved these beans.  They are so much more flavorful than the ones from the can and they are extremely easy to make.  Other than adding a bit more spice for some added kick, I made the recipe just as written.  These are a new staple for Mexican Mondays in our home.

Delicious...I used a can of chiles instead of the jalapeno b/c that's what I had, cut the salt in half as suggested, and used 2 smallish onions.  I thought about using my food processor to mash them but used a traditional potato masher instead for better control of how much whole beans were in it.  I also drained the beans very well then added some liquid back in. My whole house and even my yard smelled delicious all day!

These are good!  As written though I think they are bland.  I've made these a few times and previously I've always had a lot of liquid left, and never needed to use much of it.  I think a lot of the flavor is in the liquid.  So today I used 4 cups beans and 9 cups chicken broth.  Later, about 6 hours into cooking them, I had to add 1 cup of water.  When I make these I use 5 garlic cloves, 2 jalepenos ( with a little bit of the seeds) 1 TBSP cumin, 2 tsp chili powder,  and 1 tsp black/red pepper.  I don't add salt until I am mashing them, and I just add enough until they taste good. I also shake a some of that Goya Adobo seasoning in them.  These are a little spicy.  I won't be giving them to our son, but my husband and I like them.  I must say though, I cannot taste the cumin or chili powder, but it must add some kind of flavor right? Adding 1/8 tsp of cumin would be pointless.  This time I used the blender, which worked great because I didn't have jalepeno skins in the beans, which has happened before when I used my handheld mixer.  I blended everything- all the beans and liquid and they are the perfect consistency.

Excellent! I substituted a serrano pepper for the jalapeno because that is what I had on hand. The heat was perfect! Decreased the salt to 2t and used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water based on other reviews.  I will definately make this again.

Wonderful!!!  So easy, so healthy, so delicious.  When done cooking, I dumped the beans into my stand mixer & used the whisk attachment to mash them.  Trying to think of a way this could've been simpler, but I just can't.  I will be making this VERY often; thank you so much for this recipe!

I recently made 14 slow cookers-full of this recipe for a fundraiser dinner. It was very easy to make, and despite being a little bit bland (which can be corrected individually pretty easily), I thought it was very good.   I love that it is simple, much more healthy, and much less expensive than buying by the can (prepared refried). Thanks for this!

These were delicious and I loved them because I know that they are healthier than refired beans!  I halved the recipe because I am only cooking for 3 people and I used about 1 cup of chicken broth in place of some of the water to give the beans more flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, including the salt, and they were perfect.

I love this recipe!  It is so easy and so good!  The only changes I made was cut the salt and pepper in 1/2.  I usually add 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water for more flavor too.  It makes so much that I usually freeze 1/2 of it for later.

These are so easy, cheap and delicious that this will definitely be a staple in my house! I made a few modifications, using jarred jalapenos instead of fresh because my store didn't have any fresh ones. They were great, but the jarred ones do have a slightly different flavor, so I'll try the fresh jalapenos when they're in season. I also used dry black beans instead of pinto because that's what I had. They tasted great and the smell was amazing! My boyfriend, who doesn't even like beans usually, was eyeing up the slow cooker when they had only been in there for a couple of hours because they smelled so good and they tasted as good as they smelled. I think you've converted him:)

Excellent.  I had to cut the recipe down to 2/3 of the original because I only had 2 cups of beans and it worked fine.  I was surprised how much flavor they had and will probably never buy canned beans again! I didn't need 8 hours of cooking, though - mine were done in about half that time, and I only needed to add extra water twice.  I also used a mixture of chicken and vegetable stock instead of plain water to begin with.

I omitted the jalapeno and used 3 tsp salt.  This cooked on low for about 8 hours while I was at work and needed another hour on high before the beans were mushable.  Very tasty. *Update 9/8/10: I've perfected these!  2c. pinto beans/1c. black beans, several cloves chopped garlic, 3tsp salt, 1tsp bl pepper, 1/2tsp cumin and 9 cups water.  High on 7 hours/Low for 2 hours.  I add almost all the reserved liquid back into the beans.  Perfectly seasoned and taste fantastic! *Update 9/13/11: I'm still making these beans at least once a month.  I've gone back and forth with adding black beans to the mix, but my family prefers with just pinto beans.  I've also started adding all the ingredients in the crock the night before and then cooking on low for about 9 hours while I'm at work.  I come home, whirl them in the food processor and voila!  Perfect, low sodium, homemade beans.

Wow, these are fabulous!  I use 1 whole jalapeno seeded and chopped and they're not too spicy, my two year old licks the spoon.  I only cook them for 4-6 hours and they seem just right.  Not sure what they would be like after 8.

Muy bueno!!!  Served as a side on Make Your Own Taco night.  Everyone loved.  Cut back on salt and used a whole jalapeno.  Flavor and texture were perfect.  Be sure to save the extra liquid, which is full of flavor, in order to thin the beans if they get too thick.  Recipe is sooooo easy.  Will never serve canned again.

Loved, loved, loved this!  I was tempted to increase the cumin because I love spice but opted to stick to the recipe.  It was perfectly spicy.  I put two large chicken boullion cubes in the mix instead of regular salt.  Outstanding.

They really do taste like re-fried beans. Its nice to dump stuff in a crock pot in the morning and come home and have dinner half finished! I had to add more salt to the recipe.

I actually bought a slow cooker just so I could make this recipe :)  Per other reviews, I cut the salt to 2 tsp and will probably cut it to 1 tsp, just cuz I'm weird about salt.  Otherwise a fantastic recipe that will be a staple in our house.  I'm going to make tortilla soup with the left-over broth tomorrow!

Wow!  This recipe could not have been easier!  I tweaked this to my own health and to what I had on hand, so no jalapenos, only a sprinkling of ground sea salt and probably 1/8th teaspoon of ground black pepper.  Like others, I substituted a chicken broth paste base for the water. The cumin was whole seed and broke down well during the cooking.  I cannot believe how creamy and flavorful this is without the fat.  Along with other reviewers, I'm never going back to canned again.

Great recipe! Easy, healthy, tasty and I tried several refried bean recipes. I did add a chipole bullion cube which gave it just a hint of hot.

These are super. I've been making these beans for a while now and I increase the amt of Cumin by a few TBS and sometimes I add taco seasoning. I finish it off by adding a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro after its all done. Sometimes I will use half chicken broth and half water to cook the beans in, and sometimes I will use half black beans and half pinto. Sooo tasty!

Every attempt I have ever made at making beans has drastically failed. This recipe is fool-proof. I use half chicken broth for the water and cut the salt to 3t.

This turns out exceptional... Especially for being such a simple recipe. I used two jalapenos, because we prefer a little more bite to our refried beans. Thank you, for sharing such a great tasting recipe.

These made my house smell so good all day long!  The only changes I made were the salt reduction to 3 tsp., switched out half the pinto beans with black beans, and I stuck the jalapeno in whole instead of cutting it up.  They were delicious, though I think I will cut the jalapeno next time because I want them to be a bit spicier.  Also, I will probably double the cumin because I can never get enough of that flavor.  Very satisfying though and very healthy.

these beans are awesome. I added a jar of chipotle salsa (vons/safeway brand), and some butter.  I know the butter might freak some people out, but its way better than lard which is in most of the canned beans. Taste it though, see if it needs it, and if it does add it when your mashing them.

Fabulous!  I left out the jalapeno because my preschoolers don't like spicy, but there are great.  And SO much cheaper to make than store-bought.  With a 25lb bag of pintos in my pantry, I'll be making these whenever we have a Mexican dinner.

Awesome and so easy!  I dropped the salt to 3 tsp and left out the jalapeno since I didn't have one on hand and put in 1 heaping tsp ground cumin.  I also cooked on high for six hours and had to add another 1 1/2c of water since my cooker is so efficient and then cooked on low the other 2 hrs.  They came out perfect and you can always add extra salt when mashing to taste if you like it saltier.  We used them for tostadas and I think I will make a 7 layer dip out of the rest for the super bowl this weekend.  But I'm happy to hear they freeze well too!  Great recipe!

FANTASTIC Recipe! - Great as a bean dip too.  I made this exactly according to the recipe and I love it! Way too easy. This is a definite keeper! It makes a great bean dip too. For dip I just warm some up in the microwave and enjoy!

This was a really great way to make "refried" beans. I love that it's vegan friendly too =] I would add less salt to taste, but that's just me.   Thanks!!

Comparable to what you find on the menu at your favorite Mexican restaurant and much, much tastier than the canned variety (sorry Rosarita). Made it as the recipe listed, but I would have liked a little more pizazz. Still, I will definitely be making these again and again and again...

I made these with 3/4 cup black beans(only had 2 1/4 cups of pinto beans on hand), 1 teaspoon chili powder in place of the jalapeno, and added 1 tablespoon of sugar. They came out delicious, and I'll be using this recipe from now on whenever I want refried beans. The slow cooker makes this so easy, thanks for a great recipe!

Wow!  These are fantastic.  And so easy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I threw in the whole Jalapeno and it made it almost too spicy, but alright for our family.

This was wonderfull. What I did was cook as directed only instead of  jalepenos I used a can of green chilies. After it was done, I strained them, reserving the juice, then split the beans in half to freeze some as whole beans, then mashed the rest. They were great in my Enchiritos and on the side as refriend beans. Will make many times as a side dish to my mexican food main courses!

The cumin is a must!  I only used 2 tsp of salt, and it was enough since I used it in burritos and had sharp cheddar on top.  It is a great tasting, cheap, AND easy recipe.  What more could you ask for?

Easy and delicous! I've made this at least three times in the last month for different meals and everyone loves it. I have done it a little differently each time adding different spice to try to get it just spicy enough for my burritos and no matter what i do they turn out fantastic! I love how healthy these are, they fit perfectly into my weight watchers plan.

This recipe was great and so easy. The hardest part was draining the liquid from the cooked beans, but my husband helped. I used my magic bullet to blend the onion into a puree and mixed it into the beans after cooking. The beans would have been a good soup if they would have been done around dinner time. But I just mashed them all. Had so much that I made a yummy 7 layer dip with some of the beans. I will absolutely make this recipe again.

These are excellent!  I doubt I will buy canned again.  I did not have jalapeno, so added a couple dashes of Tabasco.  Used 7 cups of water and one 8 oz. can tomato sauce, only one tesaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon cumin.  When they were done, I did not have to strain the beans, just mashed and they were a great consistency.  I used a lot of spoons, because as it was cooling, I had to keep tasting it, with a sprinkle of salt each time.  I doubt I will use all of these for tomorrow's lunch, so I am going to freeze the rest and see how that turns out for a later meal.  Thank you for this recipe.

I love making this recipe and waking up to fresh beans in the morning.  I usually take a scoop of beans to eat with eggs before I mash them.  Any undisolved onion easily mashes.  The jalapeno pepper is not strong with what the recipe calls for.  Saving a fair amount of reserve is important so you can add it as needed.

Great recipe and so economical!  Rosarita refried beans are $1.99 at my local market so it's just the most money saving way to make my favorite beans and they are healthier too.  Muchas Gracias!

I loved the consistency, but overall the flavor was a little dull to me.  I added cumin and some garlic herb seasoning during the mashing. I would make these again if I needed A LOT of beans.

Made this for a taco party, and everyone loved it!  They said they were the best beans they had ever had!  Made them the exact why the recipe stated and it was so easy!!

I love this recipe! I used beef broth instead of water and put extra jalepeno in. I freeze the leftovers for the next time we have mexican.  I also reduced the amount of salt.  Thanks Chef Claude!

Amazing - I substituted chicken stock for water.  Then took part out and heated up with cheese, milk and a little bit of Crisco - everyone loved both versions.

Very good!!!  I made these the other night and they were just as good heated up today.  I took some advice from other members and used a can of diced green chilis and I didn't have chicken broth, but I used chicken boullion with the water to make the broth.  I omitted the salt.  My kids loved them.  While mashing them with my wonderful kitchen aid, I added about 1/3 cup of butter instead of the liquid.  You know butter, it makes EVERYTHING better :)

These are fantastic!  The best part was that all you have to do is put them in the crock pot and walk away, can't be easier!  I did use all black beans, because that was all I had on hand and it worked perfectly.  Can't wait to try this with pinto beans :)

Awesome! I used all black beans and replaced six of the nine cups of water with vegetable broth - and it turned out amazing. I used garlic powder (which didn't add much taste) and would have preferred more cumin. But all in all - best refried bean recipe ever!

These are amazing!  I left out the jalapenos and used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper.  I also decrease the amount to 1 1/2 tsp.  Also reduced salt to 3 tsp.  My husband and kids love it.

I just made this recipe on Sunday and got all good reviews.  I actually don't like beans whatsoever and don't eat them at all but my boyfriend loves them so I looked for an easy recipe to make them for him.  I did what other reviewers said and did 1/2 pinto and 1/2 black beans and it went over really well.  My boyfriend and my family loved them......thanks so much for the recipe :o)

very versatile.  i have made this three times since getting the recipe off of the site.  first time exactly as written,  it was a little too spicy for my tastes but there was none left at my family gathering.  Second time used less jalepeno and put a little chili powder in after mashing,  very good. Third time used a little butter, and a tblsp of sour cream.  topped with cheese at the end it was super good.

Wonderful!  I was pretty daring, I have never made refried beans before and made these for 20 guest, they turned out SUPERB!!!  I used a can of chiles instead of jalapenos and used more garlic and more cumin.  They were delish!!!

I love this recipe. it is super easy and the resulting beans are flavorful and creamy. I reduced the salt by half and used the whole jalepeno pepper. I have used these beans spread over corn tortillas and toped with a poached egg for breakfast, as a dip with chips, and in burritos! these are fantastic!

These where yummy.  Who knew mashed beans could taste so good?  I used the black beans I had on hand and used half chicken stock & half water.  It made a huge amount. Used part to make a layer burrito dish and ended up freezing the rest.  I agree with other reviewers...cut back on the salt.

These were great. I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by the quality of their refritos, and these would not disappoint. I love the fact that they're fat-free. One note: the onions get a little slimy after slow cooking. If you were to eat these whole instead of mashed, yank the onion before serving.

i make these all the time!! we love them. i usually freeze half or so but i may as well not because we always eat them all so quickly! and i'll be honest- i mess up the calorie count by adding about a tablespoonful of bacon grease to them while in the crockpot- it makes them even more creamy and adds a wonderful flavor.

THis was sooo good.  I made some small modifications to suit my taste.  I reduced the amount of salt, added some chili powder and chopped up a whole jalepeno.

This recipe was just ok for me. It was very flavorful, but a little too much kick in my opinion. I cooked the beans for 8 hours and they still weren't as soft as they should be so be sure you test them before you mash. Also, I would use whole split cloves of garlic, so that it could be removed before mashing. There was way too much garlic flavor in my beans to taste authentic.

These are the BEST refried beens I have ever had. I cooked mine in chicken stock instead of water. I also needed them fast so I did the quick soak method and then cooked on the stove top! It was hard going with the potato masher so I put them in the food processor. Everyone raved about how good they were!!! I will never buy canned again!

Easy and yummy! I added a ham hock and omitted the salt. I made nachos out of the leftovers and the beans were even tastier the next day. Big hit with the family.

I loved this.  I used chopped green chilies instead of jalapenos because that's all we had but it still turned out fabulous.

I will never buy canned again!  This is cheaper and is actually delicious by itself, not just as another ingredient for the burrito.  The only change i made was to use my homemade ham broth instead of plain water.

I make these a lot. I have made with water, and with chicken broth, and there is no mistaking that the broth is best. I always use cumin, and chili powder, and when cooked and ready, I use a large spoonful of Goya's Manteca. The flavor this adds in unreal. In Mexican households, that is the way to do it.

This is a great recipe. It is a hit with everyone, no matter where I serve. It's so easy to make and the taste is quite authentic. It's especially nice when cooking for folks on restricted diets, since it is fat-free. I usally save extra 'broth' in case I have left-overs, so I can add some when I reheat.

Fantastically delicious!  I reduced the amount by 1/3 and used 2 cups of beans and accordingly decreased all measurements by roughly 1/3.  The only change I made was the addition of one bouillon cube.  I cooked the beans on low (my slow cooker tends to get too hot so I did not bother with high heat) and the beans were ready in the time in the recipe.  I did not mash the beans, however.  I ended up surving them whole with their sauce over Mexican rice.

Absolutely delicious!  If you find you don't have the full eight hours, you can bring the beans to a boil and then add them to the crockpot with fresh water and the other ingredients.  Every time I make these I add something different (chopped tomatoes, a can of diced chiles, etc).   I love, love, love this recipe!

Delicious! I usually buy the Old El Paso refried beans from the can. These are comparable, even better tasting and extremely easy to make! I only used 1 tbsp of minced garlic and used a dash of chili flakes instead of adding the jalapeno pepper. Also, they do seem a bit salty and I only added 4 tsp. of salt. Next time I think I'll only use 2-1/2 tsp. of salt. Great, easy recipe! I'll definitely be making these again, and again!

These came out better than I expected, but they're not quite up there with *real* refried beans.  The flavor was a little bland (which can be fixed post mashing, to some degree) and the texture wasn't quite as smooth without the fat.  Still, much cheaper and healthier than the canned ones.  I froze half the batch and when thawed, they were a little on the thin side, but still usable for most purposes.

I double the cumin, and make 2-3 batches. I then mash and put in quart freezer bags, so we always have some on hand.

I LOVE these and have made them a few times now. I use half the garlic and only a teaspoon of salt(I only add salt after the beans are tender). I use pickled jalapeno slices-about 5 slices- which are easier and the bit of vinegar adds great flavor. I use my hand blender but don't completely blend everything. I add some cheddar cheese right before serving and I make my homemade soft tortillas. Some lettuce and onion on the side--nothing better!

I used chicken broth as well.  I used the slow cooker but I did it for 4 hours on high because I didn't have the whole 8 hours to wait.  My husband raved about them!  He said to make those over canned ones always.

This recipe rocked! I omitted the cumin, used 1/2 serrano pepper (because I prefer serrano peppers) and have thought about adding a slice of bacon for additional flavor. The beans are very tender and you can mash to your desired texture.

My 16 year old loves Mexican food, especially refried beans. She made this recipe to go along with chicken chimichangas. We agreed they tasted as good as her favorite Mexican restaurant. It was great to be able to throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker and forget about them for awhile. It takes advance planning but it's worth it. We also found that it was important to have the extra broth, as the recipe states, to keep the beans from being too dry.

Wow!  Soooo yummy!  One hint....the reserved liquid was so tasty I heated in a saucepot and added small shell pasta for a unique soup offering.  Again, the beans are awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.

These did not turn out good for me.  I actually add two seeded and chopped jalapenos to get more flavor.  But they turned out to be very bland.

These beans were wonderful.  I am living abroad and can't buy the canned type, so I cooked these overnight in my crock pot, and then mashed them up to make them smooth.  They smelled wonderful as they cooked.  I might cut down on the onions, but my variety may have been a little stronger than some.  I made a delicious layered bean dip with these and all my guests loved it.

Oh.. My.. God!! These are fantastic!!! My kids didn't like me trying to replace the canned beans they are used to, and every recipe I tried they thought tasted "too bean-y". But this is phenomenal!!! My hubby and kids will even look for leftovers in the fridge to heat up just for snacking. Praise to you!!!!!!!

I really like this recipe with one exception- not soaking the beans in water overnight gave me terrible gas! If I soak them there doesn't seen to be a problem though.

They were good but I think I would have preferred more flavor and zip.  I will make them again.  I loved that you could make them in a slow cooker.  Also, I tried mashing them down with a spoon because I didn't have a potato masher and they were still lumpy.  Not a big problem, still yummy, but something worth noting.

Super good, super easy and super cheap. We loved these beans.  We have eaten as  a dip, in taco and burritos.  The rest I froze in meal size containers.  I did add extra spices.

I've had this bookmarked for well over a year. I'm kicking myself for not making it sooner! I softened the onion and garlic in bacon grease in the crockpot before adding the beans and seasonings. I used a whole diced jalapeno because I didn't think half would provide much heat. Everything was done after about 4 hours on high. I'm never buying canned refrieds again. Good stuff. Thanks!

I really like these beans, 5 stars.  My husband gives them 3.5-4 stars. I left out the jalepeno to make them kid friendly, but that would probably increase the rating for him. The second time I made them I forgot to drain the liquid off before mashing and they're a little soupy but still quite good.  I just refried them a little longer.  I am thrilled to find out home-made refried beans can be so yummy and healthy and cheep and easy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Beware of the salt!!! If it werent for that Id give it a 5. I only used 3 tsp per anothers suggestion and Im glad I didnt use all 5 teaspoons. I also wasnt crazy about the garlic taste and I only used 1 tblsp per anothers suggestion. Next time I will leave the garlic out alltogether. I pureed it in a blender. SO nice to find a healthy recipe using NO FAT! And you cant even tell wow. mmm mmm thanks for the recipie. Bean burritos here I come.

Easy, simple and tasty.  What more could you ask for?  I use refried beans a lot in the morning so next time I will reduce the amount of garlic I use.  But if I'm making it for dinner I will increase the jalapeno and add a little more cumin.

This is very easy to make.  I only give it 4 stars because I thought the onion was too much...I cut it in half the second time I made it, and was much happier.  I agree with others that you can use much less salt than called for.

This was the best AND healthiest "refried" bean recipe I've made!!!  I followed others advice and used half chicken stock half.  I didn't have fresh peppers so just threw in some sliced peppers from a jar.  I did add extra cumin and a little orgeno based on our taste.  I froze the extras and plan on making at least once a month!!!

Suprisingly didn't love it. I added green chilis, a bay leaf, used half chicken stock (as recommended) and even after cooking it for almost 24 hours it wasn't my favorite. I won't be making this again.

This is an excellent way to save money and use the beans sitting in the cupboard.  These are tastier than what comes out of the can and much healthier.

Had some neighbors over.  Made the recipe just as it is written.  My company loved it & even the kids who don't usually eat the beans.  Very easy & makes a good amount.  We had leftovers after serviing 4 adults & 4 small eaters!

Liked this a lot.  I would say it was a good base.  Next time, I will add quite a bit more seasonings as it ends up being a tad bland, but it was fun to make in the crockpot and my husband really liked it.

I was looking for a good refried bean recipe and came across this one. It was great!!! Very easy and tasted terrific. I substituted hot sauce for the jalepeno since I did not have one and also used half chicked broth. We have tasted alot of refried beans living here in Phoenix and this is better than many restaurants. No canned beans again. This is a keeper!

YUM!!! These are the best refried beans ever. I doubled the recipe because I had two functions to take them to in two days. This recipe makes so much though that I really didn't need to do that. There's so much flavor in them. Much better than our fave Mexican restaurant...and I'm sure much healthier too. I'm hooked. Thanks!

I did add like the  others suggested some chilli powder, garlic and didn't really measure how much.  Also I ussed canned jalapenos and I never measure so I know I put more in but awesome is all I can say.

I was a little suspicious of this recipe since there's no actual "refrying" of the beans (certain dishes shouldn't taste TOO healthy!)  BUT, we thought that this was great, although it didn't necessarily look that great!  Very tasty...I was happy to just eat the beans as is when they first finished cooking.  We only cooked them for about 5 hours for lack of time, but they seemed to turn out just fine.  Looking forward to making this recipe again with a few tiny changes to hopefully achieve a better-looking result!

Wow!  these taste so good!  My only suggestions, if you have kids who don't like spice you will have to cute out all the spices.  I didn't do the jalapenos, but I did add pepper and cumin.  My husband and I tasted it and it seems a bit spicey for our kids.  Next time I make it will have to cut back on the pepper and omit the cumin totaly.
My kids like everything plain and they will still enjoy the beans with just onion, garlic and salt.  Spice is not necessary because the beans are just so darn good alone.
I did buy organic beans as well, yummy!  I can't wait to eat these up.
I am also going to freeze some to see how they take to freezing.

My daughter eats refried beans several times a week, and I feel better making them from scratch with this recipe and knowing what's in them! I don't use the jalapeno because I serve them to my kid, and I'm playing with the the water/chicken broth ratio, but this is a great recipe to use as is or play with!

This was fantastic I made this to accompany Jays Jerk chicken. This was great. We recently aquired a nanny from El Salvador so I wanted to make a welcome dinner for her. She ate thirds! She never ate seconds of any meal I made for the family. This is a keeper! I did not have to cook for 8 hrs. About 6 hrs. Definetly keep the liquid to mash with the beans!

YUM! I only had half an onion, so I used some onion powder. I also reduced the salt to 2 tsp based on some other reviews. This is a much healthier version of the canned beans and more delicious too!

I am making my homemade enchiladas tonight with refried beans, little taco meat and cheese.  I always made my beans from scratch but NEVER really liked them.  I just thought I'd try these and they are FANTASTIC just like my favorite mexi restaurant.  I didn't change one single thing.  And they took  me 3 hours from start to finish.  Thank you so much.  No more canned Rosarita for us ever.

These are sooooo easy and VERY good.  I halfed the recipie because I wasn't sure how much 15 servings was.  Next time I will make it all and freeze some!  My 5 year old even liked it and doesn't usually like beans.  My company asked for the recipie!

These beans tasted great and were super easy to make.  If you like a litte flavor add more jalapenos or other peppers.  Next time I would cute the recipe down A LOT simply because it was just for me & my husband...

These couldn't be easier or tastier. I did not use the jalapeno - used a couple of shakes of hot pepper sauce instead. Reduced the salt to 1 Tablespoon.

I have been making refried beans for years but have never been totally happy with the results. I just made this recipe today and they are delicious.  Very flavorful.  The only changes I made was I did a fast soak and then cooked then on the stove with only 6 cups of water.  Also, i did not have a jalapeno pepper so I used hot pepper sauce.  I will definitely be making refried beans using this recipe from now on.

This was pretty good and very easy, a little bland but I like this recipe as a base recipe then season according to the meal etc. Very simple and much more healthy than regular refried beans.

I didn't think these tasted any better than the canned beans I usually get made from just pinto beans and salt, but they were definitely cheaper.  Next time I will double the jalapeno and try using chicken broth for some of the water.

These were very good but better doctored with salsa, sour cream ect.  I'm also not sure about the energy in terms of electricity required for a slow cooker on high for eight hours, trying to be green and all.  Thanks for sharing!

Waaay too salty!!! I made it with chicken broth instead of water but still way to salty, next time I will use just a tiny bit of salt and still with chicken broth probably...other than that they were pretty good....I ended up making a bunch of nacho cheese dip with them.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! I would give this one 10 stars if I could!! The only thing I did different was reduce the salt to 2 teaspoons, and I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes. These were the BEST refried beans I have EVER tasted! My picky 2-year-old had 2 helpings! Thank you SO much for this recipe!!!

These were fantastic.  Well worth the time.  I also used chicken broth and I soaked my beans overnight and the beans were done in about 3+ hours. I doubt if I'll ever used canned again unless I was in a hurry.  The only thing I think I may do next timeis add more pepper as we enjoy a little more "bite" and I could barely taste the pepper in it.  Otherwise fantastice recipe.  We served these with the Authenic Enchilada Verde on this sight and what a fantastic meal.

I skipped the jalapeno because I don't have it, and, well, let me just tell the person who shared this recipe that there was NONE left in the pot! My kids are ages 4-7 and they ate it like it was the best stuff in the world. That NEVER happens around here. This was a great recipe! I made it with chicken stock and can't wait to cook it again.

I've never made refried beans before because it requires so much attention. This one looked so easy to make, I couldn't pass on trying it out. Healthier than pan fried, the beans tasted very good. A+

These were perfect! I have tried & tried to make refried beans, but could never get it right.  I finally got it right.  Maybe a little less salt next time is the only thing I would change.  I used 1 can of chicken broth in place of some water.  So good & Fat Free???  A keeper!!

This really was a great recipe. Good idea with the chicken broth instead of the water - but even with the water they were fine. 

I just dumped all of it into my crockpot and let it cook for the day. 

I usally only get mine from the can - so of course anything is better than that. What I liked most about it is that you strain the water from the beans and then add it back in and it just keeps making them creamy-er and cream-er!!

Didn't use too much cumin though - not a huge fan.

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  I had never made refried beans before.  The only changes I made were to cut down the salt (others said they are too salty), substitute some of the water for broth.  Very tasty, although could use a little more seasoning.

So easy, and so yummy! I top these with cheese, add some homemade flour tortillas, and my 2 year old LOVES them! It is very good to use chicken broth instead of water, or add a couple of chicken bouillon cubes to the water. I highly recommend, especially if you have little ones!

The beans were great but not "the Best." They definitely need more seasoning - i would use the whole jalapeno, onion, and more garlic.  I would also cut the salt down to 2 tsp.  I used almost 4 and it was way too much as others stated.

I don't know what I did wrong except naybe adding too much extra water (a cup) during cooking but I thought these were really bland! The method is great and porduces a good consistency which didn't give me that slightly icky tummy feeling that the canned ones do, but I was disapointed by the flavour and had to add quite a lot more flavouring (cumin mostly). I will def do it again but with lots more seqasoning to start wth - maybe even triple the amount.

These beans actually come out with such a great flavor I couldn’t believe it!!  I make a batch of these at least 3 time a month and use them for lunch and dinner several times throughout the week.

Very good and very easy! So much better than canned refried beans. I had to add more spices though, but will make again,

This has got to be the smartest refried bean recipe ever!  I make this to go with chicken enchiladas and end up with enough leftovers to use for tacos later.

These beans were so easy to make and delicious that even my picky 10yr old absolutely loved them. I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth. This is definetly a keeper!
