I have to admit, when I mixed the sauce for this dish together, I was pretty skeptical.  Two cans of condensed soup and a packet of onion soup mix is a lot of processed food, and mixing it with coconut milk just seemed . . . odd.  Odd and a little wrong.  But I'm always on the lookout for interesting slow-cooker meals, so I gave it a shot.  Really, it's not half bad.  Completely unlike any curry I've ever had, except for the curry powder, but not half bad.  Taste-wise, it probably deserves four stars, but I'm giving it three because I still find the heavy reliance on processed ingredients disturbing (as well as the sodium content - yikes!)  That said, it was easy and my husband liked it, so I might make it again.  Definitely doesn't need that extra 1/2 tsp of salt, though; there's plenty in the three soup products.

I made this and didn't rate it since I changed it SO MUCH but I saw another reviewer with questions and thought I'd answer them. I don't use any cream of anything soups or soup mixes - too much processed food gives me migraines - so I did it all from scratch. I melted a hunk of butter(2 tbsp-ish) in a pan, sauteed the onions and some carrots and celery in the pan, then added 2 tbsp flour - cooked the flour a bit till it all had color. I added the can of coconut milk when I'd have normally added milk (I'm used to making country gravy). I added the spices tasted it - it was a little bland because of the lack of onion soup mix, so I spiced it up a little - salt, pepper, garlic, and the peas then dumped it over the cut on chicken in the crock pot and let it cook. Same general idea but without the migraine.

I'm Keon (the creator of this recipe). Glad to see so many people enjoying it! I'm from Texas and like SPICY dishes, so you may want to tone down the cayenne if you don't like spicy as much as I do. Also, to reduce the sodium, you can use the low sodium soups. Enjoy!

I love curry and this turned out very good. My guests couldn't believe how it was made. 1/2 t of cayenne was enough for us. Simple and direct. Don't like reviewers who don't try the original recipe 1st...

This recipe was amazing!  I have never tried to cook curry at home before, so I will also add that the recipe is very easy to make.  The only changes that I made were doubling the recipe and using half of the required cayenne pepper.  Even with half, it was still very spicy, but not unbearable.  I also substituted frozen chopped spinach for the peas--and that made it even better.  I served it with basmati rice and made enough for leftovers all week...I am on day four and not even tired of it yet!

This was a delicious recipe.  I do not like my curry fire-hot, so I only used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of the recommended 2 tsps.  Next time I will start with 1/4 tsp. I doubled the peas.  It was easy to make and will become a favorite in our home.  Thank you Keon!

Ok, I have not eaten this yet, as it is in the crockpot right now...I have to tell you I could not wait to review this.  the sauce itself was delicious!!!!  Here is what I did.  It is a snowy day here in N. Virginia so I did not have all the ingredients on hand and grocery store, only 1 mile away, was not an option.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and placed in bottom of crockpot.  I did not have cream of mushroom soup, so I just doubled the cream of chicken soup.  I did not have coconut milk and after research online ended up just using sourcream.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 5, but only used 1 tsp of cayenne.  I placed baby carrotts on top of the chicken and poured the curry sauce over.  It has been cooking for almost 3 hours now and smells heavenly!!!! I usually don't like reviews when people have not tried or made the recipe, but I am positive this one is gonna be a keeper.  Gonna serve with rice and steamed veggies.  I'll check back after dinner and let you know how the family rates it...

This is excellent if you like curry, but do NOT add 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper. We only added 1 tsp and it was still too hot and we eat very hot things all the time. We'll use 1/2 tsp next time, you can always add more.

This was an amazing recipe!  We are huge fans of anything curry.  My husband is Jamaican and he devoured this dish.  You can adjust the cayenne to your taste, but aside from that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I had my doubts, but it was pretty good.  I realized as I was prepping the recipe, I was missing some ingredients, so I made quite a few changes, but it was still a hit with my husband.  I was a little concerned with the amount of sodium, so I used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of coconut milk, 1 can of evaporated milk, 1/2 packet of onion soup mix, 2 TBSP. of curry powder, 1 TBSP of garam masala, a pinch of cayenne pepper, &  the juice from 1 lime.  We don't like peas or mushroom, so I substituted chopped red & yellow bell pepper.  I will note that the coconut flavor is lost when you cook it.  You can smell it, but can't taste it.  I cubed up 6 chicken breasts & there was still plenty of sauce leftover.

Next time, I will leave out the evaporated milk & add another can of coconut milk an hour before serving so I can taste the coconut.  Also, I might try some sriracha instead of the cayenne pepper & a hint more lime.

We thought this was an awesome recipe.  I agree, there was a lot of sauce so more chicken would work well.  Next time I may try boneless thighs cut up.  I did add a can of chick peas and tripled the curry powder and added more cayenne as we like it hot.  It was great and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks again for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  Definitely better the second day.  I prefer a stronger, 'cleaner' curry taste.  Next time I'll leave the onion soup mix out.

I totally felt guilty making this for my family due to the amount of processed stuff in it, but it looked tasty  and easy and it was--.  I had no cream of chicken soup, so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead.  I didn't dice the chicken beforehand because I wasn't thinking straight but it didn't matter.  I had no mushrooms and used 2 cups of peas- could have used more.  I cut the cayanne down to 1/2 tsp and it was still slightly too spicy for my 4 and 6 year old.  I will use 1/2 tsp of cayanne if I make this again.  I also added an extra cup of water because my cocunut milk was looking really creamy.  We had a lot of sauce left over.  Will add another breast or 2 next time.

I tried this recipe today to bring to my "guinea pig" co-workers. It was a hit! As others have written, I left out the additional salt, and only used 1/2 tsp cayenne to accommodate wimpy midwestern taste buds, and that was the right amount in all our opinions. This recipe is definitely a keeper--thanks Keon!

i would say 4.5 stars if i could... almost perfect. a huge hit every time i make it, altho yeah, way too much cayenne pepper for most people (and i love spicy-hot foods). i cut the cayenne to just a sprinkle or two and add potatoes to make it heartier. YUM!

Really good! I found it a little spicy hot so next time I'll use a little less cayenne pepper, the 2 tsp was too much and I like spicy.  I also thought the curry sauce was a little thin and would most likely try to thinken it. But def. a keeper recipe thanks so much for sharing it!!

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe.  It smelled good, and I was so excited to taste it, but it was too salty and I am glad I cut the Cayenne pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon because it was still a bit spicy (and we like spicy!)

It was pretty good. Inspired by Thai yellow curry recipes, I traded the mushrooms for yukon gold potatoes & some carrots. It was hard to tell if the dish tasted all that well because the spiciness was overkill & that is coming from someone who loves seriously spicy food! If I decide to make this again then I will most definitely cut the cayenne pepper in half.  Otherwise it was a good, very easy recipe!  Also, I cut the chicken breasts into small pieces & laid them at the bottom of the slow cooker instead of using whole breasts. I served it over white rice & my husband loved it (although he also suggested that I go easier on the cayenne if I make it again).

Wow.  That was some DELICIOUS curry.  I cut the cayenne in half and it was just right.  Also, it makes a lot of sauce, so I'd add more chicken.   This is definitely going in our recipe rotation.  Thanks, Keon!

it certainly has potential. Since I am an avid cook of and lover of Indian food (hubby is Indian) then it may be unfair for me to pass judgment here. However, if you want quick and easy, I say do this recipe.  My guess is everyone should continue their attempts until tweaked to their own perfection/taste.  

I served with (what else) Basmai rice. Thanks Keon!

I wish we could give this 4 1/2 stars! DH & I liked it a lot. I did cut the cayane pepper in half and will use even less next time. Wonderful flavor! I will make this again!

I made a few customizations (see my saved customized recipe) like subbing vanilla soy milk because I was out of coconut, dropping mushrooms because my family doesn't like them and adding potatoes to stretch the recipe (along with additional chicken). But none of the changes were really material - so this recipe *definitely* warrants 5 stars. My Jamaican husband said this is the best chicken curry he has ever had ... that is a HUGE complement! Thank you so much for this recipe, now I have something to share with my mother-in-law! =)

Didn't add cayenne pepper since my 2 year old would be eating it. Added peas, 1 tbsp of cumin, 3 tbsp of Orange marmalade, and shrimp 10 minutes before serving with Jasmine rice. Delicious!

I thought this was very tasty! But DO NOT add 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper - WAY TOO HOT and I normally like spicy. But this was super yummy. Thank you Keon for a new favorite!

This is a great Indian recipe that is easy - typically Indian recipes take time.  I scaled back the cayenne pepper a lot (only used 1/2 teaspoon) as my husband doesn't like spicy.  It was the perfect amount.    Next time, I'd add some garam masala simply and maybe some canned tomatoes just because I prefer a red curry sauce and love the taste of garam masala.  Also thinking I'd add some potatoes.  Excellent dish.

I feel bad reviewing this so low, but neither my husband and I liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the cayenne. Maybe it was just us, or maybe I did something wrong, but not a hit at our house. I was so sad.

This was different and interesting, but something was just not quite right about it.  I'm not sure if it was the way it looked, or the texture, but it was not very appetizing to me, although my husband did like it.

This was the best recipe I have ever made!  The only thing I changed was the cayenne pepper (less of it) and I added more chicken.   My husband LOVED it.  I brought it to work the next day and everyone loved it!  I had my doubts when I was mixing the ingredients together but it was amazing!

Very good.  My crock gets super hot even on low so I only put the soups, milk, some sliced serrano peppers and chicken in with a little water and let it cook overnight.  This morning I added the onion soup and seasonings and let it go another 20 mins or so to blend.  It was fabulous!  I doubled the recipe and have enough for the next couple of days!

Ok, I gave this 5 stars because it was not only I that like it, but everyone in my office!! I even got a hive five for it! LOL! Anyway used everything it called for, although I did add a little more pepper and used portobello mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of curry however this is one that I loved, and will def make again for sure. Thanks for sharing.

I thought the sauce would be way too watery and too much of it if I used whole cans of each cream soup, so I decided to use only one half can of each.  I decreased the amount of cayenne to 1 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. of my homemade garam masala spice blend.  This was very tasty and had just the right amount of heat for us.  Thanks for a very easy curry recipe.  I would make it again.

As written this recipe was just ok. It was way too salty and a little too hot, even though I left out the cayenne. I only did 2T of curry powder and I thought that was a little much, also I ended up having to add some sugar to cut the saltiness and salvage this dish. I also didn't see the need for the onion soup mix in this, I didn't taste it and it just seemed to add salt. I'll make this again but with lots of alterations.

This recipe is awesome. After reading the other reviews, I decided to reduce the cayenne to about a 1/2 tsp (because my stomach can't take the heat, even though my tongue likes it!) and I added four potatoes and four carrots to my crock pot. I just finished making it, and it tastes awesome. No more curry chicken wrap take-out for me! I will be eating this all week for lunch over rice and in wraps.
I gave it only four stars because of the sodium content. It's just a bit too high. Next time I make it, I'm going to try to reduce it by using low sodium soups.

The smell of this curry through the house all afternoon has been driving me mad - smelt so good. Taste wise, it was a different than I expected but good. Even with 1/2 teaspooon of cayenne I found it pretty spicy and hot - I might reduce the amount a little further but not a lot. Either the onion soup or the curry powder was pretty overwhelming so next time I make it I'll probably drop the onion mix and see what happens.  Made enough for four portions and about two cups of soup left over as the sauce was pretty watery. I'll be making it again, but first I have three portions left to go through - I'm looking forward to the day after curry as it always tastes even better (and spicier!)  I didn't bother with the salt and used low sodium soups - but for those of you who don't like the reliance on processed soup - what would you suggest to use instead - I'm interested in learning.

OK, gotta admit that when I first saw the list of ingredients, I wasn't sure about this one (especially the whole package of onion soup mix!). Made it today as the recipe called for but left out the mushrooms (the kids hate them) and left it on "low" for literally 12 hours since I was gone all day. The result... a total hit with the family and my personal favorite-slow-cooker-recipe-of-all-time ranking! Thanks Keon for sharing this wonderful addition to my slow cooking arsenal ;)

I made this recipe last night and it came out unbelievable.  My husband said over and over how much he loved this dish.  However, I did tweek a few things.  I didn't add additional salt as recipe called for, I did however add a pinch of salt to onions while browning. Also, I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was plenty hot.  I added 1tsp of garam masala to give it more flavor.  Cooked it for 7 hours on low.  I will definitely be making this dish again.

I should have read the reviews before making!  My family and I loved it...cleared our sinuses right out!  I agree, cut the cayenne in half.  I entered the nutritional info. into a nutrition calculator and found that the sodium content for one serving of this recipe is 815 mg!!  YIKES!  How to rate it?  It was delicious but NOT healthy.  I am rating on taste folks.

Had high hopes for this but was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and found it bland. I couldn't taste the coconut milk at all - what was the point of including it?The only thing I changed was I decreased the cayenne, everything else was exact. My husband and son didn't care for it either.

Good curry though definitely do not use the full two teaspoons of cayenne pepper.  I used a half teaspoon and it was plenty hot!  I substituted two peeled potatoes for one of the chicken breasts.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I made a few changes to lighten up the recipe - light coconut milk, reduced fat soups, and left out the extra salt.  I also reduced the curry to 2 T. and the cayenne to 1 tsp.  I wish I had reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp., as 1 tsp. was still a bit much for me.  I'm hoping this is better as leftovers.

Made this one with light coconut milk. Had to sub cream of celery for the mushroom soup and left the mushrooms out. I love them but my guys do not. I doubled the peas and took down the curry and cayenne a bit. Flavorful and still warm. Served with a brown/ white rice combo and naan.

turned out great and so easy. I made some adjustments too for a vegetarian friendly version - instead of coconut milk I added a mix of regular low fat milk and coconut flavored water (La Criox makes this i just left a can open to dissipate the carbonation) - I will try this again as it is much lower cal but might add more water for the flavor. For the veggies I added snow peas, carrots, spinach, and green onions. I used a bag Quorn brand chicken (which held up nicely in the crock pot) and substituted cream of chicken for cream of celery. I used a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and it was perfect. no extra salt needed.

This was amazing great combination of flavours, I pre-cooked the chicken to speed up the cook time and made it slightly less hot to ease my kids in to curry, served it over egg noodles. YUMM!!

This was pretty good.  I did follow other's suggestions and reduced the about of the hot pepper.  I only used a half teaspoon and found that to still be quite warm.  If I make this again,  I will use a quarter teaspoon.

Added carrots and added zucchini in the last hour. 1/2 tsp cayenne and substituted onion soup mix for 1/2 tsp onion powder and two knorr bullion cubes. Added 1 tsp garam marsala. No onions, peas or mushrooms. My husband loved it. Thanks!

I was really skeptical of this recipe, but it was delicious! A bit salty. But that's what happens when you used so many cans of things, I guess. I will try some recommendations by other users sometime. My friends thought it was too spicy, but I thought it was PERFECT. I guess it depends on the person's taste. :)

It needed some more flavor (but I did leave out the mushroom soup so that could have been part of it).  Probably needed more seasoning though (maybe garlic salt).  Even with one less soup can it was still a little too runny...may try again.

This is a wonderful recipe! I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic. I made my own "cream of mushroom" soup for the two cans condensed soup and used skinless, boneless chicken thighs for the meat. Soooo good!

reading the ingredients, I wasn't too sure about this one...  But, it turned out amaizing!!!!!  I think it is one of the best curry I ever made.  This is a keeper for sure and I can't wait to make it again!!!!

More like 4.5 stars.  I just finished my first helping and it was delicious.  I used about 1.5 times the curry and pepper the recipe called for.  I like bold flavor and it really was.  Next time I am going to raisins and/or currants.  Yum!

Ok, this is my second time trying this....and it's just as good as the first but better. This time I used chicken drummettes and added white wine (I only had chardonnay)to the mix about 1/2 cup. I was never a big curry eater but this recipe has made me a fan for sure.

Someone call the fire department. I've got a raging fire in my throat. Unfortunately I am not experienced with cayenne pepper, so I followed the recipe. I assumed with all the stars it would be good, and didn't read the reviews. What person in their right mind would want to eat food that spicy?? Or at the very least, think that the majority of others would want it that way? At least call it "Keon's Insanely Spicy Curry Chicken" to give us some warning! I think a layer of skin was peeled off my tonsils.

this is a tasty Thai style curry.  If you want a thick Indian curry look elsewhere.  Best served on a bowl of rice.
I modified the theme with these variations:
no salt;  1 packet of dry onion soup mix, 1/2 teas ground pepper; 8 tbsps curry; 2 teas cayenne, 8 breasts, 2 tbps butter, 2 onions, 2 cream mushroom, 2 cream chicken, 2 coconut milk, 1 pk frozen peas, 1 pk frozen spinach, 1 red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper.
I cooked in slow cooker 1 hr on high until sides bubbled, then 3+ hours on low.
Others noted good ideas to add potatoes or rice, and I'll probably do that when warming the curry up tomorrow or the next day.  This should freeze pretty well.

This was good; however need some changes to the recipe. Like the other reviewers, I decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. Fine for my partner and I; however my 5 year old struggled a bit with the heat and she does eat some spicy cuisine already. We actually love Thai food and associate curry with sweet and salty. Some reviewers said to not add more salt. I would say that you should. I would also add some sugar, approximately 2 TBSP. With these changes, I would increase the rating to 4 to 5 stars. We ate with jasmine rice-- as must have for the side!

I pretty much followed the recipe but didn't have Cayanne pepper so I just added more curry. I also added cauliflower, broccoli and zuchini - I will add potatoes next time as there was a lot of sauce. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as they have more flavor than breasts. I will make this again and add more vegies.

Delicious! I even used low fat coconut milk to cut back on fat and it was super delicious. I am a fan of potatoes in my curry so I added a diced sweet potato.. next time I am going to add some carrots too. Great over brown rice!

Loved this recipe.  It really went well over rice.  If it were eaten by itself, would probably added a little flour to give the broth some body.  We normally don't salt recipes, but definitely recommend it.  We also left out the hot peppers.  Was delicious.  We also used both white and dark chicken instead of all white.  Will definitely fix again.

Very good and easy to make!!  I made this with only 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, doubled the peas, added a chicken breast, and halved the mushrooms (since my roommates don't like them).  It was pretty soupy, so next time I plan to use 3 cups peas, add 2 cups cubed potatoes, and I might throw in some carrots.  Overall, I definitely recommend this recipe!  Thanks

WOW.  Just wow.  I needed to use up some boneless thighs/breasts I had in the fridge, along with a ton of mushrooms.  My family LOVES curry chicken, but I didn't have my usual ingredients on hand, which led me to THIS amazing recipe.  I had to make a few changes due to lack of ingredients:  I used 2 cans of cream of mushrooms (didn't have  cream of chicken), beefy onion mix (as opposed to the regular french onion soup mix), and that was it.  I read that this recipe was even better the next day, so I let it sit overnight before trying.  I did note that the sauce was a bit spicy (not even close to too spicy for me, but I have to be careful of my husband's sensitive palette or he won't eat it) so I added in about a cup of light sour cream - PERFECTION.  This dish was not only suitable for my husband, but also our 2 yr old - she does have a bit of a refined palette and doesn't mind spicy things, but without the sour cream I believe it would have been too spicy for each of them - but again, perfectly fine for me!  I may just mix in the sour cream to their servings in the future, since i only added it at the very end of warming it back up.   I just had it again today for lunch and MY GOODNESS it's just unbelievable.  I cannot wait to make it again and again!!! Thank you, Keon.

My family LOVED this dish! I made this for Valentine's dinner and my husband and daughter raved about it!! I did make some changes though. Instead of chicken breast I used a whole organic chicken that I broke down.  I used Jamaican curry which was a little spicy, so I only put in one tsp. of cayenne pepper. It was just the right heat.  Next time I would put in more mushrooms. I served this with wild rice which was perfect. The sauce in this dish was incredible!!! This dish is a 10 out of 10!

Delicious. 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper was enough. I added a bell pepper and one clove of garlic. Next time I am going to omit the potatoes, add another chicken breast and serve it over coconut lime rice.

I've tried lots of recipes on here but this is the first one that was SO easy and SO good that I just had to review it.  I am not a good cook, so recipes need to be very simple and not require a lot of prep work.  I made this exactly as written (minus the cayenne - I can't handle spicy foods) and it was excellent!  Even without the cayenne it had tons of flavor!  Unfortunately, my family ate the whole thing the first night so we didn't have any leftovers - that's my only complaint!

I was skeptical because of the canned soups, but intrigued.  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this dish.  I substituted half n half and yogurt for the coconut milk.  I agree with some other reviewers that the leftovers a few days later were even better.

Great base recipe. 2 cans of soup is a ton of calories and makes a ton of sauce. I used 1 can, 1/2 onion, 1TBL each Curry and Graham Masala, and 7 chicken breasts. I put chicken breasts into slow cooker whole and *FROZEN*  Cooked mostly on low all day. Chicken was perfect, super moist, yummy, and falling apart.

Very surprised, as many others, about how good this turned out. It doesn't taste like there's onion soup mix in it. My husband absolutely loved it and already said he wants me to make it again. I used 1/2 tsp cayenne and it was nicely spicy. I'm a little bit of a hot-spicy wimp.

Made this for dinner on Saturday... still enjoyed leftovers til Monday! My family loved it.  Made it with a cut up whole chicken for 5 hours on high, added some smoked red peppers for color and put it over pasta instead of rice.  Definitely a new staple in my slow cooker recipe rotaion!

I just got done eating this. It's pretty tasty and a decent recipe over all. I did not include any black pepper and only 1tsp of cayenne and this was still too hot for me - I'm literally sweating. I don't have much experience with curry and don't know if some of the heat was from the curry? If not, I would use more curry for a more flavorful dish.

I served this over noodles because I didn't have any basmati rice. I also used a whole package of frozen vegetables in the crock pot to add some body to the dish.I will probably try this recipe again with some changes - namely, NO cayenne and more curry powder.

This is the perfect curry recipe!! I didn't change one thing. My husband hates curry dishes, but he LOVED this one and even came back for just the sauce over rice. He told me make it again too. AWESOME!!

Super easy to make and very tasty. I made the original recipe and it was crazy hot! I will make it again but only with 1/4 the cayenne pepper. One of the better curry dishes I've ever had.

Good stuff, Keon! I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp after reading other reviews, and it was terrific. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts because I love their flavour. No other changes except for the reduced-sodium versions of the canned soup. I also thought the sauce might be a tad thin, but it mixed nicely with rice, plus it made a really good thick soup for my lunch the next day, with a nice piece of crusty bread. It was super easy and I will make it again.

Do NOT add cubed potatoes & sweet potatoes as some reviewers have suggested.  While it sounded like a good idea, these did not cook in the allotted time and were raw & crunchy.  Had to fish them out of the sauce before serving!  If you wish to add these, pre-boil them and then add at the end.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. per previous comments and it was still quite spicy! Next time I'll reduce to perhaps 1/3 tsp.  This makes a lot of sauce, so double the peas, which adds some more color to this colorless dish! Also added 1 Tb. sugar.

This is my new favorite!!  Had to tweak it but only because I didn't have the exact ingredient list but I think it came out divine.  No fresh mushroom so I used two cans of organic mushrooms.....HATE peas so I substituted green pepper....sauteed all this in the butter with the onions.  Didn't have cream of chicken so I used two cream of mushroom.....and I rarely buy  dry onion soup mix so I added beef bouillon granules, California garlic powder and some dried onions.  I rarely eat rice and have found with spicy dishes like this, smashed red potatoes is just perfect (must be the Irish in me)

This was a hit with our family, and it is certainly easy to make. I did make a few changes, mainly because not all of us like mushrooms. I changed the can of cream of mushroom soup to a second can of cream of chicken soup and left out the fresh mushrooms altogether. And, at the recommendation of others, I left out the extra salt, otherwise I kept the recipe as is.

I loved this easy prep slow cooker meal!  Comes together in about 15 minutes.  I skipped the onion saute, and just added to the crock sliced raw.  I added diced sweet potato and shredded carrot to the mix, and used low sodium soups and low fat coconut milk.  For the curry powders I used two tablespoons sweet curry, and one tablespoon hot.  I skipped the cayene.  Just let it go on low for about 8 hours.  This was delicious served over basil spiked jasmine rice.  A definite keeper and do-over for sure.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

It was awesome! Now that I am pregnant I keep dreaming about this curry. However, I think that it taste so much better with more vegetables. I added potatoes, carrots, and celery. The potatoes were the best part.

This is an awesome curry because it uses such common ingredients that you most likely already have in your pantry.  I did make changes however and I am sure glad that I did beacuse I think it would have been waaaay too spicey otherwise.  I used 2 TBSP curry powder (instead of the 3) and 1 tsp Cayanne pepper (this was the perfect spicy for my family, 2 would have been way too hot for us.  Soooo yummy though!

I followed the recipe closely. Huge hit with my husband who loves spicy things. It was too hot for me, but maybe it was the dash of extra curry powder I threw in. If you like spicy and curry, this is the recipe for you.  He recommended throwing in sliced carrots. Great!

This was very tasty and would have earned more stars if there wasn't such a large amount of liquid left (I felt like I wasted a lot of ingredients)  I doubled the recipe.  I had to make my own cream of chicken soup, rue and chicken broth, and debated about the cream of mushroom.  Next time I will omit the c.o.m. and use curry paste instead of powder. The onion soup mix seemed to be a bit much but the taste mellowed after cooking so long. I didn't use any salt because of the onion mix, that would have been too much. The chicken was perfect! All in all it tastes better as leftovers.  Served over brown rice.

this a great recipe and will keep for a future making.  like others before me i will put only one teaspoon or less of the cayenne in it as 2 teaspoons really cleared my nose and the milk in my fridge!  LOL

The reason I gave it four stars is because of the cayenne pepper!

Wonderful curry flavor and the ease of preparation makes it the best I have had in a slow cooker.  As an added benefit, a few of those who enjoyed the meal have IBS and loved the opportunity to enjoy Indian flavor and a slight kick.  I recommend.

I made this for my husband and myself, we both are lovers of Curry,so added to the chicken while browning it and added to the soups.I did not have the Knorr French Onion Soup mix so I added the Lipton onion soup mix,I used caned mushrooms and this still turned out great. My husband said this is a keeper.

This was an excellent curry recipe that is easy to make with ingredients that you would normally have in the cupboard. I enjoy spicy, so I did used the full 2 tsps of cayenne pepper. I used frozen peas and canned mushrooms which came out fine. I'm sure that fresh mushrooms would have been even better! Maybe next time I will make a point to buy them before hand!

I thought this was a very interesting set of ingredients.  I loved the flavor, but both my husband and I felt that all the creaminess made it too heavy/rich, not to mention lots of calories! I think I'll make it again, and instead substituting chicken broth for the cream of chicken soup and lite coconut milk instead of regular.  I cut down on the cayenne as suggested, but I could've stuck with more.  Otherwise this was easy and satisfied my craving for curry.

I made this recipe exactly as directed except that I cut the cayenne pepper to one tsp,  My husband  liked it, but it just didn't appeal very much to me.  I don't know why.   I love spice and curry and just about all East Indian  offerings.  It just seemed a bit to heavy for me.  I won't be making this again.  Sorry Keon.

Wow. What a delicious recipe. I did cut the curry back to 1 1/2 tablespoons as it was all I had on hand. Plenty spicy for us. Hubby loved this dish .

Stayed with the recipe except reduced cayenne to 1 teaspoon and added a bit more curry.  Left out the added salt.  It was really good.  I will make this again.

Curry is not an exact science! My Indian acquaintances tell me it is "more like guidelines." Keeping that in mind and after reading a bunch of reviews, I did change a few things. I added a whole pound of mushrooms, omitted peas but added 1/2 pound baby spinach, added 3 carrots, omitted cayenne. I had yellow curry paste on hand and used that for the curry (3 Tbls). I served it with rice, sour cream and hot stuff of choice (sri racha, pepper flakes, sambal). All 6 of my eclectic eaters thought this was a great meal with a good balance of flavors & textures. We will make it again.

Made the recipe exactly as listed, except only put 2 tbsp of curry --- turned out great!  Might reduce the amount of coconut milk slightly as it was a little runny, but otherwise no complaints. Definitely a recipe for those who like heat/spice with their meal!

This was delicious. I will make it again.  I didn't change anything. It has a lot of heat from the cayenne and at first I thought It was too hot, but I added a little sour cream to mine. My husband loved it! I will make it the same way next time.

Very tasty.  I was too lazy to saute the onions so threw them straight into the crockpot.  I also added potatoes and carrots to make it more hearty.  Even with these additions, it still had lots and lots of extra sauce. Next time I'll throw in even more veggies.  Didn't have cayenne so used Franks Redhot Sauce.  Perfect amount of heat. From other reviews, I'm glad I didn't add the cayenne as I'm sure it would have been too spicey for my tastebuds.  I cooked on low for a longer period..  Easy and tasty. I'll definitely make again.

Tasty, but a bit spicy for me. I cut the cayenne to 1 t. instead of 2. Even a full teaspoon was too much for me. I’m one to use a pinch of cayenne in recipes. Nothing more. The curry was perfect.

We loved it!  I’m not usually the cook in our family but I fixed this for a night when my was a bit late getting home.  The prep is simple and straightforward.  As with some other reviewers, I cut the cayenne way down, but enough to still have some whang.....served over nutty rice it was a real hit in our house!

I never tasted curry chicken so I made it for my daughter and her family as she loves curry. I don’t like to use a lot of processed foods so I left out the cream of mushroom soup and didn’t put in any cayenne pepper as they have 2 young children.  Well the verdict from them was that it was excellent. It was a keeper and the children loved it. I enjoyed it also.

It was very good; however, the addition of 2 tsp cayenne pepper was way too much for us. Next time I would just add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.

Smells amazing! Taste amazing! I was a bit concerned that it may be to thick, but it is not! I added a few things I added carrots and baby potatoes. I cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. And added a tsp of Garam Marsala. I made jasmine rice with 3 gardamon pods and ginger. This will definitely go on my favorite list!! YUM!

1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne is plenty. Great flavour. Didn’t have coconut milk, so used regular milk, with some coconut oil.
Mixed everything together in the crockpot.

This came out surprisingly nice. I did it basically as in the recipe but rolled my chicken in curry powder and braised it in oil. I added garlic and ginger to the onion and added a cinnamon stick. I also added carrots for color.

I didn't add the peas until towards the end and then just added frozen peas...they stay green and have a better flavor

If there was a 3.5 I would give it that rating. Everybody in my family liked it. It may be a tad on the salty side, and if I had added all of the cayenne pepper, I don’t think most of us would’ve been able to eat it. And I like spicy food. I made it on the stove top with chicken already cooked. But then I just follow the directions and ingredients exactly. It is something I would make again. Maybe it was a little bit heavy. We served over rice. Overall good recipe.

Pretty much went with the stock recipe. Used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast. Cooked as indicated except went full 2 hrs on low. It comes out pretty hot but we used Hot Madras Curry powder so that might explain it. Even so wasn't terrible. I'd put the peas in at the switch from high to low heat. Didn't add the salt as some have stated it already has enough salt. Served over Jasmine rice.

Made this yesterday and definitely a very simple recipe, however next time I would leave out the French Onion soup, as I found it very salty. I would also double the amount of chicken (I used Chicken thigh cutlets) - as there was so much sauce. Reduced Cayenne pepper after reading comments by others. Great recipe for a gathering.

Found this recipe very disappointing and I will not be making it again - I feel that the overall 4 star rating was in error. Extremely hot and spicy and guaranteed that you will not be returning for a second helping! Didn’t like this at all!

The curry is delicious over some basmati rice. I omitted the mushrooms just out of preference. It's a little spicy for me, so maybe next time I'd reduce the amount of cayenne. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good!  The original recipe has way too much sodium though so I used Campbells healthy request, low sodium salt, low or no sodium added peas. It has a really good heat to it with 2 tsp of cayenne. At first I thought it might be way too spicy but its a good spicy. I used chicken breast cut into 2" chunks but it would probably be good with any type of bone-in chicken. Great recipe!

This was delicious.  I used four large chicken breast halves and added six servings of rice.  That gave my husband and I enough food for four nights.  We've got lots of leftovers!  Other than the extra chicken, I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was definitely spicy!  Next time I will use one teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  We will be making this regularly.

Pretty darn good. Has nice flavour, surprisingly did not taste any coconut in the recipe, despite the full can of milk it had in it. Had some nice zip, and did follow the recommendations of many and cut way down on the cayenne pepper

I changed this dish quite a bit but desperately needed a new chicken crockpot dish.  I omitted the dry onion soup (always too salty when I add this) and they cayenne pepper (after reading the reviews). I swapped the veggies and used 3 bell peppers and a red onion. It was a bit soupy and the veggies were pretty soggy. I think it would be better if it was just the chicken, coconut milk, and curry/garlic in the crock pot and the veggies were sautéed separately.  If I had two cans of coconut milk I would have used this instead of the chicken/mushroom soup combo. I also use a lot more curry powder and add cumin too. Overall, good meal but much better if made on the stove.

thank you for this recipe, my husbands favorite dish is chicken curry and he liked the spices of it.  served over jasmine rice was delicious.  i couldn't find regular cream of chicken so i got the cream of chicken with herbs and mixed it with the cream of mushroom with garlic, that was the only difference that i had done,cooked exactly as stated

I made this curry and found it to be pretty tasteless.  I added in a ton of garlic, cumin, tumeric, and garam masala (I had skipped the cayenne which is good  because garam masala has black pepper in it).  That helped somewhat, but even then I would have only given it three stars.  I started with frozen chicken and had to cook longer so maybe that made a difference?  I also used low sodium condensed soups and lite coconut milk..

A great recipe! I made it exactly as written, but noted that manufacturers are shrinking can sizes; the two soup cans were 10.5 oz. instead of 10.75, and the coconut milk was 13.5 oz. instead of 14. For the 2 cups of mushrooms, I used two 8-oz. packages by weight, and for the peas, I measured a dry cup out of a can of peas. The only problem I had was that the cooking time wasn't long enough; maybe it's my slow-cooker, but some of the chicken was still pink at the end of the given time. The flavor of the sauce was awesome, and the combination of ingredients was very nice, but I did think that maybe some chopped  potatoes would have been a good addition. (I don't know how authentic it is, but I've had it in other curry dishes.)

Keon's Slow Cooker Curry Chicken Haiku: "Thanks so much Keon. We just loved your recipe, just a bit spicy." Made this as directed and served over basmati w/ some chopped cilantro. We love curries and this one didn't disappoint, but it did have us reaching for cold glasses of beer!

The only thing I changed was the amount of cayenne powder. My husband and I loved it! It's going to be a weekly dinner :)

This dish is easy and absolutely fantastic!  However, It is VERY spicy!  I only used half of the cayenne and it was still a little too spicy for me (although my husband thought it was perfect)!

When I made this dish, my family came home and wasn't hungry.  So, I made white rice and mixed it in so that we could have leftovers the next day.  It is one of the best left-over dishes I have ever had!  Tasted just like it did out of the crock pot... possibly even better!

I will say that I do agree with one reviewer who mentioned that there is a heavy use of processed food in this meal.  It's definitely not something you want to make regularly because it's just not healthy, but it's worth it every now and again!

Followed the recipe exactly and boy, was it delicious! I love hot Indian curry and this totally satisfied my craving for it. It was definitely hot enough that my nose was running a little bit after a bowl, but it definitely wasn't too hot to enjoy. I wouldn't change the amount of cayenne...2 tsp was just right for me. My boyfriend also thought this was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars because it seemed like something was missing, and after some thought, I think that it's basil, so I will make it again sometime soon and try adding basil.

I thought this was a really delicious, easy meal. After reading the reviews, I decided not to add the soup mix, and used a salt-free Thai herbal mix instead (which I bought at a supermarket). I also used low-salt versions of the canned soups. I didn't adjust anything else, and I thought it was great. The heat from the cayenne didn't bother me at all... in fact, next time I might add a bit more.

I made this recipe tonight because my husband loves curry but it's never spicy enough when we dine out. 
I made this recipe by stove top and it was perfect. (I also added potatoes) 
I boiled my potatoes while I sauteéd the chicken. Mixed the other ingredients together in a separate bowl, then added everything to a pot to allow the flavors to combine. 20 minutes later, I served it over rice and my husband said it tasted better than any restaurant.

This recipe was SO EASY to make and awesome! I only gave it a 4 star because of the cayenne pepper. I should have listened to the reviews and used less but I am a Trini and thought I could handle the pepper. I could handle it but to me it took away the curry taste and all you tasted was spicy. Everyone still loved it and wanted seconds though, but that is my advice(lessen the cayenne). I also didn't stick to the recipe. Every recipe can be tweaked. That is why it was so easy. I used chicken breasts, less sodium soup, and a bag of frozen mixed veggies. I mixed everything in the crock pot and omitted the salt and black pepper. All the other ingredients give it enough salt and pepper! Once everything was thoroughly mixed, I added the chicken breasts and  browned onions and frozen veggies. Then I cooked it and served with rice. Thank you Keon for this recipe! It was great!

So yummy and so easy! The ingredients were fairly priced and easy to find. I used only 1 Tsp of Cayenne Pepper, which was a good move as I was serving some people who were not fans of super spicy food. It was the right amount of spice!

This dish was AMAZING AND SIMPLE.  I've been looking for a curry chicken dish that was easy to prepare didn't require a whole shopping trip dedicated to just the ingredients and taste delicious! I found that receipe here. One thing I can say is I'm sooooo happy I read the reviews that suggested cutting the Cayenne Pepper  to just  1 teaspoon. If I didn't I'm pretty sure this dish would've been a miss for me seeing as I don't like very spicy foods. However it still has the perfect kick I can handle. :)

This was absolutely delicious. I made this exactly as written with the exception of the cayenne pepper. I only used 1 teaspoon and it was still pretty hot. I served it over white rice and garlic naan bread. My husband ate two servings. It was great the next day as well.

Very good and so easy to make.  I used olive oil instead of butter and browned the onion in the slow cooker on the "brown" setting, added the chicken toward the end of the browning b/c 3 hours on low - my slow cooker doesn't have a high and low setting - didn't seem enough to me.  I used thinly sliced chicken breast cut into about 1" pieces so it cooked up nicely - was tender and delicious in the end product.  I added some fresh baby spinach with about 30 minutes left to cook since I had some from the garden that needed to get used and it went very well.  I also used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and can't imagine using more. It would have been too hot, especially since I am serving children along with adults.  I'm curious about the serving size and calories though.  What size serving is getting the 635 calorie mark? 2 cups or only 1?  It seems like a lot for 1 cup but maybe the soups bumped it up.

I thought this was pretty mediocore.  I liked the idea of being able to make it in a slow-cooker, but in the end it really didn't save any effort. I actually used more dishes to cook it than I would have had I done my usual method.  I didn't like all the soups because it didn't add flavor, just substance.  I won't make this again.

loved the subtle coconut flavor throughout this delicious and easy dish.  I only added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and the family asked for less of it next time.  Other than that, it was a big hit in our house.  I will definitely make this one again!

This was actually very good.  However, we are not spicy people, so the next time we make it, we will not use the pepper and decrease the curry a bit.  Otherwise it was delicious!

I loved this recipe. Made it for my indian boyfriend and he loved it. Said it was better than a lot of the local restaurants. I added extra cayenne pepper to make it spicy.... Love the spice.  I possibly could have added salt as it was the one ingredient I left out. This would taste nice also adding carrots or potatoes.  It was a definite hit and if it passed a true indian mans approval I would recommend it.  Thanks so much for the recipe. It was excellent!

Review of finished product!
This dish was absolutely amazing! Even though I misread the amount of cayenne pepper and used 1 TBSP. We like it spicy and this delivered. My boyfriend even said in the 5 years we've been together, this is the best Indian dish I've prepared yet. Thank you Keon for such a fabulous recipe!

This is a great recipe. I've had my slow cooker for years and finally decided to use it a few weeks ago. Instead of using peas, I added carrots and potatoes. The taste was exceptional! I will be making this recipe again.

I was very skeptical of this recipe, but my husband and I love curry and it had great ratings so I wanted to give it a shot. It was excellent!! I agree with everyone that the cayenne was too much. It was still delicious, but next time I plan to use 1/2 teaspoon.

This curry is amazing! I'm currently living long distance from my hubby so I thought I'd make a yummy crockpot dish to eat all week. I've had it five times this week and I'm still not sick of it! Will totally make gain.

This tasted really good. Prep time was much longer then stated but guess I am not the most organized cook...lol I tweaked a bit and added a bit more coconut milk, added some ginger, and graham marsala. I also cubed us some sweet potatoes and threw in a hefty bunch of fresh spinach. Very tasty!

I couldn't find my cayenne pepper, so I substituted chili powder and it wasn't hot at all. It was, however, really tasty! I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!!! I made the following changes, some on purpose and some by accident:  I bought as many low sodium soups that I could find and omitted the salt; I used 6-8 chicken breasts, added 1 bag of raw zipper bag shrimp (during the last hour), I substituted the cream of chicken soup for cream of potatoe (this thickened up the sauce), 5 tbsp curry, 2 tsp garam masala, 3/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp cayenne. These are the only changes I made, I didn't double up the soups because several people said there was a tonne of sauce. These quantities were absolutely perfect! We loved it. It had just enough kick! 
I also discovered this recipe at 1:30 in the afternoon and I really wanted to make it. So I cooked the chicken breasts from frozen on high for 2 hours I then took them out cut them up, which was a breeze and then put them back in with the shrimp and conitnued on high for abother 1 1/2 hours. Thank you Keon!

Excellent dish - perfect for slow cooker because it allows the curry and spices to cook thru the sauce and chicken.  I added one additional ingredient - 3/4 cup of raisins.

I too was skeptical after looking at the ingredients, but decided to give it a try.  I thought it was pretty good the first time I did it though I thought the flavor or the dried onion soup mix was overwhelming.  I didn't include it the second time I made it and was really happy with the result.  I also included a habanero pepper to give it a little kick.

I followed the recipe, but my grocer did not sell Cayenne Pepper, so I had to omit it. But the recipe was great! I had never made Curry Chicken before, I am relatively a new cook. I gave it four stars because I am not one for spicy dishes, not even mildly spicy. This one had a bit of a kick! But overall, my finicky daughter and I  loved it, and that was good enough for me! Great recipe.
