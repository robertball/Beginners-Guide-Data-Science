Simple and delicious with all the colors of Christmas! I made it exactly as written.  Half the amount of pomegranate seeds would be plenty. I used a cranberry vinaigrette from Aldi, which is a seasonal item. It's very versatile and you could swap out for different nuts or cheeses. Definitely making this one again!

I used raspberry vinaigrette because I couldn't find cranberry and added a ripe pear that I had on hand.  It was delicious!!  It looked beautiful on the table and was super-healthy because I didn't use much vinaigrette - it didn't need it.

I made it for a Christmas potluck and should have made more, not a pomegranate seed was left. This was a winner!
