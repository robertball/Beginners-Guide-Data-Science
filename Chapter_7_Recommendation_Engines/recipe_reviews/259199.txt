Wiped off the skewers by hand and cooked under oven broiler, about 6-7" from element. No chutney. Served on rice. Very good flavor and texture. Would make a good meal with a salad. Would like to make again some time, but not hugely memorable. Next time try on charcoal, during warm weather.

I used the marinade recipe on lamb blade chops overnight, blotted off excess liquid and prepared in a grill pan on the stovetop.  Delicious!

Didn’t skewer and cooked cubes on a grill pan. Served in flat bread with hummus, plain Greek yogurt, and baby arugula. Yum!!

Absolutely delicious. Made it exactly as written. Only had about 6 or 7 hours to marinate but still had tremendous flavor.

I made this recipe but instead of doing lamb cubes on skewers, I put the seasoning on a beef rib eye overnight and cooked it the next day for dinner. It was so delicious, that there was no leftovers. My husband and son just couldn’t stop taking another slice and another and one more until it was gone. Thank you for this recipe which will be in my repertoire.
