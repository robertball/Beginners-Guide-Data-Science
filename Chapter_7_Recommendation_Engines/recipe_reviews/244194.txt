I had to make this without the tomatoes or tomato sauce, but found it to be very tasty.  I served it on millet.

I'm not a vegan, but this was great - excellent flavor! had some leftover black beans, so I scaled this down to three servings, and it worked perfectly. I didn't have the serrano pepper, but the cayenne gives it a nice kick. I used frozen tri-color peppers and two frozen garlic cubes. I didn't use the tomato sauce, but there was sufficient liquid. I just let it simmer for a shorter amount of time, ~10 min. I gave a few squeezes from a tube of refrigerated cilantro, adding with the tomatoes. I had this as a one-dish supper, topping with a Mexican blend shredded cheese and microwaved for about 15 sec. Served with a few round tortilla chips. This could be served over rice, in a burrito, taco, etc but having it by itself was just fine! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I made this as a side to go with tacos, and that worked out great. I halved the recipe and it made more than enough for us. Nice combo of flavors. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
