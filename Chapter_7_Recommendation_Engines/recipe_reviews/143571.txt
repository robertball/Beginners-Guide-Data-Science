This was amazingly good. I didn't have brown sugar blend so I used regular Splenda and added a little molasses. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for posting.

So nice to see "Splenda" recipes every once in a while :) This was delicious. I used FF 1/2 n 1/2 and blended the eggs right along with the cream and melted marg. In the sauce I cut the milk to 1/4c and used a 1/4c dark rum! Will certainly make again!

I added additional brown sugar and cinnamon to the top before baking.   Instead of brandy, I used dark rum.  I added a tad bit of rum to the sauce too.   SOOOOO GOOD.

Mine turned out far too liquidy with WAY too much margarine leaking out all over the place. Also, the Vanilla sauce was just a mess.

It was the bomb! I had gastric bypass in October so sugar is a no go for me but all the other desserts I have tried have really hurt my stomach, but this one is very WLS friendly!
