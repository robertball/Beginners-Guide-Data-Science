This is the easy way of making a tres leches cake...I grew up hating it but after having a random craving for it and trying this recipe, I am in love like never before! The only thing that I changed was using white cake mix and sprinkling cinnamon and a cherry on top. Can't wait to make it again for company!

This recipe is not a keeper as written.  The flavor is good but its too dry, too sweet, very greasy, and the texture is about like Elmer's glue.  The good news is that you can have a 4.5 star Tres Leches cake with a few simple changes.  For the cake you'll need to use 5 eggs instead of 3 and adjust the water accordingly.  Depending on the size of your eggs this means you'll use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup.  Using more eggs gives the cake a much better texture.  For the syrup get rid of the 1 cup half and half and use 2 cups regular milk instead.  This gives you more syrup that's not as sweet and greasy.  

Since this recipe uses a cake mix (with very delicate cake flour) there's probably no way to get the texture up to a 5-star rating. By adding more eggs its pretty good though.  This modified recipe is quick and easy so it will have a place in my collection.

This recipe is perfect. I wouldn't change anything about it. I used the Betty Crocker Golden Vanilla Cake Mix and it turned out really good. The cake is delicious and so moist. Husband didn't want any kind of fruit on top so I just spread some homemade whipped cream on top and it is fabulous. The tres leches cake is now officially my favorite cake!

Never liked Tres Leches cake before when I ordered it at a restaurant or bakery but this one is oh-so-special. It is a glorious site to watch all that creamy milk soak into the cake and it's an absolute must to let it sit overnight. I whipped fresh heavy cream to "frost" it and have garnished it with different toppings such as a sprinkle of cinnamon, fresh strawberries and blueberries, toasted coconut. The possibilities are endless. It is my go-to dessert when asked to bring something to a gathering. It's a sinful piece of heaven!

I got so many compliments on this cake.  It would have been even better with "real" whipped cream but after the "tres leches" I couldn't bring myself to do more than whipped topping. I did use a white cake mix. I really questioned the amount of liquid I was pouring on the cake but after sitting overnight it had absorbed all of it.  Yummy!

Easiest best recipe for Tres Leches. Made it for my family and garnished with fresh raspberries. Of all the recipes on Christmas Day this one was the hit. My family loved it.

This cake is soooo good!  I made a mistake (in a rush) and poured the milks too fast on top of cake with holes punched and I think that is why a lot of it didn't soak in; however, it was still delicious!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the cup of water, I used coconut milk in the cake mix.  It turned out amazing.  I served it with a Mexican themed meal and ALL my guests devoured it!   It is a keeper for me!  My kids enjoyed it, and it is a nice change from the normal stack cake!

This is a very simple, and tasty, recipe that really doesn't take long to make.  I thought the flavor was good but I added some sweetened shredded coconut I wanted to use up.  I now understand the benefits of pouring the syrup on the cake slowly.  I'd baked the cake in clear Pyrex and was able to see the how the cream absorbed.  I got the balance pretty much on-base with a little syrup left over for those who prefer the cake a little wetter.  Topped it off with fresh raspberries... it was great.  Next time I might substitute canned dulce de leche instead of sweetened condensed milk to get a little caramel flavor!!

this cake is increíble. :-)

I used olive instead of vegetable oil and doubled the whipped cream, as the suggested amount wasn't enough to cover the cake. I did let the leches sink in overnight, and the cake turned out very moist. Finally, I topped the cake off with cinnamon.

Made this cake a day before I served it.  It was swimming in the milk mixture and a soggy mess.  I usually make Ina Garten's recipe but decided to take the easy way and use a box mix.  Won't make this one again!

I've not been too impressed with Tres Leche cakes in the past. Think it was a texture  thing, BUT this cake is moist, not soggy, and so delightfully refreshing! Perfect summertime cake! (Forgot the whipping cream so used Cool Whip extra creamy and sprinkled cinnamon  on top.)

I went by the recipe and everyone that had some said it was the best cake I have ever made. and I bake a lot  of cakes !

Easy Easy Easy 
Just make sure you allow enough time because it does have to sit in ref. for several hours, or overnight

The easiest way to make it but not the best.  The cake fell apart when soaked with milk and needs to be more dense.   The kids loved it but I'm still looking for a better recipe.

This was just alright. For me it was a bit too overwhelmingly sweet and quite soggy. What I suggest is either, separating the eggs (discarding the yolks) and beating them to stiff peaks before adding to the rest of the cake mix ingredients. This would create a more sponge like texture that would better soak up (and hold on to) the milk mixture. Also, another thought is to remove the cake from the pan so it's upside-down, and poke holes in the bottom to pour the milk mixture into. This way, it won't become as soggy as the crust of the cake is the dryest part anyways. 
A touch of cinnamon sprinkled over the top or a splash of rum mixed into the milk syrup might also help combat some of that overwhelming sweetness.
This was not bad, just needs a few tweaks in my personal opinion.

I teach English Language Learners (Middle School), all Hispanic, and make this cake for them occasionally. They love it' and some say it’s better than the Tres Leches cake made at the local Mexican market! I didn’t think I would like such a moist cake, but it’s yummy!

I love Chef Johns' Recipes.  I made this EXACTLY per his ingredients, didn't change or add anything and it turned out DELICIOUS! Hubs took 4 pieces to work and handed out to the sugar junkies and they all emailed me and said yum, please make it again.....

Made this tonight for my husband's birthday since it's his favorite cake. Got rave reviews!!
So easy to make-I ended up using already made whipped topping since I had some on hand and had strawberries if anyone wanted to add them. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the cake batter. 
Will make again!
