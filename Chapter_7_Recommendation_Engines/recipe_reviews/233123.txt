I made as written except that I was a little heavy handed on the cornmeal out of habit.  I never really got a thick batter (could have been the extra cornmeal) but they sure came out tasty.  Draining on paper plates lined with paper towels will absorb more grease and you will not lose your crispiness.

This Southern tradition is a wonderful snack or side dish. However I added some seasonings to spice it up a bit.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I couldn't get the batter to adhere to the tomatoes. Otherwise good.
