Really good and easy...but I made a few changes. I used 4lbs of boneless skinless breasts cut into bite sized pieces. I did not cook before adding to crock....I added it raw with everything else. I also only used 2 cans of small white beans....thought 5 cans of beans to 2 lbs of chicken seemed off. So I upped the chicken and reduced the amount of beans and this ratio of 4 lbs of chicken to 2 cans of beans seemed better. I used frozen corn, 1/2 a bag. Added a chopped vidalia onion instead of dried minced, added a yellow squash diced to add more veg factor to the dish and also added a can of rotel. Served with white cheddar cheese and sour cream. Very easy and yummy crockpot recipe. Thanks!

Slow-cooked White Chili Haiku: "I reduced the beans. Coz wow, that would be alot! Leftovers.AWESOME." My daughter (young, and starting to get the same weekly-chili-urges that I do) made a big fuss when she saw this. Really irate meltdown b/c it didn't look like traditional chili. I let her sit there squeaking, turned away to do the dishes (as I'd already inhaled my bowl), and to my glee, hear her shoveling away b/t "mmm" noises, as she realized after a nibble that this chili was fantastic. To make this even easier, please no tsk-tsk, I used 2 large cans of chicken from Costco (it's really good stuff, and I know alot of AR folks are snobbish about canned chicken), and also used 1/2 chopped yellow pepper, and 1/2 chopped onion, instead of dried. As faithful as I could be to this recipe, I have to say that I loved it (even better the 2nd day) and look forward to making it again.
9/10/15: THREE YEARS LATER and my new LO is loving this chili too! I am still using Costco canned chicken and adding in sauteed onions. Freezes beautifully as well.

This chili was really good.  I halved the recipe, but added 2 cans of white kidney beans and 1 can of black beans.  I halved the amount of chilies in case it was too hot and added a fresh onion and some garlic.  I also added about 1/2 cup of herdez green salsa to the cooker.  I didn't see the point of cooking the chicken before hand when it's just going to cook in the slow cooker so I just threw it in.  The 1/2 batch easily fit into my 3.5 quart slow cooker.  I cooked it on "simmer" (one setting below "low") for 8 hours.  The end result was delicious with a bit of heat.  I topped it with sour cream and had some garlic bread with it.  I would probably decrease the amount of chicken broth next time (probably to only about 1/2 a cup) because it ended up being a bit watery or more soupy .  Otherwise this is great!  Nice change from traditional "red" chilies!

Generally I don't make a recipe if it has less that 100 reviews.  But this one intrigued me, and rightly so.  It was perfect!  I didn't have everything on hand so I did make a couple of substitutions (I don't think this would have affected flavor much):
Used chopped fresh onion instead of dried minced
Used fire roasted chilies (it's what I had in the pantry)
Used 2 cans Great Northern Beans (again, what I had, and 5 cans seemed like WAY too much)
Used frozen corn.

Hubby had 2 helpings then had it for lunch 2 days in a row.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only used 3 cans of beans based on comments by others. I don't think 5 would have been too many though after making this. It made a nice change from all the tomato based chillies  out there. Next time, I might uses a mix of different beans to give it some color and perhaps yellow corn also.

Made this recipe as written but for subbing grated Vidalia onion for dried, not precooking the chicken, and cooked it on high for 5 hrs.  Topped with jack cheese and sour cream.  Very flavorful!  Don't cut back on the beans!  We loved it and will make again.  Thanks for sharing, SKW!

I used half the amount of corn, wish I would have used jalapeno peppers instead of green chiles. Next time, because there will be a next time :P

I made this recipe exctly as written except I used 4 cans of beans and frozen corn instead of canned. It turned out good, but was VERY spicy. If you are planning on feeding this to kids, you  might want to reduce the amount of chiles and red pepper flakes. My kids couldn't eat it because of the spice, but loved the flavor. I also thought the amount of liquid was very low for how many beans were in this recipe. I am making it again today but instead using a 32oz carton of chicken broth and reducing the chiles and red pepper flake by half. Hopefully it isn't as spicy this time, becuase it really has a great flavor otherwise. It's also very good with a dallop of sour cream added when serving.

Amazing! I didn't cook the chicken first, and I did use all 5 cans of beans but I put one in the blender with the broth to thicken it up. It was a little too spicy for my kids but they tried to eat it and asked that I make it again, so next time I am using only 1/4 tsp red chile and making sure I use the mild chile peppers.

I have made this several times. I don't change the recipe except sometimes I might add a little tomato, sometimes not. It's a wonderful chili. The amount of beans is perfect. No one has ever complained that there are too many beans in the white bean chili. I will be making a huge pot of this with several pans of cornbread for my daughter's 18th birthday bonfire. This recipe is always a hit.

This quickly became a staple in my house.  What a great slow cooker recipe!  I didn't alter the recipe much (added yellow corn and zucchini for more veggies).  I used the same spices as listed, just a lot more of them.  I probably use on the order of 3 tablespoons of cumin and a few teaspoons of oregano... I am not shy of spices/flavor and this came out delicious!  I also only browned the chicken before adding it to the cooker (salt a peppered the chicken before browning and pour the drippings in the pot along with the cx for flavor).  I serve in a bowl, sprinkle fresh cilantro on top, squeeze on some lime, and add a dollop of sour cream.  Yum!

i adapted to what i had on hand, along with reducing the serving size.  it was a bit watery for me, but after serving it over a bed of crushed up tortilla chips it was just fine.  thanks for the post skw!

I was disappointed. I followed the instructions exactly except that I did not pre-cook the chicken (I did marinate it for a few hours in the chicken broth in the frig though). I found this chili to be bland. Tastes like chicken and been stew. I've never made White Chili before but this recipe definitely needs something. I agree that there were too many beans. And not enough flavor.

This is a nice change from the regular tomato based chili.  The first time I made this I was a little concerned about the five cans of beans, so I cut it way back and only added only one can of beans, corn and green chilies.  I kept the chicken broth the same and about one pound of breasts.  It turned out fine.  Adding a little dollup of sourcream and cheese to the individual bowls really made the dish.  Family even commented that it was good.

This recipes was a huge hit with a crowd of 20 picky eaters.  I took the recommendations of some of the reviewers below: Used 3lbs of chicken, only 1-1/2 cans of cut chilis (it was plenty spicy), and reduced the amount of navy beans to 2 cans.  I will definitely be making this again!

Recipe turned out really well, was easy to make, and lasted a week (1 person, 1+ meals daily)! It traveled and reheated very well.  The chicken was very tender.  I think next time I'll try to add some fresh veggies (other than corn and chilis) for some variety

I liked this recipe. I recently join Weight Watchers, therefore soup is a good option. I used a leftover rotisserie chicken, added it to a 6 quart pot and simmered with water, covering the entire chicken. I added minced garlic, about 1.5 tsp. Simmered to create a nice both. Placed a sieve over my crock pot, to get clear broth. Picked the chicken off the bones while my crock pot sat in my refrigerator to let any excess fat rise to the top and become solid, about 20 minutes. You could do longer. I skimmed off the fat and got my broth down to about 2/3 full. Added the chicken. I had simmered and soaked some dry navy beans 2 days earlier  to ensure they were soft. Added all ingredients but I used a real onion and chopped in my ninja chopper. Also added another tap of garlic and only a scant 1 tsp red pepper flakes. I didn’t have any corn, but it was tasty without. I will still add some. It’ll add color. Tasty and diet friendly!

Very delicious and fairly easy- I did make some changes:
1. Sauteed garlic and onions before adding chicken and brother (instead of using dried versions)
2. Fried up some fresh bacon to use as a garnish....BONUS- pour bacon grease directly into crock pot for added flavor!
3. Thickened up with corn starch mixed with water...makes for a much thicker consistency!
4. I used more chicken and a can less navy beans per others' advice

Serve with cornbread, sour cream, extra sharp cheddar, and aforementioned bacon bits...YUM! It's a hit with my boyfriend and he's requested a batch for his buddies at work! Winner!

I thought this turned out surprisingly well, but there just wasn't enough broth and the broth was kind of....soupy I guess. I think next time I will add a can or two of cream of chicken soup to make a creamier broth that I think will be more chili like.

Either way, it was a really easy recipe that had basic pantry items so no special shopping was required. It was pretty tasty and my family rather enjoyed it. I will probably make it again with a few tweaks.

I read the other reviews and made some modifications as recommended.  I used 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts. I used the entire container (box) of chicken stock. I added a yellow pepper. I used fresh yellow onion instead of dried minced onion. I used small bag of white corn. I cooked on high for about 4-5 hours.  Delicious!  Will def make this one again.

I really think this is about 3.5 as written.  Too many beans...at least one can too many.  Also too much corn...again about a can.  Not nearly enough spice for our family.  Had to double or triple every spice and add some cayenne to make it taste like chili.  That being said it was a good start.  Will know how to add flavor next time.

Super easy! I altered the recipe slightly. I used 4 cans of great northern beans instead of navy beans. I felt like I needed a bit more chicken broth for my chicken to boil, so I used 3 cups. I also added some cinnamon and a simple roux with black pepper.

I gave 5 stars knowing that I would make a few changes next time to fit our tastes...instead of cubed chicken I'm going to use shredded chicken & more of it to offset all the beans.  I will put more garlic & cumin & then top with shredded cheese.  Instead of 5 cans of beans I only used 4 but next time I will swap some navy beans  for some butter beans.  I only used one can of green chiles as I'm not a big fan of chiles & only wanted a hint of it.

Nice flavors and one of the best white chili recipes I've found. It was a little too spicy for my taste as written. The second time, we cut the green chilies down to one-and-a-half cans, which was just the right amount of zip.

I used cannellini beans.  I thought they might hold up better and they did. This recipe is awesome!

Loved this recipe!  I didn't precook the chicken and I used 3 cans of white beans and 1 can of black beans.  I also took advice from other reviewers and added yellow squash, fresh onion instead of dried and frozen corn.  I will definitely make this again!

I like a variety of beans, so I used a can of cannellini, a can of garbanzo, a can of pinto, and a can of great northern beans (4 cans total... I reduced the number of cans of beans based on other reviews). I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp, because 1 and 1/2 seemed like a LOT. My first impression on trying this chili was... it's kinda bland. I know, I know, I reduced the red pepper flakes but I feel that adds more heat than flavor. I added some hot sauce, and it tasted amazing. I think if I make this recipe again, I will add a couple bay leaves, do a full tsp of red pepper flakes, and at least a couple tablespoons of hot sauce.

I used only 3 cans of navy beans, cut the chicken breasts in half and put them in raw. Shredded the meat after it was mostly cooked. REALLY good!

This is a delicious chili, very simple and quick to prepare. I added an extra can of chicken stock, 1/2 C verde salsa, chopped carrots and red peppers, and made it a day ahead. A five star winner!

I made this for a tailgate recently. Thinking it 'looked weird', I wasn't sure how well this would go over (not being a traditional chili). I doubled the recipe and people came back for seconds. There wasn't a single leftover! I made it with shredded chicken tenders rather than chopped chicken.  I had numerous people ask for the recipe (including a family from Texas where beef and red chili rules). Definitely a new family favorite!

These were good but doesn't compare with our favorite white chili.  It's great for working moms and easy for husband to put something together lol.
