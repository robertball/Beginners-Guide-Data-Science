This was ok, but if I were to make it again I would leave out the sesame oil and the turmeric - I didn't think they worked with the other flavors at all. Husband didn't care for it much. Oh well, thanks anyway.

This was really quite tasty. I didn't care for the red peppers though, but that is a personal thing, they tasted fine I just didn't like their texture in this. I used dried minced onion and freeze dried chives instead of fresh. I only used half the sesame oil called for. I enjoyed this and would eat it again. I might try adding spinach too and see how that works out in this. Thanks.

It was pretty good....  My boyfriend didn't really care for the peppers.  I love the seasoning though. I put little pieces of bacon and added black pepper.  Instead of red peppers I added green and yellow peppers.  I would try this again!

I  think the trick is to really cook it for as short a time as it says so the peppers retain their crispness. 
I made it with chives as green onions, for two people, served with bombay aloo, (5 small, sad spuds, basically), and it was delicious and plentiful. 
I grilled the top as I knew my turning/flipping skills were lacking. If you added cheese it would puff up under the grill but I liked it without,

This recipe is great - my 2 & 4 year old kids loved it and left their plates clean.  I left out the sesame oil, and added some ham & cheese.  Will definitely make this again!
