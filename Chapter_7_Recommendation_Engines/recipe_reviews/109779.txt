I tried this and I have to say that it didn't come out good at all.  It was probably my fault in some way, for I haven't smoked any vegetables before, only meat.  I thought I followed everything to a T but the result was asparagus that not many people really wanted to eat. Sorry, as I said it was probably my fault.

I fixed this in the smoker and everyone wanted to know what was in it.  It was a huge hit.  Am fixing it again on Monday with a smoked briskett.

I did not make any changes other than I didn't have quite 1 1/2 pounds of asparagus. We used hickory chips. At one hour it was still very crisp. We gave it about 10 more minutes and it was perfect. The smoke was subtle and it was delicious. Will make it again anytime we are using the smoker. It is worth the hour.

Did not like this at all. Neither did my wife. We tossed the whole pan in the trash. Smoke overpowered all flavors. Oh well.

I love being able to cook an entire meal on the grill and smoker...this is a GReaT side dish that can be smoked while you are smoking your meats.  I followed the directions exactly as written and it came out wonderful!  This is a keeper!
