I saved and froze the giblets from the last turkey I made but I did not save the neck so this one was made as written minus the neck. I really liked this and especially enjoyed the tang from the vinegar. It was a little runny but that is an easy fix. This one is a keeper and I will be sure to save the neck on my next turkey so that I can make this again.
