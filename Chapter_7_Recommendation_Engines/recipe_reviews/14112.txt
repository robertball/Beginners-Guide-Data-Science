This was EXCELLENT, BUT, here are some changes to make this recipie more condusive to larger cooking needs:
1st double the soup part(this makes it condusive to 9x13" glass dish.  Then substitue 1 of the cans of cheese soup for cream of mushroom.  Also to the soup add a healthy sprinkle of Lowery's Season salt(or Johnnys if you prefer).  When you cheese the top, use 2cups shredded cheese.  Then cook for 1hr and 15 min(the larger pan means longer cooking time. Good Recipie, I btought 3 pans of this to church poluck, they scrapped the dishes CLEAN!

My husband and 16 month old loved this!  I added about 1/4 c of sour cream to the cheese soup and a little bit of milk.  Also, when layering, I sprinkled salt, pepper, garlic and onion salt over the soup mix and then added the shredded cheese.  This was super easy and very yummy.  I will be making my potatoes like this from now on.

This is very similar to a recipe I already had that uses cream of celery soup.  Either soup is good but with either, use 1/2 cup milk and 4 cups sliced potatoes. Yukon gold are especially good.  If you substitute celery soup, you will need 1 cup of grated cheese.  Bake 375 covered 1 hour, uncover & bake 15 min, sprinkle with paprika.  Yum. I like this recipe because with using cheese soup, you don't have to use as much cheese.  Don't skimp on the onion!

I made these potatoes last night for dinner and they were a hit.  I made red skin potatoes and sliced them very thin.  I took the advice of others and used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 cup milk, black pepper, garlic powder and salt in the mixture.  Layered it and covered it in the oven on 375 for 1 hour.  Put the shredded cheddar on top and let it melt & brown for about 10 minutes.  I also left the skin on the potatoe.  MAN O MAN.....LET ME TELL YOU.  This recipe is simple, delicious & is the BOMB.  It's a keeper & in the Recipe Box.  Thank you for sharing!  (I am going to add 1/2 cup of sour cream next time)....Yummm

I tripled this recipe and also added about one cup of light sour cream and  almost one cup of half and half, which did make the soup mixture very creamy and easy to spread on top of the potatoes.  I kept the foil on for the first hour and then took the foil off for the last half hour of baking - it took longer cause my pans were very full. Also added lots of black pepper and a bit of garlic powder.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I thought this was good but I changed it quite a bit.  I added milk, lots of onion, and lots more cheese...a mixture of colby jack and mozzarella.  It turned out good this way but next time I will add garlic powder, more milk, and will definately cook it longer.  I would recommend baking at 350 for 60-90 minutes.  Good starting recipe.

YUMMY! I tweaked this a little, but not much. I used about 6 or 7 potatoes to make a bit bigger batch, so I added some sour cream and cream of mushroom soup to the cheese soup to make enough sauce. I baked it in a foil lined 9x13 pan for about an hour or so, and it turned out GREAT. It was a big hit and I've already got requests to make it again!

I cooked this recipe for 200 people. It was very good.  I followed the reiew that used 1/2 cheddar cheese soup and the other 1/2 cream of mushroom.  This variation made this recipe excellent. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I would certainly not hesitate to serve this dish to company. I did, however, make a couple of changes by mixing 1/4-1/2 cup of milk to the soup,slicing the onion into rings instead of chopping it up and not putting the shredded cheese on top until towards the end of the cooking time. I used a 13 x 9 inch glass dish and at 375 degrees it was actually almost ready before the 45 minutes were up. Perfect!

I made this for Thanksgiving and followed the recipe exactly.  This is so easy to make and it was wonderful and cheesy.  I did let it cook longer than what the recipe stated to get the cheese browner, but it is definitely a keeper and was a nice change from the traditional sweet potatoes.

This was delicious!  Had to cook it longer than 45 minutes though, but still, easy and yummy!  A winning combination!

this was pretty good, would have been better fi the onions were sliced instead of chopped. Had to add some water to the soup as it was too thick to spread. Next time will probably add some cream of celery too.

Super delicious!!! I had some whipping cream left over from the chicken marsala, so I added that into the cheese soup, and it was so creamy and great! I also had some button mushrooms that needed to be used, so I sliced them up and put them on top of the bottom layer of potato slices. My 4-yr-old was also able to help arrange the potatoes in the baking dish, so it was a fun activity.

This was great!  Never again will I bother with the pain-in-the-butt homemade cheese sauce.  As other reviewers suggested, I did add milk and sour cream, and threw some shredded cheddar into the mix.  Also added more cheese to the top.  My potatoes were thin, but still took longer to cook - proabably my oven.  Thank you Maryanne!

Never made scalloped potatoes before but these were so easy. I did change things a little be aide I do not cook with canned soups.  I used the mandolin for nice thin slices and instead of cream soup substituted cream cheese, sour cream, herbs, and thinned out with whipping cream. Everything else was the same and it came out awesome. Herbs like rosemary, garlic, onion, and crushed red pepper in a grinder make the flavor come through with less work.

Very easy and tasty. I have made these several times and they always turn out great. I add the shredded cheese in the potaoes instead of on top. I also add a scoop of sour cream. I also stir them about half way through.

Overall, the potatoes are good, but they reminded me of store-bought from Costco taste rather than homemade.  I will probably use a different recipe next time.  But I have to say they were definately easy.

RECIPE WAS OK AS WRITTEN BUT IT NOTICED I DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH SOUP TO COVER MY POTATOES, ALSO TASTED THE MIX AND IT WAS A LITTLE BLAND. I ADDED ABOUT A CUP OF MILK AND SOME SOUR CREAM . ALSO SEASONED THE MIXTURE WITH CHICKEN BULLION, GARLIC POWDER AND PARSELY.  CAME OUT VERY GOOD

Delicious....used red potatoes w/skin on, as well as adding cream of mushroom & about 1/4 cup of sour cream.   As per other reviewers, I will add more cheese next time, and to add a crunch thinking of using fried onions on top the last 15 min of cooking.  Even my picky 9yrold raved about it. :O) thank U for the reciepe

Yummy! Made a couple of changes. The store actually didn't have cheese soup so I used cream of mushroom instead. Topped it with fried onions instead of cheese and it made a great addition. Definately a keeper!

Very good!  I used a large dish so I went ahead and used 1 can of Cheddar and 1 can of mushroom soup and I used both Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese. For the last few minutes I put lots of cheese on top and broil it to make it crispy on top. Keep an eye out so as not to burn. My guess enjoyed it and at the end of the meal scallops were all gone.

This potato dish was just ok.  It sure was cheesy but that was about it.  Lots of other reviewers had ideas about add-ins.  I would add something else to this dish unless you're a fan of bland food.

This was a great recipe.  I added about an extra can of cheese soup and a cup of milk to the soup mixture and it turned out great! Thanks

This is an easy dish and a good base but you can really add some flavour and increase the serving with some tangy add ins. I added 1/2 a cup of milk as well as 1 to 2 tbsp of mayonnaise and a tbsp of garlic cream cheese. For some spice I added some chili pepper flakes and mixed it all up. This really gave it some extra flavour. As others mentioned, I cooked it for an hour covered and 10 minutes uncovered. I love cheese and I love potatoes so this dish was excellent.

Wonderul receipe. I made some changes. I used one can of the condensed cheese soup and one can condensed mushroom soup. I added 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of milk and about a handful of chedder cheese. I also used one small bag of fresh broccli and cauliflower. I cooked it in a 9X13" glass pan for one hour on 400 degrees. It turned out excellent. Very tasty. No left overs with this one.

Pretty good. I like the fact that you don't have to use so much milk and cheese because that can get expensive. 

I added some zucchini to get some vegies going and it worked out well.

This recipe is truly awesome. However I did make some changes(what cook doesn't?). I added another can of cheese soup, cut back to 1/4 cup minced onion, and added left over ham from a previous meal. I also suggest baking the dish about 1/2 hour longer than the suggested 45 minutes.

I followed suggestions from some of the other reviews, and both my husband and I loved this recipe!  I added the cream of mushroom soup, and some seasoning salt.  I also added shredded cheese and green onions in between the layers.  One note, I had to cook this for about an hour and a half, so you will need more time.

I hadn't made scalloped potatoes in quite some time and this recipe seemed to me to be the easiest way to get back into it.  I added about 1/4 cup sour cream and used fat free half and half to thin the mix because it seemed to thick to "pour".  Added salt and pepper, too.  They came out great!!!

I modified this and it was so good I had some for dessert - I know, that sounds strange!  I'm not much for sweets and this was so good I had a second helping!  I changed it somewhat.  I used about 6 cups of thinly sliced potatoes, a large onion sliced very thin, a can of cream of cheddar cheese soup, a can of cream of chicken soup, about 3/4 cup of milk, 1 1/2 C. shredded cheddar cheese.  I used a big mixing bowl and put everything in it and mixed it up till all the potatoes and onions were coated and the soups were well mixed.  I layered 1/2 of the mixture in a 13x9 glass baking dish that had been sprayed with cooking spray.  I sprinkled on about 1 1/2 C. diced leftover ham (from Easter dinner) then the rest of the potatoes on top.  Smoothed it out and baked at 350 degrees for about an hour and 15 min. (check occasionally to see if it's done).  It was out of this world and I usually don't like the taste of canned soup in recipes but this was really good.  I bet using sour cream instead of milk would have been great too - I'll try that next time.

Nice flavor but I had the same problem I always encounter with scalloped potatoes. Even when I follow the recipe exactly the potatoes don't get fully cooked. I would recommend precooking the potatoes in the microwave.

I really liked this recipe. So easy! I put some hot pepper flakes on top and maybe some garlic powder. You could do a lot with this- add other veggies, different cheeses, etc. I liked these cheddar scalloped potatoes better than traditional scalloped potatoes.

This never cooked properly.  1/4" thick is WAY TOO THICK, the sauce was too thick and the flavor was bland.  The picture shows paper thin potatoes with a nice sauce.

These potatoes were VERY yummy and super easy! They were a big hit with my Easter ham that I made. I followed the suggestions of others by adding 1/2 cup milk to the soup. Baked it for 1 hour covered and then an extra 15 mins uncovered. When I pulled it out of the oven, I sprinkled the dish with paprika. I also used Red Potatoes instead and left the skins on (not sure if that was ever suggested or not)....yum yum yum!! :)

I tweaked this recipe a bit by adding two big dollops of sour cream and 4 slices chopped bacon to the soup. Also added some Lawry's seasoned salt and topped it off with French's french fried onions. I used about six med/lg white potatoes and cooked for about 1-1/4hrs (covering with aluminum foil after top became brown and crusty.) These were the best I've ever made by far!

Ok this is another easy one with great flavor. I doubled and followed others advise a can of mushroom soup, a can of cheddar cheese soup and 1/2 c. milk, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and definetly salt to taste. My family ate almost a whole 9x13 pan. The cheese on top made a yummy thin crust on top, and it did have to bake for an hour on 375. Absolutly will make again and again and recommend it to anyone. Thanks

These were great. I did add a little milk to the soup mixture before layering. I also love cheese so I sprinkled the cheddar cheese between each layer not just on the top. Cooking time is more like an hour though.

This is a GREAT way to use up leftover smoked ham steaks and pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly.  And then I added a little milk & sour cream to the condensed cheddar cheese mixture before layering.  And layered pieces of shredded ham steak over the potato layer.  The house smelled INCREDIBLE!!  I did have to cook it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but it was well worth it.  And this is SO easy.  My kids who are at the age where one eats everything and the other eats nothing LOVED IT!!!
THANK YOU!!!

My family likes scalloped potatoes from scratch, but when I tried this they really liked them. The taste is great and creamy. I put little dabs of butter on top before baking.  If you want, it works to cook this at 350 for one hour. Your meatloaf and potatoes are done at the same time.

Quick, Fast & Tasty - Just My Style!!  My crew loved these and ate until the dish was clean.  I did double the soup and add the cream of mushroom as suggested by others.  My husband isn't a fan of scalloped potatoes but even he came back for seconds.  The cream of mushroom was the trick I think.  Thanks for a winner Maryanne - I'm adding this to the keepers.

So, I made the recipe using a 11x14 glass dish.  I wound up throwing out 30% of the potatoes because 4 potatoes were just too much. The result lacked flavor & there wasn't enough sauce.

I added more onions and more potatoes but still quick and delicious. The cheese soup was an added bonus for our cheese loving selves. I see others used sour cream and milk. Will have to try it that way next time but this hit the spot just the way it was!-Trudy

This was my first time attempting to make scalloped potatoes. I followed others suggestions and added 1/2 cup of milk, cut the potatoes very thin and baked 1hr 15min.  My mother-in-law was impressed with how tasty they were.

This was really easy. I thought it was to cheesey with the strong cheddar soup taste and took the suggestion of adding milk and next time will add even more milk.

Very yummy but I did take advise given and change it up a bit to make it more creamy. I added 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 cup sour cream and about another cup of shredded cheese as well as some garlic powder. Soooo good, we make it all the time now!

Everyone just loved this recipie!  I added one can of cheddar soup and one can cream of mushroom to give it a kick.  I also layered some cheese along with the soup mixture instead of just putting it on the top of the casserole as my guys love cheese.  I ended up cooking it for another 10 mins and put it under the broiler for 5-8 mins to make the cheese bubble and harden up a bit as we like it that way. Thanks for the tips!

Super easy & very tasty!  I used about a cup of shredded cheese (mixture of mild chedder & mozzarella).  I also mixed about a quarter cup of milk with the can of cheese soup.  I covered the dish with foil for the first half of the baking time.

I really wanted to like these since the reviews were so good, however I didn't think they were very tasty.  I really disliked the taste of the cheddar cheese soup.  It tasted fake and processed to me.  On the other hand my hubby liked them, thank goodness!  The recipe makes a lot, so he's been eating them for days!  ;)

These scalloped potatoes are great! The taste is good, but be sure to cook them a little longer than the stated 45 minutes or the potatoes will still be on the crunchy side.

this is a very good recipe to start off with. I like others, doubled the reicpe and added a can of cream of mushroom. The second time i made this, i did not use all the onion it calls for. It overpowered the cheesy taste. I also added a cup of sour cream. Everyone loves this recipe and it is easy to make if you have the time to slice all the potatoes!

I've been using this recipe for almost two years already and each time it turns out great.  I find it needs more cooking time.  I've usually had to add extra milk and the last time I added rubbed tarragon to the layers.

This was a huge hit at our house. I only did a few things different. 1st I tripled the recipe with no problems it just had a longer cooking time. 2nd I just added some milk to make it smoother and chopped ham to make it a main dish.   Yummy Yummy!

Delicious and easy, although I did make some modifications. Baked for 1 hour, as I really dislike any crunch in scalloped potatoes. To the soup mixture, I added about 3/4 cup of onion minced fine, 2 tsp dried oregano, a large clove of garlic, minced, and 1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce. I served this dish with plain roast beef, so I wanted it to have a fair amount of flavour. Thanks for the inspiration!

This is my new go-to recipe for scalloped potatoes! Really fantastic. I had to add some milk to the cheese soup for the amount of potatoes I used. The next time I made it I layered in sliced ham to make it a meal! You'll love this recipe~

Very simple recipe that has become a requested dish in my home.  I'm a very basic cook, this was very easy and quick to put together.  I did make a change to it by adding 8oz of sour cream in addition to the soup.  My husband asks me to make this at least once a week.

Very easy to make and nice flavor.  It does need some salt added, and I usually have to bake it longer than is called for in the recipe.

Overall good taste.  My potatoes were still crunchy, so I think next time I will pre-boil them a bit.  Also, I added more shredded cheese in between the layers, in addition to some herbs (parsley, basil & garlic). Very tasty, thanks!

I am giving this one five stars because it was delicious and simple to make. I messed up a little and added a can up soup that wasn't condensed, and one that was. I used the cheddar cheese can of condensed soup and than used a can of mushroom soup, it would have been thicker if the mushroom soup was condensed as well. Great recipe, homemade scalloped potatoes are far better than those that come in a box. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was great.  I added a half can of milk and had to cook it longer, and would probably add more milk next time because it was too thick (probably from the extra cooking).  But I will definately make this again.

I made this for Mothers Day and it was very good.  I made a double batch and added 1/2 cup of milk just to be sure that there was enough liquid.  I also doubled the cheese by adding extra in the middle layer. I think that next time I will add bacon or ham just to add a little more flavor.  All in all though it was prettu good and it all went.

Adding ham made this an entree.  I added 2 more potatoes, a can of mushroom soup and a 4 oz can of mushrooms and 1 soup can of milk and shredded ham.  I left the onions in rings and basically layered with the potatoes, onions, mushrooms(and water from can), ham and soups mixed with milk until all ingredients were used up.  It does require longer baking tho.  Very good and I'll make again, I like it better than from scratch scalloped potatoes..

Was excellent!  Easy side dish for a big meal - doubles up easily.  I used a bit more shredded cheddar for the top with a little dried parsley.

This is very close to my mom's recipe except hers does not call for the shredded cheese(so if you don't have it on hand it is still really good w/o it) and her recipe does have a can of milk in it. 
We also dot the top with butter and sprinkle a little paprika on top for color and a bit of flavor. This is one of my all-time favorite comfort foods!

I really enjoyed these. It was my first time making scalloped potatoes. I used half a can of mushroom soup and about 1/4 can of milk as well as I was worried about not having enough liquid...well there was more than enough. Next time I think I will leave out the mushroom soup. I really liked that it doesn't make a lot.

Took the advise of others and made a double batch using Cheddar Cheese and Cream of Mushroom soups.  Came out very dry and potatoes took "forever" to cook.

Thanks for the great recipe idea!  No one likes cheddar cheese in our house (except for me!) - so I used a can of cream of potato soup/1 whole onion/and mozzarella cheese + a little chili oil.  Came out great!!!!!

These were suprisingly delicious - I loved the rich cheesy sauce ... but did follow others' suggestions to combine the cheddar soup with an additional can of half-fat cream of mushroom soup.
SO easy!

I used 1 and a half large baked potatoes, skin on, but used the same amount of the other ingredients and it came out perfect.  I baked it for 30 minutes covered, and 30 minutes with the cover off.

It was ok tasting, a bit bland though. Yes, it was very easy to make, but it tasted that way too.It needed more milk, another can of soup, some seasoning & around another 1/2 hr of cooking time.

This recipe was quick and easy to make but I had to add another can of soup to make it creamier.I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cheddar soup and put shredded cheese on the top.

I've been making this dish for about 50 years. It started as an experiment, but evolved into a pretty good way to fix scalloped potatoes quickly.

12/25/18 - This potato dish has no flavor.  I chose this recipe because it's one my boyfriend said was something his boys liked - was easy enough to put together and his son did like it.  But it's a no go from me - too much canned soup and zero taste.  I'm a huge fan of the cheesy potatoes with the sour cream, etc. but this recipe isn't one I'll make again.

The ingredients for the recipe were fine but the cooking time wasn't long enough.  I ended up putting it back in for another 30 minutes, covered.  If I were to make this again, I would bake it  covered for an hour and then uncovered for another 15-2O minutes.

Followed the recipe pretty mush as printed.  It does require more time than originally stated.  This recipe was very tasty and definitely a keeper.

Not sure what happened.  I sautéed the onions before adding to the soup mixture.  Added some minced roasted garlic to the onion as well.  This was flavorful but sauce was surprisingly VERY runny, even after adding more cheese on top.  Glad it was just family.  We agreed to give it another chance after a few weeks.

I made these as written, but I didn't care for it.  I wish the recipe had a "saucy" type of sauce.  An undiluted can of cheese soup  and some onions are not enough to cover the pototatos and certainly not enough to provide flavor.

I won't be making these again.

I enjoyed how easy these were to make!  I only scored a four star because it was a little salty for my taste, I guess maybe using a low sodium soup would have been better.

After reading the reviews I added milk (I added about  ¾ empty soup can of milk)  However my husband said it did not taste exactly right.  I made it again this time tweaking with my own ideas.  I used white potatoes (not that it matters).  I added one can (used the soup can) of 1% milk.  I increased the shredded Cheddar cheese to 1 cup and put ½ cup in the soup mixture and the other ½ cup I sprinkled on top.  He liked it with my tweaks a lot better.

Doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 glass baking dish. Used 1 can cream of mushroom and one cream of celery. Added a cup of milk and baked 375 for 1h 20m. My daughter doesn't like anything too cheesy so I just used a cup and a half of shredded cheese. As others reviews said the onions give it amazing flavor. I also added pepper, a little season salt and paprika! Loved it! Will make again.

I made this in an 8x8 square pan, which I think is the perfect size.  It only made 2 layers.  Would be perfect to serve 4 people...but you could probably squeeze out 6 servings.  Delicious!  So Easy, too.  I would definitely make this again.

Pretty yum**  I used cream of mushroom soup, (what I had on hand)- Turned out good- added a little extra onion- sprinkled cheese in between layers (like others suggested) and on top-  only thing - make sure you check for doneness- after an hour, my potatoes were not done - I assumed after an hour they would be cooked- mistake - I microwaved to finish cooking- thanks- would definitely like to use ched soup next-

I too doubled the recipe, washed red potatoes and sliced them in thin slices, left the skin on.  Used one can cheese soup and one can cream of mushroom soup.  Threw in some seasoned salt. Baked for 1 hr and 15 min. Everyone loved it and it heated up well the next day too.

I was looking for easy when I chose this recipe.  Not only is it easy, but it's delicious!  I made a mistake by choosing too deep a pan and heaping on too many layers, so I had to bake it forever.  The taste was great, though, and it's probably the easiest Scalloped Potato recipe I've seen.

This is the recipe I always use.. I use 3 cans of ceddar cheese and 3 cans of milk. I add some spices to the soup mixture and heat it up in a pan while I slice the potatoes...do the sprinkle cheese thing between layers... I always get requests for this... it is so easy and yummy!

These potatoes were very good. I only added 1/2 cup sour cream to the recipe and simmered everything on the stove 10 minutes or so to cut down on cooking time in the oven, then baked 15 minutes till browned on top. I cut the potatoes very thin with a mandolin, otherwise, I think they would take an hour to bake or longer. Very good and no leftovers!

This is a great recipe.  This was the first time I have ever made scalloped potatoes from scratch and I used to small a dish, so it was stuffed to the top and needed more cooking time than the 45 minutes.  Will use this recipe again, but in larger 9x13 glass dish.  My family really liked it. >^..^

I thought that this was ok.  But I did alter the recipe a little.  I added another can of the cheese soup and sour cream.  But for me and my boyfriend, it needed a lot less onion.  I think that without the onion or just a little bit of onion, maybe even just onion powder, that this will be a good recipe

I did not care for this. I added about 1 1/2 cups of milk, but it took over an hour to get the potatoes cooked and it seemed to be lacking something. I probably won't try this again.

I made this dish for a large group.  Doubled it, and as suggested added cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, half & half, and garlic, also seasoned to taste, it was fantastic!  No leftovers!  Thanks for sharing, it's in my recipe box.

This was a tasty recipe. I will definitely make it again. I used way more cheese than it called for (aprox. 2 cups).  I think I also used more potatoes. I made mine in a 9X13 pan and it was full. Added half a can of milk and some fresh chopped garlic to the cheese mixture, before pouring over the potatoes.  Also had to cook for more than 45 minutes than called for in recipe.

Terrific! Skipped the onion by accident but did use garlic powder during the layering process. Also added some milk at the end. It's a keeper.

This recipe is a keeper!  I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9 x 13 pan and increased the baking time a little.  It was excellent!  My husband and kids went for seconds and thirds.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were awesome!  My picky 14 year old son who never eats potatoes even approved.  My 11 year old daughter went back for 2nds and 3rds.  I followed others advice and used once can cream mush. soup and 1 can cheddar cheese soup and a little milk.  I baked them at 375 for 45 minutes and that was perfect!  Will definately make again!

Tasty, very cheesy, but too rich and greasy for our taste. I added mushroom soup like others.  Would add more spice to it, maybe seasoning salt and thyme.  I'll try it with less condensed soup and add milk to decrease richness.

I just made this last night for my fiancee and myself.  We like extra cheese so I layered it throughout the dish, instead of just on top.  I also added bacon bits to each layer.  This was very good.  My fiancee told me to keep this one on file.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was okay. I guess I'm not big on the idea or taste of using a soup in a scalloped potatoe. I tried it, and I wasnt that impressed.

I thought these turned out average.  I made the recipe a little differently which may account for why I didn't care for the flavor as much.  I used red potatoes.  I also doubled the recipe and was worried about it taking too long to bake, so I boiled the potatoes first before slicing them.  I thought the potatoes overwhelmed the cheese flavor.  Also thought there was nothing special about the cheese flavor.  It is easy to make, though!

The amounts given were WAY off.

Four large baking potatoes, but only one can of cheese soup? No. Did not work at all.

I expected to have to increase the cooking time after adding an additional can of soup, so I had to cook it for almost 70 minutes, as opposed to 45. Thankfully, it was just a dinner for family so they understood.

I guess this is a good recipe if you like the "American Cheddar," velveta/processed type flavor. My mom liked it a lot, but I've had much better. I had taken the advice from COOKIN4JESUS (additional can of cream of mushroom, more cheese, some more onion, and Lawry's seasoning salt etc.), but it's not for me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and certainly not make it for guests. Sorry to be so negative!

Delicious!  Basic recipe is simple and quick to prepare.  I used suggestions from user "CookingforJesus" adding a can of cream of mushroom soup to make the recipe serve more.  I made this for our Easter dinner.  Let's just say the glass baking dish was licked clean, literally.  This one's definitely a keeper.

This recipe was good, but I used two cans of soup rather than one, and probably could have added a small amount of milk and baked longer.  The potatoes in the center of the dish were still not quite tender.  I will definately make again with some minor alterations.

I didn't like this recipe.  Either my potatoes were way too large, or I really needed to use two cans of soup.

This was a terrific accompaniment to meatloaf - can cook at the same time and tastes wonderful together.

Excellent idea to use condensed cream of cheese soup.  Made for Thanksgiving dinner at church & went over great, did not take any home! I also added some chopped turkey cubes and sprinkled bacon bits on top for added zest.

very good, can be made vegetarian or not.  we happened to put turkey ham in it, and it was great!  Never would have thought to use the soup, but it made it nice and creamy with a great cheese flavor!!
