This has got to be the weirdest pancake recipe I have ever come across on allrecipes! Having said that, I was surprised I did not detect the flaxseed meal at all!!! The orange taste was not overwhelming it was just a very small hint of bright citrusy flavor. I will have to remember this recipe if I'm ever out of eggs!

When I saw this I knew I had to give it a go.  I had a bunch of OJ just sitting around not getting used up so I when I saw this, it was perfect.
So easy and so tasty.  I am not much of the vegan way to eat things but, I do enjoy flax seed and all the combination was very good with pure maple syrup.  The orange taste is very light but, gives it a nice touch.  
Will definitely make again if I fall into the OJ surplus again.  Thanks

7.29.18  These pancakes had a good rise, but there definitely was an aftertaste of baking powder.  Pancake texture is somewhat dense, not fluffy and light, but the orange flavor came through well.

I used a cup of white flour and a cup of whole wheat, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Ate them with butter and syrup and they are quite good.
