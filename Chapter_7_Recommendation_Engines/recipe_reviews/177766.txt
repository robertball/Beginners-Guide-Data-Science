Yum! Really good recipe, some what like tuna casserole, which I love, but the family doesn't with this one, we all win. I added 1 and 1/2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables and melted 1 cup mozzarella cheese on top in the last 5 mins.

This is the first dish I cooked for myself.  Amazingly it turned out quite well, considering I still have no clue how to use my kitchen

I added some green chiles that were in the pantry. Helped to spice it up. My kids loved it.
