I've made this recipe three times.  The first time, I followed it exactly and did find it to be a bit salty.  However, the underlying taste was still good....  Decided to try it a second time, but changed the amount of the Seasoned Salt to 1/2 tsp.  Big difference!  This time, I felt it was PERFECT!!  Followed the change my third attempt and served it up for a baby shower buffet.  It was the first to disappear and I had many ask for the recipe!!  Definitely would recommend it.

This is a very good change of pace from the typical tuna salad.  I used more mayo for moisture, the juice of one whole lemon, and less salt, about 1/2 teaspoon.  For more flavor I added 1/2 teaspoon curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper, 1 clove caramelized garlic crushed, 2 jalapenos chopped, 1 tablespoon capers rinsed and drained, and fresh ground pepper to taste.  Served on a bed of fresh spinach, splashed with balsamic vinaigrette.

Caution: this recipe can be salty.  I took notice of one of the reviews who mentioned it was too salty and I left out the seasoned salt.  Still, I found it salty to my taste, but tolerable. The canned salmon I used had 240mg of sodium for 1/4 cup of fish.  This recipe is delicous but be careful.

This is a great base recipe, I seasoned to my taste so I didn't suffer from the "too much salt" issue some did.  Old Bay seasoning worked great in this, and this salad was tasty in a sandwich, thank you for posting!

This is a really good salad.  What I need to do next time is to double batch this recipe. The only thing that I did differently was use miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  I will definely make this again!!!

This was excellent.  I made it with two cans worth of leftover salmon from last night with a just of touch of smoked salmon I needed to use up.  The combo of green onions, celery and dill add just the right flavor.  I used lime juice as that's what I had, and no salt due to the smoked salmon.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing this one.

Very good. Used 1 tsp each lemon juice & dill and only a dash of salt. Used 1/8 cup each sour creme and mayo. Makes lots - try half recipe?

Very easy & very tasty, easily adaptable for personal taste (I cut back on the mayo)!  Something I like to make when I am tired of tuna salad.

Very good and healthful.  I reduced seasoned salt to 1/2 tsp and squeezed more lemon juice into the mix than recipe called for.  Didn't have dill so used dried basil.  Will add a little lemon zest next time.  I look forward to making this often.  Much more flavorful than tuna salad.

Great recipe!  I made it to use up about half a pound of cold poached salmon from last night's dinner party, reducing the seasoning salt to 1/4 teaspoon.

Fantastic, I have made this with canned salmon and canned makarel each time it has been delish! I have even thrown in some cranberries for a hint of sweetness. I have rolled them up into a fajita or made sandwiches or on just on plain crackers thanks for the wonderful idea!

Tried it today.  I poached a couple of salmon filets (about 12 0z) instead of canned.  Onions have been tasting too strong to me lately, so I added about 1/3 cup of chives from my backyard instead.  I thought it need more mayo so I added a bit.  Also upped the lemon juice to about 2 tsp.  I use canola mayo routinely.  Interesting looking and my hubby and I both thought "delish!"

This was good and really easy.  To me it needed something but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Maybe I'll be able to tell tomorrow after it has had time for all the flavors to blend.
UPDATE - This time I omitted the seasoned salt, increased the dill to 1 tsp. and added a Tbsp. of capers to it and it was delicious.

VERY good salmon salad! I multiplied the recipe for enough to serve on our restaurant's salad bar, and I did take the advice of others who recommended omitting the salt. It turned out wonderfully. Our customers are now asking what days we will be serving it so they can plan on eating here!

I used leftover baked salmon, the onions and celery, a little less salt, 1/4 cup mayonnaise and added 1/4 cup Lite-House Dilly of a Dip dressing. Didn't have any dried dill. Very good.

I made this recipe with left over fresh salmon that we had cooked on the grill on cedar planks.  Before serving, I felt the salad was not salty or seasoned enough.  I added capers and cajun seasoning and it turned out fantastic.  Canned salmon is probably salty, but with fresh it is not.

We eat a lot of canned salmon (very good here) but always red.  Anyway, really like this recipe which is a pleasant change from the norm.   Just a little too salty for us and I substitute about 1/4 tsp. of lemon pepper.      Good sandwich and very popular for a quick lunch or shower.

This is a great, simple and nutritious recipe. Some folks don't know that canned salmon is always wild caught and contains the same nutritional value as fresh salmon.  I even omitted the salt due to a health condition, and it was still good.  I tend to use a bit more celery and use chives from my yard if I'm out of green onions.  Sometimes I even add some capers.  Great for sandwiches or eaten  inside a big lettuce leaf.   Wonderful recipe for warm days when it's too hot to cook.  Plus, the ingredients are almost always at hand.

I used some leftover grilled salmon and used the ingredients as a guideline. I used chives instead of green onions, because I had chives growing in my garden. The flavor combination works well together. I would say use less salt and add more if you want. Also let the salad blend it's flavors for a few hours to one day to get it's full flavor.

Very good! Made as directed but left out the salt completely. Might add a little Johnny's Seafood Seasoning instead of salt next time. Maybe 1/4 tsp and some lemon pepper. Added 1/2 cooked peas, which didn't change the flavor much but adds a little more veg. Served on a croissant, but would also be great on a bed of lettuce or avocado as suggested, or crackers. The hubby, who doesn't really like fish much, said he enjoyed it and would like it again!

This is just so good but I used salmon filets that I broiled with olive oil and salt and pepper.  Steps it up a notch.  My husband who doesn’t like mayo based salads couldn’t stop eating it!  I would even use it as a spread for crackers for an appetizer.  Great recipe!

I used poached salmon, added thinly sliced fennel and diced cucumber. Very good on rye bread.

I made this salmon salad and when I tasted it, I could hardly believe it was so delicious with so few ingredients. I'll definitely make it again because it is so easy and melts in my mouth!

This very simple recipe is delicious. I used left over broiled salmon and fresh dill because I grow dill and I had left over salmon and it was great. Cut way back on seasoning salt.

I made this dish from a pint of my canned silver salmon we caught on our last Alaska trip. I didn't find it salty at all. it may have been because of the product I used. in my eyes it was perfect.  I  toasted up some sour dough bread that had a nice chewy crust and didn't find it lacking at all. I would recommend the recipe and plan to make it again.

I have made this salad twice, and I added a little garlic to it for my tastes.  I think it added something to the salad and made it taste that much better!  I also put a little more celery, less onion, again to my tastes.  This salad tastes better the 2nd day because all of the flavors come together and make it taste wonderful!  Try it today, and I just bet you will love it!

I used a little more fresh lemon and fresh marjoram from my garden. Make sure you pick the skin and bones out of the fish.
Absolutely delicious for a summer day!

This was a great recipe. It was a very quick meal and I really loved the simple ingredients. I think it was a bit too salty so next time I only used 1/2 tsp of the season salt.  It also tastes great with a 1/4 of season salt because of the mayo which has enough sodium in it to give it flavor. Personally I added a touch more mayo because it was a little too dry but overall it was a big hit with everyone.

It was very good!  I used no salt at all and it was fine - to each his own, for sure.   I used about double the lemon juice and a fat tablespoon of my wifes' home made zuccini relish and diced in a half cup of carrot since we were clean out of celery.  A good balance of flavour was the result and we ate it up!

Made as stated except used 1/2t seasoned salt as opposed to 1t.  It seemed like a lot of green onion but turned out great!  I was tempted to add more mayo since it seemed pretty dry, but in an attempt to keep the health factor up and the calories down, I left it and in the end didn't really need it anyway.

At my husband's recommendation, I added 1-2 T of capers.  Perfect.  Even my kids enjoyed it.

Thank you.

This recipe turned out great! I loved the green onions and celery, because they made the salad just that much fresher. 

I would make the recipe again. Maybe cut the celery into small pieces.

I also added triscuit crackers to the salad, and used the salad as a dip.

This was simple to make AND good.  I added a little more spices just because I love spices and scooped it onfo a bed of lettuce and served it with cheese bread.  It was wonderful.

Very good base recipe. It needed acidity so I added a dash of balsamic vinegar and minced capers. Great with butter lettuce.

I found this recipe to be very tasty. I also added more mayo and 1tsp. of pepper to help cut some of the salty. I will definitely make it again.
