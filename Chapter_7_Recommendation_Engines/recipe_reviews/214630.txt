Just a suggestion to all those cooks out there. To get this recipe where your patties wont fall apart. Drain the tofu before you get cooking. This is what I do. I take the block of tofu out and place it on a plate. I take a second plate on place it on top of the block of tofu. Then get a can of bean or corn or whatever is handy that had some weight, and place that on top of the second plate. Wait for 20-25 min, and dump the water. Hope this helps I know when I first cooked with tofu I had to research and research. This was yummy by the way, we like spicy food so I added a jalapeno and it came delish!

I agree, very tasty!  As vegetarians, my husband and I have eaten dozens of 'veggie burgers'.  I will definitely make this one again, my husband really liked it, too.  They were a little 'crumbly', perhaps I should use quick oats next time (I used regular)?  But all in all I really liked the spice combo.  Good work!

This is a good recipe, and I'll give it 5 stars because we like it, it's healthy, and I'll make it again.  I did have to make changes though-  I didn't have red curry powder, so I used curry powder plus some red chile paste instead.  I added extra garlic, garlic powder and onion powder, and some black pepper.  i think this is a bit bland in flavor, but with additional seasonings, it's a great recipe.  And it sure is a lot healthier than the tofu burgers that are at the store. I may add some shredded carrot to this next time, I think it would work out pretty well.  Oh-  and VERY important--  you MUST drain your tofu ahead of time.  I wrap it up in a clean kitchen towel, then place it between two plates, and put something heavy on top.  Let it sit for 25-20 minutes, to squeeze that water out.  Also...   make sure you use QUICK COOK oats---  not the 5 minute cook oats.  The quick cook (i.e. cooks in 1 minute), has no problem in getting the batter to stick together.  That being said, this is a nice recipe for healthy homemade tofu burgers...  just add extra spices and try some different things.   We added a bit of hot sauce, when eating, and it tasted great that way!  Another one to try, is a little bit of cheese (maybe some pepper jack?).

These were my first tofu burgers ever and they came out amazing! I drained the tofu well before hand and had no issues with crumbliness!  Only thing I'd add next time is a bit of salt.

I can't believe how yummy this was! I added some chicken bullion, doubled the amount of egg, and used curry powder instead of paste, then baked at 175 degrees C for thirty minutes. I had this as an open-faced sandwich with Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic, also from this site. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this!

Thanks to pattyward555 for getting me started with homemade tofu burgers.  This is my first attempt.  I followed the advice to drain the tofu: the technique I used was to crumble both packages of firm tofu into a colander, set the colander in a bowl to catch the drainage, press another bowl into the tofu that was sitting in the colander, and set a gallon water bottle on the bowl to exert weight onto the tofu.  Left it in the 'fridge overnight and it was quite dry in the morning.    Besides the recipe ingredients, I added a finely-diced carrot and half bell pepper.  Finely-diced cauliflower or broccoli would be good, too.  Used cumin seeds instead of ground cumin; and about 4 T. cumin paste instead of one.    For the binder, I started with 3 eggs instead of the 2 eggs called for and pan-fried 4 tofu patties.  Was still crumbly, so I added 2 more eggs, for 5 total.  This seemed to improve the cohesiveness of the cooked burgers.  Had to use a spatula to transfer the patties to the frying pan, as the egg doesn't bind the patty together until it's cooked.  (But, you knew that. :-)       My total yield was 14-15 patties.   Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Really good. I'm vegetarian but my family isn't. I made one for me and instantly everyone wanted to try. I ended up making enough for the whole family. My friends came over and they absolutely loved them. It's a little bland so I added just a little bit of salt and pepper. Also, drain the tofu. It helps. It's still a bit crumbly but not nearly as much.

Delicious!  I substituted the oats crushed 'Nature Valley' Granola bars.  It gave it a sweet inviting taste.

Yummy! Good texture. Maybe a bit bland, but you can certainly dress them up easily enough. Very easy to make.

these were alright. I added more spices and tried to jazz them up a bit because they were really really bland the first time around. Anyways, they still feel like they're missing something, I'm just not totally sure what. I don't think I'll make them this way again.

This made a dozen large burgers, not just 8. I added four extra eggs since the commentors suggested more egg to hold the burgers together. Also used instant oats. They still didn't stay together great, but not bad. They were okay with sauce on top - otherwise bland.

These were really good. My family was doubtful in the beginning but after they tasted it they loved it. I drained the tofu and pressed it for half an hour before  mixing with the rest of the ingredients. I also made thinner patties and they crisped up nicely on the outside.

I followed the recipe exactly but I mixed it all together in my food processor. Turned out sticky so I just took a large spoonful and dropped in the preheated pan, then flattened and shaped a bit with a spatula and they turned out great. I think a little salt and pepper might have been an improvement though, so will add some next time.

These were really bland.  I ended up adding a bunch of salt and pepper and they were just odd.  The hint of curry was weird.    My son the vegetarian was the only one who ate more than a bite of it.   Not sure what I'm going to do with all the leftovers.

I halved the recipe because there is just my husband and I at home, and still was able to make 11 medium-sized burgers out of half the suggested mixture. Not a bad thing, by the way!

Made this recipe, worked like a champ!  I didn't  have a problem with the patties falling apart.  This is a welcome recipe as I have just become a vegetarian and don't have many recipes yet. I will make this again, even my non-vegetairan kids ate this.

My whole family loved this! It was my first time making it today and it turned out good. I burnt the bottom on the second flip though so I would recommend only giving the bun 3 minutes to cook after you've flipped it once. I cut the recipe in half but more spices wouldn't hurt it either.

I made this for myself and my 13 mo old. I followed the advice to drain the tofu for 20-30 min first. Made only a half recipe due to only having that much tofu. I used only 1 egg but to help solve the issue people mentioned about crumbling, I added a soft cooked sweet potato and that made all the difference. Also, I let the mixture sit overnight and I think that helped soften the oats. Great base to go off of with the ability to customize.

Patties did not hold together well despite very well drained extra firm tofu and addition of extra egg. When cooked, texture was mushy, so much so that it fell apart while eating. Taste was very bland. Needs more spices for flavor and beans for texture.  Will not make again.
