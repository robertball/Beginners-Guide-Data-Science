This recipe ROCKS!!!!!!   The only adjustment I made was what other reviewers suggested which was to cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup.   We had an art show at our Church last Saturday night and I made gyoza along with this recipe for dipping sauce and people RAVED about it and requested the recipe...  Thank you Rebecca!!!

This was so good. Better than the resturaunt. I halved the recipe. I used regular soy sauce, but 4 cloves of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger from the jar. In leiu of the sesame oil and crused red peppers, I used chili paste. It was a great dipping sauce for the pork and shrimp Gyoza, fried won tons, and crab rangoon.

I didn't love it.  You definitely need to cut the vinegar down to 1/3 cup, but there is something else missing.  Maybe a drop of honey or pinch of sugar?  It was just a little too tart for our pot stickers and scallion pancakes.  Will definitely try again, but with modifications.

This recipe is perfect!  I love it as-is, but my boyfriend prefers less spiciness when we use it on our veggie gyoza.  I make the full amount of the recipe in a small bowl, let the flavors meld overnight, then strain it into an empty soy sauce bottle.  We pour it directly onto our gyoza (preventing waste), and the bottle goes into the freezer to keep until we need it again.  I strain out the solids so (1) it doesn't continue getting spicier and (2) the freezer doesn't affect anything oddly.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I added 1 T. of brown sugar, decreased the vinegar to 1/3 cup, and used 1 tsp sambal chili paste instead of flakes. I heated it in the microwave a little just to dissolve the sugar...really good stuff! Thought about adding more paste, but kids were eating this, so....

way too salty. almost overpowering. I used the less salt soy sauce even. I would hate eat it with normal soy sauce. Maybe if there were more ingredients in what I used it in to spread the sauce and thus taste around it might have been better.

Very easy and tasty!  Save yourself from having to buy pre-bottled sauces, while also having more control over the spiciness level.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was very good. I followed the recipe to the letter. I used it as a dipping sauce and used it again as a dressing on an Asian salad as a sauce for steamed asparagus. I added toasted sesame seeds when used on the asparagus.

A bit too much vinegar but over all good dipping sauce for my pot stickers. I think next time I make this I will cut the vinegar to a 1/3 c. Good recipe. Thanks!

Fantastic! I cut down the vinegar to 1/3 of a cup based on another review and served them with Trader Joe's cucumber won tons. The recipe made WAY more than we needed but was very delicious! thank you :)

Love this sauce but I learned long ago to measure sesame oils in drops and taste the dish after each drop until itâ€™s right for you.  Even a tsp can over power a recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I like to add more ginger and a 1/4 of sugar.   I used a table spoon of chili garlic sauce in place the pepper flakes. If you let it sit in the fridge over night this brings out the ginger and garlic.

This is a great START, but it needs improvement for my personal taste. I definitely would advise cutting down on the vinegar. It was just too overpowering.I used half the amount. I also doubled the garlic and ginger. It also needed a little sweetness. Some white sugar works great. With these adjustments, I love this dipping sauce for frozen Gyoza I buy from Trader Joes, and I make sure to have enough to drip a little extra on my steamed rice.

A most excellent recipe for gyoza/dumpling dipping sauce!  The only change I made was using ground fresh chili paste (since I have a jar and am looking for ways to use it up!) instead of red pepper flakes.

Excellent! I think I might try adding some sugar nect time. I played with the recipe and ended up a little more tart than I like. Next time, I'll add small amt of sugar.

OMGosh! This was a huge hit at our fondue Christmas celebration. We dipped everything in it - it was addictive. I also used it as a marinade for some left over mushrooms and make a tofu scramble on Christmas morning! I only used a pinch of the red pepper flakes and subbed Bragg's Amino's since I am gluten free. Stunning!

Awesome.  I used Sriracha instead of crushed red pepper flakes (liberally, I may add) and added a fair bit of teriyaki sauce, which gave the sauce a bit of sweetness.  The sauce was a huge hit.

An amazing dipping sauce, very flavorful and complemented the vegetarian gyoza very well (from Trader Joe's). A bit harsh on vinegar flavor - perhaps will use less next time.

Great basic recipe. With a few tweaks, it turned out fantastic.Like others I cut the rice vinegar back to 2/3 cup. I added 2 and 1/2 Teaspoons of packed dark brown sugar. I chopped up one spring onion - white part was finely chopped and green sliced. I heated the sesame oil and sauteed the garlic, ginger, green onion for about 2 minutes, added the hot pepper flakes, stirred for a minute. Added the liquids, brought to a boil and simmered for 4-5 minutes. I've been doing a lot of trial and error to makes a good potsticker sauce and this turned out amazing.

This is exactly what I just made, but it doesn't taste anything like the typical gyoza sauce you get in local restaurants or even the sushi bars at groceries like Kroger sell.

I would put A LOT less vinegar in this than what's called for. The vinegar overrode all the other flavors, like the ginger taste and it made the sauce very tart.

I have this thing about knowing what flavors I want in a recipe. I chose this, and it was PERFECT for what I was looking for.  Where I like to buy my pot stickers - they don't come with any sauce packets.  This recipe hooked me up.

This dipping sauce had a little too much rice vinegar. I love things with vinegar but for me it was a bit too much. Iâ€™ll reduce vinegar to 1/3 cup next time. However all the flavors added to this dipping sauce were delicious!

Very good. A little tart, but still great. I can see why some are saying reduce the vinegar to 1/3. After eating gyoza dipped in it, I felt like it was missing something. It needed something sweet added to it. I didn't have any teriyaki on hand, so I used 2 packed Tbsp of brown sugar. Worked perfectly. I thought it seemed like a little much (I kept adding a little and tasting, but it wasn't quite enough), but it turned out really good.

Great flavor.  To make it last longer, the flavors blend better, and be more squirt bottle friendly, I substituted the fresh ingredients and pepper flakes for dry ingredients.  This recipe has also been a money saver and tastes just as good if not better than the premade gyoza sauces I have purchased in the past.

Cut the vinegar back to 1/3  cup and add a tablespoon of sugar (warm the sauce to dissolve sugar). You won't be disappointed!

I also found this too tart and acidic. I reduced the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup and added Mirin which gave it sweetness. I've now simplified the sauce for when I'm in a rush and want gyoza to just include the soy sauce, rice vinegar, a dash of mirin and a squirt of siracha sauce. I agree it's better with the spring onions, ginger and chilli flakes and given some standing time but the difference is tiny.

Way too much vinegar. Like everyone else is suggesting the vinegar should be cut down. Some are saying 1/3 cup but I am thinking 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup water as well. Then add agave or honey to your taste.

This is very good--just the thing I was looking for. On the advice of previous commenters I reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and even that was a tad too vinegary and I'll probably take it lower next time. Also I added about a teaspoon of sugar, based on previous comments. I used garlic paste and powdered ginger, tho I may try ginger garlic paste. I just used a small sploosh of sesame oil. I didn't put green onions in, I usually put those on top of whatever I'm making that's likely to have this sauce anyway. I had it over noodles and some leftover green beans. Delicious. I'll definitely be making a batch of this to put in the fridge.

We've lived in Japan and eat lots of Japanese and this is my favorite recipe for a Gyoza dipping sauce. It's authentic and outstanding. I like spicy and usually add a bit of chile oil in addition to the sesame oil.

This recipe saved me from a panic attack. I bought some gyoza sauce from Trader Joe's and could not find it!  The only thing I would do is cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup. I cut it to 1/2 cup and everyone remarked it was a bit tangy. It wasn't bad, but I think reducing the vinegar would be key.  I only used about 1/8 of the red pepper flakes, which gave this sauce some sass and heat, but wasn't dragon fire hot.  My family did notice the heat, though, so adjust according to your tolerance for spice.

This sauce was really good, but a little too tart for my tastes. I'm used gyoza sauce being a little sweeter, so I looked around to see what I had on hand, and ended up adding maple syrup to the recipe. Worked like a charm, but next time I might just use less rice vinegar.

This sauce was way too acidic. The vinegar was much too strong, and I agree with other comments to cut it back. Made to the recipe, it was too pungent for me, but I was able to easily save it by adding brown sugar. I will definitely use this recipe again, but I will be modifying to portions.

This sauce defiantly lacked something. I did add siracha sauce to it as well as the red pepper flakes. We like things spicy we used it with our fresh spring rolls along with the peanut sauce from this site. It was good to mix them. Not sure if I'd make it again.

Love how easy it is! I use ground ginger because that's what I have, and I add about 1Tbsp honey to balance the acidity of the vinegar. Toss all into a Mason jar, shake and done!

Good and simple recipe; I used less vinegar as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added some mirin to balance the saltiness a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight. After reading others' reviews, I lowered the vinegar down to 1/3 cup, added a bit more low sodium soy sauce, added some honey (I just eyeballed it, but I'm guessing it was between 1/4 of a teaspoon and 1/3 of a teaspoon) and I left out the red pepper flakes just because most in my family don't care for them. 

This turned out really great! I made it to go with the pork goyoza from Trader Joe's which is also awesome. 

Thank you for such a great recipe!

I wish I would have read the reviews before making it. The vinegar was way too overpowering. Cutting it to 1/3C should help it when I make it again. It also needs some sugar. I added about a teaspoon of white sugar which helped. Thanks for saving us from buying  the expensive stuff in the bottle.

I made it exactly as written with fresh ingredients. This was not to our taste unfortunately. The vinegar is so overpowering! We tried using it as is at first but we ended up having to add quite a bit of sugar to tone it down and even that did not help.

I made this to dip pot stickers in.  It came out great as it is written.  I had leftover sauce so I used it to marinade chicken wings.  They grilled up beautifully and were delicious.  I want to make this a keep it in the fridge so I always have it on hand.

Absolutely perfect.  I must admit, I ran out of rice vinegar once and used chinese cooking wine instead.  Added a bit of a kick, but worked.  Kudos!

Good beginning with a tweak or 2. I agree, less vinegar or none at all is my taste. I allowed fresh grated ginger, mashed garlic cloves and chopped up grn onions to marinate in the lite soy overnight. I then strain it n added the sesame oil and 1 T of sugar. Made 1/2 the recipe (1 cup). I did drizzle in some Hoisen sauce and shook it all up in a jar. Then, because I cook 6 goyza (or potsickers) at a time for myself...I freeze the dipping sauce in these small shot size tupperware containers I have. I thaw one out when needed. When I used to buy frozen P stickers...it always came with a little bag of frz dip sauce...I now know I do not like the vinegar at all. I just tried it out and it wasn't what I'm used to. Outside of that ingredient, it's pretty good.

This recipe is awesome. The only tweak I made was doing 1/4 C vinegar and 1/4 C Aji-mirin...gave the sauce a little bit of sweetness but it is awesome on pot stickers, thanks Rebecca!

Delicious!  I drizzled this over chicken stir fry, and it was a very nice change from the normal sauce that I use.  Tonight, I am going to try this as a steak marinade.

This is great. Much cheaper but more flavorful than the bottle ones. And it's very easy!
