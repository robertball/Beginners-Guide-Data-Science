very good recipe.  I don't cut up the meat but cook it like a pot roast recipe.  Other reviewers I think are mistaking a head of garlic for a clove of garlic.  A head is the entire bulb containing 8 or more cloves.  The recipe actuallly calls for about 16 cloves!  Just peel and leave them whole.  It is the crushing and chopping that releases the intense garlic flavour. Uncut garlic has a sweeter gentler taste and 16 really isn't too much.

Wow.  This was absolutely incredible.  Taking heed to the warnings about blandness, I used 4 heads of garlic - enough to keep most people from bothering me for a week - I chopped 20 cloves and put the other 20 in whole.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I live alone, and this recipe fed me for 2 weeks.  It didn't spoil, I never got tired of it, and best of all the longer it sat in the fridge, the more the garlic seeped into the beef.  I'm just finishing up the last of it, and it's the best of the batch!  I put it over bow-tie pasta, with a little salt - this is just GREAT!  Will definitely make this again!

I just finished eating this, and it was pretty good.  I followed the recipe except I did it in a slow cooker (low for 7 hours).  The meat was fall-apart tender.  I think the problem is that the only flavor that came through was garlic, and honestly the texture of the beef wasn't to our liking.  More like pot roast than I was expecting.  I couldn't tell if it was trying to be Italian or not, but I thought sour cream would be good on it, so I added a dollop after a few bite fulls.  That was better.  Still not something I'd make again "as is" (nothing to write home about) but a good jumping point for something.  Thanks for this recipe I appreciate it!

OK recipe.  The beef was wonderfully tender, like a well cooked pot roast.  Just needed a little more "spice" according to my hubby.  Served with wide egg noodles, was just a little bland.

I used Stew beef (non super lean kind-i havent had good experiences with the lean kind) and it was marvelous. I did however cut the stew chunks into smaller pieces and remove some of the fat. I used the amount of olive oil indicated and then let it sit overnight in the frig and pulled out the grease and oil that gathered on the top layer. I used elephant garlic so I only needed 3 of the giant cloves but I cut them up because I wanted a super garlicy meat. I served this over yellow and white rice for color and garnished with chives. Enjoy! This is a keeper.

My husband loved this. That alone gets it a five star review. I halved the recipe and skipped the olives. I had fresh Roma tomatoes from my garden which I blanched and crushed before adding. I served this over egg noodles.

Very good. Everyone in the family loved this dish.  Make sure you do not mistake the heads of garlic and use only cloves.  You need to use the entire head.

Could someone please tell me what cut of meat to use for this recipe??? I used top round (a lean cut, as called for) and it was tough, not tender like everyone has been saying. 2 heads of garlic was enough garlic flavor the next day, but not the day of. It neede to sit 24 hours for the flavor to really set in.

This was delicious. We ate it with noodles & fresh bread. I added extra tomato, onion, and garlic. Next time I will omit the oil though, it didn't add anything.

My husband and I are looking for new recipes for steak all the time. This one will be a hit now! All I had was some cube steaks but it  only made them really tender and incredibly seasoned. So I know when I make it next time with a different steak it will be different but great! We can't wait to try it!This is really a garlic lovers recipe.Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!  So simple and delicious.  It's just like the Filipino recipe called MECHADO, but cooked in the oven. This cut of meat that usually turns out tough when I cook it was really tender.  And to keep the meat from being bland (as other reviewers warned), I seasoned it with salt, pepper, basil and red pepper flakes.  Thanks for sharing =)

The only things I would do differently next time would be: 1)add more olives and 2)add more garlic-the recipe was terrific... the only complaint heard at the table was from our 10yr old "the meat won't stay on the fork" it was so tender. We put the left overs in flour tortillas. One suggestion, it even tastes better the second day, so make it the day before the meal!!!!  and don't worry about the amount, it is so good it will go! Promise.

Smell sneaks out of the oven after about an hour and oozes all over the house, folks start flockin in literally. I believe it could use less oil but it was fork tender . I used two 14 oz cans of chopped tomatoes , one of which was Orginal Rotel. I also added about 1 TBSP each of Italian Seasoning and Dude Dust, which can be found at www.garlicdude.com . I also drizzled in about 5 TBSP of the  Black Olive Brine. This meal developed perfectly in my Cast Iron Dutch Oven .

Extremely simple if you have already peeled garlic.  I loved the flavor and even the two year old ate it.  I added a dash of Italian dressing b/c I was low on garlic(that's a first)!  Thank you!!

YUM! I wish I would've had 4 lbs of the beef (I only had 2) because it went so fast! I had to substitute green olives for the black and diced Mexican tomatoes for the crushed but I think that just added to the flavor. Some were saying it was kind of bland but mine wasn't with these substitutions - there was a bit of a bite. The garlic wasn't at all overpowering and maybe I'll add even more next time. Great recipe - thanks!

My  husband loved this! I used Italian sauage instead of steak and served over egg noodles. If you use the Italian saugae you may want to leave out the oil that is poured on top. I haven't tried this yet but will next time as the sauage is greaser than steak.

This is a great beef recipe.  I used boneless sirloin steak that I cut into strips instead of cubes and did not use two heads of garlic, just one and I sliced up the cloves.  I added a can of tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes and didn't add any olives.  It was very tender and flavorful plus I am thinking not too horrible fat-wise because I used a very lean cut of meat.  We served it over rice with  veggies and bread.

I adapted this recipe for the pressure cooker by cutting the meat into 1" cubes, browning it in the 1/3 cup oil, and cooking everything at high pressure for 60 minutes.  Also, it turned out I didn't have any crushed tomatoes so I used marinara sauce.  It was wonderful.  The next time I make it I will probably add some vegetables such as cabbage, green beans, carrots, during the last 15 minutes (or last hour if cooking in the oven).  I took some leftovers to work and the girls loved it!

I love this recipe! I did it in the crockpot, since its warm here. Instead of the olives, I added 1 sm can of mushrooms drained and 1 finely minced jalepeno, for a little spicier flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

I was highly disappointed in this recipe.  My husband and I are huge garlic fans and this recipe had no garlic flavor at all.  I used 2 and 1/2 large heads of garlic.  The meat was moist, but flavor was very lacking.  We ate it and used the sauce with mashed potatoes.

I was very disapointed with this recipe. The meat turned out very tender but the sauce was bland and tasteless. I used a whole large head of garlic chopped up and added some Italian Herbs and Beef Stock (in place of the olive oil) but it still just tasted like beef cooked in a tin of chopped tomatoes. Sorry but I won't be making this again.

I've made this recipe twice now.. the first time I made it with the whole garlic cloves and it was good but it didn't have enough flavor. The second time I chopped up the cloves and made the rest according to the recipe and that did the trick. The flavor just seeps out into the gravy and fills the house with a wonderful aroma.  Definitely chop the garlic!
Great meal!

This is to die for.  My variation was to add a third head of garlic (NOT for the faint of heart!) and substituted 3 cans of "Mexican Style Rotel with Lime Juice and Cilantro" for the crushed tomatoes.  This is wonderful wrapped in tortillas or served over noodles or rice.

This was great!  Only comment. . .add a little white pepper to it.  The husband couldn't get enough; the kids thought too many tomatoes; I loved it!  It takes about 10 minutes to prepare and just pop in the oven.  Delicious!  Thanks again.

Blah. Bland. Boring.  I left out olives, but otherwise made as directed.  The sauce was watery and other than garlic, lacked flavor.  Won't make again.

QUESTION!!!! Do you think I could use bacon instead of beef?  Maybe if I omit the oil?  (Note: I haven't made this recipe yet, but I promise to review it and rate it for real once I do.)

This didn't get rave reviews at our house and we all love garlic.  I used 1/2 crushed tomato and 1/2 salsa to give it a bit of "umph".  It was very tender!

My family loved this recipe, the beef literally melts in your mouth.  I thought the olives were a bit strange, but they were a nice touch. I heeded the warnings about blandness as well and added 3 heads of garlic.  I also stewed my own tomatoes for this.

Tender tender tender, garlic-infused beef.  I served it over white rice and made the "French Bread Rolls to Die For" recipe to sop up the gravy.  Very hearty meal.

This is sooo easy.  I served it with rice.  The sauce is kind of watery, might add some flour and water to thicken it up a bit next time. I used a head and a half of garlic. My family really enjoyed this one! Oh and definately add a bunch of black olives to it!

This is my kind of cooking. In Seattle where we come from it would be ideal any time of year.  Here in the desert (106today) I use my crockpot after browning the meat.  7 hours on low and it's done.  Fantastic!

I made this for my family, which includes 2 picky eaters, and they loved it!  We think it tastes alot like Swiss steak.  Leftovers taste great wrapped in a tortilla.

We added more garlic and chopped it up pretty good before adding it. Gave it much more flavor. We also added mushrooms.

Came out very bland and not at all what I expected.  Needs a lot more garlic and some soy or Worcheshire sauce to wake it up a bit.  It was easy, but bland.
