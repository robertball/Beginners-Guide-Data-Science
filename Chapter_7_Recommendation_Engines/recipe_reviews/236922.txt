I love this rub as it made the pork loin very juicy and tender. I am going to triple this and save it for future uses. The loin sliced so nicely and each fairly crunchy and flavorful slice had the rub taste. Def. not spicy just right.

I make this up and keep it in a mason jar.  I use it on so many things!  It's very flavorful, but not too spicy.  I can always add spices if I need to for a particular dish.  As written, it works for us.   We love it!  Thanks for posting it!

This rub is terrific! Only 4 stars simple b/c I added leftover morning coffee to the rub. After I marinaded it a few hours, I reduced it and made a glaze to go over the Tri Tip roast I had grilled.Very nice! Thank You Jamie:) Keeper!

Excellent! Used this on a small pork roast that I cooked in the slow cooker for to make pulled pork.  I pretty much reduce everything by half, since I didn't need a whole lot, and I used some smoked sea salt as I had that on hand.  Smelled so good, and tasted even better!  Seriously, I didn't even need to add anything else.  Can't wait to use this on ribs

Made this last night for a pork shoulder roast.  FANTASTIC! Cannot wait to try it on chicken!  Next time I'll try substituting smoked paprika for half amount of paprika amount.  A must staple in my kitchen! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this and it WAS GREAT!!! Thanks for the Recipe!  Loved the Cayenne Kick!!  I'm just one guy, live by myself and never married, so I didn't take and spoon out all kinds of seasonings, Tsp this Tbl sp of that. And I just sprinkled on all of the seasonings after I smeared on a coating of Olive Oil so the seasonings will stick to the chops. They were very dry.
              I had almost 4 lbs of center cut chops called Iowa Chops.  A HUGE pack of it with 3 center cuts in it and real thick.  I sprinkled all the seasonings on both sides of 2 of them and rubbed it in. I should have only cooked one, couldn't eat the other.

I have used this on a pork shoulder as well as ribs. It makes great bark. I added a touch more brown sugar for the ribs. It is now my favorite.

This is very good. I think I am realizing that chili powder in a dry rub is not my favorite.  So I will reduce or eliminate it next time. I also only used about 1/2 tsp. cayenne.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I'm sure it's awesome as written - I only made changes b/c I didn't have the Chipotle chili powder and, I can't remember now, but I think I omitted some of the the cumin and dry mustard by accident. Also, I only had light brown sugar and I'm sure it didn't change the taste significantly.
I did intentionally cut down on the salt (I think I used half the amount of kosher salt), and subbed half of the paprika with smoked paprika to make up for the lack of Chipotle chili powder.
I smoked a pork butt with this rub today. It is excellent and makes one of the most flavorful barks I've ever tasted- I highly recommend it! Thank you for the recipe, and I can't wait to try it on other proteins.

I have recently began using this for chicken on my smoker as well.  Works great with whole chicken smoked.  Haven't tried with chicken in other pieces or a different cooking method.  Still love on all pork! 
This rub is a little spicy, but depending on how you cook it balances pretty well with the sweet.  When I smoke ribs I use this rub but if I hit them with the grill before serving I add a little sweet BBQ sauce to balance the heat.  For boston butt I have no problems with too much heat, my kids like it, as the surface area to mass on a pork shoulder is such I think it works well, and we seldom add sauce.  If you are cooking in a roaster or oven probably suggest using less rub than if rubbing for a smoker, where some of the juices will run off the rub.  Thanks for the feedback everyone!

I tried someone else's suggestion to use olive oil on the pork roast before adding the rub so it sticks.  I cut recipe to 2 servings for a 3 pound pork roast.  This recipe was so easy and got great reviews from our guests.

4/2/17. Made this as one of two 3lb pork loins on the grill for a good-sized family gathering using this rub with minor tweaks (no garlic powder, didn't have the dried Chipotle peppers). Was a huge hit with this who like spicy foods, and even those who typically don't like spicy foods liked it. I packed on the rub 18 hours before grilling the pork loin. Good penetration of the flavors. We will be making this again!

I didn't have kosher salt so I used a teaspoon of salt. Didn't have dried mustard so a slight change by adding a tbsp thyme. Great flavor....zesty and spicy. Have leftovers for next time I need something for pork or chicken. Two thumbs up

I rubbed this on a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight. I got up at 3:20am to put it in the oven and just 10 minutes into the cooking time, the wonderful smell woke everyone in the house. It was ready at 5:30pm and it was tender, easy to pull apart with two forks, not as spicy as I thought it would be because the rub is only on the outside, so it evens out the flavor once it's pulled apart. I served it on hoagie rolls and added some of the drippings with all the flavors to the bread. It was totally fabulous. I'm making 3 pork shoulders this weekend for both my adult children's birthdays/Memorial Day. This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!

UPDATE: this was fantastic on country style ribs!  only deviation was leaving out the sugar.. but i can see how it would work with the spices as we had our ribs alongside grilled yams.. so yummy! ~~original review: this was super tasty.. very peppery/spicy and that was with cutting the cayenne in half.. i also left out the brown sugar.. i used 1.5 servings (my math) on 2.75 lbs of chicken wings that we grilled/smoked.. if i were to make this on a bigger piece of meat i'd use the full amount of cayenne.. ty for the recipe

Exellent  Rub! I used it on smoked Pork Butt and Spare ribs so far..definitely easy , not too spicy.I use kosher salt and black pepper first, rub that into the meat well, then generous amount of this rub, smoke meat for 3 hrs, spraying with apple juice every hour, wrap meat in foil with bbq sauce and butter inside, poke 2 small holes in foil..put back in smoker on low heat another hour or so..take out and let set wrapped for 15 min..YUM!, pour drippings from foil over meat..I also add 2 TB of this rub to any BBQ sauce I make..takes it up a notch for sure!thanks for sharing this recipe

Awesome rub!  Put it on our steaks for tonight’s dinner and rubbed on the ribs we’ll be having on it tomorrow. The steak came out delicious and wonderfully caramelized.  Only change I made was not using salt, for us it didn’t need the other flavors are so great that you don’t miss it.

Worked great on Instant Pot pork ribs. We don't like super spicy food, so I cut back a wee bit on the chipotle pepper (I used 1 tsp) but otherwise made the recipe as-is. Much to my surprise, it wasn't all that spicy. Would like to try this on chicken. This is my go-to for ribs for sure. Husband loved it too.

This is only the second time I’ve made dry rub.  I really like this recipe.  It is very tasty and has a bit of a kick but not too spicy.  I used it while making Chef John’s BBQ Pulled Pork.  It was a great process and yeilded a tasty meal!

This is a great rub mixture.  The only change I make is to reduce the salt a bit, but that's just because we don't like things that are too salty. I add salt, if needed, to the meat after it's done cooking. Chef John's Pulled Pork from this site is fantastic. A great combination.

I did not add the chipotle peppers. We smoked a pork butts. I first rubbed mustard on the butt so the dry rub would stay on the meat. We were happy with the outcome.

I made this rub for smoking a pork loin. It was delicious!  However, I cut way back on the cayenne because it can really make things hot!!

Great great rub made just as is - a bit of a kick but, certainly not over the top!!!!  Used on pork chops cooked on bbq.  Loved by all.

This tub is amazing. I rubbed it on a 3lb pork shoulder and let it sit in my refrigerator for a day. I cooked it on 275 and it turned out perfect. I also put it on a chicken cutlet and cooked it in a frying pan. That was delicious also. I had everything in my cart that I keep my spices in to make this rub. This is my new go to. Thanks

I followed this recipe exactly except didn't have the Chipotle peppers and used twice as much brown sugar. I used this on some boneless pork ribs then wrapped in bacon. this is an exceptional flavored rub. flavorful and not too spicy. everyone loved the flavor. I saved this to my favorites will make again maybe buy some Chipotle peppers next time. definitely 5 stars

I have never been able to eat a pork chop without using a knife. My husband seriously inquired as to how and where I saved this recipe for future reference. It was terrific.

Excellent rub. The only think I did different was cut back on the cumin.

Fantastic rub! Recipe yields quite a bit. I had a tenderloin roughly 0.8 Lbs and still had about a cup of rub left over. I’ll use it for some chops later. Great tongue tingling heat and a slight sweetness. Looking forward to using this rub again and again!

Even better the second time when I cut the salt amount in half.
