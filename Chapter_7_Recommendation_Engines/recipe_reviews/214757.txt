Excellent recipe. I'm 76yrs old and have lived in the south all of my life and know cornbread. This is the first to include cottage cheese as an ingredient. Thank you for sharing Pap's recipe. We enjoyed it and I'll make it again.
Allrecipes is my favorite site for cooking ideas and I'll never understand how cooks completely change a recipe and rate it down when it's no longer the same recipe after they finish destroying the original. I don't have an answer for this because you see it all the time in reviews but it's a real flaw in the idea of a review. And so unfair to the individual who took the time to write and share a recipe.

After googling, I made my own self-rising cormeal mix (I don't keep that on hand, just regular cornmeal). The only thing this recipe was missing was sugar, my family likes their cornbread sweet so I used a scant 3/4 cup. Before baking, I threw a good portion of butter into the cold skillet and let it warm in the oven as it preheated, then swirled the butter around in the hot pan before adding the cornbread batter. This cornbread was very moist and the bacon fat made it REALLY tasty. My husband liked the flavor the cottage cheese gave to this cornbread, he though I'd added sour cream. Good recipe that is easily personalized.

I made my own self-rising cornmeal based on the ingredients given on a food substitution website. I didn't take it into consideration that there is already a fat in this recipe and used both (the one described in the substitution and on here) which may have caused my cornbread to be overly moist. Instead of buttermilk I used another substitution; 2% milk and lemon juice. I used 2% cottage cheese. I added chopped up bacon and diced roasted red peppers. I do not have a cast-iron skillet so I greased a small rectangular baking dish and baked it for 25 minutes. The crust was a dark brown, but the top was only slightly golden and it was very moist but cooked in the middle. The cottage cheese is great in this recipe. I think I'll try combining this and the "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" recipe to see if that hits right in between.

Tastes JUST like my grandmothers only MOIST!! Everyone loved it. This is a real southern cornbread recipe.  NOT SWEET! cornbread is a bread and not supposed to be sweet, corn cakes & corn muffins are supposed to be sweet! Next time I will cut the fat to a 1/8 c. cause I like to butter my skillet so the crust is extra crunchy and buttery so it was a little too greasy for me with the butter AND bacon grease. YUM! Thank you!!!

The recipe is wonderful if you use common sense and do not change everything in the recipe.  You can even use glass bakeware instead of cast iron like I did for this recipe and it was outstanding.
  You cannot bake a  cake in a dish that is deep on high heat close to a burner - the center will not finish because there is too much batter and the heat is to high for the batter to completely cook. Most of the changes on here to recipes are good -

I was skeptical of this recipe, since I am not a fan of cottage cheese, but I love cast iron skillet-made corn bread and am always looking for a great recipe. I will look no more - I have found it! This truly is moist cornbread. I changed nothing. I didn't taste the cottage cheese, but it obviously made it moist - and the bacon fat really added to the flavor. It reminds me of the cornbread my grandmother made when I was a kid (but it's more moist)...

Awesome. This is how cornbread should taste. Cook it up just like the recipe says. Thanks to Pap Walters.

I had to use a 10" skillet on my second try because the center didn't get done. On the second try the cornbread got done, and it rose high enough in the bigger skillet. Great taste, and texture.

This was so so for my family. The outside darkened more then I cared for and the cottage cheese made it super moist, that the outside was done a lot quicker then the inside but sorry to say, it's not something I'd make again, just because of my family's preferences. It just didn't taste the way we all expected.

I've made this twice in one week. We loved it! My husband doesn't like sweet cornbread and since I'm not a native southerner I needed a good recipe for savory cornbread. The second time I made it I used a stick blender to smooth out the cottage cheese and I liked the texture better. The recipe was perfect as written so I won't be making any adjustments. Thank you so much for passing this recipe on. I won't reveal the secret ingredient because my husband probably wouldn't have tried it!

I substituted 1/8 c butter, 1/8 c grapeseed oil for the bacon fat,  and ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. 
Then I baked the mixture in a 8×8 pan at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.
These changes created a delicious,  moist, and sweet tasting  cornbread,  which I will gladly prepare again.

1.29.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214757/pap-walters-cornbread/ ... While the taste was okay, the look of the cottage cheese in the cornbread was a turn-off.  Somehow I thought it wouldn't be as evident.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is delicious cornbread. I used butter instead of bacon fat because I didn't have any & I had to adjust my time & oven temp because my cast iron skillet is only 8". Other than that I followed the recipe as is. I don't like sugar in cornbread so this is perfect for me & it is so moist. Probably the best I have ever had.

The texture was perfect but the bread had no flavor.  I may try it one more time and add sugar.  It was totally wasted because no one in the family liked it (and my husband will usually eat ANYTHING).

This was so moist and absolutely delicious! I added some a cup of frozen corn, 1/2 cup of diced jalapeno and about a half teaspoon of sugar because hubby likes it a little bit sweet. The sugar was the perfect compliment to bring out the flavor of the corn. I don't have cast iron as I have an iron overload condition so I just baked it in a 9" square pan and it turned out perfect. This is now my go to recipe for corn meal. We both absolutely loved it!
