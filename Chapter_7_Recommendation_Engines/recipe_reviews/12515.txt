This is a tricky one to review. For a start, I used only one pound of pork and 6oz of spicy brats, and there was more than enough meat for 2 pies. I knew there wouldn't be enough seasoning for our taste, so I added onion powder, garlic and Italian seasoning. I liked the flavor of the pork, but the texture was horrible. I might try this again but with sausage, 6oz ground beef and a little ground pork.

This was ok, my husband thought it was great.  If I do it again I could reduce the amt. of pork overall, especially the plain ground pork.  A little more Italian sausage & some Sage.  It was runny which I didn't like.
