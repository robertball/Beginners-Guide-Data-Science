Iused it for beef K bobs and dinner guests. It was a great hit.

Ihave then used it on Chicken breast on the grill and they were good.

This takes a lot of stuff but was worth the trouble. 
I'll use it again this weekend

This is a killer marinade - absolutely loved it and it was worth the effort!  I cut the recipe in half, but still kept the liquid smoke at 1 Tbsp.  I used italian seasoning for the salt free seasoning, dijon for the prepared mustard and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I marinated chicken thighs and drumsticks for a day and a half.  The chicken was very moist, full of flavor and had a rich caramel color coming off the grill.

This is wonderful!  We really like it for chicken; we marinate whole chickens for a day and then set them on a half full can of beer on the barbeque (indirect method).  My WHOLE family (husband, kids and grandkids) and our friends just love what we now call "Beer Butt Chicken" and this marinade recipe makes it!

I used this on Halibut and veggies on the grill and it was great. I will be using this alot this summer.  I did not have whiskey on hand. I used Italian seasoning for the salt-free and Lawry's for the seasoned salt.

I made this marinade for chicken while camping.  I followed the recipe, w/the exception of omitting browning sauce, simply because I didn't have any.  These were a nice tasting kabob.  I didn't LOVE them (there was a flavor I didn't really care for; I think, perhaps, the *alcohol* taste from the whiskey?), but will perhaps, make them again if I'm looking to mix things up.  TY for an interesting recipe!

I was actually searching gluten free recipes and this one was included in the search. If you are gluten intolerant, make sure to read labels, as alot of these ingredients tend to not be gluten free.

Delicious! We marinated a London Broil in this mixture for what turned out to be 2 days, and the flavor was wonderful. A tad on the sweet side for beef, so I added a few drops of hot sauce.  I am dying to try this  on chicken, exactly as written. I think the combination of ingredients would be absolutely perfect. Thanks so much, Christian!

This has got to be the best ever homemade marinade I've come across. I use it all the time & everyone loves the flavor of the meat.

This was a good marinade, but I had to tinker a bit as I don't use seasoning salt or salt-free blend, so perhaps as the author suggests, it's just not as good w/out them.  I compensated with Greek Seasoning and a fajita seasoning blend that's essentially like  seasoned salt. Overall, it made for a good marinade, though.

Holy smokes is this ever good.  I added 1 egg to the mix.  I cooked up some boneless skinless chicken thighs and they are incredible.  I grill a lot and I make some really good food, but this may be the best chicken I've EVER made.

Pretty darn good, but a little bit salty for my taste.  Would be perfect with a bit less salt.

Because I'm low on worchestershire sauce, I used all soy sauce. I made my own salt-free seasoning blend and instead of using garlic powder, I used fresh minced garlic. For the prepared mustard, I used dijon. I omitted the hickory smoke only because I was out at the moment and the seasoning salt because I did not want to have an overpowering flavor of salt and the soy sauce was salty enough as is. I mixed this up early this morning and set my chicken to marinade all day in it, only messing with it every few hours or so to rotate the chicken. This turned out a VERY flavorful chicken that really smelled amazing while it was cooking. I ended up serving this with Vegetable Fried Rice and it was a tasty and filling dinner that didn't cost much to make at all.

This was really good for grilled chicken. I cut down on the salt quite a bit but other than that followed the recipe. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is a good marinade and I used it on boneless chicken thighs overnight and grilled the following day. Turned out really good. For the salt free spice blend I used Italian herb blend. I may try something a little different next time. Im definitely saving this recipe to build from in the future.

I used this marinade on chicken overnight and it filled it will great flavor and that beautiful color of marinated meat. I am sure this would be great with steak as well. Will make again!
