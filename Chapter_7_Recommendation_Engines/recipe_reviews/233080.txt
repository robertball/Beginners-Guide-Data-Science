I've made this before and everyone loved them, but I learned to make them using two cream sides of the Oreo (so the no-cream side was left over).  You use double the Oreos but both sides adhere to the PB cup without having to melt it and the symmetry is more pleasing to the eye.  That may be just me though...:P  Regardless, I use two cream sides of Double Stuf Oreos, one PB cup, then dip it in the chocolate and sprinkle a little something pretty on top.  You'll be on a sugar high for hours.  I imagine using white chocolate might be pretty spectacular, as well.

The best of both worlds! I used candy making chocolate instead of chocolate chips b/c I like the flavor better, and it sets up nicer for me. I drizzled the tops w/ extra chocolate and added sprinkles to 1/2, just for a prettier appearance. These were super simple to make and very tasty...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So rich and delicious! A little coconut oil (instead of shortening) helps the chocolate melt very smoothy. I also put two dabs of peanut butter to hold the cookies to the peanut butter cup. So good!

Simple, quick and very sweet. Overall a good recipe, I made the mistake of using mini Reese's instead of full sized. I also substituted bakers chocolate for regular Hershey's bars which turned out pretty good. A little too sweet for me, I could only eat 2 or 3 before my stomach hurt.
