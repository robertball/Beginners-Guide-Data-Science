I'm Swedish and these are almost perfect renditions of my favorite cafe treat: chokladbollar. Pearl sugar is hard to find in the US, though, so you can roll them in sweetened coconut flakes or coarse grind turbinado sugar, too.

Excellent!  Very quick and easy!  Was extremely popular with the group I made it for; the men especially loved it!  Texture is a bit unusual, but is not a deterrent considering the wonderful taste and ease of preparation.  You might want to double the recipe - it only makes about 24 balls IF you don't eat much dough during preparation! (The dough is delicious!)  The way these taste, 24 balls just isn't enough!

I made these for a Swedish themed Christmas Party...they disappeared very quickly!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  These are SO good, and so easy to make (it's almost embarrasing!). 
I used Sugar in the Raw (Turbinado Sugar)as I could not find pearl sugar, but was later able to find it at a Swedish gift shop.  I'm making them again today with the pearl sugar!
Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe with us!!

I made these for a party.  Each person who tried one, put it aside without finishing it.  Most went to waste.

Made these for my son’s cultural exchange class.  He said the kids chased him around the classroom to get the last ones.  Used Washed Raw Cane (Turbinado Style) Sugar instead of the pearl sugar and used Starbuck’s Frappuccino (coffee Flavored) instead of regular cold coffee.

I was good. I used the sugar in the raw and it worked out great.  I had to re-refrigerate a portion in the middle of a party because they started getting too warm and losing shape. 

I put half of the batch in the freezer for 10 minutes and then swaped them out with the ones on the table and put those in for 10 minutes. worked like a champ

I remember these from when I was a little kid in Denmark. They're also really good rolled in grated coconut.

Totally awesome - give these a try.  They're different then most sweets, and amazingly delicious, although slightly addictive.  I added a little more oatmeal to stiffen it up, though.  Fantastic.  Am going to make another batch right now.

This were really deliciouis little things! I accidently used almond extract instead of vanilla at first, too, and it was an interesting and tasty flavor combination, try it. Also, the submitter of this reipe was right...the batter is hard to resist as well. Sor something so simple, these sure are good.

Weird texture - gritty and too soft at the same time!  I'm going to stick to traditional Rum Balls (Nilla wafers, chopped raisins and nuts, rum, cocoa, corn syrup) - infinitely more enjoyable, both by adults and kids.

this recipe is awsome, brought back childhood memories. I added 2 tbsp. of bourbon, can use rum to and a touch more oatmeal to absorb extra moisture, everyone was in wow over them. I found they were much better with quick oats to, made some with reg. oats and they were chewy. when I make them again, I will put mixture in fridge for 15 min. think it will make rolling a little less messy

It's so nice to find a no-bake cookie with cocoa in it that does not call for coconut. My husband is allergic, and just omitting that ingredient sometimes wrecks the recipes. This was really good. I used 2 heaping tablespoons of cocoa and more like 3 tablespoons of really strong coffee. The coffee was still warm, but I put the dough in the fridge so it would be easier to roll into balls. I used icing sugar to coat the cookies. This made around 22 smallish cookies, but they're soooo good. I agree with previous reviewers, the batter was disappearing almost as fast as I was rolling it... Thanks, Manuela, for sharing!

These were so good! We finished them all ourselves, so I'm making some more now to give away. I rolled some in sprinkles, some in ground almonds, some in chopped hazelnuts, and some in desiccated coconut. They looked really fancy! The texture was a bit unexpected but they were delicious nonetheless

I loved these because they were so good and a snap to make.  I didn't really notice the coffee flavor in the finished cookie, so I may add some instant granules in addition to the 2 Tbsp of coffee listed in the ingredients next time around.  Definitely will make again!  THANKS for sharing a wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper!

Very easy and quick to make. I love these no bake dessert recipes!  They went over big with my husband who's a real chocaholic. He suggested that the mixture sit for a while so the oats soften a bit. I'll see how that goes when I repeat the recipe.  I am tempted next time to add some chocolate liqueur.  Couldn't hurt!
