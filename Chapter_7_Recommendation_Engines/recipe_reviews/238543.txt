I love this salad! I don't care for celery seed though, so the only thing I did differently was to swap it out for a little bit of fresh dill. So easy, so yummy!

Instead of green peppers I added yellow and orange peppers and also for the added color I put in the purple onion. Not too hot and it tasted delicious.

I made this for a carry in dinner at work. It was very easy and everyone loved it. I cut out about a half cup of the sugar and used fresh dill instead of the celery seeds. We had a lot of food left over at our dinner but none of the cucumber salad was left!

Made it for my sister's bridal shower and it was delicious !  Maybe I'd cut back on the sugar if I make it again for my family or myself.  I also added red and yellow peppers and red onion to make a lovely colourful dish.  I was also able to prepare it the night before - BONUS!

I cut the recipe as I'm the only one that eats it. 3/4c sliced cucumbers; 1/4 cup sliced onions and peppers, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 tsp celery seed and salt.  Next time I won't use celery seed or peppers and might add some tomato. Update on 5/22/17, decided I had to modify this too much and found another I liked better without the celery seed or peppers so removed this one from my file.

This is a great starter recipe. It's easy to adjust to your liking. I used cider vinegar instead of white, I also used cherry tomatoes quartered instead of peppers and I blended in 3/4 cup of real mayonnaise (Dukes).

This recipe tastes exactly like my grandmothers cucumber salad. Since she passed I have tried to duplicate it or find one similar. This is spot on!

I made this for company and they loved it!  I sliced my cucumbers and onions very thin,  because that is how my husband like them, and these were a great addition to a summer meal.

Perfect!  We like it more tart than sweet, I did the same as others:  cut sugar in half and added dill weed. Favorite with turkey burgers.

I omitted the green pepper because of a picky eater but followed the rest to a T.  Oh my goodness...it was delicious! This will be a regular at our house during cucumber season!

Not as sweet as I'd thought it might be.  I added 1/4 c oil to this and dill. Very good.

Very good- had to add fresh dill and forego the celery seed so it was like MY grandmother's!  Also reduced the sugar.

I will definitely make this again! I love the sweet & sour flavor. I sliced the cucumbers and onion very thin, but did not use the bell pepper. It reminds me of summertime on the farm.

I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, still very sweet but good. Also used a little dill weed.  I like to add some fresh chopped tomatoes just before serving.

Very good! I read the other reviews and did the same on the sugar, cut it back a half cup. Perfect!
