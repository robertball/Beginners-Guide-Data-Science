I was about to post a similar recipe to this when I noticed your entry. I learned this recipe in my Home Ec class all the way back in middle school and I've cooked it ever since. Here are some important modifications I've learned that will solve some complaints about flavor problems.

1. Cook the peas separately and set them aside.
2. Cook the bacon in the pan, remove the bacon, and crumble. Leave the bacon grease in the pan.
3. Add ONIONS! I don't measure, just use common sense and add a proportional amount, chopped. 
4. Fry the onions right in the bacon grease until they start to turn clear and slightly browned. Then add the (raw) chopped carrots and cook those for a few minutes. 
5. At this point, I shove everything to one side with a spatula and cook the eggs right in the pan on the empty side. Less pans to deal with later and it's easy/fast. Scramble them in a separate bowl first, then pour in the pan.
6. Once the eggs are scrambled and chopped up, add the peas, bacon, and rice.
7. I don't measure the soy sauce I use, but itâ€™s probably more than 2 tbs. I pour on until everything is well coated. This way you don't need to add salt - the soy sauce takes care of that.

Hopefully these suggestions help. It's not authentic fried rice but it tastes awesome. I used to use vegetable oil but the bacon grease is already there and it tastes great (if a bit unhealthy... ah well).

Tasty, although I did make the following changes:  I omitted the salt, bacon and mixed veggies, used small frozen peas in place of the snow peas an increased the amount of soy sauce.  I also added scallions and fresh minced garlic.  I think the addition of some chopped onion would be good as well.  The egg can be cooked at the same time the rice is cooking.  Simply push the rice to one side, drop in egg and scramble, then mix all ingredients together.   My husband commented several times at dinner how good the rice was.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not authentic rice but VERY good! We all loved this!  I used just one bag of frozen broccoli stir fry veggies to avoid chopping, which had broccoli, onions, mushrooms, celery, red peppers and water chesnuts and cooked them in the mircowave. I used only 3 cups of cooked rice and when it came time to add the rice to the bacon grease, I added the veggies, soy sauce and bacon all at once. Right before serving, I added the scrambled eggs.  It DOES take up a lot of dishes to make this but everyone in my family loved it and I will make it again!

I throughly enjoyed this rice. The secret is using cold rice. Cooking it in the bacon grease gave it tons of flavor. I'm giong to make it again tonight with mixed vegetable instead of just peas.

Until now, I was over-confident thinking that my homemade fried rice recipe was the best. This was great!! I did reduce the soy sauce a little, upped the amount of rice and added veggies I like (bean sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, pea pods and red bell peppers).  This recipe can easily be adjusted! Great base for you to be creative! Out goes my old recipe!

This bacon-fried rice is really good.  I would add less vegetables, though.  I found that it became veggies with rice instead of rice with veggies.  Tastes great, however!

I had leftover peas and carrots and needed a quick recipe using on-hand ingredients.  This was easy and inexpensive.  I agreed with many other reviewers that it was lacking in flavor but I also didn't add much soy sauce while cooking.  Because I anticipated "blandness" I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water so this probably helped.  I was tempted to give it a 5 because my often picky toddler LOVED it!!  A quiet, struggle-free meal is worth every effort in the kitchen. Thank you!!  We'll keep this in the rotation for sure!

Pretty tasty and with cold leftover rice, this is a easy recipe!  I made it all in one big non-stick pan, never taking anything out!  I fried up bacon, leaving half the grease then added the cold leftover rice, breaking up as it heated.  Next added the eggs ontop of rice and working it in; threw in veggies. Let cook about 4-5 minutes until veggetables and eggs are done.  I seasoned with galic salt hot tabasco for some kick.  Who ever wanted soy sauce added it to their own rice.

This was quick.  I think my only complant is you have to use so many pans to prepare it.  The taste was worth it.

I wasn't too impressed with this dish.  It just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I think next time I'll use less veggies and a little more bacon and soy.  Maybe that'll help.

This wouldn't be that quick to make if you didn't use pre-cooked ingredients. I wanted to use up some leftover rice and cooked bacon so I choose this recipe, but if I had to fry the bacon, cook the rice, cook the frozen veggies and fry the eggs I don't think it would have been that quick! The taste was pretty good, a little salty though. I used 4 eggs with 1 cup already cooked brown rice and I left out the 1/2 teaspoon salt.

I only made 1 cup of rice.  I also cooked some meat and when it was done I cooked an egg in the same pan I had cooked the meat in, and added the rice, some frozen veggies and some soy sauce.  Then I added the meat back in. It was a nice one-dish meal.

Had a ton of left over white rice and was about to throw it out when I came across this recipe. I skipped the bacon (had none) and it still came out delicious! Will definitely save this one. Thanks!

This was awesome! Very easy and tasted sooo yummy:-) I cooked some chicken in thai sauce (homemade too) and put it all in a casserole dish, then heated it (since dinner was postponed) later and it was still really yummy!

This was very good.  I used fresh carrots cooked in the microwave, and frozen peas cooked in the micro too.  I added a chopped onion to the bacon grease, then added egg to that.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I loved it!

I thought this was an okay recipe. I ended up cooking my rice with chicken broth to give the dish more flavor. Even with the chicken broth the dish still lacked flavor it was bland in my opinion and had way to many vegetables and not enough egg or bacon! It was more of a bedding of vegetables with a little rice. Next time I will put less vegetables, add another egg and add more spices for more flavor.  This is a good starter recipe but not one that will have them asking for more. Even my 2 boys "who eat everything" said it's wasn't that good...the only thing I did different from the original recipe was cook the rice in chicken broth....don't see why everyone is raving about this recipe it's not all that great

Super simple, super yummy! I didn't bother putting the extra veggies in since I used a 16 oz bag of frozen veggies. I also didn't use the salt-don't know where that was needed. Overall, it was a great addition to our Chinese dinner!

Nice, quick and easy.  This is a great basic fried rice with very simple seasonings.  I realized after I started making this that I forgot to pick up snow peas, so I added a chopped onion instead.  Loved the ease of use frozen veggies in this dish.  I like to use frozen rice when I make fried rice, so I always have a bag made ahead in the freezer.  If you have the rice made ahead, this dinner comes together very quickly and can become a main dish with the addition of extra meats; i.e.  chicken, pork, beef, shrimp - This is a dish that I will make again and again.

This is anything but quick but it was good although very dry. I would add a little beef or chicken broth to the last cooking stage. It was indeed very tasty and I'll make this one again.

This was delicious. I just used the bacon fat i had saved previously. No bacon. I used veggies i had in the fridge, left out the salt. We will have this OFTEN. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Good stuff! I made this with the Japenese Chicken Wings. Loved the flavor that the bacon gave everything. Instead of peas, I just used diced up carrots, came out great!

Thanks for the idea of how to cook a good dish. I did cook a variation.  I did not use the bacon and I added some Indian spices to it.  It turned out well.

This fried rice is great! Followed some others advice and added onions and garlic powder. Also, in place of bacon I used turkey bacon just because my husband does not eat pork. I love this recipe. Best fried rice I have ever made!

I used this as my guideline for my first real attempt at fried rice. I didn't add the vegetables because the fam voted against them, but I did add some shredded chicken and it was pretty good. The family really enjoyed it. Next time might try to add some of the veggies before the crew comes bounding in.

These were good. My frozen veggies had carrot andn peas so I did not add anything else.
