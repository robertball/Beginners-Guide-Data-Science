I made this very colorful salad as one of my side dishes for the Baby Back Ribs I made in the oven I built from Mother Earth News.  (Oven, grill, smoker, stove).  It was a hit with the people, and I wish I had quadrupled the recipe, as I had doubled the recipe as  None was left. 
I added more chopped red onions due to their sweet and interesting flavor.  I also added some sauteed shrimp that was cut in half. Great recipe

This dish was gone in a flash! Everyone loved it! Very light, fresh, and beautiful dish. This is a great summery dish, perfect for barbeque get togethers! This will be made often!

We absolutely loved the smoked taste from the roasted corn and peppers in this salad.  It was light, yet so full of flavor!  I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I made this according to the recipe, with one omission -- I left out the greens, as I was already serving a green salad. The salad was delicious, and less time consuming to make than I expected. Roasting the corn gave it a nutty, smokey flavor which put it over the top. My husband really loved it, and it was a very colorful addition to my  Labor Day buffet. Will definitely make it again, no alterations needed.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted green and red bell peppers for the tomatoes because  we were  not going to eat it until the next day and tomatoes do not hold up well.  Made a very eye appealing salad and very tasty too.

This recipe is both beautiful and delicious. I have made it several times and have at times added avocado and or fresh basil. Definitely double the recipe so you can munch on the leftovers the next day! Ps... Trader Joe's has packs of multicolored heirloom tomatoes that are very reasonable.

Great summer salad. Good for warm spring days too when you're itching to get the grill going. Per another review, I added a bit of feta cheese. Served with grilled pork chops.

I added 1/4 cup of feta cheese. The roasted corn made this dish sweet and delish. Will definitely make this again!

How crazy am I, but I subbed 1 1/2c thawed frozen corn & regular tomatoes chopped.  I also just made the "topping," no salad mix.  Pretty, but not wowing in flavor.
