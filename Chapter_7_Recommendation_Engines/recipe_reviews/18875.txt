My son goes to college at Northwestern in the Chicago area, so when he was home for a visit, I wanted to make an authentic stuffed pizza like the ones he enjoyed so much there.  This was a good recipe but we have some suggestions for improvement.  We thought the pizza dough would be better without the cornmeal and prefer our traditional pizza dough recipe.  Also, there was a complaint that there was not enough mozzarella cheese.  My sister, who lived in Chicago for years, said, "Whatever it is, it's good," which suggested it was not quite like the Chicago stuffed pizzas she'd had. Also, I think it would be better to add the tomato sauce on during the last 5 to ten minutes of cooking so it retains the rich red color and does not look browned and dry, and it could use a sprinkle of parmesan on top.  As I made the recipe, my son advised me that sliced tomatoes must be included in the filling, and that was very good.  The next night, I tried it again, and this time made a sauteed fresh spinach, onion, and mushroom filling (not forgetting the sliced tomatoes), my usual pizza dough recipe, and a spaghetti sauce topping added during the last 10 minutes, more cheese, and it was given far better reviews.  Hope this helps!

I came up with a great idea! Use a springform (aka cheesecake) pan! This recipe is a little big for a 9 inch springform so don't use all of the dough. When the pizza is done all you have to do is take off the side of the pan and slide the pizza on a cutting board.  I used onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms and thawed, drained frozen spinich in my pizza. YUM This recipe took me much longer than the estimate given, but I will make it again.

Because I read a previous review stating that there wasn't enough dough for a deep dish pan, I used the recipe that came with my pan for the crust.  Everything else was the same and I loved it.  My husband who isn't that fond of pizza even liked it.  This is great.

I was born and raised 20 min. outside of chicago and stuffed pizza is my absolute fav.  this recipe is really good.  those who are comparing their results to a restaurant aren't really being fair.  most chicago restaurants have special ovens.  it makes a difference.  the only changes i would make is to add red peppers and fresh garlic and basil.  The cornmeal is essential to a crisp crust.  I get the best results using a cast iron skillet.  Thanks for the recipe.

My children LOVED this pizza!  I am however wondering when to use the 2 tbsp of oil...as it's not stated in the directions. I am from a suburb of Chicago (born & raised) and frequent the city quite often (especially in my younger days) and I am TOTALLY going to have to disagree with MEMIAN, that Chicagoans have to eat tomatoes on their pizza....wrong, that's like saying that we ALL love the cold & snow.  There are plenty of pizzarias that serve pizza like this here in Chicago.  This is a great recipe, I again used my corning ware quiche pan, however I think it's about time for me to invest in a pizza pan.  The kids & I thank you Mark!

Too bad there is no stars! The dough is over raised and gummy and the filling isn't very creative and sort of gloppy. I've been making deep dish using Uno's and Lou Malnetti's recipe for years and the proper way to make deep dish is a richer crust, cheese tiled on top, Italian sausage,toppings, chunky seasoned crushed whole tomatoes and sprinkled with Parm.cheese. This is the pizza Chicago is known for(the top crust is an infatuation with some pizza places for variety).

The pizza I made using the filler from this recipe (though tweaked just a bit) turned out great!  I did use the "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" recipe for my pizza crust, and I used the "Easy Pizza Sauce III" recipe for my pizza sauce (though I tweaked the sauce a little by only using 2 teaspoons of oregano, adding 2 teaspoons of basil, and adding 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar).  I also used about 14 to 15 ounces of mozzarella cheese instead of the 9 ounces this recipe called for.  And I put a layer of ricotta cheese down on the pizza crust before adding the rest of the filler.  Finally, I only made a pepperoni pizza, instead of using all of the vegetables this recipe called for.  The combination of these three recipes, with the few minor tweaks I made, made for an EXCELLENT pizza!!!  Very, very tasty!!

Fantastic!  Instead of using the crust recipe included, I used Jay's Signature Pizza crust in my 10 inch springform pan (it makes serving a snap.)My only change was to garnish the top with another cup of cheese, a few green onions and peppers.

i am from chicago and this is a good recipe just about as good as geodarnos they have the best stuffed pizza. a good pan to use is a basic cake pan my deepdish pizza pan was way too big for this and i also used a differnt sauce i used the "easy pizza sauce" recipe by Frank Sweterlitsch found on this site it makes a little more then needed but you can save the rest for your next pizza. also in the stuffed pizza you can change the stuffing and take the meat out and make it vegi or justall meat or just all chease i have had it may ways from the restraunts. vegi is my favorte. (even though i dont like vegis that much) you can put the onins green pepres and other vegis. its basicly just a pizza so put what you want in it.

I was born and raised in chicago,and I will say this is a very good recipe.  Even in Chicago you will find no two restaurants that make the same stuffed pizza.  My husband and I can't agree, Carmen's or Lou Malnatis.  This recipe has worked great for me and every time I have made it I was told it was the Best pizza they had ever eaten.  This recipe was an excellent base, be creative.

I can't really rate this since I used a refrigerated pizza crust.  Maybe that was my mistake.  450 degrees for 45 min turned the crust to a burnt brick.  We salvaged the filling by scooping it out onto buns and had pizza burgers.  Not sure if I would attempt again after the failure I had and not knowing what time and temp to cook it.

I first tried this recipe when I moved overseas (from Chicago) It was awesome!! We made it for friends who also loved the pizza. We sometimes change the ingredients, but overall there is no need to, it's awesome!

We love Giordano's pizza so I was excited to try this recipe. I followed the suggestion to omit cornmeal, add extra oil and shorten kneading time as this definitely resonates with my memories of Giordano's.  The first try turned out well enough to warrant a second.  I recommend using bread flour to make the dough less sticky and adding extra sauce; however the tomato sauce in the recipe didn't appeal to me and my commercially-prepared sauce didn't mesh well with the rest of the pizza.

Finding this recipe is the best thing that has ever happend to me in the kitchen. First off the first couple time you try to make it, it is frustrating. Be patient. To make it easier I just buy Pilsbury thin crust pizza dough (it just unrolls)and use a spring form pan. one dough should be enough. Center the dough over the pan and get it set down in there. Cut the excess off and you should be able to roll it out enough to use for the top. I have contemplated buying a second crust for $1.72 and not having to get the rolling pin out. But you would have quite a bit of waste.   Ok for the ingredients. Follow this to your own peril but I do not brown the sausage first. It gets plenty cooked. Browned sausage then in the oven another half hour gets too tough, also I have substitued with breakfast sausage and can't really tell a difference. Couple other tweaks. I add fennel seed and do not use "pizza sauce" from the store. It is too runny. We use our favorite spaghetti suace from a jar. I also like to add some diced tomatos to the ingredients inside, Last tip, make sure the top is nice and brown before putting the sauce on or it will get soggy. Yes the sauce is only on for 5 min.   All the people I have made this for cannot believe what their mouths are telling them. Can homemade pizza really be this much better than any other pizza I have eaten.

This was wonderful!  I used the spring form pan as others had suggested and it worked out perfectly.  I also used a store bought pizza dough, which was quite the hassle in getting it to stick to the sides of the pan, but all in all, definitely wonderful.

I have never had an authentic Chicago sytle pizza, but since I first saw this recipe I was lusting over it.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a stone pie plate.  The crust was very crisp, even though I cnly baked it about 20-25 minutes.  The aroma was wonderful.  The filling was a little dry (maybe that is authentic, I don't know) so the second time I added chopped tomatoes.  My husband & I both love it!  Will make many times again.

I made this twice using a 9 x 13 pan. The first time, the bottom crust burned. The second time, I reduced the baking time to 35 minutes and dropped the heat a bit and it came out great. I substitute crushed tomatoes w/basil for the topping and put some in the filling as well. This does seem to take a long time to prep, though. Next time, I'm going to try this same idea with a different dough recipe.

AWESOME! We absolutely loved this pizza. I used my own dough and put it into a 8-1/2 inch springform pan. The filling was incredible! I also added fresh mushrooms that I cooked up with the onions, green peppers and garlic. When that was almost cooked I added in the cooked sausage and pepperoni. I let that cool added the cheeses and proceeded with the recipe. This will be a regular at our house! Thanks for sharing. :)

I can't join in on the "is it" or "isn't it" ture chicago style debate, b/c I've never been to Chicago, but I can say this wasn't worth the prep. time.  The directions aren't written the best, they are choppy and left me with further questions.  The top crust was soft and pillowy, but the sides and bottom were so tough and crisp that I could barely cut through to serve!  I'm giving this three stars b/c the "filling" was great and the presentation great as well!  I will try a stuffed pizza pie again, but with a different dough recipe.  BTW, I used a 10" springform pan and pressed the crust approx. half way up the sides.

I cheated, used store bought fresh pizza dough. Cut it half, ratio of about 60/40[60 on the bottom, 40 on the top] Used a spring form pan. Put slices of mozzerela on the bottom, then I put all of our favorites in it.Laid the top of the pizza crust on. Then used sauce and more cheese. Might not be true Chicago Style, but turned out great.

i love giordano's pizza, so i was excited to try the stuffed pizza at home.  i used a 9-in round cake pan, since others said they had success with that, but i was disappointed with the crust.  it was even thicker than chicago-style, and sort of hard to chew.  i'm not an expert at breads, so it may have been my fault, but i will try the stuffed pizza with another dough recipe next time.  i loved the filling- how can you go wrong with cheese, sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and onions?

This was an excellent recipe.  We are sauce lovers, so I added some store bought pizza sauce.  I also used an extra large pie plate, but there was too much dough.  A pizza pan will be added to my Christmas list!

The recipe didn't say what size pan to use.  I used a 10x12.  After 30 minutes the bottom crust had burned.  The top part tasted good.

This was my first time making Chicago style pizza. I used the Jays crust recipe and then followed this one. I saved the sauce for the last 10 minutes. The whole family enjoyed it. Made it in a 7” spring form pan. It’s a keeper!! I did use my own sauce recipe instead of just tomato sauce.

The crust is the key to knocking this recipe out of the park.  But, if you've never worked with dough before, read on... Here are Tips for working with/making your own bread/pizza dough:  1) if the water you add to the yeast is even 1 degree too hot, the sugar/yeast/water mixture will not foam and your dough ultimately will not rise. If you proceed not realizing that the mixture isn't foamy enough, you may try to use this dough and the results will be unflavorful, tough dough...like the way a piece of white bread looks after you've rolled it into a ball.   The temp of the water really matters b/c it can kill the activity of the yeast.  If you don't have a thermometer, your Safe bet is to use lukewarm water.  Better than too hot. Once the yeast mixture is foamy, mix in the dry ingredients and put the dough ball into a bowl greased with olive oil.  Cover with a damp kitchen towel in a warmer part of the kitchen...dough should expand twice it's size. 2) for the chic pizza dough...use the cornmeal.  Makes it authentic Chic style and personally, I prefer the taste. 3) bread flour, sifted, is always better than all purpose flour for bread making.  I only use all purpose flour if I'm desperate.   4) for the pan...springform is a good and easy way to get deep dish effect and super easy to remove (obviously)...but if you don't have one, use iron skillet if you can.  This is a good recipe.  With fresh ingredients and some HOT Italian sausage, it's a showstopper!

I am a big Chicago deep dish lover, even to the point of having it shipped to my home overnight, so I was delighted to find this recipe!  I made some of the changes suggested in other reviews, such as adding diced tomatoes to the sausage mix and using a springform pan.  I didn't top the dough with the sauce until it ad baked 15 minutes.  You need to put it on before the "5-10 time left" suggested by some reviewers because you'll burn the crust.  Right before I took it out of the oven I put grated parm on top.  As for omitting the cornmeal, I would not suggest it, because it is a staple ingredient in traditional Chicago deep dish!  Chicago greats and originals use it in their dough!

Like a lot of other reviewers, I think this recipe is a good start.  However, I haven't found too many restaurants in Chicago or the 'burbs that serve a pizza like this.  The crust on top is more of an east coast thing, and there is nowhere near enough cheese in this recipe.  If it wasn't for calling it "chicago style" I would give it more stars because it tastes good...but it's not really a chicago style stuffed pizza.

I really liked this one. Although I have never had an actual Chicago pizza so I don't know how this compares. But for a great dinner that the whole family will eat, it's great! I used a different crust recipe (Bread machine pizza crust) which was outstanding by the way....and followed the recipe for the rest of this pizza. I used the idea of the springform pan (thanks...it worked great!!!!).

We just had Giordano's a week ago during a trip to Chicago, and tried to duplicate it.  We came up with our own filling, but basically just used the dough recipe. 

I needed to add more flour to the dough, because it seemed too sticky, but other than that, had no trouble with the dough and it baked up fine. 

I used a stoneware deep dish pan and had plenty of dough.  Using a heavy pan like that I think also makes it less likely to burn.

For a quick and easy version of this, I used 2 packages of "just add water" pizza crusts and a spring form pan.  I followed the filling or stuffing recipe as listed.  press one crust to the bottom and a little up the sides of the lightly greased spring form pan and toss in the 450 oven's middle rack for 4 minutes.  Roll out the second crust so that it will be large enough to blanket the stuffing and reach the edges of the pan and apply it to the top of the 1st crust over the filling.  I dipped the handle end of a wooden spoon in flour and used it to firmly press the top crust down to meet the bottom crust all around the edges.  Cut 3, 2 inch slits in the top for ventilation.  Bake on the near top rack of the oven for 15 mins. or until top crust is very slightly browned in spots.  Open a an 8oz. can of pizza sauce and add 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar.  Pull pizza from the oven reinforce the 3 ventilation slits and put 1/2 the sauce on top.  Place pizza back in oven on middle rack for 5-7 minutes. Pull the pizza out and apply the remaining sauce to the top and sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese.  Cool for a few minutes and devour.  I don't know if I'd call this Chicago style, but I live here and if I want delicious pizza I don't cook, I go to Pequod's.

For me this recipe was a total disaster. The crust was soggy underneath, (Even though I baked it first for 4 minutes.) and burnt and black on top. The pizza was very oily, and I had to constantly interupt the baking in order to pour the grease out of the sides as if it were meat loaf. I didn't cut the garlic fine enough so there were several 'hot' spots in the pizza. At the end I had to toss the whole thing out. But I love Chicago Style Pizza, so I refuse to give up. I'll definitely try this recipe again, and I'll post if I get better results. EDIT: I just wanted to add, that I do not blame the recipe for my hishap at all. I'm a beginner cook and still learning. I will definitely try this recipe again, hopefully with better results.

I used Jay's Signature Crust also per reviews. I used 8x8 pan, too small. Next time 13x9.  My 8x8 was packed with all these ingredients. Very yummy! I'll have to adjust the amounts to fit a 13x9.  I love pizza.

Pizza was very very delicous. But I have a tip because I like my veggies throughly cooked. I sauteed the veggies a little bit first before baking the pizza. But otherwise, it was verrrrrrrrry good!!!

This was pretty good! I'll make it again with some adjustments. Not enough sauce for me. Next time I'll use pizza sauce, not tomato sauce. I added sauce for last 5 mins. and that was enough. Also, my crust got a bit darker than I'd like, and I took 5 min. off baking time. I didn't brown the sausage and it was fully cooked when the pizza was done. The crust was easy and I was satisfied with how it turned out. A modest success this time, will likely be really good next time.

This recipe is very poorly written.  The directions in paragraph one seem to indicate that you should mix both bowls together then, but then it shifts course in the second paragraph.  It never tells you what to do with the olive oil, and when I cooked it for the suggested time, the bottom was burned, the stuffing was lukewarm.  DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE!

It was awesome and tasted just like the restaurants I visit in Chicago. However, it only needs about 25-30 minutes cooking time so the crust isn't too hard but is still cooked through.
