This recipe is great. I even substituted some of the ingredients and it still worked! For example i used whole wheat flour, all-bran flakes,I grated the apples and i added a few chocolate covered cranberries!
I will definately make this one again.

The flavor of this recipe is good.  The problem is that you can not get the muffins out of the paper muffin cups once they have cooled.  I have made this recipe twice, once with the paper cups and once in the greased tins.  Same problem.

I omitted the oil, flax seeds and currants; and added a diced bosc pear.  I thought these were good, but a little spongy.  They didn't stand out, but for a healthy snack, they didn't get turned down, either.
