Perhaps the reason some reviewers are finding this recipe to be a bit too salty , is because while the ingredients list says garlic salt, the directions say garlic powder. My guess is that it's supposed to be garlic powder. Better still, mince up a clove of the real thing ! I give it 3 stars, only because of this confusion.

This recipe was great. Very simple and quick.  To save time, I used canned diced tomatoes, pre-seasoned with basil and garlic I didn't have any garlic salt on hand, so I used a Italian seasoning.
I made some substitutions and this dish still came out great!!

This is my favorite appetizer.  You can change the cheese or add other spices.  This is a classic!  Thank you.

This is a good recipe. I changed it up though, I used sourdough baguette instead.  I felt that the amount of olive oil is excessive, and the garlic salt makes it too salty.  Overall, good recipe, will use again with minor modifications. =)

This was a great recipe.  My son and I enjoyed it very much.  We even shared with my neighbors and the husband LOVED it.  The only thing that I would change is the amount of olive oil.  I had plenty left over which seemed a waste to me because we all know that olive oil certainly is not the least expensive of the oils.  Haha.In the future, I will use a little more than 1/4 cup.

This turned out great! I needed a recipe to use up the TONS of tomatoes in my garden this year and this fit the bill. After reading the reviews, I changed a couple of things. I cut the garlic salt out completely and instead used a garlic infused olive oil. To the oil I added minced garlic, red pepper flakes and italian seasoning and let that sit for about four hours to meld. Brushed fresh sourdough bread with the oil, topped with diced tomatoes and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and parmesan. We're going to try this on the grill tomorrow night with more tomatoes and more mozzarella. YUMMY!!

I don't know if I didn't get the garlic salt mixed enough or what, but it was quite salty. I don't think I would add all the garlic salt next time. And I too thought some fresh basil on top of it all would taste nice too. I may dice up the tomatoes too--because it's hard to keep the tomato on when I bite into it. All in all it's a nice idea with some minor changes needed. I will definantly try again.

My family LOVED this.  I have a 6 year old and a 12 year old and they had seconds!  I changed it jsut a tad, I used hoagie rolls because I bought a big bag and knew that I would not use them all otherwise, I added basil (I think that's what is pictured too) and after it was done I threw on a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar.  DELISH!

My guests loved this and even called a week later for the recipe.  I didnt have any fresh tomatoes, so I used canned, seasoned with garlic and olive oil.  I used asiago cheese bread and basil from the garden - whole leaves atop bread then topped with tomato mixture.  Lazy and delicious indeed!  Will definitely make again!

Exactly what I'm looking for.  Changed the cheese to Asiago, used a french loaf and sun dried tomatoes with oregano and roasted garlic!  Happy New Year!

I saw a lot of comments about them being just a little too salty, so what i did was take away the garlic powder and use fresh garlic. Making sure It didn't lack flavor, without the salt, I added some perfect pinch Italian seasoning to it! It is a life saver!!! To give it an extra health boost, you can put spinach over the tomatoes! I love this and will use it again!

Way too salty.  Whoa!  I would either significantly reduce the amount of garlic salt or use garlic powder instead (it must have been a typo in the ingredients as the dirctions call for garlic powder and not garlic salt.).  Also, next time I would reduce the amount of olive oil.  All that being said I would definitely try again as a quick, easy and tasty side.

This was okay, but I thought it called for way too much olive oil.  And the garlic salt was overpowering...both too salty and too much of a garlic taste.  I made it again decreasing the amount of garlic, using garlic powder instead of salt.  I decreased the olive oil and added some dried basil to the oil/garlic mixture.  It was MUCH better this way.  With my tweaks, I will make this again.

Wow - is this a great recipe.  Bruschetta is one of our favorites and this recipe is quick and easy  to make.  I had leftover garlic Italian bread that worked nicely for this.  I had some green onions to use up also and they were a nice addition to this recipe.  I've made this on three different occasiions already.  Great recipe - thanks KCANDDAVID for sharing!

These were quick, easy and Delicious! I did put crushed red peppers and basil on some, and less oil as other reviews have stated. Another reason I love these is because you can customize them and they are So pretty!

these were great and fast!  I took some sliced french bread and topped it with a well drained can of Italian diced tomatoes.  Then dusted gently with garlic powder.  Topped with mozzarella cheese and dusted with dried basil.   Broiled for about 3-5 minutes until cheese melted and bread browned a bit.  Everyone loved them!

This recipe makes a good basic bruschetta, but needs some extra seasonings to add a little more pizzaz and definitely needs a little tweaking.  A half cup of olive oil is not necessary.  I just brushed both sides of my slices, using only about a tablespoon, then sprinkled them lightly with garlic salt.  I chopped my tomatoes and added a little more garlic salt, then mixed in a shredded provolone/mozzarella cheese blend, just eyeballing the amount, and drizzled in a little olive oil.  I toasted both sides of my bread just briefly, then topped them with the tomato mixture and popped them under the broiler.  I wish I had added some dried oregano or Italian seasoning, but will try that next time.  This recipe is a good place to start, so I will make it again and jazz it up a little more.

Good, but I missed my basil :(  Even a leaf just laid under the cheese would have been lazy enough but would have taken this to another level.  Still 4 stars for its taste and ease ;)

I like the idea of slicing the tomatoes instead of dicing them like most recipes call for. It made the process go a lot faster. I had some leftover roasted garlic from another recipe so I mashed that up and let it sit in the olive oil for a few hours with only 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. Instead of brushing the bread with the oil, I tossed the sliced tomatoes in the flavored oil and then laid the sliced tomatoes on the bread. I didn't let the oil go to waste; I drizzled the bread and tomoatoes with it. Then I topped it with Parmesan cheese and broiled it for 3 minutes. Absolutely delicious.

Very simple to make and tasty...Had this with shrimp pasta and ceasar salad... very Yummy!!! Would easily make this for company...Even my picky husband thought it was good.  Way too much olive oil mixture...I could have made 100 pieces if I wanted to...No need to use 1 cup of olive oil!!!!

I made this because I suddenly had a mad craving for bruschetta and it was the fastest to make with the least ingredients. Overall, it was quite good. I used mozzarella + parmesan and then sourdough bread.

Too much oil and I even double the bread to eight slices. Its missing flavor and color. Needs something like sweet basil or garlic cloves. I'll just stick with my own recipe.

I have not made this yet but plan to do so. I too think a tablespoon of garlic salt is an incredible amount for 1 tomato. If it is supposed to be garlic powder, that would be an overwhelming amount also. Maybe they really mean a teaspoon which is 1/3 of a tablespoon of course.

My husband and I thought this was great!  I was looking for a simple use for fresh garden tomatoes, and I appreciated slicing rather than "dicing."  I used a different garlic, and I also placed a leaf of fresh basil on each slice of bread, under the tomato and cheese.  I really like the garlic infused olive oil coating the pre-toasted bread!  Yum!  Because I used an entire baguette, I prepared ten slices, and the oil was plenty - I can see how it would be a bit much for just four slices.

My family & I loved these! I think the Garlic Salt is a typo though because I have made these before & it said powder, which is what I use every time & they turn out wonderful! I originally chose this recipe because of it's mention of non tomato lovers liking it still. Whereas my family loves tomatoes, I hate them, but I still loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing this because I would have never thought it possible for me to like something that called for sliced tomatoes on it like this does & boy was I wrong!

Way to salty if you follow the ingredients as listed.  Would've liked with just the olive oil, tomato and cheese.  Had to take the tomatoes and cheese off the bread and place on plain bread to eat.

Mostly ok but lacks the finishing touches.  I use fresh in season or canned diced tomatoes in winter - mix olive oil, basil, oregeno, minced garlic and brush on bread ( I use long french bread cut to 1" rounds) add diced tomatoes (draining excess juice)and top with cheese - whatever I have opened - cheddar - mozzarella - marble cheese or a combination of all.  Under the preheated broiler for a few minutes until you can see the bread toasting.  Enjoy - sometimes make just this for lunch for hubby and me - Yum

The picture of this recipe shows green leafy components. I'm guessing that's basil but it's nowhere in the recipe. That's a BIG ommission.

Simple to prepare. Used a French baquette instead of Italian. Added some fresh ground pepper. Topped with a little bit of fresh basil on each bruschetta.

This was sooo good. Thanks for the recipe. I made this as an appetizer on a Valentine's Day meal and it hit the spot. Very easy to make. Will make again.
