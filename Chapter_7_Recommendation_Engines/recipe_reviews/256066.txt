Really complex and delightful flavor.  I didn’t have sweet potatoes or harissa so substituted regular potatoes with Sriracha and a little salt.  Even that was great! Can’t wait to make it the right way!!

I was a little hesitant to make this, with no previous reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was.  I'm a pretty discriminating cook!  Made this with Israeli couscous instead of quinoa, as I thought the texture would be a nice compliment.  Liked the combination of flavors; clean, bright taste of the cilantro, creamy saltiness of the feta, spicy sweetness of the sweet potatoes. Yum!
