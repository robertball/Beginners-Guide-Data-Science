This is delish!. I couldn't just have a sprinkle of graham cracker crumbs on the bottom of this so I made my own crust by using 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1/3 cup white sugar and mix with 1/3 cup melted butter.  I added more key lime juice for more tartness (1/3 cup total, I actually could of used more for more flavor).  I also made my own key lime drizzle, delicious.  I usually make a recipe as is first to see how it turns out, but I just couldn't make it without a crust. I baked for an hour and it turned out perfect.

Loved the cheesecake mixture. I used 1/2 c of bottled key lime juice, adding it to the cheesecake mixture after the eggs instead of the mixing it in with the chocolate. I used a ginger cookie(1 1/2 c) crust as suggested with 1/2c pecans and  1/2c coconut added.  Also served with a raspberry coulis sauce(10 -12oz frozen or fresh raspberries, 1/4c sugar cooked 5-8 minutes, strained to remove seeds. Returned to pan and thickened with 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch in 1 Tbs. of orange juice. Thanks for sharing!
