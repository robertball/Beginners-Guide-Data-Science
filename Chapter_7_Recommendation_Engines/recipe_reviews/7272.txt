Why is everyone giving this recipe a five-star rating after they have altered the recipe? 
IF you make this as directed:
a)There is WAY too much oil, b)it has very little flavor, c)it takes a lot longer than 40-45  minutes to bake, d)the icing does not need that much sugar and butter.  
It sticks in your throat going down; and left my kids fingers slicker than the exxon oil spill.
I think if this recipe was dramatically altered it would be OK. It would be easier to find another recipe...

I made this twice, the first time I followed the recipe to a T, but I found it kinda of oily, and the texture a little off, so the second time I made it I substituted the 1 1/2 cups of oil for 1 cup of non-sweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. The texture was perfect and it was easier to cut too. Also I used some spenda with the sugar to cut some calories and used lowfat cream cheese for the icing. The second time around I'd give it 5 stars!

MMMMM  MMMM Good!!!!  One of the best carrot cakes I've ever had.  The only changes I made were:  reduce oil to use 1/2 cup, 2tsp cinnamon, pinch of Allspice...  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cup white flour....  I also took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the frosting:  1 cup confectioners sugar, 4 oz cream cheese, 1/8 cup butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 cup chopped pecans.  I love cream cheese frosting but some recipes have too much for my taste....   Moist & Delicious!!!  I love this cake!!!!!!!!!

This cake was too moist, almost as if it was soaking wet.  I think the pineapple ruined it, made it taste funky.  Also, there is just WAY TOO MUCH oil.  Carrot Cake III on this site is much better and it doesn't need to be TWEAKED like this recipe to recieve a 5 by so many people...Won't make again. Z-

I decided on this cake for my friend's birthday.  I baked it on a Friday for a Saterday party.

I took the advice of people on the forum and made some changes.  I used 1 cup sugar (rather than the 2 suggested) for the cake, as well as 2 tsp of cinnamon rather than the 1 suggested as I like a spicier cake.  I used 1/3 cup vegetable oil and 2/3 cup applesauce.  I didn't add any pecans.

The cake turned out quite moist still, even with the reduced oil.  I had a hard time getting it out of the pan, as parts of it stuck.  After a bit of prodding it was out, but I was a bit worried as it seemed too moist.  (I had baked most of the batter in a rectangular pan, and baked 1 small cupcake for tasting purposes.) But alas my fears were unfounded... Read below.  

I used the Neufchatel frosting suggested, but made one change- used 1 cup of sugar rather than 3 1/2 cups.  Also- didn't mix the pecans in, but rather decorated the top of the cake with it.  

After leaving it in the fridge for 1 day, I was pleasantly surprised when it tasted much better than the day before.  The gumminess that resulted from it being too moist the day before, was now a perfect level of moistness, and the frosting tasted delicious with the cake.  You could actually see bits of carrot, and with the toasted pecans on top, it was visually gorgeous.  Everyone loved it!

I'd make this recipe again and again, but still use the modifications I've made above.  I suggest baking the day before, and refigerating.

Oh my.  This was great!  My hubby advised me late last night he had to take something for a potluck today (dont you hate that) and since I've been eyeballing this recipe, my son and I went to the store and whipped it up!  We saved enough batter to make 3 cupcakes so we could all taste it.  It was SO fast to make with the food processer, and it was devine!  I followed previous reviews and used 3/4 cup oil, used 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce, upped the cinnamon to 3 tsp (we love spice) and added raisins.  I decreased the sugar in the frosting to 2 3/4 cups.  I put nuts IN the frosting and sprinkled a few more ON the cake (we're nut lovers too).  The frosting was fantastic, after the cake was frosted, I had dibs on the bowl, beaters, knife, you name it, they were MINE!  ;-)  Great recipe, the pineapple was different, but DARN GOOD!

Very good recipe w/ some of the modifications mentioned by others:
increase carrots to 4 c., reduce oil to 3/4 c., add 1/4 c. cinnamon apple sauce, increase cinnamon to 2 tsp., drain some of the juice off pineapple, add 1/4 c. raisins, AND most importantly reduce the powdered sugar in the icing.  I used 2 c. and my sister still thought it was borderline too sweet.
I also recommend waiting to add the carrots until the same time you add the pecans.

Just because it has a few carrots in it doesn't make it health food! I reduced the oil to under 1 cup and put less sugar in the frosting to reduce the calories with good results.

The reason so many are having cakes that are oily is that  #1 you mast gradually add the sugar,beating until fluffy before adding more sugar. Continue adding small amounts at a time. # 2 Beat your eggs seperately till very light & gradually add to the sugar, oil mixture. You are not incorperating the sugar & oil & the oil separates & will be on the bottom etc. Try this, you will never have an oily carrot cake again.

MOIST!!! Is definately one word for this cake! I made this yesterday for my husband and son's birthday.  My husband said it was almost custard-like it was so moist, but still delicious. I did make some modifications though.  1 1/2 cups oil seemed like WAY too much (maybe a typo?) so I used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  I also cut out 1/2 cup of sugar so that it wasn't overly sweet. I also used one heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger to up the spices a bit to give it more flavor.  Next time I think I'll cut the applesauce down to 1/2 a cup since I think a whole cup was too much. I also didn't make the frosting in the recipe, but just took 2 8oz pkgs cream cheese with about 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbs orange juice concentrate and 1 tsp almond extract.  It was great!  This is a good recipe to start out with and then make your own modifications as you go.  Thanks! I will be making this again!

Far and away the best carrot cake I've ever made. Found this recipe some time ago and have been making it often ever since. My father, who is a picky eater, (and his coworkers!) request this REGULARLY.
My only addition after many cakes is ground ginger, 1/2 the amt. of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of allspice. Adds a great extra zing, especially around the holidays when everyone loves to see something different from the usual pumpkin and pecan pies. However, great every time of year, especially cold out of the fridge on a warm spring afternoon!

I made this cake for my hubby's birthday.It's fruity, dense and really, REALLY moist. Hubby loved it.  I followed the suggestions of a lot of people here and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added 2/3 cup unsweatened apple sauce instead.  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups from 2 cups, omitted the pecans and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  Normally cakes last over a week in my house and left-overs end up getting tossed....this one lasted 4 days and even the sticky crumbs were scraped off the plate.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the recipe did require a lot of modifications, but it was a good cake.  A keeper.

A+++ recipe! I have made this carrot cake countless times and it's a big hit. I gave the recipe to my sister-in-law and she has also made great use of it. I read the reviews and took some of the recommendation like adding less oil, use more cinnamon etc. The other change I made is the instead of using 3 cups of grated carrots I use 3 cups of left over pulp from making carrot juice. My husband likes it better that way and so do I. We get fresh heathly carrot juice and an Awesome Carrot Cake.

Turned out Wonderful!I made this cake for a play date with some kids, so I had put them into little mini muffins and also a small square cake pan.In fact, most of the mothers ended up eating it, but the kids loved it too. And since it was kids, I didnt add pineapple or the pecans. I did follow others' advice and substituted the sugar for 1c of white and 1c of brown sugar. Also used 3/4c of oil and 1/4c of applesauce, instead of all of the oil. I used 3 tsp. of cinnamon (love cinnamon!) I used a 2 lb. bag of baby carrots and only needed half a bag. So I used 4 cups of carrots. For the frosting I used 1 8oz. cream cheese, 1/4c butter melted,2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla, and 2 Tbsp. of orange juice (try it, you'll Love it!) It comes out just Wonderful, not too thick and not too tart, JUST DELICIOUS!

Excellent!! Very moist and not too heavy. I followed the suggestion to only use 1/2 cup of oil, added a cup of raisins and cut back the sugar in the frosting to 2 cups. It's a nice adaptable recipe and very easy.

----------***UDATE 10/18/2006***I've made this cake I dont know how many times!!!! The last couple of times I used the wheat flour and Splenda for a healthier alternative.  Its still AWESOME, Tracy!!!!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!---------
(1/25/2004) I've made this cake several times.  Each and every time it has been a hit.  I, too, cut back on the oil by half, doubled the cinnamon, and in making the recipe my own, I used Splenda instead of regular sugar to cut back the calories and the sugar intake.  It was truly "Awesome".  Tracy, thanks for sharing this great recipe!

****Saw a review Posted by CYBERIC99 on 2/17/2003 who used wheat flour.  I'm going to try that next time.****

Too much oil, too heavy, little flavor.  I agree with another reviewer that if you're going to CHANGE the recipe, don't review the original one as great.  I put it in the garbage.

I made this cake this weekend and AWESOME is right.  I went through the other reviews and went by their suggestions.  For example, I only used 1 1/3 cup oil, 1 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown, I added 1 teaspoon more cinnamon and I also added a cup of raisins.  I bake mine in two 9 inch cake pans and baked for about 32 min.  For the icing, I used a whole stick of butter, only 3 cups of sugar and instead of vanilla I used 2 TBL orange juice and 1 TBL orange zest.  This was only my second "from scratch" cake and my first attempt for a carrot cake.  This cake is definately a keeper. Thanks Tracy!  Oh, I also wanted to suggest to others that you really should grate the carrots yourself instead of using a food processor, that probably makes the difference on how your cake turns out.

Cream oil, eggs and sugar with an electric mixer in dry bowl for approx 5 minutes.  Then add other ingredients.  This makes a nice cake that is not greasy as other reviews have notated.

Outstanding cake! Just as I remembered. I did make a couple changes after reading the reviews. I only used 3/4 cup oil and I added 2 jars of baby food carrots. I also added coconut. This is without a doubt a great recipe.

I would give it 5 stars but it was just a bit too oily/moist for my tastes. Will try again later with others suggestions.

I love carrot cake.  I get everywhere I can.  This is the BEST I have ever had!!!  I followed some of the other suggestions:  3/4 cup oil was perfect.  I was going to add 1/2 cup of apple sauce, but I forgot...and it turned out great. Moist!!!  2tsps each of Allspice, Nutmeg and Cinnamon made it great!!!  I only used 3 cups of teh powdered sugar, but could have only used 2.  It was really sweet!!  but oh so delicious!! 
I would highly suggest you print this one out to keep!!

I have made this cake twice now and it is absolutely Fantastic!   I notice there were a couple complaints that it was too oil but it isn't if you mix it correctly.  The first time I started hand mixing it and the oil would just not mix in and it looked like it would never combine no matter how hard I tried.  I then used the electric mixer on a medium speed and wait a few minutes and it was perfect.   The flavor on this cake is amazing and well worth making again and again!

This gets an A+! I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday party, and everyone who tried it loved it (and asked for a second piece!) The amazing part is, I had never baked a cake before in my entire life (i'm a 25-year-old college student) and yet i was able to make something "from scratch" that tasted so delicious! Note: I followed previous reviewer's suggestions: i only used 3/4 cup oil, less sugar (1 1/3 cup) and made half as much frosting (4 oz cheese, 1/8 c butter, and 1 cup powdered sugar). Also doubled the cinnamon (to 2 tsp) and added 1/2 tsp of cloves and nutmeg. Came out perfect! And if *I* can do it, *anyone* can!

Really good! I followed some advice from the reviews and used 1 cup of applesauce as well as 1/2 cup of oil instead of all oil. I didn't add any pineapple and think if I would have added it  the cake would have been WAY too moist! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 and made 1/2 the frosting. My measurments for the frosting were 1/2 package of cream cheese, 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/8 cup of butter. I don't like icing too sweet!

This recipe calls for far too much oil and has very little flavor. We had to make the following modifications in order for the cake to come out allright: reduce oil to 1/2 cup, add 1/2 cup applesauce, and increase cinnamon to 2 tsp.  We also used 12 ounces of cheese instead of 8. With these changes, I'd give this recipe 4 stars.

I did as the recipe called for and added 1 1/2 cups of vegetable oil (which seemed like a lot, but i have never had any trouble with recipes on here before and everyone rated it well. It was in the oven for 45 minutes and still wasn't done because it was so oily. the rest of it seemed fine and the take was ok if you ignored the oil. I call a rematch!

This is a super cake! But you only need 1/2 cup of oil and its still a VERY moist cake. I also add a cup of raisins and use 1 cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar instead of all white sugar. My mother is very picky and she insists its the perfect carrot cake.

My third time trying this recipe and I finally figured out how to get it right.  Use 3/4 cup of oil..that's it.  Trust me I've tried with apple sauce as substitue for some of the 1 1/2 cups of oil but it was too much liquid.  3/4 cup oil is all you need.  The cake came out perfectly moist and not too greasy.  Family loved it over Christmas.

This recipe was completely awful!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  It turned out like a rubber ball sitting in oil.  It was disgusting!  I would NEVER even think about trying this recipe again.  If I could rate it "no stars" I would.  My recommendation: don't waste your time on this one.

Yes, this is best recipe yet. My granny made this every holiday. I have not made this since she passed away. But I think it's time. Kids that don't like pineapple or carrots or cream cheese will love this cake. They have no idea what's in it. You do not need to change this recipe, it is excellent as is.

5 star recipe as written.  10 star recipe with one tiny little addition.... 1/2 tsp of orange flavoring (or 1 tsp grated orange peel) in the frosting.  This is a bakery tip, don't try using orange juice, you won't taste that; use the orange essential oil found in the peel or Lor Ann orange flavoring.  Awesome recipe!

I, too, adjusted the oil with the applesauce.  I didn't care too much for the pineapple and the frosting was a bit too sweet for me.  I made the cake again, this time without the pineapple, and it was very good.  Although my husband loved the cake with the pineapple, we both agreed that this was a good recipe.

WOW! Made some changes- 3/4 c oil, extra cinmn, added nutmeg, pecans & walnuts, 1c/white, 1c brown sugar. Baked over night, put in 'frige, frosted next morning. VERY moist & dense. Everyone loved it at work, me too. Thanks for sharing a great recipe! OH, and grate the carrots, not your fingers! OUCH!! :)

It truly is awesome. In case you're wondering, 3 cups grated carrots is 6 or 7 large ones. (I was wondering how many to buy.) I took other reviewers' advice and only used 1 cup of oil, and it was still plenty moist. I sprinkled flaked coconut on top of the cream cheese frosting, and it looked and tasted great.

Oh, this is a great recipe. Made a cake for some friends today and they ate up every crumb. And of course, many asked for the recipe. They even said this was the best cake i ever made. 
However, I had to make some changes to the recipe (after reading some of the reviews)
This was what i changed after summarizing some of the reviews (and the cake came out great: moist, not too sweet and full of flavor):
almost 4 cups carrots, 1 1/6 cup sugar, 2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 3/4 cup oil and I drained some of the juice from the pineapples. 
For the frosting: (I halved the recipe) 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, 3/4 package cream cheese, 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 cup chopped walnut. 
Ok, have fun baking this great cake. It is really awesome!

I agree with some of the others who didn't like this cake either.  The taste was okay, but the texture was very rubbery and the icing was pasty.  It really wasn't much like a cake at all.  I, too, don't understand why this recipe is rated so high.  I even made it with the modifications from the reviews and it still didn't work.  Needs much less oil, or more flour, and the icing needs less cream cheese and butter to make it more fluffy.

This carrot cake is very good but I changed it a bit. I cut down on the oil to 1 cup and the powered sugar to 1 and 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. Next time I make this I will cut the powdered sugar down a bit more, but overall a good recipe!

I'm not usually a big fan of sweets, but I have a weakness for carrot cake.  My old boss used to make a super moist carrot cake that used pineapples and I've been looking for a recipe that used it ever since.  I followed the video recipe version since it used 1/2 the amount of oil than the written recipe.  But also made a few small changes.. I increased the amount of carrots to 4 cups, added around 3/4 cup of raisins and decreased the sugar to just a little over 1 cup so it's not too sweet. I baked it for 40min and it turned out amazing! Super moist, not overly sweet, and definitely not greasy at all.  Next time, I'm going to check it at the 30-35min mark and see if it's even more moist.

I have never been much of a carrot cake fan, but I made THIS recipe twice now in one week. It is the best carrot cake I have ever eaten!

Everyone loved this cake. It was a little greasy though...next time, I'll cut back in the amount of oil.

This cake definately lives up to it's name!!!!  I was a little hesitant about how much oil to use, since i read a lot of reviews about it being greasy.  I had no problem with it being greasy, however I did cream the oil, eggs, and sugar so I don't know if it made a difference.  Other than that I followed it to a T.  Everyone loooooved it!!!!!!!!  Yummy, you wonn't be dissapointed if you make this one.

It's my sisters Birthday. I have NO gift for her. Came across this recipe. Never made Carrot Cake w/Cream Cheese frosting in my life! Just happen to have all the ingredents so I got to work really fast. Presented my gift of "Awesome Carrot Cake w/Cream Cheese Frosting" to my sister. It was the only birthday cake and come to my surprise Carrot Cake w/ Cream Cheese Frosting was her all time favorite.
Thanks so much for the recipe! I received great reviews from all and felt so much better that I had a Gift to Give!And PS: Followed Recipe as stated.

I tried this carrot cake recipe 3 years ago and my family loved it so much that it is requested every family gathering.  I did cut the oil to 1 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cup. Those are the only changes.  The reviews I get from family and friends are AWESOME!

This turned out great!!  I heeded the other reviews and substituted the full amount of oil for 1c. applesauce (unsweetened) and 1/2 c. oil.  I baked the batter in two 9" rounds (at 350 for 30 minutes) and they turned out beautifully!!  I made the frosting with a little more powdered sugar (about 1 c. more) and a splash of milk... I wanted to make sure I had enough frosting for my layered cake.  I sprinkled the remaining pecans on top of the frosted cake and the overall presentation was wonderful.  Everyone loved the cake and I will definately be making this again!!

I give it 5 stars with the changes people mentioned:  reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced oil to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 cup apple sauce, and it was wonderful!  Baked in two 9 inch pans.

This is a great cake, although I do add 1/2 tsp of allspice and nutmeg, but that is just a small change. This is the second time I am making it and made two so I could freeze one. Thanks

I made this and it turned out moist and delicious.  I made a few changes, to make it healthier and though I was worried that it would taste "healthy," it tasted divine.  I used one cup cake flour and one cup wole wheat flour.  Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used one cup of Xylitol.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups oil, I used just 1/2 cup.  I added 1/4 t Allspice and 1/2 t nutmeg.  I toasted the pecans before adding them in and I added 1 cup golden raisins.  I then cooked it in 2 9" round pans and made it as a layer cake.    For the frosting, I used 2 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, 16 oz. Neufchatel, 10 T butter, and 1 1/2 t vanilla extract.  I toasted the pecans and rather than add them into the frosting mix, I pressed them into the sides of the cake to make a nice presentation.

This recipe really does need to be "tweaked".  I made it with 3/4 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, no nuts and drained most of the juice off the pineapple.  It also needed closer to 50 minutes to bake. I can't imagine it being good the way it is written.  I frosted it with "Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site (the BEST frosting...really!).  It was a hit at my daughter's 4th birthday party with both the kids and parents!

This was really delicious! I only gave 4 stars, however, because some modifications are needed...the first time I made this cake it wasn't nearly as good - it was too greasy and bland! This time, I made the following modifications: (1) I cut the oil in half and added an extra 1/2 cup of pineapple & juice and about 1/2 or 3/4 c. of extra carrot to increase moisture, (2) I cut out 1/2 c. of sugar, (3) I added raisins, (4) I added a 1/2 tsp. extra cinnamon & 1/2 tsp allspice (I like a spicier carrot cake). Also, I should mention, I ran out of vegetable oil, so I used only 1/4 c. of veg. oil with a 1/2 cup of olive oil and it worked beautifully. With all of these modifications, plus an extra 8 or so minutes of cooking (almost 50 min. in total), the cake was delicious. I find the icing too rich and sweet for my taste, but others liked it.

The word AWESOME in the title does not do this recipe justice.  I needed a recipe recently that included pineapple and thought I would try this.  It is a FABULOUS recipe.  I will be using it for a wedding cake in two weeks and I know that the quests will be very pleased.  Only hint I have for everyone is:  when you are baking larger cakes (ie:  14, 18, 20, etc) is to decrease the baking temperature by 25 (to 325) and bake it longer.  The recipe multiplies very well!  Thanks for sharing this TREMENDOUS recipe!

Great recipe Tracy!  My family thanks you.  I added 1/2 cup raisins, an extra teaspoon of cinnamin, and reduced the oil to 3/4 c.  It came out absolutely perfect...delicious and moist.  Used cream cheese for the frosting and decorated with pacan halves.  I will definately make this one over and over again!!

This recipe is rated high by everyone so I keep wondering what I did wrong. I followed the recipe but the cake took forever to bake and then tasted very bland...other than the cream cheese frosting.. when it was done. I have been cooking for years so it's not a lack of cooking skills at fault. Sorry!:-(

This recipe was good & very moist.  I've never had it with pineapple in it so it was a bit of a change.  The frosting was a bit runny for my liking, but it was good.  Thanks Tracy!

This one is fool proof! I happily assembled the ingredients and just as I was going to 'pour' it into the pans....the word 'spooned' from the recipe came to me. I realized that the tin of pinapple I had used was 14 oz not 8, so in a mad panic I threw in another cup or so of flour, and more baking soda and baking powder, mixed and then panned and baked. The cake looks great! I will definitely do this one again, but I'll cut the pinapple & juice in half.

This cake is excellent as written. IF you have real health-foodies, it tastes almost as good with 1/2 the sugar and raisins added.  But: try it as written first: 5 people devoured the whole cake in half an hour!!

I think all these oily cake complaints might come from scaling the cake down.  I cut the recipe in half before and it comes out super oily.  If I bake at the default quantity it comes out perfect.  

I'm not surprised though banking gets wonky like that when you tinker with it.  The baking time... I think is a little low but better a little low than too high.

I don't know how anyone can mess up this recipe.  It's absolutely perfect as is.  I've used canola and vegetable oil and it always comes out wonderful.  The only thing I can think of is that they're not mixing the carrots and dry ingredients well enough before adding the wet ones.  I serve this at my restaurant and it's the most requested dessert.  THANK YOU!

I put fresh lemon juice from 1/2 lemon or lime juice to the frosting (and less sugar). It makes it refreshing.

We made this carrot cake for thanksgiving becausemy husband loves carrot cake.  We did not use the pecans in the frosting.  The frosting was a bit dry so I added a little bit of milk to make the frosting creamier.  Regardless this cake turned out awesome, dense and moist!  It got rave revews during thanksgiving dinner.

WOW! Delicious! I made this as cupcakes so the cook time went down to 25 minutes and I cut the confectioner's sugar in half for the frosting (you may have to mix extra depending on how much frosting you want to put on each one - it turns out more like decadent icing)

I substitute 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of the oil called for in the recipe. It gives the cake a lighter (yet still delicious) taste and cuts a lot of fat and calories.

I made this cake for the first time last weekend.  Boy was it a great hit with the whole family!!  We've been craving a real carrot cake for ages, but every one I tried to make (or even the store bought ones) were really a "SPICE cake" with very little carrot in them.  I'm so glad to have found this recipe.  I didn't find it overly oily as some here complained about and I just used regular vegetable oil(Wesson).  I did make a few alterations but nothing major. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had available. I also added a good handful of raisins. I did think that the recipe for the frosting was way too sweet so I made the frosting from one of the recipes on this web site.  It's the one called Cream Cheese Frosting II and it came out very good and not nearly as sweet. My husband has already requested another one for tomorrow for dessert after our belated St. Patty's Day meal.  We can't wait to have more of this wonderful cake.

This cake was GREAT! The only thing I did differently was use walnuts instead of pecans and I baked it for 60 minutes. It was moist and delicious!

This recipe was an absolute hit. I did substitute one cup of applesauce for one cup of oil. I also used a little less sugar in the frosting but this is by far one of the best carrot cakes I have ever had. May attempt to add a few raisins the next time out.

MUST ALTER!!! Far too much oil and powdered sugar in the icing. It is far too oily if made according to the directions.  Substitute applesauce and mandrin oranges was the key for me.  I loved it but only when I altered it sorry...

I made this for my cousin, whose favorite cake in carrot.  He is a gourmet cook & I was pleased when he said it was the best he had ever eaten.  I discovered I was out of pecans so I used black walnuts & they were yummy.

This recipe is almost identical to my mom's carrot cake recipe. It always gets rave reviews whenever I make it. The oil IS the right amount. It's supposed to be moist! And I have never had a problem with the oil sitting on the bottom of the pan? as some reviewers mentioned. So if you modify this recipe *sigh* then expect the cake not to come out as tasty as it should! And making the frosting from scratch is almost necessary! NO store-bought canned frosting! BLAH. If you are looking for a "healthy & low fat" cake, then pass this one by and make one out of tofu! Life is meant to be enjoyed and that means eating something delicious & sinful once in awhile!

As far as I'm concerned, this is THE carrot cake recipe.  Everyone I have made it for just melts the moment they put it in their mouht.  HOWEVER, I do make 1 1/2 times the frosting because I like to make 3 round layers and slather the frosting in between each one.  YUM! Sometimes I add a bit of shredded coconut to the batter and the frosting for a lil extra something.

MUST USE 1/2 APPLESAUCE for the oil! Otherwise way too oily. Grated the carrots SMALL so mixes in with the rest of the ingredients.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers – ½ APPLESAUCE for the oil, boiled raisins in rum before adding, added 1 c. sweet small flaked coconut and 1 large can crushed drained pineapple, much much much better than the other one on this site that got over 1500 reviews. (because I am HIGH ALTITUDE I also had to add 3/4 c. more flour which we have to do with most recipes)

THis carrot cake is brilliant. Its easy to make and quick too.
Watch out because it does stick to the tray once you remove it from the pan. you might want to sprinkle some sugar on the tray before putting the cake on it.

Great cake!  I made mine into a layered cake.  I love how the cake baked nice and flat instead of with a hump in the middle.  The layers were nice and firm and had no problems getting it out of the pan.  Very easy to work with.  This recipe will replace my old one.  Thanks!

Like most other reviewers I modified the original recipe too. Used Egg Beaters instead of eggs, used 1/2 Cup oil plus 1 Cup applesauce and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  It was very moist and delicious - not a crumb was wasted!  I made the frosting as in the recipe and it was just enough to thinly cover the two 9" round layers I made.  Will definately make again - my husband has already asked!

This is the best carrot cake EVER. I ended up with a marriage proposal for making this cake for a co-worker! I did cut back on the oil slightly to 1 1/4 C. Added more cinnamon and cloves.

This recipe has potential, but I don't understand why it has such a high rating.  It is way too oily and rather bland for carrot cake.  I would prefer not to modify it and will keep looking for a better recipe.

Lives up to its name.
I also cut back on sugar (by a half cup) and didn't use oil (I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup flax seed instead). It turned out awesome and super moist.

Very nice. I made a few changes according to some suggestions - I increased cinnamon to 2 tsp, for the oil I used approx 1 C applesauce and made up the difference with oil to make 1 1/4 cups, I cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups.  For the frosting I cut down the sugar to one cup only.

I baked in  a 9 x 13 pan and had to bake it for a full 55 minutes before it was fully done. Make sure you use a small hole grater for the carrots... VERY nice recipe overall - I will definitely be making this over and over again.

I was making this cake late the night before a picnic. It looked great when I got it out of the oven, but then I looked back over the recipe and realized that I LEFT OUT THE OIL! I was quite worried about how it would taste, but it was fantastic - the hit of the picnic....and fat free (except the icing)! You could not even tell that I had made a mistake - it was moist, sweet, and spicy. I will make it again without the oil. Perhaps I added more like 3.5 cups of carrots, so maybe that helped the cake to be moist.

I was really worried about this cake while I was making it.  I put it in 3 loaf pans, and I was afraid it wouldn't turn out.  On the contrary, it turned out wonderfully.  With the oil and pineapples, I thought it would be overly moist, but it was pretty perfect (especially after putting the loaves in the fridge overnight).  I did drain the pineapples though.  Next time, I think I'll keep the pineapple juice and reduce the amount of oil.  Great recipe.

The cake turned out good except for one thing.  It was REALLY oily.  I would definately substitute 1 cup applesauce and use 1/2 cup oil. Other than that it would have been great.  I will try it again but instead use the applesauce!

This really is an awesome cake!  My husband loved it.  I made the following adjustments and it came out near perfect.  2 1/2 Cups of Carrots, 1 3/4 C.White Sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 C. Vegetable oil, 1/4 C. Applesauce, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. all spice plus I soaked a handful of raisins in the pineapple juice for about 20 minutes before mixing into the batter.  I had to add about 5-8 minutes to the cooking time.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It was dense and oily and rather smushy.  I've got a 20 year old recipe that I normally use that calls for canned carrots, so I thought I'd search out one with fresh carrots for this fall.  Considering all the rave reviews, I can't imagine how my idea of carrot cake could be so different!  The flour to oil/moisture content is all wrong.  I followed the directions to the letter (and I'm an avid baker).  After searching through many recipes, including my old one, I notice that most others call for a full additional cup of flour to the same amounts of liquid/oil.

Wonderful recipe...Made for Husband's Birthday and it was a big hit.  Did make changes as other reviewers had suggested.  I only used 1/2 cup oil, and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I used 2 cups of Splenda instead of the sugar.  I also used two rounded teaspoons of cinnamon.  Delicous...the first thing my Husband said was, "Wow, this is sooo moist!" No one could tell that I used Splenda in place of the sugar.

This recipie would have definetly gotten five stars if it had not been so oily tasting.  My suggestion to anyone who would like to try this recipie:  use only 1/2 to 3/4 cup of oil.  This recipie is very flavorful and moist. Also, the frosting matches well and makes the whole cake final, especially since it's homemade and not out of a can. Overall this carrot cake recipie is a great choice.-Nikkii

This cake was so good! I made it for my husbands birthday with his family and they LOVED it. I did make afew changes after reading some reviews-1st I only used 1/2 cup of oil.  Then I used 2 tsp of cinn. and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg I layered the cake by using 2-9inch pans.  There was plenty of frosting to do this. Very moist! It looked and tasted wonderful thanks for the great recipe-

This truly is an awesome carrot cake.  I've tried many different recipes and this one is the best so far.  I altered the recipe following previous suggestions and only used 3/4 cup oil...I added 1/2 cup applesauce and drained most of the juice from the pineapple.  I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp. each of cloves and nutmeg.  We aren't too fond of chopped nuts so I only used about 1/3 cup, and I added 3/4 cup raisins.  This recipe is definitiely a keeper and takes no time to make.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for Easter and it was good. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and omitted the nuts and added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/4 cup sweet shredded coconut. It turned out well. The icing was excellent and covered the two 9" cakes I made into one large layer cake. My only criticism is that the spices need to be more intense(will add nutmeg, and a bit of allspice next time and more cinnamon)to compete with all the carrots. Also, I found the cake hard to cut because it was so moist and dense. I had to keep removing cake bits from the knife with each cut and I never got a perfect slice. Serving it was messy.

I had my doubts....when I got the batter all put together it was so runny, but I persisted.  This was soooooo good!  My husband commented that it is moist you could wring it out.  One thing I will do next time is cut the oil down to 1 Cup as there was so much that there was a layer of it left on the bottom of the cake pan. A definate thumbs up!!

I do not think that this Cake (if it can really be called that)deserves the praises heaped on it by most viewers. I am not saying it is not good. It is, but definitely not as awesome as other reviewers have chosen to label it. I have baked and eaten better carrot cakes than this. This is more of a "pudding" rather than Cake. The sugar content should definitely be cut down as otherwise the end result is far too sweet.It also requires some additions like raisins and likewise much less oil than that stated in the recipe. It is a good cake to make for people who have very little or no experience with cake making, as this recipe basically only calls for all the ingredients to be mixed together, poured into the pan and baked. A three star rating is generous enough.

Super moist but oh sooooo bad for you.  4 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of oil!!!  The low fat cream cheese in the frosting cracks me up.  It was out of this world though and add raisins to make it even yummier!

When I made this swapped 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar, added 1 tsp  of fresh ground nutmeg, 2 Tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of golden raisins. The oil could really be cut back of this cake but that just to my tastes. Also used cream cheese frosting with candy pecans and candy bacon.

I actually made this for my brother's birthday and he is a big carrot cake fan, he loved it, everyone loved it and they couldn't believe it had cream cheese. The only changed I was forced to make was less carrots (2 cups)and less oil (1 cup), only because I ran out and I didn't have pecans so instead I added almonds. Also I didn't add the nuts to the frosting I just threw all the nut of the top of the cake, to make it look nicer-ish. The ONLY PROBLEM I had was the frosting was very creamy and wouldn't stay put so I frosted it three separate times and I had it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hrs-ish so I guess just add more powered sugar to the frosting or refrigerate for a least 3 hrs.

Traveling and didn't have my "Tried and True" carrot cake recipe, so after reading SEVERAL recipes on this site and others, I opted for this recipe !  It is AMAZING!  I did cut the oil to 1 cup since I remembered the amount from my recipe.  I think I have a NEW tried and true!    Great recipe,  those that didn't like it -  don't know what to tell you.  Give it another try!

The cake looked so tempting when it was in the pan.... just perfect.....The surprise came when you put it in your mouth. It tasted like a funnel cake with carrots and some nuts in it. Followed the recipe word by word with utmost care and so disappointed with the outcome. Maybe it needs some whipping and then just fold the nuts and carrots in it. Not even motivated to alter it a bit with suggestions. I just wonder seeing all the five stars as where I could've gone wrong.

Perfect recipe!!! I have never had a bad carrot cake with this one - I don't use the nuts for the simple fact that I am unsure if the people I am baking for will enjoy/are allergic to them but I am sure it is delicious!!  If you love carrot cake I would highly recommend this one!!

Great recipe.  I only used 3/4 cups of vegetable oil and it still came out very moist.  If I would have used the full 1 1/2 cups I think the cake would have come out very oily.  

For the frosting I just used 8 oz cream cheese, half a stick of unsalted butter and 2 cups of powdered sugar.  It was the perfect amount to frost the 9 x 13 cake.

The best carrot cake!  My husband is a carrot cake lover and he is so picky when it comes to carrot cake and he just loved this one.  The frosting is what really does it.  I left out the nuts since my son is allergic to them and it was still awesome!

I followed this recipe and did not care for it. Maybe it is ok with alterations, but why would anyone rate it good when it isn't the same recipe because they've changed ingredients. There are far better carrot cake recipes than this.

One of the best carrot cakes I've had! I substituted whole-grain white flour, walnuts instead of pecans, cut the sugar to 1 cup, used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for a healthier version and everyone loved it!

I have to agree with the previous comments. The cake is way too sweet and oily. Also so much salt is not necessary. You have to bake the cake def. more than 40 minutes! A oil base doug/pastry  should be bake by 320 F for about 60-75minutes!  But I like the idea with the pineapple. Very nice! Just take only 1 cup of suger, only 1 cup of oil, only a pinch of salt and the cake it perfect! I love to ad walnuts or replace it with pumpkin/almonds.

Amazzzzzzing! I tweaked the recipe slightly, more applesauce, less oil...added misc ingredients. Bought this to a friend's family party, and everyone wanted the recipe! So moist and delicious, respect comes from me...and the likes of our bellies :) If you reserve a little of the frosting, you can dye & refridgerate it and make great carrot designs on your cake! Thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent!  This was my first time baking a carrot cake, and it was perfect!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  One substitution was applesauce in place of the oil. Very moist and flavorful.

Very easy. Although I'd use 3/4C oil instead of 1 1/2C.
Just mix the ingredients and bake! Be sure to use the cream cheese frosting. Unfortunately my husband ate this entire cake himself over a week and put on 10lbs! LOL! He thinks this carrot cake beats any carrot cake I've ever purchased but never wants me to make it again - it's TOO GOOD!!

VERY Moist, I had to leave it in 20 extra minutes and it was still like batter in the middle. Had to pitch it unfortunately. Way too much liquid in this recipe. I hate to leave a less than favorable rating, but I must on this one :(

This carrot cake is excellent!  So simple to make.  The work is only in grating the carrots.  I have made this a few times - all with excellent results.   I did not find it oily at all - I too used canola.

I did something I never do - I made this cake based on the 4.5 stars rating without reading the reviews! The cake tasted oily and left a greasy feeling on my hands as I threw it in the garbage. (Could there be a typo in the oil measurement?) No one in the house would eat it. Won't make this again as there are far better carrot cake recipes on this site.

I made this cake just as directed and my whole family loved it.  I did not find it too oily at all (maybe because I used canola oil?).  The only change was walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand.  The frosting is to die for - not too sickingly sweet as some are - and I even used all of it on the 9 X 13 cake which I normally don't do.  I did have to bake it about 10 min longer than the 40 mins but I thought it might have been my oven.  Not sure why this got bad reviews about not being healthy.  It's a cake not a vegetable.

I did not care for this. The cake takes forever to bake, and it comes out way too oily. And it tastes like oil. Usually you can't go wrong with a cake. I mean, even if it is bad...it is cake. Someone will eat it. Not this. We threw it away. And that is a lot of food to throw away. We never bothered making the frosting, but I'm thinking that you don't really need that much sugar or that much butter. This was truly a disappointment.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe is written and it was absolutly awesome. I did omit the extra pecans from the iceing though and I added a couple of tablespoons of water during the mixing of the iceing.It did take about fifty minutes to cook through.My family has already requested another one.I will definetly use this recipe again.

Stellar cake! When I take this to work I have to be sure and take the recipe for people to copy. Delicious combination and never any leftovers. I made the recipe as is, no substitutions. Obviously, the sugar and oil content are high. I certainly don't think anyone eating it considers it a 'health' food. This is a rich recipe meant to be enjoyed very occasionally, and in small servings. Sometimes it's nice to just enjoy the taste of food!!

This carrot cake truly is awesome. Nice and moist. Everyone loved it, even those who said they use do not like carrot cake enjoyed this. I left out the nuts since hubby is allergic but threw in a couple handfuls of raisins instead. One note, my oven temp is pretty accurate and it took about 20 min longer to bake than the receipe indicated using a 9x13" pan.

After reading through all the carrot cake recipes on this site...this one seemed the best.  It came out wonderful and was by far the most moist carrot cake I've ever eaten.  I did make a few modifications:  used 1c. each of white sugar and brown sugar, 1 c. Canola Oil, 1/2 c. Olive Oil, and I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  I baked it in 2 9" pans and used a traditional Cream Cheese frosting.  I will definitely make again!!!

I have noticed that all carrot cakes on this website use 'white sugar'. I assume this means Granulated Sugar and would recommend using soft brown sugar or Demerera sugar instead as it brings out the flavour better.

WAY TOO OILY... it tastes great, and this recipe has potential, but there is literally a pool of oil on the cake plate.  You can taste the oil and it has a very soggy, greasy texture. Cut the oil AT LEAST in half... I will definitely try this recipe again but no way will I use 1.5 cups of oil! 

I would suggest that allrecipes makes a permanent change to this recipe... it's an expensive cake to make and very disappointing when it is ruined by the extreme amount of oil.

Absolutely perfect.  The best carrot cake I've had!  My family couldn't stop raving about how delicious this cake was!

I made adjustments to the recipe as other users had suggested: reduced sugar to 1.5 cups (half white sugar, half brown sugar), used more cinnamon (2 tsp), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, added a dash of cloves, reduced amount of oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce.

I'm definitely going to make this again soon since 3 of us finished the whole cake in 2 dinners!

I didn't read the reviews before making this which I wish I would have.  I can tell it has a really good base for a great cake but man was it a greasy mess.  I was shocked when I poured 1 1/2 of oil into my measuring cup.  When the cake was done (I made two rounds) and popped the cake out of the pan the bottom of the cake was a greasy mess.  The cake tasted pretty good but was just too greasy and I couldn’t get past it.  My husband though it tasted pretty good but agreed too it was so greasy (from the oil).  I probably will not be making this again.

I came to this website looking for a carrot cake recipe that was the very best. I came across this one and decided to compare to betty crocker. Exact same recipe except only 3/4 c. oil and no pineapple. I wanted alittle pineapple so I added about a 1/4 cup of juice. For those of you making your first carrot cake from scratch this looks like it is to thick for a cake, not to worry its supposed to look that way. To make mine alittle different I made a graham cracker crust for just the bottom of the cake, yummie!! The cream cheese frosting is awesome, but I only used 3 c powdered sugar. Moral of the story is you only need 3/4 c oil so why add the calories because it is still very very moist. My daughter took most of my cake home with her, thank goodness. I woke up this morning thinking about a piece of that cake.

I just ate my first piece of this "not so awesome" carrot cake and know now that I should've went with my gut instint and NOT put the full cup and 1/2 of oil that it called for.  When you take the cake out of the oven it is literally sizzling in grease !     I at this cake off of a paper plate (bad idea)...there is so much OIL in the cake that it  soaked through the first plate so I  had to throw another on under it and it soaked through that one!      I liked the idea of adding the pineapple and using pecans rather than walnuts, but I think I shall try another recipe next time.

Very easy and great cake! I did make it in a two layer round pan though to make the presentation  a little fancier. Used the preshredded carrots in the produce section to make things easier on myself and surprisingly, they worked well. I did not have any issues with the oil as others have.

The cake is very moist and tasty but I cut the oil to little more than 1/2 cup, then make up the rest with unsweetened apple sauce, and because the apple sauce is sweet by itself, I cut the sugar by 1/2 as well. It still comes out very moist because of the carrots but you can enjoy it more knowing there's a lot less sugar and oil in it. And with the icing you don't miss less sugar at all. Everyone I've served it to has loved it, and mostly go for seconds. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the heavy oil and sugar content, not taste or texture.

I completely drained the pineapple juice off the pineapple. I used 1 cup coconut, no raisins or nuts. Cooked in 2 square cake pans. Cook longer than 40 mins.

A great recipe to start from, and with some necessary adjustments, a keeper!  I made this in a 9x11 pan for my Easter guests, and it was received by Great Grandma as possibly the best she has ever had!  First off, 3/4 cup of oil is ALL you need. No applesauce required for a moist, dense cake. The moisture from the carrots and pineapple make additional oil unnecessary.  I also cut the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups,  doubled the cinnamon to 2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp of allspice and 1 cup of raisins.  I didn't use the entire 1 cup of pecans called for in the frosting, about 1/2 cup was plenty, and then I dusted some over the cake after frosting.  Pretty!  Plan on baking for 50 minutes, it was not done after 40 and perfect at 50.  Sliced up beautifully, and WOW!  My guests are still calling today to see if there are leftovers!  Thanks!

Cut the oil to 1 cup and used applesauce as others suggested but it was still too moist.  Would have liked it a bit more cakey, but other than that wonderful.  Icing was wonderful.

First let me say, I do not like carrots.  But, I had so many I had to figure out what to do with them.  I made this recipe using only 1 cup oil and 1 cup sugar.  This cake is fantastic.  We were out of pecans, so I didn't use those either.  Also, I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe from this site.  My family couldn't stop eating this stuff up.  The loved it.  The only problem I had was I read another post that said they doubled the recipe to put in a bundt pan.  So, I did the same.  Now, I have a bundt cake, 1 8 inch cake and 12 cupcakes.  We have carrot cake coming out of our ears.

I found this cake to be too moist and oily even when I only used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  My husband raved though and said he thought it was one of the best he's had and requested it again.....

I think I have finally perfected a carrot cake recipe.  Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and the oil to 3/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup shredded coconut, 1/2 cup raisins, and 1/2 cup craisins.  My secret though was to first bring to a rolling boil in a small sauce pan the raisins and craisins in 1/2 cup dark rum (you could also use orange juice or pineapple juice).  Let cool, and add the plumped-up fruit and any remaining liquid to the cake batter. What a great recipe!

I am a 12 year old boy and @ school a couple days ago, we had a "bake off". A bake off is when people compete in creating a dessert and it would be judged by a student. I created(by my self) a black forest cake(will post recipe later) and this carrot cake. I substitued the oil for 1/2 of buttermilk and 1/2 cup applesauce. I reduced the cream form the frosting. I won unaminously comepeting against coconut eclairs(i know, what a fun school!☺) BUt otherwise, it was very simpe to make, for i made it myself and it simply srumptious.

This is wonderful!! I made a couple of adjustments because of the amount of oil and sugar.
I added 1 1/2 cups of ground Flax seed to replace 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of buttermilk for another 1/2 cup of oil. I also used some whole wheat flour with the white flour and cut the sugar down.

I made it because I have been wanting carrot cake and couldn't wait to taste it last night...I loved it!!

This recipe is too oily, and I don’t recommend feeding this to the little kids.  The cake tasted okay, but I think it would taste a lot better if u replace some of the oil with applesauce.

I'm giving this a 4-star rating only because it improved after I had altered it.  However, I thank Tracy for submitting the original recipe and the reviewers for wonderful suggestions to improve it.
Like some reviewers, I reduced the amount of oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  My family also believe carrot cake should have raisins so I added 1 cup of raisins and decreased sugar to 1 1/3 cup for this reason.  I have also substituted pecans with walnuts and added about a teaspoon of allspice.  Cake itself came out very moist with just the right amount of sweetness coming from the fruits and sugar.  As for the frosting, I have also reduced the amount of confectioner's sugar to approximately 1 cup and made it thinner by adding few tablespoons of milk.  Nuts were sprinkled on top instead of including in the frosting.
My in-laws are extremely picky-eaters and very diet-conscious.  ...I was so very disappointed to see my husband come home with no leftovers for me!

The cake was very moist, had a nice flavor, and the frosting tasted great, too.  The changes I made were: 1) I decreased the oil in the cake and 2) I scaled the frosting to 18 servings and it was a perfect amount for a 9 x 13" cake.

I did wish that the crushed pineapple was more uniformly crushed.  The larger sized pieces of pineapple were not appealing. I might find a way to chop the pineapple a little finer in a food processor next time.

All in all, I will make this again! It lasted for several days in the refrigerator and it was moist to the last bite.

One word...Yum.  This was my first attempt at a carrot cake and I will look no further.  Since this cake is so moist, the next time I make it I will probably cut the oil by a 1/4 or 1/2 cup.  Great recipe.

I made this for my husbands birthday, he loves carrot cake.  He and my guests loved it.  It is the best carrot cake we have ever had, its not dry at all.  I cut back on the oil and did not add pecans to the frosting.

AWESOME IS RIGHT!
I made this cake for my sons 2nd birthday and everyone at the party thought it was fantastic! My husband does not like cake, but after tasting this one, he declared it was one of the best desserts he ever had and loves it!. 
I also took the advice to reduce the oil down, and I halved the amount recommended. 
THIS IS A VERY WET BATTER! I had to cook it an extra 20 minutes, it got a beautiful dark brown, NOT BURNED THOUGH!on the top. A great cake.

Holy cake crumbs!!  I just baked this cake last night...  fabulous!  So, moist.  So, tasty.  So, just right.  It is even better the next day.  I did make a couple changes.  Only used 1 C. oil and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  This is a very wet batter and I also had to bake it for 35-40 min.  Perfect!

This cake was AWESOME!  I made it for a super bowl party and there wern't any leftovers!  I had lots of compliments!  I made a few adjustments:  I only used 1 cup oil, added raisins and extra cinnamon. From the frosting I omitted the pecans and only used 3 cups of confectioners' sugar.  This is one of the best carrot cakes I've had; very moist and flavorful!  I highly recommend this!  Thank you Tracy for sharing this wonderful recipe!

As my husband said, this cake is AWESOME! It made me laugh and told him the title of the recipe. I followed the others' suggestion of cutting back on the oil, using cinnamon applesauce, and adding more cinnamon. Next time, I'll try adding nutmeg and ginger. This one I'll definitely keep in my file. Thank you.

I am only giving this cake two stars because after two attempts I could not get it to an edible state.  After the first baking, the cake was a pudding (as commented by another reviewer).  I tried cutting the oil down to 1 cup and baking an additional 15 minutes the second time I ended up with something hard and sticky. I do believe that someone out there got this to work and so I give the recipe two stars.  The icning was tasty - cream cheese was used as a substitute.

Excellent cake. Made a few changes after reading reviews. Added 4 c. carrots, a little less than 1c. oil, 1&1/2 c. sugar, 2 tsp.cinnamon, and I drained the pineapple. For the icing: 1&1/2 c. confectioners sugar, 16oz. cream cheese, and omitted the pecans. Having them in the cake seemed enough. Might try walnuts next time. It was a delicious, moist, carrot cake.

Awesome carrot cake is a truly fitting name for this recipe! I have been making this recipe since April '01, and have received nothing but raves. I've been asked for the recipe every single time...

However, I *do* make the following changes: 
I never make the frosting for this. I've always just made a light dusting with powdered sugar, or eaten plain. Lovely. 
Reduced the amount of sugar to 1-1/2 cups (personal preference), doubled the amount of cinnamon to 2 tsp., and drained the pineapple before adding it to the mix. I also only use between 3/4 c.-1 c. of oil, which is plenty. The original amount of oil called for will make the cake MUCH too greasy. If you like nuts, the pecans give the bread great texture. I've used walnuts and almonds, too. (Separately.) Every once in a while, I'll also add a small amount of finely ground bakers coconut. Scrumptious!

Made it for EAster and it was a big hit.  I too reduced the amount of oil and sugar for the cake and added coconut.  I'm going to try to reduce the amount of butter in the frosting too.  THe frosting was a bit soft for my desires so I may refriderate it before I frost the cake next time.  It was the best carrot cake I've ever had.

A wonderful carrot cake, but takes a while to grate those three cups of carrots!  Worthwhile, though, because it's moist, flavorful and just plain yummy.  Brought it to work, and took the empty dish home the same day.

This cake is excellent!  I did have trouble with the baking time.  Mine actually took 55 minutes at the same temp.  At 30 minutes - it wasn't close to being done.

No problem though - it is DELICIOUS!

This cake has way too much oil.  I really like the flavor.  It has the perfect amount of carrots, and is not spiced so much that it covers up the carrot taste.  However, the recipe calls for too much oil.  I made it 3 times and the last time I CUT THE OIL DOWN TO ABOUT 1 1/8TH CUP and it turned out great.  I had to rate the recipe as it is written so I gave it 3 stars.

After preparing the cake ingredients, I thought there were way too many carrots. I'm so glad I just went ahead and baked it. It is wonderful! It is moist with an incredible texture! The cream cheese frosting is light and the perfect compliment to the cake. This is definitely my go to carrot cake!! I've also added more spice and raisins for a little variation.

Yes, I have and this is the BEST carrot cake that I've eaten. It's moist and yummy. It's not dry like the majority carrot cakes I've tried. This is the best recipe so far that I have found. Try it, you'll love it!

Delicious!!! My first time making a carrot cake and it was easy and so delicious. I followed the recipe exact the only difference is the baking pan I used was a bunt pan and it baked beautifully -- I would not change.

I found this recipe years ago, and have been making it ever since! I make this cake every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and my family LOVES it. I did change a few things: 1. I beat the eggs seperately, then gradually add the oil....whisking until light in color. Then I add the pinapple, carrots, and nuts, and mix. I mix the flour, sugar, and spices together in a seperate bowl, and gradually add to the wet mixture. I find this makes for a lighter, fluffier cake. 2. For the icing, I use 1 stick unsalted butter, and 1/2 "brick" of cream cheese. Makes for a lighter, creamier icing.  Also, because of the pineapple, this cake MUST be kept refrigerated...the moisture from the pineapple will make it go bad quickly if not kept at a cool temperture...

It was good, but I agree with the too much oil comment, seems excessive!! Icing makes too much, more than needed.

On the rich side and the coconut is pretty strong.  (For those who aren't crazy about coconut, I'd just leave it out.)   But the cake is moist and very delicious and worth the nuisance of grating the carrot!  I iced with lite creamcheese, butter and about 1-1/2 cups confectioner's sugar.  Be sure to have a glass of milk or vanilla ice cream on hand.

Most delicious cake EVER!  Thank you so much for sharing this.  Our family has a new favorite.  We halved it because I knew we'd have a lot of Easter candy around our house as well.  Boy, I wish I had made the full recipe!  It was SO good.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The original recipe was very oily and runny, but still tasty. The first batch of cupcakes I put in the oven didn't turn out well. But I just added more flour to the batter, and they turned out AMAZING. I received so many compliments!

This cake was nasty! I wish I would have read more of the reviews before I made it and I would have looked for another recipe. Way too much oil in cake and too much butter in frosting.

I did not change any of the ingredients and I followed the instructions to the 'T'. The cake was a little oily (left slick spots on my plate). My guests liked it, though.  The frosting came out really thin. Not sure what happened there.  It did taste good, but next time I'll reduce the oil by at least 1/2c.

This was amazing! Very moist and tasted wonderful. Advice.. Takes a little longer to bake (I had it in for 50 min) and the frosting was a little to sweet so cut back on the sugar.. All in all it is defiantly going to be done again! Thank you for it! My mother loves carrot cake and after this, I think I am to now!!

Wonderful, I made it by simply switching the oil to applesauce and omitting the pineapple. I'm rating high because this recipe can survive so much adaptation. Definitely one I will use again and again.

The best carrot cake ever! I made it for a family event and it was gone in no time.  Everyone loved it. Based on the comments, I added less oil and a handful of raisins. The frosting is delish.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, I actually just lost my paper copy so I came back to print a new one and thought I should comment. I sub 1c applesauce for 1c of the oil like many others do here but the rest I follow to a tee. Its a sinfully delicious birthday request in my family now. Mom can you PLEASE make that yummy carrot cake? Love it!

I wish that there was a warning on this recipe:READ REVIEW FIRST!! Zaboo was right, why give five stars, if you have to completely change this recipe. I made this cake for a birthday, it looked terrible, and tasted like oil, needless to say I had to make another cake. It was very disappointing.

I have made this several times and each time people are impressed, asking for the recipe. I think it has too much sugar though, it's just as good if made with 1-2 cups less.

I think there's way too much oil.  I was making it for a dinner party and could not bring this; had to go buy something last minute which was very frustrating.  I followed this recipe very well.  Do not recommend this recipe.

I am not a huge carrot cake fan, but this is extremely delicious - as is, the only thing I changed was adding more nuts.

I have made this cake so many times...and the frostings recipe multiple times on top of that!  I always use applesauce to almost completely replace the oil. (1cp applesauce and 1/2 cp oil)  It is so moist and flavorful.

The first thing my husband said was "wow you are definitely going to have to reduce the oil the next time you make this."  The cake just sat there.  I made it again and used a little over 1 cup of oil and it was a much better cake. The pineapple was not the problem, it was all that oil.  And yes, you do have to cook this cake for about an hour.

I used 1/2 oil and replaced it with applesauce This was a good wholesome cake. I would not say it is healthy by any means but it was good. I had alot of batter too, and the 9x13 rose twice it's size but the cupcakes did not rise...weird but def good. Try it!

Very good cake. I made it as is except I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I also baked it in 2 9' rounds for about 40 minutes. I know some people said there was too much icing but it was the perfect amount for a layer cake.

This is my husband's FAVORITE.  I bake a lot and this is the ONE thing people always request again and again.  I have always followed the suggestions here to reduce the oil to 3/4c.  I have played around with the sugar quantity and also mixed brown and white sugar.  It's always wonderful.

This definately the very best.  Anyone who found it dry did not follow the recipe.  I did cut the sugar in frosting in half and I also added a bit of coconut to the cake. I have made it over and over by request.  My boss told me he would be giving me a raise if I wasn't retiring because he liked this cake so much.

This is a good flavored cake. The icing is a little sweet for my taste. I added a splash of milk, because it was so thick that my mixer could barely keep up with it. Then I used about 2/3 of the icing recipe for a 9x13 cake.

When I was making this cake, I was surprised that the recipes calls for 1 1/2 cups of oil. I thought I had read it wrong, and had to read the measurements a couple of times to be sure that I was reading it right. Anyway, I followed the recipe to the T. When the cake was done I thought that it was on the oily side, but it was moist and very tasty! I think I will reduce the oil to 1 1/4 cups and squeeze out the pineapple juice the next time I make this cake. I didn't use the cream cheese frosting recipe that came with this recipe. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe which was really good. It was sweet, but not icky sweet.

I hope seekers read more member reviews and don't just stop at the 3 currently on the recipe page. I've made this recipe twice. The first time I definitely was a new cook and would've complained that this was too oily. But just making it again today and having huge success, I wonder if the critics are combining ingredients in order directed and mixing thoroughly? I combined whole wheat and white flours, used 3/4cup turbinado sugar, and added 1/2c raisins. I used a different cream cheese frosting, also on this site, but also reduced the sugar by half and it is all absolutely wonderful. This is absolutely a 5 star cake!

This was very good.  Moist.  I did the 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 c oil and it was great!  Made the cream cheese frosting to taste(not as much sugar).  A keeper!

Boy, did this hit the spot! Like others, I did cut back the oil to 1 cup, used chopped walnuts rather then pecans. I used 2, 9 inch round pans and cook time was a little less, maybe around 25 minutes. Also, I used shredded carrots in a bag to cut time. I did not use the frosting recipe that was included, but used another from this site. Everyone loved it and it will be a regular treat at our house.

Have made this multiple times now and get rave reviews every time!  I've made this into cupcakes as well and they turn out great (same temperature but bake for about 15 - 20 minutes)...I modified it my second time around by using 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and omitting the oil and replacing it with unsweetened applesauce...much healthier and a better cake!!!!!

Definately the BEST carrot cake I have ever made and super easy too!  I buy grated carrots from the salad counter at the supermarket to make it even quicker. Always gets rave reviews and recipe requests.

I made this cake for a party last week. My company all loved it! I think it is perfect the way it is. Not to oily, very moist. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this cake twice (for my 4-year-old's birthday party, and then for my 1-year-old's birthday party) and I had tons of compliments both times! Everyone raved about it, and even my hard-to-please in-laws said it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had. I have to agree with them, it is a great recipe. The only changes I made include: using 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 1/2 cups oil, 1 cup of sugar instead of 2, all whole wheat flour, and about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.

I've made this twice within the last 2-3 weeks and both times it was just "awesome"!!! Both times I doubled it. The first making a layered cake and the second I made a single and a bunch of cupcakes. Also, the second time I added a cup or so of raisins. Thanks for this great recipe!

If I could give this a 4.5 I would. The cream cheese frosting is divine... and even if I find a better carrot cake, I will definitely use this frosting. The cake itself was somwhat bland, I should have added a few more spices (I added cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg).. it's still missing something. I baked it in a 12 inch round dish and it turned out great. Thanks!

This cake was bland. The ingredients sounded right, but the taste just wasn't there. I even wound up doubling the amounts of cinnamon, adding nutmeg and cardamom, and even golden raisins, as well as a few other attempts at salvaging it.

This was the first time that I had ever attempted anything close to this caliber and it was a hit.  The only thing that I changed was the amount of sugar that I added to the frosting.  I would recommend add to taste.  And then...ENJOY!!!

My mother requests this cake for her birthday every year! This year, I followed some reviewers suggestions and added a pinch of allspice to the batter abd doubled the cinnamon. As I also thought that the cake turns out a bit too oily, I substituted 1 1/2 cups of cinnamon applesauce + 1/2 cup of the oil that was called for. My mom is diabetic, so I used 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup Fifty50 fructose, and 1 cup Splenda. (You can't hardly even tell!) But, I have found that the tweak that really sets this cake off, is when I add cinnamon to the cream cheese frosting! It is the absolute best!

I love this carrot cake recipe. It is all that carrot cake should be. I have made this one two times (one for easter and one for a birthday cake). I do not use the icing recipe included. I use a different one from this site. GREAT RECIPE!!

Worth 5 stars.

I tried this recipe last week with rave reviews from all who had a piece. I made the following changes: walnuts instead of pecans (most of my taste testers suggested adding a bit more to the batter than recipe prescribes), "marinated" the grated carrots for 30 mins in brown sugar before adding to batter, halved the white sugar, added 3/4 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, used normal cream cheese for the frosting and baked in a bundt-style pan at 160C fan-forced oven for about 50 minutes.

This has replaced my tried and true carrot cake recipe.  The oil scared me but it's all forgotten when you take the first bite!  Good with pecans or without.  Pineapple is unnoticable.  I made this for a friend who "hates pineapple".  She didn't even know it was there.

Very happy with this recipe, makes a deliciously moist and dense cake.  Yes, there were adjustments needed.  I cut back on the oil by 1/2 cup, and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Also, for the 9x13 pan, we ended up adding 15 min to baking time.  Excellent.  Made it the first time for Easter, it was a perfect dessert with coffee, a rave!

OMG!!!  I finally made this recipe, for our Easter desert (carrots, get it?)!  Carrot cake is my absolute favorite, but I wanted to hold of making it til Easter!  EVERYONE loved it!  I didn't change a thing.  I'd rate it higher than 5* if I could!  It's the best, right up there with Disney's and Claim Jumpers (my other favorites).  Now, I can make it myself at HOME!  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!  I just can't praise it enough!

This cake was awesome...I didn't listen to all the reviews that suggest that the cake will taste "greasy" if you don't cut the oil back a bit. I made the cake exactly as stated in the recipe and it was very moist and not at all "greasy". It was perfect. As far as the icing I wanted to have plenty for decorating and frosting the cake so I doubled the recipe. I also did not use the Neufantel cheese...just plain old Cream Cheese. Will definitely make this again.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now and everyone loves it. The only thing I change is I use 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil. I don't use the pineapple either. Very moist. Also I don't measure the sugar in the frosting...I just add to taste..I probably only use about 1 and 1/2 cups.

I also thought this cake was too greasy and a little too sweet.  I added probably 3-1/2 cups of carrots because I had shredded that many, so just threw them in- maybe that made it more moist than necessary.  So I will reduce the sugar a little next time, use just 3 cups of carrots, and maybe use 1/2 the oil and add a little applesauce to make up for the rest.  It turned out beautifully; I loved the frosting and it was more than enough to frost and fill a 2-layer cake (instead of the single layer).

Maybe I did something wrong.  I thought this cake was VERY greasy.  The oil is overwhelming and ruins the cake in my opinion.  I might try again but use butter or shortening ILO oil.

PERFECT!  Added 1 1/2 cups raisins to the batter.  Reserved 1/4 cup pecans from icing mixture and sprinkled them on top.  These extra touches, especially the raisins, really added a lot!  EXCELLENT RECIPE!

I like to make a recipe as shown originally and then make up my own mind how it would best suit me.  Lovely moist cake, but as others have suggested, I will cut down on the oil and substitute for the apple puree and also cut down alittle on the sugar, then I'm sure it will rate a 5 star!

i was really looking forward to making this recipe because of all the great reviews. but i was disappointed. it was just okay. i found it was too oily tasting and i found the pineapple an odd addition. i don't think i'd make this again.

Awesome like the name.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out fine, cooking in 40 minutes, with no sagging in the middle.  Only slight weird thing I did is I had to crush my own pinapple as I only had rings!  Would definitely make again.  I may try substituting applesauce for oil, just for the health factor, but I have to say it really seemed quite good - not too greasy as some suggested.  Good Luck!

This cake was a huge disappointment. It has very little taste, is VERY greasy and most definitely NOT healthy.

I thought this recipe was fair. It was kind of bland.  The only change I made was I used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar.  I had a lot of freshly cut pineapple that I wanted to use up and I thought that alone would really jazz up the cake as opposed to canned pineapple. It was barely even noticable.  I'm usually not really big on heavy spice in a cake but I thought this recipe needed MORE than was called for. I'm not saying this recipe sucked or anything, but it was only fair to good at best. Oh, I also added raisins because I like them in a carrot cake and that helped the flavor and texture a bit.

This is an incredible recipe that never fails to please anyone who trys it.  I am asked to make it for EVERY special occasion that arises. I usually use 1c applesauce and 1/2 oil and 1c sugar plus 1c splenda.  I think it tastes better when made in two 9-inch round pans (instead of as a sheet cake) and iced with a fluffy, light, whipped icing.

I made this cake for Mother's Day and it was fantastic! It was so big that I took what was left to work and my co-workers dubbed it "my dish" forever! One small change though... I used 3/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of the whole amount of oil. After reading previous reviews I think I made a great choice!

This was an awesome.  It was gone as soon as I turned around.  The icing was absolutley delicious.  The only thing was it was pretty dense so ill try to put more carrots and nuts in next time.

This cake definatly lives up to its name!  I made this as part of a Valentine's dinner for my husband and I and it was delicious!  My husband thought it was so good, he had three pieces!  The only thing I had to do differently was cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than instructed in the recipe, though it didn't affect it at all, it was SO moist and the frosting just topped it off perfectly.  I think this cake is better than any carrot cake I've ever had at any restaurant.
Thanks Tracy for this wonderful recipe!

the carrot cake turned out fantastic (**although a little too moist**) and was, certainly, the best we had ever had.  

The modifications took a while to figure out, though so the recipe is NOT perfect.  I recommend reading most of the comments and deciding for yourself what you need.  Personally, I used 1/2c oil with 1/2c applesauce, less sugar, loads of spices (ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon,nutmeg, AND Dried Orange Peel.)

I also adjusted the recipee for high altitude cooking (i'm at 10k feet!)  by adding 1 Tbsp liquid per cup, reducing the baking soda, powder, and sugar, and increasing the baking temp. by 25*F.  AND it didn't fall.  Woohoo.  And wasn't too dry as usual.  

A great recipe with careful adjustment.

I totally agree with some of the other ppl on this recipe. It is definitely not delicious, its just below OK. I tried to cut the liquid content in the cake like the others said, but it still turned out a very dense and wet(NOT MOIST)cake. Very oily and sticky. The carrot content is also very high. I should have just used two cups of carrot.I am definitely not making this cake again.

I am not a big fan of dense, sticky, heavy, oily carrot cakes. I like them light and fluffy like other regular cakes. The reason I tried this recipe was I could not find my other recipe that I tried for carrot cake from this webiste a while ago,it uses butter instead of oil and it turned out amazing, everybody was raving about it. It was soft, fluffy and light unlike this cake. Unfortunately I forgot the recipe's name, now I will have to search for it all over again.

A healthy cake does not have 1 1/2 cups of oil in it.  Try the lite carrot cake on this site.

This is my first time making a carrot cake.  I did not find the Neufchatel chesse so i skipped the frosting.  I think there's too much oil, i think it should be 1 cup of oil instead because the cake turned out to be floating on oil.  My parents thought the taste was good, just too much oil.  Overall, i think i'll try another carrot cake recipe.

Surfed many recipes before choosing this one, and everyone says it is indeed awesome.  I have tried two since that seemed to have the right "stuff" but everyone prefers this one after tasting the others.  I'mm considering this a gold standard.

I made this cake for Easter and it was delicious.  I reduced the oil a bit, but I'm not sure it was necessary.  Cake was very moist.  I did not use the icing as it sounded a little rich. I made a frosting out of cream cheese, cream, and conf. sugar.  Next time I will try the icing in the recipe.

Awesome! I reduced the oil by half and it was just as moist. I also doubled the cinnamon and added some ginger and allspice. I also used two 8 inch round cake pans. Thank you!

I made this cake last night for a party at my job.  I was concerned about the amount of oil that was in the recipe.  I followed the instructions,with a few modifications. I did not add  the pecans, I added raisins, coconut, and cut down on the sugar, I only used 1 1/2 cups, and I did not make the icing.  After it was baked, I turned it out onto a cake circle and let it cool.  The next morning, the cake circle was soaked through with oil!  When we cut it at work, it left grease stains on the plates! The cake itself, tasted good, and was very moist. I think that you should modify or substitute the oil for something else.

Just made this yesterday for family get together and it was gobbled up!  Great taste, moist cake, love the frosting.  I was a little concerned after reading other reviews that it would be to oily but i followed the recipe exactly.  The top was a bit oily but i refrigerated the cake b4 serving and trust me EVERYONE RAVED about it.  I do think next time i will try what another person suggested half oil and half applesauce.  However this cake is extremely good and i have ended my search for a good carrot cake here.  thanks for sharing the cake tracy =)

This is the first time I've made carrot cake from scratch and it was so easy and good!  I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, and used 1 3/4 cup of sugar.  I omitted the nuts (I wanted to let my 11 month old sample it) and I didn't have a can of crushed pineapple so I used 1 cup of the natural style unsweetened apple/pineapple sauce.  I might just use it again!  For the frosting I used just under 2 cups powedered sugar.  I was skeptic to try just one cup, but the next time I make it, I'm going to use 1 cup, since it was a little sweet.

The name says it all - awesome!
Very moist even using apple puree and only 1/2 cup oil. It did stick a little to the tin but the taste made up for that.

Thanks to this recipe, my boyfriend thinks I am a great chef! I have made this for a few different functions, and everyone always requests that I bring it. My boss's wife begged me for the recipe. I made this a layer cake with two, 9" cake pans, and I didn't need any extra frosting. I like to make it this way, because it is beautiful to garnish & display.

I think this carrot cake is fantastic.  I did reduce the oil to 1 1/4 cups,  and added a dash of ground cloves and kept everything else as is.  I don't know what went wrong with the other reviewers bad experiences but I have made this cake numerous times and is had never failed me.  I have even tried using my husbands grandmothers carrot cake recipe (the family recipe),  I found that dry considering it used 3 cups flour,  and just bland.  This cake is moist as all cakes should be.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is definatly a keeper.

I have made this recipe for different occasions, (school functions, church, work, bake sale).  I, too, change the recipe a bit.  I cut the oil to 3/4 c and the cinnamon to 2 tsp.  I don't mind having extra frosting.  I always end up using it.  I have a friend who always requests that I bring it.  Tonight I am hosting Bunco and it will be my dessert.  This recipe has never failed me.

This recipe is best described like the individual that submitted the recipe ,moist, dense and delicious cake. Well that is after I took some of the suggetions from other reviews. I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, doubled on the cinnamon and some nutmeg. On the frosting I used 3 cups of the confectioners sugar and it turned out great. Otherwise I don't think I would of given it 5 stars, because 1 1/2 cup of vegetable oil would have been digusting for that amount of cake. So thanks for the advice my Thanksgiving cake turned out fantastic, compare to all the other desserts  my carrot cake was the topic at the table.

I'm not really a person who likes sweets, and when I do, I haven't really liked carrot cake...but I LOVED THIS!  I followed the recommendations to decrease the oil.  Thanks for that input.  I also halved the icing recipe.  I think next time I'll just reduce it by 1/4.  I could have handled a little more icing.  My little girl and husband love it.  Thanks for the recipe.  Always nice to have a winner the first time you try to create a dish!!!

Based on everyone's comments, I added 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of applesauce, along with 2 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. What a delicious cake! The birthday girl was a big fan and we've been eating it all day. Healthy? Well, at least there's carrots in it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Two reasons for 4 stars, and not 5: 1 1/2 cups of oil, yikes!  And I had trouble with the icing, it took FOREVER to come together.  

That said, the icing was loved by everyone (first comment, "mmm the icing's great", I was worried about the cake!) and the cake is great too.  Nice and moist, with carrots as first ingredient.  I left out nuts completely and had no problems.  A classic carrot cake.

Too much oil!! Something is wrong with this recipe. I thought when some of the other reviews said they threw the cake out, they were exaggerating. I did the same. It might be good if it were changed up a bit.

I made the cake for my dad for Father's Day and ended up having enough for two cakes. This time I experimented with carrot cupcakes and they came out soooooo good! 25 minutes and they were perfect! For the frosting, I used 3 cups of sugar. I could probably use even less. I've been making this recipe for over 10 years now because it's amazing!

Two thumbs down!  Terribly bland and oily.  I was disappointed and dumped the whole cake, frosting and all, down the drain.  What a waste of time!

Dangerously Delicious. I followed the advice of others and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. A half cup would have sufficed.  I did not add any nuts at all.  I have to disagree with some users that the frosting "made" the cake...both my husband and my daughter preferred the cake unfrosted.  Perhaps it was different because I used cream cheese.  
Thank you for sharing a simply wonderful recipie.

Excellent recipe!  I took advice of other posters and reduced the oil by half and I added in nutmeg, allspice and ground cloves for some more flavor.  Other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper.

Made this for Easter family gathering and I had to hide the last few pieces to ensure that I had some for myself!!  I've never made carrot cake before and never considered myself a fan, however, this cake has changed my feelings about carrot cake forever!  I reduced the veg oil by half and was totally pleased with the results.  I followed rest of the ingredients/amounts as written.  I made the 9x13 cake and cut it in half to make it a two layer cake with frosting in the middle.  The amount of frosting was *just* enough to cover and fill the cake.  There were many other home-made desserts at our gathering and this carrot cake was this biggest hit.  I've had a few people call me today to ask if there was any cake left over!  Just a note - the cake was served at room temperature simply because there was not room in the fridge.  I thought the flavor was a little better at room temperature than late last night when I "sampled" a piece that came straight from the  refrigerator.  GREAT CAKE!!!

Moist, yes, healthy & nutritous? Not exactly!!  Excellent cake and very moist.  Followed advice of other reviewers and used only 1/2 the oil, added applesauce, more cinnamon, some allspice, & nutmeg, and drained the pineapple slightly and didn't put in the pecans (used for decoration instead). Baked in two 8" round pans and came out great.  Frosting seems fine to me.  Will definetly make this again (p.s. tastes even better if sits in the fridge for a day--if you can get it to stick around that long!!)

I love carrot cakes, I have a lot of carrot cake recipes, but this one is one of the best. My husband said this recipe deserve 10 stars. The only thing I change was that I used 3/4 cup of oil instead of the 1 1/2 cup that the recipe call.

AAAAAAHHH! The best carrot cake ever, atleast that's what everyone tells me when I make this cake. I also got a recipe for a cream cheese frosting from this website and I add a little bit of the left over pinapple juice to it: for a little kick. EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS CAKE!

Absolutely delicious!! I used 1/2 c. of oil and the cake was just perfect! It made alot of icing - I think I'll try it as a 2  layer cake next time instead of sheet cake to use all the icing.

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday (carrot cake being his favorite) and it was DELICIOUS! However, he doesn't like pineapple so instead I used 1 cup of applesauce, and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. It turned out incredibly moist! Also, I loved the frosting... it was perfect.

It was my first time making carrot cake so I was a bit nervous, but this turned out wonderful. My boyfriend just loved it! I only used 1/2 cup of veg. oil and then I put in 1/2c of apple sauce. I added ginger and all spice for extra flavour. It's a very heavy cake and would probably work better in a bigger pan, but overall, it was great!

Delicious.  Be sure that it bakes all the way through, but other than that this cake is wonderful.  The cream cheese topping is the secret.  It makes the cake!

Very delicious and moist cake! It's the best carrot cake I've ever made from scratch. Both of my kids (3&5) loved it too. They usually just eat the frosting off cake and leave the rest, but they both ate their entire piece!! They even asked for more!

Wonderful, even when made lower in fat!  I substituted a cup of the applesauce for the oil and a tablespoon of milk for the frosting butter. Very moist and tasty. A+.

I made this recipe for a friend's wedding, and everybody raved about it. I've made carrot cakes before, but none turned out as well as this one did, and it smelled wonderful even before it went in the oven.

I made 3 double batches, and cooked it in 3 double size pans.  I had to increase the cooking time by 15 minutes, but they were wonderful.  This should have been 144 servings.  109 people showed up and there were no leftovers.  This worked well for assembly line baking, it was quick and easy to make.

:(   This is the first recipe I have tried that did not, in my opinion, live up to its rating.  After baking the specified time, the cake was very runny in the middle.  I put it back in the oven for another 25 minutes.  The cake was very oily and the icing was too sweet.   I will try this cake again, using much less oil and less powdered sugar in the icing.

This cake was awesome!!  Like many others, I cut back on the oil amount.  I used 1/2 cup oil, did not drain the pineapple, and I used a little more than 4 cups of shredded carrots.  (I used a 2# bag of carrots, peeled them, and then shredded them in my food processor.)  I also did not include pecans, just since my kids don't care for them.  I made 2 9-inch cakes to make a layer cake as a birthday present to my Dad.  I used 3 whole pecans to make a decoration in the center of the cake, then sprinkled crushed pecans all over the cake.  This cake is tasty, moist, and easy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This cake is pretty good. I tried it with 3/4 c of oil, no pineapple juice, 1 1/2 C sugar, added raisins, and made my own cream cheese frosting.  We liked it and so did our guests, but it's still just a tad bit oily tasting to suit me. The recipe is a good one though and I think with a little tweaking to suit our family we'll make it again.

Made this recipe today for an after-dinner treat.  Everyone really enjoyed it, and it was just what I was looking for.....a brownie-like texture - very moist and good.  I did do as suggested and used only 1 cup of oil though, and it still turned out great.  I put more nuts and carrots also, and topped it with a cream cheese icing that I also got from this site.  Thanks for the recipe...it made for some "happy tummies" at my house!!

I have been making this cake for years, WITH the 1 1/2 c. of oil as the original recipe stated and it is my “go-to” recipe for carrot cake, hands down!!!!! It’s not too oily and is the perfect texture. I’ve made this cake and SOLD numerous of them with customers always wanting the recipe. Flawless recipe as it was.

I followed the recipe except for the frosting and baking. I baked the batter in 2 9 inch cake pans for 30 minutes with well greased parchment paper on the bottoms of the pans . The cakes came out without any problems. When cool, I removed the parchment paper.  I creamed the butter and cream cheese until soft then added the sugar. I did not add the nuts to the frosting. I put 1/3 cup chopped nuts in between the layers and put some on top as a decoration.

I doubled the recipe so a can have two layers of 9 by 13.  I used an extra cup of carrot and a cup less sugar. I did sift the dry ingredients before mixing with the carrots and wet ingredients! Everyone loved it!

I only see 1/4 cup oil in the recipe, so I followed it as is.  I haven't even made the frosting yet, and it's a great, moist, yummy recipe.  One word to the wise, the batter is too wet to use cupcake papers with.  Comes out nicely from a greased and floured pan, though.

I tried this recipe today and used the suggestion from others to substitute 1 cup of non-sweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 1/2 cups of oil the recipe calls for and it worked well.  I also added 1/2 c golden raisins and rather than baking in a 9x13 pan, I split the batter between two 8 1/2" rounds.  While I liked the recipe, I would puree the pineapple next time as it was rather chunky for my tastes.

I should have read more of the reviews before trying this carrot cake recipe.  The cake comes out WAY too oily!! If 
i made it again I'd reduce the amount of oil used (maybe 3/4 cup) and substitute something like apple sauce to maintain the moisture.  Moist is great, but there are better ways to achieve a moist cake without resorting to so much oil. Also I'd increase the amount of sugar in the cake batter (the cake comes out barely sweet), maybe use 2 cups rather than a cup and a half. I'm not one for really sugary cakes, but this one needs a bit more sugar. 

If you had to make major adjustments to the recipe, how can you rate it five stars? Please rate the recipe as it appears, not how it turned out when you recreated the recipe to make it palatable.

Awesome!! with some changes!!!Left Out the Pineapple and pecans. Came out perfect, light, not to sweet, not even that oily. This is a good base recipe for anyone who wants to experiment and make it there own.  For anyone who's complaining about the oil in it. I suggest eating it cold/ refrigerated, Not out of the oven.

I have made this recipe on several occasions for different friends and family and have never gotten anything but, great responses!  I followed the recipe, not changing anything and it is great!  The only thing is that it does take a little longer to bake than 30 or 40 minutes.

This is a tasty recipe, but it uses way to much oil.  Cut the oil in half and add some buttermilk or yogurt to replace the moisture loss.  Good otherwise.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and thought it was terrible!  I tried one of the versions where someone suggested changes of less eggs, sugar etc & oh my, I will never do that again.  I will always follow the original recipe  first!

I used 1 1/4 cup of oil and it still came out very very greasy!  This recipe is not my favorite at all.  Maybe I'll try the 1/2 cup of oil 3/4 a cup of applesauce suggestion...

I really liked this recipe!  I used half cinnamon and half pumpkin-pie spice, but next time I will add more of each.  I cut down the oil by 1/4 cup and used less powdered sugar in the icing, as suggested by others.  The fiance LOVED it, though!!  Next time I think I'm going to add raisins.  Overall, a fairly easy recipe for a homemade cake.  Thanks!

This is soooo yummy! I thought 1 1/2 cup oil was to much, so I put 1 1/4 cup. I also didn't have any crushed pineapple, so I used 2 of the small lunch pack sized containers, and put it into my magic bullet to mix it up a bit. Also, I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar, which I thought was PLENTY, as my mixer had a hard enough time mixing... YUMMMMMMY!

Very good.  I had no problems with oiliness, although I did use half oil and half applesauce. I also added coconut.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 baking dish, since it was only for me and hubby and 3 year old.  This took longer to cook, but I just kept testing it with a tooth pick and adding 3 minutes until it was cooked all the way.  Very good.  And the frosting was outstanding - I was surprised there was any left to put on the cake! :)

I did a round layer for this recipe and it did not seem to have enough body, I think that if you were transpose the flour/carrots measurements it would come out better, other wise it had good taste but the cake did not get done in the center.

Awesome it is. I have done this recipe so many times with great success. I never reduce the oil - it does come out very moist with both the crushed pineapple and oil. It never felt too much as others seem to say. The only difference is, I don't use cream cheese frosting! I put whipped cream instead - and since that is light and fluffy, it makes up for the dense cake.

I really liked this recipe, the only changes I made was I only put 1 cup of oil and as I was using a 9inch round cake tin I threw in a carrot and walnut cake mix (I had in the cupboard), 2 extra eggs and a cup of water. And it was absoloultly wonderful!

Very good cake! Like some others I only used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of oil. To make up the difference in oil I used all natural applesauce, about 6 ounces. And because it was easier, Betty Crocker made the Whipped cream cheese frosting:)

Since my husband is diabetic, I used Splenda in this cake. Reduced the amount used according to the Splenda box. I could not taste the difference!.  I left out the nutmeg and added extra cinnamon, used chopped pecans. This IS an awesome carrot cake!

This was very good but I gave it 4 stars because I made a couple of changes because of others comments. I only used 1 cup of oil and it was still very moist, it didn't need any more than that. It took about 15 minutes longer to cook even with less oil. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to insure good flavor. It was almost not enough spice even with adding that. I used pineapple bits because I didn't have crushed. I used all of the frosting which gave it more flavor. My husband loved it but probably wouldn't have if I had made it as published.

I made a few modifications that is why I gave it only 4 stars. Definitely use only 1 cup of oil. I like spicier cake so I also added some pumpkin spice. This cake is so easy to make-just dump everything into the bowl and stir. This one is a keeper.

Absolutely the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I made it as the recipe called for the first time and the next time I made it with 1/2 cup coconut, and substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce.  Delicious!

Awesome frosting! The cake was pretty good too although I will make a couple changes next time. I think I will roast the nuts for more flavor. If you want to add raisins 3/4 cup is plenty. I didnt like the pineapple- if I had a food processor to smooth it out I bet it would have been better. All the guys liked it though.

Fantastic result!  I drained the pineapple and only used the smaller 8 oz. can.  I added 1 cup of flaked coconut and toasted the pecans in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 before adding to the cake batter.  I baked mine in 2 round cake pans and it was the perfect amount.  I did not use pecans in the frosting and added a squeeze of fresh lemon to cut the sweetness a bit.  Even the kids - who weren't too sure about carrot cake - loved it!

I have been making this cake for a couple of years with great success.  I normally double the recipe and bake in a 1/2 sheet cake pan. The only change I make is to increase the cooking time.  This time I needed a Gluten Free cake so I substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Flour mix for the flour and added 1 Tablespoon of Guar Gum (for a double recipe).  The cake turned out perfectly.

I love this recipe!! I made it for Easter, and it was a huge hit. They loved it, even had family ask for the recipe. I did fix it up though, I put 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of oil, still came out perfect.

I made this as the recipe says to, except I made it in two 8" pans. It took 50 minutes to cook until done and was very greasy. If I made it again, I would definitely cut back on the oil.

Delicious! I did however make some changes. Used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. I used only 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of apple sauce. Added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves. I also only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar since the carrots I used were already really sweet. I added pecans and baked in 2 8' round pans. I made a delicious cake w/ cream cheese frosting. yum!

Taste-wise, great, but...nutritious?!  Over 20 grams of fat per serving is not in any way nutritious, nor is a frosting packed with saturated fat.

This was the first carrot cake I ever made and will ever make.  It is really delicious.  I did lessen the sugar and the oil and added more cinnamon.  So easy to make and the frosting is amazing.  Thank you Tracy for this recipe.

This cake was a total hit! Everyone loved it. I made the recipe to specification the only thing I would make sure to do is not let the butter get too soft for the icing or it will be runny. Otherwise fantastic!

I attempted to make this cake and use it as a yule log (jelly roll) type cake. I put the pineapple and carrots in the blinder until smooth, and followed the rest of the recipe as written. It glued itself to the towel which led to a cracked and hard to roll cake. Once I frost it, it will be fine, but not as great as I had hoped... it's for a pot luck party. I think it was all the oil, it's just too soggy to be used as a rolled cake. I used all organic ingredients, and 1/3 wheat flour. The flavor is so-so, I prefer the box mix with the added pineapple and raisens (the deluxe recipe on the back of most boxed carrot cake mixes).

I am writing this review on the frosting only.  I used a boxed carrot cake mix and jazzed it up with pineapple, golden raisins and fresh, grated carrot, baked in a Bundt pan and halfed this frosting recipe.  The taste is so yummy.  Not too sweet, as many frostings are.  I would guess it may need a little more powdered sugar for a layer cake as mine was a little on thin side but just what I wanted for a Bundt cake!  Super frosting!!

Very disappointed. This cake is not healthy considering all the oil. I gave this an extra star because the cream cheese frosting is great (it's my staple cream cheese frosting). I can only eat this with the frosting, it's gross otherwise. Will keep searching for a great recipe.

I have a carrot cake recipe that I have been faithful to for many years. I wanted to change it up a little bit so I decided to try this recipe. It was so easy to make and the cake came out so moist and fluffy. It even baked so nice and even that I didn't have to level it out. I only made a couple of adjustments: cur the oil back to 3/4 of a cup and used my own cream cheese icing recipe. This one is my new favorite recipes! Thanks for sharing!

Over all this cake was delicious, you could not even tast the pineapple's in it. This was my first time making a carrot cake, it was really moist and pretty good. There was a little too much oil in this cake, I would cut it down to 1 cup next time.  I added 1/4 of nutmeg and a little more sugar. I added nuts to the icing and did not use as much powdered sugar as the recipe called for. My family enjoyed it alot.

This was my first attempt at carrot cake (or cake from scratch for that matter)and everyone, even those who hate carrot cake, loved this. I too substituted half of the oil with applesauce and it was so moist.

The recipes was pretty easy. I used another cream cheese icing instead of the one in the recipes. I also used 1 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil in place of the 1-1/2 cup oil that the recipes called for. Added a bit of nugmeg, and allspice from other suggestions (it was kind of overpowering). I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup, since the apple sauce was pretty sweet. I added 3/4 cups of raisin in place of the pecan (i didnt have any). Baked in 2 8-inch pans for 25 minutes. The cake is really moist, but i am having a hard time getting past the texture. I will probably make this, if there are requests from my family. mm.. just left it over night in the fridge, and it taste so much better! A keeper!

This was not good. It smelled delicious, but it took very long to bake because there was so much liquid. I'm not sure why this recipe calls for so much oil, but it must be an error. I just wish I'd read the reviews that everyone had cut down on the oil before putting it into the oven. The cake had no taste and it was very greasy which caused some tummy aches in my house. I'll be looking for another recipe because this just wasn't it.

I never had carrot cake before, but I made it for a friend's birthday. It was pretty good. My friend liked it. I used granulated sugar for the frosting. I think it would've been better if I had used confectioners' sugar. I'll try it again. The thing is that when I mixed all the ingredients, it was still very, very liquid-y(?). I added as much flour as needed to make it more dough-y. It turned out fine. You can definitely cut back on the oil. I think I used about 1/2 cup of oil. Give this recipe a try!

This was a good cake but i should have taken the other reviewers advice to not use so much oil and substitute applesauce.  It was WAY too oily for my taste, but the flavor of the cake was great.

I would rate higher than 5 stars! Excellent recipe Tracy! It was my first carrot cake, and I made it for Easter. It was a HUGE hit and when I my daughter took a couple of pieces to work she said they went "crazy" over it! I might try adding raisins and coconut next time! Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe produces a moist and dense cake.  It is the best recipe for carrot cake I have ever made.  The pineapple adds a sweetness and texture that is not overwhelming, just perfect!  I did not use the pecans (just too expensive) but the cake still came out great.

This is definitely the best carrot cake I've ever had or made.  I made it using the widely recommended 1/3 cup oil and 2/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce and it was great.  I can't imagine why you'd want to use the amount of oil in the recipe.  I also used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup Splenda to reduce the calories a bit.

I have been using allrecipes for the past couple of years and this is the first recipe that really let me down.  The oil was too much for the cake and after going further into other reviews I found that I needed to reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and add 3/4 cup applesause.  The recipie should really be changed to reflect this.  I will not be making this again.  Very dissapointed...

This carrot cake is absolutely fabulous! It's the only one I ever make. The only thing I changed was replacing the pecans in the cake with 1 cup of sweetened coconut and I omitted the pecans in the icing (we're not huge pecan fans) This cake rocks!!

Very nice cake.I did reduce the oil to 1 cup and I wish I had put less sugar( I will next time). I used some fresh pineapple because I didn't have any canned. Turned out great.....

I've been making this carrot cake for a few years, and it is always dependable and SO GOOD! I make it withough any nuts or fruit, and it makes a nice big, moist carrot cake. Spouse's job is to peel and grate carrots while I prepare the rest; saves time and my knuckles!

This is absolutely the best carrot cake I have ever eaten.  I have several friends who swore they did NOT eat carrot cake.  Once they tried it they couldn't believe how good it was.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

I thought this was only 'okay' carrot cake, primarily because I prefer a spicier, heartier cake.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  The only thing I do differently is use half brown and half white sugar.  This recipe is so easy too!!  I teach a high school cooking class and my students have made this cake for the past couple of years and it always turns out great...even the students are amazed at how good it is!

Excellent!  The cream cheese frosting seemed to be a lot of icing for me, but everyone else enjoyed it.  It was my kid's first birthday cake!  Very moist, and flavorful!  Thanx! I have made it twice.

My family really enjoyed this cake.  I thought it was pretty good (once I scraped the frosting off!)  I followed other suggestions and used 2/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup veg. oil.  It was still extremely moist.  I left out the nuts and added raisins.  The cake itself was really, really good.  The next time I make it though (and there will be a next time), I'm going to have to find a different frosting.  This one is entirely too sweet.  Even my hubby (the sugar addict) said this one was a little too sweet.  I personally liked the cake without the frosting, but to appease my family, I will find a different cream cheese frosting.  Try the cake though, it's GREAT!!!!!

Awesome indeed!  Per other reviews, I did 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce, and only 1 c sugar, and 2 t cinnamon.  It was for my son's birthday, so I omitted the nuts too, but would definitely do them next time...  It was so very moist and wonderful, everyone wanted the recipe!  It is a winner and will be a staple around here.

Has good flavoring.  I didn't have crushed pineapples, so I used 8 oz diced peaches and juice, handful of raisins, and I only used 1 cup of vegetable oil.  The cake baked for about an hour.  I was dissapointed in the heighth of the cake.  It was real big, only a couple inches tall.  Still moist, and good, just not as tall as an average cake.  Frosting was outstanding!  Had it for Easter 2005.

Really great recipe, especially since this was my first time making carrot cake. I would make a few changes, like reducing the sugar to 1 cup (the pineapple adds plenty of sweetness) and reducing the oil to 1 cup (it was plenty moist). I also chose to add toasted, sliced almonds to the top of the frosting. Oh ya, I also took another reviewer's advice to increase the cooking time (apparently the center wasn't cooked), but I wish I hadn't. My cake was a little too brown around the edges for my liking and it was plenty cooked.

This has been a staple in my recipe book for two years.  Everyone loves and requests it.  I use only about 1/2c of oil, 1/2c of applesauce and 1/4c of crushed(also put through blender) pineapple.  I also followed suggestions and added in nutmeg and allspice and sometimes I'll put in about 1/2c of raisins.  For the cream cheese frosting, I will sometimes substitute the vanilla for fresh orange juice to give a different flavor.

This truly is awesome.  As others did, I cut the oil to 3/4 cup, cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  I've never had a better carrot cake!

This is a very moist cake and very delicious.  I substituted buttermilk for half the oil, but next time will probably use even more buttermilk and less oil as the cake was still oilier (is that a word?) than I like.  The cake was also a little eggy, so next time I will try to cut an egg out also.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for half the flour and next time will probably substitute it all.  As for the frosting I use a different recipe: 2 tsp vanilla, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1/2 c butter, and (2) 8 oz bars of low-fat or fat-free cream cheese.

Great recipe! My husband devoured the cake.  I modified it a bit to make it a little more health conscious. Will definitely be making this again.

As per other suggestions (and to make it a little healthier)I cut back sugar to a little less than one cup, added 1 cup of applesauce + 1/2 cup of oil, added raisins and a heaping teaspoon of allspice.  I also added some allspice to the frosting and only used 1 cup of confectioners suger.  It was simply wonderful.  What a tasty, moist, full of good things kind of cake -- and easy to make too.  Got rave reviews at home.  I'll be using this as my carrot cake recipe from now on.

This was really good! i made a few changes as other stated. I omitted the pineapple, and the pecans. I reduced the oil to about a 3/4 cup and that was still a little too much. I added raisins. I think the frosting was the best part!! They were taking turns licking the bowl!!

Very good cake! Taste is excellent. Only gave it four stars because I need a slightly more solid cake that cuts to the perfect slice.

This was a good moist cake.  However, I like spicy carrot cakes and this one is a little on the bland side.

I tried this recipe exactly as written (except I got store bought frosting).  The cake tastes ok (not great) but it was too moist and did not setup very well.  I was tring to do a 2 layer cake with this recipe and it just didnt turn out very good.  I will not make this recipe again but I am still looking for a quality carrot cake.

This cake is excellent!!!!!  I too adjusted it just a bit.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of all the oil.  I also used half white flour and half wheat, next time I may just use all whole wheat.  I added about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I made the frosting as written but I had about 1 cup extra....if you don't want extra, I would scale it down just a little.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!!!

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to cut the oil in half; I used 3/4 c. canola oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce, and it was still moist and dee-lish, but with less fat.  Also I didn't have pecans on hand, and substituted walnuts.  This cake was wonderful, and well-received by my in-laws!  I might try adding a cup of raisins in the future--only because I tried a carrot cake with raisins in it once, and loved that too.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is exactly what a carrot cake should be!  I kept everything the same except instead of pecans I used 1 cup roasted walnut pieces.  I added 1 t. extra teaspoon cinnamon to the cake batter and 1 t. to the frosting also.  I didn't put nuts in the frosting.  Sometime, maybe I will.  I took this cake to work and had 3 request for the recipe.  One man said his wife and him are always looking for good carrot cake, and this was the best he'd every had.  Can't beat that!

Made it as a two-layer bday cake for hubby.  Modified using half a cup of oil and a couple tablespoons applesauce.  Also added coconut, allspice, nutmeg, extra cinnamon, sprinkle of ginger and cloves.  Cake was very good the first day, but slightly dry and then the second day it was moist and kept getting better and better after that.  Will try the frosting next time.  This time it was Betty Crocker Cream Cheese frosting.  (Tried both the Whipped Cream Cheese and the regular Betty Crocker Cream Cheese and the regular is better.  Whipped is not dense, flavorful and sweet enough for this cake.  FYI.)

Awesome is the word! My whole family loved this cake.  It’s a lot like the individually wrapped slices you can buy at a Quick Mart, only better. I took some suggestions from previous reviewers and substituted applesauce for some of the oil and added a little extra spice.  I think it might have been just as good without these changes, but since it’s healthier this way I will stick with this.

I took one bite of this carrot cake and threw the rest in the garbage.  There is WAY too much moisture in this cake.  If I made it again, I would use twice as much flour, 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.

I have made this and it is very moist and is the best carrot cake I have ever made. It is also very filling, so make sure you have plenty of room, I'd suggest to have it at least 3-4 hours after a meal, cause you'll want a nice good size piece.Hum-mm

Absolutely, positively delicious!!!!!
I reduced the oil to 1 cup, added 1 tsp of nutmeg and separated the egg yolks from the whites (beating the whites until stiff peaks formed and then folding them into the complete batter at the end)
Man-o-man........... I've eaten this whole thing almost in a few days!  Thank goodness I jog alot!!

The absolute best carrot cake.  I took it to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  A co-worker happened to bring in a carrot cake from a local bakery known for it's carrot cake - and this recipe beat the store bought cake hands down.  I followed the suggestions and used 1/2 the oil.  I omitted the nuts, but threw in a handful of raisins instead.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for posting it!

I just made this cake and it's nearly gone.  It is DELICIOUS.  I altered the quantities a little only put in half a cup of sugar and it really allows the other flavours of the cake to come through, added 2 teaspoons of cinammon and used walnuts as I had no pecans.  I would also use less confectioners sugar next time as I found the frosting a tad sweet but on the whole, the cake was REALLY GOOD!!!!  Make it, you won't be disappointed.

I made this a few days ago with the suggested changes to the recipe (decrease oil, sugar, etc). Took it to work and everyone was asking for the recipe! This is very good and easy to make but I suggest making maybe half of the reccomended amount of frosting. Thanks Tracy

I made this cake and took it to mom's for Thanksgiving to give people a choice instead of only pie.  Boy it was a real big hit.  It made a very thick 9x13 cake.  My husband wanted me to save a piece for home, it didn't happen!  I'll make this again soon.

This recipe is off the hook! It was so moist and tasty. I ran into a little problem because I only had 3/4 cup of oil. I used what I had and the cake didn't miss it. Also, after I put it in the oven I noticed that I left out the nuts. I didn't make the icing that goes with this recipe, but instead, I made an orange cream cheese icing and added the nuts to the icing. I made this a 3-layer cake so you really couldn't tell that the nuts were in the icing. I will definitely make this cake again. My husband hasn't tasted this yet and it is almost halfway finished!

I took this to a ladies function and was asked numerous times for the recipe. I used 2 tsp. of cinn. instead of 1; 2 tsp. vanilla instead of 1; 1/3 c. canola oil plus 2 T. applesauce instead of 1 1/2 c. veg. oil. I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg; 1/4 tsp. ginger; and 1/2 c. softened raisins (boiled in water a few seconds to soften). For the frosting, I used 2 (8 oz.) packages of cream cheese to cut down on the sweet. Perfect!

this cake was extremely moist and yummy.  i was impressed with the lightness and flufiness of the frosting, it was delicious.  i added a bit of sweetened coconut flakes to the cake batter and substitued walnuts for pecans.  i would definitely make this again, everyone loved it.

I made this cake on two occassions.  The first time I made it as indicated  but I thought it could use a little more seasoning.  The second time I added 1 tsp Nutmeg and 1 tsp ground cloves.  The added spice made it much more interesting.  A great cake!  (WHy pay $26 when you can make it better for under $5)

This cake was wonderful.  I used applesauce instead of the oil the recipe called for and it was GREAT.  I think next time I will only use 1 cup of applesauce instead of 1 & 1/2 like it says. The cake was REAL moist.  I also used shredded carrots and put them in my food processor until they were "grated" consistency. This cake is easy to make and the icing is too good for words.  I am sure this will be asked for a whole lot in my house.  Thanks for the recipe Tracy!!

This recipe put me on top of the A-list!!!  My husband loved it.  He just kept saying, "mmmmm, this is good!!" while chewing.  I did not put any nuts in it and I did not make the icing because I thought it would be too sweet.  Everyone still raves about it!! I gave some to my sister and Mom with instructions to give some to my Dad.  Needless-to-say, my Dad never received it.  They ate his sample as well.  That was enough proof that this cake was to die for!!  I brought some to work for some of my coworkers and they could not beleive that I had made it.  Thanks Tracy :)

OUTSTANDING RECIPE!  Many of my friends love carrot cake and they raved over this one.  I used 4 cups of Dole's sliced carrots for ease and convenience, as well as, I cut the oil back to 1/2 cup.  Excellent recipe.  This is a keeper!

I couldn't believe how many raves I got for this recipe! I brought it to work for a potluck dessert, and, well, thank goodness Allrecipes.com has an e-mail feature, or I would have been writing down the recipes for a LOT of people!

I did cut the amount of oil in half, and it was still delicious and moist. I will definitely be making this the next time I need to please a crowd!

This cake came out so good.  I needed to cook it for the full 40 minutes and only cooked it for 33 minutes because it looked like it was getting pretty dark.  Next time I am going to make these cupcake style for individual servings...jumbo of course!

Wow! This cake was delicious! It was extremely moist.  I was afraid at first that it wouldn't turn out because the batter was so thin when I put it in the oven, but it turned out great!! I took it to an Easter party and it was a big hit!

I really enjoyed making this recipe.  I took the advice from several reviews and it turned out fantastic!!!  I only used approx.1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup applesauce (as oil replacement).  I took the advice from others to drain the pineapple.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  As well, I replaced the nuts with raisins (reduced the sugar to 1 c)and topped with toasted pecans and coconut.
YUMMY.  I will definately make this again.

As per past reviews, I used 1 cup of oil, and less powdered sugar for frosting than the recipe lists.  I also added 3/4 cup of raisins.  This cake is decadent.  Very moist, dense, really delicious.  Thank you for this recipe Tracy.  Angela

Awesome is correct.  This recipe is excellent.  I used half the confectioner's sugar the recipe called for on the frosting and it still was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipes.

This carrot cake is sooooooo delicious!!!  This is my new favorite carrot cake recipe.  I cut back on the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 cup water to make up for the liquid difference.  I also added about 3 ounces more pineapple, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  It turned out wonderfully!  I baked it in 2 9-inch round pans and made a double layer birthday cake for my Dad.  I didn't put the nuts in the frosting, and just sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top, instead.  I also only used approximately 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting.  Next time I'll lessen the butter also.  Everyone loved it.

I love carrot cake.  So when I was looking for a recipe I want to make sure I get the one that works.  I tried this recipe yesterday and it turns out better than I ever expected.  As suggested by earlier reviewer I cut down the oil to 1 cup, 1 1/2 cup sugar add 1 cup of walnuts, 1/2 cup raisins.  Drain the pineapple.  As for the toping I lessen the butter and 1 1/2 cup of confectioner/s sugar.  It comes out very well and not too sweet.  I recommend this recipe anytime!  Thank you for sharing Tracy.

We had a hard time trying to get it to cook evenly all the way through.  Next time we'll try making muffins.  And like everyone else has said, only make HALF the frosting-- even that's too much!  And the frosting is very sweet.  That was fine for us, but beware.  The cake itself is very good though.

This is seriously THE BEST carrot cake. My grandmother used to make a wonderful carrot cake and when she passed away nobody in the family was able to find the recipe. Everyone says that this is the closest anyone has come to perfecting "grandma's recipe" I have made it twice now and there is never a crumb left. It is absolutely marvelous. I followed other people's suggestions and only used one cup oil. This recipe has officially replaced Grandma's recipe and I will continue to make it for years to come.
Thanks Tracy

This cake is fantastic!  I sent the remaining portion to my husband's place of employment and they "raved" about it.  I was told it was better than the carrot cake from a very prominent bakery nearby!  Now every time they have a function, they request this cake!  I did have to bake it longer than the time mentioned...probably about 50 min. or more...and my oven temp. is accurate...really yummmmmmmy!  Thanks!

Oh, my gosh!!!  The BEST carrot cake I have ever eaten.  I reduced the oil to 1 cup and it is plenty.  I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsps.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he adored it!  We (the two of us) ate 1/2 of it in 2 days!  I would have finished it off in one day if my stomach and waistline would allow it!!!
You MUST make this recipe, I had to grate the carrots by hand but it was soooooooo worth it!

This recipe is awesome!! My husband loves carrot cake for his birthday and this one was a huge success. I shared it with co-workers and now they are asking for the recipe. I used egg substitute and cut the oil to 1 cup to decrease fat and cholesterol and it was great. It did require a little more than 30 minutes to bake, but it is worth it!!

This recipe is pretty easy to make. The one problem was with the amount of time to cook the cake. I kept it in my over for 45 minutes and the center still didn't cook all the way. I will try it again because the frosting was heavenly and it was easy considering I'm still sort of a novice at cooking.

I turned this into a cupcake recipe and got 36 yummy, moist cupcakes. I decreased the baking time to 25 minutes and it worked great. I'm making it again later this week and I'm going to try the suggestion regarding cutting the oil. Great cake!

It is a delicious and easy cake to make. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe.
I cut back on the sugar for the cake and the frosting.
I didn’t have applesauce so I added more olive oil making it 1/2 cup instead of the 1/4 cup.
I had to make conversions for the 8 ounce  pineapple to 1cup as I am in Australia.
Thank you for the great recipe.

I made a few changes such as changed cream to cream cheese, not the one they had as well as raisins . But, over all we were very pleased. It was my first time to make a cake from scratch and it came out fantastic.  Now I'm in trouble because my wife expects it more often.  And before this I had a hard time making scrambled eggs.

I’m guessing this recipe has been edited since so many reviews complained about too much oil. I made exactly to the recipe (only  1/4 cup of oil) and it was deliciously moist. The frosting was not overly sweet.  I will make this again.

Its good, the frosting makes up the cake so the batter might need something else in it. I'm not too eager to try other recipes though because this one is still good. I might try the one that calls for buttermilk (on this website) someday. Make sure your cream cheese sits out for a few hours at room temperature and cake batter will be a little runny cause of the apple sauce, pineapples etc.

My ten year old made this carrot cake today.  He followed the recipe on the video without the nuts (3/4 oil, can of pineapple + juice)  and reduced the sugar to 1 cup as recommended in another review.  The carrot cake was phenomenal.  We used the KitchenAid shredder attachment for the carrots and it worked perfectly.  We also used our KitchenAid to mix the ingredients.  This will be our go to baked item from now on.  So delicious!

Excecllent and easy to make. The family loves this cake.  The pineapple doesn't overpower, in fact it adds sweetness and moisture and if I didn't tell them it was in there, they would not have known.

I increased the recipe by half (i.e. 4.5 c grated carrots, etc.) as I wanted to use two 9" x 2" round baking pans to make a layer cake.  I drained the pineapple (14 oz can) and used half of the liquid rather than all of it, threw in about 1/2 c raisins, used half brown and half white sugar rather than all white, and cut the amount of sugar in the icing by half.  I'd suggest lining the bottom of the pans with parchment paper as the cakes were hard to get out of the greased&floured pans without breaking.   It turned out wonderfully - one of the best carrot cakes I've had.

Have been making this cake for years ( maybe 10 times a year) and wonder why anyone would have to use a mixer to blend the ingredients of the cake part?  Also do substitute 2/3 of the oil for unsweetened applesauce with a better texture cake.

Have made this multiple times. Especially an Easter staple now. I use a different cream cheese frosting but this cake cannot be beat. My dad, husband, father in law, everyone insists on this. I do it in two 9 inch and stack.

worked well when I followed the recommendations from others in the forum and reduced the oil & sugar content but it did take longer to bake than the 40 mins recommended. I haven't baked with applesauce before but was impressed with the result. I substituted 3/4 cup apple sauce for 3/4 cup of the 11/2 cups oil in the original recipe & reduced the sugar to 1 cup

Very moist cake and the frosting is delicious. I got rave reviews when I baked it for a friends birthday party.  He loves carrot cake and  thought this was one of the best that he had ever eaten.

My favorite recipe for my favorite cake.  As others have done I subbed 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 1/2 cups of oil.  I think we do this out of habit, but it's a healthy habit and  this cake didn't suffer for it.

I used the ingredients exactly as written. The only thing I changed was the technique. After reading many reviews with people reporting that the cake was oily, I did something different. With my hand-held blender, I whipped the eggs until light yellow and frothy. Then with the blender still running I added the oil in very small increments (roughly a tablespoon at a time) beating well after each addition. The egg/oil combination became a thin mayonnaise.  The finished product was not oily at all because the oil was emulsified. I added the carrots to the wet ingredients instead of the dry. I baked the cake in a bundt pan for 55 minutes. The finished cake, with the icing, was absolutely delicious! I gave it 4 stars because it needs a little more spice. Next time I make this I'm going to triple the cinnamon and add more vanilla. I may add some maple extract, too. I love this cake. As others have noted, it is better the next day.

I remember first making this cake back in 2005. This is the ONLY recipe i use. I've tinkered  with it throughout the years. From adding more sugar, more pineapples, more carrots, 1/2 wheat 1/2 white and it always turns out delicious. I only use 3/4 cup of oil, 1/2 might do but I have never tried that. It gets 5 stars because other than the oil it is a really awesome recipe.  I've used cream cheese and Neufchatel cheese and I think the frosting tastes better with cream cheese although the other way is good as well. I recommend sifting the flour 2 or 3 times. King Arthur Flour seems to make it a better tasting cake although i have not made two at the same time to compare, It just seems to be less dense. I have recently started tinkering with the time and temperature. 325 degrees for 50-55 minutes has worked well. This seems to keep the edges from "overbaking"

A few years ago I ate this dessert in a pizza restaurant in Brighton Ontario.
Since that day , I tested several recipes if there was like that .
Until today I did this recipe.
It was so good, very delicious !!!  Finally I found the recipe of this dessert that fascinates me and now I can eat anytime. Thanks!!!!
I read the reviews and the only changes I made were: 3/4 cup of oil , 1/2 cup of coconut, and drain the juice off pineapple.  And instead of pecans I put almonds.

I did make a few chances and took a lot of advice for others that had made it.

I used a half cup of oil..
I used 4 table spoon of floor because it was still a lil running for me..
 The frosting I use 16oz of cream cheese and one cup of soft butter. I shift the 3 cups of power sugar.
The reason I used 16oz cream cheese and not the 8 oz is because I made to.
Also I used 8 in pan.

But my husband love it... I personally do not like carrot cake. But if he like it then it most be really good ????

I tried making this recipe bc of the great reveiws. I definitely should have read the reveiws FIRST bc most of them have altered the recipe to make it edible. As it is written, there is waaay too much oil. My baked for an hour plus and is still like soup except that most of it has exploded over the edge of the pan to make a soupy mess all over my oven. Really disappointed in this recipe.

I didn't change the recipe while I was making it,but when ready to put into cake pan,I didn't like how runny it was so added 1/2 cup of flour,like other reviewers I cut back on the sugar in the frosting. I didn't read the reviews before making, maybe the xtra flour fixed the oily texure. I didn't have crushed pineapple,used pineapple rings chopped up and about 1/4 cup of the juice
I had to cook it a little over a hour(I live at high altitude)to get a solid cake. I liked it,maybe I'll over do it next time and add some raisins

My boyfriend had been begging me for weeks to make him a carrot cake w/cream cheese icing from scratch. Mind you, I cook a lot of dinners, but have never been much of a bake from scratch kind of gal. But then I found this recipe and thought it looked easy enough so I decided to give it a shot. Even my bf wasn't excepting it to be perfect the first time, he just wanted me to try, BUT it came out SO freaking good. He was in love, the kids were in love, and I myself was in love with this cake. I know a lot of the other reviewers thought it was TOO oily and moist, but we thought it was just right. Maybe it's just a matter of preference, maybe I just got lucky, but , that was some good cake! I'm making another one to bring to a party tonight, we'll see if it's as big of a hit for my friends as it was for my family!

This really is an Awesome carrot cake! Someone at my work made this cake and I thought it was so good that I asked her for the recipe and thats how I found out about this site. I was so excited to make a cake from scratch for the first time instead of using a box. It was easy and turned out great everyone loves this cake! I made the frosting one time but it is super sweet so I just buy the already made tub of cream cheese frosting and its cheaper.

Made the carrot cake exactly as recipe calls for. Like other reviewers stated, way too much oil. It was definately moist, but you could see  the oil on the bottom of the glass dish! Not enough spices either, couldnt taste any! Hubby liked this only because of the thick layer of cream cheese frosting ( didnt use this recipes frosting but used "Cream Cheese Frosting II)- its excellent. As for the carrot cake, I will be trying another recipe.

I was looking for a c.c. recipe with pineapple and without coconut and raisins. This is a keeper! Yes, there is a high sugar and oil content, but this can be adjusted if necessary with applesauce for some of the oil. This cake is very moist, which is great! The only change I made was to omit the nuts in the frosting--there were enough in the cake itself. Great recipe!

This recipe is great!! We found this to be a very tasty & easy. We also agree that it might taste quite good with the applesauce instead of the oil and perhaps raisins. However, this time we followed the recipe and it can stand as is!!

This cake is so moist and delicious! The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because I had to reduce the oil otherwise it would have been way too greasy.

Made this as written and found it to be very oily.  I still thought it was good, very tasty.  It can be improved, though.  I am going to try some of the suggestions.

I enjoy making this.  I do not like carrot cakes but I will eat this one.  I use fresh carrots and fresh pinapples.  I love it.

I made this for Father's Day and even the nondesert folks ate it up.  I did do the recommended exchanging the 2 cups white for 1 of each - white and brown, added the 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, using 2 t of cinnamon, and adding another spoon of vanilla.  I'm stuck making it again next week but it's worth it!

The flavor is great. I did wonder why so many people change a recipe before they tried it as written. I didn't expect it to be health food; just a moist carrot cake. This cake is indeed moist, but upon sitting on a paper plate for a day, (kept some and sent the rest with the birthday girl) quite a bit of oil was on the plate. That makes me believe that the cake may have a bit too much oil so next time I make it-and there will be a next time-I will try a little less oil (maybe try just one cup instead of one and a half) to see how that works. I turned the cake upside down to frost and found the amount of frosting to work great. This is the first carrot cake I have ever made but it won't be my last! Thanks!

Too much oil! I (foolishly) didn't read the reviews because it had near perfect ratings. My daughter was the one who scrolled down and asked if I had read the reviews about the oil- right after I dumped the oil in the batter! The cake really tasted oily and it would've been just great with HALF the oil.

I get the best compliments on this carrot cake and I've been making in for a few years now.  Even my friend who is really picky said it was close to the best he's ever had!  I use half of the cream cheese frosting because it's too strong with the whole recipe, but this is seriously awesome!

I used store-bought cream cheese frosting, and that made it a little sweeter than I like, but the cake itself was perfect. 

I was a little skeptical about adding the crushed pineapple, but I think it makes it extra moist...and you can't even taste the fruit in the final product. Definitely will make again.

Awesome!  This cake is not too sweet and very moist. Nothing like a one bowl recipe;  very simple to make.  I added a 1/2 cup of raisins for good measure.

I read a lot of reviews before I made this cake.
I reduced the oil and added applesauce as some people suggested it. I also reduced the sugar to about 350g which was more than enough. The batter was VERY liquid and I was worried that I've done something wrong. I left out the pineapples because it seemed kind of weird. After I baked the cake for 40 mins. it was STILL totally liquid inside, it took about an hour for it to be done. It didn't rise much but the cake itself tasted very good.
For the frosting I reduced the sugar to around 200g because the cake itself was already pretty sweet and I didn't want too much sugar in it. 
The cake is tasty but it is VERY heavy and moist, I will try some other recipes and see if they are any better.

I have been using this recipe for a few yeras now. It comes out great everytime.  I made it again last week but I cut the recipe in half (serving 12) and baked it in a glass 8X8 baking dish. It was perfect.  Someone even said "it was the best carrot cake they have ever eaten":)

Everyone loved it, it was delicious. The batter was very liquidy though and I had to bake it for a very long time at low heat to get it cooked all the way through the middle but not burn it.

Pretty darn good I'd say...a lil wetter than I would like though. I followed some of the others advice and used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil. Maybe that's why it was so wet? Anyways the flavor was awesome and I'm pretty sure none of it will go to waste ;)

Very easy to make, great taste and texture.  I cut the recipe (only had 2 cups of grated carrots)to only make 2/3 of the batter.  I used a 9x9 cake pan and it came out just fine.  I didn't make the frosting but will probably try it next time.

Awesome recipe...everyone I make it for loves it.  However, the icing could be a bit thicker...it's a little on the runny side, making presentation a little tough.

This is by far the most requested dish people ask me to bring to any function! I usually double the icing recipe figuring if you are going to eat carrot cake, which is one of the highest caloric desserts made, you may as well make it great.

I grated a whole pound bag of carrots, added approx 1/2 cup raisens to compensate for the additional moisture and added a few grates of nutmeg for added flavor. Otherwise, all was according to the recipe.  Baked for 45 mintutes and it's perfect. Simplest carrot cake recipe I've found.  Thanks for sharing.

Just perfect!  Made it today for lunch and it disappeared!  People were actually asking who had made it.  I didn't change a thing, except adding 1 tsp more cinammon.

I tried this recipe because my husband doesn't like my favorite recipe with raisins and coconut.  This cake was wonderful!  My 5 year old loved it too!!  I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe, and the cake was superb!!

I would love to give this recipe 5 stars but I changed a few ingredients.  
I made this cake for my husbands birthday I substituted walnuts instead of pecans (that's what he likes),plus added a hint of Allspice. It was extremely moist and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  I've made this cake twice now - once with the full amount of oil and once with just one cup.  Reducing the oil made for a much lighter and less greasy cake.  Because of a family member's need to avoid nuts, I haven't made the cake with pecans - nevertheless, it turned out very well.  I did add about a half tablespoon of the juice from the pineapple to the cream cheese frosting for additional flavor.

I made this recipe for Easter when I was unable to find my old stand by cookbook. It was definitely a crowd pleaser. I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from this site instead of the one listed.

fabulous outcome, though even after cutting down sugar to half of what the recipe called for i still found out it to be a little too sweet for my taste. next time i'll reduce the sugar into hald for the frosting too!

Everyone loved it! Used suggestions from other reviews - added more spices & cinnamon, 1/2 cup oil with 3/4 cup applesauce - definitely needed to bake about 10 minutes longer than stated. Used 2 round cakes as suggested to use some of the frosting. Turned out perfect! Was surprised when I put it on a plate to feel how heavy it was!

Awesome! I left out the pecans and did 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup oil. I just couldn't put all that oil in it. It turned out really moist and delicious. Next time, I'll probably just use 1 cup of applesauce and no oil. Oh, and beware, because it makes A LOT of frosting (at least for my taste)Really good overall!

This is the first time I ever made a carrot cake. I used coconut in place of the nuts, and 3/4 c. oil and 1 c. sugar as suggested. It definitely came out moist enough without sticking, and it was very good. My family raved over it, but I was a little disappointed. Something was missing. I don't know if maybe it needed the sugar I took out, or what it was, but everyone else loved it. Still pretty good. I used cream cheese frosting II instead of the one that was listed.

The cake was really good except that I tried to bake it in two 8 inch pans and after 40 minutes and the tops browing quite a bit they still weren't done in the middle. I was able to use the pieces from the outsides and they were very good though. Next time I'll stick to the 9x13 inch pan

I followed others suggestions and cut back the oil to 1 cup and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  The cake was okay.  It didn't "wow" me like I thought it would.  I think raisins and more spices would be good additions.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was very good, I will make it again for sure! I made a bundt cake, and I only used about half of the frosting... it was perfect. I couldn't imagine using all that frosting. I also had to eliminate the pecans because my dad can't eat them. I was bummed about that. I can only imagine how this tastes when you add the pecans!!!

This cake turned out great. I made it for Easter and everyone loved it! I used 3/4c oil and it was perfect, not too oily. The frosting was great even though I thought it was going to be too sweet. I actually made two cakes, one with pecans and one without-I think the one with pecans was so much better! I will definetely make again!

I made this for the first time for my annual Easter get together.  My family loved this carrot cake.  I made them into cupcakes and added a teaspoon more of cinnamon and it turned out wonderful. I did not think this cake was too moist.  It gets better each day it sits in the fridge.  I also used cream cheese in the frosting and it was sinfully good!!  I will definitely make this every year!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Lesson I learned this past Easter weekend...It is SO important to read the reviews of other cooks! 

I made the cake batter and then made cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was good, but there was a ring of oil everywhere I put the cupcakes. 

Next time, I will follow the suggestions of others and use 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup applesauce.

YUM! YUM! YUM!!!!  What a fantastic recipe!! I followed some of the other suggestions and only used 3/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. of apple sauce.  I think I used 5 carrots (just ran them through the food processor) and eliminated the walnuts and pineapple (not fans of either).  It came out delicious!!!  I can't wait to make this for a crowd!

too moist to frost effectively; frosting seemed too thin to me; haven't tried it yet, however.

The title says it all!!  This is a WONDERFUL cake! It gets even better the next day... and the next.  This recipe makes too much frosting.  I probably cut the frosting in half next time.

If you like carrot cake, you'll love the way this will turn out! The only thing is that I don't believe you need as much oil as the recipe calls for.  It comes out a bit too oily and with all the other ingredients like the pineapples, etc., you really dont need the added moisture from the oil.

I didn't have enough carrots so I used half zucchini.  I also used 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup olive oil.  I also didn't put pecans in the frosting.  The name of this recipe says it all.

This recipe turned out terrific!!!  I used walnuts instead of pecans and no nuts in the frosting.  You can also save out some of the frosting to add food coloring and decorate with little carrots!  This is the best carrot cake recipe I've tried.

Cake uses oil instead of butter so its very dense, not fluffy. However, it is very palette pleasing! Easy to make and turns out beautifully. Great recipe!

Awesome is right!We love carrot cake & we love cream cheese icing!
Changed a few things....3/4 cups of sugar instead of 2C. 1 cup olive oil & 1/2 cup vegie oil(I will try 1 C. olive oil next time & leave out the vegie oil)I also added a few raisins a little coconut & walnuts instead of pecans.
Will definately make again :)

This cake is so moist!!!  It has an amazing taste, I never even liked carrot cake before.  Now it's my favorite.  I made this for work, all guys who never eat "stuff like that", and they didn't even want to let me have a taste.  The each had 3 peices, and demanded i make it again.  I wouldn't change anything in this recipe.

I made this dessert for Easter. It was fabulous! My whole family loved it. It was very moist and tasty. I put the pecans on the top instead of IN the icing. Delicious! It is heavy so a little piece goes a long way. The leftovers are just as fresh days later. I will definately make this again.

This cake was delicious!  I made it for Easter 2005 and everyone loved it!  The cake was the first dessert gone..and even picky eaters, who usually dislike cream cheese frosting, raved over how delicious it was!  I got several requests (from my husband, sister and brother-in-law) to make this for their birthdays!  I didn't have any pecans, and the cake still turned out great!  Thank you!

I made THIS recipe because I wanted to use a 9x13 pan.  It was good BUT it is NOT good for you and it takes about 60 minutes to bake (20 minutes LONGER than recipe states).  Notwithstanding, everyone raved over it and then went home and doubled-up on their cholesterol medicine.

It's a winner..need to make some changes.  There's definately too much sugar. 1 cup is enough but I added 1/2 cup of raisins. I made half the amount frosting.confectioner's sugar to 4 oz of cream cheese.

This cake certainly lives up to its name. It has a classic carrot cake texture - moist and crumbly, not dry and cake-like. It's really dense, too. It's the heaviest cake I've made, so you may not need to serve large portions. I also tried it with a cup of raisins, which makes it even better. The cream cheese frosting is great as well. Although it was my first time baking it, I got the ultimate compliment from an acquiantance: "You should be a professional baker!" Try it, your family and friends will appreciate it - guranteed!

I made this cake cutting the oil to 1 1/4 cup and using walnuts instead of the pecans.  It was the best carrot cake my wife and I have ever tasted.  The frosting was excellent as well.

First of all, the flavor was excellent! I was impressed. I did not read the reviews first, and maybe should have. I followed the recipe exactly and noticed that the cake was too moist. The center basically collapsed. I just kept those pieces for myself and gave the rest away. Everyone loved it! The next time I will try using less oil as some have suggested.

I think this turned out great, i made a few change's as per some of the suggestions others had made. I followed the recipe with everything else, but i only used 1 and 1/2 cups of white sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2cup of apple sauce, 1tsp of nutmeg, also i only used 3/4cup of vegetable oil. I think next time I may try a little all spice. It turned out great everyone loved it even my brother and uncle who doesn't like sweets really enjoyed this recipe. I  found another keeper on this great site.

I did not read other's reviews before making it.  Big mistake.  The cake was too moist with way too much oil.  No cinnamon taste at all.

I made this cake for my husband's 30th b-day dinner.  I followed the recipe as written except for the nuts (allergies).  He and the rest of the family loved it so much he said I should write a review.

This cake truly is awesome! It's quite moist and dense, with a very distinct taste. I left out the nuts for my family's preference. I've also subbed applesauce for some of the oil with very good results.

A delicious carrot cake.  I chose to make this as a somewhat healthy birthday cake for my daughter's 1st birthday. I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar instead of 2 cups and also olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It turned out very moist and was extremely easy and quick to make - besides grating the carrots.  Might half the frosting recipe, as it makes quite a bit, but I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This is an amazing cake.  I am planning on baking this for my daughter's first birthday.  I put whole wheat flour instead of white and accidentally put in twice the amount of pineapple.  The bake time needed an extra 10-15 minutes because of the extra liquid, but it still came out delicious.

This was wonderful!!!  Like others I cut the oil to 3/4 cups and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added some ginger and only used pecans in the mix.  Everyone who has tried it says it is the best carrot cake they have ever had.  Thank you!!!

Cake tested real good, but it uses too much oil.  I read the reviews AFTER I made the cake and was sad that I did not read them BEFORE becasue I would have reduced the oil/sugar.  It also took at least one hour to cook, not 30-40 as recipe indicated.

This was, hands down, the best carrot cake I have ever made (or tasted).  It was easy, moist and wonderful!  All the other recipes I have made say to drain the pineapple juice...but leaving it in works great!

I made 24 muffins (cooked for 30 minutes) instead of using a 9x13 pan, and substituted raisins & cranberries for the nuts.

I will make this again and again.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to make and very fragrant.  (Note: Be sure to decrease the oil to 3/4 cup.  The cake will still turn out quite moist.)

DIVINE.  Delicious, very moist, flavourful and oh-so very satisfying.  I may cut some of the oil next time (just a bit) or sub for some apple sauce, since it is a lot of oil.  But it is the best carrot cake I have ever eaten or made myself.  I made my own cream cheese frosting and I subbed walnuts for pecans because that's all I had.  Thank you Tracy!  This was a hit with my family!

Woops -- I needed to add to my review that this recipe does call for far too much oil for my taste and I always reduce the amount by at least 3/4 cup and usually substitute applesauce.  Yum!

Great, great cake.  I made a couple of modifications - sub'd 1/2c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil, omitted the pineapple and used walnuts in place of pecans.  Really moist and tasty!  I had to turn the heat down about 25 minutes through bake time and bake another 10-15 at 325 - the edges got a bit crispy before the middle was done.  I also sprinkled walnuts on top of the cake instead of stirring them through the icing.  Made for a very pretty cake!

This rating is for the frosting - I used it on the Best Carrot Cake Ever recipe and my boyfriend and I felt that the frosting made the cake!  Love how creamy - but light it is (the key is the light cream cheese).  Very easy to work with!  I will certainly make it again!

Amazing cake!  Perfect results if you use an accurate oven thermometer.
I make this recipe as-is and it's always a crowd-pleaser.
If you'd like to rave about how you substituted applesause for some of the oil, or okra for the pecans, or maybe cayenne pepper for the cinnamon, PLEASE POST IT AS A DIFFERENT RECIPE!  It's not THIS one!
Please show some respect for the person who submitted this and rightfully takes pride in it!

This is a fabulous, healthy (even though it doesn't taste like it) and easy cake.  It requires just enough skill to give you a real sense of accomplishment when it's done.  Especially if you use two 9" round cake pans to make a layer cake instead of the 9 x 13.  This recipe couldn't be better!

Trcy, We love your carrot cake. It didn't last long the first time we baked it (or even the second time). We however, added 1/2 cup whitgerm and cut down on the oil by 1/2 cup. Five stars for you! Thank you!

This was an "ok" carrot cake, My husband loved it,  To me the cake needed a little more "spice" to it.  I did use 1/2 of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  All that oil would have made it to oily.  Next time I will add some more cinnamon and a lot less powdered sugar to the cream cheese frosting.  If you like it sweet use the amount of powdered sugar listed but if you don't like sweet frosting cut back on the sugar.  The cake has enough.*****I am changing my review this cake was better the next day out of the fridge,  my first bite of it was after it came from the oven BUT it is so good the next day.  The frosting actually turned out great :)

Very good!  I adapted this recipe according to a few other reviews.  Cut sugar to 1 1/2 c.; cut oil to 1/2 c.; added 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1/4 t. ginger; used 1/2 c. pecans in cake and 1/2 c. on frosting; used 1 1/2 cans of frosting to frost top only as I was feeling lazy.  Made this for Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed it.

Absolutely incredible.  I have made this recipe before and my husband took the cake to work.  His coworkers have begged me to make it again.  They said it was the best carrot cake they have ever had.  I also agree with adding a little more cinnamon and cutting back on the vegetable oil a bit.  Definitely the best carrot cake ever.

This is a cake I have made numerous times. My mom's coworkers always ask her to bring it (which means me to make it) in all the time. The only thing I do differently is add the oil last (I generally use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup). I have also experimented with different cream cheese icings-all have still tasted excellent with the cake.

Made as written with one substitution of 1C zucchini for 1C carrots.  A huge hit with my family.  Granddaughter finally got "enough" frosting.  Only served 15 as after tasting, pieces cut were enormous.  Will try using less oil next time.

Awesome cake!  I reduced the oil and sugar as suggested in the reviews and included the juice from the pineapple.  Now what I did do different was add COOKED carrots, not raw!  It simplified the whole process even more and it turned out delicious.  I made 12 jumbo muffins and an 8 x 8 cake pan.  I also reduced the icing sugar in the frosting.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Came out really awsome, as the name says. Although, I wish I had a more "carroty" falvor, than the pineapple flavor. I cut down the oil, and also the pineapple juice.. because the batter looked very liquidy. Also, there was no baking soda available, so I had to make do with more baking powder. But next time, I would like to give it a try with baking soda, as per the recipe, and see the difference. I also recommed increasing the vanilla extract just a wee bit, for people who dont like the "eggy" flavor in their cakes.. otherwise, I am just waiting to make it again!!

I just made the cream cheese frosting from this recipe and found it to be very rich and creamy!
It makes more than enough to cover a 9x13 pan.
I think the butter adds the perfect touch!

i made cupcakes with the batter and they turned out yummy.  I also cut the oil to 1 cup, and when I make it again, would probably cut the oil down even more.  For the frosting, I used cream cheese and used less sugar.

I only used 1 cup of oil, added 3/4 of shredded coconut, and used 1 3/4 of powdered sugar in the frosting.  PERFECT!  Great cake, made it for Mother's Day and everyone enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was the most amazing carrot cake i've ever eaten!!! The topping was a bit sweet for me so the second time I used 3/4 cup less sugar. It turned out great! My boyfriends dad loved it, so it got me in good with him. Thanks so much!

I've had a craving for carrot cake for quite some time, and this definitely hit the spot! I decided to follow the original recipe and was very pleased.  After frosting the cake, I put it in the refrigerator to chill for the day!  It was absolutely yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe certainly deserves its name! I made this for my office and it got me in tight with my boss. He even took a few pieces home to his wife and kids and they can't stop raving about it!

Good recipe but it's too wet.  I followed the basics but added nutmeg and coriander.  I would try it again reducing the oil to 1 cup and using 2 instead of 4 eggs, also drain some of the pineapple juice and add coconut.  Baking time for recipe needed to be increased by about 20-30 minutes.

This recipe had a wonderful flavor but my only concern was adding 1 1/2 cups of oil.  I think this must have been a typeo.  The next time I try this recipe, I will probably cut the oil in half.

Although others suggested changes, I decided to make it as written.  Excellent!  Everyone at work loved it, and several commented how good the frosting was.  I've had better, but not by much.  Quickness rating would have been a 5, except for having to grate the carrots... I need a food processor...

Mmmm...this was good.  Reduced the oil to 1/2 cup; made up the difference with applesauce and liberal amounts of pineapple juice.  Added quite a bit of raisins and some cardamon, just to be different.  The baking time seems to be the same.  The most difficult part of this recipe is grating those carrots!

My family loved the texture of this cake.  I followed previous tips and cut back on the oil and drained the pineapple.  I also used a different frosting.  Has anyone tried this in a different size pan?

"Awesome" says it all.  I tried this recipe for friends and now I'm known as the "Carrot Cake Queen".  I too cut down on the oil, added raisins and "just because", I threw in 2 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips.  The phrase I heard most often?  "To die for!"

Wow!  This is one yummy cake.  I cut the oil back to a little less than a cup and added another 2 or 3 ounces of the crushed pineapple and it turned out just perfect.  The kids even loved it (because I didn't put the nuts in the frosting). Thank you, thank you!  This one is a keeper.

Excellent!!!  My husband and 8 y/o son made this cake for a Cub Scout Father and Son Cake Auction, it took 2nd highest bid!!!  We had a little extra batter, so we made ourselves a tiny little cake to try and it was excellent.  I had read the previous reviews and we did cut the oil down to 1 cup and drained the pineapple, this is truly an awesome cake.  My son is already asking, "when can we make it to keep at home?"  Great recipe!!

I did make some changes, but the result was still fabulous.  This turned out moist and delicious.  I did cut the oil to 1 cup and did not add any of the pinapple juice, I am sure it is very good with it, but I am allergic.  I will make this again and again and again.

I have a Kitchenaid mixer with the grater attachment and I could not believe how easy this was!  If you have a good grater this recipe is for you!  Very yummy and moist.  Oh!  If you plan on just frosting the top, reduce the amount of frosting you make.

This cake is too wet and it took a long time to bake (1hr and 5 mins). I should have reduced the pineapple juices from the recipe. Reduced sugar content if you're adding in rasins. 3/4 oil is enough as recommeded by the others. I will bake this cake again by not adding so much juices!

I scaled this recipe down to make a smaller cake, now I wished I hadn't. I did read the reviews before I made it, so I cut back the oil.  I also cut back the icing sugar in the icing to make it less sweet.  It was very tasty!  My kids and husband want me to make it again, if I hadn't scaled it back I wouldn't have to make it so soon.  I also cut it in half and made a layer cake with it, it seemed to be a little on the flat side, next time I will add a little more baking powder.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought this recipe was delicious as did my 1 year old daughter.  I made cupcakes instead of a cake and had WAY too much frosting left over but this is definitely something I'll make again.

Best Carrot Cake ever!  I've made it three times in two weeks and have gotten rave reviews from even the best of chefs.  I agree about reducing the oil to 1 cup, and increasing the amount of cinnamon.  Also, I left out the nuts, added raisins and thinly sliced apples.  A big hit and hard to screw up!

Look out...the batter is very wet.  I used only 3/4 cup oil and it's still moist!  It took a lot longer than 30 minutes to bake.  The cake tastes good, but kind of boring.  I need to figure out what to add to it to give it a kick.  I used 3 cups sugar for the frosting...it's a little too grainy, but the flavor compliments the cake nicely.

This is a very delicious recipe however to oily.  The next time I make it I will take the advice of many other reviews. 
1) Put less Oil
2) It needs a little more carrots
3) And less pineapple
4) Add raisins
and it takes a little longer to cook.  Approx. 45 minutes before it's ready!

I made this for my husband's birthday party and he loved it!!  It took a little time to grate the peel and grate the carrots, so I will use a food processor next time.  After reading the reviews, I too used only 1 cup of oil, and it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe

This was a great recipe... I felt it was lacking raisins though... I might add that next time... or possibly more pinapple.  I made it into cupcakes instead of a pan-cake so I could distribuite them at work for Halloween and everyone LOVED them!

This is hands down the BEST carrot cake we have ever had.  In fact, I have shared this recipe with more than a few friends.  It was served at a friend's party and got rave reviews.  Also, the recipe is easy to follow.  My 2 1/2 year old helped me put it together for my husband's birthday.  If you like carrot cake this recipe is a must in your box.  You won't make another after this one.

Cake seems "mushy" not firm. Flavor was good. Directions seemed backwards. Overall, I might try this again with less juice from crushed pineapples

I also cut the sugar back (1 1/2 cups), reduced the oil to 1 cup and the powdered sugar to 2 1/2 cups, I also added 1 cup of raisins. I also roasted the pecans in the toaster oven before adding to the frosting. This was the best carrot cake I've ever had. Next time, I think I'll reduce the powdered sugar to 2 1/4 cups like another reviewer suggested and add maybe 1/2 cup of raisins instead. A real keeper.

Thanks to this wonderful recipe, my first carrot cake was a huge success!! I
also cut the oil down to 1 cup (glad I read reviews beforehand) and added a teaspoon
of fresh orange zest to the icing.  Saved lots of time by grating baby carrots by
pulse in Cuisinart processor. Baked 35 minutes in 9x13 pan. Everyone absolutely loved it. Thanks.

Delicious, moist cake!
I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, doubled the cinnamon, and increased the cooking time to 45 minutes.  It was perfect!
A food processor works wonders for the carrots and pecans.
For the frosting, I substituted one bar of cream cheese.

I, too, cut the oil to 1Cup.  I added raisins.  It was a huge hit!  I had to use a bundt pan b/c I don't have a rectangle pan and it took longer than 40 minutes to cook (about 45-50). 
Very moist, yummy cake.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

My entire family loved this cake! I've never made carrot cake for my family before, and they were pretty skeptical about it (one of my sons can't stand carrots, and the other can't stand nuts in anything I bake). But they both loved it, and in fact, each has said they want the same thing for their birthdays. Suffice it to say, it was a hit!

An excellent recipe I've used several times.  I recommend using less oil in the cake (1c.) and less powdered sugar in the frosting (2.5 to 3 c - base on taste).

I didn't read the reviews before I made this cake.  It was really oily, but tasty.  I will only put in 1 c. oil next time and leave out the nuts since my guests didn't like nuts.  Raisins should be good.  Definitely will keep in my recipe box.

This has got to be the best and easiest carrot cake recipe I have ever attempted.  I did add a little extra 10x sugar because the icing seemed to be a little runny.  Next time hubby said to leave the pecans out of the icing and maybe put tiny bits of drained pineapple in its place.  It was totally wonderful! I especially like the idea of being able to fit the recipe to fit the crowd. Will make again and again.

it was my first carrot cake and it's actually very good. As many other users I reduced the oil (to 3/4 cup) and reduced a little bit the sugar. It's still very moist.

I made this cake for the office.  It was gone in minutes!  Even my boss, who doesn't like carrot cake, loved it!  I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts and it was great!

I've tried many recipes for Carrot Cake but this beats all of them.  My family is a Carrot Cake "fanatic", and I will use this recipe for years to come.  It is so moist!  I used 3 8-inch layers, Very Good!

Excellent recipe! I did cut the powdered sugar for frosting down to 2 1/4 cups, and it was perfect, now too sweet. I also added raisins and coconut. Very moist, dense, and delicious.

Thank you Tracy! What a wonderful cake! I left out the nuts and added 1 cup raisins to the recipe because I made it for my baby's first birthday! Everyone enjoyed it! This will be a family favorite! CauldronCooker

The best carrot cake ever! Encouraged by other suggestions I cut down the calories by using 1/2 oil and 2/3 cup apple sauce instead of 1 1/2 cups oil; used 1 1/2 cups sugar; and used no butter in the frosting. I did have to bake this longer than 30 minutes, and omitted juice from pineapple.

This recipe is really good and it came out yummy but the frosting was too sweet.  I used 2 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 3 1/2, but it still came out too sweet.  I ended up scraping about half (or more) of the frosting off the cake.  Other than that, it's still one of the best carrot cakes I've ever tasted!

My family, guests and I loved this carrot cake.  I followed the recipe exactly as it appears on allrecipes.com, except I made it in three layers.  I had to make a bit more frosting to do the layers, but it turned out beautifully!  This cake was extremely moist and very delicious!  Enjoy!

This is the moistest carrot cake.  Many thanks to the person who shared this recipe!  For a lower-cal version, I followed other reviewers...3/4 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, 2 t. cinnamon.  The cake came out PERFECT after 45 min.  For the frosting, I used only 1/4 cup margarine and a little more conf. sugar, which seemed to make it less runny.

A fantastic recipe.  I took the advice of other reviews.  I reduced the sugar to  just less than one cup; increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons; reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and I omitted the juice from the can of pineapple - I also added come raisins.  I found the cooking time was over an hour - maybe 1 hour 15 minutes......  The cake was lovely and moist and not too sweet - Many thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I love carrot cake and this was my first attempt at making one.  It was FANTASTIC!!! The best ever!!  My extremely picky husband even said it was the best he had ever tasted.  I will never buy another carrot cake from the grocery store again.  I thought it was very easy to make (food processor).  I took the advice of others and only used 1 cup of oil.  I also found the icing a bit runny, but it was delicious.

My husband is from southern Europe and as far as he's concerned, you don't put vegetables in cakes.  But he tried carrot cake once and asked me to make it for him.  So I looked for recipes and after all the rave reviews, I decided this was the one.  It was easy to make but way way too sweet.  I would cut down on the sugar by half in the cake and icing if I make it again.  Also, there was way too much icing and it was too runny.  I added lemon juice to the icing to lessen the sweetness.  In the end, I scraped it off the cake and threw it out.

This recipe is SOOOO good, you can even make it healthier by subsituting unsweetened applesauce for the oil, omitting the nuts, and using light butter and cream cheese. I took it to work, and it was devoured!!!

This was my 1st time making a carrot cake.  I made this cake last night and had misgivings BUT Oh my God!  This is the best carrot cake I've tasted in a while.  I had read the previous reviews and I used walnuts instead of pecans and used only 1 cup of canola oil.  I also used Eggslands Best eggs.  The real test will be tonight when my boyfriend tries it as he is the carrot cake expert.

This cake is wonderful!! It was super easy, but I would agree that only 1 cup of oil or applesauce is needed. Everyone loved it - and they are more of a chocolate cake crowd. My 18 month old keeps saying "MaMa, cake, cake!!" ;) Great recipe! Thanks.

I have been married for 3 months and my husband's favorite cake is carrot cake.  His words, "This is better than Mom's!". Shhhhhh, please don't tell my mother-in-law.  This cake was the best cake I have ever tried and so easy to make.  However, I did have to add a few minutes to the original 30 minutes of baking time.  It probably cooked for 40 minutes.

This carrot cake is very moist.  I used 1 cup of oil as suggested by many other bakers, but I also added 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  I also increased the cook time to 45 minutes and omitted the nuts.  This cake is the best!

This carrot cake really is awesome.  It's the best carrot cake that I've tasted.  I especially liked the idea of adding pineapples.  The frosting is absolutely outstanding!  I e-mailed this recipe to a number of friends.

Good recipe but really bad cooking instructions.  As many others noted, the cooking time for this cake is at least 45 minutes, maybe longer.

Awesome is an understatement.  This is the best carrot cake I've ever made.  It was moist and delicious even though I cut the oil back to 1 cup.  I made a 4 layer cake and enjoyed each of them!!!!  UMMM Good!

Thanks Tracy! This cake was simply delicious! I am now the official carrot cake maker for the holidays and from now on! :) I only made one substitution...walnuts instead of pecans (I'm allergic). Thanks again!

This carrot cake was excellent. I too cut back on the oil to 1 cup,  used walnuts instead of pecans, threw in 1/2 cup of raisins and sprinkled a little coconut on top. It took about 45 minutes to bake. And i wanted to say thank you Tracy for this wonderful recipe.

Excellent - quite tasty, easy to make.  I too made cupcakes by reducing cooking time to about 24 mins.  Oil was reduced to 1 c., next time I may use a little less or even try applesauce.

I didn't like carrot cake until I tried this one!!!  I made it for my mother in law's birthday.  It was so moist and good....and the frosting...yummy!!!!!  I used the full amount of oil but did not use the juice from the pineapple.  It turned out great!!!  I did have to bake it for 45 minutes.  This is definately a keeper!!!  Heck, I'm thinking of making a big bowl of the frosting and eating it with a spoon. :)

I must say I was a bit disapointed in the recipe. I followed the directions exactly and the cake boiled over in the oven leaving a mess. The 30 minutes for baking the cake was way off. When I looked in at 30 minutes I was sure I had done something wrong but left it in to continue cooking another 15 minutes. It started to smell like it was burning so I took it out. The cake appeared to be done in all but a circular area. The cake around the edges was definitely good tasting. I wish I had read the reviews before hand as I would have also cut down on the oil. I think I would cut out the juice from the pineapple too. I'm bummed I didn't have the good results as most of the others.

I used a 1 cup of oil instead of the
recommended amount and it turned out
great.  A food processor is a must to
shred all those carrots.
