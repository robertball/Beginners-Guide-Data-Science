I couldn't find a small jar or bag of cardamom so left it out. I used apricots in heavy syrup drained to the directions. Just mixed up in bowl with spices and rest of ingredients didn't need to puree it mashed up really quick and easy. It smells divine while cooking and tastes fantastic. Not too sweet and while you could taste the cinnamon I don't think it overpowered the dish. When I can get a smaller amount of the cardamom I will make this again because there seems to be no substitute for the spice and I am curious to see what extra flavor it brings to the dish. It has been years and years since I used cardomam and is supposed to lend a great flavor to the dish. Less butter I think the next time there was enough fat with the thighs it doesn't need that much. Thanks for the recipe!

Wasn't sure going into this meal how it would turn out. I used canned apricots and 1/2 jar of preserves. I also ground fresh ginger cardmom pods peppercorns and cinnamon stix. I feared the cinnamom would overpower but it didn't and the cardamom aroma was strong. But after it cooked down the flavors married well together. I would make this meal again no complaints!

I followed the recipe but used boneless skinless breasts and no cardamon. It was 11 for a small bottle and I didn't feel the spring was worth it. The overwhelming consensus was the cinnamon overpowered. The dish was not well received at all. I don't know maybe the cardamon and thighs might have made a difference.

It was an interesting dish but there was not a whole lot of flavor. Perhaps if I used apricots in a heavy syrup versus a light.

this is a pretty good dish. we used boneless breasts instead of chicken thighs. we also left out the cardamom. maybe that would've made it better but it was still ok

When I make this kind of glazed chicken I use a jar of Saucy Susan. It has alot of flavor makes a wonderful glaze very easy to find and saves a bunch of time.
