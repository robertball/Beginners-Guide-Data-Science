My fiance & I have made this delightful recipe. Instead of all of the spices we used only 2.5 tsp. cinnamon. As for the sugars - we used 1 cup of each (brown and white). My fiance loves this applebutter.

I used Fuji apples that were short on shelf life.  They were a little smaller so I think ended up with approx. 18 apples. Since Fuji's are sweet, I only added 1 1/4 C. brown sugar. Cooked on HIGH for 5-6 hours and let cool slightly. Threw them in the food processor and VIOLA! I got 6.5 pints and it's wonderful! Thick and sweet. It looks as good as it tastes. This will be "THE" apple butter recipe from now on.

**UPDATE** Made it again this week (10/31/2019) with a mix of small Fuji apples and a few Honeycrisp. Again, they were just a hair past ripe and since they are both sweet apples, I cut down on the brown sugar to 1.5 cups. They also made an incredible amount of their own juice. When tender in the crockpot, I put on the stove and used an immersion blender and then cooked a little of the juice off. I will do this every time as it really bloomed all of the flavors. Hands down, still my favorite apple butter recipe.

It is really good. My son says it has converted him into an apple butter lover!  It is extremely easy to make. I used 13 golden delicious apples and it made two quarts. I need to go get more apples from the orchard!!!

So good and so easy! We cut down a bit on the sugar as our golden apples were pretty sweet, but no other changes. Thanks!

Very easy and delicious! I doubled this recipe and it cooked down to fill about half of my 6 qt slow cooker.  I used some fairly tart, but juicy, Paula red apples. I cut down on the sugar, only because my apples didn't require it.  I started with 3 cups of dark brown sugar and added another 1/4 cup about 3 hours before it was done. ( Recall I doubled my batch-for one batch I would start with 1.5 cups of sugar and add according to taste) I canned about 5-8 oz and 2 half quart jars. I can give some of the smaller ones for gifts.  Thanks for my new go-to Apple Butter recipe!

It smells very good. Will have to wait until it cools to taste it. The size of the apple used wasn't mentioned. I followed the recipe exactly and only got 4 pints out of it. Disappointing when the author said 7 pints was the original recipe. Had 16 cups of chopped apple to start with making the crockpot 2/3 to 3/4 full. I love apple butter so am excited to try it on something for breakfast!

I increased the cinnamon, all spice and cloves.  It was delicious. I have made four batches this year.

This apple butter beats other recipes, hands down!  I left the peels on my apples, just cored them, and then used an immersion blender when the apples were cooked and soft.  The peels help the apple butter thicken, as well.  Less work, and you can't even tell the difference - it's smooth and full of spices!

Very yummy!!!!!!!
I used Macintosh apples which are sweet so I didn't add much sugar. I took a tip from other similar recipes and cooked it for an extra few hours with the lid off the crockpot to allow it to thicken. This made a great little homemade gift for family and coworkers, everyone loved it. Very flavourful!!

I did not have the blender that was needed but I placed it in my smoothie maker and put it on blend and it did the trick! I received compliments that said it was better than store bought and it was awesome  and delicious. It was easier than I thought and was my first time! Making again as soon as possible!

This was a great guide for a first timer.  I altered the sugar to 1/2c light brown and 1.5c of raw sugar.  It was on high in the crockpot for 4.5 hours then set to warm for 12 hours (overnight).  Turned out amazing.  I'm doubling the recipe this afternoon!

I filled a 6 Qt crockpot with chopped golden delicious apples and got 7 half pint jars - this was 20, what I would consider medium sized, apples - tastes great, wish there was more. Thinking maybe the serving size should say 7 half pints rather than pints.  When I saw how it cooked down I changed my jars from pints to half pints.

It is a good butter.I had never used so many spices but it turned out good. Next time I will cut down a little bit on the sugar. The smell in house was amazing.

I think the recipe is good and the results were good, but I'll need to tweak this in future attempts.  I used tart Pink Lady apples and the tartness came through more than I'd have liked, producing almost an apple cider undertone.  Gala or Fuji might have been a better choice.  I cooked the apples in the slow cooker for just 4 hours and that seemed too long.  As a result the flavors are very intense, stronger than commercially made apple butter.  And the yield was reduced too -- 11 larger-than-medium apples cooked down to only 5.5 pints.

So, a more mellow apple, perhaps backing off on both the sugar and spices just a bit, and cooking less -- we should be good.

I used 8-9 pounds of apples. Made one batch with gala apples and one with honey crisp. Like the tartness of the honey crisp. I drained but reserved the liquid to make it thicker and added until it was the consistency I wanted. I added 1/2 tsp if nutmeg and a tablespoon of molasses. This was a double batch !

This apple butter is so yummy!  I added nutmeg and vanilla extract and the flavor is fantastic. Instead of canning, I opted for freezing the extra jars.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is the best recipe I have found for apple butter. It's easy. Just put everything in the slow cooker and let it go. I would go back and stir it a couple of times but that was it. My family loves it.

This recipe is AMAZING! The exact taste of apple butter I loved as a kid. When it is cooked long enough I just used a wisk and it came out very smooth and nice and thick.
