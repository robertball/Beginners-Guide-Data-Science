The marinade pairs so well with the venison. We had some leftover steaks from last fall and had to use them up. The family couldn't get enough. Melt in your mouth yum! Do not change a thing.

I really liked this recipe but I also added some cherry tomatoes and used both red & green bell peppers. Everyone raved about it! Even one of our neighbor's kids ate some & now asks when are we going to have some again.

This recipe was delicious!  Definitely saved to put into the regular routine.  The next time we would double the marinade to brush on the kebabs while grilling.  There didn't seem to be enough.
