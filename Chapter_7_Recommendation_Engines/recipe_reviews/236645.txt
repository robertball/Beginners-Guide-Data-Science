Very nice and simple dish!  Couldn't find the White Fiber Mini Shells, so I used regular Barilla Shells.  Instead of regular olive oil I used a mixture of olive oil and garlic infused olive oil.  Fabulous!

Here's another simple but tasty pasta dish that I made for a potluck.  With the slight tang of the cherry tomatoes mixing with a subtle basil flavor and a creamy texture of melted parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, any pasta fan would gobble this up.  Very nice!

Another reviewer suggested chilling this, so I did, and we liked it!  I also used Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Chili to saute the veggies which gave it a little kick of heat (loved it).  Served with a green tossed salad, warm baguette, and some slices of TJ’s Italian fresh mozzarella.  It just doesn’t get much easier than this to put a nice meal on the table, and less time in the kitchen during a hot summer definitely is for me.

This is so easy!  I would add some garlic and some pepper flakes next time.  The fresh basil really makes this a perfect summer dish.  Personally, I like the tomatoes just tossed with the hot pasta and not actually cooked.  Don't forget to salt your pasta water, it really makes a difference in the end result of this recipe.

This wasn't filling to me at all. The flavor was a little mild. I think it would have been better had I chilled it as reviewers suggested.

DELICIOUS! I could not find the white fiber mini shells, so I used the white fiber mini rotini. The family really enjoyed this simple dish that can be served hot, cold or room temp. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is so simple and so flavorful.  It would be great any time of year, but especially now, with the warm weather.  It is just as good hot, room temperature or even chilled. The only thing I felt it needed is some finely minced garlic roasted with the tomato and onions.  Thanks, Barilla

Easy, quick and very good. I added some Garlic and Red pepper flakes. Great as a meal or a side dish. I served it hot last night and I will have it cold for lunch today. Yum! Love the Pasta!

I have made this dish twice! The first time my family loved it, so I made it again for a baby shower last weekend! It was a hit with everyone. For the shower I substituted mini farfalle and chilled the night before. I really recommend for a buffet style meal or a cool light lunch meal!

This wasn't my favorite Barilla recipe. I served it chilled, but seemed like it was missing something. Perhaps warm is better?

Even as is this is a five star recipe.  I did add a couple garlic cloves, chopped; about a tsp. or Herbs de Provance (because I LOVE it!); and regular parmesan cheese, because that's what I had available.  The only other change I made was that I used Barilla Medium Shells because I couldn't find the White Fiber Mini-Shells at my store.  It was delicious!  It would be great as a main dish for lunch, or as a side dish with some protein and a salad for dinner.  I was thrilled to be able to use fresh basil from my mom's garden with this, and I'm sure fresh tomatoes would be scrumptious too if you have them.  I will DEFINATELY make this one again!  Thanks so much BARILLA!

Loved this. Simple recipes like this one that utilize just a few fresh ingredients are very refreshing to make and to eat.  I added a pinch of crushed rosemary on a whim but this recipes needs no changes at all.

Another one of those recipes that is so simple, yet very tasty. I added in some garlic when the onion was almost cooked.  I love the freshness of the ingredients. Makes a perfect summer meal. Next time I will add more basil because the flavor was very mild. I do have to say this is much better right after you make it. I found when it was reheated the next day the flavors were quite bland. I ended up having to add more cheese and some seasonings. I used a mix of red and orange cherry tomatoes A fresh, colorful dish.

With the weather here in triple digits I thought this recipe would be great cold and I was right. I cooked the onions in garlic infused olive oil and didn't cook the tomatoes nor did I add the cooking liquid. For added flavor I used garlic salt to season the water I cooked the mini shells in. This is an easy recipe and will definitely be made again.

This was an amazing salad! I couldn't figure out if this salad was to be served warm cold or hot, but it was great both ways. The only reason our family is giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we thought it needed more cheese (probably mozzarella) and garlic! Otherwise, YUM!!

Honestly, I am just not a fan of fresh basil despite it being so popular with fresh recipes it seems today. It is also quite pricey, I found, unless one grows it. When I tasted it, I thought the basil was too dominant and the ingredients didnt much transform themselves. I froze the leftovers. Oddly it tasted better to me as the basil flavor mellowed out and it was re-heated. I would rate this between a 3~4. I just like pasta with a little more ingredients.

My husband and I have been making pasta like this for years. While we usually use spaghetti, the white fiber mini shells were a nice change of pace. Simple, fresh ingredients are the key to great Italian cooking, and this recipe is a great example of that. Delizioso!

This was rather flavorless. 
It is an easy meal to make is but it would be sooooo much better if spinach pasta were used (IMO).

It was good. We made it as written, very simple. I do believe it needs garlic and a little bit of spice. I got that with a scant amount of red pepper flakes. It is great cold, left over. I just drizzled a little olive oil and added about 5 black olives to my serving, then sprinkled with parm cheese. Great!

This recipe sounded like a good start. I used Hodgson Mill Organic Whole Wheat Spirals with Milled Flax for the pasta. I sauteed the onions past translucent till nearly caramelized,  I added fresh garlic, some hot pepper flakes, and some crumbled bacon. I served it to someone who thought they wouldn't like it, but they ended up loving it and had seconds and thirds. Needless to say, there's none left :-)  I will definitely make this again when I get another influx of cherry tomatoes!

I loved this recipe. My son wasn't a fan - but I thought it was absolutely perfect. LOVED the fresh tomatoes and basil in this and the simple flavors that allow the fresh ingredients to really shine.

This made a LOT of pasta!  The next day it wasn't as flavorful, but a little olive oil drizzled on top before reheating in the microwave solved the dryness issue.  Right out of the pan, it was quite delicious.  It had a mild flavor despite all the basil I threw on top, and overall, it could probably use a little more salt since the parmesan wasn't enough for me. It was quick and made a great weekday meal!  I'd do it again, but would probably add a protein this time - maybe some grilled chicken or shrimp?

This is a very easy salad to make, and it's tasty, too!  We did like the mini fiber shells and will look forward to using the pasta again!  Thanks for an easy side dish, Barilla!

I loved that this was so simple and also tasted great!  I served it warm for dinner but since it was just my husband and myself I had leftovers.  The next day I had it cold for lunch and I think it just as good cold.  Great recipe!

We loved this recipe! I added minced garlic and fresh mozzarella cheese to it, and that was the perfect addition to the flavor!  Nice easy recipe, perfect for a busy family!
