It could be just me but these cookies were a bust. I reveiwed the recipe several times to make sure I had done everuthing correctly and it seems as though I did. The dough turned out too runny and needless too say it turned out worse after baking them. I had to throw away everything. The recipe is very easy so if you have ingredients to spare try it out and please let others know how it went. It could have been a fluke in my case...maybe someone else will have better luck.

I'm a very beginning cook.  In fact, I avoid cooking at all costs unless I have to.  I needed to make cookies for a class I'm taking, so I found the easiest recipe I could and made it.  I have to say, I had no problems with the dough being too runny.  I read the reviews and added a TINY bit of extra flour like some people suggested.  It was fine.  As soon as I added the dry ingredients in, it thickened and was perfectly normal dough.  I just didn't let the butter melt while it was "softening" in the microwave, and I stirred in everything as much as I could.  The cookies are a little "pancakey" as someone else said, but really still very good.  My family loves them.

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever come across. Every year for Christmas my friends and family ask for a tin full of them. The only thing i changed was the amount of milk the recipe called for. just start off with a small amount if you need more than add more, and I actually added my own twist, instead of covering them in just sugar try cinnamon too it give the cookies a sweeter taste

I said to put on ungreased cookies sheets and they stuck. There wasn't enough flour in them. It took awhile to doctor them up so I wouldn't have to throw the whole thing out. Walk away from this one.

this recipe is not written very good. if you take out the milk and add 1-2 more eggs then you should gt a better result. the milk makes it too soft of a dough and the oven spreads them out too much so they burn and you need more eggs to fluff them up!

These were absolutely delicious!

My husband and I wanted a snack one night, and I tried to find a quick and easy sugar cookie recipe that would only require what I had sitting around.

This recipe was perfect.  I used self-rising flour instead of all purpose (and left out the baking powder)...they turned out so soft and not overly sweet.  I was a bit worried about the dough being so runny, but I just used a teaspoon and made drop cookies, and it worked.

I will definitely be making this for family and friends.

The cookie batter was very sticky. I put it in the freezer, but it didn't help.  The cookies ran together in the oven, and didn't turn out well.

I decided to make these cookies to give to my friends as Christmas, and I'm glad I know these peope well.  I followed the directions exactly and the cookies were not very good.  They turned out to be slighty hard in spots, flat, and odd tasting.

This is a new family favorite. I'm already making these for the third time this season. I add an extra egg to the recipe because it is a little to dry, but they always turn out soft and tasty.

These cookies were not the "yummiest"  sugar cookies ever but they were okay.  I think they were worth trying but I might not make them again.

This recipe is definitely easy. Thankfully I had all the ingredients so I was eager to prepare the cookies. Unfortunately, even after following the recipe to a "T" the cookies did not turn out to be the "yummiest cookies ever!" They are ok. (I'm eating one of them as I type.) The recipe can use a little tweeking but if easy is what you want, this is definitely the best I've found. I'll try again next week. Thanks!!

This was incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  The dough was terribly sticky and impossible to "roll".  I tried adding more flour after the first batch came out like, as someone else said, pancakes.  But after tasting what had already come out of the oven I decided to scrap the whole project.  Huge waste of ingredients. DON'T USE THIS RECIPE.  If I'd had to pay for this I would be demanding my money back, unfortunately the cost of trying something can be what you lose in materials.  Total bummer.  Wish I had read the reviews first but I was excited to be able to make sugar cookies with what I already had at home, won't do that again.

I think this recipe needs to be reviewed by the person who submitted it. The cookies taste fine but, the "dough" is runny. When baked the cookies come out with a sort of "pancake" texture. You can add flour and sugar to make it the consistency thicker if needed.

This recipe is very easy and the cookies are yummy. I've made these cookies about 3 times now and they are gone within a matter of 2 days after they have been made. Although they are hard to roll they still came out perfect and chewy. My family absolutely loves them. Thanks for the recipe.

it says in the directions to roll the dough into walnut sized balls. i couldn't. The "dough" was runny and there was no way i could roll it. I had to kind of just drop it on the pan. they didn't turn out that badly, but they weren't terrific.

_Good_ taste, texture, and easiness in this recipe. It'll have a permanent place in my freezer from now on. I'm wondering if the person that had trouble might possibly have not put the cookies 2" apart? or I suspect, could they have greased the pan? or melted their butter instead of using at room temperature? The only thing I did different was, I always cook with Smart Balance instead of butter for our health, and the cookies were easy to make into golf balls and even better after a night in the freezer. Recommend trying again as they're pretty good and inexpensive.

These cookies are delicious and chewy on the inside and crispy around the edges.  I had to spoon drop the dough because it was very sticky...otherwise it's great.

I have to agree with 'SAGERS'. I had to add more flour to make this dough easy to work with. Mine turned out okay when they came out of the oven, but I really thought that they were tasteless. I was just going to pitch them, but on second thought I will wait until hubs gets home. He may have a different opinion of them than I do. I was wondering if the person who submitted them could have missed an ingredient when they were typing it in. To me, it just felt like they were missing something.

well first off i didnt have butter so i used butter spread, so it was a little bit more oily than i wanted it... but it was still like cake batter thin once i was done... i ended up adding 3cups more flour and i cookie-cutter'ed it with mini hearts and it made approx.8doz... very yummie though after my ajustments... overall i guess i would need to make this recipie with butter to really know... but if i make basic sugar cookies again i will use this again !

The "Cookies" were good other than the fact that the mixture was runny , the "Dough" was weak in the oven and they all ran together. But all they really needed to be perfect was some MORE flour. So my second batch was risen.

I made these cookies and thought they were wonderful! They are a bit crispy on the edges and nice and soft in the center. Very easy to make, due to the fact that there aren't a lot of ingredients (all of which I already had on hand! You really need to stir the milk in well.  And I found that I had to put the dough in the freezer for awhile before I could roll them.  The dough is very sticky! I also rolled them in colored sugars before baking to make them fun! Everyone loved them!  I will continue to make them and pass this recipe on to friends.

These are easy. To make a mess of. the middle is runny and tart like, the dough can't  be rolled into balls. waste of ingredients. Next time, don't copy and paste a picture of cookies just to make it look like you can cook.

It was too thin. I added flour to thicken it up. I thought it was all good, but when i took a bite,  it tasted like strait  flour.It looked okay.

I do enjoy the cookie itself.. I noticed that if you left them in for 12 minutes they form a bit of a crunch to them without burning, which is nice. I do have to agree that the batter was too runny.. I added about a quarter cup more of flour to the batter and stuck it in the freezer for about 15 minutes to firm it up a bit. I would probably make again.. keeping in mind the whole runny batter thing while making it! c:

Seeing as the recipe was very simple I decided to experiment. Instead of butter I replaced it with 207 ml of vegetable oil wanting to see how the cookies would turn out. I saw in previous reviews about a runny batter which I did end up with but wasn't surprised, I used oil for pete sakes, so I used enough flour (WAY more than what the recipe called) until I was able to scoop it up and form them into balls covered in sugar. (What I did notice is that if you give the batter some time, it might harden up..by the end I was actually able to pick up the batter and it didn't stick.) What I got was some pretty decent sugar cookies! Not the absolute best, but enough to satisfy that cookie craving. I'm pretty sure if I used butter I would've gotten a better flavor. Overall, I'm content! It's worth a shot!

I followed this recipe exactly. The dough was nonexistence. It was more like a cake batter than a cookie batter. I tried putting in the freezer to give it some time to firm, but that didn't help either. The cookies were flat and sticky. Even with non-stick spray, they stuck to the bottom of the pan. There is definitely something missing from this recipe.

These were very easy and turned out good. I followed the suggestions of  others by making sure my butter was very soft, and I added an additional 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I let them cook for 8 minutes. I frosted and decorated mine while still warm and they were soft and good. Will make again. Did not give it 5 stars because I added extra vanilla.

The recipe was all right but I had to grease the pans so they wouldn't stick and add a half cup of flour so it wouldn't be too runny.

I would like to mention that the full 2 1/2 cups of flour is not necessary. My first batch in which I used 2 1/2 cups of flour in turned out way too crumbly. I instead tried just 2 cups, and had success. I heard most people were having the issue of runny batter but my problem was the complete opposite. I also used margarine instead of butter and used an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Although I didn't follow the 8 minute rule, my cookies came out PERFECTLY at 5 minutes, however it may just be my oven
