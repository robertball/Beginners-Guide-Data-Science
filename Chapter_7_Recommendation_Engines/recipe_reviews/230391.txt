This has the potential to be "delicious," but it came out incredibly bland.  Next time I would perhaps use a finely diced mirepoix (onion, celery and carrot) and add some minced garlic as well, and/or increase the strength of the bouillon.  The texture was great, but it tasted like nothing.

I decided to try this recipe to accompany the Balsamic chicken that I was serving.  I wanted a pilaf that would be subtle in flavor to offset the bold flavors of the chicken, and this pilaf was perfect for that!  The only change I made was to cook the pilaf in chicken broth since I didn't have any beef bouillon.

Just tried it, and was disappointed.  It's quite bland, even for me.  And I had even added minced garlic and a little extra boullion.  Fortunately, I will be serving it with a brown gravy, although that was not my original intention.
