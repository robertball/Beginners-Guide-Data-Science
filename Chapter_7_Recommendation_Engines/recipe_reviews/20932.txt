This was wonderful!  The sauce is outstanding.  Made it according to the recipe except I added garlic.  I prefer it to bottled blue cheese dressing and it's lower in fat!!  Woo-hoo!

Also, I made the chicken three different ways.  Some straight by the recipe.  Some pieces I soaked in hot sauce then grilled on my george foreman.  And a few I brushed with some hot&spicy BBQ sauce and grilled.  

All were good but the ones that soaked in hot sauce then grilled were the clear favorite.  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks!

This was quick, easy and delicious!  I used boneless chicken strips and cut them into cubes for bite size apetizers!

Very good.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt and regular mayo.  I also cut the chicken into cubes.  We had it for supper with the Spinach and Strawberry Salad on this site.

This was so good and so easy to make! I didn't make the dip only because I already had blue cheese dressing in my fridge. I will definitely try making the lower fat dressing next time to cut down on some calories and fat! I marinated my chicken in hot sauce for a couple of hours before I sauteed the chicken and I added a little more hot sauce than what was called for. I also saved some leftovers for lunch tomorrow so I can eat them cold with blue cheese dressing. Great recipe!

Took this to a group meeting and the guys could not get enough!  I gave 4 stars only because I needed to make more sauce than the recipe called for.  Also, I used Frank's Chile 'n Lime Hot Sauce.

Absolutely delicious, though I made a few revisions.  I left out the blue cheese and marinated the chicken overnight in Italian dressing.  The chicken was very juicy.  I made fajita wraps with chicken, sauce, and tomato.

Thanks for the dip recipe. It is good but my family could tell it was lowfat. They don't need the fat so they will have to get used to it. I like it and will make it again.

This was delicious,quick and easy. I agree that the recipe should make sauce that is more plentiful and spicier, though.  I am a "healthy" eater working towards weight loss, so I cooked this following the recipe (although I use 4 tablespoons of hot sauce) and had mine with the dip in the recipe.  For my husband, who was horrified by the thought of eating yoghurt, I used regular old Blue Cheese dressing.  That means we all eat the same thing, the kids and I get something delicious and healthy, and my husband gets something delicious and less healthy with absolutely no extra effort.  I do find it necessary, as I said, to add lots more hot sauce, and next time I will probably double the butter, too, so the strips are a little saucier in general.  I also plan to try the strips over a bd of greens with the dip as a dressing.  Yum!

Sooo good.  I added twice the amount of hot sauce, though.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces before browning, and served along side celery sticks with the dip as an appetizer.  Wonderful!

Pretty good recipe. I had a craving for buffalo wings...but wanted to skip all of the breading. These were just what I was looking for. I skipped the dressing and used my own lowfat ranch, per my preference.

I used chicken breasts, sliced thin and only fried for 5-6 minutes...then followed the recipe.  I found if I fried for 8 mintues it became very dry.  So I also "marinated" the chicken in evaporated milk after seasoning it, for 30 minutes, then I dredged in the flour mixture and refrigerated it...continue as written, mcuh more tender.  I may marinate it, dredge it, then dredge again because my son is so used to the forzen variety that has more batter on it.  Love it though!  Added some garlic powder... it's a keeper!

Not impressive at all.  While the blue cheese sauce is excellent, the chicken itself comes out lacking in flavor and not at all resembling buffalo chicken.  Were it to be called "saute chicken with sauce," then I'd give the recipe a higher rating.

Spicy, but generally bland.  The blue cheese dressing was great- added a little garlic powder.  Would bread the chicken next time and maybe add a little ketchup and chopped garlic.  Supposed to make a great wing sauce

These were great!  Tasted just like the ones we get at our favorite old hang out Tanner's!  I did like another reviewer suggested & marinated in evaporated milk & coated in flour. We decided it we did that again, we may throw on the grill as we think that may take away some of the 
"softness" that you get to the breading from the sauce.  Not bad, just we think that may help or eliminate the breading all together.  These are a keeper though!!!  UPDATE - made a 2nd time & be sure to marinate in the evaporated milk & coat in flour mixture.  We did not this time & threw on grill, they were a bit dry.  Next time think will marinate, flour & throw on grill.

My husband loved these, but I thought they were a bit lacking in flavor.  I will probably make them for my hubby again since he really enjoyed them and they were very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

This was overall a pretty good recipe.  After adding the butter and tobasco, I slooshed around a blob of barbeque sauce(I like to use technical cooking terms!)in the pan and coated the chicken.  I have made it without the barbeque sauce, but definately prefer the chicken coated with barbeque sauce and the tabasco/butter.

I got a total mix of reviews from my family.  I REALLY liked them - my boyfriend and daughter weren't as thrilled (they prefer them dipped in ranch dressing oppossed to the dressing this recipe makes ~ which somewhat defeats all that extra work).  Guess you got to be a blue cheese fan.  However, I did dust the chicken strips in some flour flavored with S&P and a little onion powder - gave them an ever-so-slight crunch to them and used reg. mayo = not low fat.  I plan on keeping this recipe around - if for no other reason than making myself a batch sometime.

This recipe turned out great, but there really isn't any substitute for deep frying your chicken strips.  My wife and I both thought the flavor was good and the chicken turned out tender.  We'll use it again but we'll fry the chicken then toss it in the buffalo sauce.

I made just the chicken (used bottled blue cheese).  Easy to make, good flavor.  Not quite spicy enough for us though and I probably tripled the hot sauce (I used Texas Pete).  May add red pepper to it next time or try a hotter sauce.

I had been yearning for a lower fat and no bones version of buffalo wings.  This was pretty easy and tasty!  We needed more hot sauce!

These were GREAT! We loved them.  Used the rest of the dipping sauce as salad dressing.  I will cut back on butter at least 1/2 next time I make it.

My fiance made this, using regular mayo and substituting chives for the green onions.  We both think it's a keeper!

Very good, though not terribly spicy.  I more than doubled the hot sauce, and still it was too tame for our brave tastes.  Next time I will marinate the chicken in hot sauce before cooking.l

These were an okay substitute for chicken wings (less fat), but they weren't quite spicy enough for me.

I cut up a chicken breast and poured a lot of hot sauce on it before sauteing. Once it was mostly cooked, I added a little bit of butter and more hot sauce.  I used bottled blue cheese dressing just 'cuz it was quicker.  Will definitely make again when I'm looking for something quick.

I had some leftover blue cheese I didn't know what to do with so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I used sour cream in place of the yogurt and the dip was delicious. I ate it with celery and carrots as well as the strips.  My husband thought the dip was a bit too oniony, so he just used ranch dressing on his chicken.  The chicken came out great, too.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

I breaded my chicken breasts first and deep fried as my family likes the crunchy coating.  Cut up into bite-sized pieces and used MUCH more hot sauce then recipe calls for 'cause we like 'em hot!  Served on top of a mixed green salad with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing (from this site).  Yummy Yum Good!

Very good, easy to make, but there was a lot of dip left over (maybe we're just not big dippers!).  Next time I will halve the dip recipe.

I loved this recipe. My fiancé and I are on diets getting ready for our wedding, and we wanted to watch the football games with something healthier and less expensive than restaurant buffalo wings. We were both so happy with the much healthier substitute. We probably used more sauce than it said because we didn't measure the cholula sauce as we poured it in--we stopped pouring when it looked like it would cover the chicken in enough spice. I didn't have any Bleu cheese on hand, so I used a Parmesan-reggiano blend shredded cheese with a powder ranch dip mix I had on hand. I also didn't have mayo on hand, so I used greek yogurt and light sour cream instead. It turned out delicious. We will definitely make this again!
