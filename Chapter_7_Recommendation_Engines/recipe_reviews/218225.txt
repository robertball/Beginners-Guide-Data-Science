This dish was great. I have made something similar before with orzo instead of couscous but couscous is outstanding and looks very pretty on the plate. I did use whole wheat couscous, and because it is dark the other ingredients didn't stand out as much. Regardless, it was pretty to look at and delicious. I also used all chicken broth (3/4 cup) , no water. As is, this is a very light lunch but if you cook some chicken breasts strips on the side seasoned with salt and pepper you can make this a more filling dinner entree. I say "salt and pepper" because the flavors in this couscous are complex enough and a heavy seasoned chicken might be a bit too much. Of course, it depends on your own personal taste and that of your family. Opa!!

My family enjoyed this.  I made a few changes to appeal to the 12 and 10 year olds: skipped the olives, but added some finely diced red pepper which gave it a nice crunch.  Also, I didn't have garbanzo beans, and used black beans instead.  Overall, a nice, healthy side dish.

I doubled the recipe so that I would have enough to bring for lunches this week.  I used all chicken broth instead of some water because I did not want to waste the rest of the can.  I also only used a can of garbanzo beans, which was a little scant, because I didn't want to open a second for another ounce of beans.  The results were delicious.

if this has chicken broth in it then it's not vegetarian.

mmm, the perfect side dish to a baked salmon and spinach dish. I followed one of the reviews and omitted the water and replaced it with more chicken broth. I also used whole wheat couscous and since I didn't have sundried tomatoes, I just used some homegrown tomatoes I had dehydrated. Absolutely delicious and I'm eating a bowl of leftovers right now. :) Next time I might add just a touch more broth.

Super easy to make. The flavors are great and it's light and refreshing. 
I used a sweet pepper instead of sun-dried tomatoes and I left out the olives. I added a little extra lemon juice also. :)

Fantastic for a healthy lunch. Used veggie broth rather than chicken broth (since I'm a vegetarian) and left out the olives (don't like them), but other than that I stuck to the recipe and my family loved it. The "dressing" is quite good, the flavors come together very nicely.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is delicious.  Looking at the ingredients I knew we would like it, but I had no idea just how well it would come together.  I used a full can of chickpeas and added more feta.  Amazingly tasty!

Healthy and addicting!  I followed the recipe exactly but left the olives out since my boyfriend hates them.  This was delicious without the olives but when I added the olives (minced) to eat the leftovers for lunch...WOW.

Wonderful taste! Chick peas give the couscous a great flavor. I added sea salt and fresh parsley to the recipe; I really recommend you add these two ingredients for more taste. I omitted water and used 1/2 cup of chicken broth for 1/2 cup of couscous and used fresh tomatoes instead of sun dried. An excellent alternative for rice or lentils!

A great side dish that's different and easy to make.  I substituted the olives and sun dried tomatoes for seedless cucumbers and tomatoes.  The only flavor that I thought was overpowering was the dried oregano.  The next time I make this I'll use fresh oregano or cut it in half.  I added fresh basil, a dash of salt and drizzled with olive oil right before I served and I felt that balanced the flavors a little better!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I replaced the feta by grated parmigiano rigiano because that's all I hand on hand and it was just as good.  For texture, I also added a finely chopped red pepper.

This was a hit.  I made my own garbanzo beans as I had those on hand.  The husband liked the added texture the beans added.  I loved the feta & kalamata olives.  We will do this again.

We love this! It is so fresh tasting! I serve it on a bed of fresh baby spinach! I just cook the cous cous in all broth and no water.
Enjoy! Great summer time meal!

I tripled the recipe for meal prep. Added onions and cucumber. Don't worry too much about the quantity of liquids, I just kept adding 1/2 cup increments of water/broth until it was as fluffy as I wanted. One suggestion is to season the chick peas with cumin, paprika, and chile powder, then bake for 10 min. Overall super good.

Very nice. I'm not sure why couscous salad recipes sometimes omit the oil from the dressing. I may be missing something, but I always add an amount of oil to the dressing that is equal to the vinegar and lemon juice combined. It worked out great for this salad.

I LOVED this!  I had to leave the kalamata olives out of the families portion (they don't like them) but put I them in mine :) The sun dried tomatoes were a great addition.  Will make again for sure!

The flavors in this are spot-on for Greek. Only I would cut down on the olive and garbanzo bean amounts. Also, I felt it needed small cherry tomatoes instead and some cubes of cucumbers to add some freshness. Otherwise, the dressing was simple and bright. I don't think it needs oil of any kind added either. I used some fresh "Israeli Greek Oregano" as well.  A perfect accompaniment with a Greek meal.

Not only can all the cooking be done in the cooler hours-  but this is such a versatile recipe. First time I made as written. No leftovers for lunches!!!  Second time I doubled and served with grilled chicken for a light and healthy dinner. Tonight I added - must goes- from the fridge- half a yellow bell pepper, 4 radishes, half a red onion.  Served with grilled fish. Wow. This is so good. My neighbors dropped by- thank goodness it's easy to double - Carol wants the recipe and John wants the leftovers for his lunch tomorrow. KenzieKook- Thanks for making me look so good

Wonderful salad. I was out of Kalamata olives so used a tablespoon of capers instead. I used only a pinch of oregano- thanks to a previous review.  I also added some fresh parsley and fresh tomatoes chopped instead of dried.
It is full of color and yummy flavors!

I have made this recipe several times since finding it. I LOVE it. The only change I make is to use all chicken broth and regular black olives. Mmm. It's easy, healthy, and low calorie!

I cooked the couscous according to package directions.  I have tried this method before and it is still hard.  I also did double couscous and all chicken broth.

This was really good and so simple and quick. I used regular couscous because that is what I had, and cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried since we have an abundant garden. Followed recipe otherwise. There was way too much black pepper...it burned our mouths. Maybe I read it incorrectly, but I don’t think so. Next time I need to add more feta and something green....either fresh chopped spinach or cucumbers. But a really great taste!

YUM! This was delicious! 
For my own future reference:
Made 1 1/2 c couscous (toasted in butter and garlic first)
in 1 c water and 3/4c chicken broth, salt. 
After cooking added all other ingredients. 
Did not like it with garbanzos much. 
Added parsley and olive oil.
Rowenna did not appreciate the garlic/chick broth.

This is delicious! I added cucumbers and some cooked red quinoa, I also doubled the dressing (I did also add olive oil to the dressing) - went light on the olives and feta - the flavor was very well balanced for me! Thank you!

Super delicious! Didn’t have white wine vinegar so subbed in apple cider vinegar, also used a cup of halved cherry tomatoes instead of dried. This is the type of recipe you can easily adjust for taste or what’s in the cupboard, and will come our yummy every time!

Very good salad. Love the fresh taste. I did add a few things. Teaspoon of fresh lemon zest dried in warm pan along with toasted pine nuts. I also used champagne vinegar.

I didn't have chickpeas or feta so i substituted bell peppers and it was marvelous. I also ate it warm a few times, I was starving. It was a lovely way to learn how to use couscous.

I have made it many times and it's always a big hit!  It's my "go to" for parties, pot lucks, etc.  I often add chicken/tofu/tempeh to give it more protein.  I also add a little more vinegar and lemon juice to give it a little more zip!  Love it!

I made this salad/side dish to go with some baked fish. I added some olive oil and some salt.Afrer tasting it,  I felt it needed more "substance". So I added some diced seedless cucumber and some chopped parsley. I liked it better with my additions and will make it this way in the future.

This was great. It doubles easily to make a quick light main course. I left out the olives (not a fan) and added in a chopped Roma tomato that I needed to use up. Served with some bread and butter for a great dinner. Thanks!

It is outstandingly tasty, this one. I do not expect my 4 year old to handle chick peas well, so I omitted them, and I used a small amount of crushed dry garlic for the same reason, instead of fresh. I added 3 minced marinated artichokes just because I had them in the fridge. As I write this it is in the kitchen, lukewarm and awaiting the chicken souvlaki that I will make with it. They will be great together. I can only describe it as .. smooth.  Surprisingly smooth, elegant flavors. Will definitely make this again :)

I really liked this recipe but made a couple of changes.  I don't like sun-dried tomatoes, too sweet, so I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and drained them.  I also omitted the garbanzo beans as I have a hard time with their texture.  Other than that, made it just as directed and loved it both warm and cold the next day.  Great, fast, easy recipe I felt healthy eating!

YUM! I have been looking for this recipe for a while.  I had this salad at a bridal shower, and I have been trying to find it ever since.  I used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth.  I opened two cans of chickpeas by accident, so I will have to make this again tomorrow to use them up. I will be making this when I have group functions, so I have a vegetarian option. So delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe:)

Gave 5 stars, but did change things up.  Used fresh tomatoes from bumper crop, fresh oregano, had made fresh pesto, so threw that on as a dressing, used all chicken broth, and added 1 boiled shredded chicken breast for substance since serving over greens for our entree.  Delicious!! Also doubled recipe and glad I did since we had two servings, it was so good.

I did several substitutions with this one. Used regular tomatoes instead of sun-dried and cucumber instead of olives, hoping that my mom who's not a fan of olives, will like it (she did not). I also sprinkled some garlic powder in the broth/water mix, instead of using regular garlic. Lastly, I used only half of the "dressing" since it was a bit too peppery for my taste. I did like the adjusted version. A really nice summer side dish!

I did not care for this one but others at the BBQ said they liked it.  When made according to recipe, it is a bit bland and needs some crunch. I thought the dried oregano was not a good addition. If attempted again I would use fresh oregano. I ended up using flat leaf parsley and Orange bell pepper while adding more salt and lemon juice. I also added some olive oil as recipe did not state whether to use oil packed sundried tomatoes and I only had the dried variety. I noticed the featured picture for the recipe looks to have ingredients that were not in the original recipe--interesting.

I omit the Feta because my husband doesn't care for it, but this is otherwise an absolute favorite in my house.

This recipe is fantastic! I always double the recipe and add one diced red pepper, 1/2 cup quartered artichoke hearts, and 1/2 cup palm hearts.

Great recipe - thank you!  I couldn't find the pearl couscous so I used the small grain kind.  Don't know if it made a difference, but the end result was definitely a hit.

This was a super simple but full of awesome flavor.  Huge hit in our family and I wouldn't change a thing.  Except maybe making it the day before so the flavors can develop even more.
Thanks!!

I think I put too many olives in... they were a little bit over powering.
