This is a nice recipe to spice up your veggies!  It is very flavorful.  It will be a good way to get in my vegetables this summer!  I omitted the egg, since I didn't feel like going through the trouble for one egg, and did not use the dry Italian dressing the second time I made this.  I think for the lemon juice it's important to use fresh lemon, or cut back some if you use the bottled, as it will probably be to tart.  Family will even eat their veggies this way, which doesn't always happen.
