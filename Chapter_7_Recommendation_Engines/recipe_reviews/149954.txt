I have wanted a perfect german meatball recipe for YEARS,this is even better than my german grandmothers!!!This tastes exactly like the meatballs I buy at a local deli that my family loves. I didn't have to modify anything in the ingredients, but I did sub the beef with elk, cause I have a freezer full!! I also rolled them in flour before frying. yummy, yummy yummy, I already wrote this in my family'a "holygrail" cookboook...

I made these meatballs to put into baked spaghetti. The flavor in this recipe is FANTASTIC...I served 6 people and even the picky eater ate them.  I liked the method of  soaking the bread in the milk beforehand, but needed to adjust the milk-bread ratio a bit because the meatballs ended up a bit mushy for my taste.  RECOMMEND!

My kinder are very picky about food.
They completely demolished this recipe.
Very tasty.  The butter is a must, it
absorbed well by the bread. ( I used an extra roll to reduce the potential sogginess of zie meatball.  Zer Gut!

I grated one half of an onion instead of mincing it and I made 1 inch meatballs instead of patties. I made no other changes. I made a homemade cream sauce to go over it (think Swedish Meatballs) and I served this with my own Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes and roasted broccoli and cauliflower. Nice moist meatballs with great flavor. Good combination with the Swedish Meatball sauce.

Very good mellow seasoning and the pork makes it very tasty.  Be sure to drain about 70% of the fat or you'll feel queasy after!  Flavors improve after a day.

Made recipe exactly and the whole family loved it. The leftovers were added to spaghetti sauce and again was well received.

Tasted absolutly fab. Whole family loved it.  I served them with brown gravy over egg noodles. The only problem I had was the meatballs tended to fall apart while frying so I had to tranfer them to a baking sheet and bake them.

Pretty tasty. I did try it plain (good taste) and with ketchup on top (still good but more meatloafy taste).

This was filling and it really stretched a pound of meat to several servings. These were very moist inside and had a nice crisp crust on the outside. I thought it was really bland though and it seemed to be screaming out for some type of sauce, or maybe that's just my southern cook thinking. My husband didn't care for this at all. It was okay but it just wasn't something we'd care to serve again here. Thanks though as I enjoyed trying out a new recipe :)

Great flavor in the meatballs!  Still trying to find a good sauce to complement them - we didn't love them with tomato sauce.

This is by far the best recipe for Fleischk√ºchle on this site.  I've read others that are being deep fried (yuck).  The only thing that I do different is I pad on some seasoned bread crumbs and they are always pan fried in butter, never baked or deep fried.  These taste so good by themselves, or with numerous side dishes.  I prefer German potato salad (the real stuff).

Amazing!  thanks a bunch!  I made it with speatzle from this site and poured gravy on all of it. I grew up there and never learned how to cook anything german, so this was a very nice treat for me.

I only had beef, still great. I put splash of worcestershire sauce in the mix. Then baked at 400 degrees till done. So yummy, I could eat them plain.

These were pretty run of the mill.  I served with brown gravy.  They were a little better the next day.  I'd make them again, maybe.  Just because it is decent, does not make it 5 stars.

Considering that one of our favorite foreign exchange students came from this region of Germany, I was anxious to try these and was not disappointed.  They were very good though, I did bake them instead of frying.  She had brought us some dried spatzle (sp) and I cooked those and had them on the side.  The whole meal was great!  It's a keeper!

I found the meat mixture too soft to hold a patty shape.  Next time I will use bread crumbs and a little milk instead of the rolls. But it was yummy

Made the recipe without changing a thing and I loved it! So happy to have found this. My mom used to make these when I was growing up, and I could never quite get it right when I tried to make them. We're from Bavaria (we always called them Fleischkuechle), so it's great to have a taste of home!
