I just wish in recipes like this, one would state cup measure of veggies since cukes and peppers vary in size. It would help with accuracy. 8 cukes well that is how much exactly? I'll guess but I wish I wouldn't have too.

Made 5 pints and tastes terrific - really easy.  My family doesn't tolerate green pepper well, so put in a red & yellow. Thanks, for the recipe.

My husband gave this a big thumbs up! Have now made this three times (great cucumber crop this season). So appreciate the details on jar processing since this is my first year canning.
Thank you for the recipe.

This is the best sweet relish I have ever tasted.  I make over 16 jars per year for family and friends.

I have been using this recipe for the last 3 years.  I love it and everyone I share it with does also and always wants more. Using my food processors makes it extremely easy. i cut back on the salt because I have to rinse it too many times to remove the salty taste.
Thank so much.

Mine did not look at all like the picture but it was easy to make and very tasty although quite sweet. Will try less sugar next time because I will make this again for sure!

I think this sweet relish had a good flavor.  I did add a tablespoon of pickling spice too.  The recipe is very easy, used the food processor to dice the veggies.

Sweet pickle relish 
Love it but this time added 1/2 t turmeric, 1/2 shredded carrot and stalk of shredded celery. Used 1 1/2 cider vinegar plus 1/2 saved sour pickle juice instead of full two cups cider vinegar. 
We shall see

Not sure if I will make this again.  Your directions did NOT say how many jars to prepare...... therefore I had way too much unnecessary work just with the jars!    This recipe makes about 6 cups relish.

This is really good but a little to sweet for my taste. Iâ€™ll make again but will cut the sugar back a bit.  I liked that the recipe used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.
