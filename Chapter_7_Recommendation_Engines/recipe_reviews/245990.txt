Simple and delicious! I only had regular green beans, so I just used those and green onions instead of regular. Great flavor combo...the family loved it~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So quick and easy to make!  Loved this recipe the only change was I had peas in the freezer and we used them instead of the  Beans.  We loved this recipe!

Absolutely fantastic.  I noticed a lot of the other reviewers added veggies they had on hand.  The recipe lends itself to all of it - whatever you choose.  We live in TN where bacon is a God-given right!  This recipe nails it all the way!

I used Kraft Toasted Sesame dressing in place of the Sesame oil and soy sauce. Tasted amazing and was cheaper. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make again!

I was a bit worried that it would be too much sesame oil (since it can have a really overpowering flavour) so I cut it down, but I think you can use the amount in recipe without worrying!! I also doubled the veggies ???? definitely a do again

Best fried rice I have ever made. I had 2 containers of left over Chinese white rice. I measured it out to 6 cups. I added 2 cups of frozen mixed vegies instead of just green beans. I also added 1 Tbs Rice Vinegar just before adding rice. It gave it a nice added flavor.

I used turkey bacon and added some peppers. Very good. Next time I'll try brown rice and cut bacon and veg's. into 1/2 in pieces. Corn and extra egg would be good too.

I had leftover rice and bacon to use up and this recipe fit the bill for a quick lunch bento in the work week. I crisped up the bacon and drained most of the grease, added diced onion and carrot, garlic, and rice. I seasoned with soy sauce then liberally with salt, garlic and onion powder until it tasted right. Tip: be mindful of just adding soy sauce to add flavor, too much can make your fried rice soggy and gummy. My suggestion is to add soy and then supplement with other spices in your cupboard!

Everyone liked it. Super easy and a great way to use a bunch of leftover veggies. The bacon made it more substantial (I mixed turkey and pork). I made it with two eggs, asparagus, broccoli, peppers, celery, and carrots. I think I'll try scallions next time. I'd like to find a spicier version, too.
