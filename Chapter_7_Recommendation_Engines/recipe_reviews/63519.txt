I really liked this recipe! The breading was great but did tend to fall apart. I think next time and there will be a next time, I will use the old tried and true method of dredge, egg, then crumb and I also think I'll do a deep fry number on them. The gravy was just to die for, my son, the little picky thing, just loved it! I used a little more butter in it and I used cornstarch to thicken instead of the flour. It really is a great recipe. Thanks Linda for sharing.

This recipe is a WINNER!  I made one minor change - as I usually do.  I used the leftover seasoned milk and seasoned flour to make the gravy.  My wife wants to increase the gravy mix and use it as a stew base.  I'm with her.  We will definitely do this one again!  Thanks Linda :-)

I just need a coating for the frog legs, the gravy did not seem interesting to me.

I am not into this "type" of food (with little feet); but based on my 5 & 6 year olds these were great, they ate them all up!

This was the best seasoning for frog legs. And the real trick is soaking them in the milk, it takes away the weird fishy flavor. I cantt eat fried stuff so I just tossed them with the spices, then sauteed them in bacon grease. Best frogs legs we've ever had. I bet they would be great fried too though.
The gravy however, I would rate at about a 3. Its nothing to write home about and takes the attention away from the frog. I won't bother with that in the future.
