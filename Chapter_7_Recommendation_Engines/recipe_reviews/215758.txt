This is very close to what I recall my grandmother making.  I did cut the allspice back to 1/4 tsp.  The next time I will use 6 apples since I thought there could me more filling in a 9" pie and I may cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup, but those are personal choices and no reflection on the recipe.  Thanks, Rosa!
