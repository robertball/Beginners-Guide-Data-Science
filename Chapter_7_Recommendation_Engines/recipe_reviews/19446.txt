I love raisin pie and this recipe is very good! I just made it for a large family gathering and I've had requests for the recipe. I did, however omit the nutmeg, I don't usually add any type of spice to raisin pie because that's the way I prefer it. I will be making this pie again, and soon!

This is a wonderful and easy raisin pie! I used a graham cracker crust and added a pinch of cinnamon to the mixture.  It was very tasty.

To improve this recipe, add 2 Tablespoons cider vinegar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. The vinegar and spices are what make the recipe delicious and fragrant.The perfect pie for the holidays. And it travels well.

I was introduced to Raisin Sour Cream Pie by American Salmon farmers with origins to Norway and Sweden in the early 1990s. I thought it was crazy and that no such thing existed (because I am first generation Mexican). I was blown away by the pie (they put the meringue on top of it), and have NEVER found it again. I was blessed to find this recipe, but I would definitely let up on the raisins, use maybe 1/2 a cup, and add during half of the cooking time, otherwise, they all sink to the bottom).  Also, I would use slightly less sugar. I have a SEVERE sweet tooth, and this was too sweet, but a GREAT pie recipe!!! Try it, play with it. You'll be glad you did!!!

I found the recipe to be short on the filling, so I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and used a Tenderflake Deep Dish pie crust.

I like to plump the raisins before mixing them in.  I prefer a softer raisin.

I increased the recipe by 1/2 for a Tenderflake deep dish pie shell.  It made too much, so I made a dozen tarts from the extra.  I made a booboo and put too much sugar into the filling, but I also added the cider  vinegar, cinnamon and cloves.  Still a very nice pie, next time I will not increase the amount of filling, so the sugar amount will be right.  Maybe the deep dish pie shells arenâ€™t as deep as they used to be.

This is very good and easy. I have made it a few times. You can use either white or dark raisins, just soak them for an hr. then drain them before you add them to the pie.

I lost my very old recipe for Sour Cream Raisin Pie more than 20 years ago.  Through the years I've tried other recipes for it but none were just right, so I was prepared to be disappointed again.  Much to my surprise, this tasted just the way  I remembered, so I will certainly making it again.  It's just right!

We substituted Splenda for the sugar, and cinnamon for the nutmeg. The Splenda condensed, so we made one and a half fillings. flavor turned out well.
