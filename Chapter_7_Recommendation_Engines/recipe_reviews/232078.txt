We liked it, added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and some mushrooms and zucchini just because I have an abundance right now. I may cut the pepper flakes in the future for the little one, but it was good for the hubby and I.

This was a very easy and yummy meal.  I made a couple of changes for our preferences.  I browned the chicken and veggies in coconut oil and used Bragg's liquid amino's instead of regular soy sauce.  Could have used a bit more sauce, but it was very good!  Will definetly  make again.

I thought it was very tasty. Rest of family was not fond of the orange flavor.
