Milk must be steamed first before shots are pulled.  When all 3 ingrediants are combined at the same time the latte has more of a carmely taste rather than bitter.

When you steam the latte with the vanilla syrup the froth on top will taste awefully good.

Not my "cup of tea"as I'm not a fan of these type coffee drinks,  but Hubs enjoyed it for a weekend treat -  both making it (he does love that espresso machine and frother thingy) and drinking it. I have to say it was pretty!

The first time I made this drink was quite a few years ago. I found a recipe on line to make my own vanilla syrup. The vanilla syrup is so easy to make and so much cheaper. I would only add 1 to 2 teaspoons. It is very sweet. Even now, I just prefer the milk and coffee. I have whisked the milk with an Aerolatte after microwaving it, warmed in a small pot with a whisk, and the way I currently do it with a Nespresso milk frother which keeps it the thickest.

What to do when you don't have an espresso machine? I warmed the milk, frothed it with my magic frother wand, added a packet of Starbucks Via Italian Roast Coffee, added  Madagascar Vanilla, and frothed some more. I added a little whipped cream and cinnamon on top. Mmmmm good!

I don't have an espresso machine, so I use 1/2 c milk to 1/2 c strong brewed coffee. I heat and whisk the milk on the stovetop (which I learned from this site). I only put 1 T coffee syrup in, and that was plenty sweet for me. I'd like to try some raw sugar on top of the foam next time, which another reviewer suggested.

Good ratio for flavor! I though I would like whole milk more, but 2% keeps it from being too sweet.

I heated the milk on a sauce pan. Used a hand held battery operated whisk to froth the milk.

You want to steam the milk before pulling the espresso shot to prevent the espresso from expiring. Typically I make this using 8 oz. of milk.
