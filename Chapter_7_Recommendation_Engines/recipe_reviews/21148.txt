In order to get authentic tasting chile rellenos, you should use a couple of eggs, seperated.  Whip the whites w/an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  Beat the yolks seperatley and fold them into the whites (preseverving the volume of the whites).  Then you can dip the stuffed chiles into the egg...and don't worry about slopping it on.  You want the entire chile covered.  When your chile comes out of the oil, you'll have a nice fluffy coating...rather than a heavy egg-y tasting batter that most homemade recipes call for.

An easy way to char your chiles is to heat up the broiler in your oven and toss the peppers directly on to the racks.  (Poblano's can be substituted w/great results). You want the entire surface to be browned and blistered, so you will have to flip them occasionally.  Then, stick the peppers in a zip-lock and let them steam for about 1/2 an hour or so.  When you return to them, they'll be cool enough to handle, and the skin will be really easy to peel off!!  Make sure not to remove the stems when you slit open the chiles to remove the seeds and membranes.
Follow these tips, and you will have one tasty little treat!!
Also, I use white cheese rather than cheddar (I use Oaxacan cheese...but for areas where Mexican cheese isn't available, Monterey Jack is a good substitute)

My husband thought these were very good, I thought they were decent.  Something has to really blow me away to give it 5 stars. I followed one of the suggestions below and also did some research on authentic chile rellenos.  I don't know the exact type of chile's I had, a friend gave me some from her garden.  To char them, I tossed them in an 8x8 pan and put the oven on broil and rotated them as they would brown and blister.  when all sides were done, I put them in a ziplock bag to steam.  I returned to them about 45 min. later and they were cool enough to handle and the skin came off so easily. After slitting and cleaning out the peppers, I stuffed them with the cheddar cheese strips. The only ingredient I used for the batter was some eggs and a bit of flour....I took 3 eggs, separated them, and beat the whites until they were stiff and formed peaks. Then I beat the yolks with 1 TBsp. flour until they were pasty. I folded this mixture into the egg whites and stirred gently.  Then I rolled the stuffed chiles in flour and slopped on the egg mixture.  The batter puffed up beautifully when fried and really makes the authentic chile rellenos. I topped mine with warmed mild salsa. Husband gobbled them up! I am glad to have another dish to add to my collection.  Thanks to Panchita and the reviewers below mine.

This was the best and easiest recipe for rellenos, I tweaked it just a little  and instead of going thru the hassle of cutting the cheese, I used string cheese, the combo stick with cheddar and mozzarella cheese, I sliced it in ½ (long way) and with that, I was able to get 2 rellenos out of one stick, it fries nicely and it doesn’t splatter like some cheeses do..  I made a tomato gravy type sauce to pour over the rellenos, that calls for one can of diced tomato with juice, 3 finely chopped celery sticks, ½ cup finely chopped onions, 2 finely chopped fresh jalapenos (remove seeds and membrane) and handful of chopped cilantro, sauté celery, onions, and jalapenos till soft, let cool and pour into blender, add the can of diced tomatoes, cilantro and blend till smooth, season with garlic salt and pepper to taste,   Just pour the amount you want over the rellenos,

My husband loved these and told me I could make them every week.  They really are good.  I did take the advise of other reviewers and beat the egg whites separate then folded them into the rest of the batter.  It made the batter nice and fluffy.  Also, I used Jack cheese as I prefer rellenos with a white cheese, otherwise I followed the recipe.  The best salsa to use with these is "Tomatillo Salsa Verde" submitted by Kimberly.  Give it a try!

I'm spoiled I guess... I've lived in Southern California all my life, and love Mexican food of all types. For me, Anaheim peppers are too mild, and I'll go for the Poblano any day (and who said Poblanos were "screaming hot"? They're pretty mild...) So, I used Poblanos, of course.
These were not too difficult to make (time intensive, yes. Difficult? No) but the result was not worth the effort for me when I can easily go buy really good rellenos.
I'm used to a softer batter - not the crispy, fried-fish like texture of these. Done with good cheese though, they are a reasonable substitute if you just can't get to decent Mexican food.
While I enjoyed these, they were not what I was expecting from a Relleno. They got three stars because they were still quite tasty, and had I not been expecting a specific result, I would have loved them.
Definitely worth doing for fun and a taste of Mexico if you're just dying for it.

I found it easier to seed the chiles before roasting them so that they don't tear up much.  Also, be sure to completely coat the stuffed pepper with meringue, which acts as insulation against the oil.

You must use "Big Jims" to get the proper flavor/spice/taste.  That is the long skinny green chile.  These were very rich!  We only needed two a piece with a side of black beans and rice for a VERY filling meal.  For the batter I used 4 eggs, separated.  Whipped the whites and then blended the yolks separately with 1 TBSP of flour and some salt and then whip into the whites.  Dip the chiles into some flour and then into the batter and place seam side down into the pan.  Yum, yum but I still prefer the local hole in the wall chile rellenos and much less work when someone else makes them!

This recipe was excellent and I impressed the hell out of my girlfriend whom had tried this same dish at a restaurant we went to just a couple of weeks prior. I was told that mine was much better than the place we had dined at. WOOHOOO thank you !!! Make sure you separate the eggs beating the whites first then beating the yolks and then folding the yolks into the whites, then add your batter ingredients, it turned out amazingly well :)

This dish was fantastic.  My boyfriend wanted seconds and even thirds.  I used the canned whole chiles and added monterey jack in with the cheddar.  It turned out very well.  The only downside was that the batter made a huge mess afterward.  Oh well, that's what 409 is for.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks.

These rellenos were so delicious and easy to make. We live in southwest New Mexico were we can buy rellenos all the time, but I was in search of a good recipe to make them. I am happy to say I finally found one that is a keeper! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Although I've not tried this one yet, I do intend to do so.  These are the kind of Rellenos I grew up on when I lived on the border.  Mexican food varies by region based on what is most readily available.  Throughout the border area along the New Mexico/Far West Texas area, Green chile is a common ingredient in Mexican food.  It is also commonly used for Chile Rellenos.  Hatch, New Mexico is also know as the Chile Capital of the world which is in this region.  Other parts of Mexico use Poblano.  Both create authentic dishes even though they are different peppers.   

When using Long Green chile (Anaheim, Big Jim etc.) try to get chiles that are straight and not curled up or twisted.  Roast them in your oven under the broiler or put them on your grill.  Turn them as the chile skin is charred.  Once the skin is charred, put them in a plastic bag or a bowl covered with plastic for about 30 minutes.  The skins should then come off very easily.

Terrible attempt at a great Mexican dish. I think a gringo over heard the concept of chile rellanos and attempted to Americanize it . I would suggest finding a recipe that uses no flour only egg whites, polbano peppers and queso fresco or queso blanco.

Excellent recipe!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and was soooo very happy to serve authentic Chile Rellenos!  I served these with Macayo's Enchilada sauce (thickened slightly with some extra Monterey Jack cheese) and spanish rice and beans.  Great Meal!  Will definitely add these to the Recipe Box!

I blackened my peppers under the broiler and peeled them after steaming them in a paper bag for a few minutes.  I tried removing the stems and seeds after blackening and steaming, but the pepper tore up pretty easily, so I would do it beforehand next time.  I dipped each peeled pepper in an egg wash, rolled them in Panko bread crumbs, and baked at 350 for 10 minutes rather than frying.  Delicious!  It didn't taste too different from restaurant chile rellenos but was much healthier without all the oil.  That said, this was quite time consuming, but they were fun to make.

I agree with a previous reviewer that whipping the eggs whites and folding in the yolks is an absolute must for the batter. With really hot oil it cooks up light very light and melts in your mouth. I also used pepper jack cheese, as it was all I had in the house, and loved it. This may very well be my favorite dish.

This recipe was easy but charing them was very time consuming,they didn't look like the chile rellenos I'm youst to, so I didn't know if they where going to taste right, I served them with red sauce and every one said they tasted great.

I found this to be really easy and delicious. I grilled poblano peppers on my grill, peeled them after cooling. I cut some pepper jack into thick strips and inserted one into a small hole poked into the top of each pepper. Then I dipped in the batter (which was perfect) and fried them up. Served with salsa and sour cream. Amazing.

Chili Rellenos, and their variations, are always my favorite.  I use Tempura Batter Mix, it's quick and easy.  Mix using beer instead of water until the desired consistency is met.  I also use strips of velveeta cheese, I love the taste and it melts faster than cheddar or jack.  Also, try leaving the seeds and membranes in the pepper, I never remove them, some peppers are hot and some are not.  I love the Poblano peppers, but all the peppers mentioned are a great choice.  And, lastly, definitely use Canola oil.  It's less greasy than vegetable oil and more healthly.

I have always wanted to cook chile rellenos but was intimidated.  This took a lot of steps but it came out great. I used very mild banana peppers from my own garden and a mexican cheese blend. I separated the eggs for the batter, as directed in several reviews, and they turned out fantastic. I plan on using a pepper and or cheese with more kick next time. This one is a keeper!

Fabulous! My DH was impressed! I followed suggestions from other cooks & beat my egg whites before folding into batter. I used Poblano chiles and stuffed with a good thick slice of Monterey Jack cheese. It was as good as any I've had at restaurants. Will definitely make again!

These are decent. But I would strongly suggest using pasilla peppers/poblano my mom has always made them with thouse and they are the absolute best. Some times she makes them in this hot red salsa and the flavors mix so well in a hot tortilla. Yum!! Definately try poblano...she even leaves a few seeds in to make it spicier.

These were very yummy - I impressed myself with my first attempt at chile rellenos (lol - I'm a gringa!!) I simplified the batter per other reviews - just egg (separated, whip the whites then fold in yolk with 1 Tbsp flour and milk).  Will definitely do this again - thanks panchita!!

I absolutely love mexican food (hubby is not a big fan, but he is out), & I order chile rellenos every time we go out to my favorite cantina (hubby gets "shrimp cocktail"....yep thats right an appetizer).  I took a pass on the chedder cheese, (subbing manchego) and regret cutting the top off of the pepper (I used pablano) because by doing that, it made it somewhat of a "grease scoop", I would suggest slitting it on the side, carefully removing the seeds & then stuffing them.    I just didn't like this fried.  I liked the batter, it was very tasty, but I'll either micro steam them or just leave it to my buddies at the resturant to treat me right.  Thank Panchita ;)

This is wonderful! We love Chili Rellenos and this recipe was very close to authentic. I  subed mexican cheese (found  at most grocery stores in the cheese section) and served with a  homemade sauce given to me  by a friend (it is his mothers enchilada sauce recipe). Truely delicious!

I had a really hard time peeling the peppers, I'm betting there is a trick to it, so it took me a REALLY long time.  Otherwise, it was great.

Thanks for the Recipe! Very delicious by itself or smothered with red chile! My daughter now loves both green and red chili after having this dinner. I love the batter recipe and use it with multiple other recipes!

This was alright. I enjoyed the basic taste but I found the batter to be bland and I recommend battering them twice before frying. Sauce is a must with this recipe. Enchilada sauce worked just fine. All in all I prefer to get these at a restaurant because they didn't wow me enough for the amount of work.

Great recipe! I used Poblano peppers for this and also added seasoned ground beef to the cheese filling. The advice to whip the egg white seperately from the yolk before adding to the coating ingredients was great! the batter puffed up so well it looked like a restaurant quality relleno! This recipe is easy, but labor intensive. Make sure you have plenty of time to devote to this since  you have to broil the peppers and sweat them in a bag to remove the skin. I'll make these again for sure. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!   I have made them twice now with poblano peppers (I found the smaller ones easier to work with).  I first roasted them under the broiler until bubbling and the skin has black spots, stuck them in the plastic bag to steam awhile then peeled the skins.  Split them and gently took out the seeds.  Stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese and stuck tooth picks through the peppers making sure to go though the cheese also to hold them together ( I will buy longer toothpicks next time since they get lost after they are battered and fried).    I loved the taste of the batter but if you like a lite batter look for recipes that use whipped egg whites; this one is heavier!  Served with red enchilada sauce, rice and beans... :)

Rave reviews for these authentic chiles rellenos.
I made them for just 4 Chile Poblanos. Gave one to a neighbor who loved it.
Had to learn how to get the skins off, Panchita taught me. Tomorrow I make them for 30 people!
I used Poblano chilies, canned El Patio sauce, and San Juan cheese.

These turned out great!! I also took the advice of whipping the egg white separate from the yolk then folding together. I used Monterey jack cheese too. I only had 6 peppers but made the whole recipe for batter and used it all - I def wouldn't have had enough to fully coat 12 peppers!

I made this but I added a few more things....takes longer to make but really good.  I stuffed the peppers with cheese and seasoned ground turkey.  I find the cheese ones are missing something...After I fried they I threw them in the oven and topped them with cheese..YUMMMM!!! I also made a tomato sauce....using some chicken stock, a whole onion cut up in small pieces  some diced up garlic and a can of diced tomato let is simmer until all onion is really soft.  take chiles out of the oven and top off with your sauce totally DELISH!!!

All the way through this recipe I was sure it would be a disaster. I am familiar with broiling chiles and peeling them, but they can be delicate and it is difficult to scoop out the seeds. The batter was messy, but despite seeming like they would fall apart, the chiles held up better than expected. Even after letting the chiles sit for awhile, causing them to be soft rather than crispy, the taste was still quite good! However, these make horrible leftovers as they get soggy and gooey. Overall, a good recipe, but I live in Arizona and I'll pay $8.95 at a resturant to avoid going through that again. Messy, time consuming, and complicated.

A truly rich and delicious side dish or main dish with a Mexican flair. Fresh roasted chile is best, but canned green chile works too.

Roasting and peeling the chilis was the hardest part, g.otta figure out and easier way to get cheese into  chili. It was worth all the work! I did add an extra beaten egg white that made the batter puff up wonderfully.

I used some of the recommendantions from other reviews. I used poblano peppers instead of anaheim because we like our stuff spicy. I beat the egg white until fluffy then folded in the yolk and added to the batter. The coating came out so perfectly crunchy and light! I sat the chiles on some spanish vermicelli with salsa and put a dollop of sour cream on top of the chile. This was absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to make these again!

Hubby was kind enough to help roast peppers this year, so I had to make his favorite.  Normally, I cook these in a cast iron skill, but since the deep fryer was already out, I decided to use it instead.  Probably wasn't one of my better ideas.  I made a bigger mess than it was worth and they didn't fry up as nice as they would in a skillet.  The only thing that I don't like about this recipe is the cheddar cheese.  In my opinion, rellenos are best with a Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack if you like extra heat. What I do like about this recipe is the batter.  It's a heavy, pancake like batter.  As soon as it hits the skillet, it puffs and seals quickly so the cheese doesn't ooze all over which is one of the tricky and often frustrating aspects of making rellenos.

The first time I used this recipe, I made about 25 Chile Relleno's for my family and friends and they loved it, and NO left overs. When I ask them what everyone wanted for Christmas dinner, everyone said please make the Chile Relleno's. Hands down this is the best recipe. I won't be using another recipe for sure.

This recipe was almost a total fail.  The batter was soooo thick.  Even after following the recommendations to use 2 eggs and whip the whites it was just a thick goop.  The first two rellenos had so much goopy batter that cooked up and slid right off the pepper they were a disaster.  So I added a third egg and just enough milk to make the batter a normal, although thick consistency.  I also skipped the first dip in flour as that just made the batter not stick at all.  With the milk I was able to dip and coat the entire pepper.  I used Anaheim peppers and they were just right for my taste, just hot enough but not overwhelming.  My husband who has a higher tolerance didn't think they were hot at all.

Here's some tips that might help you:
-- use toothpicks to help keep the cheese inside
-- then dip in the batter (making sure you separated the egg white/yolk and whipped whites to soft peaks)

--> Someone please explain how to broil then "steam" the skins... broiling alone didn't seem to do the trick.

--> I fried my first batch, and will bake the second batch, in the oven like a casserole, keeping the chiles separate.

--> I used passilla chiles and queso cheese (this kind of cheese doesn't "liquify" at higher temps).

--> Like tamales, these are time intensive, so make them with a friend!

Bland, I followed thew other reviews with whipping the eggs and the flower, but man it was a pain to make. I could not figure out how to keep the cheese in the pepper, then I could not keep the egg mix on the pepper. mine came out messy and greasy. My hubby thinks we should try it again with a different cheese. I might try again.

These were primo! I think the secret to "undressing" the peppers is freshness.  I got mine at the local farmers' market and cooked them same day. The skins came off almost in one piece! The batter is wonderful and easy to do--a hit with my family and me.  I have always wanted to try chile rellenos but was intimidated (I don't know why).  No more--these are great and I will keep making them and making them.

We live nowhere near any Mexican restaurants, so it has been over a year since I've had a chile relleno!  I was reallly craving them!  My husband is allergic to eggs, so I had to modify the recipe slightly by using egg-replacer.  I was hoping these would still turn out somewhat fluffy, but no luck.  The batter was more like wnat you have on the fish in "fish n' chips".  Still I was happy to have something resembling chile rellenos!  The recipe was a lot of work, and if I lived anywhere remotely near somewhere that served chile rellenos, I would not spend the effort to make these.  But at least they satisfied my craving and my husband got to try a chile relleno for the first time.

This was my first time making rellenos and it was easy and tasted great. This recipe is for crispy "gringo" rellenos (which my husband and I both prefer)as opposed to the authentic soft rellenos that other reviewers made and were looking for. I used mild Hatch green chiles(already roasted) and stuffed them with a strip of white mexican cheese. They came out nice and crispy and we topped them off with homemade green chile and served them with ranch style beans over rice. I also seasoned the batter up with some taco seasoning. Yum-O! THanks for the great recipe!

This is a good recipe for the batter. Topped with a flavorful green chile and pork sauce, Spanish rice, and refritos, this is a favorite in my family.

I used roasted Big Jim chiles.

I just made this, and my husband and I both love it.  I have always loved the chile rellenos in a particular Mexican buffet style restaurant in Houston, but couldn't find them made that way anywhere else.  This recipe is the closest I've had.  I made only one small change...I used Pepper Jack cheese.

This is very similar to how my mother used to make chiles rellenos.  But she grated jack cheese, added oregano and chopped green onion.  Then she would make tubes from the mixture and stuff the chile.  I"m not a fan of cheddar cheese on Mexican food.

This was a good recipe.
I did get very frustrated when trying to peel the peppers though. Next time I'll have to do some more research on it.
The breading was definitely delicious. It was a lot easier to use then whipped egg whites.

A good start, but I changed up a few things.  I used RedRobyn's suggestion on the eggs - love that!  I only used flour, eggs and panko for my breading.  First dipped in flour.  Then in the eggs.  Then in the panko (japanese bread crumbs).  They came out really crispy and delicious!  Will totally have these again.

This recipe is great!!! all it needs to be more than great is the red sauce that goes on the chile rellenos. I used spicey pablano peppers which were the best I have a family of 8 and this was easy to prepare and fast to cook serve with beans and rice along the side makes the best mexican meal outside , going out to eat

I beat egg whites and then yolks separately and fold into whites.  To speed up the process, canned whole green chilies works well for a weeknight meal.  Also, instead of dipping chili in egg batter, put a little oil in a skillet (you don't need it an inch deep), heat, then put a line of the egg, kind of the shape of the chili in the pan, let it cook just a bit to start to set up, place the chili on top of the egg, then put more egg over the top of the chili.  You end up with nice coverage of the pepper.  One more tip.  We used to have a restaurant in our town that made crab chili rellenos.  Along with the cheese (monterey jack or pepper jack), insert a little crab in each one.  Yummy!

You can also roast the chiles on your burner over the fire until the skin is charred. Put the chiles in a plastic bag... helps in removing the skin. Add so seasoning like salt and white pepper to the batter for flavor.... taste it. Sounds gross but how do you know the flavor unless you taste it. Makes sense right? Not sure about the cheddar though... I'd use jack or pepper jack, but that is my taste preference. Good recipe.

Wow...way time consuming. Removing the skins was a HUGE pain. I blistered them on my gas range then put them in a zip lock bag for over 30 minutes. The skins were not easy to peel. The batter part was very messy. The flavors just weren't there. I would suggest using poblanos instead of Anaheim. I will not be making these again!!!

Ok, so maybe I really messed this one up.  I mean it was so messy making them.  So time consuming and oily to boot!  I had big expectations, read all the reviews for guidance and maybe this just isn't my area... I really had my hands full with this one and it worn me out.

Back in NY for several years after 18 years of living in Los Angeles left me craving my beloved Chile Rellenos! This recipe was very good and I will definitely use it again! I used Cacique Ranchero cheese instead of cheddar and I would have preferred screaming hot Poblano Chile peppers if I could only find them here!
Muchas Gracious Panchita!

I made these for my husband for Cinco de Mayo, and I have to say they are AWESOME!!  The batter is THE BEST.  They are just as good as any restaurant. Since it was my first time dealing with Anaheim's (charring) I was afraid at what might happen, but I could not have been more pleased.  Both my husband & myself really, really loved.  Thanks Panchita!!!
Oh, next time I am going to stuff with cheese & chorizo.  I can't wait!

I made a scaled-down version of this recipe with two large peppers. Everything worked well--the coating was fabulous. Just lacked a little flavor. Maybe I'll use sharp cheddar next time instead of medium.

Turned out delicious - be aware the batter is WAY thick and you may need to spoon some of it onto any missed spots.  Also, you will get messy & the chile’s are very fragile.

Moms homemade batter is super hard to mimic & seriously time consuming, so came here for a faster do-able recipe. Mine are usually not as put together & don't look great like moms.. Used all measurements listed w/a couple tweeks. I like the yellow-ish tint in my batter so I added an extra yolk. Also changed the cheese. I loooove ooey gooey cheese that mimics my all time fav restaurant 1s. Oaxaca Melting Cheese is a fav i like to use for these, its AMAZING, promise! Hubbs said they were my best 1s yet! Thnx for sharing this great & tasty recipe. :)

Made it with shredded chihuahua cheese. Let the batter sit for about 20 min as Chiles were prepared. Then I filled them with cheese, dredged them in flour, and then half recipe at a time in batter and into oil in frying pan. Got very crispy and nicely brown. Perfect. really nice batter that held up.

These are the CRUNCHY kind of chile rellenos...my favorite kind!  All the people telling you to whip the egg whites are trying to make this recipe into the traditional puffy non-crunchy batter chile rellenos!  Don't get them confused!  If you put sauce on top of the crunchy ones, it doesn't break down the nice crunch as quickly...that's why I like them better.  My problem is I can never take out the seeds and veins without cutting through the whole pepper, so I always have to use toothpicks to hold them together while frying...a mouth hazard!

Good basic recipe, though this is the type of recipe that needs a good list of variations. Being from New Mexico, there are other chilies you can use to raise or lower the fire to taste. There are a variety of cheeses you can use. Most importantly, there are a variety of options about what you stuff your chilies with: Precooked and spiced chicken, pork or beef, or a variety of soy products and beans for the vegetarians in the crowd. You can go vegan with a little imagination. What this does, very nicely, is demystify the process that can seem a little daunting to people who do not have experience deep frying. Because the rellenos are long and thin, you can easily fry them in a cast iron skillet with a minimum of oil (only about an inch). Another way to up the heat is to leave the seeds in. Should have included a link in the notes about charring the chilies; fresh is always best.

Just a hint to help you with roasting the long green chile prior to stuffing it.  I find it easiest and quickest to roast them in the oven. Rinse, pat dry and lay green chiles on flat foil-lined pan. Pierce each chile with small knife to prevent their bursting. Set oven at BROIL then watch to see as the green chile skin browns lightly, not char black!, then turn chile over using tongs.  Repeat same as the other side. The chile skin should peel off easily, so rinse lightly and you are ready for the next stepin the recipe. 
Hint...  Fresh roasted long green chiles can all be stuffed, with cheese, or thoroughly cooked meats or cooked chicken. or be creative!

Note: Use gloves, these peppers have oils that will linger.  I followed the recommendation of another, by beating the whites then adding the beaten yolk.  I don't know if it's needed or not, but I broke a toothpick in half to secure the seam and pulled it out before serving.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Loved the base of the recipe just changed the pepper to sweet long peppers(broiled) and added hamburger meat to the stuffing and cilantro to the batter topped with salsa and sour cream. I too found it better than eating out because the last time I ate this at a restaurant the peppers tasted like they were in the freezer way too long. Fresh is best. Thank you.

I had been CRAVING chiles rellenos when I found this recipe and couldn't WAIT to try it out. I'm new to cooking so I try to stay away from complicated recipes; this one seemed easy enough. I even checked out other members' entries to try to get some pointers. It was messy and didn't turn out quite how I expected. I prefer crunchy rellenos and these were fluffy - which I know appeals to lots of people. Broiling them and peeling them was easy. I ended up having to pan-fry them which was the messy part. All in all, they were disappointing but I realize this may have been because my expectations were too high. Maybe it'll work out better next time.

I was a little dissapointed with the batter as it did not turn out "poufy" like the chile rellenos I am used to.  However, my friend from Mexico loved them.  I did substitute muenster cheese for the cheddar, which turned out nicely.

I'm not a big relleno lover but hubby is & he gave these 4 stars. We used a mexican blend of cheese instaed of cheddar & added some well seasoned ground beef. We did a Mexican theme night & started the meal off w/ Grilled Poblano Pepper and Mango Quesadillas & Banana Margeritas. Then we served the Rellenos w/ Easy 'Charro' Beans, warm corn tortillas w/ butter & Margarita Cake for dessert...very enjoyable dinner!

When I  make this I  mainly use Hatch Chiles or if I'm out the canned green anaheim's. I'm not a fan of the poblano. I also use Boars Head  Chipotle  Gouda Cheese which I find ads a little kick and really like the flavor

I had my niece make them and didn't like them. The batter tasted like egg you use for French  Toast and were heavy and greasy. I am Mexican/American And have NEVER heard of stuffing pepper with Cheddar Cheese.  I use as most do Chihuahua cheese. I'm assuming this is an updated American version. You need to use several eggs, separate yolks, and use mixer to make egg whites stiff. Also there was a remark from Spencer and Serena who said Poblanos are not hot. Untrue. Depending on when you pick them will determine the heat. I've had some so hot I was afraid to eat them.

Again I switched the oil from canola to olive oil, you can also use coconut oil if you watch the heat level.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to do with a little practice.  I only use poblanos.  Panchita,  I would love to have the recipe for the rice dish in the pic.  Can't seem to find it anywhere.

Okay!  Finally a relleno that looks like a proper relleno!  I am Mexican and this is how my mother and grandmother made their chiles rellenos and how I make mine.  And we all use Anaheim chiles and sharp cheddar cheese.  The only difference is we salt the flour, dredge the chiles in it and pat off the excess.  Depending on how many chiles you are frying, you separate your eggs.  Whip up the whites, fold in the yolks, dip your chiles in the batter and fry.   They are labor intensive and absolutely worth it.  If you follow this recipe, you will be making rellenos autenticos.

We always use Jack Cheese in our rellenos.  Most of the time we use the canned chili’s.  Rinse them and pate dry.  Most important part is to roll chilies in flour or the batter will not stick to the chilies.   And like most here have noted ,  beat the egg whites until stiff then fold in the yokes.

These rellenos were so good. That said,  I swapped the cheddar for a white cheese blend. It's still very good with white cheese.

This is a very authentic recipe.  It came out very well and tasted just fabulous, using super fresh chiles and super fresh queso fresco.   I have to admit, it was one of the hardest dishes I have ever made.   It's labor intensive, and frying the chiles with the fluffy batter takes some skill.   My changes:  I agree with another cook, clean out the seeds and membranes of the chiles before roasting.  I tried it both ways, since i had a dozen chiles to make, and the pre-cleaned chiles were done quickly.  The chiles that were not pre-cleaned were easier to get the skins off, but took double the time to very carefully clean out the seeds and membranes, and the water does wash away flavor.  They are so delicate once they're cooked!  
I also doubled the batter recipe.  I added a good amount of salt to the flour , based on the comments of other cooks, so the end result was flavorful.  The batter was a lot of work to beat those egg whites, but SOOOO worth it!  I ran out of the egg batter with the last 3 chiles, so I basically just used the dusting flour  with the remaining liquid egg and those turned out ok.  Next time, for a dozen chiles, I will use 5 eggs so there will be enough batter.  Also, the technique for coating the chiles with just the right amount of fluffy batter takes a minute to get the hang of.   You have to move quickly and gently, or they will be smothered.  That's probably why I ran out at the end.  The first few were over-battered, due to my lack of skill.   Overall

I just followed Panchita's excellent recipe and instructions.  It was my first time to use this method.  The classic method of separating the yolks from the whites and beating the whites adding the yolks at the end is just a pain to me.  This recipe will be my "go to" recipe from now on.  DELICIOUS!  During the Hatch harvest season one store in our town roasts them out in front at the entrance, it removed one step in the preparation.

I've made chili rellanos before but never with this batter recipe.  Love it so much!!.  Just another hint.  After toasting the chilis over the flame allow them to cool a little bit.  Place the chilis, while still warm, in a plastic zip lock bag, zip the bag.   The warmth will help make the chilis easier to peel. Leave them in the bag for at least 15 minutes.  Remove them one by one.  Use a butter knife to lightly scrape the chilis and you'll see how easy the skin removes.  One more thing remove the stem while taking out the seeds as well.

Sadly, as a native New Mexican stranded in Spain, I was forced to use poblanos. Very disappointing as the flavor was simply not there, but, the recipe itself was spot on. I did go with the suggestion of roasting the chiles in the oven and steaming and  separating the egg for a more fluffy fry.  I used sharp cheddar and then drenched the finished product in green chile enchilada sauce from El Paso brand. Made up a bit for flavor but I desperately miss Anaheims. New Mexico I need you.

A huge flop for me.  The batter wouldn't stick to the pepper so it was coated very unevenly.  The result was a partially coated fried pepper, not at all like the picture.

As a native of El Paso, TX, You'd think I could get good chiles rellenos anywhere. Not so. Their batter is usually heavy and soggy, and the chiles are drenched in a sauce.  These are light and crispy, no sauce needed and are very tasty. I'd take this recipe to My favorite restaurant, but they'd probably be insulted. So darn the mess, I'll make them at home!

I have tried many different chile rellenos recipes, and this batter is fabulous, better than going to the hassle of using a lot of egg whites, and the result is excellent. 

 I used 6 poblano peppers (broiled, charred, peeled, seeds removed).  I used two kinds of Mexican cheese (sliced 1/2" x 2" firm Casero (white) cheese and a spoonful of Requezo (similar to ricotta).  Great flavor and the Requezo helps seal the peppers.  Then I rolled them in flour. 

 The batter was too thick to dip the peppers, so I spread a layer of batter on one side of the pepper,  then dropped the battered side of the pepper in the hot oil (I only use about 1/4" of oil).  I then spread a layer of batter on the other side while the pepper browned.  They came out light and fluffy.   I kept them warm in the oven at 350 degrees til all six were done.  I used a can of enchilada sauce, thickened with some cornstarch and water, for the sauce.  Thank you for this great recipe, it's a keeper!

I love this batter! In my opinion it is much better than the more  traditional batter with the whipped egg whites. I think it stays on the chile's better and has better flavor.  I use poblano peppers because I like the flavor better. This time I browned hamburger, let it cool and mixed in shredded Colby jack and chihuahua cheese for the filling. They turned out really good.

This was my first attempt at making  Chile's Rellenos so  I  first had to search instructions how to roast Poblano peppers.  After that I followed the recipe but I mostly used Quesadilla cheese and a piece of yellow cheese.  The  batter is prefect and oh so light.  I will make this again but will probably roast the peppers the day before.

These were absolutely delicious, however I separated the eggs and whipped the whites until stiff then folded them into the batter. I also used Pablano chili's and mozzarella cheese then covered in red chili (enchalada sauce) and cheese.

I made this recipe with Poblano peppers because I accidentally bought them instead of the chile peppers.  I did char them first and then followed the rest of the recipe.  Topped them with guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  Delicious!  Will be making these again soon.

this recipe fails to mention that you need to soften the peppers. to do that I broil them until they're charred. then I put them in a sealed plastic Ziploc bag. and beat the egg and milk to soft peaks. fold into the flour mixture. this is the authentic way of making these. i use poblano peppers over the Anaheim. they're spicier.

I think slicing them down the middle and deseeding them while they are still strong and hard (before charring and peeling the skin) would be easier than when they get flimsey from the charring and skin peeling process. I think that's what I'm going to do next time. Mine were falling apart before I even got the cheese in them. What a nightmare.

Wonderful!  slice the pepper and remove seeds before broiling to remove the skin.  Beat egg whites until still as another reviewer wrote.  When finished frying the peppers, I fried some diced tomatoes and onions to top the peppers off.

My husband and I were wonderfully amazed at how easy and tasty this recipe is.  I may add a tweak or two next time for personal taste, but we will definitely make this again.

I'm going to try this recipe and also what STELLA advised, to seed the chiles before roasting them. But I always use HATCH, New Mexico long green chile and muenster cheese.  Cheddar cheese is TEX-MEX. Also, it just has to have the tomato sauce on top, will try STELLA's tomato sauce recipe as well.

Tip for removing the skin easy is to let it sweat in a plastic bag for about 30 mins then de-seed it. If it comes out to oily drain it on a paper towel.

If you use Mozzarella cheese, you don't get greasy cheese flavor. So delicious and creamy.   You can also dip them in Panko bread crumbs.

I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER USING VELVEETA AND MONTEREY JACK CHEESE.  THEY ARE SOFT CHEESES AND THEY MELT SO EASILY.  REDROBYNNAU WAS CORRECT ON THE BATTER.

I tweaked the recipe just a little: added about 2 teaspoons of sugar and cut the salt down to about half a teaspoon. We eat these plain with our hands--they're delish!

I really, really like cheese, but these rellenos needed something else to break up the cheese.  I would make this again, but add maybe toasted walnuts for a vegetarian feast or shrimp for my meat eating friends.
