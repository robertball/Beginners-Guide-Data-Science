I made this soup for a dinner gathering of friends, and it was a HUGE hit. I had made this soup once before and it was a big hit then, too. It is very easy to make, and all my guests raved that it was the best corn chowder they have ever had. I felt like a pro! Would definitely recommend this recipe. A winner!

i am surprised at the number of naysayers with this recipe, they must be crazy, because it is delicious.  i, too, skip the nutmeg because it just seems weird and potentially icky, and i also add a whole lot more of the shredded carrot just because it makes it a little heartier.  lucky me, i live just a block from boudin's (offering the most delicious bread san francisco is famous for) so i serve the tasty soup in sourdough bread bowls.  everyone loves it.  we fight over leftovers.  sometimes it gets ugly.

I was looking for a recipe to use fresh local corn so I used 5 ears of scraped corn. I also left out the nutmeg as many others suggested (nutmeg just seemed odd) and added a pinch of red pepper for an added kick. We like spicey foods. Also added 1 local grown medium sized yukon gold potato. Great taste.

Great chowder.  I read the reviews before making this and omitted the nutmeg as recommended by others. Did not use creamed corn, used 2 cans of whole kernal corn drained instead. I also added some minced garlic (little less than a tsp) when cooking the onions in the butter. Also, I'm not too fond of celery so I left that out completely.  I added potatoes, red pepper and a small can of hot chili peppers for some spicy.  Finally, I didn't have skim milk so I used 2% and it turned out just perfect.

This was a very good recipe and simple to make. This is not a thick chowder, but it's pleasantly sweet. I added a little extra salt, which gave the soup a bit more zest.

I hate to give a review like this, but I can't honestly let it go. I made this for my dad last winter and the soup turned into an inedible mess. I followed all the directions and even consulted the reviews of the other cooks. Still, we each tried to grin and bear it, but after 3 bites we couldn't handle it. Maybe I missed something in the instructions...

Leave out the nutmeg!  I made it twice, once with and once without nutmeg because the flavor disturbed me.  It is much better without.  I also used soymilk, which substituted very nicely.  For the meat eaters, I topped with imitation bacon bits, and which they loved.

This was okay. I think it needs some potatoes in it. Didn't like the flavor of the nutmeg in this one. Sorry :(

I loved it. I added about two cups of potatoes because I love them in chowder, more carrots, thyme, garlic powder and a dash of dill instead of nutmeg. And used 1 can of evaporated milk instead of the other two because that is what I had. Had to cook longer because of the potatoes and extra carrots but other than that followed the cooking directions. The extra creamed corn gives it a nice sweetness. It was great.

This is a great recipe for corn chowder. I really feel that the nutmeg is a necessary ingredient, it works really well in it. Though, I probably used a little less than the recipe called for.  I left out the celery and used all milk instead of half-and-half (I just cooked it down a bit).   I think this recipe would be even better with a little diced potato and more carrot. Also, don't be stingy with the black pepper.

I added three small potatoes, diced, and cooked them in the broth (needed an extra cup or so of broth).  When the potatoes were soft, I used my hand blender to blend them up, which made for a thicker, creamier soup.  I also thought it needed a couple of teaspoons of salt (probably partly b/c of the potatoes).

This has become a favorite recipe of mine over the past couple of years, and comes out delicious if you follow the recipe as is (Don't leave out the nutmeg!). But I've made the following changes to make it even more amazing (and healthier): I double the onion, celery, and carrot, and I add one diced zucchini and a diced summer squash. I cook these in half the amount of butter along with the onion and celery. Sometimes I add potato or steamed broccoli when I'm adding the carrots and corn. Instead of using half-and-half, I use evaporated skim milk to cut out some fat. Everyone always raves about this chowder!!

I felt the nutmeg added a nice flavor to this soup!  I used fat free half and half and organic crispy canned corn. I originally thought there might be too much butter and flour, but tried it as is and it turned out great.  I have a couple of suggestions regarding this recipe.  First, it may be personal preference, but I sauteed the onion and celery until they were soft.  Then, I removed the pan from heat while adding flour and whisked it with the butter and vegetables without cooking it for six minutes to avoid any kind of scorching.  It really didn't need to be cooked for six more minutes since it developed into a thick paste and was ready to have the broth added.  Whisk the broth in slowly and allow the soup to thicken while doing so.  Overall, I really loved it!

Just tried this recipe for a large gathering of family and friends. Doubled the recipe to feed everyone, and it was a big hit! Should have added some potatoes to thicken it, as others have suggested. Everyone loved it, and some had three bowls! Would have added some red pepper flakes for zing if just for me, but kept it mild to suit group.

Absolutely delicious. I add potatoes (pre-cooked) and use chicken broth rather than vegetable, since that's what I tend to have on hand.

I love this soup sooo much! I have been a vegetarian for roughly two years now. this soup is yummmy! I left out the onions due to the price, also left out the nutmeg. I added potatoes, and the next round of soup ill be adding sweet potatoes. Can't wait to get it cooking. it was easy enough to make and it for sure a keeper!

Delicious!  I omitted the skim milk, used chicken broth and added 3 cut up chicken breasts.  I doubled the recipe and had enough for my Bible study group, canasta group and still had left over.  Will definitely use again.

This was good.  I omitted celery & carrots because I did not have any and used vegetable bouillon in place of stock.  I also used whole milk instead of half-and-half, and 2% instead of skim, and added green chiles to spice it up.  And omitted paprika based on other reviews.  Came out great and was a hearty meal with some bread on the side, and even my non-vegetarian husband liked it (though he added some cooked ground turkey.)  A keeper!

I wanted to make just enough for myself so I used the calculator for 1 serving. I used a little more corn and about twice the flour recommended. I used soy milk in place of the half and half and the skim milk, and the result was surprisingly creamy! I also left out the nutmeg based on other reviews. This soup really hit the spot- I'm sure it would have been even more delicious if I had half and half! But, really, it's healthier without, and it's totally creamy enough.

There is no review that can do this recipe justice! Its simply PERFECT... don't add or remove anything! I make this a few times a week and none of us get enough of it. Slice up some french bread and top it with oregano, garlic salt and cheddar/mozzarella (any cheese you like but i find the sharpness of cheddar really complements this recipe). Pop them in the oven till the cheese melts and the bread is crispy. Thanks for sharing this recipe Annette!

I thought this soup was just ok.  The nutmeg seemed out of place and I think it could use some potatoes.  I also added some red pepper flakes after the soup was finished to spice it up.  My husband enjoyed it with some green siratcha.

This actually came out to be quite delicious. Basically its onion and celery fried in butter that is later turned into a roux using flour. Add a little veggie stock, corn, and seasonings to get a warm and flavorful soup.

I made this recipe today with some adjustments and got lots of compliments from my family. I omitted the celery, carrot and creamed corn. I used one bag of 32 oz. frozen yellow corn , a quarter cup red onion diced and one small Maui onion. I added a teaspoon salt instead of a pinch. I put the cooked soup in a blender for 30 seconds and reheated. Delicious!

Good easy soup. Hubby said he liked it.  I needed to use some excess milk and this did it. I only had 1 can of creamed corn and that was fine.  I also added 2 potatoes(needed to use up).  Will make again.

Very good! I made two small changes. I used chicken broth since that is what I had on hand. I also used 2 cans of whole kernal corn instead of one and one can of cream corn instead of two. Will make again!

This recipe was so easy.  It was necessary to make a few modifications due to my panty being poorly stocked.   Instead of 2 cans of stock, I used 1 can of vegetable broth and 1 can of cream of mushroom ysoup.  For spices I used Lawrys and a pinch of dill and celery salt instead of celery.   I’ll use the cream soup again,  it added so much flavor.

Definitely a keeper! I like a lot of stuff in my  soup so I added potatoes and used rough chopped carrots instead of shredded. I also nixed the nutmeg and added garlic powder and thyme. I wanted to add rosemary but I didn't have any.

I'm by no means a talented chef, but every time I make this recipe I feel like one. It is incredibly delicious and simple. This is my go to for when I need to bring something to a holiday pot luck and people always rave about it and ask for my secret. I follow the recipe with the exception of more shredded carrots.

So this was the perfect recipe to make on a cold winter night. I omitted the nutmeg like everyone else and instead did a dash of red chili flakes. I added more carrot, half a yellow onion, and a lot of garlic. I know this is vegetarian but I had leftover turkey and it was delicious in this! I also decided to be very unhealthy and just use 2 cups of half and half with no skim milk. I will definitely be making this again!

No nutmeg. Added 4 small russet potatoes and a jalapeño. Used heavy cream instead of half and half. Delicious.

This was delicious!  I accidentally only bought one can of creamed corn, so I used 1 can creamed, 1 can regular corn, and then filled one of the cans with frozen corn.  I also just grated one whole large carrot, which I think was more than 2 T.  I used cream in place of the half and half (I meant to sub half cream/half milk, but forgot!)  Lastly, I used more than a pinch of salt, but didn't measure how much I used.  But, it turned out really tasty!

Good flavor, but missing something. Would taste better if it had potatoes or stewed tomatoes.

This soup is fabulous - just plain fabulous - and it freezes too!
Only change I made - whole milk in place of skim as suggested by another review.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious. I used frozen whole kernel corn instead of canned, added some potatoes, and then let it simmer longer than the recipe instructed. I did use the nutmeg even though it seemed odd but like I said, it turned out delicious!

I really like this soup.  The nutmeg is an unexpected flavor, but I think it goes well with it.  The only change I made was I did add a shredded potato to thicken it up a little more.

Fantastic!!!!! I added more grated carrot, I only had 2 boxes of lightly sauced frozen corn, added 1/2c grated cheddar left over in fridge. I may try adding potatoes next time. But I'm getting rave reviews!

We made a few changes; added 4 potatoes, used 2 cubes bullion with 2 cups water, used 2 large carrots, 1 1/2 cups 2%milk; all based on what I had on hand. Was a huge hit with my toddlers, especially after they helped with the No Fail Biscuits for a side. Will definitely be great starting point to make something that your family will love.

Delicious! I used more celery and carrots. I added garlic and potatoes. Left out the dairy and used just soy milk. Perfect for a rainy night when everybody needs a little comfort food.
