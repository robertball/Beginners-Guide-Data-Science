I doubled this recipe to make two wraps. One kid asked for no olives, so I omitted them from one wrap. I was concerned using the italian-style dressing only because I didn't want it to leak out of the tortilla as my kids were eating them. I solved that by mixing it with two tablespoons of reduced fat mayonnaise, then dividing it between the two tortillas. Doing this kept the italian dressing inside the tortilla as well as the other "fillings".

These are good for a regular lunch...nothing out of the ordinary.  I don't like the Italian dressing on it...way too overpowering, so I use some sour cream or ranch or omit.  Just depends on my mood that day. This is good.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are standard lunch fare for my husband.  They are fast and easy so I can just throw them in his lunch in the morning and he is ready for lunch whenever he wants.  I have used both creamy Italian and Ranch as well as plane mayo on these.  I found regular Italian to be too runny, but then I usually make my own so that may be why.

It looks good on paper but what a bust. Too much dressing, too much time in the microwave. I didn't think it was going to be this bad but it was. I didn't finish it. Not worth trying.

Not bad at all for a quick, easy, light lunch. Those who complained that the Italian dressing is too wet may not have noticed the directions where it says "top with 3 or 4 splashes of Italian dressing". My interpretation of that is that you just add enough to moisten the vegetables. For me, that meant less than the 2 tablespoons listed in the ingredients. I prefer this cold though, rather than heated in the microwave and with thin sliced cheese instead of grated.

It is very easy to make. A nice light meal for summer dished with your favorite salad.  It is good warm or cold.  I used the spray italian dressing and it was just right.

Delicious recipe to use leftover roast beef in.  I didn't add the olives (we don't care for them), but used all the other ingredients.  After microwaving and adding the rest of the ingredients, I browned in a "dry" skillet.  It only took 2-3 minutes on each side to get the roll-up to seal and brown nicely.  This is a great wrap and would be wonderful with any type of meat.  Thanks Dan for sharing your recipe.

This was good!  Maybe not the best wrap sandwich I’ve had, but it’s a good starting point and one that lends itself well to changing it up to your liking.  There’s quite a bit of filling in this and if you roll too tightly all of your filling will ooze out.  I served mine with Cajun mayonnaise.  I could see grilling this too.

Thanks! I couldn't think of anything to eat, and stumbled across this recipe... you inspired me! A simple garlic tortilla with cheddar cheese and thin-sliced tomato hit the spot.

I made this using turkey breast and it was really good. As others have said, it is runny, but I think it still tastes great.
