We did like this veggie dish, though did find it needed a few adjustments at least for the locale we live in.  I did not think it needed a full cup of olive oil for the onions so just used enough to sweat the onion tip not quite caramelized.  And from past experience of cooking lentils here, I have found that 20-30 minutes is sufficient.  Overall, this was pretty flavorful and satisfying and glad I found this!!!  At the final seasoning, I did add a bit of flaked red pepper for a bit of zing.  Thanks for this post, bolshevik

This is a great side dish to any meal. The tomato and brown sugar seem to counteract the bitterness of the kale but mingles well with the garlic. I also added some fresh ground turmeric which was a nice addition to the paprika flavour. Keep your eye on the liquid though. I had to add some water during the process to keep it from scorching. Thank you bolshevik for sharing your recipe.

My picky eater husband loved this! I pumped up the garlic flavor by adding an extra clove and using garlic salt rather than regular salt - turned out great! As other reviewers have mentioned, the cook time is a bit off. I only had the lentils on the stove for 35-40 minutes, including the added kale at the end. Served with crusty warm bread. Will definitely make again!

Mine turned out more like a thick soup than the one pictured.   It tasted fine, but not as garlicky as I expected.  Not bad, but not great, either.

This is an amazing recipe) the best way to make lentils so far. Although I added extra paprika, fresh celery, carrots and parsley. Also I used less olive oil.

I had extra kale from another recipe that sorely needed to be used when I ran across this submission. I made the recipe as written with the exception of the olive oil. I was running very low on my oils and have found that I can add just enough water in the pan to ensure non-stick and it browns onion & garlic nicely. For a side, I made "Moroccan Spicy Carrot Salad" by malak. The combination of the two tastes were incredible. I loved the full flavor of the sauce and the ease of this recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I had already made my lentils and then found this recipe. I'm sure I didn't even use 1/2 cup of olive oil to brown my onion and then garlic. I sauteed 2 sliced carrots also then threw it in the pot with the tomato paste and some brown sugar and paprika. I only had 3 kale leaves I was happy to use. Pretty good. I'm going to add some spice for my second bowl.

So yummy! Me and my husband love this, it's a really versatile dish. I didn't have kale handy so I used chopped spinach instead and added broccoli for some crunch. Great to make if you have veggies over because meat eaters can just add some meat. I added some seasoned grilled chicken for our dinner last night (did not cook it in but added it at the end).
