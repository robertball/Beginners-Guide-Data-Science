These were very good!  I did what the first reviewer recommended and only made half of the icing and that was plenty. Also, instead of the spices listed, I used 2 tsp of Apple Pie Spice.

I'm kind of new to this whole cooking and baking thing, so I really appreciate easy deserts like this! My recipe only turned out 14 cupcakes rather than 18 but that doesn't really bother me :) It definitely has that fall flavor!  I wouldn't really change anything about it, because I love the flavor and texture, and I will defiantly be making this next fall -- maybe for Thanksgiving!

Other than using vanilla Greek yogurt, I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter was very thick like brownies, the cake didn't raise (made a 9x13 cake instead of cupcakes), and it was very dense.  Will try again, but I'm thinking it needs an extra egg, baking soda vs powder, and maybe some milk to thin the batter.  Great flavor and really doesn't need frosting with as sweet as it was on it's own.

I made the cinnamon cream cheese frosting for a spice cake I had made and it was a great combination.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 6 oz.  Fantastic flavor!!

This could easily be a 5 star recipe except that the frosting amount is ridiculous.   The frosting part of this recipe makes at least twice, if not three times as much frosting as needed, even when being generous with the icing.   Other than that, the cupcakes are great.   They have a nice mellow spice flavor and aroma.   The cupcakes are moist and light tasting.   The frosting has a wonderful flavor and is a perfect match for the cupcakes.   My only complaint is that the recipe makes way too much frosting.

the icing is great its makes a lot of icing. i doubled the cupcakes part and not the icing and i had lots. i think next time i will try doubling all the spices. I was expecting it to taste like pumpkin pie. it seemed mild.
