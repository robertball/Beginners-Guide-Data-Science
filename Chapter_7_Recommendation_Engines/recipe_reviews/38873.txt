We didn't care too much for this. The flavor was weird or something.

This is so yummy.  Should be called Lemonade pie.  Very refreshing.  You must like Lemon flavor to enjoy this.

Was surprised - it was very good! Guests liked it because it was light, yet nice and creamy. I liked it because it was super easy and quick to make. The filling was quite generous - made two 6" pies.
