This is a fabulous-tasting pie, and it's that much better because it's so easy to prepare. I did add the optional miniature semi-sweet chocolate morsels - I had less than the full 1/2 cup on hand, but more than 1/3, so let's call it a "scant" 1/2 cup. And I also used genuine Reddi-wip, but I didn't opt for the additional whipped cream or crushed candy. It was a bit unusual to use the whipped cream as an ingredient in the pie filling, instead of as a topping, but that made the filling that much tastier. And I love graham cracker pie crusts. I highly recommend this for any chocolate pie lovers out there.

While being mindful of the more critical reviews involving the instant pudding not fully mixing with the ingredients, I went with using an electric mixer to ensure that it would mix properly.  While it did have a little of that "instant pudding taste", on the whole it's quick, it's easy and most people commented on the mousse-texture quality that it had.  

Besides, what's not to like?  It's chocolate after all.

Very quick and easy to make. The taste was okay but it did not set up like I thought it would...it was a little mushy the first day, firmer the second day.

I didnt like this.  the pudding did not mix in, could see little dark dots throughout.  Tastes very pudding like--and did not form up properly.
