I have made other pumpkin french toast recipes, and none compare to this one. I think what sets this one apart must be the cream, the pumpkin pie spice and vanilla extract. I could taste the pumpkin in this recipe and the flavor overall was great. I used whole grain bread as I wanted to make this as a healthy breakfast for my family however, if I was making this simply to indulge tastebuds, I would go for slices of french bread and top it all off with generous dollops of spiced whipped cream, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a good drizzle of maple syrup, as suggested. The whole family loved this recipe.

Very good.  I used Carnation evaporated milk.  This woorks great with the flavored Coffeemate liquid creamers too. French Vanilla or the holiday flavor you like best.  Thanks Andrea. Pumpkin worked into any recipe is so good for you.

I used organic eggs, fat free half-n-half, Trader Joe's pumpkin puree and I actually used all pumpkin pie spice which was 1 1/4. My kids really enjoyed this. I made a homemade maple-vanilla syrup to drizzle over the top and I'll tell you...they ate all but one piece. I tried a bit and thought it was pretty good, though I might like to increase the pumpkin to a half cup and maybe cut the half-n-half to a quarter cup next time to REALLY taste the pumpkin. Using the maple-vanilla syrup with it was a good idea.

I didn't happen to have any cream or walnuts on hand and I needed to cut the recipe in half, but I figured I would try this recipe anyway. I used 2 eggs, about a 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of canned pumpkin, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger and ground cloves. It still turned out phenomenal! This definitely feels like you're dipping the bread into pumpkin pie mix and it's absolutely delicious!

Delicious and easy.  I used fat free milk instead of half & half because that's what I had on hand.  It tasted great and made the recipe healthier.  I also sprinkled the walnuts on top after it was done rather than putting it in the mix.  I served them with the "Cinnamon Syrup" recipe on here.  Will definitely make these again!

A nice change of pace from traditional French toast. Even though I stirred the batter though between bread dippings, the walnuts tended to slide to the bottom of the batter, so that the first pieces of toast had few nuts and the last ones had the bulk of them. To compensate next time, I will use a serrated spoon and scoop up some walnut pieces from the batter to sprinkle on the tops of breads as they are lowered onto the griddle. I tried this out toward the end and it worked well.

Great recipe! It completely tasted like pumpkin pie. It was a great blend though. Because you could really taste the pumpkin pie flavor in the midst of the traditional french toast. I used another recipe with this called Cinnamon Syrup and the combination was fabulous! I absolutely recommend this dish!

This was wonderful! I used plain half and half, but it I am going to try it again with Gingerbread flvaored creamer. The pumpkin mixture absorbed nicely into the bread. Delicious!

I was unimpressed with this recipe.  Even after adding additional pumpkin to the "batter", the french toast, just tasted like french toast. And the pumpkin made it heavy, and not like and fluffy like other french toast recipes I've tried in the past.

has potential but needs to be tweaked. next time i'll double the topping, adding 1/2 in with pumpkin mix. i'll also add milk as i found it to be dry and i like soggy french toast.

Wow this was a party in my mouth! So good! I didnt have pumpkin pie spice so I used ginger,freshly grated nutmeg,cloves and allspice. I also didn't have any walnuts. I made it as written and loved it,but wanted alittle more intense pumpkin flavor so I added alittle more into the batter,about 1/4 cup...Bingo was pefection! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe! So easy to make.

We couldn't taste the pumpkin even though we doubled the pumpkin purée. It just tasted like cinnamon.

I used this recipe more for the idea than anything.  I subbed skim milk for and made my own pumpkin pie spice (dashes of cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg).  Can't really speak to the quality of the recipes proportions as I eyeballed it, but it made for a wonderful variation on regular french toast and was a great use for extra pumpkin puree (without having to make a second pie!).  Thanks for the idea :)

Seriously delicious! I used Pumpkin Yeast Bread from this site to make this. It's definitely worth the extra effort. I left out the walnuts. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

This did not turn out well for me at all.  I even melted the peanut butter a bit like suggested by other reviewers, but it simply did not mix in well with the rest of the ingredients.  You could not really taste the peanut butter, and the batter had this weird taste that I was not expecting.

Family did not like this.  It was heavy/bland and the walnuts ended up sticking to the skillet and not on the French toast, even with following the directions about 'stirring between dips'.  Very disappointed because my family loves pumpkin. I will not be making this again.

Used milk instead of cream and added the walnuts on each plate because my kids don't all like them.  My daughter said that this was the best french toast ever, but that it didn't really taste like pumpkin.  She loves cinnamon, so I think that is what she enjoyed so much.  This makes a great dipping batter and the bread cooked up beautifully. Plus, it smelled soooooo good cooking this morning.  Served with fresh whipped cream and syrup - this is a great breakfast for the fall months.

It was really good one! REALLY YUM!

My husband made these today in the morning. He changed some ingredients according to what we had at home:
1. Replaced half-and-half with 2% milk and  doubled the amount of milk for my personal preferences (I like it a bit more soggy, so do not double if you like it on the drier side).
2. Used separate spices instead of pumpkin spice (cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg). There are a couple of easy recipes on this site. 
3. The best part of all - he used cinnamon swirl bread!!!  My favorite for ANY french toast :)

Enjoy - really nice holiday recipe!

This was very good and a nice change from regular French Toast.  My family only rated it a 4, though.  I thought it had a nice "pumpkin pie" taste although I only used 1 t. pumpkin pie spice.  I will add either 1/2 tsp. cinnamon or another 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice next time.  I used evaporated milk and no walnuts.

I had fresh cooked pumpkin left over from the holidays that I used. I was surprised that the flavor was not as strong as I had hoped. My kids loved it though, and the nuts were a nice touch.

This is a very delicious and sweet breakfast treat! I made this for my husband and I this morning and he LOVED it! It was a bit sweet, but that's probably because I put too much syrup on it. :) I used pumpkin butter instead of pumpkin puree for a little extra spice, and didn't have any half-and-half so I used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 skim milk. This is a great fall/winter breakfast, and I'm sure little ones would love it too. Thank you for sharing-this is so creative!

Would be good for the holidays, but I really couldn't tell much difference between this and regular french toast.

I used International Delight Pumpkin Pie Spice Coffee Creamer in place of the half and half and I omitted the walnuts. I enjoyed this and next time I will add a bit more pumpkin spice.

Yummy French Toast. I had some left over pumpkin from the holidays so I was happy to find this recipe. I used almond milk in place of half & half.

Loved this recipe! I used Texas toast that was going stale, and I upped it to 4 eggs and 3/4 cup cream. I also left the walnuts out of the batter and sprinkled them on top, much easier.
I took this a step further and mixed up some pumpkin cream and sandwiched it between two pieces of the French toast before topping with syrup, powdered sugar, and walnuts. SO GOOD!

while this made some yummy french toast, the pumpkin flavor was pretty underwhelming.  the kids couldn't even tell i'd added pumpkin to the batter, after declaring they were not eating breakfast today because i was planning on doing it.  i also ran out of batter.  maybe my bread really soaked it up but i only got 6 slices.

Our family of four all really liked this!  I don't have pumpkin pie spice so I just uped the amount of cinnmon.  I also added a pinch of salt and 2T icing sugar into the batter.  This is a great way to change up the usual french toast and I know I'll be making this again!

Yes, very good!  I just used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice rather than cinnamon.  I didn't put nuts in the batter but rather topped the french toast with pecans before serving.  You could definitely taste the pumpkin pie spice, but not really the pumpkin puree.  It was still a nice, rich treat though!

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast and the only thing right is add more pumpkin spice/cinnamon, perhaps a bit more pumpkin.
We loved it and what we had leftover, I bagged and froze.
Easy to put in toaster and yum.

I found the mixture so thick it was hard to get a clean sear on the toast. I tried it several times in different pans and heat levels. I just couldn’t get on board with this. My family says the taste is “fine”. Fine is not a compliment to me when cooking

I made as it minus the pumpkin pie seasoning, I really think that would have been too much spice and taken away from the pumpkin flavor. Definitely will be making these again!!

I just used day old white bread.  It would have been better with thicker bread— maybe Texas toast. I would also top with cinnamon and pumpkin pie spiced whipped cream to add to the pumpkin flavor.

Awesome recipe, I added a half cup of pumpkin to the recipe because I wanted more pumpkin flavor. It was so good.

This is pretty much how I would make French Toast anyway, with the exception of pumpkin.  I did not use walnuts, however.  Who puts walnuts in pumpkin pie? Yech...

Can't have nuts so I didn't use the walnuts. I love pumpkin and will use a bit more Pumpkin Pie Spice next time. Very good and just right for Pumpkin lovers to start the day.

Would make again.  Added 3/4 tsp pumpkin spice.  1/2 didnt seem to be enough and was washed out by an entire teaspoon of cinnamon.   Might cut back on cinnamon.  Personal preference really, but there is also a balance to consider.  Turthfully if pumpkin  is your goal, you'll want a bit more pumpkin spice.  Also start with a well warmed pan but not scorching hot.  Scorched egg is an awful flavour.  Good luck Turtles??

Everyone enjoyed this but it didn't have any flavors that stuck out to me so it seemed a bit boring. The only change I made was that I made it with condensed milk as another reviewer suggested because I was out of regular milk. I would make it again but I would step up the spices a bit.

Not very pumpin pie-ee. I would double the pumpkin and double the pumpkin pie spice. May need a little more cream to thin it out but I didn't add any and it seemed fine. Perfect amount of mix for 8 slices of bread though.

This is a delicious recipe! Even my very picky eater enjoyed a slice. I used heavy cream and pumpkin pie spice with extra cinnamon. I cooked it in a buttered skillet and sprinkled with a ginger flavoured powdered sugar.

Thought this was great! Only had two eggs, so reduced recipe, and substited pumpkin spice with all spice, since that's what we had on hand. Added powdered sugar and fresh bananas on top.

I used about 10 slices of Sara Lee honey wheat bread that I left out of the bag for four hours, or so. I used evaporated milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, and a few shakes of flax seeds instead of walnuts because of an unfortunate allergy. Yummy! My two and five year olds agree.

It was delicious!  We found out that if  you prefer a crispier french toast ...you can press the toast down as it cooks in your skillet.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious. I left out the walnuts because it's too much of a pain to get it to stick to the bread. Also added a little bit more purée and pumpkin pie spice to really make it pumpkin-y. Great recipie!
