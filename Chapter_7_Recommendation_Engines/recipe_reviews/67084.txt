I have been making this for 4o years. I butter foil broiler pans and pour the candy in it, The ridges in pan make strips that can be picked up and cut into small pieces. I always had candy stuck on cookie sheets. this methods works every time. we use this recipes to make candy for our church christmas fair. It  sells out every time! Geri Berry

My favorite as a kid! BUT BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING CINNAMON! I remember going to school with blisters all over my face in 7th grade after basking in the steam of a batch of cinnamon flavored candy. The oil is quite strong. Clove is another old fashioned flavor that is excellent, but again be careful of the steam. Sassafras, anise, wintergreen..... excuse me, I need to go make a batch right now!!!

This was a super simple, easy recipe. My first time making hard candy and it worked! I made mine into cherry suckers using LorAnn's Gourmet Cherry flavoring oil. I poured candy into Wilton candy moulds.

The daughter wanted to make candy for Christmas.  We made strawberry and root beer. Hard crack stage takes a bit of time to get to, but this is very tasty, will definitely do again.

I made this for Christmas and it was gone before the rest of the candy. I used 1 dram of cinnamon oil. I am making it again tonight because my husband likes it better than any hard cinnamon candy he can find. Word to the wise... when you out the oil in, step back and make sure you have your window cracked. Broke mine up with a metal spatula, just a slight tap will do it. This is the best of the best.

Worked perfectly. I used plastic molds to make suckers for my wedding. I poured it slowly so it would cool at it poured and sprayed the molds first with flavorless cooking spray. Definitely will make this again! I used peach flavour and it was amazing. Even my nephew that is extremely picky and does not eat candy ever was taking licks of his sucker.

I made a 1/2 batch to try. Flavored with 1/2 tsp Watkins coconut extract. Dyed ocean blue. I lightly buttered a cookie sheet and put ample powdered sugar. Fantastic. Next I plan to try pineapple extract. 
Note: With all hard candies, they need careful handling. Hot sugar can cause horrible burns. I refuse to make any type of candy without a candy thermometer. It takes the guess work out.

Very tasty candy. I didn't have candy oil so I just used extract (it was late and I thought I had some but I didn't) I used this to make windows in a gingerbread house and then also as a gift for Christmas. With the extract it had a very light lemon flavor. Tasty candy. I just broke the candy into pieces after it had hardened instead of cutting it. I got distracted and it hardened up by the time I remembered. I'll make this again.

I made this tonight. It turned out very nicely.  I made cinnamon candy.  The smell was so strong when I stirred in the cinnamon oil that I was afraid to add the whole teaspoon, but I wish I did because the smell was quite stronger than the end product.   My candy thermometer showed hard candy needing a higher temp than the recipe called for so I let it get to almost 350 degrees before I checked it in very cold water. It set up nicely.  With working quickly and getting to it as soon as I could touch the edges, I had just enough time to cut it all into little peices before it fully hardened.  I put the powdered sugar on parchment paper which worked fairly well to keep it from sticking while I was working with it.

This recipe was great, the only problems I had were my fault. I found if you use normal white sugar on the pan, and either pour it really thin or once it's a little cool but still soft, pull it into thin pieces, it turns out as pretty cool and glass-like with the sugar like a decoration on the one side.

Excellent quality with delicate flavour. We used an induction stove and a ceramic coated cast iron pot. We are in Calgary, so brought to 300F at power level 8 for about 10 minutes, stirring with a , then turned off, but kept in the iron pot. We used a metal gravy ladle to carefully pour into silicone molds. Every now and then when the candy got too thick, power blast for a few seconds, then turn off again.
