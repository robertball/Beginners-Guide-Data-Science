This was really good and a great way to use sausage differently! I told the husband it was southern sausage pie because he won't even try quiche! hee-hee.....he loved it! I tweaked this up a bit by using 1 lb. hot italian sausage[left out hot sauce and butter], added mushrooms, an extra egg and pimento.  It made two pies...but they were way too brown, even after covering with foil.[ergo the 4 stars]  Next time I'll use the 350 degree setting for the whole process.

This is my families favorite breakfast which says a lot because they are so picky. Everyone usually wants something different, but not when I make this. I have used the sausage suggested, though very good, it's too spicy for our little ones so I substitute sage sausage and it's perfect. Other than that I don't change a thing.

We thought this was very good.  Instead of pie crust, I flattened out a tube of crescent rolls in the pie plate.  It turned out a little browner than I would have liked but it was still good.  I also added chopped tomatoes to the egg mixture.  I cooked it on 350 the entire time and it took about 45-50 minutes to cook.

This was a great base recipe. Though I did make some changes to this.. It really wasn't so Southern. Instead of the sausage I used bacon and cooked the same way as instructed. I added about 1/2 cup of Spinach to the egg mixture and took out the Ranch and put Cream instead. I forgot to add the sugar, pepper, and salt but that ended up being alright. The pepper would have been nice but Im glad I didn't put in the salt. The bacon gave it the right amount. Also I decided not to add hot pepper sauce I'm not a fan of the flavor. Seems like a lot of changes but it was so good!! It's on my list of to make again.

This is my first quiche. I found it easy to make and my family all enjoyed it. I doubled the ingredients to make two.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add an extra egg and only used 1/2 cup of milk. I used a little less cheese than asked for also.  I baked it at the higher temp for 20 minutes and then 40 minutes at the lower temp. They turned out really great.  I will be making this recipe again in the future.

My 3 1/2 year old twins LOVE this.  I make it every weekend.  Got one in the oven right now.  Thanks.  I Butter the pie dish before I put the crust in. Adds a little awesomeness to the crust.

This was SO good! I didn't add hot sauce, salt, pepper or sugar. There is enough salt and spice in the sausage and ranch dressing. I used fat free ranch and reduced fat cheese. It came out wonderful. A new favorite!

This was easy enough to throw together and the flavor was good but the ranch dressing was a little too strong for us. I was surprised how light and fluffy this came out.

I was a little skeptical as I mixed the salad dressing into my eggs, but this unusual mix was a delicous surprise!!! My husband had 2nds and 3rds, and it made enough for breakfast in the morning! Thanks for sharing.

Mmmm - this quiche is so good! I left out the sugar and crust, as I worked it into my South Beach diet. I will be making this a lot, although I may substitute part of the sausage for some veggies.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this for quite a picky family and everyone raved about it. I did not have the evaporated milk so I used heavy cream instead. The ranch dressing gave it a very zesty superb taste. Thanks! (Even my picky two-year old ate it)

Quite good, easy, and as healthy or unhealthy as you want to make it!  I didn't have Ranch dressing so used sour cream instead. Thank you!

Very delicious!  I used hot sausage, extra hot sauce, plus jalapeno jack cheese and served it for dinner.  It had a nice kick to it and very good flavor.  I will make this often.  Thanks

The quiche was really good, even though I modified it a little bit. I added bell pepper to the onions and sausage and left out the milk as some reviewers had mentioned that the pie was a little runny. It turned out perfect, especially as I leaving out the milk reduced the baking time to about 35min at high temperature. I definetely will cook it again.

This was great, not a great fan of Ranch dressing, but I had some on hand for my grandchildren, so went ahead and added it. It doesn't overwhelm the quiche at all. I anly had regular sausage so added just a touch more hot sauce. Served it on quilt day and the girls loved it. I used the Mircle Baking Powder Pie Crust on this site, try it, it is great also.

Following the recipe (minus the ranch dressing), it turned out to be good; very flavorful and rich, certainly.  However, it was not an egg pie so much as cheese pie.  We couldn't taste the egg at all in it, only the sausage and cheese.  We also found that cooking it at 450 for twenty minutes was sufficient baking time for both the filling and the crust.  We will make this again, with some modifications: cut the cheese in half, add two eggs, and bake for only 20 minutes (intentionally).

I was a little worried about the Ranch dressing, but wow! It was great --- adds a nice creamy taste. I used sweet Italian sausage and added yellow and red onion, yellow bell pepper, baby port mushrooms, mexican-style shredded cheese and some spices. I forgot to add sugar. I didn't do too much hot sauce, hoping the kids would try it. No luck. Oh well -- more for my husband and I! Amazingly delicious! Would highly recommend!

Instead of a pie, I made muffins (or mini quiches) and left out the crust. The sausage can be halfed and other ingredients added; I had some frozen veggies that I threw in there and it turned out great. These make great on-the-go breakfasts!

I let my kids help make this one- they loved it!  Very easy, I didn't have any ham, though- so I subbed some chopped chicken.  Really good- my whole kitchen smells awesome!  I also just made it in a square glass baking dish, and it worked fine.  Temp & cooking time was right on. I'll be using this again and varying the ingredients for fun.

My husband and I have always hated quiche. But, we like frittatas. So I thought I'd give this a shot, thinking, hey it's a frittata in a pie crust, this can't go wrong? Well, it didn't go wrong. But it isn't a frittata in a pie crust. There is so much cheese in the egg mixture that the eggs never do completely set, which took us a few bites and some discussion to adjust to! But the flavor was so great we persevered. I think we'll wind up making this one again. However if I do make it again I will adjust the eggs/milk/cheese ratio to firm up my egg portion a bit more to my liking (add another egg, reduce the milk by half, reduce the cheese maybe, not sure about that part, the cheese was super good!). I omitted the salt and sugar because I felt they were unnecessary (the other ingredients are salty enough, and the sugar is to offset the hot pepper sauce, which is vinegar based, but we like that). Thanks for submitting the first quiche I or my husband have ever liked! :)

This was very good!  I used country sausage and omitted the hot sauce.  The ranch dressing seemed to soak into the sausage and gave it a wonderful, unique flavor.

I made a mistake and this recipe STILL turned out well!  (I had to empty my pie crust to add in the cheese and I used too much meat).

I had to take out the pie crust because one of the family members is gluten free.  When ever we make pie we don't put in any pie crust.  And this recipe was no different.  It was amazing.  Actually I wouldn't wanna try it with a pie crust.  The crispy bottom actually was the best part of the dish.  Yum yum.  I can't wait to make it again.

Great recipe!!  Tried it with a few minor changes- instead of sausage (of which I am not a big fan) I used bacon and diced ham.  Also I found that I prefer using 6-8 eggs instead for one quiche which makes it much fuller!  Otherwise have made this recipe for many others who all absolutely love it and ask for the recipe!  It is so easy too.

I didn't have a pie crust, so I just made the recipe in a regular pie pan.  My family thought it was really good.  I might try adding some vegetables or try substituting ham instead of sausage.

I made a couple of changes. I used 1 cup heavy cream instead of  1/2 cup each of the ranch dressing and milk. I also added chopped green pepper with the onion and used 5 eggs instead of 4. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes then at 350 for 30.  I then covered it with foil to keep it from getting too brown and baked for another 10 minutes. Very good - will definitely make it again.

So simple and easy to make!  My husband cringed him when I told him we having quiche -- he loved this!!!  Next time I make it I will try to experiment with additional ingredients, such as mushrooms, green chiles etc. per my husband's request.

This was great! I normally don't tweak recipes until I've tried the original first, but I wanted enough filling to do two pies for my family of five hearty eaters. Unfortunately I  didn't have enough eggs to just  double the recipe. Here were the changes I made:  I prebaked 2 pie shells at 425 for 5 minutes. I added a package of frozen spinach that had been cooked and squeeze dried on the bottom of the pie shell and then put the sausage on top of that.  I increased the eggs to 6. Increased the milk by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese. All the remaining ingredients / directions were the same.  I had enough filling to do two pies.  The baking time for me was definitely shorter.  I baked the pies @ 425 for 10 minutes and then at 350 for 25 minutes and they were perfectly done.  I will DEFININTELY make this again! My husband and three teen boys totally demolished both pies :)

My mom used to make quiche when I was growing up and I loved it, but I have been unable to find a recipe my husband says he would like to eat again until now. Both my husband--who said this is a "man's quiche"-- and my three and a half year old--who "doesn't like eggs"-- thought this was great. Only changes I made were that I used turkey sausage, five eggs and lowfat ranch dressing. I also didn't add any extra salt as it was plenty salty from the sausage and ranch.  Thanks for a great recipe the whole family enjoyed! =)

This is a fabulous quiche. The spicy sausage adds a lot of flavor.  I used Pillsbury pie shells instead of making my own.  I worried about the baking time but the quiche came out perfectly with the time suggested. This would be great for a party or breakfast.  It was even better rewarmed the next day.  Husband loved it.

I can never make just one of these.  I always have to make at least 2 and sometimes 3 or 4.  Everyone loves it.  The only thing I do differently is I add the cheese after the sausage and cover with the egg mixture.  If not, the cheese get a little too dark on top.  This is a favorite on Christmas day for breakfast, especially if made the day before.

I make a vegetarian/lower calorie version of this and LOVE it.
I use:
margarine instead of butter
4 cubed boca breakfast patties instead of pork sausage
pepper corn ranch instead of ranch and added black pepper
4 oz or less of cheddar cheese
about a cup of chopped up fresh broccoli florets 
and a regular instead of deep-dish pie crust

i also cover it with tin foil for the entire time, and bake it at 350 the whole time. i've only ever burnt it the other way, but it's probably partly my oven.

I have been craving quiche for a while, but my bf eats very few veggies and this ended up being our compromise.  The only changes were that I used diced beef kielbasa instead of sausage and I put a layer of cheese on top of the crust (to keep it from getting soggy).  I served it with sliced tomatoes and thought it turned out pretty good for the few ingredients in it and he really enjoyed it.  I will make this again but will add  some mushrooms and green peppers next time(to my side at least).

Delicious!! I didn't use the full 12 oz. of sausage, probably only 8oz. instead. The rest of the recipe I followed to the letter as well as one person's diced tomato suggestion. Came out great!

This was the first quiche I had ever made.  It was quite tasty.  My sister loved it.  The next time I will probably use bacon or ham instead of sausage.  Overall, this was an awesome recipe.

Yummy! My husband and I are on the Atkins diet, so I just made it with no pie crust. It got a little browned and crisp on top, but we actually liked it that way. Maybe just baking it at 350 instead of starting at 425 would have yielded a more quiche-like result. I'll definitely make again and again!

Very good flavor. Did not cook at 350 for 45 or 50 min looked done at 30 min. Took out of oven let it rest for 10 min. Very good and good the right amount of time.

1) Very tasty. Did not use hot sausage and it was delicious.
2) I used honey and garlic sausage and eliminated the sugar. I forgot the hot sauce so sprinkle red pepper flakes on top.

I love this recipe! I grew up on my grandmothers infamous quiche for breakfast. I've made one similar to this recipe. Added mushrooms and instead of onions, I used onion powder (not so overpowering).  I also love the ranch dressing just didn't use 1/2 cup of it. Other than that this recipe is great!! Just a FYI. If you have an impatient family like mine... To reduce cooking time leave it on 425°  for 35 mins and it should cook perfectly!!

Due to lack of ingredients I made a few changes.  Replaced the ranch dressing with low fat sour cream, no milk so used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  Used a mixture of Colby and Monterey Jack Cheeses with a small amount of sharp white cheddar.  Bag of fresh spinach cooked, then squeezed out excess moisture. No sugar or hot sauce.  Used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, 1/2 tea. Dill, 1/4 tea tarragon, and extra egg.  Tony's had enough salt, but used ground fresh pepper.  My family loved it, will make this way again, maybe with mushrooms.

I did not have the spicy pork sausage on hand, instead I had bulk sweet Italian sausage, so that is what I used. Chopped up a small green bell pepper also and viola!!! Everything else was done to the letter. Love the recipe. Easy to make, easy to add your own touches to make your own, family wanted seconds!!

This was fabulous!  Changes I made were minor (sage sausage and "fiesta blend" cheese, only because that's what I had on hand), and the quiche was a huge hit with my husband and 10 year-old son.  Everyone had seconds, and my son had thirds.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for posting this one!

I made this without the crust and it still kept together well, However, it may have been that I used sharp sheddar but this was so so rich we could not bare to eat more than a small piece. The flavor was good just way too strong. Im willing to try again but using a crust mild cheddar and less sausage.

Yummy! The only thing that I added was some diced tomatoes and lots of hot sauce!
