Excellent! I haven't had crepes like this since I was little. I added an additional 1/4 cup of milk though which thinned the batter out and made it easier to make thin crepes. I read the other reviews and it sounds like they may just have their pan too hot. Start off low with just enough butter to coat the pan well. The gradually increase the heat and again decrease if it starts to turn the butter brown quickly. Reapet the bit of butter on each crepe that is cooked. This helps it get it's outer edge crispness without being dry. Yummy!

Iv'e never had crepes before, but I really liked this recipe. One problem I had was that the first crepe used all the margarine and the skillet was too hot then to add more. Maybe butter works better.

I liked this recipe, but I'd make a few changes... I like an eggier, softer, sweeter crepe.  I'd add an extra egg or more milk to make it less tough; a tsp. of vanilla to give it a really good flavor; and I used about double the batch and a 1/2-3/4 cup for each batter.  I like the big crepes!  All in all, pretty good!

This is a very simple and easy recipe. I found the batter a little too thick so added some extra milk. They didn't have a strong taste which means this recipe works well for both sweet & savoury (I made savoury ones).

These are so tasty, I personally topping them with chicolate sauce.  It is so easy and it is really worth it!  You have to make sure that they are REALLY thin, or else they will end up being pancakes.  Try not to tear the mini-pancakes.

Finally I can make a wonderful crepe!  Thanks for the recipe.  I was very happy not to have to set the batter in the fridge for 2 hours to two days as some other recipes call for. The crepe itself has a very nice texture and appearance and was very easy to work with.

Simple, easy and tasty.  Nice recipe.  The only thing I did was reduce the amount of butter put into the pan.  First crepe turned out horribly deformed (still tasty though).

They didn't turn out very well for me. I tried making them because a teacher made them for me years ago, but I couldn't get them to be crisp (even when I accidently burnt one) and they were heavy tasting.

It turns out fantastic every time. The recipe is perfect as it is. I would recommend using 2% milk because anything more "whole" thickens the mix, which makes it harder to spread around the pan quickly enough. I love munching on these even without anything in them. Sometimes instead of adding salt, I add sugar. Love them! Thanks.

Great recipe! i added a little more milk to thin them out and i also added a tsp vanilla, and about 3 tbsp sugar... just to sweeten things up.  Also, after flipping them i sprinkled them with a cinnamon-sugar mix. Really sweet and great by themselves with powdered sugar and syrup!

My dad used to make crepes but never taught me how...this really brings me back.  Very easy to follow, minimal ingredients and quick cook time.  The only problem you'll have is to try not to eat the completed crepes while you are making new ones!  We actually used to put sour cream and/or strawberry jelly and rolled them up.  Yum!!

I think this recipe is perfect. As others have said, it is not sweet or salty, so you can serve it with whatever you like.  Use plenty of butter to coat the pan, and then swirl batter around, to make sure it thins out and coats the surface.  I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and had the crepes with raspberry preserves.  Yum!!!

One of the easiest things that'll make your friends say, "Wow!... You can make ___?!?!?"  I recommend a skillet-load of scrambled eggs, mushrooms, sausage/bacon, bell peppers, onions, and a bit of garlic to put into the crepe.

A nice easy recipe! I used almond milk in place of milk and sprayed my pan with canola oil instead of using butter. I also cooked over a low medium heat to prevent burning. They came out golden and thick, so I recommend using a little more milk if you want them thinner.

Pretty good recipe... A bit to thick so I just added more milk. Over all they were quite yummy! :) I took apples and cooked them with brown sugar and butter over the stove and put them in the crepes and they were great with the apple!

Great recipe, Sally!  For a twist you can add 1/2 tsp of cocoa in the dry ingredients and have some awesome cocoa crepes.

Very simple. I added a little sugar and vanilla to the mix. No recipes state how to dress them. This is the first time I've made Crepes. So we used what we have. Put cool whip and fresh blueberries on the inside and wrapped them up. Yum. :)

Excellent recipe! My only complaint is that the batter's just a bit too thick. I added 2 tablespoons of milk and that improved the consistency greatly.

i really love the simplicity of this recipe.  i took the advice of others and added more milk for a thinner batter, and i'm glad i did.  the batter was easily spread out to a circle.  i also added a splash of almond extract because i felt "nutty."  may i add, the taste was fantastic... especially with whipped cream.

I too had a hard time with this recipe. The batter is too thick. I added one more cup of milk and it came out perfectly. You were definetly going in the right direction. I also added for personal preference a dash of allspice and a teaspoon of vanilla.

I love this recipe. I only cook for 3 people, so I like this one because it doesn't make as many crepes. You can make more by increasing the amount of milk from one cup to up to two cups, and it will still be delicious. I love them with Nutella!

This recipe is awesome. I have made these about a half a dozen times now. We love these. My husband could eat these everyday for breakfast if I made them. My husband like them with butter and sugar on them and I like mine with nutella on them. Thanks for a great recipe.

sooo easy! we have made them with water instead of milk before and it worked well (alergy), just a little less flavor.  Last time i made them i used a little of non dairy french vanilla creamer (probably about 1/8 cup for double batch-that much less milk) and it was super sweet too!

These were perfect! The first crepe was a little dense, but I added a little milk and everything was fine. This was my first time making crepes, and it was way less complicated than I expected.

Very easy for this first timer!! Next time, I might add a little more liquid, or lower the flour to get it a little thinner so it spreads around the pan a little better. Not a recipe error, just to help out a novice :) I stuffed with a combination of nutella, milk, and chocolate chips that I melted together in the microwave and topped with chocolate syrup, bananas, and coconut (trying to mimic IHop)

Great taste, however very thick batter for a crepe.  I adjusted this by adding more milk and ended up with a thinner desert crepe! I suggest adding more mil or you will have a pancake that tastes like a crepe

I'm living in Vietnam for the year and I don't have an oven, measuring cups/spoons, and any kitchen appliances besides a two burner stove and a small fridge. This is quickly becoming a go-to recipe for breakfast as ceral and cereal bars aren't readily available either. :)

Easy and delicious. I never knew crepes were this simple to make! I increased the milk to 1 and 1/4 cup and replaced the butter with olive oil spray. It turned out excellent- perfect consistency. I spread a thin layer of homemade jam over the top and rolled the crepes up. They were gorgeous.

I lived in France with a family for awhile, and my host mother always made crepes for a quick dinner. This recipe is the closest I've found to hers. The only change I made was adding about 1/2 extra milk for thinner crepes. Also, the recipe should yield about 6 crepes, not 3

If you add some oil into the crepe recipe and use a non-stick frying pan, it works much better. You dont have to continue adding butter and it comes out of the pan much easier.

enjoyed this crepe recipe, filled them with cream cheese, a spot of sugar and a few mini choc. chips, topped with whipped topping and cinnamon.  big hit with the kids.  felt the crepes were a little heavy but that might have been my own inexperience.  will definitely make this recipe again.

Sad to give a bad review, but I made these for my husband's birthday breakfast and together we decided we were eating something that tasted more like a tortilla than a crepe.  So I dumped a bunch of sugar in and thinned it out with some more milk and that helped a bit...but only a bit!

Horrible recipe. When I follow a recipe I want to follow it and not have to add extra milk to thin out the batter. This recipe should be labelled simple pancakes cause a 1-1-1 ratio makes a thick batter. Won't be using this recipe again. HORRIBLE

I found it was too thick how it was. I would recommend adding more milk, and if you put too much, add flour to thicken it a bit. Otherwise taste good and makes great sweet crepes!

Pretty good! Really easy. I made a cream cheese and banana topping on it! Would probably be excellent with strawberries.

Made these for breakfast while babysitting, kids were skeptical at first but after the first bite the stack of crepes were gone. We put chocolate chips, brown sugar, and maple syrup down the middle. They were amazing.

Very easy to make; I love that doesn't have sugar or butter as other receipes. I also found it a bit thick, I just added a bit of water to make it thinner.... I also added 1tsp of ammareto :)

They were a little rubbery, but they were pretty good with strawberries and chocolate sauce. Pretty decent recipe. :)

We love these simple crepes.  We filled with chocolate pudding one time and another time we filled with cut up strawberries and blueberries drizzled with chocolate sauce.

Yes, start with these proportions, but add a little more milk until it looks pretty runny. And make sure your pan is HOT. Then you'll have great crepes!

This is a great, easy recipe!  I read the other reviews and decided to add the extra egg one recommended and more milk.  A large cast iron skillet works great for this, be sure to put a little butter in before each crepe.

The thought of making these is very intimidating!  I once made a crepe and my 24 year old son said great craps mom!  I will not make these but if I may tweak the system I would give anyone brave enough to do and share this recipe 10 stars!!!!!!!!!1

turned out PERFECTTT! used 1 3/4 cup milk, 2 egg yolks, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1tbsp melted butter mixed into the batter. I sprayed the pan with pam and took the pan from the heat when dropping in my batter. They turned out sooooo GOOD, and it was easy.

This was ok. It's hard to get them very thin because it cooks before I have time to spread it out! They never got very crispy and even if they did the center was uncooked. Also the first one absorbed all the butter (so I suggest a light cooking spray on a teflon pan) But for my first time making them they were ok with pizza sauce and melted mozorella cheese (a local restaurant makes "pizza crepes") Next time I'll thin out the batter a little and not use any butter.

These crepes looked beautiful and were pretty easy to make, but their flavor was debatable. I tried them with multiple fillings and never found anything I liked.

Absolutely perfect crepes!!! Didn’t change a thing! Love them with just a bit of butter, cinnamon sugar and rolled up! I would suggest YouTubing how to flip a crepe however, because these are much tricker than a pancake to flip!!!! Enjoy!!

Very poor recipe. So far from what traditional crepes are like. The batter stuck was to thick and was very bland to the point where I have to add sugar and vanilla just to be able to eat it.

Great recipe! Instead of whisking it I decided to use my blender, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and did about a cup and a half to 2cups of milk because the batter was too thick.

These don't have to crisp.  Someone said they tried to get them to.  Crepes are meant to be pliable because most of them are filled and rolled.  My favorites are spinach and ham with a bechamel or Parmesan mornay sauce.  Amazing!

Turned out perfect. I added a touch more milk is all, but couldn’t believe how easy and good they turned out. I used cooking spray in the pan and mine took more like 4 minutes per side. Thank you for posting.

Although the flour and egg mixture looked like a hot mess, once I started adding the water/milk slurry it loosened up nicely and the butter just added a silky texture. Cooked up nicely, didn’t stick and were light as air.

these were very good I just had to add more milk because they were not quite runny enough to spread on the pan easily. I will use this recipe again.

This recipe is not good. The proportion of milk and flour are the same and they can't be. They need to be closer to 4 to 1. The recipe needs to be 1 cup of milk and 1/4 flour so the batter is really thin making a paper thin crepe.  The recipe the way it is came out like dough.

The crepes themselves weren't too bad, but the batter was on the thicker side. Crepes should be light and not doughy, so if you add some water to the batter they turn out better.

Good basic recipe. However, batter is far too thick. Don't put hat milk away, you'll need much more.

This is one of the better recipes I've tried for crepes. They have really nice crispy edges. I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter. I also added vanilla, a dash of sugar, and used a little half and half with 2% milk. Definitely keep the temp low and I reapplied crisco after every two crepes.

I liked it, but the batter was to thick. In stead of large thin crepes, I got small fat pancakes. I suggest you add more milk or egg. Other than that it was perfect!

This was an easy recipe. I put everything in a blender at night, gave it a whirl, used in the morning after a quick whirl again. Made pumpkin crepes by adding some cinnamon and ginger in the batter, topping with a scoop of pumpkin roll filling (Pumpkin Roll II), buttermilk syrup, and sprinklings of powdered sugar and cinnamon. The batter is thick and there are other recipes available that spread easier.

turned out great. after reading the reviews I cooked on medium-low heat and I added a dash of sugar and vanilla extract to the batter. I used a medium pan (the desired size of crepe) with a small amount of butter added to coat the pan after each. crepe. They came out the perfect texture and flavor. I filled with strawberries and whip cream then sprinkled a sugar/cinnamon mixture to the outside. For me this recipe makes closer to 5 or 6 crepes.

This recipe was very quick and easy, which is amazing, but the batter was a little thick so I added some vanilla and some more milk and that seemed to work out okay. they tasted okay not much flavour though. Maybe add some sugar to the recipe. for this recipe i would use 
1 cup flour
1 1/4 cup milk
pinch of salt
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup sugar

this was good! I am not much of a cook however, i critiqued it a bit. I added 2 eggs, and a dash more of milk (i like it smooth and not thick) and i also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract! (to add sweetness) it turned out so well.

Great simple recipe.  Very easy!  Be sure to not pour in too much batter or your crepes will be more like pancakes.

I thought it tasted delicious. This coming from someone who has picky kids. They ate it up! It was very easy to cook and took little time.

Really good but thick. Like other comments mentioned to do, I added 1/4 cup more milk.

Recipe comes out too thick. Thinned out with a little extra milk. Used with lemon curd and with either sweetened blended cottage cheese, strawberries, blueberries or chocolate sauce. But our favorite way is a sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice! They go down as fast as I can cook them.

So easy and it tastes exactly like the restaurant kind.
