This little gem is what helped me stick to the diet.  No need to cheat when stuff like THIS is "legal"!  I used 1 sugar free fudgesicle, 1 tbsp of peanut butter and 2-3 tbsps of the new sugar free Cool Whip.  Yummy.

This was great. After the fourth day on this diet it was much needed. One tablespoon of whipped cream and one tablespoon of peanut butter is enough, more would be too strong.

The consistency is a little unappetizing, but the flavour is great and when you're dieting that's all that counts. I only use 1 Tbsp all-natural peanut butter and omit the "frozen whipped topping" because I find it revolting. ;-) I'm going to try another reviewer's tip of melting a Tbsp of PB, and dipping the no-sugar fudgsicle into it. That would be YUM!

After 5 days on South beach and going to many birthday parties and social events I almost broke down and had ice cream with my family ...then I had saw this recipe and thought I would try it but thought it would not make me feel full or like I had a special treat ....WOW was I wrong ...this is a AWESOME dessert after not having sugar for so many days ........please please try this before you break your eating plan to have something sweet and not on south beach ...it will get you through !! It was even a bigger helping than I needed and I felt so full after I got done but ...NOT GUILT cause it is all on the plan !!

This is my favorite SB desert. Even my husband loves it.  It is very creamy.  It reminds me of soft-serve peanut butter and chocolate ice cream.  Yummy yummy.

While this doesn't taste EXACTLY like a peanut butter cup, it DOES taste exactly like the ice cream version of it.    You would never say this is low fat or low sugar!  What a delightful way to get your Reeses fix while dieting! =o)

VERY GOOD, I DONT MICROWAVE FOR MORE THAN 12 SECONDS OR SO, OTHERWISE ITS COMPLETELY MELTED BY THE TIME YOU STIR IN PEANUT BUTTER,AND I LIKE IT WHEN ITS STILL COLD. I ONLY USED ONE TBS OF PEANUT BUTTER TO LOWER THE FAT CONTENT, STILL WAS DELICIOUS AND SATISFYING!!

I love this. I also only put tbsp of PB and I use the Smuckers all natural. After mixing it together I refreeze it for a few minutes. This is a great way to satisfy my chocolate/peanut butter cravings.

What a lifesaver!  My husband said these were ok, but he's more of a salt junkie.  I was really worried about satisfying my sweet tooth on this diet, especially in Phase 1.  This did the trick.  I took the advice of another reviewer and refroze this. I melted the fudgsicle, added the light p.b. and ultra low fat nutriwhip.  Then, I poured them in to ice cube trays (makes about 4 cubes).  I have one cube after dinner and it satisfies my craving.  Thanks!

My husband loves this dessert!! I think it is one of the main reasons he has been so successful on his SB diet. He has a sweet tooth and this hits the spot. If he had completely denied himself of dessert, I don't think he would have stayed on the diet long.

So yummy and satisfying if you are a chocolate/peanut  butter fan! I'm a little nervous about it being 300 calories per serving, so I would probably only use 1TB of PB and cool whip.

This tasted MUCH better than I was expecting. It may be a bit rich for some, but I thought it was delicious and my husband is now addicted. It tastes so good you almost feel guilty even though it is allowed on South Beach phase II :-) Enjoy! Oh...you HAVE to try Smuckers all Natural Peanut Butter...no trans fat, no sugar added. It is absolutely delicious and you may never go back to regular peanut butter again!

This is a great dessert!!! I can't believe that we're able to have it in Phase 1! My boyfriend loves peanut butter and we're doing the diet together. He was so happy to see that I made a dessert with peanut butter in it. We will be having this dessert for the rest of the time we are in phase 1. Thanks a bunch!!

As so many have said, yum yum yum! Only one tbs of peanut butter is enough and it cuts the calories in half. I thought of re-freezing it because the texture was so soft, but I couldn't stop eating it to do so. Maybe next time, I'll make a batch in advance.

This recipe is a lifesaver for me.  I'm a South Beach Dieter, and this is wonderful.  It reminds me of a mousse, and is SO easy to throw together.  I use natural peanut butter to make it even more diet friendly!  Love It!!!

I'm only giving it four stars because I kind of changed the recipe.  All I do is put a sf fudgsicle in a bowl for a few minutes, add a tbs of chunky pb, and mix it together for some DEELISH choc peanut butter ice cream.  This truly has saved my diet.

This dessert is wonderful and reminds me once again that no sugar added fudgsicles should be on the grocery list of everyone starting south beach.  I may try it with fruit when phase 2 starts.

This recipe is a "MUST HAVE" if you are on the South Beach Diet. Even my kids, who are extremely picky eaters, LOVE this recipe.  They have requested it every day since I first made it!

I don't think this tastes like a Reeces, but it does have a great flavor and texture - very smooth & creamy. My hubby and I used to eat peanut butter chocolate shakes - this takes the place of our wanting that.

My husband and I have each lost over 15 pounds in a little over a month on the SB Diet. We've never felt like we're suffering like most diets.  The PB cup recipe is almost too sweet after not eating any rich foods. But next time I'm using less PB. Makes a wonderful once or twice a week dessert. Certainly puts an end to those sweet treat cravings you might have.

To save on time and calories, I just microwave 1 teaspoon (I love peanut butter but 2 tbsp. is too much) red. fat peanut butter and dip the fudgsicle in it. The peanut butter is a great compo with the fudgsicle and it takes the edge off the artificial sweetner taste. I tried it as the recipe states a couple of times and was never happy with the consistancy.

Really tastes like peanut butter cups.  FYI, if you completely melt down the fudge bar, then stir in the whip cream and the peanut butter, you can pour the mixture into the foil cups and put the wooden sticks back in and refreeze them, I used low calorie low carb bars, and Simply Jif, and they tast SO good!!

I can't sing this recipe's praises enough! I'm not doing South Beach, but I LOVE my chocolate and peanut butter, so this totally satisfies the craving. I like to use crunchy pb for texture, though I use more whipped topping to make it "fluffier." Have turned several friends onto this (and had to fight my kids over the fudgsicles!) - they are all grateful for the recipe!

Awesome for what it was!  It was an extra treat instead of the same ol' plain fudge pop.  I'll make it again to be able to stay in Phase 1.

This really hits the spot when sweet cravings are making you climb the walls. I serve it deconstructed so you can choose a combination of whipped cream with peanut butter, or icecream with whipped cream, or...  you get the idea. Definitely recommend this one highly if you are on South Beach. =)

i have been craving sweets for the past four days.  Specifically chocolate ice cream.  This REALLY hit the spot...i used sugar free cool whip instead of the lite though.  so good if you like peanut butter chocolate ice cream.  you won't miss the sugar.

This recipe was amazing!! Like some other people, I stirred 1TBS peanut butter and 1TBS whipped topping into the slightly melted fudge pop to make a yummy peanut butter chocolate ice cream. It makes the perfect amount to satisfy your sweet tooth without going overboard on the calories. Great recipe!!

To me, this was really gross! It was too sweet, even with only 1/2 the peanut butter. I hated it and couldn't even finish it.

Oh my Goodness!  I was wanting something chocolate and peanuty NOW...and so, I just put one TEAspoon of PB (only 2 carbs) directly on my sugar free fudgesicle.  That's it.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  Took care of my *need it now* craving.

Mmmmmmmm....good! A lifesaver - I'm a sweet eater and since being on SB, I've curbed that, but this is great because ice cream is my favorite, makes me feel like I'm cheating.

Very Good - Delicious - I like to put it back in the freezer for a little while before I eat it.  Yummy!

FABULOUS!!  I defrosted the ice cream for 15 seconds in micro, stirred ingredients together and then re-froze the dessert in covered dish for 30 minutes...came out great!!

I enjoyed this snack, and it does taste very similar to a peanut butter cup!  It isn't an attractive dessert, but when you're trying to lose weight any dessert will do!

I actually just made this and it was really good BUT I was doing the recipe from memory and I was doing 2 servings yet I accidentally put in the peanut butter and whipped topping amounts for 1. I used Simply Jif peanut butter which cut the carbs way down! It was really good even with the less amount!
I am wondering though if anyone has tried freezing it in little spoonfuls and how that would taste!

Thank you! Thank You! Thank You! This is a delicious dessert for the South Beach Diet. I've been going crazy without my daily chocolate fix being on this diet, so this definitely helped. YUM!

This is one of our favorites!  It is also a big hit with company.  It is hard to find good recipes that are good for you.
