I thought this recipe was really good. The cayenne pepper adds a nice little bit of heat. I went back for seconds. Because the first review said it tasted too vinegary I added the red wine vinegar 1/2 Tbs at a time, but I'm pretty sure by the time I was done adding that it was pretty close to the called for amount and I didn't find it overpowering at all.

I made 2 small changes.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen which I sautéed in about 1 tbs EVO.  The other was I started with 1/8 cup of red wine vinegar and added to taste.  I probably used about 1/4 cup total.  We enjoyed this it was a nice change of pace and I will make it again.   Thank you!

I reduced the vinegar, as suggested, but it was way too tart for me. It made me make a terrible sour face! I couldn't finish it, but my husband liked it ok.

Very tasty! I reduced the vinegar to 1/3 cup, and with 1/8t cayenne pepper, it was deliciously spicy and tangy without being overpowering.

We really enjoyed this combination of flavours.  It was used as a dip with tortilla chips instead of as a side dish.

Some liberties were taken with ingredients: frozen spinach was replaced with fresh, steamed spinach;  rice wine vinegar was used instead of red wine vinegar (none in house).  Like others, the amount of vinegar was cautiously monitored by taste, but the measurement came out to a little less than what was listed.

This recipe is a keeper.  It turned out to be a great appetizer, and we'll use it in the future for a side dish.

This recipe had way too much vinegar in it.  I would recommend using a different thinning agent -- maybe olive oil? -- for this... maybe with a little vinegar.

This was horrible. Too much garlic, too much vinegar. Will not be making this again. I threw it out.

I made this tonight as part of a Mediterranean meal that also included chicken souvlaki and insalata caprese. The three things went well together.  The spinach was good, though as with others here I used much less vinegar- 2 tbsp. Other minor changes were using a bunch of fresh spinach and also a fresh cayenne,  torn in half
