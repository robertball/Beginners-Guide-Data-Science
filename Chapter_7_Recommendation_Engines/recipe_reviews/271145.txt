I doubled the recipe and used two 8x8 glass baking dishes. I followed the recipe precisely and then sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I ended up baking for about 25 minutes and then sprinkled some powdered sugar on top once they were out of the oven. They were good but way too many blueberries-you could barely see or taste the pancake....I would recommend about 1/2 the amount of fruit.

Easy and quick for those busy scheduled mornings.  Tasted and looked delicious.  My husband doesn't care for blueberries for I made his with bananas and pecans.  Will make it again.
