This is a good recipe for late summer when many of the ingredients are fresh and in season. I added a chopped green pepper and a banana pepper. I sauteed the onions and peppers in a small amount of olive oil for a few minutes, before adding the stock and other ingredients.I substituted frozen baby lima beans for green beans. I had fresh basil from the garden available and used about 1/2 cup of chopped basil along with about 4 medium sized roma/plum tomatoes (chopped) and added that to the corn. I did not bother with pesto sauce since I added the ingredients directly into the soup at the end.

I have a large family and few of them tend to like any given dinner. My most finicky eater pronounced this a very good soup and even had seconds! Thanks for a simple and fabulous soup!

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have tomato puree on hand so I used tomato sauce and thickened it with a bit of corn starch.  VERY EASY!  Served with garlic bread and this was a filling meal.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I don't particularly love the soy sauce, but once you add the basil-sauce mixture, this soup is good.  I'd suggest using your favorite broth instead of soy sauce, if you don't like a lot of soy sauce in foods.  I substituted the vegetables to suit my tastes (more potatoes, no corn, used fresh tomatoes in the sauce), and I will make this again using broth, instead of soy sauce.  I do really like how the sauce in step 2 adds a nice flavor!

This soup was pretty good, and could have been made with or without the tomato basil sauce, especially if bullion was added.  It may have been because I was cooking for 50 girls, but the potatoes took quite a while to cook.  A great recipe!

This soup was just okay. It wasn't as flavorful as I like my soups to be.

This is a very good vegetable soup.  I used low sodium soy sauce, and I agree with another reviewer that it could be made with or without the tomato basil sauce, but I like it with better.
