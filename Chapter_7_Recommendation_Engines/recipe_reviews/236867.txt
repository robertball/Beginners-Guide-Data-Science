This one is a "keeper"! My husband said he'd like it again! This stroganoff was different than the tomato-based one that I usually make, and we loved it! It has a hearty, rich flavor. I didn't have to adjust any of the seasoning, and the thickness was perfect, which doesn't always happen in a crock-pot recipe. I had all of the ingredients, and didn't change a thing. Looking forward to more recipes from Ann. Thanks, Ann!

I should probably start off by saying that stroganoff is one of my favorite meals but I'm pretty picky about it. I looked through this website for a while looking for a recipe that looked good and not too complicated. This was the perfect sunday recipe, just layer and let it go for a few hours. I wasn't sure what wine to use so I just used the cabernet sauvignon I had on hand. I did follow the recipe except two small changes. When I was putting salt and pepper on the stew meat I also added a bit of paprika.  I also could not find dried chives so I just left them out. I think the way it was written the recipe is great, but it came out delicious my way too. None of the changes were very large. I just have a few things to point out. 1) warm the cream cheese up to room temperature to let it soften and consider breaking it into small chunks. 2) a tablespoon of paprika really adds some nice flavor to red meat dishes. 3) I really like a savory flavor so I might double the Worcestershire sauce the next time I make this. This recipe is definitely a keeper too. Satisfying, and quite simple but also I believe it is a bit healthier than some of the other recipes I have seen.  

Update: I’ve made this recipe many times now. Everyone I’ve fed it to loves it.  I do add the paprika, and double the Worcestershire sauce. I add chives when I have them but that isn’t a deal breaker to me. This is one of my favorite recipes to come home to after a long day.

I can't tell you how appreciative I am that pretty much all of you, save a few, love my stroganoff. I get excited every time I get notification that someone else has posted a review.  

I wish you all a very happy, safe, healthy, & prosperous new year!

This was wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the red wine because I didn't have any.  Used water instead.  I found that the sauce was a little thick but maybe some of the moisture cooked away.  Will watch and maybe add some additional water next time.  Flavor was fabulous!  My guests loved it!!  Will certainly make again.  Thanks!

L O VE D this recipe. Family is of German descent and everyone loved it. Stroganoff should be more than beef and gravy enhanced with sour cream..this truly is! Made to the recipe for a double recipe and a single recipe leaving out onions and chives. Truly didn't make a lot of difference. The red wine was the answer to a full flavor! Awesome ,.. This will be my GO TO stroganoff from now on! Thanks

I'll be honest, I have NEVER rated a recipe before online, but this was absolutely too fantastic not to rate! The only thing I added, which probably wasn't necessary, but I did anyway, was added about 3/4 can of Golden Mushroom soup. This recipe is definitely the one and only crockpot/slow cooker beef stroganoff that we will use over and over again! Thank you for posting this masterpiece!!

Recipe was delicious! Made a few modifications. Used trader joe's cream of mushroom soup and sautéed mushrooms, onions and garlic in butter, then added red wine and reduced until thickened.  Still added red wine called for in recipe to stroganoff sauce.  Best stroganoff I've ever made....thank you cwmom98.

This was okay, but I guess I was expecting more, considering all the ingredients that went into. However, I did make the mistake of adding 1/3 too much sour cream because I read the directions wrongly. Then when I taste-tested it, I found it to be quite bland, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra worchestershire sauce. In the end, it still didn't have quite as much flavor as I was hoping it would. I think I'll go back to my much more simple and much more flavorful stroganoff recipe, which is basically just some sour cream mixed with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.

The Wine, Cream Cheese, and Chives really set the recipe apart from the meager fare so often associated with an easy dish.  This is worth keeping, and really enjoy it!

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful. If you have time, there are a few things you can do to make it even better. I seared the cubes of chuck in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a bit of vegetable oil until each piece had a nice brown crust (Don't buy "stew meat" in the package if it's more expensive per pound than a chuck roast, it only takes a few minutes to trim and cube it  yourself.) I transferred the browned meat to the slow cooker and reduced the heat to medium. I tossed in a couple tablespoons of butter and added the onions and a pinch of salt. Once the onions are soft and taking on some color, I tossed in the mushrooms and cooked them until they release their moisture and then get nicely browned. I then deglazed pan with the wine, and poured the mushrooms, onions, and wine to the cooker. The only other change I made was mixing the cornstarch and flour with water instead of the wine, since I used the wine for deglazing the pan. The result was even better than the first time I made it, so the extra steps are worth it, but this is super delicious if you just throw everything in the slow cooker. I served this mixed with some old-fashioned egg noodles, and it was to die for!

Instead of using mushroom soup, I used Golden Mushroom. Otherwise, I followed this recipe to a T. By far, the best Stroganoff I have ever had. It was, well, super duper. :-)

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and both stepkids and husband loved it. Do yourself a favor and don't deviate from the recipe-- there's no need to! When I make this again I will double the recipe, as everyone was fighting over the small portion of what was left over. :-)

Very good! Thank you! I did increase the amount of meat and used sirloin. Baby Bella’s are amazing in this dish! Even better the next day.

Very good! Beef was tender, sauce was super creamy, and the wine and worcestershire sauce added a well-rounded flavor. I even screwed up and cooked on high for 7 hours and it still turned out GREAT! Served over egg noodles. Yummy!

No.  I followed this recipe step by step.  My 2 girls loved it.  Just to show off, I even had my soon to be ex-wife over for dinner.  She's  gonna miss me and my cooking.  This was a perfect dinner on this winter day.

Fabulous recipe! I paired it with an Old World French Bread. Amazing dinner! I may leave the parsley out next time, not a huge fan. I also used Oak Leaf Brand Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine.

DELICIOUS AND SIMPLE, but I did not keep track of the cost. It seemed relatively economical since my wife and I both got lunch out of it too.

MAKING DINNER GREAT AGAIN!

Fantastic dish, juicy tender beef with  a rich, creamy, complex sauce.  Don't change a thing, excellent recipe just as it is. Thank you from the bottom of my taste buds. I will definitely be adding this to repertoire of winter comfort food meals.

Turned out great! I made it exactly as stated, but I did add a dash of paprika out of curiosity from the other reviews. Did 6 hours on low and cranked it up to high after I added the other ingredients for the 7th hour as I was hungry and impatient. Meat was tender and the flavors were developed. Will definitely make again!

I think it could have used more meat. The sauce to meat ratio was off. I'd probably put 2-2.5 lbs. in next time. Also, I didn't have red wine so I used a half cup of cranberry juice with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and it tasted great.

This recipe, as written, is delicious! Dummy here forgot to add the parsley at the end but it didn't detract any from the flavor. So I have a nice bunch of fresh parsley hanging out in the fridge... maybe I'll dress up the oven roasted potatoes I'm making tonight with them. Great job cwmom98!  :)

Delicious.   Next time I make it, I'd add more meat and less wine but, overall,  it was great.

I used Sherry instead of Red Wine as that it what I had on hand. I also forgot to whisk the corn starch and flour into the Sherry, but it turned out fine. Flavors were amazing, prep was relatively easy. Will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.

This was great!  I swapped out the condensed cream of mushroom soup for golden mushroom soup.  I also used beef stock instead of water.  Everything else I kept the same.

Every recipe needs tweeting according to personal taste. That said, it was decent, but unless you "need to use a slow cooker"...cook it classic  stove top...subsitute "plain cream cheese with "cream cheese and chive flavor...for more intense flavor instead of chives.

I love stroganoff and this was lovely. I like a really tangy stroganoff and add some finely diced gherkins and green peppercorns, but as it is it's a winner.

As always my husband said,  "the meat has no flavor."  So I said, "that is what the yummy sauce is for!!" I thought this this was delicious and will make again.

I added frozen peas about 30 minutes before it was done. This was enough for about 5 meals for me. I froze some for later.
Sometimes I pour this over rice.

I made this last night and my family loved it!  We are a family with Celiac disease so substituted gluten free flour for the flour and gluten free Progresso Cream of Mushroom soup. The Progresso soup is not condensed so eliminated the 1/4 cup of water.  We served it over Jovial gluten free egg noodles. I didn’t have time to cook it an hour after adding the dairy ingredients so cut the cream cheese into small chunks so they would heat up and melt quickly. I also sautéed the mushroom on the stove and added with the sour cream and cream cheese. It was ready in about 10 minutes.  So delicious and easy. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

Just made this tonight! It was very good however both my husband and I agreed, a sirloin would have been better. We weren't huge fans of the stew meat.

Made this last night for 3 families. The only modification I made besides tripling the recipe was using golden mushroom soup. Oh so yummy! Everyone LOVED it. It was so good, I am leaving my first post on this site. Will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding! I borrowed a few tips from other reviews. I used Golden Mushroom soup, added Paprika with the salt and pepper on the stew meat and doubled the Worcestershire. The family was LICKING their bowl. Nuf' said

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have red wine and used a nice port wine instead and followed others' suggestion and used Golden Mushroom soup. I would proudly serve this to company.

Excellent well balanced and the meat so tender  - I added a 1/4 cup extra red wine and a 1/4 cup more water with the soup and used lite sour cream - I like the sauce a little loose so it covers more of the  egg noodles

Followed another user's recommendation and sauteed the cubed meat followed by sauteing onions, garlic, and mushrooms . Perfect! Lots of flavor.

I followed the directions and it was wonderful!  The second time I added twice the mushrooms and....deelish! I prefer less meat and more veg, though.  I also used plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  I LOVE this recipe and am right now making my third batch.

This is going in the go-to pile! This recipe is easy, affordable, and full of flavor. I really wish I hadn't forgotten to buy the parsley, because I know it would have been the bright finishing touch on the perfect winter dish. My husband has already asked me to make it again.

I've made this many times. It's my Sweetie's favorite. We use sherry instead of red wine. That's the only change.

I’m sorry, I was expecting more, given the great reviews. The onions should really be sautéed before, I didn’t care for the taste and texture of the onions otherwise. I also don’t think the red wine was necessary; it left a distracting taste (I do use good wine when cooking, son it’s not that). I grew up in a Ukrainian household and stroganoff was a staple. I thought I’d give this a try given that it used the slow cooker and is healthier than what I grew up with. Unfortunately, I found this version to be disappointing.

Didn’t like the flavor of red wine in the sauce. We threw it out.

I made this exactly as written, and my beef was tough the first day. Leftovers the next day were more tender and flavorful, partly because the alcohol taste of the red wine was finally gone then. I might skip the cream cheese next time. It didn't seem necessary. Tasty, but not quite right my first time making it.

I must have different taste buds than all these people giving five star reviews.  This stroganoff was good but not  better than average.  It needed more seasoning.  I will try it again but add more salt, pepper, onions, garlic, shiitake mushrooms and a bit of cayenne for depth.

This was amazing! I took the recommendations from the Jon Hennington review, only because he followed the recipe the first time, and then tweaked it the second time, which he said made it even better. Why wouldn't I try the even better one??  I seared the meat in oil to brown before adding to the crockpot. Then I cooked the onions in a couple TBSPS of butter and added to pot. And after that,  I cooked my bella brown mushrooms until the juices were released and added to the crockpot (at the beginning). I then deglazed the pan with the red wine and put that in the crockpot, too. I mixed water with cornstarch and flour rather than the wine since the wine was already used to deglaze the pan. I then followed the rest of the recipe the way it is written.  I also used fresh chives, rather than dried. This is absolutely the best beef stroganoff recipe out there and my 17 yr- old son said it's good enough for company. :):) Thank you for the recipe and thank you Jon Hennington for your review!

I used beef broth rather than wine. Next time I will cut out the water or back on the broth because it was runnier than preferred. Taste is good though.

Very simple and delicious recipe!  I used venison stew meat instead of beef, so it cooked slightly faster that the 6-7 hours noted.. but I was aware and adjusted the time. So good and so easy!  I didn't have the dried chives but didn't seem to notice anything missing without them.  Would recommend

I made this almost as written, but did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. I sautéed the mushrooms in 2T of butter and about 1/3+ cup Merlot (in addition to the red wine added to the beef). I also added the 1 T of paprika someone suggested. The sauce was perfect. I cooked on low for 6 hours, before adding the mushroom mixture, but I thought the meat was a bit overcooked, so I would try it at 5 hours next time. That said, I will make this again and would recommend it to others.

This is the one I'm making from here on - I added about 2/3 c Travicello red wine, substituted my home made yogurt for sour cream & used 4 cloves garlic. I had 2.7 lbs of stew beef and that meat literally fell apart with 1 bite! DELICIOUS!

Beef stroganoff is comfort food that always pleases.  Making it in a slow cooker really enriches the flavor, and using cream cheese gives it a wonderful texture.

Beef was super tender and sauce was good, but seasoning wise needs something. Would make again but experiment with some additions

Excellent! Only change to original recipe, was the addition of paprika to the meat and doubled the Worcestershire sauce, as another person recommended. This is the best stroganoff I’ve made in my 45 years of cooking!

I made it...but I used lean ground beef because we didn’t have beef stew meat or any roasts thawed. Also, I used rotini twist pasta since there weren’t any egg noodles in the cabinet. It was still amazing since I didn’t change anything else. I had a plate of it as did my husband and then he went back...and finished it off! He gave it a big thumbs up. Next time we will use stew meat and egg noodles and there will not be any left then either.

Wine isn't necessary. Too overpowering. I doubled the receipe for a family of 6 to eat. Filling. Tastes great minus that wine. Smells wonderful.

Pretty straight forward directions.  I substituted a shallot instead of an onion and I did not have cream of mushroom so I used some heavy whipping cream instead.  Also used sour cream with chives in it and no fresh parsley.  Came out great.  For seasoning I used Everglades Cactus Dust seasoning along with fresh cracked multu-color peppercorn and my wife and I enjoyed it very much.  Definitely cooking this one again.

This was delicious. I upped the Worcestershire sauce and the garlic and left out (because I didn't have it) the chive and the parsley. It was really warming and satisfying. The smell of it cooking all day filled the house. I will definitely make this again! Is tomorrow too soon?!

This recipe is wonderful.
I omitted the onions and substituted 1tsp of Maggie sauce for the bullion.
The aroma was a wonderful prelude to the fine meal this recipe created.

Superb! I doubled the mushrooms and decreased the beef. Called it "Mushroom/Beef Stroganoff." It was a huge hit. Had enough to share with a neighbor whose wife was just home from hospital after delivering first baby. THEY loved it, too!

I’ve made a number of stroganoffs and this one was the best! I pretty much followed the recipe since this was the first time making it.. the only exception being that I used 8 oz of cream cheese instead of half. Also I used Sherry since that was all I had. We all enjoyed it and it became an instant “repeater”!

I tried many Beef Stroganoff recipes, but this one is OUTSTANDING!  Whether it's 'authentic' or not, I don't care, b/c it's VERY flavorful.  I served this over buttered & parsleyed Egg Noodles, w/a Green Salad on the side.  Everyone loved this dish, including our 4 kiddoes, who are now developing a palate for good, not junk (thank goodness) food.  Thank you very much for this recipe   :-)

Great tasty easy recipe. 2 lbs Elk steak, added paprika, and extra chopped onion that I carmelized. Used pinot noir plus lots of beef boulion. I don't think I used full carton of sour cream. Didn't want it to become bland.

Sear the meat first.
I use beef base instead of bullion. Better beef flavor.
Red wine not necessary.
Use heavy cream instead of cream cheese. 
Serve with egg noodles. The best.

We loved it and my guests raved about it!! I don't think I've ever followed a recipe without modification before but mostly did it this time and it WORKED! I cooked 2.5 lbs of beef and didn't change any other ingredients except dumped in a bunch more worcestshire sauce bc we love that flavor, had no problems! Hint: the leftovers are even yummier.

I opt out the mushrooms. It still tasted delicious. Not a lot of slow cooker meals taste good to me. This recipe was awesome. I followed everything except the mushrooms part. The wine aroma smelled tasteful. At first, it wasn’t the consistency I had hoped for. As leftovers, it is twice as good plus the consistency came out has I had hoped the next day. Thank you for posting this!

First time making this and my intention was to follow the recipe as written. I started putting everything together and...no chives could found in the cupboard.  Everything else was as directed and the dish was extremely good tasting, even without the chives.  Since it’s just my husband and I, we had just enough of it leftover that we finished it up this morning by putting it over toast and scrambled eggs. Bonus, another great meal!  Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

I’ve been looking for a good stroganoff recipe and this one checked all the boxes. I thought the wine was a nice addition to most versions of this recipe. It added a tanginess to it that I thought made this one a step above the others. This one’s going to be my go to for stroganoff.

This is SO good. The week I found this recipe, my boyfriend asked me to make it again after the leftovers were gone. We had it twice in one week, that's how good it is! Didn't change a thing. This has been added to my hard copy cookbook!! Thank you!!

I am beyond pleased with this stroganoff! I think it may be the best one I've ever had! The flavor is unreal! Only modification was that I used garlic herb cream cheese instead of regular because, can there be too much garlic?! This is a favorite now! I have plenty for just me for the week!

This is a really good recipe. I am not a huge fan of the flavor of the cream cheese in the mix (and it tastes fine with out it) but hubby is, so I only add in about half of what the recipe calls for.

Holy Cow! This was amazing! I used leftover brisket I had in the freezer instead of stew meat, so it was already well seasoned. I used the garlic cream of mushroom soup and I left out the wine and added milk instead.  Other than that, I used all of the ingredients as listed. Paired with a beautiful romaine salad and home made buttermilk ranch and some jumbo flaky layers biscuits.  Incredible recipe! Thank you for submitting it. Will most definitely make again.

Easy to make and smelled wonderful as it was cooking.  It was tasty, but must admit folks said it wasn't "super-duper" delicious.  Somewhat bland.

Making this for the second time, and it is delicious! Making a double batch to last the week - it is super easy for my husband to heat up foe dinner while I am at work. I make this exactly as directed, using merlot wine. The wine adds such a depth of flavor.  This is definitely a go to recipe.

This turned out so well! I used ground beef instead of the stew meat because that's what I had on hand and it tastes amazing! I love the flavor that the red wine brings to it. Definitely a keeper!

This was the first recipe I have tried in a slow cooker.  I thought it was good but not great.  I thought it needed more flavor.  And after 6 hours in the slow cooker on low, the meat was a little mushy.   I probably could have stopped it at 5 hours.   I am still learning though.

So easy and so good!  Admittedly I used Golden Mushroom soup rather than the Cream of Mushroom but that's the only change I made.  My bf loves beef stroganoff and this will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Tried to make my own homemade egg noodles and that was kind of a disaster, lol, luckily I bought some Kluski noodles as back-up so that's what we had with it along with Pan-Fried Asparagus from this site.  Very good meal!

This is an amazing recipe! I've tried some of the other stroganoff recipes on this site and they always tasted like something was missing. This was absolutely delicious. My family devoured it all in one evening. I stayed mostly true to the recipe. The only alteration I made was to add 1 tablespoon of paprika. Thanks! :)

The sauce in this dish is thick and very rich and flavorful. Went very will with wide noodles. The beef was very tender . But I think there was just too much cream for the amount of beef. I used 1 1/2 lb. of sirloin stir fry beef instead of stew meet, a can of golden mushroom instead of cream of mushroom soup, and Chef John's Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream. When I make again I may not use the cream cheese and less sour cream.

First, the recipe itself is good. I think the thing that I didn't like was the cut of beef that I used. The package was labeled "stew meat" as the recipe indicated, but it was cut into cubes. They were fully cooked, but added a dry flavor to the dish. I think medallions would be much better. Otherwise, this dish is a winner! I can't wait to try it again using a different cut of meat.

Other than adding a little extra garlic, and using fresh chives, I actually followed the recipe very closely. The flavor profile was very nice - the combination of wine, bouillon,  sour cream, and cream cheese was rich and tangy. And it smelled SO GOOD as it simmered in the slow cooker! The thing that keeps it from being 5 stars in my book is that there was too much sauce in relation to the solids. I'll work on that next time.

This is a "go to" recipe for me! We work night shifts so when we come home at 0700hrs, I get my crock pot going and it smells like heaven when it's time to wake up.  I add the rest of the ingredients and all that is left to do is make the noodles! 
I'm going to try substituting the red wine for beef broth since I am out of wine right now (**EGADS!!!**) Thank you for this super simple (SUPER FAST!!!) recipe--we'll be making it for years to come! :)

Overall, easy good recipe. The wine gives it a some depth of flavor. I used beef stock in place of the bullion and water. Since I doubled the mushrooms my sauce was watery. So I used more cornstarch and beef stock. (About 2 -3 T each). I made it ahead and reheated it, adding the cream cheese, sour cream and parsley later.

I really loved this recipe and my family did too. I added a bit more of the fresh parsley. The only change I would make is to add a bit more meat to the recipe, I like my stroganoff chunky. I will be sure to make it again.

Made this for an early Christmas dinner with my fiancé and our kids. It was excellent and enjoyed by all! I made it with proportions for 10 people. The only alterations I made were based on other comments: used cream of golden mushroom soup, added paprika. It was wonderfully creamy which my group prefers to the tomatoey version. Served with egg noodles, oven roasted green beans, salad and crusty baguette. No sauce was left on any plate! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fabulous, so much better than other slow cooker stroganoff,  but I did make some adjustments. I doubled everything except the wine/flour/starch & sour cream, , substituted golden mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom, and added a packet of Lipton beefy onion soup mix.  My middleschooler actually packed the leftovers for her lunch the next day! She hates leftovers.

So easy to make.   The whole family really enjoyed the dish and the cream cheese made the texture perfect, not too heavy.  We'll make this again & again!

This was very Good!! My only changes were to add half the sour cream and added some cream cheese  also instead of the wine just used beef stock! Absolutely Delish my meat was super tender :)

Excellent recipe, just what I was looking for in terms of ease of preparation and wonderful flavor.  I used a tender cut of Sutter Sirloin sliced thinly and the meat was incredibly tender.   Cooked on High for an hour, then on Low for additional 5 hours.

OMG!  This was delicious and easy to make. So many layers of flavors.  My husband was a very happy camper.  Food disappeared off his plate in record time!!!  Followed the recipe exactly except added a little more of everything because added more meat.  The best we ever had.  I'll be making this all through the year for a great treat!!  Thanks.

I tried this recipe last night with my 16-year old niece doing most of the work (teaching her cooking.) It turned out great and the flavor was delicious. My only advice on the cooking time is to monitor the doneness of the meat. I found that 7 hours on low was a little long for the small cut pieces of stew meat I bought. The meat was falling apart and actually starting to harden. Other than that little nit, everyone enjoyed the dish over egg noodles. Probably the best beef stroganoff I have ever had. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe and my family really enjoyed it.  I made it as-written except I sauteed the onions and garlic first because I was feeling uncharacteristically motivated.  I also combined the other sauce ingredients and brought it to a boil with the onions (minus the sour cream, cream cheese and mushrooms) before pouring it into the crockpot since the sautee pan was dirty anyway and my meat was still pretty frozen.  Yup, I know you're not supposed to put frozen meat in the crockpot, but I did it anyway.  FYI - at first I was worried the sauce would be too thick, but after cooking, then adding sour cream, etc., it came out just right.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

It was very tasty.  There were two things I did differently.  I added just a tad of dry onion soup to punch up the flavor just a bit.  Since I like my stroganoff gravy thick, I separated the meat after cooking and poured the gravy into a sauce pan and reduced.  It was fantastic over buttered egg noodles!  Will use this recipe over and over.
