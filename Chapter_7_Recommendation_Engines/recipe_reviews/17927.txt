here's the problem... this isn't how you really make croissants... the first steps are fine to follow... after you get to the mix your 1 cup of flour with the butter DON"T DO IT!!. you don't make a good croissant that way.... instead i added the 1 cup of flour and kneaded it in... then i rolled it out into a rectangle and spread the better on ( like icing a cake) then you fold into thirds and chill... get it back out repeat until you have folded it at least 3 times ( 3x3 folds is 9 times on itself..)  then you can cut then let rise and cook... it came out splendid .

This recipe as it stands produces very doughy croissants.

This recipe as it stands is impossible to complete. The dough could not be rolled out because it was the consistency of a very sloppy cookie dough. I would suggest finding another recipe if you actually want to make croissants, instead of throwing away a hunk of unusable dough that has a lot of expensive butter and pastry flour.

I could not make this recipe work.  One other review from an experienced croissant maker said the recipe's fine if you do it right.  Some more detailed instructions might help - I'd like to try it again.  What's the trick?

I have a lot of experience making croissants, and if these are made right, they produce very good croissants.
