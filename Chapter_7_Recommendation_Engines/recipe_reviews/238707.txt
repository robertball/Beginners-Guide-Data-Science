These are ingredients I usually have on hand.  It was great!  I loved the spice in it and the texture was perfect. My guests enjoyed it as well and liked the option of not using tahini.  I don't write too many reviews but I wanted to make sure to give it 5 stars!  All I did differently was use some of the reserved juice from the can instead of water, 2T gave it a good consistency.  It's definitely worth trying!

Excellent recipe! So quick and easy. I used 3 large cloves of garlic and it really gave it quite the kick! Also used a little more cumin and added a handful of toasted sesame seeds. Very yummy!

Incredible, and super quick with an immersion blender. I had freshly cooked garbanzos and no tahini, and tried this. It's already gone! YUMMMM

I was a little worried that the sesame oil might give it a "weird" taste, but not so. Give it a try!

Great recipe!  I also added about a 1/4 tsp of paprika for a little more kick.  It's awesome!

This was the first time I have made hummus.  I generally enjoy hummus, but usually find it a little too bland for my taste.  I was going to make a traditional version, but ended up not having any tahini.  I had remembered seeing this recipe, so I decided to try it.  I was very glad I did!  The sesame oil and cumin add some nice additional flavor, and the next time I make it, I might try adding some other spices as well.  It was also very easy to make and clean up!

Very nice - tasty & easy!  Took to a baby shower with raw broccoli,  radishes, baby carrots,  & small spears of cuc and tri-color sweet peppers.  Lots of compliments ?? Had chickpeas in freezer (make a big pot & save til needed) so didn't rinse or mash- worked well. Also, did NOT add the water but a tad bit more lemon juice.

Amazing! It's delicious. I had a very things I changed with it but those were all personal preference.

Didn't have a food processor so I just mashed it into a pulp. No issues with texture/thickness at all!  Used water from chickpeas instead of fresh water, 1 tsp of minced garlic instead of fresh cloves, 1/8 tsp pepper, and added 1/8 tsp hot sauce. Perfection!

Wow! This was soo easy to make, and turned out impressively tasty. I had never made hummus without tahini before (which was always a nuisance for me because it was always an extra step to make it up...yeah I’m too lazy to go to the store and buy it, especially when it’s actually simple ingredients to make, just an extra annoying step in a process... but I digress) and the sesame oil is just perfect! I only ended up using about 1 T. Of the sesame oil and maybe 1.5T olive oil, and used some of the canned water for that part (as suggested by another reviewer), but it still turned out pretty amazing, and I will definitely be making this again! I’ll double the recipe next time, just cause this made about 2 cups total, and let’s face it, that’s not enough to last an hour in this house! Thanks for the great recipe!!

We eat a lot of hummus! And I have tried making hummus in the past with so so results. This will be on my weekly make list. Very tasty. I like that it uses sesame oil instead of tahini. As I usually have sesame seed oil on hand. I made this as written with one exception. I used  the liquid from the can of chickpeas in lieu of the water called for. It has a very good flavor as it is. I know that I can make it the base for all of our store bought hummus flavors by tweaking the spices and extra add ins. And it is so much less expensive to make than the store bought varieties. Thank you for a great recipe.

I’m pretty picky about hummus and loved this recipe! Even my 15 year old son said, “It’s good.” We’re doing a detox with him for health reasons and he hasn’t said that about anything we’ve made/tried. I added 1-2 t of freshly minced parsley and didn’t need the water. This is great for veggie dipping or a spread for sandwiches or wraps. Thank you for this recipe!

Very Good Just as it is.  I went old school with making this recipe. I used a potato masher instead of a food processor or blender. Think Mortar and Pestle.  So Good!  This took me 5 minutes to mash and stir.  I don't like to use appliances unless it is really necessary. Always on my toes. What if you have no electric? A big snow storm or any other storm. I'm just old school. Make everything by hand right down to my bread.

I did make changes because I discovered I didn't have all the ingredients.  I will make it again when I get them, because one of favorite flavors is Sesame Seed Oil.

After discovering I was out of olive oil... used coconut oil.

After discovering my sesame oil was Teriyaki Marinade and Sause, I used equivalent of that.   Everything else the same.
I have to say though the hummus I made is really good!

Great as is but like others I use the liquid from the can instead of water. This is a great recipe as is but I increase the amounts of liquid, lemon juice & garlic by one each, make sure the cumin is heaping and serve garnished with toasted sesame seeds

Excellent on freshly baked sourdough bread!  I didn't have tahini or sesame oil, but I had grape seed oil and used that instead. Was light and fluffy, and tasted great.  Can you freeze this?

Very good. My first time making humus. Used veggie sticks instead of pita. Nice appetizer.
