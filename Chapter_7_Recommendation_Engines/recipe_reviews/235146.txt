For this recipe, I used Extra Creamy Cool Whip and I omitted the nutmeg and increased the pumpkin pie spice to a full teaspoon. The kids thought this pie was fantastic........the grownups wouldn't eat any more past a bite. A little under half of this sat in the fridge until I threw it out. Easy? Yes. Did we like it? Not really.

I decided to bake the crust in a foil lined, 9” x 9” square pan instead of a springform pan.  When making the crust,  I added ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs and butter.  For the filling, I used 15 oz. of my own homemade pumpkin puree.  I omitted the ½ teaspoon of nutmeg and instead used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (recipe from this site: Pumpkin Pie Spice II).  After refrigerating the pie overnight, I lifted the pie out of the pan and cut it into squares.  This is a different version on traditional pumpkin pie and with the tweaks I made, we enjoyed this creamy, light and fluffy treat. This was the Allrecipes Buzz Recipe Group selection for October 4, 2014 and I will definitely make it again.  Thank you, luvtocook for sharing your recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  04, October 2014 ~ I made the pie portion as directed, but used a store bought graham cracker crust.  It is light and fluffy with good flavor.  It also cuts and plates very nicely so it would work well for company.

I made this for recipe group. I omitted the nutmeg and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead, since we are not huge nutmeg fans. I also mixed cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice into the graham cracker crumb crust before baking. Yum!

Made this for Recipe Group...Everyone really enjoyed this pie! I am only giving it 4 stars b/c I changed up the spices a bit (after reading the other reviews) by reducing the nutmeg by half and adding about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon. I used a prepared graham cracker crust, which worked great for this and sprinkled a bit more cinnamon on top. We thought the flavor was nice and light. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Super easy, I used low-fat cream cheese and cut the sugar down to 1/3. Our friends loved it. I does need overnight to firm up, I made it in the morning and it was okay but not as firm as I would have liked it.

I tried this recipe for a "Friendsgiving," and everybody loved it.
Instead of graham crackers, I smashed up 1 box of Vanilla wafers for the crust with the same amount of butter, but only half the sugar listed. I also added some freshly ground cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust mixture. It did take a bit longer than 10 minutes, however, to get the crust to a good, lightly-browned stage. 
I used prepared Cool Whip, but next time I would like to try whipping fresh cream instead. I bet this pie would taste great frozen as well, as I stuck mine in the freezer to help it set up faster.
I finished up the pie with a sprinkling of fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg on top, pretty and tasty!

Recipe Group Selection 10/4/2014 – I’m not a fan of nutmeg so I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I always use the back of a metal measuring up to shape the graham crust and you will find the crust holds up beautifully.  The pie is light and creamy, perfect for after a heavy meal.

Made for Recipe Group. It is very light, creamy, and fluffy. The crust holds together well and is easy to cut. Taste was just ok for me, a little too much nutmeg which I don't like very well. I would rather have a traditional pumpkin pie. We'll see how the family likes it. ...The guys love it! Thanks!

I made this as written, no changes whatsoever, for Thanksgiving yesterday. I thought it was amazing! The filling was so fluffy and creamy at the same time, the texture alone was awesome. I also really enjoyed the slight tang from the cream cheese. My kids on the other hand did not like it at all, because of that tang.  The pie was very easy to make, and quick, and the whole thing held up perfectly when I took the spring form off. Good thing about the kids not liking it: I don't have to share. ;)

I enjoyed this recipe and was glad to find it.  I'm not a fan of traditional pumpkin pie so I wanted to enjoy a pumpkin pie with everyone else on Thanksgiving.  This one was very light and I enjoyed that.  I would increase the amount of pumpkin pie spice next time.

Pumpkin pie isn't my favorite, but WHIPPED pumpkin pie is great! Make sure you get a full night or day in the fridge though to let it set up, it makes a big difference.

This pumpkin chiffon pie was a huge success!  My first attempt  at making my own graham cracker crust and it won't be my last! The recipe was so easy to follow and so delicious. We loved that it was in the springform pan instead of the traditional pie plate. Worth every calorie!

Success!! I made it for Thanksgiving and for my coworkers, so I used a 9x13 glass pan and an 8x8 and doubled the recipe. I used less whip cream and more cream cheese, though — went with ¾ bucket of cool whip and 2-1/2 cream cheese. I made my own pumpkin pie spice with a ¼ tsp of nutmeg, a half teaspoon of cinnamon and I ground 3 whole cloves.The office “guinea pigs” approve and so do I!

Ok, I am with Weight Watchers and what I did was I reduced the sugar by adding 1 package of Vanilla sugar free instant pudding.  It was darn good.  I made it for my husband on Friday and by Sunday he had eaten the whole pie!  With the points system it is quiet reasonable and allows us to indulge.  We loved the recipe!

Wow, this is an amazing recipe. While I was making it, I kept thinking "I'm missing something," but I stuck to the recipe and it was perfect. My whole family loved it. I'm not a pumpkin pie lover - this is in between a cheesecake and a pie, but much lighter and fluffier. All the flavor without the density that's sometimes just too much. And the crust...oh the crust! Amazing!

Yummy!! I made it sugar free and it was delicious! I made a great mistake. When I opened the canned pumpkin there was this very thick orange stuff sitting there instead of the pretty pourable pumpkin that I'm used to. I had picked up pure pumpkin instead. Well, it made it taste almost like pumpkin pie! Scrumptious! I put in 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon like people suggested. I used 2 tsp of a sugar substitute with the cream cheese and used sugar free Cool Whip. 

For the crust I used "Ridiculously Easy Chocolate Pie Crust" from "Chocolate Covered Katie". 1/2 C nuts ( I used pecans), 1/2 C coconut, 8 dates, and 3 Tb. chocolate. Mix in food processor and press into pie pan. I doubled the recipe and added in some of the spices from the pie.

Loved it! I did use a store bought crust. Also used the spices instead of the pumpkin pie spice only because I really like the flavor. I may change over and just make this one all the time. Loved the flavor and the lightness!

Yummy twist on a traditional pumpkin pie!  We live in the Southern Hemisphere, so Thanksgiving is always hot.  This pie gives us a lighter version of a family favorite.

I used heavy whipping cream instead of ready made whipped topping and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I didn't use a spring form pan either because I didn't have one and it turned out just fine using a regular pie pans.  We all loved it except it was a little too sweet.  Next time I will use less sugar in the filling  and none at all in the crust, which is sweet enough with just the graham crackers.  We loved the creaminess and fluffiness and I will make this again for sure.

This pie met my expectations: light, fluffy and sweet with a hint of pumpkin.  I prefer a traditional pumpkin pie myself, but it was a hit with my daughters.

This was a very nice & fluffy change to the traditional pumpkin pie. Very easy to make & I saved on time, because I purchased a pre made graham cracker crust. I taste tested a spoonful of the mixture before setting it into the crust. I felt as if the cool whip over powered the taste of the pie, & I would of liked a more dominant pumpkin flavor.  I decided to add 1 more tsp of the pumpkin pie spice & the nutmeg. I then tasted the pumpkin! My husband & I like this pie & we thought it was really good. I'll probably only make this pie again if I need a quick & easy pumpkin pie recipe.

My family really liked this twist on traditional pumpkin pie! Crust is great and the texture of the pie is really nice and smooth. It does cut pretty, as another reviewer pointed out. I decided to use cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice only because that's what I had in the cabinet. Also, I didn't have any prepared whipped topping so I made some with a dash of vanilla. Yum! My only tiny quibble would be that I did not taste the cream cheese as much as I would've liked. So next time I think I'll try it with a little more cream cheese- maybe one and a half packages?

Only change I made was eliminating the nutmeg and increasing the pumpkin pie spice a bit.  It was ok, but nothing special.

For a 10"  springform pan, double the ingredients plus 2tsps of cinnamon, 1tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp grd. cloves. I pulsed 1 box of gingersnaps, added 12 Tbsps of melted butter (could use a couple of tablespoons less up to 3) and 1/2c of sugar and baked it for 10 mins. I also used extra creamy whipped topping (×2 - 8 Oz containers). The batter was to die for! I could have eaten the whole bowl by itself.
Thank you so much for posting this simple and easily adjustable pie recipe @luvtobake!

This is my pumpkin pie from now on!  I used a Diamond walnut pie crust, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The pie is light and creamy, and the pumpkin and spice flavors are wonderful.

Great alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. Hubby likes graham cracker crust so this was a delicious choice.

I followed other reviewers idea to omit nutmeg, add extra pumpkin spice, and add cinnamon to pie and crust. It came out great. Next time I might use about half the whipped topping so it's a little less 'light'. The pie and crust didn't really stick together very well, they were like 2 separate pieces. I really liked it, but giving 4 stars due to all the changes to original recipe.

Not sure why, but mine didn’t taste right - it was not enough pumpkin flavour and the texture was weird.   Won’t make this again.

The pie tasted alright, but there are a few things I didn't like. Mind you, I followed the recipe word for word. First off, the crust ended up being way too sugary for my taste. I've had and made graham cracker crusts before so I admit I have expectations. XD Second, the filling texture didn't end up "whipped" so much as it ended up "goop." I did use homemade pumpkin purée, so maybe that affected it. Again, the taste was ok, but I wouldn't give this one another go.

Not sure I will make this again. Everything turned out okay but it was just a bit too different for the family. I think the potential problem with the pie was the sharp, bitter taste for such a fluffy texture.

Super Easy... Not a ton of flavor.

I added more Pumpkin spice and nutmeg.

Kiddos liked it :)

I just used pumpkin pie spice but had to add a lot more cinnamon to get a festive flavor (used 1 tsp Penzey's pumpkin pie spice plus another 1/2 tsp cinnamon in all). The hubby & baby loved it, they love pumpkin everything, me not so much, but I don't like pumpkin anything really. We meet in the middle with this pie. Thanks for sharing!
