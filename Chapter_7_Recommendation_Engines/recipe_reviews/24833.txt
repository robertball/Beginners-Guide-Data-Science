This is a great, healthy and delicious salad.  But use care to RINSE your black beans well, or else you may end up with GRAY couscous, which is not all that appetizing-looking...  Thanks for a really nice recipe.

Yum, yum. I have made this several times so far and everyone always compliments it. It is easy, healthy and keeps well in the fridge. Best of all: you can make soooo many substitutions. Basically put in any legume you like. I like using one can of Lima beans and another can of black beans the most. And for the coriander/cilantro I have so far substitued dried dill (I daresay better than the original...but i love dill in all things) and fresh parsely (but then it becomes very much like tabouleh).However, the dressing is NOT enough and I always at least double everything in the dressing mixture except for the olive oil.

This is great! I've been looking for the perfect couscous recipe and now I've found it. The dressing alone is a keeper--I plan on using it for everyday salad as well. I didn't add black beans, but instead went with some diced English cucumber, kalamata olives, bits of crumbled feta, marinated red peppers and Italian flat-leaf parsley. I thought three green onions were more than enough. Next time I think I'll add some grilled chicken strips and call it a meal. This is a great recipe!

This is such an amazing recipe.  I did double the dressing and I doubled the cumin in the dressing along with adding a dash of balsamic vinegar to cut a small oil taste.  I stirred all of the dry ingredients together, made the dressing in a separate bowl and added it at the end to make sure it was okay to use all of it.  It was!  This is a great recipe, so colorful and wonderfully tasty.  My husband has to increase his fiber so I have been looking at different things to add to our diet that are healthy and high in fiber.  He liked this so much he took it to work for breakfast instead of his standard bagel.  I will keep this in the fridge on a regular basis.  I can hardly wait to grill chicken breast marinated in Italian dressing to have on the side.  A complete meal and easy, easy.  Thanks so much for my new favorite recipe!

Great recipe!  I made this for a Labor Day cookout and everybody loved it.  I took other's suggestions and used 1-1/2 cans of beans, 4 T. of oil and doubled the lime, vinegar and cumin for the dressing.  I think this recipe would be fine using either 1 or 2 cans of beans.

This was a good healthy salad, but the recipe as written needs more flavor.  I doubled the cumin, lime juice, and added some balsamic vinegar.  It was better, but still could've used a little more oomph.  I also threw in some goat cheese.

Very TASTY and very QUICK recipe! Start to finish in about 20 minutes. 

I used 1 cup chicken stock and 1/4 cup water because I have the 1-cup stock boxes and I hate having an opened box left over. I agree with other reviewers that one 15oz. can of black beans is enough as is just 4 green onions. I used bottled roasted red peppers (to lazy to run out to store for fresh) and it turned out great. Looks good too!

I made this with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and it was delicious.  Might I suggest trying that substitution if you are bringing it to a potluck or other gathering; vegetarians often assume that a bean/veggie dish will be one of the few things there they can eat, and are discouraged to learn that even beans & couscous has meat (stock) in it.  Otherwise, great recipe though.

YUM- this was very good. I added a little extra lime as other reviewers suggested. One note about cooking couscous... this was my first time cooking plain couscous (I've only cooked the flavored kind out of a box). With following the instructions exactly, my first batch of couscous came out too mushy. You can't have mushy couscous with this recipe... it has to have good separation. My second batch was perfect. I took 3 minutes off the cooking time and immediately removed it from the heat and the pan and stirred it up in a large bowl until it cooled a bit. If you leave it in the hot pan, even after taking it off the heat, it will continue to cook and get mushy underneath. Also, another reviewer's batch came out muddy. To prevent this, I rinsed the beans and corn thoroughly and placed them in a strainer in a sink for a couple of hours to dry out.

This was the first time I've ever eaten or cooked couscous.  It was Delicious with a capital "D."  To the recipe, I added chopped Roma tomatoes and feta cheese.  Doubled up on that delightful dressing as others had advised.  This recipe is a Golden Spoon award winning one which will now be a regular in my meal planning.

After reading others' reviews, the first time I made this I automatically doubled the dressing ingredients (oil/lime juice/vinegar/cumin), but stayed true to the balance of the recipe.  IT WAS DROP DEAD DELICIOUS.  The next time I did the same, but also added two cans of sliced black olives and increased the amount of green onions.  I think this is one of those "forgiving" recipes that can be easily altered to suit personal preferences.  VERY GOOD -- thanks for sharing the recipe.

Definitely use more than one cup couscous.  One is not nearly enough; it turns out like bean and corn salad with a bit of couscous.  I used quinoa instead and it was super.  My husband and I felt the lime taste was a little much, but overall, it was a good, healthy dinner.

Excellent salad.  I am always looking for new dishes to serve.  I pre-made this salad to take on a camping trip this past summer.  It was a huge hit.  I did feel it was better when freshly made, but I think it was because it was still warm.  When serving the next day I suggest taking out of cooler plenty early to bring to room temperature.   I did only use one can of beans since I felt two cans would have overpowered the the couscous.

Amazing recipe! This was the first time I made couscous and I definitely tweaked it to my liking. Due to the expensive price of peppers, I used white button mushrooms. I also used just regular onions, garbanzo beans instead of black, and lemon juice instead of lime- It was all about what I had on hand + thriftiness (I'm a college student after all) I did not even have the red wine vinegar and it still all came together really well! I'm excited to eat these leftovers & will surely make again!

A great recipe to make for those trying their hand at couscous for the first time. Reviewers who made changes did so without veering too much away from the original recipe. I would call that a sure sign of something delicious. Quick, healthy and versatile,  this is now amongst my very favourites. My only regret is that it took me so long to find and try it. Thanks Paula!

Delicious!

I made this recipe to get rid of some of the left over couscous I had in my fridge. I made it almost the exact same as is written, but I added a few other things that I had lying around:

1/4 of a cucumber, diced really small
2 TBSP minced almonds
some whole pine nuts
1 orange, peeled and chopped into small cubes

The orange in particular added a very nice extra kick of citrus. 

One thing I will say is that couscous is VERY absorbant. Even when it's fully cooked, it will continue to absorb liquid. So if you're making this ahead of time, I'd recommend keeping the salad components separate from the dressing and mixing them when you serve it.

Yoou may also consider adding a little extra vinegar. I found the recipe as is to be a bit too light, so I added an extra 1 tsp of vinegar.

The great thing about this recipe is that it is SO versatile! I'd imagine that can use pretty much any citrus juice (lemon, lime, orange, etc) for a new taste, or even add some cayenne pepper, trade the couscous for rice or quinoa, etc.

Evidently there is no way you can mess this recipe up.  I used garbanzo beans instead of black, canned corn instead of frozen, and added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes, drained.  Substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine and added garlic powder and chili powder to the dressing.  The cilantro I had had gone west, so no cilantro.  It was still delicious.  Will be even better next time when I have black beans and cilantro.

This is so good! I made it with the Garlic Lime Chicken on this site...great meal.  The only change I made was using one can of black beans...Even though I like black beans I think using two cans would take away from the rest of the recipe.  This is quick and easy!! Great summer dish! Thanks for the recipe:-)

Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly (but I used corn off of the cobb).  Very fresh tastiing and the perfect ratio of cous-cous to veggies/beans.  Will definately make again.

This was rather bland at first so I made more vinaigrette.  It was very good with the extra dressing.  I also added chicken and it made a great luncheon salad.

Excellent salad.  I agree that you can leave out some of the onion.  I also doubled the "marinade" - love that extra flavor.  This is good left over after refrigerating, too.

I tried this recipe as my first time with couscous and it was fantastic. My husband and I have never had couscous and we weren't sure what to do with it. I had to interchange some of the ingredients due to not having a full pantry. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I also used 2 cans of black eyed peas as we didn't have black beans. We don't care for cilranto so I used regular fresh parsley. I also added ¼ c. fresh basil. I used a sweet onion instead of green onions and it tasted sooo good. Thank you for sharing.

I've found my new favorite summer salad. Yum!!! Tasted amazing warm but didn't disappoint after sitting in the fridge for 2 hours.  Did as others suggested and doubled the lime juice, vinegar (used white wine vinegar) and cumin.  Also added 1/2 tsp ground coriander, 1/4 tsp dried crushed oregano leaves, 1/2 seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper and 1/8 cup minced red onion (didn't have any green onion). Used one can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and the corn kernels from 3 corn cobs (a little over 1 cup).

A very healthy and delicious side dish!  I only used 1 can of black beans and an entire can of corn.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, but I did have apple cider vinegar, so I used that instead.  Turned out delicious!

Great idea!  I changed it up to suit what I had as I'm trying to use up everything in the fridge/pantry right now for a big cleaning.  For add-ins I used 2 whole tomato, 8 tri color mini bell peppers, & chopped almonds to add crunch.  I was going to use dark kidney beans but I was in a rush and forgot them!   For the dressing I used mostly lime but a little squeezed lemon too and I skipped the cumin because my kids don't like it.  I just sprinkled a few dashes of dried dill, parsley, garlic salt, and a grind of pepper.  Awesome recipe to inspire a personalized meal!

I made this recipe and used black beans with jalapenos, it's what I had on hand and it gave the recipe a little zing.  Made it again with just plain black beans and it wasn't as good.

This recipe is delicious, and can be served warm or cold.  Definitely better after it sits for a day.  I made it once with cous cous and served it warm with dinner - then had it the next day cold with lunch!  Made it again with a parmesan risotto instead of cous cous (someone had celiac and needed gluten free).  Made it the night before and served cold at a picnic - huge hit with everyone!

My family and I really enjoyed this salad.  I cant wait to bring this to a barbecue.  It's so colorful, light, and delicious.
I only used 1 can of black beans and doubled the dressing.  I also used the larger tri-color Israeli couscous.  I like the texture with the corn and beans.

I made this for my mom who was going to a potluck and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and she only came home with a bit for a snack!!
I have made it twice now and it is wonderful, I love it for a great lunch or a light dinner since I always have some leftovers.  Great with some grilled chicken for a great filling dinner!
I only made a couple of changes:  I didn't add the cilantro since I hate the stuff, so added fresh parsley instead, and I only used one can of beans since I thought that 2 would be way too much.  As well I used whole wheat couscous once and regular the other time and you can't tell the difference so I will stick with whole wheat couscous in the future.

I made this last night to compliment the Spicy Garlic Lime chicken from this site, as another reviewer suggested. 
All I can say is !! Every bite was mmm-mmm good. I left out the cilantro and added toasted pine nuts, sliced kalamata olives, and crumbled feta. I didn't like the olive oil-y flavor of the dressing so I kept adding a little more vinegar (balsamic and red wine) until it went away. Then I put in a teaspoon or so of dijon mustard to fill it out. Perfection! I will be making this again (and again). Yum!

I made this as a side for a Moroccan chicken that I made a few nights ago for dinner and it turned out great!  It was the perfect, filling, beautiful side dish to accompany the chicken.  I pretty followed the recipe exactly other than exchanging minced white onion for the green onion, using dried cilantro, and rinsed, canned corn.  It was really good and probably one of the best couscous recipes that I've made. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of my go-to recipes for a sure-fire hit.  I first made it for a Greek-themed meal with grilled lamb kabobs and tzatziki and Greek Salad....outstanding.  I have also served this with grilled salmon and grilled chicken....the list goes on.  I have found I like the addition of rice vinegar the best over the other kinds suggested.  I also add quite a bit of reduced-fat feta cheese....it finishes it, to me.  I have found that it tastes best when made early in the day and allowed to chill several hours before serving.

This a fantastic starting point recipe - I recently substituted Quinoa for couscous, and it was fantastic!! I always use the much healthier quinoa now.  Like others, I AT LEAST double the dressing - and liberally use more vinegar and lime to boot.  I like it with a little zip. I add whatever veggies I have on hand - all color peppers and cucumbers are GREAT in this dish. If no scallions on hand, diced red onion is a tasty alternative.  Great dish for any cookout or potluck!

Out of this world delicious. I doubled the amount of couscous (also used pearl couscous, as that's what I had), dressing, and corn.... will be a delicious addition to my 4th of July meal! So much healthier than potato salad!  Thank you, Paula!

Add 1 cup of raisins, quadruple the salad dressing, use fresh lemon juice instead of lime juice, add 4-5 paprika seasoned grilled chicken breasts. Five stars with these additions. Makes a lot of salad. Yum!

Great blend of ingredients but you have to triple or quadruple the olive oil/lime/vinegar portion of the dressing.  The beans ( I cook my own ) and the couscous soak up the dressing quickly.  Salad flavors are best several hours later or overnight.  I didn't have green onions & used red instead but I would not recommend that - next time I'll make sure I have green onions

I LOVED this recipe. I will say, that (based upon other reviews) I doubled the dressing and I still wanted a bit more. Mmmm, but it was wonderful. We ate it as a side dish for days and my kids (2, 13 and 14) all ate it. This is certainly one of my new favs and I can't wait to take it to a pot-luck or dinner at my parents. Thanks for sharing!!

This is a wonderful healthy salad.  I had herbed chicken couscous so used that instead of regular couscous and chicken broth.

I can't believe I never got around to rating this!  We LOVE this salad.  It's refreshing, easy, keeps well, and healthy.  What more can you want?  Be sure to drain and RINSE the black beans to keep the couscous from turning grayish.  Terrific stuff.

Good flavor! But I agree with other reviewers that the dressing proportion is way off. I doubled the ingredients and still found the couscous and beans/veggies to be a little dry. May try triple the ingredients next time. But the taste is definitely there, so I will make it again.

I've never had cous-cous, but I love black beans & this sounded like a light, terrific salad.  I forgot the red bell pepper so I threw in some fresh chopped tomato and cucumber.  There's so many things you could do with this recipe!  Very nice and very light.  I served this with Chicken with Lime Sauce (from this site) tonight to my husband who is a very picky eater and he liked all of it!

This is a five-star quick main/side dish with the following (common amongst reviewers) changes...
1 additional tbsp. lime juice
1 additional tsp. red wine vinegar
1 can black beans (instead of 2)

we added 2 chopped chicken breats at the end.

great recipe...thanks!

Loved it!! This is the perfect salad to have on hand when you want something fast, and healthy. I took the advise of others, and doubled the dressing (not oil) and I'm glad I did. Next time I make it I will use whole wheat couscous because it has twice as much fiber.

This was pretty good.  It seemed to make a lot.  I would definitely recommend using regular chicken broth not low sodium.  Also, rinse the black beans.

This recipe is delicious.  I always add the entire can of corn, and the entire "bushel" of cilantro - just so I don't waste.  I also play with the spices, adding garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, and lots of lime.

This is great alone as a salad or we really enjoy it wrapped in a spinach tortilla and add chicken, and avocado. Great for packed lunches.

Was quite good. The grocery didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dried, I am sure fresh would have made it better. I also only used 1 can of beans and omitted the chicken broth (just used water...I was bringing it to a vegan potluck). I will definitely make this again. Maybe add diced tomatoes next time.

This recipe is pretty good, but also somewhat bland.  I'd recommend cooking the corn and beans first, then adding it to the couscous.  You may also need to try and adjust amounts as needed, because the recipe, as is, is somewhat bland, but okay.  I think the addition of a can of tomatoes may help.  I'd recommend trying it.

Not bad but I agree with the other posts in that it needs more kick. More lime juice, vinegar and a little more cumin. If you make this recipe as posted, it will be on the bland side. I know it will be much better tasting by doubling the above mentioned ingredients.

My whole family loved this recipe, and asked for more! Super easy to make, flavorful, and colorful. The dressing was delicious and can be used in any salad...I doubled the dressing recipe as per the reviews. Also, I used 1 cup water to 1 cup couscous instead of the chicken broth for my vegetarian sister.

We are vegetarians, and this has become one of our favorite side dishes.  I always make it ahead of time so it can be chilled, and we eat it cold.  The leftovers are then great used in a soup, burritos, etc.  In fact, my family was disappointed when there wasn't a lot of leftovers, so I now make a double batch each time! I use dried spices in mine, and it turns out great for us!

I made this recipe with brown rice instead of couscous (because I didn't have any).  The flavor was fantastic but the texture probably would have been better with couscous.  I had a bunch of leftovers (because I'm the only one who eats stuff like this in the house), so I made it into soup by adding a few cans of chicken broth, some diced chicken, a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of chopped green chiles.  Wow - unbelievably great flavor!  This is now one of my favorite soup recipes.

Extremely tasty! Reminded me of Chipotle filling. Adding a little bit more cumin, lime juice, and vinegar definitely brings out the flavors. Also, minimal jalapeno is necessary, unless you want it to be extra spicy. Maybe a half of a pepper. Note to first-time Couscous makers: once all the chicken broth is absorbed by the grains, stir it all up and remove from heat. It can burn if you just let it sit on the stove for too long. Excellent recipe! Will definitely make again.

This couscous salad is absolutely delicious.  I am a vegetarian so I substituted the chicken broth for vegetable stock and also used whole wheat couscous instead.  I also cut out the olive oil all together and just increased the red wine vinegar and lemon juice instead.  Love the cumin flavor - fantastic!

This was just the right recipe to use up some of my fresh summer vegetables! I added a little bit of green garlic (not as strong as regular garlic) to spice it up a little and substitutied balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. In addition I added chicken to make it a more filling like a main dish. I will definitely be making this again! Yum!

Great recipe even with quite a few modifications. Quick and easy if you have some ready made stock - I didn't, so ended up making vegetable stock from scratch.  Took a while but was worth it.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so instead of tossing the vegetables with dressing, I sauteed zucchini, red and green bell peppers and mushrooms in olive oil with an Italian herb mix.  Added corn, cilantro and one can of brown beans and mixed it in to the couscous. We used the couscous salad as a filling for pita pockets with some green salad and hummus.

I have made this many times and love it! Used dry beans rather than canned to reduce salt, but otherwise the recipe was unchanged.

This was great. I added chicken, garlic, spinach, tomato, and I doubled the amount of dressing.

Really good and really easy.  I over did it on the lime juice because I had extra juice left over and threw it in.  Probably shouldn't have done that.  The flavor of the lime really comes through but it was wonderful anyway.

One of my all time favorites! Everyone I make this for takes the recipe home. Corn is awesome in it! I added chopped tomato last time but actually think it is better without. I will stick with the corn and black beans.

This was surprisingly delicious. I made a few small changes out of necessity: I only had one can of black beans; I didn't have any onions so I substituted minced garlic; didn't have cumin so I substituted mild yellow curry powder. I used Israeli pearl couscous which needs to simmer for about 10 minutes (vs the 5 minutes in the recipe instructions.) The flavors balanced really well. The dressing alone is very tangy, but mixes perfectly with the sweet red pepper and corn. Others have mentioned doubling the dressing, but I followed the recipe and I thought it was more than enough - just perfect. The salad does taste better after it chills overnight. This would be a standout crowd pleaser for a summer picnic or potluck. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out to be a very fresh, delicious side dish, but I had some struggles with it.

I discovered that not all the couscous was cooked thoroughly after the 5 minutes called for. I also found it to have excessive liquid so when i added it to the veggie mix. it was somewhat "soupy". Finally, I only added 1 can black beans to the mix, as 2 was obviously too much.

I will make this dish again! But I will be sure to cook couscous more, drain the couscous, keep the beans low and add other items read for in other reviews.

Doubled the dressing, and added a finely chopped fresh jalapeno. SO delicious! Taking it to a potluck tomorrow, and making it again soon for us to have at home. My teenage daughter loves it too. Ya for nutritious, tasty food!

OMG!  This is so delicious!  The combo of the cumin, green onion, olive oil and fluffy couscous, and the sweet crunch of the corn, makes this a delightful side dish or healthy lunch!  I can't wait to make this in the summer and pair it with fish or chicken.  I substituted chick peas for the black beans and it was super yummy!  Enjoy!

This has been a favorite of mine for a couple of years. Definitely, double the dressing, and I always add at least one (diced) fresh jalapeno for a little more zip, plus generous amounts of cilantro.  Good, too, with a bit of Sriracha!

I really enjoyed this salad- though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I subbed quinoa for couscous and added cucumber and green pepper in place of the corn. Will definitely make again!

I agree that this is a wonderful salad.  It's a staple in our summer cookouts.  As a change I add - not sub- soaked wheat berry.  Wow - a great crunch.  Thanks Paula..

This is a great recipe! The lime/cumin dressing adds just the right tang. I use a whole wheat cous cous that I've found at Trader Joe's. I've taken this to gatherings and it always gets raves.

I brought this to work for an office pot luck.  I doubled the recipe, added cucumber, and I doubled up on the dressing as one suggested. 
The combination of red wine vingegar, lime juice, cumin and cilatro made a nice southwestern tatse.
  We have many people watching their weight, so this dish was a hit!  Thanks!

This was so easy to make! My one year old and 3 year old even liked it. My red peppers was roasted and frozen. Also my green onions and cilantro were both frozen and it still tasted great. I didn't have lime juice so I used a little lemon juice, I couldn't tell. I can't wait to use all fresh ingredients to make it, but it's nice to know it still taste great with frozen.

This was a little bland.  Something that my husband did was add some extra garlic salt and a sprinkle of Parmesan Cheese which ended up adding some more flavor to it.

I also am pretty liberal with the "dressing" portion of the dish too. This helps to add flavor if you can taste the lime (or lemon in my case) and vinegar.

SO FREAKIN' GOOD!!! I just finished making it, and I type as I eat a bowl of it! I couldn't resist! I actually made mine with Israeli (pearl) couscous which by the way is AWESOME and so pretty and I think works even better in this recipe!!! I just made two cups instead of 1 but with the same water ratio and let it stand for 10 minutes. Things I changed: only 1 can of beans (RINSE!) was plenty for me, apple cider vinegar instead of red wine v. because that's what I had, 4 green onions instead of 8 (they were big!) and NO CUMIN (we hate it at home :) ). The dressing amounts were perfect for the two cups (uncooked) of Israeli couscous...maybe more lime juice and vinegar. I also added the zest of the 1 lime I used, and I am sure my husband would say that a little bit of chopped jalapeno would work great!  Also for those who were saying to add some protein to make it a whole meal, you certainly can do that, but just so you know, when you mix beans (legumes) and grains, that IS a whole protein equivalent to meat or fish or eggs...so as far as nutrition goes, you don't really need the meat, just if you want it. This is so good that I rather double the recipe and eat this until I am full!

Great salad, however, one should double the dressing ingredients, and in doing so, it would become a 5 star recipe. Will definitely make again with this only change.

Mmmm this was an awesome side at my bbq yesterday!  My only stray from the recipe was canned corn instead of frozen kernels...I cooked the corn and beans for 5 minutes on the stove top just to warm them up.  My piggie guests commented warily before trying it that it "looked healthy"...it was, but it was also delicious and it was devoured =)  Thanks!

What a delicious recipe!! Keeps well in the refrigerator, and gets better as it sits. I'm not crazy about green onions, so I used much less than it calls for, and only 1 can of beans and it still turned out great. Really a flavorful, healthy dish that I'll make again soon!

This salad goes well with everything and makes a great lunch on its own. I thought the dressing was delicious, I added red peppers to my salad, it's been added to my regular salad rotation at our house, it travels well and I love to bring it on picnics and potlucks, thanks for the recipe Paula.

OMG! This was FABULOUS! Followed the recipe to a "T".....absolutely the best thing since sliced bread! :) I did use Whole Wheat Couscous in place of white (better for you). Will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

Great salad.  I doubled everything in the dressing EXCEPT the olive oil.  I added chopped jalapeno peppers to give that extra something.  I also added a bit more red wine vinegar.  This is a great salad.  We've added grilled chicken to it - which is awesome as well.    Just make sure you rinse your beans really good before adding it to the bowl.  If you don't - everything will turn a gray color.    Enjoy!

Ok, so even though I made some changes, I'm giving this 5 stars because it's awesome!  I nearly tripled the sauce, used 4 green onions, one can of black beans, one can of corn, and just water instead of broth (to make it vegetarian friendly) - could of used veggie broth but forgot to buy it.  This was so easy to make, less than 10 minutes, is healthy and filling and goes great with just about anything.  Plus it's just down right pretty! Took this to a party this weekend and it got rave reviews and recipe requests.  This is my first foray into couscous and I don't regret it!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I have been making this recipe for awhile. I first found this on the Weight Watchers message boards as a Core recipe. I would make the whole recipe and split it up into 5 plastic containers and eat this for lunch, sometimes I would add grilled chicken or shrimp to it. The only thing I did differently was added 1 pressed garlic clove to the dressing. I also would recommend using fresh cilantro instead of dry. A definate keeper!!

This recipe is incredible!!!  I can't believe how good it is!  Summer is here so I used corn on the cob from a farm stand that picked it an hour before I bought it.  I grow an herb garden that has cilantro and garlic chives in it, so I used both those fresh herbs and I used a whole lime in the recipe instead of the amount mentioned.  Delicious flavors blended at the end.. Wish I could give it 10 stars, I can't stop eating it, great amount of protein and fiber, excellent dish!!

This was really good, but you really need to double the lime juice for a little more punch. I kept sampling and adding more juice until it was right. 

Very nice recipe. Pretty salad to look at, and great flavor.

This salad if fantastic and I am looking forward to making this over the coming summer, I am sure it is one that friends will also enjoy.  I replaced the black beans with red kidney beans as black beans are not available in Australia (as far as I can tell).  I also added chopped black olives, which really suited this salad.

I loved the blend of flavors but nobody else in my family was crazy about it, they are pretty bland eaters!  I too doubled the lime mixture and will triple it next time.  I only used 1 can of black beans and thought it was enough.  Very simple, light and tasty.

I doubled the dressing, but would triple it next time. Unless you are very fond of the taste of cumin I would only use 1/4 teaspoon.   My couscous loving husband was very happy with this on father's day.

What a wonderful salad.  I made it for company last night, and everyone raved.  I only used 3 green onions, which I thought was plenty, and I did use both cans of black beans.  I thought some diced cucumber would go nicely in it next time.  It was refreshingly light, and would make a great addition to any meal on a warm summer night.

I love this recipe!  I used whole wheat couscous and only one can of the beans.  I love the flavor, and fresh ingredients are a must. I think it needs all the onions it calls for and maybe even more cumin.  This one is a keeper!!!

This is my favorite couscous recipe of all. I have made this many times now and have tweaked the recipe to personal perfection. I use 1 1/2 cups Israeli couscous and only one can of black beans. I also use a full tsp. of cumin and use 1 tsp. red wine vinegar and 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar. Other than that the rest of the ingredients are perfect as written for my taste. I like to make it in advance and let it chill in the fridge before serving.

Yes, really good. I didn't use oil because, what's the point?  It's already delicious. I just used green onions, added a diced seeded tomato, an avocado and a dash of cayenne  pepper. I made quinoa instead of couscous because it's much healthier.   I also used yellow peppers just for color contrast. Use fresh cilantro. It makes this recipe so, don't substitute!

This is the best couscous salad I've ever had- and so easy to prepare. I leave out the cilantro, and it's great without it. So many friends have asked for it, that I've posted it on the bulletin board at work.

This was a very last minute meal so I didn't have a lot of the ingredients, but my husband and I still loved it! I think the trick was that I substituted italian dressing for the olive oil and lime juice. I used red cooking wine instead of vinegar, and as someone else suggested, cumin and parsley for cilantro (although if I plan better next time, cilantro is yummy). One can of beans was more than enough. I also didn't have any green onions or corn and it still turned out fabulous. For someone who previously was not a fan of couscous, I will be making this again (and again).

Yum!  Added parm cheese, but only used 3/4 can of beans.  2 cans would have been way too much.  Only used 1/2 bag of corn.

This is a great recipe.  It's easy and quick.  I used fresh corn, cannelini beans in addition to black beans, and mint and parsley instead of cilantro.  I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the dressing recipe.  I ended up using 1.5 the of the doubled dressing.  The salad is great the next day too.

This was fabulous!!  I used fewer green onions (as in 2 Tbl.) - just a personal preference, 1/8 tsp. salt + 1/8 tsp. pepper.  To save time, I used a can of corn (drained).  The dressing measurements were perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

A big 5 star review for this recipe!! I made it last weekend, doubled the dressing, and kept everything else as per the recipe. Delish!!! Husband raved about it, so much that I will be making it again this weekend! Will include some fresh jalapeno this time!!

I made this recipe vegan and healthier. I used whole wheat couscous, used low sodium vegetable broth and made my own beans instead of using canned.  I loved how it turned out. Also found red onion to be more flavorful for this dish.  I doubled the amount of cumin and used apple cider vinegar instead.

Double the lime juice, cumin, and vinegar, and it's great! Without doing that, too bland for my taste.

This is definitely a five star recipe!  We love it and it is now a recipe that we make weekly.  I add a little more lime juice and cilantro when I want a little more flavor.

Really nice salad... nice and easy to whip up in a pinch. 
I found that there was not enough dressing so i doubled it.  I added fresh parsley & cherry tomatos.
Thanks for the great recipe

This is a great salad.  Only change I made was to increase couscous to 1 1/2 cups, plus increase all else except beans in proportion per others' comments, as I needed a big batch.  Will definitely make again.

This was a good salad. I made it with quinoa. I liked the colorfulness and it had great flavor. I'm going to take leftovers for lunch next week. I'll make this again.

This recipe is just so delicious - and EASY!  I took the advice of a different "reviewer" and rinsed the black beans - good idea.  I added extra cilantro because I really love the flavor and a little extra lime juice.  Quick, easy & delicious!

Followed the directions with the exception of omitting the cilantro, because we don't like the flavor.  I also roasted the red pepper.  This is a very versatile dish. Everyone really enjoyed it. I wish the lime taste was stronger, so next time I'll add some lime zest.

Was just wondering what to do with the leftover couscous and came across this recipe. Happily I had all the ingredients but only 1 can of black beans. This turned out to be a non issue. In fact I think 2 would have been more than I would have cared for. The recipe is great and is a light, fresh tasting salad that will go well with our leftover grilled steak. Attractive and appetizing appearance.

This salad is so bright and fresh tasting!  I made the recipe exactly as stated, but, doubled the marinade, only used one can of black beans, and added a couple of shakes of cayenne to the dressing.  So flavorful!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a little bland, I make a couscous salad using cucumber, tomato, onion, italian parsley, liberal amount of garlic, fresh squeezed lime, green olives and salt/pepper... for this recipe, I needed to add garlic and a lot of salt and pepper.... I also found that the left overs didn't taste good.

Absolutely love the vinegar and cilantro together...as my first time cooking couscous...I'm glad I chose this recipe. I took it to a family get together and it was a hit...making it again for dinner this week. It is a fresh and light salad with amazing flavor.

Love Love this low fat dish!! I replace the bell pepper with cucumber and use Rice Wine Vinegar rather than red wine. Very tasty and I always get compliments when taken to an event.

Loved it!  Agreed with everyone about doubling the spices not olive oil but think I'll think two cans of black beans are better than one.  Pretty presentation and healthy.  My holiday crowd loved it.

Liked this a lot.  I thought the only improvement would be to add more citrus or vinegar.  It needed a bit more dressing.  I made this with whole wheat couscous and left out the cilantro.  I will make this again!

Really good, but even better with a large chopped tomato and a diced avocado.  Even add some chicken if you really want to pump up the protein.  I also think it is better after sitting a while.  I love this salad for taking along camping, just throw it on a plate and you have a nutritious meal.

My version of this, that I've made for years, calls for lemon and it's zest as well as a minced jalapeno for added zip.  I freeze in small containers to take to work for lunch and it's typically thawed by then.  Makes a great healthy lunch!

This was really delicious..A few additions and minor tweaking..I added 1 C. of chopped peppadew peppers from my grocer's olive bar..and I used roasted red bell pepper chopped instead..I doubled the cilantro because we LOVE cilantro...I also used taco seasoning in place of the cumin, and doubled the olive oil but tripled the rest of the dressing ingredients..really made the flavors pop...it was a huge hit!

It may have been better but I did not have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. I really did not like the dressing by itself, it was missing something. Once mixed in with the salad it was better (the sweetness of the corn helped) I used leftover grilled corn-on-the-cob that I had taken off the cob. I also was out of black beans so I used red beans. I did add some Mrs. Dash Mediterranean seasoning and that seemed to help as well. I think it needs a little more tweaking and then it defiantly would be 5 stars.

Yummy!  What a good summer meal.  I halved the recipe because it was just me eating it and it still made quite a bit.  Here are the things I did differently . . .  1.  Whole grain wheat couscous (made by Near East).  2.  Chopped the 4 green onions until almost half way through the white part.  I wanted some of the onion flavor but not the full amount.  3.  Used 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of dried cilantro.  4.  I really like corn so I used 1 cup.  5. RINSE and drain the black beans.  6. As for the dressing - I made half of the recipe so I made half of the dressing but I think next time I would make a bit more.  I ended up using 1 tbsp + 1 tsp lime juice, 1/2 tsp cumin, and I wish I would have used a bit more oil and red wine vinegar.  7.  Added reduced fat feta cheese, roughly chopped.  8.  Next time I'll add some chicken or something to make it a fuller meal!  9.  Chilled for about 1/2 an hour to let the flavors blend.

I just made this and used diced up an English cucumber, yellow pepper, and a can of petite diced tomatoes along with the frozen corn and black beans. I didn't have any fresh herbs unfortunately and used lemon instead of lime juice and added a some cayenne pepper for a kick and it's great right now, I bet after chilling overnight it will be even better!! Yum!

Not quite enough flavor, but it was a tasty, light dinner that was easy to prepare, so I will make it again. Next time I'll double the amounts of cumin and corn, and I may also add some red pepper flakes.

It's just as tasty as it is pretty!  Eight green onions would have been far too much for me, so I only used half that, and it seemed just right.  I look forward to making this again and again!

Rock on!  This is awesome stuff.  I made it with the chili lime chicken kabob recipe and it was spectacular - although, it would really be great on its own.  I cook low sodium so I omitted the salt and used low sodium chicken broth.  My husabnd did end up needing to salt it a bit, but loved it anyway.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is just…wow. I made it three times in one week. It's not quite as quick as some have said, unless you're a really fast mixer and chopper, but it's still fast and easy to make. I'm sure the recipe is good as is, but I do do some things differently: Following the advice of others, I double the dressing except for the olive oil. Whole wheat couscous. Usually use green pepper as that's what I have around, used celery instead once. I enjoy cilantro but I have an allergic reaction to it, so I use it sparingly or use parsley instead. Two cups of corn instead of one, as that's the amount I have frozen my corn in. One can of black beans. Basically, it's very adaptable. Note: This is a very soft/comforting dish, and I imagine it would be even more so if you left out the crunchy peppers. As a vegetarian, I consider this a main dish thanks to the beans, and I can honestly say it's my absolute favorite Allrecipes main course find so far.

This was a wonderful salad.  I made it for a potluck the first time and it was quite popular even though most of the guests had never had couscous.  It is very colorful and tastes quite fresh.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time with the exception of halving the amount of oil in the viniagrette.  While it was good, my second version was slightly different and I think even better.  I agree with others to wash the black beans thoroughly before adding so they don't turn the couscous gray.  I added one finely diced jalapeno to the chopped veggies and two dashes of cayenne pepper to the viniagrette mixture.  It added just the right amount of heat.  This is a lovely vegan dish if made with vegetable stock or, if you must have meat (like my husband), add in two shredded chicken breasts for a well-rounded meal.  I used red and orange bell peppers to give lots of color and I would recommend doubling the recipe because there is never enough!

Very good! Simple, tastey and easy. I actually used brown rice since i didn't have any couscous. The flavor is very delicate and is good hot or cold.

Two people made enough of this salad to serve 120 and it was interesting how different they came out.  One thing for sure - you should not only drain the beans of liquid but also rinse with water as half of ours looked very muddy. The same half was a bit gummy - I suspect it wasn't dry and "fluffed" before adding all the veggies and dressing. Also, doing about 1 1/2 times the dressing as suggested elsewhere here is a good idea - otherwise it's quite bland. A great choice for a big picnic.

This was a crowd pleaser at a barbecue last night. I ended up doubling the dressing and adding it after the fact, although the leftovers today needed extra spice.  I think that doubling the dressing was a little too much, although it was still great. This morning I added extra cumin, salt, fresh ground pepper, and some cayenne. It was even better today!

This was great.  I made a few changes as some have suggested previously.  I used one can of corn instead of frozen, only one can of black beans, half of the cilantro, balsalmic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I made most of the changes because that was all I had on hand.  Still excellent!

LOVED IT!  Even the macho men at the picnic raved over it.  The blend of flavors is wonderful, especially the cilantro.  It looks as good as it tastes.  Great for make-ahead and very EASY.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe, although I served it to a "meat and potaotes" crowd and it was a huge flop, so watch out for that.  This recipe is SO versatile!  Great on it's own or I would serve with Hummus, or Spiciy Garlic Lime Chicken (found on this site)

My love for spicy food killed my palate so now I always double the dressing and spices. I also added a bit of garlic and a pinch of paprika. But it’s my own taste, on the whole it's a very easy, tasty and colourful salad!

We love this salad!  Great with steak, or toss in some cooked and cubed chicken breast.  Very flavorful and hearty.  Even better the second day as the flavors meld together.  Great to take for lunch or make wrap sandwiches out of!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe after the rave reviews.  The dressing was way too tangy...I really had to add a lot more spices to make the dressing good.  I would suggest the Mexican Bean Salad dressing recipe on this site as an alternative + a dash of dijon mustard.  I would prepare the couscous as suggested in this recipe.

This is a very tasty colorful recipe for couscous.  Along with other reviewers, I used one can of black beans and increased dressing except for olive oil.  I only had green pepper so I used that and added a half of a seeded tomato for color.  Kalamata olives put this over the top.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Can you say "YUMM-Y?"  This was delicious!  It was light and refreshing and so quick to make.  It probably took about 15 minutes to make.  I just chopped everything while the broth was heating up and the couscous was sitting.  It was great to make between coming home from school and then off to soccer practice.  I did double the dressing and cut back on the olive oil a bit and it was perfect.  Keep the great recipes coming!

This was excellent!  My 11 y/o daughter even liked it!  I thought the amount of dressing was perfect; as I don't like salads, etc. dripping with dressing.  The combination of flavors was ideal.

I made this for a potluck, doubled the recipe, added cucumber, used half the amount of green onions only 1 can of black beans and didn't have any corn.  And it still turned out wonderful!  It had a different taste to it, but everyone really liked it.  I enjoyed the leftovers too!

Delicious! And SOOO fast. I once accepted a last-minute party invitation, and whipped this up in about 5 minutes. 

Of course, I make a big batch for me and eat it for the next couple days -- yummy!

Very good!However,to get it seasoned the way I like it I had to triple the "dressing",half the amount of green onions and add about three cloves of minced garlic.It was a great start~good texture and color,interesting flavors.I made it for 2 Easter gatherings and everyone loved it!

I thought this recipe tasted a bit too strong of onion. If I were to make it again, I would probably cut back on that ingredient.

I never would have tried this but thanks to the favorable reviews, I did. I only used 4 green onions and omitted the red pepper because I don't care for the taste of it and I absolutely loved this! I think it would beautifully accompany many a meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very flavorful! An easy recipe to make in advance, stores well for several days. I used balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar and just one can of beans and it turned out well. Have made several times now with rave reviews!

MISSING ONLY ONE THING!! We really enjoyed this recipe-my teenagers came to love it. I  made a 9X13 full of it which is what double the recipe makes (I brought it to a party). I did make double the sauce, but added it at the end to taste. So I didn't use it all. 
The one thing I added which really made this dish spectacular was crumbled Feta cheese! I mixed just a bit in, then put it all over the top. AMAZING!My teens have requested I make this next time we have soft tacos, to go with the other fillings.

Very good but I like lots of flavor. Will tweak buy doubling cumin and lime next time. Nice change to green salads which we get tired of by mis August.

Surprisingly delish!  Everyone in my family enjoyed it, including the children.  
The black beans should be drain and rinse, so the couscous doesn't look dark in color.

This salad is delicious and healthy. Win win! All three of my kids like this salad and it's on a regular rotation at our house. I have sometimes subbed quinoa for the cous cous to make it even more healthy and it still tastes good.

Even better when couscous is replaced with quinoa.  But this version is very good.  Also, added several additional veggies once base recipe was done -- chopped squash, jicama, grated carrots, etc.  The next day added some fresh cilantro.  Delish!

This has been my "go-to" salad this summer! Always a hit at potlucks. It's so colourful and versatile. I make it with quinoa sometimes instead of couscous and put in whatever veggies I have - zucchini, peppers, grated carrots and topped with halved cherry tomatoes. Like other reviewers I feel you need to double the dressing.

Excellent!  Doubled dressing as per other reviews.  Fresh cilantro really makes this salad.  I (as well as the rest of my family) am looking forward to eating this again.

Bright flavor and beautiful presentation.  I doubled the dressing and used a box of Far East parmesan couscous.  I'm not sure if I overcooked the couscous or letting it sit over night caused the couscous to have a bit of a gummy texture.  Also I only had one can of black beans so I used a can of ark red kidney beans for my second can.  This was really good and a perfect summer salad to go with your grilling!

As for others, this was a good starting point for me.  Based on other reviews, I added a minced jalapeño and some cayenne to the dressing since I like a little kick!  I also halved the recipe (its just me) but adjusted the bean and corn amounts to use up the leftovers I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Delish! My 8 year old loves this. I doubled the dressing and it is a must. We added some chicken breast seasoned with New Orleans Seasoning. This was my first time cooking couscous and just when I thought the broth wasn't going to be absorbed, it did.

Delicious!  Like other reviewers, I doubled the lime juice and vinegar.  Instead of adding an extra half teaspoon of cumin to the dressing, I added it to the chicken broth before boiling.  It gave the couscous great flavor.

Ridiculously good, and so simple! I used veggie broth and only used 1 can of black beans, but otherwise followed the directions precisely. It's totally vegan with the veggie broth, and everyone loved it! I sense this will become a staple side dish for me.

I doubled the recipe for a block party.  And I used Israeli couscous.  I substituted bottled lime juice for fresh lime juice.  I didn't need as much green onion as the ones I had purchased were very big.

It was a hit!  So glad I found this recipe!

Delicious! This is a healthy and light side that pairs well with a variety of food. I made it for a potluck, with vegetable broth instead of chicken, following the advice to double the dressing except for the EVOO. I only used one can of black beans, but added a little bit more of the veggies. 
I'm enjoying it cold out of the fridge for lunch today. I sprinkled on a little chili powder for a little kick.

This tastes great!  I used vegetarian broth in place of chicken broth.  I also tripled the ingredients for the dressing with the exception of the olive oil.  I only used one can of seasoned black beans that I drained well.  I only used 4 green onions.  No more than the 1/4 cup of cilantro is needed.

Just had my first bowl!  Yum.  I stuck pretty much to the recipe...did ad a clove of minced fresh garlic..could still add another as I love garlic!  Since it's just me, I used one of those boxes of Near East Cous Cous with Pine nuts (dont' need the chix broth when use this as it has season packet when you make as directed)  I used 6 green onions, chopped red pepper, frozed (thawed) corn, crumbed feta, some sea salt and pepper to taste.  Oh..and I only had white navy beans.  Quite yummy and will be going back for my second helping! (black olives would be good in this as someone else mentined)

i added the cumin, garlic powder, salt pepper, vinegar , after refrigerating, once you ad the beans and corn makes it a little mushy, i also added spinach, chopped banana peppers and artichokes, it was great! (didnt have cilantro, lime juice and i dont not prefer onions).

Loved this recipe.  I added extra cumin and doubled the dressing using white balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  I also added hot pepper sauce to kick it up a notch.

This flavors in this were soooo good.  The only changes I made was to add minced garlic to the dressing.  I also made  slightly more of the dressing since some of the other reviewers said they needed more.  I can't wait to make it again!

Very easy and good.  Followed other reviewers' suggestions to use only one can of beans, and double-up on the dressing ingredients (except for the olive oil).  As with all dressings, mix the other dressing ingredients first, then drizzle in the olive oil slowly while whisking ... this keeps it from separating.  Better the next day after flavors have time to meld.

We substitute orange pepper for red to make a healthy Halloween-themed side dish. I have made this many, many times, and it is always a hit, especially at potlucks. I do double the dressing recipe as some others have suggested, but keep the cumin amount the same to keep it kid-friendly. Use vegetable broth in lieu of chicken broth for vegetarian friends and family.

Pretty good taste.  You need double the dressing and cut back on the couscous by about 1/4 cup.  Probably would make again with these changes.

I really liked this... very refreshing and filling. I did double the dressing as suggested in some of the comments and I'm glad I did.  I also only used 1 can of black beans and it seemed to be plenty.

This is probably the best AllRecipe I have discovered so far. My husband and I are addicted to this salad! We have already made it several times and just love, love, love it. The dressing is so, so good--we do double it as several other reviewers recommended. Other than that, don't change a thing.

I didn't have cumin and wasn't sure what to substitute for it so mine came out bland.  I'm sure if I added the cumin though it would've been a hit since all these ingredients pair well together.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent, flexible recipe!  I made this just using the ingredients I had on hand.  Subbed white wine vinegar for the red, used canned corn instead of frozen, and left out the cilantro since I didn't have any.  Only used 1 can of beans, and I added cubed chicken breast meat.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be making often!

I made this salad for a potluck lunch at work, and my co-workers were absolutely raving about it.  I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the dressing ingredients.  I also used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of chick peas, and added a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic.  The result was delicious!

I make this again and again. In fact I'll be making it for Thanksgiving dinner! Usually I add feta and lime-seasoned chicken chunks to make it a full meal. I do agree with those who found 2 cans of black beans to be more than enough, despite really loving black beans. My usual grocery store doesn't seem to carry red wine vinegar, but I find apple cider vinegar works just fine.

I like this salad.  It keeps well so I can take it to work for lunch throughout the week.  I prefer to use quinoa rather than couscous and its still fantastic.  I of course tweak with the amounts of the ingredients, but I havent screwed it up yet!

This was AWESOME!!!  It is even better cold!   I did everything as written except skipped the corn because I didn't have any for some reason.   Next time I may make a little bit more vinaigrette but other than that won't be changing a thing!

This was light and refreshing with a simple yet flavorful taste.  You could change this so many ways, but I made it as is and was great.  I did make a extra dressing like other reviewers suggested.  I'll make this again when I need to bring a dish somewhere.

I have a (new) vegan member of my family and I was searching for a recipe to add to a big family dinner.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and this recipe was a big hit with everyone.  I made it the morning of the party and the blended flavors tasted great.

Great recipe! Made the following changes: quinoa instead of couscous, doubled the dressing (I think that's essential) and used only one can of black beans. Very versatile recipe. Excellent for a crowd or to have in the fridge. The lime juice tastes great so don't skip it!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I think it's absolutely necessary to double the dressing.  Otherwise, amazing flavor, great recipe.  I did also add what feta I had left in my fridge, and it was really delicious!!

Pretty easy to make.  I used half the green onion - 8 just seemed like way too much.  The couscous seemed a little gunky to me, which I think was due to a lack of liquid, which I will increase a bit next time.  The end result didn't seem this way, so maybe adding the dressing helped this somewhat.  A bit reminiscent of tabouleh.  It was pretty good, but not "great."  I also tried this stuffed into flour tortillas, which I liked and also made it more like a filling lunch.

Our family loves this recipe. I make a little more sauce than it calls for and put fresh tomatos on top with a little grated parmesan cheese. It's wonderful! I make it over and over again.

UPDATE: I also use quiona (it's gluten free) in place of the Couscous and tastes very similar but quiona is healthier than the pasta so we find it a great substitute!

I loved this.  Even my 2 year old tolerated it.  My husband who does not like couscous did not like it so it apparently does not always covert.  He did say he loved all the flavors except the couscous texture (I used whole wheat couscous).  I ran out of green onions before I made this so I used red onions.  It was better the next day when the red onions had mellowed.

Yummy!  I only had one can of black beans and I thought it was the perfect ratio.  This is a total "girl" salad.  My husband thought it was "ok" and I think he called it "interesting" and my 4 yr. old said it was "weird" and only sort of ate it--even after I tried to say this is what Jasmine and Aladdin eat.  However, I LOVED IT so I'm rating it on what I thought.  Great for a lady's luncheon or make a bunch and eat it all week like I did. :-)

WOW!  This is a fabulous recipe.  Added only 1 can of beans and used fresh parsley as I didn't have cilantro. You won't be disappointed with this dish.  Great for dinner parties.

I wasn't expecting much from this salad so was completely surprised when I tasted it and absolutely loved it. I thought the recipe was perfect as is, I'm not a huge fan of tons of dressing so I found the amount was perfect. I'm a vegetarian, so I used veggie stock instead of chicken. I always wondered how to make couscous really tastey and now I know!  Will definitely be making this one again!

This was excellent!  I loved the combination of flavors.  I did double the 'dressing' ingredients, but not the olive oil.  Also, I left out the cilantro, because I don't care for it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was a wonderful springboard to a fantastic salad! I made some changes and additions and got rave reviews at a BBQ today! Here's what I changed/added: I used a whole 10 oz box of couscous and 2 cups of chicken broth. I doubled the dressing recipe (LOVE it!!!) I only used 1 can of black beans and a whole can of white corn. I also added 1/4 cup of golden raisins, 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of toasted slivered almonds. I think the dried fruit adds a welcome bit of sweetness. YUM yum! I just made it a second time tonight - to take to another potluck tomorrow! Thanks!

Top Notch!  8 servings if served as a main course, but much more if served as a side. Excellant as a take along. Flavours even better the next day.
2nd review, July 2017 -  I've been making this since 2008. A very versatile recipe.  I had less than 1/2 a can of black beans, I adjusted the ingredients a bit and voila! Still a perfect salad. As noted by other reviewers it is probably best to increase the dressing and if you can, make it well before serving to let the flavours come together. What the hey! Who doesn't want to "make ahead" instead of all at the last moment!

This was just okay for me.  As some reviewers noted before myself, it did taste a bit bland or "something?"  However, I ate this with pork chop and feta skillet ... (recipe here) and it seemed to compliment each other.  However, instead of assuming something is wrong with the recipe, I really think I do NOT like couscous too much.

I love this salad!  I cut down a little on the oil, and it works for the Weight Watchers Core plan.  I usually cook the couscous in water, rather than broth, to avoid the sodium.  Still tastes great!

This is a delicious salad which is easy to make. I used spinach couscous which was the most lovely light green color. I preferred eating the salad slightly warm (from the freshly cooked couscous) to cold. This would make a fantastic dish for a potluck: beautiful, nutritious, delicious.

This is light, fragrant and tangy! I added a splash more vinegar, but, other than that, didn't change a thing. It was great for a hot summer day! I will definitely make this again!

Extremely quick and easy recipe.  Made it for several family events & school events and each time it was well received.  People who love cilantro seem to really love this recipe.  Only change I make is to double the dressing.  Will continue to make this recipe in the future

I made a few changes (which I know isnt really fair), but i left out the oil which wasnt needed, added fresh lemon instead of lime, a little vinegar, left out the green peppers and cilantro and used fresh parsely, cut up celery and red onion.  Added some chipolte seasonings (in place of the cumin), a bit of garlic powder and onion powder.  Really Good !  I forgot to add the corn :(   All in all...a very good recipe.  Thanks

Love this salad, especially in the summer.  Very versatile regarding the vegetables and I think it gets better the second day.  One can of beans is plenty, I also often "season" the couscous cooking liquid for extra flavor.

This was delicious!  Some ate it plain, others with sour cream in a tortilla, others the next day as leftovers.  It was good every way we ate it.  I cooked my own black beans instead of using canned ones.  Next time I will add more lime juice and cumin as you could hardly tell there was any in the first place.  Even without those flavors being strong, it was still tasty.

Wonderful.  I used all the beans and made a little extra dressing and put more lime juice than called for.  So easy and so good!

This was very good.  Made it exactly according to the recipe, and it turned out great.  Served at a party yesterday (had made it the day before), and I even had a request for the recipe.  It did make a lot, though - next time I'll halve the recipe.

This was so good, everyone liked it, even one who originally turned up her nose at it! Couldn't ask for easier. It kept tasting better as the day progressed and the all flavors melded together. Thumbs up!

I didn't change much (1 can of beans + 1 can of corn vs. frozen) but took the suggestions from some reviewers and doubled the dressing - perfect! 
Thanks!

This was a great recipe and very easy.  I only used 1 15oz can of black beans and 1/4 tsp cumin.  I didn't have green onions, so I used yellow onions that were in my refridgerator.  Fresh lime juice makes this recipe an interesting change from using lemon juice.  I used balsamic vinegar because that is what I had in my cupboard.

Very good and even healthy!  I had never had anything with couscous before but this was excellent.  The only substitution I made was white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.

Delicious & different salad!  Makes a great vegetarian dish if you subsitute vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.  Thought the dressing was not going to be flavorful enough, but it turned out just fine.  Might try adding some garlic next time.

The best recipe for couscous I've ever seen! I've brought this to a few group functions and it's always been a hit (even though most of the group doesn't know what couscous even is!)

EDIT:  I replaced the couscous with quinoa, and made a little more dressing than what the recipe calls for (5 Tbsp olive oil, almost 3 Tbsp lime juice, etc).  Using the grain over the pasta makes such a huge difference, and it's a lot healthier!

This was great! I've made it twice now, and per other suggestions I made a few changes.  I doubled the dressing (except for the oil), added more lime, and added tomato. It was really good!

Made this yesterday with ingredients I had on hand.  Substitutions were kidney beans and lemon. I didn't have cilantro or corn.  The dressing was perfect.  Salt cuts the acidity. Delicious!  Thanks Paula.

The presentation was outstanding and impressive.I wish I could say the same thing about the flavor..It was excellent right after I made it then it lost it after it chilled. I might toss it with a little broth and serve warm just to get rid of the leftovers...will not make again.

I have become addicted to this recipe. I love black bean salads, but this one is by far the best I have ever eaten.  I also add chopped carrots and Jalapeño peppers although it is perfect exactly as it is written!

I have to say that this is one of my favorite dishes of all time.  The blend of spices and textures makes me crave this all the time!  I have made this for almost every potluck and get together and my friends all give the thumbs up!  The only drawback is that my husband and kids think that the texture is a bit strange.  But I blame that on their unsophisticated palate! :)  And then I get to eat all the leftovers myself...mmmmmmm...  I rarely ever modify the recipe, but on occasion I have substituted dry spices and halved the amount of beans without changing results dramatically.

I really loved this recipe.  I substituted brown rice for the couscous and cut out the chicken stock completely.  I also used fresh corn instead of frozen and dry black beans instead of canned.  Doubled the dressing recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of salt and the flavor was bright and tasty and the sodium wasn't too high for me.  I plan to make this again and again.

This is one my favorites!  I make it for potlucks, as a dip for tortilla chips or when I'm in the mood for it.  Everyone seems to love it.  I double the amount of olive oil, lime juice, vinegar, cumin and cilantro which seems to give it the right amount of flavor for our liking.  I usually don't have corn on hand, so I ommit it.   I also use what ever beans I have on hand.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This salad is just ok... I don't love it like the other reviewers-- but it is good.  I am giving it four stars instead of three becuase I was looking for something easy to make up ahead of time to take for lunch, and this can be eaten either cold or warm. Some reviewers talked about using fewer beans, but I think if I make it again, I would use more beans, and maybe more corn, so it would be more filling.  By the way, I halved the recipe since I knew my husband would not be helping me eat it.  It made approximately four one-cup servings.

A very attractive dish.  I gave it 5 stars, but the rest of my family gave it 3 - the 4 is a compromise!  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but did omit the red bell peppers and only used 1 can of black beans - which was plenty for me, and I love black beans.

This is a delicious, colorful, and healthy recipe that tastes better a day or 2 after making it. I double the dressing, since it adds such a nice flavor to the salad. The only thing I am thinking about trying as an addition is diced jicama, but it certainly needs nothing more to be a great salad.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  I tend to add a bit more dressing, plus a bit of cayenne.  This is such a great summery salad!

Made this for my mom's birthday.  Everyone loved it.  As I am not a huge fan of cilantro I would cut back on it.  Otherwise very good and very easy.

My friends still ask for this recipe from LAST summer's barbeque!  Now I'm making it again for the same crowd, by popular demand.  This is a delicious and healthy favorite.  So easy, too!

Sooooooooo good.  I thought that the flavour of this salad was great.  My brothers didn't really like it, but they don't like the flavour of cilantro.  I am still giving this recipe 5 stars because I thought that it was delicious.  I would say that this is my favourite recipe from this site.  I suggest using whole wheat couscous:  it's better for you, and you can't really taste a difference.

Loved this recipe since the first time I tried it.  I recommend doubling the dressing, if you like the lime flavor don't be stingy with the lime.  I never worry about thawing my corn.  I put it in the strainer with the canned beans when I'm rinsing the beans and then toss the whole lot into the warm couscous.  Thus I don't have to remember to take the corn out of the freezer to thaw it.

This was a great recipe.  I left most of the olive oil out and upped the lime juice.  Our first time eating couscous and we loved it.

We'll be making this again.

Outstanding! An instant favorite! A hit at every pot luck I've taken it to. I make it with all lime juice and use whole wheat couscous for extra fiber. Make it with vegetable broth so  vegetarians can enjoy it, too. Delicious!

My boyfriend and I both really liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using canned corn and one can black beans.  2 cans would have been way too many beans for me.  Good salad for a picnic or potluck and an easy side dish.

A great recipe, with amazing dressing. I did alter it slightly though - instead of spring onion, I used 1 medium red onion cut in circles (so it formed rings)and I made 3 times the amound of dressing stated in the recipe (left the olive oil the same though). I also used some cajun spice mix on one fillet of chicken, then fried them with just a few drops of olive oil. I then cut them into thin stripes and added to the salad. In the same heavy skilet I then fried the pepper cut into strips without any oil for a few minutes. Salad was amazing, but I believe that coriander is a must. An excellent light summer meal.

Excellent! Made it for a family party yesterday and it received rave reviews.  I did triple the dressing recipe w/the exception of the oil - I used about 5 tbls total.  I also used Balsamic Vinegar as I didn't have red wine vinegar.  Added a little chopped fresh garlic and some chili powder(just a couple of shakes).  Very light tasting.  Wish I had more leftover!

A very bright coloured salad, that's very good for you, and a good way for me to get "my beans".
But it's lacking a bit of something.  Not quite sure what.  It's very nice, just not quite what I anticipated.  Would probably make it again, specifically for our vegetarian relatives, they may enjoy it!
Very easy to prepare though!

I made the recipe as is. It was good at room temperature and even better the next day (and day after...). If you have the ingredients on hand you can put this together in the time it takes for the couscous to cook. Very quick.

Something different to do with left over beans, healthy alternative to frying them.  Tastes good, but you need to let it sit and marinate.  I tried it immediately and it tasted bland like olive oil. Even better the next day.

This recipe has become a household standard. I've found that I enjoy the salad better after it has had time to sit overnight; the flavors seem to need time to mix together. I also added chopped tomatoes, omitted the green onions, and replaced the black beans with kidneys. This salad is one of our favorites - we serve it with lebanese flat bread.

I've made this recipe at least 6 times since July. On two of those occasions I doubled the recipe. Everyone has loved it and I've been asked for the recipe. I've made it using the suggestions from other readers; making sure I rinsed the black beans, and doubling the olive oil, lime, vinegar and cumin.  I've only used fresh corn because it was in season. On one occasion I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth to make it a vegetarian dish. Always great!

I have made this twice now and you must double the dressing.  I added 2 tablespoons Honey to the dressing and it gave it a nice kick.

This was great.  I used champagne vinegar and went lighter on the cumin simply because of preference.  I also added shredded rotisserie chicken.

Loved it! From the texture to the flavour, so tasty! I used Israeli couscous instead of the fine couscous, as pictured in one of the photos. Will definitely make it again.

I liked the idea of this recipe because my husband loves couscous, and I love Mexican flavors. As written, this recipe has great, flavor. I wanted to make it more if a main dish than side dish. I used Israeli couscous and fresh corn. I sautéed the vegetables for 1-2 minutes so they could be served warm. Then, I marinated some shrimp in olive oil, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes, and grilled the shrimp to put on top of each serving of the couscous mixture. Garnished with a few slices of avocado, this was a great main dish!

AWESOME!!!!!  I added:  jalapeno and grilled chicken for variety.  This is a tasty and refreshing change from a standard/traditional  lettuce and tomato salad.  I love the freshness of this salad and I also shared this salad with  my co-workers and they love it!!!!!!!

This is a great dish!! As others have stated you can make so many substitutions if you have to or  want to. 
My first tip, ADD  CILANTRO!!
My Husband is on a gluten-free diet so I use Quinoa. Honestly, it adds a wonderful change switching to a whole grain. 
Quinoa does not absorb the flavors and moisture of the salad and get soggy. So it last in the refrigerator much longer!

I also double the cumin and sometimes add roasted Mexican Chili powder.  Awesome. All year long.  
A great "pick-me-up" in the middle of snow buried Maine.

This is fantastic!  I used quinoa since I had no couscous. I added quartered mushrooms and a can of diced chilies. Sprinkled spicy chili powder about a teaspoon and a little garlic powder. I cooked my quinoa in chicken stock. Pic posted!

Delicious!!!!  Followed recipe except doubled the dressing (except oil).   AMAZING!!!  Used Israeli couscous and I loved the textures.

So I made it again, and this time I also doubled the amount of couscous. EVEN BETTER!

This salad is so delicious and a great summer time cook out salad due to there not being any mayonnaise or eggs.  The ratio of cous cous to stock was perfect, as well as the ratio of salad ingredients to dressing.  I did sub out the lemon juice for lime and also added a bit of zest.  didn't bother with the vinegar and just added extra lemon juice.  replaced a can of black beans with chic peas. a few tomatoes and green olives.  This would serve as an excellent base for a more Mediterranean flair by subbing the cilantro with parsley, and the cumin with mint.  thanks so much for this recipe that is sure to be a repeat recipe.

i first made this years ago and have enjoyed it regularly since. I usually adapt it to what I have on hand and I often make it a pasta salad instead of couscous. I lime and cumin to taste. Amazing flavor, I highly recommend this recipe.

What a tasty recipe! I changed it up by using the larger pearl cous cous which gives it more of a moist pasta texture than the dryer standard cous cous. I've made this enough times that I know the recipe by heart. It is always a hit at parties and I'm usually asked to make it. Definitely try it; you won't be disappointed!

I've been making this for a few years and I always get rave reviews.  One modification though, I substitute orzo for couscous.  I just cook the orzo as the box calls for and add it in just like the recipe calls for.  It's a delicious and summery pasta salad, which is a perfect for our family that doesn't love mayo based pasta salads.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a go-to dish for any occasion!. For added flavor I grill 2-3 ears of corn and cut it off the cob. Much more flavorful than frozen. For added color I add cherry tomatoes and use an orange pepper instead of red. Otherwise I would not change a thing! Delicious!

This was wonderful! I didn't have any cilantro but it was still very flavorful. I halved some of the ingredients, like the black beans, corn, and couscous because I was making it for myself, but I still doubled the dressing. I added some cooked chicken, and a chopped tomato. This will be a great summer salad.

Fantastic!! As many others have said, I took some liberties with the seasonings. I think that's the beauty of this recipe - it's very versatile. I doubled up on cumin, used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (only because that's all I had - it worked very well!) and added some dijon mustard for a little extra 'tanginess'.

Totally fantastic and so easy which is good because this was my first time with couscous. I didn't have a bell pepper or green onion so I marinaded a cut up cucumber in balsamic vinegar and added that instead. So wonderful.

This recipe looks beautiful, the texture is perfect and the blend of spices is incredibly on point. Oh, I forgot to add that it's cheap, too! I make this recipe all the time and keep it in my fridge for days as I slowly eat lunches and snacks from it.

I made this last night. I doubled the dressings as many reviewers suggested. My husband said that it was absolutely fabulous.I took one reviewer's advice and rinsed the beans well. I didn't have green onion but chopped up about 1/4 small vidalia onion. I was also was out of frozen corn but substituted an 11 oz. can of vacuum packed niblet corn kernels. Also, the only cilantro that I had was freeze dried. It was still fabulous so I can only imagine how great it must be if you can follow the recipe exactly.

This is an absolutely perfect salad.  I followed the directions almost exactly, didn't have any cilantro and only had one 19 oz. can of black beans and it was still awesome.  Will make again and again.

Very good.  I had to substitute white vinegar for lime juice because I was out, and also regular onion instead of green onions.  I also used dried dill instead of cilantro because i had it on hand. I doubled the sauce.

Good salad, but it could have used a little more dressing. Not double the amount though like recommended in some other comments.

Love this healthy salad & its great for summer lunches!  Instead of couscous, I used bulgur and quinoa mix from Worlds Market.  I've also tried using the israeli (pearl) couscous.

Great flavors, I made this as another reviewer suggested as side to the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken.  Superb choice.  I would recommend using a good, flavorful extra virgin olive oil, as it comes through very well with the red pepper, lime and cumin.

I liked it and will probably make it again.  I modified.  I did not have red wine vinegar.  I used 2 tsp Shiraz and 2 tsp balsamic vinegar.  The salad lacked oomph, but was tasty.  Will try again with more modifications.  Note: I did take advice of previous posters and doubled olive oil, cumin, lime juice.

I made this recipe for a Mediterranean potluck, and it was delicious! I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled everything in the dressing except the olive oil, and I thought it was very flavorful. I used way less of the beans and corn called for though. I thought I'd use up the leftover beans and corn today by making this recipe again using quinoa instead of couscous, and it is definitely not as good. 
EDIT: The more I eat of the quinoa version, the more I like it! All thanks to that excellent dressing, I'd say. :)

I really liked the combination of ingredients but I would agree with other reviews that the dressing should be doubled. I also think I will add feta next time.

I followed the recipe to a T (except substituting green onions with onion), and found it rather flavourless. I then added more oil, vinegar, and lime juice. It turned out okay, but really needed more something-something.

Tasty, this received lots of compliments and requests. I doubled the dressing and only used one can of beans. Made it the night before and just before serving added a fresh squeeze of lime juice.

I made this yesterday for dinner.  Really tasty and colorful.  Easily adaptable.  I didn't have any couscous so I used quinoa instead.  I'm a vegetarian so I used water instead of chicken broth and substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Also used fresh-cooked corn instead of frozen.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great refreshing couscous salad! I didn't have green onion, fresh cilantro, OR red pepper. So, I used red onion, dried cilantro, and a bit of green pepper. Absolutely delicious and addicting. Thanks for the recipe Paula!

My hubby made this for dinner tonight as a side dish for grilled vegetable fajitas.  The only substitution he made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken since we're vegetarian.  We loved it!  Light and delicious.  It had a nice subtle flavor.  Perfect for summer.  Adding this to the recipe book!  Thank you :-)

Excellent flavor!  I used it as a main dish by adding cubed chicken cooked with onion and garlic, salt and pepper.  I don't eat green onions, so this was a way to get the onion into the dish.  We like our food spicy, so we added a half a jalapeno chopped finely with the red pepper.
The entire family loved it even the picky one!

This was GREAT! My family loved this. Husband said he wanted to eat it every day for the rest of his life and 8yo said he wanted to swim in it. I followed the recipe exactly except for changing the chicken broth to vegetable broth to accomodate a vegetarian diet.

I can't even count the amount of times I've made & thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! I only made changes out of necessity... The first time I made it, I did not have red wine vinegar, so I substituted it for white wine. (after trying with red, I do prefer white.) And I always do just a little bit more couscous as I don't want to waste the chicken broth from my can. So I do 2c chicken broth & about 1.5 c of couscous. Oh...and LOTS of cilantro, as my family loves it! thank you SO much Paula for sharing your recipe!!!

Great recipe when made exactly as written.  Do rinse the black beans, also I found that drained and rinsed canned corn is quite good if you don't have frozen on hand.

Delicious and healthy recipes!! Made this today for a potluck. Everyone enjoyed it. Only thing I might try next time is to add a little garlic. I might consider doubling the dressing as well. I did use low sodium vegetable broth to make the recipe vegan.

I loved this salad.  I bought some organic whole wheat couscous and was looking for a recipe to try and I am glad I tried this recipe.  Unfortunately when I halved the recipe, i cut the couscous down to 1/4 of a cup.  It really needs the 1/2 cup of couscous.  In addition, I cooked the couscous in the chicken broth but I also added the cumin and dried cilantro to the broth as well.  This gave the couscous so much flavor, i would eat it by itself.  the only thing I did differently with "sauce" was use cider vinegar instead since we did not have the red wine.

This was SO SO good! I'm already planning to make it again for next week. My substitutions: used red pepper instead of green, and hoisin sauce instead of chili sauce. I used about 1/4 more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, to get the consistency correct. Great recipe, and fast. Love that it is baked.

awesome and easy.  I added a small jalapeño - minced.  I also doubled the dressing (minus the evoo) and found that the black beans overpowered the corn so I now use about 1.5 cans of black beans and 1-2 cups of corn.  This dish is great served immediately, but chilled overnight and served the next day really brings out the flavor, especially the green onions!  Excellent served with a light salad and marinated grilled chicken.

This recipe did not receive 5 stars because it lacks flavor.  It it pretty bland, I would definitely recommend  adding a minced jalapeno and some Mediterranean spices.  I would love to make this again, next time I will spice it up!

one could easily substitute rice for the couscous here.  i would suggest using the juice of 2 limes at least, 1 TB of vinegar, and also adding a little bit of salt to taste to bring the flavor up a bit.

Excellent! I recommend serving this warm to bring out the flavors. I added cucumber and doubled the dressing per others' recommendations. I wish I had more limes in the house. I would have added a bit more lime juice to enhance it. It was delicious and kept well for several days.

I served it at a party cold, and it was a big hit! It is great that you can prepare the morning of the party & refrigerate until it is time to serve it. It is festive (colorful) & delicious! I also sampled a bit while it was still warm, & it was fabulous that way too!

Can be used as a side dish or a main.  I liked that it can be made the day before - just add the fresh herbs the day of.  This recipe has a little kick because of the cayenne - this prevents it from being just another bean and rice dish.  Next time I would add some chopped red or orange bell pepper for color - it was a pretty unattractive brown / gray dish.

I absolutely love this recipe, I cut it in half since it's just my husband and I, but I still had some left over for lunch the next day. I rinsed the black beans as was suggested, added a little more corn, and cut back a little on the oil but added more lime juice. Next time I would make a little more dressing but I think this will be my go-to side to bring to barbeque's in the future.

Great recipe! I made a mistake and put 2 Tbsp of vinegar in instead of the 1/2 and I also put more lime juice, but it was just right. I am not that keen on Cilantro, hate the smell, but I used it this time and it pleasently surprised me. This recipe is a keeper!

I need to remember not to make this until the rest of the dinner is ready to serve. Both times I've made this I haven't been able to stop eating and then I'm full by the time we sit down. This is one of the easiest and tastiest dishes I've made in a long time!

This has become a regular dish at our house.  I skip the corn and use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth but otherwise follow it exactly.  I have used lemon juice instead of lime - just because that's all we had at the time - still tastes great!

Eliminated bell pepper and used 4 green onions.  Next time, I plan to add onion, roasted peppers, and/or cucumbers.

Loved this--I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!  I served this as a main dish--my family doesn't eat any meat, so I cooked the couscous in vegetable broth.  I used canned corn instead of frozen and rinsed the beans well after draining.  The fresh cilantro is imperative to this dish...I rough chopped it only because I love cilantro and don't mind eating whole leaves.  I also added a little more cumin than was called for.  I could not stop eating this....I will be making this often!

Very good and unusual salad.  We liked it when it was a little warm (right after we made it) but it was delicious cold too.

If I could give this recipe more stars I would.  This is an amazing light salad that is great year round. This has become a staple at all of my bbqs in the summer and heavily requested at potluck gatherings.  It's a great change to your ordinary side dish.  Give this a chance.  During the winter, it's my goto for quick lunchtime meals with a piece of grilled chicken.  I substitute regular vinegar for the red wine and I would taste to adjust for more lime.  Acid is important to bring the flavor of this salad to life.

This is awesome.  The whole family loves it.  Yes rinse beans-but otherwise perfect as is.  My 14 year old who doesn't do leftovers,  devoured the rest of this the next day.

this recipes is bland as written, hence the less than 5 stars.  i had to add cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder to give it more flavor.  i also halfed the beans and green onions, and thought it was fine. love taking this to work for lunch!

Yum. This would probably deserve 5 stars if I had followed the directions properly, but I made a few minor adjustments. I used veg broth instead of chicken broth (because I'm a veggie). I also didn't have a few ingredients on hand, so I swapped lemon juice for lime, omitted the green onions, added celery for some crunch, and instead of cilantro I used dill and coriander. Still delicious! Much to his surprise, my husband loved it too. I'll definitely make again (and next time I hope to make it properly! ;)

Based on other reviews, I doubled the dressing and decreased the green onions and black beans by half.  I brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it.

Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly (except used whole wheat couscous) and it turned out great! Next time I might add a little more lime juice and possibly a little more olive oil but other than I thought it was a great recipe! We ate it with corn chips and also cucumber slices and it was delicious!

Made last night to take to friends for dinner and it was a huge hit and will become my new potluck staple! I made changes based on reviews (1 can of beans, 4 grn onions, 1 tsp cumin and double vinegar). And while it was good, next time I will go with 3-4  TBL of lime, 4 TBL oil, 1 TBL of vinegar, 1 TBL cumin and will throw in some cayenne. I also cooked fresh corn on the cob and sliced it off instead of frozen, but only when you can still get good fresh corn. Oh, and I definitely used the whole wheat couscous!

This was awesome! I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used raspberry vinegar instead. I also didn't have green onions, so I substituted 1/4 cup red onion, then added some diced celery. I topped it off with grilled lemon pepper chicken from Trader Joe's.  Yum!!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it is wonderful.  I get rave reviews every single time and would not change a thing although my daughter and her boyfriend do not like cilantro so I have on occasion omitted the cilantro and they loved it that way as well.

This tasted good the night I made it but it tasted awesome, cold, the next day! I had no black beans so used butter beans instead and they were a nice texture compliment to all the crunchy veggies. So simple, but so great (and healthy!)

This salad was great.  The 4 stars are simply because my husband would prefer fewer onions.  I liked it the way it was, but the onion flavor was very strong, and I would like to see how it does with just 6 green onions rather than 8.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. I added red onions and used green bell pepper instead of red. I wasn't sure if the recipe called for cooking the corn, so I went ahead and steamed it before adding to salad.  This is a keeper. We love it. Thank you.

I shouldn't really be reviewing this recipe as i left out half of it but I wanted to make couscous and jazz it up a bit without adding too much fuss where the kiddo wouldn't eat it.  just used white beans and made the sauce minus the cilantro as i didn't have any but do love and would like to use it next time.  this is really pretty good and maybe someday for company I'll make it with all the vegies called for!

Awesome and easy and healthy. Can eat this for lunch all week. I too added cucumber and feta cheese. My limes didn't produce much juice so I think I ended up with less than 2 T, and I def wish I had a little more juice in it, but its still great.

I followed this recipe, and it was good, but I needed more sauce than it called for so I doubled it.  I only used one can of beans since I'm not a huge fan of this legume.  I added fresh corn from the cob and it was outstanding!!! I used spiced morrocan olive oil from the oil and vinegar store and the flavor was out of this world!!!  I'm packing the leftovers for my foodie friend to eat for lunch tomorrow because I am so confidant in the taste of this.  When it is 90 degrees outside, this is the meal to serve.

So good! I have always been a fan of couscous. Since I have three kids; 5,3,1 it makes for a great last minute side. It was even better with the extra veggies! I paired it with the mushroom and swiss chicken recipe that's on here. They worked together really well since they had a lot of flavors in common, but tasted different enough to not be boring. This all made for a great dinner.

I liked it but found that I needed to add a little more red wine vinegar and some garlic salt and onion powder for flavor. Of course I love spicy things so that could be why I needed to add a little extra. Great with sriracha too! Oh I also used just one can of black beans and added a tomato.

Was looking for a side-dish that was different than the old stand-bys and found this recipe.  Not trying couscous before I heard a lot of 'eeewww what is that stuff?'  However, I got them to try it and heard, "This stuff is pretty good."I followed the recipe as is and it was a hit.  Will definately make this again.

This is a great recipe. I have never used couscous before and so this was my first dish with it and i can say i will continue to use couscous. I opted for fresh black beans instead so i popped them in a pressure cooker with some black pepper and salt to cook. I used canned corn too. And for the vinaigrette I didnt have cumin so i left it out, subsituted red wine vinaigrette with apple cider, and added a dash of Kraft Tuscan syle vinaigrette, oh and i also omitted the oil, since i added the tuscan vinaigrette.

This is good either warm or cold--I prefer it cold, hubby prefers it warm. Big hit! I used only one can of beans, but it was still great.

The kids and I really liked this but the hubby did not.  He doesnt really care for couscous.  I only had one can of beans and I didnt add any green pepper.  Very good side for tacos or fajitas!

Very good.  I substituted one can of kidney beans for one of the cans of black beans.  I also added extra couscous and broth since I wanted to use the whole 10z box of couscous and 14 oz (2 cup) can of broth.  I doubled the ingredients in the dressing. UPDATE: Made a 2nd time and substituted chopped steamed baby carrots for the red pepper. Otherwise, I did the same as I mentioned above.  Very good again.  Toddler and husband prefer the baby carrots.  I like either way.

I have been making this salad for a while now as it is a perfect DIET food.   Have a scoop with tuna for lunch, you'll feel full until dinner time.  It's similiar to the middle eastern dish, tabouleh..but much easier to make.  Even my husband pulls this out of the fridge and devours it...and it does store in the fridge for up to a week.  Great recipe, I love it.

This was a great recipe, although I thought there would be more cous cous, so the next time I make this I'll reduce the beans and increase the cous cous.

This salad was delicious.  I didn't have green onions so used a small onion and diced it very small and I doubled the dressing.  Next time I am going to use green onions and increase the cilantro.  I also think a drizle of maple syrup would be a nice additional flavor...but I have to try that.  This will become a healthy, filling low fat staple in my home.  Thanks!

This is the second summer that I have made this salad.  It is one of my favorite salads to make.  The combination of couscous, black beans, and cilantro make this a wonderful recipe.  I make it exactly as it says.

This is the best salad to take to a BBQ and I can leave it at room temperature and not worry about it!! The only thing I changed was I didn't add quite as much olive oil. Other than that, it's delicious!

Love it! I just made this for a BBQ tomorrow and had to taste test. It is very tasty and very healthy! I am excited for my family to try. I kept everything the same and used Hodgson Mill's Whole Wheat Couscous with Milled Flaxseed & Soy.

Delicious with a refreshing taste! I served it at a small picnic and got the thumbs up from my guests. It didn't keep as well as I expected, though...the black beans gave it an odor after a day of storing the leftovers.

A friend brought this salad to a picnic this summer, and it has been a favorite of mine ever since.  The colors are so nice, and the flavors blend so well together.  I have added chicken and served as dinner to my family; it's great!

Nice!  This was really good and easy.  I did like others suggested and doubled the dressing.  I left out the green onions (because I didn't have any and I'm not a big fan of them) and substituted edamame for the corn.  I also replaced one can of the black beans with kidney beans.  I thought it had a nice flavor, subtle but satisfying....It would be great as a summer side dish to serve at a BBQ.

I made this for a church picnic and thought it was great.  I love the unusual combination of the lime juice and cumin.  Some reviewers suggested using other beans, so I used one can of black beans and one of pinto beans, mainly to give the salad even more color.  It's not only easy and delicious, it's very colorful and pretty to look at as well.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

I loved the flavor of this dish, but not the color the black beans gave it!  I have made it several times using different beans, and love it!!  I was hoping this dish would taste like one i ate at a family reunion..and this was better!!

Made this for Labor Day weekend picnic.  I got alot of positive feedback!  I used whole wheat couscous--turned out great! Will definitely make again.  My husband ate it by the bowl full with hot sauce on it.  Even toddler ate it!

Very refreshing! I added finely chopped celery, cucumber and cherry tomato halves to make it more of a meal. With the additions I also made a bit more dressing and used more lime and vinegar than oil. It was a hit and I have been asked to make it over and over again!

Great dish. I prefer to use red kidney beans in place of the black beans, but that's just personal preference. I found that the amount of dressing is perfect and I don't change it. I normally only make a half recipe...it makes a lot!

This is my first couscous experience!  Two thumbs up--couldn't stop eating it out of the serving bowl.  I made a few substitutions/additions to add more zip.  I used apple cidar vinegar instead of red wine, subbed 1/2 red onion for green,added two cloves garlic & a dash of hot sauce to the dressing.  Also used one can of black beans, omitted corn & added an orange pepper as well as red. I used the whole wheat couscous--don't think this would change the flavor much.  Sooo Good!

This recipe is very refreshing, it does dry out some after a day or so, so I would just splash on some red wine vinegar and it was great.  Super side, or nice light lunch.

This was surprisingly good!  I just made it this morning so I wouldn't have to cook in the heat this afternoon and I am thinking about having some for lunch!  It was tasty! 

Here are my changes from the original.  I used one can of black beans and whole wheat couscous.  I didn't have a red pepper so I substituted 2 tbs of chopped pickled jalapenos (we like it spicy).  I used canned corn.  Lastly, I added a heaping spoonful of salsa to the dressing, left out half of the oil and put in 2 tbs of red wine vinegar.  Absolutely great!

Very colourful and easy to make salad.  However, it was a bit on the bland side.  The flavour of the cumin was not recognized.  It needs another spice, or ingredient to perk it up.  But I don't know what.  Perhaps garlic?

Have been looking for salad recipes now that it is so hot. This was good, don't know why but i haven't had couscous before. I made vegetarian broth and used that instead of chicken. Also only had one can of beans and added a jalepeno really nice light salad. Alot have said they doubled dressing but i liked as is. Thanks

I enjoyed this salad.  I did double the dressing to coat all of it.  But next time I am going to add less olive oil and more vinegar.  Overall it was very good, easy, and healthy!

My new favorite summer salad.  Made exacly as noted.  Easy to add or subtract flavors as you like.  Will probably remove some of the oil to reduce fat in the future.

This is such a perfect salad! The flavors are amazing! Unlike similar salads, this one can be eaten right away, but is delicious chilled as well. I made it as written and it's perfect.
Many reviewers have said to double the dressing, but I found it quite good as is.

Excellent.  I made this for the first time for a outdoor party and recieved many compliments.  I made the recipe "as is" but it would be easy to change the amount of flavoring or make other additions (tomatoes, cucumber, cheese crumbles, etc.)  I used fresh leftover sweet corn instead of canned corn and the flavor was wonderful.  I will be making this again during the summer.  It is equally good as a side or main dish.

This was so delicious, I only changed/swapt the chicken broth for veggie broth and it was still really good.  Also I did add a bit less onion, I thought what was called for was too much for my family.  All in all I will make this again soon.

Very good recipe, but I felt like it needed something...maybe some heat. Next time, I will add a chopped jalapeno. This is my first time making and eating couscous. I really enjoyed it, as did my husband. I served this with spicy grilled chicken.

This recipe is fantastic!  I definitely recommend using fresh lime juice as the recipe calls for, because the fresh flavors in this dish are wonderful.  This was so quick and easy to prepare, and I usually have all of these ingredients on hand.  My husband and I could not stop eating this at dinner last night and almost put the whole thing away!  What little that was left over was just as good and light and fluffy today as it was fresh last night.

This was an excellent salad, with a ton of flavour!  I did make some changes, however, not necessarily because I thought the recipe needed changing, some based on other's reviews and a couple of my own!  I scaled the size down a bit as I was not making this for a large crowd - used a total of one can of beans (mix between red kidney and black as they were already in my fridge), 1/2 orange bell pepper (no red on hand), 2/3 c. each corn and organic whole wheat couscous, about 3 or 4 green onions, and fresh parsley as I really dislike cilantro.  I did double the dressing per others reviews as well, but cut down on the oil by about half as I do for most dressing recipes (prefer more vinegar, less oil).  I cooked (if you can call it that!!!) the couscous per the package directions using the chicken broth (low sodium).  Can't wait to have some leftover for lunch today...and to take to many upcoming gatherings!  Thanks for sharing.

Great as a meal!  I added some diced cucumbers and tomoatoes and had for lunch.  Easy to prepare and kept great in the fridge.  I do agree that a bit more dressing is necessary.

We loved this bean salad.  I had 2 cans of black beans and wanted to use them so I did a search and found this one with others.  I didn't have the couscous or the corn so I substitued long grain rice and tomatoes and it was really good!  Thank you!

I have made this many times.  It is very versatile.  I love the dressing and sometimes use lemon instead of lime juice.  I also like to use edemame beans in place of the corn.  Yummy and healthy!

With a couple of quick tweaks, this recipe is very delicious - even my boyfriend's "country folk" family love it and ask for it repeatedly!  I about double the dressing portion - I use 5 tbsp EVOO, the juice from one lime, 2 tsp red wine vinegar, and 1 tsp cumin. Other than that, follow the recipe as written.

Followed the recipe, except doubled the dressing ingredients.  It was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I thought the green onions were a little much for my taste. I doubt I would make again.  It sounded really good.

I made this recipe for a large family get-together and it went over BIG!  Several people asked for the recipe and even called me several days later to ask for it.  I also recommended to my sister who lives out of state and she took it to a potluck and she said that she got tons of compliments.  Very foregiving recipe so you can add more or less of any ingredients to taste.

Great.  It makes a lot, but I took to party, so it was all gone.  I used an orange pepper and added a diced tomato, so the colors really popped.  Used twice the dressing it calls for, after reading the reviews they were right, more dressing is needed.  Will make again, it was a hit.

This is so good, I just made it for the second time.  This time I used white onion, and one can kidney beans since that is what I had and it is still great!

LOVED IT!  I only used 1 can of beans, they are hard to find here and added one minced clove of garlic and one finely chopped tomato.  I also doubled everything for the dressing except used only 5 TBS of olive oil.  We will be making this all summer as long as I can find the beans!

Loved this!  I didn't have any couscous so I subbed acini di pepe pasta, used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, and I added a cup of shredded mozzarella.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the dressing but it's great!  Thanks for such a great lunch to pack for work, this is yummy!

This was excellent.  I used 2 cups cooked brown rice instead of couscous.  I used the entire bunch of cilantro.  I used 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans.  I used an orange pepper rather than red for more color.  Several people asked for the recipe and I would def make it again!

Very good.  After a day, it was rather dry, but still tasty.  I used only half the cilantro, and it was still very strong.  I will definitely make it again.

Great, served it with the spicy garlic lime chicken (also from this site). Changes I made were increasing lime to 3 TB, using 2 tsp red wine vinegar, and 1 tsp cumin. I was out of chicken bullion, so I used beef instead, added only one can of black beans, omitted the cilantro, and replaced the red pepper with tomatoes. Perfect.

This is a really good salad!  It's easy to put together and takes almost no time at all.  I did substitute white beans for the black, only because I'm not crazy about black beans.  I think next time I make this, I will add in some toasted pine nuts. This is definitely a keeper!

Amazing. I don't give just any recipe a 5 star either. I have used this recipe dozens of times and every single time I have had rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I along with other pair it with the spicy lime chicken.

The cumin is what makes this recipe delicious.  I made this for a potluck and ate half the bowl before I even took  it...it's yummy!  I added lemon juice instead of lime juice and it was still fantastic.  I'll definitely make this again....maybe even tomorrow night. :)

Followed other reviews and doubled the "dressing" ingredients. This is a fantastic and healthy dish. Great for company and pot luck dinners. Not labor intensive (didn't take 30 min), nor did it call for complex ingredients!

This salad was amazing!  I added double the lime, just for a little more kick.  If I were to change anything, I would use the juice of one whole medium size lemon.  The flavor was great, but I didn't want to add any salt, by adding extra lime, it gave just enough acidity to kick it up a notch...so to speak.  We served it with the adobo steak and it was a perfect combination, tomorrow, we're serving it up with the prawns with mango and avacado salsa...YUM!  I love allrecipes.com!  I tell everyone about it!  So should you!!!!

Good light salad.  Used garbanzo beans for a change and red onion in place of green onions.  Worked great.  I prefer a little extra lime juice, cilantro and cumin.  Great for summer potlucks.

Good change to traditional BBQ salads. Everyone loved it. I bought the Near East Garlic & Olive Oil flavor couscous. Then mixed the spice packet in with mixture to give it some extra flavor. Easy to make also!

This was a quick and easy dish that looked great and tastes delicious.  Following the recommendations of other reviewers, I made extra dressing and only used one can of beans.  This would be an excellent potluck dish, since it would taste good cold or at room temperature.

Don't know what happened here because I love all of the ingredients. It turned out way too salty. Husband liked it better than I did. I will probably try it again and eliminate the salt.

I really enjoyed this, and looks so fresh.  I took it to a hockey social and about half of it went.  Probably because it was something quite different than what people are used to.  I will make again, and who knows, I might experiment with different dressings and veggies.

This recipe was great, everybody liked it. Relatively healthy and very filling, plus it introduced some people to some new tastes (the kind that don't even know what couscous is). I prepared nearly exactly to the recipe - save it exchanging corn with some yellow bell peppers (adds the colour and not nearly as starchy). Next time I won't add nearly so many beans and a little bit more flavouring (funny how peoples suggestions seem to be what is the best). Thanks for the great recipe again!

Pretty good.  Definately a keeper.  Doubled the dressing ingredients, except for olive oil...used 4 Tbsp.  And only used one can of beans and 1 can of corn instead of 1 cup of frozen corn.

Love this couscous recipe!!  I've made this several times, and it's always excellent.  I prefer to use only 1 can of beans, triple the red wine vinegar, and use only 2 T olive oil.  I also use vegan chicken broth.  I've used both regular and whole wheat couscous.  They taste the same, so I'd recommend the whole wheat as it's healthier.  Definitely give this a try--it's the perfect light, quick, and easy summer meal!

I cut out the chicken broth, lime juice and green onions (I didn't have the onions)...added a couple of dashes of curry powder and chipotle chile pepper to kick it up a notch...pretty yummy!!  Oh, and I substituted Orzo for the couscous (didn't have that either)

This is soooo good.  I just made this for supper tonight and when tasting it for seasoning purposes only, I couldn't believe how good it was.  I skipped the red pepper, but added a dash of cayenne and used vidalia onion instead of the scallions.  Also added extra vinegar. This will be a great side dish all summer long.

I love this recipe with no alterations (although I use low sodium chicken broth to reduce the sodium content and it still tastes great)! My family enjoys this as a vegetarian dinner, not just a salad, and it tastes great cold leftover the next day. When I make this for a party, I double the recipe to be sure I have my own leftovers!

My husband loved this recipe. I doubled the dressing except for the oil and used freshly ground toasted cumin seeds. I lightly grilled some tomatoes and served the salad over the top. It was fabulous! UPDATE: Added some medium chipotle salsa to the dressing and roasted the frozen corn kernels (after defrosting) in a fry pan, added some cherry tomatoes!!!! TO DIE FOR!!!

This salad is perfect for a summer cook out, its light and refreshing. I only used 1 can of black beans and this was plenty, I also tripled the dressing except for the oil, only used a little bit more than it called for. I used lime juice concentrate because thats all I had, use fresh lime juice if you have it, I think it would taste better. Also added some crushed red pepper for a little more flavor. What a great salad.

I served this to guests and they raved and raved.  It's so simple, yet delicious, colorful, and nutritious.  I served it as a side with sausage dogs, but I think it would be great with garlic lime chicken.  Perfect for summer.  Yum!

This was an excellent salad.  I made it this weekend for a Fathers Day BBQ, and everyone loved it. I substituted chick peas for the beans, and added black olives.  As per previous reviewers, I doubled the dressing.  I think next time, I'll even triple it, just to have some extra.

I really like this recipe but for some reason it's not a great one for parties -- maybe folks just don't go for cous-cous as much as I do.  But if you like cous-cous salads, you've gotta try this one!

Wonderful, and easy to make!  I used only 4 green onions, because I find the flavour a little too strong.  Looking forward to trying it with chick peas instead of black beans next time!

I only used half the onions, two-thirds of the beans, and no vinegar -- not because I chose to, but because that's all I had -- and it still turned out wonderfully!  It's very colourful, tasty, and works just great as a snack or part of a meal, as far as I'm concerned.  Best of all, it takes almost no time at all to make.

This recipe is a keeper for me. I would not substitute any ingrediant. I did however use 2 ears of corn-on-the-cob and I grilled it and I added a bit more lime juice. YUMMY! thank's so much. I LOVE THIS WEBSITE, I USE IT ALMOST DAILY.

The ingredients blend together beautifully but I found it a bit bland.  Next time I will use more cilantro and lime, substitute black beans for chick peas, and add tomatoes.

I really like this!  Thanks.  I also made it again and simplified it for kids' sake:  omitted the onions & pepper, and the cumin, and added extra lime juice.  They actually liked it!

This is a wonderful salad that is quick to prepare.  A great and unique addition to summer cookouts!  I have made it three times and experimented a little each time.  I have decided to omit the onion & red pepper and replace them with a can of rotel tomatos.  One can of beans instead of two works great.

I've recently started preparing couscous and love it, my 6 year old even likes it.  This recipe is incredible.  I shared it with a co-worker and she also thought it was great.  Last time I made it, I added some cut up hot link sausage for a main course.  Boy was it good, I ate it for 3 days. Makes alot!

Great recipe! I also halved the green onions.... doubled the couscous amount and added some extra seasoning due to the additional couscous. Everybody loved this recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I changed it up because we like a lot of spice - sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in the olive oil, then added the cumin to toast it a bit.  I used steamed green beans and carrots instead of black beans, as I needed more of a side dish this time.  This is a keeper - versatile, and everyone loved it.

Very good, good for you, but somewhat lacking in flavor.  I added garlic and cayenne pepper to spice it up.  I don't like bell peppers so I substituted cherry tomatoes which I cut in half.

Super easy and quick to make. Perfect for a hot afternoon or use it as a side dish!  I was flexible with the amounts shown and even seasoned the couscous with (basil, garlic powder, dried minced onion, pepper and a bullion cube into the boiling water) which added extra taste.  This recipe would be great at potlucks and BBQ's too!!!

I added one red bell pepper and used half of a yellow onion, instead of the green onions. I like this warm, rather than cold. Reason why I cooked the onions and bell peppers. Definitely something I would make again when in need of something quick.

Easy to make and great flavor. I used pearl couscous instead (did 1 1/2 cups of liquid instead of 1 cup to follow recipe for the pearl couscous) and added bite sized chicken that was sautéed with olive oil and chili powder and placed on top for added protein. Will definitely be making again.

Love this salad.  It accompanies many dishes well.  I love it especially with fish!   After making it with two cans, I now prefer using  just one.   The taste, consistency and texture I think are much better (and I am a big black bean fan).   And if you have any gasey individuals in your house, you'll be grateful:)

LOVE THIS!! Made it three times in one week - just wish I'd known to get pearl couscous (I got the tiny kind cause it was my first time.) I tweaked a little of the ingredients I know I love like cilantro - I added like a cup, but that's cause I love it. Great new version of a black bean salad.

Agreed.  You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe no matter what you do!  I went with what I had and added:  charro beans (seasoned Mexican pinto beans) grilled corn off the Cobb, cucumber, tomato, shredded carrot and fresh mint.  Considered adding gorgonzola but tasted a bite with it and it was too overpowering so I didn't.  Delish!

My husband loves this.  The only thing I did different was to use a red, yellow and orange pepper.  He thought it was store bought and surprised how much he loved it.  It will be a regular at our house.

This recipe was delicious...and yes, it's healthy too, full of fiber!  I used seasoned black beans as it was all I had available in the cabinet, and I left most of the juice from the beans in the salad.  I will definitely be making this again...Yummy!

The couscous came in a box with a wild mushroom & herb season. I cooked the couscous in chicken broth and the seasoning mix. That was the only thing I altered. It tastes great. May add chicken with my leftovers for lunch.

I made this because of one of those nights where you have to make dinner with what's in the house. I didn't have cilantro, and did dice a tomato and added it. Other than that made it exactly. The red wine vinegar especially added a lot to the flavor. Will make this again.

I made this for a simple dinner with chicken recently.  Carefully rinsed the black beans as one reviewer said.  When I cooked the couscous according to the recipe not all the liquid got absorbed but I drained it snd it wasn’t a problem.  I love this recipe and will be making it again it’s a keeper.

I substituted veggie broth for chicken broth and Ume Plum vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Turned out great!

I thought this was very good. I'm always looking for easy, healthy recipes for my family.
I didn't have a bell pepper, so I just grated up a carrot instead. I also substituted a 1/4c of finely chopped onion for the green onions. I also used one can of black beans and one can of tri-bean (kidney, pinto, and black beans mixed). 
This recipe seems pretty flexible but I highly recommend the lime and fresh cilantro.

This salad is light and delicious! The first time we made it using the chicken broth, but we've made it using water instead and it was just as good. We also substituted the black beans and bell pepper for chickpeas and cucumber. Perfect with a light beer on the patio!

I forgot to get limes, therefore had to use lemon juice. It still tasted great. The taste really develops after a few hours of the dressing soaking into the couscous. I recommend making it at least 4 hours before serving.

I followed the recipe exactly and though it's a great blend of fresh flavors, I really can't taste the dressing.  I'll be making this again but I think I'll double the dressing.

I doubled the dressing and added 2 jalepenos. I also only used 4 green onions and eliminated cilantro. I had chick peas and red kidney beans in my pantry so I used them instead of black beans. Next time, I might add tomatoes and cucumbers. I might also make chicken breast to go along with this recipe.

I have made this a half dozen or more times and I will say I love the texture of this dish but I need to spice it up a little somehow.  The flavor is just a little lacking (from my perspective) I am going to try some cayenne or maybe a little diced jalapeno next time to give it a little flavor bump.  It is however a great alternative that has great texture and color.

This is a delicious recipe that was gobbled up, especially by my guests who lean toward a healthier diet.  I've made it twice and am about to make it again.  The only comment is it has quite a mild flavor so it benefits from adding a little table salt to each serving and/or a little extra squeeze of lime.  Delish.

I’ve made this quite a few times.  Due to my family’s taste buds I eliminate the cumin.  I also use less beans then recipe calls far.  It’s a great dish to bring to summer bbq’s.

I've been trying to prepare make ahead salads as a side dish for our protein  serving instead of rice or potatoes.  This was excellent and really filled the bill.  The couscous combined with the beans and other veges were a wonderful combination and provided lots of nutrients.  The dressing was just sublime.  Highly recommend for any occasion - would be great addition to a buffet.

I liked it, but took the advice to put in more cumin.  I also doubled the vineger.  Next time, I will add some cayenne to give it a bit more bite.  Nice combination of flavours and looks pretty.

Didn’t add corn, used pinto, garbanzo and northern beans. Had to add bottled Italian dressing because the couscous soaked up the recipe’s dressing.

This is de-lish!!!  Only thing I didn't add was cilantro, as I am not a cilantro fan :)  Otherwise, followed directions exactly--used another reviewer's suggestion to rinse beans well---and it turned out perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will definitely make it again!  And again, and again...…   I made it the day before I used it, and it held together perfectly!!

SOOOO GOOOOD!  I took the advice of others and added the extra Cumin and Balsamic Vinegar along with some Garlic salt...because garlic salt goes in everything...Right!?!  This is a KEEPER!  I cut up some chicken in bite size pieces, seasoned them with cumin, Cavender's  Greek seasoning and yes Garlic salt and served it with over the couscous and it was the Full Meal Deal!  THANK YOU!

This was a great salad to have with Tacos instead of the traditional rice and beans.  I'll make for my next pot luck to share with friends.

I have made this twice. The first time I made it I didn’t have couscous on hand so I used quinoa instead. The second time I made it I was sure to pick up some couscous. I have to say I prefer it with the quinoa. Regardless, this dish is delicious and fresh. I will make this many more times, with quinoa ??

Easy, quick, nutritious and just a little different. Soak beans in advance for a low-sodium variation. Frankly, the flavors in this dish are so delicious you don't need any salt!  Easy, in a pinch substitutions still make a great salad.

SOOOO GOOOD!!! I subbed the chicken broth for veggie broth and it still tastes AMAZING. I also only used one can of beans instead of two, but it’s plenty for this recipe. I think next time I’ll add a little bit of garlic powder to it, too.

YES YES YES!! This is divine, exactly as written! I make a huge batch of this once a week for meals throughout my days. 
Great for breakfast: I scoop up a bowl and top it with a couple of fried eggs. Once the warm yolk breaks and covers the salad it's oh so yummy!
Lunch Time? Try a bowl with half a chopped avocado, dollop of Greek yogurt (or sour cream) and some hot sauce.
It's also great as is and has become a staple for me and my family. We never get tired of these flavors!

Made this last night, it was good and fairly healthy. (Mrs. type 1 diabetic, and Mr. triple bypass operation over here.) Had it for lunch and threw some apple chunks in, very good.  Had it again tonight with some shrimp and some mango chunks added.  Very, VERY, good. This is a recipe that is easy to add stuff to  make it even more awesome. 
PS Good as leftovers, obviously.

I love this salad!  I used only 1 can of spicy black beans [drained and rinsed] and 4 green onions, only because I preferred more couscous than veggies.  I then served it right away so it was warm [I like it warm better because you can taste more of the nutty flavor of the couscous].  I will definitely have this again!!

This couscous salad was really delish! I used a fresh red pepper from my garden and parsley in place of cilantro (because I hate cilantro!). I was concerned there wouldn’t be enough dressing, but there was plenty to coat everything. It could have used a tiny bit less green onion, but I think mine (which were also from my garden) were bigger than usual. All in all a great simple salad that's easy to throw together with stuff I usually have on hand.

As others recommended, I only used 1 can of black beans, I used 4T of oil and doubled the lime juice, red wine vinegar, and cumin.  Instead of frozen corn I just used Green Giants can of niblets corn which we love.  Also used another recommendation and made it vegan friendly by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Couscous took longer to cook than what recipe says.  I still had a lot of broth not absorbed and too firm couscous, so I turned heat back on and watched it carefully to make sure it didn't over cook and get mushy (my first time making couscous).  Came out fine, but next time I will follow couscous package instructions for the timing.  We had three different salads at cookout, and this was everyone's favorite and the first to be finished off!  I loved it!

I love this recipe. It's easy to make and a delicious light dish. It has become my favorite pot luck dish due to its versatility. I also will substitute Veggie Broth for Chicken Broth when making it for work to be vegan friendly.

So delicious. I double the dressing and even more than double the lime. My favorite beans for this are half chickpea half black.

I absolutely LOVE this salad.  Delicious!  I did thoroughly rinse the black beans as someone suggested which also reduces the sodium.

Made for a work pot luck - mixed up and served beautifully on the table!  I followed recipe but doubled the sauce mix and tossed in a half cup of feta cheese.  Great colors and flavor!

I loved this. I made it on Sunday. Today is Thursday and it still tastes amazing. I shared it with a friend and lunch. Now she wants the recipe.
I substituted Bob's Red Mill Grain Medley for the Couscous to get some extra protein into it. Other than that no changes to the recipe. Yummy. Thanks for this recipe. 
I will definitely be making this again soon.

I made this exactly as written. We loved it. It was a great side dish and would hold up well on a buffet or picnic. You could easily add ingredients: avocado, tomato, chicken, etc to make a meal out of it.

Great way to use the remaining black beans; just husband and self. Substituted Greek seasoning from Savory Spice shop for the cumin for a more Mediterranean flavor. Definitely add to my rotation.

I did not know to use the larger ?pearl couscous- and did not have green onions (used regular diced finely) It was a great success - A 2 year old d it up and asked for more.

This is so very good! I will say that I did add some things that I wanted to use up. A little extra lime juice, an additional red pepper, three Roma tomatoes, two jalapenos, red onion, and more cilantro. I did make sure to rinse the beans. It's both beautiful and tasty!

Delicious after simple modifications based on reviews.  Double  - Olive Oil, Lime Juice, Red Wine Vinegar, & Cumin.  Only use 1 can of Rinsed Black Beans.  I did not use fresh limes.  Used whole wheat pearl couscous & cooked with chicken broth according to couscous container recipe (when I cooked according to original recipe instructions, had to throw away).  Added salt & pepper at serving.  Tasted even better 2nd & 3rd day!

One suggested change to the wording of the recipe: it should specify *pearl* couscous to avoid confusion. We loved this salad. Will definitely make it again. I found that I needed to simmer the couscous a bit after letting it sit for the recommended 5 minutes. I also rinsed it just before adding it to the dish to remove any sticky-gluey-ness. I agree with other reviewers that the dressing could be a bit perkier. Next time I may try some tweaks, but the bottom line is that this dish disappeared fast!

I was very happy with the taste of this.  I used two chicken thighs boiled for about 10 minutes to make the stock for the couscous rather than the stock cubes.  I then chopped up the chicken and fried it in its own juice to make sure it was cooked through and then served on the side - yummy.  One could toss it in with the salad if you wanted to.

I recalled from the first time I made this recipe that there wasn't enough dressing. Today I doubled the recipe, including the dressing. Then when the salad was assembled I tasted it, decided it did need more dressing, and added some nice Italian salad dressing.  Added, mixed, tasted - several times. I probably added as half again as much Italian dressing as recipe dressing. We all liked it and I will make it that way again.

Great recipe! I highly recommend it for those who meal prep because the texture holds well and the flavors just get better with time.  I made the following changes: 

-The recipe doesn't specifically call for it, but I used Israeli couscous (as pictured) because I prefer it's texture versus traditional couscous for cold salads. 

-Instead of using one red bell pepper I used an assortment of colors of mini sweet peppers. 

-I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the "dressing" ingredients (EVOO, red wine vinegar, lime juice, cumin and S&P). 

I also second the advice of recommending that you fully rinse your black beans before adding them.

I just made this recipe and kept it almost exact except for the cayenne pepper that I added to the dressing for some extra kick. It's soooo delicious! Since its summer I used fresh corn cut uncooked off the cob. It adds a natural sweetness and crunch.

I seem to change recipes a bit.  This one I only used one can of black beans and for me it was good, not so over whelming. 
I didn't have red wine vinager so used white wine vinager and I added cherry tomatoes cut in quarters/or halves along with other ingredients .  All my guest loved it.

4 star as written, can be tweaked to 5 star with your customizing. Really loved this salad when served at a family function. Super important to to use the Israeli cous cous, pearl style for the dish. We eat the grainy cous cous a lot, and the pearl variety was very nice. Recipe as written is 4-star, as the dressing definitely is a bit bland and needs some doubling of spice and lime as other reviewers recommended. Delicious if you have fresh corn in season and can cut the corn off the cob.

First, I made it exactly as written.  My very picky husband LOVED it!  He has requested it just like this again.  When I make it for myself I often use more cilantro, because I love cilantro,  use the small sweet peppers.  For extra zing I have added jalapeños and/or squeezed more fresh lime juice on top.

We loved it!  We were looking for something light for dinner and something that didn't require firing up the oven or the stove.  We're in the dead of summer here in Houston right now (July7).    I left out the green onions since my wife can't eat them.  The dish was easy to make, tasty, and beautiful.  I particularly enjoy making dishes that are pretty to look at.  We had leftovers so my wife will take some for her lunch and I will have it for my lunch tomorrow as well. Great dish!

Very few experiences eating couscous and have never made it. This recipe could not have made it easier and what a great new side dish for summer! Tastes great immediately after combining and can't wait to try it again cold after the flavors have combined even more. I can't say enough how simple this is to make and if looking for a summer side that isn't mayo or heavy, go no further. Wonderful dish!

I made this salad and I found it to be bitter....very bitter. I don't know what caused this. I even added some shredded carrot to try to sweeten it a bit but that didn't help. 

It wasn't inedible by any means. Once you get past the bitterness, it was quite good. Next time, I will make some changes and see if that makes a difference because I like the ingredients which was the main reason I made it.

One of my favorite recipes, but I do tailor it for me. I use kidney beans instead of black, red onion instead of green, more lime juice and a bit of lemon and add in some Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning. Also, it looks like a new pic on the recipe. That pic has pearl couscous instead of regular, for the record.

Fresh, crunchy, and tasty. We used Israeli couscous because that was what was in the house. Perfect light healthy dinner on a 90 degree day.

I agree with the reviews that it needs more flavor. I am going to add more lime and some feta cheese to my leftovers tomorrow and hope that helps. Next time I am going to reduce the green onion and perhaps use a small amount of red onion instead.

I made this  the day before to take to a potluck, and the black beans were hard. Is this typical? It didn't say to cook them.  Loved the whole premis of this salad but I must have done something wrong.

I used a packaged couscous with its flavor pack, and 1 can of beans.  The end result looked like it had the right proportions of ingredients.  It tasted fine warm, but I added more seasonings because I thought it would seem blander when chilled.

Very good recipe. This salad is not only tasty, but healthy and easy to make.
Couscous is a staple in Moroccan cuisine. I have been cooking with couscous both the traditional Moroccan way and other ways for years and I know it absorbs sauces and dressings like a sponge. So I went ahead and doubled the dressing ingredients and that was the right amount for me.

I adjusted it a little, including not adding the couscous and adding corn, avocado, and jalapeño. I also added a little sugar because it was pretty tart at first (maybe it was the lime I used). It was tasty!

I used more lime juice, personal preference, but also used a sriracha infused salt for a little kick. It's a great recipe.

So GOOD!  I doubled the dressing (minus the olive oil) and doubled the amount of couscous, and it was perfect!  I might try adding a bit more dressing (again, minus the oil) next time!

Was a little bland until I touched it up.  Added more lime juice and red wine vinegar, some hot sauce, some salsa and some lime olive oil.  But a good overall base recipe that I will use again!

This is a wonderful side.   Colorful, satisfying.  Several of my friends asked for the recipe.  I doubled the dressing as suggested by other reviewers and ended up using 1.5 times the dressing.  One thing for sure is that it needs salt.  I recommend salting the couscous to taste  and the other ingredients to taste before mixing together.   It's a keeper.

I've made this at least 5x, and I love it every time! Like other reviewers, I only use 1 can of black beans. I also use just a little more of the dressing by overflowing each TB or tsp measurement . Very versatile - could add avocado, or cucumber. Great warm or cold. Perfect!

I have to admit that I didn't use couscous because I didn't have any ... subbed pearl barley but I don't think it changes this salad significantly to not give it a 5 star rating. Other than the barley, I made the salad exactly as stated. I served it with Cumin Rubbed Chicken with Avocado Salsa ... great combination for a summer's evening.

This was alright but I don't know if it is because I used whole wheat couscous or if it was something else, but I was not a fan of this recipe. It was ok, but my husband disliked it very much.

Simple and delicious vegetarian meal when vegetable broth is used in place of chicken. As someone else noted, more cumin bumped the flavor a little. I left out the green peppers because I don't like them.

Very easy and delicious!  I used balsamic vinegar as it was all I had on hand and only one can of black beans (I think 2 cans would have been way too many).  I rinsed the black beans well to avoid a "dirty" look in the finished dish, too.  This was a great recipe and very versatile.  It would be easy to substitute ingredients...maybe garden vegetables and feta next time?

This was allright. Without a doubt, I prefer Jodi T's corn and black bean salad MUCH better. Although I enjoy couscous, I felt it (and the 2 cans worth of black beans) overpowered everything else in this dish. Both absorbed the dressing to the point that I could not detect it at all. I like the concept, but serious tweaking is in order if I am ever going to make this again. An obvious (and necessary) change is to reduce the beans by HALF and DOUBLE the dressing. Additionally, I recommend eating this LUKEWARM. After refrigerating overnight, the couscous lost quite a bit of moisture and was crumbly as a result. :( Another thing to note is that this makes a TON (FYI, this would be perfect for a potluck). Served alongside chicken breasts marinated in Italian dressing, this made for a light yet filling summer meal. Thanks anyways, Paula. :-)

Wow, wow, wow...  This salad is delicious!  It actually tastes even better two days later!  It did feel a tad dry on day one, but seems like everything blended together quite nicely as it sat in the fridge.  I will probably make more dressing next time, otherwise the recipe is amazing.

This is excellent. I wish I could give 6 stars. I have never had couscous in my life and was looking to try something new. If you love loads of flavor, you have to try this. So easy to throw together! I didn't have any red bell pepper, just orange, and the only corn I had was creamed corn...I know, I know...but it turned out GREAT! You would never know by looking at it that it is such a moist, flavorful salad. Great as a side, but I served it with a salad as the main dish and got rave reviews. My husband is a carnivore and didn't even notice that there was no meat on the table. He isn't into "girly" dishes like this, but he ate two helpings and said that this is the best thing I have made in recent memory. I'll be keeping this posted on the fridge and make it a summer staple. Thanks!

Loved it!  I kept the dressing ratio the same but used Israeli Cous Cous (the big pearl kind).  I thought the bigger pearls were nice for the texture!

This was delicious and easy to make!  I bring it to lunch with me almost every day!  I would definitely add a little more cumin and perhaps some cayenne or red pepper flakes just to give it a little more of a kick.  But this recipes is definitely a keeper!

This one goes in the all time favorite category with a few tweaks.  I halved the black beans(rinsed and drained)and onions, doubled the cumin and tripled the red wine vinegar.  Served with grilled Greek chicken and a glass of Shiraz. Heavenly. Substituting Quinoa for the couscous sounds like a great idea too.

Yummy!  Definitely double the dressing and drain and rinse the beans!  I had corn on the cob left over so I used one ear and cut off the kernels.  Very filling and can't wait to make for my boyfriend's mom because she's vegetarian - she'll love it I'm sure!

This is a great, fresh tasting salad that is super healthy. I love black beans so the two cans was great for me - same with the 8 green onions. I also doubled the dressing. This is very similar to a recipe I use with quinoa, which also has ground red pepper added to it. I think that would taste great in this salad as well if you like heat.

5 stars for being SO easy and quick yet still tasting gourmet.  I left out the corn and bell pepper (didn't have any), used red onion instead of green (all I had), and used a bit more vinegar.  Be sure to rinse the beans so that your couscous doesn't look gray!

I never had couscous until I tried this recipe.  It is a great side dish when we make Jerk Chicken.  I do put a bit less green onions but otherwise I put everything in the recipe.  Love it cold and warm!!  Excellent.

I liked this and was glad to have a new side dish.  I thought one can of beans was enough and next time would cut the onions back to one or out completely.  I put the 8 it called for and ended up going back and picking them out as they were entirely too strong.  Good base recipe you can modify to your own taste.

YUM. This will be my salad for the week to eat. I didn't change a thing. My couscous was wheat couscous. Very healthy, very good!

This recipe is not only great as written, it is great to play around with as well.  I have made this a few times, and typically add a diced tomato.  It makes a lot, so we usually have plenty leftover.  I also like to dip a bit into a bowl and add salsa, sour cream and cheese for nachos.  Thanks for sharing!

We love this! I only used one can of black beans and it seemed like a good amount. I sometimes add in diced grilled chicken for a light dinner.

Well I thought all the ingredients sounded amazing...but upon making it, I thought that it came out really bland. I thought that the ratio of couscous to beans and corn was way off. Needed less couscous and their was only a hint of the vinaigrette and I would have liked more. My husband also asked me if I would be offended if he didn't finish it. :(

Absolutely delicious. I substituted Italian parsley for the cilantro, as my daughter will not even look at anything with cilantro in it. It was delicious. This recipe makes a large amount, so luckily I have leftovers for lunches this week. A great vegetarian main course and a side dish for those who must have meat in their meals. Thanks!

I too changed it around abit but I think this is one of those recipes you can play with & add what you like.  I just got done making it for a camping trip this weekend & it is yummy! I cooked the whole box (3 cups) of couscous & used 4 cups of chicken broth. I added everything else to what I thought would be good...added kalamatas, crumbled feta, diced tomatoes, diced cucumber, finely chopped cilantro & dill & chopped green onion. It is really flavorful & am hoping will be a great addition to our camping meals this weekend.

Fantastic Summer salad.  I did add more ingredients than what is listed though; Kalamata olives, orange bell pepper, seeded Persian cucumber and more lime juice and Cumin than what it called for.  Bringing it to a Memorial Day picnic and I think it will be a big hit.  Oh yes, I didn't have all black beans so I added 1 can of black, 1 of northern white beans and 1 can of light kidney beans.  I altered the recipe for 12 people to accommodate a larger crowd as well.  Wonderful flavors!!

Addictive.  I was asked for this recipe over and over.  I used only 1 can of beans and doubled the dressing (except I didn't really double the oil).  I'm planning to make this many times this summer to pack for lunches.  Great with a bit of leftover chicken.

This was outstanding. Low calorie, healthy and filling. I used grilled frozen corn from a local store (Trader Joe's).  Variations to the base recipe: chopped jalapenos, sliced mango, slice avocado.

I love this recipe, and I make this often during the summer.  However my sister and I recently decided this recipe is missing something, but we don't know what that is.  We've done several variations of this recipe, doing everything from adding a generous splash of Italian dressing (which made the salad a little oily) to quadrupling the cilantro (which is actually very good, but doesn't fix the problem).  We are still searching for the missing ingredient.  If anyone has any ideas, let me know!

An excellent healthy and easy to make recipe! Have made it several times now for family and to donate as a dish for local events. I double the dressing (because it's so tasty) and use half the beans (when I only have 1 can on hand). A great side dish with any meal -

Made as written except half the onions & one can of black beans. I enjoyed this salad a lot. However, I keep forgetting that I'm the only one in the family that likes couscous - so no one else would eat it (husband & kids 15,14,& 12) and they like most everything!

This was very good. The only ting was that the dressing wasn't that flavorful so I had to double the cumin. I also substituted quinoa and added three medium chopped tomatoes. If you want to find another great recipe that uses a lot of the same ingredients check out the lentil/black bean salad- it goes good on the weekly menu to use up the fresh cilantro and frozen corn in this recipe. Next time I will add a can of sliced black olives as suggested for a somewhat meatier taste. Definitely a keeper and one to play around with.

This recipe is amazingly delicious. Even my 3 yr old and 5 yr old kids devour it. I double the dressing. Also you can substitute quinoa or millet for the couscous; although it changes the texture somewhat, the flavor is still excellent. Very forgiving recipe. I've substituted diced onions for the green onions and it is still just as good.

There's a local restaurant that sometimes has a similar salad on the menu that i love.  I found this recipe and tried it and it's very similar.  I increased the amount of lime juice because I like a little tang but otherwise, this is perfect as is.

This is great and super easy.  I did as others suggested and doubled the dressing.  I used lemon juice instead of lime.  Also, I omitted the red bell pepper and the cilantro since we don't care for those.  I also used canned white corn instead of frozen.  I made it the night before and the flavors just get better the longer it sits in the fridge.

this was a great use for leftover couscous, and was super easy to put together. i had to go with a 3, though, because it didn't Wow me... it was tasty, but you can't really go wrong with any combination of these ingredients! i gave it a little more pep with some garlic, more lime juice and some chili powder. still- good base recipe- i may try some different additions in the future (roasted chiles?) to spice it up.

My 11-year-old wanted to try couscous. We found this recipe and tried it and have eaten it every week or two for several months. It's great to have a healthy and inexpensive recipe that the whole family loves.

Great recipe!!! I used a green pepper and red onion, added a little extra EVOO and lime juice, one can of black beans, and a can of mixed white & yellow corn. I put chicken bouillion cubes in the water to cook the couscous for added flavor but then left out the salt. It's great warm or cold!

Really great recipe and so easy to make! The only thing I changed was the seasoning. I used Garam Masala instead of just Cumin. I will use more seasoning next time as I found it just a little bland.

I followed the recipe exactly but doubled the dressing with the exception of the oil.  This had just an okay flavor for me.  I did end up serving with feta cheese on top and drissling with some balsalmic vinegar and it was quite good after those additions.

This was good and would be a nice side dish for a mexican meal, I always have a hard time coming up with side dishes for mexican meals.  I only used 1 can of black beans, used a green pepper instead of red, and didn't use the green onions and I doubled the dressing.  Will make again.

This is a terrific salad.  It is so fresh.  I made a few modifications for our taste:  4 tblsp olive oil; juice of one lime; 4 tsp of red wine vinegar; 1 tsp of cumin and 7 dashes of Mexican Hot Sauce.

Delicious! I added some toasted pine nuts for some nutty crunch and it worked for us. I agree that the dressing should be doubled because it is a bit dry as written.

I used canned corn and dried cilantro as that was what I had on hand.

I think this salad is amazing.  I changed it just a little.  I used a whole red and yellow pepper, about 1/4 of a red onion, and about double the cilantro.  Oh, I also used tri-color couscous.  I could eat this salad every day.  I especially love it, because I am doing weight watcers, and its like 6 points for the ENTIRE recipe.  So yummy and healthy.

This recipe is amazing and so simple!  I like to add a few ingredients like roasted red peppers, black olives, feta cheese and a little corriander.  I recieve many compliments when I make this dish.  We also throw some grilled chicken on top, marinated in mojo.

This was a hit at my fiance's birthday party.  We have several vegetarians in our group and I made this dish for them in addition to veggie burgers and everyone ended up eating it at the party.  The flavors are very balanced and the dressing (I made a double recipe of that) really gave the couscous flavor and texture.  I hate dry couscous dishes and this was NOT one of them!

I just made this and it turned out GREAT! Per other's recommendations, I doubled the sauce except for the oil and it coated it very well.

I put the salad into containers for the fridge, as it's for our picnic tonight - but rather than fill up all the bowls, I saved some to eat right now for lunch because it was surprisingly good!

Thanks for the recipe!!

Good, with small changes:

1-yes, double the dressing.
2-I don't like the overpowering green onions, so I eliminate them.
3-I add crumbled feta cheese once it's cool.  Yum!

This was perfect, especially for summer! I made the dish per the recipe but did add a tad more of the Olive Oil dressing. It's great for a potluck and one I'll make over and over.

Great, easy recipe! Plus, it's naturally pretty for presentation and appeal. 

My variations: One red, one yellow pepper. One can rinsed black and one can rinsed pinto beans. Whole wheat couscous (definitely still soaks up the delicious flavors). 1/2 - 1 teaspoon Chili Powder for a slight kick!

Yumm.

A very healthy and great-tasting recipe that I'm looking forward to making again.  It's the first time that I've had a couscous recipe that didn't taste dry.  Would make a great picnic or BBQ dish for a crowd!  (I'd at least double it for a crowd, though.)

This was a tasty, light dinner.  I didn't have Couscous on hand so I used jasmine rice instead.  I also added pinto beans in addition to the black beans.  It was great.

Very good and healthy salad.  I double the indgredients in the dressing like many others.  Also I used 1/2 of a green pepper in place of the red since that is what I had and I think that was plenty of pepper for my tastes.  I also cooked the couscous in vegetable broth so my vegan daughter would be able to eat it.  Just finished and I am not sure what it will be liked after sitting but I am loving it now and I know the vegan will too!

Tasted awesome. I used a can of black beans and a can of chick peas. I thought I could omit the cumin because I didn't have any on hand but I did end up getting some and it makes a WORLD of difference in taste!! I also added extra cilantro and some extra salt and pepper to taste. Will definitely make this again and again.

Great salad!  I made it a little different.  I ommitted the corn and added a can of lima beans, 1/2 cup chopped black olives, a red onion instead of green, and parsley and a dash of mint instead of fresh cilantro (didn't have any).  It came out great.  I think this is a great base couscous salad and would go well with almost anything you wanted to add in.

I made this to go with enchiladas last week; absolutely loved the flavor from the cilantro, but it seemed a little dry overall to me. I will definitely try it again, and maybe double the dressing and add some extra seasonings to give it a little more flavor in addition to the cilantro. I added some tomatoes to give it a little moisture, and I think salsa would add a lot too. Great base recipe!

Awesome, easy, filling, and healthy. I used white wine vinegar, lemon, and dill as substitutes for the red wine vinegar, lime, and cilantro. I think this took away from the Southwestern sort of taste of the recipe, but it was still great. It seems like a recipe you can play with a lot without messing it up.

This is one of my most favorite recipes that I've made for years! Definitely make sure you rinse the black beans so you don't end up with it looking like "slop". I also add cherry tomatoes sliced in half and sprinkle it with crumbled goat cheese. I've sometimes made this without the couscous, excellent either way! Sooooo yummy!!!

This salad has quickly become a favorite at our house.  All who try it seem to enjoy it too-- including my picky 6 year-old!

The only changes I've made are to increase the dressing quantity to yield approx. 1 C. and I ALWAYS double the batch since it's gone so fast!

This was an excellent salad that kept well for leftovers! I followed the directions except adding veggie stock instead of chicken, and adding small cubes of cheddar cheese to the salad. The lime juice and cumin really added nice flavor to the salad and gave it a fresh taste. We will make this again.

Yum - pretty good salad! I added cherry tomatoes and cucumber to beef this up a bit. Definately recommend doubling the dressing. I used balsamic for a stronger flavour and next time will omit the oil. Used mixed beans. I didn't use green onions, but replaced this with a clove of garlic. I also used parlsey instead of cilantro (I've never heard of this). Will definately make this one again. Thanks!

Fantastic fail-proof recipe! This was just so easy to make, and the taste was perfect. The second time around I added some chili powder and it was great. We used it to  wrap in corn tortillas and also with chips. Absolutely wonderful! SAVE!!!

Absolutely delicious and so colorful, & healthy. I use whatever color pepper I have on hand. Make a little more dressing to be sure to coat well. Makes ALOT, so good to feed a big crowd. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a family gathering and it received mixed reviews. Those of us who like cilantro, loved this dish and raved about it. Those who don't like cilantro--well, they're just crazy anyway! This has a very light and refreshing taste, so it's great served on a hot day. Tastes even better the next day when the flavors have had time to develop and mingle. I noticed several family members eating it with tortilla chips, like a dip.

I thought this recipe was fabulous and I didn't change a thing!  I always rinse beans when they come from a can  so I didn't have any discoloration.  It was very pretty AND tasty.  This one was  printed and put in the recipe box!

This is fantastic. I am always looking for some different summer side ideas without mayo or dressing. I found this delightfully filling and quite refeshing. I only used one can of black beans and I thought that was enough.

We make this salad regularly.  Occasionally I will add shredded chicken in order to make it a main dish.  We usually leave out the peppers and green onions, only because we don't usually have them on hand.  However, even without them, this salad is phenomenal, and I love that it's so healthy.  You can decrease the oil slightly if you're afraid of fat grams.  I endorse this recipe heartily.

Recipe was a good starter, but lacked a few of the necessary ingredents to make this a great dish. Yes, double the dressing and add a little ginger, double the cumin (3 tsps.), garlic and a few leaves of cilantro... balsamic is also a good ungrade. Also, before you go and add the dressing to the couscous and veggies and beans- taste it!  Sometimes it seems the chefs on here are afraid to get proactive!

This salad is excellent and I have made it several times. I do double the dressing because I like more flavor.  Delicious and very healthy!

This is a great recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and made a bit more dressing. I leave out the peppers as a matter of personal preference. I've also made this with garbanzo beans/chick peas and it's equally delicious.

I have made this salad twice now and I love it.  I usually leave out the cilantro because I don't like the flavor but it's still good with it in there.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a little bit of a change in their normal routine.

This was a good healthy recipe, but IMHO it makes WAAAY more than 8 servings (probably closer to 10 or maybe even 12) as a side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the cilantro; I didn't add any because we don't like it.  In the end, we couldn't taste the 'dressing' which was on the salad, the only flavour were the beans and vegetables.  On a side note....make sure you rinse your black beans, otherwise you'll end up with a very salty salad!

Very tasty.  However the dressing definetly needs to be doubled.  I did that and it wasn't dry.  I ended up having some leftover and warmed it up the next day as a side dish with dinner.  That was good also.

My first time with couscous, and I loved this recipe. So did my picky-about-veggies family. 
I did use more vinegar, lime and cilantro than called for. Also added garlic powder. I only used 1 can of beans as recommended by others, and it was fine like that. I am a veggie lover so more veggies or beans would have also been fine with me. 
I served this with some simple spiced up & sauteed chicken breast. 
Thanks for this recipe, it was great!

I thought it was good and healthful, but a little bland.  Maybe I needed to add a little more S & P to it.  Overall, I liked it and would make it again.

Yummy!   I used tri-color couscous (carrot, spinach and regular couscous) cuz that's what I had on hand, and an orange pepper rather than a red one.  I used only 4 green onions, including the whites of the onions.  Finally, I used one 19.5 oz can of black beans, and added one chopped Roma tomato.   The color of this dish is be beautiful!   And it's delicious, too.  Thank you!

This is a really good and simple dish that would go with almost anything.
Unfortunately I only had lemon instead of lime and no cilantro. I will definately make it again with the called for ingredients.

I served this at a Recipe Exchange and it was very well received - I also used just 1 can of beans & doubled the dressing as suggested, used half a red/half an orange pepper for color, an entire bunch of cilantro, plus added some jalapeno juice to kick it up a notch. I love how packed w/veggies this is!

I made this last night and was not very satisfied with the results.  I cut everything in half so I'm wondering if that was the problem.  My husband said he liked it though.  I took three or four bites and the rest was trash. Sorry:(

For a healthier whole grain alternative to couscous try using millet. It has the same texture and consistency as couscous. Fantastic recipe otherwise!! And yes, double the dressing recipe.

YUM!  What a delicious AND healthy salad!  I seeded and diced a cucumber and substituted it for the red pepper and also left out the cilantro and the salad was perfect.  I think using fresh lime juice also makes a difference.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is a great recipe for church pot lucks and picnics.  I have made it for 50 and it comes out wonderfully! I halved the beans and doubled the dressing and always get requests for the recipe.

Excellent!!  I couldn't find couscous, so I used rotini.  I also doubled the amount of "dressing" and used about 4 green onions.  I let it sit in the fridge for a bit so the rotini could soak up the flavor.  My picky husband *loved* this!  Thanks!

This is a hit.  Definitely, cut back on the green onions.  And I added olives and fresh tomatoes.  It's one of my favorites now!
