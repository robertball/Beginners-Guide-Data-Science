Made this for work, and they gobbled it up.  Really liked the addition of the key lime juice and sour cream.  This recipe comes together very quickly, and disappears just as quickly.  Thanks Caty24 for sharing.

Very nice! I liked the slightly 'different' flavor from the key lime juice (used a bit more than called for), and the creaminess from the sour cream was a nice addition. Great variation on one of my favorite dips! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this for Cinco de Mayo and the whole family loved it!  Asked me to make it again already.
