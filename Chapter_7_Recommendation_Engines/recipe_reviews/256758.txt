I changed this up a bit due to personal preference. We are not huge fans of cooked bell pepper and not only are scotch bonnets nearly impossible to find this time of year, they are just way too hot for us. So to kill two birds with one stone, I used a fresh jalapeno to replace the bell and also to add heat we are able to tolerate. It worked like a charm. This was good but I made two different cabbage recipes last night and the other came in favored due to one thing. Beer. Loved the heat in this one but I highly recommend replacing the water in this recipe for beer. It adds SO much flavor and really compliments the cabbage. Pre-shredded cabbage in a bag works fine and saves time but you'll want to reduce the cook time. This is one I will make again but with beer.
