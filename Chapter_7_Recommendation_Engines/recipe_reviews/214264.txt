VERY EASY!! And very good, but I did make changes. I made them in a cupcake tin, and instead of coconut macaroons I used graham crackers, and unlike traditional graham cracker crusts I left out the sugar because it can make the crust a little gritty in texture. I also used reduced fat cream cheese, and since I don't have anything fine enough to remove zest I just used the juice from a large lemon. They turned out GREAT and they're still warm. The only problem I found is that they crack very easily and if I was to serve them at any sort of even I would make a strawberry topping to hide the cracks.

The flavor was good. I did not have lemon zest but I did add 1/2 tsp of pure lemon extract and I'm happy I did. Our crust fell apart which was also fine but I'm not sure we let our cream cheese get warm enough because the finish product was a little lumpy and a bit too cream cheese tasting. Not the best but not the worse I've made. It was easy and quick.
