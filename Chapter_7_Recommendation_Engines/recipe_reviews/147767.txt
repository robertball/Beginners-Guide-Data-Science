I made the recipe exactly as is, it came out great!  I wouldn't make it as a main dish, but a side to a fish (tuna/salmon).  My honey loved it, too!  Defintely great for company.

My fiance made this for me last night and it was fantastic! I'm sure it would have been great as is, but he added some frozen corn and peas, fresh garlic, and some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. He doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers and it made so, so much. This is a keeper.

Yummy!  My husband loved this.  Something different with edamame.  One time I made it I didn't have goats cheese and used feta & it was still great.  Made it exactly as stated.

We're not big fans of edamame, but my husband and I tried this and it was delicious! If you have a lot of time for stirring, than this is a great side dish to make. Thanks!

This was very good!  I've never had edamame before, and I was impressed.  This made more than two servings for sure, and it really would be best as a side dish rather than a main course.  I'm impressed!

I used fresh ginger and basil, and blue cheese instead of goat cheese.  Didn't have white wine, so I used cooking sherry, and it was delicious.  I would like to try it with gargonzola next time.  I was nervous about it being to liquidy so I added a little bit at a time.  Ended up using 3.75 cups and should have gone all the way to 4.  Once I added the cheese it got a little too dry.  Almost forgot the salt and pepper so the first few bites weren't great.  After adding them it great! Kids too!

Not sure why everyone loved this. Also, 4 cups of water was to much, I used 3 and it was still runny. I love risotto and edamame...but will not be making this again.

The basil was too overpowering.  I'll make it again without.

I made this recipe for my monthly cook club.  It was a hit and will definitely add to my permanent collection!  It is very tasty - I garnished each serving with three spears of asparagus sticking out of it and coated it with fresh grated parmesan cheese.
