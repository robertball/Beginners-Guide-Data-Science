Delicious and beautiful cookies! The combination of lemon and raspberry is wonderful. To make assembly easier, sprinkle powdered sugar on the top cookies before assembling. Then you won't need to add more preserves in the opening.

I have had this recipe for over 20 years.  It is one of the best.  I wonder if the cookies could be made in advance and frozen.  Thawed later and then the constructed?

We panicked when  out grandmothers recipie was lost.  This is the exact same one she use to make!   A holiday favorite!  She always doubled the lemon and added a bit of the juice.
