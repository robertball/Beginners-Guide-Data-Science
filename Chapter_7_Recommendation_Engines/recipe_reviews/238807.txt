Can't go wrong with any of Chef John"s recipes! This is delicious the next day. I made one change and that was to add a chopped carrot in with the onions. Just do it all in your dutch oven on the stovetop, no need to use a skillet too. Keep the great recipes coming Chef John;-)

I sort of combo'd this recipe with Chef John's Sherry Braised Beef Short Ribs and the dish came out AMAZING!   I was not able to find bone in beef ribs in any of 4 local grocery stores.    I settled on a 2 pound package of boneless ribs. Following Chef John's recommendation on the Sherry ribs, I browned them very well in some bacon fat.  I  drained and reserved the bacon, then set the ribs aside to drain on some paper towels.  I diced 2 medium onions and sauteed them with some minced garlic.  I added the 2 TBSP flour called for in the Sherry recipe as well as the bay leaf, cayenne  and rosemary from the mushroom recipe.  I de-glazed the pan with about a cup of port rather than the sherry.  Followed that with about 2 cups of beef broth and a can (14 oz) of tomato puree.  I added back the bacon and ribs and brought to a low boil. Rather than putting in the oven, I simmered on top of the stove in a cast iron dutch  oven with a tight lid for around 2- 2 1/2 hours.  I let it cool down and refrigerated over night.  The next day, I skimmed the fat that had solidified then simmered for another 2 hours or so on the stove.  I left the pot only about half covered to let the sauce reduce.  Served with mashed potatoes and butter braised brussels sprouts.   It was SOOOO good!   Since there are only 2 of us, we had plenty of lefties.  Even better left over with some candied carrots and white rice!

This is a very nice and simple braised short rib recipe. Chef John is correct when he advised chilling and then serving the next dsy to develop flavor. The only problem I had was the braising time. After two hours my short ribs were still a bit tough. I braised them for two more hours (total of four hours) to get a much more tender result. Thanks Chef John!

Like all Chef John's recipes, this one is a winner. I've made this several times to rave reviews by guests.  I use boneless short ribs and trim a bit of fat, but not all, from them.  He says any tomato product works for the sauce, but using  San Marzano crushed tomatoes from Italy adds a wonderful depth of flavor.  Straining the porcini liquid through a coffee filter  prevents any grit in the mix. Served over mashed potatoes or polenta is a must for these.  Baby green peas as a side dish completes the presentation.

This was the bomb! The only spice I added in addition to what was listed in the recipe was a teaspoon of smoked paprika. I agree to cook the day before, grease rose to the top of the dish and then easily removed. Reheat in low oven. Will make again and again, melt in your mouth delish!

Chef John doesn't disappoint with this excellent  yet simple recipe. I added some fresh shiitake mushrooms to the porcini since my wife and I are mushroom lovers. Served over soft polenta with some butter and mixed Italian cheeses. Wonderful dish!

Delicious! Fresh sliced white mushrooms worked okay. Also in bottom of Dutch oven I placed a layer of lightly saut√©ed, chopped small, carrot and celery. I glazed the pan with a little red wine. Placed meat, then sauce, as directions indicated, in the pan. Definitely a keeper.

SO GOOD!! I will make this regularly!! I served the short ribs and ragu over polenta; it was fabulous!!  Equally as good (if not better because it was homemade!!) as the short ribs over polenta at Lugo's!!

This recipe is a definite keeper.  I only had white mushrooms at the time I made the recipe, and did add carrots as other reviewers suggested.  My grandsons, who aren't really beef fans, liked it too.  Better the next day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The best short rib recipe out there.  So easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to double the garlic.  Made for a dinner party and it was a big hit!  Will  be part of our regular recipes.  Highly recommend!!

Amazing as usual. I layered the bottom of the Dutch oven with sliced carrots and green beans and they added an effortless and flavorful side dish. I also threw in a little sherry and a few thyme sprigs from Chef John's other braised short rib recipe. Next time I will add even more veggies to the bottom because they were that good, and there was still more than enough sauce to go around.

I couldn't decide between this recipe and Chef John's Sherry Braised Short Ribs, so I made this recipe as is, except I only added 1 1/2 cups beef broth and substituted 1/2 cup wine and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. I was trying to recreate a dish I had at a very popular Italian restaurant and this came pretty close. I used boneless rib "fingers" which my supermarket sells and which seemed to suit this dish very well, the meat was very tender. I added a handful of carrots cut into spears and two handfuls cherry tomatoes in the last 20-30 minutes of the cooking time and used these to decorate the plates. I served it with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from the site, which was an amazing compliment. I will try to post a picture. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This was delicious and so easy to make.  I increased the mushrooms and water to 1 1/2 cups each. Next time, I might even add more mushrooms.  Because I added more mushrooms/water, I also increased my tomato sauce (homemade which was frozen) to about 2 cups, which I wish I wouldn't have done--a little too acidic.  Next time I might use beef stock and a little more of it, especially if i increase the mushrooms.  I also cooked it longer, about 4.5 hours, to get it to fall apart easier.  I put it over polenta and added some fresh grated parmesan.

I followed the recipe but I added a splash of  red wine for the final simmer. I served with mashed potatoes.  We loved it and will definitely add to my recipe repertoire.

My girl usually doesn't like mushrooms so my boy and I made this one night she was out town.  She thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers the next night however so we'll probably do it again next week.  I got some dried mushrooms from a friend and need to use them before I lose them.  Allow me to recommend however to make sure whatever pan you use to brown the ribs is plenty heavy and hot before you introduce the ribs.  I hope to have more fond the next time around.

Ok, Oh. My. Goodness!!!  This is amazing!!  I followed the recipe except that I added a small diced carrot in with the onions, deglazed the pan with 1/3 C Cabernet Sauvignon and cooked for 4 minutes to evaporate the alcohol and then followed with the mushroom water, then added 1.5 tsp worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp of tomato paste and used 8oz of crushed San Marzano tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and beef stock instead of broth.  This is the first time I have made shortribs and it was as delicious as the shortrib ragu I got at a high-end authentic Italian restaurant in Chicago.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks Chef John!  You rock!!!

Good, not great. Found the recipe a bit bland, despite use of one of our favorites - Porcini mushrooms. May try the Sherry Braised next time out - or a hybrid as many of the earlier reviewers mentioned..

This was delicious, easy to make!  I served it over mashed potatoes.  Perfect comfort food on a blustery day.

This is an amazing recipe! We always follow the recipe exactly the first time we try it, then if we like it we might make some adjustments. The aroma was wonderful. The meat was so tender it fell off the bones. It is a fantastic recipe....doesn't need any adjustments!

This recipe is very good. I only missed the fact that I did not have tomato sauce at hand, but I replaced it by about 1Tbsp of tomato paste and a tomato bouillon. It ended up a bit salty but it was so very good! Will make it again. If I have to make this recipe using bouillon, I would not use salt at all and would rectify it at the end instead. Also, I did not have enough of the mushrooms so as someone did, I used some white mushrooms to make up for the rest I needed. It was just perfect. I let it cool of a bit to easily remove the extra grease that collects on top. I served over some mashed potatoes but I can totally see this served on top of saffron risotto just like you do with osso bucco.

Excellent! Simple and delicious. I tweaked it a bit with more garlic, chopped carrots added to the onions and mushrooms. My guests loved it as well, thank you! Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very tasty and simple to make. Used white mushrooms chopped finely and cup of jar pasta sauce I already had opened. Will make again when short ribs are on sale.

Huge hit! Delish layers of flavors and aromas. My sauce wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but that didn't diminish  the dish in any way.  I enjoyed the whole process as well as it was a really fun recipe to follow.  I was super excited when the meat fell off the bones. I will be making this again for sure.

I would suggest reducing the beef stock to 1  1/4  cups so it is more relish like ..mine was a bit watery but delicious ... I also prepared the polenta with Parmesan cheese and cream, cracked pepper... the braised carrots with maple syrup ...the combination was outstanding

This was excellent! Dimensional flavor. I used just 1 pound of beef short ribs and did not decrease the amount of liquid.  Much of it cooked down so it was a good amount to go over baked potatoes. Had enough for 4 servings. Also, used fresh mushrooms, added carrots and celery to onion and saut√©ed them together.  One important note for next time: do not add salt to mixture. The salt content in the beef stock was plenty.
