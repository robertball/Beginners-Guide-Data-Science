I'm not a big meat-cooker but my boyfriend is a big meat -eater so I made this for Valentines dinner and he was impressed! I was impressed at how easy it was to make! I'll definetely make this again! I used canned tomatoes instead of tomatoe juice and it made it nice and chunky.

I used this recipe as an outline. I added green and red pepper,  a little bit of cayenne and garlic clove. It turned  out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make, just cut of veggies and meat, make the broth part, combine all in a pot and cook for 5 hours and forget about it!  The end result is worth waiting for.

I cook lunch for 30 people everyday. This recipe was quick and easy!!! Which makes my job easy. You can't please everyone, but noone complained, they said it was different than any other chili they had, and enjoyed it. You need a little hot sauce though, if you like it spicy. I also added a bell pepper and let it simmer for an hour to make it tender.

Quick and easy.  I am always interested in new chili recipes because I'm trying to find one that my family will like.  Mission accomplished!  My 8 year old son asked for a second helping.  I used canned beef chunks instead of prepared stew, I think that was the ingredient that closed the deal!  Thanks.

This was a rather odd chili, but good-tasting.  I wasn't sure of the purpose of the beef stew, nor the brand/kind so I added one large can of Dinty Moore.  I also substituted V8 for the tomato juice, but put half of the amount called for (one 11-oz can), as I like my chili thicker.  It was ready in the 30 minutes that my cornbread took!

VERY simple... this was my first attempt at chili, and i wasn't totally faithful to every element of it...but using the premade stew totally worked...

I'd suggest getting a saltier stew or using alot of seasoning on the ground beef, the spiciness was easy to get but i thought i could have flavored the meat more...

awesome recipe, will definately try again, thanks !

I made this for my family and we loved it.  I suggest that you make this for a large group.  It makes a lot and it is very filling.  I will definitely make this again.

Recipe wasn't bad but there is no way you would use a 64 oz. bottle of tomato juice. I used a 46 oz. can and it was good and juicy.

I made some modifications for personal preferences and it came out great, and well-reviewed by whole family!  Excluded the beef stew and tomato juice and added a beef oxo cube and two cans of tomato juice. Used cans of black and kidney beans instead of chili, and reduced chili powder to 1/4 teaspoon to reduce the spiciness.  yumm!

Used a little less tomato juice then called for - it quickly went into the "stoup" category, which was yummy but not a traditional "thick" chili. I liked the base flavor of this, just tweak chili powder / salt / pepper to taste.
