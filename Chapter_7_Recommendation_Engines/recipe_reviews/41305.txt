I've had this recipe for a few years.. But I don't add the mustard..I use 2 parts chile sauce to 1 part grape jelly. Then I squeeze in about 1/2 a lemon...cook the sauce for a bit to blend the ingredients then add the meatballs and cook for about an hour...Try it you'll love it

The sauce for these meatballs is what really set them apart.  The sweet and sour compliment one another well.  I like to make my meatballs from scratch but pre-made one work just as good...and is much quicker!!  Thanks again TOH.

I added about a half cup of brown sugar and some crushed pineapple. We had a luau themed party. They were fantastic and very easy!

These were great and I have to give it 5 stars because it was easy AND delicious. I was looking for a meatball recipe for a party and just had to try this grape jelly and chilli sauce thing--it just sounded so weird. But these were so good! Everyone at the party gobbled them up. This will be my go-to cocktail meatball recipe from now on. Thanks!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe...it went over really well at a group party.  I tripled the recipe and put it in a crock pot on low for the evening.  I didn't use the full amount of chili sauce.  Next time I make this I won't cook the meatballs in soy sauce, they seemed too salty.  I think the sauce itself brings enough flavor to the meatballs.

This recipe was really good!  I gave it a 4 stars because my husband thought it was a 3 and I thought it was a 5, so I averaged out.  The only reason why he thought it was a 3 was because he wished it was less sweet and more spicy - he likes 5 alarm chili type of spicy.


I thought it had an EXCELLENT sassy and bold flavor.  Thanks for this recipe, it will definitely stay in our cooking repertoire.

I didn't get a chance to try these, my husband took them to an x-mas party.  I made way more because I expected leftovers.  There were no leftovers, everyone loved them.  I prepared them the night before and slow cooked on high for 2 hours.  They were re-heated on high for about 2 hours the next day.  I would recommend preparing ahead to mellow the flavor a bit because my eye's watered when I first put the ingredients in.

These were very good and easy to make.  I bought pre-cooked meatballs and just put everything in a crock pot.  Be careful when buying the chili sauce - the first time I made these the sauce I bought was extremely hot - which was not indicated on the bottle.

I made this recipe for my Halloween party and it was a huge hit! I fried the meatballs and made the sauce then put everything in my crockpot for the rest of the evening and it worked out great!

I am a big fan. These are quick/easy, you can't mess them up, and it's a great, unique flavor. We like them over yellow rice.

This was really good.  When I have another get together I am going to put some little smokies in with the meatballs and double the sauce.

Love this recipe. What a quick and easy appetizer for a party buffet table. I didn't add the full 1/4 cup of mustard and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing. YUM!

I just love the fact that you don't have to make these in the crockpot.  I have a New Year's gathering, and my husband told them I was bringing meatballs.  I didn't have enough time to do them in the crockpot, so this is a wonderful quick comprimise.
