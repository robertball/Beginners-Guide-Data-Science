Was amazing...family loved it..now going to be added  to the family tradition every Thanksgiving ! Had a great flavor and the aroma was strong of eggnog, plus the family members that hate eggnog thought it still was amazing and this recipe was easy to mix together.

No, I didn't make it, but I love Eggnog, and I'm a good judge of ingredients.  Sometime between Thanksgiving, and Christmas I'll be making this for either a family get together, or a potluck at church.  I'm sure the eggnog lovers in my family, or those at church will be surprised by the uniqueness of this pie.

The whole house smelled like eggnog while I was cooking this. A word of caution. The amount of cinnamon and nutmeg listed is way too much. It does say season to taste but I would start out with a teaspoon of each and go from there. I made it with the amounts listed and it's way too spicy.
