This really is great! I tried it with green gelatin and used my bundt cake pan, and of course it looks "just like" a Christmas wreath. Great for the holidays!

This is exactly what I was looking for- a jello salad that was sweet with a crunch. Very much like the salads I remember having at my Grandmother's and other relatives in Minnesota.
I used lime jello instead and it was great-

I was afraid that I would be unable to get this out of the mold because I didn't spray with Pam first.  It came out beautifully and was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Very easy and the nuts and celery give it a nice chewy texture.  If I did it again I think I wouldn't add  the cream.  With the cream cheese it is rich enough.  I'm sure some juice (orange or pineapple would make this lighter.  I used sugar free Jello.

Loved it. Made it without the pimento because we didn't have it on hand. Will make again.

I'm thrilled to have found this recipe because I've literally spent years looking for anyway veg or salad dish that gets more than a cursory second look on the special occasion table.   They were all scooping out seconds of this salad!  Couldn't believe my eyes!   There's no fresh pimento available where I live so I used chopped sweet red pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as stated. I don't think anyone guessed there was pineapple in it and not everyone likes pineapple.  The overall taste is a creamy-nutty-crunchy experience.  Delicious! The color ended a creamy peach.  I did make it a day ahead of time, and wonderment it came out of the mold beautifully.  This recipe is a MUST TRY!

Like others, once I saw all the ingredients I thought the jello would be too much - but it was a hit with nearly everyone at Christmas dinner.  You must love celery though!

Tasted good, not too sweet which I liked. Just wished it was healthier.
