My family has loved these cookies for years. We use 1 package butterscotch chips, 1/2 cup peanut butter and 3 cups cornflakes. You can melt it in the microwave instead of on the stovetop. Drop them by spoonfuls onto waxed paper to cool. If it's a hot day, it helps to put them in the fridge for a while.

Rich?  Yes.  Declicious?  Absolutely.  These were the first to disappear of all the cookies I made for Thanksgiving and I've been asked for the recipe twice.

I also added a drizzle of chocolate (and one of white chocolate) for both flavor and aesthetics, and used chunky peanut butter, mostly because I had it on hand but I'll be using it again; the peanuts added a nice touch.  I recommend keeping the drops small - they *are* very rich - and maybe crushing the corn flakes a little bit to help with that.  Also, if you have a food scale, weigh out the 4 cups (112g) rather than using measuring cups - my friend who cup-measured said he ended up with too few flakes and they turned out runny.

I also love this recipe but have always made it a little differently.  We called them butterscotch bonbons; we put 3 c. cornflakes, 3 c. mini marshmallows, 1 pkg. b. chips, 1 c. peanut butter.  Love it!

These were easy to make and have a good flavor mix with the peanut butter and butterscotch chips.  I took these to our cookie exchange at work and one of the ladies just flipped over them saying this was what her grandmother made her when she was little.  Brought back great memories for her.  The only downfall is you can't leave them out for too long as they get sticky, but still good choice for a quick, easy treat.

these were fantastic! and super easy - ten minutes tops.  i put them in the little truffle cups for more even distribution.. they tend to spread out if not contained. i also used the crunchy pb as the other review recommended. yummers!

Excellent tasting, very easy to make. The only thing I would mention is that the mix is slightly runny when it's mixed and you drop the blobs on the cookie sheet. I wasn't sure they were going to stick together but once cooled they came out fine. They were somewhat difficult to get off the cookie sheet though, several of them broke when I scraped them off. Maybe spraying the cookie sheet with PAM first would help? Otherwise great!

Great idea!! Although I didn't quite follow the recipe. I have never had anything like this before, and the cornflakes sounded/looked weird to me. Instead, I made the melt and then dipped bite-sized "waffle" shaped pretzles in, covering them half way. Delicious!! I did half the recipe, and it took about 10 minutes to dip ~50 pretzs.

We love these - especially my 4 year old! When I make these, I melt the mixture in the microwave and then store them in the fridge, that keeps them from sticking together. I also use extra crunchy peanut butter. I've tried both Corn Flakes and Special K haven't noticed a difference. Thanks for the great recipe!

these were just ok for me.  I prefer the combination of chocolate and peanut butter or white chocolate and peanut butter better.

This is a FABULOUS recipe! I doubled up the recipe and instead of making them "drops" I let them sit, completely mixed, in a baking pan, as you would with rice crispy treats then cut them up. They are sticky and I don't know if they were supposed to harden a lot but sooooo good! Thanks for the recipe!

Addictive, and too easy to make!  I may be making these more than I should - lol.  My husband and I didn't think these were too sweet, of course we both have a sweet tooth.  I followed the directions exactly, except also added 1 tablespoon of butter, and turned out wonderfully.  I had run out of wax paper, so had to put right on my (greased) baking pans, surprisingly, once they cooled they didn't leave a mess behind at all.  Only trickier to pop off the pan, a few break as they do, but not a big deal since just for us.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Wonderful!  thank you for recipe...quick, easy and mighty tasty.  i used organic peanut, butter which has no added sugar and it seemed to balance the richness of the butterscotch chips.

Quick and easy way to create a fun no-bake cookie for a crowd.  I used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of Corn Flakes.  Made a batch of 18 with butterscotch and another batch of 18 with chocolate chips.  All gone.

So incredibly easy!!!  Just made a batch to hold the boys over until the weekend, but I figure it will last about 2 days--if I'm lucky!  Made according to recipe except for a smidge of butter.  Maybe 1 T.

I'm giving this 3 stars because my son loved them, but they were way too rich for me.  I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled over the top to try to counter the butterscotch flavor, but it didn't help much.  I ended up throwing away half the batch. Sorry. I prefer the Peanut Butter Chews recipe from this site.

Love these!! I usually add a few peanuts in it for an even nuttier, crunchier taste.  You can also sub potato strings for cornflakes for a sweet and salty taste.  Yummmm!!!

This recipe was very good. My great-grandmother use to make these and I was glad to find the recipe. The only thing different I might do is to use butterscotch almond bark instead of the butterscotch chips. I found I had to keep them in the refrigerator or they start to melt and fall apart. Otherwise I give it a thumbs-up.

Made these just last night for my daughter's girl scout meeting.  The kids loved them and I couldn't get over how easy they were to make! I cooled them in the fridge on wax paper and they were super easy to remove.

Been making these for years, they sure don't stay around very long.  I put wax paper on the cookie sheet and then place in the fridge, when they set up no problem with sticking.  They will get stickey if left out of the cooler very long.

They are so good (and very addictive). At first when I was dropping them on the cookie sheet, it didn't seem like they were going to stay together. But they were set up and ready to eat after about 15 minutes in the fridge.

These were extremely easy to make and quite fun, but when it was time to eat them, I found them to be very, very sweet.  I doubt I'll make these again.

I have been making these for nearly 25 years.  I got the recipe from my mother who got it from a friend.  Mom made them every Christmas & now I do too.  They're my kids favorite "cookie" for the holidays--how easy is that for me?!  Everyone I've ever made them for has loved them.  The only difference with my recipe is that I use 5 cups of corn flakes.  I really don't measure the peaut butter either--I just drop it in the pan until it looks like a cup [or a little more!].  Always use creamy, & never, ever use 'natural' peanut butter! [I made that mistake once...]  Always drop onto waxed paper & let them set up & store in the fridge.

So good! And very easy to make, gave me a chance to use my new silicon dish and it popped right out. Did it as one piece like another reviewer suggested.

This is one of our old family favorites!  We use Special K cereal instead of Corn Flakes.  I've never tried the Corn Flakes but wonder if the Special K might hold up a little better-a bit thicker.  They are awesome and easy!  I find the microwave method the best!

I have made these in the past but this time I used 3 cups of uncooked oatmeal instead of the crispy rice cereal. It made it more of a granola bar. Could have used a bit of corn syrup to keep them less crumbly, but a great way to get your fiber in and some protein to boot!

Very rich, but good in small tablespoon portions. I added bran flakes, chex mix, and pretzels. You could use choc chips and add whatever crunchy thing  you wanted as well.

I use half a bag of butterscotch chips and half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup of peanut butter and 6 cups of corn flakes. I can’t imagine only using 4 cups as there’s so much melted mixture to use. My coworkers love them and I’m bringing them to my Christmas party tomorrow night. They basically taste like a scotcharoo with less work! Love it!

Yum! My preschooler and I had fun making these today. A couple substitutions: I used chunky peanut butter (didn’t have creamy) and in order to finish off a box of Special K that’s been in the pantry a while I used 2 cups of that and 2 cups of corn flakes. As I was dropping the hot spoonfuls I didn’t think the cookies would hold together, but once cooled they were fine. They lifted right off the wax paper I used. Everybody loved the cookies and the house smelled like yummy butterscotch all afternoon. A keeper!

I love these cookies, we have made these since I was a kid. I use half the amount of peanut butter otherwise that flavor just takes over a little too much for me. I always make a double recipe.  It’s much easier to use either a quarter cup measuring cup or half cup measuring cup to scoop it out and drop on the pan covered with some wax paper, then they come out perfectly, consistent, and just the right shape. Super easy, I think even easier than rice crispy bars!

Almost too easy to be true. I made the recipe just as written and the cookies were easy to make and were tasty. I am taking them to work for a cookie party. I found them to be a bit rich. I will try them next with almond butter and perhaps reduce the amount of the almond butter.  Overall, a recipe I will make again, great if in a hurry and need something fast.

Quick, easy, and delicious! We use Corn Chex sometimes add peanuts or coconut for an added twist. At Easter we shape them into little nests and put several Jellie Bellies inside.

The only thing I did different was use peanut butter chips and melted the peanut butter and chips in the microwave (30 sec twice on 50% power, stirring in between). It was done in a flash and they taste great! You can't get much easier than this. Two thumbs up.

These were so yummy and easy to make. I admit I was a little hesitant thinking it may be too sweet but the peanut butter helped mellow out some sweetness

I made this and was amazed with how easy and delicious this was. I didn't have corn flakes so I used 4 cups of honey nut cheerios and instead of making single drops I put all of the mix into a lighty greased brownie pan which I put in the fridge to cool. They came out so good. My kids love them.

So quick, easy and yummy! I used Special K since that's what I had on hand.  I also used a natural-style peanut butter which was much softer and oilier than regular peanut butter. Therefore, the cookies didn't set up as firmly as they should have.  I'm sure the peanut butter was the issue. No big deal though; my family devoured the entire batch within hours! FYI: I make another recipe that is almost identical except I use Rice Krispies. You press the cereal mixture into a greased pan, refrigerate, and then top with a tub of milk chocolate frosting. OMG!

I cut the recipe in half to make a quick dessert tonite  --  they turned out great---very easy and yummy!!!  Will make again.  I remember making them years ago with chow mein chips but I think the corn flakes are better.

Tasty and SO easy to make!  I did it a little different though.  I did it in the microwave, only added half a cup of peanut butter and three cups of corn flakes.  I can see this being a regular!

These are so good! They are super rich, I can only eat one with a big glass of milk... My girlfriend though can eat the entire batch to herself! She absolutely loves them. Instead of using corn flakes, I used rice crispy cereal. I have not tried the cornflakes, but I personally really enjoy the rice crispy cereal!

I love this recipe. It is very similar to a favorite of mine since childhood. The only difference is that we add raisins and marshmallows too.  Just add the marshmallows at the very end and they melt very little. These are fun to make with my kids too. Just microwave the chips and pb.

These are great. I will suggest two great variations as well:  *Use chow mein noodles instead of the cereal. *Use peanut butter chips for butterscotch and multigrain cherrios for corn flakes.  Both variations are great!

These are great!  Super easy!  I used natural peanut butter and honey bunches of oats (because that's what I had on hand).  They made a great and fast addition to my Christmas cookie platter.

I made these for christmas 2006, and my husband and niece still beg me to make these again, and I am not kidding.  I thought they were good (however I am not much of a sweets person), but to those who love peanut butter and butterscotch...BEWARE! These are habit forming!!!

Meh.  I really wanted to like these, but they were not good.  I used generic cornflakes; perhaps that altered the taste?  No one ate them, not even my ever-hungry sons. :(

YUM.  These are a quick, easy snack.  They taste so good straight out of the fridge!  They went over very well while we watched the football game.
