Yum!  I hate to be one of those substituters but out of necessity I had to be one.  I was trying to use up some ingredients and some I didn't have on hand.  I frozen mixed bell peppers and sauteed them and used some bread crumbs from french bread I had made and used grenadine in place of pomegranate molasses.  Sorry for all that inauthenticness.  Even so, I did own everything else and I could eat this with a spoon!  Thanks for giving me a recipe using sumac James!
