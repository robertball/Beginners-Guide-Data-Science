I enjoyed this recipe The only thing I changed I didnt use the ribs I used Pork Lion Center Chops, I sliced Them Like Ribs instead of Boiling I  Sauted the meat in olive oil, After That I dipped them in the sauce and than I baked them in the oven instead of on the grill they came out so tender and so good it was finger licking good me and husband didnt even use any napkins we were licking our fingers. The Sauce is great saved some of the sauce so I can make with some Baked chicken Breast will let you know How they come out.

I don't like ribs, but this is the most delicious food I have ever put in my mouth.  All my family agrees.

Great recipe, my family loves these.  Try them in a slow cooker, just toss it all in on low for about 6 hours, yummmmy!

very salty and tough.   sorry.     boiling pork usually makes this happen.   with some added changes this could be better.

instead of boiling the ribs i used my kitchen grill for 7 minutes then put them in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes, i took them out to add the sauce and put them back in for 20 minutes. its a bit sweet i usually do this sauce minus the honey i sub with bbq sauce but this time i wanted to try it with honey. still very good i would of put 5 stars but i dont boil the ribs it will be too tough, the way i did it they basically slide off the bone.

Tried this and really enjoyed the sauce!  Instead of boiling the ribs I put them in a covered pan with a bit of water in the oven on 400 for about 1 to 1.5 hours, until they were tender.  Then, I brushed the sauce on them and baked them for another 30 minutes.  They were very tender and very flavorful!  Will definitley make this again.
