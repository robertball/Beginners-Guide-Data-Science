Oh. My. Goodness. 

I have made these three times now, and I am ADDICTED!! So delicious, and SO simple! I have made a few adjustments... 

So I made these for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I was both catering and hosting, so I had to make them a bit more dainty. I added red and green bell peppers to the filling, and made them smaller. After prepping 48 of these bad boys,(triple recipe) I have come up with a quick and simple procedure to make these worth the effort. 

Roll each biscuit flat, then cut in half horizontally. place a piece of cheese (I used sandwich sliced Cojack from Sargento) on each half, diagonally from each other. (I do top left and bottom right) then spoon a small amount of the filling. Fold the uncovered dough over (Top piece goes right to left, bottom piece goes right to left) then crimp very well with a fork and place on baking sheet. Keep going until baking sheet is full. Then baste each picket with egg wash (I just use my finger, it's faster and easier) and then re-crimp with a fork and reshape delicately with your hands. They should look like little clams. Bake until golden brown! 

These were SUCH a hit at my party, and were the only item I served that had no left overs. I kept a couple reserved for myself, and reheated them the next day in the toaster oven, and they were just as delicious. 

Thank you for an AMAZING recipe!!! I will be using this again, and again, and again!!

I only gave this four stars based upon the fact that I used my only sloppy joe sauce recipe. The idea to enclose sloppy joe mixture in biscuit is pretty good. With this idea and my sloppy joe sauce, this recipe was a hit in my house. In the future, I think I'll include a very light sprinkling of shredded cheddar to the pocket before sealing it.

I made these for a small party I had and they were a hit!  For being so simple, they were very good.   Even my brothers, who were dubious about eating "a hamburger in a biscuit" enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe!

These weren't easy to make.  Maybe I used to much filling.  They were awkward to close.  They tasted pretty good.

My son said "home-made Hot Pockets!"  We made with Grand Buttermilk biscuits - nice sized "pockets" when rolled out.  Next time we'll add some italian seasoning and mozarella.  Very easy and nice to look at!  Incidentally, it's easy to make a Vegetarian version with Boca crumbles.

Sorry; we didn't like them.  The sloppy joe flavor didn't mesh at all with the biscuit flavor.  We wound up opening up the pockets and spooning out the meat filling to put on hotdog buns.  But even if it'd tasted all right, they probably would not have been worth the effort of rolling the dough, filling, closing, and cooking the extra fifteen minutes in the oven.  Thanks anyway.  :)

EXCELLENT!  big hit with my kids!  Yummy and fun.  I did add 1/2 slice of american cheese to each one, and next time I think I'll use cheddar for more flavor.  I baked it on the pizza stone for 10 minutes.

I just made these today using the "cook's note" directions.  It doesn't get much simpler than beef, a can of sloppy joe sauce, and a can of refrigerated biscuits.  These little pockets were awesome!  It was a great twist on the traditional sloppy joe sandwich.  I followed some of the suggestions from the previous reviews, so I also added shredded cheddar inside the pockets prior to baking.  So good!  Can't wait to make these again!

Quick, Easy, V-E-R-Y kid friendly. I'm a busy mom (what mom isn't?) , so I cheated and used sloppy joe sauce from a can. Spooned 2-3 tablespoons on each pocket with shredded cheddar cheese. I pressed my rolls out into 4 inch circles, and filled them, crimping with a fork to make "half circle" Sloppy Joe pockets.   *** Note: I thought people were crazy thinking they could cram 3 tablespoons of meat into each one...but turns out yes you can! I just wasn't stretching the dough out enough. You need to REALLY stretch it to a point where u think it's almost too thin...do not worry. the meat will hold and they'll bake up nicely. don't forget the melted butter brushed on to make them yummy and golden brown! A real family favorite right now

These are so easy! Something you can make if unexpected dinner guests show up. I suggest making them small. Ours were too big to handle but I guess that's why they are called sloppy joes.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The sauce wasn't like sloppy joe mix to me but rather like ketchup mixed with meat.  It just seem worth the effort when I could just buy some and use bread.

This recipe IS AWESOME!  If you want just regular sloppy joes on a bun, still use the recipe minus the biscuits. It is delicious and way better than the canned stuff.

Loved it! But I did alter a few things. I used my own biscuit recipe, used extra lean beef so I didn't have to drain it, swapped out the ketchup for a 6oz can of tomato paste, and used lowreys seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I sampled the meat mixture before I placed it in the dough, and it needed something more, so I added a lot of seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Also cheese! Gotta add a little mix of shedded cheeses!!! Delicious.. like a home-made hotpocket :)

These seemed to be missing something. Also, I would use crescent rolls next time to avoid such a doughy "pocket."

Very good. Very easy to make. Great flavored meat and cheese. I changed the recipe and made taco seasoned meat with salsa and cheese. My husband liked it. Very refreshing to try something new. Will definitely make again. I think the grandkids would love this recipe. Can't wait to make it again and again.

I've made these for many years. I loved the Mexican empanadas, but they didnt like me.  I made the same pies with sloppy Joes, with or with out graded cheese with frozen roll dough and most all of Pillsbury tube rolls. My family loves them hot or room temperature. 

If I  use ketchup, I add 1/8 - 1/4 cup Brown sugar  and if it is too sloppy  I thicken it up with some tomato paste. I worked in schools for years and we alwayscooked our hamburger in water. The meat was finer, no chunks, and the fat content was less from draining and rinsing.

So, if i were making these for a regular dinner for my family, these would not be worth the effort. But I made these for a bachelorette weekend, and these were perfect. Sloppy joe to travel, and they were a big hit!

Yes I made this today!  I did not have sour cream though. I did use the Manwich original & thick n chunky. Next time I'm going to use the thick n chunky & a can of bold. Anyway. Turned out great! I did opt out of the melted butter, but sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese on top of the biscuits before baking. My husband was surprised on how the biscuits really expanded! He did eat 2 and said he would like me to make these again. They are filling!  Don't mind my pizza pan and odd shaped pockets please. I'm still new to the kitchen cooking.  ??

Really tasted better than I imagined. Still a Sloppy Joe in my mind is on a bun, and that is the only reason I give it 4 stars.

This was an ok meal that was quick and easy to make.  I prefer a bit of spice and found this to be sweet and i added a quarter a teaspoon of cayenne.

Used same recipe sub the onions for canned green chiles. Perfecto! Baked about 20-30 min because I like toasty dough.

My family absolutely loved these. It's one of their new favorites dinners, and first one the list when the old "what should we have for dinner tonight?" is asked. I added some shredded cheese inside each one, and its always a hit. Thanks for sharing :)

Very time consuming. I used smaller biscuits than I was supposed to but in the end it turned out good. I will eat it again but hopefully someone else makes it next time for me! ;)

Pretty easy to make but the only problem was that they would not seal together well. They still turned out ok, husband liked them I did not. I probably will try them again another time since my husband likes them.
