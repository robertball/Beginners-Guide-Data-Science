I absolutely love pasta amatriciana (especially since I used to wait tables in a fab Italian restaurant in the Hamptons that served it) and have failed miserably at recreating it on my own (despite being provided with the ingredients from my old boss!)  I was very happy to come across this recipe, but there are some changes I make that truly make it a tasty dish:  1.  I use Abraham's diced proscuitto with juniper berries (available in most large grocery stores and peapod.com).  It has an incredible flavor and it's nice to have some of your work done for you.  I brown it first on its own.  I believe this is the 'key' to this dish!   2.  Then I add the onion to the proscuitto and cook for a few minutes.  I've also used green onions (scallions) and they've worked great with the recipe.  3.  Next I add a few cloves of chopped fresh garlic and fresh chopped grape (or Natures Sweet) tomatoes.   4.  Next I add a bit more olive oil and about a 1/4 cup jarred tomato sauce just to give it a little 'saucy-ness' (I know the Italian place I used to work at did this as well).  5.  I reserve about 1/4 cup of the hot cooking water from the pasta to thin out the sauce so that it can cover all the pasta.  6.  About a minute or two before I'm ready to combine the sauce with the pasta I add fresh chopped basil (a few leaves).  I use the white wine and pepper as well.  I've added grilled shrimp, chicken, and vegetables to the pasta.    Multo Bene!  Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry but yeegads! Took one look at this after cooking and had to throw it away. The pancetta needs to be crispy. Cook it separate from the onions. This looked and tasted and smelled AWFUL. Sorry :(((

Quite good though I added a little bit of lemon juice and cut down on the onion the second time around.

This is very tasty. I did make some slight changes. After following the recipe and then tasting the sauce, I grated a clove of garlic into it. I also added chopped fresh basil and parsley. I used whole wheat spaghetti which worked very well in this dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe!! Make it even better by substituting 1/2 cup heavy cream for the white wine and up the bacon to about 6 strips.

I cook lots of Italian dishes and I thought this was great. Very simple and tasty. One change: I used cherry tomatoes,  not a can of crushed tomatoes. Mmmm.

Though I had to use salt pork instead of panchetta, this was the most authentic amatraciana, the flavors were clean and simple. LOVED IT, though I may have to try a little bechemel topping, that sounded gooood.

Close to the classic Amatriciana, this is an easy, fast, and simple recipe. I felt there was too much wine, though. Also, I followed the instructions by simmering the al dente pasta for 2 minutes in the sauce. Itâ€™s unconventional but interesting. However, to keep the pasta al dente, you need to keep an eye on it.

So delicious! I was looking for a recipe to use some pancetta that I had. This recipe was not disappointing. I cut back on the red pepper flakes a little since I'm a wimp and added minced garlic. Also, since I don't cook with wine, I used heavy cream as suggested by another reviewer. Quick, easy, and at the risk of being redundant, delicious!
