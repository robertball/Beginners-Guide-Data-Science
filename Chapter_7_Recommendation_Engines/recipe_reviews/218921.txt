I liked the concept and the flavors.  For some reason these didn't get crunchy.  Ended up putting them back in the toaster oven to crisp them up.

These are AWESOME and ADDICTING! I also added in about 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes, and that gave these a nice kick! One thing I wish I would've added was salt...IMO these NEED SALT! I tried adding it after baking, but they were too dry and the salt wouldn't adhere...I will know for next time, though. These are still wonderful and me and the little guy can't stop snacking on them. I will definitely be making these agin (with added salt, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

these were just ok. I'm not sure if I did something wrong. They tasted a bit....off. Not really burned but something like that.
