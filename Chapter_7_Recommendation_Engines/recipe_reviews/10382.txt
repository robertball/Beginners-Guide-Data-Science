My kids, hubby and I love these easy cookies!Terrific recipe! I used Jiffy Baking mix instead of Bisquick and cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 of a cup packed, they tend to spread a bit with the full cup. *****!

This recipe worked out great because we were staying in a home that did not have flour and baking soda to make cookies - but! they did have Jiffy mix and I was able to make cookies :-))

I used butter flavored Crisco instead of the butter AND I added one teaspoon vanilla to the 24 batch of cookies recipe.  I think the vanilla added a richer flavor to the cookie.

Everyone was happy with how these turned out. 

Thanks!

Quick, easy, and delicious. I added a bit of vanilla and left out the walnuts (due to allergies), and they turned out great.

5 stars for simpicity. Easy variations such as peanut butter in place of half the butter. Quick way to add a smile to someone's face.

My mother used to make these - only in the form of cookie bars.  I have been trying to find this recipe for years, and was beginning to think they would just be a fond childhood memory.  I have made them three times for my family this week!  The last two times, I substituted the nuts with butterscotch chips.  That was a really great accent to this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was "okay".  While I followed everything exactly, it was too salty and fat for us.  (I'm sure the Bisquick made it rise).

I'm not sure about these cookies... they are kind of salty and they came out fat and puffy. They are pretty crumbly, too.  I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts and added some butterscotch chips. Overall, they are good.

Oh my!  These are the among the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted.  Certainly the easiest to prepare.  Possibly a bit of a strange aftertaste but likely due to the buttermilk mix...but nothing that a glass of milk can't fix!  Overall, I say these are very good cookies.

This is fast, but tastes just okay.  Would be great as a last minute thing for a bake sale or something for kids.  I found the cookies too....grainy--something was strange about the texture.

The recipe was too dry as is, but I added an extra egg and it made it a wonderful consistency.  I used the buttermilk pancake mix since I had that on hand.

I know we all like moist cookies, but I would suggest turning down the oven temp (just slightly~15 degrees) and lighten up on the butter. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with this recipe. I'll keep it. Super EASY! I doubled the batch and ended up with about 25 cookies.

I omitted the walnuts.  These are so good and easy.  Great texture. EDIT: These are very soft and chewy the first day, but become hard the next even in a sealed container.  Still good though.

I thought this recipe was great! The cookies had a dry, crumbly almost shortbread-like texture. I did not find them salty as in other reviews. I used 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar and 2 eggs. Will be making this one again!

This worked out great for me. I didn't 
want to go out and buy ingredients for 
cookies for this week's lunches. This 
recipe is great for throwing in whatever
you have on hand. 

I used a stick of margerine and used
a chopped dark chocolate candy bar and
a chopped Snickers in place of the 
chocolate chips and nuts. 

Husband and kids liked these. I'll be 
sure to make these again, with different
ingredients every time.

Delicious! Made these for SuperBowl night and we loved them. 
Hubby said these were a bit salty; but I enjoyed the sweet/salty effect! Maybe next time I'll add a bit more brown sugar (I like them thin and crispy), and a dash of vanilla.  Also, I use choc chips along with pnut butter chips and walnuts!  TRULY A GREAT, FAST RECIPE! A+ Thanks!

This recipe is a great way to use up some extra bisquick, but i can't say that I would buy the bisquick just to make these cookies. The taste was pretty good and the cookies come out flat. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla for the 24 serving recipe.

Loved this recipe. Very easy. I read other reviews and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I also did not have packed brown sugar so I used sugar in the raw instead. Still came out real good.

They turned out great.  I used healthy heart bisquick and added vanilla.  Baked for only 8 min. since my first batch was too dark.

These turned out better than I expected!  I used reduced-fat Bisquick, and I substituted an overly-ripe banana for 1/3 of the butter (so I used 2/3 of a stick instead of a whole stick).  I also took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a teaspoon of vanilla, as well as cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  Next time I will be sure to use a smaller spoon to scoop batter onto the cookie sheet, as the cookies spread a good amount and turned out large.  They were light, fluffy, and tasty!

A keeper. I skipped the walnuts,then compensated with more chips. Next time I will try different combinations of chips, etc. Watch them carefully though. Just an extra minute or two will make the bottoms too dark. Thanks Robin.

Very good and easy to make.  I added a dash of vanilla and used a whole bag of chips.  Much lighter tasting than traditional recipes.

I made these as bars & it turned out pretty well!  Very easy to make and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  A little salty, but not sure wha tto do about that.  My only suggestion is to use more chocolate chips - IMO, 1 cup is not enough...I will use the whole bag next time!

Didn't taste salty to us, nor did it have that 'baking mix' taste. In fact, it tasted almost like the real-deal from scratch! The changes I made were to use 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 eggs, skip the nuts and a full bag of chocolate chips. Make sure to space these far apart as they do spread. Gone in under 2 days!

Excellent cookies!  I love that I only used a few ingredients and made them in about 30 minutes.  I did take other's advice and added some vanilla.  Turned out perfect!

Very quick and simple to make when I'm in the midst of a chocolate attack. I added vanilla and 1/4 to 1/2c extra chips and it came out nicely for my taste. This is a keeper!!

I thought these turned out great! I used regular baking mix and pecans instead of walnuts (it’s what we had in the pantry). Easy to make too. Thanks for the recipe!

This has become my favorite "go-to" chocolate chip cookies recipe!  I read a few additional chocolate chip cookie pointers on different websites and have followed them.  If you have time, put your dough in the refrigerator to cool off before baking.  Also, put your cookie sheet in the freezer for a few minutes before using it...I know, sounds crazy, but it does make a difference.

I figured there was no way that this could be a good recipe for cookies having followed the back the chocolate chip bag for years. could not have been more wrong!! I have this labeled as "cheaters Cookies" because they are so easy to make and taste amazing. I made 8 batches for three different kids x-mas parties in one morning with out issue

Mine were solid and dense, did not run. In fact, kept its shape so much that I had to flatten it more. What did I do wrong?

I found this recipe on Pinterest, but it included 2 tsp. vanilla and 2-3/4 cup Bisquick. I made it as I found it on Pinterest and it's not bad. The recipe is easy and the cookies will satisfy a chocolate chip fix. Next time I'll try with peanut butter as suggested here. I baked them 12 minutes.

I definitely like this recipe, though I had to tweak it a bit. Firstly I noticed the mix was extremely dry and did not incorporate well, so I added a tablespoon of lowfat milk and a teaspoon of real vanilla extract. The flavor was perfect! The cookies came out crunchy around the edges, but soft and chewy in the middle. I also left out the walnuts since we didn't have any. These are great for a late night treat when you don't have the proper ingredients to make them from scratch. I will try what other users have suggested and use peanut butter in place of half of the butter/margarine next time.

Very sweet cookie, I added vanilla because I think all cookies are yummier with vanilla. I like but do not love these cookies. I made 27 cookies and baked for 12 minutes.
