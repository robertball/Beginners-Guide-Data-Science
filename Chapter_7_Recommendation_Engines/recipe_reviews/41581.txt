We love these muffins. I make them several times a month!  When I first made them I too was expecting the yummy creamy cheese middle that the title leads you to beleive will be there. But no these muffins use the cream chese as a cake, there isnt really a need to do all of the layer work you can swirl it or mix it in.  However here is a little tip, if you are looking for the yummy creamy cheese middle skip the cream cheese directions from this reciped and use this:
1 tub of cheesecake filling cream cheese
  (the kind philadelphia has out)
1 tablespoon vanilla
add either powdered sugar or regular sugar to taste.   
mix it all up  and lay it out on saran wrap and form a long tube shape. Roll it up and freeze it until frozen solid.

then when you make the muffins, fill the muffin cups 3/4 full with the batter and slice the frozen cream cheese mixture into little puck sizes and push them down into the middle of the batter.

When you bake the mixture will give you that yummy cream cheese middle you were looking for... just dont eat them right out of the oven.. HOT!!

These are very tasty, but they really do not rise up. They baked up with flat tops and the blueberries all sank to the bottom. I added extra blueberries and wound up with 24 muffins, not 12, when I followed the directions to add 1 TBS each of batter, filling, and batter again. It worked out perfectly that way. Be careful not to overmix the batter - that's what makes them tough.

I am writing this about 5min after eating one of these muffins.  YUM!  Great texture and taste.  I used vegetable oil in place of olive oil because I don't like the olive oil flavor in baking.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  There was much more cream cheese mix than needed for one batch of muffins so I ended up making two.

These tasted good, but it was a lot of work for muffins.  WARNING: It makes too much; cut the recipe in half.  I had so much batter that I filled the muffin tin to the top and still had a bunch left over.  Because I stuffed the tin, batter overflowed during cooking.  Now, I'm cleaning my oven.

Next time I will definitely use more blueberries, turn the oven down to 350 instead of 375 (i also experienced burning :( of a few muffins). Do not forget to grease the muffin tinS (it takes 2 tins for this recipe) and DO NOT FILL ALL THE WAY. Fill about 1/2 to 3/4 full only. You can imagine what happened to my muffins...

Excellent. To those who didn't like the flavour, substitute your favourite baking oil for the olive oil, the taste of which tends to take over.

I'm shocked at noticing that my review will be the first five-star review for this recipe! Granted, these muffins are moist to the point that they are hard to extract from the muffin tins.  Indeed, if that's a concern, maybe bake them a little longer or add a bit more flour?  I don't know.  I'm not a baker.  I added one cup raspberries to the 1 cup blueberries, and I'm glad I did.  It was a taste explosion.  If I were rating this recipe on appearance, I might go with four stars; they turned out flatter than many muffin recipies I've prepared.  Still, if you are looking for taste, throw an extra cup of fruit in the batter and be prepared to be awed.  The cream cheese angle is genius.  Awesome!

I was so excited to make these muffins for my daughter's Easter breakfast, they did not disappoint! They were so easy to make, especially for me since I've only baked from scratch a handful of times. They're very moist, and don't crumble and fall apart which is a huge plus for feeding a two year old. It definitely made more than 12 muffins though, more like 16 or 17, but that's fine with me. I think if I make these again, I will definitely put double or even triple the cream cheese filling, I LOVE the texture & taste of the filling and these need more! That's the only reason it didn't get a 5 star in my opinion. Will definitely make these again!

I enjoyed this very much. Though I altered the recipe. I used one stick butter creamed with one cup sugar. 2 duck eggs. 1 1/2 cup butter milk. 1 cup white flour/1 cup whole wheat. 2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 baking soda. 1 tsp salt. 2 cups blueberries. I made the filling the same.It needed more than 1 Tbsp filling. I think I will leave out the sour cream next time so it will be cream cheesier. Nothing ran over and the recipe made 12 muffins. I baked it at 350 degrees.

These were awesome! Wonderful! My husband says they're the best ever. Only changes (1) used vegetable oil instead of olive - I know olive is healthier, but it leaves an odd taste in muffins, (2) used whey instead of buttermilk, not because it's better but because I had lots of whey around that needed to be used!, (3) this made 3 dozen, not 1 dozen. Yum! Thanks!

Pretty amazing!  I substituted fresh local strawberries.  I almost didn't use whole wheat because it sounded too healthy, but really --- they were GREAT!!!  375 was fine. No rising problems. It made a total of 20 nice sized muffins.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so I just used regular white.  They were wonderful but came out to 24!  Can't wait to try cherries to substitue blueberries! They were moist & delicious - not too difficult. Not sure why others had problems

these were only ok. The end result  was a small, tough "muffin" with cakey cream cheese. I was expecting super moist, chewey, creamy goodness and it didn't deliver. I was able to eat a few and like them, ok. Maybe because I had spent so much time on them.

my son and hubby liked them, so...personally I think they turned out too moist; also I had plenty of batter and found it impossible to accomodate it in 12 muffins tins...may be the solution is putting less of something liquid...
anyway the taste was good.

I used self rising flour instead of the unbleached & wheat flour & I used a bag of frozen berries instead of fresh blueberries. You will have LOTS of batter & filling. Don't be afraid to mix everything together or alternate between layers. Also make sure that you really grease/oil/spray your muffin pans as they are still super moist when they come out of the pans & will have a tendancy to stick. Despite the amount of sugar & honey, they are not over sweet. Cook them @ 350f instead of the 375f. May take a bit longer, but well worth the wait. They won't be as quick to burn on top.

I was hesitant to make this recipe based on the other reviews. Unfortunatley they were right. This recipe wasn't what I expected. They were good but not great. I was worried about the comments about it yielding so much so I decided to put the dough into a cake pan. This worked perfectly, but you have to watch the time more carefully. If I make them again I'll lower the temp to 350F, I think 375 was to high, mine were a little burnt. They had a great taste and they were extremely moist. I used extra blueberries like the other reviews recommented. I will try this recipe again with cranberries.

They taste okay, a little sweet I think next time i'll use 1/2 a cup of sugar in the muffin mix.  Also, I lowered the temp to 350 and needed to bake 30 minutes.  My first batch with the recipes directions came out gooey on the inside and too dark on the outside.  I'm sure they'll be better next time.  :D

I didn't like these muffins at all.  They took a long time to prepare and just didn't taste right to me. They weren't liked by my family either.

I did not like these muffins. The recipe calls for way too few blueberries in my opinion. I doubled the amount. They also have a very strange flavor that I really did not care for. After tasting it my friend asked me if there was some sort of spice in it such as cinnamon or nutmeg (which there isn’t). Not sure where that flavor comes from but I didn’t like it. But they do have a decent texture and are fluffy and moist. Regardless, I won’t be making these again.

These were good. I used the exact ingredients as written. BUT, I turned my oven down to 350 and 20 minutes got the job done. Also, I like to sprinkle my quick breads with turbinado sugar.  I like how they tasted. You can pretty much taste all of the ingredients in the muffin. This recipe made 24 muffins, not twelve. I was hoping the cream cheese layer would be more creamy, but it is more cakey. My husband really liked them. . Would I make them again? Maybe. I am glad I tried this recipe, but I will probably try out some others before I make this one again.

These turned out great and very tasty! When I was putting them together I was sure that they had flopped as my batter was VERY stiff. The whole wheat flour that I used was what I had ground using my flour mill,  so it is heavier than most. I could have used my larger muffin pan as when I filled them, I used a scoop of batter, a scoop of the filling which was quite runny, and then another scoop of the thick batter but I made it fit into 12 muffins. I had substituted the sugar with Splenda. Also, I didn't have enough buttermilk so I added a little sour cream and some cream and milk to it but they came out beautifully light and fluffy. No complaints with them whatsoever but next time I will add more blueberries.  I will definitely make them again and I would be proud to take these to my ladies' group. I'm sure that I have seen something similar to these at Starbucks.

Very yummy. Makes more than just a dozen though. I got 15 huge muffins and could have easily gotten 20 regular sized ones.

Loved these muffins.  I made them EXACTLY as written.  I filled each cup with a total 3T of the batter + filling + batter. This filled each cup to the top.  M muffins came out nice a round and beautiful (they weren't flat-topped as others have mentioned -- even after they cooled).  I also had NO batter left, although I had quite a bit of unused filling left over.  If you are filling the muffin cups to the top, you will not have batter left over.  It is true, the "filling" part is not a creamy, gooey center as the recipes descriptions would have you believe.  However, that didn't matter at all to me, because I thought the muffins tasted so good!  I also used the olive oil, and I still thought that they tasted great!  :D

Heaven help you if you have little self control...these things are delish!  I didn't have enough sour cream on hand so made up the difference with 1/2 & 1/2 cream, 1% milk and 1 tablespoon of vinegar...they made 24 really puffy muffins - and no overflow into bottom of oven...thankful for this.  I used a commercial vanilla sugar on top for color and crunch-had to give them away to neighbors before I inhaled the whole works

I only rated them 4 stars out of the 5 because they did burn on the bottoms and I did use muffin cup liners.  I cooked them at 350 for about 5 minutes less than the time stated.  I also got 18 muffins out of the recipe and way too much filling was left over :( what a waste.  My muffins did turn out fluffy flavorful and moist though.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added a cup of raspberries with the blueberries and it was awesome.  The cream cheese filling blended in though with the batter, don't think I would have missed it had I not added it.  Maybe try that way next time.

These tasted great which is why I give it five stars, but still did not turn out quite like I expected. There was a lot of filling left over and they did not rise very high, but still tasty so thank you for sharing.

I really liked this recipe - will make it again! I made 18 muffins and had cream cheese filling left over, next time I think I will half the cream cheese filling part and put a little less in each muffin - cutting out some of the fat at the same time. I am also thinking about using oatmeal instead of white flour to make it a bit healthier, we'll see how that works out - anyone try that?

So so excited to try this recipe out, then so so disappointed with the results...maybe I should not have help them up to the same expectations as a muffin that I'd tried at a coffee shop once which beared the same name.

This recipe made WAY more than one dozen muffins ... I came out with 17 and still had more filling. 

Not too happy with the outcome, either. There wasn't much sweetness, the buttermilk and whole wheat flour didn't complement each other that well, and the filling simply metled into the rest of the muffin. I did use nonfat cream cheese, however, which could have been a contributing factor. 

Still, I won't be making these again. Too many other good muffin recipes out there.
