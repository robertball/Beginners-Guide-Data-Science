It was a beautiful bar. Came out of the pan well. Taste was excellent. The crust remained crisp for 3 days. I have to admit, I added more cinnamon. And I didn't follow the recipe for the glaze. I just made my own- powdered sugar and milk and a touch of vanilla.  A word of caution, though: USE the waxed paper as described in the directions. If you are not a pie crust maker, this recipe might not be a good choice for your first pie dough experience.
ALSO: no reason that this could not be made into blueberry pie bars, or rhubarb pie bars or any other fruit pie bars. The comparison would be to a 10" pie filling recipe.

I just made this again for the 3rd time. ( its in my oven now! yum I cant wait!) I use a little bit less sugar though because it was too sweet for me the second time when I added the correct amount. I should have reduced it then but forgot.I  added half of that 1/4th cup instead of the whole 1/4th amount. And I use a lot of really good high quality cinnamon, don't measure but about half a tablespoon or more.. yes I like cinnamon.. .  Never have had a problem with the dough not fitting the pan like some of you are. Although I'm using the large glass pan the kind you make lasagna in.. I think its like 14 x 7 or around there. A tip for people having problem getting it to fit is when you roll it in the ball, I square it a bit before you roll it out and then when its close lift off the top paper and share up the corners some so it rolls out more square or rectangle shaped. And make it really thin! I cant help but think maybe they aren't making it thin ugh because you want it very thin. Then I hold the pan above the dough to be sure its going to fit. 
I love cimmamon and I always use extra in anything that calls for it and it really does add more flavor. Also I think I added some to the dough the 1st time too. I forgot this time. and it was good  Also the 1st 2 times I made this I didn't have granny smiths because we have apple trees so I used summer reds which are sweet crips and firm and a tiny bit of tart but not as much as granny smiths are so I did add in some lemon juice to i

I tried to get my dough thin enough to go on a cookie sheet & couldn't so I used a large cake pan. I also used in season apples not granny smith...bad idea. They were starting to make their own juice by the time I got the dough done. So I put all of it in the pan & cooked it for longer (40-45 mins). When cooled the dough was not firm. They still taste good but don't stray from the original recipe. I will try again another time with grannys :)

Delicious and totally worth the small amount of effort. I had to use another 1/2 tablespoon of water in the glaze to make it usable, and I used a 10x13 instead of what the recipe calls for. It turned out "too good" as my guy says.

A bit sweet for me, the next time I will cut the sugar back. I did press some crushed walnuts into the bottom crust before putting in the Apple mixture. It added some texture to it. I will make it again.

I made this and everyone loved it.  It is  a really good alternative to apple pie.  I put a little maple flavoring in the icing.  My grandchldren couldn't get enough of it.

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and it turns out great everytime I make it. Delicious with vanilla icecream. My husband loves it and he won't eat apple pie normally.

The filling was very bland, and the crust wasn't enough to cover the 15x10 pan.  Will need some adjustments if I make this again.
