Loved the receipe and so happy to find it. I tried this receipe at a relatives house and tried to duplicate it. I didn't know to cover the dish the first 20 minutes so veggies were undercooked. Covering it the first 20 minutes made the difference. I am taking this as a side dish for Easter and I know it is going to be a hit. It is great as leftovers the next day, hot or cold.

Delicious! In Colorado with snow on the ground, I went out to my garden and found fresh thyme for this dish. My grandchildren loved it. Thanks Carina.

Also added a bit of butternut squash, substituted fresh oregano for the thyme because thyme wasnâ€™t available

very tasty.  The covering of the veggies and then uncovering really made a difference in the roasting process.  But I did make a couple of adaptations.  I used truffle oil, for a more earthy flavor, mixed colored carrots, and half smoked cheddar and half parm cheese because that is what I had in the fridge.  Great flavors.   Will make again. So simple

Delicious!  I pre-cooked the vegetables a few minutes in the microwave before I transferred them to the baking pan  just to save on the time I had the oven on and that worked great.

It was edible, but dull.
