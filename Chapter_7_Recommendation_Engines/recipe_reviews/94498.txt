Made this for my inlaws for Christmas (a little early this year).  I also used black pepper instead of cayenne and added some parmesean cheese to it as well.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the post.

We subbed milled black pepper for the cayenne - outstanding! Hubby makes loaves of bread just so he can dip them in this! Thank you.

I made this as part of a New Year's Eve Dinner for my husband and he absolutely loved it.  I didn't make enough because he ate it all up before the entree was served.  I didn't follow the recipe 100% because I bought some minced roasted garlic and put all ingredients in the blender so the garlic would be pureed.  Next time I will follow the recipe and it will probably be even better!
