This recipe couldn't be easier and is delicious!
The only suggestion I have is to make it the day before to let the flavors really develop.  This is one salad that only gets better with a little time.

I took a chance and made this for a family meal, I even doubled it. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received. After tasting it, my 4 year old said, "do I have to eat the beans, I don't like them."

Sorry, but this was definitely not what I was hoping for. I guess it just wasn't what the group was expecting either. I'll keep searching for more of a vinaigrette 3 bean salad. 

My mistake, I should have realized 1.25 cups sugar was going to be quite sweet.

I have always been scared of three bean salad- NO MORE!
I make lunch for 40 people at work each week- this website is so valuable to me. 
Requested this week was three bean salad.
This was EASY and really yummy! Never buy canned again!

This was excellent. Just the right amount of tang and sweet. I used Great Northern Beans instead of wax beans. My one year old loved it!

This is a very good basic 3-bean salad.  I, too, cut the sauce in half and it wasjust fine.  It does taste better after marinating overnight.

Easy, quick and so good!  Although I think I had enough dressing for about two batches and just used 6 cans of beans instead.

This was pretty good, but I ended up with way too much dressing. I would half the dressing recipe next time or add more beans. I omitted the green peppers and added some kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Next time would add more vinegar so its a little more tangy.

I made this but used kidney beans, green beans and great northern beans.  It turned out pretty good, I'll definitely make it again.  There was a giant bowl with lots of juice, so it's good for a big family or a picnic.

These are good and I will make them again; however, they have about twice as much "sauce" as they need.  Next time I will either cut the "sauce" in half or add more beans.

This is a very simple & delicious recipe for 3 bean salad.  I do cut the sugar in half & the flavor is still great! I couldn't find wax beans so I substituted garbanzo beans.

We like bean salad and I especially liked this one because there was no oil in it and the dressing was cooked and blended better than the uncooked with oil.  Thanks for sharing.

Another good basic salad recipe which can easily be changed up depending on your likes and dislikes and what is on hand at the time. I wanted a smaller salad so used one tin of a three bean mix and one tin of black beans.  I love colour so used green, red and yellow bell peppers in addition to the chopped onion.  As per other reviews, the sugar was cut back, and it is still quite sweet. The longer it marinates the better it gets.  Thanks, Kim!  Great recipe.

My mom used to make this and  loved it. This is very close but even better. I think it my be the sausiness from the corstarch or the tang from the dry mustard.

Thanks for an old family recipe.

Haven't all of us eaten 3 Bean Salads for years?  I know I have....... but this one called for a cooked thickened sauce/dressing that was new to me.  I changed the amount of sugar cuz we're trying to minimize carbs at our house, otherwise followed the recipe.  It's a good thing to have in the 'fridge for quick meals.  Add some cottage cheese and iced tea for a simple summer lunch.

Very easy and really good.  Did make 
too much juice and I even added a large
can of garbanzo beans.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and up the vinegar.
This recipe would be difficult to mess up. It's a keeper!

This is the typical 3 Bean Salad that I remember eating at family gatherings and picnics growing up.  It came out great and I loved making my own dressing instead of using store bought with all the chemicals.  I reduced the sugar to 1C and it was still too sweet however.  I will try this again with even less sugar.  If you want more "tang" I would definitely suggest decreasing the sugar by at least half.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

A good, solid side dish.  Had actually began with another recipe that, after tasting, ended up rinsing off the beans and going with this.  Unfortunately it used chick peas, which did nt absorb the tase well.  But a nice tang, and I was pleased.  Will make again.

This is so delish, and good for you. My husband said he never thought he would eat something that looked like this...lol...yes he loves it too! I used garbonzo beans instead of kidney beans. I made it like it called for first. Then I tweeked it by just using 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup..we never noticed that 1/4 C.  missing. I have mmade tgis many times now. And there is usuall enough liquid left to use again with new beans and onions....just leave it in for at leaast an hour....thanks for this recipe idea Kim.....Cindy

Pretty good.  I think the sugar and cider vinegar can both be altered to suit your tastes.  I prefer a little less sweet and a little more tang, so I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and increased the cider by 1/4 cup (while reducing the water by 1/4 cup)  Also added some different beans (butter and black) and red onion.  Others liked it and commented they had never had a bean salad quite like it, as they were taking seconds!

It took a whole lot of tweaking, but I came up with a delicious bean salad that is not too sweet using this recipe as a base. 

I cut the sugar back to 3/4 of a cup and increased the vinegar to 3/4 cup. I left the water and other spices alone. 

I omitted the bell pepper (forgot it) and added a peeled, but not chopped, clove of garlic. I also sliced the onions into thin rings. Only for nostalgas sake. That's how my mom made it. 

Everyone in the family, except the kid who won't touch a beam, loved it. I let it marinate overnight and it's outstanding. 

Thanks to all the folks who left their reviews!

I made this, but I did it a bit different.  I don’t like green beans or wax beans.  I used great northern beans, dark kidney beans and garbanzo beans.  I also add some julienne sliced herbed sun-dried tomatoes letting the oil drip over into the bowl as I add them.  It’s a hit!  Thanks!

Was almost the kind of three-bean salad that I like.  Next time I would cut the sugar down and it would be perfect.  I used scallion instead of regular onion.  Pretty good and authentic.  Just a bit too sweet.

This is a great recipe without using any oil! I added 1/4 tsp celery seeds for taste and interest and substituted black beans for kidney and it really was a hit

This is my new favorite bean salad recipe. My mom's is good, but I don't like oil in it and this one has none.

This was way too sweet. It also had too much dressing. It wasn't very nice to look at either. Sorry! I don't think it could be doctored up to meet my expectations!

This salad was okay. It was also a little too sweet, although I knew it had a lot of sugar in it.

This is the first bean salad I've made, and it tastes pretty good to me.
