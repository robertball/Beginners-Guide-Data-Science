Very tasty.  I poured the extra butter and garlic into the baking dish, and it made the edges super crispy and yummy.  My husband enjoyed so much, he had left-overs for breakfast.

Amazing!  I love it.  I added some fresh lemon juice and white wine to the butter/garlic misture and poured the remaining juice to the pan as well.  Also, I only cooked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect!

This was a last minute meal on one of those "What are we going to have for dinner?" nights.  What a treat!  I had to adapt the recipe with ingredients I had on hand and it was still delicious!  Next time, I will plan ahead follow recipe exactly, but even using dried spices and no thyme my family loved it (italian breadcrumbs probably helped)!  Note: cooking time was considerably less for our oven so adjust accordingly to maintain moisture in chicken.

Wow! What an easy and delicious recipe!! I didn't have fresh herbs but used the oregano and frozen basil cubes that I had. I also added a little rosemary. Next time, I will probably double the parmesan. Very good!!

Very yummy. The chicken was very moist. I poured the leftover butter and garlic into the baking pan and it soaked in really well.

This recipe was very good.  The chicken stayed very moist while still having a crisp outside.  My picky teenage son who is a diabetic even loved it!

This was easy to make. It tastes great and is extremely moist. I followed the recipe but added some rosemary. My two year old grandson - who's not overly fond of meat couldn't get enough.

Delicious baked chicken recipe! Straight forward with really great results! The chicken was perfectly cooked - moist and fork tender! NOTE: I only had italian bread crumbs and dried herbs available, but it worked out great! I cut down the the dried herbs to a teaspoon each. I did what previous reviewers suggested and poured the butter/garlic mixture into the baking dish, as well. The only thing is that I would probably change out the bread crumb to parmesan cheese ration (I personally would have enjoyed more cheese vs. bread crumbs), but other than that, it was still very tasty and I will be making it again!

This was SOOO good.  I really didn't make any additions or revisions.  I grow my own herbs, so I threw in a tiny little bit of fresh rosemary with the others, but that's all.  I served it with a side of grilled asparagus and some sliced fresh tomatoes and avocadoes with an herb and rice vinager dressing.  It was wonderful.  I don't remember if it was the submitter or a reviewer who commented on how good the leftovers were in chicken salad.  I made it for lunch today and it was hit!

We found this to be a very easy and delicious recipe.  We used italian bread crumbs so we didn't use several of the spices and it came out great.

Want to make this dish easier and healthier? Use olive oil in place of butter, just mix in some minced garlic. Dip your chicken into it and press into a mixture of 1 cup italian bread crumbs mixed with 1 cup grated parmesan or romano cheese. Olive oil on sheet pan, breaded chicken on pan, drizzle extra oil on top of chicken, bake as directed. Awesome, absolute favorite in my house for years.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this dish. Maybe if I had cut down some of the basil, oregano and thyme I might have liked it better. Seems like those spices overpowered the chicken. I am going to get some marinara sauce and mix the chicken with it and try to salvage some kind of meal from it. I hate to throw food away.Maybe I am just not used to those spices.

Amazing! loved it. I followed the directions on the recipe, I didn't however have any fresh herbs so i used a seasoning that contained the herbs. I also added extra parmesean and mozerrala cheese at 44 min of cooking and cooked it for only 45 min. as many suggested. I paired it with rice and a delicious ceasar salad that had carrots, cucumbers, tomotoes,and red and green apples. A keeper recipe :-D

Very tasty!  The chicken was so moist and very flavor able, the Parmesan is the plus in this recipe.  Did add the butter/garlic mixture to the dish which added a nice heavier garlic flavor.  After wards made a gravy from the drippings in the pan...yummy!

we really enjoyed this easy and quiick recipe except for the overpowering taste of oregano. I think next time I will cut it down a whole lot and add more garlic and rosemary. I also used panko breading.

This recipe was delicious! I only used 3-4 Tbsp butter and was still able to coat the chicken with butter/garlic mixture before dipping into the breading. I used dried thyme, basil, and oregano since I had them in my spice cabinet. I also used Panko breadcrumbs which made the chicken very crunchy. Next time, i will bake on a cooling rack to make the bottom of the chicken just as crunchy as the top. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am new to Allrecipes.com and have to say I have not been disappointed yet. This has to be the best baked Parmesan chicken recipe I have ever made. It is quick and easy. I actually cooked at 425 for about 30 to 35 minutes along side of the potatoes I was making and it came out nice and juicy. I wanted the have the last piece but I was good and saved it for my wife to have for lunch today. Try this with the Asparagus with Garlic and Oninons recipe found elswehere on this site.

This is a great go-to recipe.  To make it quicker I melted the butter in the microwave and added a sprinkle of garlic powder.  I also used almost a T of each spice but dried as well as Italian breadcrumbs.  I cut my chicken into nugget sized pieces and it only took about 30 minutes to cook!  Came out great!

rated a 5 even tho I changed it up some because I didn't have fresh herbs. So, I marinated the 2 chicken breasts I deboned (but left skin on). I used olive oil, lemon juice, the garlic, 1/2 tsp each dried thyme, oregano, rosemary vs basil and the S&P. I did put some minced grn onion in the marinade too and left it overnight. This way...I just pressed the pre-marinated chicken in seasoned Panko bread crumbs. I used fresh grated Asiago because I didn't have Parm. I melted the butter, garlic and a tsp of lemon juice in an anodized skillet and baked chicken in that. Started skin side down and carefully flipped about 20 minutes into cook time. Continued baking until golden brown on top. I think because I marinated (due to using dry herbs), the chicken was super moist and had a nice herbal flavor. Crust was great too! Thanks for the recipe idea that can be easily modified.

This was delicious!  The only change made was to use Lemon-Garlic Panko bread crumbs.  Hubby loved it, I loved it, and the kitties wouldn't leave us alone while eating!  With all the extra garlic from the bread crumbs, it really had our taste buds going while baking.  Good, good stuff.

Perfect 'crunch' to chicken!  I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and stuffed the chicken with ham and cheese.  YUMMY!!

I thought this was pretty bland. I could taste herbs, no one in particular, and no other flavors.... Maybe I did something wrong, but I did give it 3 stars because it turned out moist and tender- and gave me a good idea of dipping my chicken in garlic butter before coating- instead of egg all the time. Thank you.

Have made this recipe several times and it has always turned out great. A couple of times when I've been short of time I've used Italian bread crumbs rather than plain + herbs and it's turned out great. This is an incredibly simply recipe that is delicious and satisfying to the entire family.

My boyfriend asked me to add this to the list of regulars and I agree! I melted the butter in the microwave and added extra garlic into the butter and into the bread crumbs. I didn't have fresh herbs so i just took a small handfull of each and crushed them to release the flavor. The only thing I would have liked to see is a crispier crust. Maybe next time I will try to add some panko or leave it in a little longer - although I hate dry chicken! 

I would definitely suggest this to anyone.

This is so good. My fiance loves it so much we eat it at least every other week. I took it to a christmas party and it was a huge hit. 

I only use about half the butter and i find that the italian bread crumbs and a little salt and pepper are all the seasoning i need

Very, very good!  Easy too!  :)  If I make it again, I will cut the herbs in half.  The seasoning was a little strong for my tastes.  Still, quite delicious.  My husband wants to add it to the "rotation".

Delicious!!!  For once every member of my family loved it including all 3 kids.  That doesn't happen very often, so this recipe gets 6 stars from me.  It was easy to prepare as well as eye appealing. Wish I took a photo, but it was all gone pretty fast.

I did not have fresh herbs, I used the dried counterparts and cut them back to a teaspoon and a half. I also added onion powder to the bread crumbs. Very nice alternative to Shake-n-Bake. The little ones especially liked this.

The taste was great!  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the cooking time.  I would have killed my chicken if I cooked it for the amount stated.  I cooked mine at 350 for 30-35min... maybe my oven just cooks hot, but that is what worked for me.  My husband loved this dish and I served it with pasta with fresh basil and squash.  Delicious!

Tender chicken (used perdue) and really flavorful. SO easy! A definite keeper.  Sadly, after I had gotten half way through the recipe I realized I did not have Parmesan cheese! So, I crushed up garlic/parmesan croutons for the bread crumbs, instead of parmesan and breadcrumbs. Even easier and delicious!

this has become a recipe I come back to over and over.  My family really likes it.  I put more herbs in and probably a little more cheese but it has a great flavor.

I wonder how many people who are reviewing this recipe saying the spices are too much are using dried instead of fresh as called for.  When using dried spices you ant to use less.  In fact there's a 3(fresh) to 1(dried) ratio.  So if it says 1 tablespoon fresh, you want to use a third of a tablespoon (or one teaspoon) of dried.  In other words, you'd want to use 2 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoons of dried... and lemme tell you, when doing that, this recipe is absolutely amazing. 

I honestly would not change any of it.  I even used a butter substitute that was half the calories, and it still tasted great.  It's best when right out of the oven.  I made some the other night, had a couple, and the next day I tried microwaving the left overs and it wasn't nearly as good (maybe shoulda tried the oven)... but either way, these are fantastic!  Thanks so much for sharing, I love making this for people and usually make it along with some home made Mac and Cheese.

I always use panko breadcrumbs in place of regular breadcrumbs when breading chicken. These turned out nicely. I used chicken tenderloins and cooked them on a rack so the bottoms didn't get soggy.

50 min is way too long.  Our chicken was extremely dry and the breasts were larger than what was called for.  Crust was great...good flavor.

Super easy and very yummy. I simplified a little by melting the butter and garlic in cast iron and placing the chicken back in it to bake. I cut the chicken into tender-sized pieces and it baked in about 28 minutes. Used dried italian herb mix - 3 tsp - and it turned out fine. It had a little too much butter in my opinion, so next time might try just a half cup.

easy to prepare.  Chicken stayed moist but I ended up adding a little olive oil spritz to get rid of the "raw" bread crumb taste.  Served with a green salad and angel hair pasta with marinara.  Left overs were equally as good.

I thought this was delicious, and Hubster called it "a keeper".  Fork tender, with a delicious aroma, the only negative was the cooking time was a little off.  I had to add an extra 10 minutes, and still turned the broiler on to give it a little color.  I know individual ovens may differ, and that's why I mention this.  I always start monitoring the progress of a dish toward the end of the cooking time on the first trial.  To my way of thinking, an hour or more of baking time doesn't quite qualify as quick, so be sure to allow for that!  My only changes were to use 1/2 c. butter and eliminate the fresh oregano, since I didn't have any.  I think the recipe may be made with even less butter, so I will cut down to 1/4 c. next time.

Superb! My husband said these were outstanding. To add a little health kick, I added wheat germ and ground up almonds to the bread crumbs. Delicious. We're having these again for our next meat day.

Easy and fantastic chicken dinner.  At times I just use Italian bread crumbs with fresh grated Parmesan and it still comes out delicious.  This recipe made my weekly dinner rotation.

I used what I had on hand for spices, fresh cilantro and dried oregano, fresh parmesan. Very well received, no leftovers. Next time I'll add thyme as called for and maybe a little cayenne. Very tasty and tender and quick.

i used this recipe the other night for my boyfriend and our roommate and they loved it, it was soooo good, thank you so much for this easy to make recipe :D the one thing i added was a thin piece of provolone cheese on top of each piece of chicken about 5 minutes before it was done in the oven, and it only took about 40 minutes to cook in m oven so people should keep a close eye on it, other than that, it was amazing!!

Very good! It was so quick an easy. The chicken turned out very moist. I did add a bit more garlic and as others have said, I poured the remaining garlic/butter mixture over the chicken.

Absolutely delicious! I skipped the garlic (my husband doesn't like it), and used the dried herbs I had on hand - basil, thyme and marjoram - rather than fresh. Still absolutely divine, and VERY moist! I'll make this often. Thanks for posting it!

made this for my family and my 15,11, 8 and 2 yr old loooved it.  Older kids said it was the best thing they ever put in their mouths.  Although I did use Panko instead of bread crumbs and dried herbs instead of fresh.  The Panko was the key I think, kept it crisp and juicy!  Tried it tonight on tilapia and it was just as fantastic!

This was delicious! I ended up using half the amounts of dried herbs as I didn't have fresh. I didn't have thyme, so I used a tablespoon of Italian blend that I did have instead. If you quarter and tenderize the breasts they come out super melt in your mouth and cook in only 30ish mins! Served with some rice and veggies and a little pasta sauce on top. Definitely adding this to the repertoire!

I made this tonight and it was delicious!!  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used flour.  I also didn't have any garlic so I added garlic salt to the mixture.  I cooked the chicken twice as long as stated with a cover on.  It was so moist and tender.  My picky husband even like it.  So easy and cheap to make!  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I cook quite a bit, and look for recipes that show a 4 or five star rating.  Until this recipe, I have batted 100%. I did not care for this one, however, at least as done by the written recipe.

OMG!! delious.. The only things I changed was I  used freshly grated parmesan for a more cheesy kick.. and lowered cooking time to 40 mins. I think it really depends on your oven.  Thanks so much, We Love chicken dishes.

My family asks for this by its new name: "Amazing Chicken!"  Like some others, I cut down the butter a little bit and poured the leftover butter down the edges of the pan before cooking.  I have already shared this recipe with others and all agree that it is delicious!

Coating was not as crispy as I as expecting. Was still really good. I think next time we try this, will not pour left over butter directly over chicken breasts.

Excellent!The chicken comes out moist, crispy and delicious! Plus, there's no oil splatter to clean up! The only thing I do different is pound the breasts thinner before breading them (I don't like thick breasts). I have already made them twice with rave reviews from my husband and teens.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only change I will make next time is that I will bake it on a rack so BOTH sides of the crust are crispy.    I served this with pasta and spaghetti sauce.  Even the leftovers were delicious.

I am 21, and this is the first meal I've made at home. Really easy to make - just follow instructions and voila - you have a moist, parmesan-crusted masterpiece. I read the reviews criticizing the amount of spices used - and I actually used the dry (more dense) version of the spices and it turned out perfect. Highly recommend. Will be making again soon!

A hit with the whole family! I cut 2 large breast halves into the 6 4-ounce pieces and butterflied them slightly so they would cook evenly and faster. You may want to reduce the salt in the breadcrumb mix, as the Parmesan contributes a good deal of saltiness.

Very tasty easy dish. Cut large breasts into strips before rolling in butter and crumb mixture. Pressed extra crumbs onto strips. Great leftovers!  Baked on aluminum foil sprayed with vegetable spray for easy cleanup.  Just baked a second time on parchment paper. Easy clean up!  Delicious!

This turned out great for me, and I am cooking challenged. I changed the Tbs of fresh herbs to tsps of dried, and used 1/2c butter which was more than enough. Really buttery and crunchy. My husband was impressed! Ha. We both loved it. Would be great with fresh grated parm, next time.

Easy and tasty.  I used a wire cooling rack over a cookie sheet to bake the chicken: it makes it crispier all over.  I used dried seasonings, not fresh, no thyme; I also used half butter and half olive oil - still delicious.  Leftovers were good cold the next day.

I was multi-tasking other chores when I made this dish,  I made a couple blunders by not following the recipe exactly, but my husband said it was the best chicken I ever made!  I patted my chicken dry and salt and pepper them, added lemon and white wine to the butter garlic mixture, then added the breadcrumbs and parmesan to the butter mixture. OOPS!  Rather than throwing it away and starting over I spread mayo on the breasts then pressed the butter- breadcrumb mixture to adhere.  Baked them for 1 hour.  Came out fantastic!

I tried this recipe, prepared as directed and basted breaded chicken with leftover butter and sprinkled with additional breadcrumb mixture and added additional grated parmesan cheese to the top of chicken. The chicken was very crisp on outside, moist on inside, and absolutely delicious. The only change i would make when preparing the next time would be to add a rack to the baking pan as the bottoms of the chicken pieces were a bit soggy. I served with garlic/green beans, stuffing (instead of potato), and gravy.

this was ok. but it did not have a ton of flavor. I am surprised at the number of reviewers that thought the herbs were overpowering. I did used dried herbs, but they've never failed me like this before. I also used the familiar parmesan cheese from “the green container” – if I were to make this again, I would DEINITELY use fresh grated parm and more of it as the cheese taste was barely there. as many reviewers suggested, I poured the leftover butter/garlic mixture over the chicken in the baking pan. this is a must! but make sure your chicken is arranged closely in the pan or the mixture may burn. also, the cooking time seems a bit high. my 4 big chicken breast halves were done at 40 minutes.

Great easy and quick recipe! Followed the recipe exactly the first time, and the crust was perfect, but the chicken a smidge dry. The second time I made it, I baked it as I had learned to bake chicken breasts, ie high temp/short time, and the chicken was much juicier (450 degrees, for 15 minutes). I also omitted the butter dip the second time, and used an egg dip instead, trying to cut down on fat. Without the butter, the chicken was lacking some flavor, and the coating didn't stick together and crisp as well, though for a healthier dish, still really good.

Loved this.  It was a big hit with the kids, next time I will cut down on the salt a bit.  It's fast and easy!  I did pound out the chicken and it cooked in about 30 min or so- also used panko flakes and dry spices- about 3/4 tea.  Be careful with thyme if you use dried, it's very potent.

Delicious! I pretty much changed the recipe completely by adding half a cup of mozzarella cheese and pouring the butter over the chicken with some lemon, but the base was the same and it was delicious! My fiance even asked me what I did to the chicken to make it so good. He took it for lunch today. :)

This recipe was easy to make and was a big hit for my family. I used boneless and skinless chicken breast and thighs. I prefer thighs because the meat was more tender than the breast especially when using a fork and knife to cut through it, but they are both very good. I enjoyed the tender and juicy meat while the crust was crunchy and very flavorful. I think it might do with something added to it, possibly lemon juice or lemon pepper, but it is great as it is. I found this recipe when I wanted to do something more than just regular baked chicken and it turned out great. I recommend it.

Hubby made this great dish with some slight alterations: breadcrumbs were used instead of potato flakes, the garlic was put into the melted butter, and tandoori spices were added to the mixture. The chicken was baked together with potatoes. Delicious!

Baked Parmesan-Crusted Chicken Haiku: "Moist, tasty chicken! I loved using the fresh herbs. I'd make this again!" I followed the recipe as written, except halving it for 3 of us, and instead of baking it in a 9X13 pan, I placed my chicken on a foil-lined rack, flipping it halfway thru to try to maximize crispiness and not lose that wonderfully-flavorful breading. End result was a fork-tender, terrific hunk of poultry, that tasted great on its own, but would be equally nice over a salad, rice, pasta, or w/ spaghetti sauce.

The Best Parmesan Chicken recipe I've tried!  So simple with great flavor.  I do marinate my chicken before cooking and I only cooked 3 breasts for 30 minutes.

I was really disappointed in this.  I know it's not traditional chicken parmesan - but it's not even in the same league.  I thought the flavors were off on this.

This was super easy! I used full breasts (boneless and skinless) Cut them in half and cooked at 425 for 20-25 minutes. Best chicken I have ever made. My girls LOVED it, so did I. This will definately make into a meal rotation. Restaurant quality flavor

Delish! I loved this recipe. It is an incredibly easy dish to make. I took the advice made by other reviewers and baked the chicken for 45 minutes and it came out perfect and moist. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have cloves of garlic, so in the butter, I sprinkled garlic powder in it instead. Also, I left out the oregano because I didn't have any around. I added slightly more parmesan because you can never have enough of that! Chicken was absolutely delicious. I did expect it to be more crispy but it was more soggy on the outside... but it's fine because I still loved it and so did everyone else who tried it. Must try! very easy recipe!

Loved it!  I have 3 teenage boys and a picky husband - they all loved it.  Tasted delicious and juicy.  I left it in the oven for exactly 50 minutes - didn't overcook.  It was also easy to prepare and didn't take any frying (which I hate).  This will be a new favorite.

I chose this recipe just to try something new.  My family enjoyed it.  I think it was good but not great.  I didn't use fresh herbs which I'm sure makes a difference.  I'm sure I'll use it again when I need something quick and easy.

This recipe was delicious! I really enjoy baked breaded chicken but sometimes it seems too plain. This recipe gave baked chicken a nice kick and flavor! I didn't have all the spices separately so I used 6 tablespoons of italian seasoning and I used crushed up Ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs. My sister couldn't stop talking about how good it was!!

This was good. It wasn't like"KFC crispy", but I am GLAD I did NOT add the extra butter to the dish as some sugg. Wouldn't have been that much crisper, and would have been SUPER unhealthy. I used dried herbs as I didnt have fresh on hand. I think next time I will try another type of cheese to play with the flavor. Oh, and I cut mine into strips and only baked for 35-40 minutes. If you like a more muted flavor try italian BC and minus the herbs.

I have made this on a couple of occasions.  I fell in love the first time I tried it.  I love Parmesan Cheese so when I came across the recipe I knew there was a good chance I'd like it.  And baking verses frying is ALWAYS a plus.  Anywho...  I was SO IMPRESSED!  My 19 & 20 year old offsprings (who can be difficult to please sometimes, since they have so much access to fast food) really enjoyed it and had seconds if memory serves.  Mine is a little bit different from this recipe however.  I don't cook anything on the stove.  I put a stick of butter in the 9 x 13 casserole dish and place it in the oven for about 5 minutes to melt.  I season the meat with salt, pepper & seasoned salt, then dip it in 2/3 cup of milk, and roll it around in a mixture of 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of Shredded Parmesan cheese, 2 tbspn dried chives n 2 tbspn dried basil leaves, salt & pepper. Once meat is covered with the mixture.  I press them in the butter in the casserole dish and bake uncovered on 350 degrees F for 45 to 50 mins.  Talk about comfort food...  Just make yourself comfortable because you will be happy when you're done.  I think it looks good too!  The next time I make it maybe I will give it enough time to cool and I can take some pictures to post on the site.  Before I knew it they were half gone, and I made extra this time.

Great!  Skipped the garlic/butter mixture.  Just rubbed the chicken with flour, then egg, then the bread crumb mixture.  Also cooked it on a cookie cooling rack on top of the cookie sheet so the bottom of the chicken didn't get soggy.  It ws perfect!!!

This recipe is amazing!  I used Italian bread crumbs, and didn't have to add the thyme basil or oregano..and also used a little more parm. cheese.  My husband and kids loved it!  I had 1/2 a breast left out of 6...and cut it up the next day and put in a salad...AMAZING!

This is one of my favorite recipes to use with chicken breast. It's very easy but tastes wonderful. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added more parmesan cheese and bit more spices than what the recipe called for.  This added much more flavor.  To help keep chicken moist I poured the extra butter around the edges...all and all a wonderful, easy dish. My boyfriend, the picky eater, loves it!

Herb flavor just too strong. Cut chicken breasts into strips. Didn't turn crispy at all. Perhaps because I baked at higher temperature for shorter time (was roasting potatoes in same oven). Not terrible, but I wouldn't follow the same recipe again.

Very tastey.  My husband asks me to make all the time.  I've even used the crispy shake & bake crumbs in stead of the bread crumbs - love that version better.  Tried on chicken & pork chops, both are great.

It was good, except I followed other people's advice on adding the remaining butter/garlic mixture to the baking dish - it didn't turn out crispy.  My husband asked me to stick to shake & bake.  :)

This was a wonderful recipe.  The only changes that I made were: 1. I used and egg wash versus butter. 2. I used crushed Grape Nuts cereal instead of the bread crumbs.  They were a huge hit!

Excellent recipe, very tasty!
A good quality parmesan is what pulls it all together.

When I didn't have all the other ingredients on hand, I've substituted whatever works, for example:  Tone's Italian seasoning for the fresh herbs (it includes oregano, marjoram, thyme, basil, rosemary and sage), EVOO for the butter in the sauteed garlic (add a splash of white wine for more flavor), and crushed bagel chips for the bread crumbs.  Improvise and have fun!

This was wonderful - I did substitute corn flake crumbs for bread crumbs, which I do quite often because I think they have so much more flavor and I did sneak in a just a bit more parmesan but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will definately make this again.  The fresh herbs are great!

Happily surprised at how moist the chicken was after baking, also, the crust is very tasty, not bland at all. Used a poultry mix of herbs that is available in our grocers herb section instead of looking for individual herbs (sometimes seasonal). The wine addition to the garlic is great too.

This chicken was sooo moist and tender! My family loved it! I don't like chicken breast because they always come out dry(maybe it's me?!)I thought I'd try this recipe out because it sounded good and had such a high rating.  The flavors were wonderful. What a difference the fresh herbs made. The chicken was bursting with flavor.  My son who also doesn't like chicken breast, wanted me to show him how to make it. We all gave it thumbs up! I will be making this often! Great recipe!

Delicious! The only changes I made were to add rosemary and used 1/2 cup of Parm instead of 1/3. Also used another reviewer’s idea to pour the remaining garlic butter around the breasts in the pan. Came out very juicy and flavorful. Family loved it.

I used chicken thighs, Italian seasoning mix instead of fresh herbs, Mrs Dash Garlic seasoning with the butter and garlic, seasoned panko with a little seasoned bread crumbs mixed with it. I read the reviews while it was cooking and seen the suggestion to cook it on a rack so that both sides are crispy so half way through I turned and put it on a rack. Definitely a good idea.  Didn't really taste the cheese, would probably add some mozzarella next time. Will make again.

The flavor was great and the chicken stayed nice and moist. Used dried seasonings as well so followed other's instructions and used 1 teaspoonful of each. Next time I will use less butter or perhaps olive oil as mentioned as well. I felt it was a bit greasy.

This tasted great and was EASY! I will try as others suggested next time and refrigerate the tenders  after coating with bread crumbs and butter to see if this gets them crispier. I would eat them again as they are - yum!

Very good and SUPER easy. I put the rest of the butter in the pan and it ended up being too much.
I covered it with foil and when it was done I broiled it for a couple of minutes to let it get a little extra crispy and it was perfect! I love easy recipes :)

I   used dried herbs. So I cut the amount of herbs in half. 
Like a lot of reviewers, I added the rest of the garlic butter to the baking dish. 
A big hit. Hubby and my picky teenage daughter both asked for this to get into the meal rotation.

This chicken is delicious! I used converted amounts of dried spices instead of fresh, and baked the giant "chicken breasts on steroids" from Sam's Club at 450 (yes, that's a 4) for about 45 minutes to internal temp of 165. Will definitely be making again. I think I'll try spraying the chix with butter flavored cooking spray and adding garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture and see how that turns out.

This  dish is DELICIOUS.  My husband usually only eats one chicken breast win I fix baked chicken.  He ate 2.  And the chicken is so moist, it almost melts in your mouth.  Great chicken dish if you are having people over for dinner

This has turned into a favorite. The first time I made it, I followed the original recipe and my picky daughter loved it. Since then, I have increased both the parmesan and the garlic to meet our preferred taste. I have also used cornflakes crumbs to make it gluten free for my mother in law, and have always gotten good reviews

These were very good!  I did use garlic powder in the melted butter and seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Very flavorful and actually  crispy.  I'll definitely make these again.  I used bone-in skinless thighs and baked at 375 for about 50 minutes.

It was good, I think next time I may only use the oregano seasoning.  I did not care for the thyme and basil.  It seemed over seasoned for out taste buds.

The outside was crispy. The chicken was juicy. Great flavour. It was so easy. This recipe is a winner.
I swapped out the herbs for a couple of teaspoons of steak spice - delish!

Was almost inedible because I only tasted the thyme, basil, and oregano- I'd half these ingredients.  Also needs more butter and little garlic in the pan to not be so dry- But I would definitely try to do this recipe again.

I made this chicken for dinner exactly as shown in the recipe except that I had thinly sliced chicken cutlets instead of boneless half breasts. I reduced the cooking time to 17 minutes and I sprinkled the  chicken with a little paprika before cooking. It adds some color. There were zero leftovers. Highly successful at our house.

I made this for my 5 and 7  year old sons, and they loved it.  I cut up the chicken prior to coating the pieces into large chunks.  After I sautéed the garlic and butter together, I just tossed all the chicken into the pan and stirred around.  Then I tossed them into a bowl of the bread crumb mixture.  Will make again!

Chicken was moist but only cooked it about 35 minutes.  Too  much butter and I didn't love  all the spices.   Easy enough recipe and will definately tweak it if I make it again.

Made this a couple times in the last month. The first time I halved the recipe because I just had two large chicken breasts and didn't want to make the trip to get more. It doesn't half the best. It was tasty but the flavours seemed too strong. I still really enjoyed it so I knew I'd have to try it a second time following the recipe properly, and of course that time turned out much better. I think it doesn't need quite as much better as is called for, and I'd be inclined to throw in a little extra cheese into the coating, but it was a very tasty meal, and made great leftovers as well.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight. It is fabulous! The best, most moist, most delicious chicken ever. The cook time is pretty accurate, but I did need more of the butter and bread crumb mix to prep the chicken. I also used fresh grated parmesan. Bottom line, this recipe will make everyone happy! My husband isn't even a parmesan fan and he loves this recipe, and the kids gobble it up.
Thanks!

I would cut down a bit on the butter next time. I also poured the remaining over the chicken before baking. My grandkids really liked it and asked for more including the two year old.

Simple and delicious. A "Mom's menu" crowd pleaser that will make super versatile leftovers. Definitely going to be on my go-to for when I just want to throw it together.

This was so delicious and smelled so good cooking, my cats sat by the stove!  I made my own breadcrumbs and used dry Italian seasoning because that's all I had on hand.  Also used breast tenderloins to cook faster and soaked them in the butter and garlic while I was making the crumbs.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Really Tasty recipe.   I did add a little extra Parmesan to the mix, as a personal preference.  Instead of using a baking dish I melted the butter with garlic in my favorite cast iron skillet.  After coating the chicken I placed in back in the skillet and put in right in the oven.  Gave it a little extra crunch.  Also, for the last minute I melted some mozzarella and put it under the broiler to melt down.  Served with marinara and angel hair pasta and a caesar salad.

I made it exactly like the directions said. It was good. The edges and the bottom that got crispy were the best. After reading reviews, I think I will put the left over butter and garlic in the bottom of the pan before baking next time.

Made this as a way to jazz up baked chicken on a week night.  Very simple.  I used all dry herbs as it was a last minute bake and the taste was still good.  I'm sure it's even better with herbs.  Very moist!

I used dried herbs instead of fresh. Just a bit more than a pinch of each. This was absolutely delicious & so simple, I made it in record time.  My husband loved it. The extra was wonderful on salad the following day. So many options with this tastey dish. Make it simple or fancy by varying the sides.

The kids ate it quickly, which means it was  a hit.  Easy to make.  I didn't have enough butter, so I used part olive oil and it tasted great.  I also used Italian breadcrumbs and a little less spices to compensate.

I used Italian style bread crumbs, so I did not add the "herbs" and it turned out GREAT.  Only baked it for about 45 min. My skeptical family  was very impressed.  Easy and yummy, this recipe is a keeper!

We Loved this recipe!! Even my super picky husband who normally doesn't like chicken breast meat. Had to change the recipe just a bit to make it gluten free, which I did by using corn flake crumbs in place of the panko bread crumbs. Will definitely be making this again.

I rated 4 stars as written, 5 with changes: the only spices I used were garlic salt and powder along with panko breadcrumbs and the parmesan cheese. I melted the butter and chopped garlic (from a jar) in the pan I was cooking it in. Easy as can be.
I also used chicken tenders. My fussy eater said it was the best chicken he ever had :) gotta love that!

I only had chicken tenders on hand so used those with the recipe as stated.  The meat was tender, but the outside was not crispy at all.  Used commercial bread crumbs--they are finely ground.  Was that the problem?  They just were kinda gooey on the outside.  Good taste, not good texture.

My teenage son always complains about anything that's not fast food. He immediately said, "I hate parmesan chicken" - having never tried it. Then I made it. Then he had THREE servings! Victory is mine, for now.

Made as written.  Very tasty!  Next time I'll skip the salt, as the Parmesan is plenty salty.

So with mine, i did not have bread crumbs or crackers. So my substitute for that was honey nut cherrios and i mashed them as much as i could. It turned out amazing. I also put a little more of the spices and a lot of parmesan cheese. If you dont have bread crumbs i would suggest cherrios.

Great recipe - easier & quicker than indicated.  I used 1/2 the butter amount & it was plenty.  I also filleted the chicken breasts so I had more, thinner pieces.  And no breadcrumbs on hand, so I used crushed whole wheat crackers.  Finally, used 1 tsp. Italian seasoning instead of indicated spices.  Baked for about 20 min on 400 convection bake as that is what the oven was on for roasting broccoli.  Turned out delicious. moist inside & crispy outside.  Even my chicken hater liked it & everyone else loved it.  Will make again!!

Used chicken tenderloins and 1tsp each basil and oregano.  Next time will up the cheese and totally omit the oregano.  Zero leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I prepared this dish yesterday.  Used dried spices, as I had no fresh ones.  When I make it again (yes, I said WHEN), I will use 1/2 the spices it calls for and NO salt, as I found the salt from the Parmesan cheese was sufficient.  I have tried several Parmesan Chicken recipes and this was good, just a bit overpowering with the dried spices.  Loved the fresh garlic and butter!

Good recipe but you definitely don't need 2tbs for the spices, next time I'll probably only use 1tbs and Italian breadcrumbs.

Ok. Wow!!! Best meal I've ever made for myself! So, I'm a busy single woman who rarely cooks for herself. Tonight I decided to use the chicken in my freezer and found this recipe. Threw together the ingredients in just minutes and threw it in the oven to bake while I finished work. INCREDIBLE! Side salad (see pic) and a nice glass of Cab and I'm one happy girl! Thanks for sharing this great keeper of a recipe.

This is the BEST baked chicken recipe ever! My toddler and infant both love it, as does my meat and potatoes husband. I poured the remaining butter in the pan, as a previous reviewer recommended, and I put a 1 to 1 ratio of breadcrumbs to Parmesan. It is an amazing leftover too! Enjoy!

My Mom used to make this for my brother and I since it was a quick and easy after school dinner. I'm away at college and today I really wanted to try out an old favorite so I texted her this recipe she said it was exactly the way she made it so I saved it. One word-AMAZING! I followed everything to a tee, except the time and the breadcrumbs. I cooked it for 30 minutes and that was the right amount of time for me. I used Purdue boneless skinless chicken breast and they come thinly sliced so that helped to make sure the chicken was cooked evenly. Otherwise, I would recommend tenderizing the meat. For the breadcrumbs, I used the Panko brand. I also drizzled the extra garlic/butter sauce over the chicken before putting it into the oven and that really helped to bring out the flavor. Brought back lots of childhood memories!

This was delish! I plated it on a bed of spaghetti w/ marinara and included a side of Green Beans with Blue Cheese-allrecipes.com recipe (I used Feta instead and sauteed the walnuts in the butter/garlic mixture). It was an awesome meal!

This recipe is in our weekly rotation, it's so good! I've added an extra clove of garlic and about a teaspoon of garlic powder in the breadcrumb mixture just so you really get that garlic flavor. I also drizzle the rest of the garlic butter mixture on top if the breaded chicken right before I put in the oven. Goes great with pasta tossed in garlic-infused olive oil & a glass of Chardonnay. :) cheers!

I make this same dish, but I use Italian bread crumbs (Progresso) and skip the herbs. Also, I turn the chicken over half way through the baking.  Great with potato salad!Garland

Tasty, I would have given it 4 stars but because I only used about 1/3 the amount of salt (I was concerned the saltiness of the cheese would be plenty, & I used regular salted butter)I believe had I used the full amount of salt called for in the recipe it would have made the dish too salty that's why I knocked my rating down to 3 stars. I also didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so used 1/3 the amount of dried amounts of thyme, oregano, & basil (1/3 dried is a common substitution for fresh) & the amount of herbs was just fine (some reviewers said the herbs were very overpowering, so I wonder if they used dried herbs in the same amount as the recipe calls for fresh). Not a super spectacular dish, but I was serving it alongside an eggplant parmigiana recipe that I wanted to take center stage, so the chicken was more of a side dish here.

So good. I used gluten-free crumbs instead of dry bread crumbs. Turned out great. Husband liked it too. Served it with wild rice and steamed broccoli.

First time I have to diss a recipe.  Used fresh basil and oregano, and the only difference as written was my use of dried thyme.  Garlic in the hot butter didn't sit right with any of the 5 who ate this, although we are all  garlic fans.  No parmesan taste, although it's the first ingredient in the title.  Throwing the recipe into the trash can, and gave it 2 stars only because the chicken was moist.

I have tasted better. I thought the bake time was too much. The chicken was cooked through within 30 min. I also cut some of the chicken into 'nuggets' for the kids. Tasty but not great.

Pretty good recipe.  I didn't have fresh herbs and spices and I'm sure that would have made it better but the chicken was a little overcooked, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I will make it again and follow others' advice and cook it for less time and maybe add the butter mixture to the chicken as well as more parmesan too.  That should make it 5 stars.

This turned out great! I slit mine first and stuffed with smoked Gouda and chopped fresh portabello mushrooms. I too drizzled the remains of the butter/garlic sauce. Cooked half way covered and other half without!Very, Very tender and juicy. This is a keeper!

I have made this several times. My 2 1/2 year old son and I love it. I do down scale the recipe as it is only for my son and I, but I need to make sure I make enough because he always asks for more. I usually pour the rest of the garlic butter sauce over the chicken before I bake it. I like garlic a lot. I recommend making this recipe. You will enjoy it!

This is an easy and delicious dish to prepare. I added the left over butter to the dish for baking and used it as a sauce on the side for pasta or the chicken.  I also cooked it for approx 45min.  Thank you

I thought it was delicious!  My picky eaters said it was too much spice (not hot just spice).  Next time I would either use fresh spices like it calls for or use less dried spices.  I also poured the left over butter mixture in and the chicken was tender & juicy.  Then as an extra I made onion rings with my left over breadcrumb mixture (now my picky eaters downed those in no time - didn't complain about the spices there!)

Great kid friendly recipe.  Season the chicken well with salt, pepper and garlic powder for better flavor.  I also used dried herbs so I more than halved the amount added.  Finally, pound out your chicken for a much faster cook time.

My wife and I loved this! Did I make some changes? Of course, cooking is an art. I substituted Italian Seasoning for the oregano, basil and thyme for convenience. I just sprinkled the herbs and such over the chicken after I coated the cold chicken in butter.  Then I patted the bread crumbs onto the chicken.  Flipped the chicken and did it again.  The baking time was accurate, but we broiled it for a minute or so to brown it.  I took what was left in the pan and made a gravy out of it.  Yum!  Served with a salad and rice.

Very easy and delicious!  I am cooking for one, so I adjusted the recipie to two servings and put an extra-thick crust on it.  A side of Angel Hair pasta with herbs, and a glass of Mezzacorona Pino Grigio and it was a wonderful meal!

I made this because it sounded quick and easy and I didn't know what to do with the chicken in my freezer. I cut up the three breasts into medium sized chunks and then dipped them. I had to use dried herbs (1 tsp dried = 1 tbsp fresh) and a couple pieces came out a little too "herbie" for my taste, I might use less next time. The only downside I saw to this recipe was waste. I didn't want to pour the remaining butter into the pan so it got tossed, and there was quite a bit of breadcrum mixture to throw away as well. All in all, I will make it again. It was tasty and easy.

This recipe is fantastic! Chicken breasts are usually dry but these came out amazingly moist. I poured the extra butter and bread crumbs over the top before baking and added extra parmesan cheese. The whole family love it!

My husband is the fussiest eater I have ever known.  He especially picks apart anything that is new to his underdevloped palate.  I made this for him, and I was really skeptical that he would like it because of the fresh herbs.  Shockingly, his response was:  "Better keep this recipe because the flavor is perfect!"  I have never had a response like that from him in 16 years, and I cook every single day.  Mr-I-hate-leftovers-and-never-serve-me anything-twice had Baked Parmesan-Crusted Chicken for dinner last night, lunch today, and he has enthusiastically agreed to having it for dinner tonight.  Last night we had it with buttered noodles and sauteed green beans.  Tonight I am putting a thin layer of mozzarella cheese over the chicken and serving it with a side of spaghetti and sauce.   One thing that I did that was slightly different than the recipe was I used far less thyme and oregano - just under 1 tablespoon each - because 2 tablespoons each struck me as excessive.  I did use the full 2 tablespoons of basil, tho.  I didn't turn cartwheels over it, but I thought it was good.

I have made this a couple times & have it saved to my recipe box. It is hard to find anything to make for dinner for my boyfriend who is an extremely picky eater. Every time I have made this for him I get huge compliments on how good of a cook I am and he says it is delicious. Thank you for making dinner time easier for me. :) I also found this dish to be very good also

This was fantastic! I didn't think about it too much when choosing the recipe, I just needed a protein to go with another recipe I was making from this site, but this was the all star!! The boys gave it two thumbs up. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

This was so great! I stuck to the recipe except for taking it out of the oven at 45 min instead. And just a minute before taking it out I covered the tops in parmesan... yum!

This chicken was out of this world!!! We loved it! We will be making it again; probablly on a weekly basis. The only change was we added more cheese. It turned out juicy and crispy at the same time; wonderful recipe! Thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  It's a 'do-over' many times.   I didn't have  bread crumbs so i used saltine crackers.  Worked like a charm.

We all enjoyed this recipe very much.  I used dried thyme, basil, and oregano (instead of fresh) to save money.  Oh, and I quadrupled the garlic (yet again :-)  The breasts were tender and flavorful.  I served them with scalloped potatoes and green beans -- a very nice Sunday meal...

Very good recipe. My husband loved it. I made a couple slight changes. I cut down the amount of spices and added some rosemary and onion powder. Also I used a little more parmesan cheese than it called for. Will definitely make again.

We really liked this recipe.  I followed it exactly as written.  I had all the fresh herbs growing in my garden which was really great.  The chicken came out very moist and tender.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for such an easy and great recipe.

Family loved the chicken!  I even forgot to put the parmesan in the bread crumb mixture.  Family still loved it.  Chicken was very moist, my chicken is usually dry.  This was very good.  Daughter even took left overs to school for her lunch.  She told me that this recipe is a keeper, and make it again soon.  I am making it again, this time I won't forget the parmesan cheese.  The family will love it even more!

I didn't really care for this recipe. The spices were overpowering, and I really did not like the overall taste. My fiance usually goes for seconds, but passed on this one.

Delicious and simple!  Even my 3 year old, who often chews chicken for about 20 min. and still can't swallow it, loved it!  "Mmmm Mommy, dat's good stuff!" he said...think I'll try half the butter, too, since I had lots left over.

I melted the butter in the backing dish, and just left the excess in with the chicken.  I don't know that I'll do that again.  The chicken was very moist and delicious.  The tops stayed a little dry and didn't brown like I hoped, but still a good recipe I'll us again.

This recipe was really good. I made the chicken, and then cut it up and added it to a salad. The only thing I would do differently would be to cut the oregano in half and to double the cheese, otherwise it was great.
