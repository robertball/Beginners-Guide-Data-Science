Just a word of caution, as the amount of lemon juice that 1 lemon will yield will depend on the size of the lemon, and how juicy of a lemon that you are using. In hindsight, I'd use 1-1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice. My lemon was pretty big, and yielded probably close to 1/3 cup of juice, which was too much. I did end up adding a bit more flour, so the dough wasn't so wet (probably 1/4 cup more). Also, if your dough is sticky, when you coat them in the powdered sugar, the sugar will absorb, and you won't get a pretty "crackled" look. On my second tray, I had to re-dip them in the powdered sugar because while the first tray was baking, the second tray ones had absorbed quite a bit of the powdered sugar. These are a tasty cookie, more cakey than chewy though.

This is a very cakey soft cookie.  I used 2 TBSP of fresh lemon juice as my lemon was huge and I was concerned the batter would be too thin.  That seemed to be the perfect amount.
It took my oven 15 minutes on convection set to 350f. (325)

These are delightful.  I followed the recipe exactly, double checked to see how they should be spaced on the parchment.  The recipe doesn’t state, but my first tray showed that they REALLY spread!  Made the second batch much smaller and they came out beautifully, lightly browned around the edges and didn’t run together.  I also learned not to shake off too much powdered sugar from the top.  If you like the photo,  you won’t get that result if you shake off the powdered sugar and just leave it lightly dusted. I kind of piled it on.

Followed the recipe and the comment about 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice. My cookies melted! Came out flat as pancakes. So disappointed since I love making chocolate and even ube crinkles.

Very good, but I do not understand the point of the lemon and vanilla extracts...it's a lemon cookie and you have a wonderful lemon!  (And um didn't have it anyway). Several reviewers mentioned using 2 Tbsp of lemon juice.  I upped it to 1/4 cup and took out the extracts.  Don't try to skip out on chilling the dough!  I didn't smash mine down but just rolled balls of dough in the sugar, and they still ended up perfect crinkle puffed up lemon cookies.  Delicious!
