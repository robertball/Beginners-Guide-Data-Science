Absolutely will make this salad again. The dressing is outstanding - gourmet dining at home. I seriously considered foregoing rest of the meal and eating only salad but wouldn't you know, everyone else wanted some too.

Just made this tonight. It was a great side dish for grilled steak. I did make some changes though; I used splenda instead of sugar (I can't have sugar), I used cucumber instead of mushrooms b/c I didn't have any on hand, and before I served it I sprinkled on some crumbled low fat feta cheese. Next time I'll omit the thyme since I'm not a big fan of the herb. Terrific addition to my recipe box.

This is a wonderful change of pace for a salad with a meal.  The whole family enjoyed this one.  New to us and very interesting.  Excellent.   Will make it again.   Thank you.

Delicious salad.  Loved the dressing (didn't add the sugar though).  I used a small amount of white onion instead of scallion and added chopped green pepper.

I was surprised by how much everyone liked this recipe.  I did not have the lemon pepper or the Italian seasonings so I improvised & used Greek seasoning.  I did add a bit more vinegar for a bit more punch.  I used broccoli & cauliflower, mushrooms, onions & tomatoes.  I don't think you need to cook the brocoli first, I wouldn't next time, it made them a odd color.

This was very tasty - I made substitutions based on what was in the
refrigerator - no mushrooms which I will
try next time, added diced celery instead
of celery seed, diced red onion, and
Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing
because it had the soy oil, lemon, and
vinegar in the ingredients, no sugar, and
sprinkled the seasonings to taste and chilled.  I will make this again.

Great salad! I made it without the onion and added just a touch more vinegar. The whole family (kids too!) went back for seconds!

I thought it tasted a bit bland so I added some vinegar and salt to it which definitely helped.

This has become one of our favorite salads.  The dressing is fabulous!  I like to add lightly steamed cauliflower as well. I generally use grape or cherry tomatoes cut in half as they tend to be more flavorful than the large tomatoes.
