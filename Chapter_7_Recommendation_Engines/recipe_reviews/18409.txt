I had leftover garlic mashed, so I used those, and left out the corn syrup. These were EXCELLENT with a little ketchup. My three year old ate 3 by himself! (can't beat fried mashed potatoes!)

We used left-over mashed potatoes from Christmas dinner for this recipe. They had a very pasty consistency and a sweet taste that didn't seem right, so next time, we will omit the flour, 1 egg, and the corn syrup.

I made these for my family last night and was delighted with the results -- within seconds they were completely gone!  I have yet to find a snack which required such little prep time, and which yielded such amazing responses from my family! Thank you Ellen for making dinner fun again!

OUTstanding...if you had problems with the recipe it might be because you were recycling mashed potatoes that had lost some water. Also, I used more oil in the cooking process...about one inch deep at 350 degrees. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter....LOVE IT!

Being of German decent, I always look for "Potato" Pancakes. Ellen's caught my eye; glad it did. Great recipes, however, I made a slight change to it. Instead of using 1 cup milk, I increased it to 1-1/2 cup to make the mixture thinner. At first, I feared one onion would be too much but after the pancakes were fried, we tasted only a hint of onion - just enough to add some zest to the recipe. Thanks, Ellen, for sharing this recipe with AllRecipe readers. God bless you.

This was a big disappointment. The pancakes were extremely doughy and heavy, and didn't have much appeal with the family. But at least we used up the leftover mashed potatoes!

Loved these, thought they were a great use for some leftover mashed potatoes I had in the fridge.  I used my garlic mashed potatoes and served them with honey butter.

My son and I made these for a quick late night dinner. I had been looking for a long time for a good recipe and this is it. I did make a couple of changes. I omitted the corn syrup and nutmeg. I also added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. These turned out perfect. We topped them with sour cream and I am planning on making another batch right now. We used left over pancakes for a modified eggs benedict. We topped them with canadian bacon, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. So delicious.

I thought that the nutmeg was too much for this recipe.  They cooked too fast for the temperature given in the instructions and did not cook all the way through.  Gross.

This was fantastic *****! Made it with left over garlic mashed potatoes from turkey dinner for Christmas morning breakfast, it is just the boyfriend and myself so I cut the recipe in half and also had to use margarine rather then shortening because I did not have any on hand. I also used half whipping cream and half milk. ummm so good.

I added some ricotta when I mixed it! Got rid of my leftover cheese and mashed potatoes and it went very well with bbq ribs.

Best potato pancakes we ever tasted - the whole family agrees!  Very moist but not soggy, slightly sweet with hint of nutmeg - yum!

I used this recipe as a sounding board for a way for my vegetarian daughter to enjoy a similar dinner as the rest of the family, on a night I was making Crab cakes.  I used sweet potatoes and added green onion, curry powder, salt and pepper with only a tablespoon of flour and one egg.  Mixed together and then coated them in panko and fried them in olive oil until crispy.  She sprinkled them with Louisiana hot sauce and said they were delish and would make them again at her house.

this recipe is very similar to an old German one I grew up with.... the only thing My grandmother and mother did different was no nutmeg in the recipe and the pancakes taste best topped with apple sauce. I will try this recipe out and see if it tastes like my grandma's.

I made these in a pinch with instant potatoes and everyone enjoyed them. I omitted the spices and corn syrup and added a bit of extra milk and green onion in addition to the white onion and some onion powder, since my husband loves these oniony.

I made the potato cakes with left over potatoes in my fridge. My family loved them and with everything that you add to them I had left over batter to make more in the next couple of days. They were definately a hit. They were spectacular served with some sour cream!

I made these to use leftover mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe except I needed to add more milk for a better consistency. They were okay, but I would not make extra mashed potatoes just to have them.

I found this recipe to be very good.  The only drawback are the calories.  But my kids loved it, plus I too was able to use the left over mashed potatoes.  I would definately make this again!

Great change of pace.  Used leftover mashed potatoes, substituted whole wheat flour, and skipped the corn syrup simply because I did not realize we were out of it.

My family enjoyed them.  The sweetness didn't overpower the recipe and we didn't find them pasty as some others have said.  Made them thin with a crisp.  Will try them again.

These were pretty good.  Made them with leftover mashed potatoes.  I would leave out the syrup and nutmeg next time and just make them savory.
