Had half a watermelon in the fridge and wanted to try something new, this was delicious! Served it with bbq chicken and mexican rice.  I recommend dissolving the sugar in the vodka first.

Refreshing, fun summer party recipe! We really enjoyed this and all agreed that the alcohol/sugar/mint ratio is perfect. Be careful though, you can not taste the vodka :) This will be a repeat many times before the summer party season is over. Thanks for sharing, Paul.

Once a month we have a gathering of friends to watch movies under the stars with.  As we were showing "Jaws", I decided to offer this as a beachside treat and boy did it work magic.  The vodka lulled the most unsuspecting movie goer into a relaxed state right up until the shark appeared!  Thanks Paul for the treat!

Simple, fresh and a great adult twist on simple weekend watermelon. I used the fresh mint from my garden, which made it that much more delicious.

Great for a summer day!  I was skeptical about this at first, but the risk panned out!  Very tasty!

I went to a summer event today where we all bring food to share. This was a huge hit......everyone enjoyed it. Since I had a partial watermelon I adjusted the sugar and vodka to suit. I raided the fresh mint  my friends garden so next year I'll grow my own (in a pot) with this recipe in mind.....

Do not let the mint scare you! I started adding fresh mint to my cubed watermelon because by the end of summer I was a bit watermeloned-out. Served this version at my birthday party(adults only of course) and we ate an entire watermelon!!! The juice in the bottom of the bowl is the best part.....

I made this watermelon for a party with a bunch of my girlfriends and it was a HIT!  I only had Passion Fruit flavored vodka but it worked out perfectly.  I also divvied up the watermelon chunks into ziploc bags while they were chilling so all the pieces were equally soaked and it was so yummy!  The mint leaves were perfect!

I also took this recipe to several parties last summer...and everyone is still talking about how good this is!  I actually used watermelon vodka, though and left out the sugar.  So refreshing!!

This was very good. No changes or substitutions made. You could not taste the vodka, but I believe it did catch up with me! I would make it again and maybe see how a rum might taste as well.

My mint has gone to seed, but I have several varieties of sweet basil - purple, huge leaf, regular - so I chopped up a bunch of tender basil leaves and used them instead. Fabulous!

Super simple yet very elegant.  The mint is a perfect surprise twist and very refreshing.
