Ms. Snoop, I think you will only find out how they taste by making them.  Don't be afraid to experiment in the kitchen!  If you are still cautious about the port, try making a batch and only adding the port to half or a third of the dough.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for some time but I hesitate to use the port wine, only because I don't want to disguise my two favourite tastes, peanut butter and chocolate.  Has anyone tried this without the port wine?  How much does the port wine affect the taste? Can I successfully make these without the wine?  Comments pse.
