This was down right delicious! The cauliflower smelled great  roasting on its own but the smell that came from the food processor when I opened the lid was divine! I was a little disappointed that it lost its pretty color after it cooked some but I got over it pretty quick when I took my first bite. I only cooked the cauliflower for 10 minutes on the last step to keep it a little firmer how we like it but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this exactly as written except I cut the recipe in half because it's just the two of us. It was definately like nothing I had ever made before. I was really expecting a lot with all the exotic spices. However, when it was all said and done, I found it very bland. It needed some salt for sure. Probably won't make again.

This was a simply and easy dish to make. I served it over plain basmati rice with green beans and carrot. A very “clean” dish! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

I doubled the curry powder and added 2/3 chicken stock. Very good and easy way to make this curry.

This is fantastic! I had plum tomatoes from the garden, used 1 1/2 cups then at the end added some cooked chicken.  Everyone loved it. Thanks

I have tried this twice and loved it both times.  Instead of a jalapeno pepper I used a habenero pepper (without seeds) and used ground cardimom powder since I didn't have ground coriander.  The second time making it I also added some heavy whipping cream and sugar to make it more saucy.  Next time I might try coconut milk instead of the heavy whipping cream.  Overall, this is a great recipe.

Well actually my husband made it because I'm mostly vegetarian. He's been more pescetarian and so added some shrimp to the recipe. With or without this is a super enjoyable meal!

Tasty. I used tomato sauce. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used pork broth from the other days rib boil, but very good. I kept the salt as it was, even though some of the other reviews said it needed more, dr's orders. Good stuff :-)

My husband hates cauliflower. This was a slam dunk! I didn't have any peppers, so I used some chili powder instead. I cut my cauliflower into smaller pieces so that I could get more flavor on them and hide the cauliflower taste from my husband. We later had the leftovers on top of rice and mixed in chicken. Next time I'll probably cook this and add in some carrots, green beans, potatoes, etc. That way it will really taste like the vegetarian dish at our favorite vegan restaurant. Just need to make some naan bread for the side and I'll be in absolute heaven!

Good stuff. Needs more salt. I think part of the salt needs to be added while your sautéing the cauliflower. I didn't have a jalapeño pepper so I used Sanbar powder instead.
