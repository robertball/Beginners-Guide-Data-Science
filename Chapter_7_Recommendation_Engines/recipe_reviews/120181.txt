awesome recipe!  I used a quicker method.  I combined All of the water, sugar and yeast. allow to proof (10 minutes).  Add salt, caraway seeds, both flours.  Allow to rise in warm spot for 1 hour.  divide dough into 4 sections. shape into rustic loaves, rise for 30 minutes and bake.

I have been baking bread for some years now, and have tried many recipes. This one is just one of the all time best.I have a wondermill and milled the rye flour fresh, I stuck with the ingredients measurements just as the recipe suggested, the dough was very sticky, but in the end, turned out the most wonderful tasting bread. If you go to "the fresh loaf" web site it will give you some information for improving the quality of your home baked breads, great site. 
  Also, I am trying this today with one cup more rye flour, I felt this bread needs a touch more rye flavour, but not so much that it loses it's lovely texture. 
 Thanks for this great recipe!!!!!!!

Look no further! This is the one you want. Soft bread and great crust.

I did a couple things different.  I added 4 teasp. wheat gluten and I cut the recipe in half.  I also did not add egg wash to top or the seeds on top, instead I dusted it with flour.

Great with salami, and just as good toasted with butter.

Rye is a favorite here and this is the only one I'll bake.

Loved this one.  Left out the carraway seeds.  Also used 3 cups of whole wheat flour with 4 cups of bread flour (instead of 7 cups all purpose).  Brushed with butter after baking.  I used the shorter baking method another reviewer mentioned.  Made two beautiful loafs.  I'm baking all of our bread now to avoid rising food prices (and high fructose corn syrup!) and I'll be baking this one often.

I really liked this bread, but did make a couple of changes. Increased the rye flour by 1 cup and decreased the wheat flour by 1 cup. Plus made it the standard way, by proofing the yeast in the sugar and water for 10 minutes, then kneading and letting rise til doubled, etc. The dough was VERY moist; I was not able to knead it by hand without adding flour, so I used the KitchenAid with dough hook to knead it.

This is great bread even though I tweeked it a bit.  I always use beer instead of water.  I halved the recipe and used two cups of warm beer(microwave for one minute on power level 8).  I do the dough setting in the bread machine and then half for two loaves and let rise again and bake in pans.  This bread is sticky and I added about 1/2 cup more flower as it was climbing the bread machine and too sticky.

Great bread and gone when it hits the table!

I wouldn't call this a German bread but it sure is a wonderful bread. Much like most American breads this bread is pretty sweet. I think I may cut back on the sugar next time. Something I read on a lot of German websites is to brush yogurt (or buttermilk) over the top before baking for a lovely crust. I did this for the first time when baking this bread and it was amazing. Simply replace the egg with plain yogurt.

This is really great tasting rye bread!  It is not an overpowering rye flavor either.  It is a little time consuming, but definatlely worth it.  I followed the recipe exact and did not change anything and it came out wonderfully.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We really enjoyed this version of German rye bread. The recipe makes four generous loaves that I shared with our neighbors and daughter. I did add one cup of my eight year old sourdough starter and an extra cup of flour, personal preference only. I have the Artisan KA mixer and should have split the dough in half for the kneading cycle as the bowl was so full of dough that my KA started to get hot after 6 minutes of kneading. Thanks from all of us that enjoyed your recipe.

This makes a lot of bread, and I'll most likely cut this recipe in half next time.  I made one long and two round loaves, and formed some of the dough into rolls.  Next time, I'll make some hamburger rolls (I think a burger on a rye bun would be great).  The bread has a nice crust, but a very light interior, just what I wanted. I'm a novice yeast bread baker, and I was very happy with this way this recipe turned out.

Excellent bread.  I liken it to the Jewish Rye bread I have been purchasing.  

I agee with the entry on saving time.  The bread is just as delicious if you use the recommended time saving tips.

Made the quick version of this that someone posted and it was very good.   

I used 3C rye and then did about a 60/40 thing (white to whole wheat) for the  rest of the flour.  I didn't see the point of the sprinkled corn meal on top, but I did it anyway.  I confess that I still don't see the point and wouldn't bother the next time.  I didn't have caraway seeds, but would try that.

This was dense, but still soft and the crust wasn't hard.  Pretty happy with it.

Excellent tip from a previous review about using beer instead of water. I used 24 oz of beer, warmed in the microwave for 1 minute, and added the yeast to the sponge and the rest water later, and it gave it a new dimension of flavor.    I used a stand mixer and only put in half of the dough at a time as to not let it crawl up the dough hook and make a mess, because this sticky dough is hard to clean. Then I kneaded together for a few minutes more. I doubled up on the caraway seeds and put a lot on top too.     While baking I put a pan of water and covered the tops of the bread with liner paper. You can play with these two methods until you get the crust you covet.      Everyone who has had this bread knows it's a winner, especially hot right from the oven.

This bread is awesome but I was very upset that at first glance it looked like entire time to make was 1 hr. I new this had to be a guesstimate since I've made bread before, but I was shocked when it said the initial set up time was 4 hours. I couldn't make it for the dinner party I had planned. The entire prep time should read about 5.5-6 hrs.

Brilliant!  I used a combination of the short version, let it stand for 2-hours, replaced the water with beer, added 1 cup more rye flour and one-less plain flour, and extra caraway.  This is the first bread I have ever made and it turned out perfectly - THANKYOU

This was my first attempt at yeast bread and it turned out very well! I followed other reviewers' advice to go the quicker route with proofing the yeast. I also did 3 cups rye, 2 cups white whole wheat flour, and 4 cups bread flour. Delicious!

This was really good. It was easy and didn't have an overwhelming rye flavor. I also added just a touch of dill to the dough, which gave it an extra little dimension of goodness, lol.

This recipe is terrific! I did this the fast way, adding everything together and using rapid rise yeast. I found I needed to add 1-2 cups more flour than called for, but I also used more rye flour, which may absorb more liquid. After kneading I let this rise for 1 hour, then shaped and let rise 45 min, then 30 min in oven. All in all this took about 2 and a half hours start to finish.

I did a little test and after adding the liquid and flour to the sponge, I put half into the bread maker on dough setting and let it knead in there. The other half I worked by hand. I took the machine dough out after kneading, let them both rise on counter and finished in the oven. The half that was kneaded in the machine turned out much better than the one I did by hand. Anyway just a thought to make it easier.  Oh I did substitute some of the white flour for bread flour and some whole wheat, and added vital wheat gluten. This is the best homemade rye bread I've eaten. Like the other reviewer said "You can stop looking, this is the one you need", and she is right. Thanks for submitting!

Simply delicious! It was our first attempt at a Rye bread and it turned out great. So much so, that my wife made it twice in about week's time. Followed the recipe without any tweaking. We'll be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe. I only made a half of the dough to try it out. Because I like to cook healthy, I used half of the whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 of white one. I also made small oblong dinner rolls since my family loves the crust.

Dear Maryann, We love your bread but it is time consuming. Could we possibly bake it in 2 glass loaf pans and have it raise properly? Mine doesn't raise as it should.  It could possibly be because I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, but I also increased the yeast to 1 and 1/2 rapid rise pkts.  *****

Skipped the caraway so I lost a bunch of flavor there. Without, the flavor is mild but good. The best part of this bread is the crumb - so light but sturdy and a nice chew. I look forward to making this again when I get my hands on caraway.

I used your recipe for a german project in school. My family were the first to try and wanted me to make it again!! I recieved a 98 out of 100 points so I wanted to say "Thank You!!!!" My teacher just came back from Germany and said they were extremely accurate. Thanks again and you've earned me the nickname "Baker"

I love this rye bread.  I happen to love caraway so I doubled it.  As far as the dough goes you don't really have to worry because rye is a wet dough. The more flour you add the worse it will turn out.  I put the entire recipe in one loaf pan and then used it for homemade reubens. Delish!!

Very good, I cut it in half and used barley malt extract and less water, instead of the sugar.I Also put it in a bread pan. did not do the egg wash, just brushed it with water before putting it in the oven, and then again after about ten minutes in the oven. I know the egg wash does make it look shinyand helps hold on the caraway, but the crust was just how I like it, nice and chewy! It was wonderful with Usingers liver sausage. THANKS

Use more rye flour for a MORE rye-ish flavor if you like.  I made a 1/2 recipe, and followed it as written, but for the addition of 1/2 a cup additional rye flour (1 1/2 c total for 1/2 the recipe). I did not cut the yeast amount down much,   I used 2 teaspoons (almost a packet).  I also added a heaping tablespoon of vital wheat gluten. Made one large round loaf, on a pizza stone.  Very nice recipe  :)

Made this exactly as written and it is as good as it gets.  I added caraway seeds because I think they take rye bread "over the top" goodness.  The house smelled great for the entire day too!

I hate to rate things low, but the dough was too sticky and the bread had no rye flavor whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but not like rye. If you are searching for the perfect rye bread recipe, keep searching.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out really good. Next time though I am going to try proofing the yeast and making the bread in a traditional manner. I really do not think this procedure may have been worth the time commitment. We shall see though.

I made this bread but followed other reviews.  I used 24oz of Sam Adams Chocolate bock beer in replace of most of the water.  Also I only had stone ground rye and whole wheat white flour in the pantary witch made this bread very dense.  I think if I would have added more yeast then what was called for it would have turned out a little better.  But, I will be trying this recipe again, it has great flavor.  Now off to the store to get the right flour.

Okay! I still used the stone ground rye flour. I went and bought AP flour. I also followed another review and used 1.5 packets of yeast instead of just a .25 packet.  I still used 24 ozs of dark beer and it really gave it nice flavor. I made this bread for a polish Easter soup.  Thanks for sharing.

Dear Ms.Bonk

You have made us very happy-- the bread was indeed very tasty. I say was because it was eaten so quickly. The rye dough was a bit sticky after four hours so we had to add more flour ,rye and all purpose and then -- success. Many thanks from Talia & Benzi and three kids.

I wanted a rye bread to make with a winter roasted vegie soup. I made this recipe based on the high reviews. It was okay, but tasted more like white bread with a hint of rye. I wasn't overly impressed since I wanted rye bread and not white. Next time I'll look for a rye bread recipe that uses just rye flour, like maybe the recipe on the rye flour box.

i like the taste of it. it's also good with butter and strawberry jam.
