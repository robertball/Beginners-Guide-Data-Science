I made this recipe without the bread crumbs from a recipe I had copied from the June/July issue 2003 of Taste of Home magazine. The recipe is almost identical except for bread crumbs. I seasoned the burger with seasoning salt, pepper and a little garlic salt. If you want a little more kick, your choice of salsa will make a difference.
You may use egg substitute if desired, results are the same. Top with your favorite condiments, vegetables. Enjoy!

I threw everything into the food processor.. cooked up well. I liked the flavor. For my tastes, it needed more seasonings

I have never tried black bean burgers let alone made them at home so I was a little nervous but they turned out great, used the salsa/sour cream (or in my case greek yogurt) mix on the side w/just the black bean patties no bun and they were really tasty and filling. My skeptical fiancee who be-grudgingly has agreed to some meatless meal nights even liked them!

We was not told where to put the bread crumbs, so I'm assuming they would go in with the beans and brown rice.

This turned out phenomenally. I omitted the salsa and added my own seasonings instead (salt, pepper, fresh crushed garlic, chili pepper) and they held together really well and they taste delicious. I'm more of a hamburger girl, but I'll go for these again and again.

The best veggie burger I've made. Very burger like. I too mixed it in the food processor. Also added chipotle flavored panko. Love it!

This is a great recipe for lunch or dinner entrees.   Since I was out of salsa, I added a little Teriyaki, Soy, Worcestershire, and barbecue sauces to spice up the black bean burger mixture. I used 3 slices of 12-grain bread for bread crumbs,  white long grain rice (instead of brown) and used 2 eggs instead of one.  I threw everything (except the rice) into the food processor, which gave me just the right consistency.  I sprayed the pan with a non-stick and cooked the patties on med-low heat, adding a thin slice of extra sharp cheddar cheese in the last couple of minutes of cooking. The veggie burgers were a delicious hit!

I made it exactly the way the recipe called except I did not have plain bread crumbs so I used Italian bread crumbs and I used minute multi grain medley rice.  Added lettuce and tomato.  Served 4 people and we all loved them.  We are meat eaters and was not sure, actually thought it was better than burgers!

I had only 3/4 c. of bread crumbs, and didn't add salsa, and the consistency was perfect for making burgers.  I did add Creole seasoning (1 1/2 t.)  They were delicious.  I added a slice of co-jack on top to melt while the burger was still cooking, served on a toasted bun with mayo and tomato, and they were devoured.  I love all kinds of veggie burgers and also love real hamburgers.  This was very meaty and satisfies the burger craving.  Highly recommended if you're wanting the real thing but just want to eat more veggies & less meat.

Although these taste good, they are very pasty and stick to the roof of your mouth. The tackiness makes them difficult to form into burgers so, overall I wasn't impressed.

way better than i expected. I was out of salsa so I added ketchup and it turned out wonderfully. I served them inside quesadillas and dipped in ranch.

These were really good. I made only a few changes. I had some zucchini, so I saut√©ed it chopped with the onion before mixing everything together. I served the cooked burger on a bed of steamed spinach with sliced tomato and the sour cream salsa sauce on top. When I make this again I will add more seasoning.

The only thing that I changed was using fresh  bread crumbs instead of the dried and added a half of a seeded jalapeno pepper.  It is so good.

I put these in the food processor as suggested and it came out too mushy to form into burgers. The taste is bland and I added both chili powder and cumin.

We thought the flavors were fine, though I added garlic and taco seasoning.  The issue was the consistency.  Maybe the salsa was too saucy or something because we were unable to form patties, just had to drop it into the pan because it was rather runny, and it was hard to flip with a mushy texture inside once crisp and browned on the outside.  Will perhaps try again.

Great base recipe. Would like to try adding mushrooms and walnuts or pecans...
