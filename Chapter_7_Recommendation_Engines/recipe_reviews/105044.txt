Great recipe. I made it "as is" initially but found it was missing that certain-North-African something. Here are my modifications based on the fact I grew up eating and making this dish: 

- Add 1/2 tsp of ground caraway and 1/2 tsp of allspice. This really adds that extra kick for those who are craving Restaurant quality North African cuisine.

 - Don't bother with the saffron in the marination. Saffron is more expensive than gold, and it only releases flavor in liquid (warm water or broth). Using it in the meat marinade just lends color; the flavor (and cost) is lost (the turmeric will give enough). 

- I cooked the onions, garlic and ginger and let them sweat before adding the raw meat; completely skipped the browning process. (We don't brown meat for stews in North Africa). 

- I added homemade beef broth - it's not recommended to use chicken stock if dealing with a lamb dish. This is a big NO-NO in North African cuisine. Disregard my comment if you used chicken! 

- I used preserved lemons instead of the lemon zest indicated in the recipe. These are hard to find based on where you are located; but not hard to make at home if you have time. I used half a preserved lemon, sliced it thinly and added it with the carrots. 

- Lastly, if you have "Harissa", a Tunisian chili paste, I would recommend this mixed with regular tomato paste, over the sun-dried tomatoes. Please NOTE: Harissa is spicy so disregard if you are trying to tone it down.

Delicious!! I prepped everything and let it simmer all afternoon in a slow cooker.  The meat was so tender and flavorful!

Excellent. I just wish I had more time to marinate the lamb - only had a couple hours. But I browned the lamb and then threw everything in the crock pot and it was great. If you happen to be able to get your hands on ras al hanout season blend, you don't have to worry around with all the different spices - just use 2 1/2 tablespoons of that for the marinade, and then add and additional tablespoon and the ginger to the crock pot. Places like Cost Plus carry it really cheap!

Oh YEAH!! Need to up the 'stars' to 10 out of 5 for this! What a fantastic recipe!! This was the first time I had cooked Moroccan for my family but this was the BEST! I bought a jar of Moroccan Seasoning but also added a little bit of each of the spices I had in the cupboard too. Marinated it in the dry spice mix in the fridge overnight. Next morning browned the meat, added the rest of the ingredients to the pot as per recipe, then tipped it all into the slow cooker for 3.5 hrs on high. Added sultanas and pine nuts in final hour. Served over rice as we are not cous cous fans.

Fantastic!! As soon as I mixed all the spices together, I knew this dish would be amazing. I used chicken, as I could not find lamb, and it worked out really well. I also added some cubed yams since I didn't have too much meat. I couldn't wait for this recipe to finish cooking!! The wonderful aromas filled my entire apartment building, and it tasted every bit as good as it smelled. I will be making this frequently. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!Highly recommended!!

Very good!  I didn't include turmeric and substituted garam masala for many of the individual ingredients (cardamom, coriander, cinnamon etc which I did not have on hand).  It still came out well and is really quite easy to make despite the long list.  I added pine nuts for that extra crunch.  The recipe tastes very good with lamb, but lamb is not my favourite meat and I will probably try it with chicken next.

I am blessed with having experienced North African cooking at it's best -- in the everyday households around Morocco. This recipe produced the best tagine I've had outside of Morocco and definitely my best personal effort. I followed "lumiere's" review -- don't brown the meat as that is never done in traditional North African cooking! I haven't made preserved lemons yet, but instead I added juice of half a lemon at the very end -- added it to the broth and stirred gently. A Moroccan tradition (and possibly Algerian and Tunisian?) is to use 7 vegetables: alway onion and the 6 of the following: carrots, parnips, potato, turnip, zucchini, yellow squash, pumpkin or other squash, tomato, green beans -- you get the idea, whatever is fresh and in season. I also substituted chicken for the lamb. I love lamb, but chicken is easier to find than good lamb, which requires a trip to the local halal meat market. I am not a fan of turnips, but just one small turnip will add a rich flavor and if I end up eating it thinking it's a potato -- well, the sauce is enough to mask the strong taste for the most part. :) As they say in Morocco -- b'sahatik! To your health!

I know it looks like lamb in the pic, but it's actually chicken.  The ingredient list was a bit intimidating, but it really wasn't too difficult to make.  Next time, I'll serve this with brown rice.

Amazing Recipe! What flavor - and the aroma... the spices are a great blend.  I'm going to make the spices up in larger quantity to use more frequently.  I added a handful of dried apricots & prunes... definitely will make it again.

This was phenomenal! I made it in my crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours. My father in law went back for THIRDS... and he's Moroccan so it must have been authentic! :)  Changes: I couldn't find saffron at my grocery store so had to omit. I added 2 cups of cubed sweet potato.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really REALLY good recipe! When I make it, I roughly double the recipe, because it is delicious the next day as leftovers, and it's just as easy to make a double batch as a single batch. I serve it with couscous that I add chopped fresh mint and fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest. I'm not too exact with how I measure in my spices because it's the type of recipe you can easily adjust to your own taste. I happen to like a lot of spice so I put in quite a bit. I don't use saffron, since I never seem have any and it's pricey. I use regular tomato paste for the same reason.  I brown everything on the stove top in my heavy enamel-clad iron dutch oven and then I cover it and stick it in the oven to simmer away for the afternoon. I always include the lamb bones, because they add a lot of flavor, and then I just pull the lamb bones out when I serve it. The meat is so soft and tender it just falls off the bone, so pulling the bones out is easy. This recipe makes the house smell fantastic and is a wonderful comfort food to make on a chilly weekend afternoon.

I had all the spices and marinated for a good 12 hours. I browned the meat and then transfered everthing to a crock pot. Cooked it on low for a good 7 hours and it was just perfect (made 2.5 times the recipe). Blend of spices is excellent! Served with a spiced couscous with dried apricots, prunes and some pine nuts. I will definitely make this again.

This dish is unbelievably good. Extrememly flavorful. All the spices blend in so subtly together and nothing overpowers anything else. You get a hint of a different spice with every bite you take. I used chicken thighs and I only let them sit in the fridge for 3-4 hours and it still turned out fantastic. I love this so much I've made up little "spice bags" attached to this recipe to give to my friends. Have heard nothing but raves. Thank you!   **Edit** Aug 13, 2009  The first time I made this recipe, I followed the instructions. I made it again yesterday in my crockpot. I just threw everything in, DIDN'T brown the chicken, carrots and onions. I wouldn't recommend using the crockpot, the recipe lost a lot of flavor.

Phenomenal!  My husband ate until he was sick.  Adjustments I made:  I diced everything to 1/2" to make it easier for my kids to eat and to speed up the cooking process.  I diced the lamb (3 pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed), tossed it in the spices minus the saffron, then browned it in a pan of hot olive oil (no marinading) and put the meat in the crock pot.  Then, I diced the onions and added them to the now-seasoned oil in the pan and cooked them with the garlic until brown and translucent, then added them to the meat in the crock pot.  THEN I added the stock, plain tomato paste, lemon zest, and honey to the onion-y, spicey pan and brought it to a boil, then poured it into the crock pot and added a pinch of saffron.  I cooked it on high for about 4 hours and served it with the raita and Moroccan couscous.  It was SO GOOD I took a picture and put it on Facebook and all my friends swooned.

WOW! First time I attempted to cook lamb and it was amazing.  My husband and dinner guests raved over it.  I will make this again and again and again.  I followed the recipe mostly. I used 2 cups of organic chicken broth instead of one can.  I was secretly hoping my guests didn't want seconds so I'd have leftovers!! Lol

This dish deserves 10 stars!  The scent of the spices is very strong while cooking, but the flavors mellow nicely during cooking.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and did not need to thicken the gravy.  I did have to grind the cardamom and cloves, which is something I don't recommend doing if you don't have to, because the oils seem to have become embedded in my grinder.  This recipe is worth every ounce of effort I put into it, and my husband agrees.  I served it with the Sweet & Nutty Moroccan Couscous (a perfect accompaniment) and green beans.  We will definitely be making this one gain.  Thanks for a great Moroccan recipe!

Loved this!!! Perfect with Sweet and Nutty Moroccan Couscous! Even my picky husband loved this, said this was one of the best meals I had ever made, much better than the meal we had at Epcot's Restaurant Marrakesh.   Will be making again!

This recipe rocks!  We used Shetland lamb which can be tough and gamey and it roasted to perfection with the melange of spices.  I forgot the fresh ginger and the paprika but it still came out great!  My husband added a small handful of apricots as recommended and a nice smattering of mushrooms and peppers which absorbed the cooking liquid and were really nice.  He was really sweet and made this for me when I was at work...he couldn't find the couscous in the cabinet so made mashed potatos instead.  What a treat, the juices and meat on top of the mash were delightful.  What he did differently was put everything into a tagine into a low, low oven about 300F or 150C after he browned the meat.  Cooking time was approximately 4 hours but could have done with less.  Because we don't use a lot of salt I only used 1/2 teaspoon and it was fine.  Putting together the spice rub the night before was amazing...I went to bed with my hands smelling of cinnamon and other good things - even after a good wash!  Just the scent of the spices lifted my mood.  We will make this for company soon - its that good.

Amazing dish! I made this for a small get together and even the pickiest of the group loved it. The lamb comes out so tender it almost melts like butter. I will make this again and again.

Absolutely amazing! This is one of the best things I've ever made! I've made it a few times and the last time substituted chicken for the lamb just because it was cheaper and with all of the spices, you don't really tell the difference. I usually make a huge batch and freeze the rest. This is great served with cous cous! I really love the Moroccan cous cous on this site, but I've found that the spices in that and the spices in this are just too overwhelming together, so I usually just serve it with lightly salted plain cous cous.

I use half beef broth have veggie broth rather than chicken broth (per lumiere).  I also use more fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, cilantro rather than coriander, and buy a nice big 4lb lamb shoulder from Costco and double the recipe.  I add a 16oz bag of dried apricots and serve over brown rice and cry when the leftovers are gone.

Fantastic.  I used rus al hanout instead of listed spices as they were all in the rus al hanout blend with the exception of cardamom, also used preserved lemon in place of lemon zest

Excellent! I added fresh spinach at the end and turned off the burner. Perfect green addition.

Fantastic recipe, very easy and DELICIOUS results. Used with Emile Henry tagine (doesn't need to be seasoned, only boiled with some milk before first use). I added a handful of dried apricots and butternut squash as well to brighten the dish. Served with buttered couscous, dried apricots, and pomegranate seeds. Guests LOVED it!!!  Will definitely make it again and again!!!

I used two lamb shanks and just stewed the meat and onions in the spices and some veggie stock for several hours.  I then added 5-6 carrots, some sun-dried tomatoes, the lemon zest, the honey, some freeze dried apricots, raisins, and at the end, some frozen spinach.  Served over rice, it was delicious.

This meal represents the reason why a 5 star review was invented!  While time consuming and requiring many ingredients, this is a meal of love.  It is layered with flavor and enjoyable.  I served it with the recommended sides and both were perfect pairings. So good!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly and it still came out really good.   I used Quorn chicken pieces instead of lamb.  I added two heaped dessert spoons (about 1/3 cup) of white flour to the bag of spices.   I substituted 1 tsp of garam masala for all the ground spices. I only refrigerated the bag of chicken and spices for about fifteen minutes while I cut up the carrots.   I also substituted onion powder for whole onions. I only cooked the tagine for 45-60 minutes.  Even with all these changes, it was really really good!  I served it with couscous that I made with a chicken stock cube and diced dried apricots.

Although this dish took a long time to prepare and I had to go buy a lot of spices I didn't have in my spice rack, it was very worth it. Loved the exotic aroma and flavours!

We raise lamb in Oklahoma so I'm always looking for great lamb recipes!  I truly think I found the jackpot with this one!  Amazing flavor, color and the aroma is out of this world!  My only adjustment, I replaced the chicken broth with beef and omitted the saffron (didn't have it on hand)!  Thank you for this recipe!

I rarely rave about a recipe, but this one rocks! It's not nearly as difficult as the long list of ingredients implies. I used 1/2 of all the spices, except the salt.  This was still very flavorful without being overpowering.  I served it on jasmine rice cooked in beef broth that was a little on the salty side.  The combination of the rice and this dish was amazing!  The spices went very well with the gamey flavor of the lamb.  Awesome!

very, very good!  the meat is quite tender, spicy but not too hot.  i've tried this recipe with lamb and with pork, both were excellent.  no need to alter the spices, and seems to come out fine if you're missing one or two of the hard-to-find ones.  put crushed peppers or cayenne on the table for those who want more heat.  in the unlikely event that you have leftovers, heat 'em up and serve on hoagie rolls.  yumm.  thank you for this one, it's a keeper!

I love this recipe.  I had bought lamb and had no idea of what I could do with it.  I saw this recipe and the long list of ingredients; since I had all the spices on hand and really wanted  to try something different, I went for it.  

The results were incredible.  I am making a large batch of the spices to have on hand.  It is a my new  favorite spice blend, and works with chicken and sweet potatoes/root vegetables as well.  So good!

OMG, this meal is delicious! Seriously, I just ate dinner, and am already looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow night!  I stayed pretty true to the recipe, except I had to substitute beef stew meat (no lamb available!), and I added in a can of chickpeas and a chopped butternut squash (tips from other tagine recipes). Since I added in extra ingredients, I did 1.5x the spices.  This meal was phenomenal, and my kitchen smells amazing.  This is a recipe I would be proud to pass on to my family and know they would enjoy it as well. Yum yum yum!

This was so good. I do not like lamb, but my husband does, so I made it for him. I loved it. Could not even really tell I was eating lamb with all the spice! I did double all the spices because we like spice. Ended up adding a little more cornstarch than called for because it still wasn't thick with the recommended amount. Recommend getting leg of lamb for this. We got some shoulder stew meat but could barely get anything off the bones to cook.

This was pretty tasty. My husband and I felt it was a little bland and so I think I would add more spice/chiles and maybe a little more salt to it next time. It was much tastier the day after when the spices melded together more.

So fantastic, I would make this for company!  I couldn't find any lamb stew meat at my local market, so I used lean beef stew meat and it worked great.  The meat was so tender and flavorful!  This is a lot easier to make than it looks based on the ingredient list.  The only thing I'd do next time is to add a little more salt.  Other than that, it was perfect.  This is definitely going into my regular rotation.  YUM!

Amazing dish! I've made this several times already. I include a few diced sweet potatos for added texture - it dissolves and thickens the sauce. Delicious flavour!

Made it exactly as written. Allowed meat to marinate overnight. Housemate said eyes were watering two rooms away because whatever I was making was so spicy. After test tasting, I ended up doubling the spices and salt. VERY VERY tasty. Really perfect with the cucumber raita. Thank you SO much for sharing. I am in some kind of culinary heaven right now as I eat this.

I wasn't a member until now, but I simply had to sign up to rate this recipe.  It was fantastic with no modifications!  I also made the suggested Moroccan Couscous (also 5-star) and the Cucumber Raita (I simply don't care for plain yogurt) to go with it.  A great meal if you are looking for tasty lamb!

I've done this twice now, pretty exact to the recipe and its been fantastic.  I plan to make up a larger quantity of the mixed spices and keep them on hand for the future, so Ican whip it up in a jiffy.

Made this using the spices but as a veggie version with 1 400g can chopped tomatoes, 1 chopped aubergine, 1 200g can garbanzo beans, 1 sliced red pepper and a few handfuls of chopped spinach. I roasted the aubergine and added it with the spinach after simmering the rest for 30 mins with a squeeze of lemon juice to refresh it. This was delicious. Thank you. I have added the spice mix to my recipe book.

This is the best recipe I've ever made and I'm not exaggerating.  My guest had seconds and thirds and my husband said it was better than the tagine served at the Tagine restaurant here.  I browned everthing in a pan and then threw it all in the crockpot for about 6 hours.  Near the end of the cooking I added more veggies (peas, zucchini and green beans) and   Hmmm so yummy.

I actually made this recipe with beef stew meat instead of lamb.  It was absolutely fantastic!!!  My wife, who is very picky about beef stew actually loved it as well.  She said that it was much better than the traditional beef stew.  Next time I will try it with lamb.

This was good - but it's missing something. I've never had or made Lamb Tagine so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it needed something else flavor-wise. 

I would probably make it again because of the spices used. Perhaps someone whose Indian food savvy can chime in with a recommendation.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I made it with Lisa's moroccan couscous and cucumber raita and Mic's Naan from this site.  My guests loved it and asked for the recipe.  My husband has already asked me to make it again!  Thanks for the great recipe Lisa!!!

I made this following the advice of the reviewer from North Africa.  No saffron; not needed. No olive oil, just seasoned the lamb in spices (in plastic bag) for 24 hours. No searing, put the lamb in crock-pot with veggies, beef broth, etc.  overnight. Just a bit too greasy so next time I'll trim some fat first.  Served with couscous with lots of sauted veggies mixed in.  I've never cooked lamb before.  The family loved it.  Nix on the cucumber Riata.

This has to be the best lamb recipe! I made it for a Christmas pot luck, and it was soooo good!  Having a dinner party in a couple of weeks, and i have to make it again.  Everyone love it.  I can't think of any way to improve it.  Made in in slow cooker and took it that way. Thanks for sharing it.

Excellent! Sure, it's alot of work and the list of ingredients is long but the flavor is sensational. Well worth doubling the recipe so you'll have leftovers or serve it for a party like I did with a rice pilaf.I cooked it in a roman clay pot and the results were perfect - so tender everyone raved about it.

This dish is fabulous.  Savory and juicy...wonderful aroma and flavors.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but my husband is -- and this dish makes the lamb MORE than palatable for me.  We were tagine novices, and LOVE the cooking implement now.  The meat and veggies come out SO tender and juicy.

This was very good and forgiving. Before starting this recipe I squeezed the juice of 1 lime on the lamb, stirred ,washed it off and patted it dry. This cuts the "gamey" flavor of the lamb. As per another reviewer I used beef broth instead of chicken and omitted the saffron. I used regular tomato paste (sundried tomato is probably better), limes instead of lemons and regular salt. Next time I will double the cayenne pepper and like our old neighborhood restaurant I will add one cup of prunes on the last 20 minutes of simmering. The cornstarch was definitely needed. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was amazing and my hubby loved it. The 1st time I used  bone in lamb shoulder chunks instead of cubes. The 2nd time I used cut up whole chicken. Both times I added 1/2 tsp of allspice and a little extra cumin and salt to the broth. I also left out the ginger cause I don't like the flavor. I used water in place of the chicken broth because the meat makes its own broth then added a little lemon juice along with the zest. Finally I tossed in some fresh chopped tomato, chick peas and potato cubes. I used the broth to cook basmati rice on the side and served with a basic cucumber tomato middle eastern salad and plain yogurt.

This was the first Tagine I ever made. (Every year for Christmas, my family puts all the names of the worlds countries in a hat, and the country we pick is the ethnic dinner we cook that year), yes, this year was Morocco. 

As one of several Moroccan dishes I was cooking this year, I completely forgot to marinade the lamb the night before so it only had about 3 hrs in the spices. That did not matter one bit! The lamb was delicious and so tender it fell off our forks! Going to make this dish again and again...

I liked it fine, couldn't get enough infact, but my husband and daughter couldn't handle the complexity I guess. Also a few of the ingredients were expensive and nearly impossile to find so I had to omit saffron and cardamon and substitute beef for lamb and regular tomato paste instead of sundried tomato paste. I live in a small town and they just dont carry those kind of ingredients around here. I also omitted the cayenne since I'm cooking for an 8 year old. I sould mention that we served it with the cucumber raita (even thought the dish was not hot/spicy (no cayenne) and some plain couscous.

I made this for dinner with my fiance one night and we both LOVED it. It took some time, so read the directions and budget your time accordingly, but it was worth it. The blend of seasonings smelled so great while it was cooking and the taste was amazing. The best part is that if you don't have every single spice mentioned, you can leave out a couple and it still turns out great. I didn't have cardamom or cloves, so I omitted them, and I put a little extra ground ginger rather than getting fresh ginger. I also wanted more veggies, so I added a cup of frozen peas, but I would recommend not adding them at the same time as the carrots and onions, or they get a bit overcooked.

This is fabulous.  You have got to try it.  It is very simple and slight modifications don't ruin the end result, just like it says.  I had 3 lamb shoulder chops that I used, mixed the seasonings and rubbed them into the meat.  I let that sit for about 30 minutes, then seared the shoulders in a hot stainless pan and tossed them in the slow cooker.  I did saute the onions and carrots a little in the leftover brown bits and seasoning in the pan and added the stock to scoop up all of the flavor and poured it all over the lamb in the slow cooker.  It rocked.  My picky husband even ate it.  I used some of the leftover juices to boil a chunk of chicken breast in and chopped it up fine and mashed it with some sweet potatoes for my 1 yr old.  He loved it (it was fabulous).  I modified just a couple of things because I did not have cardamom, garlic powder or sun dried tomato paste.  I just skipped the cardamom and the garlic powder since fresh garlic is used later and I had sun dried tomatoes in oil on hand so I just chopped a hand full of them up and tossed them in.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.  I think next time I'm going to make 2 servings of the seasonings, add the second one to a plastic bag and keep on hand for quick slow cooker dinner that I can toss together in the morning - but I would let the meat marinate over night; lamb or chicken, both were great with these flavors.  Love this recipe.  Thank you!

The flavor was amazing. However the sauce was not thick enough to be authentic. Will probably play with it and get back here for an update.

Mmmmm!  The first time I made this it cost a lot because I had to go buy so many spices.  But after that, it is not a pricey meal to make!  Get good lamb (I like to get it at Whole Foods, even if I spend a few extra $$).  The hallway in our apartment building smelled for a few days from cooking this, but I love the smell so it was no problem for me (hopefully my neighbors liked it too!).

Delicious! Do let it marinate for the full time and simmer for a while--it was pretty delicious when I marinated for 3 hours and simmered for 2, but much better when marinated for 15 hours and simmered for 4!

This was one of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I followed the basic seasoning recipe exactly but substituted leeks for the onions and replaced 4 of the carrots with cut up parsnips and turnips, and also added a large cut up yam.  I increased the spices and broth to account for the increase in the veggies and let the lamb marinade for 48 hours prior to browning.  I then simmered it all for 2 hours in a stovetop dutch oven.  Served it with a side of brown rice.....so good!!!!!  What a great autumn meal. Next time we'll try it using goat meat.  Tnx.

This smelled so good when we were making it but then something felt like it was missing when we finally ate it over couscous. I've never been to Morocco but I've been to a couple Moroccon restaurants in NYC and I found their tagines had more depth. I think it lacked the fruity aspect of typical Moroccan stews so next time I might add some apricots and raisins. Also, my husband cut the lamb down into more like 1 inch cubes and I think he browned them for too long as the meat wasn't very "fall off the bone". Since everyone here is raving about it, I'm definitely going to give this recipe a second try...soon.

I made this along with her couscous and it was fabulous! I've never had this dish anywhere before, so I'm not sure how it compares authentically, but I will definitely make it again someday. The recipe said this makes 4 servings, which might be the case if this is the only thing you eat, but if you're serving other dishes at the same time, you could probably cut this in half.

Even though this looks overwhelming with the amount of ingredients...it is actually very easy and comes together quickly.  I made up extra packets of the seasonings and now can make this even quicker next time.  Made it as written and DH loved it.

Amazing recipe! I used all the ingredients, with the exception of the pinch of saffron, as I didnt have any, and neither did the grocery store.:( But it still turned out absolutely delicious. I made the following slight changes: Threw everything in the slow cooker and set on low for about 10 hours, tossed in some fresh basil and a dash of red wine towards the end of the cooking process, and used a bit of "Wondra" flour instead of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I also threw some diced potatoes along with the lamb and everything turned out beautifully. Served it with Curried Brown rice.AWESOME!

Excellent. After spending some time in Morocco, I can attest to the authenticity of this dish.   I use a traditional tagine to slow cook the meat. I'm unsure if this has any actual impact on the final product.

This was fantastic!!!  I'm going to try this spice mix on every meat I can.  Didn't use cubed meat, but lamb chops instead.  Very tender.

OK, so I'm rating a recipe when I changed the main ingredient, but it was so delicious I have to review it.  I changed the Lamb to Chicken, otherwise stuck to the recipe as written (oh yeah, had to use regular tomato paste).  This was company-good.  Served w/ cous cous cooked in chicken stock w/ plumped yellow raisins and garbanzo beans tossed in.  Next time I will add some fresh-frozen peas to the Tagine just prior to serving.

My roommate texted me from work this message within minutes of her lunch the day i made this: "wow, thank you for the best meal i've had in a year".  i made it as recommended with the Moroccan cous-cous and cucumber raita, and it was so good I was blown away I had made it at home--not a renowned chef! (all thanks to this recipe!).

My wonderful and gracious mother-in-law gifted me with a red, flame-top tagine by Emile Henry for Christmas and I prepared this recipe today to try out it out.  (If you are in the market for a tagine, this one is wonderful.)  It was absolutely incredible!  

The spice blend was perfect and the meat literally fell off the bone.  I used two bone-in chicken breasts, which I cooked whole, instead of the lamb.  I also subsituted two medium-sized Roma tomatoes, cut into medium-sized dices, for the sundried tomato paste.  

I served the "carrot, onion, garlic, ginger, and lemon zest" gravy over the sliced chicken breasts, which lay upon a tasty bed of toasted pine nut couscous. 

While this dish takes a bit of prep time, come meal time, you and whomever has the good fortune of sharing the meal with you will thank you for it!  

Thanks for this simply scrummptious recipe, Lisa!

This blend of spices made a beautiful rub. I used it on lamb chops, marinated them overnight, and then grilled them. They were so tasty and had wonderful color. Thanks!

great flavor!  the first time i made this recipe i followed it to a tee and it was really good.  the second time i made it i didn't feel like stewed rubbery meat so i made the sauce without stewing the meat. instead i grilled the lamb and then served the sauce over sliced, medium-rare fire roasted lamb.  It was sooooo good.

I made this with chicken....definitely cut the chicken into bite sizes first and roll in spices and let sit for a few days in the fridge.   The spices on fantastic... I was tempted to add a little curry, and glad that I didn't .

Served with couscous and I wanted to roll on the floor like a happy dog when I was done.

This my third time making this recipe. The flavor gives you an OMG moment from your first bite! I used beef and it was amazing. I didn't have all the spices and used curry powder. The main ingredients in curry powder are: tumeric, coriander, black pepper, garlic, fennel and cumin. Since it has most of the spices listed in this recipe I figured it was worth a shot (besides, I have a LOT of it. Lol!) The end result DOES NOT taste like curry AT ALL! It's just this, honest to goodness, I'm in heaven, no you can't have mine taste! It's waaaay better than traditional American beef stew!

Word to the wise, ALWAYS double this recipe.  You will regret it every time you don't!

Fantastic!  I used leg of lamb meat that I allowed to marinade for 3 days rather than just overnight. I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth.   Best tagine I've made so far!!

Loved this recipe! Tried it out. However, doubled up ALL the spices, and let it marinate for 16hrs (only because I marinated the previous night n cooked it for dinner the next day). The only change I would recommend to this recipe is to add the carrots much later, coz they had become very mushy by the end. Would have been nice if they preserved a tiny bit of crunch!Paired up the dish with Greek style buttered saffron rice

Delicious! I threw this into the slow cooker at 10 (on high) and it was ready by 2:30pm. I didn't have cayenne but it still tastes great. I served it over a bed of rice. To make the rice, I put some jasmine rice I had into the rice cooker and added some cinnamon and raisins to the water. Yummy! It is a little greasy and it is basically lamb stew but the spices add a delicious twist. Next time, I'd like to eliminate the oil and add more cornstarch for a thicker stew.

Excellent base recipe!  It lends itself to tinkering to suit your tastes.  If you happen to have a stove-ready clay tagine pot, it was made for this.

  **A note about saffron... others have said it isn't really a marinade ingredient.  This is true, but if like me you love saffron and have handfuls of the stuff you bought at a spice market, by all means, throw in a large pinch and then throw in some more while the lamb simmers.  Its unique flavor is irreplaceable.**

I used a little smoked paprika (1/4 tsp max), ground up a little caraway seed and added a dash of allspice.  In place of the tomato paste I used finely chopped oil-cured sund-dried tomatoes.  I skipped the carrots but added a can of rinsed and drained garbanzo beans near the end with a half pound of dried apricots and a couple of TBL chopped preserved lemon peel in place of the lemon zest.  I even tossed in a few wedges of an old-ish tomato I had laying around.  Once you have the lamb tender enough, you can really play around with the rest of the recipe.

It was served with couscous topped with toasted slivered almonds, steamed zucchini matchsticks on the side and I raked in the kudos....

OH My Goodness!! This is a great Lamb!! I have been anticipating to try this recipe for the longest, but was thrown off by the amount of ingredients. I enjoyed how well the seasoning blend together and the flavor of lamb. "Ras El Hanout" seasoning can also be used in place of most spices. I usually bake my lamb everytime I prepare it, however; I decided to try a new method for cooking lamb and this is a great recipe!! A good combination of food to have with lamb are rice and cabbage. The recipe mentioned 1 1/2 to 2hrs, but it only took my lamb about 40-45 minutes to simmer. I used lamb steak, therefore; it did not take as long.

This recipe is excellent; even my kids love it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I didn't have saffron and I used regular tomato paste.  I would say try this recipe if your looking for something a little different with a lot of flavor.

Really a wonderful blend of spices. I didn't have tomato paste or stock so added a can of diced oven roasted tomatoes instead with a little extra water. It turned out wonderfully.

The first thing my guests said when they came into the house was "what smells so good?"  This is such a fragrant recipe.  And despite the daunting list of ingredients, it is easy to make.  I used "lamb stew" lamb which was already cubed, but next time I think I will get a better cut of meat . The only other change I'd make is to use a little less broth.  I will definitely make this again, thanks!

I followed the advice in Lumiere's review (except for the extra-spicy harissa) and the dish was fantastic.  Lamb isn't carried in my local supermarkets so I used vennison and it turned out wonderful.  This is going into my recipe favorites!

This was just a perfect recipe, my husband loved it. I added the onions then the garlic, then ginger then I added the meat & stirred till all sides were brown & continued normally with the other ingredients. I added also a can of chickpeas & 10 minutes before it was done I added one sweet potatoe cut into cubes. It was great & definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe and one of my favourites. I cooked mine in a slow cooker and did find the carrots got a bit soggy, so next time I will add them later on in the cooking process.

I made this while I was staying with my daughter in Dubai.  It was amazing!   I made it with everything you listed but added pickled lemons (sliced) and added some dried apricots.   Now that I'm back home, I'm planning to make it for a crowd on Saturday.   Thank you for the great recipe!

all I can say is: super yummy!!! Cannot wait to make it again.

This will be a winner next time the relies come.

Thanks for sharing!

P.S.: I had to vary slightly as I only marinaded it for about 5hrs and cooked in the pressure cooker.

I made a leg of lamb and my family is not used to the flavor of the lamb. So when I used this recipe my family was just excited and didn't even know they were eating lamb! This one is a keeper.

The seasonings on this are simply to die for. I used lamb and followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I am going to do chicken next time and it promises to be just as good, I'm sure.

I made it today - I already had all the spices and it seemed like the perfect dish for a snowy Saturday - and served it in deep bowls over  your Moroccan Couscous  - just heavenly!  I'll make and enjoy these frequently in the future.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

I'm just learning to cook and this was a really great, easy and delicious recipe. My 15 month old son and chef husband loved it as well!!   I don't think I would change a thing, except maybe experiment with adding raisins or other veggies in the future.

I didnt have cayenne pepper, cardamom, saffron or honey. I used regular tomato paste instead of sundried. My husband is Mauritanian and he liked it. Next time I will try to have those ingredients on hand, and I think I will try leaving the carrots sliced into coins. I like the sweet taste of boiled carrot, it was not discernable with such small pieces of carrot.

Tried this and it turned out really great.  Thanks for the recipe.  Only diversion from the original recipe was in the preparation itself:  I used a pressure cooker.  I set aside the sauteed onions, carrots, garlic and ginger before adding the lamb pieces back into the pressure cooker with the rest of the ingredients and then putting on the lid.  20 minutes after, I took off the lid and returned the onions, carrots, garlic and ginger mixture.  Family loved it.  Thanks!

Restaurant grade!  Took less time to simmer than the recipe said (40-50 minutes), but this may have been because my hob wasn't on the lowest setting.  My only criticism would be perhaps a little salty for my palate.  Served it with cucumber raita and cous cous.  Everyone loved it, and I'll definitely make it again!

This is a fantastic dish.  I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and about 1/4 cup of golden raisins to it as well.  The tomatoes make it even MORE robust, while the raisins add a little bit of sweetness to it.  I will definitely make this one again!

Made the recipe as is, except for adding half a large butternut squash.  We cubed the squash and added it with the carrots.  The squash was a bit mushy but tasted great!  For the spices, I added them as directed except for the saffron.  As directed in most other recipes that use saffron, I put the pinch of saffron in a bowl with about 2 tbsp of water to let the flavour come out.  Then I added the saffron and the saffron water to the lamb along with the other spices.  Love the flavour of this recipe.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty good! Made this for dinner last weekend. My bf & I both liked it, but, I am not sure I would make it again (or often) b/c of the expense incurred & time involved. Thankfully I had most of the spices on hand w/ the exception of saffron & ground corriander. I went to my local specialty spice store for these items (I needed saffron for a couple of other recipes & a sm. bag of corriander only cost $1.75). I used chicken instead of lamb (didn't have a taste for red meat & it was much more $$$ - chx. was on sale this week). Prep was tedious. Since I had to use my food processor to puree my sun-dried tomatoes (all I had so I decided to make a paste out of them rather than buy a tube of stuff that I'll never use again), I hand chopped all of the veggies. My bf suggested going to see Star Trek this eve., so I had little time to "stew" everything on the stove. To copromise, I used my slow cooker. I followed every step up to the point of bringing everything to a boil. I dumped all ingredients into my sc and set to cook on low for 3 hrs. Served w/ suggested Moroccan couscous, a "creamy" store-bought cucumber salad (not raita...) & naan. The bf said that this would be much better with beef or lamb as directed, so try the recipe as is. Thx. for sharing :)

Superb flavors. The only change was I substituted ketchup for the sun-dried tomato paste (& only because I didn't have it in the house)-other than that I followed recipe exactly as submitted (something I wish others would do before changing all the ingredients and then rating. You will love this if you enjoy what I call "ethnic" flavors. Yum.

This is one of the best recipes I've found here!  Thanks!  The spice combination is superb and I think it would translate well to a slow simmered vegetarian stew.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

My family loved this recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and added two handfuls of golden raisin. I left out the saffron, but we didn't seem to miss it. I served it with plain couscous topped with parsely and crumbled feta. The feta gave the dish a tang that seem to round it out perfectly. Also made the cucumber raita.

Wow!!! I tripled the recipe for a larger group using chicken and it was still wonderful (it took 2 crock pots). I didn't do any shortcuts, which made this quite labor intensive - so next time I will chop things in my food processor and maybe use jar garlic and ginger (not as good, but time-saving.) 
This is too good not to make again!
It was great with the attached couscous and cucumber raita recipes.

This recipe had all the flavor and tenderness of a lamb dish I have been seeking for a while. I only made some minor modifications--left the spice rub on for 36 hours, used regular tomato paste instead of sun-dried--and it came out very well. The cooking time was a little long for a weeknight dinner, but I will definitely be making this again during the weekend.

I will second many of the comments made by others... I browned the lamb in a skillet, then put everything in my crock pot in the morning. I only used a can of chicken stock, and at first it doesn't look like it will be enough, but it is just the right amount. I actually had to add some cornstarch like suggested. My boyfriend and I could not wait to eat, we were thinking about dinner all day! The smell was marvelous! This dish is definitley worth the time. The lamb turned out so tender, it fell apart in your mouth. I served it over some boxed cous cous, with some fresh foccacia bread. Thank you for sharing this very ethnic and traditional recipe!

I cooked this for 100 people over the weekend,i served the lamb shanks with butternut squash,snowpeas and baby maris pipers,the only change i made was to add tinned plum tomatos to the sauce.The resulting orange powder is the same as osmenish powder i loved when i was in turkey its great to finally get the ingrediants which also work very well with chicken.A great success thanks for the recipe

This was very good and interesting. I would not recommend using lamb, or an expensive piece of meat the spices are so strong it is not worth it to spend extra. Go with chicken :)

I was looking for a recipe that would bring back the happy memories of our family trip to Marrakech.  This was it!  From the minute the spices started heating, my house smelled divine.  We ate the tagine with couscous, and it was almost as good as being back in Morocco.  Yum!

The flavors were rich and fragrant; just like a tagine I loved in my old college town. To make it more like my favorite version, I added about two handfuls of golden raisins and chickpeas, each, about 45 minutes before the dish was done. I added a bit of extra stock to make up for the liquid the raisins would absorb.

This is a really delicious stew.  I brought it to a dinner along wtih the couscous and cumcumber salad and everyone enjoyed it.  I found another very similar recipe and made a couple of additions just before serving.  1/4 cup cilantro, 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley and 3/4 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved.

We did not know quite what to expect, never having tried Moroccan food.  We really enjoyed the flavor.  The spices complimented one another very well, and although there are a lot of ingredients, the dish is really not difficult to make.

This was fantastic.  My husband loved it and has already requested it again a week later.  I really enjoyed it too dispite the fact that I'm not a big lamb fan.  The spices are delicious and smell amazing while cooking.

I consider this recipe a great starting point, and that's what I want from a recipe: shove me in the right direction and then I'll let my intuition take over.

I adopted some of the suggestions from the review by Oranaise, using caraway and allspice. Also her suggestion to eliminate saffron was right on. After reading the list of spices, my own thought was, "Saffron will be lost in here."

I made a few more changes: I used sumac instead of fresh ginger and added chopped up dried apricots. Those two things seem to be touchstones of Moroccan cuisine for me. I mounded the cayenne. I like it even hotter than that, but that was me holding back for my foodie guests and it was just right for their taste.

Some reviews complain about grease. With lamb, it's particularly important to trim fat. Unlike most proteins, lamb fat lends a dish an off-putting, gamey taste. In my opinion, too much fat is the reason most people who dislike lamb, dislike lamb.

I would definitely make this again, with one further change: that's a lot of carrot and if you add it at the beginning of the cook, it ends up much too soft for my taste.

As for flavor, this recipe has it. And the smell is wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Spices were wonderfully flavorful but not overpowering.  The butcher cut the lamb into cubes for me, though I ended up removing a bit more of the fat.  It was incredibly tender after 2 hours.  Great way to celebrate cooler weather

Really enjoyed making this. Instead of lemon zest i chopped up a preserved lemon and added some chopped dates and chopped apricots added a half teaspoon of ground allspice and sprinkled some toasted almonds over when serving. Served it with rice as we aren't couscous fans. The family loved it. Will make again.

I love this dish!  I found that when I was cooking the lamp before making the stew I often "sampled" the meat more than once, just to be sure of course that the amazing flavours were consistent!  I liked it so much that I now marinade lamb chops and then grill them instead of making the stew when I feel like being lazy or pairing with something else.  It's simply delicious!

I followed the modifications that Oranaise had suggested and I thought it was absolutely delicious! I served it over saffron couscous. I didn’t have any harissa but I did have some gochujang so I used that instead, tasted great! Thanks for the great recipe!

great easy and fun recipe, just be careful the types of honey you use - the first time i used a very mild syrupy honey and 1tbsp was perfect, the second time i use a very intense non-syrupy type of honey and it was too sweet. other than that, its great! 
I also put some harrisa in and gave it a bit more kick! love love love

I made this for dinner last night, but used chicken breast instead of lamb.  Instead of sun-dried tomato paste, I used regular tomato paste.  For the rice, I used Zatarain's Yellow Rice.  Everybody loved it!  It was amazing!  Will definitely be making this again, but will probably double-up on it so we can have a repeat the next night!  Next time I make it, though, I will not put the saffron in the marinade - another reviewer (Oranaise) is right about two things:  1)  you don't use chicken broth with lamb.  Use beef broth instead.  and 2)  Saffron is too expensive of a spice to waste on a marinade.  Instead, prepare it the correct way ahead of time and add it to the mix, when it's time to simmer for 2 hours.  I will, also, add in the other 2 spices Oranaise recommends (1/2 tsp caraway and 1/2 tsp allspice).

Really good flavors but the photos definitely did not match the end product.  Not sure how one can cook a carrot for 1 1/2 to 2 hours without it turning to mush.  If I make it again, which I am likely to do, I will put the carrots in (I also added parsnips and cauliflower) in the last half hour or so.

I heaped the measurements of the spices, but the lamb turned out quite bland.  Will try once more, doubling the spices.

Its pretty good, I am not sure what it is supposed to taste like.  The recipe instructions say to add honey, but I didn't see honey on the ingredient list. So once I seen that I started to wing the recipe in regards.  It tasted well,  but again I wasn't sure on how much sweetness it should have.

We loved this dish! It was flavorful and complex. I would also recommend adding salt to this dish, as it enhances the flavors tremendously. 
I wanted to make it a one pot meal, so I added some eggplant and a little potato along with the carrots and onions, and it worked excellently. I didn't have sundried tomato paste, so I had to do without. I'm not sure how much of a difference it would have made, but we loved it without! I'll try it again when I find some - should be even more complex.

AMAZING!!!  The smell before I even started browning the meat was AMAZING.  The meat itself before I mixed in the carrots and onions was good enough to have by itself.  This will definitely be added to the menu rotation.

This was a delicious dish. I used all the odd bits of lamb from buying a 1/2 lamb. I could it on a slow simmer for 5-6 hours. 
Instead of using stock, i used left over marinade from the day before's barbecue  and water.

This was a fantastic recipe as written, but I did tweak it a little bit. In reading other reviews  from oranaise and njoynjp, I didn't brown the meat and added it to the cooked veggies. I did add more veggies than the recipe stated and it turned out wonderful the flavor was amazing! I used beef broth instead of chicken. I skipped the saffron all together. Then when simmering I juiced half a lemon and threw in the spent peel. When it was time to eat I fished out the lemon peel and dished it up with rice and a cool cucumber salad.

There seem to be a lot of ingredients, but it goes together very easily.  I used wild goose instead of lamb as to me lamb is similar to venison and I thought goose would match the spices.  I marinated overnight and the next afternoon when I started to cook the goose, there was almost a need to wear a bib!  I was salivating very strongly due to the delicous aroma coming from the dutch oven.  Best of all, the flavour lived up to the smells.  I will definitely be making this again with venison, elk, and chicken.  Very nice with served up with millet.

Wow- this is even better than the fancy Moroccan place in town! 

I marinated my lamb in the spices overnight (minus the saffron) and added all the ingredients (with sautéed onions,  garlic and ginger) to my crock pot the next morning.  After work I tasted it and found it needed a little something,  so I added about 5 saffron threads,  which really brought out the complexity of the spices and blended well with the honey notes. I doubled the cayenne and added harissa to taste after it was done cooking since we like it hot!

*Just a side note that preserved lemons are pricey ($6 each at my specialty shop) and harissa isn't cheap either.  You could accomplish the same approximate flavor by going to an Indian grocery and purchasing citrus pickle, or "achar." Save yourself some money by going that route if you can.

It's quite similar to a familiar dish we have here in Singapore that's mostly served at weddings and Eid.  Easy and simple enough to follow.  I substituted a couple of spices but the end result is just as awesome. My family loved it!

My husband is from Northern  Africa and he said this was as good as his mom and his Aunt's cooking.  I used the flavor suggestions Ornaise listed, but threw it in the crock pot all day on low. I have made it a few times, sometimes I serve it over rice, sometimes couscous.  Next time I am going to add potatoes too.

I started the recipe in a le Creucet cast iron pot and then when all the ingredients were added I moved it to the oven at 390 F.  For about an hour.  I think it really helped thicken the tangine and really lock in the flavours.  It looked really rich and beautiful when I took the lid off.  This recipe is superb!!! Thank you

Good, but it really just reminded me of regular lamb stew, noting super fancy about it. I served it with couscous. It was fairly simple to make, but I don't feel as if this recipe is particularly unique in anyway.

I had leftover lamb and was looking to use it up.  I was so disappointed when I saw that the meat was supposed to marinate for several hours and then simmer for a while too.  I needed dinner faster than that.  :(  Anyway...the meat only marinated an hour and the simmering was only for 30 minutes, but it was still delicious.  I ended up using chicken and lamb together, chicken broth and omitted several spices like cloves, coriander, and cardamom (b/c I didn't have them).  My husband and I enjoyed the flavor and my toddler gobbled up the meat served with rice.  This recipe is a keeper even if you're not good at planning ahead.

Do not cut the carrots too thin, they will be soggy. Also nice to add 4-5 halved figs. I added large potato cubes to bulk this up for more people. The spice combination is awesome and I made it in bulk so I can whip this up. My tangine gets it perfect in 65-75 minutes so watch the time!

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars due to the fact that it's still on my stove simmering. I'm confident that it's a five after tasting, though. My house smells like some spice market dream right now. YUM!

I added one chopped sweet potato in when I added the carrots and it was AMAZING. I served this with couscous and even though it was my first time venturing into cooking moroccan food, everyone was VERY impressed. I was told I should make this recipe "a weekly thing" lol. Thanks so much!

I took a few liberties with the ingredients (only slightly!) and it still came out delicious!  I used beef instead of lamb (too expensive where I live), didn't really marinade it for more than ten minutes and bunged in a bit of mixed spice too (no cloves).  My guests raved about it and the extra portions (tomorrow's dinner) were snaffled up straight away.  I stuck it in a casserole dish, and left it on 180C in the oven for an hour and a half rather than doing it on the stove top. 
Perfect! I will definately be making this again :)

Excellent tagine.  I used all the ingredients and made as directed.  The result was tender and incredibly flavorful. I'm sure this recipe will be on our table frequently.  Thank you, BenevolentEmpress for submitting the recipe.  Very yummy tagine!!

I used what I had in the cupboard for this recipe; gram masala, pepper, chili powder, salt, curry powder cinnamon and cloves for the marinade. Gram masala has many of the spices listed here, so it substituted just fine. I put it in a sealable bag and let it sit overnight. I made this recipe as a stew with sweet potatoes and carrots, adding them after the lamb had browned. Then I added pieces of shaved ginger (I didn't have ground ginger) and minced garlic.
I used chicken broth and water to make it a stew.
My husband said it was 'okay' at first. But then, after sitting in the fridge for a day, I served it to him over rice and he said it was awesome. He ate it all in about two minutes and said it was great.
I thought it tasted fantastic both times; the curry and cinnamon tastes really blending well. The carrots and sweet potatoes went perfectly with it, too. And there was no need to steam them again of time, they softened right up while the stew stewed for about 30 min.
I will be making this again.

This was fabulous.  I didn't have all the spices on hand and couldn't marinade it for more than a couple hours but even so it was delicious and I can only image it would be even better if I had.  I used chicken thighs instead of lamb and threw in one apple chunked and a small handful of cranberries.  The whole family enjoyed it!

Excellent flavours.  Very hearty and filling.  Great for a winter dish.  I have also made it with goat and was also very tasty.  Plenty of leftovers and actually tastes better the next day.

This is excellent. I did not have the time to marinate so I cooked the onions and garlic and added the spice mixture to this before putting all in my slow cooker. I did not have the fresh ginger or sun-dired tomato paste so used chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I forgot the honey but it tasted great. With so many ingredients you don't need them all to take a stab but next time I will follow exactly. I would make this for company and know they would love it.

After reviewing this recipe and the rave reviews that accompanied it, I knew I had to try it.  Although it tasted fine, I really wasn't wowed by it, which disappointed me.  All in all, it was ok but just not worth the effort I put into this.  I won't be making it again.

this was so delicious - love the blend of spices. I wasn't able to simmer for the entire hour, just cut my carrots a little smaller so they'd cook faster - it was fantastic!

This is going to become one of my standard fall dinners.  I've already made it twice - once with lamb and once with goat - and both were amazing.  There's really no need to make any changes, but the recipe is quite forgiving and if you like to have a bit more of a kick, increase each spice by 50%.  You can also experiment with some different vegetables - substituting sweet potatoes for some of the carrots is good.  You can even make this by just throwing everything in a slow cooker for several hours.  So easy!

I made this for a dinner party & it was a 'Fabulous' success!! I did add a couple things of my own and increase the quantities of a couple of things though, as I used to work in a restaurant, where they made their own Lamb Tagine & I remembered a couple things.. Aswell as onions & carrots, I added a butternut squash & 3 large courgettes. Also I added a can of chopped tomatoes, extra tomato puree & more honey to give it added depth. Everyone at the dinner party now wants the recipe & I cant wait to make it again!!!

This recipe was delightful!  I just moved from New England to Louisiana...Because of my BF job we are constantly on the move.  We spend most of our time in a travel trailer with a stove & oven that are not ideal...but no matter how humble the appliances the meal still shined!  We used chix because no lamb was available & we were none-the-less enthralled by the entoxicating aroma & flavor of the dish!  Very Good!

Excellent.  I used chunks of leg of lamb.  My husband was skeptical at first, but he loved it.  Not at all gamey. I served it with the couscous, also excellent, but because they both have complex flavors I think the pairing was overkill.  Way better with roasted or boiled potatoes.  Yum!

Very tasty with all the seasonings! I used beef instead, since my husband doesn't care for lamb meat. And I made it in my slow cooker! A keeper!

Fabulous.  The spice mix is terrific. I followed the recipe but not did not use cornstarch as I prefer a 'soupy' couscous.
Whole family loved this meal. It will come a family classic. Thank you.

Lisa - can I blog about your wonderful recipe?  lynn@mamasays.us

Love this recipe. I have made it several times. First time as written, second time in the crock pot. The latest version is to marinade a butterflied leg of  lamb in the olive oil and 3/4 of the spices overnight. Grill the lamb outdoors. Cook the carrots, onions, etc. and pour over sliced grilled lamb. Wonderful.

I used ras al hanout season blend from Cosst Plus as noted by other reviewers.  I used that instead of all of the other spices and it came out great.  I also made lamb and chicken together and it came out perfect.  I cooked the chicken and veggies and then put it in a slow cooker for a couple hours.  My husband really liked this recipe - although, he did say he would have liked it served with rice (he's a simple eater).  This went perfectly with the Moroccan Couscous and Cucumber Raita.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe. If you live in the metro-Detroit area, I recommend going to Rocky's Peanuts across the street from the Farmer's Market to buy the spices, they have all of them, even saffron! All those wonderful spices blended together with the lamb served over a bed of couscous was delicious. I still have enough of the spices to make another Lamb Tagine, which I will this spring. I highly recommend this recipe.

I really liked this recipe and have made it several times this winter.  It is really comforting during the cold winter nights.  The sweetness of the carrots really balance out the spiciness.

The sauce was wonderful and very tasty. The meat was very tender. If you like lamb, this is a great recipe.

While this recipe isn't quite our taste, the flavors complimented each other well.  The lamb was tender and flavorful.  It was a nice change.

I've made this twice for two different dinner parties. Everyone LOVES it! I serve it with rice or couscous and I've also made spanakopita as a side dish/appetizer to go along with it.

Yum!  I added a bit more spice with red pepper flakes and more cayenne, and served it with rice.  Thanks a bunch for this post!
