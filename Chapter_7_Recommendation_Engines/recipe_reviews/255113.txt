Made as written and even though I love a Chicago dog and all the ingredients that go in it, I didn't love this. I'm not sure it all goes with salmon as much as it seemed like it would. I'm thinking beef or chicken would have been a better vessel? I don't know? Salmon is hard to flavor for me though so maybe this did work better than I thought it did and you might really like it. I love the mustard/salmon flavor combo but the mustard got lost in this. Double it up and give this one a try but don't forget the celery seed because it played an important role and was probably my favorite part in the end.
