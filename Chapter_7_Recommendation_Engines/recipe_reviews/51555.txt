This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I used hot chili beans ( drained ) and this worked out well - just a little extra heat.

I didn't have pinto beans so I substituted black beans.  I also used medium La Victoria Salsa Suprema for a little extra heat.  It was delicious!  I cook for two so there were some leftovers.  A friend tried it and demanded that I give her the recipe.

My husband loved this. I thought it was good but a little dry.  Next time I will use more sauce and I may try flour tortillas.  I used light cheese to reduce the fat.

Very tasty. I cooked it tonight. My husband and I liked it very much. Will make it again. I used 2% cheese and it came out great.

Pretty good! We designated tonight as mexican night at our house and served this dish with two appetizer-like dishes (also found on this site) as our "sidedishes." Everyone had fun with it and enjoyed this meal. I used chili beans instead of kidney beans and added a jar of diced pimentos. Served over a bed of shredded lettuce and for some, added a dollop of sour cream on the top. Would make this again. The type of salsa you use will determine the amt of heat in the meal! Thanks again Ortega!

My boyfriend (who's picky with food)actually loved this dish! By mistake, I made it with corn taco shells (broken up) but despite the mistake we both really liked it. Next time, I'll use the corn tortillas.

I ended up using kidney beans soaked overnight (to saturation) and found them to be a little tough.  The flavor was pretty good, but my preference would be to cut back some on the beans and substitute some of the protein with chicken.  However, if you are looking for a vegetarian dish it would be fine as is.  Lots of flavor.
